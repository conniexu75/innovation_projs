https://openalex.org/W2025183726,"Human cancer cells typically harbour multiple chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide substitutions and epigenetic modifications that drive malignant transformation. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pilot project aims to assess the value of large-scale multi-dimensional analysis of these molecular characteristics in human cancer and to provide the data rapidly to the research community. Here we report the interim integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas--the most common type of adult brain cancer--and nucleotide sequence aberrations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. This analysis provides new insights into the roles of ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, uncovers frequent mutations of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1, and provides a network view of the pathways altered in the development of glioblastoma. Furthermore, integration of mutation, DNA methylation and clinical treatment data reveals a link between MGMT promoter methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas, an observation with potential clinical implications. Together, these findings establish the feasibility and power of TCGA, demonstrating that it can rapidly expand knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2040827479,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal type of brain cancer. To identify the genetic alterations in GBMs, we sequenced 20,661 protein coding genes, determined the presence of amplifications and deletions using high-density oligonucleotide arrays, and performed gene expression analyses using next-generation sequencing technologies in 22 human tumor samples. This comprehensive analysis led to the discovery of a variety of genes that were not known to be altered in GBMs. Most notably, we found recurrent mutations in the active site of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) in 12% of GBM patients. Mutations in IDH1 occurred in a large fraction of young patients and in most patients with secondary GBMs and were associated with an increase in overall survival. These studies demonstrate the value of unbiased genomic analyses in the characterization of human brain cancer and identify a potentially useful genetic alteration for the classification and targeted therapy of GBMs."
https://openalex.org/W2138155367,"There are currently few therapeutic options for patients with pancreatic cancer, and new insights into the pathogenesis of this lethal disease are urgently needed. Toward this end, we performed a comprehensive genetic analysis of 24 pancreatic cancers. We first determined the sequences of 23,219 transcripts, representing 20,661 protein-coding genes, in these samples. Then, we searched for homozygous deletions and amplifications in the tumor DNA by using microarrays containing probes for approximately 10(6) single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We found that pancreatic cancers contain an average of 63 genetic alterations, the majority of which are point mutations. These alterations defined a core set of 12 cellular signaling pathways and processes that were each genetically altered in 67 to 100% of the tumors. Analysis of these tumors' transcriptomes with next-generation sequencing-by-synthesis technologies provided independent evidence for the importance of these pathways and processes. Our data indicate that genetically altered core pathways and regulatory processes only become evident once the coding regions of the genome are analyzed in depth. Dysregulation of these core pathways and processes through mutation can explain the major features of pancreatic tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2022101765,"Described decades ago, the Warburg effect of aerobic glycolysis is a key metabolic hallmark of cancer, yet its significance remains unclear. In this Essay, we re-examine the Warburg effect and establish a framework for understanding its contribution to the altered metabolism of cancer cells. Described decades ago, the Warburg effect of aerobic glycolysis is a key metabolic hallmark of cancer, yet its significance remains unclear. In this Essay, we re-examine the Warburg effect and establish a framework for understanding its contribution to the altered metabolism of cancer cells. It is hard to begin a discussion of cancer cell metabolism without first mentioning Otto Warburg. A pioneer in the study of respiration, Warburg made a striking discovery in the 1920s. He found that, even in the presence of ample oxygen, cancer cells prefer to metabolize glucose by glycolysis, a seeming paradox as glycolysis, when compared to oxidative phosphorylation, is a less efficient pathway for producing ATP (Warburg, 1956Warburg O. Science. 1956; 124: 269-270PubMed Google Scholar). The Warburg effect has since been demonstrated in different types of tumors and the concomitant increase in glucose uptake has been exploited clinically for the detection of tumors by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Although aerobic glycolysis has now been generally accepted as a metabolic hallmark of cancer, its causal relationship with cancer progression is still unclear. In this Essay, we discuss the possible drivers, advantages, and potential liabilities of the altered metabolism of cancer cells (Figure 1). Although our emphasis on the Warburg effect reflects the focus of the field, we would also like to encourage a broader approach to the study of cancer metabolism that takes into account the contributions of all interconnected small molecule pathways of the cell. One compelling idea to explain the Warburg effect is that the altered metabolism of cancer cells confers a selective advantage for survival and proliferation in the unique tumor microenvironment. As the early tumor expands, it outgrows the diffusion limits of its local blood supply, leading to hypoxia and stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, HIF. HIF initiates a transcriptional program that provides multiple solutions to hypoxic stress (reviewed in Kaelin and Ratcliffe, 2008Kaelin Jr., W.G. Ratcliffe P.J. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 393-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). Because a decreased dependence on aerobic respiration becomes advantageous, cell metabolism is shifted toward glycolysis by the increased expression of glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporters, and inhibitors of mitochondrial metabolism. In addition, HIF stimulates angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) by upregulating several factors, including most prominently vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Blood vessels recruited to the tumor microenvironment, however, are disorganized, may not deliver blood effectively, and therefore do not completely alleviate hypoxia (reviewed in Gatenby and Gillies, 2004Gatenby R.A. Gillies R.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (3410) Google Scholar). The oxygen levels within a tumor vary both spatially and temporally, and the resulting rounds of fluctuating oxygen levels potentially select for tumors that constitutively upregulate glycolysis. Interestingly, with the possible exception of tumors that have lost the von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL), which normally mediates degradation of HIF, HIF is still coupled to oxygen levels, as evident from the heterogeneity of HIF expression within the tumor microenvironment (Wiesener et al., 2001Wiesener M.S. Munchenhagen P.M. Berger I. Morgan N.V. Roigas J. Schwiertz A. Jurgensen J.S. Gruber G. Maxwell P.H. Loning S.A. et al.Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5215-5222PubMed Google Scholar, Zhong et al., 1999Zhong H. De Marzo A.M. Laughner E. Lim M. Hilton D.A. Zagzag D. Buechler P. Isaacs W.B. Semenza G.L. Simons J.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5830-5835PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the Warburg effect—that is, an uncoupling of glycolysis from oxygen levels—cannot be explained solely by upregulation of HIF. Other molecular mechanisms are likely to be important, such as the metabolic changes induced by oncogene activation and tumor suppressor loss. Not only may the tumor microenvironment select for a deranged metabolism, but oncogene status can also drive metabolic changes. Since Warburg's time, the biochemical study of cancer metabolism has been overshadowed by efforts to identify the mutations that contribute to cancer initiation and progression. Recent work, however, has demonstrated that the key components of the Warburg effect—increased glucose consumption, decreased oxidative phosphorylation, and accompanying lactate production—are also distinguishing features of oncogene activation. The signaling molecule Ras, a powerful oncogene when mutated, promotes glycolysis (reviewed in Dang and Semenza, 1999Dang C.V. Semenza G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 68-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, Ramanathan et al., 2005Ramanathan A. Wang C. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 5992-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Akt kinase, a well-characterized downstream effector of insulin signaling, reprises its role in glucose uptake and utilization in the cancer setting (reviewed in Manning and Cantley, 2007Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Cell. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4430) Google Scholar), whereas the Myc transcription factor upregulates the expression of various metabolic genes (reviewed in Gordan et al., 2007Gordan J.D. Thompson C.B. Simon M.C. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 108-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The most parsimonious route to tumorigenesis may be activation of key oncogenic nodes that execute a proliferative program, of which metabolism may be one important arm. Moreover, regulation of metabolism is not exclusive to oncogenes. Loss of the tumor suppressor protein p53 prevents expression of the gene encoding SCO2 (the synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase protein), which interferes with the function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Matoba et al., 2006Matoba S. Kang J.G. Patino W.D. Wragg A. Boehm M. Gavrilova O. Hurley P.J. Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Science. 2006; 312: 1650-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). A second p53 effector, TIGAR (TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator), inhibits glycolysis by decreasing levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a potent stimulator of glycolysis and inhibitor of gluconeogenesis (Bensaad et al., 2006Bensaad K. Tsuruta A. Selak M.A. Vidal M.N. Nakano K. Bartrons R. Gottlieb E. Vousden K.H. Cell. 2006; 126: 107-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). Other work also suggests that p53-mediated regulation of glucose metabolism may be dependent on the transcription factor NF-κB (Kawauchi et al., 2008Kawauchi K. Araki K. Tobiume K. Tanaka N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). It has been shown that inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) prevents the Warburg effect and forces cancer cells to revert to oxidative phosphorylation in order to reoxidize NADH and produce ATP (Fantin et al., 2006Fantin V.R. St-Pierre J. Leder P. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 425-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar, Shim et al., 1997Shim H. Dolde C. Lewis B.C. Wu C.S. Dang G. Jungmann R.A. Dalla-Favera R. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 6658-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). While the cells are respiratory competent, they exhibit attenuated tumor growth, suggesting that aerobic glycolysis might be essential for cancer progression. In a primary fibroblast cell culture model of stepwise malignant transformation through overexpression of telomerase, large and small T antigen, and the H-Ras oncogene, increasing tumorigenicity correlates with sensitivity to glycolytic inhibition. This finding suggests that the Warburg effect might be inherent to the molecular events of transformation (Ramanathan et al., 2005Ramanathan A. Wang C. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 5992-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). However, the introduction of similar defined factors into human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) revealed that transformation can be associated with increased dependence on oxidative phosphorylation (Funes et al., 2007Funes J.M. Quintero M. Henderson S. Martinez D. Qureshi U. Westwood C. Clements M.O. Bourboulia D. Pedley R.B. Moncada S. Boshoff C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 6223-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when introduced in vivo these transformed MSCs do upregulate glycolytic genes, an effect that is reversed when the cells are explanted and cultured under normoxic conditions. These contrasting models suggest that the Warburg effect may be context dependent, in some cases driven by genetic changes and in others by the demands of the microenvironment. Regardless of whether the tumor microenvironment or oncogene activation plays a more important role in driving the development of a distinct cancer metabolism, it is likely that the resulting alterations confer adaptive, proliferative, and survival advantages on the cancer cell. Although studies in cancer metabolism have largely been energy-centric, rapidly dividing cells have diverse requirements. Proliferating cells require not only ATP but also nucleotides, fatty acids, membrane lipids, and proteins, and a reprogrammed metabolism may serve to support synthesis of macromolecules. Recent studies have shown that several steps in lipid synthesis are required for and may even actively promote tumorigenesis. Inhibition of ATP citrate lyase, the distal enzyme that converts mitochondrial-derived citrate into cytosolic acetyl coenzyme A, the precursor for many lipid species, prevents cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth (Hatzivassiliou et al., 2005Hatzivassiliou G. Zhao F. Bauer D.E. Andreadis C. Shaw A.N. Dhanak D. Hingorani S.R. Tuveson D.A. Thompson C.B. Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 311-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Fatty acid synthase, expressed at low levels in normal tissues, is upregulated in cancer and may also be required for tumorigenesis (reviewed in Menendez and Lupu, 2007Menendez J.A. Lupu R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 763-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cancer cells may also enhance their biosynthetic capabilities by expressing a tumor-specific form of pyruvate kinase (PK), M2-PK. Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the third irreversible reaction of glycolysis, the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate. Surprisingly, the M2-PK of cancer cells is thought to be less active in the conversion of PEP to pyruvate and thus less efficient at ATP production (reviewed in Mazurek et al., 2005Mazurek S. Boschek C.B. Hugo F. Eigenbrodt E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2005; 15: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). A major advantage to the cancer cell, however, is that the glycolytic intermediates upstream of PEP might be shunted into synthetic processes. Recent work has found that the cancer-specific M2-PK causes an increase in the incorporation of glucose carbons into lipids and, expanding the connection between growth factor signaling and cancer metabolism, may be regulated by phosphotyrosine binding (Christofk et al., 2008aChristofk H.R. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Ramanathan A. Gerszten R.E. Wei R. Fleming M.D. Schreiber S.L. Cantley L.C. Nature. 2008; 452: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar, Christofk et al., 2008bChristofk H.R. Vander Heiden M.G. Wu N. Asara J.M. Cantley L.C. Nature. 2008; 452: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Making the building blocks of the cell, however, incurs an energetic cost and cannot fully explain the Warburg effect. Biosynthesis, in addition to causing an inherent increase in ATP demand in order to execute synthetic reactions, should also cause a decrease in ATP supply as various glycolytic and Krebs cycle intermediates are diverted. Lipid synthesis, for example, requires the cooperation of glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the pentose phosphate shunt. As pyruvate must enter the mitochondria in this case, it avoids conversion to lactate and therefore cannot contribute to glycolysis-derived ATP. Moreover, whereas increased biosynthesis may explain the glucose hunger of cancer cells, it cannot explain the increase in lactic acid production originally described by Warburg, suggesting that lactate must also result from the metabolism of non-glucose substrates. Recently, it has been demonstrated that glutamine may be metabolized by the citric acid cycle in cancer cells and converted into lactate, producing NADPH for lipid biosynthesis and oxaloacetate for replenishment of Krebs cycle intermediates (DeBerardinis et al., 2007DeBerardinis R.J. Mancuso A. Daikhin E. Nissim I. Yudkoff M. Wehrli S. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 19345-19350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). In addition to involvement in proliferation, altered metabolism may promote another cancer-essential function: the avoidance of apoptosis. Loss of the p53 target TIGAR sensitizes cancer cells to apoptosis, most likely by causing an increase in reactive oxygen species (Bensaad et al., 2006Bensaad K. Tsuruta A. Selak M.A. Vidal M.N. Nakano K. Bartrons R. Gottlieb E. Vousden K.H. Cell. 2006; 126: 107-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). On the other hand, overexpression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) prevents caspase-independent cell death, presumably by stimulating glycolysis, increasing cellular ATP levels, and promoting autophagy (Colell et al., 2007Colell A. Ricci J.E. Tait S. Milasta S. Maurer U. Bouchier-Hayes L. Fitzgerald P. Guio-Carrion A. Waterhouse N.J. Li C.W. et al.Cell. 2007; 129: 983-997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Whether or not GAPDH plays a physiological role in the regulation of cell death remains to be determined. Intriguingly, Bonnet et al., 2007Bonnet S. Archer S.L. Allalunis-Turner J. Haromy A. Beaulieu C. Thompson R. Lee C.T. Lopaschuk G.D. Puttagunta L. Harry G. et al.Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 37-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar have reported that treating cancer cells with dichloroacetate (DCA), a small molecule inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, has striking effects on their survival and on xenograft tumor growth. DCA, a currently approved treatment for congenital lactic acidosis, activates oxidative phosphorylation and promotes apoptosis by two mechanisms. First, increased flux through the electron transport chain causes depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (which the authors found to be hyperpolarized specifically in cancer cells) and release of the apoptotic effector cytochrome c. Second, an increase in reactive oxygen species generated by oxidative phosphorylation upregulates the voltage-gated K+ channel, leading to potassium ion efflux and caspase activation. Their work suggests that cancer cells may shift their metabolism to glycolysis in order to prevent cell death and that forcing cancer cells to respire aerobically can counteract this adaptation. Although this preliminary work has prompted some cancer patients to self-medicate with DCA, a controlled clinical trial will be essential to demonstrate unequivocally the safety and efficacy of DCA as an anti-cancer agent. Cancer cells may rewire metabolic pathways to exploit the tumor microenvironment and to support cancer-specific signaling. Without access to the central circulation, it is possible that metabolites can be concentrated locally and reach suprasystemic levels, allowing cancer cells to engage in metabolite-mediated autocrine and paracrine signaling that does not occur in normal tissues. So-called androgen-independent prostate cancers may only be independent from exogenous, adrenal-synthesized androgens. Androgen-independent prostate cancer cells still express the androgen receptor and may be capable of autonomously synthesizing their own androgens (Stanbrough et al., 2006Stanbrough M. Bubley G.J. Ross K. Golub T.R. Rubin M.A. Penning T.M. Febbo P.G. Balk S.P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 2815-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Perhaps the more provocative but as yet untested idea is that metabolites in the diffusion-limited tumor microenvironment could be acting as paracrine signaling molecules. Traditionally thought of as a glycolytic waste product, lactate may be one such signal. As noted above, it has been found that inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase can block tumor growth, most likely by multiple mechanisms. Much of the evidence for lactate as a multifunctional metabolite comes from work in exercise physiology and muscle metabolism (reviewed in Philp et al., 2005Philp A. Macdonald A.L. Watt P.W. J. Exp. Biol. 2005; 208: 4561-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Transported by several monocarboxylate transporters, lactate may be shared and metabolized among cells, although the idea is still controversial (Hashimoto et al., 2006Hashimoto T. Hussien R. Brooks G.A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 290: E1237-E1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, Yoshida et al., 2007Yoshida Y. Holloway G.P. Ljubicic V. Hatta H. Spriet L.L. Hood D.A. Bonen A. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 1317-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The interconversion of lactate and pyruvate might alter the NAD+/NADH ratio in cells, and lactate exchange may serve to coordinate the metabolism of a group of cells. The tumor-stroma interaction may therefore have a metabolic component (Koukourakis et al., 2006Koukourakis M.I. Giatromanolaki A. Harris A.L. Sivridis E. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Cancer cells respond cell-autonomously to hypoxia to initiate angiogenesis, and so it would be exciting if a metabolite such as lactate could positively amplify this angiogenic program, a process that requires a semicoordinated effort among multiple cells. Indeed, acidosis often precedes angiogenesis, and lactate may stimulate HIF expression independently of hypoxia (Fukumura et al., 2001Fukumura D. Xu L. Chen Y. Gohongi T. Seed B. Jain R.K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6020-6024PubMed Google Scholar, Lu et al., 2002Lu H. Forbes R.A. Verma A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23111-23115Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, Shi et al., 2001Shi Q. Le X. Wang B. Abbruzzese J.L. Xiong Q. He Y. Xie K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3751-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Cancer cells, by participating in a kind of quorum sensing and coordinating their metabolism, may therefore act as a pseudo-organ. Not only is metabolism downstream of oncogenic pathways, but an altered upstream metabolism may affect the activity of signaling pathways that normally sense the state of the cell. Individuals with inherited mutations in succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase develop highly angiogenic tumors, not unlike those exhibiting loss of the VHL tumor suppressor protein that acts upstream of HIF (reviewed in Kaelin and Ratcliffe, 2008Kaelin Jr., W.G. Ratcliffe P.J. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 393-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). The mechanism of tumorigenesis in these cancer syndromes is still contentious. However, it has been proposed that loss of succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase causes an accumulation of succinate or fumarate, respectively, leading to inhibition of the prolyl hydroxylases that mark HIF for VHL-mediated degradation (Isaacs et al., 2005Isaacs J.S. Jung Y.J. Mole D.R. Lee S. Torres-Cabala C. Chung Y.L. Merino M. Trepel J. Zbar B. Toro J. et al.Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 143-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, Pollard et al., 2005Pollard P.J. Briere J.J. Alam N.A. Barwell J. Barclay E. Wortham N.C. Hunt T. Mitchell M. Olpin S. Moat S.J. et al.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2231-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, Selak et al., 2005Selak M.A. Armour S.M. MacKenzie E.D. Boulahbel H. Watson D.G. Mansfield K.D. Pan Y. Simon M.C. Thompson C.B. Gottlieb E. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 77-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). In this rare case, succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase are acting as bona fide tumor suppressors. Mutations in metabolic genes, however, need not be a cancer-causing event. More subtly, the activation of various metabolic pathways might modulate the activity of downstream pro-cancer factors. Whereas it is well-accepted that growth factor signaling is commonly dysregulated in cancer, the involvement of nutrient or energy signaling in cancer remains unclear. In prokaryotes, various metabolites are sensed directly by the signaling machinery. The mammalian pathways that respond to energy and nutrient status may also interface with metabolites directly. It is well established that AMP-kinase senses the AMP/ATP ratio (reviewed in Hardie, 2007Hardie D.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar), whereas mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin) senses cellular amino acid concentrations (Kim et al., 2008Kim E. Goraksha-Hicks P. Li L. Neufeld T.P. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar, Sancak et al., 2008Sancak Y. Peterson T.R. Shaul Y.D. Lindquist R.A. Thoreen C.C. Bar-Peled L. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2008; 320: 1496-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). Both AMP-kinase and mTOR have been linked to tumor syndromes. It is possible that one way to upregulate these pro-growth signaling pathways is to increase the levels of the normal metabolites that they sense. Although altered metabolism confers several advantages on the cancer cell, it does not come without disadvantages. As a consequence of a deranged or simply overactive metabolism, cancer cells may be burdened with toxic byproducts that require disposal. So far, there is relatively little evidence for this hypothesis in the existing literature, but a few examples do suggest that cancer cells require detoxification mechanisms to maintain survival. Although there are enzymes that detoxify exogenous toxins, several “house-cleaning” enzymes, a term coined from studies in bacteria, deal with endogenous toxic metabolites (reviewed in Galperin et al., 2006Galperin M.Y. Moroz O.V. Wilson K.S. Murzin A.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The best example of “house-cleaning” enzymes are the NUDIX (noncanonical nucleoside diphosphate linked to some other moiety X) hydrolases, a family of enzymes that act on the nucleotide pool and remove noncanonical nucleoside triphosphates. When incorporated into the DNA, these aberrant nucleotides can lead to mismatches, mutations, and eventually cell death. The dUTP pyrophosphatase (DUT), which hydrolyzes dUTP to dUMP and prevents the incorporation of uracils into DNA, may play a role in resistance to thymidylate synthase inhibitors. Suppression of DUT sensitizes some cancer cells to pyrimidine antimetabolites, suggesting that inhibition of these cellular house-cleaning enzymes may be an effective adjunct chemotherapeutic strategy (Koehler and Ladner, 2004Koehler S.E. Ladner R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 620-626PubMed Google Scholar). The lactate production associated with the shift to a glycolytic metabolism is thought to contribute to the acidification of the microenvironment. Able to adapt to and even benefit from an acidic environment, cancer cells have been shown to upregulate vacuolar H+-ATPases, Na+-H+ antiporters, and H+-linked monocarboxylate transporters (reviewed in Gatenby and Gillies, 2004Gatenby R.A. Gillies R.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (3410) Google Scholar). Inhibition of these adaptive mechanisms can lead to decreased viability of cancer cells and increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents (reviewed in Fais et al., 2007Fais S. De Milito A. You H. Qin W. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 10627-10630Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, Fang et al., 2006Fang J. Quinones Q.J. Holman T.L. Morowitz M.J. Wang Q. Zhao H. Sivo F. Maris J.M. Wahl M.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 2108-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Many mysteries remain unsolved in our understanding of even normal human metabolism, let alone that of cancer cells. The metabolic pathways of the mammalian cell and their many interconnections are incomplete, as many enzymes remain unannotated in the human genome. Although we have guesses by homology, the identities of the human enzymes that catalyze reactions we know must occur are still elusive. In addition to annotating all human metabolic genes, the “ins” and the “outs” (i.e., the metabolites that enter and exit cells) should be measured and cataloged. It is also entirely unclear what percentage of the cellular fuel is normally used for ATP generation, biosynthesis, or other processes. And with few exceptions surprisingly little is known about intercellular metabolism. Much of our understanding of metabolism has been inherited from work in simple organisms; the compartmental nature of human metabolism is an exciting area of potential exploration. Although aerobic glycolysis is the most characterized, although still puzzling, metabolic phenomenon in cancer, many other aspects of cancer metabolism are likely to be derangements of normal metabolism and ought to be elucidated. The nutrient conditions of the tumor microenvironment have not yet been carefully examined. Cancer cells, despite engaging in energy-costly processes, must still be able to maintain ATP levels, by either relying on increased flux through glycolysis or utilizing a diversity of fuel sources. Several hypotheses exist as to why a fraction of tumors are refractory to imaging by FDG-PET. One possibility is that certain cancer cells may not be primarily glucose-metabolizers but may rely on alternative fuel sources, the detailed characterization of which may lead to the detection and treatment of “PET-negative” tumors. Furthermore, there are more complex questions to be answered: Is it possible that cancer cells exhibit “metabolite addiction”? Are there unique cancer-specific metabolic pathways, or combinations of pathways, utilized by the cancer cell but not by normal cells? Are different stages of metabolic adaptations required for the cancer cell to progress from the primary tumor stage to invasion to metastasis? How malleable is cancer metabolism? From a therapeutic perspective, knowledge of the causes, benefits, and vulnerabilities of cancer cell metabolism will enable the identification of new drug targets and will facilitate the design of metabolite mimetics that are uniquely taken up by cancer cells or converted into the active form by enzymes upregulated in tumors. Profiling of either metabolites or enzymatic activities may allow us to develop diagnostic tests of cancer, and metabolite derivatives can be used for the molecular imaging of cancer, as exemplified by FDG-PET. We find the possibility of a new class of cancer therapeutics and diagnostic tools especially exciting. Therefore, we emphasize the need to explore beyond a glucose and energy-centric driven model of cancer metabolism to a broader one that encompasses all of the metabolic needs of a cancer cell. Perhaps it is time to step out from under Warburg's shadow. We thank T. DiCesare for help with the figure."
https://openalex.org/W2051822378,"Photoredox catalysis and organocatalysis represent two powerful fields of molecule activation that have found widespread application in the areas of inorganic and organic chemistry, respectively. We merged these two catalysis fields to solve problems in asymmetric chemical synthesis. Specifically, the enantioselective intermolecular α-alkylation of aldehydes has been accomplished using an interwoven activation pathway that combines both the photoredox catalyst Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 (where bpy is 2,2′-bipyridine) and an imidazolidinone organocatalyst. This broadly applicable, yet previously elusive, alkylation reaction is now highly enantioselective and operationally trivial."
https://openalex.org/W2031675844,"Aerosols serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and thus have a substantial effect on cloud properties and the initiation of precipitation. Large concentrations of human-made aerosols have been reported to both decrease and increase rainfall as a result of their radiative and CCN activities. At one extreme, pristine tropical clouds with low CCN concentrations rain out too quickly to mature into long-lived clouds. On the other hand, heavily polluted clouds evaporate much of their water before precipitation can occur, if they can form at all given the reduced surface heating resulting from the aerosol haze layer. We propose a conceptual model that explains this apparent dichotomy."
https://openalex.org/W2016889766,"Gold nanocrystals absorbed on metal oxides have exceptional properties in oxidation catalysis, including the oxidation of carbon monoxide at ambient temperatures, but the identification of the active catalytic gold species among the many present on real catalysts is challenging. We have used aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy to analyze several iron oxide–supported catalyst samples, ranging from those with little or no activity to others with high activities. High catalytic activity for carbon monoxide oxidation is correlated with the presence of bilayer clusters that are ∼0.5 nanometer in diameter and contain only ∼10 gold atoms. The activity of these bilayer clusters is consistent with that demonstrated previously with the use of model catalyst systems."
https://openalex.org/W2163482204,"Circulating nucleic acids (CNAs) offer unique opportunities for early diagnosis of clinical conditions. Here we show that microRNAs, a family of small non-coding regulatory RNAs involved in human development and pathology, are present in bodily fluids and represent new effective biomarkers.After developing protocols for extracting and quantifying microRNAs in serum and other body fluids, the serum microRNA profiles of several healthy individuals were determined and found to be similar, validating the robustness of our methods. To address the possibility that the abundance of specific microRNAs might change during physiological or pathological conditions, serum microRNA levels in pregnant and non pregnant women were compared. In sera from pregnant women, microRNAs associated with human placenta were significantly elevated and their levels correlated with pregnancy stage.Considering the central role of microRNAs in development and disease, our results highlight the medically relevant potential of determining microRNA levels in serum and other body fluids. Thus, microRNAs are a new class of CNAs that promise to serve as useful clinical biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2099662390,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been attributed to aberrant mucosal immunity to the intestinal microbiota. The transcription factor XBP1, a key component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, is required for development and maintenance of secretory cells and linked to JNK activation. We hypothesized that a stressful environmental milieu in a rapidly proliferating tissue might instigate a proinflammatory response. We report that Xbp1 deletion in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) results in spontaneous enteritis and increased susceptibility to induced colitis secondary to both Paneth cell dysfunction and an epithelium that is overly reactive to inducers of IBD such as bacterial products (flagellin) and TNFα. An association of XBP1 variants with both forms of human IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) was identified and replicated (rs35873774; p value 1.6 × 10−5) with novel, private hypomorphic variants identified as susceptibility factors. Hence, intestinal inflammation can originate solely from XBP1 abnormalities in IECs, thus linking cell-specific ER stress to the induction of organ-specific inflammation.

Hence, intestinal inflammation can originate solely from XBP1 abnormalities in IECs, thus linking cell-specific ER stress to the induction of organ-specific inflammation. In eukaryotes, signals emanating from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induce a transcriptional program that enables cells to survive ER stress. This highly coordinated response, the unfolded protein response (UPR), facilitates the folding, processing, export, and degradation of proteins emanating from the ER during stressed conditions (Ron and Walter, 2007Ron D. Walter P. Signal integration in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4409) Google Scholar). Three distinct UPR signaling pathways exist in mammalian cells that include ER transmembrane inositol-requiring enzyme 1α and β (IRE1α and β), pancreatic ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) (Wu and Kaufman, 2006Wu J. Kaufman R.J. From acute ER stress to physiological roles of the unfolded protein response.Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The most evolutionarily conserved of these is the kinase/endoribonuclease IRE1, whose activation by ER stress results in the excision of a 26 bp fragment from the mRNA encoding the transcription factor X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) by an unconventional splicing event that generates XBP1s, a potent inducer of a subset of UPR target genes (Calfon et al., 2002Calfon M.

XBP1s is required for ER expansion (Shaffer et al., 2004Shaffer A.L. Shapiro-Shelef M. Iwakoshi N.N. Lee A.H. Qian S.B. Zhao H. Yu X. Yang L. Tan B.K.

Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) additionally express IRE1β, whose deletion results in increased ER stress and exacerbated dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) -induced colitis (Bertolotti et al., 2001Bertolotti A. Wang X. Novoa I. Jungreis R. Schlessinger K. Cho J.H. West A.B. Ron D. Increased sensitivity to dextran sodium sulfate colitis in IRE1β-deficient mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that a stressful environmental milieu in cells with high secretory activity might induce inflammation. If so, inducing ER stress in vivo by cell-specific Xbp1 deletion might lead to organ-specific inflammation, providing a mechanistic explanation for the initiation of proinflammatory diseases. We focused on intestinal epithelium, which contains four highly secretory epithelial cell lineages that are exposed to high concentrations of exogenous antigens: absorptive epithelium, goblet, Paneth, and enteroendocrine cells that are derived from a common, constantly renewing intestinal epithelial stem cell (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5.Nature. 2007; 449: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar). We show that induction of ER stress in intestinal epithelium through tissue- (and cell type-) specific disruption of Xbp1 results in spontaneous enteritis due to inability of Xbp1-deficient IECs to properly generate antimicrobial activity and respond appropriately to inflammatory signals in the local milieu. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the XBP1 gene locus on chromosome 22q12.1 confer risk for both types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), establishing the ER stress pathway as a common genetic contributor to IBD in the human population. We provide herein a comprehensive in vivo framework for the manner in which hypomorphic variants of a novel IBD-susceptibility gene (XBP1) links ER stress within the epithelium to spontaneous intestinal inflammation. Xbp1flox/flox mice were generated by targeting loxP sites to introns flanking exon 2, and bred onto Villin (V) -Cre transgenic mice (see Figures S1A–S1C available online), that directs Cre recombinase activity specifically to small and large intestinal epithelium (Madison et al., 2002Madison B.B. Dunbar L. Qiao X.T. Braunstein K. Braunstein E. Gumucio D.L. Cis elements of the villin gene control expression in restricted domains of the vertical (crypt) and horizontal (duodenum, cecum) axes of the intestine.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33275-33283Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Xbp1flox/floxVCre (Xbp1−/−) offspring were born at a Mendelian ratio and developed normally. Xbp1 exon 2 was efficiently and functionally deleted specifically within the intestinal epithelium (99% in small intestine, 87 ± 4% in colon) (Figures 1A, S1D, and S1E). Elevated basal grp78 levels in Xbp1−/− small intestinal epithelia indicated increased ER stress (Figure 1B) that was confirmed by microarray analysis showing both increased grp78 (Haspa5) and Chop (Ddit3) (P = 0.02) (Table S1; Figure S2A). Spontaneous small intestinal mucosal inflammation, in association with increased ER stress, occurred in 19/31 (61%) adult Xbp1−/− but not in (0/20) Xbp1+/+ mice (χ2 P = 9.87 × 10−6; Figure 1C). Notably, 5/16 (31%) heterozygous Xbp1flox/wtVCre “Xbp1+/−” mice displayed mild spontaneous small intestinal inflammation (χ2P = 0.007; Figure S2B). The inflammatory changes were patchy and ranged in severity from lamina propria polymorphonuclear infiltrates to crypt abscesses and frank ulcerations without granulomas (Figures 1C and S2B). Xbp1−/− intestine was completely devoid of Paneth cells (Figures 1D and 1E), compared to Xbp1+/+ and Xbp1+/− mice (Figures 1E and S2B). Paneth cell granules store lysozyme and proforms of cryptdins, which were barely detectable in Xbp1−/− crypts (Figure 1D), and electron microscopy (EM) confirmed few rudimentary electron-dense granules of minute size and a compressed ER in Xbp1−/− Paneth cells (Figure 1D). mRNA expression of cryptdins-1, -4, and -5 and lysozyme, but not cathelicidin, were substantially reduced (Figure 1A). We also noted reduced numbers and size of goblet cells within the small intestine but not colon with reduced secretory granules by EM and reduced mRNA for the goblet cell protein MUC2 in Xbp1−/− small intestinal epithelia (Figures 1A, 1E, 1F, and S2C). Enteroendocrine cells were unaffected (Figures 1G and S2D) and the epithelial barrier function of absorptive epithelia was normal (Figure 1H). Thus, Xbp1−/− mice exhibited a major defect in Paneth cells and a minor defect in goblet cells in the small intestine with an unperturbed epithelial barrier. Quantitative PCR (qPCR; β-catenin, Tcf4, Math1, Hes1; Figure S3A), microarray analysis (Table S1), and β-catenin distribution (Figure S3B) of Xbp1−/− and Xbp1+/+ intestinal epithelium did not reveal significant alterations in factors involved in intestinal epithelial cell fate decisions (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5.Nature. 2007; 449: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the highly secretory Paneth cell might undergo programmed cell death from failure to manage ER stress as observed in pancreatic acinar cells (Lee et al., 2005Lee A.H. Chu G.C. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. XBP-1 is required for biogenesis of cellular secretory machinery of exocrine glands.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4368-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Indeed, a few pyknotic, apoptotic cells were detected in Xbp1−/− crypts (antiactive caspase-3+ and TUNEL+; Figures 2A and S4A). To circumvent the problems associated with detecting a low-frequency event (apoptosis) in a slowly replenishing cell population, we generated Xbp1floxneo/floxneoVillinCre-ERT2 mice (Figure S1A). Along with efficient deletion of Xbp1 after initiation of tamoxifen treatment (Figure 2B), Paneth cell numbers were reduced by 98% on day 7, paralleled by a similar decrease in cryptdin-5 mRNA transcripts. Apoptotic epithelial nuclei (Figures 2C and S4B) were observed after 2.7 days, peaked at day 5, and declined on day 7 (Figure 2D). Apoptotic cells were present at the base of crypts (Paneth cells), and in villous epithelium (goblet cells) (Figure 2C). We observed a gradual increase of TNFα and Chop (Ddit3) mRNA (Figures 2B and 2E), similar to Xbp1−/− mice (Table S1; Figure S2A). We noted small intestinal inflammation in individual Xbp1floxneo/floxneoVillinCre-ERT2 mice at all time points analyzed (2.7, 5, and 7 days); focal enteritis was present in 4 of 9 mice at day 5 (44%) ranging from lamina propria polymorphonuclear infiltrates to crypt abscesses and frank ulcerations (Figure 2F, upper two panels), despite only minor reductions in Paneth cells (Figure 2F, lower panel). Cumulatively, at all time points examined, we observed enteritis in 7/18 (39%) Xbp1floxneo/floxneoVillinCre-ERT2 and 0/7 controls after induction with tamoxifen. The small intestinal epithelium exhibited villus shortening with a reduction of the villus:crypt ratio (Figure 2G), indicative of a regenerative response in Xbp1−/− mice. A 1 hr pulse of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeled the proliferative pool of intestinal stem cells, and was similar in Xbp1+/+ and Xbp1−/− mice (Figure 2H). However, 24 hr after BrdU injection, labeled cells were detected higher up in the crypt-villus axis in Xbp1−/− mice, indicating an increased migration rate (Figure 2H). Thus, XBP1 affects IEC homeostasis both through controlling cell renewal and cell death. Xbp1−/− small intestinal lysates and supernatants lacked detectable lysozyme in response to carbamyl choline (CCh) (Figure 3A) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (not shown), and LPS-elicited Xbp1−/− crypt supernatants lacked bactericidal killing activity (Figure 3B). Oral infection with Listeria monocytogenes, a Gram-positive intracellular pathogen that is affected by Paneth cell defects (Kobayashi et al., 2005Kobayashi K.S. Chamaillard M. Ogura Y. Henegariu O. Inohara N. Nunez G. Flavell R.A. Nod2-dependent regulation of innate and adaptive immunity in the intestinal tract.Science. 2005; 307: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar), revealed that 10 hr after infection, 100-fold higher numbers of colony forming units (c.f.u.) of L. monocytogenes were recoverable from feces of Xbp1−/− compared to Xbp1+/+ mice (Figure 3C). Translocation into liver and spleen after 72 hr revealed a 10-fold higher number of L. monocytogenes recovered from Xbp1−/− livers, but similar numbers from spleen (Figure 3D). These data suggest that XBP1 in Paneth cells is required to decrease the luminal burden of L. monocytogenes. XBP1 mRNA splicing is a marker of IRE1 activation and ER stress (Calfon et al., 2002Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. IRE1 couples endoplasmic reticulum load to secretory capacity by processing the XBP-1 mRNA.Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar, Lin et al., 2007Lin J.H. Li H. Yasumura D. Cohen H.R. Zhang C. Panning B. Shokat K.M. Lavail M.M. Walter P. IRE1 signaling affects cell fate during the unfolded protein response.Science. 2007; 318: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Virtually complete splicing of mutant XBP1 mRNAs in Xbp1−/− small and large intestine and partial splicing in Xbp1+/− small intestine was observed in contrast to barely detectable splicing in Xbp1+/+ mice (Figure 4A), indicating IRE1 hyperactivation. JNK phosphorylation was increased in Xbp1−/− small intestinal epithelia compared to controls, consistent with the described TRAF2-dependent function of IRE1 to activate JNK (Urano et al., 2000Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Coupling of stress in the ER to activation of JNK protein kinases by transmembrane protein kinase IRE1.Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar) (Figure 4B). To test whether XBP1-mediated intestinal inflammation arose from increased JNK activity in a microbiota- and cytokine-free system, we silenced XBP1 expression in the mouse IEC line MODE-K with an siRNA retrovirus (iXBP) and used flagellin and TNFα as proinflammatory stimulants (Lodes et al., 2004Lodes M.J. Cong Y. Elson C.O. Mohamath R. Landers C.J. Targan S.R. Fort M. Hershberg R.M. Bacterial flagellin is a dominant antigen in Crohn disease.J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1296-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). TNFα and flagellin increased JNK phosphorylation and CXCL1 production from MODE-K.iXBP (50%–90% reduction of XBP1) compared to MODE-K.Ctrl cells (Figures 4C–4E) that was dose-dependently and specifically (Figures S5A and S5B) blocked by the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (Figures 4F and 4G), but did not affect CD1d-restricted MODE-K antigen presenting function (van de Wal et al., 2003van de Wal Y. Corazza N. Allez M. Mayer L.F. Iijima H. Ryan M. Cornwall S. Kaiserlian D. Hershberg R. Koezuka Y. et al.Delineation of a CD1d-restricted antigen presentation pathway associated with human and mouse intestinal epithelial cells.Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 1420-1431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Figure 4H). We conclude that impaired XBP1 expression directly heightens proinflammatory JNK/SAPK signaling in IECs in response to environmental stimuli and may contribute to Paneth, goblet cell, and MODE-K.iXBP apoptosis (Figures 2A, 2C, 2D, S6A, and S6B). The Xbp1−/− colon, unlike the small intestine, did not exhibit spontaneous colitis, but colonic IECs displayed evidence of increased ER stress (Figure 4A). We therefore examined the in vivo effects of DSS, a toxin for mucosal epithelial cells that disrupts barrier function (Strober et al., 2002Strober W. Fuss I.J. Blumberg R.S. The immunology of mucosal models of inflammation.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 495-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Xbp1−/− mice given 4.5% DSS in drinking water exhibited more severe wasting and rectal bleeding than Xbp1+/+ littermates (Figures 5A and 5B). Histologically, Xbp1−/− colons displayed increased areas of mucosal erosions, edema, and cellular infiltration along with increased crypt loss compared to Xbp1+/+ littermates (Figures 5C and 5D). Xbp1+/− mice exhibited an intermediate phenotype (Figures 5A–5C). Antibiotic treatment abrogated the differences in severity of DSS colitis between Xbp1+/+ and Xbp1−/− mice (Figures S7A and S7B), highlighting the importance of the commensal flora in the colitis observed (Figures 5A–5D). Levels of TNFα, a central mediator of inflammation in DSS colitis (Kojouharoff et al., 1997Kojouharoff G. Hans W. Obermeier F. Mannel D.N. Andus T. Scholmerich J. Gross V. Falk W. Neutralization of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) but not of IL-1 reduces inflammation in chronic dextran sulphate sodium-induced colitis in mice.Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 107: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), were elevated in DSS-treated Xbp1−/− versus Xbp1+/+ colonic tissues with intermediate TNFα expression in Xbp1+/− mice (Figure 5E). We analyzed UPR activation in the intestine of healthy individuals and CD and UC patients in ileal and colonic biopsies. grp78 expression was increased in inflamed ileal CD mucosa and XBP1s levels were increased in both inflamed and noninflamed ileal CD biopsies (Figure 5F). Similarly, XBP1s levels in inflamed and noninflamed colonic CD and UC mucosa were increased compared to those from healthy individuals, and there was a trend toward increased grp78 expression in inflamed UC and CD specimens (Figure 5G). These data indicate the presence of ER stress and increased IRE1 activity in the ileum and colon of CD and UC patients. Three previously reported genome-wide linkage studies independently suggested linkage of the 22q12 region with IBD (Hampe et al., 1999Hampe J. Schreiber S. Shaw S.H. Lau K.F. Bridger S.

We examined a German patient cohort of 1103 controls and 550 CD and 539 UC patients (panel 1), genotyping for 20 tagging SNPs (average SNP distance, 5.25 kb; Figures S8A–S8E), selected from HapMap data of individuals of European ancestry using de Bakker's algorithm as implemented in Haploview (Barrett et al., 2005Barrett J.C.

https://openalex.org/W2078571865,"Calcium-dependent chloride channels are required for normal electrolyte and fluid secretion, olfactory perception, and neuronal and smooth muscle excitability. The molecular identity of these membrane proteins is still unclear. Treatment of bronchial epithelial cells with interleukin-4 (IL-4) causes increased calcium-dependent chloride channel activity, presumably by regulating expression of the corresponding genes. We performed a global gene expression analysis to identify membrane proteins that are regulated by IL-4. Transfection of epithelial cells with specific small interfering RNA against each of these proteins shows that TMEM16A, a member of a family of putative plasma membrane proteins with unknown function, is associated with calcium-dependent chloride current, as measured with halide-sensitive fluorescent proteins, short-circuit current, and patch-clamp techniques. Our results indicate that TMEM16A is an intrinsic constituent of the calcium-dependent chloride channel. Identification of a previously unknown family of membrane proteins associated with chloride channel function will improve our understanding of chloride transport physiopathology and allow for the development of pharmacological tools useful for basic research and drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2172122397,"A long-standing conjecture in neuroscience is that aspects of cognition depend on the brain's ability to self-generate sequential neuronal activity. We found that reliably and continually changing cell assemblies in the rat hippocampus appeared not only during spatial navigation but also in the absence of changing environmental or body-derived inputs. During the delay period of a memory task, each moment in time was characterized by the activity of a particular assembly of neurons. Identical initial conditions triggered a similar assembly sequence, whereas different conditions gave rise to different sequences, thereby predicting behavioral choices, including errors. Such sequences were not formed in control (nonmemory) tasks. We hypothesize that neuronal representations, evolved for encoding distance in spatial navigation, also support episodic recall and the planning of action sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2023464499,"On the basis of climate modeling and analogies with past conditions, the potential for multimeter increases in sea level by the end of the 21st century has been proposed. We consider glaciological conditions required for large sea-level rise to occur by 2100 and conclude that increases in excess of 2 meters are physically untenable. We find that a total sea-level rise of about 2 meters by 2100 could occur under physically possible glaciological conditions but only if all variables are quickly accelerated to extremely high limits. More plausible but still accelerated conditions lead to total sea-level rise by 2100 of about 0.8 meter. These roughly constrained scenarios provide a “most likely” starting point for refinements in sea-level forecasts that include ice flow dynamics."

https://openalex.org/W1965635970,"A direct measurement of the universe's expansion history could be made by observing in real time the evolution of the cosmological redshift of distant objects. However, this would require measurements of Doppler velocity drifts of ∼1 centimeter per second per year, and astronomical spectrographs have not yet been calibrated to this tolerance. We demonstrated the first use of a laser frequency comb for wavelength calibration of an astronomical telescope. Even with a simple analysis, absolute calibration is achieved with an equivalent Doppler precision of ∼9 meters per second at ∼1.5 micrometers—beyond state-of-the-art accuracy. We show that tracking complex, time-varying systematic effects in the spectrograph and detector system is a particular advantage of laser frequency comb calibration. This technique promises an effective means for modeling and removal of such systematic effects to the accuracy required by future experiments to see direct evidence of the universe's putative acceleration."

https://openalex.org/W2054474037,"Mammalian fatty acid synthase is a large multienzyme that catalyzes all steps of fatty acid synthesis. We have determined its crystal structure at 3.2 angstrom resolution covering five catalytic domains, whereas the flexibly tethered terminal acyl carrier protein and thioesterase domains remain unresolved. The structure reveals a complex architecture of alternating linkers and enzymatic domains. Substrate shuttling is facilitated by flexible tethering of the acyl carrier protein domain and by the limited contact between the condensing and modifying portions of the multienzyme, which are mainly connected by linkers rather than direct interaction. The structure identifies two additional nonenzymatic domains: (i) a pseudo-ketoreductase and (ii) a peripheral pseudo-methyltransferase that is probably a remnant of an ancestral methyltransferase domain maintained in some related polyketide synthases. The structural comparison of mammalian fatty acid synthase with modular polyketide synthases shows how their segmental construction allows the variation of domain composition to achieve diverse product synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1973669054,"The emergence of memory, a trace of things past, into human consciousness is one of the greatest mysteries of the human mind. Whereas the neuronal basis of recognition memory can be probed experimentally in human and nonhuman primates, the study of free recall requires that the mind declare the occurrence of a recalled memory (an event intrinsic to the organism and invisible to an observer). Here, we report the activity of single neurons in the human hippocampus and surrounding areas when subjects first view cinematic episodes consisting of audiovisual sequences and again later when they freely recall these episodes. A subset of these neurons exhibited selective firing, which often persisted throughout and following specific episodes for as long as 12 seconds. Verbal reports of memories of these specific episodes at the time of free recall were preceded by selective reactivation of the same hippocampal and entorhinal cortex neurons. We suggest that this reactivation is an internally generated neuronal correlate for the subjective experience of spontaneous emergence of human recollection."

https://openalex.org/W1977063334,"Maintenance methylation of hemimethylated CpG dinucleotides at DNA replication forks is the key to faithful mitotic inheritance of genomic methylation patterns. UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like, containing PHD and RING finger domains 1) is required for maintenance methylation by interacting with DNA nucleotide methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), the maintenance methyltransferase, and with hemimethylated CpG, the substrate for DNMT1 (refs 1 and 2). Here we present the crystal structure of the SET and RING-associated (SRA) domain of mouse UHRF1 in complex with DNA containing a hemimethylated CpG site. The DNA is contacted in both the major and minor grooves by two loops that penetrate into the middle of the DNA helix. The 5-methylcytosine has flipped completely out of the DNA helix and is positioned in a binding pocket with planar stacking contacts, Watson-Crick polar hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions specific for 5-methylcytosine. Hence, UHRF1 contains a previously unknown DNA-binding module and is the first example of a non-enzymatic, sequence-specific DNA-binding protein domain to use the base flipping mechanism to interact with DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2092011356,"Loss-of-function diseases are often caused by a mutation in a protein traversing the secretory pathway that compromises the normal balance between protein folding, trafficking, and degradation. We demonstrate that the innate cellular protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, capacity can be enhanced to fold mutated enzymes that would otherwise misfold and be degraded, using small molecule proteostasis regulators. Two proteostasis regulators are reported that alter the composition of the proteostasis network in the endoplasmic reticulum through the unfolded protein response, increasing the mutant folded protein concentration that can engage the trafficking machinery, restoring function to two nonhomologous mutant enzymes associated with distinct lysosomal storage diseases. Coapplication of a pharmacologic chaperone and a proteostasis regulator exhibits synergy because of the former's ability to further increase the concentration of trafficking-competent mutant folded enzymes. It may be possible to ameliorate loss-of-function diseases by using proteostasis regulators alone or in combination with a pharmacologic chaperone."
https://openalex.org/W2105896832,"Changes in gene regulation are thought to have contributed to the evolution of human development. However, in vivo evidence for uniquely human developmental regulatory function has remained elusive. In transgenic mice, a conserved noncoding sequence ( HACNS1 ) that evolved extremely rapidly in humans acted as an enhancer of gene expression that has gained a strong limb expression domain relative to the orthologous elements from chimpanzee and rhesus macaque. This gain of function was consistent across two developmental stages in the mouse and included the presumptive anterior wrist and proximal thumb. In vivo analyses with synthetic enhancers, in which human-specific substitutions were introduced into the chimpanzee enhancer sequence or reverted in the human enhancer to the ancestral state, indicated that 13 substitutions clustered in an 81–base pair module otherwise highly constrained among terrestrial vertebrates were sufficient to confer the human-specific limb expression domain."
https://openalex.org/W1980793772,"oskar mRNA localization to the posterior of the Drosophila oocyte defines where the abdomen and germ cells form in the embryo. Although this localization requires microtubules and the plus end-directed motor, kinesin, its mechanism is controversial and has been proposed to involve active transport to the posterior, diffusion and trapping, or exclusion from the anterior and lateral cortex. By following oskar mRNA particles in living oocytes, we show that the mRNA is actively transported along microtubules in all directions, with a slight bias toward the posterior. This bias is sufficient to localize the mRNA and is reversed in mago, barentsz, and Tropomyosin II mutants, which mislocalize the mRNA anteriorly. Since almost all transport is mediated by kinesin, oskar mRNA localizes by a biased random walk along a weakly polarized cytoskeleton. We also show that each component of the oskar mRNA complex plays a distinct role in particle formation and transport. oskar mRNA localization to the posterior of the Drosophila oocyte defines where the abdomen and germ cells form in the embryo.

We also show that each component of the oskar mRNA complex plays a distinct role in particle formation and transport. mRNA localization is a common mechanism for targeting proteins to specific regions of a cell and plays an important role in axis formation in many organisms, where localized mRNAs function as cytoplasmic determinants. This has been extensively studied in Drosophila, where both main body axes are defined by the localization of bicoid, oskar (osk), and gurken mRNAs to distinct regions of the oocyte (Bashirullah et al., 1998Bashirullah A.

The Drosophila egg chamber consists of a syncytium of 15 nurse cells that are connected by ring canals to the oocyte. osk mRNAs are transcribed in the nurse cells and must first be transported into the oocyte. This localization depends on the activity of BicD and Egalitarian, which are thought to couple the mRNA to dynein, which moves the mRNAs toward the minus ends of microtubules in the oocyte (Bullock and Ish-Horowicz, 2001Bullock S.

A Dynein-dependent shortcut rapidly delivers axis determination transcripts into the Drosophila oocyte.Development. 2007; 134: 1955-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The localization of osk mRNA within the oocyte is also microtubule dependent and is disrupted by treatments with microtubule depolymerizing drugs (Clark et al., 1994Clark I. Giniger E. Ruohola-Baker H. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Transient posterior localization of a kinesin fusion protein reflects anteroposterior polarity of the Drosophila oocyte.Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 289-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Microtubule stainings or live imaging of microtubule-associated proteins reveal that the oocyte contains an anterior-posterior gradient of microtubules during the stages when osk mRNA is localized, in which most microtubules are nucleated from the anterior and lateral cortex. In addition, a fusion between the plus end-directed motor, kinesin, and β-galactosidase accumulates at the oocyte posterior, suggesting that plus ends are enriched at this pole (Clark et al., 1994Clark I. Giniger E. Ruohola-Baker H. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Transient posterior localization of a kinesin fusion protein reflects anteroposterior polarity of the Drosophila oocyte.Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 289-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, it has been argued that the Kinβgal fusion protein localizes to the posterior by hitchhiking since microtubules cannot be detected at the oocyte posterior (Cha et al., 2002Cha B.J. Serbus L.R. Koppetsch B.S. Theurkauf W.E. Kinesin I-dependent cortical exclusion restricts pole plasm to the oocyte posterior.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 592-598PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the organization of the microtubules in the oocyte is still controversial, and it is unclear how the microtubule network directs osk mRNA to the posterior. Several mutants disrupt osk mRNA localization within the oocyte without affecting the cytoskeleton and are good candidates for mutants in essential trans-acting factors. These include three factors (HRP48, the exon junction complex [EJC], and Staufen) that colocalize with osk mRNA both before and after its localization and whose posterior localization is osk mRNA dependent, strongly suggesting that they are essential components of the osk mRNA localization complex. Null mutants in the hnRNPA/B protein, HRP48, are cell lethal, but three point mutations lead to a uniform distribution of osk mRNA in the oocyte (Huynh et al., 2004Huynh J.R. Munro T.P. Smith-Litiere K. Lepesant J.A. Johnston D.S. The Drosophila hnRNPA/B homolog, Hrp48, is specifically required for a distinct step in osk mRNA localization.Dev.

Mutants in the EJC components, Mago nashi, Y14, eIF4AIII, and Barentsz, lead to the mislocalization of the mRNA to the anterior of the oocyte (Hachet and Ephrussi, 2001Hachet O. Ephrussi A.

The EJC is recruited to mRNAs during splicing and marks where exons have been removed. Consistent with this, the first intron of osk is necessary for its posterior localization (Hachet and Ephrussi, 2004Hachet O. Ephrussi A. Splicing of oskar RNA in the nucleus is coupled to its cytoplasmic localization.Nature. 2004; 428: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Mutants in the dsRNA-binding protein, Staufen (Stau), cause a similar accumulation of osk mRNA at the anterior of the oocyte to EJC mutants, but a small amount of RNA is always localized to the posterior at stage 9 (Ephrussi et al., 1991Ephrussi A.

A translation-independent role of oskar RNA in early Drosophila oogenesis.Development. 2006; 133: 2827-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). As well as these RNA-binding proteins, Tropomyosin II (TmII) and the Kinesin heavy chain (Khc) are also required for osk mRNA localization. A P-element allele of TmII leads to the mislocalization of osk mRNA to the anterior (Erdelyi et al., 1995Erdelyi M. Michon A.M. Guichet A. Glotzer J.B. Ephrussi A. Requirement for Drosophila cytoplasmic tropomyosin in oskar mRNA localization.Nature. 1995; 377: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Tropomyosin stabilizes F-actin and modulates its interaction with other actin-binding proteins, but there is no other evidence for a direct role of actin in osk mRNA localization, and Tropomyosin does not colocalize with osk mRNA. Null alleles of the Khc cause a different phenotype, in which osk RNA localizes around the anterior and lateral cortex (Brendza et al., 2000Brendza R. Serbus L. Duffy J. Saxton W. A function for kinesin I in the posterior transport of oskar mRNA and Staufen protein.Science. 2000; 289: 2120-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, Cha et al., 2002Cha B.J. Serbus L.R. Koppetsch B.S. Theurkauf W.E. Kinesin I-dependent cortical exclusion restricts pole plasm to the oocyte posterior.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 592-598PubMed Google Scholar). Kinesin is enriched at the oocyte posterior at stage 9, although this localization is not osk mRNA dependent, unlike the RNA-binding proteins mentioned above (Palacios and St Johnston, 2002Palacios I.M. St Johnston D. Kinesin light chain-independent function of the Kinesin heavy chain in cytoplasmic streaming and posterior localisation in the Drosophila oocyte.Development. 2002; 129: 5473-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The role of the Khc suggests a simple model for osk mRNA localization, in which this plus end-directed motor is linked to the mRNA by HRP48, the EJC, and Stau and transports the mRNA along microtubules to the posterior pole. It is not known, however, if kinesin associates with the osk mRNA localization complex directly, and the motor is also required for the cytoplasmic flows in the oocyte cytoplasm and for the posterior localization of dynein (Brendza et al., 2002Brendza R.

Kinesin light chain-independent function of the Kinesin heavy chain in cytoplasmic streaming and posterior localisation in the Drosophila oocyte.Development. 2002; 129: 5473-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, the requirement for kinesin in osk mRNA localization may be indirect. Glotzer et al. have proposed an alternative model for osk mRNA localization, in which the RNA diffuses throughout the oocyte cytoplasm and is selectively captured at the posterior by a prelocalized anchor (Glotzer et al., 1997Glotzer J.B. Saffrich R. Glotzer M. Ephrussi A. Cytoplasmic flows localize injected oskar RNA in Drosophila oocytes.Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 326-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This model is based on the observation that injected osk mRNA accumulates at the posterior of late-stage oocytes without showing any directed movement toward the posterior pole. Instead, the RNA is washed around the oocyte by the cytoplasmic flows at these stages. Both the strong cytoplasmic flows in late oocytes and the weaker “seething” movements at stage 9 depend on kinesin (Serbus et al., 2005Serbus L.R. Cha B.J. Theurkauf W.E. Saxton W.M. Dynein and the actin cytoskeleton control kinesin-driven cytoplasmic streaming in Drosophila oocytes.Development. 2005; 132: 3743-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The motor might therefore play an indirect role in osk mRNA localization by generating flows that facilitate its diffusion, thereby ensuring its efficient delivery to a posterior anchor. Cha et al. have proposed a third model in which kinesin transports osk mRNA away from all regions of the cortex except the posterior (Cha et al., 2002Cha B.J. Serbus L.R. Koppetsch B.S. Theurkauf W.E. Kinesin I-dependent cortical exclusion restricts pole plasm to the oocyte posterior.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 592-598PubMed Google Scholar). This cortical exclusion model is based on the observation that the mRNA accumulates in the center of the oocyte at stage 8 but is found all round the cortex in Khc germline clones. According to the model, osk mRNA localization is driven by the lack of microtubules emanating from the posterior cortex, thereby preventing kinesin from removing the RNA from this region. Both the central accumulation of osk mRNA at stage 8 and its posterior localization at stage 9 are delayed in Khc hypomorphs that reduce the speed of the motor without affecting its other properties (Serbus et al., 2005Serbus L.R. Cha B.J. Theurkauf W.E. Saxton W.M. Dynein and the actin cytoskeleton control kinesin-driven cytoplasmic streaming in Drosophila oocytes.Development. 2005; 132: 3743-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This has led to the proposal that kinesin is required for both steps in osk mRNA localization: it first transports the mRNA to the center of the oocyte and then facilitates its targeting to the posterior, perhaps by directed transport along a specific subset of microtubules or by catalyzing random movements that are somehow biased toward the posterior. One way to distinguish between the models for osk mRNA localization is to observe its movement in living oocytes. The most common approach for visualizing mRNA localization has been injection of fluorescently labeled transcripts (Cha et al., 2001Cha B. Koppetsch B. Theurkauf W.

This technique cannot be used for osk mRNA, however, because splicing of the first intron is required for its localization. An alternative approach is to fuse GFP to an RNA-binding protein that associates with the mRNA of interest, and ZBP-1-GFP and Exu-GFP have been used in this way to track β-actin and bcd mRNA movements (Oleynikov and Singer, 2003Oleynikov Y.

In vivo analyses of cytoplasmic transport and cytoskeletal organization during Drosophila oogenesis: characterization of a multi-step anterior localization pathway.Development. 1998; 125: 3655-3666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One caveat with this method is that most RNA-binding proteins bind to more than one mRNA, making it important to demonstrate that the tagged RNA-binding protein only associates with the appropriate transcript. An elegant way to solve this problem is to target GFP to the mRNA by inserting binding sites for the MS2 phage coat protein into the mRNA and coexpressing an MS2-GFP fusion protein that also includes a nuclear localization signal (Bertrand et al., 1998Bertrand E.

Cell. 1998; 2: 437-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Since MS2 does not bind any endogenous RNAs in Drosophila, the fusion protein is targeted to the nucleus unless it binds to the MS2-binding sites in the transcript of interest and is exported with the RNA into the cytoplasm. This method has been used successfully to study Ash1 mRNA localization in yeast (Beach et al., 1999Beach D. Salmon E. Bloom K. Localization and anchoring of mRNA in budding yeast.Curr.

Localization of bicoid mRNA in late oocytes is maintained by continual active transport.Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Here we report the use of two labeling strategies to image the dynamics of osk mRNP particles in living oocytes. Our analysis of their movements rules out all of the proposed mechanisms for osk mRNA localization and leads us to propose a revised model for how the mRNA is transported to the posterior of the oocyte. We have previously tried to visualize osk mRNA by following the movement of a GFP-tagged version of Stau that colocalizes with the mRNA throughout oogenesis and fully rescues the osk mRNA localization defects of stau null mutants (Figures 1A–1C) (Palacios and St Johnston, 2002Palacios I.M. St Johnston D. Kinesin light chain-independent function of the Kinesin heavy chain in cytoplasmic streaming and posterior localisation in the Drosophila oocyte.Development. 2002; 129: 5473-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although we observed large GFP-Stau granules in the oocyte cytoplasm by confocal microscopy, the velocity of these granules never exceeded the speed of cytoplasmic flows (0.1 μm/s), and the granules always moved in the same direction as other organelles in the surrounding cytoplasm. Furthermore, these large granules only form when the protein is overexpressed and cannot be detected by antibody staining of endogenous Stau. This suggested that the large granules are aggregates of overexpressed GFP-Stau, and that the particles containing osk mRNA are too faint or too fast to visualize using standard imaging systems. To overcome this limitation, we imaged oocytes expressing GFP-Stau at high magnification with much faster frame rates (2–4 frames/s) using a sensitive wide-field deconvolution microscope (Figure 1E). This revealed the existence of a population of very small and faint Stau particles throughout the oocyte cytoplasm, which often underwent fast, directed movements at speeds of up to 1 μm/s, consistent with active transport (Figures 1I and 1J; Movie S1 available online). Furthermore, GFP-Stau particles often followed each other along the same track, suggesting that they were moving along the same microtubule or actin filament (Movie S2). Surprisingly, these movements occurred in all directions. In contrast to these fast movements, many particles moved only slowly along irregular paths (>0.1 μm/s), suggesting that they were being carried by the slow cytoplasmic flows and undergoing Brownian motion (Figure 1H and data not shown). The lack of a clear bias in the direction of GFP-Stau particle movements was unexpected given the models for osk mRNA localization and raised the question of whether all of the particles contain osk mRNA. Stau associates with other transcripts at other stages of development, and it is therefore possible that some of the particles in the stage 9 oocyte represent Stau complexed with another mRNA, or free Stau aggregates (St Johnston, 2005St Johnston D. Moving messages: the intracellular localization of mRNAs.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 363-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). We therefore used the MS2 system to label osk mRNA directly by generating an osk genomic rescuing construct in which 10 MS2-binding sites were inserted immediately after the osk stop codon. When this transgene is crossed to flies expressing MS2-nls-GFP, the MS2-GFP-labeled oskMS2 mRNA accumulates at the posterior of the oocyte in an identical pattern to endogenous osk mRNA (Figure 1D). oskMS2 rescues the early oogenesis defect of an osk mRNA null mutant and still localizes normally to the posterior of the oocyte at stage 9 in the absence of endogenous osk, confirming that the introduction of MS2-binding sites does not disrupt its localization signal (Figure S1A). Unlike GFP-Stau, oskMS2 RNA does not form large cytoplasmic aggregates, confirming that the latter are probably an overexpression artifact. When visualized at high magnification in living oocytes, oskMS2 mRNA labeled small particles throughout the oocyte cytoplasm, which showed fast movements in all directions similar to those of the small GFP-Stau particles (Movies S3 and S4). Indeed, we could detect even more moving particles of oskMS2 mRNA, presumably because this labeling system introduces up to 20 GFPs per osk mRNA and is therefore more sensitive than the single GFP attached to Stau. Nevertheless, it appears that most if not all small Stau particles contain osk mRNA since RFP-Stau particles were also labeled by oskMS2/MS2-GFP, and alternate imaging of the red and green channels revealed that the two labels move in concert on the same particle (Figures 1G and 1G′; Movie S5). Thus, GFP-Stau is a reliable marker for osk mRNA particles, suggesting that the protein does not associate with other RNAs to form particles at stage 9 of oogenesis. Injection of the microtubule-destabilizing drug, colcemid, into the oocyte abolished almost all fast, directed movements of the particles, which instead underwent random Brownian oscillations (Movie S6). Feeding flies with colcemid caused a similar cessation of the movement of the GFP-Stau particles and abolished their accumulation at the posterior pole (Figure S2A). The fast movements of the GFP-Stau particles resumed after the colcemid was inactivated with a short UV-pulse, and the fusion protein showed a visible accumulation at the posterior pole within 50 min (Figures S2B and S2C and Movie S7). Neither feeding, immersion of the ovaries, nor direct injection of Latrunculin A into the oocyte stopped the motility of GFP-Stau and oskMS2 particles (Movie S8). Thus, most, if not all, of the fast particle movements are microtubule rather than actin dependent. The results above indicate that osk mRNA particles are transported along microtubules, strongly suggesting that these movements represent the microtubule-dependent step in its posterior localization. However, the behavior of the particles does not correspond to the predictions of the main models for the localization of the mRNA. The movement of the particles in all directions rules out the model in which kinesin transports osk mRNA along a highly polarized microtubule cytoskeleton to the posterior. Two aspects of our results also argue against the cortical exclusion model. First, osk mRNP particles frequently undergo fast, directed movements to the posterior pole (for example, Figure 1L), indicating that they are not simply transported away from the anterior and lateral cortex. Second, the osk mRNP particles show a similar frequency of fast microtubule-dependent movements close to the posterior pole as they do in other areas of the oocyte, indicating that a significant number of microtubules extend into this region. Finally, the active transport of the particles suggests that the mRNA does not localize by passive diffusion and anchoring. However, random fast movements could facilitate the diffusion of the mRNA throughout the oocyte so that it can be efficiently captured by a posterior anchor. To determine whether there are any anterior-posterior biases in the behavior of osk mRNP particles that might contribute to their delivery to the posterior, we analyzed the particle movements in more detail. We first determined the proportion of particles undergoing active transport at any moment by tracking all moving and “nonmoving” particles in several oocytes. Most particles move along irregular paths at the same speed as the yolk granules in the surrounding cytoplasm (≤0.1 μm/s), indicating that they are being carried by the Khc-dependent slow seething of the cytoplasm. However, in any given 5 s period, 13.4% of the oskMS2 particles (91/689 particles, 7 movies) and 13.1% of the GFP-Stau particles (178/1111, 6 movies) move in a directed and processive manner at speeds that are indicative of active transport (See Figures 1E–1L). Because we needed to image as quickly as possible to detect the moving particles, we could only collect data in a single focal plane and could therefore follow only a segment of the trajectory of most fast-moving particles. Nevertheless, both GFP-Stau and oskMS2 particles showed similar average track lengths (2.4 and 2.8 μm, respectively), and the longest in focus movements were over 10 μm, indicating that the transport is processive. There were no significant differences between the track lengths of particles moving toward the anterior and those moving toward the posterior (Table S1). Both GFP-Stau and oskMS2/MS2-GFP particles also moved with very similar average velocities toward the anterior or posterior of the oocyte (Table S1). In both cases, however, particles in the anterior half of the oocyte moved with a higher averag"

Binding of p97 to substrates is mediated by cofactors that contain ubiquitin-binding domains. We employed “network proteomics” to show that p97 assembles with all of the 13 mammalian UBX-domain proteins. The UBX proteins that bind ubiquitin conjugates also interact with dozens of E3 ubiquitin ligases, only one of which had been previously linked to p97. In particular, UBXD7 links p97 to the ubiquitin ligase CUL2/VHL and its substrate hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α). Depletion of p97 leads to accumulation of endogenous HIF1α and increased expression of a HIF1α target gene. The large number of ubiquitin ligases found associated with UBX proteins suggests that p97 plays a far broader role than previously anticipated in the global regulation of protein turnover. p97 is an ATP-dependent chaperone that plays an important role in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation but whose connections to turnover of soluble proteins remain sparse.

The large number of ubiquitin ligases found associated with UBX proteins suggests that p97 plays a far broader role than previously anticipated in the global regulation of protein turnover. p97, also known as Cdc48 in yeast, is a homohexameric AAA (ATPase associated with a variety of activities) ATPase, highly conserved from archaebacteria to mammals. As one of the most abundant proteins in the cell (Peters et al., 1990Peters J.M. Walsh M.J. Franke W.W. An abundant and ubiquitous homo-oligomeric ring-shaped ATPase particle related to the putative vesicle fusion proteins Sec18p and NSF.EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1757-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), p97/Cdc48 performs a variety of functions ranging from cell-cycle regulation to membrane fusion and protein degradation (Ye, 2006Ye Y. Diverse functions with a common regulator: Ubiquitin takes command of an AAA ATPase.J Struct Biol. 2006; 156: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The role of p97/Cdc48 in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) was first revealed in a genetic screen for mutants defective in the turnover of ubiquitin fusion proteins (the UFD pathway) (Ghislain et al., 1996Ghislain M. Dohmen R.J. Levy F. Varshavsky A. Cdc48p interacts with Ufd3p, a WD repeat protein required for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4884-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, the bulk of subsequent p97 studies have focused on its role in endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Typically, ERAD substrates are misfolded or misassembled proteins, but ER-resident enzymes like HMGR can also be regulated by this system (Doolman et al., 2004Doolman R. Leichner G.S. Avner R.

Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Dislocation from the ER back into the cytosol is a hallmark of ERAD, and p97 provides the driving force for this process (Rouiller et al., 2002Rouiller I. DeLaBarre B. May A.P. Weis W.I. Brunger A.T.

Also at the ER, yeast Cdc48 participates in the activation of the transcription factors Spt23 and Mga2 by dissociating the active subunits from their membrane-bound partners (Rape et al., 2001Rape M.

The most extensively studied p97 binding partners are p47 and the NPL4/UFD1 heterodimer, which form alternative complexes with p97 and direct its activity to different cellular processes. The NPL4/UFD1 adaptor is needed for the function of p97 in UPS-dependent protein degradation, including the ERAD pathway, while p47 enables p97 to participate in homotypic membrane fusion. The yeast p47 ortholog, Shp1, is also involved in proteolytic events (Ye, 2006Ye Y. Diverse functions with a common regulator: Ubiquitin takes command of an AAA ATPase.J Struct Biol. 2006; 156: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Many p97 functions, regardless of whether or not they are associated with proteolysis, involve recognition of ubiquitinated protein substrates. The p97/p47 complex can bind ubiquitinated proteins via the UBA domain in p47, whereas the NPL4/UFD1 heterodimer performs the same function through the NPL4 zinc finger (NZF) domain in NPL4 and the UT3 region in UFD1 (Meyer et al., 2002Meyer H.H.

While p47 and NPL4/UFD1 are substrate-recruiting cofactors, p97 also interacts with a variety of substrate-processing cofactors like the E4 enzyme Ufd2 (Richly et al., 2005Richly H. Rape M. Braun S.

With the exception of Ufd2, all p97 cofactors enumerated above interact with the N-terminal domain of p97. Ufd2 and another yeast Cdc48 cofactor, Ufd3/Doa1, dock onto p97's C terminus (Yeung et al., 2008Yeung H.O. Kloppsteck P. Niwa H. Isaacson R.L. Matthews S. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. Insights into adaptor binding to the AAA protein p97.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Irrespective of its bound cofactors, the underlying function of p97 is believed to be the conversion of the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical force used to disassemble protein complexes or segregate polypeptides from intracellular structures such as the ER membrane. p97 comprises three domains: the N-terminal domain and two ATPase domains (D1, D2). Structural studies revealed that the ATPase domains form two hexameric rings stacked on top of each other with a pore in the center. Multiple conformational changes have been observed in the p97 hexamer during its ATPase cycle, and several models have been proposed to explain how p97 ATPase activity can be translated via the adaptors into tension applied on protein substrates (Pye et al., 2006Pye V.E.

We describe a comparative proteomic study of mammalian UBX domain-containing p97 cofactors. Our experiments unexpectedly revealed a large number of E3 ligases that interact with a subset of UBX-domain proteins. Among these interactions, we found that the UBX-domain protein UBXD7 bound subunits of the CUL2/VHL ubiquitin ligase complex and its substrate, HIF1α. We further show that HIF1α is a novel endogenous substrate of p97 and that UBXD7 mediates its interaction with p97. Our results suggest that the role of p97 in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is far more pervasive than previously envisioned. To further understand the molecular basis for p97's diverse functions, we analyzed p97-Myc immunoprecipitates from human 293 cells by multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) (Link et al., 1999Link A.J. Eng J. Schieltz D.M. Carmack E. Mize G.J. Morris D.R. Garvik B.M. Yates 3rd, J.R. Direct analysis of protein complexes using mass spectrometry.Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar), searching for new p97 cofactors. This analysis revealed eight p97 binding partners (Table 1), all containing a UBX (structurally similar to ubiquitin) domain in their C-terminal regions (Figure 1A). At the time of our analysis, p47 was the only human UBX-domain protein known to interact with p97 (Kondo et al., 1997Kondo H. Rabouille C. Newman R. Levine T.P. Pappin D. Freemont P.

The human proteome includes at least 13 different UBX proteins (Figure 1A), some of which were not identified in our initial analysis. At least three of those, UBXD1 (Carim-Todd et al., 2001Carim-Todd L. Escarceller M. Estivill X. Sumoy L.

Upon expressing their Flag-tagged versions in 293 cells, we confirmed that 11 mammalian UBX domain-containing proteins (five of which were absent in the original p97 immunoprecipitates) coimmunoprecipitated endogenous p97 (Figure 1B). Taken together, our mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation/western analyses confirmed that all 13 mammalian UBX proteins bound p97. This is consistent with the observation that all seven budding yeast UBX proteins bind Cdc48 (Schuberth et al., 2004Schuberth C. Richly H. Rumpf S. Buchberger A. Shp1 and Ubx2 are adaptors of Cdc48 involved in ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation.EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 818-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Given that UBX proteins invariably bind p97/Cdc48, UBX emerges as a signature domain for p97-binding partners across species. Based on their domain composition, the human UBX proteins can be divided into two main groups (Figure 1A). The first group includes the UBA-UBX proteins (UBXD7, UBXD8, FAF1, SAKS1, and p47), characterized by the presence of an ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain at their N termini. The UBA domain binds ubiquitin (Hurley et al., 2006Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Ubiquitin-binding domains.Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) and, consistent with that, we found that Flag-tagged UBA-UBX proteins coimmunoprecipitated endogenous ubiquitin conjugates (Figure 1C). The amount of ubiquitinated proteins present in UBA-UBX protein immunoprecipitates was amplified by proteasome inhibition with MG132 (Figure 2A), suggesting that at least some of them are UPS substrates. The second group includes the UBX-only proteins, which lack the UBA domain (Figure 1A) and the ability to bind ubiquitinated substrates (Figure 1C). To establish what type of ubiquitin chains are recognized by mammalian UBA-UBX proteins, we searched our mass spectrometry data for ubiquitin tryptic peptides bearing GG signatures (Parker et al., 2005Parker C.E. Mocanu V. Warren M.R. Greer S.F. Borchers C.H. Mass spectrometric determination of protein ubiquitination.Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 301: 153-173PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple spectra corresponding to ubiquitin peptides carrying a GG signature at K48 were identified, as expected for proteins targeted for proteasomal degradation (Pickart, 1997Pickart C.M. Targeting of substrates to the 26S proteasome.FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). However, it came as a surprise that a higher number of peptides carried GG signatures attached to K11. The detection of GG signature peptides by mass spectrometry is most efficient for K48 and less effective for K11 (Kirkpatrick et al., 2006Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J. Finley D. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Quantitative analysis of in vitro ubiquitinated cyclin B1 reveals complex chain topology.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), suggesting that the actual ratio of K11- to K48-linked chains could be even higher than indicated by the spectrum counts shown in Figure 3A. While a more detailed analysis will be required to unambiguously establish ubiquitin chain specificity, it is interesting to note that K11-linked chains were detected in immunoprecipitates of all UBA-UBX proteins. Because the biological functions for most UBX proteins are largely unknown (Schuberth and Buchberger, 2008Schuberth C. Buchberger A. UBX domain proteins: Major regulators of the AAA ATPase Cdc48.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2360-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), we performed a comparative MudPIT analysis of Flag-UBX protein immunoprecipitates from transiently transfected 293 cells. The resulting data sets were mined to identify interacting partners that are shared among multiple UBX protein complexes, as well as partners that are specific to a certain UBX protein. We first focused our attention on known components of the p97 network. NPL4/UFD1 and p47 use a similar bipartite mechanism for binding the N-terminal domain of p97 and compete for p97 binding in vitro (Bruderer et al., 2004Bruderer R.M. Brasseur C. Meyer H.H. The AAA ATPase p97/VCP interacts with its alternative co-factors, Ufd1-Npl4 and p47, through a common bipartite binding mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49609-49616Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, Meyer et al., 2000Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J. Pappin D. Warren G. A complex of mammalian ufd1 and npl4 links the AAA-ATPase, p97, to ubiquitin and nuclear transport pathways.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2181-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). This led to the hypothesis that the interaction of NPL4/UFD1 and UBX proteins with p97 might be mutually exclusive. However, the bipartite p97-binding motif seems to be conserved only in SEP-UBX proteins like p47 (Bruderer et al., 2004Bruderer R.M. Brasseur C. Meyer H.H. The AAA ATPase p97/VCP interacts with its alternative co-factors, Ufd1-Npl4 and p47, through a common bipartite binding mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49609-49616Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and p37 (Uchiyama et al., 2006Uchiyama K. Totsukawa G. Puhka M. Kaneko Y. Jokitalo E. Dreveny I. Beuron F. Zhang X. Freemont P. Kondo H. p37 is a p97 adaptor required for Golgi and ER biogenesis in interphase and at the end of mitosis.Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 803-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), leaving open the possibility that other UBX-domain proteins use a different binding mode. We confirmed, both by mass spectrometry (Table S1 available online) and by immunoblotting of Flag-p47 immunoprecipitates (Figures 1D and 2A), that, for the most part, p47 does not form complexes with NPL4/UFD1. That seems to be an exception rather than the rule, as the other UBA-UBX proteins coimmunoprecipitated NPL4 and UFD1. Conversely, Flag-NPL4 coimmunoprecipitated UBA-UBX proteins, with most peptides identified for the UBA-UAS-UBX proteins UBXD8, UBXD7, and FAF1 (data not shown). Similarly, the yeast UBA-UBX protein Ubx2 assembles into a Cdc48/Npl4/Ufd1/Ubx2 complex (Schuberth and Buchberger, 2005Schuberth C. Buchberger A. Membrane-bound Ubx2 recruits Cdc48 to ubiquitin ligases and their substrates to ensure efficient ER-associated protein degradation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We also compared the ability of UBX proteins to interact with substrate-processing cofactors of p97. VCIP135 seems to interact preferentially with SEP-UBX proteins like p47 and UBXD5 (Table S1). Indeed, two SEP-UBX proteins, p37 and p47, both require VCIP135 for their function (Uchiyama et al., 2006Uchiyama K. Totsukawa G. Puhka M. Kaneko Y. Jokitalo E. Dreveny I. Beuron F. Zhang X.

Cell. 2006; 11: 803-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). PLAP, known as Ufd3/Doa1 in budding yeast, has a strong preference for coassembling with SAKS1 (Figure 1D). Intriguingly, even though yeast Npl4/Ufd1 and Ufd3 bind to distinct regions of Cdc48 (Rumpf and Jentsch, 2006Rumpf S. Jentsch S. Functional division of substrate processing cofactors of the ubiquitin-selective Cdc48 chaperone.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), in our analysis, the complexes that are richest in NPL4/UFD1 are poorest in PLAP and vice versa (Figure 1D and Table S1). With the exception of a few peptides identified in SAKS1 and p47 immunoprecipitates, UBE4B, the human ortholog of yeast Ufd2, was largely absent from our UBA-UBX protein and p97 immunoprecipitates (Table S2). It has been proposed that yeast Cdc48 functions in series with other targeting factors like Rad23 to mediate processing of ubiquitin conjugates and their eventual presentation to the proteasome (Medicherla et al., 2004Medicherla B. Kostova Z. Schaefer A. Wolf D.H. A genomic screen identifies Dsk2p and Rad23p as essential components of ER-associated degradation.EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, Richly et al., 2005Richly H. Rape M. Braun S. Rumpf S. Hoege C. Jentsch S. A series of ubiquitin binding factors connects CDC48/p97 to substrate multiubiquitylation and proteasomal targeting.Cell. 2005; 120: 73-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Although this model contemplates the formation of ternary complexes, we found that RAD23 and ubiquilins were largely absent from our UBX protein and p97 immunoprecipitates. However, we did identify multiple proteasome subunits, most frequently the proteasome base subunits PSMC3, PSMC4, and PSMD1 (data not shown), which made us speculate that, in human cells, p97-substrate complexes might directly dock onto the proteasome base without another targeting factor acting as an intermediary. Notably, there was little crossinteraction between different UBX proteins (data not shown), suggesting that they form homomeric complexes with p97. A striking observation from the comparative MudPIT analysis of Flag-tagged UBA-UBX protein immunoprecipitates was their ability to interact with numerous E3 ligases as indicated qualitatively in Figure 3B. We identified multiple components of cullin-RING E3 ligase (CRL) complexes but also single subunit RING- and HECT-domain E3s. Of these 38 ubiquitin ligases, more than a third were also identified in p97 immunoprecipitates (marked by footnote “a” in Table S2), confirming that they belong to the p97 network. Individual UBA-UBX proteins did not exhibit strict specificity for particular E3 ligases, but at least some E3s seemed to be enriched in certain UBA-UBX protein immunoprecipitates (Figure 3C). Most notably, UBXD7 showed a remarkable ability to coimmunoprecipitate CUL2. Moreover, we also identified RBX1, elongin B, elongin C, and VHL in UBXD7 immunoprecipitates. In general, UBXD7 was the UBA-UBX protein that showed the most extensive interaction with CRL subunits (Figures 2B and 3C). An UBXD7 mutant lacking the UBX domain lost the ability to interact not only with p97 but also with ubiquitinated substrates (Figure 2C). Despite that, truncated UBXD7 largely retained its capacity to bind CUL1 and CUL2. In contrast, a p47 mutant lacking the C-terminal region could still pull down ubiquitinated proteins but did not exhibit significant binding of cullins. This lack of correlation between ubiquitin and E3 binding, together with semiquantitative analysis of the MudPIT data (Figure 3C), suggests that the interaction between UBA-UBX proteins and E3 ligases is specific and not simply mediated by the ubiquitinated substrate binding to the UBA domain. p97 cofactors like p47 and NPL4/UFD1 mediate the interaction between p97 and its ubiquitinated targets (Ye, 2006Ye Y. Diverse functions with a common regulator: Ubiquitin takes command of an AAA ATPase.J Struct Biol. 2006; 156: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). By MudPIT analysis of individual UBX-protein immunoprecipitates, we sought to identify p97 targets specific for these cofactors and thereby unravel which p97 functions they regulate. Therefore, we were intrigued to identify eight distinct HIF1α peptides in Flag-UBXD7 immunoprecipitates from cells in which the proteasome activity was inhibited with MG132 (Figure 4A). HIF1, a heterodimeric transcription factor that consists of HIF1α and HIF1β subunits, regulates transcription in response to changes in O2 concentration. O2-dependent degradation of HIF1α is mediated by prolyl-hydroxylase, the CUL2/VHL ubiquitin ligase, and the proteasome (Ivan and Kaelin, 2001Ivan M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to pursue HIF1α as a potential p97/UBXD7 substrate. Among the UBA-UBX proteins, UBXD7 was by far the most efficient in coimmunoprecipitating endogenous HIF1α, which was detected as an ubiquitinated ladder using anti-HIF1α antibodies (Figure 4B). HIF1α is scarce in normoxia (Huang et al., 1996Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. Activation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor depends primarily upon redox-sensitive stabilization of its alpha subunit.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar); hence, the interaction between UBXD7 and HIF1α was only detectable after MG132 treatment, which causes accumulation of ubiquitinated HIF1α. We confirmed the specificity of the HIF1α antibodies by comparing the signal in total-cell extracts from cells treated or not with HIF1α siRNA, both in the presence and absence of MG132 (Figure 4C). This indicated the presence of a crossreacting band that partially overlaps with full-length HIF1α, marked with asterisks in all the panels showing HIF1α in total-cell extracts. The crossreacting band was absent from immunoprecipitates (Figure 4D). Proteasome inhibition also caused accumulation of HIF1α partial degradation products (Figure 4C) that migrated faster than expected for the full-length protein (92.7 kDa), some of which also coimmunoprecipitated with UBXD7 (Figure 4B). We next tested whether the interaction between UBXD7 and HIF1α depends on p97. Depletion of p97 by siRNA did not alter significantly the interaction of UBXD7 with HIF1α or cullins, but it drastically reduced the association of UBXD7 with NPL4 and UFD1 (Figure 4D). Therefore, we conclude that UBXD7 interaction with the substrate and E3s does not depend on p97/NPL4/UFD1. To validate that the interaction of UBXD7 with HIF1α occurs within the p97 network, we showed that p97 itself coimmunoprecipitated endogenous HIF1α (Figure 5A). Interestingly, the HIF1α that immunoprecipitated with p97 was more extensively polyubiquitinated than the pool bound to UBXD7 (compare Figures 5A and 5B with Figures 4B and 4D). The accumulation of ubiquitinated HIF1α in p97 immunoprecipitates after proteasome inhibition correlated with increased amounts of endogenous UBXD7 bound to p97 (Figure 5A), suggesting that UBXD7 binding to p97 might depend on the availability of substrate. Further support for this idea came from gel filtration experiments of HeLa cell extracts in which all proteins were expressed endogenously (Figure 5C). We observed two fractionation peaks for endogenous UBXD7, only one of which overlapped with p97. In contrast, NPL4 and UFD1 fractionation closely resembled p97. This fractionation pattern indicated that the default state for NPL4/UFD1 was p97 bound, whereas only a fraction of UBXD7 was p97 bound, possibly in response to a stimulus such as interaction with a substrate. Indeed, the accumulation of ubiquitinated substrates upon proteasome inhibition by MG132 resulted in a shift of UBXD7 toward p97-positive fractions (Figure S1A), a phenomenon that was reverted upon p97 depletion (Figure S1B). If the substrate-ligase complex binds UBXD7, which in turn binds p97, HIF1α association with p97 should depend on UBXD7. Indeed, the ability of p97 to coimmunoprecipitate endogenous HIF1α-ubiquitin conjugates was lost in cells treated with UBXD7 siRNA (Figure 5B). In contrast, UBXD7 depletion had no significant effect on NPL4, UFD1, or polyubiquitin binding to p97. While CUL1 binding to p97 was also unaffected by UBXD7 depletion, we observed a significant reduction of CUL2 binding (Figure 5B), consistent with UBXD7 being the best CUL2 binder among UBA-UBX proteins (Figure 2B). This suggests that the UBA-UBX adaptor mediates p97 interaction with the substrate and the corresponding E3 ligase. The endogenous"
https://openalex.org/W2041982728,"Binding of the HIV envelope to the chemokine coreceptors triggers membrane fusion and signal transduction. The fusion process has been well characterized, yet the role of coreceptor signaling remains elusive. Here, we describe a critical function of the chemokine coreceptor signaling in facilitating HIV infection of resting CD4 T cells. We find that static cortical actin in resting T cells represents a restriction and that HIV utilizes the Gαi-dependent signaling from the chemokine coreceptor CXCR4 to activate a cellular actin-depolymerizing factor, cofilin, to overcome this restriction. HIV envelope-mediated cofilin activation and actin dynamics are important for a postentry process that leads to viral nuclear localization. Inhibition of HIV-mediated actin rearrangement markedly diminishes viral latent infection of resting T cells. Conversely, induction of active cofilin greatly facilitates it. These findings shed light on viral exploitation of cellular machinery in resting T cells, where chemokine receptor signaling becomes obligatory."

The prevailing view is that the resultant chimeric transcripts and proteins are abnormal, tumor-specific products that provide tumor cells with a growth and/or survival advantage. We show that normal endometrial stromal cells contain a specific chimeric RNA joining 5′ exons of the JAZF1 gene on chromosome 7p15 to 3′ exons of the Polycomb group gene JJAZ1/SUZ12 on chromosome 17q11 and that this RNA is translated into JAZF1-JJAZ1, a protein with anti-apoptotic activity. The JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA appears to arise from physiologically regulated trans-splicing between precursor messenger RNAs for JAZF1 and JJAZ1 . The chimeric RNA and protein are identical to those produced from a gene fusion found in human endometrial stromal tumors. These observations suggest that certain gene fusions may be pro-neoplastic owing to constitutive expression of chimeric gene products normally generated by trans-splicing of RNAs in developing tissues."

Metagenomics creates experimental, computational, and conceptual connections between the too-often artificially separated worlds of environmental and medical microbiology. For example, although our development occurs in the apparently microbe-free environment of the uterus, beginning at birth we are colonized by members of all three known domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. As adults, the number of microbial cells associated with our adult human bodies likely exceeds the number of our somatic and germ cells by 10-fold. Studies of model organisms suggest that acquisition of this microbiota (Box 1) reflects a combination of legacy effects (a summation of the microbes we are exposed to in our distinctively experienced living environments) and habitat effects (largely ill-defined “filters” that operate to select microbes for residency in our different body sites) (Rawls et al., 2006Rawls J.F. Mahowald M.A. Ley R.E. Gordon J.I. Cell. 2006; 127: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). In many ways, we should view ourselves, and all other animals, as “supraorganisms,” composed of mixtures of host and microbial cells, genes, and metabolic attributes. Defining the gene content of our microbiota (the “microbiome”) represents a first step in exploring the largely mysterious biotransformations that are supported by its constituents. The metabolome—the metabolites generated by one or more organisms under a particular set of physiological/environmental conditions (Box 1)—holds the key to moving beyond descriptions of the composition of our indigenous microbial communities (that is, their component organisms, genes, transcripts, and proteins). The metabolome will enable a better understanding of the dynamic operations of our indigenous microbial communities and their functional contributions to the various body habitats that they occupy. These contributions include metabolic activities that are not encoded in our human genome, for example, the breakdown of otherwise difficult to digest plant glycans, synthesis of vitamins, and the processing of various xenobiotics that we consume (either intentionally or unintentionally). The skeptical reader may suppose that metagenomics is currently just a limited set of evolving DNA-centric experimental and computational techniques, driven in large part by the introduction of massively parallel sequencers that, unlike capillary machines, do not require subcloning of DNA fragments prior to sequencing. Our retort is a “yes but”…there are at least three reasons why data generated by the sequencing of microbial community DNA, including 16S rRNA genes, will be necessary to understand microbial metabolism and therefore community function. First, only a small fraction of microbial diversity in the biosphere can be isolated in pure culture, presumably because of the highly artificial and limited number of conditions used currently for cultivation. This problem has been called the “great plate-count anomaly” and refers to the fact that the number of organisms cultured from a community is typically far less than the number observed using culture-independent methods such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing (e.g., Huber et al., 2007Huber J.A. Welch D.B. Morrison H.G. Huse S.M. Neal P.R. Butterfield D.A. Sogin M.L. Science. 2007; 318: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, Roesch et al., 2007Roesch L.F.W. Fulthorpe R.R. Riva A. Casella G. Hadwin A.K.M. Kent A.D. Daroub S.H. Camargo F.A.O. Farmerie W.G. Triplett E.W. The ISME Journal. 2007; 1: 283-290PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, culture-based approaches do not scale as readily as culture-independent techniques: for example, a single massively parallel pyrosequencer can generate more than 2 million sequencing reads from 16S rRNA genes each day—a number well beyond the range of our current capacity for culturing microorganisms. Second, multiple representatives of the same “species” (commonly defined as organisms that share ≥97% nucleotide sequence identity between their 16S rRNA genes) can have a surprising amount of variability in their proteomes. For example, comparisons of 32 Escherichia coli and Shigella genomes (Willenbrock et al., 2007Willenbrock H. Hallin P.F. Wassenaar T.M. Ussery D.W. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R267Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and an analysis of six strains of Streptococcus agalactiae (Tettelin et al., 2005Tettelin H. Masignani V. Cieslewicz M.J. Donati C. Medini D. Ward N.L. Angiuoli S.V. Crabtree J. Jones A.L. Durkin A.S. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 13950-13955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar) disclosed a large set of seemingly “dispensable” genes found in subsets of the genomes from each “species.” Such observations indicate that a future definition of species will be gleaned from analyses of the functions encoded by the shared (core) set of genes present in a larger “pan-genome” that represents the sum of all genes found in all isolates of a 16S rRNA-defined species-level phylotype (Box 1). The bottom line is that the total number of genome variants in a community is likely to greatly exceed the number of 16S rRNA-based phylotypes. Metagenomic sequencing of total community DNA offers a rapid and efficient way of addressing these issues whether or not the microbes can be cultured. Third, most microbial metabolic processes in nature occur in the context of communities, not pure cultures. There are clearly many advantages to exploring the niche (professions) of organisms in pure cultures, including the opportunity for controlled experimentation. However, metagenomics represents a conceptual framework for analyzing microbial metabolism at a higher level of organization than that of a single organism. Metagenomic studies of microbial communities are revealing how many emergent properties become apparent in the context of a complex system that could not be easily deduced from an analysis limited to its individual components. For example, the global distribution of the dominant Cyanobacteria, Prochlorococcus, in large regions of the world's oceans could be inferred through computational analyses of a model marine ecosystem seeded with diverse phytoplankton having randomly assigned physiological characteristics (Follows et al., 2007Follows M.J. Dutkiewicz S. Grant S. Chisholm S.W. Science. 2007; 315: 1843-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Metagenomics has already proven useful in going from DNA sequence data to understanding the metabolism of relatively “simple” microbial communities. An excellent example is the shotgun sequencing of DNA isolated from a low-complexity microbial biofilm community that forms in the acidic water, rich in pyrite (FeS2), that drains from an abandoned mine in Iron Mountain, California (Tyson et al., 2004Tyson G.W. Chapman J. Hugenholtz P. Allen E.E. Ram R.J. Richardson P.M. Solovyev V.V. Rubin E.M. Rokhsar D.S. Banfield J.F. Nature. 2004; 428: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). This approach allowed the genomes of two previously uncultured organisms, Leptospirillum group II and Ferroplasma type II, to be assembled into a relatively small number of contigs. The deep sequence coverage achieved was used to surmise that the Ferroplasma type II genome was actually a composite of three ancestral strains that have undergone extensive homologous recombination, producing a population of mosaic genomes. The Leptospirillum group II and the less abundant group III genomes encode key enzymes in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle for carbon fixation (type II ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase). The Ferroplasma type II genome assembly contains multiple ABC-type sugar and amino acid transporters indicative of a heterotrophic lifestyle in which organic matter is used for energy (Tyson et al., 2004Tyson G.W. Chapman J. Hugenholtz P. Allen E.E. Ram R.J. Richardson P.M. Solovyev V.V. Rubin E.M. Rokhsar D.S. Banfield J.F. Nature. 2004; 428: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Leptospirillum group III genome assembly has a single nitrogen fixation operon (nif), suggesting a role for these low abundance bacteria as the primary nitrogen fixers in the acid mine community. These in silico predictions were subsequently validated experimentally (Tyson et al., 2005Tyson G.W. Lo I. Baker B.J. Allen E.E. Hugenholtz P. Banfield J.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 6319-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Another example is the shotgun sequencing of DNA prepared from two relatively low-complexity communities that had been seeded in the laboratory from a man-made industrial sludge. This sludge has ecological importance because of its capacity for microbe-mediated removal of inorganic phosphate from the environment. The results allowed the genome of the dominant but previously uncultured member, Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis, to be assembled. In silico metabolic reconstructions revealed how the organism may (1) dispose of inorganic phosphate (through import and metabolism to polyphosphate, which is then used to provide energy for importing and storing fatty acids), (2) degrade glycogen (through the Embden-Meyerhof but not the Entner-Doudoroff pathway), and (3) produce NADPH via a novel cytochrome b/b6 (Martin et al., 2006Martin H.G. Ivanova N. Kunin V. Warnecke F. Barry K.W. McHardy A.C. Yeates C. He S. Salamov A.A. Szeto E. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Metagenomic approaches have also been used to investigate the metabolic underpinnings of host-bacterial symbioses in invertebrates. Olavius algarvensis, a marine worm that lacks a mouth, gut, or anus, harbors four known Proteobacterial symbionts below its cuticle (Woyke et al., 2006Woyke T. Teeling H. Ivanova N.N. Huntemann M. Richter M. Gloeckner F.O. Boffelli D. Anderson I.J. Barry K.W. Shapiro H.J. et al.Nature. 2006; 443: 950-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Shotgun sequencing of microbial community DNA, and in silico reconstructions of the metabolic pathways encoded by the microbiome of this gutless worm, revealed that its symbionts—including a sulfate-reducing δ-Proteobacteria and a sulfur-oxidizing chemoautotroph belonging to the γ-Proteobacteria—have important metabolic capabilities. They are able to provide the host with nutrients (amino acids and vitamins) derived from reduced sulfur compounds, hydrogen, CO2, or dissolved organic carbon from the environment, and to remove metabolic end-products generated by the worm (ammonium, urea, and short-chain fatty acids). Likewise, DNA-level metagenomic analysis of the Sharpshooter, a major agricultural pest that feeds on the xylem fluid of plants and acts as a vector for plant pathogens, disclosed that one of its symbionts, the γ-Proteobacteria Baumannia cicadellinicola, has the capacity to provide it with vitamins [thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), panthothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (B6), biotin, and folic acid]. Another one of its symbionts, Sulcia muelleri (a Bacteroidetes), has the capacity to supply the Sharpshooter with amino acids (threonine, leucine, valine, isoleucine and potentially lysine, arginine, and tryptophan) (Wu et al., 2006Wu D. Daugherty S.C. Van Aken S.E. Pai G.H. Watkins K.L. Khouri H. Tallon L.J. Zaborsky J.M. Dunbar H.E. Tran P.L. et al.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e188https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040188Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). A recent study of obligate γ-Proteobacterial symbionts that live in the posterior midgut of the stinkbug demonstrated that pest behavior (fitness on crop legumes) is dependent on this microbe. When symbiont strains, with 99.9% identical 16S rRNA gene sequences, are experimentally exchanged between a stinkbug pest species (Megacopta punctatissima) and a non-pest species (Megacopta cribraria), the pest phenotype is reversed (Hosokawa et al., 2007Hosokawa T. Kikuchi Y. Shimada M. Fukatsu T. Proc. Biol. Sci. 2007; 274: 1979-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Sequencing of these uncultured symbiont genomes will likely reveal candidate pest-promoting microbial genetic determinants. Metagenomics has also identified distinguishing metabolic features of very complex microbial communities, including those associated with an agricultural soil, sunken whale carcasses (whale falls), and the ocean (Tringe et al., 2005Tringe S.G. von Mering C. Kobayashi A. Salamov A.A. Chen K. Chang H.W. Podar M. Short J.M. Mathur E.J. Detter J.C. et al.Science. 2005; 308: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Comparisons of the soil and Sargasso Sea microbiomes showed an enrichment (significantly higher relative abundance) of genes involved in degradation of plant material in the soil (e.g., predicted genes encoding cellobiose phosphorylase) and enrichment for light-driven proton pumps (bacteriorhodopsins) in the Sargasso Sea (Tringe et al., 2005Tringe S.G. von Mering C. Kobayashi A. Salamov A.A. Chen K. Chang H.W. Podar M. Short J.M. Mathur E.J. Detter J.C. et al.Science. 2005; 308: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ocean is composed of stratified microbial assemblages: studies of microbiome gene content at multiple depths (10 m–4000 m) identified differences in the relative abundance of specific categories of genes. The more productive photic zone community has a higher relative abundance of photosynthesis genes than the deep water community, a lower representation of genes indicative of lateral gene transfer (transposases), and a higher relative abundance of cyanophage (DeLong et al., 2006DeLong E.F. Preston C.M. Mincer T. Rich V. Hallam S.J. Frigaard N.U. Martinez A. Sullivan M.B. Edwards R. Brito B.R. et al.Science. 2006; 311: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Metagenomic studies of complex communities are also linking microbiomes to mechanisms underlying biomass conversion in a variety of biological bioreactors, including the mouse and human intestine (Turnbaugh et al., 2006Turnbaugh P.J. Ley R.E. Mahowald M.A. Magrini V. Mardis E.R. Gordon J.I. Nature. 2006; 444: 1027-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (6931) Google Scholar, Turnbaugh et al., 2008Turnbaugh P.J. Bäckhed F. Fulton L.

Oshima K. Toh H. Toyoda A. Takami H. Morita H. Sharma V.K. Srivastava T.P. et al.DNA Res. 2007; 14: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Surveys of 16S rRNA sequences present in the distal gut microbiota of lean and obese mice and humans revealed an association between adiposity and the relative proportions of the two dominant bacterial divisions in these mammalian ecosystems—the Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes (Ley et al., 2006Ley R.E. Turnbaugh P.J. Klein S. Gordon J.I. Nature. 2006; 444: 1022-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (5257) Google Scholar). Sequencing DNA isolated from the distal intestines of genetically obese (ob/ob) mice and their lean (ob/+, +/+) littermates disclosed a significant enrichment for genes in the ob/ob gut microbiome that are involved in harvesting energy from polysaccharides. These in silico metabolic predictions were supported by biochemical analyses, and by microbiome transplantation experiments. The latter involved transfer of unfractionated distal gut microbial communities from ob/ob and lean (+/+) donors to wild-type germ-free mouse recipients. The obese mouse gut community produced a significantly greater increase in adiposity in recipients over a 2 week period (Turnbaugh et al., 2006Turnbaugh P.J. Ley R.E. Mahowald M.A. Magrini V. Mardis E.R. Gordon J.I. Nature. 2006; 444: 1027-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (6931) Google Scholar). Follow-up studies of a mouse model of diet-induced obesity caused by consumption of a high-fat, high-sugar “Western” diet revealed that obesity was associated with marked but reversible structural and functional changes in the gut microbiome. In particular, there was a bloom in a single uncultured clade of bacteria within the Mollicutes class of the Firmicutes division and an increased ability of this community to promote adiposity in germ-free recipients compared to recipients of a microbiota harvested from lean mice consuming a standard chow diet. Metagenomic sequencing of the gut microbiome, biochemical assays, plus sequencing, and in silico metabolic reconstructions of a related human gut-associated Mollicute (Eubacterium dolichum) revealed features that may provide a competitive advantage for members of the bloom in the Western diet nutrient milieu, including genes involved in import and metabolism of simple sugars (Turnbaugh et al., 2008Turnbaugh P.J. Bäckhed F. Fulton L. Gordon J.I. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 3: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). An initial analysis of the fecal microbiomes of two unrelated humans (Gill et al., 2006Gill S.R. Pop M. DeBoy R.T. Eckburg P.B. Turnbaugh P.J. Samuel B.S. Gordon J.I. Relman D.A. Fraser-Liggett C.M. Nelson K.E. Science. 2006; 312: 1355-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2888) Google Scholar) showed that compared to all previously sequenced microbial genomes and the human genome, the human gut microbiome is enriched for genes involved in a number of metabolic pathways. These genes include those for (1) 2-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway-mediated biosynthesis of essential vitamins (e.g., thiamine and pyridoxine) and isoprenoids (derivatives of isopentenyl pyrophosphate), (2) the metabolism of amino acids, xenobiotics (including carcinogens), and dietary polysaccharides, and (3) methanogenesis. Methanogenesis is a key metabolic pathway, present in members of the Euryarchaeota division of Archaea, that removes the H2 end-product of bacterial fermentation of dietary polysaccharides, thereby preventing inhibition of this process. Inhibition occurs because the flux of sugars through the glycolytic pathway leads to accumulation of NADH. Removal of hydrogen by methanogenic Archaea, by phylogenetically diverse acetogens that use the Wood-Ljungdhal pathway for synthesis of acetylCoA from CO2, and/or by Proteobacteria that reduce sulfate to sulfide (a genotoxic compound) allows NADH to be oxidized to NAD+ (Drake et al., 2006Drake H.L. Kusel K. Matthies C. Acetogenic prokaryotes.in: Third Edition. The Prokaryotes. Volume 2. Springer, New York2006: 354-420Google Scholar). These metagenomic analyses were subsequently extended to the fecal microbiomes of 13 healthy humans, including 4 suckling infants, 2 children, and 7 adults (Kurokawa et al., 2007Kurokawa K. Itoh T. Kuwahara T. Oshima K. Toh H. Toyoda A. Takami H. Morita H. Sharma V.K. Srivastava T.P. et al.DNA Res. 2007; 14: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Comparative metagenomics revealed that the infant fecal microbiome is highly variable, consistent with a recent 16S rRNA gene sequence-based study of microbial community assembly in the gut of infants during the first year after birth (Palmer et al., 2007Palmer C. Bik E.M. DiGiulio D.B. Relman D.A. Brown P.O. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e177https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). In silico functional analyses of the adult human fecal microbiome versus previously sequenced microbial genomes confirmed that it is enriched for genes involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, including a number of polysaccharide-degrading glycoside hydrolases. Additionally, the human gut microbiome contains many conjugative transposon sequences, emphasizing the potential role of lateral gene transfer in shaping gut genomes (Kurokawa et al., 2007Kurokawa K. Itoh T. Kuwahara T. Oshima K. Toh H. Toyoda A. Takami H. Morita H. Sharma V.K. Srivastava T.P. et al.DNA Res. 2007; 14: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). One notion that can be abstracted from these studies of mammalian gut microbiomes is that the nutrient/energetic value of food is a relative, not an absolute term that can be influenced by metabolic activities encoded in the microbiome. In turn, our food choices may become imprinted into our supraorganismal metabolome in part by affecting the structure and activity of the gut microbiota (Rezzi et al., 2007Rezzi S. Ramadan Z. Martin F.P. Fay L.B. Bladeren P.V. Lindon J.C. Nicholson J.K. Kochhar S. J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 4469-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar; also see the Forum by Holmes et al., page 714 of this issue). This metabolic imprinting could be initiated at an early stage of life. It follows that metagenomic studies should allow us to obtain a deeper understanding of the nutritional needs of humans. The results could yield microbiome-based biomarkers for identifying those at risk for obesity or malnutrition, dietary recommendations based on the nutrient-processing capacities of the gut microbiota of various human populations, and a new understanding about why certain prevention strategies and therapeutic interventions fail in some but succeed in others (Prentice et al., 2008Prentice A.M. Gershwin M.E. Schaible U.E. Keusch G.T. Victora C.G. Gordon J.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 1322-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). An issue facing the marriage of metagenomics and metabolomics relates to the global dispersal of microbes. Some have proposed that microbes are not geographically isolated, given a generally large population size of each microbial phylotype in the biosphere and presumed minimal barriers to global dispersal. This would mean that in many environments there are members of all or the vast majority of phylotypes, and the habitat (continuously) selects to determine relative abundance. This conceptual framework can be depicted in a rank abundance plot of diversity (Figure 1). In this plot, the highly abundant phylotypes are viewed as responsible for most active growth and carbon and energy flux in a given ecosystem, with the rare phylotypes forming a “seed bank” (a term defined here as a set of organisms present at low abundance that may or may not significantly alter major metabolic fluxes) (Pedros-Alio, 2006Pedros-Alio C. Trends Microbiol. 2006; 14: 257-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar; Box 1). If this formulation were extended to microbiomes, it would suggest that if the vast majority of phylotypes are present in a given environment, then most microbial genes might also be present in that environment. This does not appear to be the case in low-complexity microbial communities (e.g., the acid mine drainage) or in certain host-symbiont relationships (e.g., the Sharpshooter, the gutless worm, and the light organ of the squid Euprymna scolopes, which is colonized by a single dominant bacterium, Vibrio fischeri). However, it may be true for environments with potentially less restricted barriers to colonization, such as the ocean, soil, or even the human alimentary tract (Hooper et al., 2008Hooper S.D. Raes J. Foerstner K.U. Harrington E.D. Dalevi D. Bork P. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2607https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002607Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, given the extent of lateral gene transfer in environments such as the distal human intestine, where microbial densities approach 1012 organisms per milliliter of gut luminal contents (Xu et al., 2007Xu J. Mahowald M.A. Ley R.E. Lozupone C.A. Hamady M. Martens E.C. Henrissat B. Coutinho P.M. Minx P. Latreille P. et al.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e156https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050156Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), plus the results of initial studies of bacterial pan-genomes, it seems likely that a large number of rare genes may be found in members of a wide variety of phylotypes. This point becomes important when considering how microbial communities adjust their metabolic activities to changing environmental conditions, and how to define a “core microbiome.” The core human microbiome has been viewed as whatever is shared in a given body habitat among the vast majority of human microbiomes (e.g., Turnbaugh et al., 2007Turnbaugh P.J. Ley R.E. Hamady M. Fraser-Liggett C. Knight R. Gordon J.I. Nature. 2007; 449: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar). Relative abundance needs to be factored into this definition of a core microbiome: the “gene bank” will likely contain a large number of genes that are present at incredibly low relative abundance in all human-associated communities and are thus extremely difficult to detect (Figure 1A). A more readily defined facet of the core microbiome could be the set of abundant genes that influence major metabolic cycles. The more elusive gene bank would include a vast assortment of rare genes that may not markedly affect carbon, nitrogen, or other nutrient and energy fluxes within a microbial community, and between a microbiota and its host. Nonetheless such a gene bank could contribute other important features to community and host metabotypes, and to the resiliency of a microbial community when its structure is perturbed (Figure 1B). However, many of these rare microbial genes may not encode functions that confer a detectable selective advantage to the host under various circumstances. Human microbiome projects are being launched that will survey microbiomes in a number of body habitats of people of varying ages and genotypes, living in different ecosystems, in societies with varying lifestyles (Turnbaugh et al., 2007Turnbaugh P.J. Ley R.E. Hamady M. Fraser-Liggett C. Knight R. Gordon J.I. Nature. 2007; 449: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar). As these efforts seek to discover connections between our supraorganismal metabolism and our microbial ecology, they will have to address a number of the questions alluded to above. For example, what is the underlying population structure of the microbial communities that occupy our various body habitats at various time points over a life span? What is the provenance of the organismal lineages that comprise these communities: how much vertical transmission is there from our mothers and/or other family members? How much functional redundancy exists between the myriad bacterial strains that comprise our microbiota, and between communities whose diversity has only been described in terms of 16S rRNA-based phylogenies? How can we improve predictions about the metabolic capabilities and activities of a microbial community from metagenomic data? The latter question embraces issues of how to generate more reliable predictions of gene function, how to create better algorithms for identifying protein families and metabolic pathways (Godzik et al., 2007Godzik A. Jambon M. Friedberg I. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 2505-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, Yooseph et al., 2007Yooseph S. Sutton G. Rusch D.B. Halpern A.L. Williamson S.J.

Li W. et al.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e16https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050016Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), and how to integrate metabolite data from NMR and mass spectrometry with DNA, mRNA, and protein data sets. The task of answering these questions is daunting and the outcomes uncertain. We believe that addressing many of these questions will require concomitant metagenomic studies of genetically malleable model host organisms with defined genotypes, raised under germ-free conditions, that are then colonized at varying times during their life with defined consortia of sequenced microbial phylotypes (a “type community” much as there are “type strains”). These gnotobiotic models should allow general principles to be gleaned about the coevolution and interoperability of microbial and host metabolomes, as many of the confounding variables that apply to humans (diet, genotype, environmental exposures) can be constrained. Much will be learned from careful energy and nutrient balance studies of these gnotobiotic animals, from characterization of host and microbial community genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes, and from identifying microbiome-based biomarkers of metabolic activities. This knowledge can then be tested in humans with the goal of achieving more comprehensive phenotyping of our physiology, more accurate definitions of our health, more insightful stratification of our risks for various metabolic disorders, and new ways for intentionally manipulating our microbiomes to optimize their functions in the context of our individual biological milieus.

https://openalex.org/W1967750892,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). A potential new therapeutic approach for MS is cell transplantation which may promote remyelination and suppress the inflammatory process.We transplanted human embryonic stem cells (hESC)-derived early multipotent neural precursors (NPs) into the brain ventricles of mice induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS. We studied the effect of the transplanted NPs on the functional and pathological manifestations of the disease.Transplanted hESC-derived NPs significantly reduced the clinical signs of EAE. Histological examination showed migration of the transplanted NPs to the host white matter, however, differentiation to mature oligodendrocytes and remyelination were negligible. Time course analysis of the evolution and progression of CNS inflammation and tissue injury showed an attenuation of the inflammatory process in transplanted animals, which was correlated with the reduction of both axonal damage and demyelination. Co-culture experiments showed that hESC-derived NPs inhibited the activation and proliferation of lymph node-derived T cells in response to nonspecific polyclonal stimuli.The therapeutic effect of transplantation was not related to graft or host remyelination but was mediated by an immunosuppressive neuroprotective mechanism. The attenuation of EAE by hESC-derived NPs, demonstrated here, may serve as the first step towards further developments of hESC for cell therapy in MS."
https://openalex.org/W2166615973,"The SH2 domain of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases can enhance catalytic activity and substrate recognition, but the molecular mechanisms by which this is achieved are poorly understood. We have solved the structure of the prototypic SH2-kinase unit of the human Fes tyrosine kinase, which appears specialized for positive signaling. In its active conformation, the SH2 domain tightly interacts with the kinase N-terminal lobe and positions the kinase alphaC helix in an active configuration through essential packing and electrostatic interactions. This interaction is stabilized by ligand binding to the SH2 domain. Our data indicate that Fes kinase activation is closely coupled to substrate recognition through cooperative SH2-kinase-substrate interactions. Similarly, we find that the SH2 domain of the active Abl kinase stimulates catalytic activity and substrate phosphorylation through a distinct SH2-kinase interface. Thus, the SH2 and catalytic domains of active Fes and Abl pro-oncogenic kinases form integrated structures essential for effective tyrosine kinase signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2135342003,"The dendritic actin network generated by the Arp2/3 complex in lamellipodia underlies formation of protrusions, directional sensing, and migration. While the generation of this network is well studied, the mechanisms regulating network disassembly are poorly understood. We report that Coronin 1B disassembles Arp2/3-containing actin filament branches by inducing Arp2/3 dissociation. This activity is antagonized by Cortactin, a filament branch stabilizer. Consistent with this biochemical competition, depletion of both proteins partially rescues defects in lamellipodial dynamics observed upon depletion of either protein alone. Coronin 1B targets actin branches in a manner that is mutually exclusive with the Arp2/3 complex and alters the branch angle. We conclude that Coronin 1B replaces the Arp2/3 complex at actin filament branches as the dendritic network matures and drives the turnover of branched actin networks."
https://openalex.org/W2147592498,"The canonical Wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathway is initiated by inducing phosphorylation of one of the Wnt receptors, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), at threonine residue 1479 (Thr1479) and serine residue 1490 (Ser1490). By screening a human kinase small interfering RNA library, we identified phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type II alpha and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase type I (PIP5KI) as required for Wnt3a-induced LRP6 phosphorylation at Ser1490 in mammalian cells and confirmed that these kinases are important for Wnt signaling in Xenopus embryos. Wnt3a stimulates the formation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphates [PtdIns (4,5)P2] through frizzled and dishevelled, the latter of which directly interacted with and activated PIP5KI. In turn, PtdIns (4,5)P2 regulated phosphorylation of LRP6 at Thr1479 and Ser1490. Therefore, our study reveals a signaling mechanism for Wnt to regulate LRP6 phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W2095358223,"Prions are unconventional infectious agents composed exclusively of misfolded prion protein (PrP(Sc)), which transmits the disease by propagating its abnormal conformation to the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)). A key characteristic of prions is their species barrier, by which prions from one species can only infect a limited number of other species. Here, we report the generation of infectious prions by interspecies transmission of PrP(Sc) misfolding by in vitro PMCA amplification. Hamster PrP(C) misfolded by mixing with mouse PrP(Sc) generated unique prions that were infectious to wild-type hamsters, and similar results were obtained in the opposite direction. Successive rounds of PMCA amplification result in adaptation of the in vitro-produced prions, in a process reminiscent of strain stabilization observed upon serial passage in vivo. Our results indicate that PMCA is a valuable tool for the investigation of cross-species transmission and suggest that species barrier and strain generation are determined by the propagation of PrP misfolding."
https://openalex.org/W2132328708,"SNAREs provide the specificity and energy for the fusion of vesicles with their target membrane, but how they are sorted into the appropriate vesicles on post-Golgi trafficking pathways is largely unknown. We demonstrate that the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the SNARE VAMP7 is directly mediated by Hrb, a clathrin adaptor and ArfGAP. Hrb wraps 20 residues of its unstructured C-terminal tail around the folded VAMP7 longin domain, demonstrating that unstructured regions of clathrin adaptors can select cargo. Disrupting this interaction by mutation of the VAMP7 longin domain or depletion of Hrb causes VAMP7 to accumulate on the cell's surface. However, the SNARE helix of VAMP7 binds back onto its longin domain, outcompeting Hrb for binding to the same groove and suggesting that Hrb-mediated endocytosis of VAMP7 occurs only when VAMP7 is incorporated into a cis-SNARE complex. These results elucidate the mechanism of retrieval of a postfusion SNARE complex in clathrin-coated vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1981503145,"Non-image related responses to light, such as the synchronization of circadian rhythms to the day/night cycle, are mediated by classical rod/cone photoreceptors and by a small subset of retinal ganglion cells that are intrinsically photosensitive, expressing the photopigment, melanopsin. This raises the possibility that the melanopsin cells may be serving as a conduit for photic information detected by the rods and/or cones. To test this idea, we developed a specific immunotoxin consisting of an anti-melanopsin antibody conjugated to the ribosome-inactivating protein, saporin. Intravitreal injection of this immunotoxin results in targeted destruction of melanopsin cells. We find that the specific loss of these cells in the adult mouse retina alters the effects of light on circadian rhythms. In particular, the photosensitivity of the circadian system is significantly attenuated. A subset of animals becomes non-responsive to the light/dark cycle, a characteristic previously observed in mice lacking rods, cones, and functional melanopsin cells. Mice lacking melanopsin cells are also unable to show light induced negative masking, a phenomenon known to be mediated by such cells, but both visual cliff and light/dark preference responses are normal. These data suggest that cells containing melanopsin do indeed function as a conduit for rod and/or cone information for certain non-image forming visual responses. Furthermore, we have developed a technique to specifically ablate melanopsin cells in the fully developed adult retina. This approach can be applied to any species subject to the existence of appropriate anti-melanopsin antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2088091992,"Recovery from Friend virus 3 ( Rfv3 ) is a single autosomal gene encoding a resistance trait that influences retroviral neutralizing antibody responses and viremia. Despite extensive research for 30 years, the molecular identity of Rfv3 has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that Rfv3 is encoded by Apobec3. Apobec3 maps to the same chromosome region as Rfv3 and has broad inhibitory activity against retroviruses, including HIV. Not only did genetic inactivation of Apobec3 convert Rfv3 -resistant mice to a susceptible phenotype, but Apobec3 was also found to be naturally disabled by aberrant messenger RNA splicing in Rfv3 -susceptible strains. The link between Apobec3 and neutralizing antibody responses highlights an Apobec3 -dependent mechanism of host protection that might extend to HIV and other human retroviral infections."
https://openalex.org/W2076128933,"To explore mechanisms controlling sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression in human cancers, we investigated regulation of Shh by the transcription factor NF-kappaB. We identify putative NF-kappaB binding sites in the human Shh promoter region that specifically bind NF-kappaB complexes. Further, NF-kappaB activation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or p65 overexpression stimulates Shh promoter activity and p65 binds to Shh promoter in vivo. NF-kappaB-mediated transcriptional activation of Shh is mapped to a minimal NF-kappaB consensus site at position +139 of Shh promoter. NF-kappaB activation results in increased Shh mRNA and protein expression in vitro and, notably, also in vivo in a genetic mouse model of inducible NF-kappaB activity. Specific NF-kappaB inhibition by inhibitory NF-kappaBalpha (Ikappa-Balpha) superrepressor or p65 knockdown inhibits NF-kappaB-induced Shh promoter activation and Shh expression. NF-kappaB-mediated Shh expression promotes proliferation and confers resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Silencing of Shh prevents NF-kappaB-stimulated proliferation, while the addition of Shh rescues the proliferation defect imposed by NF-kappaB inhibition. Notably, NF-kappaB-stimulated tumor growth is significantly impaired by Shh knockdown in an in vivo model of pancreatic cancer. By demonstrating that NF-kappaB regulates Shh expression, which contributes to NF-kappaB-mediated proliferation and apoptosis resistance in vitro and in vivo, our findings have important implications to target aberrant Shh expression in human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2094754279,"It has been established that c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) is essential to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Although JNK influences inflammatory signaling pathways, it remains unclear whether its activity in macrophages contributes to adipose tissue inflammation and ultimately to the regulation of systemic metabolism. To address whether the action of this critical inflammatory kinase in bone marrow-derived elements regulates inflammatory responses in obesity and is sufficient and necessary for the deterioration of insulin sensitivity, we performed bone marrow transplantation studies with wild type and JNK1-deficient mice. These studies illustrated that JNK1-deficiency in the bone marrow-derived elements (BMDE) was insufficient to impact macrophage infiltration or insulin sensitivity despite modest changes in the inflammatory profile of adipose tissue. Only when the parenchymal elements lacked JNK1 could we demonstrate a significant increase in systemic insulin sensitivity. These data indicate that while the JNK1 activity in BMDE is involved in metabolic regulation and adipose milieu, it is epistatic to JNK1 activity in the parenchymal tissue for regulation of metabolic homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2013804083,"Background Recently the vagal output of the central nervous system has been shown to suppress the innate immune defense to pathogens. Here we investigated by anatomical and physiological techniques the communication of the brain with the spleen and provided evidence that the brain has the capacity to stimulate the production of antigen specific antibodies by its parasympathetic autonomic output. Methodology/Principal Findings This conclusion was reached by successively demonstrating that: 1. The spleen receives not only sympathetic input but also parasympathetic input. 2. Intravenous trinitrophenyl-ovalbumin (TNP-OVA) does not activate the brain and does not induce an immune response. 3. Intravenous TNP-OVA with an inducer of inflammation; lipopolysaccharide (LPS), activates the brain and induces TNP-specific IgM. 4. LPS activated neurons are in the same areas of the brain as those that provide parasympathetic autonomic information to the spleen, suggesting a feed back circuit between brain and immune system. Consequently we investigated the interaction of the brain with the spleen and observed that specific parasympathetic denervation but not sympathetic denervation of the spleen eliminates the LPS-induced antibody response to TNP-OVA. Conclusions/Significance These findings not only show that the brain can stimulate antibody production by its autonomic output, it also suggests that the power of LPS as adjuvant to stimulate antibody production may also depend on its capacity to activate the brain. The role of the autonomic nervous system in the stimulation of the adaptive immune response may explain why mood and sleep have an influence on antibody production."
https://openalex.org/W1964632662,"The metabolism of hyaluronan (HA) relies on HA synthases and hyaluronidases, among which hyaluronidase-1 (HYAL1) and -2 (HYAL2) have been proposed as key actors. Congenital HYAL1 deficiency leads to mucopolysaccharidosis IX (MPS IX), a rare lysosomal storage disorder characterized by joint abnormalities. Knowledge of HYAL2 is limited. This protein displays weak in vitro hyaluronidase activity and acts as a receptor for oncogenic ovine retroviruses. We have generated HYAL2-deficient mice through a conditional Cre-lox system. Hyal2(-/-) mice are viable and fertile. They exhibit localized congenital defects in frontonasal and vertebral bone formation and suffer from mild thrombocytopenia and chronic, possibly intravascular, hemolysis. In addition, Hyal2(-/-) mice display 10-fold increases in plasma levels of HA and 2-fold increases in plasma hyaluronidase activity. Globally, there is no HA accumulation in tissues, including bones, but liver sinusoidal cells seem overloaded with undigested HA. Taken together, these elements demonstrate for the first time that murine HYAL2 has a physiological activity in vivo that is relevant for craniovertebral bone formation, maintenance of plasma HA concentrations, and erythrocyte and platelet homeostasis. In addition, the viability of HYAL2-deficient mice raises the possibility that a similar defect, defining a new MPS disorder, exists in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2096285630,"In multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), impairment of glial ""Excitatory Amino Acid Transporters"" (EAATs) together with an excess glutamate-release by invading immune cells causes excitotoxic damage of the central nervous system (CNS). In order to identify pathways to dampen excitotoxic inflammatory CNS damage, we assessed the effects of a beta-lactam antibiotic, ceftriaxone, reported to enhance expression of glial EAAT2, in ""Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein"" (MOG)-induced EAE. Ceftriaxone profoundly ameliorated the clinical course of murine MOG-induced EAE both under preventive and therapeutic regimens. However, ceftriaxone had impact neither on EAAT2 protein expression levels in several brain areas, nor on the radioactive glutamate uptake capacity in a mixed primary glial cell-culture and the glutamate-induced uptake currents in a mammalian cell line mediated by EAAT2. Moreover, the clinical effect of ceftriaxone was preserved in the presence of the EAAT2-specific transport inhibitor, dihydrokainate, while dihydrokainate alone caused an aggravated EAE course. This demonstrates the need for sufficient glial glutamate uptake upon an excitotoxic autoimmune inflammatory challenge of the CNS and a molecular target of ceftriaxone other than the glutamate transporter. Ceftriaxone treatment indirectly hampered T cell proliferation and proinflammatory INFgamma and IL17 secretion through modulation of myelin-antigen presentation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) e.g. dendritic cells (DCs) and reduced T cell migration into the CNS in vivo. Taken together, we demonstrate, that a beta-lactam antibiotic attenuates disease course and severity in a model of autoimmune CNS inflammation. The mechanisms are reduction of T cell activation by modulation of cellular antigen-presentation and impairment of antigen-specific T cell migration into the CNS rather than or modulation of central glutamate homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2094042941,"Self-shielding of carbon monoxide (CO) within the nebular disk has been proposed as the source of isotopically anomalous oxygen in the solar reservoir and the source of meteoritic oxygen isotopic compositions. A series of CO photodissociation experiments at the Advanced Light Source show that vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photodissociation of CO produces large wavelength-dependent isotopic fractionation. An anomalously enriched atomic oxygen reservoir can thus be generated through CO photodissociation without self-shielding. In the presence of optical self-shielding of VUV light, the fractionation associated with CO dissociation dominates over self-shielding. These results indicate the potential role of photochemistry in early solar system formation and may help in the understanding of oxygen isotopic variations in Genesis solar-wind samples."
https://openalex.org/W1982478583,"Background Pica, the craving and subsequent consumption of non-food substances such as earth, charcoal, and raw starch, has been an enigma for more than 2000 years. Currently, there are little available data for testing major hypotheses about pica because of methodological limitations and lack of attention to the problem. Methodology In this paper we critically review procedures and guidelines for interviews and sample collection that are appropriate for a wide variety of pica substances. In addition, we outline methodologies for the physical, mineralogical, and chemical characterization of these substances, with particular focus on geophagic soils and clays. Many of these methods are standard procedures in anthropological, soil, or nutritional sciences, but have rarely or never been applied to the study of pica. Principal Findings Physical properties of geophagic materials including color, particle size distribution, consistency and dispersion/flocculation (coagulation) should be assessed by appropriate methods. Quantitative mineralogical analyses by X-ray diffraction should be made on bulk material as well as on separated clay fractions, and the various clay minerals should be characterized by a variety of supplementary tests. Concentrations of minerals should be determined using X-ray fluorescence for non-food substances and inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy for food-like substances. pH, salt content, cation exchange capacity, organic carbon content and labile forms of iron oxide should also be determined. Finally, analyses relating to biological interactions are recommended, including determination of the bioavailability of nutrients and other bioactive components from pica substances, as well as their detoxification capacities and parasitological profiles. Significance This is the first review of appropriate methodologies for the study of human pica. The comprehensive and multi-disciplinary approach to the collection and analysis of pica substances detailed here is a necessary preliminary step to understanding the nutritional enigma of non-food consumption."

https://openalex.org/W2056943597,"Genetic variation at NAT2 has been long recognized as the cause of differential ability to metabolize a wide variety of drugs of therapeutic use. Here, we explore the pattern of genetic variation in 12 human populations that significantly extend the geographic range and resolution of previous surveys, to test the hypothesis that different dietary regimens and lifestyles may explain inter-population differences in NAT2 variation.The entire coding region was resequenced in 98 subjects and six polymorphic positions were genotyped in 150 additional subjects. A single previously undescribed variant was found (34T>C; 12Y>H). Several aspects of the data do not fit the expectations of a neutral model, as assessed by coalescent simulations. Tajima's D is positive in all populations, indicating an excess of intermediate alleles. The level of between-population differentiation is low, and is mainly accounted for by the proportion of fast vs. slow acetylators. However, haplotype frequencies significantly differ across groups of populations with different subsistence.Data on the structure of haplotypes and their frequencies are compatible with a model in which slow-causing variants were present in widely dispersed populations before major shifts to pastoralism and/or agriculture. In this model, slow-causing mutations gained a selective advantage in populations shifting from hunting-gathering to pastoralism/agriculture. We suggest the diminished dietary availability of folates resulting from the nutritional shift, as the possible cause of the fitness increase associated to haplotypes carrying mutations that reduce enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2018316453,"Background IL-21, a member of the common γ-chain utilizing family of cytokines, participates in immune and inflammatory processes. In addition, the cytokine has been linked to autoimmunity in humans and rodents. Methodology/Principal Findings To investigate the mechanism whereby IL-21 affects the immune system, we investigated its role in T cell homeostasis and autoimmunity in both non-autoimmune C57BL/6 and autoimmune NOD mice. Our data indicate that IL-21R knockout C57BL/6 and NOD mice show increased size of their lymphocyte population and decreased homeostatic proliferation. In addition, our experimental results demonstrate that IL-21 inhibits T cell survival. These data suggest that IL-21 acts to limit the size of the T cell pool. Furthermore, our data suggest IL-21 may contribute to the development of autoimmunity. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, our results suggest that IL-21 plays a global role in regulating T cell homeostasis, promoting the continuous adaptation of the T cell lymphoid space."
https://openalex.org/W1964824483,"HIV-1 is dependent upon cellular co-factors to mediate its replication cycle in CD4+ T cells and macrophages, the two major cell types infected by the virus in vivo. One critical co-factor is Cyclin T1, a subunit of a general RNA polymerase II elongation factor known as P-TEFb. Cyclin T1 is targeted directly by the viral Tat protein to activate proviral transcription. Cyclin T1 is up-regulated when resting CD4+ T cells are activated and during macrophage differentiation or activation, conditions that are also necessary for high levels of HIV-1 replication. Because Cyclin T1 is a subunit of a transcription factor, the up-regulation of Cyclin T1 in these cells results in the induction of cellular genes, some of which might be HIV-1 co-factors. Using shRNA depletions of Cyclin T1 and transcriptional profiling, we identified 54 cellular mRNAs that appear to be Cyclin T1-dependent for their induction in activated CD4+ T Jurkat T cells and during differentiation and activation of MM6 cells, a human monocytic cell line. The promoters for these Cyclin T1-dependent genes (CTDGs) are over-represented in two transcription factor binding sites, SREBP1 and ARP1. Notably, 10 of these CTDGs have been reported to be involved in HIV-1 replication, a significant over-representation of such genes when compared to randomly generated lists of 54 genes (p value<0.00021). The results of siRNA depletion and dominant-negative protein experiments with two CTDGs identified here, CDK11 and Casein kinase 1 gamma 1, suggest that these genes are involved either directly or indirectly in HIV-1 replication. It is likely that the 54 CTDGs identified here include novel HIV-1 co-factors. The presence of CTDGs in the protein space that was available for HIV-1 to sample during its evolution and acquisition of Tat function may provide an explanation for why CTDGs are enriched in viral co-factors."
