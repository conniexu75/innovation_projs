https://openalex.org/W2039372624,"Snowshoe hare populations in the boreal forests of North America go through 10-year cycles. Supplemental food and mammalian predator abundance were manipulated in a factorial design on 1-square-kilometer areas for 8 years in the Yukon. Two blocks of forest were fertilized to test for nutrient effects. Predator exclosure doubled and food addition tripled hare density during the cyclic peak and decline. Predator exclosure combined with food addition increased density 11-fold. Added nutrients increased plant growth but not hare density. Food and predation together had a more than additive effect, which suggests that a three-trophic-level interaction generates hare cycles."
https://openalex.org/W2018501584,"Models of population dynamics in which per capita reproductive success declines at low population levels (variously known as depensation, the Allee effect, and inverse density-dependence) predict that populations can have multiple equilibria and may suddenly shift from one equilibrium to another. If such depensatory dynamics exist, reduced mortality may be insufficient to allow recovery of a population after abundance has been severely reduced by harvesting. Estimates of spawner abundance and number of surviving progeny for 128 fish stocks indicated only 3 stocks with significant depensation. Estimates of the statistical power of the tests strengthen the conclusion that depensatory dynamics are not apparent for fish populations at the levels studied."

https://openalex.org/W2060278299,"Mimicry where prey resemble predators to avoid predation is unusual. Snowberry flies, Rhagoletis zephyria Snow, possess striped wing patterns that resemble the legs of jumping spiders. Observations and comparisons of responses of the jumping spider Salticus scenicus (Clerck) to conspecifics, snowberry flies, and other prey flies showed that snowberry flies can avoid predation by jumping spiders through spider mimicry. The mimicry effect was decreased by obliterating snowberry fly wing stripes."
https://openalex.org/W2066489040,"The tephritid fly Zonosemata vittigera (Coquillett) has a leg-like pattern on its wings and a wing-waving display that together mimic the agonistic territorial displays of jumping spiders (Salticidae). Zonosemata flies initiate this display when stalked by jumping spiders, causing the spiders to display back and retreat. Wing transplant experiments showed that both the wing pattern and wing-waving displays are necessary for effective mimicry: Zonosemata flies with transplanted house fly wings and house flies with transplanted Zonosemata wings were attacked by jumping spiders. Similar experiments showed that this mimicry does not protect Zonosemata against nonsalticid predators. This is a novel form of sign stimulus mimicry that may occur more generally."
