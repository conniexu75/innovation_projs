https://openalex.org/W2030119843,"Using juxtacellular recording and labeling of hippocampal interneurons in drug-free and behaving rats, the authors show that parvalbumin-expressing basket interneurons fire in a behavioral state–dependent manner, in contrast with neuropeptide Y– and nitiric oxide synthase–expressing ivy cells. A large variety of GABAergic interneurons control information processing in the hippocampal circuits governing the formation of neuronal representations. Whether distinct hippocampal interneuron types contribute differentially to information processing during behavior is not known. We employed a new technique for recording and labeling interneurons and pyramidal cells in drug-free, freely moving rats. Recorded parvalbumin-expressing basket interneurons innervated somata and proximal pyramidal cell dendrites, whereas nitric oxide synthase– and neuropeptide Y–expressing ivy cells provided synaptic and extrasynaptic dendritic modulation. Basket and ivy cells showed distinct spike-timing dynamics, firing at different rates and times during theta and ripple oscillations. Basket, but not ivy, cells changed their firing rates during movement, sleep and quiet wakefulness, suggesting that basket cells coordinate cell assemblies in a behavioral state–contingent manner, whereas persistently firing ivy cells might control network excitability and homeostasis. Different interneuron types provide GABA to specific subcellular domains at defined times and rates, thereby differentially controlling network activity during behavior."

For the latter, hundreds of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been identified, but the mechanisms of resistance are largely unknown. Integrated non-target metabolomics and proteomics, using high resolution hybrid mass spectrometry, were applied to identify the mechanisms of resistance governed by the fusarium head blight resistance locus, Fhb1, in the near isogenic lines derived from wheat genotype Nyubai.The metabolomic and proteomic profiles were compared between the near isogenic lines (NIL) with resistant and susceptible alleles of Fhb1 upon F. graminearum or mock-inoculation. The resistance-related metabolites and proteins identified were mapped to metabolic pathways. Metabolites of the shunt phenylpropanoid pathway such as hydroxycinnamic acid amides, phenolic glucosides and flavonoids were induced only in the resistant NIL, or induced at higher abundances in resistant than in susceptible NIL, following pathogen inoculation. The identities of these metabolites were confirmed, with fragmentation patterns, using the high resolution LC-LTQ-Orbitrap. Concurrently, the enzymes of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis such as cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase, flavonoid O-methyltransferase, agmatine coumaroyltransferase and peroxidase were also up-regulated. Increased cell wall thickening due to deposition of hydroxycinnamic acid amides and flavonoids was confirmed by histo-chemical localization of the metabolites using confocal microscopy.The present study demonstrates that the resistance in Fhb1 derived from the wheat genotype Nyubai is mainly associated with cell wall thickening due to deposition of hydroxycinnamic acid amides, phenolic glucosides and flavonoids, but not with the conversion of deoxynivalenol to less toxic deoxynivalenol 3-O-glucoside."
https://openalex.org/W2093800167,"Endochondral ossification is temporally and spatially regulated by several critical transcription factors, including Sox9, Runx2, and Runx3. Although the molecular mechanisms that control the late stages of endochondral ossification (e.g. calcification) are physiologically and pathologically important, these precise regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Osterix is an essential transcription factor for endochondral ossification that functions downstream of Runx2. The global and conditional Osterix-deficient mice studied here exhibited a defect of cartilage-matrix ossification and matrix vesicle formation. Importantly, Osterix deficiencies caused the arrest of endochondral ossification at the hypertrophic stage. Microarray analysis revealed that matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13) is an important target of Osterix. We also showed that there exists a physical interaction between Osterix and Runx2 and that these proteins function cooperatively to induce MMP13 during chondrocyte differentiation. Most interestingly, the introduction of MMP13 stimulated the calcification of matrices in Osterix-deficient mouse limb bud cells. Our results demonstrated that Osterix was essential to endochondral ossification and revealed that the physical and functional interaction between Osterix and Runx2 were necessary for the induction of MMP13 during endochondral ossification."
https://openalex.org/W1979702889,"Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) can act as driving oncoproteins in certain cancers, making them attractive drug targets. Here we have characterized tumour cell responses to two new inhibitors of FGFR1–3, AZ12908010 and the clinical candidate AZD4547, making comparisons with the well-characterized FGFR inhibitor PD173074. In a panel of 16 human tumour cell lines, the anti-proliferative activity of AZ12908010 or AZD4547 was strongly linked to the presence of deregulated FGFR signalling, indicating that addiction to deregulated FGFRs provides a therapeutic opportunity for selective intervention. Acquired resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors is a growing problem in the clinic but has not yet been explored for FGFR inhibitors. To assess how FGFR-dependent tumour cells adapt to long-term FGFR inhibition, we generated a derivative of the KMS-11 myeloma cell line (FGFRY373C) with acquired resistance to AZ12908010 (KMS-11R cells). Basal phosphorylated FGFR and FGFR-dependent downstream signalling were constitutively elevated and refractory to drug in KMS-11R cells. Sequencing of FGFR3 in KMS-11R cells revealed the presence of a heterozygous mutation at the gatekeeper residue, encoding FGFR3V555M; consistent with this, KMS-11R cells were cross-resistant to AZD4547 and PD173074. These results define the selectivity and efficacy of two new FGFR inhibitors and identify a secondary gatekeeper mutation as a mechanism of acquired resistance to FGFR inhibitors that should be anticipated as clinical evaluation proceeds."
https://openalex.org/W2009991525,"Background Recent studies have shown that the well-known effect of multisensory stimulation on body-awareness can be extended to self-recognition. Seeing someone else’s face being touched at the same time as one’s own face elicits changes in the mental representation of the self-face. We sought to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms and the effects of interpersonal multisensory stimulation (IMS) on the mental representation of the self and others. Methodology/Principal Findings Participants saw an unfamiliar face being touched synchronously or asynchronously with their own face, as if they were looking in the mirror. Following synchronous, but not asynchronous, IMS, participants assimilated features of the other’s face in the mental representation of their own face as evidenced by the change in the point of subjective equality for morphed pictures of the two faces. Interestingly, synchronous IMS resulted in a unidirectional change in the self-other distinction, affecting recognition of one’s own face, but not recognition of the other’s face. The participants’ autonomic responses to objects approaching the other’s face were higher following synchronous than asynchronous IMS, but this increase was not specific to the pattern of IMS in interaction with the viewed object. Finally, synchronous, as compared to asynchronous, IMS resulted in significant differences in participants’ ratings of their experience, but unlike other bodily illusions, positive changes in subjective experience were related to the perceived physical similarity between the two faces, and not to identification. Conclusions/Significance Synchronous IMS produces quantifiable changes in the mental representations of one’s face, as measured behaviorally. Changes in autonomic responses and in the subjective experience of self-identification were broadly consistent with patterns observed in other bodily illusions, but less robust. Overall, shared multisensory experiences between self and other can change the mental representation of one’s identity, and the perceived similarity of others relative to one’s self."
https://openalex.org/W2031075742,"The Drosophila proteins Neuroligin (Nlg1) and Neurexin (Nrx-1) form a trans-synaptic complex that regulates synapse formation at the neuromuscular junction. Here the authors show that Syd-1, also known to regulate active zone formation, interacts with presynaptic Nrx-1, promoting synaptic clustering and immobilization of Nrx-1, and subsequent glutamate receptor incorporation. Synapse formation and maturation requires bidirectional communication across the synaptic cleft. The trans-synaptic Neurexin-Neuroligin complex can bridge this cleft, and severe synapse assembly deficits are found in Drosophila melanogaster neuroligin (Nlg1, dnlg1) and neurexin (Nrx-1, dnrx) mutants. We show that the presynaptic active zone protein Syd-1 interacts with Nrx-1 to control synapse formation at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. Mutants in Syd-1 (RhoGAP100F, dsyd-1), Nrx-1 and Nlg1 shared active zone cytomatrix defects, which were nonadditive. Syd-1 and Nrx-1 formed a complex in vivo, and Syd-1 was important for synaptic clustering and immobilization of Nrx-1. Consequently, postsynaptic clustering of Nlg1 was affected in Syd-1 mutants, and in vivo glutamate receptor incorporation was changed in Syd-1, Nrx-1 and Nlg1 mutants. Stabilization of nascent Syd-1–Liprin-α (DLiprin-α) clusters, important to initialize active zone formation, was Nlg1 dependent. Thus, cooperation between Syd-1 and Nrx-1–Nlg1 seems to orchestrate early assembly processes between pre- and postsynaptic membranes, promoting avidity of newly forming synaptic scaffolds."
https://openalex.org/W1985685584,"Among the mechanisms controlling copper homeostasis in plants is the regulation of its uptake and tissue partitioning. Here we characterized a newly identified member of the conserved CTR/COPT family of copper transporters in Arabidopsis thaliana, COPT6. We showed that COPT6 resides at the plasma membrane and mediates copper accumulation when expressed in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae copper uptake mutant. Although the primary sequence of COPT6 contains the family conserved domains, including methionine-rich motifs in the extracellular N-terminal domain and a second transmembrane helix (TM2), it is different from the founding family member, S. cerevisiae Ctr1p. This conclusion was based on the finding that although the positionally conserved Met106 residue in the TM2 of COPT6 is functionally essential, the conserved Met27 in the N-terminal domain is not. Structure-function studies revealed that the N-terminal domain is dispensable for COPT6 function in copper-replete conditions but is important under copper-limiting conditions. In addition, COPT6 interacts with itself and with its homolog, COPT1, unlike Ctr1p, which interacts only with itself. Analyses of the expression pattern showed that although COPT6 is expressed in different cell types of different plant organs, the bulk of its expression is located in the vasculature. We also show that COPT6 expression is regulated by copper availability that, in part, is controlled by a master regulator of copper homeostasis, SPL7. Finally, studies using the A. thaliana copt6-1 mutant and plants overexpressing COPT6 revealed its essential role during copper limitation and excess.

Copper is a redox-active transition element that serves as an essential micronutrient for all living organisms (1Burkhead J.L. Reynolds K.A. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Cohu C.M. Pilon M.

It acts as a cofactor for enzymes involved in electron transfer reactions and, thus, participates in important biological processes such as respiration, photosynthesis, and scavenging of oxidative stress. In addition, copper is involved in the perception of ethylene, nitrogen metabolism, molybdenum cofactor synthesis, cell wall remodeling, and response to pathogens in plants (1Burkhead J.L.

However, free copper ions are toxic to cells in excess due to their ability to promote the formation of free radicals through the Fenton reaction and increased malfunction of important proteins, either through thiol capping or displacement of metal co-factors of metalloenzymes (1Burkhead J.L.

Therefore, organisms have evolved sophisticated mechanisms for maintaining copper homeostasis to prevent deficiency while avoiding toxicity. The response to copper deficiency in plants includes reallocation of intracellular copper and induction of the expression of copper uptake systems. In Arabidopsis thaliana, this regulation is largely attributable to the activity of the transcription factor SPL7 (SQUAMOSA promoter-binding protein-like 7) and its downstream targets, microRNAs (9Abdel-Ghany S.E.

Subsequent studies showed that COPT1 localizes to the plasma membrane, mediates copper influx, and, similar to CTR proteins from other organisms, is highly specific for copper(I) (20Andrés-Colás N.

Studies in A. thaliana showed that COPT1 plays a predominant role in copper acquisition from the soil via root tips (20Andrés-Colás N. Perea-García A. Puig S. Peñarrubia L.

In contrast, COPT5 localizes to the tonoplast and prevacuolar compartment and functions by remobilizing copper from these organelles during copper deficiency (37Garcia-Molina A. Andrés-Colás N.

COPT6 is a newly identified member of the CTR/COPT family of A. thaliana transporters (32Peñarrubia L. Andrés-Colás N. Moreno J. Puig S. Regulation of copper transport in Arabidopsis thaliana.

We show that COPT6 is a plasma membrane copper uptake transporter that is distinct from its S. cerevisiae counterpart, Ctr1p, and plays an important role in A. thaliana during copper deficiency and excess. All plant lines used in the study were in the A. thaliana Columbia (Col-0) background. Seeds of the copt6-1 (SALK 083438) T-DNA insertion allele were obtained from the Arabidopsis biological Resource Center (39Alonso J.M. Stepanova A.N. Leisse T.J. Kim C.J. Chen H. Shinn P.

Before growing different A. thaliana lines on solid medium, seeds were surface-sterilized with 75% (v/v) ethanol before soaking in a solution containing 1.8% bleach (made up by diluting household Clorox) and 0.1% Tween 20. Sterilized seeds were rinsed with sterile water and sowed on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (½ MS) medium (pH 5.7) with 0.1% (w/v) sucrose and 0.7% (w/v) agar (Sigma A1296) supplemented with or without 45 μm CuCl2 or the indicated concentrations of the specific copper chelator, bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS). After stratification at 4 °C for 2 days in darkness, seeds were germinated, and seedlings were grown vertically for 10 days (at 22 °C; 12-h light/12-h dark photoperiod at photosynthetic photon flux density of 120 μmol m−2 s−1) before subsequent analyses. Root and shoot tissues from 10-day-old seedlings grown under the indicated conditions were separated and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen before homogenization in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle.

Activation of TLR9 for signaling requires proteolytic processing within the ectodomain by endosome-associated proteases. Whether TLR3 requires similar proteolytic processing to become competent for signaling remains unclear. Herein we report that human TLR3 is proteolytically processed to form two fragments in endosomes. Unc93b1 is required for processing by transporting TLR3 through the Golgi complex and to the endosomes. Proteolytic cleavage requires the eight-amino acid Loop1 within leucine-rich repeat 12 of the TLR3 ectodomain. Proteolytic cleavage is not required for TLR3 signaling in response to poly(I:C), although processing could modulate the degree of response toward viral double-stranded RNAs, especially in mouse cells. Both the full-length and cleaved fragments of TLR3 can bind poly(I:C) and are present in endosomes. However, although the full-length TLR3 has a half-life in HEK293T cells of 3 h, the cleaved fragments have half-lives in excess of 7 h.

Endosomes also contain pH-activated proteases such as cathepsins that have been documented to cleave TLR7 and TLR9 (11Ewald S.E. Lee B.L. Lau L. Wickliffe K.E. Shi G.P. Chapman H.A. Barton G.M.

Cleavage is a stepwise process mediated by redundant proteases. The first step involves cathepsins that have broad sequence recognition (14Turk V. Stoka V. Vasiljeva O. Renko M. Sun T. Turk B. Turk D. Cysteine cathepsins. From structure, function and regulation to new frontiers.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1824: 68-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) and/or asparagine endopeptidase that cleaves C-terminal to asparagines, generating an N-terminal fragment and an intermediate, untrimmed C-terminal fragment (CTF). The second step has cathepsins further trimming the CTF to produce the mature and active form of TLR9 (15Ewald S.E. Engel A. Lee J. Wang M. Bogyo M. Barton G.M. Nucleic acid recognition by Toll-like receptors is coupled to stepwise processing by cathepsins and asparagine endopeptidase.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Both full-length and the mature CTF of TLR9 can bind ligand; however, only the latter could bind TLR9 adaptor for signaling transduction (11Ewald S.E. Lee B.L. Lau L. Wickliffe K.E. Shi G.P.

It was also found that the TLR9 CTF binds inhibitory oliogodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) with higher affinity than full-length TLR9 (16Avalos A.M. Ploegh H.L. Competition by inhibitory oligonucleotides prevents binding of CpG to C-terminal TLR9.Eur. J. Immunol. 2011; 41: 2820-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition to the processing between leucine-rich repeat (LRR) 14 and LRR15 to generate the CTF, TLR9 was also found to be cleaved at the C terminus of the ectodomain to generate a soluble fragment that negatively regulates TLR9 function (17Chockalingam A. Cameron J.L. Brooks J.C. Leifer C.A. Negative regulation of signaling by a soluble form of toll-like receptor 9.Eur. J. Immunol. 2011; 41: 2176-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Avian TLR15 also requires proteolytic cleavage the ectodomain to be activated (18de Zoete M.R. Bouwman L.I. Keestra A.M. van Putten J.P.

Given the important role of endolysosomes in the regulation of TLR3, -7, and -9 function, trafficking chaperones are required for signaling. Unc93b1 is an endoplasmic reticulum-resident molecular chaperone responsible for translocation of TLRs 3, 7, and 9 to endolysosomes (19Kim Y.M. Brinkmann M.M. Paquet M.E. Ploegh H.L. UNC93B1 delivers nucleotide-sensing toll-like receptors to endolysosomes.Nature. 2008; 452: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). A H412R substitution (3d mutation) was found to render mice deficient in immune responses mediated by TLR3, -7, and -9 by failing to bind the TLRs and facilitate their trafficking after ligand addition (19Kim Y.M.

Interestingly, the N-terminal region of Unc93b1 can differentially regulate TLR9 and TLR7. The Unc93b1 mutant D34A down-regulated TLR9 trafficking and signaling while up-regulating TLR7 signaling (22Fukui R. Saitoh S. Matsumoto F. Kozuka-Hata H. Oyama M. Tabeta K. Beutler B. Miyake K.

Proteolytic cleavage was claimed by Ewald et al. (15Ewald S.E. Engel A. Lee J. Wang M. Bogyo M. Barton G.M.

This work examines proteolytic processing of TLR3 and its effects on TLR3 function, especially in human cell lines. We found that interaction with Unc93b1 is required for the proteolytic cleavage of TLR3 in cultured cell lines. However, unlike TLR9, proteolytic cleavage is not required for TLR3 signaling, although cleavage did modulate ligand recognition in the mouse RAW264.7 cells. Finally, we documented that the cleaved fragments have increased stability when compared with the full-length TLR3 and alter trafficking to subpopulations of endolysosomes. The plasmid to express the wild-type (WT) TLR3 was previously described in Qi et al. (23Qi R. Hoose S. Schreiter J. Sawant K.V. Lamb R. Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Mills J. San Mateo L. Jordan J.L. Kao C.C.

(San Diego, CA). TLR3 with mutations in Loop1 were made by site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotides and the QuikChange kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, Inc., San Diego, CA). Unc93b1-Myc-FLAG and the 3d mutant were described in Qi et al. (23Qi R. Hoose S. Schreiter J. Sawant K.V. Lamb R. Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Mills J. San Mateo L. Jordan J.L. Kao C.C.

Plasmid pUbAU1 that can express ubiquitin with a C-terminal AU1 epitope tag was a generous gift from Dr. Khaled Tolba of the University of Miami, Miami, FL. Construct Δ1–12-HA encodes amino acids 1–51 of TLR3, fused to amino acids 354–906 followed by the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) tag (YPYDVPDYA). 344-C-HA encodes amino acids 1–51 and 344–906 of TLR3 and a C-terminal HA tag. Δ1–12-HA and 344-C-HA were constructed using forward primer 5′-CTCAGGTACCCGATGATCTACCCACATGTTTGGAGCACCTTAACATGG-3′ and CTCAGGTACCCGATGATCTACCCACACCCAAGATTGATGATTTTTCTTTTCAG, respectively, and reverse primer 5′-TTTTCTAGACCTCTCCATTCCTG-3′. Both PCR products were digested with KpnI and XbaI and ligated into the pUNO-TLR3-HA digested with the same restriction enzymes. Luciferase reporter assays for TLR-dependent signaling were performed as described previously (23Qi R. Hoose S. Schreiter J. Sawant K.V. Lamb R. Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Mills J. San Mateo L. Jordan J.L. Kao C.C. Secretion of the human Toll-like receptor 3 ectodomain is affected by single nucleotide polymorphisms and regulated by Unc93b1.J. Biol.

Briefly, HEK293T cells were plated in CoStar white 96-well plates in DMEM with 10% FBS and transfected with plasmids including pUNO-TLR3/4/9 to express TLRs, pNiFty-Luc/ISRE-Luc to express firefly luciferase reporters, and phRL-TK/pCMV-TK to express Renilla luciferase as an internal control. 24 h after transfection cells were induced by adding ligands of the TLRs to the culture medium, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed using the Duo-Glo luciferase kit from Sigma and BioTek plate reader. Unless stated otherwise, TLR3 signaling was monitored with the firefly luciferase driven from the ISRE2 promoter and induced with poly(I:C) at 2.5 ng/ml (Amersham Biosciences). TLR4 signaling was assessed in cells that coexpressed TLR4 adaptors MD-2, CD14, and LPS binding protein, with the firefly luciferase driven by the NF-κB promoter and induced with LPS at 1 μg/ml (Invivogen). TLR9 signaling was assayed using firefly luciferase driven from the NF-κB promoter and induced with ODN2006 at 2 μm added to the cell culture medium (Invivogen). In Huh7.5 cells, the CMV promoter was used to express the Renilla luciferase. In HEK293T cells, a thymidine kinase promoter was used to drive the Renilla luciferase. IL6 production by immortalized human lung epithelial BEAS-2B and mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cell lines was used to assess activities of endogenously expressed TLRs. BEAS-2B cells were cultured in BEGM media with supplements (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland; Ref. 28Lai Y. Adhikarakunnathu S. Bhardwaj K. Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Wen Y. Jordan J.L. Wu L.H. Dragnea B. San Mateo L. Kao C.C. LL37 and cationic peptides enhance TLR3 signaling by viral double-stranded RNAs.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e26632Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). TLR3 was induced with 0.125 ng/ml poly(I:C). RAW264.7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Induction of TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9 used, respectively, final concentrations of 50 ng/ml poly(I:C), 10 ng/ml LPS, 10 μg/ml gardiquimod (Invivogen) and 1 μm ODN1826 (Invivogen). After a 12-h induction, the cell culture media were harvested and centrifuged at 2000 × g to remove intact cells, and the concentration of IL6 was measured by ELISA with BD OptEIATM human IL6 ELISA set (BD Biosciences) or the DuoSet® mouse IL6 kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Poly(A:U) was from Invivogen. Purified Reovirus double-stranded (ds) genomic RNAs were extracted from purified virions, and Reovirus S4 was made by in vitro transcription of the sense and antisense strands followed by annealing of a 1:1 ratio of the two RNAs as described in Lai et al. (29Lai Y. Yi G. Chen A. Bhardwaj K. Tragesser B.J. Rodrigo A Valverde Zlotnick A. Mukhopadhyay S. Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Kao C.C.

Immunoprecipitations and Western blot assays used the buffers and protocols detailed in Qi et al. (23Qi R. Hoose S. Schreiter J. Sawant K.V. Lamb R. Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Mills J. San Mateo L. Jordan J.L. Kao C.C. Secretion of the human Toll-like receptor 3 ectodomain is affected by single nucleotide polymorphisms and regulated by Unc93b1.J. Biol.

A polyclonal antibody-recognizing epitope(s) in the TLR3 ectodomain was from R&D systems (catalog #AF1487), whereas polyclonal antibody that recognized the TLR3 TIR domain was from Abcam, Inc. (Cambridge, MA; catalog #Ab84911). Anti-HA antibodies were from either Abcam (catalog #Ab9134) or Roche Applied Science (clone 3F10). Monoclonal antibodies recognizing epitope tags FLAG® and AU1 were, respectively, from Sigma (Clone M2, catalog #F1804) and Covance (Indianapolis, IN; catalog #MMS-130R). Proteins for Western blots were separated in denaturing 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). The HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies that recognized mouse, rat, or goat IgGs were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Proteins were detected using the ECL-plusTM or ECLTM-advance Western blotting Detection System (Amersham Biosciences), imaged using a ChemiDocTM XRS+ system (Bio-Rad), and quantified using ImageLab software (Bio-Rad). z-FA-FMK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and bafilomycin A1 (Sigma, Inc.) were used at final concentrations of 5 μm and 2.5 nm unless stated otherwise. Lactacystin was from Sigma. IL6 production by BEAS-2B cells and RAW264.7 cells in the presence of bafilomycin A1 or z-FA-FMK had the inhibitors added to the cell culture media at the initial seeding of the cells, and the inhibitors were replaced every 24 h, as necessary. When HEK293T cells were treated with protease inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors and transfected with plasmids, the inhibitors were added at seeding. Before transfection, media was discarded and replaced with fresh media without inhibitors. 4 h after transfection culture media were replaced with fresh media with inhibitors. The media with inhibitors were replaced every 24 h as necessary. Peptide N-glycosidase F and acetylglucosaminidase H were from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Enzymatic reactions were performed with whole cell lysates under denaturing conditions according to manufacturer's instructions. They were then analyzed by Western blotting. EZ-link® Sulfo-NHS-Biotin from Thermo Scientific was used to label proteins on the cell surface as instructed by the manufacturer. Briefly, HEK293T cells transfected to express TLR3 for 36 h were washed three times with PBS, and suspended in 10 mm Sulfo-NHS-Biotin dissolved in distilled water to allow labeling at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were then washed once with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0 to quench additional labeling reactions, then washed three times with PBS, pH 8.0. Cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated with Streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma Aldrich, catalog #85881) preblocked with 1% BSA in PBS. The precipitated proteins were separated on denaturing SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blots. Biotinylated poly(I:C) was prepared in the dark as follows. Poly(I:C) was dissolved in a sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, at 2 mg/ml. This solution was diluted with an equal volume of 20 mm sodium periodate and incubated on ice for 1 h. Free sodium periodate was removed by use of a Microcon concentrator (Millipore Inc., 100-kDa cutoff) with 3 washes at 4 °C with 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5. Biotin hydrazide at 5 mm (dissolved in DMSO) was added to the mixture and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Free biotin hydrazide was removed with a Microcon concentrator as described above. One volume of 0.2 m sodium borohydride and 2 volumes of 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.2, were added, and the reaction was incubated on ice for 30 min. The products were purified by precipitation with two volumes of ethanol, suspended in water, and quantified by spectrophotometry. Biotinylation of poly(I:C) was confirmed by probing the RNA with streptavidin-HRP and the ECL-plusTM Western blot detection system. Cells expressing TLR3 were lysed in buffer L (50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 5.5), clarified by a 5000 × g centrifugation for 5 min, and incubated with 2.5 ng/ml of biotinylated poly(I:C) or unlabeled poly(I:C) at 2.5 ng/ml at 37 °C for 1 h, then precipitated with streptavidin-agarose beads that had been pre-blocked with PBS amended with 1% (W/V) of BSA at 4 °C for 3 h and washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS. The precipitates were analyzed for TLR3 with Western blots. These cells were not treated with endosome inhibitors. Pulse-chase experiments used HEK293T cells transfected with plasmids at a confluency of ∼85%. After incubation in complete medium for 16 h, the cells were switched to a pulse medium consisting of DMEM medium lacking methionine and cysteine and supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS. The pulse medium was then removed and replaced with the pulse medium amended with 150 μCi/ml EasyTagTM Expre35S35S Protein Labeling Mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After 30 min of incubation with constant mixing at 37 °C, the cells were fed a complete medium supplemented with 10 mg/liter each of methionine and cysteine. Individually prepared wells of cells were harvested at specified times after the start of the chase reaction and lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA (Abcam) antibody. The precipitates were separated on 4–12% denaturing Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and imaged by autoradiography. The cyclohexamide (CHX)-chase assays used HEK293T cells grown to ∼85% confluency in a 6-well plate and transfected with 2.5 μg of plasmids expressing the desired protein. 16 h later cells were resuspended in media containing 50 μg/ml CHX (Sigma, catalog #C4859) and seeded in 24-well plates. The cells were harvested at specified times after the start of the chase reaction, lysed, and analyzed by Western blots. HEK-293T cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips to 60% confluency. The cells were transfected with pUNO-TLR3 or pUNO-TLR3 ΔL1 complexed to Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and permeabilized with T buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS with 1% normal goat serum) for 30 min on ice. The cells were then blocked with 2% BSA in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4 with 0.5% Triton X-100). Incubation with primary antibodies was at 4 °C for overnight in TBS-T containing 2% BSA. After 3 washes with TBS-T, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and then washed three times with TBS-T. Nuclei were stained for 30 min at room temperature with a 1:1000 dilution of the DNA-specific dye DRAQ5TM (Abcam). The coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Gold anti-fade mounting medium (Invitrogen) and dried overnight in the dark. The micrographs were acquired with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal inverted-base microscope with a 63× oil objective at Indiana University Light Microscopy Imaging Center. Images were analyzed by Leica LAS AF and Image J software. Colocalization of fluorophores was quantified using the ImageJ plug-in tool JACoP (Bolte and Cordelieres (50Bolte S. Cordelières F.P. A guided tour into subcellular colocalization analysis in light microscopy.J. Microsc. 2006; 224: 213-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar)). Primary antibodies include goat anti-TLR3 ECD (R&D Systems), rabbit anti-Rab5, Rab7, Rab11 (Cell Signaling Inc.), mouse anti-EEA1 (BD Biosciences), and mouse anti-LAMP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies include anti-rabbit Alexa 488, anti-goat Alexa 594, and anti-mouse Alexa 488 (Invitrogen). Endosomal fractionation used a 0–20% continuous iodoxanol gradient (Optiprep, Sigma) prepared in a Beckman 15 ml centrifuge tube using a BioComp Gradient Master (BioComp Instruments, Inc.). HEK293T cells were grown on 10-cm culture plates and transfected with TLR3-HA plasmid. 24 h after transfection cells were lysed in 500 μl of homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.8, with protease inhibitors) and homogenized by passing the cells through a 25-gauge needle 20 times. Cell lysis was confirmed by microscopy. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Post-nuclear supernatant was loaded on top of the iodoxanol gradient and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C in SW45 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Twenty fractions were collected, and the proteins were precipitated using trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 25% (w/v). Pellets were washed twice with cold acetone and dissolved in either PBS for immunoprecipita"
https://openalex.org/W2170476899,"Deregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression can have a critical role in carcinogenesis. Here we show in prostate cancer that miRNA-205 (miR-205) transcription is commonly repressed and the MIR-205 locus is hypermethylated. LOC642587, the MIR-205 host gene of unknown function, is also concordantly inactivated. We show that miR-205 targets mediator 1 (MED1, also called TRAP220 and PPARBP) for transcriptional silencing in normal prostate cells, leading to reduction in MED1 mRNA levels, and in total and active phospho-MED1 protein. Overexpression of miR-205 in prostate cancer cells negatively affects cell viability, consistent with a tumor suppressor function. We found that hypermethylation of the MIR-205 locus was strongly related with a decrease in miR-205 expression and an increase in MED1 expression in primary tumor samples (n=14), when compared with matched normal prostate (n=7). An expanded patient cohort (tumor n=149, matched normal n=30) also showed significant MIR-205 DNA methylation in tumors compared with normal, and MIR-205 hypermethylation is significantly associated with biochemical recurrence (hazard ratio=2.005, 95% confidence interval (1.109, 3.625), P=0.02), in patients with low preoperative prostate specific antigen. In summary, these results suggest that miR-205 is an epigenetically regulated tumor suppressor that targets MED1 and may provide a potential biomarker in prostate cancer management."
https://openalex.org/W2152261949,"Pah1p, which functions as phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, plays a crucial role in lipid homeostasis by controlling the relative proportions of its substrate phosphatidate and its product diacylglycerol. The diacylglycerol produced by PAP is used for the synthesis of triacylglycerol as well as for the synthesis of phospholipids via the Kennedy pathway. Pah1p is a highly phosphorylated protein in vivo and has been previously shown to be phosphorylated by the protein kinases Pho85p-Pho80p and Cdc28p-cyclin B. In this work, we showed that Pah1p was a bona fide substrate for protein kinase A, and we identified by mass spectrometry and mutagenesis that Ser-10, Ser-677, Ser-773, Ser-774, and Ser-788 were the target sites of phosphorylation. Protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of Pah1p inhibited its PAP activity by decreasing catalytic efficiency, and the inhibitory effect was primarily conferred by phosphorylation at Ser-10. Analysis of the S10A and S10D mutations (mimicking dephosphorylation and phosphorylation, respectively), alone or in combination with the seven alanine (7A) mutations of the sites phosphorylated by Pho85p-Pho80p and Cdc28p-cyclin B, indicated that phosphorylation at Ser-10 stabilized Pah1p abundance and inhibited its association with membranes, PAP activity, and triacylglycerol synthesis. The S10A mutation enhanced the physiological effects imparted by the 7A mutations, whereas the S10D mutations attenuated the effects of the 7A mutations. These data indicated that the protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-10 functions in conjunction with the phosphorylations mediated by Pho85p-Pho80p and Cdc28p-cyclin B and that phospho-Ser-10 should be dephosphorylated for proper PAP function.

https://openalex.org/W2044555216,"We investigate the communication sequences of millions of people through two different channels and analyse the fine grained temporal structure of correlated event trains induced by single individuals. By focusing on correlations between the heterogeneous dynamics and the topology of egocentric networks we find that the bursty trains usually evolve for pairs of individuals rather than for the ego and his/her several neighbours, thus burstiness is a property of the links rather than of the nodes. We compare the directional balance of calls and short messages within bursty trains to the average on the actual link and show that for the trains of voice calls the imbalance is significantly enhanced, while for short messages the balance within the trains increases. These effects can be partly traced back to the technological constraints (for short messages) and partly to the human behavioural features (voice calls). We define a model that is able to reproduce the empirical results and may help us to understand better the mechanisms driving technology mediated human communication dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W1968953479,"Amplification and overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 occur in up to 30% of human breast cancers, and high ErbB2 levels are correlated with poor prognosis for breast cancer patients. In contrast to the epithelial growth factor receptor (ErbB1), ErbB2 is not downregulated by ligand-induced mechanisms. Here we show that flotillins are involved in the stabilization of ErbB2 at the plasma membrane. In SKBR3 breast cancer cells and breast cancer tissue, a positive correlation between flotillin and ErbB2 expression levels could be demonstrated. Moreover, the tissue microarray analyses of biopsies from 194 patients diagnosed with carcinomas of the breast showed that flotillin-2 emerged as a potential predictor of prognosis in breast cancer. Depletion of flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 leads to internalization and degradation of ErbB2. Furthermore, flotillin-1 and -2 were found to be in a molecular complex with ErbB2 and Hsp90. The depletion of one of these proteins results in disruption of this complex, followed by destabilization of ErbB2 at the membrane, and its internalization and degradation. As a consequence, ErbB2-triggered downstream signalling is inhibited. Our data demonstrate a novel mechanism for interfering with ErbB2 signalling, which potentially can have clinical impact."
https://openalex.org/W1978819687,"The Snail1 transcriptional repressor plays a key role in triggering epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Although Snail1 is widely expressed in early development, in adult animals it is limited to a subset of mesenchymal cells where it has a largely unknown function. Using a mouse model with inducible depletion of Snail1, here we demonstrate that Snail1 is required to maintain mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). This effect is associated to the responsiveness to transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 that shows a strong Snail1 dependence. Snail1 depletion in conditional knockout adult animals causes a significant decrease in the number of bone marrow-derived MSCs. In culture, Snail1-deficient MSCs prematurely differentiate to osteoblasts or adipocytes and, in contrast to controls, are resistant to the TGF-β1-induced differentiation block. These results demonstrate a new role for Snail1 in TGF-β response and MSC maintenance."

Notably, the effects on HS and CS biosynthesis in the respective mutant strains were shown to differ from what had been hypothesized. In uxs1 and b3gat3 mutant larvae, biosynthesis of CS was shown to be virtually abolished, whereas these mutants still were capable of synthesizing 50% of the HS produced in control larvae. extl3 and ext2 mutants on the other hand were shown to synthesize reduced amounts of hypersulfated HS. Further, extl3 mutants produced higher levels of CS than control larvae, whereas morpholino-mediated suppression of csgalnact1/csgalnact2 resulted in increased HS biosynthesis. Thus, the balance of the Extl3 and Csgalnact1/Csgalnact2 proteins influences the HS/CS ratio. A characterization of the pharyngeal cartilage element morphologies in the single mutant strains, as well as in ext2;uxs1 double mutants, was conducted. A correlation between HS and CS production and phenotypes was found, such that impaired HS biosynthesis was shown to affect chondrocyte intercalation, whereas impaired CS biosynthesis inhibited formation of the extracellular matrix surrounding chondrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2010822377,"As the renewable source of all cell types in the body, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) hold great promise for human cell therapy. However, one major bottleneck that hinders the clinic application of hESCs is that hESCs remaining with their differentiated derivatives pose cancer risk by forming teratomas after transplantation. NANOG is a critical pluripotency factor specifically expressed in hESCs but rarely in their differentiated derivatives. By introducing a hyperactive variant of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene into the 3'-untranslated region of the endogenous NANOG gene of hESCs through homologous recombination, we developed a safe and highly scalable approach to efficiently eliminate the teratoma risk associated with hESCs without apparent negative impact on their differentiated cell types. As thymidine kinase is widely used in human gene therapy trials and is the therapeutic target of U. S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs, our strategy could be effectively applied to the clinic development of hESC-based human cell therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2060812610,"The androgen receptor (AR) acts as a ligand-dependent transcriptional factor and plays a critical role in the development and progression of androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer. Castration results in hypoxia in prostate cancer cells, and hypoxia enhances transcriptional activity of AR through hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α at low serum androgen levels mimicking the castration-resistant stage. However, HIF-1α is necessary but not sufficient for hypoxia-activated AR transactivation, and the molecular mechanism that regulates AR function in castration-resistant prostate cancer remains unclear. Here, we report that β-catenin is required for HIF-1α-mediated AR transactivation in hypoxic LNCaP prostate cancer cells under low androgen conditions. HIF-1α and β-catenin coordinately enhanced AR N-terminal and C-terminal interaction. β-Catenin accumulated in the nucleus in the HIF-1α protein-positive cells of LNCaP xenografts in castrated mice. In LNCaP cells, when HIF-1α was knocked down or was exogenously expressed in the cytoplasm, hypoxia-induced nuclear localization of β-catenin was inhibited. β-Catenin formed a complex with HIF-1α both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. Hypoxia increased the amount of a complex composed of AR and β-catenin, and knockdown of HIF-1α attenuated the recruitment of AR and β-catenin to the androgen response elements (AREs) of androgen-responsive genes. Furthermore, together with β-catenin, HIF-1α bound to the AREs in the presence of androgen. These results demonstrate that (i) HIF-1α and β-catenin coordinately enhance AR transactivation by accelerating N-terminal and C-terminal interaction; (ii) HIF-1α promotes nuclear translocation of β-catenin in hypoxia; and (iii) AR, HIF-1α, and β-catenin form a ternary complex on AREs."
https://openalex.org/W2064378988,"Sulindac is an FDA-approved non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with documented anticancer activities. Our recent studies showed that sulindac selectively enhanced the killing of cancer cells exposed to oxidizing agents via production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction. This effect of sulindac and oxidative stress on cancer cells could be related to the defect in respiration in cancer cells, first described by Warburg 50 years ago, known as the Warburg effect. We postulated that sulindac might enhance the selective killing of cancer cells when combined with any compound that alters mitochondrial respiration. To test this hypothesis we have used dichloroacetate (DCA), which is known to shift pyruvate metabolism away from lactic acid formation to respiration. One might expect that DCA, since it stimulates aerobic metabolism, could stress mitochondrial respiration in cancer cells, which would result in enhanced killing in the presence of sulindac. In this study, we have shown that the combination of sulindac and DCA enhances the selective killing of A549 and SCC25 cancer cells under the conditions used. As predicted, the mechanism of killing involves ROS production, mitochondrial dysfunction, JNK signaling and death by apoptosis. Our results suggest that the sulindac-DCA drug combination may provide an effective cancer therapy."

We previously showed that the heparan sulfate (HS) 6-O-endosulfatases (Sulf1 and -2) repress FGF signaling to induce SC differentiation during muscle regeneration. Here, we identify a novel role of Sulfs in myoblast fusion using a skeletal muscle-specific Sulf double null (Sulf(SK)-DN) mouse. Regenerating Sulf(SK)-DN muscles exhibit reduced canonical Wnt signaling and elevated non-canonical Wnt signaling. In addition, we show that Sulfs are required to repress non-canonical Wnt signaling to promote myoblast fusion. Notably, skeletal muscle-relevant non-canonical Wnt ligands lack HS binding capacity, suggesting that Sulfs indirectly repress this pathway. Mechanistically, we show that Sulfs reduce the canonical Wnt-HS binding and regulate colocalization of the co-receptor LRP5 with caveolin3. Therefore, Sulfs may increase the bioavailability of canonical Wnts for Frizzled receptor and LRP5/6 interaction in lipid raft, which may in turn antagonize non-canonical Wnt signaling. Furthermore, changes in subcellular distribution of active focal adhesion kinase (FAK) are associated with the fusion defect of Sulf-deficient myoblasts and upon non-canonical Wnt treatment. Together, our findings uncover a critical role of Sulfs in myoblast fusion by promoting antagonizing canonical Wnt signaling activities against the noncanonical Wnt pathway during skeletal muscle regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2082525702,"Hypoxia inducible factor-2α (HIF-2α) has a critical role in renal tumorigenesis. HIF-2α is stabilized in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-deficient renal cell carcinoma through mechanisms that require ongoing mRNA translation. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions in two distinct complexes: Raptor-associated mTORC1 and Rictor-associated mTORC2. Rictor-associated mTORC2 complex has been linked to maintaining HIF-2α protein in the absence of VHL; however, the mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Although Raptor-associated mTORC1 is a known key upstream regulator of mRNA translation, initiation and elongation, the role of mTORC2 in regulating mRNA translation is not clear. Complex assembly of the mRNA cap protein, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 (eIF4)E, with activators (eIF4 gamma (eIF4G)) and inhibitors (eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1)) are rate-limiting determinants of mRNA translation. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that reactive oxygen species, mediated by p22(phox)-based Nox oxidases, are enhanced in VHL-deficient cells and have a role in the activation of Akt on S473, a site phosphorylated by the mTORC2 complex. In this study, we examined the role of Rictor-dependent regulation of HIF-2α through eIF4E-dependent mRNA translation and examined the effects of p22(phox)-based Nox oxidases on TORC2 regulation. We demonstrate for the first time that mTORC2 complex stability and activation is redox sensitive, and further defined a novel role for p22(phox)-based Nox oxidases in eIF4E-dependent mRNA translation through mTORC2. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that silencing of p22(phox) reduces HIF-2α-dependent gene targeting in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. The clinical relevance of these studies is demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2088025299,"The IL1RL1/ST2 gene encodes a receptor for IL-33. Signaling from IL1RL1/ST2 induced by IL-33 binding was recently identified as a modulator of the Th2 response. The target cells for IL-33 are restricted in some hematopoietic lineages, including mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, Th2 cells, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of cell type-specific IL1RL1/ST2 expression in mast cells and basophils, transcriptional regulation of the human IL1RL1/ST2 promoter was investigated using the mast cell line LAD2 and the basophilic cell line KU812. Reporter assays suggested that two GATA motifs just upstream of the transcription start site in the ST2 promoter are critical for transcriptional activity. These two GATA motifs possess the capacity to bind GATA1 and GATA2 in EMSA. ChIP assay showed that GATA2, but not GATA1, bound to the ST2 promoter in LAD2 cells and that histone H3 at the ST2 promoter was acetylated in LAD2 cells, whereas binding of GATA1 and GATA2 to the ST2 promoter was detected in KU812 cells. Knockdown of GATA2 mRNA by siRNA reduced ST2 mRNA levels in KU812 and LAD2 cells and ST2 protein levels in LAD2 cells; in contrast, GATA1 siRNA transfection up-regulated ST2 mRNA levels in KU812 cells. The ST2 promoter was transactivated by GATA2 and repressed by GATA1 in coexpression analysis. When these siRNAs were introduced into human peripheral blood basophils, GATA2 siRNA reduced ST2 mRNA, whereas GATA1 siRNA up-regulated ST2 mRNA. These results indicate that GATA2 and GATA1 positively and negatively control human ST2 gene transcription, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2058010905,"L1, a neuronal cell adhesion receptor of the immunoglobulin-like protein family is expressed in invading colorectal cancer (CRC) cells as a target gene of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Overexpression of L1 in CRC cells enhances cell motility and proliferation, and confers liver metastasis. We recently identified ezrin and the IκB-NF-κB pathway as essential for the biological properties conferred by L1 in CRC cells. Here, we studied the underlying molecular mechanisms and found that L1 enhances ezrin phosphorylation, via Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), and is required for L1–ezrin co-localization at the juxtamembrane domain and for enhancing cell motility. Global transcriptomes from L1-expressing CRC cells were compared with transcriptomes from the same cells expressing small hairpin RNA (shRNA) to ezrin. Among the genes whose expression was elevated by L1 and ezrin we identified insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2) and showed that its increased expression is mediated by an NF-κB-mediated transactivation of the IGFBP-2 gene promoter. Expression of a constitutively activated mutant ezrin (Ezrin567D) could also increase IGFBP-2 levels in CRC cells. Overexpression of IGFBP-2 in CRC cells lacking L1-enhanced cell proliferation (in the absence of serum), cell motility, tumorigenesis and induced liver metastasis, similar to L1 overexpression. Suppression of endogenous IGFBP-2 in L1-transfected cells inhibited these properties conferred by L1. We detected IGFBP-2 in a unique organization at the bottom of human colonic crypts in normal mucosa and at increased levels throughout human CRC tissue samples co-localizing with the phosphorylated p65 subunit of NF-κB. Finally, we found that IGFBP-2 and L1 can form a molecular complex suggesting that L1-mediated signaling by the L1–ezrin–NF-κB pathway, that induces IGFBP-2 expression, has an important role in CRC progression."

The glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) and its receptor, CD44, have been implicated in this process but their precise roles are unclear. We find that CD44−/− mice have a delayed onset of EAE compared with wild type animals. Using an in vitro lymphocyte rolling assay, we find that fewer slow rolling (<1 μm/s) wild type (WT) activated lymphocytes interact with CD44−/− brain vascular endothelial cells (ECs) than with WT ECs. We also find that CD44−/− ECs fail to anchor HA to their surfaces, and that slow rolling lymphocyte interactions with WT ECs are inhibited when the ECs are treated with a pegylated form of the PH20 hyaluronidase (PEG-PH20). Subcutaneous injection of PEG-PH20 delays the onset of EAE symptoms by ∼1 day and transiently ameliorates symptoms for 2 days following disease onset. These improved symptoms correspond histologically to degradation of HA in the lumen of CNS blood vessels, decreased demyelination, and impaired CD4+ T-cell extravasation.

https://openalex.org/W2045868295,"The SIN3A-HDAC complex deacetylates histones thereby repressing gene transcription. Here we describe family with sequence similarity 60A (FAM60A), a cell cycle-regulated protein that binds to the SIN3-HDAC complex. FAM60A expression peaks during G(1) and S phases of the cell cycle in U2OS cells, in a manner similar to the G(1) regulator cyclin D1, which is a known target of SIN3-HDAC. In this light we found that FAM60A binds to SIN3-HDAC-regulated promoters such as cyclin D1 in G(1) and S phases. Cells depleted of FAM60A show increased histone acetylation at the cyclin D1 promoter and elevated levels of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein. Furthermore, depletion of FAM60A altered the periodic association of HDAC1 with the cyclin D1 promoter, increased cyclin D1 expression at all cell cycle phases, and caused premature S phase entry. The data in this study introduce FAM60A as a novel regulator of SIN3-HDAC function and gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1991120867,"Resistance to endocrine therapy in breast cancer is common. With the aim of discovering new molecular targets for breast cancer therapy, we have recently identified LMTK3 as a regulator of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα) and wished to understand its role in endocrine resistance. We find that inhibition of LMTK3 in a xenograft tamoxifen (Tam)-resistant (BT474) breast cancer mouse model results in re-sensitization to Tam as demonstrated by a reduction in tumor volume. A whole genome microarray analysis, using a BT474 cell line, reveals genes significantly modulated (positively or negatively) after LMTK3 silencing, including some that are known to be implicated in Tam resistance, notably c-MYC, HSPB8 and SIAH2. We show that LMTK3 is able to increase the levels of HSPB8 at a transcriptional and translational level thereby protecting MCF7 cells from Tam-induced cell death, by reducing autophagy. Finally, high LMTK3 levels at baseline in tumors are predictive for endocrine resistance; therapy does not lead to alteration in levels, whereas in patient’s plasma samples, acquired LMTK3 gene amplification (copy number variation) was associated with relapse while receiving Tam. In aggregate, these data support a role for LMTK3 in both innate (intrinsic) and acquired (adaptive) endocrine resistance in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2022783337,"Phagocytosis is central to bacterial clearance, but the exact mechanism is incompletely understood. Here, we show a novel and critical role for lumican, the connective tissue extracellular matrix small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan, in CD14-mediated bacterial phagocytosis. In Psuedomonas aeruginosa lung infections, lumican-deficient (Lum(-/-)) mice failed to clear the bacterium from lungs, tissues, and showed a dramatic increase in mortality. In vitro, phagocytosis of nonopsonized gram-negative Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa was inhibited in Lum(-/-) peritoneal macrophages (MΦs). Lumican co-localized with CD14, CD18, and bacteria on Lum(+/+) MΦ surfaces. Using two different P. aeruginosa strains that require host CD14 (808) or CD18/CR3 (P1) for phagocytosis, we showed that lumican has a larger role in CD14-mediated phagocytosis. Recombinant lumican (rLum) restored phagocytosis in Lum(-/-) MΦs. Surface plasmon resonance showed specific binding of rLum to CD14 (K(A) = 2.15 × 10(6) M(-1)), whereas rLumY20A, and not rLumY21A, where a tyrosine in each was replaced with an alanine, showed 60-fold decreased binding. The rLumY20A variant also failed to restore phagocytosis in Lum(-/-) MΦs, indicating Tyr-20 to be functionally important. Thus, in addition to a structural role in connective tissues, lumican has a major protective role in gram-negative bacterial infections, a novel function for small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W2036215636,"Oscillatoria agardhii agglutinin homolog (OAAH) proteins belong to a recently discovered lectin family. All members contain a sequence repeat of ~66 amino acids, with the number of repeats varying among different family members. Apart from data for the founding member OAA, neither three-dimensional structures, information about carbohydrate binding specificities, nor antiviral activity data have been available up to now for any other members of the OAAH family. To elucidate the structural basis for the antiviral mechanism of OAAHs, we determined the crystal structures of Pseudomonas fluorescens and Myxococcus xanthus lectins. Both proteins exhibit the same fold, resembling the founding family member, OAA, with minor differences in loop conformations. Carbohydrate binding studies by NMR and x-ray structures of glycan-lectin complexes reveal that the number of sugar binding sites corresponds to the number of sequence repeats in each protein. As for OAA, tight and specific binding to α3,α6-mannopentaose was observed. All the OAAH proteins described here exhibit potent anti-HIV activity at comparable levels. Altogether, our results provide structural details of the protein-carbohydrate interaction for this novel lectin family and insights into the molecular basis of their HIV inactivation properties."

We found that activated big MAP kinase 1 (BMK1) preferentially associates with PML isoform IV and disrupts PML-MDM2 interaction. Doxorubicin, a common chemotherapeutic agent, is known to promote PML-mediated p53 activation in part by promoting PML-dependent MDM2 nucleolar sequestration. We discovered that BMK1 deactivation coupled with doxorubicin synergistically enhanced MDM2 nucleolar sequestration and, consequently, promoted PML-mediated p53 upregulation leading to tumor cell apoptosis in vitro and tumor regression in vivo. Collectively, these results not only suggest that BMK1 activity has a role in suppressing p53 by blocking the interaction between PML and MDM2, but also implicate that pharmacological BMK1 inhibitor should significantly enhance the anticancer capacity of doxorubicin-based chemotherapy."

Vitamin D is known to enhance the expression of innate immune effectors, including cathelicidin LL-37, for protection against infections. In this study we performed longitudinal analyses to investigate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on macrophage responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) lipoprotein (TLR2/1L), in Canadian Dené FN participants compared to Caucasian participants. Serum 25(OH)D and LL-37 levels were evaluated by ELISA. Transcriptional responses and protein expression of TLR2/1L-induced LL-37 and other innate immune cytokines were monitored in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) before and after 8 months of vitamin D supplementation. In this study we showed that serum levels of LL-37 decreased after vitamin D supplementation in both Dené and Caucasian participants. There was no difference in TLR2/1L-induced LL-37 expression in MDMs in the two groups, either pre- or post-vitamin D supplementation. However, vitamin D supplementation markedly enhanced TLR2/1L-induced responses in MDMs e.g. IL-6, IL-12 and IL-23 among Caucasians but not in the Dené participants. In contrast, after vitamin D supplementation TLR2/1L-induced responses e.g. IL-1β, IL-8 and IL-12 were significantly reduced in the Dené MDMs. These results indicate that vitamin D supplementation enhanced TLR2/1L-induced innate immune macrophage responses in the Caucasian but not in the Dené participants. We hypothesize that cytokines may be differentially regulated in Canadian FN compared to Caucasians, in particular those that influence Th-1 and Th-17 responses required for the control of Mtb."
https://openalex.org/W2041223966,"Macrophage lineage cells such as osteoclasts and foreign body giant cells (FBGCs) form multinuclear cells by cell-cell fusion of mononuclear cells. Recently, we reported that two seven-transmembrane molecules, osteoclast stimulatory transmembrane protein (OC-STAMP) and dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP), were essential for osteoclast and FBGC cell-cell fusion in vivo and in vitro. However, signaling required to regulate FBGC fusion remained largely unknown. Here, we show that signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) deficiency in macrophages enhanced cell-cell fusion and elevated DC-STAMP expression in FBGCs. By contrast, lack of STAT6 increased STAT1 activation, significantly inhibiting cell-cell fusion and decreasing OC-STAMP and DC-STAMP expression in IL-4-induced FBGCs. Furthermore, either STAT1 loss or co-expression of OC-STAMP/DC-STAMP was sufficient to induce cell-cell fusion of FBGCs without IL-4. We conclude that the STAT6-STAT1 axis regulates OC-STAMP and DC-STAMP expression and governs fusogenic mechanisms in FBGCs."
https://openalex.org/W2134054690,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) are among the most widely prescribed medications in clinical practice. The beneficial effects of GCs in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are based on their ability to induce apoptosis, but the underlying transcriptional mechanisms remain poorly defined. Computational modeling has enormous potential in the understanding of biological processes such as apoptosis and the discovery of novel regulatory mechanisms. We here present an integrated analysis of gene expression kinetic profiles using microarrays from GC sensitive and resistant ALL cell lines and patients, including newly generated and previously published data sets available from the Gene Expression Omnibus. By applying time-series clustering analysis in the sensitive ALL CEM-C7–14 cells, we identified 358 differentially regulated genes that we classified into 15 kinetic profiles. We identified GC response element (GRE) sequences in 33 of the upregulated known or potential GC receptor (GR) targets. Comparative study of sensitive and resistant ALL showed distinct gene expression patterns and indicated unexpected similarities between sensitivity-restored and resistant ALL. We found that activator protein 1 (AP-1), Ets related gene (Erg) and GR pathways were differentially regulated in sensitive and resistant ALL. Erg protein levels were substantially higher in CEM-C1–15-resistant cells, c-Jun was significantly induced in sensitive cells, whereas c-Fos was expressed at low levels in both. c-Jun was recruited on the AP-1 site on the Bim promoter, whereas a transient Erg occupancy on the GR promoter was detected. Inhibition of Erg and activation of GR lead to increased apoptosis in both sensitive and resistant ALL. These novel findings significantly advance our understanding of GC sensitivity and can be used to improve therapy of leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W2118801561,"Synthesis of luteinizing hormone (LH) is tightly controlled by a complex network of hormonal signaling pathways that can be modulated by metabolic cues, such as insulin. One group of candidate genes that may be regulated by insulin signaling in pituitary gonadotrope cells is the FOXO subfamily of forkhead transcription factors. In this study we investigated whether FOXO1 is expressed in gonadotropes and if it can modulate LH β-subunit (Lhb) gene expression. We demonstrated that FOXO1 is expressed in murine gonadotrope cells and that insulin signaling increased FOXO1 phosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization in a PI3K-dependent manner. We also showed that FOXO1 repressed basal transcription and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) induction of both the murine and human LHB genes in LβT2 cells, suggesting that FOXO1 regulation of LHB transcription may be conserved between rodents and humans. Although we did not detect FOXO1 binding to the proximal Lhb promoter, the FOXO1 DNA binding domain was necessary for the suppression, suggesting that FOXO1 exerts its effect through protein-protein interactions with transcription factors/cofactors required for Lhb gene expression. FOXO1 repression mapped to the proximal Lhb promoter containing steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1), pituitary homeobox 1 (PTX1), and early growth response protein 1 (EGR1) binding elements. Additionally, FOXO1 blocked induction of the Lhb promoter with overexpressed SF1, PTX1, and EGR1, indicating that FOXO1 repression occurs via these transcription factors but not through regulation of their promoters. In summary, we demonstrate that FOXO1 phosphorylation and cellular localization is regulated by insulin signaling in gonadotropes and that FOXO1 inhibits Lhb transcription. Our study also suggests that FOXO1 may play an important role in controlling LH levels in response to metabolic cues."

Mechanistic insight into control of CFTR by AMPK.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5645-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). AMPK may thus limit CFTR activity in the absence of agonist stimulation. The regulation of CFTR, an ATP-gated channel, by AMPK is consistent with the known homeostatic role of AMPK in maintaining energy stores by inhibiting energy-consuming processes and activating energy-generating processes in the cell under conditions of metabolic stress. However, further molecular details of this regulation, including the importance of AMPK binding to CFTR and the potential involvement of additional proteins, are unknown. Early studies performed in Xenopus oocytes suggested that both the COOH-terminal half of the AMPK-α1 catalytic subunit, the region of AMPK that interacts with CFTR, and an active kinase domain within AMPK-α1 were required for AMPK-dependent regulation of CFTR (15Hallows K.R. Raghuram V. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. Inhibition of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator by novel interaction with the metabolic sensor AMP-activated protein kinase.J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, the role of AMPK binding to CFTR has not been explicitly tested in cells. Additionally, the potential role of other accessory proteins in the AMPK-dependent regulation of CFTR is unclear. Along these lines, the nucleoside diphosphate kinase A (NDPK-A) has been recently reported to interact and co-localize with AMPK in respiratory tract epithelium, and there may be an important functional inter-regulation between these two kinases (19Treharne K.J. Best O.G. Mehta A. The phosphorylation status of membrane-bound nucleoside diphosphate kinase in epithelia and the role of AMP.Mol. Cell Biochem. 2009; 329: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Like AMPK, NDPK (also known as Nm23 and NME) is a multifunctional, ubiquitously distributed hexameric histidine kinase with multiple isoforms (including NDPK-A, B, C, and D in humans; group I NDPK isoforms) (20Boissan M. Dabernat S. Peuchant E. Schlattner U. Lascu I. Lacombe M.L. The mammalian Nm23/NDPK family. From metastasis control to cilia movement.Mol. Cell Biochem. 2009; 329: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). NDPKs catalyze the transfer of phosphates from nucleoside triphosphates to nucleoside diphosphates and are involved in regulating a variety of fundamental cellular processes, including growth and development, G-protein signaling, metastasis, transcriptional regulation, and DNA repair (20Boissan M. Dabernat S. Peuchant E. Schlattner U. Lascu I. Lacombe M.L. The mammalian Nm23/NDPK family. From metastasis control to cilia movement.Mol. Cell Biochem. 2009; 329: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). NDPK catalytic function requires autophosphorylation at the catalytic His-118 residue. The nearby Ser-120 residue may also be a target for phosphorylation, which appears to play an important role in determining NDPK function, because Ser-120 mutations affect motility and the metastatic potential of cancer cells (19Treharne K.J.

The studies conducted herein were performed to better define the mechanisms of CFTR inhibition by AMPK. The role of AMPK binding to CFTR was tested by introduction of a blocking peptide corresponding to the tract in CFTR that binds AMPK (CFTR-1420-57) into cells prior to biochemical and electrophysiological studies. The role of NDPK-A in the regulation of CFTR by AMPK was tested through expression of WT and mutant NDPK-A in cells for electrophysiological studies. Finally, the AMPK-dependent regulation of NDPK-A phosphorylation was further clarified. All chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Human bronchial epithelial (16HBE14o−) cells were cultured in medium 199 containing FBS as described (23Cozens A.L. Yezzi M.J. Kunzelmann K. Ohrui T. Chin L. Eng K. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H.

Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore) by semi-dry electrophoretic transfer, and prestained markers were used to confirm transfer. The blots were probed with primary antibodies to NDPK-A (1:1000), rabbit polyclonal antibody raised to nm23-H1 (Santa Cruz); or AMPK-α (1:5000), rabbit polyclonal antibody, gifts of D. Carling (MRC Hammersmith London) and D. G. Hardie (Dundee); or CFTR (1:1000), monoclonal antibody, R & D Systems (Minneapolis); or CFTR (1:1000), monoclonal antibody, transgene MATG103 (Strasbourg) and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2000) followed by SuperSignal chemiluminescence detection (Pierce). NDPK was partially purified from a membrane fraction obtained from ovine tracheal epithelium using a chelating Sepharose fast flow column (20 ml) charged with ferric chloride. The membrane fraction solubilized with 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 in buffer A (0.1 m acetic acid/NaOH, pH 5.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.4 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzol-sulfonylfluoride) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was incubated at 4 °C for 1 min with ATP (50 nm) and then applied to a chelating Sepharose fast flow column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was then washed with buffer A, and bound phosphoproteins were selectively eluted with 20 mm sodium biphosphate in buffer A. Membrane proteins (100–500 μg) were resuspended in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 0.3 m aprotonin, 0.2 m PMSF). The mixture was then precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads (30 min at 4 °C) and centrifuged at 4 °C at 350 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was incubated with primary antibody to CFTR (1 μg) for 1 h at 4 °C. New beads were added, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The mixture was then centrifuged at 350 × g for 5 min. The pelleted beads were washed five times in 1 ml of IP buffer containing 1 m NaCl. The pelleted beads were then washed twice in 10 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.9, containing 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100. For the overlay assays, proteins from ovine tracheal epithelial membranes solubilized in 10 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.9 containing Chaps detergent (0.1% w/v) were then separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membranes. NDPK-A (100 μg protein) in 1× TBS containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk was then overlaid onto the PVDF and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Following washes with 1× TBS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (four times for 15 min each), the blots were probed with antibodies to NDPK-A (1:1000) and AMPK (1:5000). Co-IP experiments were performed on lysates from Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNAs to express human CFTR and HA-tagged rat AMPK-α1 (5 ng/oocyte of each cRNA) 2 days prior to experimentation. A peptide corresponding to residues 1420–1457 of CFTR (CFTR-1420-57) was synthesized by the University of Pittsburgh Genomics and Proteomics Core Laboratories. This peptide (or vehicle) was microinjected into the oocytes 2–4 h prior to lysis. CFTR was immunoprecipitated (IP'd) from lysates (∼50 oocytes/condition) using the M24-1 anti-CFTR mouse monoclonal antibody (2.5 μg/IP; R & D Systems). Following SDS-PAGE and transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, immunoblotting was performed using HA.11 (Covance; 1:500) anti-HA and M3A7 (Millipore; 1:700) anti-CFTR mouse monoclonal antibodies. Whole cell lysate samples (5–10% of input) were run alongside co-IP lanes, and bands were quantitated by densitometry to determine the percentage of IP'd and co-IP'd proteins for various conditions, with corrections for differences in exogenous protein expression levels, as described previously (24Carattino M.D. Edinger R.S. Grieser H.J. Wise R. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Johnson J.P. Kleyman T.R. Hallows K.R.

Chem. 2005; 280: 17608-17616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Paired t tests were performed to determine the significance of differences between blocking peptide-treated samples and controls. HEK-293 cells were co-transfected 1 day after plating using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with plasmids to express CFTR and either NH2-terminal GST-tagged AMPK-α1 or GST alone 2 days prior to lysis for in vivo GST pulldown assays, based on previously described methods (15Hallows K.R. Raghuram V. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. Inhibition of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator by novel interaction with the metabolic sensor AMP-activated protein kinase.J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). On the day between transfection and lysis, 100 μm CFTR-1420-57 peptide (or vehicle) was transduced into cells using the BioPORTER® reagent (Genlantis) as per the manufacturer's recommendations. After washes in ice-cold PBS, the cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), and total protein concentration was estimated using the Bradford assay. Lysate samples (∼1 mg of total cellular protein lysate/condition in equal volumes) were then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads on a rotator overnight at 4 °C to bind GST fusion proteins and any interacting proteins. After washing the beads in lysis buffer, elution at 65 °C for 15 min in sample buffer, SDS-PAGE, and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, immunoblotting was performed for either CFTR or GST using M3A7 or GST-HRP antibodies, respectively. Whole cell lysate samples (5% of input) were run alongside GST pulldown samples, and the bands were quantitated by densitometry to determine relative binding of AMPK to CFTR, as described above. Calu-3 cells were maintained in 1:1 DMEM/F-12 medium, 10% FBS, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and measurements of CFTR whole cell conductance were performed as described (16Hallows K.R. McCane J.E. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. Regulation of channel gating by AMP-activated protein kinase modulates cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator activity in lung submucosal cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 998-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Two days prior to patch clamp experiments, the cells were plated onto 25-mm glass coverslips in 35-mm plastic dishes at a concentration of 8–10 × 105 cells/dish. CFTR-1420-57 peptide + GFP (versus GFP alone) were transduced into cells using the BioPORTER® reagent 1 day prior to patch clamp experiments. The cells were identified for patching by their green fluorescence. Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed with 1 μm forskolin in the bath solution. The bath and pipette solutions used have been described previously (25Huang P. Trotter K. Boucher R.C. Milgram S.L. Stutts M.J. PKA holoenzyme is functionally coupled to CFTR by AKAPs.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: C417-C422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Current-time and current-voltage (I-V) plots were generated by stepping from a holding potential of −20 mV to −100 through +100 mV in steps of 20 mV. Comparison of slope conductance values between the two groups was performed at +40 mV, and unpaired t tests were used to test the significance of differences between conditions. Xenopus oocytes were prepared for two-electrode voltage clamp (TEV) measurements as previously described (15Hallows K.R. Raghuram V. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. Inhibition of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator by novel interaction with the metabolic sensor AMP-activated protein kinase.J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, harvested oocytes were injected with cRNAs generated using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) to express wild-type human CFTR (1–2 ng) and NH2-terminal V5 epitope-tagged wild-type or mutant NDPK-A cloned into the dual mammalian and oocyte expression vector pMO (5 ng), and the oocytes were used 2–3 days post-injection for experimentation. Either 32 nl of 40 mm potassium gluconate (control) or potassium 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside monophosphate (ZMP), a direct cellular AMPK activator (26Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside. A specific method for activating AMP-activated protein kinase in intact cells?.Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar), was microinjected into oocytes, and the oocytes were used within 6 h for measurements (17King Jr., J.D. Fitch A.C. Lee J.K.

Cell Physiol. 2009; 297: C94-C101Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Once a stable base line was achieved, 1 μm forskolin and 0.1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) were bath applied via perfusion manifold to stimulate CFTR conductance. Evoked current was measured using voltage ramps from −20 to +60 mV (15Hallows K.R. Raghuram V. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. Inhibition of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator by novel interaction with the metabolic sensor AMP-activated protein kinase.J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The degree of AMPK-dependent inhibition of stimulated CFTR conductance was determined in at least 20 oocytes/condition derived from at least three separate frogs. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) factorial model was used to compare TEV data obtained from different batches of oocytes, as described (15Hallows K.R. Raghuram V. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. Inhibition of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator by novel interaction with the metabolic sensor AMP-activated protein kinase.J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In another set of TEV experiments, CFTR-1420-57 peptide was microinjected into oocytes (final concentration, 20 μm) to disrupt AMPK-CFTR interaction. TEV measurements of peptide-injected oocytes were compared with vehicle-injected oocytes; both groups were co-injected with ZMP to activate AMPK. In vitro phosphorylation studies were performed as described (24Carattino M.D. Edinger R.S. Grieser H.J. Wise R. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Johnson J.P. Kleyman T.R. Hallows K.R.

HEK-293 cells were transfected with either wild-type NDPK-A or NDPK-A mutants (H118F, S120A, S120D, S120E, S122A, and S122D) and then lysed 1–2 days later for NDPK-A IP using 1.2 μg of anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Highly purified, recombinant active (α1-T172D, β1, γ1) or kinase-deficient (α1-D157A, β1, γ1) rat AMPK holoenzyme (27Neumann D. Woods A. Carling D. Wallimann T. Schlattner U.

In some studies, AMPK-phosphorylated samples were subjected to an established acid treatment protocol to distinguish acid-labile (i.e., His) phosphorylated residues from acid-stable Ser/Thr linkages, as previously described (28Muimo R. Hornickova Z. Riemen C.E. Gerke V. Matthews H. Mehta A. Histidine phosphorylation of annexin I in airway epithelia.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36632-36636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, IP'd NDPK-A samples on protein A/G beads that had already been phosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP were then subjected to acid (or control) washes (± addition of 10 μl of 1 n HCl to the wash buffer to adjust the pH to 1.0) for 30 min prior to elution in Laemmli sample buffer. SDS-PAGE, transfer, immunoblotting, and phosphoscreen imaging of the same nitrocellulose membrane were then performed. For all conditions, the ratio of the phosphorylation signal to the immunoblot signal of the NDPK-A band on the membrane was compared to derive relative phosphorylation levels, as described (24Carattino M.D. Edinger R.S.

https://openalex.org/W2067724860,"Protective antigen (PA), a key component of anthrax toxin, mediates the entry of lethal factor (LF) or edema factor (EF) through a membranal pore into target cells. We have previously reported the isolation and chimerization of cAb29, an anti-PA monoclonal antibody that effectively neutralizes anthrax toxin in an unknown mechanism. The aim of this study was to elucidate the neutralizing mechanism of this antibody in vitro and to test its ability to confer post-exposure protection against anthrax in vivo. By systematic evaluation of the steps taking place during the PA-based intoxication process, we found that cAb29 did not interfere with the initial steps of intoxication, namely its ability to bind to the anthrax receptor, the consecutive proteolytic cleavage to PA63, oligomerization, prepore formation, or LF binding. However, the binding of cAb29 to the prepore prevented its pH-triggered transition to the transmembranal pore, thus preventing the last step of intoxication, i.e. the translocation of LF/EF into the cell. Epitope mapping, using a phage display peptide library, revealed that cAb29 binds the 2α1 loop in domain 2 of PA, a loop that undergoes major conformational changes during pore formation. In vivo, we found that 100% of anthrax-infected rabbits survived when treated with cAb29 12 h after exposure. In conclusion, these experiments demonstrate that cAb29 exerts its potent neutralizing activity in a unique manner by blocking the prepore-to-pore conversion process.

Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, exerts its toxicity via the dissemination of a tripartite exotoxin composed of protective antigen (PA), 2The abbreviations used are: PAprotective antigenLFlethal factorEFedema factorLeTxlethal toxinXTTsodium 2,3,-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)-carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium inner salt. lethal factor (LF), and edema factor (EF). Cell intoxication involves several steps, the first of which is the binding of PA83 to its cellular receptor (TEM8 or CMG2). Following binding, a 20-kDa region is proteolytically removed by a furin-like protease, whereas the remaining PA63 forms an oligomeric structure (heptamer or octamer, also referred to as a prepore) that binds EF or LF to form edema toxin or lethal toxin (LeTx), respectively. Following endocytosis of the prepore-EF/LF complex, an acid-driven prepore-to-pore conversion occurs, thus promoting the entry of EF/LF into the cytosol, where they exert their toxic effects (1Young J.A. Collier R.J. Anthrax toxin: receptor binding, internalization, pore formation, and translocation.Annu. Rev.

Anthrax is considered a biological threat, and B. anthracis is classified as a category A agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Currently, a three-dose vaccination schedule for anthrax using PA-based vaccine is indicated by the Food and Drug Administration as the post-exposure treatment together with a prolonged antibiotic regimen (2Friedlander A.M. Welkos S.L. Ivins B.E. Anthrax vaccines.Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 271: 33-60PubMed Google Scholar, 3Grabenstein J.D. Vaccines: countering anthrax: vaccines and immunoglobulins.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2008; 46: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, in cases where disease has progressed and a substantial amount of anthrax toxins has been delivered to the bloodstream, or when antibiotic-resistant B. anthracis strains are involved, these treatments will be less effective, highlighting the need for additional post-exposure treatment. To this end, passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies directed against either PA or LF was suggested as a complementary treatment that can provide immediate, specific, and low toxicity protection (4Albrecht M.T. Li H. Williamson E.D. LeButt C.S. Flick-Smith H.C. Quinn C.P. Westra H. Galloway D. Mateczun A. Goldman S. Groen H. Baillie L.W.

Microbiol. 2004; 40: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Indeed, over the past decade, extensive research was carried out to develop therapeutic antibodies that target anthrax toxins and can provide protection either when given alone or when given with antibiotic treatment (6Froude 2nd, J.W Thullier P. Pelat T. Antibodies against anthrax: mechanisms of action and clinical applications.Toxins. 2011; 3: 1433-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The neutralizing mechanisms of these antibodies were shown to span almost every step of the intoxication process, including the inhibition of PA-receptor interaction, proteolytic cleavage, heptamerization, internalization, and EF/LF binding. We have previously isolated a monoclonal antibody, mab29, which possesses a highly potent LeTx neutralization activity, and converted it to a human IgG1-based chimeric antibody (cAb29), which was able to confer full protection to guinea pigs when given prior to infection with 40 LD50 B. anthracis spores (7Mazor O.

The main goals of this study were to characterize the LeTx-neutralizing mechanism of cAb29 by systematic biochemical examination of the influence of this antibody on the hallmark steps in the PA-based intoxication process and to test its ability to confer post-exposure protection against anthrax in vivo. PA and LF were purified by Q-Sepharose chromatography, essentially as described previously (9Reuveny S. White M.D. Adar Y.Y. Kafri Y. Altboum Z. Gozes Y. Kobiler D. Shafferman A. Velan B.

Isolation and chimerization of a highly neutralizing antibody conferring passive protection against lethal Bacillus anthracis infection.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography on HiTrap protein G/A (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions and dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.4. The xCELLigence system (Roche Applied Science) was employed to measure the changes in cellular impedance following the addition of PA. Initial background measurements were carried out from 0.1% gelatin-coated E-plates (Roche Applied Science) filled with cell culture medium (EGM-2, Lonza Clonetics) followed by the addition of human vascular endothelial cells (Lonza Clonetics; 10,000 cells/well). Cells were grown overnight (37 °C, 5% CO2) until growth plateau was achieved. Cells were treated with the indicated compounds, and the cell index values were obtained immediately following ligand stimulation every 20 s. Cell index values are normalized to parallel values recorded in vehicle-treated wells. PA was incubated with furin (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature in the absence or presence of neutralizing antibody (1:1 molar ratio). Samples were then resolved on a 4–15% SDS-PAGE and visualized using silver stain. PA83 (5 μg, 60 pmol) was incubated with trypsin (5 ng) for 30 min at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of a 5-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor. The nicked PA was incubated with LF (60 pmol) for 20 min at room temperature, resolved on a 4–16% native gel (Novex), and visualized with Coomassie Blue. To obtain purified PA63 oligomers (prepore), nicked PA (2 mg) was desalted and loaded on a HiTrap Q-column (GE Healthcare) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and the prepore fraction was eluted by 1 m NaCl gradient (10Mogridge J. Cunningham K. Collier R.J. Stoichiometry of anthrax toxin complexes.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Prepore was converted into the SDS-resistant pore by incubation in low pH (50 mm MES buffer, pH 5.5, 150 mm NaCl), resolved on a 7% SDS-PAGE gel, and visualized with silver stain. Binding studies were carried out using the Octet RED system (ForteBio) that measures bio-layer interferometry. All steps were performed at 30 °C with shaking at 1500 rpm in a 96-well plate containing 200 μl of solution in each well. Streptavidin-coated biosensors were used throughout this study, and analytes (10 μg/ml) were diluted in PBS buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. Biosensors were loaded with biotinylated antibodies (50 μg/ml) for 300 s followed by wash. Binding and dissociation were measured as changes over time in light interference, and curves are presented after subtraction of parallel measurements from unloaded biosensors. Toxin cytotoxicity and neutralizing antibody activity were determined essentially as described previously (8Rosenfeld R. Marcus H. Ben-Arie E. Lachmi B.E. Mechaly A. Reuveny S. Gat O. Mazor O.

Cells (30 × 103/well) were incubated for 5 h with either PA83 or PA prepore (10 ng/ml) in the presence of LF (100 ng/ml) and different concentrations of neutralizing antibodies. Cell viability was determined using the XTT assay (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel), and the percentage of cell survival was plotted against antibody concentration. New Zealand white rabbits (2.5–3 kg) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). All animal experiments were performed in accordance with Israeli law and were approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments at the Israel Institute for Biological Research. Animals were maintained at 20–22 °C and a relative humidity of 50 ± 10% on a 12-h light/dark cycle, fed with commercial rodent chow (Koffolk Inc.), and provided with tap water ad libitum. Treatment of animals was in accordance with regulations outlined in the United States Department of Agriculture Animal Welfare Act and the conditions specified in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health, 1996). For pharmacokinetics studies, rabbits were injected intravenously with 1 mg of purified cAb29, and blood samples were drawn at different time points. Antibody concentration in the blood samples was determined by ELISA using PA-coated 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary anti-human antibody for detection. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the PK Solutions software (Summit Research Services). For challenge experiments, animals were inoculated via the respiratory route by intranasal instillation of 5 × 106 cfu of fully virulent Vollum spores (200 LD50). The infected rabbits were treated with different doses of purified cAb29 antibody given intravenously at the indicated time points. Animal viability was monitored for at least 14 days. The Ph.D.-7 phage display library kit (New England Biolabs) was used for panning against immobilized cAb29 antibody, essentially as recommended by the manufacturer. After three rounds of selection, individual phage clones were isolated and tested for specific binding to cAb29 by ELISA. The positive clones were subjected to DNA sequencing to deduce the amino acid sequence of the presented peptides. The peptide sequences from the positive phages were aligned with ClustalW software. cAb29 is a chimeric antibody that was selected from a large panel of PA-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (8Rosenfeld R. Marcus H. Ben-Arie E. Lachmi B.E. Mechaly A. Reuveny S. Gat O. Mazor O. Ordentlich A. Isolation and chimerization of a highly neutralizing antibody conferring passive protection against lethal Bacillus anthracis infection.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It was shown that if given to guinea pigs prior to infection, cAb29 can provide full protection against anthrax. Here, we first sought to evaluate its ability to confer post-exposure protection in the stricter model of anthrax infection, namely infection by the respiratory route. Because the ability of the antibody to neutralize PA in vivo is a function of its residence time in the blood (8Rosenfeld R. Marcus H. Ben-Arie E. Lachmi B.E. Mechaly A. Reuveny S. Gat O. Mazor O. Ordentlich A. Isolation and chimerization of a highly neutralizing antibody conferring passive protection against lethal Bacillus anthracis infection.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we first determined the pharmacokinetic profile of the chimeric antibody following intravenous administration to rabbits. Blood samples were drawn at different time points after administration, antibody levels were determined by ELISA, and the obtained data were fitted to a one-compartment, first-order elimination model (Fig. 1A). The cAb29 antibody exhibited a biphasic elimination profile with mean resident time of 82 h. The first elimination phase (α) displayed a t½ value of 4 h (5% of area under the curve), whereas the second phase (β) was significantly longer, with t½ of 59 h. The prophylaxis efficacy of cAb29 was evaluated in rabbits that were intranasally infected with 5 × 106 cfu of Vollum spores (200 LD50). Under these conditions, all untreated rabbits rapidly developed respiratory anthrax and died within 2 days (Fig. 1B). Based upon the pharmacokinetic profile of the chimeric antibody, we decided to administer the antibody in two successive treatments, given 12 and 60 h after infection. Treatment with a low dose of antibody (0.1 mg/kg each) did not provide protection but prolonged the mean time to death. A slight increase in antibody to two doses of 0.2 mg/kg each resulted in 20% rabbit survival. All animals treated twice with 1 mg/kg survived the challenge with no evident disease within 14 days after challenge. The finding that cAb29 is highly potent in vivo encouraged us to continue and explore its PA neutralization mechanism. To this end, we systematically examined the effect of cAb29 on the hallmark steps in the PA-based intoxication process. The first event in LeTx intoxication involves the binding of PA83 to one of its specific cellular receptors, TEM8 or CMG2 (12Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Young J.A. Identification of the cellular receptor for anthrax toxin.Nature. 2001; 414: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 13Scobie H.M. Rainey G.J. Bradley K.A. Young J.A. Human capillary morphogenesis protein 2 functions as an anthrax toxin receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 5170-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether cAb29 hampers PA83-cell receptor binding, we utilized the cellular impedance assay (using the xCELLigence system), which allows detection of physiological responses of cells, such as morphology, cell adhesion, and viability, expressing them as a change in cell index (14Yu N. Atienza J.M. Bernard J. Blanc S. Zhu J. Wang X. Xu X. Abassi Y.A. Real time monitoring of morphological changes in living cells by electronic cell sensor arrays: an approach to study G protein-coupled receptors.Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Loss of cell adhesion in this system would generate a reduction in cell index, whereas increase in cell adhesion (usually seen after receptor binding) would result in an increase in cell index. Here, primary culture of human vascular endothelial cells was used as a model. These cells were found to obtain a minimal “transient negative phase,” which allows a more accurate monitoring of rapid changes in cell impedance following receptor binding. The addition of PA (25 nm) to these cells results in a typical change in cellular impedance starting 10 min following stimulation and returning to the resting cell index within 60 min (Fig. 2A). A similar pattern was observed when PA was added to the cells in the presence of a nonspecific antibody or in the presence of the neutralizing antibody cAb29 (125 nm), suggesting that this antibody does not interfere with the binding of PA to its receptor. In addition, cAb29 did not affect the binding of biotinylated PA to cultured cells, as judged by Western blot analysis (data not shown). After PA83 binds to its cell surface receptor, a 20-kDa fragment (PA20) is cleaved by furin-like proteases, thus enabling the subsequent oligomerization of PA and the exposure of a large hydrophobic surface that later on facilitates binding of either LF or EF. In vitro, incubation of PA with furin results in the formation of PA63 that remains associated to PA20 (referred to as nicked PA), and the two fragments can be dissociated and resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B). To determine whether cAb29 inhibits the proteolysis of PA by furin, the antibody was incubated with PA prior to furin addition. It was found that the presence of cAb29 has no effect on this process as judged by the appearance of PA63 (Fig. 2B). As a control, we used another anti-PA-neutralizing antibody, Ab33. This antibody was isolated from the same pool of PA-neutralizing antibodies as cAb29 and exhibited high neutralization potency both in vitro and in vivo (7Mazor O. Ben-Arie E. Mechaly A. Rosenfeld R. Marcus H. Ordentlich A. Combination of anthrax-toxin neutralizing antibodies: analysis of synergy/antagonism effect.in: Shafferman A. Ordentlich A. Velan B.

Mazor O. Ordentlich A. Isolation and chimerization of a highly neutralizing antibody conferring passive protection against lethal Bacillus anthracis infection.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, based on the binding pattern in ELISA, it was previously suggested that cAb29 and Ab33 bind PA at nonoverlapping epitopes (7Mazor O. Ben-Arie E. Mechaly A. Rosenfeld R. Marcus H. Ordentlich A. Combination of anthrax-toxin neutralizing antibodies: analysis of synergy/antagonism effect.in: Shafferman A. Ordentlich A. Velan B. The challenge of highly pathogenic microorganisms.

Isolation and chimerization of a highly neutralizing antibody conferring passive protection against lethal Bacillus anthracis infection.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Indeed, Ab33 significantly inhibited PA proteolysis by furin (Fig. 2B). To use Ab33 as an internal control throughout the rest of this study, we performed a pairwise mapping analysis to verify that these two antibodies can bind different epitopes on PA. To this end, we used the Octet RED bio-layer interferometry system, in which binding of molecules to the biosensor causes a wavelength shift in the interference pattern, which can be measured in real time. In this experiment, binding of PA to a cAb29-coated biosensor resulted in a wavelength shift, and the addition of Ab33 to this complex resulted in an additional shift, indicating that these two antibodies indeed bind different, nonoverlapping epitopes on PA (Fig. 2C). Although in vitro cleavage of PA results in the formation of PA63 and PA20, these two subunits do not readily dissociate from each other, therefore preventing the spontaneous oligomerization of PA63 (15Petosa C. Collier R.J. Klimpel K.R. Leppla S.H. Liddington R.C. Crystal structure of the anthrax toxin protective antigen.Nature. 1997; 385: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). However, the addition of LF or EF to nicked PA releases PA20 and induces the spontaneous oligomerization of PA63 to its prepore form, which appears as a flat and discrete band in native PAGE analysis (Fig. 3A). The fact that the formation of the prepore can be initiated by the addition of LF was utilized as a tool for determining the role of the different antibodies in prepore formation. As can be expected, the formation of the prepore was not affected by the presence of a nonspecific antibody that was added either before or after LF addition. However, incubation of nicked PA with Ab33 prior to the addition of LF inhibited prepore formation. In this sample, a band with a somewhat higher molecular weight than the antibody appeared, probably representing the Ab33-PA complex, the formation of which prevented the oligomerization process. When Ab33 was added to the LF-induced oligomer, this band was much fainter, probably because most of the PA was already converted to the prepore form. When cAb29 was incubated with nicked PA prior to the addition of LF, prepore was not formed, suggesting that the presence of this antibody has also inhibited the ability of LF to interact with PA. However, no prepore was observed even when the cAb29 was added to the pre-existing prepore (after LF addition). These unexpected results led us to hypothesize that cAb29 does not interfere with the process of PA oligomerization, but rather binds the oligomer and produces a high molecular weight complex that cannot be resolved on the native PAGE. To try and determine whether cAb29 can bind the prepore form of PA, another approach was taken. It was previously shown that a purified prepore fraction can be obtained without the need for LF/EF, merely by disrupting the electrostatic interactions between PA20 and PA63 using anion exchange chromatography (10Mogridge J. Cunningham K. Collier R.J. Stoichiometry of anthrax toxin complexes.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Here, nicked PA was loaded on a HiTrap Q-column, and a purified prepore form was obtained (Fig. 3B). Adding Ab33 or a nonspecific antibody to the prepore fraction had no effect on its appearance in the gel. However, when cAb29 was incubated with the purified prepore (in an equimolar concentration of antibody per calculated PA63 monomers), both bands of the prepore-associated antibody and the antibody itself were diminished, thus supporting the notion that cAb29 forms high molecular weight complexes with the prepore. To further verify that cAb29 can bind the preformed oligomer, we again utilized the Octet RED apparatus. If PA83 monomer was used as the analyte and allowed to interact with cAb29- or Ab33-coated biosensors, classic 1:1 association/dissociation kinetics were obtained for both antibodies, with slight differences between them (cAb29 has a higher kon and a somewhat lower koff) (Fig. 3C). However, if the purified prepore fraction was used as the analyte, a binding curve was observed only for the cAb29-coated biosensor (Fig. 3D), supporting the overall findings presented so far. The next step of LeTx intoxication that follows the spontaneous oligomerization of PA63 on the cell surface is binding of three to four LF or EF units to the exposed hydrophobic subunit-subunit interface (16Cunningham K. Lacy D.B. Mogridge J. Collier R.J. Mapping the lethal factor and edema factor binding sites on oligomeric anthrax protective antigen.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7049-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Here, we took advantage of the fact that we can monitor the binding of the antibody to the purified prepore in the Octet RED system to determine whether its presence will affect the binding of LF to the prepore. To this end, a cAb29-coated Octet RED biosensor was saturated with the purified prepore, and after removal of prepore excess, a baseline was set. In theory, one molecule of fixed antibody is enough to bind one molecule of oligomer, hence leaving several antibody binding sites unoccupied on each oligomer. We therefore added another step in which the cAb29-prepore complex was incubated again with free cAb29 to saturate all antibody binding sites (Fig. 4A, 0–280 s). The complex was then immersed in LF, resulting in another significant wavelength shift (∼0.4 nm) that clearly indicates that LF can bind to the cAb29-prepore saturated complex. Similarly, adding LF to the bound prepore before saturating the cAb29 binding sites resulted in the same wavelength shift amplitude (∼0.4 nm) and interference pattern as seen before (compare Fig. 4B, 0–280 s with Fig. 4A, 280–550 s). Moreover, saturating the LF-bound complex with cAb29 also revealed a similar shift and pattern as seen earlier. It can be therefore concluded that the binding of cAb29 to the prepore complex does not interfere with the subsequent binding of LF, and vice versa, and that the two molecules bind different sites. It was previously shown that PA can be cleaved in the bloodstream, thus forming soluble heptamers that complex with EF/LF and bind their cellular receptor (17Kintzer A.F. Sterling H.J. Tang I.I. Abdul-Gader A. Miles A.J. Wallace B.A. Williams E.R. Krantz B.A. Role of the protective antigen octamer in the molecular mechanism of anthrax lethal toxin stabilization in plasma.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 399: 741-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In vitro, this process can be simulated by incubating the purified prepore fraction with LF and then intoxicating the cells. Because cAb29 can bind to the prepore-LF complex, we asked whether the antibody will be able to neutralize the toxic activity of this preformed complex. In the classic LeTx neutralization assay, cultured J774A macrophages are exposed to a lethal dose of PA83 and LF in the presence of increasing antibody concentration, and cell survival is determined 5 h later. In this format, both cAb29 and Ab33 can protect the cells, and the effective concentration needed to neutralize 50% of LeTx activity (EC50) was 140 and 450 ng/ml for cAb29 and Ab33, respectively (Fig. 4C). In the second scenario, cells were exposed directly to the prepore-LF complex (calibrated to >90% cell killing) in the presence of increasing concentrations of cAb29 and Ab33 antibodies, and cell survival was monitored. It was found that under these conditions, only cAb29 could neutralize the toxicity of the preformed LF-oligomer complex, whereas antibody Ab33, which cannot bind the prepore form, had no effect on cell survival (Fig. 4D). The internalization of the receptor-bound prepore oligomer into the acidic endosome enables the prepore to undergo a major conformational change, which mainly involves the large disordered flexible"

Glucocorticoids are potent enhancers of IL-7Rα expression with diverse roles in T cell biology. Here we identify the transcriptional repressor, growth factor independent-1 (Gfi1), as a novel intermediary in glucocorticoid-induced IL-7Rα up-regulation. We found Gfi1 to be a major inhibitory target of dexamethasone by microarray expression profiling of 3B4.15 T-hybridoma cells. Concordantly, retroviral transduction of Gfi1 significantly blunted IL-7Rα up-regulation by dexamethasone. To further assess the role of Gfi1 in vivo, we generated bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice, in which a modified Il7r locus expresses GFP to report Il7r gene transcription. By introducing this BAC reporter transgene into either Gfi1-deficient or Gfi1-transgenic mice, we document in vivo that IL-7Rα transcription is up-regulated in the absence of Gfi1 and down-regulated when Gfi1 is overexpressed. Strikingly, the in vivo regulatory role of Gfi1 was specific for CD8(+), and not CD4(+) T cells or immature thymocytes. These results identify Gfi1 as a specific transcriptional repressor of the Il7r gene in CD8 T lymphocytes in vivo."

In Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic studies, the lowest O-D stretch for D(2)O was observed at ∼2200 cm(-1) in BR but was significantly higher in ASR (>2500 cm(-1)), which was previously attributed to a water molecule near the Schiff base (W402) that is H-bonded to Asp-85 in BR and Asp-75 in ASR. We investigated the factors that differentiate the lowest O-D stretches of W402 in BR and ASR. Quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculations reproduced the H-bond geometries of the crystal structures, and the calculated O-D stretching frequencies were corroborated by the FTIR band assignments. The potential energy profiles indicate that the smaller O-D stretching frequency in BR originates from the significantly higher pK(a)(Asp-85) in BR relative to the pK(a)(Asp-75) in ASR, which were calculated to be 1.5 and -5.1, respectively. The difference is mostly due to the influences of Ala-53, Arg-82, Glu-194-Glu-204, and Asp-212 on pK(a)(Asp-85) in BR and the corresponding residues Ser-47, Arg-72, Ser-188-Asp-198, and Pro-206 on pK(a)(Asp-75) in ASR. Because these residues participate in proton transfer pathways in BR but not in ASR, the presence of a strongly H-bonded water molecule near the Schiff base ultimately results from the proton-pumping activity in BR."

A tool to explore central metabolism of Aspergillus fumigatus and its role in virulence.Adv. Genet. 2007; 57: 263-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We utilized a chemical biology approach to characterize the fungal functional adaptation to changes in nutrient availability in conditions relevant to IA infection. Global proteome analysis of A. fumigatus has elucidated protein regulation and pathway responses to environmental stimuli (14Kniemeyer O. Proteomics of eukaryotic microorganisms. The medically and biotechnologically important fungal genus Aspergillus.Proteomics. 2011; 11: 3232-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, global (i.e. untargeted) proteomics provides incomplete proteome coverage and generally fails to provide quantifiable measurement of the functional activity of observed proteins because proteins are dynamic and highly regulated and often exist in inactive forms until proteolytically processed or post-translationally modified. Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) has emerged to overcome the inherent difficulty of differentiating presence versus activity and to facilitate the measurement of low abundance reactive proteins. ABPP employs specific chemical probes to observe the active protein complements of biological systems (15Lenz T. Fischer J.J. Dreger M. Probing small molecule-protein interactions. A new perspective for functional proteomics.J. Proteomics. 2011; 75: 100-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Cravatt B.F. Wright A.T. Kozarich J.W. Activity-based protein profiling. From enzyme chemistry to proteomic chemistry.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 383-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Synthetic activity-based probes (ABPs) inhibit enzymes by forming an irreversible covalent bond to the enzyme active site. Enriching and identifying ABP-tagged proteins allows proteomic annotation of function, reduces the complexity of the proteome under analysis, and measures low abundance functional proteins. Coupled with high throughput, high resolution LC-MS/MS analysis utilizing a quantitative accurate mass and time (AMT) tag approach (17Zimmer J.S. Monroe M.E. Qian W.J. Smith R.D. Advances in proteomics data analysis and display using an accurate mass and time tag approach.Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2006; 25: 450-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), environmental adaptation and metabolic response can be quantified using ABPP. During the course of IA, A. fumigatus hyphae breach host tissue and interact with serum. A. fumigatus is one of the few pathogenic organisms that readily grows in the presence of serum (18Gifford A.H. Klippenstein J.R. Moore M.M. Serum stimulates growth of and proteinase secretion by Aspergillus fumigatus.Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) due to its ability to extract iron from human transferrin in this iron-limited environment (19Hissen A.H. Chow J.M. Pinto L.J. Moore M.M. Survival of Aspergillus fumigatus in serum involves removal of iron from transferrin. The role of siderophores.Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1402-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, A. fumigatus can use serum proteins for biomass generation (20Toyotome T. Yamaguchi M. Iwasaki A. Watanabe A. Taguchi H. Qin L. Watanabe H. Kamei K. Fetuin A, a serum component, promotes growth and biofilm formation by Aspergillus fumigatus.Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2012; 302: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 21Rodrigues A.G. Araujo R. Pina-Vaz C. Human albumin promotes germination, hyphal growth, and antifungal resistance by Aspergillus fumigatus.Med. Mycol. 2005; 43: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), but the full effect of serum on the cellular processes of A. fumigatus and its relevance to disease is not fully understood. We hypothesize that A. fumigatus can adapt to this nutrient source for metabolic purposes and that fungal enzyme activity within human serum (HS) will be relevant to its metabolism, nutrient sensing, and scavenging response within the immunocompromised host environment. This information can provide valuable insight into how A. fumigatus survives in a host environment on a fundamental biological process level. Herein, we describe a novel ABP and label-free quantitative multiplexed ABPP methodology for delineating the protein activity of A. fumigatus during growth in minimal medium in response to HS as a function of growth duration. Detailed experimental procedures for the synthesis of 1 and 2 are available in the supplemental material. A. fumigatus ATCC® MYA-4609TM (AF 293) obtained from ATCC were stored at −80 °C in individual glycerol. Potato dextrose agar plates were inoculated with conidia from glycerol stocks and harvested by flooding the plate with 0.8% Tween 80 after 4 days. The conidia suspension was filtered through Miracloth (Calbiochem), and the conidia were counted by hemocytometer. For liquid culture, complete Aspergillus minimal medium (AMM; 1% glucose, 2 ml/liter Hunter's trace elements) (22Shimizu K. Keller N.P. Genetic involvement of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase in a G protein signaling pathway regulating morphological and chemical transitions in Aspergillus nidulans.Genetics. 2001; 157: 591-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with or without 10% HS was inoculated to a final concentration of 1 × 106 conidia/ml. Biomass was grown at 37 °C and agitated at 150 rpm on an orbital shaker for 24 or 48 h. HS (Sigma) was stored at −20 °C and used without further processing. AMM and AMM containing 10% HS were inoculated to 1 × 106 conidia/ml with A. fumigatus and cultured as described above. Fungal biomass was harvested in triplicate at each time point by filtering the liquid culture through Miracloth, washing the collected biomass with water, and cryodessication. The mass of the dried fungus was used to generate a growth curve (Fig. 1). Biomass was harvested at 24 and 48 h and passed through Miracloth to remove spent medium, and the retained biomass was washed with 15 ml of PBS. Excess medium was squeezed out of the biomass. The biomass was manually cut and then lysed with a Bullet Blender (NextAdvance): 0.55-mm zirconium silicate beads (0.5–1.0 ml) and PBS (1–2 volumes) (1×, pH 7.4: 11.9 mm phosphates, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl) per 5-ml tube. Lysed samples were centrifuged at 3,500 × g for 5 min, pellets were washed with PBS (1 ml) and spun at 3,500 × g for 5 min, and the combined supernatants were spun twice more. Sonication of the final combined supernatant provided global cell lysate (gcl). The gcl was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until further use. All material was generated in quadruplicate. Using a BCA assay, the protein concentration of gcl from AMM + HS 24- and 48-h growth was then normalized to 1 mg/ml protein (supplemental Fig. S1A). Alcohol dehydrogenase activity for the gcl was measured as described previously (23Kägi J.H. Vallee B.L. The role of zinc in alcohol dehydrogenase.J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 3188-3192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was performed in triplicate, and the slope was calculated using data points from 3–6 min (supplemental Fig. S1C). Citrate synthase activity was measured with a commercial kit (Sigma-Aldrich); assays were run in triplicate (supplemental Fig. S1B). A. fumigatus mycelia lysate proteomes (1 mg/ml in PBS) were treated with vinyl sulfonate 1 (20 μm) and fluorophosphonate 2 (200 μm) in a 1.5-ml vial and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Following probe incubation, proteomes were treated with click chemistry reagents and enriched by the method of Cravatt with the following changes. Peptides were obtained by treating the resin with trypsin (2 μl; trypsin was reconstituted in 40 μl of NH4HCO3 (25 mm, pH 8)) and NH4HCO3 (25 mm, pH 8; 200 μl) and subsequent incubation at 37 °C, 1,200 rpm, for 15 h. Following digestion, peptide supernatant was obtained (6,000 × g), and the pellet was washed with NH4HCO3 (25 mm, pH 8; 150 μl). The combined peptide supernatant was dried by speed vacuum, reconstituted in NH4HCO3 (25 mm, pH 8; 40 μl), and heated for 10 min at 37 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and 25 μl was collected for MS analysis. Digested peptide mixtures were measured on a Thermo Fisher Scientific LTQ Orbitrap Velos MS (San Jose, CA) as described previously (24Livesay E.A. Tang K. Taylor B.K. Buschbach M.A. Hopkins D.F. LaMarche B.L. Zhao R. Shen Y. Orton D.J. Moore R.J. Kelly R.T. Udseth H.R. Smith R.D. Fully automated four-column capillary LC-MS system for maximizing throughput in proteomic analyses.Anal. Chem. 2008; 80: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The Velos MS data were collected from 400 to 2,000 m/z at a resolution of 100,000 (automatic gain control target: 1 × 106) followed by data-dependent ion trap MS/MS spectra (AGC target: 1 × 104) of the 10 most abundant ions using a collision energy setting of 35–40% and a dynamic exclusion time of 30 or 180 s. Significant changes were determined at the unique peptide level between growth conditions or culture durations. The resulting MS data were analyzed using the AMT tag pipeline to determine relative protein abundance (17Zimmer J.S. Monroe M.E. Qian W.J. Smith R.D. Advances in proteomics data analysis and display using an accurate mass and time tag approach.Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2006; 25: 450-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). SEQUEST software (25Yates 3rd, J.R. Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Schieltz D. Method to correlate tandem mass spectra of modified peptides to amino acid sequences in the protein database.Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 1426-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar) was used to search tandem mass spectra against the UniProt A. fumigatus database (April 1, 2011). Peptide identifications filtered with an MS-generating function spectral probability score of ≤1 × 10−9 (26Kim S. Gupta N. Pevzner P.A. Spectral probabilities and generating functions of tandem mass spectra. A strike against decoy databases.J. Proteome Res. 2008; 7: 3354-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) were assembled into an A. fumigatus-specific AMT tag database. For identification, VIPER software (27Monroe M.E. Tolić N. Jaitly N. Shaw J.L. Adkins J.N. Smith R.D. VIPER. An advanced software package to support high-throughput LC-MS peptide identification.Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 2021-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) was used to correlate each AMT tag entry with a unique LC-MS feature relying on high mass measurement accuracy (MMAaverage ± 0.683 ppm) and normalized elution time accuracy (NETaverage ± 0.363%) (supplemental Tables S1–S4). Single peptides matching multiple proteins (typically protein isoforms) were removed. Proteins increasing in the presence of HS were manually verified to originate from fungus by looking at MS/MS scans (supplemental Table S5). For statistical analysis of peptide abundance, DAnTE software (28Polpitiya A.D. Qian W.J. Jaitly N. Petyuk V.A. Adkins J.N. Camp 2nd, D.G. Anderson G.A. Smith R.D. DAnTE. A statistical tool for quantitative analysis of -omics data.Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 1556-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) was used to perform ANOVA significance tests on culture comparisons; a significant difference was determined as a p value and q value of <0.05. The q value of a test measures the proportion of false positives incurred (i.e. the false discovery rate) for the analysis. Significant peptides found in at least three data sets were rolled up into protein values using Rrollup (28Polpitiya A.D. Qian W.J. Jaitly N. Petyuk V.A. Adkins J.N. Camp 2nd, D.G. Anderson G.A. Smith R.D. DAnTE. A statistical tool for quantitative analysis of -omics data.Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 1556-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). An absolute -fold change (|fc|) of ≥15, ≥2 peptides/protein, and ≥10% protein coverage were used to ensure high confidence of significantly changing proteins. Unique proteins were obtained by rolling up all unique peptides to protein and using a relative abundance cut-off of ≥18, ≥2 peptides/protein, and 10% protein coverage. Proteins were mapped to function using tools from the Aspergillus Genome Database (29Arnaud M.B. Chibucos M.C. Costanzo M.C. Crabtree J. Inglis D.O. Lotia A. Orvis J. Shah P. Skrzypek M.S. Binkley G.

Linde J. Albrecht D. Guthke R. Brakhage A.A. FungiFun. A web-based application for functional categorization of fungal genes and proteins.Fungal Genet. Biol. 2011; 48: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and the KEGG pathway user mapping tool (31Kanehisa M. Goto S. Sato Y. Furumichi M. Tanabe M. KEGG for integration and interpretation of large scale molecular data sets.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: D109-D114Crossref PubMed Scopus (3369) Google Scholar). Collection of fungal biomass at multiple time points within each culture showed strikingly different growth patterns for A. fumigatus in the presence and absence of 10% HS (Fig. 1). Culture with HS caused a large increase in biomass generation at 24 and 48 h. In the presence of HS, the fungus reaches log phase growth at 16 h, whereas in minimal medium, log phase growth is delayed until 24 h. At 48 h after liquid culture inoculation, A. fumigatus has reached stationary phase in the presence of human serum but is still in log phase growth in minimal medium. In AMM, A. fumigatus reaches stationary phase at 64 h. The decrease in biomass at subsequent time points corresponds to autolysis and death of the mycelia from nutrient deprivation or mechanical shearing forces that break down hyphae as the culture ages (32Papagianni M. Fungal morphology and metabolite production in submerged mycelial processes.Biotechnol. Adv. 2004; 22: 189-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). In developing a library of known and novel ABPs that incorporate the click chemistry-compatible alkyne moiety for attachment of azide-derivatized reporter groups, we synthesized vinyl sulfonate ester probe 1 (Fig. 2A). The clickable alkyne probe 1 was synthesized in four steps from commercially available 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (33Liu S. Zhou B. Yang H. He Y. Jiang Z.X. Kumar S. Wu L. Zhang Z.Y. Aryl vinyl sulfonates and sulfones as active site-directed and mechanism-based probes for protein-tyrosine phosphatases.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 8251-8260Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Optimized labeling conditions of A. fumigatus samples were performed at a final probe concentration of 20 μm at 37 °C for 1 h (supplemental Fig. S2); these labeling conditions were used for all further analysis with 1. Vinyl sulfonate esters are known to irreversibly inhibit cysteine proteases; however, broad labeling of distinct enzyme classes with 1 at 37 °C occurred (supplemental Fig. S2). Furthermore, treatment of purified enzymes and A. fumigatus gcl with 40× cysteine-reactive N-ethylmaleimide followed by probe labeling did not completely eradicate labeling with probe 1, suggesting covalent binding to nucleophilic amino acids other than cysteine in the probe labeling event (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S3), which is akin to prior electrophilic ABP reports (34Weerapana E.

The generality of 1 allows interrogation of a large system-wide subset of functionally active proteins in A. fumigatus.FIGURE 3Labeling of gcl of A. fumigatus with 1 and 2 in the presence and absence of HS at 24 and 48 h. A, labeling of AMM + HS 48 h gcl with 1 in the presence and absence of 40× N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) showed incomplete labeling inhibition, suggesting nucleophilic attack of 1 by non-cysteine amino acids. A distinct labeling pattern AMM + HS 48 h gcl is observed when 2 is used. B, one-dimensional SDS-PAGE fluorescent image of A. fumigatus gcl labeled with 1 and 2 showed the highest probe reactivity in AMM at 24 h (lane 1) and 48 h (lane 2). Lower enzyme reactivity was observed in AMM + HS at both time points (lanes 3 and 4). C, Coomassie-stained image of A. fumigatus gcl labeled with probes 1 and 2 showed that labeling was not dependent on protein abundance. The highest protein content corresponded to the lowest fluorescent labeling. Boxes at 102, 76, 60, and 38 kDa show the discrepancy between protein abundance and protein labeling.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To include coverage of serine hydrolases, a serine hydrolase-specific probe (2) was included in the analysis of A. fumigatus (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S5). Probe 2 contains a fluorophosphonate reactive group selective for serine hydrolases (37Gillet L.C. Namoto K. Ruchti A. Hoving S. Boesch D. Inverardi B. Mueller D. Coulot M. Schindler P. Schweigler P. Bernardi A. Gil-Parrado S. In-cell selectivity profiling of serine protease inhibitors by activity-based proteomics.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2008; 7: 1241-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and an alkyne for appending a reporter group (Fig. 2B). A probe concentration of 200 μm was optimal for labeling (supplemental Fig. S4). Probes 1 and 2 were used simultaneously to analyze the proteome of A. fumigatus grown with and without HS for 24 and 48 h. Because both probes contain the clickable alkyne tag, it is possible to conjugate both probes with one type of reporter group (i.e. biotin azide or rhodamine azide) using click chemistry. Multiplexing the ABPs permits broader coverage in a single MS measurement. Protein labeling by ABPs was independent of protein abundance. Equivalent volumes of gcl obtained from A. fumigatus in the presence and absence of HS over time were labeled with 1 and 2 (Fig. 3B). The extent of labeling of the AMM grown samples at both time points was much greater than labeling of the AMM + HS samples (Fig. 3B). In culture with HS, probe labeling was greater at 48 h than at 24 h. Strikingly, Coomassie protein staining of the gel showed higher protein content in AMM + HS samples than in the AMM samples, but probe labeling was lower (Fig. 3C). Three highly abundant proteins by protein staining in AMM + HS 24 h at 60, 80, and 102 kDa were not ABP-labeled. Later time points (4 days) showed a significant overall reduction in enzyme reactivity (supplemental Fig. S4). Our data clearly indicate that 1 and 2 probe different enzyme reactivity, and labeling is independent of protein abundance. Although probe and protein interaction at a non-catalytic residue within the active site or a ligand binding site with an adjacent nucleophile cannot be ruled out at this time (38Schmidinger H.

Technol. 2007; 5: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the differences in enzyme reactivity (fluorescent intensity) suggest that there is a different functional state of the tagged enzymes between conditions. If probe labeling was not determined by enzyme functional state, we would expect to see labeling of all proteins within a sample. Therefore, we relate the observed changes in enzyme reactivity with differences in functional activity between the samples. Global cell lysates of A. fumigatus grown in the presence and absence of HS and labeled with 1 and 2 were analyzed by LC-MS/MS, and LC-MS features were identified using quantitative peak matching to an AMT tag database (17Zimmer J.S. Monroe M.E. Qian W.J. Smith R.D. Advances in proteomics data analysis and display using an accurate mass and time tag approach.Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2006; 25: 450-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Using the above described criteria, the relative abundance of confident protein identifications were compared over time and growth conditions. When comparing protein abundance between conditions, an absolute fc cut-off of 15 was chosen for manual pathway analysis to ensure high confidence of measured changes and relevance of the reactive proteins to the culture conditions. Multiple enzyme families, including oxidoreductases, transferases, lyases, hydrolases, isomerases, and ligases, were identified in global cell lysates using ABPP. We compared reactive enzyme abundance in the presence or absence of HS at 24 h (Table 1 and supplemental Table S1). At 24 h, 239 proteins had an fc less than −2 (negative value denotes higher reactivity in AMM 24 h). Eighty-two proteins had a large enzyme reactivity difference (|fc| > 15); only one protein (acetyl-CoA carboxylase; Table 2) had higher enzyme reactivity in the presence of HS, six proteins were observed only in the absence of HS, and 81 proteins had high levels of enzyme reactivity in AMM only (Table 1 and supplemental Table S6). Mapping proteins with absolute value |fc| ≥ 15 onto Functional Catalogues (FunCat) showed enrichment of metabolism, protein synthesis, and energy functional categories (30Priebe S. Linde J.

Despite overall structural similarity, recombinant forms of the Ace and Cna ligand-binding domains exhibit significantly different affinities and binding kinetics for collagen type I (CI) in vitro. In this study, we sought to understand, in submolecular detail, the bases for these differences. Using a structure-based approach, we engineered Cna and Ace variants by altering specific structural elements within the ligand-binding domains. Surface plasmon resonance-based binding analysis demonstrated that mutations that are predicted to alter the orientation of the Ace and Cna N1 and N2 subdomains significantly affect the interaction between the MSCRAMM (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecule) and CI in vitro, including affinity, association/dissociation rates and binding ratio. Moreover, we utilized this information to engineer an Ace variant with an 11,000-fold higher CI affinity than the parent protein. Finally, we noted that several engineered proteins that exhibited a weak interaction with CI recognized more sites on CI, suggesting an inverse correlation between affinity and specificity.

MSCRAMMs found on Gram-positive bacteria typically belong to a family of cell wall anchored proteins that have similar structural organizations. In general, the N-terminal portion of these proteins contains the ligand-binding domain in the so-called A region, whereas the C-terminal half contains repeated motifs often known as the B domains that appear to extend and project the ligand-binding domain away from the bacterial surface (4Foster T.J. Höök M. Surface protein adhesins of Staphylococcus aureus.Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 484-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). The C terminus also contains the cell wall sorting motifs, including the LPXTG sequence, which is essential for sortase-dependent anchoring to the cell wall, followed by a stretch of hydrophobic residues and a short segment of positively charged amino acids (5Schneewind O.

Cna and Ace are the most extensively studied members of this family of collagen-binding MSCRAMMs. The Ace and Cna ligand-binding regions are composed of N1 and N2, subdomains that each adopt an IgG fold variant (14Symersky J.

Structural comparisons of Cna31–344 in the apo form and in complex with a synthetic collagen peptide led to the proposal of a multistep ligand-binding mechanism called the Collagen Hug (15Zong Y. Xu Y. Liang X. Keene D.R. Höök A. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. Narayana S.V. A “Collagen Hug” model for Staphylococcus aureus CNA binding to collagen.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4224-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In this model, ligand binding is initiated by a low affinity interaction between the ligand and residues present within a shallow “trench” located on the N2 subdomain. Next, the interdomain linker wraps around the triple helical collagen and repositions the N1 subdomain. Finally, the complex is stabilized when the C-terminal N2 extension, acting as a “latch,” inserts into a cleft and complements a β-sheet within the neighboring N1 subdomain (15Zong Y. Xu Y. Liang X. Keene D.R. Höök A. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. Narayana S.V. A “Collagen Hug” model for Staphylococcus aureus CNA binding to collagen.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4224-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In the resulting complex, the MSCRAMM forms an interdomain hole through which the collagen projects. Structural comparisons and mutagenesis studies indicate that Ace employs a similar ligand-binding mechanism (16Liu Q. Ponnuraj K. Xu Y. Ganesh V.K. Sillanpää J. Murray B.E. Narayana S.V. Höök M. The Enterococcus faecalis MSCRAMM ACE binds its ligand by the Collagen Hug model.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 19629-19637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of Cna31–344 and Ace32–367 indicate that the hole (consisting of the interdomain linker and the N1 and N2 subdomains) created by ligand hugging can only accommodate a single collagen triple helix. Therefore, it is likely that Cna and Ace interact with monomeric triple helix collagen but not with fibrillar collagen (15Zong Y. Xu Y. Liang X. Keene D.R. Höök A. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M.

Furthermore, Cna31–344 does not recognize gelatin or denatured collagen, indicating that the rod-like shape of the triple helix is critical for binding (15Zong Y. Xu Y. Liang X. Keene D.R. Höök A.

In addition, surface expression of Ace mediates E. faecalis adherence to collagen type IV (CIV), laminin, and dentin (20Nallapareddy S.R. Qin X. Weinstock G.M. Höök M. Murray B.E.

S. aureus strains harboring the cna gene exhibit increased virulence in animal models of staphylococcal infection, including endocarditis, arthritis, osteomyelitis, mastitis, and keratitis (18Patti J.M.

It has also been demonstrated that ace-null strains of E. faecalis are attenuated in a murine model of urinary tract infection and a rat endocarditis model (27Singh K.V. Nallapareddy S.R.

In addition, recombinant forms of Cna can be used as effective vaccine components, whereas passive immunization with Cna antibodies is protective in a S. aureus septic death mouse model (28Nilsson I.M. Patti J.M. Bremell T. Höök M. Tarkowski A. Vaccination with a recombinant fragment of collagen adhesin provides protection against Staphylococcus aureus-mediated septic death.J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2640-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Also, active immunization of rats with Ace32–367 significantly decreases the incidence of endocarditis, whereas prophylactic treatment of rats with purified Ace antibodies significantly reduces the numbers of E. faecalis isolated from vegetations as well as the number infected (27Singh K.V. Nallapareddy S.R. Sillanpää J. Murray B.E. Importance of the collagen adhesin Ace in pathogenesis and protection against Enterococcus faecalis experimental endocarditis.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000716Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Despite the high degree of structural similarity between Ace32–367 and Cna31–344, these proteins demonstrate significantly different affinities and binding kinetics for CI in vitro (8Rich R.L. Kreikemeyer B. Owens R.T. LaBrenz S. Narayana S.V. Weinstock G.M. Murray B.E. Höök M. Ace is a collagen-binding MSCRAMM from Enterococcus faecalis.J. Biol.

Chem. 2007; 282: 19629-19637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To understand the bases for these differences, we used a structure-based approach to engineer proteins harboring alterations within specific structural elements. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based binding analysis demonstrates that sequence alterations within the N1 subdomains of Ace and Cna significantly affect the stability of the interaction between the MSCRAMM and the ligand in vitro. The mutations, which are predicted to alter the orientation and range of motion of the N1 and N2 subdomains, influenced collagen affinity, rates of association/dissociation, and binding site preference. We also found that the sequence and length of the interdomain linker influenced binding of the proteins to immobilized CI and determined that although there is an optimal length for the interdomain linker, the sequence of the interdomain linker is more important. Overnight cultures of Escherichia coli strains were grown at 30 °C in LB medium (37 °C for plasmid extraction) with shaking (200 rpm). For protein expression, E. coli TOPP3 was diluted 1:100 into fresh LB medium and grown at 37 °C with shaking (250 rpm). During logarithmic growth phase, 200 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and growth was continued at 30 °C for 16 h, after which cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 20 min using a Sorvall RC 3B Plus centrifuge. Pellets were frozen at −20 °C. Ampicillin (Sigma-Aldrich) or carbenicillin (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at concentrations of 100 μg/ml. Sequence changes to the DNA regions encoding the interdomain linker and the C-D loop of ace and cna were introduced using site-directed mutagenesis (29Papworth C. Bauer J.C. Braman J. Wright D. Site-directed mutagenesis in one day with >80% efficiency.Strategies. 1996; 9: 3-4Crossref Google Scholar) or overlap extension PCR (30Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension using the polymerase chain reaction.Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar) using primers listed in supplemental Table S1 in a mixture containing Phusion polymerase (Thermo Scientific, Vantaa, Finland), HF buffer (Thermo Scientific), 50 ng of DNA template, and 200–250 nm dNTP mix (Invitrogen). Following digestion with DpnI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), PCRs generated from site-directed mutagenesis were transformed into E. coli TOPP10 using standard procedures. Purified overlap PCRs were incubated at 72 °C with Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs) and 200 nm dATP (Invitrogen) and purified using DNA clean and concentrator 5 (Zymo Research, Carlsbad, CA) prior to ligation into pGEMTeasy (Promega, Madison, WI). Sequencing was performed to verify site-directed mutagenesis and pGEMTeasy constructs containing inserts (Genewiz, Houston, TX). Following digestion with BamHI and SalI (New England Biolabs), the sequence of interest was purified from pGEMTeasy using the gel extraction kit (Zymo Research) and ligated into the previously digested expression vector, pQE30, using T4 DNA ligase (Promega). Standard procedures were followed for DNA transformation into E. coli TOPP10 cells. Final plasmids are described in supplemental Table S2. The His-tagged recombinant proteins were purified with a 5-ml nickel-charged HiTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and a 5-ml anion exchange Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) as described by Barbu et al. (31Barbu E.M. Ganesh V.K. Gurusiddappa S. Mackenzie R.C. Foster T.J. Sudhof T.C. Höök M. β-Neurexin is a ligand for the Staphylococcus aureus MSCRAMM SdrC.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000726Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Fractions obtained from the anion exchange column were concentrated and dialyzed against PBS, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Recombinant proteins were >95% pure. The concentration of the recombinant protein was determined by absorbance measured at 280 nm and calculated using the extinction coefficient for each protein. Molecular modeling studies were performed using Coot (32Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23226) Google Scholar) and Insight II (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA). To build a model of Ace in the Cna conformation, individual N1 and N2 domains of Ace (Protein Data Bank (PDB) id: 2Z1P) were superimposed on corresponding N1 and N2 domains of the crystal structures of Cna (PDB id: 2F68). Superposition based on secondary structure matching (33Krissinel E. Henrick K. Secondary-structure matching (SSM), a new tool for fast protein structure alignment in three dimensions.Acta Crystallogr D Biol.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23226) Google Scholar) was used for the superposition. One hundred and eighteen Cα atoms in the N1 subdomain and 137 Cα atoms in the N2 subdomain aligned with root mean square deviations of 1.67 and 1.50 Å, respectively. The model of the Ace molecule in the Cna conformation showed steric clashes between the N1 and N2 subdomain. To build a molecular model of the AceC4 harboring the Cna N1 region (C-D loop, D-strand, and D-D′ loop), a homology model was built using the HOMOLOGY module in the Insight II package (Accelrys, Inc.). After building a model of the Ace N1 domain with the Cna N1 region, this domain was superimposed on the Ace with Cna conformation to build a model of AceC4. The interactions of Cna31–344, Ace32–367, and the mutant derivatives with immobilized rat tail CI (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) were characterized using a Biacore 3000 (GE Healthcare/Biacore) at 25 °C. Sensor chip C1 and amine-coupling kits were obtained from the same company and used to covalently attach CI onto the sensor surface using the amine coupling procedure as recommended by the manufacturer. The matrix-free C1 chip was chosen because it can achieve low density immobilization and avoid mass transfer limitation. Also, the flat surface allows interactions to take place closer to the surface, which is beneficial when working with multivalent interaction partners and large molecules. Briefly, after the surface was activated for 2 min, 10 μl of 5 μg/ml CI solution (stock of 5 mg/ml in 0.01 n HCl was diluted in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5) was injected into the flow cell at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Approximately 440 response units (RU) of collagen were immobilized. Lower (∼150 and 180 RU) density collagen surfaces were also prepared by adjusting the activation time and volume of CI injected. A Cna surface was prepared on a separate sensor chip using 5 μg/ml Cna31–344 in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5. The reference flow cells were prepared with activation and deactivation steps where no protein was coupled. Phosphate-buffered saline (8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.005% Tween 20) was used as running buffer. Binding was performed at a relatively high flow rate of 30 μl/min, although no mass transfer was observed in the system. To regenerate the sensor surface, bound protein was removed by flowing 10 mm glycine (pH 1.5) over the surface for 1 min. Base line-corrected SPR response curves (with buffer blank run further subtracted) were used for affinity determination. For steady-state analysis, equilibrium response (Req) of each injection was collected and plotted against the concentration (A) of injected protein. A binding isotherm was fitted to the data using equation 1 (GraphPad Prism 4, GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA) to obtain the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) and binding response maximum (Rmax). Req=Rmax×A/(KD+A)(Eq. 1) Nonequilibrium data were globally fit to a predefined two-state model using the BIAevaluation software (Version 4.1). The Rmax, association and dissociation rate constants (ka1, kd1) for the binding state (A + B ↔ AB), and forward and backward rate constants (ka2, kd2) for the conformational change state (AB ↔ AB*) were obtained from the fitting with T-value ≥100 as criteria for acceptable fit. This model describes 1:1 binding of analyte to immobilized ligand followed by a conformational change in the complex (34Biacore Life SciencesBIAevaluation Software Handbook. GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA2004Google Scholar). It simply assumes that the only way AB* can dissociate to release free A is through prior conversion to the form AB, where A is Cna or Ace protein in solution, B is immobilized collagen, AB is the complex formed by binding A to B, and AB* is the complex formed by conformational change from AB. The apparent dissociation constant (KDapp) was calculated from the kinetic parameters obtained from the curve fitting. KDapp=1/((ka1/kd1)×(1+ka2/kd2))(Eq. 2) Theoretical maximum response for 1:1 binding (Rmax1:1) was calculated using Equation 3, where Rimmob is the SPR response of the protein immobilized on the sensor surface and MWsol and MWimmob are molecular weight of soluble and immobilized protein, respectively. Molecular weights for Ace and Cna are ∼39,000 and ∼36,000, respectively. Because the collagen molecule was kept at very low concentration in a low salt and low pH buffer during immobilization, the monomer (∼300 kDa) conformation was maintained. Rmax1:1=(MWsol/MWimmob)×Rimmob(Eq. 3) Molar binding ratio (N) is defined as the number of soluble proteins bound to a single immobilized molecule and is determined by comparing the experimental value Rmax with Rmax1:1. N=Rmax/Rmax1:1(Eq. 4) Superpositions of apo crystal structures of Cna31–344 and Ace32–367 are shown in Fig. 1A. Structural comparisons of the two structures revealed that the interdomain orientations of the Ace32–367 (PDB id: 2Z1P) N1 and N2 subdomains are altered by about 36° when compared with that of Cna31–344 (PDB id: 2F68) (16Liu Q.

As a result, the apo-Ace32–367 structure is in a partially open conformation with the latch partially closed, whereas Cna31–344 exhibits a latch-closed conformation (16Liu Q. Ponnuraj K. Xu Y.

Also, the association and complete dissociation of Ace32–367 with immobilized CI are rapid, and the reaction follows a one-step steady-state binding model (Fig. 1, B and C, Table 1). However, the interaction of CI with Cna31–344 is more complex, consistent with a two-state conformational change model (Fig. 1, B and C, Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for MSCRAMM/CI interactionProteinka1kd1ka2kd2KDappKDN× 104 m−1s−1× 10−2 s−1× 10−3 s−1× 10−3 s−1nmμmCna31–3447.33 (0.47)1.51 (0.14)3.28 (0.07)1.52 (0.08)66.0 (12.0)11.7 (0.4)CnaΔEAG0.30 (0.04)3.86 (0.05)14.5 (0.1)0.73 (0.01)625 (115)5.0 (0.4)CnaQ̂IE2.70 (0.15)16.0 (2.0)CnaA117.6 (2.5)3.89 (0.08)4.85 (0.4)0.46 (0.01)19.0 (3.0)12.8 (1.1)CnaA211.8 (0.5)2.46 (0.07)2.32 (0.1)1.71 (0.08)88.5 (6.5)10.0 (0.4)CnaA311.6 (1.5)15.9 (1.7)CnaA437.7 (2.0)15.5 (1.8)CnaA1A426.2 (10.5)13.6 (1.4)Ace32–36743.2 (8.6)13.7 (1.4)AceΔQIE29.0 (0.3)11.3 (1.2)AceΔETGQIE30.1 (0.8)9.6 (1.3)AceC163.0 (3.0)3.5 (0.5)AceC251.7"
https://openalex.org/W2090016213,"Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) is one of the most potent toxins for humans and a major biothreat agent. Despite intense chemical efforts over the past 10 years to develop inhibitors of its catalytic domain (catBoNT/A), highly potent and selective inhibitors are still lacking. Recently, small inhibitors were reported to covalently modify catBoNT/A by targeting Cys(165), a residue located in the enzyme active site just above the catalytic zinc ion. However, no direct proof of Cys(165) modification was reported, and the poor accessibility of this residue in the x-ray structure of catBoNT/A raises concerns about this proposal. To clarify this issue, the functional role of Cys(165) was first assessed through a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and structural studies. These data suggested that Cys(165) is more involved in enzyme catalysis rather than in structural property. Then by peptide mass fingerprinting and x-ray crystallography, we demonstrated that a small compound containing a sulfonyl group acts as inhibitor of catBoNT/A through covalent modification of Cys(165). The crystal structure of this covalent complex offers a structural framework for developing more potent covalent inhibitors catBoNT/A. Other zinc metalloproteases can be founded in the protein database with a cysteine at a similar location, some expressed by major human pathogens; thus this work should find broader applications for developing covalent inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2036530052,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase-like protein (HMGCLL1) has been annotated in the Mammalian Genome Collection as a previously unidentified human HMG-CoA lyase (HMGCL). To test the validity of this annotation and evaluate the physiological role of the protein, plasmids were constructed for protein expression in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. Protein expression in E. coli produced insoluble material. In contrast, active HMGCLL1 could be recovered upon expression in P. pastoris. Antibodies were prepared against a unique peptide sequence found in the N terminus of the protein. In immunodetection experiments, the antibodies discriminated between HMGCLL1 and mitochondrial HMGCL. Purified enzyme was characterized and demonstrated to cleave HMG-CoA to acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA with catalytic and affinity properties comparable with human mitochondrial HMGCL. The deduced HMGCLL1 sequence contains an N-terminal myristoylation motif; the putative modification site was eliminated by construction of a G2A HMGCLL1. Modification of both proteins was attempted using human N-myristoyltransferase and [(3)H]myristoyl-CoA. Wild-type protein was clearly modified, whereas G2A protein was not labeled. Myristoylation of HMGCLL1 affects its cellular localization. Upon transfection of appropriate expression plasmids into COS1 cells, immunofluorescence detection indicates that G2A HMGCLL1 exhibits a diffuse pattern, suggesting a cytosolic location. In contrast, wild-type HMGCLL1 exhibits a punctate as well as a perinuclear immunostaining pattern, indicating myristoylation dependent association with nonmitochondrial membrane compartments. In control experiments with the HMGCL expression plasmid, protein is localized in the mitochondria, as anticipated. The available results for COS1 cell expression, as well as endogenous expression in U87 cells, indicate that HMGCLL1 is an extramitochondrial hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase."

In eukaryotes, it is catalyzed by a multisubunit membrane-associated enzyme, oligosaccharyltransferase (OT). We report the high resolution structure of the C-terminal domain of eukaryotic Stt3p. Unlike its soluble β-sheet-rich prokaryotic counterparts, our model reveals that the C-terminal domain of yeast Stt3p is highly helical and has an overall oblate spheroid-shaped structure containing a membrane-embedded region. Anchoring of this protein segment to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane is likely to bring the membrane-embedded donor substrate closer, thus facilitating glycosylation efficiency. Structural comparison of the region near the WWDYG signature motif revealed that the acceptor substrate-binding site of yeast OT strikingly resembles its prokaryotic counterparts, suggesting a conserved mechanism of N-glycosylation from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Furthermore, comparison of the NMR and cryo-EM structures of yeast OT revealed that the molecular architecture of this acceptor substrate-recognizing domain has interesting spatial specificity for interactions with other essential OT subunits.

In the central reaction, a preassembled oligosaccharide moiety is transferred from a dolichol carrier (dolichol pyrophosphate-linked oligosaccharide) to an asparagine residue in the nascent polypeptide chain defined by the consensus sequon NX(T/S) (X ≠ P) (1Welply J.K.

The transferred N-glycans play essential roles in modulating protein function in many critical processes, including development, inflammation, cancer, and the immune response (3Ohtsubo K. Marth J.D.

For many higher eukaryotes, protein N-glycosylation is a highly coordinated and complex process. In the most extensively studied eukaryotic system, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, OT contains nine non-identical integral membrane protein subunits: Ost1p–Ost6p, Stt3p, Wbp1p, and Swp1p (2Knauer R. Lehle L. The oligosaccharyltransferase complex from yeast.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Among these, five subunits (Stt3p, Wbp1p, Swp1p, Ost1p, and Ost2p) are essential for the viability of the cell, whereas Ost3p and Ost6p are homologous interchangeable subunits (5Silberstein S. Gilmore R. Biochemistry, molecular biology, and genetics of the oligosaccharyltransferase.FASEB J. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).

Although the detailed enzymatic reaction mechanism and the roles of the other subunits are not yet fully understood, a multitude of experimental evidence has suggested that Stt3p contains the catalytic site (6Yan Q.

As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, eukaryotic Stt3p is highly conserved. In fact, it is the most conserved subunit in the OT complex (6Yan Q. Lennarz W.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 47692-47700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The most convincing evidence favoring this conclusion has come from the composition of the OT in some lower eukaryotes, such as trypanosomatids (9Castro O. Movsichoff F. Parodi A.J. Preferential transfer of the complete glycan is determined by the oligosaccharyltransferase complex and not by the catalytic subunit.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 14756-14760Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), as well as a few prokaryotes in which N-glycosylation occurs. In these organisms, OT is a single integral membrane protein homologous to the Stt3p subunit, such as PglB proteins in the bacteria Campylobacter jejuni (10Glover K.J. Weerapana E. Numao S.

Further studies showed that when transferred into Escherichia coli or stt3-deficient yeast cells, these single-polypeptide OTs can either enable or complement N-glycosylation in these host cells (13Feldman M.F.

The yeast oligosaccharyltransferase complex can be replaced by STT3 from Leishmania major.Glycobiology. 2009; 19: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has also been demonstrated that the introduction of Leishmania major Stt3p into yeast can replace the entire OT complex (15Nasab F.P. Schulz B.L. Gamarro F. Parodi A.J. Aebi M. All in one: Leishmania major STT3 proteins substitute for the whole oligosaccharyltransferase complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 3758-3768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the biological significance of N-glycosylation, very limited success has been achieved with regard to the structural investigation of eukaryotic OT. The scarcity of structural knowledge significantly hampers our understanding of the enzymatic mechanism of the OT complex. To date, there are only three structural reports at atomic resolution in terms of eukaryotic OT subunits: NMR structures of the minimembrane protein Ost4p from yeast (16Zubkov S. Lennarz W.J. Mohanty S. Structural basis for the function of a minimembrane protein subunit of yeast oligosaccharyltransferase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3821-3826Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and humans (17Gayen S. Kang C.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 11061-11066Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The low resolution structure (at 12 Å) of the yeast OT complex was also determined by EM techniques (19Li H. Chavan M. Schindelin H. Lennarz W.J. Structure of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex at 12 Å resolution.Structure. 2008; 16: 432-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In comparison with eukaryotic OT, the structures of prokaryotic OT are relatively well understood. Two crystal structures of the soluble C-terminal domain of the prokaryotic homologs of Stt3p have been determined in succession: the AglB protein of the archaeon P. furiosus (20Maita N. Nyirenda J. Igura M. Kamishikiryo J. Kohda D. Comparative structural biology of eubacterial and archaeal oligosaccharyltransferases.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 4941-4950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and the PglB protein of the bacterium C. jejuni (12Igura M. Maita N. Kamishikiryo J. Yamada M. Obita T. Maenaka K. Kohda D. Structure-guided identification of a new catalytic motif of oligosaccharyltransferase.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 234-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of a full-length bacterial Stt3p homolog, the PglB protein of C. lari, was determined in complex with an acceptor peptide (21Lizak C. Gerber S. Numao S. Aebi M. Locher K.P. X-ray structure of a bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase.Nature. 2011; 474: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, sequence alignment reveals that the bacterial and archaeal Stt3p homologs show very limited sequence similarities to eukaryotic Stt3p. We have previously reported the preparation and NMR assignments of the 274-residue C-terminal domain of Stt3p (residues 466–718 plus 21 His-tagged residues) in detergent micelles (22Huang C.

Mohanty S. Challenging the limit: NMR assignment of a 31-kDa helical membrane protein.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 3662-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our results revealed that the C-terminal domain of yeast Stt3p is highly helical. Here, we present the NMR structure of this 31.5-kDa helical membrane protein fragment in detergent micelles. Our results represent the feasibility of de novo structure determination of a medium-to-high molecular weight helical membrane protein fragment using solution NMR methodologies. Structural comparison of the acceptor substrate-binding site of yeast OT with that of its prokaryotic homologs suggests an evolutionarily conserved N-glycosylation mechanism. Furthermore, fitting the NMR structure of the C-terminal domain of Stt3p to the EM model provides insight into the interaction between Stt3p and other OT subunits. Samples prepared for side chain and NOE assignments included 13C,15N-double-labeled, partially deuterated (50%) 13C,2H,15N-triple-labeled, and perdeuterated 13C,2H,15N-triple-labeled protein. The labeled C-terminal domain of Stt3p samples were prepared as described previously (22Huang C. Mohanty S. Banerjee M. A novel method of production and biophysical characterization of the catalytic domain of yeast oligosaccharyltransferase.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 23Huang C. Mohanty S. Challenging the limit: NMR assignment of a 31-kDa helical membrane protein.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 3662-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All spectra were acquired at 55 °C using either a Bruker 600-MHz AVANCE spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance cryoprobe in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Auburn University or a Varian Inova 900-MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a cold probe in the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center at the University of Georgia. NMR data collected were subsequently processed using the NMRPipe program and analyzed using NMRView software (42Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe: a multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). NMR data collected for protein side chain assignments using either 13C,15N-double-labeled or highly deuterated 13C,2H,15N-triple-labeled protein samples were as follows: HBHA(CO)NH, HCCH-TOCSY and HNHA, HCC(CO)NH, and (H)CC(CO)NH, HSQC-TOCSY. For NOESY experiments, 15N-edited three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC, 13C-edited three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC, and 13C,15N-edited four-dimensional HSQC-NOESY-HSQC data were recorded. The mixing times for 15N-edited three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC, 13C-edited three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC, and 13C,15N-edited four-dimensional HSQC-NOESY-HSQC were set as 150, 110, and 150 ms, respectively. The protocol of expression of the methyl-protonated (Ile (δ1 only), Leu (13CH3,12CD3), and Val (13CH3,12CD3)) U-13C,2H,15N-labeled sample of the C-terminal domain of Stt3p was same as for the expression of the U-13C,2H,15N-labeled sample, except that 1 h prior to induction, 2-keto-3,3-d2-1,2,3,4-[13C]butyrate sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2-keto-3-methyl-d3-3-d1-1,2,3,4-[13C]butyrate sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the medium. Pulse programs for NMR experiments for site-specific methyl assignment were written in our laboratory, based mainly on the pulse schemes reported by Tugarinov and Kay (43Tugarinov V. Kay L.E. Ile, Leu, and Val methyl assignments of the 723-residue malate synthase G using a new labeling strategy and novel NMR methods.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 13868-13878Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Both three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC and four-dimensional 13C,13C-edited HSQC-NOESY-HSQC spectra were recorded for the ILV methyl-protonated sample. 16-Doxylstearic acid (16-DSA) was used as the hydrophobic paramagnetic spin probe to determine the transmembrane domain of the C-terminal domain of Stt3p in SDS micelles. Titrations were performed by stepwise addition of 16-DSA over a concentration range of 0–2 mm to a constant amount of U-15N-labeled protein sample (0.1 mm). 1H,15N HSQC experiments were carried out using the same parameters, except P1 (the 90° hard pulse) and shimming values. The peak intensities were measured at each titration point to assess the amount of paramagnetic-induced line broadening. HSQC titrations were carried out as described previously (22Huang C. Mohanty S. Banerjee M. A novel method of production and biophysical characterization of the catalytic domain of yeast oligosaccharyltransferase.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Structure calculation was done with CYANA 3.0. NOESY spectra were peak-picked and integrated interactively. Dihedral angle constraints were determined by TALOS+ (31Shen Y. Delaglio F. Cornilescu G. Bax A. TALOS+: a hybrid method for predicting protein backbone torsion angles from NMR chemical shifts.J. Biomol. NMR. 2009; 44: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar). Structure calculation of the C-terminal domain of Stt3p was done in two steps. In the first step, the structure of each secondary structural element was determined to high resolution. The structures of these elements were then fixed by medium-range NOE restraints and relatively tight backbone dihedral angle restraints. In the second step, these segments were folded together with long-range NOE restraints. 100 structures were calculated, and 10 structures of the lowest total energy were used to represent their ensemble conformation. In the final calculated structures, the percentages of residues that reside in the most favored, additionally allowed, and generously allowed regions of the Ramachandran diagram are 60.5, 28.6, and 8.1%, respectively. De novo structure determination of membrane proteins remains a challenge. In x-ray crystallography, the presence of detergents often hinders sample crystallization (24Ostermeier C. Michel H. Crystallization of membrane proteins.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar); whereas in NMR spectroscopy, the slow tumbling of membrane proteins embedded in detergent micelles often dramatically broadens the resonance line widths due to their rapid transverse relaxation rates. The difficulty in structure determination for α-helical membrane proteins by NMR is even more striking in comparison with their β-barrel counterparts. This is mainly because unlike the β-barrel membrane proteins, where the long-range interstrand NOEs are abundant and readily provide adequate restraints to define the global folds, there are typically very few long-range NH-NH NOEs for α-helical membrane proteins (25Roosild T.P. Greenwald J. Vega M. Castronovo S. Riek R. Choe S. NMR structure of Mistic, a membrane-integrating protein for membrane protein expression.Science. 2005; 307: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Additionally, the NMR spectral dispersion for the amide region is very narrow for α-helical membrane proteins, which results in severe overlapping of resonances, making unambiguous assignments much harder. Consequently, to date, successful cases of α-helical membrane protein structure determination using NMR methods have been largely limited to proteins of low molecular weights (25Roosild T.P.

To achieve unambiguous assignments, we have used a combination of NOEs from 13C,15N-double-labeled, partially deuterated (50%) triple-labeled, and uniformly 13C, 2H,15N-triple-labeled samples, as well as an ILV methyl-protonated, otherwise uniformly 13C,2H,15N-triple-labeled sample, together with backbone dihedral angles from chemical shift analysis (TALOS+) (31Shen Y.

It is noteworthy that four-dimensional NOESY data proved to be very helpful in unambiguous identification of many medium-range NOEs, a characteristic for α-helices, together with many long-range NOEs.

Open table in a new tab As presented in Fig. 1A, the C-terminal domain of Stt3p reveals a globally compact oblate spheroid-shaped structure, with a major axis of ∼680 Å and minor axis of ∼400 Å. This domain of Stt3p is primarily helical, containing 11 helices (α1–α11) and a disordered C terminus (Fig. 1B). These 11 helices are connected by short- or medium-length loops. This high helicity is consistent with our previous experimental data from far-UV CD and chemical shift index analysis (22Huang C. Mohanty S. Banerjee M. A novel method of production and biophysical characterization of the catalytic domain of yeast oligosaccharyltransferase.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 23Huang C. Mohanty S. Challenging the limit: NMR assignment of a 31-kDa helical membrane protein.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 3662-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although both the TALOS+ program and chemical shift index predict the formation of a β-strand for Arg-592–Trp-598, we failed to unambiguously assign supportive NOEs to confirm this prediction, presumably due to peak overlapping. In fact, the absence of a β-strand in the C-terminal domain of eukaryotic Stt3p has been predicted by some structure predictions programs (20Maita N. Nyirenda J. Igura M. Kamishikiryo J. Kohda D. Comparative structural biology of eubacterial and archaeal oligosaccharyltransferases.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 4941-4950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The topology of full-length yeast Stt3p has been proposed to be Ncyt-Clum with 11 transmembrane helices and a soluble C-terminal domain (32Kim H. von Heijne G. Nilsson I. Membrane topology of the STT3 subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20261-20267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, some prediction programs predict that there is a transmembrane domain near the middle of the C-terminal domain (22Huang C. Mohanty S. Banerjee M. A novel method of production and biophysical characterization of the catalytic domain of yeast oligosaccharyltransferase.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 33Jaffee M.B. Imperiali B. Exploiting topological constraints to reveal buried sequence motifs in the membrane-bound N-linked oligosaccharyltransferases.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 7557-7567Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), whereas other programs predict that there is only a hydrophobic region at this position (32Kim H. von Heijne G. Nilsson I. Membrane topology of the STT3 subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20261-20267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, the detailed topology of the C-terminal domain of Stt3p remains controversial. In this study, we used a non-polar paramagnetic probe, 16-DSA, to investigate the topology of the C-terminal domain of Stt3p with respect to the membrane. This non-polar probe accelerates the relaxation of neighboring nuclear spins via dipole-dipole interactions of the residues located in the transmembrane domain, thus reducing the intensities of HSQC peak (34Hilty C. Wider G. Fernández C. Wüthrich K. Membrane protein-lipid interactions in mixed micelles studied by NMR spectroscopy with the use of paramagnetic reagents.ChemBioChem. 2004; 5: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The HSQC spectra were acquired in both the absence and presence of 2 mm 16-DSA (supplemental Fig. S2). Further analysis showed that the addition of 16-DSA resulted in a significant reduction in the peak intensities for residues 488–504, 511–526, 539–551, and 566–582 (Fig. 2). From the structure calculated in this study, we observed that, except for segment 566–582, which partially protrudes outward, all other segments could form a hydrophobic pocket. This explains the reason for the resonance intensity reduction in those segments because the hydrophobic probe 16-DSA can fit into a hydrophobic pocket. Taken together with the results obtained from transmembrane prediction programs (22Huang C. Mohanty S. Banerjee M. A novel method of production and biophysical characterization of the catalytic domain of yeast oligosaccharyltransferase.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), it is likely that the C-terminal segment encompassing residues 566–582 (α5) and the adjoining loop residues are membrane-embedded. Because it has been established that the C-terminal domain of Stt3p is located in the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (32Kim H. von Heijne G. Nilsson I. Membrane topology of the STT3 subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20261-20267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we concluded that this membrane-embedded segment penetrates only the lipid bilayer but does not span it completely and therefore is not a transmembrane domain. We propose that the protein domain under study is monotopic. This is similar to the case of bacterial peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase, which was shown to be a monotopic membrane protein (35Lovering A.L. de Castro L.H. Lim D. Strynadka N.C. Structural insight into the transglycosylation step of bacterial cell wall biosynthesis.Science. 2007; 315: 1402-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, this topology model is consistent with the structure presented in this study, in which the highly hydrophobic C terminus of α5 and the adjoining loop protrude into the lipid bilayer. Accordingly, combined with existing results, we propose that full-length Stt3p has an Ncyt-Clum topology with 11 transmembrane domains in its N-terminal domain and a luminal monotopic C-terminal domain (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Proposed topology of the C-terminal domain of Stt3p.

https://openalex.org/W2148525122,"The multisubunit DNA repair and transcription factor TFIIH maintains an intricate cross-talk with different factors to achieve its functions. The p8 subunit of TFIIH maintains the basal levels of the complex by interacting with the p52 subunit. Here, we report that in Drosophila, the homolog of the p8 subunit (Dmp8) is encoded in a bicistronic transcript with the homolog of the Swc6/p18(Hamlet) subunit (Dmp18) of the SWR1/SRCAP chromatin remodeling complex. The SWR1 and SRCAP complexes catalyze the exchange of the canonical histone H2A with the H2AZ histone variant. In eukaryotic cells, bicistronic transcripts are not common, and in some cases, the two encoded proteins are functionally related. We found that Dmp18 physically interacts with the Dmp52 subunit of TFIIH and co-localizes with TFIIH in the chromatin. We also demonstrated that Dmp18 genetically interacts with Dmp8, suggesting that a cross-talk might exist between TFIIH and a component of a chromatin remodeler complex involved in histone exchange. Interestingly, our results also show that when the level of one of the two proteins is decreased and the other maintained, a specific defect in the fly is observed, suggesting that the organization of these two genes in a bicistronic locus has been selected during evolution to allow co-regulation of both genes."
https://openalex.org/W2017209369,"Cell migration depends on cells being able to create and disassemble adhesive contacts. Hemidesmosomes are multiprotein structures that attach epithelia to basal lamina and disassemble during migration and carcinoma invasion. Phosphorylation of the β4 integrin, a hemidesmosome component, induces disassembly. Although kinases involved in β4 phosphorylation have been identified, little is known about phosphatases countering kinase action. Here we report that calcineurin, a serine-threonine protein phosphatase, regulates β4 phosphorylation. Calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) and calcineurin-siRNA increase β4 phosphorylation, induce hemidesmosome disassembly, and increase migration in HaCat keratinocytes, suggesting that calcineurin negatively regulates β4 phosphorylation. We found no direct dephosphorylation of β4 by calcineurin or association between β4 and calcineurin, suggesting indirect regulation of β4 phosphorylation. We therefore assessed calcineurin influence on MAPK and PKC, known to phosphorylate β4. CsA increased MAPK activity, whereas MAPK inhibitors reduced CsA-induced β4 phosphorylation, suggesting that calcineurin restricts β4 phosphorylation by MAPK. Calcineurin is activated by calcium. Increased [Ca2+]i reduces β4 phosphorylation and stabilizes hemidesmosomes, effects that are reversed by CsA, indicating that calcineurin mediates calcium effects on β4. However, MAPK activation is increased when [Ca2+]i is increased, suggesting that calcineurin activates an additional mechanism that counteracts MAPK-induced β4 phosphorylation. Interestingly, in some squamous cell carcinoma cells, which have reduced hemidesmosomes and increased β4 phosphorylation, an increase in [Ca2+]i using thapsigargin, bradykinin, or acetylcholine can increase hemidesmosomes and reduce β4 phosphorylation in a calcineurin-dependent manner. These findings have implications in calcineurin-inhibitor induced carcinoma, a complication of immunosuppressive therapy.

HD are composed of several transmembrane and cytoplasmic proteins that connect the cytokeratin network to the extracellular matrix. Tissue fragility and blistering disease develop when hemidesmosomal components are genetically altered, indicating the significance of HD in maintaining epithelial tissue integrity (6Borradori L.

The main organizer and nucleator of HD is the a6β4 integrin, a laminin receptor (8Nievers M.G. Schaapveld R.Q. Sonnenberg A.

This integrin recruits the HD component plectin, which then facilitates further association of the integrin with components BPAG1 and BPAG2 (8Nievers M.G. Schaapveld R.Q. Sonnenberg A.

Although HD provides a stable anchor, its components undergo a rapid turnover, indicating a dynamic equilibrium (12Geuijen C.A. Sonnenberg A. Dynamics of the α6β4 integrin in keratinocytes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3845-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 13Tsuruta D. Hopkinson S.B. Jones J.C. Hemidesmosome protein dynamics in live epithelial cells.Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 54: 122-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This rapid turnover might allow epithelial cells to efficiently switch between a stationary and a migratory state by quickly changing the balance toward disassembly. Disassembly of HD becomes important during wound healing to allow cell migration and re-epithelialization (4Gipson I.K. Spurr-Michaud S. Tisdale A. Elwell J.

Importantly, disassembly of HD is also seen during carcinoma invasion, where a reduction of HD can predict metastatic potential (5Herold-Mende C. Kartenbeck J. Tomakidi P. Bosch F.X.

Mutation on some of these serine residues to alanine to impede phosphorylation reduces the disruptive activity of EGF on HD, increases the interaction of β4 and plectin, and can inhibit cell migration by stabilizing HD, indicating a function of β4 serine phosphorylation in HD regulation (17Rabinovitz I.

In contrast, mutation of these sites into aspartate, which mimics phosphorylation, increases HD disruption and plectin dissociation. Importantly, some of these sites are found hyperphosphorylated in invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), suggesting that β4 phosphorylation plays a role in carcinoma invasion (23Kashyap T. Germain E. Roche M. Lyle S. Rabinovitz I. Role of β4 integrin phosphorylation in human invasive squamous cell carcinoma: regulation of hemidesmosome stability modulates cell migration.Lab. Invest. 2011; 91: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In vitro, SCC cells show an increase in β4 phosphorylation when compared with keratinocytes. Interestingly, β4 seems to be preferentially phosphorylated in certain areas of the cells, such as trailing edges and retraction fibers, where previous studies have shown that HD disassemble as the cell moves forward (13Tsuruta D. Hopkinson S.B. Jones J.C. Hemidesmosome protein dynamics in live epithelial cells.Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 54: 122-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Germain E.C. Santos T.M.

Role of β4 integrin phosphorylation in human invasive squamous cell carcinoma: regulation of hemidesmosome stability modulates cell migration.Lab. Invest. 2011; 91: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This distinct distribution of β4 phosphorylation suggests that local factors such as traction forces or calcium fluxes may be regulating β4 phosphorylation (24Almeida E.A. Huovila A.P. Sutherland A.E. Stephens L.E. Calarco P.G. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Sonnenberg A. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M.

An important aspect of protein function regulation through phosphorylation is its reversibility. Although several kinases, such as PKC and the MAPK ERK1/2 and RSK2, have been shown to be involved in serine phosphorylation of β4 (16Rabinovitz I. Toker A. Mercurio A.M.

There is little information about serine-threonine protein phosphatases (PPP) that might be involved in this process. PPP inhibitors, such as okadaic acid and calyculin, have been shown to increase β4 phosphorylation as well as destabilize HD, implicating protein phosphatase 2a and or protein phosphatase 1 (18Germain E.C. Santos T.M. Rabinovitz I. Phosphorylation of a novel site on the β4 integrin at the trailing edge of migrating cells promotes hemidesmosome disassembly.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Wilhelmsen K. Litjens S.H. Kuikman I. Margadant C. van Rheenen J. Sonnenberg A. Serine phosphorylation of the integrin β4 subunit is necessary for epidermal growth factor receptor-induced hemidesmosome disruption.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3512-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the present study we addressed whether another major PPP, calcineurin (CN), is involved in the dephosphorylation and function of the β4 integrin. CN is a heterodimeric serine/threonine phosphatase, and it is the only PPP known to become highly stimulated in response to Ca2+ signals because of the direct binding of Ca2+ and calmodulin (25Rusnak F. Mertz P. Calcineurin: form and function.Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). CN is one of the key players directing the flow of information from local or global calcium signals to effectors that control immediate cellular responses and alter gene transcription. This may be of particular relevance to β4 function given that local factors seem to regulate β4 phosphorylation (18Germain E.C. Santos T.M. Rabinovitz I. Phosphorylation of a novel site on the β4 integrin at the trailing edge of migrating cells promotes hemidesmosome disassembly.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CN inhibitors that are commonly used in immunosuppressive therapy, such as cyclosporin A (CsA), are known to increase the incidence of SCC (26Euvrard S. Kanitakis J. Claudy A. Skin cancers after organ transplantation.N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar), a type of tumor that, as mentioned above, shows increased migration through β4 phosphorylation and HD disassembly (23Kashyap T. Germain E. Roche M. Lyle S. Rabinovitz I. Role of β4 integrin phosphorylation in human invasive squamous cell carcinoma: regulation of hemidesmosome stability modulates cell migration.Lab. Invest. 2011; 91: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, a study of the relationship between CN and β4 phosphorylation should improve our understanding of CN inhibitor-induced SCC. (24Almeida E.A. Huovila A.P. Sutherland A.E. Stephens L.E.

The effect of CN on β4 phosphorylation is indirect and occurs through two different pathways. In one case, CN inhibits the MAPK pathway, where ERK1/2 has been shown to directly phosphorylate β4. A second route is independent of MAPK, where CN seems to positively promote β4 dephosphorylation, probably regulating a downstream phosphatase. We also show that calcium flows affect β4 phosphorylation through CN and calmodulin and that membrane receptors modulating calcium, such as the bradykinin and acetylcholine receptors, can also regulate β4 phosphorylation and HD stability through CN. Interestingly, the activation of Ca/CN pathway can reduce the hyperphosphorylation of β4 in SCC cells and increase HD stability as well as reduce migration. Our results show that CN plays an important role in HD function through regulation of β4 phosphorylation and may be of particular relevance in SCC carcinoma induced by CN inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2005912956,"The emergence of X4 tropic viral strains throughout the course of HIV infection is associated with poorer prognostic outcomes and faster progressions to AIDS than for patients in whom R5 viral strains predominate. Here we investigate a stochastic model to account for the emergence of X4 virus via mutational intermediates of lower fitness that exhibit dual/mixed (D/M) tropism, and employ the model to investigate whether the administration of CCR5 blockers in-vivo is likely to promote a shift towards X4 tropism. We show that the proposed stochastic model can account for X4 emergence with a median time of approximately 4 years post-infection as a result of: 1.) random stochastic mutations in the V3 region of env during the reverse transcription step of infection; 2.) increasing numbers of CXCR4-expressing activated naive CD4+ T cells with declining total CD4+ T cell counts, thereby providing increased numbers of activated target cells for productive infection by X4 virus. Our model indicates that administration of the CCR5 blocker maraviroc does not promote a shift towards X4 tropism, assuming sufficient efficacy of background therapy (BT). However our modelling also indicates that administration of maraviroc as a monotherapy or with BT of suboptimal efficacy can promote emergence of X4 tropic virus, resulting in accelerated progression to AIDS. Taken together, our results demonstrate that maraviroc is safe and effective if co-administered with sufficiently potent BT, but that suboptimal BT may promote X4 emergence and accelerated progression to AIDS. These results underscore the clinical importance for careful selection of BT when CCR5 blockers are administered in-vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1974226769,"The success of gene therapy in the ocular environment is partly due to the presence of hyaluronan in vitreous. Here we explore the mechanism of hyaluronan-mediated enhancement of adenoviral vector transgene expression. Introduction of hyaluronan receptor CD44 into CD44-negative cells followed by transduction in the presence of vitreous with an adenoviral vector containing an IL-12-coding transgene increases IL-12 secretion. We demonstrate that sequential CD44 proteolysis is responsible for hyaluronan-mediated enhancement. Metalloproteinase or γ-secretase inhibitors decrease adenoviral-mediated transgene expression. Deletion of these proteolytic sites in CD44 also inhibits transgene expression. Expression of CD44 with a mutation to prevent phosphorylation of serine 325 inhibits the response to vitreous. Expression of the CD44 intracellular domain enhances transgene expression in the absence of vitreous. CD44-mediated enhancement of gene expression was observed with vectors using different promoters and appears because of an increase in mRNA production, not because of an increase in vector transduction as determined by quantitative RT-PCR and quantitative PCR, respectively. These data fit a model where the interaction of hyaluronan in vitreous and CD44 modulates transgene expression by initiating CD44 proteolysis and release of the cytoplasmic domain, resulting in increased transgene transcription."

https://openalex.org/W1971035726,"In this paper we describe the repeated replacement method (RRM), a new meshfree method for computational fluid dynamics (CFD). RRM simulates fluid flow by modeling compressible fluids’ tendency to evolve towards a state of constant density, velocity, and pressure. To evolve a fluid flow simulation forward in time, RRM repeatedly “chops out” fluid from active areas and replaces it with new “flattened” fluid cells with the same mass, momentum, and energy. We call the new cells “flattened” because we give them constant density, velocity, and pressure, even though the chopped-out fluid may have had gradients in these primitive variables. RRM adaptively chooses the sizes and locations of the areas it chops out and replaces. It creates more and smaller new cells in areas of high gradient, and fewer and larger new cells in areas of lower gradient. This naturally leads to an adaptive level of accuracy, where more computational effort is spent on active areas of the fluid, and less effort is spent on inactive areas. We show that for common test problems, RRM produces results similar to other high-resolution CFD methods, while using a very different mathematical framework. RRM does not use Riemann solvers, flux or slope limiters, a mesh, or a stencil, and it operates in a purely Lagrangian mode. RRM also does not evaluate numerical derivatives, does not integrate equations of motion, and does not solve systems of equations."
