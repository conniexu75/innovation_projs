We show here that in a purified system, the initiator caspases-8 and -10 directly process the executioner pro-caspase-3 with activation rates (k cat/K m) of 8.7 × 105 and 2.8 × 105m−1 s−1, respectively. These rates are of sufficient magnitude to indicate direct processingin vivo. Differentially processed forms of caspase-3 that accumulate during its activation have similar rates of activation, activities, and specificities. The pattern and rate of caspase-8 induced activation of pro-caspase-3 in cytosolic extracts was the same as in a purified system. Moreover, immunodepletion of a putative intermediary in the pathway to activation, pro-caspase-9, was without consequence. Taken together these data demonstrate that the initiator caspase-8 can directly activate pro-caspase-3 without the requirement for an accelerator. The in vitro data thus help to deconvolute previous in vivo transfection studies which have debated the role of a direct versus indirect transmission of the apoptotic signal generated by ligation of death receptors.

Regulation of apoptosis is vital to the development and long term survival of metazoan animals. Apoptosis is required to maintain the balance between cell proliferation and cell death and, therefore, disruptions in the apoptotic program are associated with pathologies such as cancer, where there is too little cell death, and degenerative diseases, where there is too much cell death. Apoptosis can be initiated by at least three types of signals: (i) specific ligation of members on the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR-1)1family, which includes Fas/Apo-1/CD95; (ii) cellular stress, which includes genotoxic damage and anti-neoplastic drugs; and (iii) delivery of granule-associated serine proteases from cytotoxic lymphocytes into target cells. Key mediators that initiate and execute the apoptotic program are members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases whose activation is believed to be essential for virtually all forms of apoptosis (1Salvesen G.S.

Caspases-3, -6, and -7 are involved in the execution of cells in response to many apoptotic stimuli including ligation of death receptors of the TNFR-1 receptor family, resulting in cleavage of a number of proteins whose limited proteolysis is definitive of apoptosis. However, these executioner caspases are not directly activated by receptor ligation, but rely on the proteolytic activity of upstream initiator caspases-8 and -10 (4Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M.

A. 1996; 93: 14486-14491Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In the case of caspase-8 the activation occurs by recruitment of the zymogen to the cytosolic face of the death receptor, such that the initial proteolytic signal originates by autoprocessing of the clustered zymogen (7Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 8Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Mol Cell. 1998; 1: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).At the execution phase, caspase-3 seems to be upstream of caspases-6 and -7 and, therefore, its activation represents a key point in transmission of the proteolytic signal (9Hirata H. Takahashi A. Kobayashi S. Yonehara S. Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto K. Sasada M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism of how the death signal is conveyed from caspase-8 to caspase-3 remains unresolved. Is the apoptotic signal transmitted by direct activation of the executioners by the initiators, thus constituting a minimal two-step cascade that serves to mediate the apoptotic signals, or is the signal further amplified by the presence of additional factors as suggested by Scaffidi et al.(10Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar).To address these issues we have performed a detailed kinetic study of the activation of pro-caspase-3 by caspases-8 and -10 using recombinant zymogens and active proteases in a defined system, and compared this to the activation of the zymogen by caspases-8 and -10 in cytosolic extracts. This allows us to predict the sequence of events that results in transmission of the proteolytic death signal originating from the initiator caspases to the executioners, and on the basis of in vitro observations, test the hypothesis that additional amplifiers and regulators of the apoptotic signals are required in vivo.DISCUSSIONCaspases are commonly divided into apical and executioner subsets (1Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar, 33Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There exist two well characterized points at which apical caspases initiate apoptotic signals. One is at the cell surface where members of the TNFR-1 family of death receptors transmit a signal across the cell membrane following receptor clustering. The second point of initiation follows the release of mitochondrial factors (34Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4433) Google Scholar,35Kroemer G. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 44-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar), and although this post-mitochondrial pathway is well documented it is unclear how the mitochondrion perceives the apoptotic signal. Nevertheless, anti-neoplastic drugs, genotoxic damage, and inhibition of cellular signal transduction pathways all seem to converge on the mitochondrial route (36Reed J.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). At each point of initiation the first recognizable biochemical event is specific caspase activation, and each initiation point utilizes distinct caspases. In the death receptor pathway(s) the apical caspase-8 (and possibly 10) transmits a proteolytic signal following autoactivation at the cytosolic face of the receptor (4Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6578-6583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The signal for activation appears to be local clustering of pro-caspase-8 that possesses enough activity in its zymogen to achieve autolytic proteolytic maturation (7Muzio M. Stockwell B.R.

Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar). Both caspase-8 and caspase-9 have been demonstrated to act on in vitro translated pro-caspases-3 and -7, the executioner caspases whose activation correlates with apoptosis. Thus there are two potential routes to activate the executioner caspases, and in this context both caspases-8 and -9 can be thought of as initiators whose pathways converge at the execution phase of apoptosis.Although caspases-8 and -10 can activate pro-caspase-3 in vitro, it has proven difficult to determine whether the apical caspases perform this function directly or indirectly, because previous studies have relied on in vitro translated zymogens or cytosolic extracts (6Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14486-14491Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 31Muzio M. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16443-16446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). We here demonstrate that caspase-8 and -10 can rapidly activate caspase-3. More importantly, focusing on caspase-8 we observe that activation proceeds with the same rate in a 293 cytosolic extract, eliminating a requirement for an intermediary component. Additionally, depletion of pro-caspase-9 from the extract has no impact on caspase activation by caspase-8, and MCF-7 cells deficient in caspase-3 failed to support processing of pro-caspase-9. Therefore, processing of pro-caspase-9 in death receptor-mediated apoptosis requires the presence and activation of caspase-3 which makes it a downstream event unlikely to play a major role in caspase activation.It has been proposed that mitochondria are required to transmit the apoptotic signal generated by treatment of cells by agonistic Fas antibodies, but only in a small selection of cell lines (10Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar). This would imply that caspase-8, the apical caspase of the Fas pathway, initiates a mitochondrial signal. In support of this, the generation of caspase activity initiated by addition of human caspase-8 to cytosolic extracts of Xenopus eggs is accelerated in the presence of mitochondria (44Kuwana T. Smith J.J. Muzio M. Dixit V. Newmeyer D.D. Kornbluth S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16589-16594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). However, the relevance of this to homologous systems is unclear, since it is not known whether Xenopus has a caspase-8, and the kinetics of activation of a putativeXenopus caspase-3 ortholog, or whether the caspase activity in Xenopus extracts is due to such an ortholog, have not been determined. The data presented above, in contrast, do not suggest any requirement for an intermediary between caspase-8 and caspase-3. Therefore, the question is whether the mitochondrial acceleration occurs in vivo, and whether caspase-8 must transmit its signal via mitochondria to the executioners in vivo. Currently the most valuable evidence for a role of mitochondria in apoptosis triggered by death receptor ligation comes from several studies investigating expression of ectopic or transgenic Bcl-2, which is hypothesized to operate by blocking mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 36Reed J.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Most investigators agree that Bcl-2 prevents apoptosis triggered by genotoxic damage, glucocorticoids, and chemotherapeutic drugs, but there are inconsistencies in the data describing the protective effect of Bcl-2 against apoptosis induced by death receptors (10Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar, 33Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Srinivasan A. Li F. Wong A. Kodandapani L. Smidt Jr., R. Krebs J.F. Fritz L.C. Wu J.C. Tomaselli K.J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6136-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). In a survey of several cell lines, Scaffidi et al. (10Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar) noted that most are not protected by Bcl-2 from apoptosis triggered by agonist Fas antibodies. However, the use of agonist antibodies and immortalized cell lines may not be the best way to determine a role for Bcl-2. More significantly, T-cell apoptosis in vivo, which is dependent on physiologic Fas ligation, is unaffected in Bcl-2 transgenic mice (46Strasser A. Harris A.W. Huang D.C. Krammer P.H. Cory S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6136-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). In contrast, death following injection of agonist Fas antibodies in whole mice was significantly retarded in Bcl-2 transgenic mice (47Lacronique V. Mignon A. Fabre M. Viollet B. Rouquet N. Molina T. Porteu A. Henrion A. Bouscary D. Varlet P. Joulin V. Kahn A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). These somewhat contradictory studies can be reconciled if some cells support direct transmission of caspase-8 to caspase-3, while others require a mitochondrial accelerator (10Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar).Since pro-caspase-9 is not processed by caspase-8, the mitochondrial accelerator must act upstream of the caspase-9 activator complex and, therefore, presumably upstream of the mitochondrion. Possibly the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial signal is activated by the action of caspase-8 on mitochondria, or a latent protein that activates mitochondria for apoptosis. The importance of the mitochondrial route in Fas death is not clear, since evidence suggests that only a minority of cell lines require mitochondria to transmit the caspase-8 signal. If direct transmission of the signal from caspase-8 to the executioner caspase-3 occurs in most cell lines, what is the advantage of a mitochondrial intermediate? Usually, levels of complexity are added to allow additional regulation points, as clearly evidenced by the evolution of the vertebrate blood coagulation cascade. It is not immediately clear what advantage cells would achieve by adding a level of regulation to the Fas-triggered death signal, but future studies will doubtlessly focus on this issue. Regardless, it would appear that those cells in the body that are primed to undergo apoptosis during education of the immune system have evolved death receptors, caspase-8, and the caspase-8 activator complex to allow rapid direct transmission of the death signal, bypassing any mitochondrial requirement, and that pro-caspase-3 is a major physiologic substrate of caspase-8 (Fig. 7). Regulation of apoptosis is vital to the development and long term survival of metazoan animals. Apoptosis is required to maintain the balance between cell proliferation and cell death and, therefore, disruptions in the apoptotic program are associated with pathologies such as cancer, where there is too little cell death, and degenerative diseases, where there is too much cell death. Apoptosis can be initiated by at least three types of signals: (i) specific ligation of members on the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR-1)1family, which includes Fas/Apo-1/CD95; (ii) cellular stress, which includes genotoxic damage and anti-neoplastic drugs; and (iii) delivery of granule-associated serine proteases from cytotoxic lymphocytes into target cells. Key mediators that initiate and execute the apoptotic program are members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases whose activation is believed to be essential for virtually all forms of apoptosis (1Salvesen G.S.

Both caspase-8 and caspase-9 have been demonstrated to act on in vitro translated pro-caspases-3 and -7, the executioner caspases whose activation correlates with apoptosis. Thus there are two potential routes to activate the executioner caspases, and in this context both caspases-8 and -9 can be thought of as initiators whose pathways converge at the execution phase of apoptosis.Although caspases-8 and -10 can activate pro-caspase-3 in vitro, it has proven difficult to determine whether the apical caspases perform this function directly or indirectly, because previous studies have relied on in vitro translated zymogens or cytosolic extracts (6Srinivasula S.M.

More importantly, focusing on caspase-8 we observe that activation proceeds with the same rate in a 293 cytosolic extract, eliminating a requirement for an intermediary component. Additionally, depletion of pro-caspase-9 from the extract has no impact on caspase activation by caspase-8, and MCF-7 cells deficient in caspase-3 failed to support processing of pro-caspase-9. Therefore, processing of pro-caspase-9 in death receptor-mediated apoptosis requires the presence and activation of caspase-3 which makes it a downstream event unlikely to play a major role in caspase activation.It has been proposed that mitochondria are required to transmit the apoptotic signal generated by treatment of cells by agonistic Fas antibodies, but only in a small selection of cell lines (10Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar). This would imply that caspase-8, the apical caspase of the Fas pathway, initiates a mitochondrial signal. In support of this, the generation of caspase activity initiated by addition of human caspase-8 to cytosolic extracts of Xenopus eggs is accelerated in the presence of mitochondria (44Kuwana T.

However, the relevance of this to homologous systems is unclear, since it is not known whether Xenopus has a caspase-8, and the kinetics of activation of a putativeXenopus caspase-3 ortholog, or whether the caspase activity in Xenopus extracts is due to such an ortholog, have not been determined. The data presented above, in contrast, do not suggest any requirement for an intermediary between caspase-8 and caspase-3. Therefore, the question is whether the mitochondrial acceleration occurs in vivo, and whether caspase-8 must transmit its signal via mitochondria to the executioners in vivo. Currently the most valuable evidence for a role of mitochondria in apoptosis triggered by death receptor ligation comes from several studies investigating expression of ectopic or transgenic Bcl-2, which is hypothesized to operate by blocking mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 36Reed J.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Most investigators agree that Bcl-2 prevents apoptosis triggered by genotoxic damage, glucocorticoids, and chemotherapeutic drugs, but there are inconsistencies in the data describing the protective effect of Bcl-2 against apoptosis induced by death receptors (10Scaffidi C.

Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar) noted that most are not protected by Bcl-2 from apoptosis triggered by agonist Fas antibodies. However, the use of agonist antibodies and immortalized cell lines may not be the best way to determine a role for Bcl-2. More significantly, T-cell apoptosis in vivo, which is dependent on physiologic Fas ligation, is unaffected in Bcl-2 transgenic mice (46Strasser A. Harris A.W. Huang D.C. Krammer P.H. Cory S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6136-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). In contrast, death following injection of agonist Fas antibodies in whole mice was significantly retarded in Bcl-2 transgenic mice (47Lacronique V. Mignon A. Fabre M. Viollet B. Rouquet N. Molina T. Porteu A. Henrion A. Bouscary D. Varlet P. Joulin V. Kahn A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). These somewhat contradictory studies can be reconciled if some cells support direct transmission of caspase-8 to caspase-3, while others require a mitochondrial accelerator (10Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar).Since pro-caspase-9 is not processed by caspase-8, the mitochondrial accelerator must act upstream of the caspase-9 activator complex and, therefore, presumably upstream of the mitochondrion. Possibly the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial signal is activated by the action of caspase-8 on mitochondria, or a latent protein that activates mitochondria for apoptosis. The importance of the mitochondrial route in Fas death is not clear, since evidence suggests that only a minority of cell lines require mitochondria to transmit the caspase-8 signal. If direct transmission of the signal from caspase-8 to the executioner caspase-3 occurs in most cell lines, what is the advantage of a mitochondrial intermediate? Usually, levels of complexity are added to allow additional regulation points, as clearly evidenced by the evolution of the vertebrate blood coagulation cascade. It is not immediately clear what advantage cells would achieve by adding a level of regulation to the Fas-triggered death signal, but future studies will doubtlessly focus on this issue. Regardless, it would appear that those cells in the body that are primed to undergo apoptosis during education of the immune system have evolved death receptors, caspase-8, and the caspase-8 activator complex to allow rapid direct transmission of the death signal, bypassing any mitochondrial requirement, and that pro-caspase-3 is a major physiologic substrate of caspase-8 (Fig. 7). Caspases are commonly divided into apical and executioner subsets (1Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar, 33Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There exist two well characterized points at which apical caspases initiate apoptotic signals. One is at the cell surface where members of the TNFR-1 family of death receptors transmit a signal across the cell membrane following receptor clustering. The second point of initiation follows the release of mitochondrial factors (34Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4433) Google Scholar,35Kroemer G. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 44-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar), and although this post-mitochondrial pathway is well documented it is unclear how the mitochondrion perceives the apoptotic signal. Nevertheless, anti-neoplastic drugs, genotoxic damage, and inhibition of cellular signal transduction pathways all seem to converge on the mitochondrial route (36Reed J.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). At each point of initiation the first recognizable biochemical event is specific caspase activation, and each initiation point utilizes distinct caspases. In the death receptor pathway(s) the apical caspase-8 (and possibly 10) transmits a proteolytic signal following autoactivation at the cytosolic face of the receptor (4Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M.

Several other genes associated with inflammation and cartilage degradation, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and stromelysin, were also up-regulated in IL-17-treated chondrocytes.

DNA binding activity of NF-κB was also significantly induced. IL-17 effects on NO release, as well as iNOS, COX-2, and IL-6 protein expression, were inhibited by the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone. Importantly, dexamethasone blunted IL-17-dependent activation of MAP kinases, suggesting a mechanistic relationship between these activities and the aforementioned gene expression responses.

In chondrocytes from osteoarthritic human cartilage, IL-17 up-regulated the spontaneous production of nitric oxide (16Attur M.G. Patel R.N. Abramson S.B. Amin A.R.

Med. 1996; 183: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyze cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling events induced by IL-17 in chondrocytes. These include activation of the JNK, p38, ERK1, and ERK2 MAP kinases; induction of NF-κB DNA binding activity; and glucocorticoid inhibition of both types of responses. Our data unravel IL-17 as a potential additional player in the cytokine networks involved in arthritis and underscore some of its possible effects on cartilage pathology. Human cartilage was obtained at autopsy from donors without known history of joint disease. Bovine cartilage was obtained from Animal Technologies (Tyler, TX). For all experiments reported here, cartilage from the femoral condyles and tibial plateaus of the knee joints was used. Chondrocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion of cartilage and cultured as described previously (17Blanco F.J. Ochs R.L. Schwarz H. Lotz M. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 75-85PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with primary or passage 1 cells. For kinase and immunoblot assays, 3 × 106 chondrocytes were cultured in 100-mm Petri dishes and serum-starved for 24 h before stimulation. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmNa3VO4, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). 100 μg of lysates was used for JNK assay. For immunoblot assays of the phosphorylated kinases p38, ERK1, and ERK2 and for Iκbα, 50 μg of whole cell lysates were used. For iNOS and COX-2, 200 μg of whole cell lysates were used. Proteins were separated on 8–10% polyacrylamide gels. Hypotonic detergent cellular extracts were prepared, and the solid-state JNK assay was performed as described (7Geng Y. Valbracht J. Lotz M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2425-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The extracts were mixed with 10 μl of GSH-agarose suspension (Sigma), to which glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun (1–223) was bound. The mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 12–16 h, pelleted, and washed five times in lysis buffer. The beads were then resuspended in 35 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mmMgCl2, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmdithiothreitol) containing 20 μm ATP and 5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP. After 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by washing with lysis buffer. Phosphorylated proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer and resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography. Nuclear proteins were prepared according to modification of the method described by Schreiberet al. (18Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). Chondrocytes (3 × 106 per condition) were washed and scraped in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were resuspended in swelling buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 50 μg/ml aprotinin) for 15 min on ice and lysed with 0.07% Nonidet P-40. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in extraction buffer, and rotated at 4 °C for 120 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant containing nuclear proteins was collected, analyzed by Bradford, and stored at −80 °C for electrophoretic mobility shift assay. NF-κB binding activities were studied by using double-stranded oligonucleotides (22-mers) 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGT-3′ (Promega), corresponding to the NF-κB site in the human κ light chain promoter. The double-stranded oligonucleotides (3.5 pmol) were labeled with [32P]ATP in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase and were separated from unincorporated [32P]ATP by gel filtration using Centri-sep columns (Princeton Separations, Adelphia, NJ). Nuclear proteins (5 μg) were preincubated for 45 min with 1 μg of poly dI:dC in NF-κB binding buffer on ice. Radioactively labeled oligonucleotide (30,000 cpm) was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The complexes were separated on nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels. Total RNA was isolated by a single step guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform method, using RNA Stat-60 (Tel-Test “B”, Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA (up to 5 μg) was reverse-transcribed with MoMLV-RT (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 30–120 min at 37 °C. RT reactions were subjected to PCR with Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). PCR conditions were within the linear range of amplification of the target cDNAs. PCR primers used were IL-1β (387-bp product): sense, GAGCTCGCCAGTGAAATGATGGC; antisense, CAAGCTTTTTTGCTGTGAGTCCCG (35 cycles); IL-6 (465-bp product): sense, CACAGACAGCCACTCACCTCTTC; antisense, GCTGCGCAGAATGAGATGAGTTGT (28 cycles); iNOS (236-bp product): sense, ACATTGATCAGAAGCTGTCCCAC; antisense, CAAAGGCTGTGAGTCCTGCAC (28 cycles); COX-2 (337-bp product): sense, TTGTCCCAGACAAGCAGGC; antisense, CATTCCTACCACCAGCAACC (35 cycles); stromelysin (504-bp product): sense, TGGACAAAGGATACAACAGGGA; antisense, AGCTCGTACCTCATTTCCTCTG (23 cycles); and glyceraldehyde-3-phospate dehydrogenase (190-bp product): sense, TGGTATCGTGGAAGGACTCATGAC; antisense, ATGCCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAGC (23 cycles). Whole cell lysates were separated on 8–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (S&S NC, Keene, NH). The blots were blocked in TBS/Tween with 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary monoclonal antibody to iNOS (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-prostaglandin H synthase II (COX-2) polyclonal antibody (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI), polyclonal anti-phospho p38 antibody, polyclonal anti-phospho ERK1 and ERK2 antibody, polyclonal anti-phospho JNK antibody (New England Biolabs), or polyclonal anti-Iκbα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Primary antibodies were diluted in TBS/Tween with either 3% milk or 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature to overnight at 4° C. Following five washes with TBS/Tween (125 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween 20), the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories) in TBS/Tween with 3% milk for 45 min at room temperature. After five washes with TBS/Tween, the blots were incubated with ECL substrate solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 min according to the manufacturer's instructions and exposed to x-ray film. Conditioned media were collected from chondrocyte cultures 24 h after treatment with IL-17, p38 inhibitor, or dexamethasone. The supernatants were added to half-area enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate (Costar, Cambridge, MA) that had been precoated with 25 μl of 2 μg/ml monoclonal mouse anti-human IL-6 antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 3 h and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin. Samples or human IL-6 standards were incubated for 2 h followed by 1 μg/ml rabbit anti-human IL-6 (R&D Systems). Biotin-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig (Sigma) was then added. Bound IL-6 was detected with poly-horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Accurate Chemicals, Westbury, NY) and substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Lab, Gaithersburg, MD). The concentration of nitrites, the stable end products of cellular NO breakdown, in conditioned media from chondrocytes was determined by the Griess reaction using NaNO2 as standard. All results are expressed as nmoles of nitrites per 100,000 cells. Recombinant human IL-17 and recombinant human TNFα were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant human IL-1β was purchased from Intergen (Purchase, NY). p38 kinase inhibitor, SB203580, and dexamethasone were purchased from Sigma. MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059, was purchased from New England Biolabs. GlutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun (1–223) was a gift of Dr. Michael Karin (University of California, San Diego). We used NO production as a marker for the capacity of IL-17 to elicit cellular responses in primary normal human articular chondrocytes. As shown in Fig. 1 A, IL-17 induced NO production in chondrocytes at concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml, reaching 70% of its maximal effect at 10 ng/ml. This response was comparable with that induced by IL-1 or TNFα in the same cells, as was the maximal NO levels induced by both cytokines (Fig. 1 B). Thus, normal chondrocytes mount a significant NO response to IL-17. We therefore used this to study the signaling events evoked by IL-17 in these cells.Figure 1Inhibition of NO release in IL-17-treated chondrocytes. Primary cultures of human articular chondrocytes were cultured in media supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum alone or stimulated with different concentrations of IL-17 (A) or IL-1 or TNFα (B). C, cells were stimulated with IL-17 (20 ng/ml) in the presence of the indicated concentrations of SB203580 (SB) or dexamethasone (DEX). Conditioned media were collected after 48 h for measurement of NO levels by the Griess reaction. Results represent mean values ± S.E. A total of five experiments was performed to test the effects of dexamethasone and SB203580.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To gain insight into the possible IL-17 effectors mediating NO production, we evaluated the magnitude of this response in the presence of the specific p38 kinase inhibitor, SB203580 (19Lee J.C.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 C shows that SB203580 reduced IL-17-driven NO synthesis in a dose-dependent manner, reaching a maximum of 30% inhibition at 10 μm, a concentration at which it still retains full specificity toward p38 (21Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar). The effect of dexamethasone on IL-17-induced NO synthesis was tested next. Dexamethasone is the most commonly used anti-inflammatory drug and is an inhibitor of cytokine-induced cellular responses. Like SB203580, dexamethasone also exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of NO production, blunting this response by greater than 50% at 100 nm (Fig. 1 C). A mixture of dexamethasone and SB203580 had an additive inhibitory effect. The effects reported in Fig. 1 C were qualitatively similar in articular chondrocyte preparations from five different donors. Thus, NO production in response to IL-17 is mediated through a signaling cascade affected by p38 kinase and is sensitive to the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone. We next analyzed the effects of IL-17 stimulation on the expression of genes associated with the inflammatory response in chondrocytes. The levels of IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, and stromelysin mRNAs were assessed by performing RT-PCR on samples prepared at various time points following IL-17 administration (Fig. 2). Transcripts of all genes tested were barely detectable in the nonstimulated chondrocytes, with the exception of stromelysin, and all were substantially induced following the introduction of IL-17. Maximal induction was achieved 4 h poststimulation, and the transcripts examined maintained these maximal levels at least for 24 h. Glyceraldehyde-3-phospate dehydrogenase RT-PCR products, analyzed as internal control, were unchanged during the course of the experiments. Induction of iNOS, COX-2, and IL-6 proteins by IL-17 was consistent with the RT-PCR data (Fig. 3) with iNOS and COX-2 displaying peak expression approximately 28 h poststimulation (Fig. 3 A).Figure 3iNOS, COX-2, and IL-6 protein synthesis.Chondrocytes were cultured in media or stimulated with 10 ng/ml IL-17 for the time points indicated (A). B, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml IL-17 for 24 h in the presence of the indicated concentrations of dexamethasone (DEX) or SB203580. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for iNOS or COX-2.C, conditioned media from 24 h cultures of chondrocytes that were treated with the indicated combinations of IL-17, dexamethasone, or SB203580 were analyzed for IL-6 content by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data represent mean ± S.E. from two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The efficacy of dexamethasone in inhibiting IL-17-augmented gene expression was then tested. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the co-addition of dexamethasone with IL-17 exerted almost complete reduction of IL-1 and iNOS mRNA expression and exhibited also reduced IL-6 and COX-2 mRNAs. Likewise, nanomolar concentrations of dexamethasone also blunted the induction of the iNOS, COX-2, and IL-6 proteins (Fig. 3, B and C). On the other hand, no inhibitory effect of dexamethasone could be registered on stromelysin mRNA. The role of p38 kinase signal transduction cascade in the induction of the aforementioned mRNAs was assessed by using the p38-specific inhibitor SB203580. The effect of this p38 inhibitor at a concentration of 10 μm was considerably less as compared with dexamethasone, with COX-2 and IL-6 mRNA induction profiles displaying the highest, but still modest, SB203580 sensitivity (Fig. 2 A). A similarly mild effect of SB203580 was observed on the protein products of iNOS and COX-2 (Fig. 3 B). The most impressive inhibitory effect of SB203580 was observed on the IL-17-induced secretion of IL-6, which was lowered by approximately 65% in the presence of 10 μm inhibitor. In summary, dexamethasone is a potent antagonist of multiple IL-17-mediated gene expression responses, whereas inhibition of the p38 kinase signal transduction pathway has only a modest effect on these events. Members of the Rel/NF-κB family of transcription factors are common effectors of many cytokine-regulated pathways and are known to be activated by IL-17 in fibroblasts (14Yao Z. Fanslow W.C. Seldin M.F. Rousseau A.M. Painter S.L. Comeau M.R. Cohen J.I. Spriggs M.K. Immunity. 1995; 3: 811-821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). In human articular chondrocytes, IL-17 treatment caused a substantial increase in NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 4 A). Maximal NF-κB activity was observed 1–3 h following stimulation, with activity still detectable after 24 h. This response was similar to the activation of NF-κB by IL-1. 2T. Shalom-Barak and M. Lotz, unpublished data. NF-κB proteins are constitutively sequestered in the cytoplasm through binding to the inhibitory protein IκB. Induction of NF-κB activity in response to extracellular signaling events is achieved through phosphorylation-dependent degradation of the inhibitor, which leads to the nuclear translocation of free NF-κB. We therefore evaluated IκBα degradation in response to IL-17 treatment. Fig. 4 C shows that within 30 min of stimulation, IL-17 elicited a transient reduction in IκBα levels, which returned to basal values by 5 h. Thus, IκBα degradation and re-expression is associated with NF-κB activation by IL-17 in chondrocytes. Glucocorticoids have been established as antagonists of NF-κB DNA binding activity (22Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar, 23Auphan N. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M.

Given the observed pleiotropic inhibitory effects of dexamethasone on IL-17-induced gene expression in chondrocytes, we determined to which extent this was related to changes in NF-κB activity. As expected, 1-h co-incubation with dexamethasone reduced the levels of IL-17-induced NF-κB DNA binding (Fig. 4 B). However, this inhibitory effect was not as dramatic as dexamethasone effects on gene expression. The MAP kinase cascade is one of the pivotal intracellular pathways activated by cytokine receptors. We determined whether similar activity patterns may account for the effects of IL-17 on chondrocytes. Initial experiments in human articular chondrocytes indeed revealed activation of the MAP kinases JNK, p38, ERK1, and ERK2 in seven of nine different donors (data not shown). However, the responses varied between donors with regard to their intensity, background activity in the nonstimulated controls, and kinetics. To exclude this variability, MAP kinase activation analyses were performed with primary bovine chondrocytes. Recombinant human IL-17 activated MAP kinases in bovine articular chondrocytes. This response was reflected both in biochemical assays measuring kinase activity (as demonstrated for JNK) as well as in direct immunodetection of the phosphorylation status, and hence the implied activation, of the MAP kinases p38, ERK1, and ERK2 (Fig. 5 A). Significant activation was registered already at the earliest time point analyzed (30 min), reaching a peak at 1 h following stimulation and decaying slowly thereafter. These data clearly demonstrate that several key players of the MAP kinase cascade are activated in chondrocytes exposed to IL-17. Targets of the MAP kinase pathway are various transcription factors activated through phosphorylation by the downstream effectors of the cascade, such as JNKs (26Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). These include the heterodimers of the Jun/Fos families (an activity termed collectively AP-1), ATF2, Elk-1, and TCF (27Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 28Stein B. Anderson A.D. Annu. Rep. Med. Chem. 1996; 31: 289-298Google Scholar). In the case of AP-1, phosphorylation of Jun by JNK is a prerequisite for the ability of the complex to execute transcriptional activation (29Westwick J.K. Weitzel C. Minden A. Karin M. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26396-26401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with an effect of MAP kinases on transcriptional activation rather than DNA binding properties of AP-1, assays addressing DNA binding activity of this complex in IL-17-stimulated chondrocytes failed to detect an effect of the cytokine (data not shown). As AP-1 is central to the transcriptional induction of most of the genes found earlier in this study to be elevated in chondrocytes in response to IL-17, we sought ways to evaluate IL-17-dependent changes in AP-1 activity other than DNA binding. For that purpose, we took advantage of the fact that glucocorticoids and AP-1 activities are mutually inhibitory, an effect that is considered central to the immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids (30Yang-Yen H.F.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on IL-17-induced chondrocyte gene expression (see Figs. 2 and 3) is consistent with this phenomenon. Biochemical studies previously demonstrated that the inhibition is brought about, at least in part, by direct binding between AP-1 and the glucocorticoid receptor (31Konig H. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 32Schule R. Rangarajan P. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Yang N. Verma I.M. Evans R.M.

As down-regulation of AP-1 activity could in principle be achieved also through inhibition of essential upstream kinases, we wished to determine whether this occurs in the context of IL-17-treated chondrocytes. Fig. 5, B and C, demonstrates that this was indeed the case. In IL-17-stimulated chondrocytes, pharmacological concentrations of dexamethasone elicited a significant reduction in JNK activity as well as"

The studies described here were undertaken to elucidate the molecular basis for the inhibition of fibrinolysis. When TAFIa is included in a clot undergoing fibrinolysis induced by tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen, the time to achieve lysis is prolonged, and free arginine and lysine are released over time. In addition, TAFIa prevents a 2.5-fold increase in the rate constant for plasminogen activation which occurs when fibrin is modified by plasmin in the early course of fibrin degradation. The effect is specific for the Glu- form of plasminogen. TAFIa prevents or at least attenuates positive feedback expressed through Lys-plasminogen formation during the process of fibrinolysis initiated by tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen. TAFIa also inhibits plasmin activity in a clot and prolongs fibrinolysis initiated with plasmin. We conclude that TAFIa suppresses fibrinolysis by removing COOH-terminal lysine and arginine residues from fibrin, thereby reducing its cofactor functions in both plasminogen activation and the positive feedback conversion of Glu-plasminogen to Lys-plasminogen. At relatively elevated concentrations, it also directly inhibits plasmin.

Acta. 1990; 1034: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 5Wang W. Hendriks D.F. Scharpe S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15937-15944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It also was named plasma carboxypeptidase B by Eaton et al. (6Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently plasma procarboxypeptidase B (pro-plasma carboxypeptidase B) by Tan and Eaton (7Tan A.K. Eaton D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5811-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition, on the basis of its instability in serum, it probably can be identified as carboxypeptidase R described by Campbell and Okada (8Campbell W. Okada H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, rather than free thrombin, is probably the physiologic activator of TAFI (2Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In addition, activated TAFI (TAFIa) down-regulates tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA)-induced fibrinolysis half-maximally at a concentration of 1.0 nm (2Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Because this is only about 1.3% of the level of the zymogen in plasma, ample TAFIa could be generated to modulate fibrinolysis very significantly in vivo (2Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Bajzaret al. (3Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 2093-2100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the apparent profibrinolytic effect of activated protein C is absent in TAFI-deficient plasma or when plasma is supplemented with an anti-TAFI monoclonal antibody. They also showed in plasma systems supplemented with soluble thrombomodulin or in systems utilizing cultured endothelial cells as a source of thrombomodulin, that fibrinolysis is inhibited when and only when TAFI is activated (9Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. Morser J. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2792-2798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, Redlitz et al. (10Redlitz A. Nicolini F.A. Malycky J.L. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 1996; 93: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) showed that activated pro-plasma carboxypeptidase B and plasma carboxypeptidase N diminish the binding of plasminogen to U937 cells and that fibrinolysis occurs more rapidly in pro-plasma carboxypeptidase B (TAFI)-deficient compared with normal plasma. These observations suggest that the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades are linked through TAFI and that TAFIa might participate fundamentally in the regulation of the fibrinolytic response. As a consequence, the following studies were carried out to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which TAFIa suppresses fibrinolysis. The synthetic carboxypeptidase substrate hippuryl-l-arginine, and l-arginine,l-lysine, octopine dehydrogenase, and saccharopine dehydrogenase were obtained from Sigma. The chromogenic substrate S-2251 was purchased from Helena Laboratories (Beaumont, TX). The carboxypeptidase B inhibitor 2-guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid and the plasmin inhibitor VFK-CMK were purchased from Calbiochem. NADH and carboxypeptidase B were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Na125I (100 mCi/ml) was purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Montreal, PQ), and IODO-BEADs were purchased from Pierce Chemical Company. DAPA, a specific thrombin inhibitor, was synthesized and isolated according to the method of Nesheim et al. (11Nesheim M.E. Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The human proteins fibrinogen, plasminogen, prothrombin, factor V, and antithrombin III were isolated from plasma; the enzymes thrombin, factor Xa, and plasmin and phospholipid vesicles containing 75% phosphatidylcholine and 25% phosphatidylserine were prepared as described previously (1Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). t-PA (Activase) was a generous gift of Dr. Gordon Vehar of Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Recombinant soluble thrombomodulin (Solulin) was obtained as a generous gift from Dr. John Morser and colleagues at Berlex Biosciences (Richmond, CA). Recombinant human α2-antiplasmin was isolated from culture supernatants of baby hamster kidney cells transfected with the human cDNA and grown in serum-free medium, as described before (1Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). TAFI was purified from human plasma according to the method of Bajzaret al. (1Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). TAFI was activated to the active species, TAFIa, by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex according to the method of Bajzaret al. (2Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The inhibition of t-PA-mediated fibrinolysis by TAFIa was then measured by lysis assays performed in a system of purified fibrinolytic components as described previously (1Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 2Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Free arginine and lysine released from fibrin in the presence of TAFIa were measured during t-PA-mediated fibrinolysis. Clots were produced in the presence of various concentrations of TAFIa (0–63 nm), and lysis times were monitored. Once the clot lysed completely, the samples were deproteinated by perchloric acid (0.2 m, final) and subsequently neutralized by KOH. The insoluble potassium perchlorate was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C. The supernatants were used for determination of arginine and lysine. In separate experiments, the time courses of the release of arginine and lysine by TAFIa were measured by solubilizing fibrin clots with acetic acid (0.1m, final), thereby quenching all reactions, at regular intervals over 3 h. The samples then were deproteinated, and free arginine and lysine in the supernatants were determined. Free arginine and lysine were determined by methods similar to those described by Gaede et al. (12Gaede G. Grieshaber M. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 66: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and Nakatani et al. (13Nakatani Y. Fujioka M. Higashino K. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). 100 μl of supernatant or a standard solution containing known concentrations of arginine or lysine was added to the wells of a microtiter plate containing 80 μl of a solution that included (final concentrations) 10 μm NADH and a 1 mmconcentration of either pyruvate (in the case of arginine assay) or α-ketoglutaric acid (in the case of lysine assay) in 0.05m HEPES buffer, pH 7.0. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 20 μl of a buffered solution of octopine dehydrogenase (0.5 unit) for the arginine assay or saccharopine dehydrogenase (0.1 unit) for the lysine assay. The diminution of fluorescence intensity was then monitored over the next 2 h in a fluorescence plate reader attached to a Perkin-Elmer model LS50B spectrofluorometer. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 340 and 450 nm, respectively, and a 430 nm cutoff filter was employed in the emission beam. The concentrations of arginine and lysine were determined according to standard curves that were constructed by plotting ΔEm 450 of the standard samplesversus the concentration of arginine or lysine. These experiments were performed by measuring by fluorescence the time course of cleavage of the Glu1 and Lys78 forms of recombinant (S741C-fluorescein) plasminogen described by Horrevoets et al. (14Horrevoets A.J.G. Pannekoek H. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2176-2182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Horrevoets A.J.G. Pannekoek H. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2183-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These are derivatives of plasminogen which show a 50% decrease in fluorescence intensity when cleaved and do not yield active plasmin, thereby allowing facile measurement of cleavage kinetics within fibrin and eliminating plasmin-catalyzed feedback cleavage of fibrin, t-PA, and plasminogen. To determine the effect of TAFIa on the kinetics of cleavage of the plasminogen derivatives within a clot, solutions (88 μl) of the derivatives (227 nm) and fibrinogen (3.4 μm), in 0.02 m HEPES,0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, and 0.01% Tween 80 were pipetted into the wells of a microtiter plate. The temperature was 22 °C. To some samples 2.0 μl of a solution of 250 nm plasma plasminogen was added, and to the others 2.0 μl of buffer was added. The fluorescence intensities of the samples were then read several times to establish initial values. The reactions were started by pipetting into the wells a solution (10.0 μl) of t-PA (one- or two-chain), thrombin, CaCl2, and, when present, TAFIa. The final concentrations of t-PA were 2.5 and 5.0 nm, respectively, with the Lys78 and Glu1 forms of the substrate. The final concentrations of thrombin, Ca2+, and TAFIa were 6.0, 5.0, and 0–5.0 nm, respectively. The time courses of the fluorescence decrements were measured in 1-min intervals over the next hour in a fluorescence plate reader linked to a Perkin-Elmer model LS50B spectrofluorometer. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 490 and 535 nm, with a 530 nm cutoff filter in the emission path. The concentrations of remaining substrate were calculated from the fluorescence data. Rate constants were calculated for successive 1-min intervals by the equationk=ln([P(τ1)]/[P(τ2)])/(τ2−τ1),(Eq. 1) where [P(τ1)] and [P(τ2)] are the concentrations of plasminogen at the beginning and end times of each interval (τ1 and τ2). The two-chain t-PA was prepared by incubating one-chain t-PA (4 μm) with plasmin (10 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C and then inhibiting the plasmin with the plasmin inhibitor VFK-CMK (105 nm). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions was used to confirm quantitative conversion to the two-chain form. VFK-CMK was also added without plasmin to control for the presence of the inhibitor in one-chain t-PA. Glu-plasminogen was iodinated with 125I using IODO-BEADS as described previously (1Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The final concentration of 125I-Glu-plasminogen was 95.7 μg/ml, and the specific radioactivity was 9.73 × 103 cpm/ng. The activation of plasminogen and the conversion of Glu-plasminogen to Lys-plasminogen in the absence and presence of TAFIa were quantitated during lysis of fibrin clots. A solution of fibrinogen (3.3 μm) containing plasminogen (0.77 μm), antithrombin III (0.98 μm), and α2-antiplasmin (0.48 μm) was supplemented with125I-Glu-plasminogen (1.8 nm). Two series of identical clots were formed by adding 100-μl aliquots of this solution to microtiter wells containing small, separated aliquots of either TAFIa (40 nm, final) or buffer, t-PA (441 pm, final), thrombin (6 nm, final), and CaCl2 (10 mm, final). The final volume was 110 μl. Each clot was incubated at 37 °C, and turbidity was monitored at 405 nm at 2.5-min intervals. At various times between 0 and 180 min the reaction in one clot from each series (plus and minus TAFIa) was quenched with acetic acid (0.1 m, final). All samples were immediately frozen at −70 °C. Subsequently, the samples were thawed, and 25 μl of each was brought to 15% sucrose, 0.9m acetic acid, with basic fuschin as an electrophoresis indicator and were subjected to urea/acetic acid 7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (16Panyim S. Chalkley R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 130: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar) at 120 V for 15 h at 22 °C in an LKB model 2001 vertical electrophoresis unit on 15-cm gels. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak XAR-5) at −70 °C. After development, the autoradiograph was aligned with the gel, and the locations of all radioactive species were determined. The bands were excised and counted for 10 min in an LKB model 1275 MiniGamma counter. The species that were excised included Glu-plasminogen, Lys-plasminogen, and plasmin-α2-antiplasmin. These were the only species evident on the gels. To study the effect of TAFIa on plasmin-induced clot lysis, clots were produced by the addition of 100 μl of a solution of fibrinogen (3.0 μm, final) to wells containing 2 μl of plasmin (2 nm, final), 2 μl of thrombin (6 nm, final) and CaCl2 (10 mm, final), and 7 μl of TAFIa (0–120 nm, final). Turbidity at 405 nm was then recorded at 37 °C over 10 h. Three series of 12 identical clots were formed with fibrinogen (3.0 μm, final), thrombin (6 nm, final), CaCl2 (10 mm, final), and plasmin (4 nm, final) at 37 °C. One series was formed in the absence of TAFIa and the other two in the presence of 25 and 50 nm TAFIa, respectively. As described previously (1Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), clots were solubilized at various times and reactions quenched by adding acetic acid (0.1 m, final). Equal volumes of a solution of S-2251 (500 μm) in 437 mm HEPES, containing 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm ε-amino caproic acid, and 40 μm DAPA, pH 8.0, were added to the wells, and the time courses of the increase of absorbance at 405 nm were then monitored. The initial rates of S-2251 hydrolysis, relative to that at zero time, were determined to infer plasmin levels. Similar experiments were performed in the absence of fibrinogen. Previous studies showed that the inhibitory effect of TAFIa on fibrinolysis correlates with carboxypeptidase activity measured with hippuryl-l-arginine (1Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), suggesting that the antifibrinolytic effect of TAFIa can most likely be attributed to the removal of COOH-terminal arginine and lysine residues from partially degraded fibrin in the clot. We therefore measured free arginine and lysine in completely lysed clots. Released arginine and lysine were found in all samples that contained TAFIa. The lysis times were 33 min in the absence of TAFIa and 92 min in the presence of 63 nmTAFIa. No free arginine or lysine was detected in the absence of TAFIa. We then determined the time course of the release of free arginine and lysine from fibrin by TAFIa during clot lysis (Fig. 1). The arginine level rose to about 9.8 μm immediately after clotting, most likely because of the release of fibrinopeptides A and B during the clotting of the 3.0 μm input fibrinogen (two fibrinopeptides A and B are released from each fibrinogen molecule). The arginine level then increased gradually to about 25 μm by 180 min. The lysine level rose smoothly to about 6 μm over the same interval. In separate experiments, the effects of free arginine and lysine on fibrinolysis, at the levels found with TAFIa, were tested by adding them to the lysis assay system, and no prolongation of lysis time was observed. Thus, the inhibition of lysis by TAFIa correlates with the release of, but is not caused by, free arginine and lysine in the clot. Plasminogen activation by t-PA is stimulated several hundredfold by fibrin, and this cofactor activity is augmented by plasmin-catalyzed feedback modification of fibrin, whereby carboxyl-terminal lysine and arginine residues are generated (14Horrevoets A.J.G. Pannekoek H. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2176-2182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Horrevoets A.J.G. Pannekoek H. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2183-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,17Suenson E. Bjerrum P. Holm A. Lind B. Meldal M. Selmer J. Petersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22228-22237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Norrman B. Wallen P. Ranby M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because TAFIa is a carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme, it might possibly prevent or attenuate the effect of the plasmin-catalyzed feedback cleavages in fibrin. To explore this possibility the effects of TAFIa on the kinetics of cleavage of Glu1 and Lys78(S741C-fluorescein) plasminogen were investigated. These plasminogen derivatives do not generate plasmin; thus, plasmin feedback does not occur unless native plasminogen is included also. Results obtained when the time course of cleavage of the fluorescent plasminogen derivative, catalyzed by one-chain or two-chain t-PA within a clot, are shown in Fig. 2. The control results (no plasma plasminogen, no TAFIa) are shown by the solid circles. The results obtained when 5.0 nm plasma plasminogen was included are shown by the solid squares. These data show that initially, rates of fluorescent plasminogen consumption are the same. Later in the course of the reaction, however, the fluorescent plasminogen is consumed more rapidly when native plasminogen is present to generate plasmin, thereby modifying fibrin and accelerating the reaction. This effect is attenuated progressively when TAFIa is included at increasing concentrations. When the TAFIa concentration is 5.0 nm, the effect of included native plasminogen is eliminated completely. This occurs with both one- and two-chain t-PA. These effects are quantified in Fig. 3, where the rate constants for plasminogen activation are shown as a function of time over the first 1,600 s of the reaction. With both one- and two-chain t-PA the rate constant evaluates to 1 × 10−4/s in the absence of added plasma plasminogen or TAFIa (solid circles). The near constancy of this value over time in the controls indicates that the reaction is approximately first order, which is consistent with the fairly high K m (0.5 μm) for this reaction under these conditions (15Horrevoets A.J.G. Pannekoek H. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2183-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). They also show that one- and two-chain t-PA are identically active under these conditions. When a trace of plasma plasminogen is included, the value of the rate constant increases up to about 2.5 × 10−4/s (solid squares), presumably as a result of plasmin-catalyzed modification of fibrin by plasmin, with a concomitant enhancement of cofactor activity. This effect is attenuated progressively by TAFIa, with the half-maximal effect at approximately 1.0 nm TAFIa (solid triangles). At 5.0 nm TAFIa (open squares) no increase in the rate constant is observed. The effects with one- and two-chain t-PA were very similar. Although the data are not presented, the magnitude of the increase in rate constants was not increased by higher levels of plasminogen. These data thus confirm that plasmin formation in the early stages of fibrinolysis can promote the kinetics of t-PA-induced plasminogen activation as shown by others (17Suenson E. Bjerrum P. Holm A. Lind B. Meldal M. Selmer J. Petersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22228-22237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Norrman B. Wallen P. Ranby M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and that TAFIa eliminates this effect, presumably by removing newly formed carboxyl-terminal lysine and possibly arginine residues within fibrin. The inclusion of plasma plasminogen had no effect on the kinetics of cleavage of Lys78-Plg(S741C-fluorescein) (not shown).Figure 3Effect of TAFIa on the rate constant for Glu1-Plg(S741C)fluorescein cleavage. The point to point rate constants for the data of Fig. 2 are plotted versus time.Symbols are as in Fig. 2. The data indicate that TAFIa suppresses the up-regulation of the t-PA cofactor activity of fibrin during fibrinolysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous work, in which the flow of plasminogen to plasmin during the fibrinolytic process within a clot was analyzed, showed that about 50% of the plasmin generated by the time the clot lysed was obtained through Lys-plasminogen (19Fredenburgh J.C. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26150-26156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following experiments were performed to determine whether TAFIa influences this process. With radiolabeled Glu-plasminogen, we monitored by urea/acetic acid-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the activation of plasminogen and the conversion of Glu-plasminogen to Lys-plasminogen during fibrinolysis in the absence and presence of TAFIa. Fig. 4 Ashows the time course of Glu-plasminogen consumption and concomitant formation of plasmin-antiplasmin complexes for clots formed in the presence and absence of TAFIa. The lysis times were 53 min in the absence of TAFIa and 104 min in its presence (40 nm), indicating an approximate 2-fold prolongation. In both instances the amount of Glu-plasminogen consumed equals the sum of the amounts of plasmin-antiplasmin complexes and Lys-plasminogen accumulated. In the absence of TAFIa, plasminogen consumption shows its characteristic acceleration as the lysis time is approached. This is also reflected in the formation of the plasmin-antiplasmin complexes. This characteristic acceleration, however, does not occur in the presence of TAFIa. These effects are very similar to those indicated in Fig. 2. In addition, the conversion of Glu-plasminogen to Lys-plasminogen occurs in the absence of TAFIa but not in its presence (Fig. 4 B). The autoradiogram also indicated both the Glu and Lys forms of the plasmin-α2-antiplasmin complex. In the presence of TAFIa only the Glu- form was evident, whereas in the absence of TAFI both forms were evident. We conclude that TAFIa not only prevents the feedback enhancement of plasminogen activation but also interferes with the fibrin-dependent conversion of Glu-plasminogen to Lys-plasminogen and attenuates the contribution of this reaction to the accelerated phase of plasminogen activation. These data are consistent with the conclusions of others that partially degraded fibrin, but not intact fibrin, is the cofactor for the conversion of Glu-plasminogen to Lys-plasminogen (17Suenson E. Bjerrum P. Holm A. Lind B. Meldal M. Selmer J. Petersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22228-22237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Norrman B. Wallen P. Ranby M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To determine whether TAFIa inhibits fibrinolysis by modes other than inhibition of plasminogen activation and the conversion of Glu-plasminogen to Lys-plasminogen, the lysis of fibrin directly catalyzed by plasmin was studied in the presence and absence of TAFIa. Fig. 5 shows the time courses of plasmin-induced lysis of clots. In the absence of TAFIa, the clot lysed at about 60 min with 2 nm plasmin. In the presence of TAFIa, the lysis times were prolonged in a TAFIa concentration-dependent manner. The concentrations of TAFIa required to prolong lysis initiated by plasmin are considerably greater than those needed to prolong lysis initiated by t-PA plus plasminogen (the half-maximal effect is observed at 1.0 nm TAFIa (2Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar)). Nonetheless, because the concentration of TAFI in human plasma is about 75 nm (9Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. Morser J. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2792-2798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and the TAFI is exquisitely sensitive to activation by thrombin-thrombomodulin (2Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), sufficient TAFIa possibly could be generated in vivo to attenuate plasmin-catalyzed fibrin degradation directly. The observation that TAFIa markedly inhibits lysis of fibrin by plasmin suggests that TAFIa can inhibit plasmin activity directly. Therefore, plasmin activity during fibrinolysis was measured (Fig. 6). In the absence of TAFIa, plasmin activity in the clot was stable. In the presence of TAFIa, however, plasmin activity was progressively lost. Thus, the inhibition of plasmin activity in the presence of TAFIa is consistent with prolongation of lysis initiated by plasmin. Although the data are not shown here, very similar results were obtained when fibrinogen was deleted from the experiment, thus indicating that fibrin or fibrin degradation products are not in some way responsible for the apparent inhibition. Binding of TAFIa to plasmin does not explain the inhibition because the kinetics of inhibition are too slow to be consistent with simple binding (7Tan A.K. Eaton D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5811-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To determine whether TAFIa can catalyze removal of the carboxyl-terminal arginine of the heavy chain, active-site blocked plasmin (4.0 μm) was incubated with TAFIa (100 nm) for 30 min. Over this interval arginine (3.6 μm) was released. Thus, TAFIa is able to remove the single carboxyl-terminal arginine that appears when plasminogen is converted to plasmin. This, however, is not sufficient to account for loss of plasmin activity because porcine pancreatic carboxypeptidase B also catalyzes release of arginine from active-site-blocked plasmin but does not inactivate native plasmin (data not shown). Perhaps TAFIa has other exo peptidase activities not revealed by our current studies.Figure 6Inhibition of plasmin activity by TAFIa during fibrinolysis. Three series of 12 identical clots containing 4 nm plasmin were formed at 37 °C, one in the absence (▪) of TAFIa and another two in the presence of 25 nm(•) and 50 nm (▴) TAFIa, respectively. At various times clots were solubilized and quenched by adding acetic acid (0.1m, final). Equal volumes of a solution of S-2251 (500 μm) in 437 mm HEPES, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm ε-amino caproic acid, and 40 μm DAPA, pH 8.0, were added to the wells, and the time courses of increase of absorbance at 405 nm were then monitored. The initial rates of S-2251 hydrolysis, relative to that at zero time, were determined and are plotted versus time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Numerous previous studies have shown that a carboxypeptidase with specificity for COOH-terminal arginine and lysine residues can attenuate several reactions and interactions associated with fibrinolysis. For example, de Vries et al. (20de Vries C. Veerman H. Pannekoek H. J. Biol.

Miles et al. (21Miles L.A. Dahlberg C.M. Plescia J. Felez J. Kato K. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) showed that treatment of U937 cells with the same carboxypeptidase reduces their capacity to bind plasminogen, presumably by removing the COOH-terminal lysine residue of the enolase moiety that appears to serve as a plasminogen receptor. Carboxypeptidase B-catalyzed removal of the COOH-terminal lysine residue of the heavy chain of urokinase decreases its catalytic efficiency about 2-fold in the activation of plasminogen (22Lenich C. Pannell R. Gurewich V. Thromb. Res. 1991; 64: 69-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Fleury and Angles-Cano (23Fleury V. Angles-Cano E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7630-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) demonstrated increased plasminogen binding capacity of immobilized fibrin that had been pretreated with plasmin, and the excess capacity could be eliminated with pancreatic carboxypeptidase B (23Fleury V. Angles-Cano E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7630-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition, carboxypeptidase B treatment of partially degraded fibrin reduces urokinase-mediated plasminogen activation (24Pannell R. Black J. Gurewich V. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and reduces the quantity of plasminogen associated with fibrin during the lytic process (25Sakharov D.V. Rijken D.C. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The studies cited above clearly indicate the importance of carboxyl-terminal lysine and possibly arginine residues of partially degraded fibrin or cellular receptors in modulating binding of fibrinolytic components and fibrinolysis. These studies, however, did not allow the inference to be drawn that physiologically significant regulation could be associated with removal of these residues because the results were obtained with the pancreatic carboxypeptidase B. Eatonet al. (6Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), however, showed that plasma contains a precursor of carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme. Because it binds plasminogen they suggested that it might influence fibrinolysis when activated. Further work reported by Redlitz et al. (10Redlitz A. Nicolini F.A. Malycky J.L. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 1996; 93: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) showed that this protein reduces the rate of whole blood clot lysis induced by t-PA. Other work led to the isolation of the protein (1Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 4Hendriks D. Wang W. Scharpe S. Lommaert M.P. van Sande M. Biochim. Biophys.

Blood. 1996; 88: 3815-3823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and showed that it was activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex to the expected carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme (2Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The activated enzyme was shown to suppress fibrinolysis potently in a system of defined components as well as in plasma (1Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 2Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol.

Thus, because the precursor is found in plasma and is activated by a physiologic activator, physiologic modulation of fibrinolysis by this carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme is plausible. The present studies show that when fibrin is exposed to plasmin, stoichiometric levels of COOH-terminal arginine and lysine residues are generated which can be removed by TAFIa. To determine whether the removal of these residues influences plasminogen activation, the kinetics of cleavage of Glu1-Plg(S741C)-fluorescein were measured in the presence and absence of TAFIa under conditions where limited plasmin degradation was allowed by including a trace of plasma plasminogen. The results showed that the rate constant for cleavage increases 2.5-fold during the reaction when plasma plasminogen is included, an effect that is eliminated completely with TAFIa present at 5.0 nm. A half-maximal effect is achieved at a TAFIa concentration of 1.0 nm, which is the same concentration needed to prolong fibrinolysis half-maximally (2Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). We conclude therefore that one of the means by which TAFIa suppresses fibrinolysis is by down-regulating the cofactor activity of partially degraded fibrin. We also showed that TAFIa, at relatively elevated concentrations, interferes directly with plasmin-catalyzed fibrin degradation. The interplay between plasmin and TAFIa is complex. TAFIa can inhibit plasmin and vice versa. In addition, TAFIa activity decays spontaneously, especially at 37 °C (27Boffa M.B. Wang W. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2127-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). When TAFIa and plasmin are together, the long term result is that plasmin activity declines to either none or a finite, stable amount, whereas TAFIa decays completely. The decline of plasmin activity to a stable, finite level that depends on the initial concentration of TAFIa is evident in Fig. 6. A previous study from this laboratory indicated that when plasminogen, α2-antiplasmin, and t-PA are present within fibrin, approximately 50% of the plasmin formed during the lytic process is produced through the Lys-plasminogen intermediate (19Fredenburgh J.C. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26150-26156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because Lys-plasminogen is a much better substrate than Glu-plasminogen, the conversion of Glu-plasminogen to Lys-plasminogen potentially creates positive feedback in plasminogen activation and thereby promotes fibrinolysis. The formation of Lys-plasminogen is promoted by fibrin (18Norrman B. Wallen P. Ranby M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Suenson E. Thorsen S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2435-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and consequently might be susceptible to modulation by TAFIa. The present work indicates that the accumulation of Lys-plasminogen during plasminogen activation and subsequent fibrinolysis is eliminated by TAFIa, and the time to achieve lysis is increased. These observations suggest that one of the means by which TAFIa suppresses fibrinolysis is by down-regulating the conversion of Glu-plasminogen to Lys-plasminogen. They also suggest that the reaction is dependent on, and promoted by, COOH-terminal lysine and/or arginine residues in fibrin. Notably, the data of Bajzar et al. (1Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) indicate that TAFIa has little influence on the activation of Lys-plasminogen. Thus, the conversion of Glu-plasminogen to Lys-plasminogen provides a means through which the fibrinolytic system can attenuate the inhibition elicited by TAFIa. Hortin et al. (29Hortin G.L. Gibson B.L. Fok K.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the COOH-terminal lysine residue of α2-antiplasmin is removed in the presence of porcine pancreatic carboxypeptidase B with a consequent substantial loss of functional activity. Whether TAFIa modulates the properties of α2-antiplasmin was not investigated in this work. TAFIa activity expressed in vivo, however, could account for the observation that plasma has two forms of α2-antiplasmin, one of which both binds to plasminogen and has a COOH-terminal lysine and the other of which has neither of these properties (30Kluft C.

Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A recent study by Sakharov et al. (32Sakharov D.V. Plow E.F. Rijken D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14477-14482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) showed that the time to lyse clotted fibrin could be prolonged up to 4-fold by adding thrombomodulin, and this effect correlated with the activation of procarboxypeptidase B (TAFI). The effect was sustained over a wide range of t-PA concentrations, including those that would be expected during thrombolytic therapy. In addition, they showed that fluorescently labeled plasminogen accumulates on fibrin in the absence of added thrombomodulin but not in its presence. This latter effect could be eliminated with an inhibitor of TAFIa. From these observations, the conclusion was reached that TAFIa attenuates fibrinolysis by eliminating, by virtue of its carboxypeptidase B activity, plasminogen binding sites in partially degraded fibrin. The work by Sakharov and the present work are thus highly complementary. Sakharov et al. demonstrated TAFIa-dependent diminishing of plasminogen binding to fibrin but did not study the impact of this on plasminogen activation. In the present work, the binding of plasminogen to fibrin was not studied, but loss of the up-regulation of fibrin cofactor activity was demonstrated. The two studies suggest that loss of plasminogen binding and attenuation of cofactor activity are related, and both are caused by the TAFIa-catalyzed removal of carboxyl-terminal lysine (and possibly arginine) residues. In summary, the current work shows that TAFIa suppresses fibrinolysis by down-regulating plasminogen activation and the conversion of the Glu-plasminogen to Lys-plasminogen, effects most likely caused by the removal of COOH-terminal lysine and/or arginine residues from partially degraded fibrin. These effects occur at very low relative concentrations of TAFIa. In addition, at higher concentrations, TAFIa also inhibits plasmin directly. Whether TAFIa also influences α2-antiplasmin or other interactions associated with fibrinolysis is not known, but further work relating to modulation by TAFIa of other fluid phase or cellular reactions or interactions will contribute new insights into the role or roles of this carboxypeptidase B-like molecule in regulating fibrinolysis and coupling the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades. A recent report by Redlitz et al. (33Redlitz A. Tan A.K. Eaton D.L. Plow E.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2534-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) is particularly intriguing. They showed, in a canine model of coronary thrombosis and thrombolysis, that a carboxypeptidase B-like activity, which is induced in serum and can be suppressed by a carboxypeptidase inhibitor from potatoes, correlates with both the time needed for reperfusion in vivo and for clots to lysein vitro. The latter observations suggest that carboxypeptidase B-like activity modulates fibrinolysis not onlyin vitro but also in vivo.

Molecular cloning of human OCIF revealed that OCIF and OPG are identical (14Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N. Mochizuki S. Yano K. Fujise N. Sato Y. Goto M. Yamaguchi K. Kuriyama M. Kanno T. Murakami A.

In order to approach these important issues, we have now studied the expression of the OPG/OCIF gene and its regulation in several bone- and bone marrow-derived cell lines. The results indicate that the expression of the OPG/OCIF gene is markedly induced by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in osteoclastogenesis-supporting stromal cells, through both a transcriptional and a post-transcriptional mechanism, and that locally produced OPG/OCIF plays a functional role in the negative feedback regulation of osteoclastic bone resorption."

In a CHO clone stably expressing EDG1 receptor (CHO-EDG1 cells), SP induced increases in the production of inositol phosphates and the [Ca2+]i and inhibited forskolin-induced increase in the cellular cAMP content, all in a manner sensitive to pertussis toxin. SP also activated mitogen-activated protein kinase in CHO-EDG1 cells in pertussis toxin-sensitive and Ras-dependent manners. To evaluate the spectrum of agonists for EDG1, we used human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells, which at naive state do not respond to SP or structurally related lipids with an increase in the [Ca2+]i.

In addition, either an increase or a decrease in cellular cAMP content in response to SP has been reported, depending on cell types used (5Bornfeldt K.E. Graves L.M. Raines E.W. Igarashi Y. Wayman G.

These observations suggest the existence of multiple G protein-coupled cell surface receptors for SP and SPC. Recently, the orphan G protein-coupled receptor EDG2 was identified as a functional receptor for LPA (14Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Moreover, EDG4 was very recently identified to be the second LPA receptor (15An S. Bleu T. Hallmark O.G. Goetzl E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7906-7910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). EDG2 and EDG4 are members of the EDG family of receptors comprising EDG1 (16Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), EDG3 (17Yamaguchi F. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Brenner S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Neurosci. 1994; 5: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which have 36–58% homology in amino acid sequences with each other. SP is related in its structure to LPA, and in some cell types, LPA and SP have been suggested to share a cell surface receptor (20Durieux M.E. Carlisle S.J. Salafranca M.N. Lynch K.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1360-C1364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Yatomi Y. Yamamura S. Ruan F. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5291-5297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to examine the possibility that members of the EDG family receptors could function as a receptor for the lysosphingolipids. Many of cell lines usually used for expression of exogenous genes, including COS, NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells, respond to SP (13van Koppen C.J. Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Laser K.T. Zhang C. Jabobs K.H. Bünemann M. Pott L J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2082-2087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), which hampered expression cloning of SP receptor gene and functional analysis of cloned SP receptor gene. In the present study, by using carefully selected mammalian cell expression systems, we found that EDG1 is a functional receptor with a high specificity and affinity for SP. We demonstrate that EDG1 is coupled via a Gi/o protein to multiple effector pathways, including phospholipase C, adenylate cyclase, and Ras/MAPK. CHO-K1(CHO) and HEL cells, obtained from RIKEN Cell Bank and the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan), respectively, were grown in Ham's F-12 (CHO) and RPMI (HEL) media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Equitech-Bio, Ingram, TX), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). Before each experiment, cells were switched to the respective medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum. The [Ca2+]i was measured as described previously (22Chang K. Hanaoka K. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26152-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) in fura-2-loaded, trypsinized cells with a CAF-110 spectrofluorimeter (Japan Spectroscopy, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) with excitation at 340 and 380 nm and emission at 500 nm. For measurements of production of inositol phosphates, cells were prelabeled with 4 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum for 24 h, and stimulated with SP in the presence of 10 mm LiCl. The fraction containing total inositol phosphates was separated as described in detail elsewhere (22Chang K. Hanaoka K. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26152-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and the radioactivity was quantitated by scintillation counting. For measurements of cAMP, cells were first incubated with 0.2 μm forskolin for 5 min and then stimulated with SP for a further 5 min in the presence of 0.2 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. The reaction was terminated by adding HCl (a final concentration of 0.1 m), and the amount of cAMP in the acid extracts was measured by radioimmunoassay using a Yamasa (Choshi, Japan) cAMP assay kit (22Chang K. Hanaoka K. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26152-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Rat full-length EDG1 cDNA was cloned by hybridization screening of a λgt10 cDNA library made from rat lung (18Okazaki H. Ishizaka N. Sakurai T. Kurokawa K. Goto K. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. Biochem.

The 1.7-kbp StuI-BglII fragment of EDG1 cDNA was adaptor ligated into mammalian expression vector pCAGGS (kindly donated by Dr. J. Miyazaki, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) (23Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar) at the BstXI site downstream of the CAG promoter. Transfections were carried out by using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (24Mitsui H. Takuwa N. Kurokawa K. Exton J.H. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4904-4910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were selected with G418 as described (22Chang K. Hanaoka K. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26152-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). An expression vector for EDG1 with a C-terminal HA tag was created by a PCR-based method (25Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using the sense primer 5′-AGTTGCGGCTATGGTGTCCTCCACCAGCATCCCA-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-TTAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAAGAAGAAGAATTGACGTTTCCAGAAGACATAA-3′. Expression of HA-tagged EDG1 protein was examined by Western blot analysis using monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) (24Mitsui H. Takuwa N. Kurokawa K. Exton J.H. Takuwa Y. J. Biol.

Myc-tagged MAPK was immunoprecipitated by using a mouse monoclonal anti-Myc epitope antibody (clone 9E10). MAPK activity associated with the immune complex was assayed in vitro using myelin basic protein (Sigma) as substrate, as described (24Mitsui H. Takuwa N. Kurokawa K. Exton J.H. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4904-4910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The band shift of endogenous p42ERK2 in CHO cells stably expressing EDG1 was detected by Western blot analysis of total cell lysate with a mouse monoclonal anti-ERK antibody (clone 03–6600; Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Bovine Gαt cDNA (27Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. H. Bourne (University of California, San Francisco, CA) and ligated into the mammalian expression vector pME18S. Cells on a 12-well plate were washed with a binding medium consisting of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and incubated in the same medium containing freshly prepared 5 × 10−10m[32P]SP (68,000 cpm/pmol) in the presence or absence of varied concentrations of unlabeled SP or 10−6m related lipids for 30 min at 25 °C. [32P]SP was prepared as described (7Yatomi Y. Ruan F. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Blood. 1995; 86: 193-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Yatomi Y. Yamamura S. Ruan F. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5291-5297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Time course studies revealed that [32P]SP binding to cells became saturated by 30 min. After washing cells three times with ice-cold binding medium, cell-bound radioactivity was counted. Specific binding was determined by subtracting nonspecific binding in the presence of 3 × 10−6m SP from each binding value. Isolation of total RNA and enrichment of poly(A)+ RNA were performed as described previously (18Okazaki H. Ishizaka N. Sakurai T. Kurokawa K. Goto K. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 1104-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 22Chang K. Hanaoka K. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. J. Biol.

RNA was separated by 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis, transferred onto a nylon membrane (GeneScreen, DuPont NEN), and hybridized by cDNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (DuPont NEN) by the random priming method (22Chang K. Hanaoka K. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26152-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The cDNA probes used were as follows: 0.95-kbpEcoRV-SmaI fragment of rat EDG1 coding the entire transmembrane regions, 365-bp fragment (589–954) of human EDG1, 334-bp 3′ noncoding region fragment (1062–1396) of human EDG2 obtained by reverse transcription-PCR, 1.15-kbp fragment (−9 to 1146) of human EDG3 coding the entire open reading frame obtained by reverse transcription-PCR, 305-bp 3′ noncoding region fragment (1086–1390) of human EDG4 obtained by reverse transcription-PCR, and 0.60-kbpEcoRV-SacI fragment of rat AGR16 coding the fourth transmembrane domain and its entire C-terminal region. SP, SPC, and ceramide (C8)-1-phosphate were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Sphingosine, lysophosphatidylserine (purified from bovine brain), lysophosphatidylcholine (C18), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (C18), ceramide (C2, C6, and C18), PA (diC18), LPA (C18), and glucosylsphingosine were purchased from Sigma. LysoPI (purified from bovine liver) was purchased from Avanti (Birmingham, AL). Fura-2/AM solution was purchased from Dojin (Kumamoto, Japan). U73122 was purchased from Research Biochemicals International (Natik, MA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Gαi antibody (C10) and rabbit polyclonal anti-Gαq/11 antibody (C19) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biochemicals (Santa Cruz, CA). SP was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide at 2 × 10−3m, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Other lipids were dissolved in methanol. Final solvent concentrations did not exceed 0.1%. We first used CHO cells for transient transfection experiments, because we found that CHO cells had an undetectable level of endogenous EDG1 mRNA (Fig. 1). In CHO cells transiently transfected with an expression vector for HA-tagged EDG1, SP at 10−10m caused a biphasic, sustained increase in the [Ca2+]i with the peak [Ca2+]i increment of 110 ± 9 nm (mean ± S.E.; n = 3), as evaluated as an averaged [Ca2+]iincrease in a cell population (Fig. 2 a). In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (0 mm Ca2+ plus 0.1 mm EGTA), SP still elicited a transient increase in the [Ca2+]i, although the amplitude of the peak [Ca2+]i increase was diminished compared with that in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, and the sustained plateau phase of the [Ca2+]i increase was abolished. By contrast, in CHO cells transfected with an empty vector, SP at this concentration did not induce a significant increase in the [Ca2+]i. EDG1 receptor protein in EDG1-transfected CHO cells was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2 b).Figure 2SP induces an increase in the [Ca2+] i and the activation of MAPK in CHO cells transiently transfected with an EDG1 expression plasmid. a, CHO cells that were transiently transfected with either an expression vector for HA-tagged EDG1 (HA-EDG1) or a relevant empty vector were loaded with fura-2 and stimulated with 10−10m SP in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+ as indicated. b, expression of HA-EDG1 protein in CHO cells was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody. c, CHO cells were transiently co-transfected with a Myc-tagged MAPK expression vector and either the EDG1 expression vector or the empty vector and stimulated with 10−8m SP for 5 min. The MAPK activity associated with the anti-Myc epitope immunecomplex was measuredin vitro by using myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrate. Radioactivity of phosphorylated MBP was determined by Fuji Bioimage Analyzer 2000 and expressed as photostimulated luminescence (PSL) units. Representative autoradiograms of phosphorylated MBP and anti-Myc-epitope immunoblots (Myc-MAPK) are shown on the top of the bar graph. The data are means ± S.E. of three determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because many Ca2+-mobilizing receptor agonists are known to activate MAPK/ERK, we examined whether SP activated MAPK in EDG1-transfected CHO cells. We co-transfected CHO cells with an expression vector for Myc-tagged MAPK and either the EDG1 expression vector or the empty vector. We then stimulated these cells with SP (10−8m), immunoprecipitated Myc-tagged MAPK using anti-Myc epitope antibody, and measured the in vitroMAPK activity using myelin basic protein as substrate. SP induced a 25-fold increase in the MAPK activity in cells transfected with the EDG1 expression vector, compared with only a 2-fold increase in cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 2 c). The two transfection groups showed equal expression levels of Myc-tagged MAPK, as evaluated by anti-Myc epitope immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2 c). We established a CHO clone stably expressing EDG1 receptor (CHO-EDG1) for further analysis. In CHO-EDG1 cells, but not in parental CHO cells, SP (10−6m) stimulated inositol phosphate production ∼2-fold. Pretreatment of CHO-EDG1 cells with PTX (100 ng/ml for 24 h) inhibited SP-induced inositol phosphate production by 80% (Fig. 3 a). PTX pretreatment also strongly inhibited SP (10−7m)-induced [Ca2+]iincrease in CHO-EDG1 cells (446 ± 20 versus 42 ± 3 nm in control and PTX-pretreated cells, respectively) (Fig. 3 b). In contrast, PTX pretreatment did not inhibit ATP-induced, P2 receptor-mediated [Ca2+]i increase (456 ± 7versus 414 ± 8 nm in control and PTX-pretreated cells, respectively). Similarly, in human erythroleukemia HEL cells stably expressing EDG1 (see below), SP-induced [Ca2+]i increase was PTX-sensitive. As shown in Fig. 4 a, both CHO cells and HEL cells express Gαq/11 as well as Gαi, indicating that dominant coupling of EDG1 via Gi to phospholipase C and Ca2+ mobilization is not attributable to a low-level expression of Gαq/11. To test a role for βγ subunits of Gi protein in SP-induced Ca2+ mobilization, we examined the effect of the overexpression of Gαt, a βγ scavenger (27Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), on SP-induced Ca2+ mobilization. The expression of Gαt substantially (75%) reduced SP-induced [Ca2+]i increase compared with the vector control (Fig. 4 b). In contrast, ATP-induced [Ca2+]i increase, which was PTX insensitive, was little inhibited by the expression of Gαt. These results are consistent with the notion that βγ subunits mediate SP-induced increase in the [Ca2+]i. We also examined the relation between phospholipase C activation and Ca2+mobilization in SP-stimulated CHO-EDG1 cells. Pretreatment of CHO-EDG1 cells with U73122 (10 μm), a phospholipase C inhibitor, nearly totally suppressed SP-induced inositol phosphate production (Fig. 5 a). U73122 also inhibited SP-induced [Ca2+]iincrease (Fig. 5 b), suggesting that SP mobilizes Ca2+ from intracellular pools through the action of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate.Figure 4Expression of Gαq/11 and Gαi in CHO and HEL cells, and a role of βγ subunits in SP-induced Ca2+ mobilization. a, Cell lysates (30 μg of protein/sample) from CHO, HEL, and COS7 cells were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed for expression of Gαq/11 and Gαi by Western blot analysis using specific anti-Gαq/11 antibody and anti-Gαi antibody. b, CHO cells were transiently co-transfected with EDG1 expression vector and either Gαt expression vector or empty vector.

Pretreatment of the cells with PTX totally abrogated SP-induced MAPK activation (Fig. 6 a). The addition of genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or the expression of a dominant negative form of Ras (Asn17-H-Ras) (24Mitsui H. Takuwa N. Kurokawa K. Exton J.H. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4904-4910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Takuwa N. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5348-5358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also strongly inhibited SP-induced MAPK activation by 60 and 83%, respectively (Fig. 6, a and b). In contrast, SP-induced MAPK activation was for the most part resistant to down-regulation of PKC by prolonged pretreatment of cells with phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (1 μm for 24 h) (Fig. 6 a). The same procedure abrogated MAPK activation in response to acute stimulation with phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate, implying that down-regulation-sensitive isoforms of PKC were effectively depleted (data not shown). The specific PKC inhibitor GF109203X (3 μm) (28Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) failed to inhibit SP-induced MAPK activation. GF109203X completely inhibited PDBu-induced MAPK activation (Fig. 6 a). Because SP-induced [Ca2+]iincrease and MAPK activation was sensitive to PTX, we examined whether SP decreased the cellular cAMP content via a PTX-sensitive G protein. As shown in Table I, SP reduced the forskolin-stimulated increase in the cAMP content by 46% in CHO-EDG1 cells. Pretreatment of cells with PTX (100 ng/ml for 24 h) totally abolished this effect of SP. SP was without effect on the cAMP content in parental CHO cells.Table ISP inhibits forskolin-induced increase in the cellular cAMP content in CHO-EDG1 cellsCellsPretreatmentStimulationcAMP contentpmol/wellCHONoneNone0.62 ± 0.05Forskolin9.65 ± 0.37] NSForskolin + SP9.65 ± 0.56PTXNone0.54 ± 0.02Forskolin6.31 ± 0.42] NSForskolin + SP5.81 ± 0.07CHO-EDG1NoneNone0.67 ± 0.01Forskolin8.64 ± 0.12] p< 0.051-aStatistically significant by Student's ttest.Forskolin + SP5.00 ± 0.49PTXNone0.68 ± 0.01Forskolin8.15 ± 0.15] NSForskolin + SP8.00 ± 0.07Cells pretreated or unpretreated with PTX (100 ng/ml for 24 h) were stimulated with forskolin (0.2 μm) for 5 min and then incubated with or without SP (3 × 10−10m) for a further 5 min in the presence of 0.2 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine.

Cellular cAMP contents were determined by radioimmunoassay. Results are the means ± S.E. of three determinations. NS, statistically not significant. In parental CHO cells, SP at higher concentrations (≥10−8m) slightly increased the [Ca2+]i probably because of a low level of the expression of endogenous SP receptor(s). Northern analysis of CHO mRNA (Fig. 1) reveals that CHO cells express a low level of mRNA of the putative SP receptor AGR16 (29An S. Bleu T. Huang W. Hallmark O.G. Coughlin S.R. Goetzl E.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), but not of EDG1 or EDG3, another putative SP receptor (29An S. Bleu T. Huang W. Hallmark O.G. Coughlin S.R. Goetzl E.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In addition, CHO cells show a marked [Ca2+]i increase response to a structurally related lipid LPA. To determine agonist specificity of EDG1, it was necessary to use a cell line that does not respond to either SP or related lipids. We found that HEL cells satisfied these criteria (Fig. 7 a), whereas other cell lines commonly used for transfection, including COS7 and HEK293, showed considerable background signals in response to SP, as reported by others (13van Koppen C.J. Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Laser K.T. Zhang C. Jabobs K.H. Bünemann M. Pott L J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2082-2087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, HEL cells detectably expressed none of transcripts of EDG1, EDG3, or AGR16 (Fig. 1). HEL cells also did not detectably express mRNA of the LPA receptors EDG2 or EDG4. We established a HEL cell clone stably expressing EDG1 (HEL-EDG1). In HEL-EDG1 cells, SP increased the [Ca2+]i dose dependently, with EC50 and maximal concentration values of ∼10−9 and 3 × 10−7m, respectively (Fig. 7 b). SPC was a much less potent agonist, with an EC50 value of ∼10−7m, although the maximal response obtained with SPC at 10−6m was comparable to that induced by SP. LPA, PA, and LysoPI induced small increases in the [Ca2+]i (15–20% of the maximal SP-induced response). However, LPA-induced [Ca2+]i increase was not abolished by the previous addition of SP (10−6m), unlike the SPC-induced [Ca2+]iresponse, which was inhibited by the previous addition of SP but not of prostaglandin E2 (Fig. 7 c). Similarly, PA- and LysoPI-induced [Ca2+]i responses were not inhibited by SP. These results may suggest that the [Ca2+]i increase induced by LPA and presumably PA and LysoPI were mediated by endogenous LPA receptors but not by EDG1. Consistent with this, HEL-EDG1 cells express a slight level of EDG4 transcript (Fig. 1). However, we cannot conclusively rule out the possibility that LPA, PA, and LysoPI act as very weak agonists for EDG1. Other lipids examined, which include sphingosine, sphingomyelin, ceramide (C2, C6 and C18), ceramide-1-phosphate, glucosylsphingosine, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, and lysophosphatidylserine, up to 10−6m did not increase the [Ca2+]i in HEL-EDG1 cells. We detected a specific binding of [32P]SP to HEL-EDG1 cells, which was inhibited dose dependently by the addition of unlabeled SP with an IC50 value of ∼5 × 10−8m (Fig. 8 a). In contrast, we did not detect a significant, specific binding of [32P]SP to parental HEL cells. We examined competition of [32P]SP binding to HEL-EDG1 cells by related lipids. SPC at 10−6m reduced [32P]SP binding (Fig. 8 b). Other related lipids examined did not compete with SP. In the present study, we characterized SP-induced signaling pathways in CHO and HEL cells that had been transiently or stably transfected with the EDG1 expression vector. The transient expression of EDG1 in CHO cells conferred responsiveness to SP in terms of Ca2+mobilization (Fig. 2 a) and MAPK activation (Fig. 2 b). In contrast, in vector-transfected controls SP at the dose examined did not elicit a response. Further examinations in CHO cells stably expressing EDG1 (CHO-EDG1) revealed that SP stimulation induced the production of inositol phosphates (Fig. 3 a) and inhibition of cAMP accumulation (Table I), both via PTX-sensitive Gi/o. Moreover, the present results (Fig. 4) suggest that the mechanism underlying SP-induced phospholipase C activation involves βγ subunits. SP stimulation of CHO-EDG1 cells also led to MAPK activation in ways typically observed for Gi-coupled receptors, i.e., in manners dependent on both tyrosine kinase and Ras but independent of PKC (Fig. 6). These composite results establish that EDG1 is a functional SP receptor that is coupled via Gi/o positively to phospholipase C and Ras/MAPK and negatively to adenylate cyclase. The present study determined the relative potency order of SP and other structurally related phospholipids as a receptor agonist for cloned EDG1. The results in HEL-EDG1 cells shown in Figs. 7 and 8 reveal that EDG1 is a high-affinity receptor for SP and is also considerably selective for SP. The EC50 value (10−9m) for the SP-induced [Ca2+]i response in HEL-EDG1 cells is very close to those reported for SP-induced [Ca2+]i increase in HEK293 cells (13van Koppen C.J. Meyer zu Heringdorf D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2082-2087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and for SP-induced activation of muscarinic K+ current in atrial myocytes (12Bünemann M. Liliom K. Brandt B.K. Pott L. Tseng J.L Desiderio D.M. Sun G. Miller D. Tigyi G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5527-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) but is much lower than those reported in Swiss 3T3 cells for SP-induced mitogenesis, [Ca2+]i increase, and MAPK activation (2Zhang H. Desai N.N. Olivera A. Seki T. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 8Goodemote K.A. Mattie M.E. Berger A. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11484-11488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In HEL-EDG1 cells (present study) and HEK293 cells (13van Koppen C.J. Meyer zu Heringdorf D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2082-2087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), SPC is much less potent than SP in increasing the [Ca2+]i, whereas in atrial myocytes SPC is nearly equipotent to SP (12Bünemann M. Liliom K. Brandt B.K. Pott L. Tseng J.L Desiderio D.M. Sun G. Miller D. Tigyi G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5527-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that there exist multiple SP receptor subtypes that are distinct from EDG1 (30Meyer Zu Heringdorf D. van Koppen C.J. Jakobs K.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). With respect to this, An et al. (29An S. Bleu T. Huang W. Hallmark O.G. Coughlin S.R. Goetzl E.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) reported very recently that EDG3 and AGR16 function as SP receptors, as evaluated by the serum response element-driven reporter system and Ca2+efflux from Xenopus oocytes. They did not report, however, the sensitivity of these responses to PTX or relative potencies of SP and related lipids as agonists for EDG3 and AGR16. While this manuscript was in review processes, two papers (31Lee M. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T.

Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) reported that HEK293 cells stably transfected with an EDG1 expression vector showed Rho-dependent cell aggregation in response to SP in a semisolid culture system. They also showed PTX-sensitive MAPK activation on stimulation with SP and high-affinity binding of [32P]SP to HEK293 cells stably expressing EDG1. However, they did not examine the coupling of EDG1 to other effector pathways, i.e., stimulation of the phospholipase C-[Ca2+]i axis and inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The other paper by Zondag et al. (32Zondag G.C.M. Postma F.R. Van Etten I. Verlaan I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) reports that insect Sf9 cells transfected with a baculovirus-encoding EDG1 showed a decrease in the cellular cAMP content in response to SP. Differently from the present study, however, SP failed to increase the [Ca2+]iin Sf9 cells expressing EDG1. They also showed in COS7 cells transiently transfected with an EDG1 expression vector that SP, but not SPC, at the concentration of 10−6m induced activation of MAPK, although they did not measure [Ca2+]i or inositol phosphate production. On the other hand, An et al. (29An S. Bleu T. Huang W. Hallmark O.G. Coughlin S.R. Goetzl E.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) reported that EGD1 did not mediate responses to SP in Jurkat T cells orXenopus oocytes. In summary, the present study establishes by using mammalian cell expression systems with a low background signal that EDG1 is coupled to concurrent activation of multiple effector pathways via a Gi/o protein, including Ras-MAPK, Ca2+mobilization with the activation of phospholipase C, and inhibition of adenylate cyclase (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). We also determined the relative [Ca2+]i-mobilizing potencies of a panel of structurally related compounds in HEL-EDG1 cells (Fig. 7), which reveals that SPC at exclusively higher concentrations can activate EDG1.

Gautum M. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). The Gαs subunits and Gαi subunits regulate adenylyl cyclase activities, while the Gαq subunits regulate phospholipase C activities. However, the function of the Gα12 class of G proteins, which includes Gα12 and Gα13, remains to be elucidated. Activated forms of Gα12 and Gα13, when transfected into fibroblast cells, were shown to induce transformation phenotypes (4Jiang H. Wu D. Simon M.I. FESB Lett. 1993; 330: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Hermouet S. Merendino J.J. Gutkind J.S. Spiegel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1994; 201: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), suggesting that this class of G proteins may be involved in cell growth regulation. Moreover, Gα12 and Gα13 were shown to induce formation of stress fibers in fibroblast cells through small G protein RhoA (7Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). This observation was supported by the report that Gα12 activated serum response factor (SRF) through RhoA (8Fromm C. Coso O.A. Montaner S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The in vivo function of Gα13 was also investigated using the gene-targeting technique in mice. Mice lacking Gα13 are embryonic lethal apparently due to the failure to develop vasculature structures, indicating that Gα13 may be involved in the function of endothelial cells (9Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In the same study, thrombin-mediated chemotaxis of fibroblasts lacking Gα13 was blocked, indicating that the thrombin receptor couples to Gα13. This is consistent with the observation that thrombin as well as a thromboxane A2 receptor agonist could stimulate the binding of a photo-affinity GTP analog to Gα13 (10Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Some of these proteins such as GIAP and RGS4 were shown to inhibit G protein-mediated signaling by interacting with the Gαiand Gαo subunits and stimulating their GTPase activities (13Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), which are also referred to as GTPase-activating protein activities. RGS2 and RGS4 were found to inhibit Gαq-mediated activation of phospholipase Cβ (14Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interestingly, most of these RGS proteins were unable to inhibit Gs-mediated signaling, and they could not stimulate the GTPase activity of the Gαs proteins (13Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar,14Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Regulation of the G12/13 proteins by RGS proteins has not been investigated. In this report, we characterized the abilities of the G protein subunits and of a number of GPCRs to stimulate SRF-mediated gene transcription using a cotransfection system. We found that the α subunits of the Gq and G12 classes of G proteins can induce SRF activation in a C3-dependent manner. We also found that the activation of SRF by some of GPCRs depends exclusively on Gαq/11, while others do not. Those that activate SRF independently of Gαq/11 may act through Gα12/13. In addition, we, for the first time, identified a RGS protein, RGS12, that can inhibit the Gα12/13function. -NIH3T3 and the Gαq/11-deficient cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The Gαq/11-deficient cell line was established from mice lacking both Gαq and Gα11 (17Offermanns S. Zhao L.P. Gohla A. Sarosi I. Simon M.I. Wilkie T.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4304-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). For transfection, cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were seeded into 24-well plates the day before transfection. Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of DNA/well using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.), as suggested by the manufacturer. The transfection was stopped after 3 h by switching to culture medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Cell extracts were collected 24 h later for luciferase assays. Luciferase assays were performed using Boehringer Mannheim Constant Light Luciferase Assay Kit as instructed. Cell lysates were first taken for determining in a Wallac multicounter the fluorescence intensity emitted by GFP proteins, which are cotransfected with the luciferase reporter gene plasmid and used to normalize the transfection efficiency. The Wallac counter (Wallac AG&G, Finland) is capable of counting both fluorescence and luminescence. Then, the luciferase substrate was added to the cell lysates, and luciferase activities were determined by measuring luminescence intensity using the same counter. Luminescence intensities were normalized against fluorescence intensities. DNA concentrations were adjusted if transfection of any of the cDNAs resulted in significant differences between normalized and non-normalized data. All of the G protein subunits and GPCRs were in pCMV expression vectors as described previously (18Wu D. Lee C.-H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wu D. Katz A. Lee C.-H. Jiang H. Simon M.I. J. Biol.

The SRE.L-luciferase reporter plasmid was constructed as described in Ref. 7Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, except the luciferase gene was used as the reporter instead of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. The CRE-luciferase reporter gene plasmid was purchased from Strategene, La Jolla, CA. RGS2, RGS4, and RGS12 (kindly provided by Sheng-Cai Lin) were also in the pCMV vector. Axin (kindly provided by F. Costantini) was in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). C3 was kindly provided by Alan Hall. A cotransfection system was used to characterize signal transduction pathways mediated by G proteins that lead to the regulation of SRF-dependent gene transcription. SRF-mediated gene transcription was evaluated by determining the activity of luciferase, the production of which is regulated by a transcription regulatory sequence element, called SRE.L. SRE.L is a derivative of c-Fos serum response element (SRE), to which SRF but not tertiary complex factor binds (21Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Thus, SRE.L-mediated production of luciferase mainly depends on the activity of SRF. The abilities of various G protein subunits to regulate SRE.L-mediated gene transcription were determined by cotransfecting NIH3T3 cells with the reporter gene plasmid and cDNA encoding one of constitutively active Gα subunits. We found that cells expressing activated α subunit of Gq, G11, G14, G16, G12, or G13, produced markedly higher levels of luciferase than those expressing the control β-galactosidase (LacZ), whereas expression of activated Gαi or Gαo did not (Fig. 1). This indicates that the α subunits of the Gq and G12 classes of G proteins can lead to SRF activation. The finding that C3 blocked SRF activation by the G protein α subunits suggests that the small GTP-binding protein RhoA (Fig. 1) may mediate the SRF activation. C3 (Clostridium butulinum C3 transferase) is a specific RhoA inactivator, which ADP-ribosylates RhoA (21Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). In our transfection system, C3 inhibited only RhoA-induced but not Cdc42- (Fig. 1) or Rac1- (data not shown) induced SRF activation, indicating that C3 acted specifically. Activation of SRF by the Gq and G12 family of G proteins allows us to determine which receptors can couple to these G proteins to activate SRF. Many cells, including fibroblasts, contain endogenous receptors for thrombin and LPA, which belong to a superfamily of GPCR. In addition, the thrombin receptor was shown previously to couple to the G12/13 proteins (10Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) so that it may function as a positive control. We found that both thrombin and LPA were able to stimulate SRE.L-mediated gene transcription in NIH3T3 cells transfected with the reporter gene plasmids (Fig. 2 A). This result suggests that NIH3T3 cells contain endogenous receptors for thrombin and LPA. A number of other GPCRs were also tested for their abilities to stimulate SRE.L-mediated gene transcription in transfected 3T3 cells. Cells expressing m1R and α1-AR showed marked increases in luciferase activities in response to carbachol and norepinephrine, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Neither carbachol nor norepinephrine elicited any change in the luciferase activity in cells transfected with the reporter gene plasmid alone (Fig. 1 A), indicating that there are no endogenous receptors for carbachol and norepinephrine in NIH3T3 cells. A mutant of α1-AR, α1-ARΔ2, was also tested in the same cotransfection system. α1-ARΔ2, which was unable to couple to Gαq/11to activate phospholipase C (22Wu D. Jiang H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9828-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), lost the ability to activate SRF in the presence of ligand norepinephrine. This suggests that α1-AR-mediated SRF activation appears to depend on Gαq/11 in fibroblasts. The fact that the expression of C3 was able to abolish thrombin-, LPA-, norepinephrine-, and carbachol-induced SRF activation suggests that the SRF activation by these ligands be mediated by RhoA (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, we tested Gi-coupling m2R and IL-8 receptor and Gs-coupling β2-AR. None of these receptors was able to stimulate SRF activity in response to their ligands (Fig. 2 B). These results are consistent with the observation that the Gi and Go are not involved in regulation of SRF. It has been demonstrated by various approaches that m1R and α1-AR couple to the Gq proteins (18Wu D. Lee C.-H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8081-8088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the receptors for thrombin and LPA have not been rigorously tested for their abilities to couple to the G proteins of the Gq family, they were shown previously to stimulate inositol phosphate accumulation (24Noh D.Y. Shin S.H. Rhee S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), suggesting that they may couple to the Gq proteins. To test the roles of Gαq/11 in SRF activation by these receptors, a fibroblast cell line derived from mice lacking Gq/11 was used. Thrombin, LPA, carbachol, and norepinephrine were added to the Gαq/11-deficient cells that were transfected with the SRE.L-luciferase reporter gene plasmid. Both thrombin and LPA were able to stimulate SRE.L-mediated gene transcription, which can be blocked by C3 (Fig. 3 A). Thrombin and LPA showed EC50 values of about 5 units and 4 μm in stimulation of luciferase activities, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, this cell line, like NIH3T3 cells, also contains endogenous thrombin and LPA receptors, and the receptors for thrombin and LPA are able to activate SRF independent of Gαq/11. The Gαq/11-deficient cells were also cotransfected with the cDNA encoding the thrombin receptor and the reporter gene plasmid, and cells expressing the recombinant thrombin receptors showed higher thrombin-induced production of luciferase than those transfected with the control plasmid (Fig. 3 A). Therefore, both endogenous and recombinant thrombin receptors are able to activate SRF in a Gαq/11-independent way.Figure 4Dose-dependent stimulation of SRF. The Gq/11-deficient cells were cotransfected with 0.15 μg of SRE.L-luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.15 μg of GFP expression construct, and 0.2 μg of LacZ (A, B), the endothelin receptor type 1a (C), and thromboxane A2 receptor (D). The next day, cells were lysed 6 h after the addition of thrombin (A), LPA (B), endothelin (C), and U46619 (D) with concentrations indicated in the figure. Data are processed and presented as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The inability of norepinephrine and carbachol to elicit reporter gene transcription (data not shown) may be due to the lack of endogenous receptors. Therefore, these two ligands were tested in the Gαq/11-deficient cells transiently expressing α1-AR and m1R, respectively. The ligands were still unable to elicit responses, even in the presence of the recombinant receptors (Fig. 3 B). However, the responses of cells to norepinephrine were restored when Gαq was reintroduced back into the Gαq/11-deficient cells by cotransfection with α1-AR and the reporter gene (Fig. 3 B). The same result was also observed for carbachol when m1R and Gαq were coexpressed in the Gαq/11-deficient cells (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, we conclude that α1-AR and m1R are dependent exclusively on Gαq/11 in SRF activation. This conclusion further strengthens the idea that the Gq proteins are capable of activating RhoA and SRF. Since α1-AR is able to couple to all the members of the Gq class of G proteins, including Gα14 and Gα16 (19Wu D. Katz A. Lee C.-H. Jiang H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25798-25802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the inability of α1-AR to activate SRF in the Gαq/11-deficient cell line suggests that there are not sufficient levels of endogenous Gα14 and Gα16 in this cell line. Thus, if any receptor can induce SRF activation in this cell line, it would suggest that this receptor is able to couple to G proteins other than the Gq class, which would be the G12/13 proteins. Thus, the Gαq/11-deficient cell line may be used for testing the coupling of receptors to the G proteins of the G12 class. We tested a number of receptors in this Gαq/11-deficient cell line, including the endothelin receptors 1a and 1b, thromboxane A2 receptor, angiotensin (AT) receptors type 1a and type 2, α2- and β2-AR, and dopamine receptors type 1 and 2. Endothelin was able to activate the SRF.L-mediated gene transcription in cells expressing endothelin receptor 1a (Fig. 3 C) or 1b (data not shown) with EC50 values of about 0.25 nm (Fig. 4 C and data not shown), while the thromboxane A2 receptor agonist U46619 gave an EC50 value of 1 nm (Figs. 3 C and 4 D). Angiotensin, norepinephrine, isoprenaline, and dopamine failed to elicit any SRF activation in cells expressing AT receptors, α1-AR, β2-AR, and dopamine receptors, respectively (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that endothelin receptors and the thromboxane A2 receptor may be able to couple to G12/13. The effects of Gβγ subunits on SRF activation were also tested in the same cotransfection system. Cells coexpressing β1 and γ1 or β1 and γ5 showed approximately 1-fold more luciferase activity than those expressing the control LacZ (Fig. 5 A). This result suggests that Gβγ subunits may also be involved in regulation of SRF, but with less potency than the Gαq and Gα12 subunits. To further investigate the role of Gβγ in SRF activation, we tested if Gβγ has any effect on Gα-mediated SRF activation by coexpressing activated Gα13 or Gαq with Gβγ. Interestingly, cells coexpressing Gα13QL and Gβ1γ1 or Gβ1γ5 showed higher luciferase activities than the sum of the activities shown by cells expressed Gβγ and Gα13 alone. This suggests that Gα13 may work synergistically with Gβγ in activation of SRF. Similar synergistic effects were also observed with Gαq and Gβγ. To confirm the above observation, the Gi-coupled m2-muscarinic receptor (m2R) was expressed in NIH3T3 cells, and carbachol-induced SRF-mediated transcription was determined. As expected, cells expressing m2R showed marginal carbachol-mediated increases in luciferase activities (Fig. 5 A), which may be attributed to Gβγ released from the Gi proteins, since Gαi does not activate SRF (Fig. 1). However, when m2R was coexpressed with m1R in NIH3T3 cells, there was a synergistic response to the muscarinic ligand carbachol (Fig. 5 B),i.e. carbachol induced more luciferase activities in cells coexpressing m1R and m2R than those expressing m1R or m2R alone. Furthermore, Pertussis toxin (Ptx), which did not inhibit the response to carbachol in cells expressing m1R, inhibited the response to carbachol in cells coexpressing m1R and m2R (Fig. 5 B). It appears that Ptx blocked only the part contributed by m2R. Ptx is a bacteria toxin that ADP-ribosylates the α subunits of the Gi, Go, and Gt proteins and blocks the activation of these G proteins by receptors. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Gβγ works synergistically with Gαq and Gα13 in regulation of SRF. The wild-type Gα12 and Gα13, when expressed in NIH3T3 cells, also showed significant stimulation of SRF-mediated transcription (Fig. 6 A), although the activity is usually one-fifth of that of the QL mutant when the same amount of DNA is used in transfection (data not shown). The relative high activities of the wild-type Gα12 and Gα13 may be due to the slow intrinsic GTPase activities of these Gα subunits (10Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 25Macrez-Lepretre N. Kalkbrenner F. Morel J.L. Schultz G. Mironneau J. J. Biol.

The SRF activation by the wild-type Gα12 and Gα13 allowed us to test if the RGS proteins could inhibit Gα12/13-mediated effects. We tested RGS2, RGS4, RGS12, and Axin. RGS2 and RGS4 are among the well characterized RGS proteins, which show GTPase-activating protein activities for the Gi and/or Gqfamilies of α subunits (13Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G.

Commun. 1997; 233: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and Axin (30Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry W.L.R. Lee J.J. Tilghman S.M. Gumbiner B.M. Costantini F. Cell. 1997; 90: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) are two recently cloned proteins that contain the RGS domains but have not been tested for their abilities to regulate G protein-mediated signaling. Coexpression of RGS12 significantly inhibited Gα12- and Gα13-induced SRF activation (Fig. 6 A), whereas RGS2, Axin (Fig. 6 A), and RGS4 (data not shown) showed little effects. Moreover, expression of RGS12 did not inhibit activated RhoA-mediated SRF activation (data not shown), indicating that inhibition of Gα12/13-mediated effects by RGS12 is not due to nonspecific inhibition of downstream proteins. The inhibition by RGS12 is also unlikely to be the result of the changes in the expression levels of cotransfected G proteins, since coexpression of RGS12, Axin, or RGS2 did not alter the expression levels of Gα12 or Gα13 (Fig. 6 E). Therefore, RGS12 is likely to affect the function of Gα12/13 directly. The effects of the RGS proteins on LPA and thrombin-mediated SRF activation were also tested in the Gαq/11-deficient fibroblast cell line, where LPA and thrombin-mediated SRF activation is presumably mediated by the G12 family of G proteins. The Gαq/11-deficient cells were cotransfected with SRE.L reporter plasmids and cDNA encoding RGS2, RGS4, RGS12, or Axin, and LPA-induced production of luciferase was determined. Cells expressing RGS12 showed consistently lower luciferase activities than those expressing the control LacZ, RGS2, RGS4, or Axin (Fig. 6 B). RGS12 was also able to inhibit thrombin-mediated SRF activation in the Gαq/11-deficient cells (data not shown). Since RGS12 was able to inhibit Gα12/13 (Fig. 6 A), RGS12-mediated attenuation of LPA and thrombin-induced SRF activation may result from the inhibition of endogenous Gα12/13proteins by RGS12 in the Gαq/11-deficient cells. The effects of RGS12 on other G protein-mediated signaling pathways were also investigated. RGS12 as well as RGS2, RGS4, or Axin did not affect β-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline-induced CRE-mediated gene transcription (Fig. 6 C), suggesting that none of the RGS proteins could inhibit the Gs function. However, all the RGS proteins except Axin were also able to inhibit norepinephrine-induced SRF activation in 3T3 cells expressing α1-AR (Fig. 6 D). As demonstrated earlier, α1-AR-mediated SRF activation is dependent on Gαq/11 proteins. Thus, inhibition of α1-AR-mediated SRF by the RGS proteins suggests that these RGS proteins may inhibit Gαq/11. Both RGS2 and RGS4 were also able to inhibit norepinephrine-induced phospholipase C activation in COS-7 cells coexpressing α1-AR. 2D. Wu, unpublished data. Thus, the action of RGS12 may not be specific to the G12 class of G proteins. In this report, we have characterized the involvement of G protein subunits in activation of SRF by a number of GPCRs. Our findings that Gα12 and Gα13 can activate SRF are consistent with previous reports that Gα12 activates SRF through RhoA (8Fromm C. Coso O.A. Montaner S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and that Gα12/13 induces formation of stress fibers via RhoA (7Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The literature, however, appears to be inconsistent with regard to the involvement of Gαq in SRF activation (8Fromm C. Coso O.A. Montaner S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 31Sah V.P. Hoshijima M. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31185-31190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Our findings described in this report demonstrate that not only Gαq, but also all other members of this class of G proteins can activate SRF probably through RhoA. The fact that m1R and α1-AR use Gαq/11 exclusively in activation of SRF strongly supports the involvement of Gq in SRF activation. Not all Gq-coupled receptors, however, activate SRF in Gαq/11-dependent pathways. Receptors, including the endothelin receptors and thromboxane receptor A2, both of which are known to couple to Gq to activate phospholipase C, can activate SRF in a Gαq/11-independent way (32Wange R.L. Smrcka A. Sternweis P. Exton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, receptors for thrombin and LPA can also lead to RhoA and SRF activation independently of Gαq/11, although these two receptors may also be able to couple to the Gi proteins in addition to the Gq proteins. Interestingly, among those we tested none of the receptors that are previously known to predominantly couple to Gi or Gs can induce activation of SRF in the presence or absence of Gαq/11. Unlike the Gα subunits of the Gq and G12classes, the expression of activated Gαo or Gαi does not activate SRF. In addition, Gsdoes not appear to activate SRF because the β-AR agonist isoprenaline did not stimulate SRF-mediated transcription in cells expressing β2-AR, while isoprenaline was able to stimulate CRE-mediated transcription. The inability of β-AR to activate SRF also suggests that β2-AR cannot couple to endogenous G12/13 in the fibroblasts. It is also apparent that m1R and α1-AR as well as α2-AR, β1-AR, the IL-8 receptor, and D1 and D2 receptors are unable to couple to Gα12 or Gα13, because these receptors could not activate SRF in the Gαq/11-deficient cells. The thromboxane A2 and thrombin receptors were shown previously to couple to Gα12 and Gα13 using different methods (9Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 10Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 33Post G.R. Collins L.R. Kennedy E.D. Moskowitz S.A. Aragay A.M. Goldstein D. Brown J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1679-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, SRF activation by these receptors should at least in part be mediated by Gα12/13. The LPA receptor and endothelin receptors may also be able to couple to Gα12/13 unless there exist yet-to-be identified G protein α subunits that can also activate SRF in the Gαq/11-deficient mouse fibroblast cells. Under the same premise, the inhibition of LPA and thrombin-induced SRF activation by RGS12 may be attributed to the inhibition of Gα12/13. In fact, RGS12 can inhibit recombinant Gα12 and Gα13-mediated SRF activation (Fig. 6 A). The inability of RGS2 and RGS4 to inhibit Gα12/13-, LPA-, or thrombin-mediated SRF activation indicates that these two RGS proteins do not act on Gα12/13. Therefore, there is apparent specificity in interactions between RGS proteins and G proteins. Although Axin contains a RGS domain, it is unable to regulate any of the known G proteins. Gβγ subunits are also involved in regulation of SRF, especially together with Gαq and Gα13. Since SRF is downstream of the signal cascade, we do not know where the Gα-mediated pathways interact with the Gβγ-mediated ones. It appears that the interactions are upstream of RhoA because C3 was able to completely abolish carbachol-mediated effects in cells coexpressing m1R and m2R. It is also not clear how Gαq and Gα13 regulate RhoA and SRF. Recent studies suggested that the Tec family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases may be regulated by Gαq (34Bence K. Ma W. Kozasa T. Huang X.Y. Nature. 1997; 389: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and Gα12/13 and that Tec kinases regulate RhoA in a C3-dependent manner. 3J. Mao and D. Wu, unpublished data. In addition, Gβγ was shown to regulate Btk, a member of the Tec family, via phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (35Li Z.M. Wahl M.I. Eguinoa A. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13820-13825Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Thus, the synergistic activation of SRF by Gα and Gβγ may lie in the kinases. Further studies are needed to better understand these questions. We thank Huiping Jiang and Mark Betz for reading the manuscript. We also thank Alan Hall, Solvio Gutkind, Sheng-Cai Lin, and F.

The nitration reaction has been extensively studied in vitro by bolus addition of authentic peroxynitrite, an experimental approach hardly reflecting in vivo situations in which the occurrence of peroxynitrite is thought to result from continuous generation of .NO and O-2 at physiological pH. In the present study, we measured the nitration of free tyrosine by .NO and O-2 generated at well defined rates from the donor compound (Z)-1-[N-[3-aminopropyl]-N-[4-(3-aminopropylammonio)butyl]-amino]- dia zen-1-ium-1,2-diolate] (spermine NONOate) and the xanthine oxidase reaction, respectively. The results were compared with the established nitration reaction triggered by authentic peroxynitrite. Bolus addition of peroxynitrite (1 mM) to tyrosine (1 mM) at pH 7.4 yielded 36.77 +/- 1.67 microM 3-nitrotyrosine, corresponding to a recovery of about 4%. However, peroxynitrite formed from .NO and O-2, which were generated at equal rates ( approximately 5 microM x min-1) from 1 mM spermine NONOate, 28 milliunits/ml xanthine oxidase, and 1 mM hypoxanthine was much less efficient (0.67 +/- 0.01 microM; approximately 0.07% of total product flow). At O-2 fluxes exceeding the .NO release rates, 3-nitrotyrosine formation was below the detection limit of the high performance liquid chromatography method (<0.06 microM). Nitration was most efficient (approximately 0.3%) with the .NO donor alone, i.e. without concomitant generation of O-2. Nitration by .NO had a pH optimum of 8.2, increased progressively with increasing tyrosine concentrations (0.1-2 mM), and was not enhanced by NaHCO3 (up to 20 mM), indicating that it was mediated by .NO2 rather than peroxynitrite. Our results argue against peroxynitrite produced from .NO and O-2 as a mediator of tyrosine nitration in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1983297072,"We have examined the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in regulation of calcium-dependent chloride secretion across T84 colonic epithelial cells. The calcium-mediated agonist carbachol (CCh, 100 μm) stimulated a time-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a range of proteins (with molecular masses ranging up to 180 kDa) in T84 cells. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (5 μm), significantly potentiated chloride secretory responses to CCh, indicating a role for CCh-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in negative regulation of CCh-stimulated secretory responses. Further studies revealed that CCh stimulated an increase in both phosphorylation and activity of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) isoforms of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Chloride secretory responses to CCh were also potentiated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, PD98059 (20 μm). Phosphorylation of ERK in response to CCh was mimicked by the protein kinase C (PKC) activator, phorbol myristate acetate (100 nm), but was not altered by the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X (1 μm). ERK phosphorylation was also induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) (100 ng/ml). Immunoprecipitation/Western blot studies revealed that CCh stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (EGFr) and increased co-immunoprecipitation of the adapter proteins, Shc and Grb2, with the EGFr. An inhibitor of EGFr phosphorylation, tyrphostin AG1478 (1 μm), reversed CCh-stimulated phosphorylation of both EGFr and ERK. Tyrphostin AG1478 also potentiated chloride secretory responses to CCh. We conclude that CCh activates ERK in T84cells via a mechanism involving transactivation of the EGFr, and that this pathway constitutes an inhibitory signaling pathway by which chloride secretory responses to CCh may be negatively regulated.

Chloride secretion across intestinal epithelial cells is under close regulation by hormonal, neural, paracrine, and endocrine factors. Such factors stimulate chloride secretion by binding to specific receptors on the surface of epithelial cells and consequently stimulating elevations in the levels of intracellular second messengers, such as cyclic nucleotides and calcium. In turn, increases in the levels of intracellular messengers activate the transport proteins that comprise the chloride secretory mechanism (1Barrett K.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1069-C1076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, even though both calcium and cyclic nucleotides are both capable of stimulating epithelial chloride secretion, it has been known for many years that these two classes of intracellular messengers stimulate temporally distinctive chloride secretory responses. While responses to cyclic nucleotide-mediated agonists, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide, are sustained, secretory responses to calcium-mediated agonists, such as the muscarinic agonist, carbachol (CCh),1 are transient, even though levels of intracellular calcium remain elevated after the secretory response has resolved (2Dharmsathaphorn K.

Invest. 1995; 96: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This implies that negative signals exist within intestinal epithelial cells that limit, or “switch off” epithelial secretory responses to calcium-mediated agonists. Since epithelial cells are continuously exposed, in vivo, to endogenously generated hormones and neurotransmitters that stimulate epithelial secretion via calcium-dependent mechanisms (5Kaunitz J.D. Barrett K.E. McRoberts J.A. Yamada T. Gastroenterology. 2nd Ed. Lippencott, Philadelphia, PA1995: 326-361Google Scholar), such inhibitory signals may represent an intrinsic epithelial “braking” mechanism by which excessive chloride, and consequently water, secretion may be prevented. Previous work from our laboratory has identified several intracellular messengers which appear to negatively influence calcium-mediated chloride secretion. Influx of extracellular calcium, generation of inositol (3,4,5,6)-tetrakisphosphate, and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) have all been shown to inhibit secretory responses to calcium-dependent agonists (1Barrett K.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1069-C1076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently we have shown that receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathways, such as those activated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) also activate intracellular pathways that are inhibitory to calcium-dependent secretion (6Uribe J.M.

J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C154-C161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulation of inositol (3,4,5,6)-tetrakisphosphate production (9Vajanaphanich M. Wasserman M. Buranawuti T. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. Gastroenterology. 1993; 104: A286Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) in response to calcium-dependent secretagogues have both been demonstrated to be dependent upon stimulation of tyrosine kinase activity, tyrosine kinases appear to play important role(s) in negative regulation of epithelial secretory processes. Indeed, recent studies demonstrate that tyrosine kinases may function in the regulation of apical cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl− channels (10Illek B. Fischer H. Santos G.F.

Fischer H. Machen T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C265-C275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both of which are transport proteins essential for epithelial chloride secretion. Although it has been demonstrated previously that calcium-dependent secretagogues stimulate intestinal epithelial tyrosine kinase activity (8Bischof G. Beate I. Reenstra W.W. Machen T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C154-C161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there is little known of the signaling pathways involved in such processes. However, some insight into how G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as the muscarinic receptor for CCh on colonic epithelia, might be linked to alterations in intracellular tyrosine kinase activity comes from studies in other models. In recent years, there has been a growing body of evidence to suggest that many GPCR agonists can activate the MAPK signaling cascade in a variety of cell types including epithelial cells (14Dabrowski A. Groblewski G.E. Schafer C. Guan K.-U. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 42: C1472-C1479Crossref Google Scholar, 15Wilkie N. Morton C.M. Ng L.L. Boarder M.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 33592-33597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The MAPK signaling cascade is classically involved in mediating the mitogenic actions of growth factors, such as EGF, and the mechanisms by which the EGF receptor (EGFr) is coupled to MAPK activation have been well elucidated (20Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding the EGFr becomes autophosphorylated and recruits the adapter molecules, Shc and Grb2, which bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated residues on the receptor by virtue of their SH2 domains. Formation of the EGFr-Shc-Grb2 complex leads to activation of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, mSOS, which in turn activates the low molecular weight G-protein, p21ras. This, in turn brings about activation of the upstream components of the MAPK cascade, Raf and MEK, ultimately leading to the stimulation of the ERK isoforms of MAPK. The mechanisms by which GPCRs stimulate ERK activation are less well understood but current evidence suggests the involvement of two predominant pathways which may be differentially activated depending on the nature of receptor coupling to heterotrimeric G-proteins (21van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 22Sugden P.H. Clerk A.

Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 466-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Gi protein-coupled receptors (GiPCR) appear to stimulate ERK activation predominantly by a mechanism involving increases in intracellular tyrosine kinase activity, and which may be mediated by transactivation of the EGF receptor. In contrast, Gq protein-coupled receptors (GqPCR) are believed to stimulate ERK predominantly via a tyrosine kinase-independent pathway mediated by PKC. However, recent studies indicate that these two pathways for ERK activation may not be mutually exclusive and that in some systems they may converge into a common p21ras-mediated pathway (24Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19125-19132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In the present study we sought to elucidate further the involvement of tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathways in negative regulation of calcium-dependent chloride secretion across T84 colonic epithelial cells. We employed CCh as a prototypic calcium-mediated secretagogue, which acts via Gq-protein coupled M3 muscarinic receptors on colonic epithelial cells to stimulate chloride secretion (25Dickinson K.E. Frizzell R.A. Chandra Sekar M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 225: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26O'Malley K.E. Farrell C.B. O'Boyle K. Baird A.W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 275: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In particular, we set out to investigate a possible role for the ERK isoforms of MAPK in regulation of CCh-stimulated secretion, and to determine possible mechanisms underlying CCh stimulation of ERK activity in T84 cells. Carbachol, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and genistein were obtained from Sigma. Tyrphostin AG1478, GF 902103X, and PD 98059 were obtained from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA. Epidermal growth factor was obtained from Genzyme, Cambridge, MA. Mouse anti-human EGF receptor and mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY. Rabbit anti-phospho-ERK antibodies were obtained from New England Biolabs. Tris glycine electrophoresis gels were obtained from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were of analytical grade and were obtained commercially. Methods for maintenance of T84cells in culture were as described previously (27Weymer A. Huott P. Liu W. McRoberts J.A. Dharmsathaphorn K. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1828-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, T84 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 media (JRH, Lenexa, KS) supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum. Cells were passaged by trypsinization. For Ussing chamber/voltage clamp experiments, approximately 106 cells were seeded onto collagen-coated polycarbonate filters (Nuclepore, Pleasanton, CA) glued onto Lexan rings, as described previously (27Weymer A. Huott P. Liu W. McRoberts J.A. Dharmsathaphorn K. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1828-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For Western blotting experiments and MAPK assays, 106 cells were seeded onto 30-mm Millicell transwell polycarbonate filters. When grown on polycarbonate filters T84 cells are known to retain the polarized phenotype of native colonic epithelia. Cells seeded onto filters were cultured for 7–10 days prior to use. Monolayers of T84cells were mounted in Ussing chambers (window area = 2cm2) and bathed in oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) Ringers' solution at 37 °C. The composition of the Ringers' solution was (in mm): 140 Na+, 5.2 K+, 1.2 Ca2+, 0.8 Mg2+, 120 Cl−, 25 HCO3−, 2.4 H2PO4−, 0.4 HPO42−, and 10 glucose. Monolayers were voltage-clamped to zero potential difference by the continuous application of short-circuit current (I sc). Under these conditions, changes in I sc(ΔI sc) in response to agonists are wholly reflective of electrogenic chloride secretion (28Mandel K.G. McRoberts J.A. Beuerlein G. Foster E.S. Dharmsathaphorn K. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C486-C494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polarized T84 cell monolayers grown on Millicell filters were washed (twice) with Ringers' solution, allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at 37 °C, and were then stimulated with agonists (± antagonists) for the times indicated. The reaction was stopped by washing in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and the cells were then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na+-vanadate, 1 mmsodium fluoride, and 1 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline) for 45 min. Cells were then scraped into microcentrifuge tubes, spun at 12,000 rpm for 10 min and the pellet was discarded. Samples were assayed for protein content (Bio-Rad protein assay kit) and adjusted so that each sample contained an equal amount of protein. For immunoprecipitation studies lysates were incubated with mouse anti-human EGFr for 1 h at 4 °C followed by another 1-h incubation at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose. Lysates were then centrifuged for 3 min at 15,000 rpm and the supernatant was discarded. The pellets were then washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in phosphate-buffered saline and were then resuspended in 2 × gel loading buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue). Samples were boiled for 3 min and were then loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel and proteins were separated by electrophoresis. Resolved proteins were transferred overnight at 4 °C onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA). After transfer the membrane was preblocked with a 1% solution of blocking buffer (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) for 30 min followed by a 1-h incubation with the appropriate concentration of primary antibody in 1% blocking buffer. After washing (3 × 10 min) in Tris-buffered saline with 1% Tween (TBST), membranes were then incubated for 30 min in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) in 1% blocking buffer. This was followed by three 10-min washes in TBST. Proteins were then detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN). Densitometric analysis of Western blots was carried out using NIH Image software. Cells were stimulated, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-phospho-ERK as described above in the immunoprecipitation and Western blotting protocol. ERK activity was determined using a commercially available assay kit (New England Biolabs). Briefly, immunoprecipates were washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in MAPK assay buffer. Washed immunoprecipates were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 100 μm ATP and 1 μg of Elk1 substrate in 50 μl of assay buffer. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 2 × gel loading buffer and samples were boiled for 3 min prior to SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of Elk1 by MAPK was determined by Western blotting (as described above) with antibodies specific for the phosphorylated form of Elk1. All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. for a series of n experiments. Student's ttests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Student-Newman-Keuls post-test were used to compare mean values as appropriate. pvalues < 0.05 were considered to represent significant differences. We first set out to examine the effects of CCh on protein tyrosine phosphorylation in T84 cells. Western blot analysis of T84 cell lysates revealed that, when stimulated with CCh (100 μm) on the basolateral domain, a rapid-onset tyrosine phosphorylation of several T84 cell proteins, with molecular masses ranging up to approximately 180 kDa, occurred (Fig. 1). To determine if the observed increases in protein tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by CCh are involved in regulation of CCh-stimulated chloride secretion, we next examined the effects of the general tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, onI sc responses to CCh across voltage-clamped monolayers of T84 cells. Pretreatment of T84cells with genistein (5 μm), which partially reversed CCh-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2, inset), significantly potentiated subsequent I sc responses to CCh (100 μm; Fig. 2), suggesting a possible role for CCh-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity in limiting the extent of CCh-stimulated secretory responses. Two of the proteins showing increased tyrosine phosphorylation in response to CCh had calculated molecular masses of 44 and 42 kDa, corresponding to the molecular masses of the ERK1 and ERK2 isoforms of MAPK, respectively. We therefore decided to investigate a possible role for ERK in negative regulation of CCh-stimulated secretory responses. Western blot experiments were first conducted which verified that ERK is phosphorylated in T84 epithelial cells in response to CCh stimulation (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, kinase assays, in which we measured the ability of anti-phospho-ERK immunoprecipitates to phosphorylate the ERK substrate, Elk, demonstrated that CCh-stimulated increases in ERK phosphorylation were closely accompanied by increases in ERK activity (Fig. 3 B). In order to determine if CCh stimulation of ERK phosphorylation is a specific effect mediated by activation of cholinergic receptors, we examined the effect of the muscarinic M3 receptor antagonist, 4-DAMP, on CCh-stimulated responses. 4-DAMP (100 nm) abolishedI sc responses to CCh across voltage-clamped T84 cells. Control responses to CCh were 21.5 ± 7.5 μA/cm2 compared with 0.4 ± 0.2 μA/cm2in 4-DAMP-pretreated cells (n = 4). 4-DAMP (100 nm) also abolished ERK activation in response to CCh. ERK phosphorylation in CCh-stimuated cells was 27.5 ± 8.2-fold that in unstimulated cells compared with a 1.4 ± 1.0-fold stimulation in 4-DAMP-pretreated cells (n = 3). In order to test the hypothesis that CCh-stimulated ERK activation may be involved in regulation of CCh-stimulated chloride secretion, we examined the effects of a specific inhibitor of ERK activation, PD 98059, on both ERK phosphorylation and I sc responses to CCh. Pretreatment of T84 cell monolayers with PD 98059 caused a concentration-dependent reduction in phosphorylation of ERK in response to CCh (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, PD 98059 (20 μm), which reduced CCh-stimulated ERK phosphorylation by 53.7 ± 19.9% (n = 3; p < 0.05), potentiated subsequent I sc responses to CCh across voltage-clamped monolayers of T84 cells (Fig. 4 B). Maximal responses to CCh were 31.2 ± 5.3 μA/cm2 in control cells compared with 50.7 ± 7.4 μA/cm2 in PD90859-treated cells (n = 7;p < 0.05). PD 98059 also prolonged CCh-stimulatedI sc responses so that I scvalues in PD 98059-treated monolayers remained signficantly higher (p < 0.01 or better) than those in control monolayers up to 15 min after addition of the agonist. To date two mechanisms have been proposed by which GPCRs may bring about ERK activation. One is mediated by a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway, which may involve transactivation of the EGFr, while the other is a PKC-mediated tyrosine kinase-independent pathway (21van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 22Sugden P.H. Clerk A.

Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 466-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Both pathways for ERK activation appear to be present and functional in T84 cells since both EGF (100 ng/ml) and the phorbol ester, PMA (100 nm), stimulate T84 cell ERK phosphorylation, albeit with different kinetics and to different extents than does CCh (Fig. 5, compare with Fig. 3). In the next series of experiments we set out to investigate the extent to which either, if any, of these pathways is involved in mediating the effects of CCh on ERK activity. Since one of the proteins displaying increased phosphorylation in response to CCh was a 180-kDa protein corresponding to the molecular mass of the EGFr (Fig. 1), we first examined a possible role for the EGFr in mediating the effects of CCh on ERK activation. Immunoprecipitation studies were carried out which verified that CCh (100 μm) stimulated a time-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFr (Fig. 6 A). The time course of the response was similar to that observed for CCh stimulation of ERK phosphorylation (cf. Fig. 3). CCh also stimulated an increase in co-immunoprecipitation of the adapter proteins, Shc and Grb2 with EGFr (Fig. 6, B and C). As expected, EGF itself (100 ng/ml) also stimulated phosphorylation of the EGFr and increased co-immunoprecipitation of both Shc and Grb2 with the EGFr (Fig. 6, A-C). Taken together, these data imply that CCh stimulates transactivation of EGFr in T84 cells, and, in a fashion similar to that of EGF, stimulates the formation of Shc-Grb2-EGFr complexes. Formation of such complexes is normally a prerequisite for ERK activation in many cell types.Figure 6CCh stimulates EGFr phosphorylation and increases co-immunoprecipitation of the adapter proteins, Shc and Grb2, with the EGFr. Cells were stimulated with basolateral CCh (100 μm) for the times indicated or with basolateral EGF (100 ng/ml; 1 min) and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFr antibodies. After separation by SDS-PAGE and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, Western blots were probed with: A,antiphosphotyrosine; B, anti-Shc; or C,anti-Grb2. Immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Each blot is representative of at least three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined the effects of a specific inhibitor of EGFr activation, tyrphostin AG1478, on CCh-stimulated ERK phosphorylation. Pretreatment of T84 cells with tyrphostin AG1478 (1 μm) abolished the effects of CCh on EGFr phosphorylation and significantly inhibited CCh-stimulated ERK activation (Fig. 7 A). In the presence of tyrphostin AG1478 CCh-stimulated ERK phosphorylation was reduced by 51.8 ± 4.0% (n = 7; p < 0.01). Thus, transactivation of the EGFr appears to mediate a significant proportion of the effects of CCh on ERK activation in T84cells. Furthermore, we found that, similar to findings with the ERK inhibitor PD 98059, tyrphostin AG1478 also potentiatedI sc responses to CCh across voltage-clamped monolayers of T84 cells (Fig. 7 B), supporting a role for transactivation of the EGFr, with subsequent activation of ERK, in negative regulation of CCh-stimulated epithelial secretion. In order to determine a possible role for PKC in the effects of CCh on ERK activation, we examined the effects of a cell-permeable inhibitor of PKC activity, GF109203X, on CCh-stimulated ERK phosphorylation. Pretreatment of T84cells with GF109203X (1 μm) significantly inhibited ERK phosphorylation responses to PMA. Responses in cells treated with PMA in the presence of GF109203X were 58.8 ± 5.0% of those in cells stimulated with PMA alone (n = 3; p < 0.05). In contrast, GF109203X did not alter CCh stimulation of ERK phosphorylation when used alone, nor did it have any additional effect above that induced by the EGFr inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1478 when both inhibitors were used in combination (Fig. 8). These data imply that neither GF109203X-sensitive isoforms of PKC nor other potential nonspecific targets of GF109203X, are involved in mediating the effects of CCh on ERK activity in T84 epithelial cells. In the present study we have investigated a possible role for tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathways in negative regulation of calcium-mediated epithelial chloride secretion. In agreement with previous studies in another colonic epithelial cell line, HT-29 (8Bischof G. Beate I. Reenstra W.W. Machen T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C154-C161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that the prototypic calcium-mediated secretagogue, CCh, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in T84 cells. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation was rapid in onset, occurring within 1 min, with maximal tyrosine phosphorylation occurring after approximately 5 min, a time corresponding to that at which CCh-stimulated secretory responses return to basal levels. This increase in tyrosine kinase activity appears to be involved in regulation of CCh-stimulated secretion since the broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, significantly potentiated both the magnitude and duration of CCh-stimulatedI sc responses. These data suggest that, concommitant to stimulation of chloride secretion, CCh stimulates epithelial tyrosine kinase activity which appears to function in limiting the extent of CCh-stimulated secretory responses. Since two of the proteins displaying increased tyrosine phosphorylation in response to CCh had molecular weights corresponding to those of the ERK 1 and 2 isoforms of MAPK, we extended our studies to investigate a possible role for these enzymes in regulation of epithelial secretion. Although MAPK activation is classically associated with regulation of cell growth and differentiation, our studies also reveal an apparent acute role for ERK in negative regulation of calcium-mediated chloride secretion across intestinal epithelial cells. This conclusion stems from the observations that not only does CCh rapidly stimulate increases in ERK phosphorylation and activity in T84 cells, but pretreatment of T84 cells with PD 98059 leads to increases in both the magnitude and duration of CCh-stimulated secretory responses. PD 98059 is reported to be a highly specific inhibitor of the upstream component of the MAPK cascade, MEK, and has been shown reliably to inhibit ERK activation in a variety of systems (15Wilkie N.

The idea that CCh simultaneously activates both prosecretory and antisecretory signaling pathways is supported by the finding that the muscarinic M3 receptor antagonist, 4-DAMP, not only inhibited CCh-stimulated I sc responses, but also abolished the effects of CCh on ERK phosphorylation. Thus, it appears that net CCh-stimulated secretory responses are determined not only by the extent of stimulation of prosecretory pathways, but also by the extent to which negative signaling intermediates, such as ERK, are activated. The mechanisms by which GPCRs stimulate ERK activation are complex and appear to be dependent not only on the nature of receptor coupling to heterotrimeric G-proteins, but also upon cell type (21van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 22Sugden P.H. Clerk A.

However, in most cell types studied to date, ERK activation in response to GqPCR stimulation (14Dabrowski A. Groblewski G.E. Schafer C. Guan K.-U. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 42: C1472-C1479Crossref Google Scholar, 31Liao D.-F. Monia B. Dean N. Berk B.C. J. Biol.

J. 1993; 294: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), is a PKC-mediated process. Even though our data with PMA indicate that stimulation of PKC can be linked to ERK activation in T84 cells, this pathway does not appear to represent a mechanism by which CCh stimulates ERK activity in these cells. Thus, GF 902103X, which inhibited PMA-stimulated T84 cell ERK activation, and which has been shown to inhibit GqPCR-stimulated ERK activation in other cells (14Dabrowski A. Groblewski G.E. Schafer C. Guan K.-U. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 42: C1472-C1479Crossref Google Scholar), had no effect on ERK phosphorylation in response to CCh. Rather, our data strongly support a role for transactivation of the EGFr, a pathway normally favored by Gi-PCR (21van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 22Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 23Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Della-Rocca G.J. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 466-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), in mediating the effects of CCh on ERK activation. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, CCh stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFr with a time course similar to that for ERK activation. Second, CCh stimulates recruitment of the adapter proteins, Shc and Grb2, to the EGFr. Association of these proteins with receptor tyrosine kinases is well documented as being an early step in growth factor-mediated activation of the MAPK cascade (20Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). Finally, at concentrations which have been demonstrated to block autophosphorylation of the EGFr, but not that of other EGFr family members (34Gamett D.C. Pearson G. Cerione R.A. Friedberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12052-12056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 35Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar), we found that tyrphostin AG1478 not only inhibtited CCh-stimulated EGFr phosphorylation in T84 cells, but also significantly reduced CCh-stimulated ERK phosphorylation. Furthermore, similar to the ERK inhibitor, PD 98059, tyrphostin AG1478 potentiatedI sc responses to CCh across voltage-clamped T84 cell monolayers. Thus, our data support a role for a CCh-stimulated signaling pathway, involving transactivation of the EGFr and subsequent ERK activation, which negatively influences simultaneous CCh-stimulated chloride secretory responses. Of note, our studies were conducted on polarized cells where the EGFr and M3muscarinic receptor are known to be localized to the basolateral membrane. This may imply that particular spatial interrelationships are required to mediate the receptor transactivation events discussed here. It is also of note that even though tyrphostin AG1478 abolished CCh-stimulated transactivation of the EGFr, significant ERK phosphorylation remained in the presence of the antagonist, implying more than one pathway may exist by which CCh stimulates ERK activation. This residual, EGFr-independent ERK phosphorylation does not appear to be mediated by PKC since GF 902103X was not only ineffective in reducing CCh-stimulated ERK phosphorylation when used alone, but was also without effect when used in combination with tyrphostin AG1478. Further studies are required in order to identify this apparent PKC- and EGFr-independent mode of T84 cell ERK activation in response to CCh. It is not yet known how CCh-stimulated transactivation of the EGFr and subsequent ERK activation might interact with epithelial transport pathways to bring about inhibition of chloride secretion. Some studies implicate cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator chloride channels, which are believed to be an important exit pathway for chloride in response to calcium-dependent secretagogues, as a possible target for inhibitory tyrosine kinase-dependent signals (36Reenstra W.W. Yurko-Mauro K. Dam A. Raman S. Shorten S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C650-C657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Yang I. Cheng T.-H. Wang F. Price E.M. Hwang T.-C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 272: C142-C155Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies demonstrate roles for M1 muscarinic receptor-mediated transactivation of the EGFr in regulation of K+ channels in kidney cells (38Tsai W. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4597-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and for ERK in regulation of K+ channel function in neuronal cells (39Lev S. Martineez R. Canoll P. Pele E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to determine if similar processes are involved in ERK-mediated inhibition of CCh-stimulated secretion in T84 cells. Likewise, additional studies are required to define possible interactions between CCh-stimulated ERK activity and other signals believed to be involved in negative regulation of calcium-dependent chloride secretion, such as agonist-stimulated influx of extracellular calcium (4Vajanaphanich M. Schultz C. Tsien R.Y. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Pandol S.J. Barrett K.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Of particular note in this regard are the recent findings of Rosen and Greenberg (40Rosen L.B. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) who have demonstrated that influx of calcium through voltage-sensitive calcium channels stimulates EGFr phosphorylation, association of Grb2 and Shc with the EGFr, and ERK activation in PC12 neuronal cells. Similarly, it has been demonstrated that calcium influx and a novel calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase, PYK-2, are important in mediating the effects of GPCR receptor activation on ERK activity and subsequent K+ channel inhibition in HEK-293 kidney cells (24Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T.

Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Although a possible role for CCh-stimulated calcium influx in mediating the effects of the agonist on ERK activation in T84 cells has yet to be investigated, preliminary studies from our laboratory indicate that T84 cells not only express PYK-2, but that the enzyme becomes associated with the EGFr upon stimulation with CCh. 2S. J. Keely, L. S. Bertelsen, and K. E. Barrett, unpublished observations.Thus, CCh-stimulated influx of extracellular calcium may represent an early step in a signaling cascade which ultimately results in stimulation of ERK activity via transactivation of the EGFr. In summary, we have shown that CCh stimulates activation of the ERK isoforms of MAPK in colonic epithelial cells, and that this appears to be involved in limiting the extent of CCh-stimulated chloride secretory responses. Stimulation of ERK activity by CCh occurs via a pathway independent of PKC, but which involves transactivation of the EGFr. We speculate that since chloride is the predominant ion driving fluid secretion in the intestine (5Kaunitz J.D. Barrett K.E. McRoberts J.A. Yamada T. Gastroenterology. 2nd Ed. Lippencott, Philadelphia, PA1995: 326-361Google Scholar), agonist-stimulated transactivation of the EGFr and subsequent activation of ERK may represent a physiological braking mechanism to prevent excessive electrolyte and fluid loss when the levels of calcium-dependent secretagogues are elevated within the intestinal mucosa.

Targeting to caveolae facilitates eNOS activation following receptor stimulation, but in resting cells, eNOS is tonically inhibited by its interactions with caveolin, the scaffolding protein in caveolae.

A wide variety of signaling proteins undergo subcellular translocation following their activation. Protein kinases, heterotrimeric G proteins, receptors, phospholipases; all these and many other signaling proteins may migrate from membrane to cytosol, from cytosol to membrane, or from one membrane compartment to another. For one protein, translocation may promote the desensitization of the signaling response; for another, subcellular translocation may be essential to fully activate the cell signaling pathway. These subcellular migrations may be modulated by reversible protein acylations, phosphorylations, protein-protein interactions, or ligand binding. The endothelial isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS)1 can be modified by all of these processes; eNOS is regulated by both acylation and phosphorylation, and the protein reversibly interacts with disparate other proteins and ligands (for review, see Ref. 1Sase K. Michel T. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, data on the role of the subcellular localization of eNOS in the enzyme's dynamic regulation remain controversial. Previous reports have assigned eNOS to the Golgi apparatus (2Sessa W.C.

Some investigators have failed to observe any agonist-promoted eNOS subcellular translocation (8Liu J. Garcia-Cardena G. Sessa W.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12333-12340Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), yet others have used biochemical approaches to suggest that the enzyme's targeting can be dynamically regulated (9Michel T. Li G.K. Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 10Dudek R. Wildhirt S. Suzuki H. Winder S. Bing R.J.

Brain Res. 1995; 696: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Using quantitative immunofluorescence imaging techniques, the current studies establish that eNOS is targeted to the cell membrane and that the enzyme's intracellular distribution is dynamically regulated by Ca2+-mobilizing agonists in vascular endothelial cells. eNOS is a Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent enzyme and is transiently activated by increases in intracellular Ca2+elicited by activation of diverse G protein-coupled receptors in endothelial cells and cardiac myocytes. Bradykinin represents one important endogenous activator of eNOS in the vascular wall. In the vascular endothelium, bradykinin binds to and stimulates Ca2+-mobilizing B2 receptors, leading to vasorelaxation and to inhibition of platelet aggregation. eNOS undergoes acylation by the fatty acids myristate and palmitate; these modifications are required to target eNOS to the specialized signal-transducing domains in the plasma membrane termed caveolae. Other signaling proteins directly involved in eNOS regulation are also localized in caveolae, including the B2 bradykinin receptor (12de Weerd W.F.C. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17858-17866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and the m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor in cardiac myocytes. Targeting to caveolae thus appears to facilitate eNOS activation by these Ca2+-coupled signaling pathways. In resting endothelial cells, the eNOS enzyme is tonically inhibited by its protein-protein interactions with caveolin, the resident scaffolding protein in plasmalemmal caveolae. In response to Ca2+-mobilizing agonists, calmodulin both promotes the dissociation of caveolin from eNOS and directly activates the enzyme. Biochemical approaches have also established that prolonged agonist treatment leads to translocation of a proportion of the eNOS protein from particulate to more soluble subcellular fractions, associated with phosphorylation (9Michel T. Li G.K. Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and depalmitoylation (13Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) of the enzyme. However, the cell biological correlates of agonist-induced translocation remain obscure, and the biochemical data are controversial. We have therefore explored the regulation of eNOS targeting using cellular imaging approaches and have discovered that the enzyme is reversibly targeted to endothelial cell membranes and that changes in intracellular Ca2+ represent a key determinant for eNOS redistribution. Tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. eNOS monoclonal and caveolin polyclonal antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. Secondary antibodies (rhodamine- or fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse, rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit) were from Pierce. Fluo-3/AM was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); BAPTA/AM was from Calbiochem; HOE140 was from Hoechst. Other reagents were from Sigma. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were purchased from Cell Systems and maintained in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (complete medium), as described previously (14Lamas S. Marsden P.M. Li G.K. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6348-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin, A23187, and BAPTA/AM were dissolved in Me2SO, and cells were treated with thapsigargin (5 μm final concentration) and A23187 (10 μm) in Hanks' balanced salt solution with or without Ca2+ (1.5 mm) for 5 min at 37 °C. For studying effects of BAPTA, cells were preincubated with BAPTA/AM (20 μm final concentration) in complete medium at 37 °C for 30 min. The stock solution of bradykinin was prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and used at various final concentrations in complete medium at 37 °C. For cell imaging studies, BAEC were cultured onto gelatin-coated glass coverslips the day before analysis; cells were studied at passage 6. BAEC were fixed in 2% freshly prepared paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized by adding (final concentrations) 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 5 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature (or overnight at 4 °C) in 10% goat serum and then with monoclonal anti-eNOS antibody at 1:250 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and then incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody at 1:200 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. A similar protocol was followed for the immunostaining of BAEC with Na+/K+-ATPase and caveolin-1 antibodies. Cells were analyzed using a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope equipped with differential interference contrast optics. The cells were imaged at × 100–1000 magnification using a charge-coupled device camera (model CH250, Photometrics Ltd.) cooled to −40 °C. We used conservative criteria to determine the presence of membrane-associated eNOS immunostaining. Since the membrane staining of eNOS was usually nonuniform in each individual cell, a cell was assigned as eNOS membrane-positive if even a small patch of membrane-associated eNOS was detected. Quantitative analyses of cells for the presence of membrane-associated eNOS were performed in a completely blinded fashion, after which the data were collated and normalized to the proportion of cells with membrane-associated eNOS under basal conditions. For each experiment at least 100 cells/coverslip were analyzed. Results are reported as an average of at least four independent blinded experiments performed in duplicate on different days; interexperimental variability was less than 5%. Intracellular calcium determinations with the indicator dye Fluo-3 were performed as described previously (15Kao J.P.Y. Harootunian A.T. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8179-8184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A stock solution of Fluo-3/AM, 1 mm in Me2SO was diluted to the final concentration of 10 μm with Hanks' balanced salt solution. One ml of this solution was layered on a coverslip bearing BAEC, and cells were incubated for 60 min at room temperature in the dark. Cells were then washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution, sealed onto a custom microscopy chamber, and examined immediately. The chamber was designed to facilitate addition and removal of medium without disturbing the cells. A diamond pencil was used to cut two slivers of equal size from a No. 1 coverslip. The silvers were sealed on a glass slide with nail polish at the two longitudinal edges, creating a channel in the center. Pressure was applied to ensure uniform sealing and leveling of the slivers. The coverslip bearing BAEC was inverted and sealed on the slivers with nail polish, forming a chamber that held approximately 100 μl of medium. The stock solution of bradykinin was diluted to 1 μm(final concentration) with complete medium and used immediately. A 1-ml tuberculin syringe containing bradykinin solution or medium alone was used to exchange at least 300 μl of medium rapidly, ensuring complete medium exchange for each experimental treatment. Epifluorescence microscopy was used to record fluorescence images of cells in real time after bradykinin treatment. Typically, six to eight cells were identified in a field of view (× 250 magnification), and changes in the integrated fluorescence intensity of each cell were monitored over time. Image processing software (Metamorph, Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA) was used to draw cell boundaries and to integrate the fluorescence intensity over all pixels within the boundary of each cell. Calcium measurements were not affected by the exchange of drug-free medium alone. Immunostaining of BAEC using monoclonal eNOS antibody revealed a robust pattern of immunofluorescence (Fig. 1); when nonimmune mouse IgG1 was used as the primary antibody in identically processed samples, there was no staining (not shown). The cellular distribution of eNOS and caveolin immunoreactivity exhibited considerable heterogeneity. The majority of untreated endothelial cells (∼60–80%) showed prominent eNOS immunostaining at the cell periphery; the remaining 20–40% of cells had no evident staining at the cell edge and showed eNOS distributed only in a patchy intracellular pattern with enhanced perinuclear staining (Fig. 1 A). This patchy pattern of immunofluorescence has been observed for other caveolae-targeted proteins such as caveolin, cationic amino acid transporter protein, and c-Src, as well as prototypical “plasma membrane” receptors such as the cholecystokinin receptor and the high density lipoprotein receptor SR-B1 (16Smart E.J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1029-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The precise identity of the intracellular sites at which these proteins localize remains less well understood. As shown in Fig. 1 C, caveolin and eNOS shared a similar but incompletely overlapping pattern of distribution in endothelial cells, with staining for the two proteins seen both at the plasma membrane and in similar intracellular locales. The proportion of untreated cells without detectable eNOS at the membrane was variable from experiment to experiment (range 20–40%), but was quite consistent under identical experimental conditions within duplicate analyses. This heterogeneous pattern of membrane staining suggested that eNOS targeting may be influenced by cellular processes not definitively controlled in these experiments. Quantitative analyses of endothelial cells with any membrane-associated eNOS showed that ∼70% of the cells' total immunoreactivity was present at the plasma membrane. Even within the positively staining endothelial cells, the membrane distribution of eNOS was usually nonuniform, and there were often large patches of eNOS-positive membrane located immediately adjacent to eNOS-negative regions (see Fig. 1). Importantly, when endothelial cells were treated with bradykinin (1 μm, 5 min), the pattern of eNOS immunostaining markedly changed (Fig. 1 B); compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1 A), BAEC treated with bradykinin showed a dramatic redistribution of eNOS from the cell membrane to a distinct ring pattern around the cell nucleus. Using similar immunofluorescence techniques, we found (data not shown) that the cellular distribution of other membrane-associated proteins (Na+/K+-ATPase; caveolin) exhibited no cellular redistribution following bradykinin treatment. The next series of experiments sought to validate the pharmacological characteristics of the bradykinin-induced eNOS redistribution. Given the heterogeneity of eNOS immunostaining within and between BAEC, we devised a conservative criterion for assessing whether eNOS translocation from the membrane had taken place. Endothelial cells showing any identifiable membrane-associated eNOS immunostaining were scored as “membrane-positive”; only those cells completely devoid of membrane-associated eNOS were scored as negative. All samples were coded to permit the analyses to be performed and quantitated by an blinded observer unaware of the experimental treatment of the samples. Each experiment was performed in duplicate and repeated at least four times on different days using independently cultured cells. Because the proportion of cells scored as eNOS membrane-positive under basal conditions ranged from ∼60% to more than 80%, for each experiment results were normalized to the measured basal value on that day. For the analyses performed on any given day, duplicate values were reproducible within each experimental treatment; the percentage of cells positive for eNOS membrane targeting for any particular treatment varied by <5% between duplicate samples. Having validated the reproducibility and robustness of this experimental approach, we performed a dose-response analysis for bradykinin induced redistribution of eNOS (Fig. 2). After treating BAEC for 5 min with varying concentrations of bradykinin, the cells were fixed and immunostained, and the proportion of cells with membrane-associated eNOS were quantitated. The EC50 for promotion of eNOS translocation by bradykinin was 1 nm; the maximum effect was observed at 1 μm bradykinin. The B2-receptor antagonist HOE140 completely blocked bradykinin-induced eNOS redistribution; HOE140 alone did not affect eNOS distribution (data not shown). The time courses of bradykinin-stimulated redistribution of eNOS and of bradykinin-stimulated changes in intracellular Ca2+concentration are shown in Fig. 3,A and B, respectively. For immunofluorescence experiments, BAEC were treated with 1 μM bradykinin for varying times, then fixed and processed as described above. For measurements of intracellular Ca2+ concentration, BAEC were first incubated with the indicator dye Fluo-3 for 60 min, then exposed to bradykinin (1 μm) while determining the fluorescence emission of intracellular Fluo-3 at varying times. Treatment of endothelial cells with bradykinin resulted in a rapid loss of eNOS protein from the membrane; within 5 min, only 10 ± 4% of the BAEC originally showing eNOS membrane staining remained positive (n = 25). Upon prolonged incubation with bradykinin, the proportion of eNOS at the membrane gradually recovered; 60 min following addition of bradykinin, the proportion of cells with positive eNOS membrane staining reached 82 ± 8% of the value seen before the addition of drug (n = 4). The time course of the bradykinin-induced increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) followed a similar but not identical time course (Fig. 3 B). There was a rapid initial rise of [Ca2+]i nearly to maximal values within 1 min following the addition of bradykinin, followed by a slower increase of [Ca2+]i over the next 20 min. The bradykinin-induced increase in [Ca2+]i began to return to base line after 30 min following addition of bradykinin, associated with the recovery of membrane-associated eNOS. The similar temporal patterns of bradykinin-induced changes in [Ca2+]i and eNOS distribution led us to conduct a series of experiments to investigate further whether eNOS translocation might be mediated by changes in intracellular Ca2+. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, the calcium ionophore A23187 promoted a rapid translocation of eNOS from the membrane (Fig. 4 A). However, when A23187 was added to BAEC in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, there was a significant and reproducible increase in the proportion of cells scored positive for eNOS membrane association. Presumably, this reflected the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by the equilibration between intracellular Ca2+ and a large volume of extracellular Ca2+-free medium. This interpretation was consistent with the effects of treating BAEC with thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, which is known to increase [Ca2+]i. As shown in Fig. 4 A, addition of thapsigargin to endothelial cells promoted eNOS translocation from the membrane. In contrast, when BAEC were treated with A23187 plus thapsigargin in Ca2+-free medium, there was an increase in the proportion of cells with membrane-targeted eNOS. These results indicate that the [Ca2+]i plays a crucial role in the membrane targeting of eNOS. Bradykinin B2 receptors are coupled through G proteins to the activation of phospholipases C and A2 (21Mombouli J.-V. Vanhoutte P.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 679-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), leading to the transient increases in [Ca2+]i characteristic of the physiological response to bradykinin (22Adams D.J. Barakeh J. Laskey R. Van Breeman C. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2389-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The influence of intracellular Ca2+ on eNOS translocation was explored further using the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA. As shown in Fig. 4 B, preincubation of endothelial cells with BAPTA completely blocked bradykinin-induced eNOS redistribution. Our results thus suggest that increases in [Ca2+]imay be both necessary and sufficient for eNOS translocation. It has been shown previously (23Isshiki M. Ando J. Korenaga R. Kogo H. Fujimoto T. Kamiya A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5009-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) that receptor-activated increases in intracellular calcium arise from regions of the endothelial cell membrane enriched in caveolin and quickly lead to increases in [Ca2+]i throughout the cell. The nonuniform distribution of eNOS and caveolin along the endothelial cell membrane (Fig. 1) is reminiscent of the patchy membrane distribution described for caveolin (16Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Conard P.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 23Isshiki M. Ando J. Korenaga R. Kogo H. Fujimoto T. Kamiya A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5009-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and shown to correlate with regions of localized Ca2+-dependent signaling. The dynamic equilibrium of eNOS membrane targeting in cultured endothelial cells is thus exquisitely sensitive to changes in intracellular calcium concentration. The heterogeneity of eNOS immunostaining, and its lability in the face of diverse agonists and under different conditions, may also help to explain the discordance of our observations with several earlier reports. For example, Sessaet al. (2Sessa W.C. Garcia-Cardena G. Liu J. Keh A. Pollock J.S. Bradley J. Thiru S. Braverman I.M. Desai K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17641-17644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and Liu et al. (3Liu J. Hughes T.E. Sessa W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) failed to see any membrane-associated eNOS using immunofluorescence methods similar to those used in the current report; Venema et al. (24Venema V.J. Marrero M.B. Venema R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1996; 226: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) visualized a small fraction of eNOS protein in endothelial membranes. The utilization of different antibodies and disparate culture conditions, the possibility of aberrant protein targeting in heterologous expression systems, untoward effects of growing cells in serum-free media; these may represent some of the confounding factors that could explain the negative findings of these earlier reports. These studies also reveal a discrimination in the analysis of eNOS subcellular targeting as revealed by cellular imaging compared with biochemical approaches. When lysed endothelial cells are resolved into soluble and particulate preparations by ultracentrifugation, nearly all the eNOS enzyme is recovered in the particulate fraction. However, the particulate subcellular fraction, as simplistically defined by differential ultracentrifugation, has a heterogeneous composition. In the case of eNOS, the enzyme's targeting to the particulate fraction in resting endothelial cells reflects its association with intracellular membranes as well as cell surface structures. Following bradykinin treatment, essentially all the eNOS immunoreactivity is found around the circumference of the nucleus, possibly apposed to the nuclear membrane, raising interesting speculations about possible nuclear targets for NO following eNOS translocation. The most plausible physiological consequence of eNOS redistribution following agonist activation is the enzyme's sequestration away from its proximal activators and concomitant attenuation of the extracellular release of NO. The time course of eNOS activation is much more rapid than the time course of enzyme translocation in the endothelial cell. Using a selective NO electrode, Malinski and Taha (25Malinski T. Taha Z. Nature. 1992; 358: 676-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar) found that bradykinin activates NO synthesis in endothelial cells within seconds of drug addition, with enzyme activity returning to base line in ∼5 min. In contrast, bradykinin-induced translocation of eNOS is maximum only at 5 min and persists for several tens of minutes until the enzyme returns to the membrane (Fig. 3). These observations suggest that the activation and translocation processes reflect distinct components of the bradykinin response, with translocation plausibly representing a mechanism to down-regulate or uncouple enzyme activation from receptor occupancy. Taken together, our results establish that eNOS targeting to the cell membrane is labile and subject to receptor-regulated Ca2+-dependent reversible translocation, thereby providing another point for regulation of NO-dependent signaling in the vascular endothelium.

The long QT syndrome is a disorder characterized by prolongation of the QT interval as a result of unusually slow repolarization of the cardiac action potential (1Roden D.M. Lazzara R. Rosen M.R.

Heterologous expression of HERG results in a current with the physiologic and pharmacologic properties of IKr (3Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T.

These properties include strong inward rectification that is now recognized to be determined by the ultra-rapid inactivation that the channel undergoes with depolarization (4Snyders D.J. Chaudary A.

Importantly, HERG mRNA is detected at high abundance in human heart (10Curran M.E. Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Green E.D. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 80: 795-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar), and IKr has been recorded in human atrial and ventricular myocytes (11Wang Z. Fermini B. Nattel S. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 1540-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 12Li G.R. Feng J. Yue L. Carrier M. Nattel S. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). LQT2-associated HERG mutations in the pore of the channel display reduced or no IKr (13Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Spector P.S. Keating M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2208-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) and, when expressed with wild-type cRNA, a dominant negative effect has been observed, implying that heteromeric (wild-type + mutant) channel assembly occurs. Heteromeric assembly of physiologically occurring splice variants has also been suggested by the finding that an N-terminal splice variant of the human gene (or of the murine homolog mERG) itself resulted in no current in Xenopus oocytes, but when coexpressed with wild-type cRNA, IKr with rapid activation and deactivation (typical of that observed in heart) was observed (14Lees-Miller J.P. Kondo C. Wang L. Duff H.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar,15London B. Trudeau M.C. Newton K.P. Beyer A.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Satler C.A. Robertson G.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 870-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The initial identification of HERG mutations as a cause of LQT2 included a mutation in the 3′-region of the gene, which is predicted to result in disruption of a splice site and truncation of the C-terminal region of the protein (10Curran M.E. Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Green E.D. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 80: 795-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how this mutation disrupts IKr function because the membrane-spanning segments, as well as the N-terminal region, which has been reported to be necessary for assembly of multiple K+channel subunits into functional channels (16Babila T. Moscucci A. Wang H. Weaver F.E. Koren G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 615-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 17Li X. Xu J. Li M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 705-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), are present. One possible mechanism is disruption of a putative cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB) domain within which the splice site is located. This domain was identified with the initial cloning of HERG (18Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar), but its functional role has not yet been elucidated, and cardiac IKr has been reported to be unaffected by protein kinase A-dependent intracellular signaling (19Sanguinetti M.C. Jurkiewicz N.K. Scott A. Siegl P.K.S. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Because this domain is disrupted in the C-terminal LQT2 mutation, it is conceivable that it plays a role in recapitulation of IKr. However, a recent report of the genomic structure of HERG and analysis of additional LQT2 families raises the possibility that a more C-terminal region is actually required. This report included seven new mutations predicted to result in C-terminal truncations of HERG (20Vesely M.R. Duggal P. London B. Wattanasirichaigoon D. Beggs A.H. Circulation. 1997; 96: I56Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), with a number 3′ to the CNB domain; the one most 3′ was predicted to result in truncation of the 3′ 158 amino acids of the HERG protein. Thus, it remains unknown whether the CNB domain is required for recapitulation of IKr. Recent studies with other potassium channels have raised the possibility that C-terminal regions are required for recapitulation of current, through mechanisms that have yet to be firmly established (21Ludwig J. Owen D. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6337-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Daram P. Urbach S. Gaymard F. Sentenac H. Cherel I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3455-3463Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 23Biervert C. Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Berkovic S.F. Propping P. Jentsch T.J. Steinlein O.K. Science. 1998; 279: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the isolation of a HERGC-terminal splice variant, which we call HERGUSO, and its localization and functional characterization. These studies demonstrated that IKr can be recapitulated even when the putative CNB domain is disrupted and have led to the identification of a 104-amino acid domain, present in the C terminus of HERG but absent in HERGUSO, which appears essential for the recapitulation of IKr in a heterologous expression system. This finding not only points to another potential mechanism for regulation of IKr in vivo but also explains how C-terminal mutations in HERG can cause LQTS. 1 × 106 plaques of a human ventricular cDNA library (a gift of Drs. Michael Tamkun and Sarah England) in λZap II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were screened using standard techniques (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) under high stringency conditions. The probe consisted of a PCR fragment that covers nucleotides 1766–3469 of the originally reported HERG, which here we termHERG 1. In this report, nucleotide numbering starts at the translational start site of HERG. RNA was isolated for quantitation from samples of normal human left ventricle using the acid-phenol method of RNA extraction of Chomczynski and Sacchi (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63189) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether HERGUSO mRNA was expressed in the human heart, we designed two probes, both overlapping the splice site at nt 2398, which we used in RNase protection analyses. A 104-nt probe for cyclophilin was used as an internal standard to normalize for equal RNA concentration across the lanes. RNase protection was performed as described previously (26Yang T. Kupershmidt S. Roden D.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1246-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film as well as to a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) to quantitate relative band intensities. Clone pHERG1 was constructed by excising the HindIII/EcoRI fragment of HERG1 from the pSP64 vector (a gift from Mark Keating, University of Utah) and ligating it via its EcoRI site at the 3′-end into the EcoRI-digested mammalian expression vector pSI (Promega, Madison, WI) followed by treatment with Klenow and a second blunt-end ligation step. Clone pHERGUSO was constructed by first ligating the 3′-terminal XhoI/EcoRI fragment of phage isolate Φ-D (Fig. 1) into the XhoI/EcoRI-digested pSI vector to generate clone pSKF104. The EcoRI site corresponds to the 3′-terminus of the isolate Φ-D, whereas the XhoI site corresponds in location to the XhoI site at nt 2089 of HERG1. The resulting clone SKF104 was then digested at its 5′-end with XhoI and reconstituted at the N terminus using the HindIII/XhoI fragment of HERG1, which consists of the 2089 5′-most nt of the HERG1 coding sequence. The initial Xho ligation was followed by treatment with Klenow and a second blunt-end ligation step to circularize the plasmid generating pHERGUSO. Clone pHERGΔC was constructed by excising theHindIII/XhoI fragment of HERG1 from the pSP64 vector and ligating its 3′-end into XhoI-digested pSI followed by creation of blunt ends at the 5′-end using Klenow and a second, blunt-end ligation step. To control for possible mutations during growth in bacterial cells or other cloning artifacts, plasmid pSKH40 was created by excising the XhoI/EcoRI fragment of pHERGUSO and replacing it with theXhoI/EcoRI fragment of HERG1 in pSP64. This replaces the HERGUSO 3′-terminus with that of HERG1, in effect reconstituting the original pHERG1 clone. Clone pHERGΔC+104 was created by generating a PCR fragment corresponding to nt 3052–3366 of HERG with XhoI linkers at the termini and a stop codon (TAG) incorporated into the reverse primer. The forward primer was 5′-GGACTCGAG C CCACCCCCAG CCTCCTCAAC ATCCC-3′. The reverse primer was 5′-CTACTCGAG C TACGGGGGCA GCTCCTCACA CGCCATG-3′. XhoI recognition sites are italicized and boldface, and the stop codon is double underlined. The PCR fragment was digested with XhoI followed by gel purification and ligation into XhoI-digested pHERGΔC. Resulting clones were sequenced to identify those containing the PCR fragment in the correct orientation. The reading frame of the PCR fragment is conserved. All plasmids described were partially sequenced across vector/insert junctions and across junctions generated by ligation steps and were further characterized by restriction pattern analysis. Ltk −cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% horse serum. The cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Green fluorescent protein was coexpressed to assess the transfection efficiency and to identify expressing cells for voltage-clamp analysis (27Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5508) Google Scholar). The transfection mixture included 1–10 μg of HERG isoforms or chimeras (in pSI), 1 μg of green fluorescent protein/pRcCMV, and 12–30 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent in 0.5 ml of serum-free DMEM for 6 h, after which the standard medium was restored. The cells were removed from the dish 24 h later by a brief trypsinization, washed twice in standard medium, and stored for use within the next 12 h. Parallel nontransfected cultures or cells transfected with green fluorescent protein alone (mock transfection) served as controls. Whole cell voltage clamp (28Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann S. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15148) Google Scholar) was used to record currents in transfected cells displaying green fluorescence, as described previously (4Snyders D.J. Chaudary A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 949-955PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at room temperature (21–23 °C) and sampled at 1–10 kHz after antialias filtering at half or less of the sampling frequency. Specific protocols are specified in the text and figure legends. The cycle time between pulses was ≥20 s to accommodate pulse durations and slow IKr activation (especially below +10 mV). HERGactivation kinetics were slow below −20 mV (see under “Results”), and only passive linear leak (>1 GΩ) was observed during short (100 ms) depolarizations between −90 and −40 mV; therefore, least squares fits to these data were used for passive leak correction. Mono- and multiexponential functions were fit to activating current using least squares methods. The intracellular pipette filling solution contained 110 mmKCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm K4BAPTA, 5 mm K2ATP, and 1 mmMgCl2, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH (final intracellular [K+], ∼145 mm). The bath solution contained 145 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, adjusted to pH 7.35 with NaOH. Dofetilide was provided by Pfizer Central Research. All other compounds were obtained from Sigma. Three clones, designated Φ-D, Φ-L, and Φ-M, were isolated by screening the human heart library. Isolate Φ-L had a partial cDNA insert that corresponded to nucleotides 3064–3886 of HERG1, i.e. the 3′ -terminal 138 amino acids plus the 3′-untranslated region of HERG1 (18Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Φ-M and Φ-D also contained partial cDNAs. The 5′-end of Φ-M was located at HERG1 nt 1267, and that of Φ-D was located at HERG1 nt 813. Both clones were identical to HERG1 up to HERG1 nt 2398, the previously reported splice site (10Curran M.E. Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Green E.D. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 80: 795-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). Following the splice junction in both isolates were 750 nt of a novel sequence that we designated USO. Because clone Φ-M appears to be a subset of clone Φ-D, we restricted our subsequent analysis to Φ-D. The reading frame of HERG1 as it continues into the USO stays open for another 264 nt (88 amino acids). USO appears to be partially made up of sequences previously thought to be intronic because a sequence corresponding to a previously reported intronic primer (10Curran M.E. Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Green E.D. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 80: 795-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar), located between exons 9 and 10 in the mouse gene (15London B. Trudeau M.C. Newton K.P. Beyer A.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Satler C.A. Robertson G.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 870-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), is located 30 nt 3′ to the splice junction at position 2398. Probe E75–1 is predicted to protect a fragment of 228 nt if the HERG1-type splice junction is represented within the mRNA and a fragment of 154 nt if a splice event other than HERG1 (e.g.HERGUSO) occurs (Fig. 2). Conversely, probe E114 is predicted to protect a 191-nt fragment if HERGUSO mRNA is present and a smaller (154 nt) fragment if another splice variant is present. Fig. 2 shows that HERGUSO is present at ∼2-fold higher levels in human heart than HERG1 (range, 1.7–2.1-fold, n = 4). Similar findings were obtained using human left ventricle, atrium, midmyocardium, uterus, cultured human lymphocytes, and, on longer exposure, brain. Further evidence that HERGUSO mRNA is expressed in other tissues is provided by the results of a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (29Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70731) Google Scholar) search of GenBankTMusing the USO sequence. This identified two expressed sequence tags from human fetal liver/spleen (R07336 and R07383) matching HERGUSO. R07383 is 395 nt and matches the HERGUSO open reading frame starting 42 nt 3′ to the 2398 splice junction and extending beyond the HERGUSO stop codon, whereas R07336 is 311 nt and matches HERGUSO in its 3′-untranslated region. When pHERG1 was transfected (Fig. 3, left panels), typical IKr was observed. A brief hyperpolarizing pulse to remove inactivation (4Snyders D.J. Chaudary A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 949-955PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wang S.M. Morales M.J. Liu S.G. Strauss H.C. Rasmusson R.L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 6Smith P.L.

Res. 1997; 80: 782-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) resulted in a characteristic augmentation of current, which then rapidly reinactivated, at positive potentials (Fig. 3 C, left). By contrast, no current was observed, even after a hyperpolarizing pulse, following transfection with pHERGUSO alone. When pHERG1 and pHERGUSO were cotransfected in equimolar concentrations, IKr with amplitude and gating properties very similar to those observed with transfection of pHERG1 alone was observed. As shown in Fig. 3 (right panels), when a 10-fold excess of pHERGUSO was transfected with pHERG1, the current remained IKr-like. However, it is apparent from Fig. 3 (right) that the current in the latter cotransfection experiments was smaller than that observed with pHERG1alone and displayed faster and more negative voltage dependence of activation. These findings are summarized in Fig. 4. The midpoint of activation was shifted 8.8 mV negative (Fig. 4 A). After depolarizing clamp steps from −50 to −40 to +60 mV (Fig. 3, A and B), activating currents were 3–4-fold larger with pHERG1 alone (Fig. 4 B). When inactivation was removed by a brief hyperpolarization (Fig. 3 C), current with pHERG1 alone was 513 ± 137 pA/pF (n = 6) versus 203 ± 40 pA/pF (n = 7, p = 0.03) with cotransfection. Fits to activating current required biexponential functions in the −10 to +30 mV range, and a monoexponential function was sufficient in the +40 to +60 mV range. In either case, it is apparent from Fig. 4 C that activation was consistently ∼3–5-fold faster with cotransfection over all voltages tested. By contrast, the time constants for deactivation were similar in the two sets of experiments. The fact that no current was observed when pHERGUSO was expressed alone was somewhat unexpected, because the protein domains of the N terminus and the transmembrane-spanning region, including the voltage sensor and pore region, are all intact. To guard against the possibility of sequence rearrangements during the passage of plasmid constructs in bacterial hosts resulting in changes that would account for the lack of current observed with expression of pHERGUSO and pHERGΔC, we conducted experiments to rescue HERG1 from pHERGUSO. A full-length HERG1 plasmid, pSKH40, was generated from pHERGUSO by replacing the HERGUSO C terminus with the C terminus from HERG1. Expression of pSKH40 resulted in IKr. We next considered the possibility that the protein domain encoded by the USO might exert an inhibitory effect on channel expression or function. To test this idea, we generated a C-terminal truncation mutant of HERG1 that lacks the C-terminal 461 amino acids, including both the CNB domain and the USO. This construct, pHERGΔC (Fig. 1), terminates 32 amino acids past the S6 domain at a unique XhoI site (nt 2089) of HERG1. However, with transfection of pHERGΔC, no currents were recorded. We therefore concluded that a protein domain encoded by the region 3′ of the splice junction at nt 2398 (i.e. within residues 800–1159) of HERG1 is required for the functional expression of IKr. The CNB domain homolog present in HERG1 is truncated in HERGUSO and completely missing in HERGΔC. Our next step was therefore to determine whether pHERGΔC+104, a construct totally lacking this domain but preserving the N terminus (Fig. 1), could rescue expression of IKr. AfterLtk − cells were transfected with pHERGΔC+104, a current with most features of IKr was recorded (Fig. 5). Although the kinetics of activation and deactivation as well as the V1/2 appeared to be somewhat different from those of HERG1 and the tails were somewhat smaller, the expressed current still activated and deactivated rapidly (Fig. 5 A) and displayed prominent inward rectification (Fig. 5 B) and a large very rapidly inactivating current at positive potentials after a hyperpolarizing step (Fig. 5 C). The current was suppressed by 1 μm dofetilide. We have identified here a 3′-splice variant of HERG that is more abundantly expressed in human heart and other tissues than the originally reported mRNA. However, expression of the variant in mammalian cells did not give rise to potassium current, although coexpression with HERG1 showed a striking effect on the amplitude and activation of IKr, suggesting that HERGUSO can coassemble with HERG1 to modify its gating. The mechanism underlying the failure of HERGUSOalone to generate current is indicated by the experiments with HERGΔC and HERGΔC+104, which demonstrate that a domain near the 3′-end of the mRNA, absent in HERGUSO, is required for recapitulation of IKr. When HERG1 and HERGUSO were coexpressed in equimolar concentrations, there was no obvious effect on HERG1-mediated current (IKr). The finding that mRNA transcripts encoding HERGUSO were much more abundant than those for HERG1 suggested testing the effect of excess HERGUSO as a next step in these experiments. This approach resulted in currents that demonstrated gating properties quite different from those seen with expression of HERG1 alone. This finding strongly suggests that the two isoforms coassemble to form heterotetrameric channels, although direct biochemical evidence of such coassembly in heterologous systems, and ultimately in native tissues, will be required to further test this postulate. We reconstituted our partial HERGUSO cDNA with the N terminus from HERG1 because Spector et al. (7Spector P.S. Curran M.E. Zou A. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) have previously shown that a deletion of amino acids 2–354 of HERG1 did not affect activation or fast inactivation of the resulting IKr, although the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation were shifted by +20 to +30 mV, and the rate of deactivation was much faster with the truncation mutant than with the wild-type channel (7Spector P.S. Curran M.E. Zou A. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Similar results with a N-terminal deletion mutant, from amino acids 2–373, have also been reported by Schonherr and Heinemann (30Schonherr R. Heinemann S.H. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We consider that experiments using heterologous expression approaches that demonstrate only small changes in ion channel function cannot be interpreted with any confidence. Therefore, we used a 1:10 HERG1:HERGUSO ratio when experiments with the 1:1 ratio did not produce an obvious change current amplitude or gating. If we assume that the two RNAs are translated with equal efficiency and have equal opportunity to assemble with other subunits, the incidence of homotetrameric HERG1 complexes formed by the 1:10 ratio of RNAs will be vanishingly small (114,641, or <0.01%). Thus, the result in Fig. 3 B indicates that heterotetrameric HERG1/HERGUSO channels can recapitulate IKr (or that the assumptions of equivalent translation and synthesis are incorrect). Given the assumptions inherent in interpreting this sort of experiment, we believe that the most appropriate interpretation is that expression HERGUSOmodifies HERG1 amplitude and gating in the human heart but that the extent of this interaction in situ remains uncertain. HERGΔC+104 resulted in typical IKr in the absence of the CNB domain, thereby establishing that the CNB domain is not required for IKr expression. Furthermore, C-terminal variants lacking the 104-amino acid domain at positions 1018–1122 (HERGΔC and HERGUSO) expressed no IKr, whereas the HERGΔC+104 rescue construct, which included this domain at the 3′-end, did. The requirement for this domain provides an explanation for the presumed defect in repolarizing current in LQT2 mutations reported in the 3′-end of the gene, at the nt 2398 splice site and beyond (10Curran M.E. Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Green E.D. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 80: 795-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar, 20Vesely M.R. Duggal P. London B. Wattanasirichaigoon D. Beggs A.H. Circulation. 1997; 96: I56Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The function of the 104-amino acid domain that we have implicated as essential for recapitulation of IKr is not yet understood. One possibility is that it is required to allow for the assembly for HERG protein tetramers. One previous report (17Li X. Xu J. Li M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 705-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) has implicated a protein domain from the N terminus of HERG in the assembly of HERG homotetramers. However, N-terminal truncations of HERG do result in current (7Spector P.S. Curran M.E. Zou A. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), indicating that the N-terminal domain is not required, at least not on all four subunits of the presumed tetrameric channel. Recent studies with rat eag (21Ludwig J. Owen D. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6337-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), with the plant potassium channel AKT1 (22Daram P. Urbach S. Gaymard F. Sentenac H. Cherel I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3455-3463Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and with KCNQ2 (23Biervert C. Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Berkovic S.F. Propping P. Jentsch T.J. Steinlein O.K. Science. 1998; 279: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) have implicated regions of the respective C termini in subunit-subunit interactions that are crucial to generation of potassium current. The same may thus hold true for the C-terminal 104-amino acid domain that we have identified in HERG1, although the specific function (e.g.assembly or trafficking) is uncertain. We cannot rule out the possibility that this domain interacts with other proteins; indeed, we and others have suggested that the minK protein interacts with HERG to increase IKr (26Yang T. Kupershmidt S. Roden D.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1246-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31McDonald T.V., Yu, Z. Ming Z. Palma E. Meyers M.B. Wang K.W. Goldstein S.A. Fishman G.I. Nature. 1997; 388: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Finally, the effect of HERGUSO may be exerted not at the protein level but at the RNA level; production of the alternatively spliced HERGUSOisoform could regulate the amount of and/or the processing and translation of HERG1 mRNA. This could be accomplished by competition for necessary transcription factors that are present in limiting amounts or competition for components of the splicing machinery. Such competition could then serve to limit the amount of functional HERG1 protein produced and might assume importance in acquired diseases associated with perturbations of cardiac repolarization. In this regard, it is of interest that splice variants of mRNA encoding glutamate transporters, including an intron-retention event, have recently been reported in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (32Lin C.L.G. Bristol L.A. Jin L. Dykes-Hoberg M. Crawford T. Clawson L. Rothstein J.D. Neuron. 1998; 20: 589-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Along these lines, in preliminary studies, we have found that transcripts encoding HERG1 mRNA are unchanged in hearts from patients with advanced cardiac failure but that those encoding HERGUSO are decreased by ∼50% (33Choy A.M.J. Kupershmidt S. Lang C.C. Pierson Jr., R.N. Roden D.M. Circulation. 1996; 94: I164Google Scholar). The expert advice provided by Al George during development of this project is greatly appreciated. We also appreciate the superb technical assistance of Jason Eck and Nancy Sugg."

https://openalex.org/W1984907107,"Previous studies have suggested that the P2Z/P2X7 purinergic receptor can participate in nucleotide-induced modulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated inflammatory mediator production. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated whether antagonism of the P2Z/P2X7 receptor can influence LPS signaling and expression of the inducible form of nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in RAW 264.7 macrophages. In the present study, we demonstrate that pretreatment of RAW 264.7 macrophages with a P2Z/P2X7 receptor antagonist, periodate oxidized adenosine 5′-triphosphate (o-ATP), substantially inhibits LPS-stimulated NO production and iNOS expression without altering cell viability. This effect on LPS-induced iNOS expression is mimicked by a pyridoxal-phosphate-based antagonist (pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid) of the P2Z/P2X7 purinergic receptor, indicating that these results are not unique to o-ATP. Additionally, o-ATP prevents cell death induced by P2Z/P2X7 receptor agonists. To ascertain how P2Z/P2X7 receptor antagonists influence LPS signaling, we evaluated the capacity of o-ATP to regulate LPS-mediated activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor-κB, and the mitogen-activated protein kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and ERK2. These experiments reveal that pretreatment of RAW 264.7 cells with o-ATP attenuates the LPS stimulation of a nuclear factor-κB-like binding activity. Moreover, the activation of ERK1 and ERK2 by LPS, but not by the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, is also blocked in RAW 264.7 cells by o-ATP pretreatment. In summary, these data suggest that the P2Z/P2X7 receptor modulates LPS-induced macrophage activation as assessed by iNOS expression and NO production. This report implicates the P2Z/P2X7 receptor in the control of protein kinase cascades and transcriptional processes, and these observations are likely to be important for the development of selective purinergic receptor antagonists for the treatment of septic shock. Previous studies have suggested that the P2Z/P2X7 purinergic receptor can participate in nucleotide-induced modulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated inflammatory mediator production. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated whether antagonism of the P2Z/P2X7 receptor can influence LPS signaling and expression of the inducible form of nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in RAW 264.7 macrophages. In the present study, we demonstrate that pretreatment of RAW 264.7 macrophages with a P2Z/P2X7 receptor antagonist, periodate oxidized adenosine 5′-triphosphate (o-ATP), substantially inhibits LPS-stimulated NO production and iNOS expression without altering cell viability. This effect on LPS-induced iNOS expression is mimicked by a pyridoxal-phosphate-based antagonist (pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid) of the P2Z/P2X7 purinergic receptor, indicating that these results are not unique to o-ATP. Additionally, o-ATP prevents cell death induced by P2Z/P2X7 receptor agonists. To ascertain how P2Z/P2X7 receptor antagonists influence LPS signaling, we evaluated the capacity of o-ATP to regulate LPS-mediated activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor-κB, and the mitogen-activated protein kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and ERK2. These experiments reveal that pretreatment of RAW 264.7 cells with o-ATP attenuates the LPS stimulation of a nuclear factor-κB-like binding activity. Moreover, the activation of ERK1 and ERK2 by LPS, but not by the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, is also blocked in RAW 264.7 cells by o-ATP pretreatment. In summary, these data suggest that the P2Z/P2X7 receptor modulates LPS-induced macrophage activation as assessed by iNOS expression and NO production. This report implicates the P2Z/P2X7 receptor in the control of protein kinase cascades and transcriptional processes, and these observations are likely to be important for the development of selective purinergic receptor antagonists for the treatment of septic shock. lipopolysaccharide inducible nitric-oxide synthase nitric oxide 2-methylthio-ATP periodate oxidized ATP 2′- and 3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellullar signal-regulated kinase nuclear factor-κB. Macrophage activation by Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide; LPS)1(1Proctor R.A. Denlinger L.C. Bertics P.J. Minion C. Roth J.A. Virulence Mechanisms of Bacterial Pathogens. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 173-194Google Scholar) is central to the mammalian inflammatory response to this agent and also has been implicated in endotoxin tolerance (1Proctor R.A. Denlinger L.C. Bertics P.J. Minion C. Roth J.A. Virulence Mechanisms of Bacterial Pathogens. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 173-194Google Scholar, 2Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Frankenberger M. Wedel A. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Whether an LPS-stimulated macrophage produces a relative surplus of inflammatory or anti-inflammatory mediators is likely to be dependent on its differentiation state (2Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Frankenberger M. Wedel A. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, little is known about these transitions, and this is reflected by the clinical inability to distinguish between the inflammatory and the immunosuppressive states of septic shock (3Bone R.C. Grodzin C.J. Balk R.A. Chest. 1997; 112: 235-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Thus, information regarding the signaling pathways involved in macrophage activation and differentiation could lead to a better understanding of sepsis as well as to the development of therapeutic agents. Recently, the expression of P2 purinergic receptors, which bind extracellular adenine nucleotides possessing two or more phosphates, has been shown to serve as a marker of macrophage differentiation in response to LPS and various cytokines (4Dubyak G.R. Clifford E.E. Humphreys B.D. Kertesy S.B. Martin K.A. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 39: 269-278Crossref Google Scholar). The P2X subfamily contains at least seven distinct genes that encode proteins with two transmembrane domains that appear to function as multimeric receptors exhibiting ion channel activity (5Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 445-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar, 6Valera S. Hussey N. Evans R.J. Adami N. North R.A. Surprenant A. Buell G.

Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). In addition, the P2Y subfamily has been reported to contain five to seven distinct genes encoding receptors with seven transmembrane domains that are coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins (5Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 445-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar, 9Fisette P.L. Denlinger L.C. Proctor R.A. Bertics P.J. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 39: 377-387Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Unstimulated monocytes express relatively high levels of P2Y2 receptor mRNA but low levels of the P2X7 purinergic receptor message (10Martin K.A. Kertesy S.B. Dubyak G.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Humphreys B.D. Dubyak G.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5627-5637PubMed Google Scholar). In response to LPS, monocytic P2Y2 receptor expression is down-regulated with a concomitant induction of P2X7receptor mRNA levels (10Martin K.A. Kertesy S.B. Dubyak G.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Humphreys B.D. Dubyak G.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5627-5637PubMed Google Scholar). The P2X7 receptor in mature macrophages may be the P2Z receptor of former classification schemes (8Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar), and it is intriguing for several reasons. The P2X7 receptor either directly or indirectly generates a pore activity that has been formerly designated as a P2Z receptor function (8Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar, 12Rassendren F. Buell G.N. Virginio C. Collo G. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Biol.

Med. 1997; 185: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The P2Z-associated pore is reversibly permeable to ions and metabolites of less than 900 Da in size, which is an activity linked to sustained calcium influx that can lead to cell death with continuous or repeated application of agonist (14Di Virgilio F. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 524-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The P2Z receptor is also thought to control a signal transduction pathway that regulates macrophage post-translational processing of LPS-induced interleukin-1β; however, the mechanism of this signaling pathway is unclear (15Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Dal Susino M. Melchiorri L. Baricordi O.R. Di Virgilio F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1451-1458PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, the P2Z receptor is known to regulate a divalent cation-dependent phospholipase D activity that is not required for pore maintenance (16Gargett C.E. Cornish E.J. Wiley J.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17el-Moatassim C. Dubyak G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15571-15578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, exogenous adenine nucleotides that can interact with various purinergic receptors can synergize with LPS to increase steady state levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and the inducible form of nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA (18Tonetti M. Sturla L. Giovine M. Benatti U. De Flora A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the concept that the P2Z/P2X7 receptor controls a signaling pathway(s) that can influence LPS action distinct from those involved in cell death. In fact, the macrophage signaling events leading to LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production may be one such pathway (19Denlinger L.C. Fisette P.L. Garis K.A. Kwon G. Vazquez-Torres A. Simon A.D. Nguyen B. Proctor R.A. Bertics P.J. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 337-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In terms of the role by which adenine nucleotide may influence LPS-stimulated inflammatory mediator production, LPS-treatment of macrophages is known to release endogenous ATP for subsequent autocrine stimulation (13Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Hanau S. Di Virgilio F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Moreover, exogenous ATP and other adenine nucleotides synergize with LPS to induce tumor necrosis factor-α and NO production by the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 (18Tonetti M. Sturla L. Giovine M. Benatti U. De Flora A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas treatment of isolated mouse peritoneal macrophages with the purinergic receptor ligand 2-methylthio-ATP (2-MeS-ATP) profoundly inhibits LPS-stimulated NO generation (19Denlinger L.C. Fisette P.L. Garis K.A. Kwon G. Vazquez-Torres A. Simon A.D. Nguyen B. Proctor R.A. Bertics P.J. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 337-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, the coadministration of 2-MeS-ATP with LPS protects mice from endotoxic death (20Proctor R.A. Denlinger L.C. Leventhal P.S. Daugherty S.K. van de Loo J.W. Tanke T. Firestein G.S. Bertics P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6017-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, because 2-MeS-ATP interacts with multiple P2Y and P2X receptors, including P2Z/P2X7 (5Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 445-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar, 8Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism(s) by which ATP and 2-MeS-ATP bring about their divergent responses is unclear but may be due to the differential expression of selected purinergic receptors at various stages of monocyte/macrophage differentiation. Based on these observations along with the finding that there is preferential expression of P2Z/P2X7 receptors by macrophages after LPS-stimulation (11Humphreys B.D. Dubyak G.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5627-5637PubMed Google Scholar), the goal of the present study was to evaluate the role of this receptor activity in LPS signaling events and NO production. RPMI 1640 culture medium,l-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate were all products of Bio Whittaker (Walkersville, MD), whereas cosmic calf serum was obtained from Hyclone (Logan, UT). All antibiotics, ATP, periodate oxidized ATP (o-ATP), 2′- and 3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl) (Bz)-ATP, ATPγS, lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B4, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA),N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine-HCl, sulfanilamide, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), SDS, and N, N-dimethylformamide were all obtained Sigma. The source of 2-methylthio (2-MeS)-ATP was Research Biochemicals (Natick, MA), whereas pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid (PPADS) was acquired from Tocris Cookson (Langford, Bristol, UK). Mouse recombinant interferon-γ was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The rabbit polyclonal anti-murine iNOS antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), the rabbit polyclonal anti-ACTIVE™ MAP kinase (ERK-1/ERK-2) antibody was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI), and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). LumiGLO™ substrates were acquired from Kirkegaaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Murine RAW 264.7 macrophages obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% cosmic calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B as described previously (19Denlinger L.C.

For all experiments, cells were grown to 80–90% confluency, and were subjected to no more than 20 cell passages. Cell passaging was performed by scraping followed by transferring of 0.1 of the suspended cells to a new dish containing fresh medium. RAW 264.7 macrophages were plated at 5 × 104 cells/well in 96-well culture dishes and were incubated for 18–24 h before treatment. After pretreatment for 2 h with 100 μl of control medium or o-ATP (at the indicated concentrations), the medium was removed, and these cells were washed twice with fresh medium prior to the addition of 100 μl of either medium alone or Escherichia coli LPS (10–1000 ng/ml). After the cells were treated for 20 h at 37 °C, 100 μl of the Griess reagent (a 1:1 mix of 0.1%N-1-naphthylethylenediamine-HCl and 1.0% sulfanilamide in 60% acetic acid) were added to each well, and incubated for 10 min in the dark, as described previously (19Denlinger L.C. Fisette P.L. Garis K.A. Kwon G. Vazquez-Torres A. Simon A.D. Nguyen B. Proctor R.A. Bertics P.J. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 337-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Nitrite concentrations were determined by the measurement of the optical density at 550 nm. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion and MTT cytotoxicity assays (22Denizot F. Lang R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (4274) Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated in a manner similar to that described for the NO assay, with or without 2-h o-ATP pretreatments, followed by 20 h of treatments with either medium alone, LPS, or adenine nucleotides. The cells were washed twice with fresh medium at the end of the treatments, before the addition of either trypan blue or MTT. In the MTT assays, the cells were incubated with 110 μl of 1 mg/ml MTT for 2 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, followed by an overnight incubation with 100 μl of a solution containing 20% (w/v) SDS and 50% N, N-dimethylformamide. The level of cell viability was determined by measuring the absorbance at 595 nm using 50 μl of cell lysate. For the determination of iNOS protein expression, RAW 264.7 macrophages were plated at 5 × 105 cells/well in six-well culture dishes for 18–24 h prior to treatment. The cells were pretreated for 2 h with either 1 ml of medium alone or o-ATP (250 or 500 μm) and then washed twice with fresh medium. Next, the cells were treated with either 1 ml of medium or LPS (10–1000 ng/ml) for 20 h. In the experiments assessing the influence of PPADS on iNOS expression, RAW 264.7 cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/well in 96-well culture dishes for 18 h prior to treating the cells with either medium alone, LPS (10–1000 ng/ml), PPADS (10–1000 μm), or combinations of both for 20 h. After treatment, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer, and boiled for 10 min. The proteins were then separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 7.5% gel, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked overnight with 5% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.25% Tween 20 (TBST) at 4 °C. The levels of iNOS protein were detected using a 1:4000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal anti-murine iNOS antibody, followed by incubation with a 1:5000 dilution of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. The membrane was rinsed with TBST between all hybridizations, and the secondary antibody was visualized using LumiGLO™ substrates and luminography. To determine the level of ERK1/ERK2 (MAP kinase) activation, 5 × 105 RAW 264.7 macrophages were plated in six-well culture dishes for 18–24 h. The cells were pretreated for 2 h with either 1 ml of medium alone or o-ATP (250 or 500 μm) and then washed twice with fresh medium. Next, the cells were treated with either 1 ml of medium, LPS (10–1000 ng/ml), UTP (10–100 μm), or PMA (1 μm) for 15 min. The cells were then lysed, and the proteins were separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 12.5% gel. The levels of MAP kinase activation were determined by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for the active forms (threonine/tyrosine phosphorylated) of ERK1 and ERK2. For the ERK1/ERK2 immunoblots, a 1:10,000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal Anti-ACTIVE™ ERK1/ERK2 MAP kinase antibody or a 1:4000 dilution of a polyclonal anti-pan-ERK antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was employed, followed by detection using a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody and luminography as described above. Measurement of NF-κB binding activity was performed as described previously (21Denlinger L.C. Garis K.A. Sommer J.A. Guadarrama A.G. Proctor R.A. Bertics P.J. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1638-1647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies, RAW 264.7 macrophages were plated at 2.5 × 106 cells/10-cm culture dish the night before the experiment. The cells were pretreated 2 h with either medium alone or with o-ATP (250 or 500 μm), washed twice with medium, then treated with medium or LPS (10–1000 ng/ml) for 1 h. The cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% serum, washed twice with phophate-buffered saline, 2% serum, and resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.3 mm EGTA, 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). After the cells were incubated on ice for 15 min and then lysed by the addition of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, the nuclei were harvested by centrifugation at 7,200 × g for 10 s at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 320 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), incubated on ice for 15 min, and cleared by centrifugation at 13,500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was estimated by the micro-BCA assay (Pierce). The NF-κB binding protein detection system (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, end labeling of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing two NF-κB-binding elements (5′-GATCCAAGGGGACTTTCCATGGATCCAAGGGGACTTTCCATG) was performed using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extracts (5 μg of protein) were incubated with 1 × 105 cpm of the labeled oligonucleotide at room temperature for 20 min. The samples were separated on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. To determine whether the P2Z/P2X7 purinergic receptor participates in pathways important to LPS signaling, we examined whether antagonists selective for P2X receptors can influence LPS-stimulated macrophage inflammatory mediator production. In this regard, NO is known to be produced in response to LPS, and its generation by LPS-treated macrophages has been shown to be modulated by 2-MeS-ATP (19Denlinger L.C. Fisette P.L. Garis K.A. Kwon G. Vazquez-Torres A. Simon A.D. Nguyen B. Proctor R.A. Bertics P.J. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 337-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), which is an agent that can bind to multiple P2X and P2Y purinergic receptors (5Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 445-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). To more specifically ascertain the role of P2Z/P2X7 receptors in this process, we pretreated RAW 264.7 macrophages for 2 h with either 0, 250, or 500 μm o-ATP, which is an irreversible P2Z/P2X7 inhibitor (23Murgia M. Hanau S. Pizzo P. Rippa M. Di Virgilio F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8199-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were then washed, treated with 0, 10, 100 or 1000 ng/ml E. coli LPS for 20 h, and samples of the culture medium were measured for nitrite, a stable metabolite of NO. As shown in Fig. 1, pretreatment of RAW 264.7 cells with increasing concentrations of o-ATP promoted a dose-dependent inhibition in the amount of nitrite produced by these cells in response to LPS. To evaluate whether this effect is due to an inhibition of iNOS expression or activity, we monitored LPS-induced iNOS levels using immunoblotting. The data in Fig. 2 reveal that o-ATP pretreatment reduces the capacity of LPS to stimulate iNOS expression.Figure 2LPS-induced iNOS expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages pretreated with o-ATP. RAW 264.7 macrophages (5 × 105 cells/treatment) were incubated with either control medium, 250 μm o-ATP, or 500 μm o-ATP for 2 h, washed twice with fresh medium, and then treated with either medium, or 10, 100, or 1000 ng/ml LPS for 20 h at 37 °C. The level of iNOS protein was determined by immunoblotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Given the observation that o-ATP can substantially inhibit iNOS expression and NO production, it was important to determine whether this effect reflected a specific regulation of the inflammatory capacity of the cell or was a result of a nonselective cytotoxic effect. In this respect, several lines of evidence suggest that the effects of o-ATP are not due to altered cell viablity. For example, the production of LPS-induced NO after o-ATP pretreatment of RAW 264.7 cells can be partially restored by the presence of interferon-γ during the LPS-stimulation period (data not shown). Second, treatment of cells with o-ATP in the presence or absence of LPS was not toxic to these cells as determined by parallel experiments using the trypan blue exclusion assay (i.e. these cells were greater than 99% viable following all treatments). In addition to these observations and as an additional test of cell viability, we measured the metabolic activity of RAW 264.7 cells following o-ATP pretreatment using an MTT dye-reduction assay (24Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3329) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, o-ATP in the presence or absence of LPS had no measurable effect on RAW 264.7 cell metabolic activity/viability. Although a known P2Z/P2X7 receptor antagonist (o-ATP) does not alter cell viability (Fig. 3 A), it has been reported that agonists of the P2Z/P2X7 receptor can mediate cell death in macrophages and other cell types via the stimulation of a pore-forming activity associated with this receptor (14Di Virgilio F. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 524-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that RAW 264.7 cells express a P2Z/P2X7-associated pore, these cells were stimulated with the selective P2Z/P2X7 agonist, Bz-ATP, as well as with ATP, ATPγS, and 2-MeS-ATP, which are capable of interacting with multiple P2 purinergic receptors. Cell viability was then measured by MTT dye reduction, and as shown in Fig. 3 B, Bz-ATP, ATPγS, and 2-MeS-ATP all caused a decrease in cell viability after 20 h of agonist treatment. In contrast, ATP, a ligand normally present during inflammatory reactions, was less able to kill RAW 264.7 cells at concentrations as high as 1 mm (Fig. 3 B). The lower activity of ATP in this system compared with the other ATP analogs is likely due to its more rapid hydrolysis by the high levels of ecto-ATPases that are present on macrophages (25Resta R. Hooker S.W. Hansen K.R. Laurent A.B. Park J.L. Blackburn M.R. Knudsen T.B. Thompson L.F. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To assess whether Bz-ATP, 2-MeS-ATP, and ATPγS were promoting the loss of cell viability via the P2Z/P2X7 receptor, we pretreated RAW 264.7 cells with 0, 250, and 500 μm o-ATP for 2 h, followed by washing and restimulation with various adenine nucleotides for an additional 20 h. When cell viability was measured by the MTT assay (Fig. 3 B), pretreatment with o-ATP was found to prevent cytotoxicity caused by subsequent treatments with Bz-ATP, 2-MeS-ATP, or ATPγS (Fig. 3 B). In addition to these pharmacological data, we have confirmed that unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells, a cell line derived from peritoneal macrophages (26Raschke W.C. Baird S. Ralph P. Nakoinz I.

Taken together, these data demonstrate that unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells express functional P2Z/P2X7 receptors and that their inhibition by o-ATP can block agonist induced cytotoxicity and LPS-stimulated NO production. Although o-ATP has been reported to be a selective antagonist of the P2Z/P2X7 receptor, it is conceivable that o-ATP may block LPS action via a non-P2X7receptor mechanism(s). Therefore, to assess whether P2X receptors are critical to LPS action and to confirm the specificity of o-ATP, we explored in this system the biological effects of PPADS, which is a P2X receptor antagonist (27Brown C. Tanna B. Boarder M.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 2413-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28Lambrecht G. J. Auton. Pharmacol. 1996; 16: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that is structurally unrelated to o-ATP. As shown in Fig. 4 A, co-administration of increasing concentrations of PPADS elicited a dose-dependent inhibition of LPS-induced iNOS expression in RAW 264.7 cells. In terms of cell viability, concentrations of PPADS up to 1000 μm were not toxic to these cells and could block the cytotoxicity induced by 500 μm of Bz-ATP (Fig. 4 B). In sum, these data provide additional evidence that two distinct P2Z/P2X7 purinergic receptor antagonists can block agonist-induced cell death and LPS-stimulated iNOS expression. LPS-treatment of macrophages activates multiple signaling events, although it is unclear which of these pathways are essential to endotoxicity (29Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Because the blockade of the P2Z/P2X7 purinergic receptor can modulate LPS-induced iNOS expression, we examined the effects of o-ATP on the regulation of NF-κB, which is a transcription factor required for iNOS expression and the regulation of other inflammatory mediators (30Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated for 2 h with o-ATP followed by stimulation with increasing concentrations of LPS for 1 h. The levels of activated NF-κB in the cell nuclei were determined using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the conserved NF-κB binding sequence. Consistent with previous observations using RAW 264.7 cells (31Delude R.L. Fenton M.J. Savedra Jr., R. Perera P.Y. Vogel S.N. Thieringer R. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22253-22260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the data in Fig. 5 reveal that increasing concentrations of LPS induced a biphasic stimulation of NF-κB binding activities. Interestingly, at all the LPS concentrations tested, the level of at least two NF-κB binding activities in the nuclear extract were dose-dependently reduced following a 2-h pretreatment with increasing concentrations of o-ATP (Fig. 5). Based on these results, o-ATP pretreatments appear to inhibit LPS-induced activation of NF-κB, implicating P2Z/P2X7 purinergic regulation of LPS-induced NF-κB activation in RAW 264.7 cells. Although NF-κB is important for LPS action, other signaling pathways activated by LPS also appear to be necessary for NO production and endotoxicity (21Denlinger L.C. Garis K.A. Sommer J.A. Guadarrama A.G. Proctor R.A. Bertics P.J. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1638-1647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to explore the capacity of the P2Z/P2X7purinergic receptor to regulate other LPS-stimulated signaling events. In this regard, one early event associated with LPS signalling involves the stimulation of ERK1 and ERK2 (32Weinstein S.L. Sanghera J.S. Lemke K. DeFranco A.L. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14955-14962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are members of the MAP kinase family (33Sanghera J.S. Weinstein S.L. Aluwalia M. Girn J. Pelech S.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4457-4465PubMed Google Scholar) that have been implicated in LPS-induced iNOS expression and macrophage activation (34Davis R.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). To examine whether LPS regulation of ERK1/ERK2 is affected by the P2Z/P2X7purinergic receptor signaling pathway, we pretreated RAW 264.7 cells with increasing concentrations of o-ATP for 2 h, followed by a 15-min treatment with various concentrations of LPS. The levels of ERK1/ERK2 activation were assessed using antibodies specific for the dually threonine/tyrosine phosphorylated (active) form of these protein kinases (35Khokhlatchev A. Xu S. English J. Wu P. Schaefer E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11057-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 6 A, increasing concentrations of LPS alone dose-dependently activated ERK1/ERK2. Moreover, at all LPS concentrations tested, 2 h of pretreatment with increasing concentrations of o-ATP dose-dependently inhibited the LPS-induced ERK1/ERK2 activation. To ascertain whether alternative pathways of ERK1/ERK2 activation were still intact after o-ATP pretreatment, we examined the capacity of the phorbol ester PMA to activate ERK1/ERK2 in cells pretreated with o-ATP. We observed that PMA alone could activate ERK1/ERK2 to levels comparable with those seen in response to cells treated with a maximal dose of LPS. Furthermore, consistent with the apparent selectivity of o-ATP on LPS and P2Z/P2X7 agonist-induced effects, the PMA stimulation of ERK1/ERK2 was resistant to the inhibitory actions of o-ATP pretreatment (Fig. 6 A). These data also confirm our previous observation that o-ATP pretreatment is not toxic to RAW 264.7 cells. Similar results were obtained with human monocytic THP-1 cells,i.e. ERK1/ERK2 activation by LPS is inhibited by o-ATP pretreatment, whereas PMA stimulation of ERK1/ERK2 was unaffected by o-ATP pretreatment (data not shown). Although the above studies have shown that the P2Z/P2X7receptor antagonist o-ATP can block LPS-induced activation of ERK1/ERK2, it was important to ascertain if o-ATP can antagonize signals induced by other purinergic receptors that are expressed by macrophages, i.e. it was necessary to further establish the selectivity of o-ATP in this system. Because the other major purinergic receptor class that is well characterized to be expressed in macrophages is the P2Y2 receptor (9Fisette P.L. Denlinger L.C. Proctor R.A. Bertics P.J. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 39: 377-387Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 10Martin K.A. Kertesy S.B. Dubyak G.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Humphreys B.D. Dubyak G.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5627-5637PubMed Google Scholar), which utilizes UTP as an agonist, we explored the capacity of the P2Z antagonist o-ATP to antagonize UTP-stimulated ERK1/ERK2 activation. We observed that treatment of macrophages with 250 μm o-ATP, which clearly blocks LPS-stimulated MAP kinase activation (Fig. 6, A and B), had little to no detectable effect on the activation of MAP kinases in response to UTP stimulation (Fig. 6 B). These results support the hypothesis that it is principally the P2Z/P2X7 receptor class that is o-ATP-sensitive and involved in modulating LPS signaling with respect to ERK1/ERK2 activation. Recent investigations have provided evidence that P2 purinergic receptors are likely to be important to the activation of macrophages by LPS (15Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Dal Susino M.

These previous studies have demonstrated that the administration of 2-MeS-ATP, which can interact with multiple P2X and P2Y receptors, can prevent death in mice treated with a lethal dose of LPS and results in the concomitant reduction in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1α (20Proctor R.A. Denlinger L.C. Leventhal P.S. Daugherty S.K. van de Loo J.W. Tanke T. Firestein G.S. Bertics P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6017-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Likewise, 2-MeS-ATP can also inhibit NO production, as well as the production of iNOS protein and the steady-state levels of iNOS mRNA in mouse peritoneal macrophages treated with LPS and interferon-γ (19Denlinger L.C. Fisette P.L. Garis K.A. Kwon G. Vazquez-Torres A. Simon A.D. Nguyen B. Proctor R.A. Bertics P.J. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 337-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, the pretreatment of human monocytes with o-ATP for 2 h, which has been reported to selectively antagonize the P2Z/P2X7 receptor (23Murgia M. Hanau S. Pizzo P. Rippa M. Di Virgilio F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8199-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), can inhibit interleukin-1β release by cells cotreated with LPS and ATP (15Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Dal Susino M. Melchiorri L. Baricordi O.R. Di Virgilio F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1451-1458PubMed Google Scholar). The results from the present study demonstrate that RAW 264.7 macrophages express a functional P2Z/P2X7 receptor and that P2Z/P2X7receptor antagonists (o-ATP and PPADS) can have profound effects on both short term and long term LPS-stimulated processes. For example, o-ATP treatment of RAW 264.7 macrophages induces rapid effects on LPS activation of ERK1/ERK2 and the transcription factor NF-κB, as well as long term effects on LPS-induced iNOS expression and NO production. The regulation of LPS action by the P2Z/P2X7 receptor appears to be selective in that two structurally unrelated P2Z/P2X7 receptor antagonists, o-ATP and PPADS, can block LPS signal transduction events without affecting cell viability. Furthermore, both o-ATP and PPADS can inhibit the ability of known P2Z/P2X7 receptor agonists to induce cytotoxicity, demonstrating that o-ATP and PPADS are antagonizing the activity of this receptor. Relatively little is known about the signal transduction pathways controlled by the P2Z/P2X7 purinergic receptor in macrophages. Earlier studies by el-Moatassim and Dubyak (17el-Moatassim C. Dubyak G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15571-15578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the pore-forming activity of the P2Z/P2X7receptor, which is thought to be responsible for P2Z/P2X7receptor-induced cytotoxicity, can be dissociated from a GTP-dependent phospholipase D activity. Additionally, ATP has been found to activate NF-κB (p65) in mouse microglial N9 cells, which is an activity that could be inhibited with a 2-h pretreatment of the cells with o-ATP, although it is not clear whether o-ATP could inhibit LPS-stimulated NF-κB activation in these cells (36Ferrari D. Wesselborg S. Bauer M.K.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1635-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Data generated by the present study reveal that P2Z/P2X7receptor antagonists can inhibit the LPS-stimulation of ERK1/ERK2, as well as the activation of two NF-κB binding activities by LPS, suggesting that this purinergic receptor regulates both of these signal transduction end points in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Although several intracellular effectors such as protein kinases and transcription factors are known to be regulated by LPS, it has not been clearly established what processes are important for the initiation of LPS signal transduction at the level of the plasma membrane. Because o-ATP can inhibit many actions of LPS, we postulate that the P2Z/P2X7 receptor can play a role in LPS signaling. It has been reported that LPS can trigger the release of ATP from RAW 264.7 cells (13Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Hanau S. Di Virgilio F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), perhaps by the activation of an ATP channel or by exocytosis. The released ATP may activate the P2Z/P2X7receptor in an autocrine or paracrine manner, thereby affecting a cation channel and/or a pore activity. Alternatively, LPS may interact directly or indirectly with the P2X7 receptor itself. This interaction could modulate the P2X7-linked channel activity and thus control the influx of divalent cations (such as Ca2+) that are important in signal transduction. It is also conceivable that o-ATP could be acting to inhibit LPS-induced events through a mechanism independent of the P2Z/P2X7 receptor,e.g. by antagonizing another class of purinergic receptor or LPS-binding protein. In summary, there are multiple lines of evidence supporting the hypothesis that purinergic receptors are critical for LPS signaling. In the present study, we demonstrate that antagonism of the P2Z/P2X7 receptor can block LPS-induced signaling events leading to the inhibition of iNOS expression and NO production. However, a more precise determination of which aspects of LPS-induced macrophage activation are dependent upon purinergic receptor action will ultimately require the development of cell lines and/or in vivo models with defects in selected purinergic receptor expression or signaling. Regardless, the studies to date support the development of purinergic receptor ligands as novel therapeutics for the treatment of Gram-negative sepsis.

Initiation, prevention, and termination of immune responses are governed by receptors that transduce signals from the exterior to the interior of hematopoietic cells. The proximal intracellular biochemical events initiated following stimulation of antigen, Fc-, and NK1 cell triggering receptors include activation of Src and Syk family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids, and mobilization of intracellular calcium (1Chan A.C.

This activation pathway is subject to negative regulation by inhibitory receptors. For example, class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-recognizing KIRs prevent NK cells and certain subpopulations of T cells from killing specific class I MHC-bearing target cells (5Brown M.G.

KIRs belong to a large family of immune cell inhibitory receptors that contain a conserved immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in their cytoplasmic signaling domains (9Burshtyn D.N.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of the ITIM results in the recruitment of SH2 domain-containing phosphatases, such as the PTPs SHP-1 and SHP-2 or the SH2-containing inositol phosphatase SHIP (12Binstadt B.A. Brumbaugh K.M.

These two classes of phosphatases deliver distinct inhibitory signals. SH2-containing inositol phosphatase recruited to the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIB acts relatively late in the activation cascade by interfering with sustained calcium influx (17Gupta N.

In contrast, SHP-1 recruited to KIRs inhibits the earliest FcR-initiated signals, including tyrosine phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-containing ζ-subunits of FcγRIIIA and the downstream effectors zeta-associated protein-70 (ZAP-70) and phospholipase C-γ (12Binstadt B.A. Brumbaugh K.M.

Due to the prominent role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in early signal output from multisubunit immune recognition receptors, the field of candidate SHP-1 substrates is large. SHP-1-utilizing inhibitory receptors negatively regulate similar Src and Syk family PTK-dependent activation pathways in a variety of hematopoietic cell types (9Burshtyn D.N. Long E.O.

After blocking in 0.5% bovine serum albumin, the membrane was probed with the purified GST-SHP-1 (C453S) fusion protein (5 μg/ml) in a far Western blot analysis. The bound fusion protein was detected by probing with the anti-KT3 epitope tag monoclonal antibody. To determine whether SHP-1 displays substrate selectivity, we subjected a pool of NK cell phosphotyrosine-containing proteins to dephosphorylation by SHP-1 in vitro. The catalytic activity of SHP-1 is regulated by an intramolecular association of the amino-terminal SH2 domains with the carboxyl-terminal catalytic portion of the molecule (27Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmüller Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 28Pei D. Wang J Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Binding of the SHP-1 SH2 domains to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins or peptides increases the catalytic activity of the enzyme (13Burshtyn D.N. Scharenberg A.M. Wagtmann N. Rajagopalan S.

Peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic ITIM-containing region of the p70 KIR NKB1 were synthesized (24D'Andrea A. Chang C. Franz-Bacon K. McClanahan T. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2306-2310PubMed Google Scholar). The tyrosine-phosphorylated form (pY1) of this peptide activates SHP-1 in vitro, whereas the nonphosphorylated form (Y1) does not (13Burshtyn D.N.

Yi T. Long E.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13066-13072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The pY1 peptide therefore mimics the activation of SHP-1 that occurs upon binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated KIR. NK cells stimulated with the PTP inhibitor pervanadate (Fig. 1 A) or via FcR cross-linking (Fig. 1 B) were lysed, and the lysates were incubatedin vitro with full-length, GSH agarose-bound SHP-1. Significantly, activation of SHP-1 by addition of the phospho-ITIM-containing peptide resulted in selective, time-dependent dephosphorylation of proteins of around 50, 70, and 116 kDa, whereas little dephosphorylation of these proteins was observed in the presence of the nonphosphorylated peptide. Consistent with a previous report (19Valiante N.M. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. Parham P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2243-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), some proteins, notably a p36 phosphotyrosyl protein, were dephosphorylated by SHP-1 even in the absence of the activating pY1 peptide (Fig. 1 B). Particularly striking, however, is the large number of phosphotyrosyl proteins not efficiently dephosphorylated by SHP-1. These results suggest that, in vivo, inhibitory receptor-associated SHP-1 may not act promiscuously, but rather may target certain phosphotyrosyl proteins for dephosphorylation. This method does not permit identification of the dephosphorylated proteins, but rather serves to focus the search to proteins of certain molecular masses. Catalytically inactive tyrosine phosphatases can be used to identify substrates by direct binding (30Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 31Black D.S. Bliska J.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2730-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 32Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). We constructed a GST fusion protein containing the catalytic domain of enzymatically inactive SHP-1 (C453S). The SH2 domains of SHP-1 were removed because of their ability to limit accessibility of the catalytic site to substrate. To examine the substrate specificity of the SHP-1 catalytic domain, we used this fusion protein as a probe in far Western blots. This method allows analysis of direct protein-protein interactions and has been used successfully by Black and Bliska (31Black D.S. Bliska J.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2730-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) to show that p130Cas is the substrate of the Yersinia PTP YopH. Lysates of unstimulated or pervanadate-stimulated NK cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with the SHP-1 C453S catalytic domain fusion protein. A single protein of around 70 kDa showed pervanadate-inducible reactivity with the fusion protein (Fig. 2). Reprobing of the membrane with an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody revealed the vast number of phosphotyrosyl proteins present, underscoring the high degree of specificity displayed by the SHP-1 catalytic domain for the single protein recognized. Multisubunit immune recognition receptors, such as FcR, are thought to initiate signaling through the sequential activation of Src family PTKs followed by Syk family PTKs. Additionally, Syk plays a key role in the generation of NK cell-mediated natural killing (33Brumbaugh K.M. Binstadt B.A. Billadeau D.D. Schoon R.A. Dick C.J. Ten R.M. Leibson P.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1965-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To determine whether the inhibitory effect of KIR/SHP-1 engagement on this activation process is located upstream or downstream of Syk activation, we used a chimeric receptor system. Cross-linking of a chimeric receptor consisting of the CD16 extracellular region and CD7 transmembrane region containing the PTK Syk (CD16:7:Syk) in the cytoplasmic tail results in Src family PTK-independent activation of T cells (26Kolanus W. Romeo C. Seed B. Cell. 1993; 74: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). 2B. A. Binstadt, D. D. Billadeau, D. Jevremović, B. L. Williams, N. Fang, T. Yi, G. A. Koretzky, R. T. Abraham, and P. J. Leibson, unpublished data. If SHP-1 acts upstream of Syk, then KIR engagement should not affect CD16:7:Syk-initiated cellular activation. We found, however, that co-engagement of KIR completely inhibited CD16:7:Syk-triggered, T cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Fig. 3). The inhibition was reversed by overexpression of dominant-negative, catalytically inactive (C453S) SHP-1 (data not shown). No inhibition of CD16:7:Syk-initated signaling was observed following cross-linking of another cell surface protein, LFA-1 (data not shown). Thus, KIR-associated SHP-1 is able to inhibit lymphocyte activation by acting at or downstream of the point of Syk family PTK activation. Based on these results, we utilized a genetic model to determine if the protein recognized in the far Western blot is either Syk or ZAP-70. A protein of identical molecular mass to that observed from NK cell lysates was detected in lysates obtained from pervanadate-stimulated Jurkat T cells (Fig. 4 A and data not shown). Jurkat E6 cells do not express Syk (34Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Laverty M. Kut S.A. van Oers N.S.C. Weiss A. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26533-26537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and therefore the protein is not Syk. Furthermore, the protein is also present in lysates obtained from a ZAP-70-deficient Jurkat subclone, and overexpression of either Syk or ZAP-70 did not result in the appearance of additional reactive proteins (Fig. 4 A). Important to the interpretation of these results is that tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 following pervanadate stimulation remained intact in the ZAP-70-deficient P116 Jurkat clone (data not shown), although CD3 cross-linking-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 is reduced in the P116 cell line (21Williams B.L.

Thus, by genetic criteria, the inducible ∼70-kDa phosphotyrosyl protein recognized by the SHP-1 catalytic domain is neither Syk nor ZAP-70. We therefore considered downstream effectors of Syk that are in the 70-kDa range and that would be likely SHP-1 substrates. A well characterized substrate of Syk family PTKs is the adaptor protein SLP-76. The amino-terminal region of SLP-76 contains two tyrosine residues (Tyr113 and Tyr128) that are known to be phosphorylated by Syk family PTKs and that also mediate association of SLP-76 with the product of the proto-oncogeneVav (35Jackman J.K.

Immunoprecipitation of SLP-76 from lysates of pervanadate-stimulated NK cells revealed that the protein recognized by the GST SHP-1 (C453S) catalytic domain in far Western analysis was SLP-76 (Fig. 4 B). Although a small degree of association between the SHP-1 (C453S) catalytic domain and non-tyrosine-phosphorylated SLP-76 was consistently observed (Fig. 4 B, left lane), the association was clearly augmented by tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 (Fig. 4 B, second lane from left, and see Fig. 4 D). Control immunoprecipitations of Syk and ZAP-70 showed no reactivity with the SHP-1 catalytic domain despite significant tyrosine phosphorylation of both kinases. Lck, another heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated PTK, was also not recognized by the SHP-1 catalytic domain in this assay (data not shown). Far Western blots with control GST fusion proteins demonstrated no reactivity with SLP-76 (data not shown). Immunodepletion of SLP-76 from whole cell extracts selectively removed the reactive protein (Fig. 4 C). The mutated form of SLP-76 in which the three critical tyrosines are replaced by phenylalanine (3Y-F) was not tyrosine-phosphorylated following antigen-receptor stimulation of T cells (Fig. 4 D) or FcR stimulation of NK cells (data not shown). More importantly, the SHP-1 catalytic domain did not interact with SLP-76 (3Y-F) (Fig. 4 D), suggesting that these functionally critical residues are direct targets of SHP-1-dependent dephosphorylation. The activation-inducible association of the SHP-1 catalytic domain with SLP-76 contrasts with the potential constitutive interaction between these two proteins (42Mizuno K. Katagiri T. Hasegawa K. Ogimoto M. Yakura H. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although SLP-76 is known to regulate T helper cell antigen receptor signaling and cytokine production (23Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1996; 157: 3769-3773PubMed Google Scholar), a role for SLP-76 in cytotoxic lymphocytes has not been established. Significantly, we found that overexpression of wild-type SLP-76 enhanced CD3-initiated cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated killing, whereas overexpression of SLP-76 (3Y-F) did not (Fig. 5 A). Similar functional studies in NK cells were attempted, but the level of SLP-76 overexpression achieved in NK cells was minimal relative to that in T cells. Therefore, we next asked whether SLP-76 is involved in NK cell FcγRIIIA-mediated signaling and whether it is subject to the SHP-1-mediated KIR inhibitory signal. Indeed, FcR ligation resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 in NK cells. Co-engagement of KIR completely inhibited FcR-initiated SLP-76 tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas ligation of another NK cell surface receptor, CD56, did not (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, overexpression of a catalytically inactive form of SHP-1 (C453S) reversed the KIR-mediated inhibition of SLP-76 tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas overexpression of wild-type SHP-1 did not (Fig. 5 B). These results demonstrate that SLP-76 acts in the pathway involved in generation of lymphocyte cytotoxic activity that is subject to SHP-1-dependent, KIR-mediated inhibitory signaling. To determine whether KIR-associated SHP-1 selectively dephosphorylates SLP-76, we subjected lysates of pervanadate-stimulated Jurkat cells to an in vitro dephosphorylation reaction. Immunoprecipitation of SLP-76 or ZAP-70 from these treated lysates revealed that SHP-1 activated by the phospho-ITIM-containing peptide (pY1) selectively dephosphorylated SLP-76 (Fig. 5 C). Although some dephosphorylation of SLP-76 was observed in the presence of the nonphosphorylated peptide, ZAP-70 was not dephosphorylated under any of the conditions tested. Taken together, these results support a model in which SHP-1 recruited to tyrosine-phosphorylated KIR ITIMs interrupts immune cell activation by the selective dephosphorylation of the critical signaling molecule, SLP-76. The multisubunit immune recognition receptors (T cell antigen receptor, B cell antigen receptor, FcεRI, and FcγRIIIA) are each subject to negative regulation by SHP-1-utilizing inhibitory receptors (12Binstadt B.A. Brumbaugh K.M.

Each of these activating receptor systems relies not only on the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-containing receptor subunits (CD3ζ, FcRγ, Igα, and Igβ) but also on Src and Syk family PTKs (1Chan A.C.

Importantly, the recently cloned NK cell-activating receptor subunit DAP12 also bears an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif, suggesting that DAP12 may couple to similar signal transduction pathways (49Lanier L.L. Corliss B.C. Wu J. Leong C. Phillips J.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the hypothesis that the direct target of SHP-1-dependent inhibitory signaling is a phosphotyrosyl protein common to several activation pathways. Using both in vitro and functional assays, we identified SLP-76 as a direct substrate for SHP-1 recruited to inhibitory receptors. SLP-76 plays a key role in signaling by the T cell antigen receptor as well as mast cell FcεRI (23Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp.

Additionally, we have demonstrated here that SLP-76 is involved in the generation of lymphocyte cytotoxicity and that it is activated following FcγRIIIA ligation on NK cells. Whether SLP-76 and potential homologues are involved in other signaling pathways regulated by SHP-1-dependent inhibitory receptors (such as B cell antigen receptor signaling and NK cell-mediated natural killing) remains an open question. Importantly, the three tyrosine residues critical to the function of SLP-76 are also critical for recognition of SLP-76 by the catalytic domain of SHP-1. Of particular note is the fact that these tyrosine residues reside in the following motifs: FEEDDYESP, EDDGDYESP, and EDDADYEPP (35Jackman J.K. Motto D.G. Sun Q. Tanemoto M. Turck C.W. Peltz G.A.

The tyrosine residues recognized by a variety of protein tyrosine phosphatases are contained in similar motifs with several acidic residues in the –1 to –5 (relative to Tyr) position and a proline residue in the +3 position (30Garton A.J.

Thus, based on structural criteria, SLP-76 is a likely SHP-1 substrate. Interestingly, the tyrosine residues in Syk and ZAP-70 (Tyr341 and Tyr315, respectively, based on porcine Syk and human ZAP-70 numbering) that mediate binding to phospholipase C-γ and Vav also appear to reside in PTP recognition motifs (53Taniguchi T.

The recently identified p36 phosphotyrosyl protein, linker of activated T cells (LAT), also contains a tyrosine (Tyr127) in a PTP recognition motif, but Tyr127does not have an identified docking function (57Zhang W.

Although our GST SHP-1 C453S catalytic domain recognized neither Syk nor ZAP-70, a similar SHP-1 (C453S) fusion protein has been used to isolate ZAP-70 from Jurkat lysates (58Plas D.R. Johnson R.

Interpretation of such results is difficult, however, due to the possibility that the observed interaction is indirect. The far Western method we utilized does allow analysis of direct protein-protein interaction, and, in this assay, the SLP-76 catalytic domain did not interact directly with Syk or ZAP-70. One caveat, however, is that protein denaturation during electrophoresis may prevent binding in a far Western analysis. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that Syk, ZAP-70, linker of activated T cells (LAT), or other molecules could serve as additional in vivo substrates of SHP-1, particularly molecules known to transduce signals from cytokine receptors regulated by SHP-1 (59David M.

Consistent with these observations, we have demonstrated here that the SHP-1-dependent KIR inhibitory signal acts at or downstream of Syk activation. Thus, in addition to meeting the structural criteria expected of a potential SHP-1 substrate, SLP-76 fulfills the functional criteria expected for SHP-1-dependent inhibitory receptor signaling pathways. Particularly important is the fact that overexpression of a wild-type form of SLP-76 augments lymphocyte responses, whereas SLP-76 (3Y-F) has no effect (Fig. 5 A) (37Wardenburg J.B. Fu C. Jackman J.K. Flotow H. Wilkinson S.E. Williams D.H. Johnson R. Kong G. Chan A.C. Findell P.R. J. Biol.

One model that is consistent with these findings is that endogenous SLP-76 exists in a relatively stable signaling complex prior to cell stimulation. Thus, overexpressed SLP-76 (Y3-F) is both unable to remove endogenous, wild-type SLP-76 from this complex and is unable to generate signals independently—it does not act as a dominant-negative. In contrast, overexpressed wild-type SLP-76 may provide a core for the formation of new, signaling-competent complexes and therefore augment lymphocyte responsiveness. In such a model, SLP-76 activation is a rate-limiting step in lymphocyte activation. Selective targeting of such a rate-limiting step by SHP-1-utilizing inhibitory receptors would consequently be an effective strategy for inhibiting immune cell activation. When considered in conjunction with our previous demonstration that SHP-1 recruited to KIR inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of ζ, ZAP-70, and phospholipase C-γ (12Binstadt B.A. Brumbaugh K.M. Dick C.J. Scharenberg A.M. Williams B.L. Colonna M. Lanier L.L. Kinet J.-P. Abraham R.T. Leibson P.J. Immunity. 1996; 5: 629-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), the current study raises important questions regarding how SLP-76 and potential homologues function to regulate immune cell activation. A model in which several PTKs and their substrates are physically or functionally coordinated by SLP-76 is consistent with our results. SHP-1-dependent inhibitory signaling may thus act by targeting SLP-76, a central integrator of immune cell activation pathways. We thank J.-P. Kinet, A. M. Scharenberg, and B.

Treatment of these cells with tamoxifen caused a rapid stimulation of Akt enzymatic activity that was comparable with the activity observed with the endogenous Akt after insulin stimulation. Prior studies have extensively documented that insulin can repress the glucocorticoid and cAMP-stimulated increase in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene transcription. Activation of this regulatable Akt with tamoxifen was found to mimic the dominant inhibitory effect of insulin on PEPCK gene transcription. Dose response curves to insulin and tamoxifen demonstrated that this response was very sensitive to Akt activation although the maximal response observed with tamoxifen activation was slightly less than that observed with insulin, indicating that the response to insulin may also involve other signaling cascades. The regulation of PEPCK transcription via Akt was, like that previously described for insulin, not dependent upon 70 kDa S6 kinase activity in that it was not inhibited by rapamycin. Finally, the expression of a kinase dead Akt was able to partially inhibit the ability of insulin to stimulate this response. In summary, the present results indicate that activation of Akt alone is sufficient to repress the glucocorticoid and cAMP-stimulated increase in PEPCK gene transcription.

Insulin regulates the expression of more than 100 genes (1O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). One of the most extensively studied transcription processes regulated by insulin is the ability of insulin to repress the induction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)1 mRNA by glucocorticoids and cAMP (1O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 2Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). This response to insulin is important in regulating hepatic glucose output because PEPCK is the rate-limiting step in hepatic gluconeogenesis, and PEPCK activity is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level (1O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 2Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Insulin inhibition of the glucocorticoid and cAMP induction of PEPCK mRNA has been shown to be mediated via the activation of the lipid kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (3Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recent studies have documented that insulin activates this enzyme by stimulating the tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of endogenous substrates (including insulin receptor substrates 1, 2, and 3), and these tyrosine-phosphorylated endogenous substrates bind and activate the PI 3-kinase, resulting in the generation of the phospholipids phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (4Saltiel A.R.

In addition to playing a role in the regulation of PEPCK mRNA, the activation of PI 3-kinase has been found to play a role in a number of other insulin-stimulated biological responses including stimulation of glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation, activation of the 70-kDa S6 kinase, stimulation of glycogen synthesis and in the inhibition of apoptosis (4Saltiel A.R.

In contrast, activation of the 70-kDa S6 kinase and the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade were found not to be required for the repression of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin (3Sutherland C.

Recent studies have identified a number of downstream targets of the phospholipid products of the PI 3-kinase. These include a serine/threonine kinase named Akt or PKB as well as several isoforms of the protein kinase C family of serine/threonine kinases (6Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar, 10Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar, 11Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A.

In addition, the PI 3-lipids also bind and activate other classes of molecules including an ADP-ribosylation exchange factor named GRP1 (12Klarlund J.K. Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. Buxton J.M. Holik J.J.

To determine which biological responses can be mediated via the activation of the Akt serine/threonine kinase, we have designed a regulatable form of this enzyme (13Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11937-11943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This construct encodes an Akt chimera consisting of a myristoylated form of Akt-1 fused to a mutant hormone binding unit of the estrogen receptor. Treatment of cells with the estrogen antagonist hydroxytamoxifen (HT) causes a rapid activation of this chimeric enzyme. In the present studies we have expressed this chimera in the rat hepatoma cell line H4IIE and used it to examine the ability of Akt to repress the glucocorticoid/cAMP induction of PEPCK gene expression. The present studies demonstrate that activation of Akt is sufficient to mimic this biological response of insulin. The following were purchased: [γ-32P]ATP from NEN Life Science Products; insulin from Boehringer Mannheim; 8-bromoadenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate and dexamethasone from Sigma; hydroxytamoxifen from Research Biochemicals; LY294002 from Alexis Biochemicals; rapamycin and blasticidin S from Calbiochem; polyclonal antibodies to p70/p85 ribosomal S6 protein kinase from Upstate Biotechnology; monoclonal antibodies to Akt from Transduction Laboratories; Anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 from Boehringer Mannheim; and G418 from Life Technologies, Inc.

An inactive Akt was made by site-directed mutagenesis of the important regulatory phosphorylation sites threonine 308 and serine 473 to alanine in the plasmid encoding the full-length Akt (14Kohn A.D.

This plasmid was then subcloned into the retroviral vector pBMN-Z-I-Blasto (a gift from Garry P. Nolan). H4IIE cells were infected with pWZLneo/MER-Akt or pBMN-Z-I-Blasto/Akt T308A, S473A as described previously (14Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

The former were selected by using 1 mg/ml of G418, whereas the latter were selected by using 10 μg/ml of blasticidin S. Cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 2.5% fetal calf serum and 2.5% newborn calf serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Before treatment, cells were deprived of serum overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then incubated with hormones and inhibitors as indicated in the figure legends. The expressed MER-Akt was specifically immunoprecipitated by using a monoclonal antibody to the HA-tag present on this enzyme. The endogenous Akt was specifically precipitated by using a polyclonal antibody to the Akt-1 pleckstrin homology domain (15Krook A. Kawano Y. Song X.M. Efendic S. Roth R.A. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Zierath J.R. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 2110-2114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), because the MER-Akt does not contain the pleckstrin homology domain (13Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B.

Western blots were performed with either the monoclonal antibody to HA (for the expressed MER-Akt) or with a monoclonal antibody to Akt-1 (for the endogenous Akt). Akt kinase assays were performed with the GSK-3 peptide (sequence GRPRTSSFAEG) (16Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar), and the phosphorylation of the peptide was monitored by analyzing the samples on a 6 m urea, 40% polyacrylamide gel as described previously (13Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

Primer extension analyses for the PEPCK and β-actin mRNAs were performed essentially as described (17Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol.

After the primer extension reaction, the products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 7.5 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide gel, visualized by autoradiography, and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. H4IIE hepatoma cells stably expressing a tamoxifen-regulatable form of Akt-1 were developed by infecting these cells with retroviruses encoding MER-Akt (13Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11937-11943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and selecting those cells that became resistant to the drug-selectable marker encoded by the retrovirus. The amount of tamoxifen-regulatable Akt enzymatic activity expressed in these cells was compared with the amount of insulin-stimulated endogenous Akt present in these cells. To this end, cells were treated with different concentration of either insulin or tamoxifen, lysed, and either the endogenous or expressed Akt chimera were precipitated with specific antibodies to each molecule. The amount of enzymatic activity in the precipitates was then determined via the use of a synthetic peptide based on the sequence of the Akt phosphorylation site in GSK-3 (16Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar). The maximal amounts of Akt activity stimulated by insulin and tamoxifen were approximately the same and represented an approximate 30-fold increase over basal levels (Fig. 1). The stimulation could be observed with either 0.1 or 1 nm of insulin or tamoxifen, respectively (Fig. 1). Because PEPCK mRNA transcription is low in the absence of any stimulus, we studied the ability of insulin and Akt to repress the induction of PEPCK mRNA stimulated by a combination of a nonhydrolyzable cAMP analog and the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. The levels of endogenous PEPCK mRNA were monitored by primer extension analysis. As previously reported (1O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), insulin completely inhibited the induction of PEPCK mRNA by the dexamethasone/cAMP treatment (Fig. 2). Activation of the regulatable Akt by tamoxifen was also capable of largely inhibiting the increase in mRNA caused by the dexamethasone/cAMP treatment in the cells expressing the construct encoding the chimeric MER-Akt (Fig. 2). In contrast, tamoxifen had no effect on the induction of the PEPCK mRNA in control cells not expressing the regulatable Akt (Fig. 2), demonstrating that this effect of tamoxifen was mediated via the expressed MER-Akt. To better compare the repression of PEPCK mRNA induction with tamoxifen and insulin, a dose curve was performed with different concentrations of insulin and tamoxifen (Fig. 3). As previously reported for insulin (17Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the inhibition of PEPCK mRNA transcription was exquisitely sensitive to insulin, with 0.1 nm insulin causing almost a maximal response. The response to tamoxifen was also quite sensitive with 1 nm tamoxifen also causing an almost maximal response. The maximal inhibition observed with insulin was greater than that observed with tamoxifen (Fig. 3). Because previous studies have demonstrated that Akt can also activate the 70-kDa S6 kinase (20Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether this enzyme was playing a role in the Akt regulation of PEPCK mRNA. Cells were therefore stimulated with tamoxifen in the presence or absence of rapamycin, an inhibitor of the activation of the 70-kDa S6 kinase (21Kuo C.J. Chung J. Fiorentino D.F. Flanagan W.M. Blenis J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 358: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar,22Price D.J. Grove J.R. Calvo V. Avruch J. Bierer B.E. Science. 1992; 257: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Rapamycin was found to have only a slight affect on the ability of Akt to regulate PEPCK mRNA, similar to that observed with insulin (Fig. 4). Controls verified that rapamycin completely prevented the activation of the 70-kDa S6 kinase by insulin and MER-Akt as monitored by a shift in the migration of the 70-kDa S6 kinase (Fig. 5). As expected, rapamycin had no effect on the activation of the enzymatic activity of either the endogenous Akt or the chimeric MER-Akt (Fig. 5). In contrast, a specific inhibitor of the PI 3-kinase (23Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), LY294002, completely inhibited the ability of both insulin and Akt to repress PEPCK mRNA transcription (Fig. 4). This inhibition correlated with the ability of this compound to block the activation of the enzymatic activity of both the endogenous and the expressed MER-Akt by insulin and tamoxifen, respectively (Fig. 5).Figure 5Effects of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 and the S6 kinase inhibitor rapamycin on Akt enzymatic activity and the 70-kDa S6 kinase shift. H4IIE/MER-Akt cells were treated with either buffer, 50 μm LY294002 (LY) or 200 nm rapamycin (Rapa) for 1 h before the addition of either buffer, insulin, or tamoxifen (HT). After an additional 30 min of incubation, the cells were lysed, and a fraction of the total lysate was used to monitor the shift in p70 S6 kinase migration by Western blotting (top panel). The remainder of the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either an antibody to the endogenous Akt (lanes 1–4), or a monoclonal antibody to the HA-tag on the expressed Akt chimeras (lanes 5–8). The immunoprecipitates were assayed for Akt enzymatic activity by using the GSK-3 peptide and then analyzed for Akt by Western blotting. Panel B shows a representative Western blot of the precipitates and panel C shows a representative GSK-3 assay. The means ± S.E. of three different experiments are shown in panel D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Finally, to test the role of endogenous Akt in mediating the insulin-stimulated repression of PEPCK mRNA, we expressed a kinase dead Akt in the H4IIE cells. This mutant Akt has had its two regulatory phosphorylation sites (24Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar) (threonine 308 and serine 473) changed to alanine and thus is enzymatically inactive (24Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). The expression of this kinase dead Akt partially inhibited the ability of insulin to repress the dexamethasone/cAMP induction of PEPCK mRNA (Fig. 6). Recent studies have documented that insulin activates PI 3-kinase, and this enzymatic activity appears to be required for insulin to elicit several of its biological responses including the regulation of the PEPCK mRNA (3Sutherland C.

Studies with inhibitors of the ERK1/ERK2 and the 70-kDa S6 kinase cascades have shown that it is unlikely that these enzymes play a role in mediating the ability of insulin to regulate PEPCK gene expression (3Sutherland C.

In the present work, we have examined the ability of the serine/threonine kinase Akt to regulate PEPCK mRNA. To do this, a line of H4IIE hepatoma cells was constructed which expressed a tamoxifen-regulatable Akt-1. These cells exhibited a rapid and large increase in Akt enzymatic activity after tamoxifen stimulation. The amount of expressed activity after tamoxifen stimulation as assessedin vitro with an exogenous substrate appears to be comparable with that of the endogenous Akt-1 stimulated with insulin. In addition, these cells also appear to have an insulin-stimulated Akt-3 at approximately one-third the levels of the Akt-1. 2K. Nakatani, J. Liao, and R.A. Roth, unpublished studies. Thus, the total amount of expressed Akt activity in these cells is the same or lower then the total amount of endogenous Akt present in these cells after insulin stimulation. The activation of the regulatable Akt with tamoxifen treatment was found to be sufficient to repress the dexamethasone/cAMP-stimulated increase in PEPCK mRNA. This response was observed with even a submaximal stimulatory dose of tamoxifen, in agreement with the data with the insulin stimulation. Also like the insulin regulation of PEPCK mRNA, the response to tamoxifen was not inhibited by rapamycin, an inhibitor of the activation of the 70-kDa S6 kinase (21Kuo C.J. Chung J. Fiorentino D.F. Flanagan W.M. Blenis J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 358: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 22Price D.J. Grove J.R. Calvo V. Avruch J. Bierer B.E. Science. 1992; 257: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The response to tamoxifen required the presence of the MER-Akt, because cells not expressing this construct showed no response to the tamoxifen. The maximal response observed with tamoxifen was less then the maximal response observed with insulin, possibly suggesting that the response to insulin may in part be mediated through a combination of signaling pathways. Alternatively, it is possible that this chimeric Akt molecule does not signal as efficiently as the endogenous Akt. The finding that overexpression of a kinase inactive Akt at least partly inhibits the ability of insulin to regulate PEPCK mRNA is consistent with a role for the endogenous Akt in mediating the normal insulin response. Exactly how the expression of such a kinase inactive Akt functions is not clear. Although some studies have suggested that expression of a kinase inactive Akt interferes with the activation of endogenous Akt (27Songyang Z. Baltimore D. Cantley L.C. Kaplan D.R. Franke T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11345-11350Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 28Dudek H. Datta S. Franke T. Birnbaum M. Yao R. Cooper G. Segal R. Kaplan D. Greenberg M. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar), we have observed no such inhibition.2 It is possible that the kinase inactive Akt competes with the endogenous Akt for some downstream substrates of the enzyme. The partial inhibition observed with this kinase inactive Akt is consistent with the partial inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake previously observed after expression of a kinase inactive Akt (29Cong L.N. Chen H. Li Y. Zhou L. McGibbon M.A. Taylor S.I. Quon M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the present data support a role for Akt in the insulin repression of the dexamethasone/cAMP-stimulated increase in PEPCK gene transcription. This finding extends the potential roles of Akt in mediating various insulin-stimulated biological responses. It is also consistent with a recent report that transient transfection of a constitutively active Akt can negatively regulate the basal expression of a reporter construct containing a conserved insulin response sequence from the promoter of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 gene (30Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These authors also showed that this constitutively active Akt regulated the expression of a conserved sequence from the promoter of the PEPCK gene. The present work extends this previous study because it demonstrates for the first time that transcription of the endogenous PEPCK gene can also be regulated via Akt. In addition, we show that Akt can repress the induction of PEPCK transcription by dexamethasone and cAMP. And finally, the present studies demonstrate that these effects of Akt occur with Akt enzymatic activities comparable with those induced by insulin. During the course of the review of this manuscript, Agati et al. (31Agati J.M. Yeagley D. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18751-18759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) also reported the results of studies examining the ability of transiently expressed Akt to regulate a luciferase reporter construct containing the promoter region (−600/+69) of the PEPCK gene. In these studies the authors found that a constitutively active Akt did inhibit the cAMP kinase-stimulated increase in the expression of the reporter construct by approximately 50%. The remaining expression of this construct was further inhibited by insulin treatment. In addition, these authors did not observe any inhibition of the insulin effect on this reporter construct after the transient expression of three different defective Akt constructs. These results were interpreted to indicate that Akt was not involved in the insulin inhibition of PKA-induced PEPCK gene expression. Because these studies only utilized transient transfections, it was impossible to determine how much Akt enzymatic activity was expressed with the constitutively active form of the enzyme relative to what was stimulated by insulin. In addition, because only a few percent of the cells expressed these constructs, the authors could not determine whether the defective Akt constructs actually inhibited the insulin-stimulated activation of the endogenous Akt. Recent studies have shown that inhibition of endogenous Akt by these defective Akt constructs is problematic (32van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M. de Vries-Smits A.M. van Lint J. Burgering B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13150-13156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In addition, as demonstrated in the present work, only a very low level of Akt enzymatic activity is sufficient to repress the PEPCK gene transcription. The blockage of the insulin response would therefore require that the expression of the defective Akt almost completely inhibit the activation of the endogenous Akt. Thus, the role of Akt in mediating a particular biological response is difficult to rule out via the use of transient transfections of defective Akt molecules."

The polysialic acid (PSA) moiety of NCAM can serve as a negative regulator of homophilic binding, but indirect evidence has suggested that PSA can also be involved in heterophilic binding. We have examined this potential positive role for PSA in terms of the adhesion of PSA-expressing mouse F11 cells and chick embryonic brain cells to substrates composed of the purified heparan sulfate proteoglycans agrin and 6C4. This adhesion was specifically inhibited by polyclonal anti-NCAM Fab antibodies, monoclonal anti-PSA antibodies, PSA itself, and enzymatic removal of either PSA or heparan sulfate side chains. By contrast, the adhesion was not affected by chondroitinase, and cell binding to laminin was not inhibited by any of these treatments.

Although the biological significance of NCAM heterophilic binding remains to be established, two HSPGs with interesting developmental expression patterns, namely agrin and the 6C4 antigen (21Halfter W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2863-2873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Halfter W. Schurer B. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 23Tsen G. Halfter W. Kröger S.

Anvekar V.M. Adams L.D. Murray B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Storms S.D. Kim A.C. Tran B.-H.T. Cole G.J.

Furthermore, the lethality of soluble NCAM produced in transgenic mice is most consistent with its interaction with a non-NCAM receptor (25Rabinowitz J.E. Rutishauser U. Magnuson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6421-6424Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).The possibility of multiple NCAM binding activities presents a challenge to the interpretation of NCAM perturbation and gene mutation studies, particularly in terms of molecular mechanism. One aspect of this ambiguity concerns the mode of action of the polysialic acid (PSA) moiety attached to NCAM. PSA has been proposed to function as a negative regulator of cell-cell interactions, possibly through steric effects stemming from its large size and abundance (26Rutishauser U. Acheson A. Hall A.K. Mann D.M. Sunshine J. Science. 1988; 240: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Extensive evidence has been obtained both in vitro and in vivo to support this role and to establish its importance in promoting plasticity in cell interactions during development, notably in specific patterns of axon outgrowth and cell migration (27Rutishauser U. Landmesser L. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 422-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). However, there has also been an indirect suggestion that there might be an additional role for PSA in heterophilic binding. Specifically, a monoclonal anti-NCAM antibody was shown to block heterophilic binding of cells to an NCAM substrate less well when that substrate had a higher content of PSA, an effect that could be explained by a positive role of PSA in the adhesion process (28Storms S.D. Jensen J.J. Yaghmai D. Murray B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).In this study, we have used the in vitro adhesion assay utilized by Storms et al. (15Storms S.D. Anvekar V.M. Adams L.D. Murray B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Storms S.D. Kim A.C. Tran B.-H.T. Cole G.J. Murray B.A. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1996; 3: 497-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain direct evidence for a positive role for PSA in cell adhesion mediated by heterophilic binding of NCAM to two purified HSPG substrates, agrin and 6C4. Mouse F11 cells bearing moderate levels of PSA and chick embryonic brain cells bearing high levels of PSA were used in these assays. A combination of specific antibody, enzyme, and competitive inhibitors (NCAM peptides and PSA fragments) was used to establish that this influence of PSA involves the known heparin-binding domain of NCAM and is distinct from the homophilic binding domain.DISCUSSIONThe primary goals of this study were to evaluate a direct role for PSA in promotion of NCAM-mediated heterophilic cell adhesion and to characterize the molecular components and specificity of that adhesion. It has been found that PSA is indeed required for the adhesion of cells to defined HSPG substrates. Furthermore, the molecular components of this PSA-dependent binding conform precisely to the heparin-binding activity of NCAM previously described by others (9Cole G.J. Loewy A. Glaser L. Nature. 1986; 320: 445-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 10Cole G.J. Loewy A. Cross N.V. Akeson R. Glaser L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1730-1744Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Cole G.J. Glaser L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 12Cole G.J. Akeson R.

Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Thus, to the findings of earlier studies showing that heparan sulfate and the HBD of NCAM are necessary for NCAM-HSPG interaction (11Cole G.J. Glaser L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 12Cole G.J. Akeson R. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1157-1165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) is now added a role for intact polysialic side chains on NCAM. Thus, either PSA removal with endo N or the binding of anti-PSA antibodies was found to be functionally equivalent to enzymatic removal of heparan sulfate or antibody blockage of the HBD region of NCAM. The correspondence, in terms of monoclonal antibody inhibition patterns, of the present adhesion activity with the NCAM heparin-binding domain is also compelling, i.e. both antibodies directed against the heparin-binding domain of Ig domain 2 were inhibitory, whereas all others, including those directed against the homophilic binding site, were not.The addition of a second activity for PSA that, at the level of adhesion, acts in the opposite manner as the previously described negative regulatory activity represents an important consideration in the mechanistic interpretation of PSA function in biological systems. However, in preliminary studies on the possible role of this type of adhesion in the PSA-dependent bundling of neuronal processes (30Acheson A. Sunshine J.L. Rutishauser U. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and the migration of neuronal precursors in vitro (36Hu H. Tomasiewicz H. Magnuson T. Rutishauser U. Neuron. 1995; 16: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (326) Google Scholar), we did not find any detectable effects with either the HBD-2 peptide or heparinases. 3S. D. Storms and U. Rutishauser, unpublished observations. Thus, a biological role for heterophilic NCAM-HSPG interactions remains to be demonstrated. On the other hand, given the specificity of this adhesion with respect to proteoglycan type, the presence of a distinct HSPG-binding site on NCAM, and the abundance of HSPGs in the in vivo environment of PSA/NCAM-expressing cells, it seems unlikely that this phenomenon is simply an in vitro artifact. However, whether this binding by itself mediates adhesion under physiological conditions, as opposed to being a component of a more complex form of interaction, remains unknown.Finally, although the results obtained indicate that PSA is required for NCAM-dependent binding of cells to an HSPG substrate via a specific HSPG-binding site located at least in part in NCAM Ig domain 2, it remains unclear whether PSA actually binds to HSPGs or indirectly modulates an NCAM-HSPG interaction. Three possible mechanisms to explain the present results are illustrated schematically in Fig. 8. The simplest is that stable attachment of the cells to the substrate requires an affinity of the HSPG for PSA itself as well as for the HSPG-binding region on NCAM Ig domain 2, either as distinct additive sites or as complementary components of a single site (dual binding model). In addition to explaining the inhibition of attachment by endo N, soluble PSA fragments, the HBD-2 peptide, and heparinases, this model would be easiest to reconcile with the inhibition by antibodies that bind to PSA. However, it remains to be established whether either the HSPG core proteins or glycomoieties have an affinity for the PSA polymer.A second potential mechanism would be that the presence of PSA induces a conformational change in the NCAM polypeptide to produce or enhance the HSPG-binding site (conformation model). However, there is no direct evidence for such an effect, and preliminary studies on the binding of heparin to NCAM-coated Sepharose did not reveal a difference in binding when high or low PSA-containing NCAM was used.3 Another indirect model is that clustering of NCAM in the plane of the membrane, which has been proposed on the basis of kinetic arguments in cell membrane adhesion studies (4Hoffman S. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5762-5766Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), might be inhibited by PSA. If such clustering served to mask HSPG-binding sites, attachment of the membranes to an HSPG substrate could be compromised (clustering model). Although we have not observed an effect of PSA on the spontaneous or antibody-induced clustering of NCAM to form patches visible by light microscopy,3 it is quite possible that this effect would involve aggregates of a small number of molecules.In sum, the present findings provide a quite precise description of a molecular interaction involving two very abundant components of the extracellular environment of many tissues, thus validating earlier suggestions (28Storms S.D. Jensen J.J. Yaghmai D. Murray B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) that the role of PSA in NCAM binding properties might be more complex than previously reported. At the same time, they raise a far greater number of questions as to the exact basis for that interaction and the biological realm in which it operates. Clearly, a resolution of these issues is going to require a far more complete understanding of the mechanisms of action of NCAM and the full range of NCAM-mediated biology and thus are likely to remain an issue in the field for quite some time.

Although the biological significance of NCAM heterophilic binding remains to be established, two HSPGs with interesting developmental expression patterns, namely agrin and the 6C4 antigen (21Halfter W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2863-2873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Halfter W. Schurer B. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 23Tsen G. Halfter W. Kröger S.

Anvekar V.M. Adams L.D. Murray B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Storms S.D. Kim A.C. Tran B.-H.T. Cole G.J.

Furthermore, the lethality of soluble NCAM produced in transgenic mice is most consistent with its interaction with a non-NCAM receptor (25Rabinowitz J.E. Rutishauser U. Magnuson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6421-6424Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The possibility of multiple NCAM binding activities presents a challenge to the interpretation of NCAM perturbation and gene mutation studies, particularly in terms of molecular mechanism. One aspect of this ambiguity concerns the mode of action of the polysialic acid (PSA) moiety attached to NCAM. PSA has been proposed to function as a negative regulator of cell-cell interactions, possibly through steric effects stemming from its large size and abundance (26Rutishauser U. Acheson A. Hall A.K. Mann D.M. Sunshine J. Science. 1988; 240: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Extensive evidence has been obtained both in vitro and in vivo to support this role and to establish its importance in promoting plasticity in cell interactions during development, notably in specific patterns of axon outgrowth and cell migration (27Rutishauser U. Landmesser L. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 422-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). However, there has also been an indirect suggestion that there might be an additional role for PSA in heterophilic binding. Specifically, a monoclonal anti-NCAM antibody was shown to block heterophilic binding of cells to an NCAM substrate less well when that substrate had a higher content of PSA, an effect that could be explained by a positive role of PSA in the adhesion process (28Storms S.D. Jensen J.J. Yaghmai D. Murray B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used the in vitro adhesion assay utilized by Storms et al. (15Storms S.D. Anvekar V.M. Adams L.D. Murray B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Storms S.D. Kim A.C. Tran B.-H.T. Cole G.J. Murray B.A. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1996; 3: 497-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain direct evidence for a positive role for PSA in cell adhesion mediated by heterophilic binding of NCAM to two purified HSPG substrates, agrin and 6C4. Mouse F11 cells bearing moderate levels of PSA and chick embryonic brain cells bearing high levels of PSA were used in these assays. A combination of specific antibody, enzyme, and competitive inhibitors (NCAM peptides and PSA fragments) was used to establish that this influence of PSA involves the known heparin-binding domain of NCAM and is distinct from the homophilic binding domain. DISCUSSIONThe primary goals of this study were to evaluate a direct role for PSA in promotion of NCAM-mediated heterophilic cell adhesion and to characterize the molecular components and specificity of that adhesion. It has been found that PSA is indeed required for the adhesion of cells to defined HSPG substrates. Furthermore, the molecular components of this PSA-dependent binding conform precisely to the heparin-binding activity of NCAM previously described by others (9Cole G.J. Loewy A. Glaser L. Nature. 1986; 320: 445-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 10Cole G.J. Loewy A. Cross N.V. Akeson R. Glaser L. J.

Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Thus, to the findings of earlier studies showing that heparan sulfate and the HBD of NCAM are necessary for NCAM-HSPG interaction (11Cole G.J. Glaser L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 12Cole G.J. Akeson R. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1157-1165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) is now added a role for intact polysialic side chains on NCAM. Thus, either PSA removal with endo N or the binding of anti-PSA antibodies was found to be functionally equivalent to enzymatic removal of heparan sulfate or antibody blockage of the HBD region of NCAM. The correspondence, in terms of monoclonal antibody inhibition patterns, of the present adhesion activity with the NCAM heparin-binding domain is also compelling, i.e. both antibodies directed against the heparin-binding domain of Ig domain 2 were inhibitory, whereas all others, including those directed against the homophilic binding site, were not.The addition of a second activity for PSA that, at the level of adhesion, acts in the opposite manner as the previously described negative regulatory activity represents an important consideration in the mechanistic interpretation of PSA function in biological systems. However, in preliminary studies on the possible role of this type of adhesion in the PSA-dependent bundling of neuronal processes (30Acheson A. Sunshine J.L. Rutishauser U. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and the migration of neuronal precursors in vitro (36Hu H. Tomasiewicz H. Magnuson T. Rutishauser U. Neuron. 1995; 16: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (326) Google Scholar), we did not find any detectable effects with either the HBD-2 peptide or heparinases. 3S. D. Storms and U. Rutishauser, unpublished observations. Thus, a biological role for heterophilic NCAM-HSPG interactions remains to be demonstrated. On the other hand, given the specificity of this adhesion with respect to proteoglycan type, the presence of a distinct HSPG-binding site on NCAM, and the abundance of HSPGs in the in vivo environment of PSA/NCAM-expressing cells, it seems unlikely that this phenomenon is simply an in vitro artifact. However, whether this binding by itself mediates adhesion under physiological conditions, as opposed to being a component of a more complex form of interaction, remains unknown.Finally, although the results obtained indicate that PSA is required for NCAM-dependent binding of cells to an HSPG substrate via a specific HSPG-binding site located at least in part in NCAM Ig domain 2, it remains unclear whether PSA actually binds to HSPGs or indirectly modulates an NCAM-HSPG interaction. Three possible mechanisms to explain the present results are illustrated schematically in Fig. 8. The simplest is that stable attachment of the cells to the substrate requires an affinity of the HSPG for PSA itself as well as for the HSPG-binding region on NCAM Ig domain 2, either as distinct additive sites or as complementary components of a single site (dual binding model). In addition to explaining the inhibition of attachment by endo N, soluble PSA fragments, the HBD-2 peptide, and heparinases, this model would be easiest to reconcile with the inhibition by antibodies that bind to PSA. However, it remains to be established whether either the HSPG core proteins or glycomoieties have an affinity for the PSA polymer.A second potential mechanism would be that the presence of PSA induces a conformational change in the NCAM polypeptide to produce or enhance the HSPG-binding site (conformation model). However, there is no direct evidence for such an effect, and preliminary studies on the binding of heparin to NCAM-coated Sepharose did not reveal a difference in binding when high or low PSA-containing NCAM was used.3 Another indirect model is that clustering of NCAM in the plane of the membrane, which has been proposed on the basis of kinetic arguments in cell membrane adhesion studies (4Hoffman S. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5762-5766Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), might be inhibited by PSA. If such clustering served to mask HSPG-binding sites, attachment of the membranes to an HSPG substrate could be compromised (clustering model). Although we have not observed an effect of PSA on the spontaneous or antibody-induced clustering of NCAM to form patches visible by light microscopy,3 it is quite possible that this effect would involve aggregates of a small number of molecules.In sum, the present findings provide a quite precise description of a molecular interaction involving two very abundant components of the extracellular environment of many tissues, thus validating earlier suggestions (28Storms S.D. Jensen J.J. Yaghmai D. Murray B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) that the role of PSA in NCAM binding properties might be more complex than previously reported. At the same time, they raise a far greater number of questions as to the exact basis for that interaction and the biological realm in which it operates. Clearly, a resolution of these issues is going to require a far more complete understanding of the mechanisms of action of NCAM and the full range of NCAM-mediated biology and thus are likely to remain an issue in the field for quite some time.

In this study, we show that pro-CpU serves as a substrate for transglutaminases. Both factor XIIIa and tissue transglutaminase catalyzed the polymerization of pro-CpU and the cross-linking to fibrin as well as the incorporation of 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl cadaverine (dansylcadaverine), [14C]putrescine, and dansyl-PGGQQIV. These findings show that pro-CpU contains both amine acceptor (Gln) and amine donor (Lys) residues. The amine acceptor residues were identified as Gln2, Gln5, and Gln292, suggesting that both the activation peptide and the mature enzyme participate in the cross-linking reaction. These observations imply that transglutaminases may mediate covalent binding of pro-CpU to other proteins and cell surfaces in vivo. In particular, factor XIIIa may cross-link pro-CpU to fibrin during the latter part of the coagulation cascade, thereby helping protect the newly formed fibrin clot from premature plasmin degradation.

The mechanism most likely involves the removal of exposed COOH-terminal Lys residues on the surface of a “mature” fibrin clot, thus limiting the number of Lys binding sites. COOH-terminal Lys residues are not found on a newly formed clot. However, initial partial plasmin degradation exposes these residues, which then act as binding sites for tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen, and plasmin (15Tran-Thang C. Kruithof E.K.

Accordingly, the interactions between COOH-terminal Lys residues and Lys binding sites are recognized as potential targets for the regulation of the fibrinolytic system. Early studies examined the ability of pancreatic carboxypeptidase B and carboxypeptidase N to reduce the binding capacity of the fibrin clot (9Christensen U.

More recently, it has been shown that CpU similarly affects the stability of a fibrin clot in vitro (2Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol.

Transglutaminases (EC 2.3.2.13) comprise a family of calcium-dependent enzymes, which formN ε(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-links between polypeptide chains (17Lorand L. Conrad S.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 58: 9-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). During the final stages of fibrin deposition, the clot is mechanically stabilized by the factor XIIIa-catalyzed formation of N ε(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-links between Lys residues (amine donor) and Gln residues (amine acceptor) in adjacent fibrin monomers. In connection with this reaction, other proteins are cross-linked to the clot, including α2-antiplasmin (18Ichinose A. Tamaki T. Aoki N. FEBS Lett. 1983; 153: 369-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), von Willebrand factor (19Hada M. Kaminski M. Bockenstedt P. McDonagh J.

Consequently, it is uncertain how CpU is maintained in the clotting milieu. In this study, we present evidence that pro-CpU is a substrate for transglutaminases and is cross-linked to fibrin in vitro. These observations may have important biological significance, and they suggest that pro-CpU is incorporated into the fibrin clot during the latter part of the coagulation cascade.

Sequencing grade porcine trypsin was from Promega, Madison, WI. Recombinant human factor XIIIa was a kind gift from Dr. Charles S. Greenberg, Duke University Medical Center. Fresh frozen human plasma was obtained from American Red Cross Blood Services (Charlotte, NC). Pro-CpU was purified from human plasma by plasminogen-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described previously (1Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol.

Pro-CpU was separated from α2-antiplasmin by anion exchange chromatography on a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) connected to a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech fast protein liquid chromatography system. The column was equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 (Buffer A) and developed using a 0.3% Buffer B/min linear gradient from Buffer A to 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 1m NaCl (buffer B) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Plasminogen, α2-antiplasmin, and extracellular superoxide dismutase were purified as described previously (24Wiman B. Biochem.

SDS-PAGE was performed in 5–15% gradient gels (10 × 10 × 0.15 cm) using the glycine/2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol/HCl system previously described (26Bury A. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 213: 491-500Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Gels were either stained directly using Coomassie Blue or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for Edman degradation (27Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactive bands were visualized in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics 410A). Tissue transglutaminase or factor XIIIa was incubated with pro-CpU at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm Ca2+, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm dansylcadaverine (28Lorand L.

Parameswaran K.N. Velasco P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 82-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) at increasing enzyme:substrate concentrations (see Fig. 1). The reactions were continued for 3 h at 37 °C before 10 mm EDTA was added. The reaction products were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and examined under UV light. Tissue transglutaminases or factor XIIIa was incubated with125I-labeled pro-CpU for 4 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm Ca2+, and 0.5 mm DTT at increasing enzyme:substrate concentrations in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture composed of 2 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 0.02 mm E-64 (see Fig. 2). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 mmEDTA, and the reaction products were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained for protein using Coomassie Blue, and radioactive bands were visualized in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics 410A). One mg of pro-CpU was incubated with 100 μg of factor XIIIa or guinea pig tissue transglutaminase in 50 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 50 mCi 1.4-[14C]putrescine, 10 mmCa2+, and 0.5 mm DTT. The reaction was continued for 5 h at 37 °C and chased for an additional 5 h with 10 mm putrescine. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 mm EDTA. The 1.4-[14C]putrescine-labeled pro-CpU (1 mg) was reduced by adding 5 mm DTT in the presence of 6m guanidinium chloride in 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8. The reaction was quenched after 30 min by the addition of 10 mm iodoacetic acid. The reduced and alkylated sample was then dialyzed into 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate and digested with trypsin (1:50, w/w) for 4 h at 37 °C. The generated peptides were lyophilized and separated by high performance size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex, Peptide HC 10/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) connected to a SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 20 mm phosphate buffer, 250 mm NaCl, pH 7.2. Aliquots of the collected fractions were counted in a scintillation counter (Beckman LS 5000 TD) and fractions containing 14C radioactivity were pooled. These pools were further separated by reverse phase HPLC using a combination of columns including Vydac C18/5 μm, 300 Å (250 × 2.1 mm), Nucleosil C18/5 μm, 300 Å (250 × 2.0 mm), and Jupiter 300 C18/5 μm, 300Å (250 × 2.0 mm) (all columns were from Phenomenex, Torrence, CA). The columns were connected to an Applied Biosystems 130A HPLC system and eluted using linear gradients in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile. Peptides were monitored at 220 nm and collected manually. Radioactive peptides were further analyzed by Edman degradation and plasma desorption time of flight mass spectrometry. MaxiSorp™ polystyrene tubes (Nunc) were coated with fibrin by incubating 200 μl of human fibrinogen at 500 μg/ml and 0.1 National Institutes of Health units of thrombin for 20 min. The tubes were emptied, washed three times with 50 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 (Buffer A) and blocked overnight with 1% bovine serum albumin in Buffer A at 4 °C. The next day, the tubes were washed with Buffer A, and 0.2 μg of iodinated pro-CpU or 0.225 μg of iodinated α2-antiplasmin were added in triplicates. The cross-linking reactions were initiated by adding tissue transglutaminase or FXIIIa ranging from 0.05 to 10 μg in Buffer A containing 10 mm CalCl2 and 0.5 mm DTT. The volumes were adjusted to 100 μl, and the reactions were continued for 4 h at 37 °C. The tubes were washed three times in 1) Buffer A containing 10 mm EDTA, 2) 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 3, and 3) Buffer A containing 1% SDS. After the last washing step, the tubes were counted for γ-radioactivity. Automated Edman degradation was carried out in an Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer with on-line analysis of the phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) amino acids using an Applied Biosystems 120A HPLC. The remaining PTH-derivatives were collected and counted for 14C radioactivity. In selected runs, the eluate from the 120A HPLC system was collected at timed intervals and counted for 14C radioactivity to determine the retention of PTH-Gln-[14C]putrescine. Some samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes before Edman degradation (27Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of proteins were determined by amino acid analysis (29Ozols J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 587-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The samples were desalted and the absorbances at 280 nm was determined. Aliquots were dried and hydrolyzed for 24 h in 6 m HCl, and the amino acid composition was determined in a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer. The determined absorbance coefficient for pro-CpU wasA 1%, 1 cm = 20.6. The concentration of other proteins were calculated according to the following absorbance coefficients: α2-antiplasmin,A 1%, 1 cm = 13.0 (30Enghild J.J. Valnickova Z. Thøgersen I.B. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and a fibrinogenA 1%, 1 cm = 13.9 (31Fasman, G. D. (1989) pp. 196–327, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FLGoogle Scholar). Peptides were analyzed in a BioIon 20K plasma desorption instrument (Applied Biosystems AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The peptides were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied to nitrocellulose-covered targets. The spectrums were recorded at 15 kV for 1 × 106 primary fission events. Further details of the instrumentation and spectral analysis have been described elsewhere (32Sundqvist B. Kamensky I. Håkansson P. Kjellberg J. Salehpour M. Widdiyasekera S. Fohlman J. Peterson P.A. Roepstorff P. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1984; 11: 242-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To test whether pro-CpU serves as a substrate for transglutaminases, we monitored the incorporation of fluorescent donor (dansylcadaverine) or acceptor (dansyl-PGGQQIV) substrates by tissue transglutaminase or factor XIIIa. Pro-CpU and the fluorescent probes were incubated with increasing amount of factor XIIIa or tissue transglutaminase. The reactions were continued for 3 h, and the products were analyzed by reduced SDS-PAGE and examined under UV light (Fig. 1). It is apparent that transglutaminases catalyzed the incorporation of both probes into pro-CpU in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Other proteins, not expected to be transglutaminase substrates, including human extracellular superoxide dismutase, bovine serum albumin, bovine carbonic anhydrase, β-amylase, hog thyroglobulin, horse ferretin, and bovine catalase, failed to incorporate the probes (not shown). However, the known acceptor (α2-antiplasmin) (33Sakata Y. Aoki N. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and donor (plasminogen) (34Bendixen E. Harpel P.C. Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17929-17933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 35Bendixen E. Borth W. Harpel P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21962-22197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) substrates acted as expected (Fig. 1). Taken together, these experiments suggest that pro-CpU incorporated dansylcadaverine and dansyl-PGGQQIV in a specific manner. Because pro-CpU contains both reactive Gln (amine acceptor) and Lys (amine donor) residues, we tested whether the transglutaminases were able to form inter-pro-CpUN ε(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-links and produce pro-CpU homopolymers. Iodinated pro-CpU was incubated with increasing amounts of tissue transglutaminase or factor XIIIa (not shown), and the reaction products were analyzed by reduced SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The result indicated that transglutaminases catalyzed the formation of high molecular weight polypeptides and thus confirmed that pro-CpU is a substrate for transglutaminases. Significantly, the result also suggests that pro-CpU is capable of forming interN ε(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-links with other proteins. Pro-CpU (1 mg) and tissue transglutaminase or factor XIIIa (100 μg) were incubated in the presence of [14C]putrescine, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The [14C]putrescine labeling was performed under nondenaturing conditions using a low concentration of reducing agent (0.5 mm DTT) to sustain the activity of the transglutaminases. The disulfide integrity was not affected, even by an extended incubation in 0.5 mm DTT, as judged by the inability of pro-CpU to incorporate iodo[14C]acetic acid (data not shown). Following the [14C]putrescine labeling reaction, pro-CpU was reduced and alkylated and digested with trypsin. The peptides were separated by high performance size exclusion chromatography, and pools containing radioactive peptides were further purified by reverse phase HPLC, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified radioactive peptides were characterized by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry (Table I). Two radioactive tryptic peptides were recovered from both the tissue transglutaminase and the factor XIIIa labeling of pro-CpU: Phe1-(Gln2)-Ser-Gly-(Gln5)-Val-Leu-Ala-Ala-Leu-Pro-Arg12and Ala283-Tyr-Ile-Ser-Met-His-Ser-Tyr-Ser-(Gln292)-His-Ile-Val-Phe-Pro-Tyr-Ser-Tyr-Thr-Arg302. The yield of the two peptides (∼4 nmol) suggested that these represent the major amine acceptors. During Edman degradation of the two peptides PTH-Gln2, PTH-Gln5, and PTH-Gln292 were not detected, suggesting that these residues were modified. This conclusion was substantiated by three observations: (i) the PTH-derivatives released during Edman degradation in the positions corresponding to Gln2, Gln5, and Gln292 contained 14C radioactivity; (ii) the retention time of the PTH-derivative eluting in these positions was consistent with the retention time of PTH-Gln-[14C]putrescine (Table I); and (iii) the masses of peptide 1 and peptide 2 are consistent with the [14C]putrescine modification described above (Table I).Table ICharacterization of the major tissue transglutaminase or factor XIIIa catalyzed [14C]putrescine-labeled tryptic peptides by mass spectrometry and Edman degradationPeptideObserved massCalculated massEdman degradation1-aThe numbers in parentheses represent the yields of each PTH-derivative in pmol.

Open table in a new tab Because some of the predicted tryptic peptides were rather large, we performed a second digest using pepsin to generate smaller, more manageable peptides. Pro-CpU and tissue transglutaminase or factor XIIIa were incubated in the presence of [14C]putrescine, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and digested with pepsin. The analysis of these digests resulted in the purification of two major radioactive peptides containing Gln2 and Gln292, as identified in the tryptic digests. In addition, small amounts of [14C]putrescine modified peptides, including Gln16 and Gln81-Gln82-Gln83, were purified from the tissue transglutaminase-catalyzed reaction. The Gln81-Gln82-Gln83-containing peptide was obtained in several cleavage variants due to the low specificity of pepsin, and some of these fragments contained modified Gln81, whereas in others Gln82 or Gln83 was modified. The analysis of several separate [14C]putrescine labeling experiments suggested that Gln2, Gln5, and Gln292 are the major amine acceptor sites in transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking reactions involving pro-CpU. These residues are positioned both in the activation peptide and in the mature enzyme, implying thatN ε(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-links prevent the release of CpU upon activation (see Fig. 4). The biological relevance of the observations described above was investigated by comparing the tissue transglutaminase- or FXIIIa-catalyzed incorporation of pro-CpU and α2-antiplasmin in immobilized fibrin. The cross-linking was examined by incubating iodinated pro-CpU or α2-antiplasmin and increasing amount of transglutaminase in fibrin coated polystyrene tubes. The tubes were washed extensively and the amounts of bound pro-CpU or α2-antiplasmin were estimated by counting the γ-radioactivity associated with the tubes (Fig. 3). The results showed that binding of the two proteins depended on the concentration of the transglutaminases and the availability of Ca2+. Significantly, the amount of cross-linked pro-CpU was comparable to that of α2-antiplasmin, suggesting that the incorporation of pro-CPU is biologically relevant. In this study, we present evidence that pro-CpU is a substrate for transglutaminases and is cross-linked to fibrin during the latter part of the coagulation cascade. Incorporation of dansylcadaverine [14C]putrescine and dansyl-PGGQQIV demonstrates the presence of both amine acceptor and amine donor sites. This observation was substantiated by the formation of transglutaminase induced pro-CpU polymers. We determined the location of the amine acceptor sites to ascertain whether both the zymogen and the mature enzyme participated in the cross-linking reaction. Three major amine acceptor sites, Gln2, Gln5, and Gln292, were preferred by both tissue transglutaminase and factor XIIIa. Some additional minor [14C]putrescine incorporation was observed in Gln16 and Gln81-Gln82-Gln83 after a detailed analysis of the tissue transglutaminase reaction products (see Fig. 4). This incorporation accounted for only a minor fraction of the total incorporated radioactivity and might reflect differences in the substrate requirement of tissue transglutaminase or factor XIIIa. However, the major reactive Gln residues preferred by both transglutaminases were Gln2, Gln5, and Gln292. Two of the major reactive Gln residues are found near the NH2-terminal of pro-CpU. The presence of closely spaced reactive Gln residues is quite common and has been shown in other proteins, including plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (36Jensen P.H. Schuler E. Woodrow G.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4640-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and vitronectin (39Skorstengård K. Halkier T. Højrup P. Mosher D. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is not possible to derive a consensus sequence for the amine acceptor sites in proteins, but it is common that reactive Gln residues are positioned near the NH2 or COOH terminus (40Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Mann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11316-11321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking may influence the biology of pro-CpU in several important ways. Specifically, the reactive Gln residues are located both in the activation peptide and in the mature enzyme, suggesting that CpU remains associated with the matrix after activation. The enzymatic activity of CpU has been reported to be transient in vitro (4Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 41Tan A.K. Eaton D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5811-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) because of a change in the thermodynamic stability after activation (42Boffa M.B. Wang W. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2127-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It is likely that theN ε(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-links and other noncovalent interactions promoted by the cross-linking increase the conformational stability and stabilize the enzymatic activity of CpU. Proteolytic inactivation of CpU is similarly less likely as a result of both increased thermodynamic stability and steric hindrance. These factors may also influence the activation kinetics of pro-CpU. Fibrin functions as a matrix during fibrinolysis and helps confine the activities of the involved proteins to prevent potential damaging effects elsewhere. This is exemplified by the factor XIIIa-catalyzed cross-linking of α2-antiplasmin to fibrin during the final stages of the blood coagulation (33Sakata Y. Aoki N. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 43Sakata Y. Aoki N. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 69: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 44Tamaki T. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14767-14772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, pro-CpU activated outside the immediate vicinity of the clotting/fibrinolysis environment is likely to be bound to α2-macroglobulin or pregnancy zone protein and removed (22Valnickova Z. Thøgersen I.B. Christensen S. Chu C.T. Pizzo S.V. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12937-12943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The fibrin incorporation of α2-antiplasmin is presumably mediated by plasminogen, which has affinity for both fibrin and α2-antiplasmin (45Kluft C. Los P. Jie A.F. Thromb. Res. 1984; 33: 419-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), thus bringing α2-antiplasmin in close proximity to the fibrin. Significantly, plasminogen also has affinity for pro-CpU (1Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is likely that this interaction similarly promotes a factor XIIIa mediated incorporation of pro-CpU in the newly formed fibrin clot. The observations described in this study suggest that transglutaminases may mediate covalent binding of pro-CpU to other proteins and cell surfaces in vivo. In particular, the data suggest that pro-CpU, CpU, or both are incorporated into fibrin during a coagulation event and function in concert with other proteins (e.g.α2-antiplasmin) to prevent premature dissolution of the fibrin clot. This interaction may also have important implications for the pro-CpU activation kinetics and may stabilize CpU after activation. We thank Charles S. Greenberg for the gift of human factor XIIIa and Ida B. Thøgersen for insightful comments on the manuscript."

We have reported that prostaglandins (PG) and cyclic AMP (cAMP) inhibit growth of human HSC. This PG/cAMP pathway transduces the endothelin (ET) B-mediated antiproliferative effect of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and up-regulates ETB receptors.

The two peptides elicit early PGE2 and cAMP synthesis, and also promote delayed induction of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. Both early and delayed production of PGE2 counteract the mitogenic effect of PDGF-BB and thrombin because: (i) pretreatment with the COX inhibitor ibuprofen markedly enhances the mitogenic effect of both peptides; (ii) blocking early synthesis of PGE2 greatly enhances extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation by both growth factors; (iii) enhancement of DNA synthesis by ibuprofen is only lost when the inhibitor is added after COX-2 induction has occurred. Finally, PDGF-BB and thrombin raise ETB receptors through the PG pathway. Thus, ibuprofen blunts growth factor-induced increase in ETB receptors. Up-regulation of the growth inhibitory ETB receptors by both mitogens may enhance the antiproliferative effect of ET-1 and thereby establish a negative feedback of their mitogenic effect.

Expression of PDGF and of its tyrosine kinase receptors is induced during the process of activation, as shown in cirrhotic human liver, in experimental models of liver injury, and in cultured HSC (7Wong L.

Thrombin is also mitogenic for these cells, and myofibroblastic HSC show increased expression of its receptor during liver injury (10Marra F. Defranco R. Rappone C. Milani S. Pinzani M. Pellegrini G.

Given the highly proliferative capacity of myofibroblastic HSC, several studies have focused on factors that may limit their growth (12Mallat A. Preaux A.-M. Blazejewski S. Dhumeaux D. Rosenbaum J.

We and others have recently shown that PGE2 and cAMP inhibit proliferation of human myofibroblastic HSC (15Mallat A. Preaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Gallois C. Brenner D.A. Bradham C.

We also found that binding of endothelin-1 (ET-1) to its ETB receptor stimulates production of prostaglandins that in turn elevate cAMP, resulting in a growth inhibitory effect of the peptide (13Mallat A. Fouassier L. Préaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Rosenbaum J. Dhumeaux D. Jouneaux C. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin.

In addition, PG and cAMP up-regulate ETB receptors, which may amplify the antiproliferative effect of ET-1 (13Mallat A. Fouassier L. Préaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Rosenbaum J.

Although PDGF-BB stimulates cell proliferation by activating key effectors, including ras, raf, and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade (17Malarkey K. Belham C.M. Paul A.

Thrombin inhibits adenylyl cyclase in most cells, but increases in cAMP production have also been reported in a few instances (23Pouyssegur J. Seuwen K. Annu. Rev.

In the present study, we have used a model of cultured human myofibroblastic HSC that displays the phenotypic and functional characteristics of HSC found in situ during hepatic fibrogenesis. (26Win K.M. Charlotte F. Mallat A. Cherqui D. Martin N. Mavier P. Préaux A.M. Dhumeaux D. Rosenbaum J. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We show that, in myofibroblastic HSC, thrombin and PDGF-BB evoke a growth inhibitory PG/cAMP signal that reduces their promitogenic effects by (i) counteracting the transduction pathway stimulated by mitogenic signals and (ii) increasing the density of growth inhibitory ETB receptors. ET-1 was from Novabiochem (France), PDGF-BB from Life Technology (United Kingdom), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) from Preprotech, and human thrombin from Sigma (France). Forskolin and ibuprofen were obtained from Sigma (France) and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and ethanol, respectively. [methyl-3H]Thymidine (25 Ci/mmol),125I-endothelin-1, [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 Ci/mmol), and LM1 emulsion were from Amersham (France). Fetal calf serum was from JBio Laboratories (France). Pooled human AB positive serum was supplied by the National Transfusion Center (France). Human HSC were obtained in their activated phenotype by outgrowth from explants of normal liver obtained following surgery of benign or malignant liver tumors. This procedure is in accordance with ethical regulations imposed by the French legislation. Explants were incubated, as described previously, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum (5% fetal calf serum, 5% pooled human serum) (26Win K.M. Charlotte F. Mallat A. Cherqui D. Martin N. Mavier P. Préaux A.M. Dhumeaux D. Rosenbaum J. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Exhaustive characterization of these cells has already been published (26Win K.M. Charlotte F. Mallat A. Cherqui D. Martin N. Mavier P. Préaux A.M. Dhumeaux D. Rosenbaum J. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Cell isolates were routinely characterized by a positive staining for smooth muscle α-actin, a marker of HSC in their myofibroblastic phenotype. Experiments were performed between passages 3 and 8 without any noticeable difference in results observed with cells obtained from various passages, or from various livers. All experiments were performed on confluent cells made quiescent in serum-free Waymouth medium over 3 days. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates, grown to confluence, and deprived of serum for 48 h in Waymouth medium. Following preincubation with 0.6 mm isobutylmethylxanthine for 15 min, HSC were stimulated in phosphate-buffered saline with effectors. When indicated, cells were preincubated for 30 min with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen (50 μm) or vehicle (ethanol). Assays were performed in duplicate. cAMP was extracted in 95% ethanol for 2 h at 25 °C, and extracts were stored at −80 °C, pending assay (15Mallat A. Preaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Gallois C. Brenner D.A. Bradham C. Maclouf J. Iourgenko V. Fouassier L. Dhumeaux D. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). cAMP was assayed by a commercial radioimmunoassay (Immunotech, France). Confluent monolayers in 24-well plates were deprived of serum for 48 h, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and further incubated in Waymouth medium. Following pretreatment with ibuprofen 50 μm or vehicle, cells were stimulated with growth factors as indicated, over various periods of time. Release of PGE2 was assayed by a specific enzyme immunoassay, as described previously (27Pradelles P. Grassi J. Maclouf J. Anal. Chem. 1985; 57: 1170-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis was measured in triplicate wells by incorporation of [3H]thymidine, as described previously (14Mallat A. Préaux A.-M. Blazejewski S. Rosenbaum J. Dhumeaux D. Mavier P. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent HSC were made quiescent by incubation in Waymouth medium without serum for 48 h. Cells were then stimulated for 30 h with growth factors, following pretreatment for 30 min with ibuprofen (50 μm) or vehicle. [3H]Thymidine (0.5 μCi/well) was added during the last 6 h of incubation. Thymidine incorporation was also assessed by nuclear autoradiography (12Mallat A. Preaux A.-M. Blazejewski S. Dhumeaux D. Rosenbaum J. Mavier P. Hepatology. 1994; 20: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent quiescent HSC in 35-mm plates were stimulated for 30 h with growth factors following treatment with ibuprofen or its vehicle. [3H]Thymidine (2 μCi/ml) was added during the last 6 h of incubation. Cultures were washed in PBS, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and dehydrated with 100% methanol. They were covered with LM1 emulsion (Amersham, France) and exposed for 3 days. Labeling was developed with Kodak Dektol developer and fixed with Kodak Unifix. Cells were counterstained in eosin and hemalun. Results were expressed as the ratio of nuclei with overlapping silver grains to the total number of nuclei. Data from 5 to 10 random low magnification fields per culture were averaged. Confluent cells in 60-mm wells were deprived of serum for 48 h and further stimulated with growth factors following preincubation with ibuprofen (50 μm, 30 min) or vehicle (ethanol). The reaction was terminated by washing the cell cultures twice with 6 ml of ice-chilled PBS. Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 0.3 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml pepstatin, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 10 mmparanitrophenylphosphate. Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatants were either used directly, or frozen at −70 °C. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity was assayed in situ following electrophoresis of equal amounts of cell lysates (40 μg of proteins), on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel copolymerized with 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein, as described previously (13Mallat A. Fouassier L. Préaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Rosenbaum J. Dhumeaux D. Jouneaux C. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated gels were exposed to x-ray films, and ERK activity was quantified by using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, France). Confluent HSC in 12-well plates were made quiescent in serum-free Waymouth medium over 3 days. HSC were then incubated for various periods of time with either 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB, 5 units/ml thrombin, 200 ng/ml IGF-1, or vehicle. After a wash in ice-cold PBS, cells were lysed for 15 min at 4 °C in whole cell extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, pH 8, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants (whole cell extract) were stored at −80 °C until use. After electrophoresis on a denaturing SDS gel, proteins (20 μg/lane) were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% skimmed milk. Detection of COX-1 (28Creminon C. Frobert Y. Habib A. Maclouf J. Pradelles P. Grassi J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and COX-2 (29Habib A. Creminon C. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Pradelles P. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23448-23454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was performed after incubation for 2 h at room temperature with their specific antibody diluted 1:2000- and 1:5000-fold, respectively. After 1 h of incubation with 2000-fold diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antibody and extensive washings, immunodetected proteins were visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) assay kit (Amersham) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Confluent monolayers were deprived of serum for 48 h and subsequently stimulated with growth factors, following pretreatment with 50 μm ibuprofen or vehicle (ethanol). A particulate fraction was obtained (13Mallat A. Fouassier L. Préaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Rosenbaum J. Dhumeaux D. Jouneaux C. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and binding of 125I-ET-1 was measured as described previously (30Jouneaux C. Mallat A. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Goldsmith P. Hanoune J. Lotersztajn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1845-1851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the HSC particulate fraction (5–10 μg of proteins) was incubated for 90 min at 22 °C in 200 μl of Krebs-Ringer medium containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 300 μg/ml bacitracin, with either 50 pm125I-ET-1 and varying concentrations of cold ET-1, sarafotoxin S6C or BQ123 (competition experiments), or varying concentrations of 125I-ET-1 (4.5–800 pm, saturation experiments). Nonspecific binding was determined by incubating with 0.1 μm unlabeled ET-1. Data from saturation and competition experiments were analyzed using the nonlinear regression program LIGAND. Protein concentration was measured using a commercial reagent (Bio-Rad, France) Results were analyzed by 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measurements, Wilkoxon's signed rank test, or unpaired Student's t test, as appropriate. Treatment of human myofibroblastic HSC with mitogenic concentrations of thrombin and PDGF-BB increased the production of PGE2 (Fig. 1 A). Prostaglandin E2 synthesis increased within 2 min in the presence of thrombin and was maximally elevated by 4-fold over basal after 5 min. The time course of the effect of PDGF-BB on PGE2 release was slightly delayed, rising after 5 min and reaching a maximal 4-fold increase over basal at 30 min. The COX inhibitor ibuprofen blunted the elevation of PGE2 production elicited by PDGF-BB and thrombin. Both PDGF-BB and thrombin also stimulated cAMP production (Fig. 1 B). In the presence of thrombin, cAMP concentration rose within 1 min, maximally increased to 7–10-fold by 2 min, and rapidly declined after 10 min. Following PDGF-BB treatment, cAMP increased by 5-fold within 10 min and decreased gradually thereafter. Thrombin and PDGF-BB increased cAMP through prostaglandin production because ibuprofen blunted the enhancement of cAMP production elicited by both peptides (Fig. 1 C). Similar results were obtained when cells were stimulated with 5% human serum instead of purified growth factors (not shown). In contrast, IGF-1 at a concentration mitogenic for HSC (100 ng/ml) (Fig. 3), did not affect either PGE2 or cAMP levels (Fig. 1, A and B). Ibuprofen also decreased basal cAMP levels from 330 to 60 fmol/mg protein by blocking endogenous synthesis of PG (Fig. 1 C).Figure 3Ibuprofen synergistically enhances the mitogenic effect of PDGF-BB and thrombin but not that of IGF-1. A–C, effect of ibuprofen on [3H]thymidine incorporation in response to PDGF-BB (A), thrombin (B), or IGF-1 (C). Confluent quiescent cells were pretreated for 30 min with 50 μm ibuprofen or its vehicle and stimulated with varying concentrations of PDGF-BB (A), thrombin (B), or IGF-1 (C). [3H]Thymidine incorporation into DNA was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are the mean ± S.E. of five experiments and are expressed as -fold over basal levels measured in the absence of ibuprofen. D, nuclear autoradiography. Confluent quiescent cells were treated in the same conditions as above, with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB, 5 units/ml thrombin or 100 ng/ml IGF-1. The number of replicative cells was assessed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shown is a typical experiment repeated twice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, these results indicate that PDGF-BB and thrombin, but not IGF-1, stimulate synthesis and secretion of PGE2 (Fig. 1), a prostaglandin which increases cAMP production in an autocrine fashion (15Mallat A. Preaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Gallois C. Brenner D.A. Bradham C. Maclouf J. Iourgenko V. Fouassier L. Dhumeaux D. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as PGE2 and cAMP inhibit growth factor-stimulated proliferation of myofibroblastic HSC (Fig. 1 B, inset; Ref. 15Mallat A. Preaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Gallois C. Brenner D.A. Bradham C. Maclouf J. Iourgenko V. Fouassier L. Dhumeaux D. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), our results indicate that both PDGF-BB and thrombin, although mitogenic for HSC, generate second messengers that are growth inhibitory for these cells. The following experiments were undertaken to assess the consequences of the stimulation of the PG/cAMP pathway on the mitogenic properties of PDGF-BB and thrombin. Therefore, DNA synthesis and ERK activation were assayed following blockade of this pathway by the COX inhibitor ibuprofen. It is well established that activation of ERK by growth factors is an important early step preceding cell proliferation (17Malarkey K. Belham C.M. Paul A. Graham A. McLees A. Scott P.H. Plevin R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 361-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 31Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). PDGF-BB rapidly stimulated ERK, inducing a maximal activation within 5 to 10 min, followed by a decrease to a sustained level for at least 1 h (Fig. 2 A). Stimulation of ERK by thrombin showed a peak at 5–10 min and returned to basal levels within 1 h (Fig. 2 B). Pretreatment of cells with ibuprofen pretreatment markedly potentiated the activation profile of ERK by PDGF-BB or thrombin. In the presence of the COX inhibitor, peak activation of ERK by PDGF-BB was achieved after 10 min. The compound did not affect stimulation of ERK by PDGF-BB at early time points but synergistically enhanced ERK activation from 10 min onward (Fig. 2 A). Activation of ERK by thrombin was also markedly potentiated by ibuprofen, although as early as 5 min (Fig. 2 B). Finally, the COX inhibitor moderately enhanced basal ERK activity, by preventing endogenous release of PG. It should be noted that PDGF-BB has a delayed effect on PGE2 and cAMP synthesis, as compared with thrombin (Fig. 1). This time frame is in keeping with the potentiating effect of ibuprofen on ERK activation by PDGF-BB and thrombin (Fig. 2). Ibuprofen pretreatment synergistically enhanced the mitogenic effects of thrombin and PDGF-BB at all concentrations tested (Fig. 3, A and B). The COX inhibitor increased basal DNA synthesis by 2-fold. In contrast, ibuprofen pretreatment maximally increased DNA synthesis of PDGF-BB-treated cells by 10–11-fold, as compared with the 4-fold increase in cells exposed to PDGF-BB alone (p < 0.001 by 2-way ANOVA). Thrombin alone caused a 2-fold increase of thymidine incorporation, which rose to 7-fold following ibuprofen pretreatment (p < 0.001 by 2-way ANOVA). Similar results were obtained when cells were stimulated with 5% human serum instead of purified growth factors (not shown). As expected, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor did not potentiate the effect of IGF-1 on DNA synthesis (Fig. 3 C). The synergistic effect of ibuprofen on PDGF-BB or thrombin-induced mitogenesis was confirmed by nuclear autoradiography experiments (Fig. 3 D). Altogether, these data indicate that in myofibroblastic HSC, PDGF-BB and thrombin stimulate a PG/cAMP pathway that reduces activation of ERK and decreases their effects on cell proliferation. The role of the PG/cAMP pathway was further supported by experiments in which ibuprofen was added at various times before or after the introduction of growth factors. As shown above, introduction of ibuprofen 30 min before the addition of thrombin (−30 min) maximally enhanced the mitogenic effect of the peptide (Fig. 4 A). Addition of ibuprofen 30 min after that of thrombin (+30 min) also synergistically enhanced its mitogenic effect although to a lower extent (5-fold at +30 min, as compared with 9.5-fold at −30 min, p < 0.001 by 2-way ANOVA). The potentiating effect of ibuprofen was no longer observed when the compound was added 6 h after thrombin. Similar results were obtained when cells were stimulated with PDGF-BB instead of thrombin (Fig. 4 B). These data indicate that growth factors stimulate early as well as late production of PGE2. Late synthesis of PGE2 could be demonstrated by studying the regulation of inducible type 2 cyclooxygenase (COX-2) expression. As shown in Fig. 5, a 6-h treatment with PDGF-BB and thrombin up-regulated COX-2 expression, whereas IGF-1 had no effect. In contrast, PDGF-BB and thrombin did not alter COX-1 protein expression (Fig. 5). Altogether, these results show that both early and late production of prostaglandins account for the negative regulation of the mitogenic effect of PDGF-BB and thrombin. We have previously shown, that binding of ET-1 to its ETB receptors inhibits proliferation of human HSC, and that exogenously applied PGE2 and/or cAMP up-regulate ETB receptors (Refs. 13Mallat A. Fouassier L. Préaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Rosenbaum J. Dhumeaux D. Jouneaux C. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar and 15Mallat A. Preaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Gallois C. Brenner D.A. Bradham C. Maclouf J. Iourgenko V. Fouassier L. Dhumeaux D. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar; Fig. 7). Therefore, we investigated whether PDGF-BB and thrombin may increase the growth inhibitory ETB receptors via the PG/cAMP pathway. Treatment of HSC for 24 h with PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (5 units/ml) increased ET-1 binding sites by 2.2- and 1.5-fold, respectively, whereas IGF-1 had no effect (Fig. 6). There was no significant change in the K d with either peptide (not shown). The increase in ET receptors was time-dependent. In PDGF-BB-treated cells, the number of receptors rose by 2.2-fold within 14 h and remained elevated until 24 h (Fig. 6 A). In thrombin-treated cells, a maximal 1.5-fold increase was found after 3 h, which was unchanged over 24 h (Fig. 6 B). We also assessed the effect of PDGF-BB and thrombin on the distribution of ETA and ETB receptors. In control cells, ETA and ETB receptors were present in a proportion of 55:45. Growth factors did not modify the proportion of ET receptors (50:50), so that both ETA and ETB receptors were up-regulated by 2.2- and 1.5-fold in PDGF-BB and thrombin-treated cells, respectively (Fig. 7). We next examined the role of the PG pathway in the regulation of ET receptors. In unstimulated cells, ibuprofen alone did not affect the number of ETA receptors (control: 211 fmol/mg protein; ibuprofen: 191 fmol/mg protein) but selectively down-regulated ETB receptors by 50% (from 180 fmol/mg protein in control cells to 90 fmol/mg protein in ibuprofen-pretreated cells) by preventing endogenous PG release. Up-regulation of ETA receptors by PDGF-BB and thrombin was not modified following ibuprofen pretreatment (2.0- and 1.5-fold, respectively) (Fig. 7). In contrast, ibuprofen totally down-regulated ETB receptors in PDGF-BB and thrombin-treated cells (Fig. 7). Collectively, these results indicate that PDGF-BB and thrombin increase both ETA and ETB receptors in myofibroblastic HSC. However, blockade of the PG/cAMP pathway specifically blunts the up-regulation of ETB receptors by both peptides. In the present study, we demonstrate that in human myofibroblastic HSC, PDGF-BB, and thrombin generate growth inhibitory signals by stimulating a PG/cAMP pathway. Activation of this signal counteracts their mitogenic effects by blocking the transduction pathway leading to HSC proliferation and by up-regulating ETB receptors for the growth inhibitory peptide ET-1 (13Mallat A. Fouassier L. Préaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Rosenbaum J. Dhumeaux D. Jouneaux C. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Binding of PDGF-BB to its tyrosine kinase receptor and of thrombin to its G protein-coupled receptor stimulate proliferation of a number of cells, including myofibroblastic HSC (17Malarkey K. Belham C.M. Paul A. Graham A. McLees A. Scott P.H. Plevin R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 361-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 23Pouyssegur J. Seuwen K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A striking point of the present study is that, although mitogenic, PDGF-BB and thrombin also generate growth inhibitory PGE2 in human myofibroblastic HSC (15Mallat A. Preaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Gallois C. Brenner D.A. Bradham C. Maclouf J. Iourgenko V. Fouassier L. Dhumeaux D. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The two peptides elicit early PGE2 production by activating basal COX, resulting in cAMP accumulation (Fig. 1), and also promote delayed induction of COX-2. Both early and delayed production of PGE2 negatively regulate the mitogenic effect of PDGF-BB and thrombin. The role of the early synthesis of PGE2 is demonstrated by two lines of evidence: (i) addition of ibuprofen after the occurrence of the early release of PGE2 (+30 min, see Fig. 4) reduces the potentiating effect of the COX inhibitor on DNA synthesis; and (ii) ibuprofen pretreatment enhances ERK activation by both growth factors within minutes (Fig. 2). The growth inhibitory signal evoked by PDGF-BB and thrombin also involves delayed induction of COX-2 expression; thus, the potentiating effect of ibuprofen on DNA synthesis is suppressed only when the COX inhibitor is added after induction of COX-2 by both peptides has occurred (Fig. 4). In agreement with these data, we recently observed that induction of COX-2 is involved in the antiproliferative effect of ET-1 and TNF-α in human myofibroblastic HSC. 2Gallois, C., Habib, A., Tao, J., Maclouf, J., Mallat, A., and Lotersztajn, S. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 23183–23190 We conclude that the mitogenic effects of PDGF-BB and thrombin result from simultaneous stimulatory and inhibitory signals: a growth enhancing pathway, involving activation of ERK; and a growth inhibitory signal mediated by a PG/cAMP pathway, which reduces the mitogenic effect of both growth factors. It should be noted that activation of the PG/cAMP pathway is not a general feature of tyrosine kinase receptor activation. Thus, IGF-1 does not enhance early production of PGE2 and cAMP, either in human HSC (Fig. 1) or in human vascular smooth muscle cells (18Graves L.M. Bornfeldt K.E. Sidhu J.S. Argast G.M. Raines E.W. Ross R. Leslie C.C. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); neither does IGF-1 affect COX-2 protein expression (Fig. 5). In keeping with our results, recent studies provide evidence that growth factors may positively and negatively regulate cell proliferation, via PG and/or cAMP. In COS-7 cells, isoproterenol raises cAMP and ERK activity, and activation of ERK by isoproterenol is enhanced when blocking the cAMP pathway (32Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In human vascular smooth muscle cells, PDGF-BB is mitogenic but also stimulates synthesis of growth inhibitory PG (18Graves L.M. Bornfeldt K.E. Sidhu J.S. Argast G.M. Raines E.W. Ross R. Leslie C.C. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 33Bornfeldt K.E. Campbell J.S. Koyama H. Argast G.M. Leslie C.C. Raines E.W. Krebs E.G. Ross R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Finally, in human fetal lung fibroblasts, indomethacin supresses the antiproliferative effect of TGFβ and restores its mitogenic effect (34McAnulty R. Hernandez-Rodriguez N.A. Mutesaers S.E. Coker R.K. Laurent G.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These observations, together with the results of the present study, strongly suggest that a PG and/or cAMP pathway negatively regulates the mitogenic effects of certain growth factors. Interestingly, in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, PDGF-BB activates SIRPα1 proteins, which in turn counteract the mitogenic effect of the peptide (35Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Whether PG and cAMP may activate SIRPα1 proteins in human HSC remains to be determined. We have previously shown that ET-1 inhibits proliferation of human myofibroblastic HSC via its ETB receptors. The present study demonstrates that the PG pathway activated by PDGF-BB and thrombin up-regulates ETB receptors. Thus, both growth factors raise the number of ETB binding sites, and ibuprofen blunts this increase. These results are in line with our previous finding that exogenously added PGE2 and PGI2 up-regulate ETB receptors in these cells (15Mallat A. Preaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Gallois C. Brenner D.A. Bradham C. Maclouf J. Iourgenko V. Fouassier L. Dhumeaux D. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In contrast, IGF-1 does not affect COX-2 protein expression and prostaglandin production and has no effect on the number of ETB receptors. These results clearly establish that PG production plays a central role in the regulation of ETB receptors in human myofibroblastic HSC. Up-regulation of growth inhibitory receptors by mitogens is an important step in the negative control of cell proliferation (36Vidal C. Rauly I. Zeggari M., N., D. Esteve J.-P. Saint-Laurent N. Vaysse N. Susini C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 97-104Google Scholar). For instance, epidermal growth factor up-regulates somatostatin receptors and enhances the antiproliferative of somatostatin in pancreatic cancer cells (36Vidal C. Rauly I. Zeggari M., N., D. Esteve J.-P. Saint-Laurent N. Vaysse N. Susini C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 97-104Google Scholar). Also, transforming growth factor β inhibits proliferation of rat HSC and decreases PDGF receptors (37Davis B.H. Rapp U.R. Davidson N.O. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, it may be suggested that up-regulation of ETB receptors by PDGF-BB and thrombin enhances the antiproliferative effect of ET-1 and thereby establishes a negative feedback of their promitogenic effect. Along this line, it should be noted that PDGF-BB and thrombin stimulate secretion of ET-1 in a number of cells, including human HSC, and that expression of ET-1 is markedly increased in the liver during chronic liver diseases (38Pinzani M. Milani S. De Franco R. Grappone C. Caligiuri A. Gentilini A. Tosti-Guerra C. Maggi M. Failli P. Ruocco C. Gentilini P. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 534-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Besides ETB receptors, human myofibroblastic HSC also express ETA receptors, which mediate the contractile effect of ET-1 (13Mallat A. Fouassier L. Préaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Rosenbaum J. Dhumeaux D. Jouneaux C. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 39Mallat A. Lotersztajn S. J. Hepatol. 1996; 25: 405-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PDGF-BB and thrombin increase ETA binding sites by a mechanism unrelated to PG production. Interestingly, thrombin enhances contractility of myofibroblastic HSC (40Pinzani M. Failli P. Ruocco C. Casini A. Milani S. Baldi E. Giotti A. Gentilini P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In this respect, besides its direct contractile effect, the peptide may also indirectly increase HSC contraction by enhancing the effect of ET-1 following up-regulation of ETA receptors. In experimental models of liver injury and in human chronic liver disease, myofibroblastic HSC proliferate and accumulate in response to cytokines and growth factors produced locally (1Friedman S.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Accordingly, PDGF expression is increased in infiltrating inflammatory cells and within fibrous septa and several lines of evidence suggest that thrombin is also generated in response to liver injury (8Pinzani M. Milani S. Grappone C. Weber Jr., F.L. Gentilini P. Abboud H.E. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 9Pinzani M. Milani S. Herbst H. DeFranco R. Grappone C.

Pellegrini G. Laffi G. Gentilini P. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 462-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Moreover, myofibroblastic HSC show increased levels of PDGF and thrombin receptors during liver injury, and expression of the PDGF receptor has been correlated to the activity of the fibroproliferative process (8Pinzani M. Milani S. Grappone C. Weber Jr., F.L. Gentilini P. Abboud H.E. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 9Pinzani M. Milani S. Herbst H. DeFranco R. Grappone C.

Pellegrini G. Laffi G. Gentilini P. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 462-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Several studies have focused on the molecular mechanisms responsible for the growth-enhancing effects of PDGF-BB and thrombin in human myofibroblastic HSC. Our findings shed light on novel growth inhibitory pathways evoked by these peptides. We show that, in fact, the mitogenic effect of PDGF-BB and thrombin arises from the combined effect of positive and negative signals, the latter transduced by PG and cAMP. The promitogenic signal is counteracted by two PG-dependent mechanisms: (i) a direct negative pathway that inhibits ERK activation and more delayed events involved in proliferation; and (ii) an indirect feedback that may amplify the antiproliferative effect of ET-1 by up-regulating ETB receptors. Our results may have implications for the comprehension of the physiopathology of liver fibrosis. They suggest that the final proliferative response depends on the balance of conflicting positive and negative signals elicited simultaneously by a single growth factor. Further studies are needed to better understand factors that may shift the balance toward growth inhibition and thereby limit proliferation of myofibroblastic HSC during chronic liver disease.

https://openalex.org/W2049003919,"Previous studies of (InsP3)-evoked elementary Ca2+ events suggested a hierarchy of signals; fundamental events (“Ca2+ blips”) arising from single InsP3receptors (InsP3Rs), and intermediate events (“Ca2+ puffs”) reflecting the coordinated opening of a cluster of InsP3Rs. The characteristics of such elementary Ca2+ release signals provide insights into the functional interaction and distribution of InsP3Rs in living cells. Therefore we investigated whether elementary Ca2+ signaling is truly represented by such stereotypic release events. A histogram of >900 events revealed a wide spread of signal amplitudes (20–600 nm; mean 216 ± 4 nm; n = 206 cells), which cannot be explained by stochastic variation of a stereotypic Ca2+ release site. We identified elementary Ca2+ release sites with consistent amplitudes (<20% difference) and locations with variable amplitudes (∼500% difference). Importantly, within single cells, distinct sites displayed events with significantly different mean amplitudes. Additional determinants affecting the magnitude of elementary Ca2+release were identified to be (i) hormone concentration, (ii) day-to-day variability, and (iii) a progressively decreasing Ca2+ release during prolonged stimulation. We therefore suggest that elementary Ca2+ events are not stereotypic, instead a continuum of signals can be achieved by either recruitment of entire clusters with different numbers of InsP3Rs or by a graded recruitment of InsP3Rs within a cluster.

Global Ca2+ signals in intact cells can display spatially and temporally complex patterns such as waves and oscillations (1Lechleiter J. Girard S. Clapham D. Peralta E.

Previous studies have shown that such complex signals are due to the coordinated recruitment of elementary Ca2+ release units (for reviews see Refs. 6Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J.

Examples of signals arising from such elementary Ca2+release units are the “Ca2+ sparks” in cardiac muscle cells (8Cheng H. Lederer W.J. Cannell M.B. Science. 1993; 262: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar, 9Lipp P. Niggli E. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 979-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10López-López J.R. Shacklock P.S.

(Lond.). 1995; 482: 533-553Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar), PC12 cells (12Reber B.F. X Schindleholz A. Pflügers Arch. 1996; 432: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), HeLa cells (13Bootman M.D. Niggli E. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. J. Physiol.

Elementary Ca2+ release events are short duration highly localized signals (6Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 7Lipp P. Niggli E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 265-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that dissipate rapidly due to diffusion into the cytoplasm and sequestration into the intracellular stores. Unless these Ca2+ release units become functionally coupled, such elementary signals remain spatially restricted. We previously described that elementary events, such as Ca2+ puffs, were responsible for both the initiation and propagation of global Ca2+ waves in HeLa cells (13Bootman M.D. Niggli E. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 307-314Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 15Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Cell. 1997; 91: 367-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and that they can be used to specifically elevate nuclear Ca2+(16Lipp P. Thomas D. Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7166-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, although the role of these elementary events in generating global and local Ca2+ signals is becoming clear, molecular information concerning the distribution and structure of the Ca2+ channels (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors; InsP3Rs),1 which underlie these events, is not available. In a previous study, we analyzed the characteristics of agonist-stimulated elementary Ca2+ signals in HeLa cells and found two types of events, which differed in amplitude and kinetics (13Bootman M.D. Niggli E. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 307-314Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar). For the smallest signals (amplitude ∼30 nm; lifetime <500 ms; spatial spreading <2 μm) we estimated an underlying ionic current close to that of a single InsP3R (∼1 pA) and therefore considered such signals to be fundamental signals arising from the opening of a single channel. Events with ∼25-fold larger ionic currents (amplitude ∼150 nm; lifetime ∼1 s; spatial spreading ∼4–7 μm) were also observed and were suggested to reflect the opening of a cluster of InsP3Rs. Similar activities have been observed in Xenopus oocytes by Parker and colleagues (11Yao Y. Choi J. Parker I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 482: 533-553Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 17Parker I. Yao Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 491: 663-668Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and were denoted “Ca2+ blips” and “Ca2+ puffs” for the small and larger events, respectively. Earlier analysis of elementary Ca2+ signals in HeLa cells and Xenopus oocytes suggested that, with very few exceptions, they could be ascribed to either Ca2+ blips or puffs. These data supported the idea of a 3-tier hierarchy of InsP3-evoked events, ranging from the fundamental blips to intermediary puffs and ultimately global Ca2+ waves (7Lipp P. Niggli E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 265-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 13Bootman M.D. Niggli E. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 307-314Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar,18Parker I. Choi J. Yao Y. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The generation of such stereotypic elementary events places considerable constraints on the subcellular localization and operation of InsP3Rs because they must exist either in functional isolation for Ca2+ blips or in clusters containing a fixed number of receptors for Ca2+ puffs. In addition, the channels would need to display a very narrow spectrum of mean open times. In the present study, we investigated the properties of a large population of individual Ca2+ release sites to address the notion of a 3-tier Ca2+ signaling hierarchy. This analysis revealed that rather than existing as discrete stereotypic activities, the events comprise a continuum of amplitudes and lifetimes. Individual elementary Ca2+ release sites produced events with different average amplitudes and frequently altered their magnitude of Ca2+ release from event to event. Furthermore, the amount of Ca2+ released was clearly sensitive to the stimulation strength (i.e. the histamine concentration) and displayed a partial desensitization during prolonged stimulation. Our data are consistent with a scheme where InsP3Rs exist in clusters containing variable numbers of channels and that within such clusters any number of channels can be recruited. HeLa cell culture and preparation for imaging was performed as described previously (13Bootman M.D. Niggli E. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 307-314Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 19Bootman M.D. Taylor C.W. Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25113-25119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The culture medium was replaced with an extracellular medium containing (mm): NaCl, 121; KCl, 5.4; MgCl2, 0.8; CaCl2, 1.8; NaHCO3, 6; glucose, 5.5; HEPES, 25; pH 7.3. Cells were loaded with fluo-3 by incubation with 2 μm fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes) for 30 min, followed by a 30-min de-esterification period. All incubations and experiments were carried out at room temperature (20–22 °C). Confocal cell imaging was performed as described elsewhere (15Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Cell. 1997; 91: 367-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Briefly, a single glass coverslip was mounted on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope attached to a Noran Odyssey or Oz laser-scanning confocal microscope, equipped with a standard argon-ion laser for illumination. Fluo-3 was excited using the 488 nm laser line, and the emitted fluorescence was collected at wavelengths >505 nm. Images were acquired using the confocal microscopes in image mode at frequencies between 7.5 and 30 Hz. Offline analysis of the confocal data was performed using a modified version of NIH Image. Absolute values for Ca2+i were calculated according to the equation [Ca2+] =K d((f − f min)/(f max − f)).f min and f max were determined by permeabilizing the cells with A23187 in the presence of 10 mm EGTA or 10 mm CaCl2, respectively. The K d of fluo-3 for Ca2+inside HeLa cells was determined empirically to be 810 nm(20Tovey S.C. Thomas D. Lipp P. Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 509: 200PGoogle Scholar). Histamine solutions were applied using a homemade solenoid-controlled perfusion system (dead time < 0.5 s). Global Ca2+ waves are often preceded by a shallow “pacemaker” Ca2+i rise (21Jacob R. Merritt J.E. Hallam T.J. Rink T.J. Nature. 1988; 335: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 22Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 855-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that during hormone stimulation this phase is distinguished by the activity of localized Ca2+release (i.e. Ca2+ puffs) (13Bootman M.D. Niggli E. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 307-314Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Increases in the frequency or amplitude of such elementary events, or spatial recruitment of additional Ca2+ puff sites, are necessary to overwhelm cellular Ca2+ buffering and eventually to trigger a regenerative Ca2+ wave (15Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Cell. 1997; 91: 367-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). A typical response pattern is illustrated in Fig. 1. Two independent elementary Ca2+ release sites were seen to be active before the onset of the global response (regions 1 and 2 in Fig. 1). In this example, the regenerative global Ca2+i signal was triggered by an increase in the frequency of the events, as can be seen by the rapid firing of the Ca2+ puffs just prior to the wave. The two elementary Ca2+ release sites within the cell illustrated in Fig. 1 produced Ca2+ puffs with little variation between events, consistent with the notion of stereotypic elementary events. However, in contrast to the similarity of these events, we have frequently observed more variable responses from single elementary Ca2+ release sites, as shown in Fig. 2 A. The Ca2+ puff site depicted in Fig. 2 A displayed multiple events during stimulation of the cell with histamine, but the events differed considerably in both amplitude and duration. The level of stimulation of the cell was sufficient to trigger a train of elementary Ca2+ signals, but not to evoke a global response. However, the variability of the Ca2+ puffs shown in Fig. 2 A was not simply a consequence of a sub-threshold agonist concentration because events with a more consistent amplitude could be evoked by the same nonregenerative stimulus in a different cell (Fig. 2 B). These data present opposing information concerning the functioning of elementary Ca2+ release sites; at one site the Ca2+ puffs appeared to vary widely from event to event (Fig. 2 A), while other sites gave rise to stereotypical signals (Figs. 1 and 2 B). To understand which of these patterns of response represented the most common situation and whether the elementary Ca2+ signals in HeLa cells were actually stereotypical and could be ascribed to a 3-tier hierarchy, we compared the characteristics of Ca2+ puffs between and within individual cells. Examples of the spatial and temporal profiles of elementary Ca2+ signals observed in different cells are shown in Fig. 3 A. Although the cells were stimulated with the same histamine concentration, a different pattern of response was seen in each cell (Fig. 3 A) probably due to the differential sensitivity of the cells to histamine. There was significant variation of the Ca2+ puff characteristics between cells. The smallest signals (Fig. 3 A, a) were similar to the previously described Ca2+ blips (13Bootman M.D. Niggli E. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 307-314Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 17Parker I. Yao Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 491: 663-668Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar), while the intermediate signals (Fig. 3 A, b) approximated previous descriptions of Ca2+ puffs (11Yao Y. Choi J. Parker I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 482: 533-553Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 13Bootman M.D. Niggli E. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 307-314Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The largest signal (Fig. 3 A, c) was >2-fold greater than the Ca2+ puffs we had previously characterized. Repetitive stimulation of the cells evoked similar responses (data not shown). The histogram of 958 Ca2+ puffs from 206 different cells (Fig. 3 B) shows that rather than displaying discrete steps, the events appear to have a broad range of amplitudes from ∼15 to >600 nm (mean 216 ± 4 nm; mode = 120; events above 600 nm are not shown). These data are more consistent with the notion of a continuum of Ca2+ puff amplitudes rather than a hierarchy of discrete amplitudes. The continuum of amplitudes was not due to the inclusion of out of focus events, since only those signals that peaked within 3 frames (133 ms per frame) were included in the plot. Importantly, there was no significant difference between the average amplitude of events that peaked in 1, 2, or 3 frames (Fig. 3 B, inset). The histogram in Fig. 3 B therefore represents the amplitude of events that were similarly in focus. In addition to a wide distribution of Ca2+ puff amplitudes, considerable variation was also observed in their lifetimes (full-width at half-maximal amplitude; FWHM, Fig. 3 C, a). Such a spread of lifetimes would be expected for Ca2+ puffs that differed in amplitude, since a high amplitude signal should have a longer lifetime than a lesser signal, providing the Ca2+ buffering and sequestration mechanisms were equal for both events. We did observe such a relationship between amplitude and duration (Fig. 3 C, b), although the correlation was not high (r 2 = 0.69); some high amplitude Ca2+ puffs displayed a more rapid recovery than lower amplitude signals. We sought to understand the molecular basis for the continuum of Ca2+puff amplitudes presented in Fig. 3 B, by investigating the activity of individual release sites in more detail. Our analysis revealed that the patterns of response illustrated in Fig. 2,A and B, i.e. similar- or variable-amplitude events at a single site, were observed with an approximately equal frequency. Some sites displayed an ∼5-fold spread of amplitudes (e.g. sites 1 and 5 in Fig. 4) while others displayed events with an ∼0.2-fold spread (e.g. sites 2, 4, and 6 in Fig. 4). There was no correlation between the average amplitude and the spread of the amplitudes for individual Ca2+ puff sites. For example, sites 1 and 5 both showed an ∼5-fold spreading but had different average amplitudes. The data presented in Fig. 4 demonstrate a clear variability of Ca2+ puff sites both in mean amplitude and spread of amplitudes. However, since the events plotted in Fig. 4 were recorded from different cells, we were concerned that factors such as differential fluo-3 loading or histamine sensitivity may have contributed to the observed variation. We therefore compared the responses of different Ca2+ puff sites within individual cells. Fig. 5 illustrates typical Ca2+ puff amplitudes from cells displaying either 2 or 3 independent sites. Similar to the patterns of response shown in Fig. 4, significant variation of both mean amplitude and spread of amplitudes could be observed from Ca2+ puff sites between cells. More importantly, however, the data reveal that independent Ca2+puff sites in the same cell produced events with significantly different amplitudes (Fig. 5; cells 1, 4, 5, and 6). In some cells the difference in average amplitude between two independent sites was modest, although significant (Fig. 5; cell 1), while in other cells there was a large difference in amplitude (Fig. 5;cells 4 and 6). Other cells with 2 or 3 independent sites displayed no significant difference between events (Fig. 5; cells 2 and 3). The fact that one Ca2+ puff site inside a cell displayed a high or low amplitude did not necessarily indicate that another site would show a statistically different mean amplitude. Differences between sites were seen whether the average Ca2+ puff amplitudes were large (Fig. 5; cell 4) or small (Fig. 5;cell 5). The experimental results described above illustrated the subcellular variability of individual Ca2+ puff sites. We also investigated other processes that could impinge on the distribution of puff amplitudes. Increasing agonist concentrations evoke greater InsP3 production in HeLa cells (19Bootman M.D. Taylor C.W. Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25113-25119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and trigger more substantial increases in the average global Ca2+i signal (13Bootman M.D. Niggli E. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 307-314Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 22Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 855-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Since global Ca2+ signals arise via recruitment of elementary Ca2+ puffs (23Berridge M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 291-306Crossref Scopus (918) Google Scholar), such agonist-dependent changes in the global amplitude could reflect differential recruitment of elementary Ca2+ release sites or alteration of the amount of Ca2+ liberated by these sites. We therefore investigated whether there was any effect of varying histamine concentrations on the amplitude of Ca2+ puffs. As illustrated in Fig. 6, changing the histamine concentration between 0.1 and 1 μm significantly altered the distribution of Ca2+ puff amplitudes. The mean amplitudes (± S.E.) for 0.1, 0.5, and 1 μm histamine were 143 ± 4 (n = 482), 257 ± 13 (n = 175), and 369 ± 13 (n = 306), respectively. These data indicate that the Ca2+ puffs were on average 2-fold larger with 1 μm histamine than with 0.1 μm, although the range of amplitudes observed was approximately the same with all three concentrations (∼20 to 650 nm). These results suggest that the increased InsP3 production which accompanies the increased histamine concentration not only influences the global Ca2+ response but also increased the amplitudes of the underlying elementary Ca2+ release signals. In approximately 10% of the cells that displayed a prolonged train of Ca2+ puffs during histamine stimulation, the amplitude of the events progressively declined (mean t½ for decay of 32.5 s; Fig. 7). Such a time-dependent reduction of hormone responsiveness can also be seen at the global level, i.e. smaller amplitude Ca2+ spikes and waves (13Bootman M.D. Niggli E. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 307-314Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar), reflecting desensitization of the Ca2+ signaling pathway. However, we were concerned that such a decline of Ca2+ puff amplitudes arose artifactually due to problems associated with recording from the cells for prolonged periods such as fluo-3 bleaching. Continuous illumination of cells in the absence of agonist did not inhibit Ca2+ signals evoked by the subsequent application of histamine or cause the Ca2+ puffs to have low amplitudes (data not shown). These data suggest that the decline of the Ca2+ puff amplitudes (Fig. 7) reflected a real change in the response of the cells. Another factor influencing Ca2+ puff amplitude was that it varied significantly between different days, despite using identical conditions and solutions. For example, on two independent days 0.1 and 0.5 μm histamine evoked Ca2+ puffs with mean amplitudes of 124 ± 4 (n = 386) and 199 ± 19 nm (n = 80) (day 1) and 221 ± 16 (n = 43) and 301 ± 15 nm(n = 129) (day 2). Although the average size of Ca2+ puffs altered between days, the spread of amplitudes (∼40–600 nm; data not shown) was the same for both days. Elementary Ca2+ signals, such as puffs and sparks, are the source of Ca2+ for local signaling and also the building blocks from which global Ca2+ signals are composed (6Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 7Lipp P. Niggli E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 265-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Berridge M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 291-306Crossref Scopus (918) Google Scholar). The characteristics of such elementary Ca2+signals convey important information concerning the properties of the intracellular Ca2+ release channels through which these signals are generated. Although it has been shown that the three InsP3R isoforms may be differentially distributed in specific subcellular areas with perhaps different functions, little is know about the distribution of InsP3Rs on the surface of the intracellular Ca2+ stores and their behavior within the clusters they form. The aim of the present study was to investigate the functionality of InsP3Rs in situ by analyzing the characteristics of hormone-evoked elementary Ca2+ signals. A major finding is that such signals are not stereotypic, instead their amplitudes can show substantial variation (e.g. Figs. 2 and 4), ranging from ∼15 to >600 nm (Fig. 3 B). Importantly, we found variation of the amplitude of Ca2+ puffs at multiple sites within the same cells (Fig. 5), where differences between cells in terms of variable histamine sensitivity or fluo-3 loading can be negated. Such observations are not compatible with the concept of a stereotypic hierarchy of calcium signals but suggest that elementary Ca2+ signals comprise a continuum of events. Such a continuum is set by the boundaries of a single InsP3R opening on one hand and the concerted opening of a maximally sized cluster of InsP3Rs on the other hand. Inside these boundaries, both the number of recruited channels within a cluster and their gating characteristics (24Swillens S. Champeil P. Combettes L. Dupont G. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) determine the amplitude of the elementary Ca2+ release event. In a previous study, we reported that the amplitude of elementary Ca2+ signals arising from a single site could grow ∼9-fold as the response proceeded (15Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Cell. 1997; 91: 367-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). This pattern is usually observed during the “pacemaker” Ca2+ rise as the cell approaches the threshold for evoking a regenerative Ca2+wave and may arise due to the synergistic effect of InsP3and the slowly elevating [Ca2+]i. In the present study we only included elementary Ca2+ signals that were not accompanied by such an increase in the ambient Ca2+concentration to avoid similar synergistic effects. The continuum presented in Fig. 3 B therefore represents the range of amplitudes arising from the stochastic opening of InsP3Rs, without cross-talk from previous elementary events or other Ca2+ release sites. We also observed that the elementary Ca2+ signals were not stereotypic in their duration. However, the broad spread of lifetimes (Fig. 3 C, a) did not simply parallel the continuum of amplitudes, with the larger and smaller events lasting longer and shorter, respectively. Rather, there was considerable variation between the duration of Ca2+ puffs with similar amplitudes. The low correlation between amplitude and duration (Fig. 3 C, b) indicates that different Ca2+puff sites operate in local environments with a substantial variation in Ca2+ sequestration/buffering capacity. Consistent with this scheme, we have found that a particularly important factor determining the duration of elementary Ca2+ signals in HeLa cells is their position relative to the nucleus. We previously demonstrated that perinuclear Ca2+ puffs often displayed >10-fold longer decay phases than those events more distant from the nucleus (16Lipp P. Thomas D. Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7166-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This prolongation of the elementary Ca2+signal probably reflects the lack of Ca2+buffering/sequestration within the nucleus. One intriguing result from the present study was the observation that some elementary Ca2+ release sites displayed marked amplitude variability from event to event (Figs. 2 A and 4), while others produced more consistent Ca2+ signals (Figs. 2 B and 4). For example, all 17 events depicted by site 6 in Fig. 4 were within 20 nm of each other, while the 9 events at site 7 spanned 300 nm. These two response patterns were seen in approximately equal proportion and were reproducible with repeated stimulation (data not shown), which indicated that they must be a property of the release site itself. Clearly, elementary Ca2+ signals in HeLa cells are not stereotypic but display considerable variability between Ca2+ release sites and often between events at a single site. Several mechanisms could account for such a behavior for the individual release sites, such as (i) all-or-none activation of InsP3R clusters containing different numbers of channels, (ii) smoothly graded recruitment of InsP3Rs within a cluster, and (iii) variation in InsP3R open times. The observation that some Ca2+ puff sites gave relatively consistent signals (e.g. Fig. 4, sites 2, 4, and 6), but a different mean amplitude, supports the notion that release sites are indeed composed of a characteristic, but variable, number of InsP3Rs and that these sites are activated in an all-or-none manner. A graded recruitment of InsP3Rs within a cluster could account for the event-to-event variation seen at some sites (e.g. Fig. 4, sites 1, 3, 5, and 7). The basis for these event-to-event variations might be found in the loose functional coupling between individual InsP3Rs, due to the greater physical distance between the receptors, or their variable sensitivity toward both Ca2+and InsP3. The alternative behavior of the release sites,i.e. consistent or variable amplitudes, could also reflect different isoform compositions of the individual InsP3R clusters. Similar to the results in the present study, Parker and colleagues (25Marchant J.S. Callamaras N. Sun X.P. Parker I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 506: 70PGoogle Scholar,26Sun X.-P. Callamaras J.S. Marchant J.S. Parker I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 509: 67-80Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that elementary events evoked by photolysis of caged InsP3 in Xenopus oocytes are also not stereotypic in amplitude and had a similarly broad spread of lifetimes. Their analysis of the Ca2+ release flux underlying elementary events in Xenopus oocytes suggested that InsP3R clusters expressed between 1 and ∼8 channels (26Sun X.-P. Callamaras J.S. Marchant J.S. Parker I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 509: 67-80Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we calculated that elementary Ca2+release sites in HeLa cells contained between 1 and 25 channels (13Bootman M.D. Niggli E. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 307-314Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar). It is difficult to give a precise value for the number of InsP3Rs in a cluster because little is known about the gating behavior of InsP3Rs in vivo. In particular, the local buffers and the mean open times of the single channels significantly influence the estimation of the composition of the clusters. In addition, the different sensitivity of the isoforms for Ca2+-dependent inhibition may also alter the estimated number of receptors in a cluster, since the channels with a greater sensitivity would have a lower probability to stay open for long times. A refinement for estimating the number of InsP3Rs in a cluster is the consideration of the signal mass, rather than using the integral of the rising phase of an elementary Ca2+ release event, as was suggested recently by Parker and co-workers (26Sun X.-P. Callamaras J.S. Marchant J.S. Parker I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 509: 67-80Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Assuming that InsP3Rs in HeLa cells and Xenopus oocytes behave similarly with respect to their open times, the number of receptors within a cluster would be comparable in both cell types. HeLa cells and Xenopus oocytes therefore seem to base their Ca2+ signaling on analogous elementary events. In both cell types, low levels of stimulation activate infrequent discrete elementary Ca2+ signals (15Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Cell. 1997; 91: 367-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 18Parker I. Choi J. Yao Y. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Stronger stimuli trigger regenerative Ca2+ waves propagating in a saltatoric manner between elementary Ca2+ release sites that are similarly spaced (13Bootman M.D. Niggli E. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 307-314Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 27Callamaras N. Marchant J.S. Sun X.-P. Parker I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 509: 81-92Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The analogous functional behavior of InsP3Rs in HeLa cells and Xenopus oocytes is striking given that (i) these cells vary by more than 10,000-fold in volume and (ii) that the elementary events in Xenopusoocytes were activated by the exogenous introduction of InsP3, whereas we use hormonal stimulation. The consequence of stimulating cells with a hormone is that we can visualize the gradual build-up and decay of Ca2+ signals during physiological changes of the InsP3 concentration. This includes changes in the spatial recruitment, amplitude, and frequency of elementary Ca2+ signals during the pacemaker (15Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Cell. 1997; 91: 367-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), as well as desensitization of the Ca2+ puffs during prolonged hormone stimulation (Fig. 7). Analogous activities of the elementary Ca2+ events have not been reported during stepwise exogenous elevation of InsP3 in Xenopusoocytes. The results presented in this study for InsP3-evoked elementary Ca2+ signals parallel recent observations of Ca2+ sparks arising via opening of ryanodine receptors in muscle cells. The first Ca2+ sparks observed in cardiac myocytes were initially postulated to reflect stereotypical signals possibly resulting from a single ryanodine receptor (8Cheng H. Lederer W.J. Cannell M.B. Science. 1993; 262: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies have demonstrated that elementary signals smaller than the original Ca2+ spark can be observed in cardiac myocytes (28Lipp P. Niggli E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 31-38Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 29Parker I. Wier W.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505: 337-344Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and skeletal muscle (30Shirokova N. Rios E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 502: 3-11Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, using two-photon photolysis of caged Ca2+ to allow a variable and highly localized trigger stimulus for Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum indicated that Ca2+ sparks can be deconvolved into lesser signals denoted “Ca2+ quarks” (31Lipp P. Niggli E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 801-809Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Analogous elementary Ca2+ events have been observed in cells as diverse as cardiac myocytes, skeletal muscle,Xenopus oocytes, and HeLa cells. In each of these cell types it appears that the elementary events, which were once thought to be stereotypic, actually represent a continuum of amplitudes and durations reflecting the dynamic interactions between multiple Ca2+channels within a functional InsP3R or ryanodine receptor cluster."

The existence of these two adhesion-inducing pathways implies that alternative mechanisms might exist by which LFA-1 engages ICAM-1. The LFA-1 α subunit I domain contains a major binding site for ICAM-1. In this study we show that soluble LFA-1 I domain blocks ICAM-1 binding of the high affinity Mg2+-induced form of LFA-1 but not the phorbol ester-induced form. Under conditions of Mg2+-activation, the soluble I domain also prevents expression of an activation dependent epitope on LFA-1, implying that it inhibits a conformational change necessary for conversion to the high affinity form of this integrin. In addition, the binding of Mg2+-activated LFA-1 to ICAM-1 is blocked by peptides covering the α4-β3 loop, the β3-α5 loop, and the α5 helix of the I domain, whereas none of the peptides tested blocks phorbol ester-mediated adhesion. The blocking peptides localize to the same face of the crystal structure of the LFA-1 I domain and define an area that, during activation, may be involved in association of the I domain with another region of LFA-1, potentially the β-propeller domain.

Adhesion mediated by the interaction of the integrin LFA-11 (CD11a/CD18) with one of its ligands, ICAM-1, ICAM-2, or ICAM-3, is crucial to the inflammatory process (reviewed in Refs. 1Stewart M.

LFA-1 is not constitutively able to bind ligand, but requires activation, with the characteristics of the active LFA-1 depending on the method of stimulation. In vitro, triggering of T cells with phorbol ester or by increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentration does not induce a detectable change in the affinity of the individual LFA-1 molecules. These stimuli, however, induce clustering of LFA-1, thereby increasing the overall strength of binding (4Stewart M.P. Cabañas C. Hogg N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1810-1817PubMed Google Scholar, 5Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), which is described as an increase in avidity. In contrast, activation from the outside of the cell with Mg2+ and EGTA results in the formation of a higher affinity form of LFA-1, as assessed by an increased ability to bind soluble ICAM-1, and in expression of an activation reporter epitope recognized by mAb 24 (1Stewart M.

Med. 1995; 181: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) suggest that physiological stimuli regulate adhesion by two major mechanisms involving alterations either in the affinity of the individual integrin molecules or in the overall avidity of binding. Such different forms of integrin adhesion might dictate the nature of signals transmitted into the cell and have functional consequences. It is not completely understood how these two forms of adhesion relate to the in vivo activation of LFA-1; however, the idea of a two-stage model of activation has been proposed in which integrin clustering is followed by a ligand-induced affinity increase (1Stewart M. Hogg N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Whether LFA-1 adhesion activated by different stimuli involves distinct regions within the integrin is unknown. Several ligand binding sites have been identified that colocalize with sites where divalent cation is also thought to bind (reviewed in Refs. 10Hogg N. Landis R.C. Bates P.A. Stanley P. Randi A.M.

The seven N-terminal repeat sequences of a typical integrin α subunit have been modeled as a β-propeller fold (28Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and the I domain is predicted to bind to the upper surface of this model, resembling the relationship between the α and β subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein (29Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). In this study, we use recombinant I domain and constituent peptides in order to understand how this domain participates in LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 when different integrin activators are used. We demonstrate that soluble I domain inhibits Mg2+-induced LFA-1-mediated adhesion to ICAM-1 but not phorbol ester-induced binding. We provide evidence to suggest that a conformational change in LFA-1, which leads to the high affinity form, is blocked by the soluble I domain. Using peptides, the inhibiting activity is pinpointed to two loops associated with the α4 and α5 helices that lie on one face of the I domain. The LFA-1 I domain residues Leu111–Ser327, termed (Leu111–Ser327)I dom, includes the predicted I domain sequence and an amino-terminal extension of ∼17 amino acids (30Larson R.S. Corbi A.L. Berman L. Springer T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It was made by a polymerase chain reaction from a full-length LFA-1 α subunit cDNA using a standard protocol. The polymerase chain reaction oligos were used to add restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends and the digested product was ligated into pGEX2T (31Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar) to encode a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Sequencing was carried out using an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The expressed glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was purified as described previously (17Stanley P. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3358-3362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and was directly cleaved from the glutathione S-transferase moiety using thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) while still attached to the glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The electrophoretic mobility of the isolated protein, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, corresponded to the predicted size of ∼25 kDa. A second I domain construct, (Gly128–Ser327)I dom, the sequence of which conforms to the boundaries of the LFA-1 I domain, was also made as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. (Gly128–Ser327)I dom was isolated in two stages, involving elution of the glutathione S-transferase chimeric protein from glutathione-Sepharose followed by thrombin cleavage. Both (Leu111–Ser327)I dom and (Gly128–Ser327)I dom proteins expressed 10 I domain mAb epitopes, assessed as described previously (12Randi A.M. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12395-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison with (Leu111–Ser327)I dom, (Gly128–Ser327)I dom was less soluble, produced in lower yield, and although intact as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, lost ICAM-1 binding activity after short term storage at 4 °C. This inactive protein was used as a negative control in the relevant experiments. The ICAM-1Fc chimeric protein contained the five extracellular domains of ICAM-1 fused to a human IgG1 Fc sequence (32Berendt A.R. McDowall A. Craig A.G. Bates P.A. Sternberg M.J.E. Marsh K. Newbold C.I. Hogg N. Cell. 1992; 68: 71-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and was isolated from a transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell line after 10 days in serum-free medium (17Stanley P. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3358-3362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). T cell culture was performed as described previously (7Dransfield I. Cabañas C. Craig A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), and the cells were labeled in either of two ways. Five × 107 human T cells were labeled with 25 μCi of [3H]thymidine overnight at 37 °C then washed in RPMI or HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mg/ml glucose, pH 7.4). Alternatively, the T cells (4 × 106/ml) were labeled with 2.5 μm BCECF/AM (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 37 °C, then washed and resuspended in HEPES buffer. Immulon 1 96-well plates (Dynatech) were coated with ICAM-1Fc (240 ng/well) overnight at 4 °C. Nonspecific sites were then blocked with 2.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature, followed by 4 washes in the appropriate buffer. Labeled T cells (2 × 105 in 50 μl) were added to the ICAM-1Fc-coated wells in the presence or absence of 50 μl of proteins, peptides or mAbs in HEPES buffer containing 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA (2× final concentration) or 0.6 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 100 nm phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PdBu) (2× final concentrations). The plates were spun for 1 min at 30 ×g and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by two to four washes with prewarmed RPMI or HEPES containing the appropriate cations. According to labeling procedure, the bound cells were either harvested and radioactivity measured using a beta-counter (LKB) or quantified using a fluorescence plate reader (Fluoroskan II, Labsystems). Function blocking mAbs specific for the LFA-1 α subunit (mAb 38; IgG2a) and ICAM-1 (mAb 15.2; IgG1) and control mAbs 4U (IgG2a) and 52U (IgG1), all at 10 μg/ml, were included as controls in all assays. To measure the strength of adhesion, BCECF/AM-labeled T cells were allowed to adhere to ICAM-1Fc for 30 min at 37 °C as above. Each well was then filled with HEPES buffer, and the plate was tightly sealed with adhesive sealing film (SealPlate, Anachem). Care was taken to avoid air bubbles. Sealed plates were gently inverted and centrifuged at the relevant force (411–1643 × g) for 8 min at room temperature. Plates subjected to the 1 × g force were sealed, inverted, and allowed to stand for 8 min at room temperature. After centrifugation the plate sealers were removed and the inverted plates were allowed to drain. Cells remaining bound to the ICAM-1Fc-coated surface were quantified using the fluorescence plate reader. Preincubation of T cells or immobilized ICAM-1Fc with I domain was performed prior to the adhesion assay as follows. For plate preincubation, plates that had been ICAM-1Fc-coated and bovine serum albumin-blocked were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 50 μl of proteins or mAbs in HEPES buffer containing 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA. The solutions were removed, and 50 μl of HEPES buffer containing 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA were added followed by the addition of 50 μl of BCECF/AM-labeled cells (2 × 105/well). For cell preincubation, BCECF/AM-labeled cells (2–4 × 106/ml) in HEPES buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA were incubated in the presence or absence of proteins or mAbs for 15 min at 37 °C. After centrifugation for 1 min at 30 × g, the solutions were removed, and the cells were resuspended in HEPES buffer and added to ICAM-1Fc-coated, bovine serum albumin-blocked, and washed wells containing 50 μl of HEPES buffer and 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA. The assay was carried out as outlined above. T cells were incubated at 2 × 106/ml on ice for 15 min in HEPES buffer plus 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and (Leu111–Ser327)I dom. Anti-LFA-1 mAbs (mAb 24; G25.2 (Becton Dickinson); S6F1 (a kind gift from Chikao Morimoto, Boston); TS2/4 (ATCC)) were then added at 10 μg/ml. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C the cells were washed three times in FACSWASH (phosphate-buffered saline + 0.2% bovine serum albumin + 0.1% sodium azide). The T cells were resuspended at 4 × 106/ml in fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) diluted in FACSWASH, washed three times as above, fixed in 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). In experiments testing the effect of peptides on mAb 24 expression, peptides were added instead of the soluble I domain, and the same procedure was followed. Peptides spanning the LFA-1 I domain were synthesized on a model 430A Applied Biosystems solid phase synthesizer using 9-fluorenyl-methoxycarbonyl chemistry (33Carpino L.A. Han G.Y. J. Org. Chem. 1972; 22: 3404-3409Crossref Scopus (1091) Google Scholar) and characterized by amino acid analysis and plasma desorption mass spectrometry. A peak corresponding to the expected molecular weight was found for each peptide, and in all cases peptides contained the correct sequence. Synthesized peptides were desalted using Sephadex G10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove potentially cytotoxic compounds and stored as a lyophilized powder under desiccating conditions at room temperature. All peptides used in these experiments were tested for cytotoxic activity using an 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay with modification as described previously (34Stanley P. Bates P.A. Harvey J. Bennett R.I. Hogg N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1790-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and were tested at concentrations at which they were fully soluble. The role of the I domain in different forms of LFA-1-mediated adhesion to ICAM-1 was investigated by testing the ability of soluble recombinant (Leu111–Ser327)I dom to interfere with Mg2+/EGTA or PdBu-stimulated T cell binding to immobilized ICAM-1. Experimental conditions were chosen such that similar percentages of T cells added to the reaction adhered with both stimuli. The I domain inhibited Mg2+/EGTA-induced adhesion in a dose-dependent manner with half-maximal blocking at 2 μm, but did not interfere with PdBu-induced LFA-1 adhesion (Fig. 1 A). Both forms of adhesion were completely blocked by mAbs against ICAM-1 or LFA-1 (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). Inactive I domain (control protein, see “Experimental Procedures”) did not interfere with Mg2+-induced adhesion (Fig. 1 B) indicating that the blocking effect of the active I domain was not due to nonspecific protein interactions. One possible reason for the failure of the (Leu111–Ser327)I dom to block PdBu-mediated adhesion is that PdBu might induce a higher overall binding strength than is achieved with Mg2+/EGTA and therefore the binding of Mg2+/EGTA-treated cells would be more easily inhibited than the binding of cells treated with phorbol ester. To investigate this we titrated the amount of anti-ICAM-1 mAb 15.2 required to prevent adhesion (Fig. 2 A). The titration curves overlap, showing that both forms of adhesion are inhibited equally by a blocking antibody. To substantiate these data we compared the overall adhesive strength of Mg2+/EGTA- and of PdBu-activated cells by a second method. T cells were allowed to adhere to ICAM-1 and then the strength of adhesion was evaluated by a quantitative centrifugal removal assay (35Storms S.D. Jensen J.J. Yaghmai D. Murray B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), in which the cells were subjected to increasing relative centrifugal forces (Fig. 2 B). The number of cells that remained bound to ICAM-1 at each relative centrifugal force was the same for both forms of adhesion indicating that treatment of cells with either 1 mmMg2+ and 1 mm EGTA or with 50 nmPdBu results in a very similar overall strength of adhesion. We have previously shown that (Leu111–Ser327)I dom binds to ICAM-1 under conditions similar to the Mg2+/EGTA activation procedure (17Stanley P. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3358-3362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) raising the possibility that the lack of inhibition of PdBu-mediated T cell adhesion is due to the inability of soluble I domain to bind ICAM-1 under the PdBu assay conditions. When investigated by solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, however, the soluble I domain was found to bind ICAM-1 to a similar extent when either PdBu or Mg2+/EGTA assay buffers were used (data not shown). One explanation for the blocking effect of (Leu111–Ser327)I dom might be that it competes for ICAM-1 binding with Mg2+/EGTA activated LFA-1 but not with PdBu activated LFA-1. Another explanation is that soluble I domain inhibits by interacting with LFA-1 on T cells thus preventing a conformational change essential for high affinity binding induced by Mg2+/EGTA. We attempted to discriminate between these two possibilities by preincubating either T cells or immobilized ICAM-1 with (Leu111–Ser327)I dom, then removing unbound protein prior to the adhesion assay (Fig. 3). Neither preincubation of T cells nor of immobilized ICAM-1 with soluble I domain caused inhibition of T cell adhesion, therefore preventing assessment, using this approach, of which of the two mechanisms of inhibition applies. The need for the constant presence of the I domain in the assay, however, implies that the interaction of the I domain with ICAM-1 or T cells is of low affinity. One of the characteristics of Mg2+-induced LFA-1 adhesion is the expression of an activation reporter epitope recognized by mAb 24 (1Stewart M. Hogg N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 6Dransfield I. Hogg N. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3759-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 7Dransfield I. Cabañas C. Craig A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Exposure of this epitope is thought to reflect a conformational change in LFA-1 that leads to a high affinity receptor. PdBu-stimulated adhesion, in contrast, is not associated with any significant increase in mAb 24 expression (4Stewart M.P. Cabañas C. Hogg N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1810-1817PubMed Google Scholar). In order to assess whether soluble I domain interacts with T cells under the condition of Mg2+-activation, we investigated whether it affects the expression of the mAb 24 epitope. T cells were incubated with (Leu111–Ser327)I dom and Mg2+/EGTA in the same manner as for an adhesion assay (except that they were not exposed to immobilized ICAM-1) and the expression of mAb 24 was measured by flow cytometry. Soluble I domain inhibited mAb 24 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4, A and B). However, soluble I domain did not affect the expression of three mAbs, S6F1, G25.2, and TS2/4, which, like mAb 24, are not expressed on the I domain (12Randi A.M. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12395-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 2B. Leitinger, unpublished results. but are directed against epitopes on the β-propeller domain of LFA-1 (36Huang C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, C and D, and data not shown). These data show that the soluble I domain interferes specifically with expression of a conformation-sensitive epitope on LFA-1, indicating that there is a direct interaction of the soluble I domain with T cells. This implies that the I domain inhibits T cell binding to ICAM-1 by interacting with LFA-1 and preventing a conformational change necessary for conversion to the high affinity form of this integrin. To characterize the regions within the I domain required specifically for Mg2+-stimulation, constituent peptides (Table I) were tested for their ability to interfere with ICAM-1 binding of T cells following the two protocols already mentioned. When T cell LFA-1 was activated by treatment with Mg2+/EGTA, only peptides I(217–233) and I(238–254) consistently blocked LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 (Fig. 5 A). The average level of inhibition for I(238–254) was 72% and for I(217–233) was 50% at 2 mm (n = 13). It is of interest that I(130–159), which covers the major part of the MIDAS motif (D137 XSXS), was not inhibitory at 2 mm (data not shown). As anticipated, when LFA-1-mediated adhesion was induced by PdBu, I(217–233), I(238–254), and the other peptides tested had no blocking activity (Fig. 5 B). This result indicates that I domain regions I(217–233) and I(238–254) are specifically involved in Mg2+-induced recognition of ICAM-1.Table IPeptides and amino acid sequencesPeptidesAmino acid sequenceFirst series I(130–159)VDLVFLFDGS.MSLQPDEFQK.ILDFMKDVMK I(193–202)DALLKHVKHM I(217–233)TEVFREELGA.RPDATKV I(238–254)TDGEATDSGN.IDAAKDI I(256–275)RYIIGIGKHF.QTKESQETLH I(276–295)KFASKPASEF.VKILDTFEKL I(296–312)KDLFTELQKK.IYVIEGTSecond series I(223–233)ELGARPDATK.V I(238–246)TDGEATDSG I(242–254)ATDSGNIDAA.KDI I(247–258)NIDAAKDIIR.YIScrambled controls I(223–233)VKLETAGADR.P I(238–254)DIDTKAEGAD.TAINSDG Open table in a new tab In order to further pinpoint the critical residues, we made a set of overlapping peptides concentrating on the sequence Thr217–Ile254 (Table I). Peptides corresponding to the N-terminal, mid, and C-terminal regions of the most inhibitory peptide, I(238–254), i.e. I(238–246), I(242–254), and I(247–258), respectively, all blocked T cell binding to ICAM-1 in an equivalent, dose-dependent manner and were as effective as the parent peptide I(238–254), whereas control peptide I(256–275) did not interfere at the same concentrations (Fig. 6 A). We considered peptide I(242–254) to represent the minimally active sequence. Similarly, peptide I(223–233) corresponded in blocking activity to the parent peptide I(217–233) (data not shown). Unfortunately, peptide I(210–223) had limited solubility and could not be tested. The dose-dependent inhibition of T cell binding to ICAM-1 by I(223–233) and I(238–254) was compared with scrambled versions of both these peptides (see Table I), which did not significantly affect binding (Fig. 6 B). To test whether the peptide inhibition occurs by the same mechanism as soluble I domain inhibition of T cell binding to ICAM-1, we analyzed the effect of peptide I(238–254) on mAb 24 expression. Fig. 7 shows that I(238–254) at 2 mm, but not its scrambled control, inhibited mAb 24 expression. The average level of inhibition of 24 epitope expression was 55% (n = 4). These results indicate that I(238–254) and soluble I domain interact with T cells in a similar manner. When the two function blocking peptides are superimposed on the crystal structure of the LFA-1 I domain (18Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The sequence Glu223–Val233 corresponds to the loop following the α4 helix which terminates in the β3 strand and the sequence Ala242–Ile254 consists of the β3-α5 loop and follows the loop to the end of the small α5 helix (see Fig. 8 A). The seven N-terminal repeated domains of an integrin α subunit have recently been proposed to form a seven-bladed β-propeller structure (28Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the last few years, it has become evident that the proteasome is responsible for the degradation of a number of intracellular proteins, usually resulting in the complete degradation of the target proteins (10Ciechanover A.

The site of proteasome-mediated degradation appears to be cytosolic, requiring the retrograde translocation of the proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the cytosol for degradation (10Ciechanover A.

The proteolytic removal of apoB by proteasomes appears to be a mechanism by which the cell removes apoB molecules that are misfolded, especially when lipid supply is limiting. However, it is presently not known whether only incomplete nascent apoB peptides or full-length apoB molecules that are completely translocated into the ER are targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation. In this study, we have examined this mechanistic issue in the biogenesis of apoB-100 in a human hepatoma cell line, HepG2. We found that both incomplete nascent apoB peptides and the full-length apoB that has undergone glycosylation in the ER can be retrotranslocated into the cytosol for ubiquitination and proteasome degradation.

Rabbit anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Ari Helenius (Yale University Medical School). HepG2 cells from American Type Culture Collection were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were grown in 162-cm2 flasks to 80–90% confluence. Microsomes were prepared as described by Cosgrove et al. (15Cosgrove P.G. Gaynor B.J. Harwood Jr., J. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 34: 1983-2003Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were scraped in phosphate-buffered saline after washing once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. They were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. The cells were then homogenized with a glass homogenizer in 0.25m sucrose and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) on ice. The cell homogenate was first centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to pellet the microsomes. Trypsin digestion of microsomes was done according to Bonnardel and Davis (16Bonnardel J.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28892-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Microsomes were suspended in 0.25 m sucrose and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Trypsin was then added to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. After incubation, soybean trypsin inhibitor (final concentration, 5 mg/ml) was added to stop digestion. The microsomes were then lysed 2.5 h at 4 °C by adding an equal volume of 2% sodium cholate in HEPES-buffered saline (50 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm ALLN, and 10 mm NEM, and a protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet for 50 ml, complete protease inhibitor tablet, Boehringer Mannheim). The lysate was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation. Single immunoprecipitation and sequential immunoprecipitation were done as described previously (7Yeung S.J. Chen S.-H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed for 2.5 h at 4 °C in 2% sodium cholate in HEPES-buffered saline (50 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm ALLN, 5 mm NEM, and complete protease inhibitors (Boehringer Mannheim). The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with anti-apoB antibody at 4 °C on a gyrating platform for 1 h. Gamma-Bind G beads were then added and the mixture was incubated for 5 h. After 3 washes with 2% cholate, for single immunoprecipitation, the immunoprecipitate was heated to 100 °C for 5 min in 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For sequential immunoprecipitation, the first antibody immunoprecipitation was done as described above. The Immunobead-antigen complex was washed 3 times and then incubated in 1% SDS in HEPES-buffered saline (0.1 ml) at 95 °C for 3 min to dissociate the antigen from the beads. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and diluted with 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100 in HEPES-buffered saline containing 0.1 mmALLN, 5 mm NEM, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitors for the second antibody immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–15% gradient gels or 6% gels. Proteins from single or sequential immunoprecipitation on the SDS-PAGE were transferred overnight onto nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed either with peroxidase-conjugated primary antibody or with unconjugated primary antibody followed by appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-IgG as indicated and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cultured HepG2 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 0.1 mm tunicamycin for 3 h. One flask (162 cm2) each of treated and untreated HepG2 cells was processed for sequential immunoprecipitation with anti-apoB and then anti-ubiquitin antibodies as described above. The controls were immunoprecipitated with protein G-Sepharose alone in the second immunoprecipitation step. The samples were electrophoresed and immunoblotted with anti-calnexin antibody as described above. HepG2 cell lysate supernatant was prepared as described above and concanavalin A-Sepharose was added (100 μl/ml of cell lysate). The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 5 h, and the concanavalin A-Sepharose was separated by centrifugation. The non-concanavalin A-bound apoB was recovered from the supernatant by immunoprecipitation using a goat anti-apoB polyclonal antibody. To dissociate the concanavalin A-bound apoB, the concanavalin A-Sepharose beads were washed 3 times and incubated in 1% SDS in HEPES-buffered saline (0.1 ml) at 95 °C for 3 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted to 1 ml with 1% Triton X-100 in HEPES-buffered saline containing 0.1 mmALLN, 5 mm NEM, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitors, and immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-apoB antibody. Immunoprecipitated concanavalin A-bound and unbound apoB were then boiled in 2× SDS-PAGE buffer as described above for the immunoblot assay. Three 162-cm2 flasks of HepG2 cells were solubilized in lysis buffer and homogenized in a glass Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was centrifuged at 100 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min to remove cellular debris. The lysate was then passed through a column (4 ml) of anti-apoB-Sepharose beads. The column was prepared by conjugating 100 μl of goat anti-human apoB antiserum with 1 g, dry weight, of cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose according to the manufacturer's procedure (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The bound apoB was eluted by 2 bed volumes of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0. The eluate was allowed to drip directly into a tube containing 0.1 volume of 1m Tris, pH 8.0. The eluate was mixed and then divided into two equal parts. One-half was loaded onto a column of anti-ubiquitin-Sepharose and the other half onto control Sepharose. The anti-ubiquitin-Sepharose was prepared by conjugating rabbit polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antiserum with cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose. The control Sepharose was prepared by quenching the reactive sites on cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose with excess Tris. The bound ubiquitinated apoB was eluted the same way. The eluate was then concentrated down to 500 μl by using Centricon (molecular mass cutoff, 20 kDa). 30 μl of each sample in SDS sample buffer was loaded onto the gels. After electrophoresis, the proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and oxidative glycan detection was performed using a kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Briefly, the membrane was incubated with an oxidizing agent, which oxidized the adjacent hydroxyl groups in carbohydrates. The oxidized group was then conjugated to digoxigenin. Detection was then performed with anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase with color development using 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (NBT/x-phosphate solution). Carboxypeptidase Y, a glycoprotein, and albumin, a nonglycoprotein, were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Puromycin synchronization was performed as described by Benoist and Grand-Perret (17Benoist F. Grand-Perret T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20435-20442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were preincubated in the methionine-free medium for 20 min, and puromycin was added (10 μm) for another 10 min. The cells were then washed 3 times with ice-cold medium. A 5-min pulse label was initiated by the addition of [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) in methionine-free medium followed by a 10-min chase by the addition of cold methionine (15 mg/liter). The cells were lysed and ubiquitinated apoB was immunoprecipitated by goat polyclonal anti-apoB then by anti-ubiquitin antibody as described above. The immunoprecipitates were run on 6% SDS-PAGE, the gels were dried, and the autoradiographic image was captured using a storage phosphor system (Cyclone, Packard). In some parallel puromycin synchronization experiments, lactacystin (10 μm) was included in the culture medium. In the first experiments, we studied the effect of a specific proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, on the fate of intracellular apoB in cultured HepG2 cells (Fig. 1). In agreement with experiments using other less specific proteasome inhibitors (ALLN and carbobenzoxyl-leucyl-leucyl-norvalinal-H (MG115)) in our laboratory (7Yeung S.J. Chen S.-H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), lactacystin (10 μm) treatment led to an accumulation of total intracellular apoB (compare lanes 3 and 4), as well as ubiquitinated apoB (compare lanes 1 and 2). Both in the absence and presence of lactacystin, the ubiquitin-immunoreactive material co-precipitated by the apoB antiserum is quite heterogeneous in size. The largest ubiquitinated apoB molecules have an apparent molecular mass significantly larger than 550 kDa, the size of native full-length unubiquitinated apoB, reflecting the presence of multiple 8.5-kDa ubiquitin conjugates covalently linked to the apoB molecule. Importantly, there are substantial amounts of ubiquitinated apoB immunoreactive material that are significantly smaller than full-length apoB-100. These short molecules in the form of a smear on the SDS-PAGE are detected in the absence of lactacystin but are much more abundant in its presence. They may represent short nascent apoB peptides that have been targeted for proteasome degradation by ubiquitination, or they may consist of proteolytic fragments of completed apoB chains that have undergone polyubiquitination. To further characterize the ubiquitination process, we isolated microsomes from HepG2 cells and treated them with trypsin. As shown in Fig. 2, trypsin treatment results in a small decrease in the amount of full-length apoB-100, indicating that some of the apoB is on the cytosolic side of the ER. However, the persistence of a substantial amount of apoB following trypsin treatment indicates that only a portion of the full-length apoB under steady-state conditions is accessible to digestion by exogenously added trypsin, and the rest is within the lumen of the ER and not susceptible to the enzyme digestion. In agreement with the observations of Du et al. (18Du E.Z. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), upon trypsin treatment of HepG2 microsomes, we observed the accumulation of an 85-kDa N-terminal fragment, which is not ubiquitinated. No C-terminal fragment was detected when we used a C-terminal specific monoclonal antibody (Bsol 22) (19Chen P.-F. Marcel Y.L. Yang C.-Y. Gotto Jr., A.M. Milne R. Sparrow J.T. Chan L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 175: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) for detection. Furthermore, trypsinization completely removed the ubiquitinated apoB, whereas under the identical experimental conditions, albumin was completely resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin. Therefore, trypsin is excluded from the ER lumen and cannot access proteins within the lumen. These results indicate that polyubiquitination is an exclusively cytosolic process. Calnexin is a ubiquitous resident ER protein that binds to newly synthesized N-linked glycoproteins (20Bergeron J.J.M. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 21Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 1997; 88: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Chenet al. (9Chen Y. Le Cahérec F. Chuck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11887-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) demonstrated that inhibition of calnexin binding of glycosylated apoB by castanospermine was associated with the proteasome-mediated degradation of apoB. They speculated that calnexin safeguards glycosylated apoB from degradation by promoting correct folding and complete translocation. We investigated whether ubiquitinated apoB, which is tagged for proteasome degradation, would still be bound to calnexin in HepG2 cells. Ubiquitinated apoB was isolated from HepG2 cells by sequential purification using apoB and ubiquitin antisera. The ubiquitinated apoB was found to be bound to calnexin, which was released from the ubiquitinated apoB by SDS and detected by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3). Therefore, calnexin binding per se does not provide absolute protection of apoB against ubiquitination. Furthermore, because calnexin only binds to glycoproteins (22Zapun A. Petrescu S.M. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), this experiment indicates that ubiquitinated apoB is glycosylated. As a control, inhibition of apoB glycosylation by tunicamycin was found to completely abolish calnexin binding to the unglycosylated apoB in HepG2 cells. Calnexin binding to ubiquitinated apoB constitutes only indirect evidence for the presence of carbohydrate conjugates in the ubiquitinated protein. To obtain more direct evidence of the presence of carbohydrate, we used two other independent methods to analyze for the presence of carbohydrate conjugates in intracellular ubiquitinated apoB. In the first series of experiments, we used concanavalin A-Sepharose to affinity purify intracellular apoB from cultured HepG2 cells. Concanavalin A binds to apoB molecules that display covalently linked α-d-mannopyranosyl and/or α-d-glucopyranosyl on the surface that is available for interaction with the lectin; therefore, all concanavalin A-bound apoB molecules would be glycosylated. The apoB recovered in the unbound fraction would contain unglycosylated apoB as well as glycosylated apoB whose d-glucose or d-mannose moieties are inaccessible for concanavalin A binding. By immunoblot analysis against a ubiquitin antiserum, the apoB in the unbound fraction was found to be heavily ubiquitinated (Fig. 4 A). Most importantly, the concanavalin A-bound apoB, which contains only glycosylated apoB, also displays substantial polyubiquitination. The heterogeneous nature of the concanavalin A-bound and unbound ubiquitinated glycosylated and unglycosylated apoB is very similar to that shown in Fig. 1 and to similar blots on total intracellular apoB from our laboratory (7Yeung S.J. Chen S.-H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and other laboratories (8Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20427-20434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 9Chen Y. Le Cahérec F. Chuck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11887-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The presence of full-length molecules in lane 2 of Fig. 4 A suggests that completed and glycosylated apoB proteins are susceptible to ubiquitination. The presence of low molecular weight ubiquitinated apoB peptides that contain carbohydrate further suggests that some apoB chains that are partially in the lumen of the ER are also glycosylated and that glycosylation per se, like calnexin binding, does not protect against polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. In a second set of experiments to complement the concanavalin A binding studies, we used a chemical approach to document that ubiquitinated apoB contains glycan. Ubiquitinated apoB isolated from HepG2 cells was fractionated on SDS-PAGE, and the presence of glycan on the ubiquitinated apoB was determined by an oxidative glycan detection method as described under “Materials and Methods.” An unglycosylated protein, albumin, and a glycosylated protein, carboxypeptidase Y, were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. By using this method, there is unequivocal evidence that intracellular ubiquitinated apoB is glycosylated, because clear glycan staining is seen in the ubiquitinated apoB lane (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). The glycan detection method is specific for glycoproteins; another glycoprotein, carboxypeptidase Y, also shows positive staining, but an unglycosylated protein, albumin, remains unstained. We note that the carbohydrate conjugates are found almost exclusively on the full-length ubiquinated apoB protein, indicating that the full-length glycosylated apoB-100 is a substrate for retrotranslocation and polyubiquitination. A smaller ubiquitinated apoB fragment that is also glycosylated probably represents a proteolytic fragment of apoB. The evidence presented thus far strongly indicates that full-length apoB that has undergone glycosylation, a luminal event in the ER, is the substrate for ubiquitination and proteasome degradation. We also addressed the question whether some of the nascent apoB chains are also targeted for degradation by ubiquitination during translation and prior to completing synthesis of the molecule. ApoB-100 translation in HepG2 cells was synchronized by treatment with puromycin prior to pulse labeling with [35S]methionine. By this technique, only newly initiated apoB polypeptide chains would be labeled. As shown in Fig. 5, nascent apoB chains of sizes ∼220–400 kDa were labeled under these pulse-chase conditions. After purifying the ubiquitinated nascent chains with an anti-ubiquitin antibody and fractionating them on SDS-PAGE, we observed that a proportion of these 35S-labeled nascent polypeptides is ubiquitinated. Therefore, significant ubiquitination occurs on nascent apoB chains during translation. Because we showed above that apoB ubiquitination occurs exclusively in the cytosolic compartment, ubiquitination of these apoB polypeptides must happen cotranslationally before the emerging nascent chain is translocated into the ER. We first reported that the intracellular degradation of apoB-100 in HepG2 cells occurs largely via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, because it has the following characteristics: (i) it is ATP-dependent, (ii) the intracellular apoB destined for intracellular degradation is ubiquitinated, and (iii) proteasome inhibitors inhibit the degradation leading to the accumulation of ubiquitinated apoB (7Yeung S.J. Chen S.-H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These observations were subsequently confirmed and extended by other laboratories (8Fisher E.A.

Benoist and Grand-Perret (17Benoist F. Grand-Perret T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20435-20442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) demonstrated that inhibition of lipid transfer by a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor promotes the degradation of nascent apoB peptides by proteasomes. Chen et al. (9Chen Y. Le Cahérec F. Chuck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11887-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) found that calnexin protects against proteasome-mediated degradation. They also presented experiments that suggest that apoB that has entered the ER far enough to be recognized by the glycosylation machinery may still undergo proteasomal degradation. In this study, we have demonstrated conclusively that the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of apoB affects both incomplete nascent apoB polypeptides cotranslationally as well as the full-length glycosylated apoB protein, which could only have happened to molecules that have completely translocated into the ER. In puromycin-synchronized HepG2 cells, we showed that some nascent partial-length apoB polypeptides are targeted for degradation by ubiquitination during translation before they are translocated into the ER. The evidence for the involvement of proteasomes in the degradation of the incomplete nascent chains corroborates that presented by Benoist and Grand-Perret (17Benoist F. Grand-Perret T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20435-20442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) on microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor-treated cells. Our experiments demonstrate that proteasome-mediated degradation of newly synthesized partial-length apoB peptides during translation occurs also in the absence of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitors. Our observations on the fate of the full-length glycosylated apoB are supported by the study of Chen et al. (9Chen Y. Le Cahérec F. Chuck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11887-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) using [3H]mannose labeling, although they did not show that the mannose-labeled apoB was actually targeted for degradation by ubiquitination. Herein we showed directly that full-length ubiquitinated apoB is glycosylated. We have provided three pieces of evidence for the presence of carbohydrate conjugates on ubiquitinated apoB: (i) ubiquitinated apoB retains its binding affinity to calnexin, a glycoprotein-specific chaperone (20Bergeron J.J.M. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 21Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 22Zapun A. Petrescu S.M. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), an interaction that can be abolished by tunicamycin treatment; (ii) ubiquitinated apoB displays binding to concanavalin A; and (iii) the presence of glycan on ubiquitinated apoB is demonstrated by glycan-specific oxidative staining. The fact that the full-length ubiquitinated apoB has covalently linked carbohydrate indicates that the protein has completely translocated into the ER before it is retrotranslocated back to the cytosol for degradation. Finally, we note that calnexin is a membrane protein of the ER that associates with newly synthesized N-linked glycoproteins (21Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 22Zapun A. Petrescu S.M. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The luminal domain of calnexin binds to glycoproteins only if they are at least monoglucosylated (22Zapun A. Petrescu S.M. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and this lectin-like chaperone is thought to assist the folding and oligomeric assembly of glycoproteins and possibly to prevent premature degradation. Here we showed that if calnexin offers protection of apoB from proteasome-mediated degradation, the protection is incomplete, and ubiquitinated apoB actually has affinity for the chaperone. It is difficult from the available evidence to quantify how much of the apoB tagged for degradation by ubiquitination consists of incomplete nascent chains and how much of it consists of full-length glycosylated apoB protein. As discussed earlier, although concanavalin A only binds to and thus selectively purifies glycosylated apoB that possesses accessible d-glucose and/or d-mannose moieties on the surface, the unbound fraction may be a mixture of unglycosylated and glycosylated apoB polypeptides. Furthermore, glycoproteins in the ER are partially deglycosylated by the action of peptide:N-glycanase, prior to proteolytic degradation in the cytosol (23Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G.

Therefore, the substantially lower amount of glycosylated versus unglycosylated apoB among the ubiquitinated apoB pool observed in these experiments represents an underestimate of the actual amount of the full-length, once fully glycosylated apoB protein that is targeted for proteasome degradation. The partially translated polypeptides and the fully translocated apoB could be transported to the cytosolic compartment for proteasome-mediated degradation via one or more of three possible pathways (Fig. 6): (i) the partially translated nascent polypeptides are mostly cytosolic in location when they are ubiquitinated and are presumably fed into the proteasomes by retrotranslocation through the same translocon in which the nascent chain is partially partitioned; (ii) the fully translocated and fully glycosylated apoB-100 proteins could be retrograde-translocated,i.e. via the same translocon through which they have entered the ER; or (iii) these molecules could have been completely discharged into the lumen of the ER and be translocated back into the cytosol in a retrograde fashion via a different retrotranslocon. Our experiments do not allow us to make a distinction among these possibilities, which will be the subject for future investigations.

They are believed to be heterotetramers consisting of GIRK1 (Kir3.1) and either GIRK2 (Kir3.2), GIRK3 (Kir3.3), or GIRK4 (Kir3.4) subunits. The GIRK1 subunit is hypothesized to be critical to form GIRK channels with normal channel kinetics based on heterologous expression studies. However, GIRK2 and GIRK3 proteins are present in areas of the brain where no GIRK1 has been detected. Here we demonstrate that GIRK tetramers lacking GIRK1 can be purified from bovine heart atria. We have found that only half of GIRK4 is purified as the GIRK1-GIRK4 heterotetramer, whereas the remaining GIRK4 forms a high molecular weight, SDS-resistant complex that does not contain GIRK1. These GIRK4 complexes, most likely GIRK4 homotetramers, were previously not seen because of their aberrant migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. We propose that all of GIRK1 and half of GIRK4 proteins in atria combine to form the heterotetramer IKACh, whereas the remaining GIRK4 forms a novel tetrameric complex.

GIRK1 channels are critical mediators of cell excitability and are the effectors of many G-protein-coupled receptors. In brain, GIRK channels couple to GABAB, 5HT1A, adenosine A1, muscarinic M2, somatostatin, κ opioid and μ opioid receptors (for review see Refs. 1Dascal N. Cell.

Although details are debated, receptor activation apparently leads to both presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibition. In heart, the GIRK channel complex IKAChcouples to the muscarinic M2 and adenosine A1receptors (for review see Refs. 3Wickman K. Clapham D.E. Physiol.

It is believed that native GIRK channels are heterotetramers composed of GIRK1 and either GIRK2, GIRK3, or GIRK4. Four major lines of evidence support this hypothesis: 1) GIRK homotetramers produce either no current or channels with short open times (15Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B.

Specific examples of well defined GIRK heteromultimers occur in the heart where GIRK1 and GIRK4 combine to form IKACh (6Wickman K. Nemec J. Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 687-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) combine to form receptor-activated currents. Here we provide direct biochemical evidence that a significant amount of GIRK4 homotetramers exist in bovine atria. More specifically, we show that a previously undiscovered population of GIRK4 homotetramers coexists with GIRK1-GIRK4 heteromultimers in protein purified from bovine atria. We speculate on the potential functional significance of these putative GIRK4 homotetramers. Bovine atrial plasma membranes were isolated as described (31Slaughter R.S. Sutko J.L. Reeves J.P. J Biol Chem. 1983; 258: 3183-3190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were solubilized in 1.0% CHAPS-HEDN buffer, pH 7.5 (in mm: 10 HEPES, 1 EDTA, 1 dithiothreitol, and 100 NaCl). The protease inhibitors leupeptin (50 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μg/ml), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), and pepstatin (2 μg/ml) (all from Sigma) were used in all experiments. Plasma membrane proteins containing epitope-tagged GIRK1-AU5 and GIRK4-AU1 were isolated from COS-7 cells (32Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Clapham D.E. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Solubilization was performed as described above for the native atrial membrane proteins. For the GIRK4 immunoprecipitation, protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was pre-incubated with 3 μg of anti-GIRK4 antibodies (anti-CIRN2) (15Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). After 30 min of pre-incubation, solubilized proteins from a single 100-mm GIRK4-transfected dish of cells were added and incubated at 4 °C for 150 min. The protein A-Sepharose·antibody·GIRK4 complexes were washed 5 × 1 ml with immunoprecipitation buffer (1% CHAPS, 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), and the GIRK4 was eluted with 1 mg/ml CIRN2 antigenic peptide for 150 min at 22 °C with 3 eluate exchanges. For the anti-GIRK1 immunoprecipitation, solubilized membrane proteins from COS-7 cells transfected with GIRK1 were added to protein A-Sepharose and a 1:50 dilution of ascites fluid containing AU5 monoclonal antibodies (BabCO, Berkeley Antibody Co., Richmond, CA) and incubated at 4 °C for 150 min. The protein A-Sepharose·antibody·GIRK1 complexes were washed 5 × 1 ml with immunoprecipitation buffer. GIRK1 was eluted with 0.25 mg/ml AU5 antigenic peptide at 22 °C with 3 × 100 μl eluate exchanges for 1 h each. Protein to be cross-linked was treated for 1 h on ice with 100 mm dithiothreitol and dialyzed against 1% CHAPS, 10 mm HEPES, 400 mmNaCl, pH 8.5 (cross-linking buffer). To block free sulfhydryl groups, dialyzed aliquots were treated with 25 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma) for 1 h on ice. Typical reaction volumes were 15 μl for the solubilized atrial membrane proteins and 75 μl for the recombinant protein. Increasing the reaction volumes >10-fold had no effect on the adducts formed. Approximately 10 μg of crude solubilized atrial protein or 10 μg of solubilized COS-7 membrane protein was used in each reaction. For cross-linking studies, a solution containing 5 mm3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP, Pierce) was prepared as a 10× stock solution immediately before use. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 1 h on ice and then terminated for 30 min with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. For anti-GIRK4 antibody immunodepletion, between 0.025 and 0.4 μg of anti-GIRK4 peptide antibody (anti-CIRN2, generated against amino acids 19–32) was used to immunoprecipitate approximately 10 μg of atrial membrane proteins for 150 min at 4 °C. 10-μl aliquots of the supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For anti-GIRK1 immunoprecipitation, between 0.1 and 2.0 μl of anti-GIRK1 fusion protein antibodies (anti-Csh serum, generated against the last 156 amino acids of GIRK1) were used to immunoprecipitate approximately 10 μg of atrial membrane proteins overnight at 4 °C. Before immunoprecipitation, anti-GIRK1 antibodies were preincubated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 120 min and washed 4 times with 1-ml volumes of immunoprecipitation buffer. 15-μl (of 90 μl total immunoprecipitation volumes) aliquots of supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. Size exclusion chromatography was performed as described previously (27Corey S. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Unless specified otherwise, atrial membrane proteins or recombinant GIRK protein was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mmdithiothreitol for 15 min at 50 °C, 30 min at room temperature, and 15 min at 50 °C. 3–10% separating, 3% stacking, and precast 2–15% gels were utilized. Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-GIRK1 antibodies (generated against amino acids 1–22) and/or anti-GIRK4 antibodies. Transfer times for Western blot analysis were extended to >2 h at 15 V to improve transfer of the complexes. When sequential probing with antibodies was necessary, polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) were stripped with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 45 min at 50 °C. A GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad) was used to analyze the protein gels and immunoblots. Molecular weights were calculated using densitometry profiles from a combination of prestained high molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) and low and high molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In a portion of the gels, thyrogloblin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to ensure linearity through at least 330 kDa. Special Laemmli sample buffer conditions described in (Fig. 1 ) were as follows. For urea-treated samples, urea was added directly to the sample buffer to a final concentration of 8m. For NaCl-treated samples, the sample buffer was adjusted to contain a final concentration of 400 mm NaCl. Finally, in the trichloroacetic acid treated samples, the solubilized atrial membrane proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 5 min and washed before the addition of the sample buffer. Native atrial membrane proteins were analyzed by 2–15% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted (Fig. 1). Antibodies generated against amino acids 19–32 of GIRK4 (anti-CIRN2) (9Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L.

In control experiments, neither the ∼45-kDa protein nor the ∼200-kDa protein was recognized by anti-GIRK4 (anti-CIRN2) antibodies if the antibodies were preincubated with antigenic peptide (data not shown). The ∼45-kDa protein is GIRK4 (15Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), whereas the ∼200-kDa protein band has not been previously described. In addition, the ∼200-kDa protein (or protein complex) was detected by a second anti-GIRK4 antibody generated against amino acids 337–420 (fusion), verifying that the ∼200-kDa band contained GIRK4 (Fig. 1 C). Because of its high molecular weight, it is likely that the −200-kDa protein band was lost during traditional SDS-PAGE analysis of heart membranes. In previous studies it is possible that the ∼200-kDa protein band may have failed to migrate out of stacking gels, which are normally removed before blotting. Alternatively, the ∼200-kDa protein band may have transferred poorly during immunoblotting or been mistaken for antibody. After stripping and reprobing the immunoblot with anti-GIRK1 antibodies, we observed bands at ∼55- and ∼60–75-kDa, which represent GIRK1 and glycosylated GIRK1, respectively (15Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). The ∼200-kDa band was not recognized by anti-GIRK1 antibodies, indicating that it did not contain GIRK1 protein. We considered the possibility that the ∼200-kDa band was the result of unknown protein (of ∼155 kDa) associating with GIRK4 via a disulfide bond. However, the mobility of the ∼200-kDa band was not altered by high concentrations of reducing reagents (100 mmdithiothreitol, or 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, data not shown). In addition, the mobility of the ∼200-kDa band was not altered by treatment with high salt concentrations or urea, which reduces aggregation of membrane proteins (34Soulie S. Moller J.V. Falson P. le Maire M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 363-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). Trichloroacetic acid precipitation was the only method that altered the ∼200-kDa band. Trichloroacetic acid treatment either shifted the ∼200-kDa band to ∼45-kDa or failed to precipitate its components. We could not distinguish between these two possibilities because the GIRK4 monomer band is always observed at ∼45 kDa. It has previously been reported that all GIRK4 is associated with GIRK1 in heart to form the heterotetramer IKACh. Because the ∼200-kDa GIRK4-containing complex was previously not seen, we examined whether GIRK4 in this complex was associated with GIRK1. To address this question, atrial sarcolemmal membranes were solubilized in 1% CHAPS and immunodepleted with increasing concentrations of anti-GIRK1 antibodies. The supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted simultaneously with anti-GIRK1 and anti-GIRK4 antibodies (Fig. 2 A). Remarkably, all of the ∼45-kDa GIRK4 coimmunoprecipitated with GIRK1, whereas the ∼200-kDa GIRK4-containing complex did not. This indicates that the ∼200-kDa GIRK4-containing complex is not associated with GIRK1. Consequently, the GIRK4 in this ∼200-kDa complex is probably not IKACh, because IKACh is most likely a heterotetramer composed of both GIRK1 and GIRK4 (15Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K.

Stripping and reprobing the blot with anti-GIRK1 antibodies alone confirmed that the ∼200-kDa complex does not contain GIRK1 (Fig. 2 B). By trichloroacetic acid-precipitating the GIRK1-immunodepleted aliquots before SDS-PAGE analysis, we were able to shift at least a portion of the ∼200-kDa complex to 45 kDa (compare Fig. 2, C and D), consistent with a disruption of the complex into individual components. In addition to the immunodepletion experiments, partial purification of IKACh confirmed that the ∼200-kDa complex was not associated with GIRK1. The ∼45-kDa GIRK4 and all of the GIRK1 bound a wheat germ agglutinin affinity column, whereas the ∼200-kDa GIRK4-containing complex did not (27Corey S. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J.

We carried out immunodepletion experiments using anti-GIRK4 antibodies to assess whether all of GIRK1 was associated with the 45-kDa GIRK4 protein. Immunodepletion was carried out with increasing concentrations of anti-GIRK4 antibodies. The immunodepleted supernatants were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted simultaneously with anti-GIRK1 and anti-GIRK4 antibodies (Fig. 3). More than 90% of GIRK1 coimmunoprecipitated with GIRK4. Taken together, the anti-GIRK1 and anti-GIRK4 immunodepletion experiments indicate that GIRK1 and the 45-kDa GIRK4 are associated with each other in a heterotetrameric GIRK1-GIRK4 complex. Conversely, the ∼200-kDa GIRK4 is part of a novel complex that does not contain GIRK1. Three aliquots of solubilized atrial membrane proteins were analyzed by 2–15% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The first aliquot was left untreated and served as a loading control (Fig. 4, control). The second aliquot was immunodepleted with anti-GIRK1 antibodies alone (Fig. 4,αGIRK1 super). The third aliquot was immunodepleted with anti-GIRK1 antibodies followed by anti-GIRK4 antibodies (Fig. 4,αGIRK4 super). Finally, the remaining anti-GIRK4 antibody-antigen complex from the third aliquot was eluted with anti-GIRK4 antigenic peptide (Fig. 4, αGIRK4 eluate). As demonstrated by ProA/serum-only controls, the band labeled antibody (Ab) was derived from the crude anti-GIRK1 serum (data not shown). We tested whether a complex similar to the ∼200-kDa complex in native heart cells could be isolated from the COS-7 cell expression system. COS-7 cells were transfected with either GIRK1 or GIRK4 and their membranes were isolated and solubilized in buffer containing 1% CHAPS. The solubilized membrane protein was immunoprecipitated with its corresponding antibody (anti-GIRK1 antibodies for the GIRK1-transfected cells or anti-GIRK4 antibodies for the GIRK4-transfected cells) and eluted with antigenic peptide. The eluates containing purified GIRK1 (Fig. 5, lane 1 ) or GIRK4 (Fig. 5, lane 2) were analyzed by 3–10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-GIRK1 antibodies (Fig. 5, lanes 1and 2). The same blot was then stripped and reprobed with anti-GIRK4 antibodies (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4). A complex similar to the native atrial ∼200-kDa-GIRK4-containing complex formed in COS-7 cells transfected with GIRK4, but not in cells transfected with GIRK1. The recombinant GIRK4 complex was less stable than the native complex and did not require trichloroacetic acid precipitation for partial disruption. The ratio of the ∼200-kDa GIRK4-containing complex to the ∼45-kDa GIRK4 monomer varied between trials. Cotransfection with GIRK1 and GIRK4 reduced the proportion of ∼200-kDa GIRK4 (data not shown). Taken together, this data indicates that the native ∼200-kDa GIRK4-containing complex may be composed solely of GIRK4 We hypothesized that the ∼200-kDa GIRK4-containing complex was a homotetramer composed solely of GIRK4 because it was not associated with GIRK1, occurred in COS-7 cells transfected solely with GIRK4, and had a molecular weight appropriate for a GIRK4 homotetramer. To test this hypothesis, we chemically cross-linked recombinant GIRK4 into tetramers. A similar procedure was used to demonstrate that expression of GIRK1 alone, GIRK4 alone, or GIRK4-GIRK1 together in COS-7 cells resulted in tetramer formation (27Corey S. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). By SDS-PAGE analysis, we compared the migration of the chemically cross-linked GIRK4 homotetramers to the migration of the native ∼200-kDa GIRK4-containing complex. COS-7 cells were transfected with GIRK4, and their membranes were isolated. An aliquot of COS-7 cell membranes was chemically cross-linked with DTSSP and analyzed by SDS-PAGE alongside native atrial membrane proteins. The gel was immunoblotted and probed with anti-GIRK4 antibodies (Fig. 6). The ∼200-kDa GIRK4-containing complex from native atrial cells and the chemically cross-linked GIRK4 homotetramers migrated identically. The simplest interpretation of this data is that the native ∼200-kDa GIRK4 complex is a GIRK4 homotetramer. To ensure that the ∼200-kDa GIRK4-containing complex was a homotetramer and not an SDS-PAGE artifact, we analyzed freshly solubilized atrial membranes by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 7). The putative GIRK4 homotetramers eluted slightly after the GIRK1-GIRK4 heterotetramers. The computed molecular weight difference between the two complexes was 35-kDa. A GIRK4 homotetramer is ∼30-kDa smaller than a GIRK1-GIRK4 heterotetramer. Thus this result is consistent with our hypothesis. However, caution must be taken when interpreting this data, because detergent binding can alter the perceived molecular weight of the GIRK complexes. Unlike the GIRK4 homotetramers, a small portion of the GIRK1-GIRK4 heterotetramers eluted just after the void volume of the size exclusion chromatography column. This portion of GIRK1-GIRK4 heterotetramers may be associated with a novel protein or proteins. Here we describe purification of an SDS-resistant, GIRK4-containing tetrameric protein complex from heart membranes. The complex could not be dissociated with high reducing agent concentrations, urea, mild heating, or high salt concentrations. Trichloroacetic acid precipitation, however, consistently disrupted the complex. High thermal and detergent stability is not uncommon for membrane proteins (36Haltia T. Freire E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1228: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 37Heginbotham L. Odessey E. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10335-10342Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 38Arkin I.T.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12719-12725Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). A number of ion channels with structures similar to GIRK4 are heat and SDS-resistant (37Heginbotham L. Odessey E.

Acta. 1998; 1369: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This heat and detergent resistance is because of the extreme stability of α-helices in nonpolar environments (36Haltia T. Freire E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1228: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 39Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 12950-12955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on structure prediction algorithms, a search of the GIRK4 primary sequence revealed no tendency to form coiled-coil interactions (41Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the KcsA K+ channel of Streptomyces lividans has similar detergent stability, which was reported to aid in its crystallization (37Heginbotham L. Odessey E. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10335-10342Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 42Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5769) Google Scholar). Further study of the SDS-resistant complex confirmed that it contained GIRK4. The complex was recognized by two different antibodies generated against separate regions of GIRK4, and the GIRK4-containing complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-GIRK4 antibodies. In contrast, neither anti-GIRK4 antibodies that were blocked with antigenic peptide, nor anti-GIRK1 antibodies recognized the SDS-resistant complex. These results indicate that this complex does not contain GIRK1 and that the anti-GIRK4 antibody binding is specific. Also, the trichloroacetic acid-disruptible, GIRK4-containing complex is absent in GIRK4 knockout mice, again indicating that the SDS-resistant complex contains GIRK4 (6Wickman K. Nemec J. Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The GIRK4 contained in this SDS-resistant complex was not associated with GIRK1. The GIRK4-containing complex did not coimmunoprecipitate with anti-GIRK1 antibodies and did not bind a wheat germ agglutinin affinity column. Also, we demonstrated that all of the GIRK1 and the ∼45-kDa GIRK4 were associated with each other. This indicates that the SDS-resistant GIRK4-containing complex is novel, whereas the GIRK1 and the low molecular weight GIRK4 together form IKACh. IKACh is a GIRK1-GIRK4 heterotetramer, most likely composed of two GIRK1 subunits and two GIRK4 subunits (27Corey S. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 35Silverman S.K. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1996; 271: H379-H385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An SDS-resistant GIRK4-containing complex, similar to that found in native atrial cells, could be isolated from COS-7 cells transfected with GIRK4. We have shown that recombinant chemically cross-linked GIRK4 homotetramers and the native GIRK4-containing complex migrated identically on SDS-PAGE gels. Also, the GIRK4-containing complex eluted as a GIRK4 homotetramer from a size exclusion chromatography column. The simplest interpretation of our data is that the native ∼200-kDa GIRK4-containing complex is a GIRK4 homotetramer. A GIRK subunit, other than GIRK4, could make up a portion of this putative GIRK4 tetramer. However, this would require the unknown GIRK subunit to be the same molecular weight as GIRK4. Northern blots consistently indicate that GIRK1 and GIRK4 are the only known GIRK subunits expressed in atria (6Wickman K. Nemec J. Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 44Lesage F. Duprat F. Fink M. Guillemare E. Coppola T. Lazdunski M. Hugnot J.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the putative GIRK4 homomultimer could contain a combination of GIRK4 splice variants, although such GIRK4 splice variants have not been described. It seems unlikely that the putative GIRK4 homotetramers are an artifact of the protein isolation procedure. GIRK4 homotetramers were observed whether atrial membranes were analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE or first solubilized in CHAPS-containing buffer. In addition, GIRK4 subunits from native GIRK1-GIRK4 heterotetramers did not dissociate to form GIRK4 homotetramers, because this would require an equivalent number of GIRK1 subunits to exist as dissociated monomers or GIRK1 homotetramers. Immunodepletion experiments indicated that >90% of GIRK1 is associated with GIRK4. Also, we never observed GIRK4 homotetramers in our purified GIRK1-GIRK4 heterotetramer preparations, even after long incubation times (27Corey S. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Overall, the data presented here indicates that approximately half of GIRK4 in atria exists as homomultimers, whereas the other half is a component of the GIRK1-GIRK4 heterotetramer, IKACh(Fig. 8). Also, our size exclusion chromatography experiments indicate that the GIRK1-GIRK4 heterotetramer, unlike the GIRK4 homomultimer, may be associated with an additional protein(s). Because this additional protein(s) is only associated with the GIRK1-GIRK4 heterotetramer, this association is most likely conferred by the GIRK1 subunit of the GIRK1-GIRK4 hetrotetramer. Our findings raise a number of questions. How do GIRK4 homomultimers coexist with GIRK4-GIRK1 heteromultimers in the same tissue? It will be interesting to determine if these two populations of channels occur in the same atrial myocytes or if they occur in separate regions of the atria. The GIRK4 homomultimers may even be derived from the nervous tissue innervating heart (45Iizuka M. Kubo Y. Tsunenari I. Pan C.X. Akiba I. Kono T. Receptors Channels. 1995; 3: 299-315PubMed Google Scholar). If GIRK1-GIRK4 heteromultimers and GIRK4 homomultimers occur in the same cells, do they localize to the same subcellular compartments? GIRK homomultimers and heteromultimers could be activated by different G-protein-coupled receptors. Most importantly, what is the physiologic function of GIRK4 homomultimers? Do they function as channels or have they been adapted for some alternative use? Generally, the heterologous expression of GIRK4 homomultimers results in currents that do not resemble previously described myocardial currents. Large whole cell currents with long single channel open times were reported for recombinant GIRK4 homomultimers (14Ji S. John S.A. Lu Y. Weiss J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1324-1328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but the long single channel open times differ from those described previously by others (15Krapivinsky G.

In heterologous expression systems, a factor or an accessory subunit normally present in native tissue may be absent. GIRK channels are modulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (10Huang C.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1324-1328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and potentially by phosphorylation. Conceivably, the GIRK4 homomultimeric channel may require cell-to-cell contact or an extracellular matrix component for activation, a condition seldom tested when recording from patches. GIRKs, unlike other inwardly rectifying K+ channels, contain a sequence in their extracellular domains that is associated with integrin binding (RGD) (1Dascal N. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This sequence is usually found in extracellular matrix proteins. Alternatively, GIRK4 homomultimers may be inhibited by traditional patch clamp configurations (14Ji S. John S.A. Lu Y. Weiss J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1324-1328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In any case, these findings should renew interest in the expression and existence of GIRK tetramers that do not contain GIRK1. Purkinje cells and basket cells of cerebellum, the substantia nigra, the inferior olivary nuclei, and solitary nucleus of the brainstem contain GIRK subunits but may not contain GIRK1 (21Dissmann E.

Also, because of the anomalous migration of GIRK4 homomultimers on Western blots, the GIRK4 content of many tissues may have been underestimated. Thus, GIRK tetramers without GIRK1 may be physiologically relevant, but proof of their function will require further experimentation.

To preserve an organism's genetic integrity, several DNA repair pathways have evolved. One pathway of particular importance is DNA base excision repair (BER),1because the types of lesions it addresses are among the most common. Typical lesions include alkylated, oxidized, or deaminated base moieties that are removed during the initiating step by a family of enzymes called DNA N-glycosylases (for review see Ref. 1Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). This enzyme family is subdivided into two categories, bifunctional and monofunctional, and each member is specific to certain monobasic lesions. Bifunctional glycosylases release not only the damaged base but also cleave the DNA backbone on the 3′ side of the just formed baseless residue by utilizing an inherent AP lyase activity. In such instances, the 3′-terminal baseless sugar phosphate residue is further processed by a class II AP endonuclease, because this enzyme has both 3′-phosphodiesterase and 3′-phosphatase activities (for review see Ref.2Doetsch P.W. Cunningham R.P. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 173-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The resulting gap in the DNA is eventually filled, and the adjacent strands are then ligated to complete repair. Monofunctional glycosylases, however, release just the damaged base, creating a different type of DNA lesion: an abasic site. Internal abasic sites are also created by spontaneous release of purines under physiological conditions, so this newly created lesion is quite common, occurring an estimated 9000–10,000 lesions/cell/day (3Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3610-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 4Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4338) Google Scholar, 5Nakamura J. Walker V.E. Upton P.B. Chiang S.Y. Kow Y.W. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 222-225PubMed Google Scholar). These abasic sites are also handled by a class II AP endonuclease that cleaves on the 5′ side of the baseless residue, creating a 3′ terminus that supports primer extension (2Doetsch P.W. Cunningham R.P. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 173-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). During the final steps of this pathway, the baseless sugar phosphate residue must be removed from the 5′ terminus of the downstream strand so that both strands can be properly ligated. Two different mechanisms for removal of the abasic lesion in higher eukaryotes have recently emerged. In short patch base excision repair, a DNA polymerase β-mediated β-elimination reaction removes the abasic lesion as a monomer residue (6Matsumoto Y. Kim K.

The resulting one-nucleotide gap is then filled, and the strands are ligated. However, additional biochemical evidence reveals that more than just the abasic residue is often released (12Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In this alternative mechanism, known as long patch BER, the offending lesion is removed as part of a small oligonucleotide. We have previously shown that in combination with partial displacement of the lesion bearing strand, FEN1 nuclease can participate in the latter mechanism (15DeMott M.S. Shen B. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. Zigman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30068-30076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To efficiently remove the 5′-terminal abasic lesion, the first annealed nucleotide must be displaced. This allows the flap structure-specific nuclease to cleave endonucleolytically between two intact residues (15DeMott M.S. Shen B. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. Zigman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30068-30076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). More recently, several groups have confirmed a role for FEN1 nuclease in long patch BER (11Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 16Kim K.

For the current study, we reconstituted the final steps of long patch base excision repair in vitro using calf DNA polymerase ε to provide strand displacement synthesis, human FEN1, and human DNA ligase I. We then examined the effect of replication protein A (RPA) on completion of repair. RPA is a heterotrimeric single-stranded DNA-binding protein that is known to participate in DNA replication and repair (for review see Ref.17Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). It has been implicated in forms of excision repair other than BER (18Lin Y.L. Shivji M.K. Chen C. Kolodner R. Wood R.D. Dutta A.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5955-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and to interact with an early component of base excision repair: uracil glycosylase (21Nagelhus T.A. Haug T. Singh K.K.

In addition, some yeast mutants defective in the homologous RFA1 gene are sensitive to methyl methane-sulfonate (22Umezu K. Sugawara N. Chen C. Haber J.E. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1998; 148: 989-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a reagent that causes DNA damage often repaired by the BER pathway.

Recombinant human DNA ligase I was overexpressed as described previously (25Teraoka H. Minami H. Iijima S. Tsukada K. Koiwai O. Date T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24156-24162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified using DEAE-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); SP-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); Bio-Gel HTP hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad); and Heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fractions from each chromatographic step were tested for ligase activity and analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with either Coomassie Blue or silver. Active fractions were pooled for subsequent purification procedures, the details of which will be specified at a later time. For all recombinant proteins, final preparations were 90–95% pure according to analysis by SDS-PAGE stained with silver. Purified proteins were dialyzed into a storage buffer (30 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 15% sucrose, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA) and stored at −80 °C. Calf DNA polymerase ε was also prepared as described previously (26Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15136-15141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments using nonradioactive substrates with an abasic lesion at the 5′ terminus of the downstream primer, a 73-mer oligonucleotide (P73) (see Table I) with an internal deoxyuridine was annealed to the template (T73). Proper annealing allowed two residues to overhang at both 3′ ends to prevent degradation of the substrate by exonuclease III during initial preparation (not shown) and to distinguish base excision repair products from DNA synthesis run-off products during analysis. The uracil base was removed using uracil-DNA-glycosylase at 37 °C for 120 min. The substrate was then incubated at 37 °C with 3.3 units of exonuclease III for 12 min to specifically cleave on the 5′ side of the internal deoxyribose-5-phosphate residue, because this enzyme is a class II AP endonuclease. Under the conditions used, which included 8 mm CaCl2 instead of MgCl2, the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of exonuclease III was inhibited, so the newly created upstream primer was not further degraded. This formed the starting substrate (see Fig. 1 A) used in the experiments depicted in Fig. 1 (B and C), and Fig. 2. After 12 min, exonuclease III was removed by sedimenting the substrate through a Micropure™ EZ column (Millipore). A control experiment confirmed that exonuclease III is completely removed by the minicolumn procedure (15DeMott M.S. Shen B. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. Zigman S. J. Biol.

The labeled oligomer was annealed to a complementary 73-mer template (T73) along with a 31-mer oligonucleotide (P31) (see Table I) that annealed immediately upstream of the labeled 42-mer. This labeled duplex was used for control reactions that utilized a substrate with an intact residue at the 5′ terminus of the downstream primer (see Fig. 3 B, lanes 12 and 13). For reactions using substrates with an abasic lesion at the 5′ terminus (see Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–7 and 14–16), the labeled duplex was further processed as follows: The upstream and downstream strands were ligated using T4 DNA ligase. The resulting 73-mer with an internal, 5′-labeled deoxyuridine was gel purified and reannealed to the 73-mer template (T73). The substrate was stored at −20 °C until use. For each experiment, a small aliquot was removed from storage and further prepared as follows. The uracil base was removed using uracil-DNA-glycosylase at 37 °C for 120 min. The substrate was then incubated at 37 °C with 3.3 units of exonuclease III for 12 min to cleave specifically on the 5′ side of the deoxyribose-5-phosphate residue. As above, the newly created upstream primer was not further degraded. After 12 min, exonuclease III was removed by sedimenting the substrate through a Micropure™ EZ column (Millipore). TLC on a poly(ethyleneimine) cellulose plate (see Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 2) confirmed that the minicolumn did not disrupt the labile 5′-terminal abasic residue. The residue remained attached to the downstream primer for subsequent experiments. Each reaction (12.5 μl) contained 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, approximately 125 fmol of a cold or 80 fmol of a radiolabeled DNA substrate, 10 pmol ATP, 1.33 pmol of either [α-32P]dATP or [α-32P]dCTP, 5 pmol of the other three cold dNTPs, and various combinations of calf DNA polymerase ε (15 ng, ∼5.7 nm), human FEN1 nuclease (11.3 ng, ∼20.5 nm), human DNA ligase I (3.3 ng, ∼ 2.0 nm), and human replication protein A. The applicable proteins were always added simultaneously to the reaction mix. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min and terminated by adding an equal volume of either 90% (v/v) formamide with bromphenol blue and xylene cyanole markers for gel electrophoresis or chilled 50 mm EDTA for TLC analysis. For experiments using nonradioactive starting substrates (see Fig. 1, B and C, and Fig. 2), reaction products were resolved on a 10% PAGE, 7 m urea sequencing gel. For experiments using 5′-radiolabeled downstream primers with either an intact or an abasic residue at the 5′ terminus (see Fig. 3 B), samples were analyzed by poly(ethyleneimine) cellulose thin layer chromatography (27Randerath K. Randerath E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 12A: 323-347Crossref Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The mobile phase was a mixture of 50% 1.25 m formic acid and 50% 1.25 m sodium formate (pH 3.3). Recent evidence, both biochemical and genetic, has suggested a role for replication protein A in DNA base excision repair. Because RPA is reported to have an intrinsic ability to unwind double-stranded DNA (28Georgaki A. Hubscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3659-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 29Treuner K. Ramsperger U. Knippers R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and to stimulate FEN1 nuclease (20Biswas E.E. Zhu F.X. Biswas S.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5955-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we reasoned that RPA would most likely affect the long patch mode of repair. For this study, we reconstituted the final steps of long patch base excision repair using calf DNA polymerase ε to provide strand displacement synthesis, human FEN1, and human DNA ligase I. We then examined the effect of RPA on completion of repair. For these experiments, a nonradioactive substrate with an abasic lesion at the 5′ terminus of the downstream primer was created as outlined under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1 A). This substrate represents an intermediate DNA structure that occurs during base excision repair in vivo immediately after a class II AP endonuclease has cleaved on the 5′ side of an internal abasic site. To complete repair, the 5′-terminal abasic lesion must be removed, the resulting gap must be filled, and the two strands must be ligated. Incorporation of a specific α-32P-labeled dN, followed by ligation into a full-length product was used to monitor completion of repair. Radiolabeled dNTPs representing either the second (dA) or the third (dC) residues to be added to the upstream primer were employed. Because only the damaged nucleotide is replaced in short patch BER, this strategy highlighted long patch base excision repair by allowing visualization of only repair patch lengths of at least two or three residues. Fig. 1 depicts the results of adding calf DNA polymerase ε alone or combined with human FEN1 and/or human DNA ligase I. Moreover, in each set of reactions, the concentration of replication protein A was either zero or titrated from 22 to 174 nm. In Fig. 1 B, the upstream primer was extended by DNA polymerase ε using [α-32P]dATP and the remaining cold dNTPs. The radioactive dA was first inserted after initial incorporation of a nonradioactive dT, so the upstream primer had to be extended by at least two residues to become visible on the autoradiogram. Lanes 10–13 (Fig. 1 B) reveal the effects of increasing RPA on upstream primer extension. A greater number of extended primers became visible, and the length extended was increased. There was increased run-off synthesis to the end of the template at higher RPA concentrations. During this process, the 5′ terminus of the downstream primer was increasingly displaced, creating a transient unannealed 5′-flap structure in the DNA. This phenomenon, known as strand displacement synthesis, improves the ability of FEN1 to remove 5′-terminal abasic lesions by allowing this structure-specific nuclease to cleave endonucleolytically between two intact residues (15DeMott M.S. Shen B. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. Zigman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30068-30076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Overall, this suggests that RPA assists primer extension and ultimately completion of repair by partially unwinding the 5′ terminus of the downstream strand. Several studies indicate that replication protein A has an intrinsic ability to unwind double-stranded DNA but only at low salt concentrations (28Georgaki A. Hubscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3659-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 29Treuner K. Ramsperger U. Knippers R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B, lanes 3–7, clearly show that when RPA levels were augmented in the presence of calf DNA polymerase ε, human FEN1 nuclease and human DNA ligase I, a distinct product two residues longer than the run-off product, became increasingly evident. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” proper construction of this substrate allowed two residues to overhang at both 3′ ends to distinguish base excision repair products from DNA synthesis run-off products. Therefore, this long product, a 73-mer, resulted from ligation of the extending upstream primer with the original downstream primer after removal of the abasic lesion and at least one additional intact residue. In short, replication protein A stimulated completion of long patch DNA base excision repair. The remaining reaction sets show that when DNA ligase I was excluded, no BER product was evident, only run-off product to the end of the template. It should be noted that the amount of run-off product was always less than suggested by the band density, because each run-off product would contain twelve labeled dA residues, presumably many more than the average BER product. Surprisingly, there was some evidence of a full-length product in the reaction set containing all components but FEN1, especially at higher RPA concentrations (lanes 15–18). One possibility is that the calf DNA polymerase ε preparation was slightly contaminated with calf FEN1 nuclease, because the two proteins are known to co-purify persistently (30Siegal G. Turchi J.J. Myers T.W. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9377-9381Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Alternatively, completion of repair in vitro may sometimes be independent of removal of the 5′-terminal abasic lesion and any other downstream nucleotides. In this scenario RPA would transiently unanneal the 3′ end of the upstream primer. The terminal region would then be susceptible to the 3′ to 5′ proofreading activity of DNA polymerase ε. Primer (P31) (Table I) contains a dA five residues upstream of the 3′ terminus. After incorporation of α-32P-labeled dA at this alternate site, the remaining gap could be filled, and the two strands could be ligated, sealing in the abasic site. Irrespective of the mechanism, if we treat this product as background, PhosphorImager analysis of the RPA-stimulated BER product in lane 7, less the background in lane 18, indicates an 8.7-fold increase over the unstimulated amount in lane 2. In Fig. 1 C, reactions were set up as in Fig. 1 B, except the upstream primer was extended by synthesis using [α-32P]dCTP plus the remaining cold dNTPs. This radioactive nucleotide was first inserted after initial incorporation of first a dT and then dA, both nonradioactive, so the upstream primer had to be extended by at least three residues to become visible.Lanes 10–13 reveal that increasing RPA had the same effect on upstream primer extension as before. In addition, lanes 3–7 again show that increasing RPA in the presence of calf DNA polymerase ε, human FEN1 nuclease, and human DNA ligase I stimulated completion of repair. This result also demonstrated that repair patch lengths extended three residues and perhaps longer, a finding that agrees with other studies that report lengths of two to six nucleotides (12Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9573-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 14Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Unlike in panel B, there was no evidence of a run-off product two residues shorter than the full-length BER product. To explore the possibility that the amount of α-32P-labeled dC used in these reactions was insufficient to accommodate the number of dC residues in the downstream primer, the experiment was repeated with elevated dCTP. However, the results were equivalent (not shown). Given that the run-off product, even when observed as in Fig. 1 B, was always less than suggested by the band density, we conclude that the presence or absence of run-off product in these experiments is of minimal importance. The remaining reaction sets show that when DNA ligase I was excluded, no BER product was evident. As before, there was some evidence of a full-length product in the reaction set where just human FEN1 was excluded, especially at higher RPA concentrations (lanes 15–18). If we again treat this as background, PhosphorImager analysis of the RPA stimulated BER product in lane 7, less the background in lane 18, indicates a 56-fold increase over the unstimulated amount in the lane 2. However, in Fig. 1 C, this is likely an overestimate, because the downstream primer (P42) (Table I) has an additional four dC residues immediately following the first that could contribute to the BER product. Moreover, there are two dC residues just upstream of the abasic lesion that could constitute the background. Therefore, the most conservative estimate of stimulation would first divide the density value assigned to lane 7 by five, and the value assigned tolane 18 by two. This still indicates an 4.5-fold increase over the amount in lane 2. It should be noted that all reactions contained bovine serum albumin (0.25 mg/ml) to exclude the possibility that a simple increase in protein concentration accounted for stimulation of repair by RPA. We also tested whether stimulation resulted merely from the ability of RPA to bind DNA by substituting an analogous DNA-binding protein, E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein. However, an equivalent titration of single-stranded DNA-binding protein simply had no effect on extension of the upstream primer or on completion of repair (not shown). Therefore, some other characteristic of RPA beyond DNA binding is required to stimulate BER. Results from a previous experiment suggest that replication protein A assisted upstream primer extension by partially unwinding the 5′ terminus of the downstream primer and that this contributed to stimulation of repair. As mentioned above, RPA has an inherent ability to unwind double-stranded DNA, but only at low salt concentrations (28Georgaki A. Hubscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3659-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 29Treuner K. Ramsperger U. Knippers R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, to test how dependent stimulation of repair was on salt concentration, we performed an experiment similar to the one outlined in Fig. 1 B. As before, the upstream primer was extended by DNA polymerase ε by synthesis with [α-32P]dATP and the remaining cold dNTPs. Reactions were subdivided into two sets (Fig. 2): one set without RPA (lanes 2–7) and the other with 87 nm RPA (lanes 9–14). Moreover, in each set, potassium chloride was titrated from 0 to 60 mm. Results again confirm that replication protein A stimulated completion of long patch base excision repair. As potassium chloride levels increased in both sets, the amount of BER product remained unchanged, whereas extension of the upstream primer and generation of run-off diminished substantially although not completely. Therefore, the ability of replication protein A to stimulate repair is independent of salt concentration. Interestingly, the stimulation mechanism evidently involves only the first few nucleotides of primer extension and not a general effect on DNA synthesis. This means that the process is more subtle than direct stimulation of the polymerase. The ability to stimulate a DNA polymerase is among the mechanisms proposed to explain a role for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in long patch base excision repair. Recent studies in vitro have demonstrated that immunodepletion of PCNA causes repair patch lengths of two or more residues to disappear in favor of the short patch mode of repair (12Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Moreover, for these longer repair patches to be observed in a standard cell extract repair reaction, the monobasic lesion must be embedded in a circular DNA duplex, presumably because PCNA will slide off a linear substrate (13Biade S.

It has been known for some time that a cell's interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM)1 can have profound effects on cell division, differentiation, and survival. Interactions between cells and the ECM are mediated predominantly by heterodimeric transmembrane proteins known as integrins (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar, 2Gille J. Swerlick R.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 797: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It has become increasingly clear that integrins not only mediate the physical attachment of cells to ECM but also generate a variety of signals that communicate the status of this attachment to the interior of the cell (3Aplin A.E. Howe A.K. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 197-263PubMed Google Scholar, 4Clark E.A. Brugge J.S.

Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). These signals can regulate a variety of cellular functions, including cell morphology and motility, apoptosis, differentiation, and cell growth and division (3Aplin A.E. Howe A.K. Alahari S.K.

Among the signals generated by integrin-mediated cell adhesion is activation of the canonical MAPK cascade (7Chen Q. Lin T.H. Der C.J. Juliano R.L. J. Biol.

The mechanism of activation of this cascade in response to mitogens such as peptide growth factors has been delineated in great detail (13Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). It involves dimerization and autophosphorylation of the growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), recruitment of an adaptor protein-guanine nucleotide exchange factor complex (e.g. GRB2-mSOS), and GTP loading and activation of small GTPase Ras (14Downward J. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 87-100PubMed Google Scholar). Ras binds the serine/threonine kinase Raf (15Marshall M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and recruits it to the membrane, where it is activated by a complex and as yet unresolved mechanism (16Cutler R.E. Morrison D.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Once activated, Raf phosphorylates and activates MEK (MAPK/extracellular signal-regulatedkinase), which in turn phosphorylates and activates MAPK. While integrin-mediated activation of the MAPK cascade has been reported by several groups, the mechanism(s) through which this occurs is currently somewhat controversial. The events immediately upstream of MAPK seem clear; both Raf-1 and MEK are activated by integrin-mediated adhesion (7Chen Q. Lin T.H. Der C.J. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18122-18127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 17King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4406-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), and MEK activity is required for integrin-mediated MAPK activation (7Chen Q. Lin T.H. Der C.J. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18122-18127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, the events upstream of Raf are less clear. On one hand, integrin-mediated Raf activation may occur through a pathway that is essentially a recapitulation of the canonical growth factor-activated pathway. Thus, integrin engagement induces autophosphosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase pp125FAK, which may serve as a surrogate RTK domain and point of purchase for adaptor protein exchange factor complexes (10Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar,18Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13189-13195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In this model, integrin-mediated activation of the Raf/MEK/MAPK cascade is dependent on both pp125FAK and Ras. Indeed, several groups have demonstrated that expression of dominant negative Ras (RasN17) can inhibit integrin-mediated MAPK activation (17King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N.

However, our laboratory and others have demonstrated that integrin-mediated MAPK activation can occur independently of pp125FAK (21Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Furthermore, work from our laboratory has provided evidence for a Ras-independent component of integrin-mediated MAPK activation (7Chen Q. Lin T.H. Der C.J. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18122-18127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Specifically, a level of expression of RasN17 sufficient to block signaling from a constitutively active mSOS exchange factor was unable to inhibit integrin-mediated activation of MEK (7Chen Q. Lin T.H. Der C.J. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18122-18127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Also, expression of an amino-terminal fragment of Raf-1 (amino acids 23–284) containing the Ras binding site (24Brtva T.R. Drugan J.K. Ghosh S. Terrell R.S. Campbell-Burk S. Bell R.M. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9809-9812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) blocked the activation of the MAPK pathway by oncogenic Ras (RasV12) but not by integrin-mediated cell adhesion (7Chen Q. Lin T.H. Der C.J. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18122-18127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In this report, we focus on the mechanism of activation of Raf-1 by integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Our results show that integrin-mediated activation of Raf-1 seems to comprise two phases: an early phase that is enhanced or optimized by membrane localization and is independent of protein kinase C (PKC) activity and a later, sustained phase that is independent of Ras-Raf association but is blocked by inhibitors of PKC. NIH3T3 fibroblasts were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmids encoding various myc-tagged Raf-1 alleles (pEFHm-Raf-WT, -Raf-R89L, -Raf-R89L-CAAX, and -Raf-K375M) were a kind gift from Drs. Richard Marais and Christopher Marshall (25Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). A plasmid encoding oncogenic Ras (pZIP-RasV12) was originally obtained from Dr. Channing Der. For transfections, cells were seeded at 3 × 105cells/well in six-well (35-mm diameter) plates (Falcon Corp.) or 1 × 106 cells/60-mm dish and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Complexes containing 8 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2 μg of plasmid DNA (unless otherwise noted) were formed and applied to cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. For transfection of cells in 60-mm dishes, 25 μl of LipofectAMINE and 5 μg of plasmid were used. Cells were grown to confluence (usually 24–36 h after transfection), refed with serum-free DMEM, and harvested for specific applications as described below. Plastic Petri dishes (Corning) were coated in an overnight incubation at room temperature with 25 μg/ml human fibronectin (Fn; Collaborative Biochemicals) or 5 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (2 ml/60-mm dish; 5 ml/100-mm dish). Plates were washed once with PBS and once with sterile, deionized water before use. Serum-starved cells were trypsinized, resuspended in DMEM containing 2% bovine serum albumin (lipid- and globulin-free; Sigma), and 2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Life Technologies), collected by brief centrifugation, and washed once with DMEM, 2% BSA. Cells were incubated in suspension in DMEM, 2% BSA at 37OC with gentle rotation for 1 h and then transferred to coated plates for the indicated times or kept in suspension for an equivalent time. Cells were then harvested for the appropriate analysis as described in the figure legends and below. In some instances, rather than being harvested by trypsinization, serum-starved cells were stimulated with TPA (100 nm, 10 min) as controls. Note that cells were replated onto Fn-coated plates at a density no greater than 30% confluence to minimize cell-cell contact. PKC activity was inhibited using either calphostin C or bisindolylmaleimide (BIM) (LC Laboratories). Calphostin C was activated by exposure to room light for 30 min at room temperature before use. Cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM containing the indicated amounts of the inhibitors or in 0.1% (v/v) Me2SO as a control, for either 12–16 h (long term treatment) or 1 h (short term treatment) before harvesting. For long term treatments, inhibitors or Me2SO were present in all media (except for trypsin) throughout a given experiment. For short term treatments, inhibitor or Me2SO was added to the cells at the beginning of their incubation in suspension. To prevent actin filament assembly, cytochalasin D was added at a concentration of 2 μm to cells in suspension 45 min before replating. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in an appropriate volume of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (25 mmTris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol) or Triton lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (PMSF/aprotinin/pepstatin and sodium orthovanadate/sodium fluoride, respectively). Dishes were scraped, and lysates were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, which were then vortexed and incubated on ice for 10 min. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 OC, and the clarified lysates were used for determination of protein concentration and subsequent steps. For Western blot analysis, 10–20 μg of cell extract or one-tenth the total volume of an immunoprecipitation complex were mixed with the appropriate volume of 4× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide for Raf, 10% for MEK and MAPK, 12% for Ras), and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibodies against Raf-1 (sc-133 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or R19120 (Transduction Laboratories); 1:1000), MEK1 and -2 (M17030 (Transduction Laboratories), 1:1000), Ras (Y13–259 (Calbiochem), 1:250), or MAPK (sc-154 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 OC. After extensive washing, membranes were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse (1:2000) or goat anti-rabbit (1:5000) Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and washed again, and immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ras-Raf co-immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described (26Finney R. Herrera D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), using 2.5–3.0 mg of cellular protein for each experimental point. For kinase assays, cell extracts (200–800 μg) were incubated with one of the antibodies described above (or 9E10 (Berkeley Antibody Company) for myc-tagged Raf proteins), using 1 μg of antibody for every 100 μg of cellular protein, for 2 h at 4 OC, and then with 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose for an additional 30 min. MAPK immunocomplexes were washed twice with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer; once with 100 mm Tris, pH 8.6, 500 mmLiCl; and once with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). MEK immunocomplexes were washed three times with Triton lysis buffer and once in kinase buffer. myc-tagged Raf immunocomplexes were washed three times with Triton lysis buffer and twice with Raf kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm ATP). Immunocomplexes were then incubated in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) and the appropriate substrate (5 μg of myelin basic protein for MAPK assays, 2 μg of kinase-dead MAPK for MEK assays, or 0.5 μg of kinase-dead MEK for Raf assays) for 30 min at room temperature. In some instances, Raf activity was assayed in a linked assay containing 0.1 μg of inactive MEK plus 1 μg of kinase-dead MAPK. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 40 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 2–5 min. Reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized from the stained, dried gel either by autoradiography or by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Quantitation of substrate phosphorylation was performed using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Although Ras plays an important role in the activation of Raf by growth factors, its role in integrin-mediated signaling is a point of contention. It is firmly established that Ras and Raf form a stable complex and that this direct interaction is required for Ras-mediated Raf activation (15Marshall M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Cutler R.E. Morrison D.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). However, preliminary co-immunoprecipitation experiments failed to demonstrate a significant increase in Raf-Ras association upon integrin-mediated adhesion. 2A. Howe and R. Juliano, unpublished observations. To more directly address the question of whether interaction with Ras is required for integrin-mediated activation of Raf-1, cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding either wild-type Raf (Raf-WT) or a mutant allele containing an arginine to leucine substitution at position 89, within the Ras binding domain (Raf-R89L) (25Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). This single point mutation eliminates Raf interaction with Ras and renders Raf refractory to activation by Ras (27Dent P. Reardon D.B. Morrison D.K. Sturgill T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4125-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The inability of Ras to activate the R89L mutant was confirmed by co-transfection of Raf plasmids with increasing amounts of a plasmid encoding the activated, oncogenic Ras allele RasV12 (Fig. 1 A). Immunoprecipitation of the transfected, epitope-tagged kinase showed that the wild-type Raf was robustly activated by oncogenic Ras, while Raf-R89L, as expected, was not significantly activated by Ras. The activity of these Raf alleles in response to integrin-mediated adhesion was then measured (Fig. 1 B). We found that adhesion to fibronectin could activate both the WT and R89L forms of Raf, although the level of activation of the R89L mutant was lower than that of Raf-WT (Fig. 1,B and D). To confirm that the level of activation seen for Raf-R89L was indeed significant, the activity of a catalytically inactive mutant of Raf (K375M) was determined in nonadherent and Fn-attached cells and used as a measure of zero activation (Fig. 1 D). The results of several (n ≥ 5) experiments were averaged (Fig. 1 D), which showed that, after 15 min of adhesion, the activation of Raf-R89L was significant but 4–5-fold lower than the level of activation of wild-type Raf. It should be noted that activation of Raf clearly involves specific adhesion to Fn, mediated primarily by integrins, because cells adhering to the nonspecific cationic polymer poly-l-lysine do not activate Raf (data not shown). In summary, these experiments demonstrate that significant activation of Raf by integrin-mediated adhesion can occur in the absence of direct Ras-Raf interaction but that this interaction clearly enhances integrin-mediated Raf activation. It is well established that localization of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane is important for its activation (28Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) and that one function of Ras is to mediate this localization (25Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 29Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the membrane-associated machinery responsible for Raf activation remains unclear (16Cutler R.E. Morrison D.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). To examine the importance of membrane localization in integrin-mediated Raf activation and to determine if the function of Ras could be supplanted by targeting Raf to the membrane, we used a version of the R89L mutant that carries at its C-terminus a 20-amino acid sequence known as a CAAX box (Raf-R89L-CAAX). This sequence directs prenylation and membrane localization of Raf and, in adherent cells, results in a high constitutive level of Raf-R89L-CAAX activity, despite its inability to bind Ras (25Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 28Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected with Raf-WT or Raf-R89L-CAAX, serum-starved, harvested, and either kept in suspension or plated on fibronectin for 15 min and analyzed by an immunoprecipitation kinase assay (Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, Raf-R89L-CAAX activity, which is normally high in attached cells, was low in cells in suspension but increased upon cellular attachment to fibronectin, and the level of this activation was similar to that for Raf-WT (Fig. 1, C and D). Subcellular fractionation, membrane isolation, and Western blot analysis indicated that the low level of activity of Raf-R89L-CAAX in nonadherent cells was not due to a loss or reduction of membrane localization of the protein during suspension culture conditions (data not shown). These data suggest that integrin-mediated cell adhesion can efficiently activate Raf-1 when Raf is able to localize to the cell membrane, as with Raf-WT or Raf-R89L-CAAX, while significant, but reduced, activation can occur even when membrane localization is compromised, as with Raf-R89L. Furthermore, the lack of Raf-R89L-CAAX activity in nonadherent cells suggests that cell adhesion may regulate the membrane-associated machinery responsible for Raf activation after its translocation to the membrane. The regulation by adhesion of Raf-R89L-CAAX suggests that membrane-proximal regulators of Raf activity are sensitive to integrin function. One of the most important functions of integrins is to anchor actin filaments to the membrane at points of contact with the ECM, thereby supporting the assembly of stress fibers and organization of the actin cytoskeleton. To examine whether cytoskeleton assembly is important for integrin-mediated Raf activation, we treated cells with cytochalasin D (cytoD), a widely used and well characterized inhibitor of actin filament formation. Previous reports have established that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, through treatment with cytoD or expression of dominant negative Rho, inhibits integrin-mediated MAPK activation (8Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Tobe K. Ueki K. Kikuchi K. Takehara K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21691-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, cytoD inhibited integrin-mediated activation of Raf-WT, as well as Raf-R89L and, interestingly, Raf-R89L-CAAX (Fig. 2). This demonstrates that cytoskeletal organization is required for integrin-mediated Raf activation, even for a membrane-targeted form of Raf. Compared with the response to most soluble mitogens, activation of the MAPK cascade by integrin-mediated adhesion is of lower magnitude and longer duration (3Aplin A.E. Howe A.K. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 197-263PubMed Google Scholar). In NIH3T3 cells, integrin-mediated MAPK activity peaks 10–15 min after adhesion and returns to basal levels by 2 h (7Chen Q. Lin T.H. Der C.J. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18122-18127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 8Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Important aspects of the relative activation of Raf-WT and the R89L and R89L-CAAX mutants may not be fully realized by a single time point. Therefore, we determined the time course of integrin-mediated activity of Raf-WT, Raf-R89L, and Raf-R89L-CAAX. As described previously for MAPK, integrin-mediated Raf-WT activity peaked at 10–20 min after adhesion to fibronectin and slowly returned to near basal levels by 2 h (Fig. 3). As described above in Fig. 1, the activation of Raf-R89L at early time points after attachment (i.e. 10–15 min) is significantly lower than Raf-WT. However, the level of activity of Raf-R89L throughout the later time points (i.e. 40–120 min) is almost indistinguishable from WT levels (Fig. 3). Specifically, Raf-R89L exhibits the same level of activity as Raf-WT at 40 min after cellular adhesion to fibronectin, and the rate at which this activity returns to basal level (i.e. the level present in nonadherent cells) parallels the rate of decay of WT activity. It is important to note that, for these experiments, transfections were performed on cells in six-well dishes, and upon trypsinization, all cells from a given plate were pooled, replated on Fn, and then harvested at different times. Using a pooled cell population for the time course experiments eliminates variability in levels of Raf expression between time points, a point that was confirmed by Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitated Raf isoforms (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel). In contrast to the allele containing only the R89L point mutation, the membrane-targeted Raf-R89L-CAAX was activated as efficiently as Raf-WT at early time points after cell adhesion (Fig. 1, C and D; Fig. 2). However, unlike both Raf-WT and the R89L point mutant, the activity of the R89L-CAAX mutant did not return to basal levels by 2 h but rather persisted at greater than 90% of maximum levels for the length of the experiment. Although a detailed, extended time course of adhesion-mediated Raf-R89L-CAAX activity has not been done, preliminary experiments suggest that the activity returns to base line within 8 h after adhesion (data not shown). These results demonstrate that constitutive localization of Raf to the cell membrane allows for a significantly prolonged activation of Raf upon cellular adhesion to fibronectin. The results above suggested that integrin-mediated adhesion might regulate factors involved in the activation of membrane-localized Raf. In an attempt to determine what these factors might be, we began to investigate the importance of known positive regulators of Raf activity. Members of the PKC family of kinases are well known for their ability to activate MAPK through Raf (31Carroll M.P. May W.S. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 6: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). ORC is bound to DNA throughout the cell cycle (2Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H.

Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar), and in G1, ORC recruits other proteins involved in initiation of DNA replication. Yeast ORC utilizes ATP for binding to DNA and has an ATPase activity that is inhibited by binding to the origin of DNA replication (1Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 13Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Like the DNA replication initiator proteins in Escherichia coli (dnaA) or the simian virus 40 (T antigen), ATP binding and hydrolysis by the eukaryotic initiator protein could be an important regulator of the initiation process. Three members of a putative human ORC, homologous to yeast ORC1, ORC2, and ORC4, have been identified so far in mammals, specifically in humans and in mice (14Gavin K.A. Hidaka M. Stillman B. Science. 1995; 270: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 15Takahara K. Bong M. Brevard R. Eddy R.L. Haley L.L. Sait S.J. Shows T.B. Hoffman G.G. Greenspan D.S.

A multi-subunit complex of proteins containing known ORC subunits has been identified in Drosophila, Xenopus, and humans, although all components have not been demonstrated to be homologs of yeast ORC. InXenopus, antibody-mediated depletion of ORC inhibits initiation of DNA replication (17Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 18Rowles A. Chong J.P.J. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J.

Biol. 1996; 6: 1416-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), whereas in Drosophila, a conditional mutation in the DmORC2gene demonstrated the involvement of this gene product in initiation of DNA replication (20Landis G. Kelley R. Spradling A.C. Tower J. Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3888-3892Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, although specific DNA sequences that bind to ORC and initiate DNA replication have not been identified in any species other than S. cerevisiae, the conservation of ORC subunits in higher eukaryotes makes it likely that human ORC will play a similar role in DNA replication. We report here the identification of a fourth member of human ORC,ORC5L, which is homologous to ScORC5 and DmORC5 (11Loo S. Fox C.A. Rine J. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Bell S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 21Gossen M. Pak D.T. Hansen S.K. Acharya J.K. Botchan M.R. Science. 1995; 270: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cloning ORC5L moves us closer toward the ultimate goal of reconstituting the entire human ORCin vitro. In addition, the cytogenetic localization of the gene for this subunit corresponds to a region frequently deleted in the most common pelvic tumor in women, uterine leiomyomas or fibroids, and in malignant myeloid diseases. ORC5L is the first gene corresponding to a replication initiation factor consistently deleted in certain human neoplasms. The gene is named ORC5L, whereas the RNA and protein products are called HsORC5 and HsORC5p, respectively, to distinguish them from corresponding products of other species. Unexpectedly, we detected an alternatively spliced mRNA from the ORC5L locus that produced a C-terminally truncated protein that seems to have properties different from full-length HsORC5p. In the expressed sequence tag data base (dbEST, National Center for Biotechnology Information), the partial sequence of a human cDNA (AA353934) was found showing significant homology to amino acids 8–88 of ORC5p fromDrosophila melanogaster. AA353934 represented the 5′ end of a cDNA clone obtained from human Jurkat T cell mRNA. This clone was obtained and found to contain a 1.9-kb cDNA, which corresponds in size to the mRNA detected by Northern blotting. The sequence has been deposited in GenBank (accession number AF049127). After this work was completed, another sequence almost identical to ORC5Lwas reported (22Ishiai M. Dean F.B. Okumura K. Abe M. Moon K.Y. Amin A.A. Kagotani K. Taguchi H. Murakami Y. Hanaoka F. et al.Genomics. 1997; 46: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It differs from our sequence at nucleotide 162, resulting in a change in amino acid 37 in the putative NTP binding motif (we discuss the significance of this polymorphism later). RACE was performed using a HeLa cell cDNA library (Marathon-Ready,CLONTECH) in which cDNAs have been cloned ligated to an adaptor sequence used for priming. For amplification of the 5′ ends, polymerase chain reaction was performed using the adaptor primer (AP1) and gene-specific antisense primers. A cDNA representing the alternatively spliced form of ORC5 was also found in dbEST (AA375988) and sequenced. We refer to this clone, containing a 1.3-kb cDNA, as HsORC5T. The sequence has been deposited in GenBank™ (acession no. AF081459). The full-length mRNA and protein are referred to as HsORC5 (or HsORC5L) and HsORC5p, respectively, whereas the alternately spliced mRNA and protein are referred to as HsORC5T and HsORC5Tp, respectively. For RT-PCR, cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of total RNA from HeLa or B-lymphoid IgH1 cells using oligo(dT) primer. HsORC5 and HsORC5T-specific sequences were amplified by two rounds of nested PCR using 5′ primers common to both HsORC5 and HsORC5T and unique 3′ primers (Fig. 2). A 1.9-kb BamHI-XhoI fragment from the cDNA encoding the full-length protein was cloned into the same sites of pRSETB to express it fused to a His6-epitope tag. A 55-kDa protein was produced in bacteria, purified on a nickel resin column, and used to raise antibodies in rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals). Antibodies against human HsORC2p and HsORC4p have been described elsewhere (16Quintana D.G. Hou Z. Thome K.C. Hendricks M. Saha P. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28247-28251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recombinant HsORC5p or HsORC5Tp fused with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) were expressed in mammalian cells using the pEBG expression plasmid. PCR with Pfu polymerase was used to introduce a SpeI site into the cDNA immediately upstream from the initiator methionine (ACTAGTATG), and for HsORC5 aKpnI site immediately downstream from the stop codon (TGAGGTACC). For HsORC5T a KpnI site from the pBluescript polylinker was utilized. These sites were used to clone HsORC5 and HsORC5T cDNAs into the pEBG vector such that the GST coding region was fused in-frame to the ORC5 coding sequence. 293T cells transiently transfected for 48 h with pEBG, pEBG-HsORC5, or pEBG-HsORC5T were lysed, and the expressed proteins recovered by affinity purification on glutathione agarose beads. Co-precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting according to standard protocols. Conditions of HeLa cell culture, synchronization, extraction, and Northern blotting were as described previously (16Quintana D.G. Hou Z. Thome K.C. Hendricks M. Saha P. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28247-28251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Northern analysis of tissue samples was performed on a commercially prepared blot (CLONTECH). For protein work, whole cell extracts were prepared in 8 m urea-containing buffer where indicated. Subcellular fractionation was done by hypotonic shock followed by disruption using a B-pestle Dounce homogenizer. An aliquot was inspected under the microscope to ensure that cells were disrupted and nuclei were intact. Nuclei were separated by low speed centrifugation, and S100 was obtained by subsequent centrifugation of the low speed supernatant at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Nuclei were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and subfractionated by incubation in buffer containing 0.4 m NaCl and 0.02% Nonidet P-40. The soluble fraction was obtained by centrifugation at maximum speed in an Eppendorf 5415C centrifuge, and the insoluble fraction was extracted in 8 m urea. All solutions except those containing urea were supplemented with 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin. Leiomyoma specimens have been described (23Xing Y.P. Powell W.L. Morton C.C. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1997; 98: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Williams A.J.

Metaphase preparations from peripheral blood of normal human males and human uterine leiomyoma specimens ST92–224 and ST94–114 (23Xing Y.P. Powell W.L. Morton C.C. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1997; 98: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with del(7)(q22q32) were used in FISH experiments for localization of ORC5L. The ORC5L probe consisted of a 7-kb genomic DNA fragment isolated from a lambda gt10 genomic library by hybridization with the HsORC5 cDNA. Probe was labeled with digoxigenin by standard nick translation methods. A biotinylated alpha satellite control probe for chromosome 7 (D7Z1, Oncor) was used as directed by the manufacturer. Hybridization was carried out with 500 ng of probe in 50% formamide, 2% dextran sulfate, and 2 × SSC at 37 °C for 16 h (23Xing Y.P. Powell W.L. Morton C.C. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1997; 98: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Schneider M.C. Rodriguez A.M. Nomura H. Zhou J. Morton C.C. Reeders S.T. Weremowicz S. Genomics. 1996; 38: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Slides were washed with 50% formamide, 2 × SSC at 43 °C for 15 min, twice with 2 × SSC at 37 °C for 5 min each, and once with 1 × PBD (4 × SSC, 0.1% Tween 20) at 25 °C for 3 min. Signal detection was accomplished by incubating each slide with 60 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-avidin/rhodamine anti-digoxigenin at 43 °C for 20 min, followed by three 3-min washes in 1 × PBD. Metaphases were counterstained with DAPI and visualized on Zeiss Axioskop fluorescent microscope equipped with a triple band pass filter. The cDNA insert encodes a predicted protein of 435 amino acids (Fig. 1), with a calculated molecular mass of 50 kDa and a pI of 8.35. We have identified this clone as human replication origin recognition complex ORC5 (ORC5L). The amino acid sequence of HsORC5p has 38% identity (62% similarity) to that of DmORC5p and 24% identity (48% similarity) to that of ScORC5p.Figure 1A, the translated amino acid sequence of human ORC5p (HsORC5) (dbEST clone AA353934) aligned to the ORC5p sequence of Drosophila (DmORC5) (21Gossen M.

B, the unique sequence of HsORC5T (dbEST clone AA375988). The arrow indicates the point at which the sequences of HsORC5 and HsORC5T start diverging. Nucleotide numbers are from GenBank™ accession no. AF081459. Amino acid numbers begin from the initiator methionine common to ORC5 and ORC5T.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The initiator methionine codon of HsORC5p is preceded by an untranslated leader sequence of 74 nucleotides that does not contain a stop codon in the same reading frame, so theoretically the protein could have a further N-terminal extension; however, alignment of the human protein with DmORC5p and ScORC5p indicates that homology is noted within 10 amino acids from the N termini of these proteins (Fig. 1), suggesting that the cloned human cDNA represents the correct N terminus protein. Also, the size of the protein produced in rabbit reticulocyte lysates by in vitro transcription and translation of the cDNA is the same as that of the protein identified by anti-HsORC5p antibodies in HeLa cell extracts and in tissue extracts (see below, Fig. 3). Finally, 5′-RACE using a HeLa cDNA library and gene-specific antisense primers revealed no upstream extensions. The sequence of HsORC5p encoded by AA353934 does not contain a putative purine nucleotide binding motif present in ORC5p of other species (Fig. 1, amino acids 37–43 of HsORC5p is RXXAXGK instead of GXXGXGK seen in S. cerevisiae and Drosophila). ScORC5p has been shown to bind ATP (13Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, in another cDNA representing the N-terminal two-thirds of ORC5L in dbEST (AA375988), the corresponding sequence is GXXAXGK. The latter sequence was confirmed by sequencing a RACE product amplified from a HeLa cDNA library. Because GXXAXGK has been reported to be a functional purine nucleotide binding motif, this result suggests that there are at least two alleles of ORC5L differing from each other in a potentially significant nucleotide binding motif. Unexpectedly, the 3′ end of the cDNA containing AA375988 was different in sequence from that of the HsORC5 cDNA from nucleotide 953 (GenBank™ accession no. AF081459; see also Fig. 1 B). The result is the production of an mRNA that encodes a protein with amino acids 1–293 of HsORC5 followed by a unique sequence of 31 amino acids. This putative protein is designated HsORC5Tp. Further analysis suggests that the variant cDNA is the product of alternative splicing. To ensure that HsORC5T was not an artifact produced during cDNA preparation, we did the following experiments. Northern blot analysis of a variety of cell lines with the unique portion of HsORC5T identified a transcript of approximately the same size as detected by a probe containing the unique C-terminal portion of HsORC5 (Fig. 2 A). At equivalent levels of exposure, the abundance of the HsORC5T transcript is estimated by densitometric scanning to be about one-tenth that of the HsORC5 transcript. Because the resolution of our Northern analysis is insufficient to distinguish between the sizes of the 1.9-kb HsORC5 transcript and the 1.3-kb HsORC5T transcript, RT-PCR was employed to identify positively the alternatively spliced HsORC5T transcript (Fig. 2 B). Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA was amplified with a pair of external primers that could amplify either HsORC5 (primers A and C) or HsORC5T (primers A and E), and the products were re-amplified with internal primers specific for HsORC5 (primers B and D) or HsORC5T (primers B and F). Amplifications using plasmids containing either HsORC5 or HsORC5T cDNA as template demonstrated specificity of the primer pairs (Fig. 2 C, lanes 7–10). The HsORC5T cDNA clone gave a product of 314 base pairs (Fig. 2 C, lane 7), and the HsORC5 cDNA clone gave a product of 857 base pairs (Fig. 2 C, lane 10). As seen in Fig. 2 C, both HeLa and IgH1 cells have detectable levels of HsORC5T transcript (lanes 2 and 5) in addition to HsORC5 transcript (lanes 3 and 6). To study HsORC5 protein, we raised polyclonal rabbit antibodies to the bacterially produced His6-tagged HsORC5p. Anti-HsORC5p antibody recognizes a specific 52-kDa band in Sf9 insect cell extracts that have been infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing HsORC5 (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 4) but not in extracts of cells infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing a mock protein (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 3). When [35S]methionine-labeled (untagged) HsORC5p was produced in rabbit reticulocyte lysates by in vitro transcription and translation, two polypeptides of 52 and 49 kDa were produced (Fig. 3, lane 9). The smaller protein probably was produced by internal translation initiation or by degradation of the larger protein because the anti-HsORC5p antibody specifically immunoprecipitates both polypeptides from reticulocyte lysates, enriching for the higher molecular mass product (not shown). Immunoblotting of HeLa cell lysates with the anti-HsORC5p antibody specifically identified a 52-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6), which was extracted better by 8 murea than by boiling cells in Laemmli sample buffer but not detected under less stringent salt or detergent conditions. An additional cellular protein of 40 kDa was detected by the anti-HsORC5p antibody and was easily extracted by a buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 150 mm NaCl. In vitro transcription and translation of the HsORC5T cDNA produced a protein of 40 kDa and a smaller product of 38 kDa, probably by internal initiation (Fig. 3,lane 10). Thus, the 40-kDa cellular protein detected by the anti-HsORC5p antibody could be the HsORC5T protein. However, this issue will need to be confirmed by raising antibodies that specifically recognize the unique portion of HsORC5Tp. Immunoblotting of lysates of a uterine leiomyoma with a normal karyotype (see below) also detected two bands of 52 and 40 kDa (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8), corresponding in size to the bands identified in HeLa cell extracts (lane 6) and to the largest in vitro translated products from HsORC5 and HsORC5T (lanes 9 and 10). Identical results were obtained with extracts from Wi38 primary fibroblasts (not shown). A complex containing all four known human ORC subunits has not been identified in somatic cell extracts. One possibility is that one or more of the ORC subunits is not easily extracted under conditions expected to maintain inter-subunit interactions, thereby requiring extraction conditions that result in disruption of the holo-ORC. Indeed, when asynchronous HeLa cells were fractionated, HsORC1p, HsORC2p and HsORC4p were found in the nuclear fraction that is extracted in 0.4 m NaCl and 0.02% Nonidet P-40. HsORC1p localized also to the S100 fraction. In contrast, HsORC5p remained bound to the nuclear-insoluble pellet (Fig. 4). Nuclear lamins serve as a positive control for the nuclear-insoluble fraction. Although the anti-HsORC5p antibody immunoprecipitated HsORC5p from rabbit reticulocyte lysates, it could not immunoprecipitate endogenous cellular HsORC5p extracted in 8m urea. Hence, we examined association of HsORC5p with other known human ORC subunits by an alternative approach. Transient transfection of pEBG-HsORC5 allowed expression of a 70-kDa GST-HsORC5p fusion protein in 293T cells. Addition of the GST tag and overexpression of the protein also makes possible the recovery of HsORC5p under mild extraction conditions (250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). In parallel cultures, GST alone was expressed from the pEBG vector as a negative control. GST-HsORC5p (or GST) was isolated from cell lysates by affinity purification on glutathione-agarose beads and detected by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody (Fig. 5, top panel, lanes 3 and 4). Immunoblotting of the associated proteins with anti-HsORC2p (Fig. 5, second panel), anti-HsORC4p (Fig. 5, third panel), or anti-HsORC1p (Fig. 5,bottom panel) antibodies revealed that HsORC2p and HsORC4p were copurified specifically with GST-HsORC5p but not with GST alone (lane 4 versus lane 3). The 100-kDa HsORC1p was not detected in the GST-HsORC5p precipitate (lane 4). To examine whether HsORC5Tp had properties similar to HsORC5p, the former was also expressed in mammalian cells as a GST-HsORC5T fusion protein. Consistent with the greater extractability of endogenous HsORC5Tp relative to endogenous HsORC5p, the level of GST-HsORC5Tp extracted from transfected cells was significantly higher than that of GST-HsORC5p when the cells were extracted in 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. This difference disappeared when extracts were prepared by boiling cells in Laemmli sample buffer (not shown). Pull-down of the GST-fusion proteins on glutathione-agarose beads and immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies indicates that HsORC4p but not HsORC2p associates with GST-HsORC5Tp (Fig. 5,lane 6). Thus, the C-terminal truncation of ORC5 makes the protein both more soluble and abolishes its ability to enter into a functional holo-ORC. Of the known human replication initiator factors, mRNA levels of HsORC1 and HsCDC6/Cdc18 are highest at the G1-S transition, and their promoters have been shown to be under control of the E2F transcription factor (26Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Leone G. Herendeen D.R. Kelly T.J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6977-6984Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 27Williams R.S. Shohet R.V. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To examine whether HsORC5 mRNA was regulated similarly, Northern blot analysis was done using asynchronous HeLa cells and cells blocked in M and S phases with nocodazole and hydroxyurea, respectively (Fig. 6 A). Comparison with the GAPDH control indicates that HsORC5 mRNA essentially is unchanged between M and S phases. HeLa cells also were followed as they progressed synchronously following release from an M phase block (Fig. 6 B). Progressive decline and increase of cyclin B mRNA levels indicates that cells passed through G1 and S synchronously. HsORC5 mRNA, however, was detected at a constant level throughout the cell cycle. These results were confirmed in different mRNA preparations and by quantitative comparison of HsORC5 and GAPDH signals by densitometric scanning. Therefore, unlikeHsORC1 or HsCDC6, the ORC5L gene is not up-regulated at the G1-S transition. In agreement with the mRNA results, no differences were observed in the level of HsORC5p in whole cell extracts along the cell cycle (not shown). To examine whether ORC subunit expression varies between tissues, a Northern blot of mRNA from a panel of human tissues was hybridized sequentially with HsORC5-, HsORC5T-, HsORC4-, and HsORC1-specific probes. High levels of HsORC5, HsORC5T, and HsORC4 were observed in testis and prostate (Fig. 6 C, lanes 3 and 4). HsORC5 and HsORC5T also were expressed at increased levels in spleen and ovary (Fig. 6 C, lanes 1 and 5). Murine ORC2L expression also has been reported to be highest in testis and high in other non-proliferating tissues such as kidney and brain (15Takahara K. Bong M. Brevard R. Eddy R.L. Haley L.L. Sait S.J. Shows T.B. Hoffman G.G. Greenspan D.S. Genomics. 1996; 31: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, HsORC1 expression was high only in testis and colon mucosal lining (Fig. 6 C, lanes 4and 7). Comparison with the GAPDH loading control suggests that HsORC1 levels are higher in colon mucosal lining than in testis. Thus, whereas HsORC1 expression seems positively correlated to cell proliferation, the expression of the other subunits was higher in tissues without significant proliferation (e.g., spleen, prostate, ovary). In addition, comparison of tissues with similar low levels of proliferation activity (e.g. spleen, thymus, prostate, peripheral blood leukocytes) or tissues with high proliferation activity (small intestine and colon mucosal lining) shows no correlation between proliferation and expression of the HsORC4, HsORC5, and murine ORC2 subunits. Nucleotides 1224–1889 of HsORC5 cDNA are represented by two exons present in a 162-kb genomic fragment (bacmid RG126M09) (GenBank accession no. AC002067). Nucleotides 1224–1336 of the cDNA are encoded by an exon composed of nucleotides 13204–13316 of RG126M09, whereas nucleotides 1337–1889 of the cDNA represent an exon containing nucleotides 23204–23756 of the genomic fragment (Fig. 7 A). Exons coding for sequences upstream of nucleotide 1224 are not present on this bacmid, indicating the existence of an intron greater than 13 kb. The bacmid also contains the sequence-tagged sites sWSS1097 (also known as D7S658) (nucleotides 63971–64311 of RG126M09) and sWSS1679 (nucleotides 105613–105843 of RG126M09). Therefore, the ORC5L gene is localized to human chromosome 7 in band q22, adjacent to and upstream from sWSS1097. These markers fall in contig sWSS6-N (National Human Genome Research Institute data base) or contig WC7.6 (Whitehead Institute radiation hybrid data base), within 3.5 centirays (approximately 1 Mb) of markers D7S518, D7S666, and D7S515 (Fig. 7 A). The order of markers is centromere-D7S518-D7S666-D7S515-D7S658-D7S501-D7S496-D7S471-telomere. Interest in this region of the genome is high because the interval from D7S518 to D7S471 is the smallest common region of loss of heterozygosity seen in approximately 10% of uterine leiomyomas (28Ozisik Y.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2071944485,"Chemical studies have shown the occurrence of the deaminated sialic acid 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nononic acid (KDN) in paired samples of blood obtained from mothers and newborns of healthy human individuals. Most of the KDN was found in red blood cells, although low levels were detected in mononuclear cells. NoN-glycolylneuraminic acid was detected. Unexpectedly, nearly all of the KDN in fetal cord and matched maternal red blood cells was present as the free sugar and comparatively little occurred conjugated or as cytidine 5′-KDN phosphate. The amount of free KDN in fetal newborn red blood cells was 2.4-fold higher than in red blood cells from the mothers or from healthy nonpregnant women. Free KDN was also identified in normal human ovaries, in ovarian tumors, and in ascites cells obtained from ovarian cancer patients. Importantly, as in fetal cord red blood cells, a distinguishing feature of KDN expression in ovarian tumor cells was an elevated level of free KDN compared with normal controls. A positive correlation was found between an increase in the ratio of free KDN/N-acetylneuraminic acid in ovarian adenocarcinomas and the stage of malignancy. This was particularly evident in tumor cells isolated from the ascites fluid. The central importance of these new findings is 2-fold. First, they show that free KDN is a minor but ubiquitous sialic acid in human red blood cells and that its elevated expression in red blood cells from fetal cord blood compared with maternal red blood cells may be developmentally related to blood cell formation during embryogenesis. Second, the enhanced expression of KDN in ovarian cancer cells suggests that this sialic acid, like the α2,8-linked polysialic acid glycotope, may be an oncofetal antigen in these tumors and thus could be an “early warning” signal for onset of disease and/or a marker for detection of recurrence of disease. These new findings highlight the importance of elucidating the role that KDN and KDN-containing glycoconjugates may play in normal development and malignancy. Chemical studies have shown the occurrence of the deaminated sialic acid 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nononic acid (KDN) in paired samples of blood obtained from mothers and newborns of healthy human individuals. Most of the KDN was found in red blood cells, although low levels were detected in mononuclear cells. NoN-glycolylneuraminic acid was detected. Unexpectedly, nearly all of the KDN in fetal cord and matched maternal red blood cells was present as the free sugar and comparatively little occurred conjugated or as cytidine 5′-KDN phosphate. The amount of free KDN in fetal newborn red blood cells was 2.4-fold higher than in red blood cells from the mothers or from healthy nonpregnant women. Free KDN was also identified in normal human ovaries, in ovarian tumors, and in ascites cells obtained from ovarian cancer patients. Importantly, as in fetal cord red blood cells, a distinguishing feature of KDN expression in ovarian tumor cells was an elevated level of free KDN compared with normal controls. A positive correlation was found between an increase in the ratio of free KDN/N-acetylneuraminic acid in ovarian adenocarcinomas and the stage of malignancy. This was particularly evident in tumor cells isolated from the ascites fluid. The central importance of these new findings is 2-fold. First, they show that free KDN is a minor but ubiquitous sialic acid in human red blood cells and that its elevated expression in red blood cells from fetal cord blood compared with maternal red blood cells may be developmentally related to blood cell formation during embryogenesis.

Expression of sialic acid (Sia) (1Varki A. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 24-40Crossref Scopus (477) Google Scholar)1 residues on glycoconjugates is of critical importance in normal development and differentiation because these sugar molecules appear to mediate a variety of specific biological functions (1Varki A. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 24-40Crossref Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 2Schauer R. Kamerling J.P. Neuberger A. Van Deenen L.L.M. New Comprehensive Biochemistry: Glycoproteins. 29B. Elsevier Publishing Co., Amsterdam1997: 243-402Google Scholar).N-Acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) is the most common occurring Sia, and more than 40 naturally occurring derivatives have been described. The temporal appearance and disappearance of Sia at different stages during normal development and on different cell types is a highly regulated and dynamic process (3Hakomori S. Adv. Cancer Res. 1989; 52: 257-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). It is also believed that Sia plays a central role in malignant transformation, because changes in the levels, type, or linkage of Sia in tumor cell glycoconjugates can affect the malignant potential of tumors (4Takano R. Muchmore E. Dennis J.W. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For example, some lymphoid tumors expressing N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) are highly metastatic (4Takano R. Muchmore E. Dennis J.W. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and many sialylated glycoconjugates are stage-specific antigens that can be re-expressed on cancer cell as “oncofetal” or “oncodevelopmental” antigens (3Hakomori S. Adv. Cancer Res. 1989; 52: 257-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). The α2,8-linked polySia glycotope is one such oncodevelopmental, tumor-associated antigen. The cell surface expression of polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecules is positively correlated with increased malignancy in a number of human tumors, including Wilms tumor (5Roth J. Zuber C.

The general involvement of carbohydrate chains in metastasis and prognosis of human carcinomas and the roles of tumor associated carbohydrate antigens in cell adhesion during tumor metastasis have also been recently summarized (13Muramatsu T.

In 1986, we discovered the occurrence of deaminated neuraminic acid (2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nononic acid; KDN; Structure FS1) in fish eggs as a new class of Sia (15Nadano D. Iwasaki M. Endo S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11550-11557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies showed that KDN was expressed on cells ranging in evolutionary diversity from microbes to lower vertebrate species, in some cases as 9-O-acetyl-KDN (16Iwasaki M. Inoue S. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2596-2602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and recently in mammalian cells and tissues (Ref. 17Inoue S. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24341-24344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar and references therein). We now provide unambiguous evidence for the occurrence of KDN in normal human red blood cells and in normal and malignant ovarian tissues. An increased expression of free KDN in fetal cord red blood cells from newborns, compared with maternal red blood cells, and its elevation in ovarian tumors compared with normal ovarian tissues, are central new findings that highlight the importance of elucidating the role that KDN and KDN-containing glycoconjugates may play in normal development and malignancy. 1 ml each of paired maternal and fetal cord blood was collected from full term parturients at the Tri-Service General Hospital, Taiwan in anticoagulant coated-tubes that had been treated with EDTA. All patients consented to the blood test. Maternal blood was collected at the beginning of labor and fetal cord blood was collected immediately after delivery before placenta separation. Plasma and red blood cells were separated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Adult blood (10 ml each) was collected from healthy female donors (age ranged 18–37) in heparinized, anticoagulant tubes. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Red blood cells were collected from whole blood by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 15 min and washed three times with 3 volumes of 0.85% NaCl, 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Washed red blood cells were lyzed with 9 volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pelleted ghosts were washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) until free of hemoglobin. All tissues and body fluids were obtained from biopsy or surgical dissection and stored at −80 °C until use. Approximately 8–50 mg of tissue or cells were used for each analysis. Ascites cells were collected by centrifugation of ascites at 12,000 rpm and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Free Sia and CMP-Sia were separated from soluble glycoproteins in the red blood cells lysates by ethanol precipitation. To 2.0 ml of the lysate, corresponding to 0.2 ml of red blood cells, 8.0 ml of cold absolute ethanol were added. The mixture was kept on ice for about 1 h before centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 15 min. This allowed separation of free Sia and CMP-Sia from the soluble glycoproteins that were precipitated by ethanol (18Muchmore E.A. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The precipitate was washed three times with cold 80% ethanol, and the supernatant fractions were combined. The ethanol-soluble fraction was dried by evaporation. The residue was dissolved in 500 μl of water, and 50 μl (corresponding to 20 μl of red blood cells) were applied to a Bio-Rad AG-1 column. The fraction eluting with 0.7 m formic acid was subjected to quantitative Sia determination by HPLC analysis of the DMB derivatives, as described below. 1 ml of 90% phenol was added to 2 ml of the red blood cells lysate, and the mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature. After centrifugation at 3,000 rpm, the supernatant was passed through a Bio-Rad AG-1 column (1.5 × 2 cm). The Sia, which eluted with 3 column volumes of 0.7 m formic acid, were analyzed as by HPLC as their DMB derivatives (see “Sialic Acid and Protein Analysis”). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C unless stated otherwise. Ovarian tissues (8–50 mg) were cut into small pieces in 0.5–1.0 ml of TBS buffer (0.01 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.15m NaCl) and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica, Littau, Switzerland). The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was re-homogenized in TBS buffer and centrifuged again at 20,000 ×g for 20 min. The pellet was designated 20P. The supernatant fractions were combined and centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 1 h. The pellet from this sedimentation was designated 100P. Four volumes of ethanol were added to the supernatant fractions, and after 2.0 h on ice, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed three times with cold 80% ethanol. The combined supernatant fractions were dried under vacuum at 30 °C, and the total amount of Sia was quantitatively determined as their DMB derivatives by HPLC analysis, as described below. The total amount of Sia in the 20P and 100P fractions were also quantitatively determined after mild acid hydrolysis, as described below. The amount of Sia was quantitatively determined as their DMB derivatives by HPLC, as described previously (17Inoue S. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24341-24344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 19Hara S. Yamaguchi M. Takemori Y. Furuhata K. Ogura H. Nakamura M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). For the analysis of bound Sia, samples were first hydrolyzed in 0.1 m HCl for 1.0 h at 80 °C. The HCl was removed by evaporation. In some samples, the hydrolysate was treated with a Bio-Rad AG-1 column before derivatization. The DMB derivatives were resolved on TSK-gel ODS-120T (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) or Micorsorb C18 (Rainin, Woburn, MA) columns on a Jasco series 900 or Hewlett Packard series 1100 HPLC systems. The fluorescent detectors were set at 373 nm for excitation and 448 nm for emission. The columns (inner diameter, 250 × 4.6 cm) were eluted isocratically at room temperature with a mixture of methanol/acetonitrile/water (7:5:88). The amount of protein was estimated with the bicinchoninic acid kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The amount of total KDN and Neu5Ac in red blood cells isolated from 14 matched pairs of fetal cord and maternal blood samples was quantitatively determined after mild acid hydrolysis by a highly sensitive fluorescence-assisted HPLC method (17Inoue S. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24341-24344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,19Hara S. Yamaguchi M. Takemori Y. Furuhata K. Ogura H. Nakamura M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the mean values of total KDN in fetal cord red blood cells was approximately 2.4-fold higher than the levels in matched maternal red blood cells (1.4 ± 0.67 μg/ml versus 0.59 ± 0.23 μg/ml). Further, the relative KDN levels were determined to be on average 2.2 and 0.94 mol % of the Neu5Ac levels in fetal cord and maternal red blood cells, respectively. Thus, these results show a statistically significant higher level of KDN in umbilical cord red blood cells from neonates compared with their matched maternal red blood cells. This difference appears to be even more significant when compared with the small difference found between the levels of Neu5Ac in cord and maternal red blood cells, determined to be 69 ± 21 and 74 ± 20 μg/ml, respectively. It is interesting to note that the relative amount of KDN in human red blood cells is 3.6-fold higher than that in adult rat red blood cells (0.94 mol % versus 0.26 mol % of the total Sia). To determine whether the high level of KDN expression in cord and maternal red blood cells was restricted to these cells or was possible due to contamination of this fraction with other serum components, we analyzed both plasma and red blood cells fractions that were separated from cord and maternal blood by centrifugation. The results clearly showed that a major proportion of KDN was associated with both the cord and adult red blood cells (95 and 86%, respectively; Table I). Essentially the same results were obtained when cord and maternal blood were separated by density gradient centrifugation in Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Although a small proportion of KDN was associated with the mononuclear cell fraction, only negligible amounts were found in plasma, which may have been due to red blood cell lysis during fractionation. In this experiment, plasma contained about 80% of the total blood Neu5Ac. We also sought to determine the distribution of KDN and Neu5Ac in the cytosolic and membrane fractions isolated from fetal cord and adult red blood cell lysates. The results from these studies showed that about 98% of the KDN was in the cytosolic fraction in both adult and cord red blood cells. In marked contrast, about 90% of the Neu5Ac was found in the membrane fraction (Table I). On the basis of these results we conclude that KDN, unlike Neu5Ac, is uniquely localized to the cytosolic fraction in both fetal cord and adult red blood cells.Table IQuantitative determination of the levels of KDN and Neu5Ac in the plasma, cytosol, and membrane fractions of fetal cord and adult red blood cellsCord (n = 7)Adult (n = 6)KDNNeu5AcKDNNeu5Acng/mlμg/mlng/mlμg/mlPlasma34 ± 1397 ± 1622 ± 13114 ± 5.0RBCs610 ± 47043 ± 16140 ± 8054 ± 5.9RBC supernatant740 ± 3304.0 ± 2.299 ± 592.6 ± 1.7RBC membrane16 ± 427 ± 1.73 ± 227 ± 1.9The plasma was the supernatant obtained after sedimentating red blood cells from heparinized blood.

Open table in a new tab The plasma was the supernatant obtained after sedimentating red blood cells from heparinized blood. The values recorded are the means ± S.D.

To determine whether the high levels of KDN present in the supernatant fraction of red blood cells lysates was free or bound to soluble glycoproteins, ethanol and phenol were used separately to precipitate any soluble proteins. Essentially all of the KDN in the supernatant fractions derived from adult or cord red blood cell lysates was recovered in the ethanol-soluble fraction and the water-soluble fraction after phenol treatment, suggesting that KDN either existed as the free sugar, as CMP-KDN or associated with low molecular weight components. Unlike KDN, less than 10% of the total Neu5Ac found in red blood cells appeared in the ethanol-soluble fraction, and this amount was similar for cord and adult red blood cells. To determine the chemical nature of KDN and Neu5Ac that was present in the cytosol of cord and adult red blood cell lysates, the ethanol-soluble fractions were applied separately to Q-Sepharose columns equilibrated with 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) in the cold. The material that bound to the column was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl. The eluted fractions were monitored for the presence of KDN and Neu5Ac by HPLC. All of the KDN eluted in the column flow-through fraction from both fetal and adult red blood cells, whereas 63% of the Neu5Ac in both fetal and adult red blood cells bound to the gel and was eluted with 0.1–0.25 m NaCl. The flow-through fraction was then applied to a Bio-Gel P-2 column and eluted with 0.05 mNaCl. The chemical nature of the eluted (free) Sia was shown to be exclusively free Neu5Ac (accounted for 37% of the total) and KDN as determined by HPLC analysis of its DMB derivative (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2, KDN and Neu5Ac were eluted under discrete peaks that coincided with the peaks of authentic KDN and Neu5Ac, respectively. This separation thus provided an unambiguous method to quantitatively determine the amount and chemical form of each Sia derivative in the cytosol of fetal and adult red blood cells. The Neu5Ac-containing fraction from maternal red blood cells that bound to Q-Sepharose and contained about two-thirds of the Neu5Ac was subsequently eluted from the Bio-Gel P-2 column in two broad peaks, which preceded the peak of free Neu5Ac. This elution profile would be that expected for Neu5Ac-containing small glycoproteins soluble in 80% ethanol. The nature of these Sia-containing structures was not further studied. No CMP-KDN or CMP-Neu5Ac was detected in the ethanol-soluble fraction from either fetal or adult red blood cells, even when using sensitive and specific HPLC methods and separation methods that avoided hydrolysis of labile sugar nucleotide linkages (20Petrie III, C.R. Korytnyk W. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Spiegel L.B. Hadjimichael Rossomando E.F. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 573: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The quantitative levels of free and bound KDN and Neu5Ac in cord and maternal red blood cells, determined after chromatographic separation of their DMB derivatives (Fig. 2), are summarized in Table II. These findings provide unambiguous evidence for the occurrence of free KDN in normal human red blood cells and its elevated expression in matched fetal cord red blood cells. On the basis of these new findings, we sought to determine whether free KDN was expressed in other normal human cells, e.g. ovarian tissues, and, if so, if this expression differed in ovarian cancer.Table IIQuantitative determination of free and bound KDN and Neu5Ac in the ethanol-soluble fraction isolated from fetal cord and maternal red blood cell lysates after chromatographic separation of each sialic acid componentKDNNeu5AcFreeBoundFreeBoundμg ml−1red blood cellsCord1.600.71.2Maternal0.900.40.7Pooled fetal cord red blood cells, 40 ml from three neonates, and maternal red blood cells, 14 ml from five mothers, were lyzed under hypotonic conditions, and the supernatant fractions were treated with ethanol to precipitate soluble glycoproteins, as described in the text. Each ethanol soluble fraction was applied to a Q-Sepharose column, and the flow through fraction that contained unbound sialic acids was subjected to Bio-Gel P-2 chromotography. KDN and Neu5Ac were separated and quantitatively determined as their DMB derivatives by HPLC, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Pooled fetal cord red blood cells, 40 ml from three neonates, and maternal red blood cells, 14 ml from five mothers, were lyzed under hypotonic conditions, and the supernatant fractions were treated with ethanol to precipitate soluble glycoproteins, as described in the text.

KDN and Neu5Ac were separated and quantitatively determined as their DMB derivatives by HPLC, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A quantitative comparison of the amount of KDN and Neu5Ac in normal human ovaries, ovarian tumors, and in ascites cells isolated from ovarian cancer patients is shown in Table III. Based on these initial studies, our findings support the following important conclusions: (a) Normal human ovarian tissue expressed KDN in amounts comparable with the amount found in adult human red blood cells. (b) The level of total KDN expressed was elevated 2.6-fold in ascites cells obtained from ovarian cancer patients, while showing a 55% increase in the ovarian tumor cells. These ascites cells showed a 5-fold higher KDN/Neu5Ac ratio than normal ovarian cells (1.8 versus 0.36 mol/100 mol). However, the values of the total KDN/Neu5Ac ratio for normal and ovarian tumor cells were similar (0.36 versus 0.41 mol/100 mol), perhaps because the Neu5Ac levels are reported to be elevated in some ovarian tumors (22Feijoo C. Páez de la Cadena M. Rodrı́guez-Berrocal F.J. Martı́nez-Zorzano V.S. Cancer Lett. 1997; 112: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). (c) Like human red blood cells, the major proportion of KDN was found as the free sugar in both normal and ovarian tumor cells. Based on the mean values shown in Table III, 80 and 89% of the total KDN from normal and ovarian or ascites tumor cells, respectively, was found in the ethanol-soluble fractions. In contrast, the Neu5Ac levels in the ethanol-soluble fraction accounted for only 21, 6, and 10% of the total Sia in normal and ovarian tumor and ascites cells, respectively. Thus, this reciprocal difference in the percentage of distribution of KDN and Neu5Ac in the ethanol-soluble fraction between normal and ovarian tumor cells, which led to a 4.2-fold increase in the KDN/Neu5Ac ratio in ovarian tumor cells and a 77-fold increase in ascites tumor cells, is a distinguishing feature of KDN expression in ovarian cancer cells, even though the total mol % ratio of KDN/Neu5Ac showed a smaller, yet statistically significant change as noted above.Table IIIQuantitative comparison of the amount of KDN and Neu5Ac present in normal human ovarian tissue, ovarian tumors, and ascites cells from ovarian cancer patientsFractionKDNNeu5AcKDN/Neu5Acμg/g wet tissuemol/100 molNormal ovaryEthanol-soluble0.45351.5Combined precipitates0.111350.10Total0.561700.36Tumor ovaryEthanol-soluble0.77146.3Combined precipitates0.102300.05Total0.872440.41Ascites cellsEthanol-soluble1.39.216Combined precipitates0.16820.22Total1.4691.21.8The 100,000 × g supernatant fraction was prepared after cell homogenization and adjusted to 80% ethanol.

This fraction contained sialic acids conjugated to soluble- and membrane-bound glycoproteins and glycolipids. The results represent the mean values obtained from four samples each of normal and ovarian tumor tissues, and ascites cells were collected from the same four ovarian cancer patients. We determined the KDN/Neu5Ac ratio in the ethanol-soluble fraction prepared from different types and stages of ovarian tumors to test the hypothesis that this ratio might correlate with the type and stage of disease. As shown in Table IV, significantly higher KDN/Neu5Ac ratios occurred in all of the ovarian tumors and in the corresponding tumor cells isolated from the ascites fluid of each patient, compared with control normal ovarian tissue. Based on these initial findings, two observations are of particular relevance. First, of the ovarian tissues examined, a mature ovarian teratoma showed a 12-fold increase in the KDN/Neu5Ac ratio. Second, the most dramatic increase overall (22-fold) in this ratio was in ascites cells isolated from a patient with a stage IIIa adenocarcinoma (serous ovarian cyst). A patient with the same type of pathological tumor, but at stage I, showed only a 6.7-fold increase in the KDN/Neu5Ac ratio. These results suggest that a positive correlation exists between the level of free KDN within these ovarian adenocarcinomas and the extent of invasion or stage of malignancy. Although the number of patients in this initial study was too small to draw definitive conclusion regarding the usefulness of the comparative value of free KDN as a potential diagnostic and/or prognostic marker for assessing the malignant state, we are encouraged that the high KDN/Neu5Ac ratios observed in ovarian tumors and in tumor cells recovered from the ascites fluid of these patients may represent a clinical and biochemical indicator of cell anomaly.Table IVQuantitative comparison of the free KDN and Neu5Ac ratio in normal and ovarian tumor tissue and in ascites cells isolated from each patientPathological diagnosisTissue or cell examinedKDN/Neu5Acmol/100 molOvarian mature teratoma (26 y)Tumor ovary18Ovarian mucinous cyst adenocarcinoma (36 y)Tumor ovary5.3Ascites cell0.55Ovarian serous cyst adenocarcinoma, stage I (74 y)Tumor ovary5.6Ascites cell10Ovarian serous cyst adenocarcinoma, stage IIIa (25 y)Tumor ovary6.1Ascites cell33Normal (control) ovary1.5The level of free KDN and Neu5Ac was determined in the ethanol-soluble fraction isolated from the normal ovarian tissue and from the ovarian tumor and ascites of each patient, as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in the legend to Table III.

The present method that we have developed for identification and quantitative determination of three different types of Sia (KDN, Neu5Ac, and Neu5Gc) has now provided a facile, sensitive, and specific way to study the level and type of these Sia residues in normal and malignant cells. The key to our instrumental analysis (Fig. 3 a) is an HPLC system equipped with a fluorescent detector, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This method is capable of detecting as little as 1 pmol of KDN and can readily identify and quantitatively determine the amounts of KDN in normal ovarian tissue (Fig. 3 b), ovarian tumor tissue (Fig. 3 c), and ascites cells collected from the same patient (Fig. 3 d). The data in Fig. 3 (b–d) also show that no Neu5Gc was detected in any of the ovarian tumor examined thus far, although this Sia was previously reported to be expressed in other types of human cancers and established tumor cell lines (23Higashi H.

First, elevated levels of free KDN in fetal cord red blood cells compared with matched maternal red blood cells is an intriguing observation that may be developmentally related to blood cell formation and the multi- or pluripotential stem cell formation during embryogenesis. To challenge this hypothesis will require a systematic study of KDN levels in different committed stem cells and other differentiated, end stage cells represented by red blood cells, including platelets, neutrophils, monocytes, basophils, B and T cells, and NK cells. It may also be informative to determine the free KDN/Neu5Ac ratios in different hematopoietic malignancies and in the myriad of hematological dyscrasias. Second, the enhanced level of free KDN in ovarian cancer cells compared with normal ovarian tissue leads us to hypothesize that this level could conceivably be used as an “early warning” signal or predictive marker for the detection of the potentially malignant phenotype in ovarian and perhaps other human cancers. This elevation was particularly striking in ascites cells from a patient with a stage III adenocarcinoma compared with a stage I tumor of the same type. Such a marker may also provide an adjunctive way to monitor for recurrence of tumor. It is therefore possible that free KDN levels, like surface expression of the α2,8-polySia glycotope, may be an oncofetal antigen for ovarian cancer, as polySia is for a number of human tumors (reviewed in Ref. 12Troy F.A. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 95-144Crossref Google Scholar). These studies raise several important questions that remain to be answered. First, where does free KDN come from, i.e. how is it synthesized? Second, what regulates the intracellular level of KDN? And third, do increased intracellular levels of KDN regulate expression of any of the genes encoding for the enzymes leading to (a) KDN synthesis (KDN synthase); (b) activation (CMP-KDN synthetase); and/or (c) transfer (KDN transferase)? Answers to the latter two questions must await the cloning and detailed examination of the genes and enzymes responsible for KDN activation and transfer. However, our recent studies on the biosynthesis of KDN in trout testis, an organ rich in KDN (25Yu S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21929-21935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yu S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Khoo K.-H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Inoue Y. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), have been instructive in addressing the origin of KDN (27Angata T. Identification and Characterization of Enzymes Involved in the Metabolism of KDN and KDN-glycans in Animal Cells.Ph.D. thesis. University of Tokyo, 1997Google Scholar, 28Angata T. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Troy F.A. Abstract Book for XIXth International Carbohydrate Symposium, CP022. University of California, San Diego1998Google Scholar). These studies have shown that KDN is synthesized from mannose (Man) via the following three sequential reactions:Man+ATP→Man­6­P+ADPMan­6­P+PEP→KDN­9­P+PiKDN­9­P→KDN+PiREACTIONS 1–3Reaction 1, catalyzed by a hexokinase, is the 6-O-phosphorylation of Man to form Man-6-P. Reaction 2, catalyzed by KDN-9-P synthetase, condenses Man-6-P and P-enolpyruvate (PEP) to form KDN-9-P. Reaction 3, catalyzed by a phosphatase, is the dephosphorylation of KDN-9-P to yield free KDN. It is not known if a kinase specific for Man (Reaction 1) and a phosphatase specific for KDN-9-P (Reaction 3) may exist in tissues actively synthesizing KDN. It does appear, however, that the KDN-9-P synthetase (Reaction 2) is at least one enzyme that is uniquely specific in the KDN biosynthetic pathway. This conclusion is based on substrate competition experiments, which have shown that this enzyme is distinct from Neu5Ac 9-phosphate synthetase, the enzyme that catalyzes the condensationN-acetyl-d-mannosamine-6-P and P-enolpyruvate to form Neu5Ac 9-phosphate, the immediate precursor to Neu5Ac (27Angata T. Identification and Characterization of Enzymes Involved in the Metabolism of KDN and KDN-glycans in Animal Cells.Ph.D. thesis. University of Tokyo, 1997Google Scholar,28Angata T. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Troy F.A. Abstract Book for XIXth International Carbohydrate Symposium, CP022. University of California, San Diego1998Google Scholar). Man-6-P appears to be derived from the phosphorylation of Man (Reaction 1) and not from the conversion of d-fructose 6-phosphate to Man-6-P by phosphomannoisomerase. This conclusion is supported by our findings of free Man in trout ovary and testis, whereas the pool size of free Man-6-P was relatively small (27Angata T. Identification and Characterization of Enzymes Involved in the Metabolism of KDN and KDN-glycans in Animal Cells.Ph.D. thesis. University of Tokyo, 1997Google Scholar, 28Angata T. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Troy F.A. Abstract Book for XIXth International Carbohydrate Symposium, CP022. University of California, San Diego1998Google Scholar). It was previously reported that the concentration of free Man in normal human serum is approximately 20–50 μm (29Panneerselvam K. Etchison J.R. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23123-23129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the present study, the concentration of free KDN in adult red blood cells was about 2 μm, whereas in fetal cord red blood cells it was about 5 μm. We have also shown that pig salivary glands actively involved in synthesis of Neu5Gc/Neu5Ac-containing glycoconjugates contain high levels of free KDN. 2S. Inoue, unpublished results. Moreover, we have also recently obtained evidence that the levels of free and bound forms of KDN in cultured mammalian cell lines are increased when the cells are grown in the presence of extracellular Man, but notN-acetyl-d-mannosamine, the precursor of Neu5Ac. 3T. Angata, unpublished results. These findings taken together thus show a positive correlation between the intracellular levels of free Man and free and conjugated KDN and emphasize the importance of additional studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating KDN expression at both the gene and enzyme level. Our present findings also indicate that the intracellular accumulation of free KDN does not appreciably increase the level of CMP-KDN, presumably because KDN is a poor substrate for CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase (30Terada T. Kitazume S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Ito F. Troy F.A. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2640-2648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, only a small proportion of the free KDN is activated to CMP-KDN, thus maintaining the relatively higher level of free KDN in these cells. Our results also suggest that the activity of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase, a key enzyme regulating Neu5Ac synthesis, is not affected by the low, steady-state level of CMP-KDN, even though this sugar nucleotide may control its activity by feedback inhibition. While the reason(s) for higher free KDN levels in fetal cord red blood cells and malignant human ovarian cancer cells remains unclear, further studies on the de novo synthesis, transport, storage, catabolism, and potential oncofetal nature of KDN in normal human cells and their malignant counterparts are required. Such studies should prove of critical importance to fully develop this aspect of the biochemistry, molecular biology, and glycopathology of KDN that has not been previously reported."

Detailed comparative analysis, however, reveals subtle differences among these four enzymes including distinctive substrate specificity, tolerance of the archaebacterial enzymes for acidic pHs and elevated temperatures, and variations in the metal-ion dependence of substrate cleavage. Although the archaebacterial enzymes were inactive at temperatures below 30 °C, DNA binding occurred at temperatures as low as 4 °C and with or without metal ions.

DNA replication, recombination, and repair, which are essential for maintaining human genome stability, all depend on the activity of enzymes possessing 5′→ 3′ exonuclease activity. In repair, this activity is essential for damaged fragment excision and recombinational mismatch correction, whereas in replication this activity plays a critical role in the efficient processing of Okazaki fragments during lagging strand DNA synthesis (1Lindahl T.

In eukaryotic organisms this activity is provided by FEN-11 (Five′ExoNuclease or FlapEndoNuclease), a 40-kDa Mg2+-dependent metallonuclease that recognizes and cleaves branched nucleic acid structures containing a single-stranded 5′ flap (the junction where the two strands of duplex DNA adjoin a single-stranded arm) regardless of sequence and without the need for accessory proteins (7Goulian M.

The enzyme is unable to cleave bubble substrates, 3′ single-stranded flaps, heterologous loops, and Holliday junctions; however, acting as an exonuclease, FEN-1 will affect hydrolysis of double-stranded DNA substrates containing a nick, gap, or a 3′ overhang, albeit at reduced efficiency (9Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 14Robins P. Pappin D.J.C. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28535-28538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The endonuclease activity of the enzyme is independent of the 5′ flap length, cleaving a 5′ flap as small as one nucleotide, whereas the endonuclease and exonuclease activities are insensitive to the chemical nature of the substrate, cleaving both DNA and RNA (15Murante R.S. Huang L. Turchi J.J. Bambara R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1191-1196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although FEN-1 is able to cleave a pseudo-Y structure (see Table I, substrate 3), the catalytic efficiency of both the endo- and exonuclease activities is significantly stimulated by the presence of an upstream primer (9Harrington J.J.

Recently, FEN-1 was proposed to act in the removal of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites via participation in an alternative base-excision repair pathway involving DNA polymerase, HAP-1, DNA ligase, and the polymerase processivity factor, PCNA (17Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The polymerase acting in this pathway was originally postulated to be polymerase β; however, recent evidence suggests either pol δ or pol ε provides this activity (18Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The involvement of the processivity factor in the pathway likely reflects an interaction between PCNA and FEN-1 as complementary biochemical and genetic experiments have convincingly demonstrated that FEN-1 activity is stimulated by specific interactions between these two proteins (19Li X.

Most of the in vivo functional analyses of the FEN-1 gene have been carried out in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaeand Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The S. cerevisiaeFEN-1 homologue is named RAD27 (or RTH1, YKL510), whereas in S. pombe it is named rad2 (24Jacquier A. Legrain P. Dujon B. Yeast. 1992; 8: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Murray J.M. Tavassoli M. Al-harithy R. Sheldrick K.S. Lehmann A.R. Carr A.M. Watts F.Z. Mol. Cell.

Mutations in RAD27 result in marked sensitivity to alkylating agents, modest sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation, and chromosome instability. Studies in S. pombe further indicate that rad2 is likely critical for the efficient removal of UV-induced photo-dimers, and deletion mutants display a temperature-sensitive growth defect and accumulate in S phase, apparently owing to a block in DNA replication (25Murray J.M. Tavassoli M. Al-harithy R. Sheldrick K.S. Lehmann A.R. Carr A.M. Watts F.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4878-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 26Reagan M.S. Pittenger C. Siede W.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4193-4196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Simple repetitive DNA stability also requires FEN-1, as a RAD27 null mutation in S. cerevisiae leads to an increase in the mutation rate of simple repetitive DNA by as much as 280-fold. Epistasis analysis suggests this is consistent with RAD27 playing a role in the MSH2-MSH6-MLH1-PMS1 post-replication mismatch repair pathway, which is implicated as a causative agent of colorectal cancer (28Johnson R.E. Kovvali G.K. Prakash L. Prakash S. Science. 1995; 269: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, Kolodner's group has shown that the majority of these mutations are due to sequence duplications flanked by short repeats and suggest that RAD27 is critical for processing replication intermediates. In the absence of RAD27, replication intermediates were processed via a Rad51- and Rad52-dependent double-strand break repair mechanism and, to a lesser extent, by a mutagenic repair pathway leading to the observed duplications (29Tishkoff D.X. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In addition, RAD27 has an active role in preventing trinucleotide repeat expansion and contraction, as the same rad27 mutant showed evidence of length-dependent destabilization of CTG tracts and a marked increase in their expansion frequency. These observations suggest that FEN-1 mutants in humans may lead to genetic diseases such as myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease, several ataxias, fragile X syndrome, and a number of cancers, all of which result from trinucleotide repeat expansion and sequence duplications (29Tishkoff D.X.

The FEN-1 enzymes are functionally related to several smaller bacteriophage 5′→3′ exonucleases such as T5 5′ exonuclease and T4 RNase H (32Hollingsworth H.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol.

In eubacteria such as Escherichia coli and Thermus aquaticus, Okazaki processing is provided by the DNA polymerase I (PolI) 5′→3′ exonuclease domain (2Lyamichev V. Brow M.A.V. Dahlberg J.E.

These bacterial and phage enzymes share two areas of limited sequence homology with FEN-1, which are termed the N (N-terminal) and I (intermediate) regions, with the residue similarities concentrated around seven conserved acidic residues (14Robins P.

Chem. 273, in pressGoogle Scholar), these residues have been proposed to bind two Mg2+ ions that are required for affecting DNA hydrolysis; however, the role each metal plays in the catalytic cycle, which is subtly different for each enzyme, is not well understood. Although the sequence similarity between FEN-1 and prokaryotic and viral 5′→3′ exonucleases is low, FEN-1s within the eukaryotic kingdom are highly conserved at the amino acid level, with the human and S. cerevisiae proteins being 60% identical and 78% similar. Recently, we surveyed the genomes of three archaebacteria,Archaeglobus fulgidus, Methanococcus jannaschii, and Pyrococcus furiosus, and found that unlike all viral and eubacterial systems so far examined, these extreme thermophiles encode proteins that are highly homologous to the eukaryotic FEN-1 enzymes (41Shen B. Qiu J. Hosfield D. Tainer J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 171-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here, we report the cloning, overexpression, and purification of all three enzymes. Biochemical analyses of these archaebacterial enzymes allowed comparison of the properties of these nucleases with their eukaryotic counterparts, and the results identify both key functional similarities and informative distinctions between the two groups. The common biochemical properties of the archaebacterial and human FEN-1 enzymes demonstrate that these two groups of enzymes likely employ similar catalytic mechanisms. This conservation of FEN-1 enzymes between the eukaryotic and archaeal kingdoms supports the fundamental role of FEN-1 in cell biology and provides the basis for detailed comparative studies of these FEN-1 enzymes to define the structural chemistry underlying their structure-specific nuclease activities. Restriction enzymes and bovine serum albumin were obtained from New England Biolabs, and chromatography materials were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protein concentrations were determined using either the calculated ε280 value or with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). All buffers, salts, and reagents were of the highest available purity and were purchased from Fisher Scientific. Oligonucleotides for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and those used in the biochemical assays were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems, Inc. DNA synthesizer in the City of Hope National Cancer Center core facility. ArchaebacterialFEN-1 homologues were identified with the NCBI BLAST search engine (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) using the human FEN-1 amino acid sequence. The M. jannaschii gene (mFEN-1), which was used as a template for PCR, was obtained from ATCC (construct AMJIM93), whereas the P. furiosus and A. fulgidus genes (pFEN-1 and aFEN-1, respectively) were cloned via PCR using genomic DNA generously supplied by F. Robb (University of Maryland) and R. Robson (University of Reading), respectively. For all three genes, the PCR primers were designed such that an NdeI site was introduced at the translation start site and a BamHI site was introduced in the 3′-untranslated region. These PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI, and the resulting product was ligated into pET-15B (Novagen), which incorporates a 6 × histidine tail at the N terminus of the protein. In each case, the DNA sequence was verified at the Scripps Research Institute core sequencing facility. All of the plasmids containing the archaebacterial FEN-1 genes were transformed into theE. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen), and protein overexpression was induced in log phase cells by adding isopropylthiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.6 mm. Following growth for an additional 6 h, the cells were pelleted, taken up in buffer H1 (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole), sonicated briefly to resuspend the cells, lysed by heating the suspension at 75 °C for 45 min, and then cooled rapidly to 0 °C in an ice water bath. This protocol, which takes advantage of the archaebacterial protein's thermostability, not only lysed the cells but also precipitated the majority of the contaminating mesophilic proteins. The resulting solution was centrifuged at 25,000 × g, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 25-ml Ni-NTA-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated in buffer H1. After washing with 200 ml of H1, the FEN-1 proteins were eluted with H1 containing 500 mmimidazole and then extensively dialyzed against buffer F1 (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA). Although these two steps provided protein that was approximately 95% pure, the protein was further purified by passage over a Superdex-75 fast protein liquid chromatography column. The oligonucleotides used for both enzyme binding and cleavage experiments were as follows: 1) 34-nucleotide single-stranded (ss) DNA substrate, 5′-GATGTCAAGCAGTCCTAACTTTGAGGCAGAGTCC (oligo 1); 2) flap substrate-1 was prepared as described by Harrington and Lieber (11Nolan J.P. Shen B. Park M.S. Sklar L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11668-11676Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) by annealing oligo 1 to a 16-nucleotide (nt) adjacent strand, 5′-CACGTTGACTACCGTC (oligo 2), and a 30-nt template strand, 5′-GGACTCTGCCTCAAGACGGTAGTCAACGTG (oligo3), to give a flap structure with a 20-nt 5′ single-stranded arm; 3) the pseudo-Y substrate was prepared by annealing oligos 1 and 3; 4) a 3′ overhang was prepared by annealing the 15-nt-long oligo 3 to 5′-CTTGAGGCAGAGTCC (oligo 4) to give a structure with a 15-nt-long 3′ overhang; 5) duplex DNA was prepared by annealing oligo 4 with its complement 5′-GGACTCTGCCTCAGG (oligo 5); 6) a 5′ overhang was prepared by annealing oligo 3 to a 15-nt 5′-CACGTTGACTACCGT (oligo 6) to give a pseudo-Y structure missing the 3′ single-stranded region; 7) a nicked duplex, which is the best exonuclease substrate for calf FEN-1 (15Murante R.S. Huang L. Turchi J.J. Bambara R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1191-1196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was formed by annealing oligos 3, 4, and 6; 8) flap substrate-2, which was prepared to examine the effect of a GC base pair at the flap junction, was prepared by annealing the 16-nt-long oligo-7 5′CAGCAACGCAAGCTTG, the 19-nt-long oligo 8 5′TAGCAGGCTGCAGGTCGAC, and the 30-nt-long oligo 9 5′GTCGACCTGCAGCCCAAGCTTGCGTTGCTG. All of the above oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and in each of the structures described, one of the oligos was end labeled using [γ-32P]dATP (Dupont) and T4-polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Binding assays were performed using the method of Harrington and Lieber (42Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4503-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the indicated amounts of FEN-1 were mixed with 10 fmol of labeled DNA in a final volume of 13 μl containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. After a 5-min incubation period on ice, each binding reaction was loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 × TBE and electrophoresed for 90 min at 125V at 4 °C; the dried gels were then exposed to Kodak film for imaging. Endonuclease assays were generally performed using substrates 2, 3, and 8 according to the method of Harrington and Lieber (9Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In a final volume of 13 μl, varying amounts of FEN-1 and 1.54 pmol of labeled DNA were incubated at different temperatures for 30 min before the reaction was quenched with an equal volume of stop solution (10 mm EDTA, 95% deionized formamide, and 0.008% bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol). Reactions were electrophoresed through denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gels, and the relative amounts of starting material and product were quantitated using the IPLabGel system (Stratagene) running MacBAS image analysis software. Most reactions were performed in standard assay buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mmMgCl2, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin); however, in a series of experiments the effect of different divalent metals and pH levels was studied by varying the standard buffer. For divalent metals, MgCl2 was omitted, and different metal ions were used at a final concentration of 10 mm. To study the influence of pH, buffers containing differing amounts of Tris, glycine, and sodium acetate were used at a final concentration of 10 mm to obtain a wide range of pH levels at 25 °C as described previously (9Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Exonuclease activities were assayed using a nicked duplex (substrate 7) under conditions identical to those described for the endonuclease assays. The precise positions of DNA cleavage in both the exonuclease and endonuclease experiments were obtained by partial digestion of the 5′ 32P-labeled template strand (oligo 3) using the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of Klenow fragment (New England BioLabs). FEN-1 cleavage kinetics were performed under standard conditions as described in the endonuclease assay by using varying concentrations of DNA substrates and constant amounts of FEN-1 (hFEN-1, 30 ng; aFEN-1, 200 ng; mFEN-1, 300 ng; and pFEN-1, 400 ng). For the hFEN-1 enzyme reaction kinetics were performed at 30 °C, whereas the archaebacterial enzymes were assayed at 55 °C, the highest temperature at which our standard substrate could be used. Reactions were initiated by combining standard reaction buffer, substrate, and enzyme in that order. Samples were mixed and incubated for 10 min, and the initial velocity was calculated by measuring products and substrate intensity on the gel by using IPLab Gel and converted using the equation v = {I 1/(I 0 + 0.5I 1)t} × [substrate], wheret = time in seconds, I 1 = product intensity, I 0 = final substrate concentration, and substrate concentration is expressed in nm. This calculation modifies the original equation established by Petruska et al. (43Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Boosalis M.S. Sowers L.C. Cheong C. Tinoco I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) so that velocity is expressed as converted substrate concentration/time as opposed to converted percent substrate/time. These velocity units are more appropriate for our kinetic analysis. V max and K m values were calculated by directly fitting the data to Michaelis-Menten equation using Quickgraph software (Quickgraph, CA). By using data provided by three microbial genome-sequencing projects (44Klenk H.P. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 45Bult C.J. et al.Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar, 46Borges K.M. Brummet S.R. Bogert A. Genome Sci. Technol. 1996; 1: 37-46Crossref Google Scholar), three putative open reading frames were identified that shared a significant degree of homology to the mammalian FEN-1 family of structure-specific endonucleases (Fig. 1). Multisequence automated alignment established sequence similarity and conservation of all key residues implicated by mutagenesis in substrate binding and catalysis (37Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. WH Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). As a first step toward the characterization of the enzymatic properties of these archaebacterial nucleases, a PCR-based approach was used to clone the genes from the thermophilic organisms P. furiosus, M. jannaschii, and A. fulgidus, such that the feasibility of protein overexpression in E. coli could be determined. Overexpression of the archaebacterial nucleases, in the T7-polymerase containing bacterium BL21(DE3), typically led to FEN-1 being produced at approximately 5% of total cellular protein. Each protein was purified to near homogeneity using methods that first exploited the enhanced thermal stability of the archaebacterial proteins. Thus, before subjecting each protein to Ni2+affinity and conventional gel filtration chromatography, the solubilized cell extract was heated at 75 °C for 45 min to precipitate mesophilic proteins that were removed by centrifugation. For all three archaebacterial FEN-1 proteins, these procedures yielded protein that was greater than 95% pure (Fig. 2). However, mFEN-1 always copurified with small amounts of ∼30-kDa and ∼10-kDa fragments. N-terminal sequencing of these fragments revealed that they resulted from proteolytic cleavage of the enzyme between Arg91 and Lys92 and suggests that this region may be devoid of any stable secondary structure. Consistent with results obtained for hFEN-1, gel permeation chromatography through a fast protein liquid chromatography Sepharose S-100 column indicated that each archaeal protein behaved as a monomer at concentrations near 100 μm.Figure 2Purity of active recombinant archaebacterial and human flap endonucleases.

Bioessays. 1997; 19: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and among the more than 14 substrates tested, only flap structures, pseudo-Y structures, gaps, nicks, and 3′ overhangs were substrates for the enzyme. To test the substrate binding preferences of the archaebacterial FEN-1s, we employed seven different substrates (listed as 1–7 in Table I) and compared the results with hFEN-1. After incubating different amounts of each FEN-1 enzyme with the various DNA substrates in the absence of Mg2+, binding was visualized on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. All three archaebacterial enzymes had binding specificities that are similar to the human enzyme (Fig. 3). Thus, all the archaebacterial FEN-1s bind to flap, pseudo Y, 3′ overhang, and nicked DNA structures with affinities closely matching hFEN-1. Further, like the human enzy"

Promoter and enhancer sequences of several genes for ornithine cycle enzymes interact with members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) transcription factor family. Disruption of the C/EBPα gene in mice causes hypoglycemia associated with the impaired expression of gluconeogenic enzymes. Here we examined the expression of ornithine cycle enzyme genes in the livers of C/EBPα-deficient mice. mRNA levels for the first, third, fourth, and fifth enzymes of five enzymes in the cycle were decreased in C/EBPα-deficient mice. Protein levels for the first, second, fourth, and fifth enzymes were also decreased. In situhybridization analysis revealed that the enzyme mRNAs were distributed normally in the periportal region but were disordered in C/EBPα-deficient mice with relatively higher mRNA levels in the midlobular region. Blood ammonia concentrations in the mutant mice were severalfold higher than in wild-type mice. Thus, C/EBPα is crucial for ammonia detoxification by ornithine cycle enzymes and for coordination of gluconeogenesis and urea synthesis.

Urea synthesis and gluconeogenesis, representative traits of the liver, are closely related to each other with regard to amino acid metabolism. Deamination of the α-amino group of amino acids produces ammonia, a toxic metabolite that is detoxified by conversion into urea via the ornithine cycle in the liver. On the other hand, carbon skeletons derived from deaminated amino acids are primarily converted into glucose by gluconeogenic enzymes. Besides this relationship, the ornithine cycle and the gluconeogenic pathway are correlated by sharing common steps in two enzymatic reactions (1Jungas R.L. Halperin M.L. Brosnan J.T. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 419-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Reflecting these close relationships, genes for both pathways are regulated in a coordinate manner. Urea synthesis and gluconeogenesis are induced in the perinatal period and postnatally are up- or down-regulated by dietary changes, generally in the same direction (reviewed in Refs. 2Morris Jr., S.M.

Because mice homozygous for the disrupted C/EBPα allele die within 8 h of birth (20Wang N.-D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J.

Total RNA was extracted from the liver and subjected to blot analysis for measuring mRNA levels for the five enzymes of the ornithine cycle. Representative chemiluminograms and quantified results are shown in Fig. 1. mRNA levels for β-actin were apparently higher in mice of newborn homozygous –/– litters as previously reported (21Flodby P. Barlow C. Kylefjord H. Ährlund-Richter L. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24753-24760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In both newborn and 5–7-hour-old animals, the mRNA level for the first enzyme, CPS, was dramatically decreased in –/– mice, although no apparent difference was observed between wild-type +/+ and heterozygous +/− mice. The mRNA encoding the second enzyme, OTC, was variable especially at 5–7 h from one littermate to another irrespective of the genotype, and no significant difference was observed. Fluctuation of the OTC mRNA levels may reflect sharp increases of this mRNA within 1–2 days after birth (37Morris Jr., S.M. Kepka D.M. Sweeney Jr., W.E. Avner E.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). mRNA levels for the third enzyme, AS, in –/– mice were reduced to 80 and 50% of those in +/− mice at newborn and 5–7-hour-old stages, respectively. mRNA levels for the fourth enzyme, AL, and the last enzyme, arginase, were remarkably lowered in C/EBPα –/– mice. Therefore, a C/EBPα deficiency led to decreases in mRNA levels for four of five ornithine cycle enzyme genes. To assess changes in protein levels for the enzymes, liver extracts from 5–7-hour-old litters were subjected to immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2). CPS was below the detectable level in –/– mice. OTC protein levels in –/– mice were decreased to 60% of those in +/− mice despite there being no significant difference in mRNA levels (Fig. 1). This reduction in OTC protein may be because of differences in OTC mRNA levels at earlier embryonic stages leading to variations in accumulated protein in the perinatal period and/or because of indirect effects of C/EBPα deficiency on synthesis or degradation of the OTC protein. On the other hand, differences of AS protein levels between genotypes were less distinct than those of AS mRNA levels, presumably from causes contrary to those for OTC. AL protein levels in –/– mice were lowered to 50% of those in +/− mice. Arginase was barely detectable in –/– mice. Coomassie staining of total proteins separated by gel electrophoresis revealed that several bands were specifically diminished in –/– mice. One of these bands corresponded to the protein empirically known to be CPS. In summary, protein levels of four ornithine cycle enzymes were decreased in –/– mice. In situhybridization analysis was done to examine the lobular distribution of the mRNAs in livers of newborn mice (Fig. 3). Similar to the previous results for the normal rat liver (35Dingemanse M.A. de Jonge W.J. de Boer P.A.J. Mori M. Lamers W.H. Moorman A.F.M. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 407-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in +/− mice, mRNAs for the enzymes, except for CPS, were most abundant in the periportal region and gradually decreased toward the central vein exhibiting a distribution pattern called zonation (35Dingemanse M.A. de Jonge W.J. de Boer P.A.J. Mori M. Lamers W.H. Moorman A.F.M. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 407-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Moorman A.F.M. de Boer P.A.J. Geerts W.J.C. van de Zande L. Lamers W.H. Charles R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 36: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Indistinguishably similar patterns were observed in +/+ mice (data not shown). CPS mRNA in +/− mice, as well as in +/+ mice (data not shown), exhibited a homogeneous distribution over the liver lobule. It was reported that the portal-to-central gradient of CPS mRNA becomes apparent at 1.5 days after birth (35Dingemanse M.A. de Jonge W.J. de Boer P.A.J. Mori M. Lamers W.H. Moorman A.F.M. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 407-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In –/– mice, aberrant patterns were evident especially for OTC and AS mRNAs, which showed high level expressions in midlobular regions. Residual mRNAs for CPS and arginase in –/– mice also exhibited relatively higher levels in midlobular regions, whereas residual AL mRNA showed a uniform distribution in all lobular compartments. Therefore, zonation characterized by portal-to-central gradients in gene expression for the ornithine cycle enzymes was disordered in –/– mice. Because a decrease in the expression of the ornithine cycle enzyme genes or a difference in the localization of cells expressing these genes may cause impaired ammonia detoxification, we measured blood ammonia concentrations in mice of each genotype from the same litter (Table I). Ammonia levels in +/+ and +/− mice exhibited considerable variability, presumably reflecting rapid increases in ammonia levels during the first postnatal day (39Koizumi T. Hayakawa J. Nikaido H. Lab. Anim. Sci. 1990; 40: 308-311PubMed Google Scholar). In –/– mice, ammonia concentrations were elevated compared with +/+ and +/− mice. We also measured blood glucose concentrations. Concordant with previous reports (20Wang N.-D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J.

Therefore, hyperammonemia was associated to hypoglycemia in –/– mice.Table IBlood glucose and ammonia levelsLitterGenotypeNo. of animalsGlucoseAmmoniamg/dlμg/dl1+/+17582−/−220>40023>400+/−586 ± 4.21-aFor heterozygous animals, glucose and ammonia concentrations are represented as the mean ± S.E.144 ± 162+/+271779048−/−315>40015>40013>400+/−580 ± 9.083 ± 9.73+/+28722210254−/−323>40024>40013>400+/−590 ± 13135 ± 241-a For heterozygous animals, glucose and ammonia concentrations are represented as the mean ± S.E. Open table in a new tab In higher eukaryotes such as mammals, there have been few genetic demonstrations of the presence of transcriptional regulators that control multiple steps in a metabolic pathway and even fewer for regulators that coordinate multiple related metabolic pathways. We found that C/EBPα is critical for the expression of ornithine cycle enzyme genes. Taken together with previous reports for a crucial role in gluconeogenesis (20Wang N.-D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A.

Jungas et al. (1Jungas R.L. Halperin M.L. Brosnan J.T. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 419-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) postulated that the gluconeogenic pathway and the ornithine cycle are closely interrelated because the reactions catalyzed by AS and AL are common to both pathways. Therefore, these two pathways constitute a “metabolic block.” Control of this block by a common transcription factor C/EBPα represents a paradigm for a highly coordinated form of gene regulation. Studies with in vitro assays and transfections into cultured cells have shown that members of the C/EBP family interact with regulatory regions of the genes for CPS (6Howell B.W. Lagacé M. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), OTC (7Murakami T. Nishiyori A. Takiguchi M. Mori M. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1991; 266: 9186-9193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gotoh T. Haraguchi Y. Takiguchi M. Mori M. J. Biochem.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3694-3698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The present findings of a dramatic fall in the expression of CPS and arginase genes in the livers of C/EBPα-deficient mice are consistent with these previous observations and underline the importance of C/EBPα in the regulation of the expression of these two genes. However, our previous studies have shown that C/EBPβ rather than C/EBPα activates the arginase promoter more strongly (12Chowdhury S. Gotoh T. Mori M. Takiguchi M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 500-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and is more crucial for stimulation of the arginase enhancer in response to glucocorticoids (13Gotoh T. Chowdhury S.

Mori M. Takiguchi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that C/EBPα is involved in basal level expression of the gene, whereas C/EBPβ is important for high level expression of the arginase gene induced by glucocorticoids in response to dietary changes, etc. Because no apparent compensatory change in mRNA (20Wang N.-D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar) and protein (21Flodby P.

OTC mRNA levels were not affected in the C/EBPα-deficient mice; however, the lobular distribution of the OTC mRNA was disordered. OTC protein levels were decreased in neonatal –/– mice, and it remains to be examined whether, in the embryonic stages, OTC mRNA levels were lowered. In cell transfection studies (9Nishiyori A. Tashiro H. Kimura A. Akagi K. Yamamura K. Mori M. Takiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1323-1331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the OTC enhancer was activated almost exclusively by C/EBPβ in combination with another liver-enriched transcription factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor-4. Further investigations are required to clarify the differential roles, if any, of C/EBP family members in regulation of the OTC gene. As for the AS and AL genes, no C/EBP-binding site has been detected in the promoter regions of these genes (41Anderson G.M. Freytag S.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1935-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 42Matsubasa T. Takiguchi M. Matsuda I. Mori M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1044-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The present results underscore the importance of re-examination of promoter regions for binding of C/EBP family members and/or searches for remote C/EBP-responsive enhancer-like regions of these genes, although the possibility of indirect effects of C/EBPα deficiency on AS and AL gene expression cannot be formally ruled out. C/EBPα –/– mice exhibited disordered lobular zonation in the distribution of mRNAs for the ornithine cycle enzymes. The highest mRNA levels were detected around the midlobular region in –/– mice, whereas in control mice the majority of mRNAs were localized to the periportal region. Moorman et al. (43Moorman A.F.M. van den Hoff M.J.B. de Boer P.A.J. Charles R. Lamers W.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) reported that C/EBPα mRNA was distributed homogeneously in a lobule of the normal adult rat liver and that dexamethasone treatment caused elevation of the mRNA levels in the pericentral region. Therefore, the distribution pattern of C/EBPα mRNA by itself cannot explain the zonations of mRNAs for the enzymes or their disrupted patterns in –/– mice. Regulation of C/EBPα function by translational and post-translational events, such as nuclear transport, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, and interaction with other factors, might bring about activation of target genes preferentially in the periportal region. This possibility remains to be examined especially in neonatal mice. Previous analyses of C/EBPα –/– mice showed decreases in mRNA levels for glycogen synthase (20Wang N.-D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A.

Recently, a conditional knockout study using targeted insertion of loxPsequences followed by the delivery of a Cre recombinase adenovirus showed that the C/EBPα deficiency in the adult mouse liver results in severe jaundice associated with reduced expression of bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (44Lee Y.-H. Sauer B. Johnson P.F. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6014-6022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this conditional knockout study, decreased mRNA levels for blood coagulation factor IX were also noted (44Lee Y.-H. Sauer B. Johnson P.F. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6014-6022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together with the present observation of hyperammonemia, C/EBPα-deficient mice have disorders in a number of main liver functions and can provide a model of human liver diseases. Symptoms in the mutant mice are reminiscent of neonatal liver failure accompanied by multiple biochemical abnormalities including coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, and hyperammonemia (45Shneider B.L. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 1996; 8: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Activation or functional compensation of C/EBPα and other C/EBP family members can be a target for therapy of such disorders. We thank T. Bilyeu, M. Wilde, T. Gotoh, G. Wright, M.

In 1996, as participants in the Bacillus genome project (33Kunst F. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3088) Google Scholar), Sekiguchi and co-workers determined the nucleotide sequence of a 12.4-kb fragment of DNA near the 76° region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome (34Yamamoto H. Uchiyama S. Fajar A.N. Ogasawara N. Sekiguchi J. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1417-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Following translation of the ten open reading frames within this fragment, a search of the protein data bases revealed that the deduced amino acid sequences of open reading framesglv-1 and glv-2 exhibited similarity to 6-phospho-β-glucosidase and the IIC domain (GlvC) of the arbutin (PEP-PTS) of E. coli, respectively. It seemed likely, as suggested by Yamamoto et al. (34Yamamoto H. Uchiyama S. Fajar A.N. Ogasawara N. Sekiguchi J. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1417-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), that the products of glv-1 and glv-2 might participate in the transport and dissimilation of β-glucosides in the Gram-positive spore-forming organism. Contemporaneous with the Bacillusstudies in Japan, our program at the National Institutes of Health was directed toward the purification and characterization of a metal-dependent maltose 6-phosphate hydrolase (MalH) from the anaerobic pathogen Fusobacterium mortiferum (35Thompson J. Gentry-Weeks C.R. Nguyen N.Y. Folk J.E. Robrish S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2505-2512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This novel enzyme, together with an inducible maltose PEP-PTS permits growth of F. mortiferum on a wide variety of α-glucosides including maltose, α-methyl glucoside, trehalose, palatinose, and turanose (36Robrish S.A. Fales H.M. Gentry-Weeks C.R. Thompson J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3250-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 6-phospho-α-glucosidase gene (malH) has recently been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in E. coli(37Bouma C.L. Reizer J. Reizer A. Robrish S.A. Thompson J. J.

Remarkably, the deduced amino acid sequence of MalH exhibited 73% identity (88% similarity) to that deduced from the nucleotide sequence of glv-1 in B. subtilis. These findings raised doubts concerning the initial classification and catalytic activity of the polypeptide encoded by glv-1 (34Yamamoto H. Uchiyama S. Fajar A.N. Ogasawara N. Sekiguchi J. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1417-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In a collaborative program, we have addressed and resolved these issues. This communication describes the cloning, expression, and site-directed mutagenesis of glv-1 (now designatedglvA (33Kunst F. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3088) Google Scholar)) from B. subtilis. Purification and characterization of the novel 6-phospho-α-glucosidase (GlvA) encoded by glvA was facilitated by the availability of the natural substrate for the enzyme (maltose 6-phosphate) and by chemical synthesis of the chromogenic and fluorogenic analogs pNPαGlc6P and 4MUαGlc6P, respectively. In contrast to other phosphoglycosylhydrolases, GlvA from B. subtilis exhibits specific requirements for both divalent metal (Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, or Ni2+) and NAD(H) for activity. Furthermore, by sequence similarity and conservation of functionally important acidic residues, GlvA can be assigned to the nine-member family 4 of the glycosylhydrolase superfamily (31Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2574) Google Scholar, 37Bouma C.L. Reizer J. Reizer A. Robrish S.A. Thompson J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4129-4137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PD-10 gel filtration columns, isoelectric focusing standards, Ampholine PAG plates (pH 3.5–9.0), DEAE-Sephacel, and phenyl-Sepharose CL- 4B were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Ultrogel AcA 44 and TrisAcryl DEAE-M were supplied by Sepracor. Enzymes, nucleotides, cofactors, and trehalose 6-phosphate were obtained from Sigma. Trimethylphosphate, phosphorus oxychloride, and cyclohexylamine were obtained from Aldrich. Pressure concentration cells and Diaflo PM-10 ultrafiltration membranes were from Amicon Corp. [U-14C]Maltose 6-phosphate was prepared enzymatically by PEP-dependent phosphorylation of the disaccharide by the maltose PEP-PTS in permeabilized cells of F. mortiferum. The radiolabeled disaccharide phosphate was purified by ion exchange chromatography, Ba2+ and ethanol precipitation, and finally by paper chromatography (36Robrish S.A. Fales H.M. Gentry-Weeks C.R. Thompson J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3250-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chemical syntheses of pNPαGlc6P, pNPαMan6P, pNPαGal6P and 4MUαGlc6P were initiated with the commercially available non-phosphorylated glycosides (Sigma) using the procedure of Wilson and Fox (24Wilson G. Fox C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5586-5598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Selective phosphorylation at the C-6 hydroxyl group of the nonreducing glucopyranose was achieved by use of a mixture of phosphorus oxychloride in trimethylphosphate containing small amounts of water. The phosphorylated derivatives were obtained as white, crystalline cyclohexylamine salts in 25–30% yield. B. subtilis 168 and E. coli strains JM109 and XL1-Blue were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C as described previously (38Ishikawa S. Yamane K. Sekiguchi J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When required, ampicillin was included in the medium at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. E. coliplasmids pUC119 (Takara Shuzo Co., Kyoto) and a high expression vector pKP1500 (39Miki T. Yasukochi T. Nagatani H. Furuno M. Orita T. Yamada H. Imoto T. Horiuchi T. Protein Eng. 1987; 1: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were used to construct a plasmid (pKPglv-1) containingglvA. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by thePfu polymerase method (QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene). The desired mutations and the primers used to effect these changes are described in the text (Table IV).Table IVOligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis of glvA from B. subtilis 168 and resultant activities of the mutant 6-phospho-α-glucosidaseMutationPrimer sequence4-aBase substitutions are shown underlined.Activity4-bActivity expressed as nmol of pNPαGlc6P hydrolyzed/min/mg protein.

Open table in a new tab For the amplification of the gene glvA (alsoglv-1 (33Kunst F. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3088) Google Scholar, 34Yamamoto H. Uchiyama S. Fajar A.N. Ogasawara N. Sekiguchi J. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1417-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)), two primers were synthesized: forward primer G1PEF, 5′-GCCGGAATTC ATGAAGAAAAAATCATTCTCAA-3′ (theglvA sequence is italicized and the EcoRI site is underlined) and reverse primer G1PBR, 5′-GCGCGGATCC CTGATTGATCAGTTCTTCG-3′ (the sequence complimentary to the downstream region of glvA is italicized and the BamHI site is underlined). PCR amplification was performed with the GeneAmp PCR Core kit (Perkin Elmer) using 0.1 μg of B. subtilis 168 genomic DNA as template, 10 μl of 10 × reaction buffer, 8 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 2 μl each of 10 mmdNTP, 30 pmol of each primer, and 0.5 unit of Taq polymerase in a total volume of 100 μl. The annealing temperature was 56 °C. The PCR product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequently digested with EcoRI and BamHI. The 0.5-kb EcoRI and 0.95-kb EcoRI-BamHI restriction fragments corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ regions of glvA, respectively, were purified with GeneClean II kit (BIO 101). The fragments were ligated into the corresponding sites of pUC119 and used for transformation of E. coli JM109. Nucleotide sequences of the fragments inserted into the recombinant plasmids (designated pUC119EE and pUC119EB, respectively) were determined by the following procedure. Transformed cells were boiled in water, and the sample was transferred to the PCR reaction mixture containing universal forward and reverse primers of pUC plasmids (M13 primers M4 and RV; Takara), Taq polymerase, and dNTP. After amplification, the primers were removed by Microcon (Amicon). Sequences were determined using a Taq Dye Primer Cycle Sequencing kit (Perkin Elmer) and a 373A DNA sequencer from Applied Biosystems. After confirmation of the sequences, the 0.95-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment from pUC119EB was purified and ligated to the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pKP1500 to form pKPGEB. Transformants of E. coli JM109 containing the recombinant plasmid were boiled in water and transferred to the PCR reaction mixture containing primers G1PEF and G1PBR, Taq polymerase, and dNTP. After amplification and transformation, those colonies that contained a 1.45-kb DNA restriction fragment were considered to harbor a plasmid (pKPglv-1) containing the insert in the correct orientation. For confirmation, pKPglv-1 plasmid DNA was isolated from the transformant, digested with EcoRI or HindIII, and subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. The size of the restriction fragments corresponded to those expected from the sequence of glvA, thereby confirming the presence of the complete gene in pKPglv-1. E. coli JM109 (pKPglv-1) was grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Cells were harvested by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min at 5 °C) and washed by resuspension and centrifugation from 25 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm MnSO4(TM buffer). The washed cell pellet (∼80 g) was resuspended in 120 ml of TM buffer, and the cells were disrupted (at 0 °C) by 2 × 1.5-min periods of sonic oscillation with a Branson model 350 sonifier operating at ∼75% of maximum power. The enzyme was purified by conventional low pressure chromatography, and all procedures were performed at 4 °C in a cold room. Column flow rates were maintained by a P-1 peristaltic pump interfaced with a Frac-100 collector. Protein in column eluents was monitored at 280 nm by a UV-1 optical control unit connected to a single channel chart recorder (all instrumentation from Pharmacia Biotech). The sonicated preparation was centrifuged (25,000 ×g for 30 min at 5 °C) to remove intact cells and cell debris. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 2 h at 5 °C. The clarified HSS was transferred to dialysis sacs (molecular weight cut-off, 6000–8000) and dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of TM buffer. Dialyzed HSS (∼120 ml) was transferred (0.8 ml/min) to a column (2.6 × 16 cm) of DEAE-TrisAcryl-M previously equilibrated with TM buffer. The column was washed to remove nonadsorbed material, and 6-phospho-α-glucosidase was eluted with 800 ml of a linear, increasing concentration gradient of NaCl (0–300 mm) in TM buffer. Fractions of 10 ml were collected, and 10 μl of each fraction was tested for enzyme activity by the formation of a yellow color in microtiter wells containing 100 μl of the standard pNPαGlc6P reaction mixture. Fractions 22–27 (inclusive) were pooled and concentrated to 25 ml by pressure filtration (Amicon PM-10 membrane, 35 psi). Ammonium sulfate was then added slowly, and with gentle stirring, to a final concentration of 0.75m. The solution from step 2 was transferred (0.4 ml/min) to a 2.6 × 16-cm column of phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B equilibrated with TM buffer containing 0.75 m(NH4)2SO4. The column was washed with equilibration buffer to remove material that did not bind, and then 600 ml of a decreasing, linear gradient of (NH4)2SO4 (300–0 mm) in TM buffer was passed through the column. Fractions of 10 ml were collected, and enzyme was recovered in a broad protein peak comprising fractions 25–45. These fractions were pooled and concentrated to 7.5 ml. Approximately 2.5 ml of the preparation from step 3 was applied at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min to a column (1.6 × 94 cm) of Ultrogel AcA-44 previously equilibrated with TM buffer containing 0.1 m NaCI. Fractions of 2.15 ml were collected, and maximum levels of enzyme activity were found in fractions 49–53, inclusive. These fractions were concentrated to 2 ml, and aliquots were either frozen directly in dry ice or glycerol was added to a final concentration of 10% prior to storage of the enzyme at −20 °C. The chromogenic analog pNPαGlc6P was used as substrate in the discontinuous assay for 6-phospho-α-glucosidase activity. The 2-ml reaction mixture (at 37 °C) contained, when required, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 1 mm pNPαGlc6P, 0.5 mm MnS04, and 0.1 mm NAD(H). After addition of the enzyme preparation, samples of 0.25 ml were removed at intervals of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 min and immediately injected into 0.75 ml of 0.5 mNa2CO3 solution. TheA 400 nm of the yellow solution was measured, and the amount of pNP was calculated by assuming a molar extinction coefficient for the p-nitrophenoxide anion ε = 18,300m−1 cm−1. One unit of 6-phospho-α-glucosidase activity is the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of pNP per min at 37 °C. Native gel electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE were carried out in the Novex XCell Mini-Cell system according to manufacturer's instructions. Electrophoresis of proteins under nonreducing (native) conditions was performed in Tris-glycine (4–20%) gels, from Novex, with Tris-glycine (pH 8.3) running buffer. For SDS-PAGE experiments, Novex NuPage (4–12%) Bis-Tris gels and MES-SDS running buffer (pH 7.3) were used together with Novex Mark 12 wide range or Bio-Rad low range molecular weight protein standards. In Western blots, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using NuPage transfer buffer (pH 7.2) and SeeBlue prestained standards. Immunodetection of 6-phospho-α-glucosidase with polyclonal antibody to maltose 6-phosphate hydrolase was as described previously (35Thompson J. Gentry-Weeks C.R. Nguyen N.Y. Folk J.E. Robrish S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2505-2512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of glucose and Glc6P were determined enzymatically in an NADP+-coupled assay that contained (in 1 ml) 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7) buffer, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm NADP+, and 2 units each of Glc6P dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) and hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1). Formation of NADPH was followed in a Beckman DU 70 recording spectrophotometer, and a molar extinction coefficient ε = 6,220 m−1cm−1 was assumed for calculation of NADPH produced (i.e., equivalent to glucose or Glc6P formed). The Pharmacia Biotech Multiphor flat-bed electrophoresis unit and precast Ampholine PAG plates (pH range 3.5–9.5) were used for electrofocusing experiments as described previously (40Thompson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9592-9601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were routinely determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Chromatographic procedures are described in a previous report (35Thompson J. Gentry-Weeks C.R. Nguyen N.Y. Folk J.E. Robrish S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2505-2512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of 6-phospho-α-glucosidase was determined by automated Edman degradation in a 494A Procise sequenator (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) using pulse liquid chemistry. PTH derivatives were identified by on-line high pressure liquid chromatography. The mass of purified 6-phospho-α-glucosidase was determined by electrospray in an HP1100 mass spectrometer. The enzyme sample was dissolved in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, injected onto a Zorbax 300SB-C3 narrow bore (2.1 × 150 mm) high pressure liquid chromatography column, and eluted with a gradient of 5% acetic acid to 100% acetonitrile. A mass range from m/z 700 to 2000 was scanned every 4 s, and the protein mass (50,510) was obtained by deconvolution from the only peak that eluted from the column. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were conducted at 20 °C in a Beckman Optima model XL-I instrument equipped with a four-place An-Ti rotor. Specific absorption coefficients were determined by a combination of absorbance and interference optics. Absorbance readings on protein samples were measured in a Perkin Elmer model 320 double-beam spectrophotometer at 20 °C. Protein concentrations (mg/ml) were determined on the same solutions using the analytical ultracentrifuge in an interference mode as a differential refractometer (41Maurizi M.R. Pinkofsky H.B. McFarland P.J. Ginsburg A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 246: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and an experimentally determined value of 3.191 ± 0.005 fringes (mg/ml)−1 for the same instrument. 2M. Zolkiewski and A. Ginsburg, unpublished data. A 12-mm cell housing equipped with a double-sector capillary synthetic boundary centerpiece and sapphire windows was used with initial volumes of 130 μl of protein solution and 410 μl of dialysate buffer. After temperature equilibration at 20.0 °C at 3000 rpm, the rotor speed was increased to 10,000 rpm to initiate boundary formation and to 20,000 rpm (in 2000-rpm steps) until protein and solvent-side menisci were matched (total time ∼10 min) and then decelerated to 3000 rpm; 10 interference scans were then recorded at 2-min intervals (42Nosworthy N.J. Peterkofsky A. Konig S. Seok Y.-J. Szczepanowski R.H. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6718-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For 10 scans, the difference between the fringes in the plateau and solvent sides of the boundary (100 data points in both radial positions) was constant and within 0.1% accuracy during the period of data collection. The specific absorption coefficient for 6-phospho-α-glucosidase was determined to beA 280 nm1 cm = 1.25 ± 0.01 ml/mg (average of three independent measurements). This value is similar to that calculated from the amino acid composition of the protein (1.20 ml/mg). Sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted using charcoal-filled double-sector Epon 12-mm centerpieces. Enzyme solution (A 280 nm ∼1.0) was loaded on the right (330 μl per channel) with the reference buffer on the left (340 μl per channel). After thermal equilibration at 3000 rpm, the rotor was accelerated to 40,000 rpm, and radial scans were collected at 280 nm (0.003-cm step size, 4-min intervals) with triple averaging in a continuous scan mode. For sedimentation equilibrium experiments, a 12-mm cell equipped with a carbon-filled 6-channel centerpiece and plane quartz windows was used. Enzyme solutions (A 280 nm from 0.17 to 0.35) were loaded on the right (100 μl per channel) with the reference buffer on the left (110 μl per channel). Radial scans at 10,000 rpm with 13 averages were made at 280 nm in 0.001-cm steps (step mode) after 18 and 20 h (equilibrium was reached by 16 h). Analysis of ultracentrifugation data was performed as described previously (43Maurizi M.R. Singh S.K. Thompson M.W. Kessel M. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7778-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) with software from Beckman, Inc. and A. P. Minton (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health). The densities of dialysate buffers (20.0 °C) were determined using an Anton Paar model DMA 58 densitometer. The partial specific volume for the protein (υ = 0.720 ml/g) was calculated from the amino acid composition (44Zamyatnin A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1984; 13: 145-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the gene glvA (previously called glv-1 (34Yamamoto H. Uchiyama S. Fajar A.N. Ogasawara N. Sekiguchi J. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1417-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)) is presented in Fig. 1. The 1347-base pair open reading frame begins with an ATG initiation codon at nucleotide position 15 and terminates with a TAA stop codon at position 1362. A putative ribosome binding site AAGGAGGT precedes the start codon. Translation of the codon sequence of glvA predicts a polypeptide of 449 residues of calculated M r = 50,513 and theoretical pI = 4.77. The 48.1 mol% (G+C) base composition of glv"

The changing of lactate and glucose concentration in the extracellular medium of C6 glioma cells incubated with 5.5 mm glucose and 11 mm lactate indicated a net production of lactate as the consequence of an active aerobic glycolysis. The 13C enrichments of various metabolites were determined after 4-h cell incubation in media containing both substrates, each of them being alternatively labeled in the form of either [3-13C]l-lactate or [1-13C]d-glucose. Using 11 mm[3-13C]l-lactate, the enrichment of glutamate C4, 69%, was found higher than that of alanine C3, 32%, when that of acetyl-CoA C2 was 78%. These results indicated that exogenous lactate was the major substrate for the oxidative metabolism of the cells. Nevertheless, an active glycolysis occurred, leading to a net lactate production. This lactate was, however, metabolically different from the exogenous lactate as both lactate species did not mix into a unique compartment. The results were actually consistent with the concept of the existence of two pools of both lactate and pyruvate, wherein one pool was closely connected with exogenous lactate and was the main fuel for the oxidative metabolism, and the other pool was closely related to aerobic glycolysis. 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy was used to investigate the metabolism ofl-lactate and d-glucose in C6 glioma cells.

Neoplastic cells preferentially utilize aerobic glycolysis for their energy needs rather than oxidative phosphorylations, that leads to an important lactate production (1Warburg O. Science. 1956; 123: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9331) Google Scholar). The reason for this behavior is not yet clearly understood. It has been proposed recently that it would be a means to minimize oxidative stress, in particular during the cell phases linked to biosynthesis and cell division (2Brand K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). With regard to a tumor, aerobic glycolysis may increase lactate concentration inside the tumor itself and in its close vicinity (3Argiles J.M. Azcon-Bieto J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 81: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Vaupel P. NMR Biomed. 1992; 5: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Consequently, local changes in metabolic activities could be generated as an increased local lactate concentration provides a possible source for cell energy requirements in competition with glucose or other substrates. There is no data concerning the competition between lactate and glucose as fuel for the oxidative metabolism in glioma cells. It has been only reported that, in vitro, glioma cells utilize glucose, but that once it is depleted, they will take up pyruvate and lactate generated by aerobic glycolysis for further metabolism (5Schwartz J.P. Lust W.D. Lauderdale V.R. Passonneau J.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1975; 9: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).To study the possible competition between glucose and lactate metabolism in glioma cells, we investigated the fate of each of these substrates when both were present in cell medium by using either [3-13C]l-lactate or [1-13C]d-glucose. We used the C6 glioma cell clone for which the metabolism of [1-13C]glucose has been investigated already (6Portais J.C. Schuster R. Merle M. Canioni P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 7Portais J.C. Voisin P. Merle M. Canioni P. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The initial glucose concentration (5.5 mm) was chosen higher than the apparentK m for transport (1.7 mm) (8Lust W.D. Schwartz J.P. Passonneau J.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1975; 8: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), whereas the different lactate concentrations used (11, 5.5, and 1.1 mm) were higher or in the same range than the apparentK m for transport (1 mm) (9Dringen R. Peters H. Wiesinger H. Hamprecht B. Dev. Neurosci. 1995; 17: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The13C enrichment of extra and intracellular lactate and that of various intracellular metabolites was analyzed after a 4 h cell incubation. The results evidence that when lactate concentration was higher than K m, cells preferentially utilize lactate as carbon source for oxidative phosphorylations notwithstanding a high rate of glycolysis. Metabolite enrichments forced the consideration of different intracellular pools for both lactate and pyruvate.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESl-Lactate (sodium salt) was from Sigma. [3-13C]l-Lactate (sodium salt) (99% enrichment) was from Eurisotop. [1-13C]d-Glucose (99% enrichment) was from the Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (Saclay, France).Cell Incubation with Glucose and LactateC6 cells were cultured in 10-cm diameter dishes (6Portais J.C. Schuster R. Merle M. Canioni P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). At the end of the growth period, confluent cells taken at least 24 h after the last medium change were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)1 and then incubated in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) free of glutamine and pyruvate, but containing 5.5 mmd-glucose and/or 11 mml-lactate. To determine glucose consumption and lactate production (or consumption), 200 μl of medium were sequentially removed after different incubation times. At the end of the incubation (24 h), cells were rinsed twice with PBS. After addition of 5 ml/dish of 0.9 m perchloric acid, the insoluble part of the cellular layer was removed and pelleted by centrifugation. Similar experiments were performed with C6 cells incubated in the presence of 5.5 mm[1-13C]glucose and 11 mml-lactate. At the indicated time, 200 μl of medium were removed for glucose and lactate determinations. The remaining medium in each dish was conditioned for 1H NMR analysis (see below).For cell incubation with [1-13C]d-glucose or [3-13C]l-lactate, approximately 3 × 108 cells (10–15 culture dishes) were used for each experiment. After 4-h incubation, 4-ml aliquots of the medium were removed and subsequently freeze-dried. Cells were then rinsed twice with PBS and their metabolites extracted with 0.9 mperchloric acid (10Pianet I. Merle M. Labouesse J. Canioni P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Sample Preparation for NMR AnalysesTo facilitate the analysis of the lactate methyl signal in the 1H NMR spectra of incubation media and cell extracts, the amino acids contained in the samples were eliminated by fixation on a Dowex 50W-X8 column, and glutamate in cell extracts was further purified (11Merle M. Martin M. Villégier A. Canioni P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 742-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).A solution of Ala and Glu in D2O (around 100 mmfor each amino acid) was prepared and used as standard solution for both the quantitative analysis of 13C NMR spectra and the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) determination of amino acids in cell extracts.NMR SpectroscopySpectra were obtained with a Bruker DPX400 wide-bore spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm broad-band probe.1H NMR spectra were acquired with 3-μs pulses (41° flip angle), 1-s acquisition time, 6-s relaxation delay, 2.4-kHz sweep width, and 32K memory size. Residual water signal was suppressed by homonuclear presaturation. 13C NMR spectra were acquired at 100.6 MHz. Measurements were conducted at 25 °C under bilevel broad-band gated proton decoupling and D2O lock, using 11.5-μs pulses (59° flip angle), 21.7-kHz sweep width, and 64K memory size. Two relaxation delays, 0.1 and 10 s, were used to check the effect of different acquisition conditions on the quantitative analysis of carbon enrichments.Determination of Metabolite 13C EnrichmentsThe specific 13C enrichments (SE) of Glu C2 and lactate C3 were determined from satellite peak areas resulting from1H-13C spin-coupling on 1H NMR spectra (12Martin M. Portais J.C. Labouesse J. Canioni P. Merle M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).The ratio (E4/A3) between SE Glu C4 and SE Ala C3 was determined from both peak areas on the 13C NMR spectra and the HPLC determinations of the amino acid contents in cell perchloric acid extracts and in the amino acid standard solution according to Equation 1. This procedure wherein both samples were analyzed by both methods was chosen to enhance the guarantee of the determination by eliminating the risk of bias linked to the use of a standard solution containing not rigorously adjusted Ala and Glu concentrations.E4/A3=SE Glu C4SE Ala C3=(A Glu C4)e(A Ala C3)e×(A Ala C3)s(A Glu C4)s×[Ala]e[Glu]e×[Glu]s[Ala]s(Eq. 1) In this equation, (A Glu C4)e and (A Ala C3)e correspond to peak areas on the 13C NMR spectrum of cell extract, (A Glu C4)s and (A Ala C3)s correspond to peak areas on the spectrum of the amino acid standard solution, [Ala]e and [Glu]ecorrespond to Ala and Glu contents in cell extract, and [Glu]s and [Ala]s correspond to the amino acid contents in the standard solution.The criterion for the relative contributions of lactate and glucose to Glu and Ala syntheses (IL/G) was defined as follows, IL/G=(SE Glu C4)L/(SE Ala C3)L/(SE Glu C4)G/(SE Ala C3)G(Eq. 2) where L or G indicates the incubation with either [3-13C]lactate or [1-13C]glucose as labeled substrate, respectively.The specific enrichment of acetyl-CoA (Ace-CoA) C2 was determined according to the method based on the analysis of the homonuclear spin-coupling pattern of glutamate carbons in the 13C NMR spectrum (13Malloy C.R. Thompson J. Jeffrey F. Sherry A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6756-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) as follows.

Proteins dissolved in a mixture of 0.5 m Tris base, 2% SDS were determined using bovine serum albumin as standard (14Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of amino acids (particularly Glu and Ala) in cell perchloric acid extracts and in the standard solution used for the quantitative analysis of NMR spectra were determined by HPLC (15Henrikson R.L. Meredith S.L. Dev. Neurosci. 1984; 1: 226-237Google Scholar). In each case, an internal standard of norleucine (10 nmol) was added to the sample to overcome any bias in the determination.Flow CytometryThe homogeneity of the cell culture was investigated by flow cytometry using a Coulter Elite flow cytometer equipped with a 2025 Spectra Physics argon laser. Viable cells were determined using propidium iodide (16St. John P.A. Kell W.M. Mazzetta J.S. Lange G.D. Barker J.L. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 1492-1512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pH of cell cytoplasm was determined using 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)carboxyfluorescein acetomethyl ester (BCECF-AM) (17Musgrove E. Rugg C. Hedley D. Cytometry. 1986; 7: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in DMEM (107 cells/ml) and incubated 30 min at 37 °C with 10 μm BCECF-AM. A 100-μl volume of the cell suspension was then mixed with 900 μl of DMEM containing 5.5 mm glucose and 11 mm lactate before flow cytometry measurement. The standard curve for pH determination was drawn from measurements performed after dilution of 100 μl of the cell suspension in 900 μl of phosphate-buffered saline at different pH values (obtained by mixing in various proportions 135 mmKH2PO4 + 20 mm NaCl with 110 mm K2HPO4 + 20 mm NaCl) and 10-min incubation with 6 μm nigericin. Mitochondrial membrane potential was investigated with 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodine (DiOC6(3)) (18Liu Z. Bushnell W.R. Brambl R. Plant Physiol. 1987; 84: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The suspension of cells in DMEM containing 5.5 mmglucose and 11 mm lactate (106 cells/ml) was incubated 10 min at 37 °C with 0.1 μmDiOC6(3) before measurement.Checking of the Relevance of the Proposed Model of Glucose and Lactate Metabolism CompartmentationA model of lactate and glucose metabolic compartmentation was proposed (Fig. 5). It involved the fractional amounts of Glu or Ala synthesized from lactate (Lac), glucose, and other carbon sources: Glu1, Glu2, and Glu3 or Ala1, Ala2, and Ala3, respectively. According to the model, Glu C4 and Ala C3 enrichments would be as follows, (SE Glu C4)L=(SE Lac C3)×Glu1+1.1×(Glu2+Glu3)(Eq. 4) (SE Ala C3)L=(SE Lac C3)×Ala1+1.1×(Ala2+Ala3)(Eq. 5) with [3-13C]lactate as labeled substrate. In these expressions, SE Lac C3 was the mean medium lactate enrichment between 0- and 4-h incubation, starting from either 11 or 5.5 mm[3-13C]lactate, respectively, and 1.1 corresponded to the percent 13C natural abundance,(SE Glu C4)G=(SE Lac C3)×Glu1+(SE Pyr C3)×Glu2+1.1×Glu3(Eq. 6) (SE Ala C3)G=(SE Lac C3)×Ala1+(SE Pyr C3)×Ala2+1.1×Ala3(Eq. 7) with [1-13C]glucose as initial labeled substrate. In these expressions, SE Lac C3 was the mean medium lactate enrichment between 0- and 4-h incubation, starting from either 11 or 5.5 mm lactate and 5.5 mm[1-13C]glucose, and the specific enrichment of glycolytic pyruvate (Pyr) was evaluated from the yield of glucose C1 decarboxylation.These expressions were used to check if there was a set of Gluiand Alai (i = 1–3) values able to agree with the experimental data. The data used in the iterative procedure (11Merle M. Martin M. Villégier A. Canioni P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 742-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were the ratios E4/A3 = (SE Glu C4)L/(SE Ala C3)L or (SE Glu C4)G/(SE Ala C3)Gdetermined for the experiments carried out at 11 or 5.5 mmlactate using either [3-13C]lactate or [1-13C]glucose as labeled substrate, respectively, (values reported in Table I), the ratios (SE Glu C4)L/(SE Glu C4)G and (SE Ala C3)L/(SE Ala C3)G determined from the 13C NMR spectra (Fig. 2) and the enrichment of Glu C4 obtained after 4 h cell incubation with 5.5 mm glucose and 11 mm[3-13C]lactate. The procedure was not applied to experiments carried out at 1.1 mm lactate because this concentration was not saturating (9Dringen R. Peters H. Wiesinger H. Hamprecht B. Dev.

Open table in a new tab Figure 213 C NMR spectra of perchloric acid extracts of cells incubated for 4 h in the presence of glucose and lactate, each of the two substrates being alternately labeled in the form [1-13C]glucose or [3-13C]lactate. Cells were incubated in medium containing 5.5 mm glucose and either 11 mm(spectra A and B), 5.5 mm(spectra C and D), or 1.1 mm(spectra E and F) lactate, respectively. Each couple of spectra (A and B, C and D, and E and F) corresponds to the incubations with [3-13C]lactate (13C-Lac) or [1-13C]glucose (13C-Glc), respectively. Each spectrum was obtained after zero filling to 64K, 1-Hz line-broadening, and Fourier transformation on the free induction decay corresponding to at least an overnight acquisition using 0.1-s relaxation delay. Spectra were plotted such as the signal intensity of 13C natural abundance of inositol carbons used as an internal reference was of the same range, thus making it possible to visualize the relative enrichment of metabolites depending on the labeled substrate. Peak assignments were: 1, alanine C3 (17.6 ppm); 2, lactate C3 (21.7 ppm); 3 γ-Glu, glutathione C3 (27.1 ppm);4, glutamate C3 (27.7 ppm); 5, γ-Glu, glutathione C4 (32.1 ppm); 6, glutamate C4 (34.1 ppm);7, inositol (C4-C6, C2, C1-C3, and C5 at 71.5, 72.7, 73.0, and 74.8 ppm, respectively). For spectra A and B, the ratio between homologous peak areas was 12.3 for Glu C4 and 9.2 for Ala C3, respectively; for spectra C and D, the ratio was 6.8 and 4.5, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)StatisticsThe results are expressed as means ± S.D.; when indicated, the statistical significance of value differences was assessed by Student's t test.DISCUSSIONIn a previous work it has been shown that incubating C6 cells for 4 h with 5.5 mm [1-13C]glucose led to the following specific enrichments: 36.7% for lactate and Ala C3, 27.3% for Ace-CoA C2, and 22.5% for Glu C4, in agreement with a monocompartmental model of cell carbon metabolism (6Portais J.C. Schuster R. Merle M. Canioni P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). According to its network, the decrease in enrichment from glucose C1 to Glu C4 was the consequence of both the hexose monophosphate shunt activity and several isotopic dilutions occurring at different branch points (pyruvate, Ace-CoA, and 2-oxoglutarate) due to carbon entry from endogenous and exogenous unlabeled sources. In the reported study, E4/A3 was thus less than 1. In contrast, the present study evidenced that when C6 cells were incubated with 5.5 mm glucose and 11 or 5.5 mm [3-13C]lactate, E4/A3 was higher than 1 (Table I). This result was concomitant with a higher enrichment of Ace-CoA C2 than lactate C3 at 11 mm[3-13C]lactate and to similar enrichments at 5.5 mm. These results were unexpected, because [3-13C]lactate was the precursor of [3-13C]pyruvate and thereafter [2-13C]Ace-CoA, keeping in mind the occurrence of isotopic dilutions at the pyruvate and Ace-CoA nodes. Obviously, such an enrichment pattern could not fit with a metabolic network wherein Ace-CoA derived from a unique pool of pyruvate at equilibrium with alanine and lactate through alanine aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase activity, respectively. Data analysis needed therefore to reconsider the route of metabolite enrichment upstream from Ace-CoA. Downstream, the isotopic dilution (from Ace-CoA C2 to Glu C4) was very similar under the two incubation conditions (from 77.5 to 69.5% in the present study using 11 mm [3-13C]lactate and from 27.3 to 22.5% in Ref. 6Portais J.C. Schuster R. Merle M. Canioni P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Before proposing an explanation to the experimental data, it was critical to emphasize their reliability. First, from spectrum B in Fig. 2, it appears that using 5.5 mm[1-13C]glucose and 11 mm lactate, metabolite enrichment was very poor. This suggested that despite the high rate of cell glucose consumption, the contribution of this compound as Ace-CoA precursor was very low. It could be proposed that the label was lost through the decarboxylation step of the hexose monophosphate shunt. This proposal did not, however, agree with the data in Fig. 1, which indicated that almost all of the label was recovered as [3-13C]lactate. Moreover, the decarboxylation yield can be estimated from the enrichments of lactate C3 in cell media. Indeed, considering the enrichments obtained after 4-h incubation with 5.5 mm glucose and 11 mm lactate, 90 and 4.9% using either lactate or glucose as labeled substrate (Table I), if L0 was the fraction of initial lactate remaining after 4 h and Lg the fraction of lactate formed from glycolysis, lactate enrichment (%) was expressed by 90 = 99 × L0 + 1.1 × Lg when starting from [3-13C]lactate (99 and 1.1% being the initial enrichment and the natural 13C abundance, respectively). As L0 + Lg = 1, it came L0 = 0.91. Then it was possible to express lactate enrichment when starting from labeled [1-13C]glucose: 4.9 = 1.1 × L0 + 1.1 × Lg/2 + A × Lg/2, where A represents the enrichment of the carbon corresponding to glucose C1 (it would be equal to 99 without decarboxylation). The value found was A = 83, indicating only 17% of decarboxylation, which could not explain the poor label incorporation into cell metabolites. The same calculation led to 26, 28.5, and 20.5% decarboxylation when using 5.5 and 1.1 mmlactate and for the experiment, including 3-h preincubation, respectively.Second, during 4-h cell incubation with 5.5 mm glucose and 11 mm lactate, medium glucose decrease and lactate increase were near-linear, indicating that substrate consumption was close to steady state. It has been shown previously that 4-h cell incubation in a medium containing [1-13C]glucose (but no initial lactate) was sufficient to ensure isotopic steady state, particularly for Glu and Ala (6Portais J.C. Schuster R. Merle M. Canioni P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 7Portais J.C. Voisin P. Merle M. Canioni P. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present study, an isotopic steady-state,stricto sensu, could not occur after only 4 h because medium lactate enrichment was time-decreasing (or increasing) due to the release of unlabeled (or labeled) lactate generated from unlabeled (or labeled) glucose. The demonstration of the existence of different pyruvate and lactate pools (as discussed below) was indeed dependent on this condition. From a theoretical point of view, isotopic steady state could only be expected after total glucose consumption, i.e.after 30–40-h incubation. Nevertheless, starting from 11 mm [3-13C]lactate, the decrease in medium lactate enrichment after 4 h was rather moderate (from 99 to 90%), making it possible to consider that the changes in metabolite enrichment were very slow at this time. The value of IL/G, the criterion for the relative contributions of lactate and glucose to Glu and Ala syntheses, appeared dependent on lactate concentration. It was higher than 1 only at 11 and 5.5 mm lactate (Table I). This indicated primarily that the relative contributions of lactate and glucose to cell metabolism could be only investigated if their enrichments remained very different. This was obviously not the case using 1.1 mm lactate as the exogenous lactate was strongly diluted by glycolytic lactate (27% enrichment after 4 h). The isotopic dilution effects were also apparent when comparing the enrichments obtained at 11 and 5.5 mm lactate (Table I). In particular, Ace-CoA C2 and lactate C3 enrichments were closer at 5.5 mm lactate. As a consequence, data interpretation was focused on the results obtained at 11 mm lactate.From the Glu C4 enrichment (69.5%) and the ratio E4/A3 (2.15, Table I), it follows that Ala C3 enrichment was around 32% when using [3-13C]lactate. Therefore, the fact that the enrichment of Ace-CoA C2 was higher than both that of Ala C3 and intracellular lactate C3 dictated to consider at least two pools of pyruvate. Moreover, the pool corresponding to the Ace-CoA precursor had to display an enrichment of at least 77.5% and thus to derive from an intracellular pool of lactate at least at the same enrichment. As intracellular lactate enrichment was measured to be less (59%), this implied also the existence of two intracellular lactate pools. This situation led to consider that the exogenous lactate was the main mitochondrial substrate (via pyruvate). Therefore, the metabolic pathway including the different steps on the conversion of extracellular lactate into mitochondrial Ace-CoA had to be compartmentalized toward glycolysis. This phenomenological compartmentation is depicted in Fig. 5, wherein compartments 1 and 2 correspond to lactate and glucose metabolism, respectively. However, the fact that E4/A3 remained close to 1 (Table I) when using [1-13C]glucose also needed to be explained. Indeed, if lactate and glucose were the sole carbon sources for Glu and Ala syntheses, the expected value for E4/A3 would be less than 1 when using [1-13C]glucose. The means to explain why the value remained close to 1 was to consider the contribution of unenriched endogenous and exogenous carbon sources to amino acid syntheses. This led to include a third compartment in Fig. 5containing Glu and Ala pools not originating from glucose or lactate metabolism. It was thus interesting to test the relevance of the model by estimating Glu1, Glu2, and Glu3or Ala1, Ala2, and Ala3, the fractional amounts of Glu or Ala synthesized from lactate, glucose, and the other sources, respectively. The procedure involved Equations (Eq. 4), (Eq. 5), (Eq. 6)(see “Experimental Procedures”). In Equation 4 (or 5), lactate C3 enrichment was 95% (or 85%), corresponding to the mean medium lactate enrichment between 0 and 4 h, starting from 11 (or 5.5) mm [3-13C]lactate, respectively. In Equation 6 (or 7), glycolytic pyruvate C3 enrichment was 42.5% (or 37.7%), corresponding to 17% (or 26%) glucose C1 decarboxylation (as discussed above), and the mean enrichment of medium lactate C3 was 3% (or 6.3%), starting from 11 (or 5.5) mm lactate, respectively. The best set of parameter values was: Glu1 = 0.72, Glu2 = 0.09, Glu3 = 0.19, Ala1 = 0.42, Ala2 = 0.10, and Ala3= 0.48. These parameters were determined with a mean relative error of 13.5 ± 5.8% for the variables used in the iterative procedure, indicating a rather good fitting.Instead of intracellular compartmentation of lactate and glucose metabolism, it could be proposed that the different metabolite labeling pattern as a function of the labeled substrate was the consequence of the presence of a mixed population of cells, one that was primarily oxidative in nature and principally oxidizing lactate and some glucose, with no net lactate production from glucose, and the other glycolytic and thus producing lactate, with no oxidation of lactate,i.e. intercellular compartmentation. Such markedly different metabolic behavior could not be the consequence of a lack in oxygen supply to the glycolytic cells, because all cells were incubated in the same conditions, but rather by impairment of their mitochondria. Therefore, a difference in membrane potential between functional and impaired mitochondria would be expected. F"

These temporary elevations of cytosolic Ca2+ are believed to participate in signal propagation, resulting in activation/inhibition of such downstream effectors as protein kinases, ion channels, phospholipases, oxidases, hydrolases, and/or calmodulin-dependent enzymes (27Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar). As anticipated, blockade of the above-stimulated Ca2+ influxes either inhibits or retards most, if not all, of the associated pathways. It can be hypothesized that plant cells maintain high Ca2+concentrations both in their extracellular milieus and in certain intracellular compartments to enable rapid gating of the cation into the low Ca2+ environment of the cytosol (23Leckie C.P.

Indeed, cytosolic Ca2+ transients in hormone/cytokine-treated animal cells have been shown to derive from both internal and external Ca2+ stores (27Clapham D.E.

Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1993; 102: 1139-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), both Ca2+ pools should be considered as possible sources for mediating plant signaling events. We and others have observed that elicitation of the oxidative burst in cultured plant cells generally accompanies and requires a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ (7Pugin A. Frachisse J. Tavernier E. Bligny R. Gout E. Douce R. Guern J. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 2077-2091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Chandra S. Low P.S. J. Biol.

(Rockv.). 1990; 92: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, it has not been established if the induction of the oxidative burst requires Ca2+ influx from internal or external Ca2+stores or from both in succession or simultaneously. In the case of the mechanically or osmotically stimulated oxidative burst, the cytoplasmic Ca2+ increase is distinctly biphasic. Thus, using aequorin-transformed tobacco cells to quantitate Ca2+influx into the cytoplasm of the cell (3Knight M.R. Campbell A.K. Smith S.M. Trewavas A.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), Ca2+ peaks have been repeatedly observed ∼15 s and 1.5 min after hypotonic stress (8Chandra S. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28274-28280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,39Takahashi K. Isobe M.N. Knight M.R. Trewavas A.J. Muto S. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1997; 113: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, other groups have established that both Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane and Ca2+release from internal stores may play roles in plant cell volume/turgor regulation (14Ward J.M. Pei Z. Schroeder J.I. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 23Leckie C.P. McAinish M.R. Montgomery L. Priestly A.J. Staxen I. Webb A.A.R. Hetherington A.M. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 339-349Crossref Google Scholar). Because this unusual pattern of Ca2+flux offers the opportunity to examine the Ca2+ signal required for both the induction of the oxidative burst and the regulation of cellular turgor pressure, we have decided to identify the Ca2+ stores responsible for both phases of the Ca2+ influx. We report here that the first Ca2+transient arises from outside the cell, whereas the second derives from intracellular stores. We further identify inhibitors that can selectively block the first, second, or both phases of Ca2+flow, and we report observations regarding possible communication between the two pathways responsible for Ca2+ influx. Ruthenium red, lanthanum chloride, gadolinium chloride, and niflumate were all purchased from Sigma/Aldrich.45Ca in the form of 45CaCl2 salt was obtained from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA), and coelenterazine was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Other chemicals used were of reagent grade or better and were obtained from major chemical suppliers. Aequorin-transformed tobacco cell (Nicotiana plumbaginifolia) suspension cultures were established from transformed seedlings and maintained as described previously (8Chandra S. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28274-28280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Two ml of packed filtered cells were transferred to 100 ml of fresh W-38 liquid medium (40Murashige T. Skoog F. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (53968) Google Scholar) every 7 days and maintained in suspension by continuous shaking. Cells to be used ∼12 h later for Ca2+measurements were transferred at twice their regular cell density. Functional aequorin was reconstituted from the apoenzyme by adding 5 μl of coelenterazine dissolved in ethanol (1 μm final) to 3 ml of suspension-cultured cells at the time of transfer. Functional aequorin capable of reproducible Ca2+measurements was found to develop 5 to 15 h after transfer of the cells to fresh medium and the addition of coelenterazine. Luminescence measurements were carried out in a digital luminometer (LKB Wallac model 1250, Gaithersburg, MD), as described previously (8Chandra S. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28274-28280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 ml of coelenterazine-treated cells were transferred to the luminometer cuvette and held in suspension by mild stirring during stimulation. Luminescence data was collected 10 times/s. All inhibitors, chelators, and control solvents were added at the times indicated in the figure legends. Plant cells were hypo-osmotically shocked by diluting the suspensions 1:1 with distilled water at the times indicated in the figures. At the end of each experiment, all remaining aequorin was discharged by the addition of 0.5 mm CaCl2 in 10% Nonidet P-40, and luminescence was continually quantitated until recordings returned to basal levels and further addition of CaCl2/detergent solution elicited no further response. Luminescence data were then converted by computer directly to intracellular Ca2+concentration using the equation described by Allen et al. (41Allen D.G. Blinks J.R. Prendergast F.G. Science. 1976; 195: 996-998Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar), [Ca2+] = ((L/L max)1/3 + [118(L/L max)1/3] − 1)/(7 × 106 − [7 × 106(L/L max)1/3]), where L is the luminescence intensity at any time point, and L max is the integrated luminescence intensity from that point to the end of the luminescence recording. As above, 3 ml of suspension-cultured tobacco cells transferred at twice the density of continuously cultured cells were used for determination of45Ca influx as described by Atkinson et al.(10Atkinson M.M. Keppler L.D. Orlandi E.W. Baker C.J. Mischke L.F. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1990; 92: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.1 μCi of 45Ca was added to 3 ml of cells just before hypo- or iso-osmotic treatment. Inhibitors were added at the times indicated in the figure legends. 45Ca-treated cells were then incubated with gentle shaking for 7 min before suction filtration through Whatman filter paper at 20 mm of Hg and immediate rinsing with 3 ml of normo-osmotic buffer containing 10 mmCaCl2, 5 mmMES,1 and 160 mmsucrose (pH 5.6) to displace any externally bound 45Ca. Filtered and rinsed cells were then resuspended in 3 ml of rinse buffer and shaken for 20 min before suction filtering and rinsing again with 3 ml of rinse buffer. Finally, the cells were scraped into pre-weighed scintillation vials containing 3 ml of ICN Ecolite scintillation liquid. After counting the radioactivity in a Packard 1600CA liquid scintillation analyzer (Meriden, CT) and weighing the vials, the radioactivity/mg of filtered cells was calculated. Data are presented as detailed in the figure legend. It was conceivable that the previously observed hypo-osmotic shock generated Ca2+ transients (8Chandra S. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28274-28280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 39Takahashi K. Isobe M.N. Knight M.R. Trewavas A.J. Muto S. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1997; 113: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) were not due to regulated ion channels but rather to a membrane disturbance resulting in nonspecific Ca2+ leaks. To evaluate this possibility, we tested the effectiveness of several broad-spectrum Ca2+ channel inhibitors on the induced cytosolic Ca2+ fluxes. Ruthenium red and the trivalent lanthanides gadolinium and lanthanum are known to block many types of Ca2+ channels in both plasma and sarcoendoplasmic reticular membranes of animal cells (42Ma J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 1031-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 43Peeters G.A. Kohmoto O. Barry W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C351-C357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Zha X. Morrison G.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C923-C928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and all three have also been used for characterization of Ca2+ channels and Ca2+-dependent processes in plant cells (5Sedbrook J.C. Kronebusch P.J. Borisy G.G. Trewavas A.J. Masson P.H. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,8Chandra S. Low P.S. J. Biol.

Planta. 1997; 203: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 1, each of these inhibitors is effective at blocking both phases of Ca2+ flow into hypo-osmotically stimulated tobacco cells. Inhibition of Ca2+ influx by ruthenium red at 50 μm (Fig. 1 A) is consistent with the pharmacologic data of both Allen et al. (30Allen G.J. Muir S.R. Sanders D. Science. 1995; 268: 735-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and Pineros and Tester (34Pineros M. Tester M. J. Exp. Bot. 1997; 48: 551-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who observed blockade of cyclic-ADP-ribose-activated tonoplast Ca2+ channels and voltage-gated plasma membrane Ca2+ channels, respectively, at similar concentrations. Although this effect of ruthenium red has been previously published (8Chandra S. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28274-28280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we present these data here to allow direct comparisons of the inhibitory effects of Ca2+channel blockers on these Ca2+ fluxes. Lanthanum and gadolinium ions, which required a 10-min equilibration to achieve maximal channel inhibition, also displayed concentration dependences similar to those observed by others (5Sedbrook J.C. Kronebusch P.J. Borisy G.G. Trewavas A.J. Masson P.H. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 9Zimmermann S. Nurnberger T. Frachisse J.-M. Wirtz W. Guern J.

Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). At 10 mmconcentration, both lanthanides inhibited greater than 80% total Ca2+ influx, whereas at 1 mm they primarily suppressed influx during the first Ca2+ peak (Figs. 1,B and C). Inhibition by these agents provides little information regarding the location of channels responsible for the cytosolic Ca2+transients. Externally provided ruthenium red has been shown to inhibit plasma membrane Ca2+ channels (34Pineros M. Tester M. J. Exp. Bot. 1997; 48: 551-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to enter cultured plant cells and interrupt internal Ca2+ release (4Subbaiah C.C. Bush D.S. Sachs M.M. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1747-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In addition, lanthanum ions, classically used to identify plasma membrane Ca2+ channel activities, when provided in millimolar concentrations for periods greater than 1 min have also been observed to enter cells and alter internal Ca2+ channels (43Peeters G.A. Kohmoto O. Barry W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C351-C357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Zha X. Morrison G.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C923-C928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the inhibition of Ca2+ influx by these channel blockers does demonstrate that the osmotically induced Ca2+uptake proceeds through specific Ca2+ channels and not through nonspecific ion leaks. To begin to identify the cellular sources of the two pulses of cytosolic Ca2+, we first performed manipulations that would specifically modify the flux of external Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. EGTA, a membrane-impermeable selective chelator of Ca2+ ions, was added to the extracellular medium at a concentration of 1.5 mm, approximately the concentration of free Ca2+ in the medium. As shown in Fig. 2 A, chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA exerts an inhibitory effect selectively on the first Ca2+ spike generated by hypo-osmotic shock, suggesting that this Ca2+ transient, but not the second, derives from an external source. Inhibition of the first peak was also seen using 1.5 mm1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N, N, N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) in place of EGTA, indicating that the nature of the Ca2+-chelating agent is unimportant to the inhibition (data not shown). In contrast to Ca2+ chelation, the addition of extra CaCl2 to achieve a final medium concentration approximately 2.7 and 4.3 times that normally present in the cell culture was seen to elevate the amount of Ca2+ entering during the first phase of the Ca2+ influx (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, supplementation of the growth medium with excess Mg2+, which can either compete with Ca2+as a channel substrate or antagonize Ca2+ entry as a weak channel blocker (31Ding J.P. Pickard B.G. Plant J. 1993; 3: 83-110Crossref Google Scholar, 34Pineros M. Tester M. J. Exp. Bot. 1997; 48: 551-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also reduced the magnitude of the first Ca2+ peak (Fig. 2 C). Mn+2 and Fe2+ were similarly found to inhibit the first, but not alter the second, of the two Ca2+ peaks (data not shown). Inhibition of the first phase of Ca2+ influx was also observed after replacement of the chloride with the sulfate salts of Mg2+ and Fe2+ (data not shown), indicating that this initial phase of Ca2+ entry into the cytosol is not controlled by the nature of the counter ion. Based on the selective suppression of the first Ca2+ transient by either EGTA or nonsubstrate cations and the selective enhancement of this peak by elevated extracellular Ca2+, we propose that the first peak of Ca2+ influx during osmotic shock originates from an apoplastic pool. To further confirm the above channel assignment, measurement of45Ca uptake by hypo-osmotically shocked cells was also performed. Dilution of the suspension-cultured tobacco cells with water caused an increase in the uptake of 45Ca to ∼5× the basal level measured in iso-osmotically treated cells. As expected, 10 mm La3+ was seen to largely inhibit this influx (Fig. 3), confirming that the45Ca uptake is mediated by a Ca2+ channel. More importantly, 10 mm MgCl2 was observed to reduce the uptake by ∼60%, a value not inconsistent with the data shown in Fig. 2 C. Since the added 45Ca was unequivocally apoplastic and since Mg+2 only reduces the first Ca2+ transient measured by aequorin luminescence, we conclude that this first pulse of osmotically stimulated Ca2+ entry indeed derives from extracellular Ca2+. Although the results shown in Fig. 2 also argue that the second peak of cytosolic Ca2+ must stem from opening an internal store, we set out to confirm this hypothesis with selective modulators of internal Ca2+ release. For this purpose, caffeine, a Ca2+ channel regulator believed to activate Ca2+ release from cyclic-ADP-ribose and ryanodine-sensitive stores in many eukaryotic systems (4Subbaiah C.C. Bush D.S. Sachs M.M. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1747-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 47Konishi M. Kurihara S. J. Physiol. (Lond .). 1987; 383: 269-283Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 48Brown G.R. Sayers L.G. Kirk C.J. Michell R.H. Michelangeli F. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), was added to the tobacco suspensions, and the osmotically induced Ca2+ transients were again examined. As anticipated, the addition of caffeine in the absence of any other stimulus induced substantial entry of Ca2+ into the cytosol of the tobacco cell (Fig. 4 A). Since these caffeine-activated Ca2+ transients were found to be insensitive to membrane-inpermeant Ca2+ chelators and to competition with extracellular Mn2+ or Mg2+(data not shown), we reason that this Ca2+ signal indeed derives from the caffeine-induced emptying of an intracellular Ca2+ pool. Based on its impact in animal cells, the ability of caffeine to autologously discharge certain internal Ca2+ stores should also lead to an insensitivity of the treated cells to stimuli that discharge the same stores. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of caffeine pretreatment on the subsequent ability of hypo-osmotic shock to activate the second phase of cytosolic Ca2+ release. As shown in Fig. 4 B, prior exposure to caffeine eliminates the second Ca2+ transient without affecting or perhaps even enhancing the first. This loss of sensitivity to osmotic stimulation confirms that the latter Ca2+ influx is indeed derived from caffeine-sensitive internal stores. Unfortunately, other modulators of intracellular Ca2+ release commonly used in mammalian systems such as ryanodine (20 μm), the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor Ca2+ channel modulator TMB-8 (200 μm), or the sarcoendoplasmic reticular Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (up to 100 μm) had little or no effect on either of the osmotically activated transients, suggesting that the similarity in pharmacology of internal Ca2+ channels in animals and plants may extend no further than caffeine sensitivity. Nevertheless, the fact that moderate caffeine concentrations were able to specifically inhibit expression of the second phase of Ca2+ entry suggests that this phase of influx is mechanistically distinct from the first and is likely gated through an intracellular channel. Niflumic acid, an inhibitor of anion channels in plant and animal cells, was also found to serve as a selective inhibitor of the second peak of Ca2+ entry (Fig. 4 B). Other groups have observed that anion channel blockers such as niflumate and anthracene-9-carboxylate readily inhibit various anion channel activities in plant cells (14Ward J.M. Pei Z. Schroeder J.I. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 49Schwartz A. Ilan N. Schwarz M. Scheaffer J. Assman S.M. Schroeder J.I. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1995; 109: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 50Thomine S. Guern J. Barbier-Brygoo H. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 51Grabov A.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3569-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and they have suggested that release of Ca2+ from vacuolar stores may depend on concurrent anion fluxes to depolarize the membrane (14Ward J.M. Pei Z. Schroeder J.I. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Consistent with these interpretations, anthracene-9-carboxylate was also observed to block the second phase of Ca2+ uptake at concentrations (100–500 μm) similar to those found effective in the studies mentioned above (data not shown). Importantly and in contrast to the effect of Mg2+ on 45Ca influx, the addition of 500 μm niflumate to the plant cell culture failed to inhibit 45Ca uptake upon hypo-osmotic shock (Fig. 3). Thus, since 45Ca influx only measures the externally derived portion of the biphasic Ca2+ transients and since niflumate has no effect on this 45Ca influx, we conclude that the second Ca2+ peak is generated by release of the cation from internal stores. It did not escape our attention that inhibition of the first Ca2+ transient generally resulted in enlargement of the second (Fig. 2 A). Only in the case of Mg2+ addition was this compensating increase in the trailing Ca2+ pulse not consistently observed. Conversely, enhancement of the initial phase of Ca2+ influx by supplementation of the medium with extra Ca2+ invariably reduced the amplitude of the latter (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, inhibition of the second phase of Ca2+ uptake by niflumic acid consistently enhanced the first (Fig. 4 B). Similar but somewhat reduced effects were also seen with moderate concentrations of caffeine (Fig. 4 A). Taken together, these data argue that some type of communication must occur between the two phases of osmotically stimulated Ca2+-gating and that inhibition or enhancement of one phase of influx somehow leads to a compensating Ca2+ flux during the other. It will be interesting to explore the pathways along which such communication travels. We have provided evidence that the two phases of Ca2+entry into the cytoplasm of osmotically shocked tobacco cells sequentially involve (i) the influx of extracellular Ca2+ and (ii) the release of intracellular (compartmentalized) Ca2+. Thus, prevention of external Ca2+ entry by the addition of EGTA or competing cations (i.e. Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe2+) diminished the first phase of Ca2+ uptake, whereas augmentation of the extracellular Ca2+ pool specifically enhanced this same wave of Ca2+ uptake. Taken together with data on the blockade of the second phase of Ca2+ influx by caffeine and niflumate, i.e. probable modulators of intracellular Ca2+ release, a strong case for the above Ca2+-gating assignments can now be made. This contention is also bolstered by observations that Mg2+, which blocks only the initial phase of Ca2+ influx, prevents externally added45Ca uptake, and niflumic acid, which eliminates only the second phase of Ca2+ influx, does not. We have also observed that communication may occur between the two waves of Ca2+ entry into the cytoplasm of a stimulated tobacco cell. Unfortunately, there are currently few clues in the literature regarding the mechanism through which this communication might occur. Although hypo-osmotic stress has been frequently observed in eukaryotic cells to activate release of both intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ stores, little data regarding cross-talk between these two Ca2+ depots has yet been presented (53Taylor A.R.

(Lond.). 1996; 493: 371-384Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the gating and signaling pathways activated by hypo-osmotic stimulus in nonplant systems may be very different from those in tobacco, since, opposite to the order of Ca2+-gating in tobacco cells, internal release of Ca2+ appears to precede influx of externally derived Ca2+ in mammalian cells (55McCarty N.A. O'Neil R.G. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 123: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 56Tinel H. Wehner F. Sauer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F130-F138PubMed Google Scholar, 57Wu X. Yang H.

(Lond.). 1996; 493: 371-384Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This order of Ca2+ channel activation in animal cells is reminiscent of the phenomenon of capacitative Ca2+ entry, in which intracellular release of Ca2+ leads to the activation of plasma membrane Ca2+ channels and the refilling of internal stores (27Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar, 59Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar, 60Zweifach A. Lewis R.S.

Although the mechanisms of communication between internal and external Ca2+ stores during capacitative Ca2+ entry are currently an area of intense research, no consensus mechanistic theory has been put forth (61Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). In osmotically stressed tobacco cells, a Ca2+-sensing mechanism that would adjust the Ca2+ efflux from the second (intracellular) Ca2+ store depending on the quantity of Ca2+delivered during the first (extracellular) phase of Ca2+entry can be easily envisioned. The intracellular Ca2+ gate would simply need to be negatively regulated by Ca2+ or a Ca2+-activated enzyme (e.g. a kinase) (62Bezprovzvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar, 63Roberts D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It will be important in the future to look for such a signaling mediator following treatment of stimulated cells with excess Ca2+ or EGTA (Figs. 2, A and B). In contrast to the feed-forward signaling mechanism hypothesized above, identification of a communication pathway that responds to the readiness state of the second phase of Ca2+ entry and pre-emptively modulates the first is more difficult to imagine. Nevertheless, pretreatment of osmotically stimulated tobacco cells with moderate concentrations of caffeine or niflumic acid invariably augments the initial Ca2+ transient before eliminating the latter (Fig. 4, A and B). However, Takahashiet al. (39Takahashi K. Isobe M.N. Knight M.R. Trewavas A.J. Muto S. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1997; 113: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have presented evidence that the general serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitors K252a and staurosporine selectively inhibit the second phase of Ca2+ influx without a compensating increase in the first phase. Thus, this modification of extracellular Ca2+ influx by internal Ca2+transport capability may not be a general phenomenon and may depend on the type inhibitors used. There are clearly complexities in these Ca2+ signaling pathways that will require considerable research to resolve. It will be interesting to explore the area of Ca2+ channel communication in plant cells and to possibly identify at both the protein and DNA level the Ca2+channels and other molecules involved. It was encouraging to observe that several inhibitors could be identified that selectively block cytosolic influx of Ca2+from either intracellular or extracellular Ca2+ stores. Although lanthanides and ruthenium red were found to inhibit both pathways of Ca2+ influx, the other modulators detailed above were highly selective for just one pathway. Based on these observations, it should now be possible to resolve which downstream consequences of hypo-osmotic shock rely on which phases of Ca2+ entry for signal propagation. It is conceivable, for example, that pathways designed to adjust cellular volume/turgor pressure during osmotic stress (14Ward J.M. Pei Z. Schroeder J.I.

Indeed, preliminary studies indicate that only the second of the two phases of Ca2+ entry is required to stimulate reactive oxygen biosynthesis following hypo-osmotic stimulation. 2S. G. Cessna, S.

By using pre-steady state kinetic methods, we examined the incorporation of the diphosphate of PMPA, 2′,3′-dideoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate (ddATP), and dATP catalyzed by wild-type human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase, an exonuclease-deficient T7 DNA polymerase (T7 exo−), and wild-type rat DNA polymerase β in order to evaluate the selectivity of PMPA as an antiviral inhibitor. With a DNA/DNA or DNA/RNA 22/43-mer duplex, the diphosphate of PMPA (PMPApp) is as effective as ddATP in reactions catalyzed by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in that both analogs have similar substrate specificity constants (k p /K d) which are only 5-fold lower than dATP. In contrast, PMPApp is a much weaker inhibitor of the reaction catalyzed by T7 exo−(with the DNA/DNA 22/43-mer duplex) in that PMPApp has a 5 × 10−4-fold lowerk p /K d than ddATP and dATP. The lower k p /K d of PMPApp is due to a 1000–2000-fold lower incorporation rate (k p) and a 35–45-fold lower binding constant (K d). Similarly, PMPApp is 800-fold less inhibitory toward polymerase β with the DNA/DNA 22/43-mer duplex, whereas in studies with a single nucleotide gapped DNA (22–20/43-mer) PMPApp is 13-fold less inhibitory than ddATP. Although parallel studies will need to be performed using appropriate human polymerases, these results begin to define the mechanistic basis for the reported lower toxicity of PMPA in the treatment of AIDS.

During replication, virally encoded reverse transcriptase (RT) copies the single-stranded viral RNA genome into a minus strand of DNA and then uses the resultant cDNA to synthesize a plus strand DNA to allow the double-stranded viral genome to be integrated into the DNA of the host. RT has been a key target in chemotherapy due to its essential role during the virus life cycle and due to the absence of a proofreading exonuclease that affords selective inhibition by chain terminators. Currently, five anti-RT nucleoside analogs, 3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine (AZT), 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine (ddC), 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine (ddI), 2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine (D4T), and (−)-β-l-2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine (3TC), have been approved for the treatment of AIDS (4Cherrington J.M. Mulato A.S. Fuller M.D. Chen M.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 2212-2216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These nucleoside analogs are converted to their triphosphate forms in vivo by cellular kinases where they compete with natural 2′-deoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphates (dNTPs) for uptake by RT for incorporation into viral DNA (5St. Clair M.H. Richards C.A. Spector T. Weinhold K.J. Miller W.H. Langlios A.J. Furman P.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1987; 31: 1972-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Once incorporated into viral DNA, these nucleotide analogs terminate the DNA synthesis due to the lack of a 3′-hydroxy group. A combination therapy of two nucleoside analogs and one protease inhibitor has been used with remarkable success in the clinical treatment of AIDS (6Cohen J. Science. 1997; 277: 32-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These potent three-drug mixtures can significantly drive down the viral load of HIV in the blood, increase levels of CD4 cells, and in many cases slow progression and prolong survival (6Cohen J. Science. 1997; 277: 32-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, long term usage of nucleoside analogs leads to selection of mutants of RT showing drug resistance (7Larder B.A. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 205-222Google Scholar). It has been shown that the quadruple mutation on RT (D67N, K70R, T215F or T215Y, and K219Q) confers more than 100-fold decrease in virus sensitivity to AZT (8Kellam P. Boucher C.A. Larder B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1934-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Moreover, nucleoside analogs also inhibit human DNA replication, particularly mitochondrial DNA synthesis, which leads to the toxicity of these nucleoside analogs. The inhibition of human mitochondrial DNA polymerase by AZT and ddC has been implicated as the basis for the toxicity of the two nucleoside analogs (9Chen C.-H. Cheng Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11934-11937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Amaudo E. Dalakas M. Shanske S. Moraes C.T. DiMauro S. Schon E.A. Lancet. 1991; 337: 508-510Abstract PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Drug resistance and toxicity problems challenge us to develop new anti-HIV drugs that are more powerful and less toxic. PMPA, 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl) adenine, is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate (Fig. 1). PMPA has been reported to effectively prevent infection of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a relative of HIV, in all tested long-tailed macaques for up to 56 weeks without adverse side effects after they were exposed to SIV up to 24 h (11Tsai C.C. Follis K.E. Sabo A. Beck T.W. Grant R.F. Bischofberger N. Benveniste R.E. Black R. Science. 1995; 270: 1197-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). PMPA has also been shown to have potent anti-HIV activity in vitro and in vivo (12Balzarini J. Pemo C.F. Schols D. De Clercq E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); and particularly, Gilead Sciences 2Gilead Sciences on-line address is as follows:www.gilead.com. recently reported (13Balzarini J.

Antiviral Res. 1997; 36: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in Phase I/II clinical evaluation without significant side effects. Like nucleoside analogs, PMPA is phosphorylated to its diphosphate form by cellular kinases in vivo (15Cherrington J.M. Allen S.J.W. Bischofberger N. Chen M.S. Antiviral Chem. Chemother. 1995; 6: 217-221Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The antiviral activity of PMPA is believed to be due to its incorporation into viral DNA which terminates DNA elongation due to its lack of a ribose ring (15Cherrington J.M. Allen S.J.W. Bischofberger N. Chen M.S. Antiviral Chem. Chemother. 1995; 6: 217-221Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A kinetic basis for PMPA as an effective and selective inhibitor of RT has not been established yet. In this report, we use pre-steady state kinetic analysis to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (K d), the maximum incorporation rate (k p), and the substrate specificity constant (k p/K d) for the incorporation of PMPApp catalyzed by wild-type HIV-1 RT, the exonuclease-deficient T7 DNA polymerase (T7 exo−), and wild-type rat DNA polymerase β (pol β). T7 DNA polymerase and rat DNA polymerase β were selected because they are considered to be good models of human DNA polymerase β and γ, respectively (see “Discussion”), and current preparations of the human enzymes are not yet sufficiently robust for these studies. Nuclear replicative polymerases α, δ, and ε were not studied because they were less sensitive to inhibition by antiviral nucleoside analogs than DNA polymerases β and γ (16Martin J.L. Brown C.E. Matthews-Davies N. Reardon J.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2743-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). For comparison, we determined the same kinetic parameters for the incorporation of dATP and ddATP. Since the structure of the ribose and not the nucleobase was the determinant of inhibitory effects of nucleotide analogs (16Martin J.L. Brown C.E. Matthews-Davies N. Reardon J.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2743-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), in our studies ddATP represents other nucleotide analogs. Therefore, these data provide a kinetic basis to assess the effectiveness and toxicity of PMPA as an antiviral drug.

PMPApp was obtained from Gilead Sciences (Foster City, CA). Wild-type HIV-1 RT was prepared as described previously (17Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12459-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli thioredoxin was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The exonuclease-deficient mutant (D5A and E7A) of T7 DNA polymerase (T7 exo−) was overexpressed and purified according to the published procedure (18Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Rat DNA polymerase β was a generous gift from Dr. Ming-Daw Tsai (Ohio State University). The protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, with the extinction coefficients of 260,450 (HIV-1 RT), 144,000 (T7 exo−), 13,700 (E. coli thioredoxin), and 21,200 (rat DNA polymerase β) m−1cm−1. The concentrations of HIV-1 RT, T7 exo−, and rat DNA polymerase β reported in this paper were corrected based on active-site titration as described previously (18Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A.

An RNA template of 43 nucleotides was synthesized by runoff transcription by T7 RNA polymerase using an AmpliScribe T7 high yield transcription kit from Epicentre Technologies (Madison, WI) according to manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase and purified by electrophoresis through 10% acrylamide, 8m urea, and TBE (89 mm Tris, 89 mmborate, 2 mm EDTA). The full-length template was electroeluted from the excised gel, precipitated, and resuspended in RNase-free Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.0). The purified RNA was 5′-32P-labeled, electrophoresed on a sequencing gel, and autoradiographed to determine purity. The concentration of purified RNA was measured spectrophotometrically at 260 nm, with an extinction coefficient of 473,480 m−1 cm−1 (20Dawson R.M.C. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M.

Open table in a new tab Before annealing, the DNA primer 22-mer was 5′-32P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase according to manufacturer's instructions. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a Biospin-30 column. The duplex DNA/DNA or DNA/RNA 22/43-mer was formed by annealing 5′-32P-labeled 22-mer and 43-mer at the molar ratio of 1.0:1.1. The gapped DNA 22–20/43-mer was formed by annealing 5′-32P-labeled 22-mer, 5′-phosphorylated 20-mer, and 43-mer at the molar ratio of 1.0:1.05:1.05. Prior to annealing, mixtures were denatured at 85 °C for 5 min and then cooled slowly to room temperature in 2 h. To ensure that annealing had taken place the duplex mixtures were analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. HIV-1 RT was preincubated with DNA/DNA and DNA/RNA substrates in RT buffer containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5 at 37 °C), 100 mm potassium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA. All reactions using RT were carried out at 37 °C in RT buffer containing 10 mm magnesium acetate. T7 exo− was preincubated with DNA 22/43-mer, E. coli thioredoxin, and DTT in T7 buffer containing 40 mm Tris chloride (pH 7.5 at 20 °C), 50 mmsodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as described (18Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). All reactions using T7 exo− were carried out at 20 °C in the T7 buffer containing 12.5 mm magnesium chloride additionally. All experiments using rat DNA polymerase β were carried out at 37 °C in pol β buffer containing 50 mm Tris chloride (pH 8.0 at 37 °C), 50 mm potassium chloride, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol (v/v). Rapid quench experiments were carried out in an apparatus designed by Johnson (21Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 677-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and built by KinTek Corp. 3KinTek Corp. on-line address is as follows:www.kintek-corp.com. (State College, PA). Typically, the experiments were carried out by allowing enzyme and DNA to preincubate in buffer in the presence or absence of Mg2+. An aliquot of this solution (15 μl) was rapidly mixed with an equal volume of solution containing nucleotide and Mg2+ loaded in the second loop of tubing. The reactions were quenched with 90 μl of 0.3 m EDTA (final concentration) after time intervals ranging from 5 ms to seconds. All concentrations reported in this paper refer to concentrations during reaction after mixing. A preincubated solution of enzyme and DNA or RNA at fixed concentrations (vary with different enzymes, see “Results”) was mixed with varying concentrations of Mg2+·dNTP (2–400 μm) in reaction buffer to start the reaction at 37 (for RT and pol β) or 20 °C (for T7 exo−). The reaction at each concentration of Mg2+·dNTP was terminated by 0.3 m EDTA at different times from milliseconds to seconds. The reaction products were analyzed by sequencing gel analysis. The time course of product formation was fitted to a single exponential equation for each concentration of Mg2+·dNTP (see “Data Analysis”) to give the observed rate of nucleotide incorporation. Then, the observed rates abstracted from a series of time courses of product formation were plotted against the concentrations of Mg2+·dNTP, and the data were fitted to a hyperbola (see “Data Analysis”) to give the equilibrium dissociation constant of dNTP, K d, and the maximum rate for incorporation of dNTP,k p. The DNA products were analyzed by sequencing gel electrophoresis (16% acrylamide, 8 m urea, 1× TBE running buffer) and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Data were fitted by nonlinear regression using the program GraFit (Erithacus Software). Data from burst experiments were fitted to a burst equation: [product] =E(1 − exp(−k 1 t) +k 2 t), where E represents the active enzyme concentration based on the active-site titration,k 1 the observed burst rate, and k 2 the observed steady state rate. The single turnover kinetic data were fitted to a single exponential equation: [product] = E(1 − exp(−k obs t)), where Erepresents the active enzyme concentration based on the active-site titration, and k obs is the observed rate. Data from measurement of K d of dNTP (dATP, ddATP, and PMPApp) were fitted to a hyperbolic equation:k obs = k p[dNTP]/{[dNTP] + K d}, where k p is the maximum rate of dNTP incorporation. An RNA template of 43 nucleotides (Table I) was derived from nucleotide 1623 to nucleotide 1665 of the HIV-1 RNA genome (22Ratner L. Haseltine W. Patarca R. Livak K.J. Starcich B. Josephs S.F.

Nature. 1985; 313: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). This RNA 43-mer was synthesized by runoff transcription by T7 RNA polymerase (see “Experimental Procedures”), yielding more than 100 full-length RNA molecules per template molecule. The sequence of the single-stranded template portion of the DNA/RNA 22/43-mer duplex (Table I) was computationally examined using an RNA folding program,Mfold (17Suo Z. Johnson K.A.

Thus, the kinetics of polymerization on 22/43-mer will not be affected by any RNA secondary structure (17Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12459-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). According to the template sequence, the next correct nucleotide for incorporation on the DNA or RNA 22/43-mer duplexes and the gapped DNA 22–20/43-mer is dATP (Table I). We studied the kinetics for incorporation of dATP, ddATP, and PMPApp using pre-steady state kinetic methods. Single nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by HIV-1 RT (19Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F.

The K dmeasurement was performed by reacting a preincubated solution of enzyme and primer/template (DNA or RNA template) with varying concentrations of Mg2+·dNTP and monitoring product formation over time. The observed rates of single nucleotide incorporation (E·22/43-mer → E·23/43-mer orE·22–20/43-mer → E·23–20/43-mer) were plotted against nucleotide concentrations. The data fit a hyperbola supporting the above pathway and gave values of K dand k p. The substrate specificity constant,k p /K d, was then calculated from the values of K d and k p. To measure the kinetic parameters K d and k p for incorporation of PMPApp, we examined the concentration dependence of the rate of single nucleotide incorporation of PMPApp using a synthetic oligonucleotide primer/template (see Table I). A preformed enzyme-DNA complex (HIV-1 RT·22/43-mer) was mixed with a solution of Mg2+·PMPApp. The polymerization reaction was quenched with 0.3 m EDTA at time intervals ranging from 6 ms to 2 s. The resulting time course of formation of labeled 23/43-mer (Fig. 2) shows a burst of incorporation followed by a slower linear phase, which is similar to dATP incorporation to DNA 25/45-mer previously observed by Kati et al. (19Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a similar kinetic mechanism. The data were fitted to a burst equation (see “Experimental Procedures”). The first turnover occurred at a rate of 35 ± 4 s−1, whereas subsequent turnovers occurred at a rate of 0.28 ± 0.04 s−1. Accordingly, the single turnover can be observed to occur during the first 200 ms of reaction with negligible contributions from subsequent turnovers. To explore the PMPApp concentration dependence of the reaction, a preincubated solution of HIV-1 RT (52.9 nm) and 5′-labeled DNA 23/43-mer (200 nm) was reacted with various concentrations of Mg2+·PMPApp (4–110 μm). The reactions were terminated with 0.3 m EDTA at time intervals ranging from 10 to 200 ms. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the observed single turnover rates for formation of 23/43-mer product increased with increasing concentrations of PMPApp. The dependence of the burst rate on the PMPApp concentrations is shown in Fig. 3 B along with the fit to a hyperbola giving a K d of 58 ± 11 μm and a k p of 49 ± 5 s−1 (Table II).Table IIKinetic constants with DNA 22/43-mer and HIV-1 RT at 37 °Ck pK dk p/K ds−1μmμm−1s−1dATP41.3 ± 0.68.1 ± 0.95.10ddATP55 ± 554 ± 111.02PMPApp49 ± 558 ± 110.84 Open table in a new tab The kinetics of incorporation of dATP and ddATP to DNA 22/43-mer catalyzed by RT were measured in the same manner as for PMPApp, and the kinetic data are reported in Table II. As expected, the values of K d and k p of dATP are similar to the corresponding kinetic data obtained by Kati et al. (19Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using DNA 25/45-mer. The specificity constants for the three substrates, k p /K d, were calculated and are also summarized in Table II. The binding affinity of PMPApp to the HIV-1 RT·RNA 22/43-mer complex (RNA template, DNA primer) was determined as above. At a fixed RT·RNA 22/43-mer concentration (59.3:200 nm), the single turnover rates of PMPApp incorporation increased with increasing concentrations of PMPApp (Fig. 4 A). The rates were plotted against the PMPApp concentrations, and the data were fitted into a hyperbola (Fig. 4 B). The hyperbolic plot gave a PMPApp K d of 34 ± 4 μm and ak p of 22 ± 1 s−1 (Table III).Table IIIKinetic constants with DNA/RNA 22/43-mer and HIV-1 RT at 37 °Ck pK dk p/K ds−1μmμm−1s−1dATP74 ± 516 ± 44.63ddATP53 ± 651 ± 131.04PMPApp22 ± 134 ± 40.65 Open table in a new tab The kinetics of incorporation of dATP and ddATP to RNA 22/43-mer catalyzed by RT were measured similarly, and the data are summarized in Table III. Again, the values of K d and k p of dATP are similar to the ones measured by Katiet al. (19Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using RNA 25/45-mer. The substrate specificity constants for dATP, ddATP, and PMPApp were calculated and summarized in Table III. The binding affinity and maximum rates of incorporation of dATP and ddATP catalyzed by T7 exo− at 20 °C were measured in the similar manner as above, and the data were listed in Table IV. The kinetics of dATP incorporation were similar to those previously observed by Patel et al. (18Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) using a DNA 25/36-mer. However, incorporation of Mg2+·PMPApp was much slower based on the pre-steady state kinetic analysis (data not shown) and required longer time courses to compensate for the slower rates. In order to eliminate the complication resulting from steady state formation of products in long reaction times, the measurements of K d and k p for PMPApp incorporation should be performed with T7 exo− in excess over DNA (26Johnson K.A. Enzymes. 1992; 20: 1-61Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar). However, we used slightly more DNA than enzyme in the experiments for incorporation of PMPApp in order to keep the same reaction conditions as for incorporation of ddATP and dATP. Thus, the observed single turnover rates of PMPApp incorporation in Fig. 5 may be slightly underestimated (maximum 2-fold). Fig. 5 A represents a series of time courses for the incorporation of Mg2+·PMPApp at a fixed concentration of T7 exo−·DNA 22/43-mer (100:200 nm) and varying PMPApp concentrations (2–200 μm). The time courses were fit to first-order processes individually to obtain observed rates. The incorporation rates were plotted against the concentrations of PMPApp in Fig. 5 B. The data fit a hyperbola with a K d of 268 ± 39 μm and a k p of 0.096 ± 0.009 s−1 (Table IV). The substrate specificity constants for dATP, ddATP, and PMPApp were calculated and summarized in Table IV.Table IVKinetic constants with DNA 22/43-mer and T7 DNA polymerase at 20 °Ck pK dk p/K ds−1μmμm−1s−1dATP156 ± 88 ± 219.5ddATP88 ± 36 ± 114.5PMPApp0.096 ± 0.009268 ± 393.6 × 10−4 Open table in a new tab Pre-steady state kinetic analysis revealed slow incorporation of PMPApp into DNA 22/43-mer catalyzed by pol β (data not shown). DNA was previously found to dissociate fast from the rat DNA pol β·DNA complex at a rate of 1–2 s−1 (27Ahn J. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1100-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In order to follow a single turnover of nucleotide incorporation, we used a 4:1 molar ratio of active enzyme to DNA to compensate for the fast DNA dissociation from pol β (26Johnson K.A. Enzymes. 1992; 20: 1-61Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The measurement of the PMPApp equilibrium dissociation constant was carried out at a fixed concentration of pol β·22/43-mer (200:50 nm) and varying PMPApp concentrations (10–400 μm). As shown in Fig. 6 A, the single turnover rates of PMPApp incorporation increased with increasing concentrations of PMPApp. The rates were plotted versus the PMPApp concentrations (Fig. 6 B), and the data fit a hyperbola with a K d of 1033 ± 120 μm and a maximum rate of incorporation of 1.0 ± 0.1 s−1. Although there is little curvature in Fig. 6 B, we could not perform experiments at higher concentrations of PMPApp. Nonetheless, the quality of the data allows a sufficiently precise estimate of theK d and maximum rates within reasonable limits of error. The K d and k p values for incorporation of dATP and ddATP were measured similarly except that shorter time courses were used due to faster incorporation rates. The data are summarized in Table V. Previous kinetic measurement for dATP incorporation to the rat DNA pol β·DNA 25/45-mer gave values of K d and k p of 52 ± 6 μm and 24.1 ± 0.9 s−1, respectively (27Ahn J. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1100-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These are slightly different from our data (Table V). The differences could be due to different DNA sequences and different reaction conditions.

Facilitative glucose transporters (Glut)1 are a family of structurally related, membrane-spanning glycoproteins that mediate the transport of glucose across bilipid layers of cell membranes along a concentration gradient (1Bell G.I.

Res. 1992; 31: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Of the six major isoforms cloned to date, Glut 3, the most efficient isoform with a K mof 1.8 mm (1Bell G.I. Burant C.F. Takeda J. Gould G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19161-19164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is predominantly expressed in cells with a high energy requirement. These cells include neurons of the brain (3Mantych G.J. James D.E. Chung H.D. Devaskar S.U. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1270-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and retina (4Mantych G.J.

Various studies have examined the response of Glut 3 secondary to differing perturbations. In the rat brain, there is an increase in Glut 3 expression under chronic insulin-induced glucose deprivation (6Uehara Y. Nipper V. McCall A.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E716-E719PubMed Google Scholar), hyperglycemia of diabetes mellitus (7Vannucci S.J. Maher F. Koehler E. Simpson I.A. Am. J.

In streptozotocin-induced diabetes, an increase in rat placental Glut 3 levels (11Bouileau P. Mrejan C. Girard J. Hauguel-deMouzon S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) has also been demonstrated. Cell-specific localization has revealed that Glut 3 is predominantly expressed in neuronal processes at a stage in development when most neuronal cells are fully differentiated (3Mantych G.J. James D.E. Chung H.D. Devaskar S.U. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1270-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Prior to the mature stages of development, little to no Glut 3 is noted in cells with a neuronal phenotype (3Mantych G.J. James D.E. Chung H.D. Devaskar S.U. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1270-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In placental trophoblasts, Glut 3 is primarily localized to the cells on the fetal surface of the materno-fetal barrier (5Devaskar S.U. Devaskar U.P. Schroeder R.E. deMello D.E. Fiedorek Jr., F.T. Mueckler M. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1994; 171: 1316-1323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the levels of this protein increase during late gestation when fetal growth is maximal (12Ehrhardt R.A. Bell A.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 42: R1132-R1141Google Scholar). In both cell types, Glut 1, the isoform that is ubiquitously found in all proliferating cells (1Bell G.I. Burant C.F. Takeda J. Gould G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19161-19164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Devaskar S.U. Mueckler M.M. Pediatr. Res. 1992; 31: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), is replaced by Glut 3 when the cells begin differentiating to attain their mature functional form (3Mantych G.J. James D.E. Chung H.D. Devaskar S.U. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1270-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 5Devaskar S.U. Devaskar U.P. Schroeder R.E. deMello D.E. Fiedorek Jr., F.T. Mueckler M. Am. J. Obstet.

This developmental expression of Glut 3 in brain and placenta is not unlike the other glucose transporter isoforms, namely Glut 4 in insulin-sensitive tissues (13Postic C. Leturque A.E. Printz R.L. Maulard P. Loizeau M. Granner D.K. Girard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E548-E559PubMed Google Scholar) and Glut 2 in the liver (13Postic C. Leturque A.E. Printz R.L. Maulard P. Loizeau M. Granner D.K. Girard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E548-E559PubMed Google Scholar), which replace Glut 1 when the cells in these tissues stop proliferating and begin differentiating into the adult phenotype. Recent studies using antisense oligoprobes in producing a Glut 3 null mutant mouse resulted in abnormal blastocyst differentiation leading to an arrest in embryonic development (14Pantaleon M. Harvey M.B. Pascoe W.S. James D.E. Kaye P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3795-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This observation attests to the critical need for Glut 3 during the early stages of embryonic differentiation. Thus Glut 3 at this stage of development cannot be effectively replaced by any other related glucose transporter isoform (Glut 1), supporting its indispensable role in cell development, particularly in differentiation of high energy-requiring cell types (3Mantych G.J. James D.E. Chung H.D. Devaskar S.U. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1270-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,5Devaskar S.U. Devaskar U.P. Schroeder R.E. deMello D.E. Fiedorek Jr., F.T.

Cis-elements and trans-activating factors that confer tissue specificity have been identified in the case of other facilitative glucose transporter isoforms such as Glut 1 (15Murakami T. Nishiyama T. Shirotani T. Shinohara Y. Kan M. Ishii K. Kanai F. Nakazuru S. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9300-9306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Glut 2 (16Bonny C. Thompson N. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1413-1426PubMed Google Scholar), and Glut 4 (17Liu M-L. Olson A.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Buse J.B. Bell G.I. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11673-11676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We undertook the present study to identify cis-elements and transactivating factors involved in regulating Glut 3 expression in neuroblasts and trophoblasts. We employed the murine Glut 3 genomic sequences and two cell lines arising from different species that express the neuroblastic phenotype along with an embryonic trophoblastic cell line (positive control) and COS-7 cells (negative control). We identified the cis-elements (bp −203 to +237), which activate Glut 3 transcription, and further demonstrated that suppression of the Glut 3 transcriptional activity resided (bp −137 to −130) within this activating region. These suppressive cis-elements bound Sp1 and Sp3 in neuroblasts and trophoblasts. Both of these nuclear factors reciprocally modify Glut 3 gene transcription in the Sp-deficient Drosophila SL2 cells. Thus, in cultured proliferating neuroblasts and trophoblasts, Sp1 possibly represses while Sp3 activates murine Glut 3 transcription. N2A murine neuroblastoma cells (American Tissue Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were grown at 37 °C with 95% air, 5% CO2 in 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine-coated culture flasks and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum. COS-7 cells (monkey kidney fibroblasts) (American Tissue Culture Collection) were grown directly on unmodified culture flasks under similar conditions. An immortalized rat embryonic hippocampal neural cell line with a neuroblastic phenotype (H19-7) that has previously (18Eves T.M. Tucker M.S. Roback J.D. Downen M. Rosner M.R. Wainer B.H. Proc. Natl.

Mid-gestation trophoblastic cells obtained from the rat placenta were grown and maintained in RPMI medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 50 μmβ-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm sodium pyruvate as described previously (19Soares M.J. Schaberg K.D. Pinal C.S. Hunt J.S. Dev. Biol. 1987; 124: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Poly(A+)-enriched RNA was extracted from confluent cultured N2A, COS-7, H19-7, and HRP.1 cells obtained from a single 175-cm tissue culture flask (∼1 × 108cells) as per the manufacturer's instructions using the Miniribosep extraction kit (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA). The extracted RNAs were subjected to Northern blot analysis as described previously (20Devaskar S.U. Giddings S.J. Rajakumar P.A. Carnaghi C.R. Menon R.K. Zahm D.S. J. Biol.

Interlane loading variability was standardized by rehybridization of the stripped filters with a 32P-labeled mouse β-actin cDNA probe (22Tokunaga K. Taniguchi H. Yoda K. Shimizu M. Sakiyama S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Thirty to fifty μg of either cellular homogenate or extracted nuclear protein was solubulized in 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS, and the protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad dye-binding assay (23Schroeder R.E. Doria-Medina C.L. Das U.G. Sivitz W.I. Devaskar S.U. Pediatr. Res. 1997; 41: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously (23Schroeder R.E. Doria-Medina C.L. Das U.G. Sivitz W.I. Devaskar S.U. Pediatr.

The primary antibody consisted of an affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse Glut 3 IgG, which was generated against the keyhole limpet-linked terminal 17 amino acids of the mouse Glut 3 protein. Following characterization of tissue and isoform specificity of this antibody (data not shown), we carried out incubations with protein samples transferred to the nitrocellulose filters. The primary anti-mouse Glut 3 antibody was used at 1:500 dilution, and the incubation was carried out at room temperature for 16 h. Mouse Glut 3 peptide (0.1 μg) preabsorbed rabbit anti-mouse Glut 3 antibody served as the negative control. To detect nuclear proteins, the rabbit anti-synthetic human Sp1 peptide (amino acids 436–454), anti-synthetic human Sp3 (amino acids 676–695 in the C-terminal region) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-rat cAMP response element-binding protein (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), and anti-mouse c-Jun (amino acids 247–263) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) IgGs were used at a 1:500 dilution. The corresponding peptides (2 μg) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to preabsorb and saturate the IgGs where indicated. 125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (NEN Life Science Products; 50,000 cpm/sample) was used to detect the primary antigen-antibody complex. Autoradiography of the filters was carried out for optimal lengths of time to maintain linearity of the signal. Primer extension was carried out as described previously (24Boorstein W.R. Craig E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 347-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). An antisense oligonucleotide (Cruachem Inc., Dulles, VA) complementary to bp 299–320 of the murine Glut 3 mRNA (CTTCGTTGTCCCCATGGTCCCA) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. ∼5 × 106 cpm (50 fmol) of the labeled oligonucleotide and five μg of poly(A+) mRNA were dissolved in 1 μl of the hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 0.4m NaCl, 40 mm NaCl, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, and 1 mm EDTA) at 95 °C for 10 min. Hybridization between the mRNA and the labeled oligonucleotide was accomplished for 16 h at 42 °C. Reverse transcription was initiated by adding 30 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) to the mRNA/oligonucleotide mixture in 20 μl of a mixture consisting of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 6 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 10 units of RNasin, 0.625 mm dNTPs, and the reaction was carried out at 42 °C for 1 h. The primer-extended products were purified using Jetsorb (Genomed Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC) and separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels. To demonstrate that the transcription start site did not differ in the Glut 3 5′-flanking sequence-luciferase fusion gene, primer extension was carried out with mRNA extracted from N2A cells transfected with the −203 to +305 bp Glut 3-Luc construct (Fig. 2 A) and32P-labeled luciferase gene-specific primer GL2 (5′-CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCCA) (Promega). RNase protection assay was carried out as per the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion, Austin, TX). A 440-bp fragment spanning from bp −203 to +237 of the mouse Glut 3 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pGEM3z(f) at KpnI and HindIII sites.32P-Labeled antisense RNA probe was synthesized by the Sp6 polymerase and a riboprobe kit (Promega). About 50,000 cpm (∼0.5 fmol) of gel-purified riboprobe was hybridized overnight at 45 °C to 5 μg of mRNA from N2A, HRP.1, and H19-7 cells in a hybridization buffer containing 80% formamide, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4, 300 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.4, and 1 mmEDTA. The hybrid was digested with 200 μl of a 1:50 dilution of RNase A (250 units/ml) and RNase T1 (10,000 units/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C prior to analysis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. 0.5 × 106 phage of a C57KSJ mouse genomic library was screened with a 32P-labeled 1.5-kb mouse Glut 3 cDNA (21Nagamatsu S. Kornhauser J.M. Burant C.F. Seino S. Mayo K.E. Bell G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 467-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and two clones were isolated. Hybridization to a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to the first 41 bp of the 5′-untranslated region (5′-AGAGGTATCCAGCCAATGTTCTCGGCAGCAAGTGTTCCTC-3′) and the bp 56–500 fragment of the mouse Glut 3 cDNA (21Nagamatsu S. Kornhauser J.M. Burant C.F. Seino S. Mayo K.E. Bell G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 467-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified one of the two clones as containing the 11-kb genomic insert having the 5′-flanking region of the murine Glut 3 gene. Furthermore, partial sequencing of this ∼11-kb clone confirmed the identity with a previously sequenced mouse Glut 3 genomic clone (GenBankTMaccession no. U11844), which we subsequently obtained from Takeda and Bell. A ∼1.8-kb fragment of the mouse Glut 3 gene spanning the bp −1553 to +237 region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into an enhancerless and promoterless luciferase reporter gene-containing vector (pGL2-basic; Promega). Subsequently, serial 5′-deletional mouse Glut 3-Luc fusion gene constructs were created by using a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy employing primers outlined in Table I. The sequence and orientation of the individual clones was confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination sequencing method (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar).

Essentially, 5 μg of the pGL2-vector containing the different 5′-deletional DNA constructs was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with Lipofectin (25 μl) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 200 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After thorough washing with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, the cells were exposed to this preincubated DNA-lipofectin complex. pRL-Tk plasmid DNA (thymidine kinase promoter-driven Renilla luciferase, 0.5 μg; Promega) was co-transfected with each individual transfectant to standardize the results for transfection efficiency. The luciferase reporter activity was assessed by the dual luciferase assay (Promega). Briefly, 36–48 h post-transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed using 0.5 ml of passive lysis buffer (Promega). The supernatant upon centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min was stored at −70 °C until analysis. Twenty μl of this cellular extract was mixed with 100 μl of the luciferase assay buffer, and the luciferase activity was measured as light output (15 s) in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence, San Diego, CA) (27Menon R.K. Stephan D.A. Singh M. Morris Jr., S.M. Zhou L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8851-8859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the Renilla luciferase activity was estimated after the addition of 100 μl of the Stop and Glo reagent, and the light output (15 s) was measured separately. TheRenilla-driven luciferase activity was used to standardize the Glut 3 promoter-driven luciferase activity for transfection efficiency. The corrected Glut 3 promoter-driven luciferase activity is expressed as a percentage of the SV40 promoter-driven luciferase activity that served as the positive control in every transfection experiment. Nuclear extracts from the N2A, H19-7, and HRP.1 cells were prepared as described by Wildeman et al. (28Wildeman A.G. Sassone-Corsi P. Grundstrom T. Zenke M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 3129-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Routinely, 5 × 108 cells were retrieved by a rubber policeman and suspended in 10 mmHepes, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. The cells were homogenized using an all glass Dounce homogenizer with pestle B. The disruption was monitored microscopically, and the isolated nuclei were collected as a pellet upon centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. The nuclear pellet was resuspended and incubated on ice for 15 min in four volumes of a high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25% glycerol) to extract the nuclear proteins. The extracted nuclear proteins were collected as the supernatant after centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min and precipitated with solid (NH4)2SO4 (0.33 g/ml). The nuclear protein extract pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume of 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 17% (v/v) glycerol and dialyzed at 4 °C against 50 volumes of the 10 mm Hepes buffer. The nuclear proteins were separated from the (NH4)2SO4 by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was stored in aliquots at −70 °C. The concentration of the solubulized nuclear protein was measured by the method of Bradford (23Schroeder R.E. Doria-Medina C.L. Das U.G. Sivitz W.I. Devaskar S.U. Pediatr. Res. 1997; 41: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Synthesized double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Approximately 6 fmol of the labeled DNA oligoprobe was added to 5 μg of nuclear extract in a final volume of 20 μl containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the DNA-protein complexes were separated from the free DNA by electrophoresis through a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in a 90 mm Tris borate, 2 mmEDTA buffer (29Haas S. Gordon J. Khalili K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3103-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography in the presence of intensifying screens (DuPont) at −80 °C. Competition experiments included the addition of a 10–1000-fold excess of unlabeled DNA oligonucleotides, while supershift analysis included the addition of 2 μg of the respective antibody to the reaction mix for 15 min. In certain reactions, mutant oligonucleotides with sequences containing the modified Sp1 binding site of the mouse Glut 3 gene were synthesized and used in mobility shift assays (Table II).Table IIPrimers used for creating mutationsDNA constructSequence informationNucleotide (bp)OrientationG3-Sp1CAAATTTGCCCGCCCTCCAAACTTG−144 to −119SenseG3-Sp1CAAGTTTGGAGGGCGGGCAAATTTG−119 to −144AntisenseG3-Sp1mutGCCTTCAAATTTGCTTGCTTTCCAAAC−149 to −123SenseG3-Sp1mutGTTTGGAAAGCAAGCAAATTTGAAGGC−123 to −149AntisenseMutations are in boldface type.

N2A cell nuclear extracts (5 μg) and human recombinant Sp1 (1 footprint unit) were incubated together or separately with the radiolabeled bp −149 to −124 region of the mouse Glut 3 gene prior to analysis by the mobility shift assays. In another set of experiments, the N2A nuclear extracts were incubated with okadaic acid (50, 100, or 200 nm) (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 5 min prior to the addition of recombinant human Sp1 (0.25 footprint unit) followed by the mobility shift assay. The linearized bp −203 to +320 of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse Glut 3 gene was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Approximately 50,000 cpm (0.5 fmol) of the end-labeled mouse Glut 3 probe was preincubated with 25–30 μg of the nuclear protein extract in the mobility shift buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol), and the DNA-protein complex was subjected to partial DNase I digestion (25 ng) (30Rajakumar R.A.

Co-transfections were carried out in DrosophilaSchneider cells (American type culture Collection), which were maintained at room temperature in modified Schneider'sDrosophila medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were seeded at 2 × 106/60-mm culture dish immediately prior to transfection. DNAs were transfected into cells by the liposome-mediated transfection (26Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R.

Successful transfection of expression vectors was confirmed by detecting the Sp1 and Sp3 proteins in cell lysates by Western blot analysis. The target DNA constructs were also transfected with the vectors pAct (32Bigger C.B. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol.

Following incubation of these cells as described previously, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was determined (27Menon R.K. Stephan D.A. Singh M. Morris Jr., S.M. Zhou L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8851-8859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase expression driven by a Rous sarcoma viral promoter (RSV-β-gal) to correct for transfection efficiency. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by a commercially available kit (Promega). All data are depicted as mean ± S.E. Differences between two groups were validated by Student'st test, while differences between more than two groups were determined by one way analysis of variance and intergroup differences were validated by Neuman-Kuel's test. Glut 3 was abundantly expressed (mRNA and protein) in the mouse neuroblastoma (N2A) and the placental trophoblastic (HRP.1) cells with minimal amounts detected in H19-7 immortalized embryonic rat hippocampal neural cells. In contrast, no Glut 3 expression was noted in the COS-7 cells (Fig. 1, Aand B). Primer extension studies determined the major transcription start site for mouse Glut 3 to be 305 nucleotides 5′ to the ATG translational codon (Fig. 1 C). The minor extended products are characteristic of the infidelity of a TATA-less GC-rich promoter. In addition, minor size differences were noted in the major extended product between the three cell lines, namely the N2A,"
https://openalex.org/W2012079398,"The effect of DNA secondary structure on polymerization catalyzed by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) was studied using a synthetic 66-nucleotide DNA template containing a stable hairpin structure. Four RT pause sites were identified within the first half of the hairpin stem. Additionally, five weak pause sites within the second half of the stem and the loop of the hairpin were identified at low temperatures. These weak pause sites were relocated to the site of the first few stem base pairs of two new hairpins formed due to a change in DNA secondary structure. Each pause site was correlated with a high free energy barrier of melting the stem base pair. Pre-steady state kinetic analysis of single nucleotide incorporation showed that polymerization at each pause site occurred by both a fast phase (10–20 s−1) and a slow phase (0.02–0.07 s−1) during a single binding event. The reaction amplitudes of the fast phase were small (4–10% of enzyme sites), whereas the amplitudes of the slow phase were large (14–40%) at the pause sites. In contrast, only a single phase with a large reaction amplitude (32–50%) and a fast nucleotide incorporation rate (33–87 s−1) was observed at the non-pause sites. DNA substrates at all sites had similar dissociation rates (0.14–0.29 s−1) and overall binding affinity (16–86 nm). These results suggest that the DNA substrates at pause sites were bound in both productive and non-productive states at the polymerase site of RT. The non-productively bound DNA was slowly converted into a productive state upon melting of the next stem base pair without dissociation of the DNA from RT.

Reverse transcriptase (RT)1 encoded by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is responsible for converting the viral single-stranded RNA genome into a double-stranded proviral DNA, which is then integrated into the host genome (1Hottiger M. Hubscher U. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 97-120PubMed Google Scholar). HIV-1 RT has three activities as follows: RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent polymerases and RNase H (2Goff S. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1990; 3: 817-831PubMed Google Scholar). RT is a heterodimer of a 66-kDa subunit (p66) and a 51-kDa subunit (p51). The p51 subunit is a proteolytic fragment of the p66 subunit formed by the viral protease. The p66 subunit possesses polymerase and RNase H activities, whereas the p51 subunit lacks RNase H activity, and its polymerase active site is buried by the p66 subunit in the RT heterodimer (3Jacobo-Molina A. Arnold E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6351-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). During HIV-1 replication (1Hottiger M. Hubscher U. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 97-120PubMed Google Scholar), RT first copies the viral RNA genome into a minus strand cDNA using a tRNALys-3 as a primer. During polymerization of the cDNA strand, the RNase H activity hydrolyzes the entire RNA template with the exception of two short polypurine tracts. Then, RT utilizes the two polypurine tracts as primers to synthesize plus strand DNA and yields two discrete segments. Finally, both minus strand and plus strand strands are fully replicated through a strand displacement DNA synthesis mechanism. During DNA synthesis, putative DNA secondary structures and template sequences have been found to arrest DNA polymerase α (4Kaguni L.S. Clayton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

DNA secondary structures formed from palindromic and quasipalindromic sequences were assumed to facilitate interstrand misalignment of nucleotide repeats and may be responsible for replication-based mutations (10Trinh T.Q.

It has also been observedin vitro that HIV-1 RT pausing occurs not only in most runs (≥4 bases) of template adenosines and thymidines but also within the first few nucleotides of the predicated DNA secondary structures during primer elongation with large DNA templates derived from thegag, pol, and env genes of HIV-1 genome (12Dudding L.R.

HIV-1 RT pausing during plus strand synthesis was found to significantly enhance mutational frequency (14Ji J. Hoffmann J. Loeb L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, potential DNA secondary structures may have significant effects on processivity and fidelity of DNA polymerases, but the effects of DNA secondary structures on DNA synthesis have not been directly studied to date. Previously, we have utilized a 66-nucleotide RNA template containing a stable RNA hairpin to study effects of RNA secondary structure on polymerization catalyzed by HIV-1 RT in detail (15Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12468-12476Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12459-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14778-14785Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The DNA analog of the 66-nucleotide RNA template should contain a similar, stable DNA hairpin structure. Therefore, we used the 66-mer DNA as template to determine the effect of DNA secondary structure on DNA synthesis catalyzed by HIV-1 RT. Our experiments not only confirmed the existence of a template hairpin but also revealed that the DNA hairpin strongly stalled RT at several sites. We also showed that the DNA hairpin structure changed during polymerization. The structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic bases for RT pausing and DNA secondary structure switching are established in this report. Wild-type HIV-1 RT was prepared as described previously (15Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12468-12476Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All concentrations of RT reported in this paper were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, with an extinction coefficient of 260,450 m−1 cm−1. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Acrylamide, dNTPs, EDTA, Tris acetate, magnesium acetate, sodium acetate, and urea were purchased from Sigma. Biospin columns were purchased from Bio-Rad. The DNA 66-mer template (Fig. 1) and DNA primers that are complementary to the 3′ termini of the DNA 66-mer as well as control DNA 25/45-mer listed in Table I were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). The DNA oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and their concentrations were determined by UV absorbance at 260 nm. Before annealing, DNA primers were 5′32P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase.

Open table in a new tab DNA duplexes were formed by annealing primers and templates at the molar ratio of 1.0:1.1. Prior to annealing, mixtures were denatured at 90 °C for 5 min and then cooled slowly to room temperature in 2 h. To ensure that annealing had taken place the duplex mixtures were analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Unless notice noted otherwise, all experiments using RT were carried out in RT-Mg2+ buffer containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5 at 37 °C), 10 mmmagnesium acetate, 100 mm potassium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA. The pH of RT-Mg2+ buffer at 21 and 8 °C was 7.8 and 8.2, respectively. RT binding buffer is the same as RT-Mg2+ buffer except the pH was adjusted to 7.5 at 23 °C. Rapid quench experiments were carried out in an apparatus designed by Johnson (18Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 677-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and built by KinTek Corp. (State College, PA). 2KinTek Corp. on-line address is as follows:www.kintek-corp.com. Typically, the experiments were carried out by allowing enzyme and DNA to preincubate in RT-Mg2+ buffer. An aliquot of this solution (15 μl) was rapidly mixed with an equal volume of solution containing nucleotide and Mg2+. The reactions were quenched with 90 μl of 0.3 m EDTA (final concentration) after time intervals ranging from 5 ms to seconds. All concentrations reported in this paper refer to concentrations during reactions after mixing. Pre-steady state kinetic analysis was conducted under the conditions where the DNA concentration was in slight excess relative to the enzyme concentration. The reactions were carried out by mixing a solution containing the preincubated complex of 50 nm HIV-1 RT and 100 nm 5′-labeled DNA duplex in RT-Mg2+ buffer with a solution of 100 μmdNTP in RT-Mg2+ buffer. Polymerization was quenched with 0.3 m EDTA at time intervals ranging from 6 ms to 7 s. DNA products were quantitated by sequencing gel analysis (see below). The data were fitted to a burst equation (see “Data Analysis”). We used a previously published procedure to measure equilibrium dissociation constants of DNA substrates (19Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Filter binding was carried out using a 96-well dot-blot apparatus, nitrocellulose, and DEAE membranes from Schleicher & Schuell. This assay is based on the ability of the nitrocellulose membrane retaining RT·DNA and the DEAE membrane trapping all remaining DNA duplexes. Wild-type RT (40 nm) was preincubated with increasing concentrations of DNA in RT binding buffer (50 mm Tris acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mmpotassium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 at 23 °C). Immediately prior to filtering each sample, a well of the dot-blot apparatus was washed with 100 μl of RT binding buffer. With the vacuum applied, 20 μl of each sample was added to the well followed by 100 μl of RT binding buffer. This was repeated three times for each DNA/RNA duplex concentration. Following titration, substrate binding was quantitated using a 445 SI PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Products were analyzed by sequencing gel electrophoresis through 10–20% acrylamide, 8 m urea and 1× TBE running buffer (89 mm Tris-Cl, 89 mmborate, and 2 mm EDTA), and the products were quantitated using the 445 SI PhosphorImager. Data were fitted by nonlinear regression using GraFit (Erithacus Software). Data from burst experiments were fitted to a burst equation: [product] =AE 0(1 − exp(−k 1 t) +k 2 t), where A represents the enzyme amplitude, E 0 the enzyme concentration measured spectrophotometrically,k 1 the observed burst rate, and k 2 the observed steady state rate. Biphasic kinetic data were fitted to a double exponential equation: [product] = E 0 A 1(1 − exp(−k 1 t)) +E 0 A 2(1 − exp(−k 2 t)), whereE 0 represents the total enzyme concentration measured spectrophotometrically, A 1 the fast phase enzyme amplitude, k 1 the observed fast phase rate, A 2 the fast phase enzyme amplitude, and k 2 the observed slow phase rate. Data from DNA dissociation rate measurements were fitted to a single exponential equation: [product] = E f +E D(1 − exp(−kt)), whereE f and E D represent the free and DNA-bound active enzyme concentrations, respectively, in the preincubated solution of enzyme and DNA, and k represents the dissociation rate of E·DNA. Data from the nitrocellulose-DEAE double-filter binding assay were fitted to a quadratic equation: [E·DNA] = 0.5(K d +E 0 + D 0) − 0.5((K d + E 0 +D 0)2 − 4E 0 D 0)1/2, where K d represents the equilibrium dissociation constant for DNA substrate, E 0 the active enzyme concentration, and D 0 the DNA concentration. A DNA folding computer program,Mfold, 3Mfold is accessible on-line at the following address: http://ibc.wustl.edu/∼zuker/.cgi. was used to locate secondary structures of the DNA 66-mer template and to calculate the folding free energy of optimal and suboptimal secondary structures. Mfold was based on the energy minimization method of Zuker (20Zuker M. Science. 1989; 244: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar), and the energy values were developed by SantaLucia et al. (21SantaLucia Jr., J. Allawi H.T. Seneviratne P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3555-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). A synthetic DNA 66-mer template, the analog of the previously studied RNA 66-mer which was derived from HIV-1 RNA genome (15Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12468-12476Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12459-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14778-14785Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), was annealed with a 25-mer primer to form a DNA substrate 25/66-mer (Fig. 1). The folding of the single-stranded region of the template of 25/66-mer was examined using a DNA folding program, Mfold.3 An optimal secondary structure with a stem of 10 base pairs and a loop of 6 nucleotides was predicted as shown in Fig. 1. Its folding free energy is −12.9 kcal/mol at 37 °C, and it is at least 8.8 kcal/mol more stable than any other possible structures. The DNA hairpin structure of 25/66-mer (Fig. 1) was confirmed by DNA footprinting analysis using DNase I and DNase S1 (data not shown). We examined the kinetics of processive polymerization to test whether RT pausing occurs on the DNA hairpin of 25/66-mer. A preincubated solution of wild-type HIV-1 RT and 5′-32P-labeled 25/66-mer in RT-Mg2+ buffer was mixed with all four deoxynucleotides in RT-Mg2+ buffer at either 37, 21, or 8 °C. After various intervals, the reactions were stopped by 0.3 m EDTA, and the products were analyzed using denaturing sequencing gels as shown in Fig. 2. At 37 °C, the intermediate products 32-, 34-, 35-, and 36-mer accumulated slightly, and the full-length products formed rapidly. At 21 and 8 °C, these same intermediates accumulated more significantly (Fig. 2, B and C). Moreover, the 40-, 41-, 42-, 47-, and 48-mer accumulated slightly at 21 °C and particularly at 8 °C. The early intermediate 28-mer also accumulated slightly, which is likely a consequence of the run of template thymidines (13Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RT pausing after synthesis of the 32-, 34-, 35-, and 36-mer was expected because these strong pause sites correspond to GC base pairs in the stem of the DNA hairpin (Fig. 1). Slight RT pausing after synthesis of 40-, 41-, and 42-mer at 21 °C and 8 °C was unexpected, but plausible, since these weak pause sites were also located within the hairpin stem (Fig. 1). A slight accumulation of 47- and 48-mer was surprising because these two weak pause sites were located within the hairpin loop. RT pausing slightly at these two sites may be due to sequence dependence of the polymerase activity of RT during polymerization or DNA secondary structure change leading to relocation of the pause sites within a new hairpin. To test the second possibility, we used Mfold to locate optimal structures of the remaining single-stranded template, whereas the 25-mer primer was gradually elongated. With primers shorter than 37 nucleotides, structure A (Fig. 3) was predicted to be the optimal structure, whereas structure B was the most stable structure with primers equal to or longer than 37 nucleotides. Structure C is the second most stable structure when primers are longer than 37 nucleotides and is only 1.5 kcal/mol less stable than structure B at 8 °C. This suggests that structure C may exist significantly to compete against structure B to stall RT once the primer was longer than 37 nucleotides. Interestingly, the five weak pause sites were within the bases of the hairpin stems of structures B and C rather than at the loop and the second half of the hairpin stem of structure A. Thus, DNA secondary structure switching is a likely reason for the slight accumulation of 40- to 42-mer and 47- to 48-mer. To test further whether the slight accumulation of 47- and 48-mer is due to DNA secondary structure switching or sequence dependence of polymerization, we performed processive experiments with a 61-nucleotide DNA template (Fig. 4), which lacks the first five nucleotides of the 5′ terminus of the DNA 66-mer. Mfoldpredicted that the DNA secondary structure change from structure A to B (Fig. 3) should not occur with the 61-mer template. Thus, the intermediates 47- and 48-mer would not accumulate with the 61-mer template if RT pausing at these two sites was due to DNA secondary structure change. In contrast, if sequence dependence of polymerization was partially or totally responsible for the slight accumulation of the 47- and 48-mer, RT pausing at the two sites should still occur with the 61-mer template because the 61- and 66-mer templates have identical sequences except for length. As shown in Fig. 4, the product accumulation pattern with the 61-mer template observed at 8 °C is similar to the one observed with the 66-mer template (Fig. 2 C), except that the accumulation of the 47- and 48-mer did not occur. Thus, these results strongly support that the slight accumulation of the 47- and 48-mer with the 66-mer template was due to DNA secondary structure switching from structure A to B in Fig. 3rather than sequence dependence of polymerization. Once RT encounters a DNA hairpin, each stem base pair has to be melted prior to next nucleotide incorporation. Each unwinding step surpasses a certain energy barrier, the strength of which depends on the base pair and the nearest neighbors in the stem base pair (21SantaLucia Jr., J. Allawi H.T. Seneviratne P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3555-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). RT is expected to pause at each site where the next stem base pair is difficult to melt. Thus, the free energy barrier of base pair melting is very likely in correlation to RT pausing. By using Mfold, we located optimal template secondary structures with various primers annealed to the 66-mer DNA template. We further calculated the free energy change (ΔG) of each DNA optimal structure relative to its unfolded state usingMfold. The value of ΔG was then used in the following calculations: ΔΔG i = ΔG i − ΔG i−1, which represents the difference in stability of template annealed to ani and i − 1 nucleotide primer. The free energy difference ΔΔG i is equal to the free energy barrier of melting the next stem base pair prior to the incorporation of the ith nucleotide primed with anI−1 nucleotide primer. As shown in Fig. 5, the calculated energy barriers at 37 and 8 °C were plotted versus positions of nucleotides incorporated through the DNA hairpin. The energy barriers at 21 °C were also calculated (data not shown), and they are between the values of 37 and 8 °C. Interestingly, the variation in unwinding energy barrier (Fig. 5) correlates well with the product accumulation patterns (Fig. 2,A and C). Non-pause sites have either low or negligible free energy barriers. The RT pause sites after synthesis of the 32-, 34-, 35-, and 36-mer have high unwinding free energy barriers for next nucleotide incorporations. After synthesis of the 37-mer, the unwinding energy barrier changes from unfavorable (positive) to slightly favorable (negative) indicate that there is a potential DNA secondary structure change (Fig. 3). The slight accumulation of the 47- and 48-mer correlates to high unwinding free energy barriers for incorporations of the 48th and 49th nucleotides. Similarly, the relatively high free energy barriers of next stem base pair unwinding in structure C (data not shown) contributed to slight accumulation of 40- to 42-mer. Additionally, the base pair unwinding energy barriers are higher at 8 than at 37 °C. Accumulation of intermediate products indicates that the kinetics of next nucleotide incorporation were significantly affected by the DNA secondary structure. To determine a kinetic basis for intermediate accumulation, we performed pre-steady state kinetic analysis of single nucleotide incorporation at three strong pause sites and two non-pause sites. Primers listed in Table I were synthesized, purified, and annealed to the DNA 66-mer template. The pre-steady state kinetics of next correct nucleotide incorporation into the annealed DNA duplexes were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As a control, we also measured the kinetics of dATP incorporation into 25/45-mer (Table I), which was previously used as a model substrate to establish the kinetic pathway of HIV-1 RT (22Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The time courses (not shown) of dCTP incorporation into 37/66-mer, dGTP incorporation into 20/66-mer, and dATP incorporation into 25/45-mer are similar to each other and to previously published data (22Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that kinetics of nucleotide incorporation at non-pause sites were not affected by DNA hairpin structure. Each time course displays a fast phase followed by a slower linear phase. The data were fitted to a burst equation, and the burst rates and reaction amplitudes were summarized in Table II. The rates of the linear phase (data not shown) were between 0.1 and 0.2 s−1. The lower reaction amplitude observed with the 25/45-mer compared with the previously measured value using freshly prepared RT (16Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12459-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) indicates that enzyme lost about 20% activity with storage. However, this does not affect the overall kinetic analyses since we used the same pool of RT in all experiments presented in this paper, and we compared relative amplitudes.Table IIKinetic constants and binding affinity of wild-type HIV-1 RTSubstrate2-aThe substrates corresponding to strong pause sites are in bold type.Fast rateAmplitude (fast phase)Slow rateAmplitude (slow phase)Dissociation rateK d (overall)s−1%s−1%s−1nm20/66-mer33 ± 144.7 ± 0.90.18 ± 0.0216 ± 132/66-mer10 ± 34.1 ± 0.30.015 ± 0.00237 ± 40.29 ± 0.0586 ± 835/66-mer15 ± 39.4 ± 0.60.042 ± 0.00529 ± 20.25 ± 0.0669 ± 936/66-mer19 ± 57.8 ± 0.50.067 ± 0.00914 ± 10.17 ± 0.0146 ± 537/66-mer87 ± 1932.4 ± 0.70.14 ± 0.0333 ± 225/45-mer2-bUsed as a control substrate.53 ± 447.4 ± 0.90.22 ± 0.0424 ± 42-a The substrates corresponding to strong pause sites are in bold type.2-b Used as a control substrate. Open table in a new tab The time courses of single nucleotide incorporation into 32/66-mer, 35/66-mer, and 36/66-mer fit poorly to the burst equation and yielded small burst amplitudes (4–10%) and high rates in the linear phase (0.6–0.9 s−1). The fast linear phase could indicate that DNA dissociates from the enzyme more rapidly at the pause sites than at non-pause sites. To test this hypothesis, we directly measured the dissociation rate of RT·36/66-mer (Fig. 6). A molar excess of RT (350 nm) was preincubated with unlabeled 36/66-mer (50 nm) in RT-Mg2+ buffer in order for most of the 36/66-mer to be bound by RT. The RT:36/66-mer solution was then mixed with 5′-32P-labeled 25/45-mer (450 nm) in RT-Mg2+ buffer and incubated for 85 ms to 40 s. During incubation, free enzyme (both initially free enzyme and enzyme dissociated from 36/66-mer) was bound by the excess labeled 25/45-mer rather than the free 36/66-mer. Following incubation, a solution of Mg2+·dATP was added to initiate incorporation of dATP into 25/45-mer. Then the reaction was stopped with 0.3 mEDTA after a constant interval of 250 ms, sufficient to allow all RT·25/45-mer to be converted to RT·26/45-mer in a single turnover. By following nucleotide incorporation into 25/45-mer rather than 36/66-mer, we avoided the complication of a slow turnover of non-productively bound 36/66-mer (see below). The time course of 26/45-mer formation was fitted into a single exponential (see Experimental Procedures) to yield a dissociation rate of 0.17 s−1 for RT·36/66-mer. Similar experiments were performed to measure dissociation rates of other DNA substrates, and the results were summarized in Table II. The dissociation rates of 20/66-mer, 37/66-mer, and 25/45-mer agree with the rates of the linear phase obtained from the burst experiments and with the previously measured rate of 0.18 s−1 (22Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that the method we used can properly measure DNA dissociation rate with accuracy. However, the dissociation rates of 32/66-mer, 35/66-mer, and 36/66-mer are not only similar to DNA dissociation rates at these non-pause sites but also 2–3-fold slower than the rates of linear phase measured in the burst experiments. These suggest that the high rates of the slow phase observed at pause sites (0.6–0.9 s−1) are not due to fast DNA dissociation. Rather, since only a small amount of DNA (4–10%) at each pause site was turned over to products in the fast phase, we speculated that other DNA molecules could be bound non-productively and somehow were slowly converted to productively bound substrates and then converted to products, contributing to the slow phase. To test this hypothesis, we performed a trap experiment for incorporation of dCTP into RT·36/66-mer. A preincubated solution of RT and 5′-32P-labeled 36/66-mer in RT-Mg2+buffer was mixed with a solution of Mg2+·dATP and a large molar excess of unlabeled 25/45-mer to start polymerization. The unlabeled 25/45-mer served as a trap for free RT to prevent rebinding of dissociated 36/66-mer. At increasing times, the polymerization was stopped by 0.3 m EDTA, and products were analyzed on a sequencing gel. The data (Fig. 7) were fitted to a double exponential equation and yielded a rate of 19 s−1 and 7.8% reaction amplitude for the fast phase and a rate of 0.067 s−1 and 14% reaction amplitude for the slow phase. Similar experiments were performed with 32/66-mer and 35/66-mer, and the results were summarized in Table II. The observed biphasic kinetics at all pause sites confirmed our hypothesis that DNA substrates were bound by enzyme both productively and non-productively at the polymerase site of RT. Productively bound substrates were more rapidly converted to products than non-productively bound substrates. Since we only measured a single enzyme binding event, DNA substrates bound in both states did not dissociate from enzyme before being converted to products. Interestingly, only the fast phase of nucleotide incorporation was observed when the same experiments w"

The steady state k cat for the dTTPase activity was 200–300-fold lower in the absence of MgCl2, but theK m was only slightly affected. Direct dTTP binding experiments showed that the K d of dTTP was unaffected, but the stoichiometry of dTTP binding was different in the absence of Mg2+. Two dTTPs were found to bind tightly in the absence of Mg2+ in contrast to three to four in the presence of Mg2+. In the presence of DNA there was little difference in the stoichiometry of dTTP binding to 4A′. These results indicate that Mg2+ is not necessary for dTTP binding, but Mg2+ is required for optimal hydrolysis of dTTP. Gel filtration of 4A′ in the presence of dTTP without Mg2+showed that Mg2+ was not necessary, and dTTP was sufficient for hexamer formation. The hexamers formed in the presence of dTTP without Mg2+ were capable of binding single-stranded DNA. However, the 4A′ hexamers formed in the presence of dTDP with or without Mg2+ did not bind DNA, indicating that hexamer formation itself is not sufficient for DNA binding. The hexamers need to be in the correct conformation, in this case in the dTTP-bound state, to interact with the DNA. Thus, the γ-phosphate of dTTP plays an important role in causing a conformational change in the protein that leads to stable interactions of 4A′ with the DNA.

Helicases are motor proteins that translocate on DNA and catalyze separation of the double-stranded DNA into single-stranded DNAs. The ssDNA1 regions generated by the action of helicases serve as templates during DNA replication and repair and as intermediates in various processes of DNA metabolism (1Lohman T.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 2Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2269-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu.

The strand separation activity of helicases requires hydrolysis of NTP, and the NTPase activity in helicases, as in other motor proteins, plays a central role in the enzymatic process that leads to translocation and DNA unwinding. Studies of T7 DNA helicase and other helicases such asEscherichia coli Rep and E. coli DnaB have shown that the type of nucleotide bound to the helicase, NTPversus NDP, influences its affinity for the DNA (5Hingorani M.M.

Therefore, NTP binding and hydrolysis steps must act as switches that allow binding and release of DNA from the protein, and these steps are necessary for translocation. In the hexameric class of helicases, the MgNTP binding is also necessary for protein oligomerization (8Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S.

The studies in this report are directed toward understanding the roles of Mg2+ and NTP in hexamer formation and DNA binding. To understand the role of Mg2+, we have studied dTTP hydrolysis, dTTP binding, hexamer formation, and DNA binding in 4A′ in the absence of added Mg2+ and in the presence of EDTA, which chelates contaminating metal ions. Our results showed that Mg2+ was required for efficient hydrolysis of dTTP into dTDP and Pi. This was not surprising, since MgNTP is believed to be the substrate of most NTPases. Interestingly, Mg2+ was not necessary for dTTP binding, hexamer formation, or DNA binding. Stable 4A′ hexamers were formed in the absence of Mg2+ and in the presence of dTTP, and these hexamers were capable of binding ssDNA. The affinity of the hexamers for the DNA in the absence of Mg2+ was very similar to that observed in the presence of MgdTMPPCP. These studies provide novel insights into the roles of Mg2+ and dTTP in the helicase mechanism. At the same time, they have provided us with conditions to preassemble the helicase hexamer on the DNA. Such preassembly is desirable for detailed biochemical characterization of the dTTPase and unwinding kinetics, since it will allow us to measure the rate of unwinding and hydrolysis that is not limited by protein assembly and DNA binding (21Ahnert P.

The 30-mer was purified on a 16% polyacrylamide gel with 3.2 m urea in Tris-borate-EDTA. The DNA was electroeluted using an Elutrap apparatus from Schleicher & Schuell. The concentration of DNA was determined spectroscopically at 260 nm in Tris-EDTA buffer, 8 m urea, using an extinction coefficient of 305,010 m−1 cm−1. The dTTPase assays were carried out in an 18 °C room. 4A′ protein was mixed with dTTP and [α-32P]dTTP with or without 30-mer DNA in the following reaction buffer: 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 40 mmNaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, with 10 mmMgCl2 or 5 mm EDTA (the concentrations of the enzyme and substrate are given in the figure legends). After various times of incubation, the reactions were quenched with 1 mHCl, treated with chloroform, and neutralized with 1 mNaOH, 0.25 m Tris base. The [α-32P]dTDP was separated from [α-32P]dTTP by polyethyleneimine cellulose TLC using 0.3 m potassium phosphate, pH 3.4, as the running buffer. The radioactivity was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The molar dTDP was plotted as a function of time, and the slope of the plot provided the reaction rate. The experiment was repeated at various concentrations of dTTP, and the rate of each reaction was plotted versus dTTP concentration. The curve was fit to Equation 1 to obtain the K m and k cat values.v=[E]0[S]kcat/(Km+[S])(Eq. 1) where v is the rate of the reaction, [E]0 k cat is the maximal rate, [S] is the concentration of dTTP, and K m is the Michaelis constant. The nitrocellulose (NC) filter binding assay was used to quantitate dTTP binding to 4A′ protein as described previously (8Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2218-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 186s-190sPubMed Google Scholar). The assays were performed at 18 °C using a constant amount of the protein and increasing dTTP. The NC membrane circles (25 mm) were washed with 0.5 m NaOH for 3 min, rinsed with double-distilled water, and equilibrated overnight in membrane wash buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 5 mm NaCl, with either 10 mm MgCl2 or 2 mm EDTA). 4A′ (12 μm) was mixed with dTTP (0–100 μm) and [α-32P]dTTP with or without 30-mer DNA (5 μm) in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, in the presence of either 10 mm MgCl2 or 0.5 mm EDTA in a total volume of 15 μl. The reactions were incubated for 30 s, and 10-μl aliquots were filtered through the NC membrane assembly. The membranes were washed before and after filtration with 0.6 ml of membrane wash buffer. One-microliter aliquots were spotted onto a separate nitrocellulose membrane to measure the total radioactivity. The radioactivity on the membranes was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The results of the nucleotide binding assays were fit to a hyperbola (Equation 2)[ES]=[E]0[S]/(Kd+[S])(Eq. 2) where [ES] is the concentrations of 4A′-dTTP complex, [E]0 is the concentration of 4A′, [S] is the concentration of dTTP, and K d is the dissociation constant. The assembly of 4A′ into hexamers was analyzed in the presence of dTTP (in the absence of Mg2+) using HPLC gel filtration chromatography. The elution buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and the appropriate concentration of dTTP (0–250 μm). Protein samples (10 μl) were prepared by mixing 4A′ (3.6 μm) with the desired concentration of dTTP (0–250 μm) in the presence or absence of 30-mer DNA (3.6 μm). The 4A′ hexamer was resolved from the monomer or dimer species at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min using a 30-cm HPLC gel-filtration column (Bio-Silect SEC 400–5, Bio-Rad) that was preequilibrated in the elution buffer. Chromatography was performed on a Waters model 625 LC system, and proteins were detected using a Waters 470 scanning fluorescence detector (λexcitation = 280 nm and λemission = 340 nm). The fraction of hexamers was plotted against the concentration of free dTTP, and the data were fit to the Hill equation (Equation 3) to obtain the apparent equilibrium constant for hexamer formation.YL=[L]n/(Kd+[L]n)(Eq. 3) where Y L is the fractional saturation, [L] is the concentration of free dTTP,K d is the apparent dissociation constant for the hexamer, and n is the Hill coefficient. The DNA binding assay was carried out as described previously (5Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12478-12487Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The 30-mer DNA was radiolabeled with 32Pi at the 5′-end using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Excess [γ-32P]ATP was removed by Bio-Gel P-30 spin gel filtration. The NC and DEAE membranes were washed with 0.5m NaOH for 10 min, rinsed with double-distilled water, and equilibrated with the membrane wash buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 5 mm NaCl, and either 10 mmMgCl2 or 2 mm EDTA) for at least 1 h at room temperature. The assays were performed at constant DNA (1 μm) and increasing 4A′ (0–20 μm) concentration in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 or 0.5 mm EDTA. Experiments were carried out under the following conditions: (a) in the presence of dTMPPCP (1 mm) and Mg2+ (10 mm); (b) in the presence of dTTP (1 mm) and Mg2+ (10 mm); (c) in the presence of dTTP (1 mm) and EDTA (0.5 mm). The reactions were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature before the samples were filtered through the membrane assembly. The membranes were washed, before and after filtration of samples, with 60 μl of membrane wash buffer (above). After the samples were filtered, radioactivity on both NC and DEAE filters was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To investigate the role of Mg2+ and dTTP in hexamer formation, hydrolysis, and DNA binding by T7 4A′ protein, we have characterized the activities of 4A′ protein both in the presence and absence of Mg2+. The studies in the absence of Mg2+ were carried out in the presence of EDTA, which serves to chelate the contaminating metal ions in the reaction mixture. To determine the optimal amount of EDTA for use in the Mg2+-free experiments, the dTTP hydrolysis rate was measured at increasing concentrations of EDTA in the reaction. We found that, as the concentration of EDTA was increased from 0.5 μm to 20 mm, the rate of dTTP hydrolysis decreased and was saturated by 0.5–1 mm EDTA (data not shown). These results indicate that the reaction mixture without EDTA contained contaminating Mg2+ or other divalent cations that were able to partially activate the dTTPase activity of 4A′. To chelate the free Mg2+ ions in the reaction mixture, we included 0.5–5 mm EDTA in all the reactions. To investigate the role of Mg2+ in the 4A′-catalyzed dTTP hydrolysis reaction, we measured the dTTPase activity in the absence of Mg2+. Our results showed that 4A′ was able to hydrolyze dTTP at a reduced rate in the absence of Mg2+. To further investigate this dTTPase activity, we determined the steady-state K m and k cat values of dTTPase in the absence and presence of DNA, with and without Mg2+ (see Fig. 1 A–D). The measuredk cat and K m values are reported in Table I. In the absence of DNA and Mg2+, the k cat for dTTP hydrolysis was reduced 300-fold relative to the rate in the presence of Mg2+. The difference in the K m values of dTTPase in the absence and presence of Mg2+ was relatively small. The K m increased by only 2-fold in the absence of Mg2+. In the presence of 30-mer ssDNA, we also observed a large change in the k cat and a small change in the K m value in reactions without Mg2+. The dTTPase k cat decreased about 200-fold from the DNA-stimulated rate in the presence of Mg2+ and the K m value decreased about 2-fold in the absence of Mg2+.Table ISteady state dTTPase kcat and Km valuesNo DNA30-mer ssDNAk catK mk catK mmoldTTP hydrolyzed/s · mol4A′ monomerμmmoldTTP hydrolyzed/s · mol4A′ monomerμm10 mm Mg2+0.053 ± 0.0039.4 ± 1.60.28 ± 0.02052.6 ± 10.0No Mg2+1.7 ± 0.07 × 10−418.8 ± 1.91.2 ± 0.02 × 10−332.2 ± 10.2 Open table in a new tab The equilibrium binding of dTTP to 4A′ protein was measured both to determine the number of dTTPs that bind 4A′ and their affinity in the absence of Mg2+. Fig. 2 A shows that in the presence of 10 mm Mg2+, 4A′ protein bound 3–4 dTTPs per hexamer, consistent with our previous results (8Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2218-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 186s-190sPubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of Mg2+, 4A′ bound only 2 dTTPs per hexamer. TheK d for the bound nucleotides was very close to that in the presence of Mg2+ (11 ± 2 μm with Mg2+ and 9 ± 1 μm without Mg2+). The binding of dTTP was also investigated in the presence of 30-mer ssDNA. In the presence of 10 mmMg2+, 4A′ bound 3–4 dTTPs per hexamer (Fig. 2 B), and the same number of dTTPs were bound in the presence of DNA without Mg2+. The affinity of the dTTPs was about 2-fold weaker when Mg2+ was removed (35 ± 6 μm without Mg2+ and 13 ± 2 μm with Mg2+ in the presence of DNA). Together, the above results indicate that Mg2+ is necessary for dTTP hydrolysis, but the absence of Mg2+ does not impair dTTP binding to 4A′ to a significant extent. The 4A′ protein assembles into stable hexamers in the presence of MgdTMPPCP and MgdTTP (14Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10668-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Egelman E.H., Yu, X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Since the above dTTP binding results show that Mg2+ is not necessary for dTTP binding, we asked whether dTTP binding was sufficient, and hence Mg2+ was not necessary for hexamer formation. We used HPLC gel filtration to monitor hexamer formation in 4A′ protein. The gel filtration experiments were performed by incubating 4A′ protein with increasing concentrations of dTTP in the presence of EDTA. The samples were applied to the gel filtration column eluted with a buffer containing the same amount of dTTP and EDTA. Fig. 3 A shows the gel filtration profiles of 4A′ protein in the presence of various concentrations of dTTP. The gel filtration profiles show that 4A′ was capable of forming stable hexamers in the absence of Mg2+, and the formation of hexamers was dependent on the concentration of dTTP. Thus, 4A′ monomer or dimer species were converted to the hexamer species as the concentration of dTTP was increased. The dTTP dependence of the hexamer peak area was sigmoidal as expected for a ligand-linked oligomerization process (Fig. 3 B). The data were fit to the Hill equation with an apparent K d of 38 μm for dTTP-dependent hexamer formation and a Hill coefficient of 1.5. The gel filtration experiments were also carried out in the presence of 30-mer ssDNA (Fig. 3 C). The dTTP-dependent hexamer formation occurred with a tighterK d in the presence of DNA. The apparentK d for dTTP-dependent hexamer formation in the presence of DNA was 7 μm and the Hill coefficient was 2.5 (Fig. 3 D). These results show that Mg2+is not necessary for hexamer formation in 4A′ helicase, and dTTP binding is sufficient for formation and stabilization of the hexamer. We have shown earlier that 4A′ hexamer binds DNA with a high affinity only in the presence of MgdTMPPCP, the nonhydrolyzable analog of dTTP, and the interactions with the DNA are weak in the presence of MgdTDP (5Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12478-12487Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the dTTP-bound form of 4A′ may interact more tightly with the DNA. However, dTTP hydrolysis in the presence of Mg2+ is fast, thus we were unable to test this idea. Now we have conditions under which dTTP can be bound to 4A′ without extensive hydrolysis, and hence we are able to test DNA binding in the presence of dTTP instead of dTMPPCP. The binding of DNA was measured in a quantitative manner using the NC-DEAE filter binding assay. The experiment was carried out using a constant concentration of radiolabeled 30-mer DNA, which was titrated with increasing concentration of the 4A′ protein. Experiments were carried out in the presence of various ligands such as MgdTMPPCP, MgdTTP, and dTTP with EDTA. The positive control (dTMPPCP and Mg2+) showed tight binding of DNA with a stoichiometry of one 30-mer DNA per hexamer (Fig. 4). Very little DNA binding was observed in the presence of dTTP and Mg2+. This is because the protein translocates and falls off from the 30-mer DNA when dTTP is being continuously hydrolyzed to dTDP in the presence of Mg2+. Interestingly, tight binding of DNA to the 4A′ hexamer was observed in the presence of dTTP without Mg2+. The stoichiometry of DNA binding was very similar to that observed in the presence of MgdTMPPCP, one DNA per 4A′ hexamer. The MgdTTP serves as the energy source for unidirectional translocation of 4A′ helicase on the DNA during DNA unwinding. Here we have studied the properties of 4A′ protein in the presence and absence of Mg2+ to dissect the roles of Mg2+ and dTTP. The studies described in this report show that the presence of Mg2+ is necessary for maximally activating the intrinsic as well as the DNA-stimulated dTTPase activity of 4A′ protein. The presence of Mg2+ is also necessary for the helicase activity (21Ahnert P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32267-32273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We have shown that dTTP binding is not greatly affected in the absence of Mg2+, thus the lack of helicase activity in the absence of Mg2+ must be due to the 200-fold slower dTTPase rate of 4A′ in the absence of Mg2+. The reducedk cat but an almost unchangedK m of dTTPase suggests that the major role of Mg2+ is in stabilization of the transition state of the dTTPase reaction. Mg2+ plays a minor role in dTTP binding in the ground state. The exact mechanism of dTTP hydrolysis in helicases is not known, but it is likely to be similar to the mechanism of small GTPases that have been extensively studied. In these enzymes, it is believed that the water molecule that serves as the nucleophile is either activated by protein active site residues (23Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 24Tong L. deVos A.M. Milburn M.V. Kim S. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), or the γ-phosphate of the NTP may itself serve to activate the water molecule (25Schweins T. Langden R. Warshel A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 26Schweins T. Geyer M. Scheffzek K. Warshel A. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 35-44Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of Mg2+ is most likely in neutralizing the negative charges that develop during the reaction. Our results also show that DNA binding by itself can activate the dTTPase activity about 10-fold in the absence of Mg2+. The structures of E. coli Rep helicase and hepatitis C virus helicase show that the DNA binding site is close to the NTP binding site (27Korolev S. Hsieh J. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 28Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the DNA activates the dTTPase by a direct mechanism. Alternatively, the DNA may cause changes in the conformation of the protein active site residues that lead to stabilization of the dTTPase transition state. dTTP binding in the absence of Mg2+ showed that only two dTTPs were bound to 4A′. Since the nitrocellulose filter-binding assay detects sites that have high affinity, we cannot rule out the possibility that other sites are occupied in the absence of Mg2+. We can, however, conclude that only two sites are tightly bound in the absence of Mg2+ as compared with three to four tight binding sites in the presence of Mg2+. The presence of DNA restored the binding of one or two dTTPs to 4A′. The dTTP binding in the presence of DNA was therefore the same with or without Mg2+. We have shown previously that 4A′ has two kinds of dTTP binding sites (29Hingorani M.M. Washington M.T. Moore K.C. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5012-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Approximately half of the dTTP binding sites on the hexamer appear to be noncatalytic. The dTTPs bound at the noncatalytic sites do not turn over very rapidly and hence these dTTPs are most likely not involved in providing the energy for translocation and DNA unwinding. Future studies are directed toward determining whether the dTTPs that are bound in the absence of Mg2+ are at the catalytic sites or the noncatalytic sites. The 4A′ protein was found to assemble into stable hexamers even in the absence of Mg2+. Thus, Mg2+ is not necessary, and dTTP or dTDP binding is sufficient, for hexamer formation. Since no high resolution structural information of hexameric helicases is available at the present time, it is not known exactly where dTTP binds with respect to the hexamer subunits and how it promotes hexamer formation. There is, however, considerable evidence that the structure of hexameric helicases may be similar to the F1-ATPase enzyme, which is hexameric (27Korolev S. Hsieh J. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 30Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

Nature. 1996; 384: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In the F1-ATPase, it is known that ATP molecules bind near the α, β subunit interface (30Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2762) Google Scholar), which may be the case with the hexameric helicases as well. That is, NTP may be bound at the subunit interface. The binding of dTTP at the interface provides a simple mechanism by which it can stabilize hexamer formation. We show here that Mg2+ is not necessary for hexamer formation. This behavior of 4A′ is different from that of E. coli DnaB helicase that was shown to form hexamers in the presence of Mg2+ alone (34Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Jezewska M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31350-31358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since we have not been able to detect stable hexamers of 4A′ protein in the presence of Mg2+ alone (data not shown), we believe that nucleotide binding, either dTTP or dTDP, is necessary for stable hexamer formation. Our studies show that the γ-phosphate plays a very important role in regulating the interactions of the helicase with the DNA. Previous studies have shown that 4A′ helicase interacts tightly with the DNA in the presence of MgdTMPPCP, and very little DNA binding was observed in the presence of MgdTDP (5Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12478-12487Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We were not sure if dTMPPCP was a good analog of dTTP because the bond lengths and the bond angle of P-C-P are different from those of P-O-P. It is possible that the structure of the dTMPPCP-bound 4A′ is different from the dTTP-bound form, and the dTMPPCP-bound form resembles an intermediate in the dTTPase reaction pathway that has strong interactions with the DNA. Part of the reason for believing this was because weak DNA binding was observed in the presence of MgdTTP. Now we are able to observe tight binding of DNA in the presence of dTTP without Mg2+, conditions under which dTTP hydrolysis is very slow and hence translocation and dissociation of 4A′ from the DNA is slow. These results indicate that the dTTP-bound form of 4A′ does interact tightly with the DNA. We can also conclude that hexamer formation is not sufficient for DNA binding, since no DNA binding was observed in the presence of dTDP, although stable hexamers were formed in the presence of MgdTDP (8Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2218-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and dTDP (data not shown). It appears that the γ-phosphate of dTTP may be involved in causing a critical conformational change in the protein that “opens up” the DNA binding site on a 4A′ subunit. We can infer that the hydrolysis of dTTP or the dissociation of Pi leads to dissociation of the DNA. These steps provide the switch mechanism that allows the helicase subunit to switch from a tight DNA binding state to a weak one. Since the DNA predominately interacts with one or two subunits (20Yu X. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Egelman E.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the resulting DNA binding and release steps can occur in a sequential manner among the hexamer subunits, providing a mechanism for processive translocation of the helicase on the DNA. Finally, the findings from this study are likely to be general for helicases that assemble into hexamers in the presence of MgNTP (8Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S.

This study has provided us with conditions where a complex of hexamer bound to the DNA can be preformed without extensive dTTP hydrolysis occurring in the complex. This is the first time that we have been able to form such a complex. The ability to preform this complex will allow us to examine the presteady state kinetics of the DNA-stimulated dTTP hydrolysis reaction, and the kinetics of DNA unwinding at a replication fork, without complications from oligomerization and/or DNA binding processes.

Todd Washington for carefully reviewing the manuscript during preparation, and the members of the Patel laboratory for helpful discussions."

In 1G5, a Jurkat-derived T cell line stably transfected with a luciferase gene driven by HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), we found that PGE2 markedly enhanced HIV-1 LTR-mediated reporter gene activity. Experiments have been conducted to identify second messengers involved in this PGE2-dependent up-regulating effect on the regulatory element of HIV-1. In this study, we present evidence indicating that signal transduction pathways induced by PGE2 necessitate the participation of cyclic AMP, protein kinase A, and Ca2+. Experiments conducted with different HIV-1 LTR-based vectors suggested that PGE2-mediated activation effect on HIV-1 transcription was transduced via both NF-κB-dependent and -independent signaling pathways. The involvement of NF-κB in the PGE2-dependent activating effect on HIV-1 transcription was further confirmed using a κB-regulated luciferase encoding vector and by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Results from Northern blot and flow cytometric analyses, as well as the use of a selective antagonist indicated that PGE2 modulation of HIV-1 LTR-driven reporter gene activity in studied T lymphoid cells is transduced via the EP4receptor subtype.

This infection is influenced by a complex interplay between viral and host factors, as well as by microbial agents termed cofactors. It has been postulated that such cofactors may be important in disease progression by enhancing cell-to-cell transmission or through up-regulation of HIV-1 expression in latently infected cells (2Margolick J.B. Volkman D.J. Folks T.M. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1719-1723PubMed Google Scholar). Mycoplasma (3Chowdhury M.I.H. Koyanagi Y. Kobayashi N. Yamamoto N. Munakata T. Arai S.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 2881-2888PubMed Google Scholar) may act as cofactors for the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection either by directly modulating virus replication or by inducing a more profound immunosuppressive state. During coinfections, the inability of the host to develop an effective immune response may involve the participation of the immunosuppressive molecule PGE2, an oxygenated polyunsaturated fatty acid that contain a cyclopentane ring structure. PGE2 are molecules that have been shown to modulate the immune response both in vitro and in vivo (9Goodwin J.S. Webb D.R. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1980; 15: 106-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar,10Goodwin J.S. Ceuppens J. J. Clin. Immunol. 1983; 3: 295-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Macrophages, follicular dendritic cells, fibroblasts, and vascular endothelial cells synthesize PGE2, while lymphocytes do not secrete this major product of arachidonic acid metabolism (11Kurland J.I.

A marked increase in PGE2 production is generated in response to a variety of immunological stimuli including interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), antigen-antibody complexes, and lipopolysaccharide (15Phipps R.P. Roper R.L. Stein S.H. Immunol. Rev. 1991; 117: 135-158Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, production of PGE2 has been shown to be induced by infection with several pathogens such asLeishmania donovani (16Reiner N.E. Malemud C.J.

Immunol. 1988; 18: 1791-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). PGE2 shifts the balance of the cellular immune response away from T-helper type 1 (Th1) favoring a Th2 response which drives humoral responses toward the production of IgE (36Fedyk E.R. Phipps R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10978-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, more recent findings have depicted PGE2 as a pleiotropic molecule that can act both negatively or positively on the immune system (15Phipps R.P. Roper R.L. Stein S.H. Immunol. Rev. 1991; 117: 135-158Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An overproduction of PGE2 (as high as 10−4m) is seen in a number of disorders (e.g.allergy, hyper-IgE syndrome, Hodgkin lymphoma, trauma, sepsis, and transplantation), most of which are characterized by elevated Th2 and IgE responses (15Phipps R.P. Roper R.L. Stein S.H. Immunol. Rev. 1991; 117: 135-158Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 36Fedyk E.R. Phipps R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Good R.A. Day N.K. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 595-603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). As specified above, elevated levels of PGE2 have also been reported in individuals infected with HIV-1 (27Abel P.M. McSharry C. Galloway E. Ross C. Severn A. Toner G. Gruer L. Wilkinson P.C. FEMS Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 5: 317-323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Foley P. Kazazi F. Biti R. Sorrell T.C. Cunningham A.L. Immunology. 1992; 75: 391-397PubMed Google Scholar, 29Griffin D.E. Wesselingh S.L. McArthur J.C. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 35: 592-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 30Ramis I. Rosello-Catafau J. Gelpi E. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 575: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and it has been postulated that this may contribute to the immunosuppressive state seen in such virally-infected patients (39Hui R. Curtis J.F. Sumner M.T. Shears S.B. Glasgow W.C. Eling T.E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 8020-8026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) responsible for the enhanced prostaglandin formation is still undefined. The initial contact between the virus particle and its target cell might represent the crucial step leading to the production of PGE2 by macrophages. This concept is supported by the finding that a significant production of endogenous PGE2 is induced (20- to 40-fold increase) following incubation of primary human monocytes with the HIV-1 external envelope glycoprotein gp120 (40Wahl L.M. Corcoran M.L. Pyle S.W. Arthur L.O. Harel-Bellan A. Farrar W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, in sharp contrast with this report, a previous study has demonstrated that interaction between gp120 and THP-1, a human monocytoid cell line, does not increase exogenous production of PGE2 (39Hui R. Curtis J.F. Sumner M.T. Shears S.B. Glasgow W.C. Eling T.E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 8020-8026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to specify that, unlike monocyte/macrophages, promonocytoid THP-1 cells are not at a terminal stage of differentiation. In addition, a monomer form of gp120 was used in this study which might not parallel physiological conditions where gp120 is under a multimeric form (41Pinter A. Honnen W.J. Tilley S.A. Bona C. Zaghouani H. Gorny M.K. Zolla-Pazner S. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2674-2679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Depending on the cell type, binding of PGE2 to one of its six different described receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3I, EP3II, EP3III, and EP4) can lead to activation of phospholipase C, phosphatidylinositol turnover, activation of adenylate cyclase via cholera toxin-sensitive GαS proteins and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ (42Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar). Given that HIV-1 is highly dependent on intracellular signaling machinery for its life cycle, it is therefore possible that interaction of PGE2 with its surface receptor(s) can modulate virus replication. A previous cellular study supports this postulate since PGE2 was found to enhance HIV-1 replication in acutely infected T lymphoid cells (43Kuno S. Ueno R. Hayaishi O. Nakashima H. Harada S. Yamamoto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3487-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The primary goal of the present work was thus to investigate the putative modulatory role of PGE2 on the regulatory elements of HIV-1 (LTR) at both biochemical and molecular levels. For this purpose, we treated human T lymphoid cells stably and transiently transfected with different HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase reporter gene vectors with concentrations of PGE2 known to be found under physiological conditions. We then explored the intracellular second messengers participating in PGE2-mediated signaling transduction pathway(s) and investigated DNA-binding transcriptional factor(s) and cell surface receptor(s) implicated in the PGE2-dependent effect on HIV-1 transcription. PGE2, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), phytohemagglutinin (PHA), indomethacin and dibutyryl-cAMP were purchased from Sigma. H7 was purchased from Seikagaku America Inc. (Tampa, FL). BAPTA/AM, IBMX, MDL-12,330A, and HA-1004 were purchased from BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The calcium inhibitor CAI was a generous gift from Dr. E. C. Kohn (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). AH 23848B was kindly provided by Dr. S. G. Lister (Glaxo Wellcome, United Kingdom). Trizol came from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Stock solutions of PGE2 (1 mm) were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized product into absolute ethanol and were stored at −20 °C until needed. The parental lymphoid T cell line, Jurkat E6.1, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD), while 1G5 was supplied by the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institute of Health (Rockville, MD). 1G5 is a clonal cell line derived from Jurkat E6.1 cells which has been stably transfected with a luciferase gene driven by the HIV-1 LTR (44Aguilar-Cordova E. Chinen J. Donehower L. Lewis D.E. Belmont J.W. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.22% NaHCO3, and were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. In our studies, we have used pLTR-LUC and pmκBLTR-LUC that have been kindly provided by Dr. K. Calame (Columbia University, NY). These molecular constructs contain the luciferase reporter gene under the control of wild-type (GGGACTTTCC) or NF-κB-mutated (CTCACTTTCC) HIV-1HXB2 LTR (−453 to +80) (45Henderson A.J. Zou X. Calame K.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5337-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also used the pκB-TATA-LUC vector which contains the minimal HIV-1 κB region and a TATA box placed upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (46Sun S.C. Elwood J. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid is a generous gift from Dr. W. C. Greene (The J. Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA). The molecular construct pNF-κB-LUC contains five (5Harada S. Koyokani Y. Yamamoto N. Science. 1985; 229: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar) consensus sequences of NF-κB-binding sites placed in front of the luciferase reporter gene (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). NFAT-LUC contains the IL-2 minimal promoter with three tandem copies of NFAT-binding site placed upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (kindly provided by Dr. G. R. Crabtree, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, CA). Northern blot analyses were performed using human EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4subtypes cDNA fragments. The cDNAs for human prostanoid receptor EP1 (1.3 kilobases), EP3 (1.8 kilobases), and EP4 (1.5 kilobases) were kind gifts from Dr. M. Abramovitz (Merck Frost, Qué, Canada). The cDNA for hEP2 (1.1 kilobases) was generously provided by Dr. K. M. Kedzie (Allergan, Irvine, CA). The polyclonal antibody specific for EP4 was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). This rabbit serum is directed against a synthetic peptide from the human EP4 receptor. In order to assess whether PGE2 could modulate HIV-1 LTR activity, 1G5 cells (5 × 105) were either left untreated or treated with PHA (3 μg/ml), anti-CD3 antibody (clone OKT3 at 1 μg/ml), PMA (20 ng/ml), and TNF-α (2 ng/ml: R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) in a final volume of 200 μl for 1 h at 37 °C. Next, the cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nm PGE2 for 24 h at 37 °C. Dose-response experiments were done using a similar number of cells, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), and resuspended in 1 ml of fresh complete culture medium before incubation for 24 h at 37 °C with PGE2 at final concentrations of 1, 10, 100, and 1000 nm. Kinetic experiments were done by incubating 1G5 cells with 100 nm PGE2 for 2, 6, 8, and 24 h. In some experiments, 1G5 cells were pretreated for 1 h at 37 °C with second messenger inhibitors such as H7, HA-1004, BAPTA/AM, indomethacin, MDL-12,330A, and IBMX at subcytotoxic and subcytostatic concentrations prior to treatment with 100 nm PGE2 for 8 h at 37 °C. The inhibitor CAI requires a pretreatment of at least 8 h for optimum inhibition and shows no acute interference with the growth properties of the cells (47Yasui H. Butscher W. Cohen M. Spriggs N. Wersto R. Kohn E.C. Liotta L. Gardner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28762-28770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed three times and luciferase activity was evaluated for each quadruplicate samples by a modified version of a previously published procedure (48Bérubé P. Barbeau B. Cantin R. Sékaly R.-P. Tremblay M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4009-4016Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, following the incubation period, 100 μl of cell-free supernatant were withdrawn from each well and 25 μl of cell culture lysis buffer (25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) were added before incubation at room temperature for 30 min. An aliquot of cell extract (20 μl) was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay buffer (20 mmTricine, 1.07 mm(MgCO3)4·Mg(OH)2·5H2O, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 270 μm coenzyme A, 470 μm luciferin, 530 μm ATP, and 33.3 mm dithiothreitol) and the sample was read in the counting chamber of a standard liquid scintillation counter equipped with a single-photon monitor software (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Total photo-events were measured over a 30-s time lapse. Jurkat E6.1 (5 to 10 × 106) were first washed once in a TS buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm KCl, 0.6 mm NaHPO4, 0.5 mmMgCl2, and 0.7 mm CaCl2) and resuspended in 0.5–1 ml of TS containing 10–20 μg of the indicated plasmids and 500 μg/ml DEAE-dextran (final concentration). The cells/TS/plasmid/DEAE-dextran mixture was incubated for 25 min at room temperature. Thereafter, cells were diluted at a concentration of 1 × 106 per ml using complete culture medium supplemented with 100 μm chloroquine (Sigma). After 45 min of incubation at 37 °C, cells were centrifuged, washed once, resuspended in complete culture medium, and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. To minimize variations in plasmid transfection efficiencies, transfected cells were pooled 24 h after transfection and were next separated into various treatment groups as follow. Transiently transfected cells were seeded at a density of 105 cells per well (100 μl) in 96-well flat-bottom plates. Cells were left untreated or were treated with TNF-α (2 ng/ml), PHA/PMA (3 μg/ml and 20 ng/ml, respectively), and 100 nm PGE2 in a final volume of 200 μl for a period of 8 h at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed and luciferase activity was assessed as described above. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (49Barbeau B. Bernier R. Dumais N. Briand G. Olivier M. Faure R. Posner B.I. Tremblay M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12968-12977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In brief, 1G5 cells (106) were either left untreated or were treated with PGE2 (100 nm) or TNF-α (2 ng/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. The incubation of cells with the stimulating agents was terminated by the addition of ice-cold PBS and nuclear extracts were prepared according to the microscale preparation protocol (50Andrews N.C. Faller C.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 19: 2499-2500Crossref Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Sedimented cells were resuspended in 400 μl of cold buffer A (10 nm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 nm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 10 min on ice, the lysate was vortexed for 10 s and the samples were centrifuged for 10 s at 12,000 × g. The supernatant fraction was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of cold buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 2 min at 4 °C and the supernatant fractions were stored at −70 °C until used. Ten micrograms of nuclear extracts were used to perform electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Protein content was determined by the commercial BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce, Rockfold, IL). Nuclear extracts were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 15 μl of buffer of a binding solution (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 40% glycerol, 10% Ficoll, 250 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmEDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 μg of nuclease-free bovine serum albumin fraction V) containing 1 ng of32P-5′-end-labeled double-stranded (dsDNA) oligonucleotide. Double-stranded DNA (100 ng) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase in a kinase buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). This mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and the reaction was stopped with 5 μl of 0.2m EDTA. The labeled oligonucleotide was extracted with phenol/chloroform and passed trough a G-50 spin column. The double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide, which was used as a probe, contained the consensus NF-κB-binding site corresponding to the sequence 5′-ATGTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ and was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, Ca). DNA·NF-κB complexes were resolved from free labeled DNA by electrophoresis in native 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 200 nm glycine, and 1 mm EDTA. The gel was subsequently dried and autoradiographed. Total RNA was extracted by the Trizol method (51Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63225) Google Scholar, 52Chomczynski P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 532-536PubMed Google Scholar) from 1G5 and Jurkat E6.1 cells. Fifteen micrograms of total RNA were separated on formaldehyde-agarose gel (1% agarose, 1 × formaldehyde gel buffer MOPS, pH 7.0, 40 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm EDTA, 2.2 mformaldehyde). RNA was transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham) by capillary action using 10 × SSC (3 mNaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate). RNA was fixed to the membrane by UV exposure and hybridized with radiolabeled probes for the EP receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4) at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured fragmented salmon sperm DNA. Blots were washed and autoradiographed at −70 °C. Cell surface expression of hEP4receptor was evaluated by flow cytometry as follow. Cell lines 1G5 and Jurkat E6.1 (5 × 105) were washed once in PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum (PBS pH 7.4 + 2% fetal bovine serum (PBSA)). Cells were then resuspended in 100 μl of PBSA to which was added 0.5 μg of polyclonal rabbit anti-hEP4 antibody, vortexed gently, and incubated for 30 min on ice. Cells were subsequently washed with PBSA and resuspended in 100 μl of PBSA containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled chicken anti-rabbit IgG antibody (0.5 μg total) and further incubated for 30 min on ice. Cells were finally centrifuged and resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS before being analyzed by flow cytometry (EPICS XL, Coulter Corp., Miami, FL). Assays with AH 23848B were performed by incubating 1G5 cells with 30 μm AH 23848B for 1 h at 37 °C (53Nishigaki N. Negishi M. Honda A. Sugimoto Y. Namba T. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). After this pretreatment, cells were incubated with 100 nmPGE2 for 8 h at 37 °C. Experiments were performed three times and luciferase activity was monitored as described above. In order to assess whether PGE2could affect the regulatory elements of HIV-1, we initially set out a dose-response experiment which was performed with PGE2 in a 24-h incubation period. The results showed a steady increase of HIV-1 LTR activity in 1G5 cells starting at as little as 1 nmconcentration of PGE2 (Fig. 1A). In these experiments, PGE2 was reconstituted in absolute ethanol to get a stock solution of 1 mm which was serially diluted in complete culture medium to get our working dilutions (1, 10, 100, and 1000 nm). Incubation of 1G5 cells with the concentration of ethanol corresponding to the one used with 1000 nmPGE2 resulted in a 1.5-fold increase of HIV-1 LTR dependent activity, while no effect was seen with the equivalent ethanol concentration for 100 nm PGE2 (data not shown). Therefore, subsequent experiments were carried out using 100 nm PGE2 to avoid any putative influence of ethanol on PGE2-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 LTR activity. Kinetics analyses were next performed to determine the optimal incubation time for this PGE2-mediated HIV-1 LTR-driven activation. The maximal positive effect of PGE2 was seen 8 h after the initiation of treatment (fold enhancement of 7.4) (Fig. 1 B). Although this type of kinetic might be reminiscent of degradation of PGE2, it is unlikely since similar kinetic of time-dependent HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase activity were measured with activators such as TNF-α, PHA, and PMA (data not shown). Moreover, preincubation of PGE2in complete culture medium for 24 h at 37 °C resulted in equal fold-induction of HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase activity in 1G5 cells as compared with incubation with fresh PGE2 (data not shown), which demonstrates that PGE2 is fairly stable under these experimental conditions. Taken together, these data indicate that activation of HIV-1 regulatory elements by PGE2 was rapid and transient, thereby suggesting that the effect was direct and was resulting from PGE2-mediated signal transduction events. Given that PGE2 is generally seen as a down-modulator of T-cell activation, we were next interested in determining the action of PGE2 on typical pathways known to lead to HIV-1 LTR activation in T cells. 1G5 cells were hence stimulated with various HIV-1 LTR activators in the absence or the presence of PGE2for 8 h. These stimuli were shown, as expected, to act as potent inducers of HIV-1 LTR activity (fold increase over untreated 1G5 cells: PHA, 20.8: OKT3, 16.8; PMA, 76.4; and TNF-α, 17.7) (Fig. 2). Again, a marked up-regulation of HIV-1 LTR-dependent luciferase activity was also seen when 1G5 cells were incubated with PGE2 alone (10.9-fold increase over untreated 1G5 cells). A PGE2-mediated activating effect on HIV-1 LTR was also present with all stimuli used in this set of experiments (fold increase over 1G5 cells treated with each stimuli in the absence of PGE2: PHA, 1.8; OKT3, 2.3; PMA, 1.2; and TNF-α"
https://openalex.org/W2092844542,"Fatty acid transport protein (FATP) was identified by expression cloning strategies (Schaffer, J. E., and Lodish, H. F. (1994) Cell 79, 427–436) and shown by transfection analysis to catalyze the transfer of long-chain fatty acids across the plasma membrane of cells. It is expressed highly in tissues exhibiting rapid fatty acid metabolism such as skeletal muscle, heart, and adipose. FATP mRNA levels are down-regulated by insulin in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes and up-regulated by nutrient depletion in murine adipose tissue (Man, M. Z., Hui, T. Y., Schaffer, J. E., Lodish, H. F., and Bernlohr, D. A. (1996) Mol. Endocrinol. 10, 1021–1028). To determine the molecular mechanism of insulin regulation of FATP transcription, we have isolated the murine FATP gene and its 5′-flanking sequences. The FATP gene spans ∼16 kilobases and contains 13 exons, of which exon 2 is alternatively spliced. S1 nuclease and RNase protection assays revealed the presence of multiple transcription start sites; the DNA sequence upstream of the predominant transcription start sites lacks a typical TATA box. By transient transfection assays in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the inhibitory action of insulin on FATP transcription was localized to a cis-acting element with the sequence 5′-TGTTTTC-3′ from −1347 to −1353. This sequence is very similar to the insulin response sequence found in the regulatory region of other genes negatively regulated by insulin such as those encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, tyrosine aminotransferase, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the murine FATP gene is localized to chromosome 8, band 8B3.3. Interestingly, this region of chromosome 8 contains a cluster of three other genes important for fatty acid homeostasis, lipoprotein lipase, the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1. These results characterize the murine FATP gene and its insulin responsiveness as well as present a framework for future studies of its role in lipid metabolism, obesity, and type II diabetes mellitus.

The plasma membrane in mammalian cells forms a physical barrier between the intracellular and extracellular environments. A variety of protein carrier systems have been identified which facilitate the movement of metabolites such as sugars and amino acids across the membrane (1Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 2Kinne R.K. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1995; 4: 412-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 3Hediger M.A. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 15-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the mechanism(s) allowing fatty acids to traverse the membrane are poorly understood. Kinetic analysis of the movement of fatty acids across membranes suggests two components: a high affinity, low capacity protein-mediated transport process and a low affinity, high capacity diffusional event (4Berk, P. D., and Stump, D. D. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biochem., in pressGoogle Scholar). Although fatty acids are hydrophobic and are capable of rapidly diffusing through the lipid bilayer when present in high concentrations (5Doody M.C. Pownall H.J. Kao Y.J. Smith L.C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 6Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11074-11086Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), a large body of evidence supports the presence of a protein-mediated carrier system that operates at low substrate concentrations. Because extracellular fatty acids are in equilibrium with albumin, and intracellular fatty acids associate with abundant cytoplasmic fatty acid-binding proteins, the concentration of free, unbound fatty acids traversing the plasma membrane is quite low, estimated to be in the nanomolar range or lower (4Berk, P. D., and Stump, D. D. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biochem., in pressGoogle Scholar). These observations suggest that under normal physiological conditions, a significant fraction of fatty acid transport in animal cells occurs via a protein-mediated system. Permeation of long chain fatty acids into mammalian cells demonstrates saturation kinetics (8Abumrad N.A. Perkins R.C. Park J.H. Park C.R. J. Biol.

The molecular entities responsible for a protein-mediated fatty acid transport process have not been fully characterized, but several proteins have been identified by their affinities for long-chain fatty acids and are proposed to be either fatty acid transporters or components of a fatty acid transport complex (10,14–16). Employing expression cloning strategies as an alternative approach, Schaffer and Lodish (17Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) identified a novel protein, termed fatty acid transport protein (FATP)1 by virtue of its ability to elevate cellular long-chain fatty acid uptake when expressed in COS7 fibroblasts. FATP is a 63-kDa integral plasma membrane protein with four predicted transmembrane domains. It is expressed to the greatest extent in tissues exhibiting high levels of plasma membrane fatty acid flux such as muscle, heart, and adipose (17Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), whereas expression levels in other tissue types is considerably lower. FATP mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is increased during adipose conversion (17Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) and is under hormonal control (18Man M.Z. Hui T.Y. Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Bernlohr D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis showed that FATP mRNA levels increased 5–7-fold during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation, whereas insulin down-regulated FATP mRNA levels 10-fold in cultured adipocytes (17Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 18Man M.Z. Hui T.Y. Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Bernlohr D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Regulation of FATP expression by insulin is rapid, reversible and is exerted at the transcriptional level. In animal studies, FATP mRNA levels in murine adipose tissue increased 11-fold during short term fasting, consistent with the role of insulin as a negative regulator of FATP gene expression (18Man M.Z. Hui T.Y. Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Bernlohr D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Further supporting the effect of insulin on FATP expression, recent studies by Berk and colleagues (19Berk P.D. Zhou S.-L. Kiang C.-L. Stump D. Bradbury M. Isola L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8830-8835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) demonstrated that FATP mRNA levels were increased 5-fold in insulin-resistant Zucker rats when compared with control animals. Insulin effects on gene transcription are believed to be mediated by modulating the activities of trans-acting transcription factors that bind to cis-acting DNA elements. A number of insulin responsive sequences (IRSs) have been characterized (for review, see Ref. 20O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Unlike other hormone responsive elements, the identification of a single consensus sequence for an insulin response element has been elusive. This complexity probably reflects the existence of multiple mechanisms by which insulin affects transcription. While most IRSs have unique sequences that differ by several nucleotides, a number of genes that are negatively regulated by insulin share a common responsive sequence T(G/A)TTTTG. Genes negatively regulated by insulin include those for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK, Ref. 21Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1, Ref. 22Suwanickul A. Morris S.L. Powell D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17063-17068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and tyrosine aminotransferase (23Ganss R. Weih F. Schutz G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For each of these genes, hormonal control of transcription follows a similar theme, glucocorticoid stimulation of gene transcription, a process inhibited by insulin. Interestingly, the IRS of these genes functionally coincides with the glucocorticoid response element. Hepatic nuclear factor-3 (HNF-3) is believed to be the accessory factor that mediates the inductive effects of glucocorticoids on gene transcription (24Nitsch D. Boshart M. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5479-5483Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 25O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanickul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C. Wang J.C. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell.

Commun. 1994; 203: 1835-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, HNF-3 does not directly mediate the action of insulin (25O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanickul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C. Wang J.C. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of the insulin response factor(s) is unknown, but it is speculated that this protein factor interferes with the binding/transactivation potential of HNF-3 and thereby inhibits the stimulatory effect of glucocorticoids. To understand the regulation of FATP gene transcription in adipocytes, we report here the cloning and sequence analysis of the gene and its flanking sequences, the mapping of its chromosomal location and the characterization of its promoter. In addition, we have located an insulin responsive sequence which bears a striking similarity to that of the PEPCK, IGFBP-1, and tyrosine aminotransferase genes. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown to confluence and induced to differentiate to adipocytes as described previously (27Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, preadipocytes were cultured in DMEM, 10% calf serum and 2 days after reaching confluence, differentiation was induced by culturing cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 174 nm insulin, 0.5 mm methylisobutylxanthine, and 0.25 μm dexamethasone. Methylisobutylxanthine and dexamethasone were withdrawn after 2 days whereas insulin was withdrawn after four days. Differentiated cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum until adipocytes (days 9–12, referred to as mature adipocytes) were used for transfection experiments. Transfections were performed by lipofection. Plasmids for transfection were purified by Qiagen Plasmid Midi Kit (Chatsworth, CA). Typically, for each of a 12-well culture plate, 500 ng of firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase construct was co-transfected with 20 ng of pRL-CMV (Promega, Madison, WI), a control vector containing a sea pansy (Renilla reniformis) luciferase gene driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. DNA in DMEM was complexed with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) at the ratio of 1:8 (w/v) for 45 min before addition to the cells. An equal volume of 20% fetal bovine serum in DMEM was added 4 h later. The transfection mixture was removed 20 h later and the cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for a further 48 h before lysis for reporter assays. Luciferase activities were assayed with the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, transfected cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, then lysed with 100 μl of 1 × Passive Lysis Buffer. Lysed cells were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to sea pansy luciferase activities to adjust for transfection efficiency. A mouse genomic library in λEMBL-3 SP6/T7 (a gift from Dr. Harry Orr, University of Minnesota) was screened by using 32P-labeled FATP cDNA as a probe. Positive clones were isolated and purified by three successive rounds. The bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone was obtained from Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO). Double-stranded sequencing was performed at the Obesity Center, University of Minnesota. All exons and exon-intron boundaries were sequenced. Intron sequences, except that of introns 3 and 7, were also determined. Plasmid DNA templates for sequencing were prepared using the Quantum Prep Plasmid Kit (Bio-Rad). The BAC DNA template was prepared by a modified protocol using Qiagen Plasmid Midi Kit (Chatsworth, CA). Nucleotide sequences were analyzed and assembled by the GCG sequence analysis programs Version 8.1 (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) under UNIX emulation. Potential transcription factor-binding sites were identified using the SignalScan program, version 4.0 (University of Minnesota). Southern blot analysis on mouse genomic DNA was performed by standard procedures (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The blot was hybridized to full-length FATP cDNA or a 125-nt exon 3-specific probe amplified by PCR using pBS77 × 1 as the template. Probe for fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments was labeled digoxigenin dUTP by nick translation. Hybridization with normal metaphase chromosomes from male embryonic stem cells was carried out in 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2 × SSC. Fluorescence in situ hybridization-labeled antidigoxigenin antibodies were used for detection of signal and chromosomes were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Total RNA from 3T3-L1 adipocytes was reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and the primer, E4, which is complementary to a portion of exon 4 of the FATP gene. FATP cDNA was then PCR amplified using standard conditions and Taq polymerase (Promega). The primers used were E1 and E3, which anneal to exons 1 and 3 of the FATP gene, respectively. Primer sequences are as follows: E4, 5′-GGCGCTCTGGTTGTCGCCGGGCC-3′; E1, 5′-CCTGCGAGGGAGCAGCAAGG-3′; and E3, 5′-CGCCGCCGCCGCGCTCCAGG-3′. A 383-nt single-stranded DNA probe, extending from the 3′ end of exon 1, was generated by primer extension. The primer PE3 (Fig. 3) was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by polynucleotide kinase reaction. DNA template was prepared by linearizing plasmid pBS77 × 1, which contains exons 1–3 and the upstream flanking sequences, withBglII. DNA probe was synthesized by Klenow polymerase and purified by urea/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Total RNA was isolated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Reagents for S1 analysis were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). 10 μg of 3T3-L1 adipocyte total RNA or yeast tRNA was hybridized with 5 × 104 cpm end-labeled probe in a solution containing 80% formamide, 0.4 m NaCl, 40 mmPIPES, pH 6.4, and 1 mm EDTA for 12–16 h at 42 °C. Samples were then diluted 15-fold with ice-cold S1 nuclease digestion buffer to yield a final concentration of 0.2 m NaCl, 30 mm NaOAc, pH 4.5, 5 mm ZnCl2, and 0.05 μg/μl denatured salmon sperm DNA and digested with 300 units of S1 nuclease at 25 °C for 60 min. S1-resistant hybrids were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel, and the protected probe was visualized by autoradiography. An antisense RNA probe complementary to the FATP promoter (−131 to +85) was generated by in vitrotranscription using T7 DNA polymerase. The template for the reaction was pBS-C1F digested with StyI. 10 μg of day 8 3T3-L1 RNA was dissolved in 30 μl of hybridization buffer (80% formaldehyde, 0.4 m NaOAc, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mmPIPES, pH 6.4) containing 5 × 105 dpm of antisense RNA probe. After denaturing at 95 °C for 5 min, samples were incubated at 45 °C overnight to allow annealing. 300 μl of RNase digestion buffer (200 mm NaOAc, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) was added with 1 unit of RNase ONE (Promega, Madison, WI) and incubated an additional 30 min at 37 °C. To terminate the digestion, 5 μl of Stop solution (10% SDS, 4 μg/μl yeast tRNA) was added. Protected fragments were precipitated in ethanol and resolved on an 8% polyacrylamide/urea gel and detected by autoradiography. A 4.9-kb XhoI fragment (containing exons 1–3) from λ77 was subcloned into theXhoI site of pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), giving rise to pBS77 × 1. A 6.9-kb SacI fragment from λ65 was also subcloned into the SacI site of pBluescript II KS(+), yielding plasmid pBS65HS. Fragments containing various lengths of the FATP promoter were amplified by PCR with restriction sites engineered for subcloning into the promoterless pGL3-Basic luciferase expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI). These PCR generated fragments were fully sequenced to check for mutations introduced by Taq polymerase. pC1F and pC1R, containing the sequence between −1189 and +74, were constructed by ligating the fragment into the HindIII site of the vector in forward and reverse orientations, respectively. The same insert was cloned into pBluescript SK II(+) in the forward orientation to make pBS-C1F. pNH11 (−971/+84), pNH12 (−793/+84), pNH13 (−556/+84), pNH15 (−160/+84), and pNH16 (−30/+84) were constructed by ligating the corresponding fragments into the NheI and HindIII sites of pGL3-Basic. The two plasmids (C1FΔG and C1FΔS) that contain sequences −273/+84 and +53/+84 were generated by digesting C1F withBglII and SacI, respectively, followed by self-ligation. Construct I was generated by ligating a 7.8-kb fragment from λ77 into the SacI site of pGL3-Basic. In order to generate constructs II and III, construct I was digested withBglII; the 1.9- and 2.5-kb fragments were then subcloned into the BglII site of pNH13. Construct IV was made by subcloning a 2.6-kb NheI fragment from construct I into theNheI site of pNH13. The fragment in construct VI containing introns 1 and 2 was amplified by PCR, and subcloned into theNheI and XhoI sites of C1FΔG. Construct VII was made by digesting construct IV with XhoI and EcoRI followed by self-ligation. Construct VIII was made in a similar fashion except MluI and EcoRI were used for digestion. Constructs IX and X were generated by digesting construct VIII with PvuII and PstI, respectively, followed by self-ligation. Constructs XI, XII, and XIII were generated by single-stranded mutagenesis using the Muta-Gene in vitroMutagenesis Kit (Bio-Rad) with the oligos: 5′-ATGTGTGACCTCCTACGCGTGGGACATGCTCAG-3′, 5′-AAACCAATGCCAGCAGAGCTCTCCTCACCATAA-3′, and 5′-AAACCAATGCCAGCAGTGGGGACTCTCCTCACCATAA-3′ respectively. These three constructs were sequenced to confirm the deletions as well as the junction sequences. Day 9 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with 1 μm insulin for 0 or 18 h and nuclear extracts prepared essentially as described previously (30Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). To study the FATP PLE3 region, a double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning nucleotides −1361 to −1342 (PL3) was end-labeled. A 15-μl reaction containing and 0.5 ng of PL3 probe and 9 μg of nuclear extract was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 60 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). The DNA-protein complexes were resolved from the free probe by electrophoresis at 4 °C on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in Tris-glycine buffer (pH 8.3). Double-stranded oligonucleotides composed of the following sequences were used for competition analysis: PL3, 5′-TCGAGGAGAGGAAAACATGCTGAATTC-3′; PLM1, 5′-TCGAGGAGAGtccAACATGCTGAATTC-3′; PLM2, 5′-TCGAGGAGAGGAAAgagTGCTGAATTC-3′; PLM3, 5′-TCGAGGAGAGtccccagTGCTGAATTC-3′; PL12, 5′-TCGACCACTGTTTTAACATGTTTATGGTAGGA-3′; PEP, 5′-TCGATGTGGTGTTTTCACAACCA-3′; AP1, 5′-TCGAGGAGAGGAATTC-3′. In each of the oligonucleotides, the sequence(s) which resembles the PEPCK IRS is underlined. The oligonucleotide PL3 contains sequences from −1361 to −1342 of the FATP upstream region and includes element PLE3. PLM1, PLM2, and PLM3 are identical to PL3 except for base pair substitutions, as indicated by the lowercase letters. Oligonucleotide PL12 is composed of the region from −1417 to −1390 of the FATP upstream sequence and contains the PLE1 and PLE2 elements. The PEPCK insulin response element is contained within oligonucleotide PEP. The AP1 oligonucleotide contains a possible AP-1 element which overlaps the PLE3 element in the FATP upstream region (nucleotides −1360 to −1350). Competitors were added to the reaction mixtures in 20-, 50-, and 200-fold molar excess. Southern blot analysis was employed to characterize the FATP gene. Restriction endonuclease-digested mouse genomic DNA was probed with either the full-length cDNA or a 150-bp probe corresponding to the 5′-end of the coding region. Probing with full-length FATP cDNA revealed multiple positive species (Fig. 1 A) whereas the 150-bp probe hybridized only to a single band on each lane (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that the FATP gene is unique in the genome and 10–30 kb in size. The FATP cDNA (full-length) was used as a probe to screen a mouse genomic λEMBL3 library. Two clones, λ65 and λ77, were isolated after screening 9 × 105 plaques. Phage DNA was digested with SacI or XhoI and the genomic fragments subcloned into pBluescript II KS(+) for restriction mapping and sequencing. Restriction mapping and Southern blot analysis revealed that the two clones were non-overlapping and that λ65 contained the 3′-end of the cDNA while λ77 contained the 5′-end of the cDNA (Fig. 2). To obtain the intervening sequence, a bacterial artificial chromosome clone was isolated using a 3-kb BglII fragment from λ77 containing the first 3 exons. Southern blot analysis of the BAC clone revealed the identical pattern as with mouse genomic DNA, indicating that this clone contains the entire FATP gene (results not shown). The FATP gene spans ∼16 kb and has 13 exons; two of which, exons 1 and 2, are upstream to the translation start site. Two cDNA species with differing 5′-untranslated region were previously isolated by Schaffer and Lodish. 2J. E. Schaffer and H. F. Lodish, unpublished data.Comparing sequences of these 2 cDNA clones with the genomic sequence revealed that while both cDNA clones contain the sequence of exon 1, the 91-bp sequence of exon 2 is absent from one class of cDNA clones, suggesting that the two different cDNA species arise from alternative splicing of exon 2. The existence of two differentially spliced isoforms of FATP was verified by RT-PCR amplification of 3T3-L1 adipocyte RNA. A primer complimentary to a portion of exon 4 of the FATP gene was used to reverse transcribe total RNA. FATP cDNA was then PCR amplified using primers complementary to exons 1 and 3 (E1 and E3). The two resulting PCR products of approximately 124 and 215 nt were the sizes predicted by the alternative splicing of the FATP gene sequence. Furthermore, only the 215-nt band was digested with SmaI, a restriction endonuclease whose site is exclusive to exon 2 (data not shown). These results support the presence of two species of FATP message in the adipocyte mRNA population, one derived from splicing introns 1 and 2 to yield exons 1/2/3, and the second by alternative splicing of exon 1 to exon 3 to yield 1/3. The sequences at the intron/exon boundaries and the intron sizes are summarized in Table I. The sizes of introns were determined from sequencing data or in the case of introns 3 and 7, estimated by PCR using TaKaRa Taq polymerase. All intron/exon boundaries follow the G(T/A)G rule (31Jacob M. Gallinaro H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2159-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), except for introns 2 and 11, in which case the 5′ donor sites are GC. This GC-type variant form of splice site has previously been documented in other genes (32Senapathy P. Shapiro M.B. Harris N.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 252-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar,33Jackson I.J. Chambers D.M. Budd P.S. Johnson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3799-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The flanking sequences of this class of splice site are highly conserved with the sequence AGGCAAG (34Jackson I.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3795-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The same heptanucleotide sequence is present in the 5′ junctions of both introns 2 and 11, strongly suggesting that the GC donor did not arise from sequencing errors or from cloning artifacts. A variant polyadenylation signal ATTAAA (35Wahle E. Keller W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 419-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was found 642 nt downstream of the translation stop codon (Fig. 3). A GT-rich downstream element, which is also important in defining the polyadenylation site (36McLauchlan J. Gaffney D. Whitton J.L. Clements J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1347-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), is located immediately 3′ to sequence corresponding to the end of the cDNA clone. Another GT-rich element is found 25 nt downstream of the polyadenylation signal.Table ISequence of exon-intron boundariesIntronPositionSequenceSize1−95GGGATCTgtaagcc......tttgcagCTCTGTC318 bp2−8GGATCAGgcaagct......tccgcagGATGCGG1287 bp3+161ACCTCTTgtaagta......atgcaagTGGCCTC∼8 kb4+556GCAGCGGgttgagg......accacagCGGTGGC114 bp5+718ATGGATGgtaagtg......tgtgcagATCGGCT76 bp6+880TCTGCAGgtatgtg......tctctagGGAACAT66 bp7+990TTGCACGgtaagcc......gttgcagGTAGTGC∼3 kb8+1202CGGCAAGgttcgca......accctagGTCGGCT92 bp9+1327CAGCCCGgtgagtg......cctccagGGGAACC87 bp10+1465CTCTCAGgtgcgga......ccgtcagGTGACGT69 bp11+1630GTGCCAGgcaagct......tttgcagGAGTGGA336 bp12+1777ACCACAGgtacaga......cctccagGCACCTT351 bpIntron numbers and sizes in base pairs are shown.

We investigated the contribution of individual IIIS6 amino acid residues for diltiazem sensitivity by employing alanine scanning mutagenesis in a benzothiazepine-sensitive α1 subunit chimera (ALDIL) expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes.The most dramatic decrease of block by 100 μm diltiazem (ALDIL 45 ± 4.8% inhibition) during trains of 100-ms pulses (0.1 Hz, −80 mV holding potential) was found after mutation of adjacent IIIS6 residues Phe1164(21 ± 3%) and Val1165 (8.5 ± 1.4%). Diltiazem delayed current recovery by promoting a slowly recovering current component. This effect was similar in ALDIL and F1164A but largely prevented in V1165A. Both mutations slowed inactivation kinetics during a pulse. The reduced diltiazem block can therefore be explained by slowing of inactivation kinetics (F1164A and V1165A) and accelerated recovery from drug block (V1165A). The bulkier diltiazem derivative benziazem still efficiently blocked V1165A.From these functional and from additional radioligand binding studies with the dihydropyridine (+)-[3H]isradipine we propose a model in which Val1165 controls dissociation of the bound diltiazem molecule, and where bulky substituents on the basic nitrogen of diltiazem protrude toward the adjacent dihydropyridine binding domain.

The activity of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels in muscle, endocrine and neuronal cells is blocked by different chemical classes of drugs, termed Ca2+ antagonists. Dihydropyridines (nifedipine, isradipine), phenylalkylamines (verapamil, desmethoxyverapamil) and benzothiazepines ((+)-cis-diltiazem; diltiazem)1 stereoselectively interact with high affinity binding domains on the so-called α1 subunit of the L-type Ca2+ channel complex and thereby cause channel block (1Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 114: 1-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent biochemical studies, employing photoaffinity labeling, site-directed mutagensis, and chimeric α1 subunit constructs revealed that high affinity binding determinants for these drugs are located close to pore-forming regions of L-type Ca2+ channel α1 subunits. Important binding determinants for DHPs and PAAs were identified in transmembrane segments IIIS5, IIIS6, and IVS6 (for review, see Refs. 2Hockerman G.H. Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 361-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 3Striessnig J. Grabner M. Mitterdorfer J. Hering S. Sinnegger M.J. Glossmann H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 108-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Both classes of drugs directly or indirectly affect Ca2+coordination to the channel's selectivity filter glutamates. It is therefore conceivable that these drugs cause Ca2+ channel block by binding to pore-forming regions, thereby altering channel gating and Ca2+ ion interaction with the pore (for review, see Refs. 2Hockerman G.H. Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 361-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 3Striessnig J. Grabner M. Mitterdorfer J. Hering S. Sinnegger M.J. Glossmann H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 108-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Less detailed structural information is available for the BTZ binding domain, which mediates use-dependent Ca2+channel block by diltiazem. BTZ and PAA interaction with the channel is similar in many respects; BTZs and PAAs contain a basic nitrogen essential for activity (4Kimball S.D. Hunt J.T. Barrish J.C. Das J. Floyd D.M. Lago M.W. Lee V.G. Spergel S.H. Moreland S. Hedberg S.A. Gougoutas J.Z. Malley M.F. Lau W. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1993; 1: 285-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and, unlike for DHPs, Ca2+channel block critically depends on depolarization frequency (“use-dependent block”). Some early radioligand binding experiments even proposed that PAAs and BTZs compete for the same site (5Galizzi J.P. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 118: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) on the channel. This is supported by the finding that identical amino acid residues in IVS6 are essential for high affinity PAA as well as diltiazem sensitivity (2Hockerman G.H. Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 361-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hering S. Aczel S. Grabner M. Döring F. Berjukow S. Mitterdorfer J. Sinnegger M.J. Striessnig J.

On the other hand several lines of evidence suggest that the PAA and BTZ binding domains are not identical; PAAs and BTZs possess a distinct structure-activity relationship for blocking (4Kimball S.D. Hunt J.T. Barrish J.C. Das J. Floyd D.M. Lago M.W. Lee V.G. Spergel S.H. Moreland S. Hedberg S.A. Gougoutas J.Z. Malley M.F. Lau W. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1993; 1: 285-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and they access their binding domains from opposite sides (PAAs, the cytoplasmic side; BTZs, the extracellular side) of the channel (7Hering S. Savchenko A. Strübing C. Lakitsch M. Striessnig J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 820-826PubMed Google Scholar). In an extensive analysis combining information from alanine-scanning mutagenesis and radioligand binding we provide further insight into the molecular architecture of the BTZ binding domain of L-type Ca2+ channels. In particular we identified two amino acid residues in transmembrane segment IIIS6 which affect diltiazem sensitivity by different mechanisms and provide evidence for a steric interaction between the BTZ and DHP binding domain. The (+)-cis-Diastereoisomer of diltiazem was employed in all experiments (kindly provided by Göddecke (Freiburg, Germany). (+)-Isradipine was a gift from Sandoz AG (Basel, Switzerland). (+)-[3H]Isradipine (∼80 Ci/mmol) was purchased from New England Nuclear (Vienna, Austria). Benziazem was synthesized as described previously (8Kraus R. Reichl B. Kimball S.D. Grabner M. Murphy B.J.

The diltiazem-sensitive α1 subunit chimera ALDIL was employed for alanine scanning mutagenesis. This chimera (Fig. 1) consists of α1A sequence with an L-type Ca2+ channel sequence transferred into the S5-S6 linkers as well as S6 segments in III and IV. Chimera ALDIL (amino acid composition: α1A1–1406, α1S965–1104 (carp skeletal muscle; GenBank accession no. M62554), α1A1544–1723, α1C1311–1437 (rabbit heart; GenBank accession no. 67515), α1A1856–2424) was constructed as follows. TheClaI-XbaI fragment of AL16 (9Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was ligated into the ClaI-XbaI linearized AL1-a (10Hering S. Aczel S. Kraus R.L. Berjukov S.

Single point mutations were introduced into the SalI (nucleotide position α1S3317)-ClaI (nucleotide position α1S4925) cassette of segment IIIS6 using gene splicing by overlap extension (11Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction was performed (35 cycles, 1 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 42 °C, 1.5 min at 72 °C) using proofreading Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). Polymerase chain reaction-generated mutations were verified by sequence analysis employing the dideoxy chain termination method. Single alanine mutations were introduced into the IIIS6 segment between the following positions (amino acid positions correspond to α1C-II) (12Snutch T.P. Tomlinson W.J. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 45-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar): Phe1148 to Ile1156 and Phe1158 to Phe1167. All constructs were inserted into the polyadenylating transcription plasmid pSPCBI-2. Preparation of stage V-VI oocytes from X.laevis, synthesis of capped run-off poly(A+) cRNA transcripts from XbaI-linearized cDNA templates, and injection of cRNA were described in detail previously (9Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). α1 cRNAs were coinjected with β1a (13Ruth P. Roehrkasten A.

To exclude effects of endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl− currents on current kinetics, experiments were also carried out in oocytes previously injected with 50–100 nl of a 0.1 m1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N, N, N, N-tetraacetic acid solution. Inward Ba2+currents (I Ba) through expressed channel complexes were measured using the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique (9Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 15Sinnegger M.J. Wang Z. Grabner M. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Mitterdorfer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27686-27693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recordings were carried out at room temperature in a bath solution containing 40 mm Ba(OH)2, 40 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, adjusted to a pH of 7.4 with methane sulfonic acid. Voltage recording and current injecting microelectrodes were filled with 2.8 m CsCl, 0.2m CsOH, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (adjusted to pH 7.4 with HCl) and had resistances of 0.3–2 megohm. Similar current amplitudes were obtained with mutant and ALDIL subunits. Oocytes expressing peakI Ba smaller than 400 nA or larger than 1.6 μA were excluded from analysis. Data analysis and acquisition was performed by using the pClamp software package (version 6.0, Axon Instruments). Initial “tonic” block (resting state-dependent block) was defined as peak I Ba inhibition during the first pulse after 3-min incubation at holding potential in a drug- containing solution as compared with control I Bain the absence of drug. Use (frequency)-dependent block of I Ba was measured during trains of 100-ms test pulses (0.1 Hz) applied from −80 mV to a test potential +10 mV positive to the peak of the current-voltage relationship after a 3-min equilibrium period in a drug-containing solution. To estimate the peakI Ba decay under control conditions, similar test pulses were applied in the absence of drug. Use-dependent block was expressed as the percent decrease of peakI Ba during the last pulse of the train as compared with I Ba during the first pulse. The voltage dependence of activation was determined from I-V curves obtained by step depolarizations from a holding potential of −80 mV to various test potentials. The voltage dependence of inactivation (steady state inactivation) was determined from normalized inward currents elicited during steps to +10 mV after 10-s steps to various holding potentials. The half-maximal voltage for activation (V0.5,act), and steady state inactivation (V0.5,inact) were calculated by fitting the data to the Boltzmann equation. Recovery of I Ba from inactivation was studied using a double-pulse protocol. After a 3-s depolarizing prepulse to +10 mV (holding potential −80 mV) the time course of IBarecovery was determined at −60 mV by applying 300-ms test pulses to +10 mV at various time intervals after the prepulse. PeakI Ba was normalized to the peak current amplitude measured during the prepulse. I Ba was then allowed to recover during 90 s at −100 mV. This double pulse protocol was repeated individually for each recovery time interval in the same oocyte. (+)-[3H]Isradipine binding assays were carried out at 37 °C or room temperature in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5–1 ml final assay volume). 1 μm (±)-isradipine was used to define nonspecific binding. Bound ligand was determined by filtration of the assay mixture over GF/C Whatman filters pretreated with 0.25% (v/v) polyethyleneimine for 40 min. Filters were washed three times with ice-cold buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and then counted for radioactivity. Radioligand and protein concentrations as well as incubation conditions are given in the figure legends. To determine radioligand dissociation, (+)-[3H]isradipine was incubated (in the absence or presence of benziazem) with rabbit skeletal muscle membranes until equilibrium was reached (60 min at 22 °C). 1 μmunlabeled isradipine (in the absence or presence of unlabeled beziazem) was then added and dissociation followed for the indicated times. Dissociation rate constants were determined as the slope of the regression line from a plot of ln (fractional binding)versus time. Molecular dynamics simulations (25 °C) were performed using the SYBYL software package. Nonlinear least square fitting and statistical calculations were performed using OriginR(Microcal). Data are given as means ± S.E. for the indicated number of experiments. Student's unpaired t test was used to calculate statistical significance. We have previously shown that the photoreactive diltiazem analogue [3H]benziazem photoaffinity labels transmembrane segments IVS6 and IIIS6, suggesting that both segments are in close contact with the bound drug molecule and contain high affinity BTZ-binding determinants (8Kraus R. Reichl B. Kimball S.D. Grabner M. Murphy B.J. Catterall W.A. Striessnig J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20113-20118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We subsequently identified the binding determinants in IVS6 as Tyr1463, Ala1467, and Ile1470 (6Hering S. Aczel S. Grabner M. Döring F. Berjukow S. Mitterdorfer J. Sinnegger M.J. Striessnig J. Degtiar V.E. Wang Z. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24471-24475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To search for amino acid residues that affect diltiazem sensitivity in segment IIIS6 we employed alanine-scanning mutagenesis. Mutagenesis was carried out in a diltiazem and PAA-sensitive α1 subunit chimera ALDIL in which the segments corresponding to the photolabeled regions and the respective S5-S6 linkers consisted of L-type sequence, whereas the remaining sequence consisted of α1A sequence (Fig. 1, see “Experimental Procedures”). Mutated channels were coexpressed in X. laevisoocytes together with auxiliary α2-δ and β subunits and the sensitivity of the mutant channels to diltiazem was determined by using the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. Mutants were screened for changes in resting-state and use-dependent block by diltiazem during a train of 15–20 depolarizing pulses (100 ms, 0.1 Hz) from a holding potential of −80 mV as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, 100 μm diltiazem blocked about 45 ± 4.8% (n = 8) of the ALDIL-mediatedI Ba. A significant (p < 0.01) reduction in total diltiazem block was observed only after mutation of two adjacent residues, Phe1164 and Val1165, near the cytoplasmic end of IIIS6. Both residues are conserved in L- and non-L-type Ca2+ channel α1 subunits. Only 21 ± 3% (n = 12) and 8.5 ± 1.4% (n = 13) of I Ba were blocked by 100 μmdiltiazem in F1164A and V1165A, respectively. Accordingly, at lower diltiazem concentrations, block was observed for ALDIL but was almost absent for F1164A and V1165A (10 μm diltiazem; ALDIL, 30 ± 3%, n = 3; F1164A, 6 ± 2%, n = 3; V1165A, 3–5%, range,n = 2). The extent of total I Ba inhibition of the other mutants was not significantly different from ALDIL (Fig. 2 A). In mutants F1148A and I1163A, the tonic block component was increased, and the use-dependent block component significantly decreased compared with that of ALDIL. These residues may therefore comprise minor determinants for diltiazem sensitivity. We have recently shown that the sensitivity of L-type Ca2+ channels to the PAA gallopamil is decreased in slowly inactivating Ca2+channel α1 mutants (10Hering S. Aczel S. Kraus R.L. Berjukov S. Striessnig J. Timin E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13323-13328Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that voltage-dependent inactivation is an important determinant of gallopamil sensitivity. We therefore investigated whether mutations F1164A and V1165A alter diltiazem sensitivity indirectly by changing the gating properties of the channel rather than by directly altering drug affinity for its binding domain. Fig. 3 A illustrates that V1165A (V0.5,inact = 16 ± 2 mV, n = 11), but not F1164A (V0.5,inact = 36 ± 2 mV,n = 5), caused a major (about 16 mV) shift of the V0.5,inact of the steady state inactivation curve to more positive potentials (ALDIL: V0.5,inact = 32 ± 2 mV, n = 12). At −80 mV, the holding potential selected for the experiments shown in Fig. 2, no differences in steady state inactivation were observed. Therefore it is unlikely that a higher fraction of inactivated channels at −80 mV accounted for the differences in diltiazem sensitivity in the two mutants. F1164A and V1165A also caused a significant shift of current activation (ALDIL V0.5,act = −17.3 ± 1 mV; F1164A V0.5,act = −24.7 ± 1.2 mV; V1165A V0.5,act = −10.6 ± 1.1 mV; n > 22) and slowed current inactivation during a pulse.I Ba elicited by 800-ms depolarizations from a holding potential of −80 mV to test potentials +10 mV positive to the peak of the I–V curve are shown in Fig. 3 B. Monoexponential fits of the current decay revealed an about 1.5–3-fold slower inactivation of F1164A (τ = 627 ± 118 ms, n = 10) and V1165A (τ = 1286 ± 79 ms, n = 12) than did ALDIL (τ = 447 ± 103 ms, n = 14). Taken together our data reveal that mutation of two conserved residues, Phe1164 and Val1165, on the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment IIIS6, change activation and inactivation gating and are major determinants for use-dependent diltiazem block. If inactivation is an important determinant for the development of use-dependent block by diltiazem, then slowing of channel inactivation in the two mutants could explain their lower sensitivity for diltiazem. To address this question the kinetics of diltiazem block and unblock were studied in more detail. The effect of 10 and 100 μmdiltiazem on the rate of current decay was determined during maintained 3-s depolarizations that allowed substantial inactivation even for the more slowly inactivating mutants F1164A and V1165A (Fig. 4 A). In ALDILcurrent decay during the 3-s test pulse was accelerated by 100 μm but not by 10 μm diltiazem (Fig. 4 A), thereby reducing I Ba at the end of the test pulse to 64 ± 9% of control (n = 4). This effect was comparable in F1164A (57 ± 6% of control,n = 5) and V1165A (68 ± 3% of control,n = 9). The drug-induced increase of the rate of I Ba decay is characteristic for drugs that block open and/or inactivated channel states during the pulse more potently than do resting channels at −80 mV. Using the extent of I Ba block by diltiazem at 3 s as a measure, the mutations did not dramatically affect channel block by 100 μm diltiazem at depolarized potentials (+10 mV). Next we investigated the effect of diltiazem on the time course of recovery of I Ba from inactivation employing a double pulse protocol. Fig. 4 B shows the recovery of I Ba for ALDIL, F1164A, and V1165A after a 3-s depolarizing conditional prepulse. Recovery was measured at −60 mV by applying 300-ms test pulses to +10 mV various periods of time after the prepulse. Peak I Ba elicited by the test pulses were normalized with respect to the peakI Ba of the prepulse (see current traces in Fig. 4 D). The recovery time courses in the absence of drug were similar for ALDIL and the two mutants (see legend to Fig. 4 B). In all cases recovery could be described by two phases.I Ba rapidly recovered monoexponentially to 80–90% of control within 15 s (termed “fast recovery”), whereas the remaining current did not recover within the 15-s period analyzed. From the total recoverable current we arbitrarily defined the contribution of “slow recovery” as the I Banot recovered after 15 s. Slow recovery accounted for 18.2 ± 0.5% (n = 5) in ALDIL, 19.4 ± 2% (n = 5) in F1164A, and 16 ± 1% (n = 9) in V1165A. This suggested that during the depolarizing prepulse all three channel constructs enter both slow (“deep”) and fast inactivated states to similar extents resulting in biphasic recovery time courses. Slow inactivation has previously been reported for native and recombinant L-type Ca2+channels (16Johnson B.D. Hockerman G.H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1388-1400PubMed Google Scholar, 17Boyett M.R. Honjo H. Harrison S.M. Zang W.J. Kirby M.S. Pflügers Arch. 1994; 428: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The effect of diltiazem consisted in a dramatic overall slowing of the recovery time course in ALDIL and F1164A. This was mainly due to a more than 3-fold increase of the contribution of the slowly recovering component (100 μm diltiazem: ALDIL, 70 ± 3%; F1164A, 65 ± 4%;n = 5; 10 μm diltiazem: ALDIL, 55 ± 5%; F1164A, 54 ± 2%,n = 3), whereas the time constants for the rapidly recovering components were almost unchanged (see legend to Fig. 4 B). Unlike for I Ba block development during the prepulse, the 10 μm concentrations also caused a pronounced effect on I Ba recovery of ALDIL and F1164A. As the diltiazem effect on the recovery time course was almost indistinguishable for F1164A as compared with ALDIL (Fig. 4, B and C), the smaller use-dependent block of F1164A during pulse trains (Fig. 2,A and B) is not due to a change in channel recovery but rather to the decreased inactivation during test pulses, allowing less channels to enter a (slowly recovering) drug-bound state during the pulse train (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to ALDIL and F1164A, mutation V1165A almost completely prevented this diltiazem-induced increase of the amplitude of the slowly recovering component (Fig. 4 B). The fraction of I Ba not recovered after 15 s in the presence of diltiazem (10 μm diltiazem present: 29 ± 3%, n = 5; 100 μm diltiazem present: 27 ± 3%, n = 9) was only slightly increased as compared with control (16 ± 1%, n = 9). Diltiazem delayed the time course of the fast recovering component (see legend to Fig. 4 B), which resulted in a clear inhibition of I Ba during the first few seconds. To illustrate this difference in current recovery the fraction of current recovered after 3 or 15 s in the presence of 10 μm diltiazem was divided by the fraction of current recovered in the absence of drug for ALDIL and the two mutants. Fig. 4 Cillustrates that after 3 s of recovery a comparable percentage of the current remained blocked in all constructs by 10 μmdiltiazem. This degree of block was maintained over 15 s in ALDIL and F1164A but mostly relieved in V1165A (Fig. 4 C). The acceleration of recovery from diltiazem block in mutation V1165A indicates that valine replacement either directly decreases binding affinity for the drug or allows a more rapid dissociation of the drug after being trapped in a blocked channel state. As diltiazem sensitivity in V1165A was still observed as a block of depolarized channels (Fig. 4 A) and as a block of I Ba during early recovery (Fig. 4 C), mutation V1165A does not seem to dramatically decrease diltiazem binding affinity. Earlier models describing block of L-type Ca2+ channels by PAA Ca2+ antagonists suggest that use-dependent Ca2+ channel blockers bind to open channels, but are trapped within inactivated channels and require removal of inactivation for rapid dissociation and unblocking (10Hering S. Aczel S. Kraus R.L. Berjukov S. Striessnig J. Timin E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13323-13328Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Johnson B.D. Hockerman G.H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1388-1400PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore propose that replacement of the bulkier valine in position 1165 by an alanine (partially) removes a dissociation barrier and facilitates dissociation of diltiazem from blocked (presumably inactivated) channel states. If this were true then we would expect that bulky diltiazem derivatives would escape at a slower rate. As a consequence such a bulky drug should, at least partially, overcome the effect of the mutation and cause substantial use-dependent block even in V1165A. We tested this hypothesis using the bulkier diltiazem derivative benziazem, which has previously been shown to photoaffinity label segment IIIS6 (8Kraus R. Reichl B. Kimball S.D. Grabner M. Murphy B.J. Catterall W.A. Striessnig J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20113-20118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Benziazem contains a bulky benzophenone substituent remote from the pharmacophores important for interaction with the benzothiazepine binding domain (8Kraus R. Reichl B. Kimball S.D. Grabner M. Murphy B.J. Catterall W.A. Striessnig J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20113-20118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that the extent of block by 10 and 100 μm benziazem (gray columns) was only slightly (1.3–1.5-fold) larger than by diltiazem in ALDIL. In contrast, under the same experimental conditions benziazem caused 3.6–4.5-fold larger block of V1165A at both concentrations than did diltiazem, indicating that this bulkier drug must still be able to considerably slow recovery from inactivation in V1165A. The above finding also prompted us to investigate whether the larger size of benziazem can alter its noncompetitive interaction mechanism with the DHP binding domain, which is also formed predominantly by IIIS6 residues (2Hockerman G.H. Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 361-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Striessnig J. Grabner M. Mitterdorfer J. Hering S. Sinnegger M.J. Glossmann H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 108-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). We compared the effects of the bulky benziazem and its analogues Bz-BAZ and DMBODIPY-BAZ (18Brauns T. Cai Z.-W. Kimball D. Kang H.-C. Haugland R.P. Berger W. Berjukov S. Hering S. Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3461-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) with the smaller molecules diltiazem and SQ32,910 (7Hering S. Savchenko A. Strübing C. Lakitsch M. Striessnig J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 820-826PubMed Google Scholar) on (+)-[3H]isradipine binding to skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channels. Fig. 6 A illustrates that, in contrast to (+)-cis-diltiazem and SQ32,910, which are known stimulators of equilibrium (+)-[3H]isradipine binding (7Hering S. Savchenko A. Strübing C. Lakitsch M. Striessnig J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 820-826PubMed Google Scholar), all three bulky derivatives were inhibitory. For benziazem and Bz-BAZ incomplete inhibition could be demonstrated (maximal inhibition to 73 ± 3% (n = 10) and 89 ± 2% (n = 3) of control). Benziazem was selected to further investigate the inhibitory mechanism of these compounds. Saturation analysis (Fig. 6 B) revealed that 1 μmbenziazem decreased the apparent binding affinity of the DHP by about 2.8-fold (control, K d = 0.43 ± 0.06 nm; 1 μm benziazem present,K d = 1.2 ± 0.06 nm;n = 3) without major change in B max (control, 179 ± 22 pm; 1 μm benziazem present, 154 ± 13 pm;n = 3). This affinity decrease was mainly due to a destabilization of the DHP·Ca2+ channel complex as revealed by dissociation kinetics. For dissociation experiments (Fig. 6 C) (+)-[3H]isradipine was incubated in the absence (control) and presence of 1 μm benziazem until binding equilibrium was reached. (+)-[3H]Isradipine dissociation from control and ternary channel complexes was then induced by an excess of unlabeled isradipine (“cold chase”). As shown in Fig. 6 C dissociation was about 2-fold faster from ternary complexes than from channels preincubated without benziazem. This indicated that the increase of k −1mainly accounts for the increase in K d(K d =k −1/k +1) (k −1 = dissociation rate constant;k +1 = association rate constant). However, this destabilizing effect of benziazem was not seen when 1 μm(or 10 μm, not shown) benziazem was added (together with unlabeled (+)-isradipine, “double chase”) after the (+)-[3H]isradipine channel complex had already been formed (Fig. 6 D). These experiments clearly show that benziazem destabilized DHP binding in the ternary complex but that the DHP must dissociate before this effect can occur. In control experiments (+)-verapamil, which is known to inhibit DHP binding via an allosteric mechanism (1Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 114: 1-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also partially inhibited (+)-[3H]isradipine equilibrium binding but, in contrast to benziazem, was also able to accelerate (+)-[3H]isradipine dissociation from preformed high affinity (+)-[3H]isradipine-channel complexes (Fig. 6 D). The benziazem binding data are difficult to interpret on the basis of an allosteric model, which would predict a destabilizing effect of an unlabeled drug through binding to a separate, allosterically coupled site in both types of dissociation experiments (as observed for (+)-verapamil). Modulation of (+)-[3H]isradipine binding by benziazem is best explained as a steric interaction between the bound benziazem and DHP molecule, in which the bulky side chain of benziazem can decrease DHP binding stability once the DHP is dissociated. Although a precise mechanism for this effect cannot be derived from our experiments it is likely that this is caused by a protrusion of the bulky benziazem side chain into the DHP binding region. On the basis of this proposed steric mechanism we can use benziazem and its bulky analogues as molecular rulers. From the distance of their side chains from the basic amine pharmacophore as calculated from molecular dynamics simulations (benziazem ≤ 17 Å; DMBODIPY-BAZ ≤ 17 Å; Bz-BAZ ≤ 11 Å) we can estimate the maximal distance between the BTZ binding domain and the bound DHP molecule to be 11–17 Å. Our study provides insight into the molecular mechanism of diltiazem interaction with L-type Ca2+ channels and the molecular organization of the Ca2+ antagonist binding domains on α1 subunits. Using alanine scanning mutagenesis we identified amino acid residues Phe1164 and Val1165 at the cytoplasmic end of the putative IIIS6 α-helix as important determinants for diltiazem sensitivity. Although our functional studies could not demonstrate their direct contribution to the formation of the diltiazem binding pocket, these residues indirectly control diltiazem sensitivity by slowing channel inactivation (both residues, Fig. 3 B) and by facilitating channel recovery from drug block (V1165A, Fig. 4). We also provide evidence that introduction of bulky side chains into the diltiazem molecule (i) largely prevented the V1165A mutational effect by stabilizing channel block and (ii) produced compounds noncompetitively inhibiting rather than stimulating DHP binding to the channel through an apparently steric interaction mechanism. Among the 19 mutations investigated, mutants F1164A and V1165A caused the most pronounced effects on channel inactivation kinetics as well as diltiazem sensitivity. Our studies do not exclude the possibility that minor effects on diltiazem sensitivity are present in the other mutants which will, however, require a more detailed analysis. Phe1164 and Val1165 are highly conserved in all high voltage-activated Ca2+ channel α1subunits. As mutation of these residues not only affects inactivation gating in ALDIL but also in α1C (19Hockerman G.H. Johnson B.D. Abbott M.R. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18759-18765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) it is likely that they are part of a common inactivation mechanism in all Ca2+ channel α1 subunits. Our experiments provide important insight into the mechanism of diltiazem block. It promotes a slowly recovering channel state that explains the development of use-dependent block at a higher depolarization frequency. This effect of diltiazem is qualitatively indistinguishable from the mechanism of action of phenylalkylamines (10Hering S. Aczel S. Kraus R.L. Berjukov S. Striessnig J. Timin E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13323-13328Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Johnson B.D. Hockerman G.H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1388-1400PubMed Google Scholar). Although different kinetic models have been proposed to account for this effect (10Hering S. Aczel S. Kraus R.L. Berjukov S. Striessnig J. Timin E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13323-13328Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Johnson B.D. Hockerman G.H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1388-1400PubMed Google Scholar), it is believed that the time course of recovery from channel block is critically determined by steric factors governing the rate of dissociation of the drug trapped within inactivated channel states (10Hering S. Aczel S. Kraus R.L. Berjukov S. Striessnig J. Timin E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13323-13328Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Johnson B.D. Hockerman G.H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1388-1400PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA1991Google Scholar). The intriguing effect of mutation V1165A was to allow the channel to recover from diltiazem block more rapidly. A possible molecular explanation for this finding is that Val1165 as part of an inactivation mechanism also controls diltiazem dissociation from inactivated channels. Replacement by a less bulky alanine would therefore not only affect inactivation but also facilitate drug dissociation thereby accelerating recovery from drug block. Such a steric mechanism also predicts that not only the size of the “dissociation pathway” generated by the mutation but also the size of the drug itself affects the rate of dissociation. The fact that the bulkier diltiazem derivative benziazem still was an effective use-dependent blocker of V1165A (Fig. 5) strongly supports the above model. Together with its slower inactivation time course the accelerated recovery from diltiazem block of V1165A also explains the dramatic decrease of its use-dependent block at higher depolarization frequency (Fig. 2). We describe another interesting difference between diltiazem and its bulkier derivatives benziazem, DMBODIPY-BAZ, and BZ-BAZ. They act as partial inhibitors rather than stimulators of (+)-[3H]isradipine binding to L-type Ca2+channels. A detailed kinetic analysis of the benziazem effect led us to conclude that partial DHP binding inhibition by the bulky side chains is based on a steric rather than allosteric decrease of (+)-[3H]isradipine binding affinity. Our results are in accordance with our previous detailed spectroscopic analysis of the interaction of fluorescently labeled diltiazem derivative, DMBODIPY-BAZ, with unlabeled DHPs (21Brauns T. Prinz H. Kimball S.D. Haugland R.P. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3625-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We found evidence for a direct drug-drug interaction between channel bound DHPs and DMBODIPY-BAZ, also supporting a steric model. From a quantitative analysis of high time resolution kinetic binding data (21Brauns T. Prinz H. Kimball S.D. Haugland R.P. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3625-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) we predicted a 3-fold decrease of (+)-isradipine affinity after DMBODIPY-BAZ binding. This is now confirmed directly employing (+)-[3H]isradipine as a radioligand supporting a model in which the DHP and BTZ binding domain are located in close proximity between IIIS6 and IVS6 in the folded α1 subunit structure. Using the bulky side chains of diltiazem analogues as molecular rulers we currently estimate a maximal distance of 11–17 Å between the basic nitrogen of bound BTZs and the bound DHP molecule. This is about 2 times the narrowest diameter of the channel pore (≈6 Å) (22McCleskey E.W. Almers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7149-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to investigate the behavior of compounds with even smaller side chains (23Kimball S.D. Floyd D.M. Das J. Hunt J.T. Krapcho J. Rovnyak G. Duff K.J. Lee V.G. Moquin R.V.

Our and previous data reveal several important common properties between PAA and BTZs with respect to channel interaction and modulation. First, they both share residues Tyr1463, Ala1467, and Ile1470 in segment IVS6 as common binding motifs (6Hering S. Aczel S. Grabner M. Döring F. Berjukow S. Mitterdorfer J. Sinnegger M.J.

Rather than distinguishing between two separate binding domains for PAAs and BTZs as proposed by an allosteric model (1Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 114: 1-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) a common or strongly overlapping binding domain mostly formed by IIIS6 and IVS6 residues should be proposed through which cationic amphiphilic PAAs and BTZs modulate L-type channel activity.

Epidemiological studies have established a close association between chronic infection with human hepatitis B virus (HBV)1 and the development of primary hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the nature of this association and the mechanism by which HBV infection leads to tumor formation are not well understood (1Beasly R.P.

Studies of HBV-related hepadnaviruses have shed some light on the positive role of the X gene product in hepatocarcinogenesis. The woodchuck and ground squirrel hepatitis viruses, the genomes of which harbor the X gene, are associated with development of hepatocellular carcinoma. In contrast, the oncogenic potential of avian hepadnaviruses, that are devoid of an X open reading frame, has not been conclusively established (3Duflot A. Mehrotra R., Yu, S.Z. Barraud L. Trepo C.

This broad gene regulation function suggests that HBx not only up-regulates the expression of HBV genes by transactivating the HBV enhancer but also modifies the environment by transactivating cellular genes in infected cells to facilitate viral replication.

These findings are so diverse that the mechanism of HBx transactivation remains unclear. It has also been reported that HBx mediates transcriptional activation through modification of signal transduction pathways in the cytoplasm (7Lucito R. Schneider R.J. J.

Although it is not well defined, the subcellular localization of HBx seems to be mainly cytoplasmic and some portion nuclear (37Doria M. Klein N. Lucito R. Schneider R.J.

HBx thus may have a dual role in transcriptional regulation; cytoplasmic HBx influences the regulation of second messenger systems while nuclear HBx may function at the promoter level. Nuclear HBx may directly interact with the transcription machinery to facilitate transcription (22Cheong J.H. Yi M. Lin Y. Murakami S.

Recently, we found that HBx specifically binds to RPB5, a common subunit shared by eukaryotic nuclear RNA polymerases I, II, and III and transcription factor TFIIB and that the trimeric interactions may be involved in HBx transactivation (22Cheong J.H. Yi M. Lin Y. Murakami S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 142-150Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 24Lin Y. Nomura T. Cheong J. Dorjisuren D. Iida K. Murakami S. J. Biol.

To gain insight into the transactivation mechanism of HBx, we examined the role of HBx in modulation of transcription with a transient transfection in vivo system and an in vitrotranscription assay using nuclear extract and recombinant proteins. We utilized artificial reporters bearing Gal4 binding sites since in this system the effects of endogenous factors with or without signaling may be largely avoided. Here we present results showing that HBx cannot act as a transcriptional activator but that it co-activates activated transcription. The TFIIB- and RPB5- interacting sites of HBx were also shown to be important for HBx co-activation by using substituted HBx mutants. HBx stimulated transcription from templates bearing the X responsive element (XRE) in an in vitro transcription assay with endogenous transcriptional activators in nuclear lysates. These results suggested that HBx acts as a co-activator in transcription through modulation of the transcriptional machinery and distal binding activators, and this co-activation could explain the transactivation mechanism of nuclearly localized HBx in vivo. The mammalian expression plasmid pSG5UTPL has been described previously (40Murakami S. Cheong J. Kaneko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15118-15123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HBx, HBx-5D1, and HBx-3D5 encode HBx 1–154 amino acids (full size), 51–154 amino acids, and 1–50 amino acids, respectively (22Cheong J.H. Yi M. Lin Y. Murakami S.

In HBx-m76 and HBx-m93, four amino acid residues were substituted by GAGA, ARRM at positions 76–79 of HBx-m76 and LHKR at positions 93–96 of HBx-m93, respectively (24Lin Y. Nomura T. Cheong J.

The Escherichia coli histidine-tagged protein expression plasmid pLHis was derived from pET11d, by replacing theNdeI-BamHI fragment with the annealed complementary oligonucleotides, TATGAATTCCATGAAGCTTGGATC and GATCCAAGCTTCATGGAATTCATA, to introduce the EcoRI,HindIII, and BamHI digestion sites. Plasmids pLHis-HBx, pLHis-Xm76, pLHis-Xm93, and pLHis-Xm120 were constructed by inserting the coding sequence of wild-type and each mutant HBx into theEcoRI and BamHI sites of pLHis, respectively. TheE. coli expression plasmids His6-Gal4-VP16, pFlag-Gal4-E1a, and pFlag-Gal4-p53 encode activation domains of the each transcriptional activators fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Thein vitro transcription template plasmids pG5MLP-G-less and pΔ53-MLP-G-less contain an adenovirus major late promoter (AMLP) and a G-less cassette as a reporter sequence, and the former has five Gal4 binding sites upstream of the G-less cassette as a regulatory element (41Ge H.

Plasmid pHis6-Gal4 was derived from pHis6-Gal4-VP16 by deleting the VP16 sequence by HindIII and BamHI digestion. pHis6-Gal4-HBx was constructed by inserting the HBx sequence into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pHis6-Gal4. The sequence of Gal4-VP16 was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction from pHis6-Gal4-VP16 and inserted into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pSG5UTPL to construct the mammalian expression vector pSG5UTPL-Gal-VP16. Plasmids pSG5UTPL-Gal and pSG5UTPL-Gal4-HBx were derived by deletion or replacement with the HBx coding sequence of the VP16 sequence. The HBx-responsive CAT reporter pHECx2CAT has two tandems of the HBV enhancer I core, an X-responsive element upstream of a SV40 promoter (43Murakami S. Cheong J. Ohno S. Matsushima K. Kaneko S. Virology. 1994; 199: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The pGal-CAT reporter was constructed by insertion of five Gal4 binding sites into pSV2CAT. The pGal-Luc reporter was constructed by insertion of five Gal4 binding sites and the AMLP promoter sequence into pGL3 basic vector (Promega). The Gal4 binding sites in pG5MLP-G-less were replaced with the following annealed complementary oligonucleotides, TGACTCATGACTCA and AAGGTACCTTGCTGACGCAACCCCCACTGGCTTGCTGACGCAACCCCCACTGGCGAGCTC to create plasmids pAP1MLP-G-less and pENHICMLP-G-less, which harbor two copies of AP1 binding site HBV enhancer I core, respectively. All the constructs were sequenced using Taqsequencing kits and a DNA sequencer (370A; Applied Biosystems). Histidine-tagged proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3 pLys) by 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction at 30 °C. Cells were harvested 3 h postinduction and sonicated in denaturation binding buffer (6 m guanidine chloride, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.8). Histidine-tagged proteins were purified by incubating the sonication supernatant with nickel-resin, followed by extensive washing with denaturation binding buffer and by modified denaturation washing buffer (6 m guanidine chloride, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, pH 6.0, 10 mmimidazole) and elution with denaturation elution buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, pH 4.0). The eluted proteins were renatured by dialysis with sequentially reducing concentrations of urea in dialysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.8). After dialysis in BC100 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm KCl), the proteins were divided into aliquots and stored at −80 °C. Flag-tagged Gal4-E1A and Gal-p53 were expressed in E. coliby induction for 3 h at 30 °C with 0.4 mm IPTG. Cells were harvested and sonicated in TBST buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). After centrifugation, the extracts were incubated with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2)-conjugated Sepharose 4B resin (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 6 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected and washed four times with TBST buffer followed by three elutions with 0.4 mmFLAG peptide in TBST. The eluted proteins were dialyzed in BC100, divided into aliquots, and stored at −80 °C. GST and GST-fused proteins were prepared as described previously (29Huang J. Kwong J. Sun E.C.-Y. Liang T.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5582-5591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonfused HBx was prepared by digesting GST-HBx with thrombin (29Huang J. Kwong J. Sun E.C.-Y. Liang T.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5582-5591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HBx protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and eluted from the gels. After renaturation and dialysis in BC100 buffer, HBx protein was divided into aliquots and stored at −80 °C. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (44Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) and dialyzed in BC100 buffer.In vitro transcription was carried out as described elsewhere (41Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μl of reaction mixtures contained 50 ng of pG5MLP-G-less and pΔ53-MLP-G-less supercoiled plasmid templates, 40 μg of HeLa cell nuclear extract, 0.5 mm UTP and ATP, 0.025 mm CTP, 5 μCi of [32P]CTP, 4 units of RNase T1, 0.8 unit of RNase inhibitor, 0.1 mm O-Me-GTP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 12 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.06 mm EDTA, and 12% glycerol. The reaction proceeded by incubation at 30 °C for 60 min and was stopped by addition of 175 μl of stop buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml glycogen, 100 units/ml proteinase K). After incubation at 37 °C for a further 30 min, RNA product was purified by organic extraction followed by ethanol precipitation, resolved in denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography. Signals were quantified using a Bioimage analyzer (BAS1000; Fuji). The oligonucleotide AGAATTCGGAGGACTGTCCTCCGGATCCT, which bears two Gal4 binding sites, was32P-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed with a complementary oligonucleotide to serve as a probe. Binding reactions were performed for 30 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 25 μl, containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mmKCl, 4.0 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, 8% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm poly(dI-dC), 0.2 mm EDTA, 10,000 cpm of32P-labeled probe, and 15 ng of each Gal4 derivative. The reaction mixture was resolved in 4% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrlyamide, 50:1) and visualized by autoradiography. Transfection of HepG2 cells and preparation of cell lysates were described previously (40Murakami S. Cheong J. Kaneko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15118-15123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fifty micrograms of proteins of cell lysates were fractionated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and Western blotted as described previously (24Lin Y. Nomura T. Cheong J. Dorjisuren D. Iida K. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7132-7139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Anti-HBx antibody has been described elsewhere (24Lin Y. Nomura T. Cheong J. Dorjisuren D. Iida K. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7132-7139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Anti-Gal4 DNA binding domain (DBD) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. HepG2 cells were tansfected with different combinations of plasmid DNA as indicated in the figures. Total cell lysates were prepared from cells harvested 48 h after transfection. The CAT assay reactions proceeded for 60 min at 37 °C using 20 μg of protein from the transfected cell lysates (40Murakami S. Cheong J. Kaneko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15118-15123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fractionated TLC plates were exposed to imaging plates, and CAT activities were measured as percentages of conversion to the acetylated forms of [14C]chloramphenicol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (percent acetylation) using a Bioimage analyzer (BAS1000; Fuji). Transfection and CAT assays were performed at least three times with each combination of transactivator and CAT reporter constructs. Luciferase assay was done using 5 μl of protein from the transfected cell lysates with the luciferase assay system (Promega). Representative data are shown. Having established that HBx binds to TFIIB and RPB5, and the trimeric interaction of these three factors is involved in HBx transactivation, we were interested in the role of HBx in transcriptional modulation. First, we addressed whether HBx can act as a transcriptional activator when tethered to the distal region of reporter genes. For this purpose, Gal-HBx, the Gal4 DNA binding domain fused to the N terminus of HBx, was constructed. The effect of Gal-HBx on the expression of Gal-CAT, a CAT reporter with a SV40 promoter driven by five Gal4-binding sites, was determined in transiently transfected HepG2 cells by CAT assay. Gal4 DNA binding domain, Gal, and the Gal-fused VP16 activation domain, Gal-VP16, served as negative and positive controls, respectively. Gal-VP16 markedly activated the expression of Gal-CAT (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2–5), whereas Gal has no effect on reporter gene expression (lanes 6–9), indicating that the transient transfection and CAT assay are suitable for this functional assay. Unexpectedly, Gal-HBx also did not activate the reporter (lanes 10–13). The inability of Gal-HBx to activate the expression of Gal-CAT was not because of low levels of expression or instability of Gal-HBx protein since Gal-HBx and HBx were expressed at similar levels in the transfected cells (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 1 and 2). As we reproducibly detected no activity of Gal-HBx with various amounts of transfected plasmid DNA (data not shown), the possibility of self-squelching as seen with other transcriptional factors was unlikely (45Liu X. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6474-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 46Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). Importantly, Gal-HBx exhibited transactivation activity upon reporters harboring XRE, indicating that Gal-HBx was correctly folded and functionally active in the transfected cells (Fig. 1 C, lanes 11–13). It was less likely that Gal-HBx bound to the reporter DNA inefficiently since Gal-HBx repressed the activation by Gal-VP16 in a dose-dependent manner, similarly to Gal-DB competing the Gal4-responsive element (Fig. 1 D, lanes 10–12, and data not shown). These results indicated that HBx cannot act as a transcriptional activator when artificially tethered to the promoter. We next investigated whether HBx functions as a co-activator to facilitate activated transcription using the same system as described in Fig. 1 A. HBx alone did not activate CAT activity (Fig. 1 D, lanes 2–4), indicating that HBx does not affect basal transcription. This is consistent with the previous observation that HBx transactivation is distalcis-element-dependent (43Murakami S. Cheong J. Ohno S. Matsushima K. Kaneko S. Virology. 1994; 199: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 47Seto E. Mitchell P.J. Yen T.S. Nature. 1990; 344: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of HBx augmented CAT activity dose-dependently in the presence Gal-VP16 (Fig. 1 D, lanes 5–7). This was not the result of an indirect effect of co-transfection, since co-transfection of control plasmids exhibited no influence on CAT activity (see Fig. 5 A, and data not shown). Since comparable amounts of Gal-VP16 were detected by Western blot analysis regardless of the presence of HBx, elevation of the Gal-VP16 expression level due to transactivation by HBx was unlikely (Fig. 1 E). These results indicated that HBx could act as a transcriptional co-activator but not an activator. Since the in vivo experiment was somewhat indirect, it is important to confirm these observations in a cell-free system. We used an in vitro transcription with supercoiled plasmid pG5MLP-G-less, containing five Gal4 binding sites as a template (41Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). pMLPΔ53-G-less plasmid DNA, with no Gal4 binding sites, was included as a control of basal transcription. All of the basal transcription factors were provided by HeLa cell nuclear extract. Histidine-tagged Gal-HBx, Gal-VP16, and Gal4-DNA binding domain (Gal) were expressed in and purified from E. coli (Fig. 2 A). As shown in Fig. 2 B, under our experimental conditions, 15 and 30 ng of Gal-VP16 activated transcription from pG5MLP-G-less by 2- and 4-fold, respectively. However, similar to Gal alone, Gal-HBx did not stimulate transcription. Similar DNA binding abilities of Gal-HBx and Gal-VP16 were detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a probe containing two Gal4 binding sites, suggesting that the bacterially expressed proteins were correctly folded and functionally active (Fig. 2 C). These results confirmed the in vivoobservation that Gal-HBx could not act as a transcriptional activator when tethered to DNA. We next tested the co-activator activity of HBx using the same in vitro transcription system. When histidine-tagged HBx was added to the reaction together with Gal-VP16, augmented transcription was observed. The co-activation by HBx was dose-dependent (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4 and 5), whereas the negative controls, GST and bovine serum albumin, had no effect on transcription (lanes 6 and 7, and data not shown). To confirm this result, nonfused HBx protein derived from digestion of GST-HBx was also tested in vitro. Similar to histidine-tagged HBx, the nonfused HBx co-activated transcriptional activation by Gal-VP16 (Fig. 3 B). GST-HBx also co-activated transcriptional activation by Gal-VP16, although to a lesser extent (data not shown). These results clearly demonstrated that HBx acts as a co-activator facilitating activated transcription by Gal-VP16. To examine whether the co-activation by HBx is a general effect, we tested the effects of HBx on transcriptional activation by other transcriptional activators. Gal-p53, a protein consisting of Gal4-DNA binding domain fused to two tandem repeats of the p53 activation domain, and Gal-E1a, a Gal4-DNA binding domain fused to adenovirus E1a activation domain, were examined. The p53 activation domain, similar to VP16, is an acidic activator, whereas E1a is a nonacidic activator (48Blau J. Xiao H. McCracken S. O'hare P. Greenblatt J. Bentley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2044-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, HBx stimulated both Gal-p53- and Gal-E1a-activated transcription in vitro. Similar co-activation was also detected in vivo (data not shown). Since HBx co-activated transcriptional activation by different groups of activators, this protein seems to be a general co-activator at least of acidic and nonacidic transcriptional activators. We previously reported that HBx consists of a functional transactivation (51–148 amino acids) and a regulatory (1–50 amino acids) domains (40Murakami S. Cheong J. Kaneko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15118-15123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase assay showed that the HBx co-activation activity resided in the transactivation (HBx-5D1) but not the regulatory domain (HBx-3D5) of HBx (Fig. 5 A). This suggested that the HBx transactivation observed in vivo may have been due to a co-transactivator function. To examine this possibility, we investigated whether the RPB5 and TFIIB interactions, which are necessary for HBx transactivation, are crucial in HBx co-activation by Gal-VP16. To this end, we chose Xm93 and Xm120, which have reduced binding abilities with RPB5 and TFIIB, respectively (24Lin Y. Nomura T. Cheong J. Dorjis"

Western blot analysis showed that these cells express three of the four Gq class subunits, Gαq, Gα11, and Gα14 but not Gα15. Surprisingly, all parameters of Ca2+signaling were identical in cells from wild type and four lines of mutant mice: 1) Gα11−/−, 2) Gα11−/−/Gα14−/−, 3) Gα14−/−/Gα15−/−, and 4) Gαq−/−/Gα15−/−. These parameters included the K app for several Gq class coupled receptors, induction of [Ca2+]ioscillations by weak stimulation, and a biphasic [Ca2+]i response by strong stimulation. Furthermore, Ca2+ release from internal stores and Ca2+ entry were not affected in cells from any of the mutant mice. We conclude that Gαq, Gα11, and Gα14 promiscuously couple several receptors (m3 muscarinic, bombesin, cholecystokinin, and α1 adrenergic) to effector proteins that activate both Ca2+ release from internal stores and Ca2+ entry.

Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) based on sequence comparisons and functional similarities of the α subunits within each class. For example, Gs class α subunits stimulate adenylyl cyclase to generate cAMP, whereas Gq class α subunits stimulate PLCβ1 to generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and mobilize Ca2+from internal stores (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4714) Google Scholar, 3Gudermann T. Schoneberg T. Schultz G. Annu. Rev.

A. 1993; 90: 10439-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The Gi class α subunits regulate a more diverse set of effector proteins (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4714) Google Scholar), but signaling transduced by any of these proteins (with the exception of Gαz) is inhibited by pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4714) Google Scholar, 4Muller S. Hekman M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10439-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). An effector protein of Gα13 (in the G12 class) was recently identified as p115 RhoGEF (9Hart M.J Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Thus, each class of Gα subunit has a unique role in regulating downstream effector proteins. Signaling specificity among α subunits of the same class that have similar biochemical functions is not well understood in vivo. The Gq class includes four proteins expressed in mammals, termed Gαq, Gα11, Gα14, and Gα15/16 (8Wilkie T.M. Gilbert D.J. Olsen A.S. Chen X.-N. Amatruda T.T. Korenberg J.R. Trask B.J. de Jong P. Reed R.R. Simon M.I. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Orthologs of Gαq, Gα11, and Gα14 expressed in human, mouse, cow, and dog are highly conserved (99, 97, and 96% identity, respectively), whereas paralogs of these Gq class genes (expressed in the same species) are less well conserved (10Davignon I. Barnard M. Gavrilova O. Sweet K. Wilkie T.M. Genomics. 1996; 31: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This pattern of evolutionary conservation suggests that different Gq genes have distinct functions. However, reconstituted systems using recombinant proteins expressed in Sf9 cells showed that Gαq, Gα11, and Gα14 stimulated PLCβ activity with similar potency (11Nakamura F. Kato M. Kameyama K. Nukada T. Haga T. Kato H. Takenawa T. Kikkawa U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6246-6253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These Gq class proteins also had similar activities in transfected tissue culture cells (12Lee C.H. Park D. Wu D. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16044-16047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These apparent functional similarities are of interest because many cells express at least two and sometimes three members of the Gq class α subunits (3Gudermann T. Schoneberg T. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Neurosi. 1997; 20: 399-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 13Wilkie T.M. Schele P.A. Strathmann M.P. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci . U. S.

Indeed, photolabeling with GTP azidoanilide showed that a single receptor type can simultaneously couple two different Gq class α subunits within the same cell (15Allgeier A. Offermanns S.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1697-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To address questions of signaling specificity among Gq class α subunits, antisense oligonucleotides that targeted either Gαq or Gα11 mRNA for degradation were injected into the nucleus of RBL-2H3 cells that overexpressed the m1 muscarinic receptor. These studies suggested that coupling of both Gαq and Gα11 was required for stimulation of PLCβ and generation of a Ca2+ signal (6Dippel E. Kalkbrenner F. Wittig B. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The same approach was used in portal vein myocytes to conclude that α1 adrenergic receptor stimulation of Gαq leads to Ca2+ release from internal stores, whereas stimulation of Gα11 was required for activation of store-operated Ca2+entry (19Macrez-Lepretre N. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Mironneu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5261-5268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results suggested that Gαq and Gα11 coupled the same receptor type to stimulate distinct functions in smooth muscle cells. The role of Gαq has also been assessed in transgenic mice by expression of RNA antisense to Gαq in liver and white adipose tissue (20Galvin-Parton P.A. Chen X. Moxham C.M. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4335-4341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Gαq deficiency induced in these tissues at birth increased body mass and hyperadiposity within 5 weeks that persisted throughout adulthood. We have altered expression of each of the four Gq class genes by another means, using gene targeting in embryonic stem cells to produce homozygous deficiencies in mice (21Offermanns S. Hashimoto K. Watanabe M. Sun W. Kurihara H. Thompson R.F. Inoue Y. Kano M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14089-14094Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 22Offermanns S. Zhao L-P. Gohla A. Sarosi I. Simon M.I. Wilkie T.M. EMBO. J. 1998; 17: 4304-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Each of the single knockout mice are viable and fertile. The most dramatic phenotypic defect was observed in Gαq−/− mice, which are ataxic and have a bleeding disorder caused by a platelet aggregation defect (21Offermanns S. Hashimoto K. Watanabe M. Sun W. Kurihara H. Thompson R.F. Inoue Y. Kano M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14089-14094Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 23Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the growth of Gαq−/− mice is retarded relative to wild type litter mates, in contrast to increased body mass observed in transgenic mice expressing antisense Gαq in specific tissues (20Galvin-Parton P.A. Chen X. Moxham C.M. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4335-4341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Knockout mice were also used to begin an analysis of the shared and separate functions of Gαq and Gα11 during development. Fetuses with homozygous deficiencies of both Gαq and Gα11 (Gαq−/−, Gα11−/−) die during embryogenesis about 11 days post-coitum (22Offermanns S. Zhao L-P. Gohla A. Sarosi I. Simon M.I. Wilkie T.M. EMBO. J. 1998; 17: 4304-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Expression of a single wild type copy of either Gαq or Gα11 allows continued embryonic development, but neonatal pups die within an hour of birth (22Offermanns S. Zhao L-P. Gohla A. Sarosi I. Simon M.I. Wilkie T.M. EMBO. J. 1998; 17: 4304-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These results indicate that Gαq and Gα11 can each compensate for a deficiency in the other during development. In the present work we used gene knockouts of Gq class α subunits in mice to re-evaluate the specificity of receptor coupling and their subsequent regulation of defined Ca2+ transport pathways in pancreatic and submandibular gland cells. These cells express three Gq class α subunits, Gαq, Gα11, and Gα14. We found that all aspects of Ca2+ signaling were identical in cells from WT and all mutant mice, including Gα11−/−/Gα14−/− and Gαq−/−/Gα15−/− double knockouts. We conclude that the receptors examined in the present work (m3 muscarinic, bombesin, cholecystokinin, and α1 adrenergic) display promiscuity of coupling to Gq class α subunits and effector proteins that regulate all aspects of the Ca2+ signal in pancreatic and submandibular gland cells. Mutant mice deficient in Gαq, Gα11, Gα14, and Gα15 were produced as detailed before (21Offermanns S. Hashimoto K. Watanabe M. Sun W. Kurihara H. Thompson R.F. Inoue Y. Kano M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl.

J. 1998; 17: 4304-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Briefly, the murine genes were disrupted by homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells. Targeting vectors were designed to replace specific exons with several translation termination codons present in the reverse orientation of the neomycin phosphotransferase gene. None of the targeted Gα proteins were detected in tissues from the corresponding homozygous null mutant mice (21Offermanns S. Hashimoto K. Watanabe M. Sun W. Kurihara H. Thompson R.F. Inoue Y.

J. 1998; 17: 4304-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The lines of knockout mice used in this study are viable and fertile. Gα11−/−/Gα14−/−, Gα14−/−/Gα15−/−, and Gαq−/−/Gα15−/− double homozygous null mice were obtained from intercrossing the offspring of the single knockout mice. Two strains of double homozygous null mice were not available for this study. Gαq−/−/Gα11−/− mice could not be obtained as they die during embryogenesis (21Offermanns S. Hashimoto K. Watanabe M. Sun W. Kurihara H. Thompson R.F. Inoue Y. Kano M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14089-14094Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and Gαq−/−/Gα14−/− mice have not been obtained from intercrossing of the single knockouts because the genes are tandemly duplicated on mouse chromosome 19 (8Wilkie T.M. Gilbert D.J. Olsen A.S. Chen X.-N. Amatruda T.T. Korenberg J.R. Trask B.J. de Jong P. Reed R.R. Simon M.I. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and are thus too close together to expect recombination to place both null mutations on the same chromosome. All WT and mutant mice were of 129/SvEv × C57BL/6 genetic background. Membrane proteins collected from the indicated tissues were assayed for expression of Gαq, Gα11, Gα14, and Gα15 in WT and knockout mice by Western blot as described (24Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 191-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In all experiments membrane proteins isolated from tissues that express abundant amounts of a given Gq α subunit were included as positive controls; Gαq and Gα11 (brain), Gα14 (testis), and Gα15 (spleen; results not shown, but see Refs. 13Wilkie T.M.

Pancreatic acini and submandibular gland (SMG) duct and acini were prepared by standard collagenase digestion procedures as described (25Xu X. Diaz J. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Xu X. Diaz J. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 491: 647-662Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The cells were suspended in solution A containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose. The cells were kept on ice until use. Pancreatic and SMG cells from WT and knockout mice were incubated in solution A containing 5 μm Fura 2/AM for 20–30 min at 37 °C, washed twice with solution A, and kept on ice until use. The cells were plated on glass coverslips that formed the bottom of a perfusion chamber and were allowed to attach during a 2-min incubation at room temperature before the start of perfusion. The cells were continuously perfused during fluorescence recording with solution A or, as indicated, CaCl2-deficient solution A that contained 0.1 mm EGTA (Ca2+-free). Fluorescence was recorded with an image acquisition system from Photon Technology International. The image ratios, recorded at excitation wavelengths of 355 and 380 nm, were calibrated and analyzed exactly as described (25Xu X. Diaz J. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Xu X. Diaz J. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 491: 647-662Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Potency of agonist stimulation (K app) in pancreatic acini from WT and mutant mice was evaluated from the effect on [Ca2+]i of five agonist concentrations expected to be below, at, and above the EC50. Separate preparations of pancreatic acini from WT and each of the mutant mice (see Table I) were used in each experiment to obtain between 2 and 6 estimates of K app for each of the agonists used. At each agonist concentration [Ca2+]i was analyzed from at least 5 acinar clusters composed of 8–15 cells and 3–5 individual cells that were present in the same recording field. Initially [Ca2+]i was analyzed in individual cells and individual clusters to examine cell to cell and cluster to cluster variations. No striking differences were noted between the responses of individual cells or acini from the different mice. Therefore the results from all cells and clusters of common genotype in each experiment were combined at each agonist concentration. These combined results were used to determine the average increase in [Ca2+]i caused by any agonist concentration. Because low concentrations of agonists usually induce [Ca2+]i oscillations, whose frequency and sometimes amplitude depends on agonist concentration (2Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar), independent verification of K app was obtained by measuring the lag time to the first noted increase in [Ca2+]i. Previous studies showed that the lag time to the first response depends on agonist concentration (27Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The combined responses to all concentrations of a given agonist were displayed on an expanded time scale, and the lag time was taken as the time between the agonist entering the perfusion chamber and the time [Ca2+]i started to increase. The time of agonist entry into the chamber was obtained by subtracting the dead volume of the perfusion line from the time of solution changes. Peak [Ca2+]i or decreasing lag time were plotted as a function of agonist concentration, and K appvalues were determined by fitting the results to a Hill equation of the formTable IKapp for carbachol, bombesin, and CCK to induce [Ca2+]i increase in pancreatic acini of WT and mutant miceAgonistK appWTGα11−/−Gα11−/−/Gα14−/−Gαq−/−/Gα15−/−Carbachol (μm)5.73 ± 0.26 (4)6.03 ± 0.31 (3)5.5/6.7 (2)5.44 ± 0.46 (6)Bombesin (nm)1.24 ± 0.07 (4)1.11 ± 0.10 (3)1.05/1.3 (2)1.42 ± 0.13 (3)CCK (nm)0.27 ± 0.01 (4)0.25 ± 0.01 (3)0.22/0.24 (2)0.29 ± 0.01 (6)Pancreatic acini from WT and mutant mice were loaded with Fura 2 and used to measure the effect of several concentrations of the agonists listed in Table I on [Ca2+]i.

Analysis of variance showed no significant difference in the K app between WT and mutant mice for any of the agonists. Cells from these WT and mutant mice were also used to evaluate the extent of Ca2+release and Ca2+ entry using the protocol illustrated in Fig. 3. No differences were found among pancreatic acini from WT and all mutant mice, including cells from the Gα11−/−/Gα14−/− double knockout mice, which only express Gαq.

Y =Y max(x n/(K appn+ x n)) where Y max is the extrapolated maximal [Ca2+]i increase or minimal lag time, x is the agonist concentration, and nis the Hill coefficient. K app determined from the [Ca2+]i increase and lag time agreed very well (within 10% for a given experiment) and were used to obtain an average value for each experiment. The values obtained from all experiments using separate acinar preparations were used to calculate the mean +/− S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated by analysis of variance. Expression of Gq class α subunits in the mouse pancreas and SMG was determined by Western blot analysis using antisera raised against peptide sequences unique to each of the four proteins (24Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 191-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that Gαq, Gα11, and Gα14 were the predominant Gq class α subunits expressed in the pancreas and SMG of WT mice. Pancreatic acini expressed higher levels of Gα14 than SMG cells, whereas SMG cells expressed higher levels of Gαq and Gα11. Gα15 was either too low to be detected or was not expressed in either cell type. Furthermore, Western analysis showed that Gαq was equally abundant in WT, Gα11−/−, Gα14−/−, and Gα15−/− pancreas and SMG cells and, as expected, was absent from Gαq−/− cells. Similarly, expression of other Gq class α subunits was absent in the corresponding knockout mice. Single knockout mice were bred to generate the double knockout lines that could be obtained, Gα11−/−/Gα14−/−, Gα14−/−/Gα15−/−, and Gαq−/−/Gα15−/−. It is important to note in the single and double knockout mice that expression of the normal Gq class genes was unaltered relative to WT mice (21Offermanns S. Hashimoto K. Watanabe M. Sun W. Kurihara H. Thompson R.F. Inoue Y. Kano M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14089-14094Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 22Offermanns S. Zhao L-P. Gohla A. Sarosi I. Simon M.I. Wilkie T.M. EMBO. J. 1998; 17: 4304-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For example, in pancreatic acini and SMG cells of the Gα11−/−/Gα14−/− mice, Gαq was expressed at normal levels and was the only Gq class α subunit available to couple receptors activated by the various agonists that were used. These mice, together with the Gαq−/−/Gα15−/− and the single knockout mice, allow clear analysis of specialized functions of Gαq, Gα11, and Gα14 in Ca2+ signaling. Previous reports using an antisense oligonucleotide approach (6Dippel E. Kalkbrenner F. Wittig B. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 19Macrez-Lepretre N. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Mironneu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5261-5268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) would predict that deletion of either Gαq or Gα11 would be sufficient to reduce or eliminate Ca2+ signaling by receptors coupled to Gq class proteins. That this was not likely to be the case was evident from the mild phenotype of each single knockout line (21Offermanns S. Hashimoto K. Watanabe M. Sun W. Kurihara H. Thompson R.F. Inoue Y. Kano M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14089-14094Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 22Offermanns S. Zhao L-P. Gohla A. Sarosi I. Simon M.I. Wilkie T.M. EMBO. J. 1998; 17: 4304-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for the promiscuous coupling of receptors to different Gq class α subunits was obtained by measuring the Ca2+ response of pancreatic acini to stimulation of three distinct receptors. Fig. 2 shows representative examples of cell responses to weak and intense agonist stimulation. Weak stimulation with low agonist concentration commonly evokes [Ca2+]i oscillations in virtually all cell types (2Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar), including pancreatic acini (28Muallem S. Putney Jr., J.W. Advances in Second Messenger and Phosphoprotein Research: Inositolphosphates and Calcium Signaling. 26. Raven Press, NY1992: 351-358Google Scholar, 29Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 448: 1-51Crossref Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Figs. 2, a–d, shows that stimulation with 0.25 nm bombesin induced similar [Ca2+]i oscillations in acini from WT and all mutant mice. [Ca2+]i oscillations were also induced by low concentrations of carbachol and CCK8 (not shown). A typical biphasic response to intense stimulation with 10 nmCCK8 is shown in Figs. 2, e–h. Again, the response to CCK8 was similar in acini from all mice (Fig. 2), and similar responses were recorded in acini from all mice stimulated with 1 mmcarbachol or 0.1 μm bombesin (not shown). Hence, the pattern of the [Ca2+]i responses at low and high agonist concentrations were not altered by deletion of any of the indicated single or pairs of Gq class α subunits. This indicates that (a) all three receptors can productively couple to Gαq, Gα11, and/or Gα14 and (b) receptor-dependent activation of each α subunit equally activated all components of the Ca2+ signal downstream of the α subunits. A rigorous test of the specificity and strength of coupling between receptors and α subunits can be obtained by measuring the apparent affinity (K app) for a given agonist. Therefore, pancreatic acini from WT and the mutant mice were used to estimateK app for each of the agonists.K app was determined by measuring the effect of at least five concentrations of carbachol between 1 and 100 μm, bombesin between 0.1 and 300 nm, and CCK8 between 0.01 and 10 nm, which covered the entire range of effective concentrations for each agonist. At least five acinar clusters were used to estimate the averaged [Ca2+]i increase at each agonist concentration. As can be seen from the results in Table I, the K app for all agonists remained the same in all mutant mice. In all cases the absolute increase in [Ca2+]i evoked by each agonist was the same as that measured in acini from WT mice (see also Fig. 3). Many tissues and cell types express both Gαq and Gα11. Expression of Gα14 and Gα15 is more restricted (13Wilkie T.M. Schele P.A. Strathmann M.P. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci . U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10049-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The cells used in the present studies express Gαq, Gα11, and Gα14 at high levels. However, deletion of Gα14 alone or in combination with other Gq class α subunits did not produce dramatic phenotypic abnormalities, nor does it affect Ca2+ signaling in the exocrine pancreas or SMG. Therefore, Gα14 apparently does not have a novel function in regulating Ca2+ signaling evoked by the agonist we have used. These findings are similar to those obtained with the antisense approach, in which suppression of Gα14 expression had no effect on Ca2+ signaling evoked by the m1 muscarinic (6Dippel E. Kalkbrenner F. Wittig B. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and the α1 adrenergic (19Macrez-Lepretre N. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Mironneu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5261-5268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) receptors. If Gα14 has a role in Ca2+ signaling distinct from Gαq and Gα11, it remains to be determined. Gα14 presumably mediates Ca2+signaling in the tissues where it is abundantly expressed, including the exocrine pancreas, SMG gland, kidney, testis, and ovary (13Wilkie T.M. Schele P.A.

Wilkie T.M. EMBO. J. 1998; 17: 4304-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Our results indicate promiscuity of receptor coupling to Gαq, Gα11, and/or Gα14. These findings are quite different from those reported using antisense oligonucleotides to suppress the expression of specific Gq class α subunits (6Dippel E. Kalkbrenner F. Wittig B. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 19Macrez-Lepretre N. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Mironneu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5261-5268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In these studies, suppression of Gαq or Gα11 alone was as efficient as suppression of both subunits in inhibiting Ca2+ signaling. A possible explanation for the different effects obtained by the two approaches may be the extent to which active Gq class α subunits are removed by the two techniques. Preliminary results with embryonic cells from mutant mice that did not express Gαq and Gα11 or expressed only one copy of either gene showed that Ca2+ signaling in response to angiotensin II was absent in embryonic cardiomyocytes from double knockout mice and significantly reduced (but not absent) in cells containing only one active allele of either gene (22Offermanns S. Zhao L-P. Gohla A. Sarosi I. Simon M.I. Wilkie T.M. EMBO. J. 1998; 17: 4304-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Signaling in cells with two or more active copies of Gαq and/or Gα11 was apparently normal. This may suggest that cells express a 2–3-fold excess Gq class α subunits capable of promiscuous coupling to receptors that activate PLCβ, but only part of this Gq class α subunit pool is active at any time. Application of antisense oligonucleotides for two days may have depleted the targeted pool but not allowed sufficient time to activate the pool of α subunits held in reserve. In the mutant mice we have analyzed, all active receptors may be coupled by the remaining Gq class α subunits, but the inactive pool of Gα may be diminished. Alternatively, signaling specificity may be different in smooth muscle and secretory gland cells. However, we did not observe defects in smooth muscle function in vivo in Gq class knockout mice. For example, blood pressure in Gα11−/− mice is normal. 2T. Ohuci, K. Yu, T. Wilkie, and M. Yangisawa, unpublished observation. Independent of the reason for discrepancies between knockout and antisense approaches, our results strongly suggest that Gαq, Gα11, and Gα14 promiscuously couple several receptors to the effector and regulatory proteins that mediate Ca2+ signaling. Another aspect of specificity in Gq class-mediated signaling that we examined was the activation of specific Ca2+ transport pathways by certain Gq class α subunits. Previous studies (19Macrez-Lepretre N. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Mironneu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5261-5268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) used cells expressing α1 adrenergic receptors to examine the role of the Gq class α subunits in Ca2+ signaling. Therefore, our initial experiments to analyze Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry were performed with SMG duct and acinar cells because they also express the α1 adrenergic receptor. Furthermore, Ca2+-mobilizing agonists cause a marked activation of Ca2+ influx in SMG cells (26Xu X. Diaz J. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 491: 647-662Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 30Valdez I.H. Turner J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G359-G363PubMed Google Scholar, 31Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Lau K.S. Gukovskaya A.C.

Fig. 3shows the biphasic response of SMG duct and acinar cells from WT and mutant mice to maximal stimulation with epinephrine or carbachol, respectively. Table II summarizes the effect of these agonists on the peak and plateau increases in [Ca2+]i. Epinephrine stimulation of duct cells and carbachol stimulation of acinar cells are the most potent Ca2+-mobilizing agonists acting on these cells (26Xu X. Diaz J. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 491: 647-662Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 30Valdez I.H. Turner J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G359-G363PubMed Google Scholar,31Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Lau K.S. Gukovskaya A.C.

It is clear that Ca2+ release from internal stores (initial peak) and Ca2+ influx (plateau) were the same in cells from WT and all mutant mice. Removal and re-addition of Ca2+ to the incubation medium further emphasized the similar extent of Ca2+ entry and the similarity of all other aspects of Ca2+ signaling in WT and mutant mice. Acinar cells from these preparations that were present in the same recording field as duct cells also responded to α1adrenergic stimulation with partial depletion of Ca2+stores and showed identical profiles of Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry between cells from WT or mutant mice (not shown). Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry were also examined in pancreatic acinar cells using the protocol described above. We could not detect any differences in the kinetics or extent of Ca2+ release or Ca2+entry between pancreatic acini from WT or mutant mice (see legend to Table I).Table IIAgonist-mediated Ca2+ release and Ca2+ influx in SMG cells from WT and mutant miceAgonistWT[Ca2+]iGα11−/−Gα14−/−/Gα15−/−Gαq−/−/Gα15−/−nmEpinephrine (duct)peak709 ± 63724 ± 58715 ± 74696 ± 67plateau287 ± 24315 ± 33304 ± 28321 ± 38Carbachol (acini)peak824 ± 66818 ± 71844 ± 73810 ± 86plateau335 ± 38354 ± 42348 ± 28342 ± 33SMG duct and acinar cells loaded with Fura 2 were stimulated with 10 μm epinephrine or 1 mm carbachol, and the ratio images of at least 3 ducts and 3 acinar clusters present in the same field were recorded.

The results are the mean ±S.E. of at least 4 separate experiments with cells from 2–4 animals in each group. The results presented in Fig. 3 and Table II reveal another discrepancy between depleting Gq class α subunits by injecting antisense oligonucleotides (19Macrez-Lepretre N. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Mironneu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5261-5268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and gene knockouts. Suppression of Gα11 with antisense oligonucleotides had no effect on Ca2+ release from internal stores but completely eliminated Ca2+ entry stimulated by α1 adrenergic receptors (19Macrez-Lepretre N. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Mironneu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5261-5268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). By contrast, depletion of Gαq completely inhibited Ca2+ release from internal stores, whereas epinephrine-stimulated Ca2+ entry remained intact (19Macrez-Lepretre N. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Mironneu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5261-5268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This would suggest that Gαq regulates Ca2+ release, and Gα11 directly activates the Ca2+ influx pathway. However, our results and previous studies using different approaches (11Nakamura F. Kato M. Kameyama K. Nukada T. Haga T. Kato H. Takenawa T. Kikkawa U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6246-6253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Lee C.H. Park D. Wu D. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16044-16047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrate that Gα11 activates PLCβ. Furthermore, all parameters of Ca2+signaling were identical in WT, Gαq−/−, and Gα11−/−/Gα14−/− mice, thus excluding a novel function for Gα11 in signal transduction evoked by the agonists that were used. Hence, our findings indicate that receptor-dependent activation of Gαq or Gα11 similarly activates PLCβ to generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, release Ca2+ from internal stores, and activate Ca2+ entry. This does not exclude the possibility that the Ca2+ influx pathway is also directly or indirectly regulated by G protein α subunits. Our previous work showed that constitutively active Gαq-regulated Ca2+ influx is downstream of Ca2+ release (32Xu X. Kitamura K. Lau K.S. Muallem S. Miller R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29169-29175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mammalian channel related to Drosophila trp appears to be directly activated by Gα11 (33Obukhov A.G. Harteneck C. Zobel A. Harhammer R. Kalkbrenner F. Leopold D. Luckhoff A. Nurnberg B. Schultz G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5833-5838Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, if Gq class α subunits regulate Ca2+ influx, our results clearly show that all members of the class can equally regulate the pathway. In summary, we used gene knockouts in mice to show that Gq class α subunits promiscuously couple several different receptors in three cell types. Pancreatic acini (25Xu X. Diaz J. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and SMG cells (34Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F.

It is clear from the present work that the identity of the Gq class α subunit does not determine the receptor-specific pattern of Ca2+ waves. This highlights the importance of our recent observation that RGS4 inhibits Ca2+ signaling in a receptor-specific manner (35Zeng, W., Xu, X., Popov, S., Mukhopadhyay, S., Chidiac, P., Swistok, J., Danho, K., Yagaloff, K., Fisher, S., Ross, E.

https://openalex.org/W2002251355,"The role of the highly conserved residues in the γ-phosphate binding site of myosin upon myosin motor function was studied. Each of five residues (Ser181, Lys185, Asn235, Ser236, and Arg238) in smooth muscle myosin was mutated. K185Q has neither a steady state ATPase nor an initial Pi burst. Although ATP and actin bind to K185Q, it is not dissociated from actin by ATP. These results indicate that the hydrolysis of bound ATP by K185Q is inhibited. S236T has nearly normal basal Mg2+-ATPase activity, initial Pi burst, ATP-induced enhancement of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, and ATP-induced dissociation from actin. However, the actin activation of the Mg2+-ATPase activity and actin translocation of S236T were blocked. In contrast S236A has nearly normal enzymatic properties and actin-translocating activity. These results indicate that 1) the hydroxyl group of Ser236 is not critical as an intermediary of proton transfer during the ATP hydrolysis step, and 2) the bulk of the extra methyl group of the threonine residue in S236T blocks the acceleration of product release from the active site by actin. Arg238, which interacts with Glu459 at the Switch II region, was mutated to Lys and Ile, respectively. R238K has essentially normal enzymatic activity and motility. In contrast, R238I does not hydrolyze ATP or support motility, although it still binds ATP. These results indicate that the charge interaction between Glu459 and Arg238 is critical for ATP hydrolysis by myosin. Other mutants, S181A, S181T, and N235I, showed nearly normal enzymatic and motile activity."

The first differentiation event in mammalian development gives rise to the trophectoderm, which in turn initiates implantation and undergoes regional differentiation to generate different trophoblast cells (1Billington W.D.

Trophoblast cells are a group of specialized extra-embryonic cells that play a leading role in the implantation and placentation processes (3Pijnenborg R. Robertson W.B. Brosens I. Dixon G.

They express metalloproteinases to invade the maternal deciduum, secrete hormones to coordinate pregnancy, form a barrier to prevent immune response from the mother, and provide the embryo access to the maternal blood circulation. These diverse functions are achieved by different subsets of trophoblast cells during development. In the mouse placenta, there are at least three terminally differentiated trophoblast cell types, trophoblast giant cells lining the maternal fetal interface, spongiotrophoblast cells of the junctional zone, and syncytiotrophoblast cells of the labyrinthine zone (5Soares M.J. Chapman B.M. Rasmussen C.A. Dai G. Kamei T. Orwig K.E. Placenta. 1996; 17: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 6Ansell J.D. Balls M. Wild A.E. The Early Development of Mammals. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1975: 107-144Google Scholar). In humans, abnormalities in trophoblast cells are often associated with pregnancy-related diseases, causing severe consequences to both the mother and the fetus (7Bischof P. Campana A. Early Pregnancy. 1997; 3: 81-95PubMed Google Scholar). Identification and elucidation of genes that play a primary role in the regulation of placenta-specific gene expression is fundamental to understanding the development of the placenta and its associated diseases. Adenosine deaminase (ADA)1 is a purine metabolic enzyme that is enriched in trophoblast cells of the mouse placenta and is essential for proper fetal development (8Blackburn M.R. Kellems R.E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 55: 195-226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in ADA-deficient mice have demonstrated that the absence of ADA in the trophoblast cells is associated with perinatal lethality (9Wakamiya M. Blackburn M.R. Jurecic R. McArthur M.J.

Furthermore, genetically restoring ADA specifically to trophoblast cells rescued ADA-deficient fetuses from perinatal lethality, verifying the importance of trophoblast ADA for normal fetal development (11Blackburn M.R.

ADA is first seen in the primary trophoblast giant cells surrounding the gestation site and diploid cells in the ectoplacental cone. Subsequently, the level of Ada expression increases as the diploid trophoblast cells grow and differentiate. In the mature placenta, ADA is enriched in all trophoblast cells with highest level of expression found in the spongiotrophoblast cells of the junctional zone. The expression pattern and functional importance of ADA in the placenta make it a good model to identify transcription factors important in trophoblast gene expression. The temporal and spatial information for Ada expression in trophoblast cells resides in a 770-bp sequence located 5.4 kilobase pairs upstream of the Ada transcription start site (16Winston J.H.

Within this region, there are binding sites for transcription factors including bHLH and GATA factors. Recently, two bHLH factors, Mash-2 and Hand1, have been identified in the mouse placenta (18Johnson J.E. Birren S.J. Anderson D.J.

In addition, GATA-2 and GATA-3 are involved in the regulation of the mouse placental lactogen I and the human chorionic gonadotropin gene expression in trophoblast cells (24Ng Y.K. George K.M.

Possible involvement of bHLH and GATA factors in the regulation of Ada expression in trophoblast cells was supported by deletion and mutational analysis (17Shi D. Winston J.H. Blackburn M.R.

Meanwhile, DNase I footprinting of the 770-bp placental regulatory element revealed three protein-binding regions, one of which was placenta-specific. Here we report a detailed analysis of the placenta-specific footprinting region (FP1), and we provide biochemical and genetic evidence that an AP-2 transcription factor regulates Ada expression in the placenta through its interaction with FP1. Furthermore, we find AP-2γ is the most abundant AP-2 factor in the placenta. The expression pattern of AP-2γ during placental development suggests that AP-2γ may be an important member in the transcription factor cascade that controls trophoblast differentiation. DNA fragments containing FP1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the plasmid p0.77PCAT using the following primers, CTATGGATCCGAGGAAACAGCGGCTCT and AGCTGCAGAGTACAGATGGTC. The polymerase chain reaction products were cut by BamHI and PstI and subcloned into Bluescript KS vectors (Stratagene) resulting in pFP1. The nucleotide sequence of pFP1 was confirmed by sequence analysis using the Sequenase 2.0 kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Plasmids pAP-2α and pAP-2β were generated by subcloning AP-2α and β cDNAs intoEcoRI and HindIII sites of Bluescript KS II vectors. Plasmid pAP-2γ (pAP-2.2) contained AP-2γ cDNA at theEcoRI site of Bluescript SK vector. Nuclear extracts were prepared from placentas and adult livers of mid-gestation ICR mice as described (17Shi D.

For DNase I footprinting, pFP1 was cut with either BamHI orEcoRI. After dephosphorylation, DNA was digested with eitherEcoRI or BamHI and purified from agarose gels. The fragments were end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP. Equal amounts of radioactive probes were used in footprinting as described (17Shi D. Winston J.H. Blackburn M.R.

The same probes were used to generate G/A ladders by the Maxam-Gilbert chemical degradation method (27Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The binding mixtures were resolved on nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 5% glycerol in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). For AP-2 supershift assays, 1 μg of polyclonal AP-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or preimmune sera were added in the binding reactions and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h before electrophoresis. Oligonucleotides for EMSA are listed in Fig. 1 B except for FP1. The oligonucleotide sequences for FP1 are GCGGCTCTGGGCTTGCCTGAGGCCACAAGCCA and CCCGTGGCTTGTGGCCTCAGGCAAGCCCAGAGCCG. After annealing, FP1 was radiolabeled by Klenow end filling using [γ-32P]dCTP. Labeled FP1 probes were purified through Sephadex G-25 spin columns. AP-2γ proteins were prepared in rabbit reticulocyte lysates by using the TNT T7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) with pAP-2γ as the template. An AP-2 motif mutant was generated using the Muta-Gene phagemid in vitro mutagenesis system (Bio-Rad) with a plasmid containing the 770-bp Ada placental regulatory element serving as the template. The mutagenic oligonucleotide was GTGGCCTCAGACAAGCCC. The mutation was confirmed by sequence analysis before subcloned into pPCAT (17Shi D. Winston J.H. Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Hanten G.

After 2 weeks, protein extracts were prepared from placentas and embryos of the resulting transgenic mice, and CAT activities were measured as described (17Shi D. Winston J.H. Blackburn M.R.

Total RNA was isolated from placentas and embryos of ICR mice at gestational day 14.5 using TRIzol reagent according to manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). 50 μg of RNA was hybridized to 3 × 106 cpm32P-labeled riboprobes in 15 μl of hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 0.2 m NaCl, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA) overnight at 47 °C. After RNase treatment, RNA samples were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels (12Blackburn M.R. Wakamiya M. Caskey C.T. Kellems R.E. J. Biol.

To generate AP-2-specific riboprobes, pAP-2α, pAP-2β, and pAP-2γ were linearized using PstI for AP-2α and -β orClaI for AP-2γ. 32P-Labeled riboprobes were synthesized from linearized DNA templates using T3 RNA polymerase. Before hybridization, the riboprobes were purified from 6% polyacrylamide gels (12Blackburn M.R. Wakamiya M. Caskey C.T. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23891-23894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The same DNA fragments were used as templates for AP-2-specific probes in Northern blot and in situhybridization. Pregnant ICR female mice were sacrificed at gestational day 14.5, and various tissues were collected. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 30 μg of RNA was loaded per lane on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred onto MAGANA membranes (MSI). Equal loading was verified by the intensity of ethidium bromide staining of ribosomal RNA. The probe for AP-2γ was generated using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Embryos together with their extra-embryonic tissues (gestational sites) were isolated from pregnant ICR females at different gestational stages and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight. After dehydration and clearing, gestational sites were embedded in paraffin, and sections were collected for in situ hybridization (17Shi D. Winston J.H. Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Hanten G. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2334-2341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). α-35S-UTP-labeled AP-2γ sense and antisense riboprobes were generated by T7 and T3 RNA polymerase-directed synthesis from the same DNA fragments used for RNase protection. The sections were hybridized at 60 °C overnight and washed at high stringency. The slides were coated with Kodak NTB-2 emulsion and exposed for 2 days at room temperature. After development, the slides were stained with Hoechst 33258 to identify nuclei. The slides were viewed using an Olympus BX60 fluorescent microscope equipped with dark-field optics with a red filter and photographed using a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostics). We have previously shown thatAda expression in the murine placenta is controlled by a 770-bp sequence 5.4 kilobase pairs upstream of the Adatranscription start site (17Shi D. Winston J.H. Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Hanten G. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2334-2341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Within this region, we identified an essential placenta-specific footprinting region, termed FP1. To delineate precisely the DNA sequence that interacts with the protein(s) present in mouse placenta nuclear extracts, we subcloned an 80-bp fragment encompassing FP1 and used it as a template for high resolution DNase I footprinting (Fig. 1 A). This 80-bp fragment was32P-labeled at the 5′ end of either the sense strand (left) or the antisense strand (right). In the presence of placenta nuclear extracts (Pla lane) but not liver nuclear extracts (Liv lane), FP1 was clearly protected from DNase I digestion when compared with probe alone (P lane). The sequence of FP1 read from both strands (G/A lane) revealed that about 20 nucleotides were protected in each strand with a 12-bp overlap. Sequence analysis of FP1 revealed that the overlapping sequence contained an AP-2 transcription factor-binding site, suggesting that an AP-2 transcription factor may interact with FP1 (Fig. 1 B). To examine the potential involvement of AP-2 proteins in the formation of the FP1 protein complex, we used AP-2-binding sites present in the human metallothionein IIa gene (hMtIIa) (28Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar) and the human chorionic gonadotropin α subunit gene (hCGα) (29Steger D.J. Altschmied J. Buscher M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30Johnson W. Albanese C. Handwerger S. Williams T. Pestell R.G. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15405-15412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) as competitors in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Fig. 2 A). In the presence of placenta nuclear extracts, a major FP1 protein complex was detected (lane 2). The formation of this FP1 complex was significantly inhibited by the presence of increasing amounts of hMtIIa oligonucleotides. Even stronger inhibition was observed with hCGα oligonucleotides. This competitive inhibition was AP-2-specific. The hCGα mutant oligonucleotides with a C to T mutation in the AP-2-binding site had no effects on formation of the FP1 complex even at 100-fold excess (lane 9). The electrophoretic mobility shift assay data are in agreement with sequence analysis, pointing to the presence of AP-2-like proteins in the FP1 complex. To probe directly for the presence of AP-2 protein in the FP1 complex, a polyclonal AP-2 antibody was added to the binding reactions (Fig. 2 B). The original FP1 complex disappeared. Instead, a new FP1 complex formed at a higher position, indicating the binding of the AP-2 antibody to the FP1 complex (lane 3). In addition to the presence of AP-2 protein in the FP1 complex, we examined the possibility of other transcription factors in the FP1 complex. AP-2 protein was synthesized in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. It bound FP1 oligonucleotides and formed a complex that comigrated with the FP1 complex formed in the presence of placenta nuclear extracts (lanes 2 and 4). Furthermore, the same electrophoretic mobility change was also observed when the AP-2 antibody was added in both complexes (lanes 3 and 5). These results suggest that AP-2 is the major and possibly the only protein that interacts with FP1. The importance of the FP1/AP-2 interaction onAda expression in the placenta was examined in transgenic mice. A C to T point mutation was introduced into the AP-2-binding site of FP1 in the Ada placental regulatory sequence, and the resulting AP-2mPCAT construct was tested for its ability to target CAT reporter gene expression to placentas of transgenic mice. FP1 containing such a mutation no longer bound AP-2 proteins (Fig. 2 A, lane 13). Five F0 transgenic mice were generated, and the CAT activities in the placentas and adjoining embryos were measured at gestational day 14.5 (Fig. 3). Three mice did not show any CAT activity. One showed a low level of CAT activity in both the placenta and the embryo, presumably due to the influences of the integration site. Another showed CAT activity present in the placenta but not in the embryo. However, the level of CAT activity was considerably less than what was typically seen with the wild type 770PCAT construct. Loss of CAT expression in the placenta due to AP-2 site mutation indicates that AP-2 proteins are important in the regulation of Adaexpression in the placenta. ThreeAP-2 genes have been identified in mice, termedAP-2α, AP-2β, and AP-2γ (also known asAP2.2) (31Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 32Oulad-Abdelghani M. Bouillet P. Chazaud C. Dolle P. Chambon P. Exp.

Cell Res. 1996; 225: 338-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 34Mitchell P.J. Timmons P.M. Hebert J.M. Rigby P.W. Tjian R.

However, a detailed analysis of their expression in the placenta is lacking. To address this issue, we examined the relative abundance of AP-2 transcripts present in the mouse placenta at gestational day 14.5 by RNase protection (Fig. 4 A). AP-2α transcripts were detected in both the placenta and the embryo. AP-2α expression in the embryo was higher than that in the placenta. The major cell types that expressed high levels of AP-2α were migrating neural crest cells and their derivatives (data not shown). AP-2β was barely detectable in either the placenta or the embryo. In contrast, AP-2γ expression was readily detected in the placenta and almost undetectable in the embryo. Furthermore, AP-2γ expression in the placenta was much higher than that of AP-2α. In short, AP-2γ is the major AP-2 transcript present in the placenta. We were intrigued to find out where else AP-2γ was highly expressed in adult mice. Total RNA was isolated from brain, heart, thymus, liver, kidney, forestomach, hindstomach, small intestine, and large intestine of the mother as well as placentas and embryos at gestational day 14.5 and was subjected to Northern blot analysis using32P-labeled AP-2γ probes. The only tissue that showed abundant AP-2γ expression was the placenta, although AP-2γ expression in other tissues was detectable at a low level in RNase protection assays (data not shown). High levels of AP-2γ expression in the placenta suggest that AP-2γ may function primarily as a trophoblast transcriptional regulator. To assess further the role of AP-2γ during placentation, we examined the temporal-spatial pattern of AP-2γ expression in the developing placenta by in situ hybridization. On gestational day 6.5, AP-2γ transcripts were detected in the primary trophoblast giant cells surrounding the embryo, the diploid cells forming the ectoplacental cone, and the extra-embryonic ectoderm overlaying the proamniotic cavity. No AP-2γ expression was detected in the adjoining embryonic ectoderm. AP-2γ expression was also absent from the primitive endoderm that formed the yolk sac (Fig. 5 B). On gestational day 7.5, AP-2γ expression was detected in the ectoplacental cone (Fig. 5 D). Meanwhile, AP-2γ expression continued to be abundant in the growing and proliferating extra-embryonic ectoderm and in the chorion. The embryo did not show any AP-2γ expression. By comparison,Ada expression was sporadic in the ectoplacental cone and absent from extra-embryonic ectoderm (Fig. 5 E). On gestational day 9.5 when the chorioallantoic placenta was formed, AP-2γ expression was enriched in the trophoblast giant cells lining the maternal-fetal interface, in the spongiotrophoblast cells of the junctional zone, and in the trophoblast cells of the labyrinthine zone (Fig. 6 B). AP-2γ was not found in the extra-embryonic mesoderm and its derivatives in the placenta. On gestational day 11.5, with the growth of the placenta and formation of the hybrid vascular system, AP-2γ was expressed throughout the placenta, in the trophoblast giant cells, and in trophoblast cells of the junctional zone and labyrinthine zone (Fig. 6 D). AP-2γ expression in the labyrinthine zone was much more intense than that of Ada (Fig. 6, A and C). This was consistent with high levels of AP-2γ expression in the extra-embryonic ectoderm where Adaexpression was undetectable. Under higher magnification, bothAda and AP-2γ transcripts were detected in the clusters of the trophoblast cells in the junctional zone and labyrinthine zone of the placenta and were absent from endothelial cells that form the fetal vasculature (data not shown). In summary, AP-2γ expression was first observed at the onset of trophoblast differentiation and persisted in all trophoblast lineages as the placenta developed. This extensive pattern of AP-2γ expression throughout the trophoblast differentiation suggests that AP-2γ may play a broad and fundamental role in the regulation of gene expression during placental development. As part of our continuing effort to understand gene regulation in trophoblast cells, we report here an initial characterization of the role of transcription factor AP-2γ in the regulation of murineADA gene expression during placental development. The regulatory elements for Ada expression in the placenta resides in a 770-bp fragment 5.4 kilobase pairs upstream of theAda transcription start site (17Shi D. Winston J.H. Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Hanten G. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2334-2341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Within this fragment, a protein-binding region termed FP1 was identified and shown to preferentially bind proteins present in placenta nuclear extracts (17Shi D. Winston J.H. Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Hanten G. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2334-2341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the present study, the sequence of FP1 was precisely defined, and it matched the consensus sequence for the AP-2 family of transcription factors. The fact that FP1 is a bona fide AP-2-binding site was supported by the following results. The AP-2-binding sites in the human metallothionein IIa gene (hMtIIa) and the α subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin gene (hCGα) were potent competitors against FP1 binding to proteins present in placenta nuclear extracts. AP-2 proteins synthesized in vitro bound FP1 and comigated with the FP1 protein complex in placenta nuclear extracts. This FP1 protein complex was also recognized by an AP-2 antibody, indicating the presence of AP-2 protein in the complex. In addition, a high level of AP-2 expression was detected in the mouse placenta. The importance of FP1/AP-2 interaction was further confirmed by mutational analysis. Mutation in the AP-2-binding site of FP1 in the Adaplacental regulatory element destroyed its ability to target CAT reporter gene expression to placentas in transgenic mice. Taken together, these results indicate that AP-2 transcription factors are required for Ada expression in the placenta. The study of gene regulation in trophoblasts has been facilitated by the use of choriocarcinoma cell lines such as JEG-3 cells where particular glycoprotein hormones are produced. In studying transcriptional regulation of the human chorionic gonadotropin gene (hCG) in JEG-3 cells, Steger et al. (29Steger D.J. Altschmied J. Buscher M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 36Steger D.J. Buscher M. Hecht J.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1579-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) identified a trophoblast-specific element (TSE) in the promoters of both the α and β subunit genes of hCG, implying that a TSE-binding protein coordinates the expression of these two genes in the trophoblast cells. Subsequently, the TSE-binding protein was elucidated and shown to be a member of the AP-2 family of transcription factors (30Johnson W. Albanese C. Handwerger S. Williams T. Pestell R.G. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15405-15412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). When the sequence of murine Ada FP1 was delineated, a high degree of sequence similarity was observed among FP1 in Ada, TSE in hCGα, and AP-2 in hMtIIa. This led to the hypothesis that AP-2 regulates Ada expression in mouse placentas. We have demonstrated the physical interaction between FP1 sequence and AP-2 proteins in vitro by DNase I footprinting, EMSA, and supershift assays. The requirement of such interaction forAda expression in the placenta was also tested in vivo and confirmed in transgenic mice, further supporting the hypothesis that AP-2 is an important transcription factor for gene expression in trophoblast cells. Our studies are the first to address the functional importance of AP-2γ in vivo and thereby provide new insight regarding the function of AP-2 transcription factors during normal trophoblast development. Three AP-2 genes, AP-2α, AP-2β and AP-2γ, have been identified in both mice and humans (31Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 32Oulad-Abdelghani M. Bouillet P. Chazaud C. Dolle P. Chambon P. Exp.

Development. 1995; 121: 2779-2788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They exhibit partial overlapping but distinct patterns of expression during development (34Mitchell P.J. Timmons P.M. Hebert J.M. Rigby P.W. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 35Moser M. Ruschoff J. Buettner R. Dev.

All AP-2 transcripts were reported to be present in extra-embryonic trophoblast cells. However, it is not clear whether they exert redundant functions or carry out unique roles in regulation of gene expression in the placenta. Studies using AP-2α- and AP-2β-deficient mice suggested that each AP-2 protein has its own function important for development. AP-2α is essential for cranial-facial development (38Zhang J. Hagopian-Donaldson S. Serbedzija G. Elsemore J. Plehn-Dujowich D. McMahon A.P. Flavell R.A. Williams T. Nature. 1996; 381: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 39Schorle H. Meier P. Buchert M. Jaenisch R. Mitchell P.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), whereas AP-2β is important for maintaining differentiated kidney cells (40Moser M. Pscherer A. Roth C. Becker J. Mucher G. Zerres K. Dixkens C. Weis J. Guay-Woodford L. Buettner R. Fassler R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1938-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Both AP-2α- and AP-2β-deficient mice appear to have normal placentas, questioning the role of AP-2 protein in placental development. To address this concern, the relative amount of AP-2 messengers present in mature mouse placenta was measured. Of the three forms of AP-2, AP-2γ was the most abundant mRNA present. In fact, we found AP-2γ was expressed at much higher levels in the placenta than any other tissue in the mouse. This high level of AP-2γ in the placenta implies that AP-2γ may be the AP-2 protein most important for placental development. Generation of AP-2γ-deficient mice and analysis of their phenotype will test this hypothesis. Because previous studies were focused on the mouse embryo, AP-2γ expression in the placenta was largely ignored (37Chazaud C. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Bouillet P. Decimo D. Chambon P. Dolle P. Mech. Dev. 1996; 54: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Given the abundance of AP-2γ in the placenta, detailed analysis of AP-2γ expression in the extra-embryonic tissues was performed in order to assess the potential role of AP-2γ in placental development. After implantation, AP-2γ transcripts were first detected in the primary trophoblast giant cells from the mural trophoectoderm and diploid cells from the polar trophoectoderm. With continuing proliferation of the trophoblast cells, AP-2γ was detected in the ectoplacental cone and the extra-embryonic ectoderm. This extra-embryonic expression of AP-2γ was restricted to the trophoblast lineage. AP-2γ mRNA is absent from the primitive endoderm and the extra-embryonic mesoderm. By the time the allantois reaches and fuses with the chorion to form chorioallantoic placenta, AP-2γ was enriched in all trophoblast derivatives including secondary trophoblast giant cells at the maternal-fetal interface, spongiotrophoblast cells of the junctional zone, and trophoblast cells of the labyrinthine zone. The broad expression of AP-2γ in all trophoblast lineages suggests that it may regulate expression of a variety of genes in the trophoblast cells. Coincident with this hypothesis, some genes implied in the development and function of the placenta contain AP-2-binding sites in their promoter sequences, such as transforming growth factor α (41Wang D.

A. 1997; 94: 4342-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). AP-2γ may be one of the key transcription factors regulating gene expression in the trophoblast cells. The analysis of early implantation sites revealed that AP-2γ transcripts were present in three branches of the developing trophoblast lineage as follows: the primary giant cells, the ectoplacental cone, and the extra-embryonic ectoderm. In contrast,Ada transcripts were absent from the extra-embryonic ectoderm and were only observed sporadically in the ectoplacental cone. The difference in AP-2γ and Ada expression persisted during subsequent placental development as AP-2γexpression in the labyrinthine zone became much more intense than that of Ada. Thus, AP-2γ as a potential key trophoblast transcriptional regulator is present in all trophoblast cells, whereas the target gene Ada is present in a subpopulation of trophoblast cells, mainly from the ectoplacental cone. The difference between expression patterns of AP-2γ and Ada in the trophoblasts can be accounted for by two hypotheses. On the one hand, it is possible that Ap-2γ is essential but not sufficient to activate Ada expression in the placenta. This view is supported by our previously published evidence (17Shi D. Winston J.H. Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Hanten G. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2334-2341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that diverse genetic regulatory motifs are required for Ada expression in the placenta. Alternatively, AP-2γ transactivation activity may be inhibited by other factors present in the extra-embryonic ectoderm lineage. In this regard, it has been reported that adenovirus E1A represses type IV 72-kDa collagenase expression by binding to AP-2 (51Somasundaram K. Jayaraman G. Williams T. Moran E. Frisch S. Thimmapaya B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3088-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating the molecular mechanism through which AP-2γ exerts its transcriptional control of Ada gene in the trophoblast cells. The developmental pattern of AP-2γ expression in the trophoblast cells is distinct from other transcription factors important for placental development. For example, Mash-2, which is essential for spongiotrophoblast development, is transiently expressed in the developing placenta, mostly in the ectoplacental cone and extra-embryonic ectoderm (20Tanaka M. Gertsenstein M. Rossant J. Nagy A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 190: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 21Guillemot F. Nagy A. Auerbach A. Rossant J. Joyner A.L.

Orphan receptor ERR-β, whose absence results in loss of diploid trophoblast cells, is transiently expressed in extra-embryonic ectoderm and in the chorion (53Luo J. Sladek R. Bader J.A. Matthyssen A. Rossant J. Giguere V. Nature. 1997; 388: 778-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). GATA-2 and GATA-3, which regulate mouse placental lactogen I gene expression, are present in the trophoblast giant cells (24Ng Y.K. George K.M. Engel J.D. Linzer D.I.

https://openalex.org/W2039953129,"We used purified mammalian topoisomerases I (top1) and oligonucleotides to study top1-mediated cleavage and religation in the presence of a potent carcinogenic adduct, 1,N 6-ethenoadenosine (εA) incorporated immediately downstream of a unique top1 cleavage site. We found tha εA markedly enhanced top1 cleavage complexes when it was incorporated at the +1 position of the top1 cleavage. This enhancement was due to a reduction of the religation step of the top1 reaction. In addition, εA reduced the top1-mediated cleavage and decreased binding of the enzyme to DNA. We also studied the effects of the εA adduct on top1 trapping by camptothecin (CPT), a well known top1 inhibitor. CPT was inactive when εA was present at the +1 position. Alkylation of the top1 cleavage complex by 7-chloromethyl-10,11-methylenedioxycamptothecin (7-ClMe-MDO-CPT) was also blocked by the εA adduct. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the εA carcinogenic adduct can efficiently trap human top1 and mimic CPT effects. Normal hydrogen bonding of the base pairs immediately downstream from the top1 cleavage site is probably essential for efficient DNA religation and binding of camptothecins in the top1 cleavage complex. We used purified mammalian topoisomerases I (top1) and oligonucleotides to study top1-mediated cleavage and religation in the presence of a potent carcinogenic adduct, 1,N 6-ethenoadenosine (εA) incorporated immediately downstream of a unique top1 cleavage site. We found tha εA markedly enhanced top1 cleavage complexes when it was incorporated at the +1 position of the top1 cleavage. This enhancement was due to a reduction of the religation step of the top1 reaction. In addition, εA reduced the top1-mediated cleavage and decreased binding of the enzyme to DNA. We also studied the effects of the εA adduct on top1 trapping by camptothecin (CPT), a well known top1 inhibitor. CPT was inactive when εA was present at the +1 position. Alkylation of the top1 cleavage complex by 7-chloromethyl-10,11-methylenedioxycamptothecin (7-ClMe-MDO-CPT) was also blocked by the εA adduct. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the εA carcinogenic adduct can efficiently trap human top1 and mimic CPT effects. Normal hydrogen bonding of the base pairs immediately downstream from the top1 cleavage site is probably essential for efficient DNA religation and binding of camptothecins in the top1 cleavage complex. 1,N2-ethenodeoxyguanosine 3,N 4-ethenodeoxycytidine 1,N 6-ethenoadenosine topoisomerases I camptothecin 7-chloromethyl10,11-methylenedioxycamptothecin. Vinyl chloride is a potent carcinogen. Its metabolites are reactive species that can induce cyclic adducts in DNA. Four adducts have been characterized: the 1,N2-ethenodeoxyguanosine (εG),1 theN 2,3-ethenodeoxyguanosine, the 3,N 4-ethenodeoxycytidine (εC), and the 1,N 6-ethenodeoxyadenosine (εA) (1Singer B.

These adducts can also be generated by other exogenous sources such as vinyl carbamate, ethyl carbamate, and other P450-mediated oxidized two-carbon compounds (2Park K.K. Stewart B.C. Miller J.A.

More recently, εA and εC have been detected in normal hepatocytes, suggesting their endogenous formation (4Nair J. Barbin A. Guichard Y. Bartsch H.

In vivo cytotoxicity and carcinogenic effects of etheno adducts have been linked to their mutagenic properties (6Basu A.K. Wood M.L. Niedernhofer L.J. Ramos L.A. Essigmann J.M.

Two separate DNA glycosylase activities have been reported for εA and εC excision (11Hang B. Chenna A. Rao S. Singer B. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but the corresponding proteins have not been identified yet. Topoisomerase I (top1) is important for DNA replication and transcription, because it can remove the torsional constraint along the DNA (12Champoux J.J. Wang J.C. Cozarelli N.R.

Mammalian top1 cleaves one strand of the DNA and remains covalently attached to the 3′-end of the transient break. This catalytic intermediate is referred to as the top1 cleavage complex. This reaction is reversible, and in normal conditions, only a small fraction of the cleaved DNA is detectable. Top1 inhibitors (poisons) such as camptothecin (CPT) increase (trap) top1 cleavage complexes by inhibiting the religation step (17Pommier Y. Semin. Oncol. 1996; 23: 3-10PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 94: 194-218Google Scholar). Both topoisomerase I and II can be trapped by DNA modifications such as mismatches, abasic sites, nicks, and gaps, when such lesions are in the vicinity of the enzyme cleavage site (19Pourquier P.

In the present study, we used oligonucleotides containing an εA at the +1 position relative to the cleavage site and analyzed the effects on the top1-mediated DNA cleavage and religation and on top1 binding to DNA. We show for the first time that the carcinogenic adduct, εA, can trap top1 and mimic CPT effects. We also demonstrate that the εA adduct decreases top1 binding to DNA and the “on-rate” DNA cleavage. Finally, CPT activity was strongly inhibited when εA was in the immediate vicinity of a top1 cleavage site. High performance liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotides were purchased from The Midland Certified Reagent Company (Midland, TX). α-32P-Cordycepin 5′-triphosphate was purchased from NEN Life Science Products and polyacrylamide from Bio-Rad. CPT and 7-chloromethyl-10,11-methylenedioxy-20(S)-camptothecin (7-ClMe-MDO-CPT) were provided by Drs. Wani and Wall (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). Ten-millimolar aliquots of CPT or 7-ClMe-MDO-CPT were stored at −20° C, thawed, and diluted to 1 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) just before use. 3′ labeling was performed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with α-32P-cordycepin as described previously (23Pommier Y. Jenkins J. Kohlhagen G. Leteurtre F. Mutat. Res. 1995; 337: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Labeling mixtures were subsequently centrifuged through a G-25 Sephadex column to remove excess of unincorporated nucleotide. Radiolabeled single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides were annealed to the same concentration of unlabeled complementary strand in 1 × annealing buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Annealing mixtures were heated to 95° C for 5 min and slowly chilled overnight to room temperature. Overexpression of the human recombinant top1 was performed in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus virus construct containing the top1 full-length cDNA (24Zhelkovsky A.M. Moore C.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were from infected Sf9 cells 4 days after infection as described previously (20Pourquier P. Pilon A.A. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Sharma A. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26441-26447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and kept at −80° C before use. Human top1 was purified from nuclear extract using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). 50 μl of beads were placed into microcentrifuge tubes and washed three times with 1 ml of wash buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mmMnCl2, 50 mm KCl). 500 μl of nuclear extract were incubated with beads for 30 min at 4° C and washed two times with 300 μl of the wash buffer. Insect cells top1 was eluted with wash buffer containing 40 mm imidazole. Human recombinant top1 was eluted with wash buffer containing 300 mmimidazole and dialyzed 3 h with 30 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol. Bovine serum albumin (0.2 mg/ml) and glycerol (30% v/v) were added to the purified top1, and aliquots were stored at −20° C. DNA substrates (approximately 50 fmol/reaction) were incubated with 5 units of calf thymus or with human recombinant top1 usually for 30 min at 25° C with or without drug in standard reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). Reactions were stopped by adding either sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (final concentration 0.5%) or NaCl (0.5 m for 30 min at 25° C followed by addition of 0.5% SDS for standard reactions or 0.35m NaCl at 4° C for kinetics of reversal. 3.3 volumes of Maxam Gilbert loading buffer (98% formamide, 0.01m EDTA, 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol, and 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue) were added to the reaction mixtures before loading. 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (7 m urea) were run at 40 V/cm at 50° C for 2–3 h and dried on 3MM Whatman paper sheets. Imaging and quantitations were performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). 3′-Labeled DNA substrates (approximately 25 fmol/reaction) were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of yeast Y727F mutant (final volume of 20 μl) in 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5 (25Cheng C. Wang L.K. Sekigushi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8263-8269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and 50 ng of double-stranded poly(dI-dC) DNA (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature. Ten microliters of 3 × neutral loading buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) was added to each reaction before loading into a 6% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE. Electrophoresis was for 2 h at 100 V in 0.25 × TBE buffer (25 mm Tris, 22.5 mm boric acid, 0.25 mm EDTA). Imaging and quantitations were performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). In this study we have investigated the effect of εA on top1 activity in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the εA bulky adduct differs from adenine by the presence of an additional ring resulting from a cyclization reaction of reactive species such as the vinyl chloride metabolite, chloroacetaldehyde (26Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 2-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We used purified oligonucleotides derived from the Tetrahymena ribosomal DNA sequence (27Bonven B.J. Gocke E. Westergaard O. Cell. 1985; 41: 541-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and analyzed the effects of εA incorporation at the +1 position of the scissile strand (X in Fig. 1B) on top1-mediated DNA cleavage and religation using purified recombinant human enzyme. As shown in Fig. 1 C, incorporation of εA led to approximately 6-fold increase of top1-mediated cleavage complexes (comparelanes 2). Top1 cleavage/religation equilibrium can be shifted toward religation by increasing the salt concentration in the reaction (28Tanizawa A. Kohn K.W. Kohlhagen G. Leteurtre F. Pommier Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 43: 7200-7206Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the case of the εA oligonucleotide, 0.5m NaCl was able to reverse the top1-mediated cleavage complexes (Fig. 1 C, left panel, lane 3). Previous studies indicated that CPT interacted with the +1 base immediately 3′ to the top1 cleavage site (29Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Kohn F. Leteurtre F. Wani M.C. Wall M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8861-8865Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and increased the top1 cleavage complex (compare lanes 2 and 4 in the control panel) by inhibiting the religation step of the reaction (12Champoux J.J. Wang J.C. Cozarelli N.R. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 217-242Google Scholar,17Pommier Y. Semin. Oncol. 1996; 23: 3-10PubMed Google Scholar, 30Svejstrup J.Q. Christiansen K. Gromova I.I. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the case of the εA oligonucleotide, CPT did not enhance top1-mediated DNA cleavage further (Fig. 1 C, comparelanes 2 and 4 on the right panel), and the reaction was still reversible in the presence of 0.5 mNaCl (lane 5, right panel). These results demonstrate that the carcinogenic adduct εA incorporated at the +1 position of a top1 cleavage site reversibly traps top1. We next compared the kinetics of top1 cleavage complex formation between the control oligonucleotide (A:T) and the εA-containing oligonucleotide (εA:T) to investigate whether reversible trapping could be further enhanced by increasing the reaction time. As shown in Fig. 2 A, cleavage complexes were formed within the first minute of incubation for both the normal and εA oligonucleotides, and no further increase was detected. Instead, a slight decrease of the cleavage complexes was detected with longer incubation, probably resulting from a decrease of the enzyme activity. In accordance with the results presented in Fig. 1 C, the plateau value was 5–6-fold higher when εA was present at the +1 position (Fig. 2 B). These results demonstrate that the reversible trapping of top1 by εA probably corresponds to an equilibrium that is reached quickly once top1 is added to the reaction. Because top1-mediated DNA cleavage/religation is an equilibrium process, reversible trapping of the enzyme by εA could possibly result from either an increase of the cleavage (on-rate) or/and a decrease of the religation (“off-rate”). In the following experiments, we separately investigated the effects of εA on each step of the top1 reaction. We first studied the DNA cleavage formation in “suicide” oligonucleotides containing either A or εA at the +1 position relative to the top1 cleavage site (see Fig. 3 A). Under these conditions, top1-mediated cleavage was examined under single turnover conditions (25Cheng C. Wang L.K. Sekigushi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8263-8269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Svejstrup J.Q. Christiansen K. Gromova I.I. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Once top1 cleaves the DNA, it remains bound to the 3′-end of the scissile strand in a covalent complex (suicide complex), and the 3′-labeled 6-mer distal product is released (Fig. 3 B, arrowhead). In our reactions, the 5′-end of the nonscissile strand was phosphorylated prior to annealing to avoid formation of recombination products (20Pourquier P. Pilon A.A. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Sharma A. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26441-26447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 23Pommier Y. Jenkins J. Kohlhagen G. Leteurtre F. Mutat. Res. 1995; 337: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The kinetics experiment presented in Fig. 3 B show a marked difference in the on-rate reaction between the two suicide substrates. Cleavage was slower in the oligonucleotide containing an εA at the +1 position than in the control (Fig. 3 C). The apparent cleavage rate constant (k cl) was calculated. Cleavage was normalized to the end point value (lanes 8 in Fig. 3 B) of 72 and 78% for the A:T (open squares) and εA:T (closed squares) oligonucleotide, respectively, and k cl was determined by fitting the data to the equation (100 − %Clnorm) = 100e −k cl·t (31Cheng C. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11589-11595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thek cl for the εA-containing substrate was approximately 3-fold less than the control (0.047 s−1 versus 0.15 s−1). These results indicate that the top1-mediated DNA cleavage rate (on-rate step) is reduced by the presence of εA at the +1 position of a top1 cleavage site. To further determine whether presence of εA altered the top1-DNA interaction, DNA binding assays were performed. For this purpose, we used the catalytically inactive yeast top1 in which the active tyrosine in position 727 has been mutated to a phenylalanine (Y727F). This enzyme does not perform cleavage, but is still able to bind to the DNA (32Lynn R.M. Bjornsti M.A. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc Natl Acad Sci U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 33Eng W.K. Pandit S.D. Sternglanz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13373-13376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We incubated 3′-labeled oligonucleotides containing either A (A:T) or εA (εA:T) at the +1 position in the presence of increasing amount of the yeast mutant top1 (Fig. 4). Y727F top1 was able to bind to both substrates, which resulted in the appearance of a slow migrating band corresponding to top1·DNA complexes in native polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 4 A). Top1 binding to the εA-containing substrate was expressed relative to the binding to the control oligonucleotide (which was set to 1), and the ratio was determined for each concentration of enzyme (Fig. 4 B). Top1 binding to the oligonculeotide with εA at the +1 position was reduced by approximately 4–5-fold compared with the control DNA. These results demonstrate that top1 binding is decreased by the presence of εA at the +1 position of the top1 site. They also suggest that reduction of the top1-mediated DNA cleavage on-rate (Fig. 3) is probably due to reduced binding of the enzyme to DNA. Because the above data indicated that reduced top1 cleavage could not be responsible for top1 trapping by εA, we studied the influence of εA on the religation step (Fig. 5). For this purpose, we first incubated the normal and εA oligonucleotides (see Fig. 1 B) with purified top1 for 15 min at 25° C to reach cleavage equilibrium (see Fig. 2). Religation was then studied after addition of 0.35m NaCl. These religation experiments were performed at 4° C to better follow religation kinetics (Fig. 5 A). Under these conditions, religation is slower than at 37° C (28Tanizawa A. Kohn K.W. Kohlhagen G. Leteurtre F. Pommier Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 43: 7200-7206Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Religation was markedly decreased with the εA:T substrate as compared with the control oligonucleotide (Fig. 5 A). As a comparison, we used the control oligonucleotide in the presence of 10 μm CPT. CPT is known to increase top1 cleavage complexes by inhibiting religation (17Pommier Y. Semin. Oncol. 1996; 23: 3-10PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 94: 194-218Google Scholar). Cleavage products were quantitated and plotted as a function of time after salt addition (Fig. 5 B). The kinetics of religation for the εA-containing substrate and the control oligonucleotide in the presence of CPT were comparable (Fig. 5 B, compare open circles and closed box). These results demonstrate that reversible trapping of top1 by εA is due to an inhibition of the religation step of the top1 reaction. As shown in Fig. 1 C, CPT did not increase further top1-mediated DNA cleavage when εA was present at the +1 position of the top1 site. We investigated this further by using different CPT concentrations (Fig. 6). Whereas CPT was active even at low concentration (0.1 μm) in the control oligonucleotide (A:T), it did not increase top1-mediated cleavage even at high concentration in the εA oligonucleotide (Fig. 6 A, compare lanes 2 and 4 on theright panel). These results demonstrated that presence of εA at the +1 position relative to the top1 cleavage site prevents CPT activity. Because CPT has been reported to interact directly with the +1 base from the top1 cleavage site (29Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Kohn F. Leteurtre F. Wani M.C. Wall M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8861-8865Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we tested whether the lack of effect of CPT on top1 cleavage was associated with alterations of the drug with the εA. For this purpose, we used the alkylating CPT, 7-ClMe-MDO-CPT. This drug alkylates the N3 position of the +1 guanine or adenine in the presence of top1 (29Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Kohn F. Leteurtre F. Wani M.C. Wall M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8861-8865Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 34Valenti M. Nieves-Neira W. Kohlhagen G. Kohn K.W. Wall M.E. Wani M.C. Pommier Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As reported previously, in the control oligonucleotide, 7-ClMe-MDO-CPT stimulated top1 cleavage complexes (Fig. 7, comparelane b with other lanes in the control panel) and formed the alkylated product that can be detected as a retarded band in denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 7, arrow). By contrast, when εA was incorporated at the +1 position, no increase of DNA cleavage was detectable with 7-ClMe-MDO-CPT. Moreover, the alkylation product was not detectable regardless of the concentration of 7-ClMe-MDO-CPT used. These results suggested that the lack of CPT activity when εA was present at the +1 position relative to a top1 cleavage site might be related to the altered structure of the +1 base pair. In this study, we report for the first time that a potent carcinogenic adduct, εA can trap eukaryotic top1. εA incorporation results in altered base pairing with the thymine on the opposite DNA strand. Circular dichroism analysis demonstrates that the presence of the extra 4-membered ring suppresses the two hydrogen bonds (35Basu A.K. Niedernhofer L.J. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5626-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our observation that εA can reversibly trap top1 is consistent with previous observations indicating that base mismatches at the +1 position can enhance top1 cleavage complexes (19Pourquier P. Ueng L.-M. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Gupta M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7792-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 36Yeh Y.-C. Liu H.-F. Ellis C.A. Lu A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15498-15504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced religation of top1-cleavable complexes appears to be the mechanism by which εA traps top1. Thus, carcinogenic adducts can mimic CPT effects. Once the DNA is cleaved by top1, perfect positioning of the +1 base is probably required for optimal top1-mediated DNA religation. This positioning closely depends on the hydrogen bonding of the +1 base pairs. True mismatches such as A:A base pairing or uracil misincorporation leading to wobble base pairing such as U:C or U:G also increase top1 cleavage complex formation, whereas U:A has no effect (19Pourquier P. Ueng L.-M. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Gupta M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7792-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Thus, any modification of the hydrogen bonding would potentially affect the religation (off-rate) of the top1 reaction. We also found that binding and subsequent cleavage of the εA-containing DNA was significantly reduced. The activity of other DNA processing enzymes such as NheI or DNA polymerases has also been shown to be reduced by the presence of εA adducts (35Basu A.K. Niedernhofer L.J. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5626-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,37Langouet S. Mican A.N. Muller M. Fink S.P. Marnett L.J. Muhle S.A. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5184-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In our system, top1 was still able to cleave the DNA next to the εA and cleavage was globally enhanced. This demonstrates that inhibition of religation by εA is the predominant mechanism responsible for the increase of top1-mediated cleavage complexes. CPT has been shown to trap top1 cleavage complexes probably by interacting with the +1 base immediately downstream of the top1 cleavage site (29Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Kohn F. Leteurtre F. Wani M.C.

In this study, we found that the effect of CPT was not detectable when εA was incorporated at the +1 position. Moreover, we could not detect alkylation of the DNA in the top1 cleavage complex by 7-ClMe-MDO-CPT when εA was next to the top1 cleavage site. Thus, εA at the +1 position prevents CPT interaction. This could be due to altered base pairing at the +1 position (19Pourquier P. Ueng L.-M. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Gupta M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7792-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Such base pairing might be important for optimum CPT interaction (stacking with the +1 base pair) within the top1-DNA complex (16Pommier Y. Pourquier P. Fan Y. Strumberg D. Biochim. Biophys.

In conclusion, this study indicates that carcinogenic adducts generated from vinyl chloride and other industrial by-products can trap top1 and mimic CPT effects. This trapping might be part of the cell death pathways or repair mechanisms resulting from these lesions."

In order to understand the mechanism of the inhibitory effect, we synthesized and fluorescently labeled SV-465, an extended version of SV-473 by one more heptad, its mutant peptide A17,24-SV-465, in which two heptadic leucines were substituted with two alanines, and its enatiomer d-SV-465, composed entirely of damino acids. Similar mutations in the homologous fusion protein of the Newcastle disease virus drastically reduced its activity. The data revealed that SV-465, but not A17,24-SV-465 or its enantiomer, is highly active in inhibiting Sendai virus-induced hemolysis of red blood cells. None of the peptides interfere with the binding of virions to the target red blood cells as demonstrated by hemagglutinin assay. Fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy indicated that: (i) only SV-465 could self-assemble in aqueous environment; (ii) only SV-465 could co-assemble with two other biologically active heptad repeats derived from Sendai virus fusion protein; (iii) SV-465 has a higher helical content than A17,24-SV-465 in solution, and (iv) all the peptides bind strongly to zwitterionic and negatively charged phospholipids. Polarized attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy revealed that they bound as monomers onto the surface of zwitterionic membranes with predominantly α-helical structures. The functional role of the amino acid 465–497 domain in Sendai virus-mediated membrane fusion is discussed in light of these findings.

The functional role of the amino acid 465–497 domain in Sendai virus-mediated membrane fusion is discussed in light of these findings. Membrane fusion mediated by paramyxoviruses, such as Sendai virus, Newcastle disease virus and others, usually requires two glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and the fusion (F) glycoprotein (1Stegmann T. Doms R.W. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 187-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 2White J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 75-97Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar). While the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein is responsible for the attachment of virions to target cells (3Scheid A. Caliguiri L.A.

Virology. 1974; 57: 475-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) and has a yet undefined role in the subsequent membrane fusion, the fusion protein is believed to be directly involved in the fusion event (2White J.M.

The fusion protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor (F0) and is activated upon proteolytic cleavage to produce a disulfide linked F1 and F2 (4Scheid A. Choppin P.W.

However, the role of the F2 subunit in the paramyxovirus-mediated membrane fusion process is not yet clearly understood. Reduction of disulfide bonds has been shown to cause a loss of the fusion activity of a fusion protein, which may imply that F2 subunit is also required for the function of fusion proteins (23Nussbaum O. Zakai N. Loyter A. Virology. 1984; 138: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Fusion proteins of paramyxoviruses and other families of viruses contain one or more heptad-repeat regions which are often adjacent to the fusion peptide sequence and/or immediately upstream of the transmembrane anchor domain (24Buckland R.

Besides the two heptad repeats mentioned above, Sendai virus, similar to other homologous paramyxoviruses, has one more leucine zipper motif, SV-269, positioned in between those two heptad repeats which has been shown recently to oligomerize in solution and to inhibit Sendai virus induced hemolysis of red blood cells (RBCs) (43Ghosh J.K. Ovadia M. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15451-15462Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).To get insight into the molecular mechanism by which SV-473 induces its inhibitory effect, we synthesized, fluorescently labeled, and structurally and functionally characterized SV-465, an extended version of SV-473 with one more heptad toward the N-terminal, its mutant peptide A17,24-SV-465, in which two heptadic leucines were substituted with two alanines, and d-SV-465, an alld-amino acid enantiomer of SV-465 (Fig. 1). The mutant peptide A17,24-SV-465 was selected because similar site-directed mutagenesis in the homologous fusion protein of Newcastle disease virus drastically reduced the fusogenic activity of the virus (28Reitter J.N. Sergel T. Morrison T.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5995-6004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional role of this heptad repeat in the Sendai virus-mediated membrane fusion is discussed.RESULTSSV-465 but Not A17,24-SV-465 and d-SV-465 Inhibits Sendai Virus-mediated Hemolysis of Human RBCsThe hemolytic activity of Sendai virus is associated with fusion of the virus with target RBCs (58Loyter A. Volsky D.J. Cell Surf. Rev. 1982; 8: 215-266Google Scholar). The assay was performed as follows: virions were initially incubated with RBCs at room temperature to allow their attachment to the cells. Subsequent incubation at 37 °C resulted in RBCs lysis, and the extent of lysis was measured by absorbance at 540 nm (characteristic of hemoglobin). In another experiment the same amount of virions were treated initially with SV-473, SV-465, A17,24-SV-465, and d-SV-465 and incubated for 20 min prior to the addition of RBCs. Fig. 2 (top panel) depicts the inhibitory effect of the peptides on Sendai virus-mediated hemolysis and Fig. 2 (bottom panel) depicts the dose-response inhibitory effect of the peptides. The results show that SV-465 is more potent than SV-473 in inhibiting Sendai virus-mediated hemolysis, whereas both the mutant A17,24-SV-465 and the enantiomerd-SV-465 are inactive. These results indicate that both heptadic leucines and stereospecific recognition are involved in the inhibition process. None of the peptides showed any hemolytic activity up to the maximum concentration tested (100 μm) (data not shown), thus eliminating the possibility that they contribute to the hemolytic activity during the fusion process. In order to check whether SV-465 can exhibit its inhibition potential when the virions are already bound to RBCs, Sendai virions were first added to RBCs and incubated for 30 min to permit viral attachment, and then SV-465 was added (Fig. 2, top panel, column D). Inhibition was observed in this case too, similarly to what has been observed with the shorter version SV-473 (32Rapaport D. Ovadia M. Shai Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). SV-465 could also inhibit Sendai virus-induced hemolysis when incubated with erythrocytes prior to the addition of virions (data not shown). This is in contrast to SV-201, a synthetic peptide derived from the amino acids 201–229 ectodomain of Sendai virus, which inhibits hemolysis only when the virions are not attached to red blood cells (59Ghosh J.K. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7252-7259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Figure 2Top panel, the inhibition potential of the wild type and mutant peptides under various conditions as measured by absorbance at 540 nm. All experiments were done in duplicate and the concentrations of Sendai virions and RBC were fixed at 35 hemagglutinating units and 2.2% (v/v), respectively. The final incubation was always at 37 °C for 40 min, followed by centrifugation at 5700 × g for 8 min. A,control experiment: virions were added to 100 μl of PBS followed by the addition of 125 μl of 4% RBC and incubated for 10 min at room temperature; B, 0.5 μm SV-465; C,0.5 μm SV-473; E, 6.0 μmA17,24-SV-465; and F, 1.0 μmd-SV-465 were added to virions in 100 μl of PBS and incubated for 20 min at room temperature (similar results were obtained following incubation at 4 °C). RBC (125 μl, 4%) were then added and incubated for 10 min. D, virions were added to RBC (225 μl, 2.2%) at 4 °C and incubated on ice for 30 min. SV-465 (0.5 μm) was then added and further incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Bottom panel, dose response of the inhibition potential of SV-465 (closed squares), SV-473 (closed triangles), A17,24-SV-465 (closed circles), and d-SV-465 (open circles). Experiments were done as described for columns B, C, E, and F (upper panel). The inhibition of hemolysis was calculated from the recorded absorbance of the supernatants at 540 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mechanism of InhibitionThe results shown in Fig. 2 revealed that SV-465 is biologically active whether it is incubated with the virus before or after its attachment to RBCs. Therefore, SV-465 may interfere with a functional domain of Sendai virus fusion protein before or after the binding of virions to target RBCs. In order to search for a possible mechanism for the inhibitory effect of SV-465, the peptide, its mutant and enantiomer were tested for their ability to interfere with the binding of virions to RBCs using the hemagglutinin assay. In addition, the structure of the peptides was determined in solution, 40% trifluoroethanol/water and phospholipid membranes. Furthermore, the peptides were tested for their ability to self-associate and to co-assemble in solution and in the membrane with two other biologically active heptad repeats.The Peptides do Not Inhibit the Binding of Sendai Virions to Target RBCsSendai virus induced hemagglutinin assay was performed in the presence and absence of the peptides to examine whether they interfere with the binding of virions to target RBCs. This assay has been developed based on the finding that binding of Sendai virions to human red blood cells cause their agglutination (23Nussbaum O. Zakai N. Loyter A. Virology. 1984; 138: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 60Shimizu Y.K. Shimizu K. Ishida N. Homma M. Virology. 1976; 27: 48-60Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 61Rott R. Klenk H.O. Poste G. Nicolson G.L. Cell Surface Reviews. North-Holland, Amsterdam1977: 47-48Google Scholar). In a control experiment agglutination of RBCs was readily observed upon their incubation with virions. In another control experiment the same amount of RBCs was added to solutions of SV-473, SV-465, A17,24-SV-465, and d-SV-465 in PBS (in the concentration range used for the inhibition assay), in order to check whether the peptides alone agglutinate RBCs. No hemagglutination was observed, which ruled out hemagglutinin activity of any of the wild type and mutant peptides. The peptides (0–15 μm, in duplicates) were then incubated with virions for 20 min to allow binding, followed by the addition of RBCs and incubation for 1 h. We observed that Sendai virions induced agglutination of RBCs in the presence of SV-473, SV-465, A17,24-SV-465, andd-SV-465 to the same extent as observed in the absence of the peptides. The results reveal that these peptides do not disturb the binding of virions to target RBCs.SV-465 but Not A17,24-SV-465 Self-associates in SolutionViral fusion proteins are oligomeric in both native and fusogenic states (62Doms R.W. Lamb R.A. Rose J.K. Helenius A. Virology. 1993; 193: 545-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). To examine the possible involvement of the 465–497 amino acid domain in the assembly of the fusion protein in the native state, the ability of SV-465, A17,24-SV-465, andd-SV-465 to self-associate and co-assemble with the biologically active heptad repeat regions SV-150 and SV-269 (43Ghosh J.K. Ovadia M. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15451-15462Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was studied in aqueous solution. For these measurements, the peptides were labeled at their NH2 termini by either rhodamine or NBD. Identical results were obtained with both fluorescent probes, therefore only the data with the rhodamine-labeled peptides are presented. Since the fluorescence of rhodamine is quenched when several molecules are in close proximity, an increase in fluorescence is expected when an aggregated rhodamine-labeled peptide dissociates, a process that occurs when the peptide is cleaved by a proteolytic enzyme. When Rho-SV-465 and Rho- A17,24-SV-465 were dissolved in equal concentrations (0.20 μm each) in methanol, a solvent which does not promote the peptide's aggregation as expected, both peptides exhibited the same fluorescence (data not shown). However, when the same amount of peptides were added to PBS, the level of the fluorescence of Rho-SV-465 was much lower compared with that in methanol, whereas that of A17,24-SV-465 only slightly changed. This indicates that the wild type peptide SV-465 exists in a higher aggregational state in aqueous environment than its mutant. Fig. 3 (panel 1) shows the changes of rhodamine fluorescence upon the addition of proteinase-K. The figure shows that upon addition of the enzyme, the fluorescence of Rho-SV-465 increased ∼80% of the initial level, while the fluorescence of Rho-A17,24-SV-465 remained almost the same. Eventually, both the wild type and mutant Rho-labeled peptides (0.20 μm each) exhibited very similar fluorescence after degradation with proteinase-K. This indicates that SV-465 oligomerizes in solution while its mutant does not. d-SV-465 oligomerizes to the same extent as the wild type peptide, however, as expected it is not cleaved by the enzyme and therefore rhodamine fluorescence did not change (data not shown).Figure 3Panel 1, detection of the aggregation state and the nature of self-assembly of SV-465 in aqueous environment by monitoring the dequenching of rhodamine fluorescence of Rho-SV-465.Columns A and B represent the fluorescence level of Rho-SV-465 in PBS before and after digestion with proteinase K, respectively.

Columns E, F, and G depict the fluorescence level of Rho-SV-465 after the addition of unlabeled SV-465, A17,24-SV-465, andd-SV-465, respectively.

We observed a dequenching of rhodamine fluorescence, which indicates the reversible nature of SV-465 association in solution (Fig. 3, panel 1). However, there was no increase in rhodamine fluorescence following the addition of equal amounts of unlabeled A17,24-SV-465 ord-SV-465 to Rho-SV-465 (Fig. 3, panel 1), indicating that the mutant peptide and the enantiomer cannot associate with the wild type peptide.SV-465 but Not A17,24-SV-465 or d-SV-465 Co-assembles with the Biologically Active Heptad Repeats SV-150 and SV-269 in SolutionIt was of interest to find out whether SV-465 could co-assemble with two biologically active heptad repeats of Sendai virus fusion protein, namely SV-269 (43Ghosh J.K. Ovadia M. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15451-15462Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and SV-150. 2I. Ben-Efraim, Y. Kliger, C. Hermesh, and Y. Shai, unpublished results. SV-150, composed of amino acids 150–186, is an elongated version of the biologically inactive SV-163 peptide (32Rapaport D. Ovadia M. Shai Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) that inhibits virus-mediated erythrocyte hemolysis at doses ∼50% that of SV-473.2 SV-269 is a leucine zipper motif which specifically binds Sendai virions and inhibits virus-mediated hemolysis (43Ghosh J.K. Ovadia M. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15451-15462Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Homologous SV-269 regions were found also in other paramyxoviruses (43Ghosh J.K. Ovadia M. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15451-15462Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The ability of SV-465 to co-assemble with these regions was examined by the dequenching of Rho-SV-465 fluorescence in the presence of the corresponding unlabeled peptides. An increase in the rhodamine fluorescence of Rho-SV-465 was observed only when unlabeled SV-150 and SV-269 were added, but not when the biologically inactive SV-163 and a mutated SV-269 (L12E18-SV-269) were added (Fig. 3, panel 2). When similar experiments were done with NBD-d-SV-465, no dequenching of fluorescence was observed in the presence of either unlabeled SV-150 or SV-269 (data not shown). These results revealed that SV-465 self-associates and specifically co-assembles with the biologically active SV-269 and SV-150. To get further evidence for the ability of SV-465 to co-assemble with SV-150 and SV-269, circular dichroism experiments were performed as described in the following sections.Secondary Structure of the Peptides in SolutionThe extent of α-helical secondary structure of SV-465, A17,24 SV-465, and d-SV-465 was estimated from their CD spectra, as measured in buffer and in 40% trifluoroethanol (Fig. 4). The mean residual ellipticity values, [θ]222, of the wild type SV-465 in PBS and in 40% trifluoroethanol were −7,501 and −23,887 respectively, which correspond to 18 and 73% helicity, respectively. The mean residual ellipticity of A17,24-SV-465 in PBS and 40% trifluoroethanol were −5,508 and −14,022, respectively. These values correspond to 12 and 40% helicity. Thus these results indicate that substitution of two leucines by two alanines reduces the helicity of the mutant peptide as has been shown also with a heptad repeat of Newcastle disease virus (63Young J.K. Hicks R.P. Wright G.E. Morrison T.G. Virology. 1998; 243: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The CD spectra of d-SV-465 were the mirror images of those of SV-465 as expected (Fig. 4).Figure 4CD spectra of the peptides in different environments.

https://openalex.org/W2011849415,"This study describes the influence of apolipoproteins on the hepatic lipase (HL)-mediated hydrolysis of phospholipids and triacylglycerol in high density lipoproteins (HDL). HL-mediated hydrolysis was assessed in well characterized, homogeneous preparations of spherical reconstituted high density lipoproteins (rHDL). The rHDL were comparable in size and lipid composition and contained either apoA-I ((A-I)rHDL) or apoA-II ((A-II)rHDL) as their sole apolipoprotein constituent. Preparations of rHDL containing only cholesteryl esters (CE) in their core, (A-I/CE)rHDL and (A-II/CE)rHDL, were used to assess phospholipid hydrolysis. Preparations of rHDL that contained triacylglycerol as their predominant core lipid, (A-I/TG)rHDL and (A-II/TG)rHDL, were used to assess both triacylglycerol and phospholipid hydrolysis. The rHDL contained trace amounts of either radiolabeled phospholipid or radiolabeled triacylglycerol. Hydrolysis was measured as the release of radiolabeled nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) from the rHDL. Kinetic analysis showed that HL had a greater affinity for the phospholipids in (A-II/CE)rHDL (K m(app) = 0.2 mm) than in (A-I/CE)rHDL (K m(app) = 3.1 mm). This was also evident when hydrolysis was measured directly by quantitating NEFA mass. HL also had a greater affinity for the phospholipids and triacylglycerol in (A-II/TG)rHDL than in (A-I/TG)rHDL. TheV max for phospholipid hydrolysis was, by contrast, greater for (A-I/CE)rHDL than for (A-II/CE)rHDL: 309.3versus 49.1 nmol of NEFA formed/ml of HL/h. ComparableV max values were obtained for the hydrolysis of the phospholipids in (A-II/TG)rHDL and (A-I/TG)rHDL. In the case of triacylglycerol hydrolysis, the respective V maxvalues for (A-I/TG)rHDL and (A-II/TG)rHDL were 1154.8 and 240.2 nmol of NEFA formed/ml of HL/h. These results show that apolipoproteins have a major influence on the kinetics of HL-mediated phospholipid and triacylglycerol hydrolysis in rHDL.

The main plasma substrates for HL are very low density lipoproteins and high density lipoproteins (HDL). The role of HL in HDL metabolism is of considerable importance, as shown by strong negative associations between HL activity and plasma HDL2levels (3Applebaum-Bowden D. Haffner S.M. Wahl P.W.

Unlike lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which requires apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II) for maximal activity, there is no known protein cofactor for HL. However, there is some conflicting evidence to suggest that the apoA-II in HDL may influence the HL-mediated hydrolysis of triacylglycerol in HDL (7Mowri H.-O. Patsch J.R. Gotto Jr., A.M. Patsch W.

Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 92: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The present study was carried out in order to determine whether there are significant differences in the HL-mediated hydrolysis of phospholipids and triacylglycerol in HDL that differ in their apolipoprotein composition. This has been achieved by using well defined, homogeneous preparations of spherical reconstituted HDL (rHDL) as substrates for HL. The rHDL were comparable in size and lipid composition and contained either apoA-I or apoA-II as their sole apolipoprotein constituent. The results show that apolipoproteins not only have a major influence on the HL-mediated hydrolysis of the triacylglycerol and phospholipids in rHDL but also regulate the affinity of HL for the rHDL surface. ApoA-I and apoA-II were prepared from pooled human plasma donated by the Transfusion Service, Royal Adelaide Hospital. HDL were isolated from the plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation in the 1.07 < d < 1.21 g/ml density range (11Rye K.-A. Garrety K.H. Barter P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 215-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated HDL were delipidated (12Osborne Jr., J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128A: 213-222Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and the resulting apoHDL was subjected to anion exchange chromatography on Q Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) (13Weisweiler P. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1987; 169: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The purified apoA-I and apoA-II appeared as single bands following electrophoresis on a homogeneous 20% SDS-polyacrylamide PhastGel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Coomassie staining. LCAT was purified from pooled human plasma (Transfusion Service, Royal Adelaide Hospital) as described previously (14Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4243-4250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The purified LCAT appeared as a single band following electrophoresis on a homogeneous 20% SDS-gel and silver staining. LCAT activity was assessed as described by Piran and Morin (15Piran U. Morin R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 1040-1043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using as the substrate 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC)/unesterified cholesterol (UC)/apoA-I discoidal rHDL labeled with [1α,2α-3H]cholesterol ([3H]UC). The POPC and [3H]UC were obtained, respectively, from Sigma and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, UK). The assay was linear as long as less than 30% of the [3H]UC was esterified. The preparation used in this study generated 562 nmol of cholesteryl esters (CE)/ml of LCAT/h. CETP was isolated from pooled human plasma (Transfusion Service, Royal Adelaide Hospital) as described previously (16Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3953-3960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 17Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 189-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Transfer activity was quantitated as the transfer of [3H]CE from [3H]CE-HDL3 to low density lipoproteins (LDL) (18Tollefson J.H. Lui A. Albers J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: E894-E902PubMed Google Scholar, 19Burstein M. Scholnick H.R. Morfin R. J. Lipid Res. 1970; 11: 583-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was linear when less than 30% of the total counts were transferred from HDL3 to LDL during a 3-h incubation at 37 °C. The CETP preparation used in this study had 12.6 units of activity/ml, where 1 unit is the transfer activity of 1 ml of pooled, lipoprotein-deficient human plasma. PLTP was purified from pooled human plasma (Transfusion Service, Royal Adelaide Hospital) as described elsewhere (20Rye K.-A. Jauhiainen M. Barter P.J. Ehnholm C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 39: 613-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). PLTP activity was quantitated as the transfer ofl-3–1,2-di[1-14C]palmitoylphosphatidylcholine ([14C]DPPC) (112 mCi/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from [14C]DPPC-labeled phospholipid vesicles to ultracentrifugally isolated HDL during a 2-h incubation at 37 °C (21Speijer H. Groener J.E.M. van Ramshorst E. van Tol A. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 90: 159-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The PLTP preparation used in this study transferred 2700 nmol of phospholipid/ml of PLTP/h. Three pairs of substrates (a and b, c and d, and e and f) were used to study the HL-mediated hydrolysis of phospholipids and triacylglycerol in rHDL (Fig. 1). Each pair of substrates was comparable in size and lipid composition and contained either apoA-I or apoA-II as its sole apolipoprotein. For most of the experiments, the substrates were labeled either with [14C]DPPC, for assessing phospholipid hydrolysis, or [9,10-3H]triolein (28 Ci/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products) ([3H]triolein), for monitoring triacylglycerol hydrolysis. The two substrates (a and b), which were labeled with [14C]DPPC and contained CE in their core, were used to monitor phospholipid hydrolysis in the absence of triacylglycerol hydrolysis. These substrates are designated (A-I/CE)rHDL and (A-II/CE)rHDL. Substrates c and d were also labeled with [14C]DPPC and contained triacylglycerol as their predominant core lipid. They are designated (A-I/TG)rHDL and (A-II/TG)rHDL and were used to study phospholipid hydrolysis against a background of triacylglycerol hydrolysis. The final two substrates, e and f, contained triacylglycerol in their core and were labeled with [3H]triolein. They were used to monitor triacylglycerol hydrolysis. Since the rate of triacylglycerol hydrolysis was much greater than that of phospholipid hydrolysis for both (A-I/TG)rHDL and (A-II/TG)rHDL, we were not able to study the kinetics of phospholipid and triacylglycerol hydrolysis in rHDL, which were doubly labeled with [14C]DPPC and [3H]triolein. Discoidal rHDL containing POPC, UC, and apoA-I were prepared by the cholate dialysis method (22Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The discs were incubated with LDL and LCAT as described previously (23Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to generate spherical rHDL with CE in their core and apoA-I as the sole apolipoprotein constituent, (A-I/CE)rHDL. The (A-I/CE)rHDL were dialyzed extensively against 0.01 mTris-buffered saline (TBS) (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.005% (w/v) EDTA-Na2, and 0.006% (w/v) NaN3before use. The (A-I/CE)rHDL were labeled with [14C]DPPC as follows. [14C] DPPC-labeled phospholipid vesicles were prepared by adding to a clean, dry test tube 0.35 mg POPC in chloroform/methanol (200 μl, 2:1 (v/v)), 1.25 μCi of [14C]DPPC, and 5 μl of 0.5 mm butylated hydroxytoluene in ethanol. The lipids were dispersed as a thin film on the walls of the tube and dried under N2 for 2 h at 40 °C. The phospholipids were resuspended in 0.5 ml of TBS and sonicated for 3 × 5 min, using a Sonifier B-12 (Branson Sonic Power Company, Danbury, CT) equipped with a microtip. The mixture was then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant, which contained the [14C]DPPC-labeled phospholipid vesicles, was collected. Spherical (A-I/CE)rHDL (6.6 μmol phospholipid) were added to the [14C]DPPC-labeled phospholipid vesicles (0.66 μmol of phospholipid) and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of purified PLTP (final transfer activity = 247 nmol of PL transferred/ml of PLTP/h) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) (final concentration = 20 mg/ml). The final volume of the incubation mixture was 5.5 ml. When the incubation was complete, the radiolabeled (A-I/CE)rHDL were isolated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 rpm in the density range 1.063 < d < 1.21 g/ml using a TLA-100.4 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Fullarton, CA) with one 6-h spin at the lower density and another 16-h spin at the higher density. These procedures were carried out at 4 °C in a Beckman TL-100 tabletop ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). The (A-I/CE)rHDL were dialyzed extensively against TBS prior to use. The specific activity of the (A-I/CE)rHDL was 4.8 × 105 dpm/mg of phospholipid. Spherical (A-II/CE)rHDL labeled with [14C]DPPC were prepared by displacing all of the apoA-I from spherical [14C]DPPC-labeled (A-I/CE)rHDL with lipid-free apoA-II as described previously (23Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of the spherical [14C]DPPC-labeled (A-II/CE)rHDL was 5.1 × 105 dpm/mg of phospholipid. These rHDL were prepared by displacing all the apoA-I from unlabeled spherical (A-I/CE)rHDL with lipid-free apoA-II. These unlabeled rHDL preparations were used in experiments where phospholipid hydrolysis was determined directly by measuring nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) mass. Spherical (A-I/TG)rHDL containing triacylglycerol (and a small amount of CE) in their core were prepared as described by Rye et al. (17Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 189-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, spherical (A-I/CE)rHDL (final CE concentration = 0.1 mmol/liter) were mixed with Intralipid (Kabi Pharmacia AB; final triacylglycerol concentration = 4 mmol/liter) and CETP (final concentration = 2.7 units/ml) and then incubated under N2 for 1.25 h at 37 °C. The final volume of the incubation mixture was 51.2 ml. The resulting (A-I/TG)rHDL were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation in the density range 1.063 < d < 1.21 g/ml using a TLA-100.4 rotor (Beckman Instruments) as described previously (17Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 189-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). [14C]DPPC was incorporated into the (A-I/TG)rHDL as described for (A-I/CE)rHDL. Spherical (A-II/TG)rHDL labeled with [14C]DPPC were prepared by displacing all of the apoA-I from [14C]DPPC-labeled (A-I/TG)rHDL with lipid-free apoA-II (23Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activities of the [14C]DPPC-labeled (A-I/TG)rHDL and (A-II/TG)rHDL were 4.6 × 105 and 5.0 × 105 dpm/mg of phospholipid, respectively. Spherical (A-I/TG)rHDL were prepared as described by Rye et al. (17Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 189-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with a slight modification to label the Intralipid with [3H]triolein. Briefly, 50 μCi of [3H]triolein were dried down under N2 and then taken up in 50 μl of ethanol. The [3H]triolein was added to Intralipid (200 mg of triacylglycerol) in a final volume of 1.05 ml, and the mixture was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C under N2. The [3H]triolein-labeled Intralipid (final triacylglycerol concentration = 4 mmol/liter) was then incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C with (A-I/CE)rHDL (final CE concentration = 0.1 mmol/liter) and CETP (final concentration = 2.7 units/ml) in a final volume of 44.8 ml. The resulting [3H]triolein-labeled (A-I/TG)rHDL were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation in the density range 1.063 <d < 1.21 g/ml using a TLA-100.4 rotor (Beckman Instruments) as described elsewhere (17Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 189-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). (A-II/TG)rHDL labeled with [3H]triolein were prepared by displacing apoA-I from [3H]triolein-labeled (A-I/TG)rHDL with lipid-free apoA-II (23Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activities of the [3H]triolein-labeled (A-I/TG)rHDL and (A-II/TG)rHDL were 11.0 × 105 and 10.7 × 105 dpm/mg of triacylglycerol, respectively. HDL2 were isolated from fresh human plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation in the 1.07 < d < 1.12 g/ml density range with two 24-h spins (50,000 rpm) at the lower density followed by a single 40-h spin (50,000 rpm) and one 16-h spin (100,000 rpm) at the higher density. The 50,000 rpm spins were carried out at 4 °C using a Ti-50 rotor in a Beckman L8–70M ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). The 100,000 rpm spin was carried out at 4 °C using a TLA-100.4 rotor in a Beckman TL-100 tabletop ultracentrifuge. The isolated HDL2, which contained apoA-I as the predominant apolipoprotein, is designated (A-I)HDL2. [14C]DPPC was incorporated into the (A-I)HDL2as described for (A-I/CE)rHDL. (A-II)HDL2 labeled with [14C]DPPC were prepared by displacing all of the apoA-I from [14C]DPPC-labeled (A-I)HDL2 with lipid-free apoA-II (23Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activities of the [14C] DPPC-labeled (A-I)HDL2 and (A-II)HDL2 were 3.65 × 105 and 3.53 × 105 dpm/mg of phospholipid, respectively. HL was purified from the blood of patients injected with a bolus of 25,000 IU of heparin prior to undergoing angioplasty (Cardiovascular Investigational Unit, Royal Adelaide Hospital). Postheparin plasma was isolated by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and stored at −70 °C. The pooled postheparin plasma was thawed and added to an equal volume of 0.005m sodium barbitone buffer, 0.45 m NaCl (pH 7.4). The postheparin plasma was applied to an HR 10/30 column containing Heparin Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) preequilibrated with 0.005 m sodium barbitone, 0.15m NaCl (pH 7.4). HL was eluted from the column at a flow rate of 5 ml/min with a linear 0.8–1.3 m NaCl gradient. Fifty IU of heparin was added to the eluted fractions (8 ml) before dialysis against TBS containing 6.3 IU/ml heparin. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated approximately 20-fold in a Centriprep-10 concentrator (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). Heparin was added to the pooled fractions to give a final concentration of 500 IU/ml. The purified HL appeared as a single band following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 20% homogeneous PhastGel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and staining with Coomassie Blue. The HL was stored at −70 °C. HL activity was assessed as the nmol of triacylglycerol hydrolyzed/ml of HL/h using (A-I/TG)rHDL as a substrate. Purified HL (24 μl) was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with (A-I/TG)rHDL (final triacylglycerol concentration = 0.15 mmol/liter) and heparin (final concentration = 500 IU/ml) in the presence or absence of 1m NaCl. The final incubation volume was 120 μl. Triacylglycerol hydrolysis was measured as the decrease in triacylglycerol mass compared with a control incubation that did not contain HL. Since the amount of triacylglycerol hydrolysis was identical in the presence and absence of 1 m NaCl, the HL was judged to be free of LPL activity. It should also be noted that the rHDL preparations were deficient in apoC-II, the cofactor for LPL-mediated triacylglycerol hydrolysis. Triacylglycerol mass was measured by enzymatic assay (24Kohlmeier M. Clin. Chem. 1986; 32: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) using Boehringer Mannheim standards (Mannheim, Germany). The amount of HL activity in individual experiments is presented in the figure legends. All incubations were carried out in stoppered plastic tubes in a shaking water bath at 37 °C. Details of individual incubations are described in the legends to the figures. Chloroform/methanol (1 ml, 2:1 (v/v)), was added to stop the hydrolysis reactions. The lipids were extracted by the method of Folch et al. (25Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NEFA were separated from the other rHDL (or native HDL2) lipids by thin layer chromatography on 20 × 20-cm Silica gel 60 plastic sheets (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The sheets were developed in chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v/v) until the solvent front was 8 cm from the origin. The sheets were dried and then run in hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v) until the solvent front was 17 cm from the origin. A mixture of triolein (Sigma), POPC, and sodium oleate (Sigma) (0.4 mg/ml of each dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v)) was used as a standard. The NEFA and the other lipids were visualized with I2. The spots corresponding to phosphatidylcholine, triacylglycerol, and NEFA were cut from the sheets and placed directly into 10 ml of Ready Safe™ liquid scintillation mixture (Beckman Instruments). Radioactivity was determined using a Beckman LS 6000TA liquid scintillation counter with automatic quenching correction (Beckman Instruments). The silica gel had a negligible effect on the counting. These incubations were carried out exactly as described above for the radiolabeled substrates. Phospholipid hydrolysis was determined directly by assaying the mass of NEFA released from the rHDL. At the end of the incubation period, the tubes containing the incubation mixtures were placed on ice prior to assaying for NEFA. The NEFA concentration was determined using an enzymatic colorimetric assay kit (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). HL-mediated hydrolysis in the radiolabeled substrates was determined as the amount of radiolabel in the NEFA relative to the total radiolabel in the substrate. HL-mediated hydrolysis in the unlabeled (A-I/CE)rHDL and (A-II/CE)rHDL was determined by direct mass assay of the NEFA formed. The kinetic parameters K m(app) and V maxwere estimated from the line of best fit by linear regression analysis of a Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plot of the rate of hydrolysisversus the concentration of substrate. In all cases, the regression coefficients (r) were >0.98.V max was determined as the reciprocal of the intercept on the y axis. The K m(app) was calculated as the product of the slope and V max. All chemical analyses were carried out on a Cobas Fara centrifugal analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Zurich, Switzerland). Boehringer Mannheim kits were used for phospholipid, UC, and total cholesterol assays. CE concentrations were calculated as the difference between the total and UC concentrations. The concentrations of apoA-I and apoA-II were determined by an immunoturbidometric assay (26Eugui J. Logroño M.J. Ruiz R. Zugaza C. Mirabel J.L. Martı́nez C. Clin. Biochem. 1994; 27: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The size of the rHDL and native HDL2 was determined by electrophoresis on 3–35% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gradient gels (Gradipore, Sydney, Australia) (27Rye K.-A. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 335-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The one-tailed, Student's ttest for two samples with equal variance was used to determine whether differences between values were significant. The respective molar ratios of phospholipid/UC/CE/A-I/A-II in the (A-I/CE)rHDL and (A-II/CE)rHDL labeled with [14C]DPPC were 89.2/9.4/71.4/3.0/0.0 and 79.4/8.1/63.6/0.1/6.0. Since cross-linking studies have shown that spherical (A-I)rHDL and (A-II)rHDL of comparable size and composition contain three and six apolipoprotein molecules/particle, respectively (16Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3953-3960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the molar ratios in Table I are expressed relative to the number of apolipoprotein molecules. The composition of the native HDL2 is expressed as percentage of mass. The data in Table I confirm that displacement of apoA-I from (A-I/CE)rHDL by lipid-free apoA-II does not promote displacement of rHDL lipid constituents (23Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As such, the (A-I/CE)rHDL and (A-II/CE)rHDL differed only in their apolipoprotein composition. This was also the case for both the (A-I/TG)rHDL and (A-II/TG)rHDL and the (A-I)HDL2 and (A-II)HDL2. The slight increase in the diameter of the (A-II/CE)rHDL and (A-II/TG)rHDL relative to their apoA-I-containing precursors is consistent with what has been reported earlier by this laboratory (23Rye K.-A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The diameter of the (A-II)HDL2 was also slightly larger than that of the (A-I)HDL2.Table IPhysical properties of spherical rHDL and HDL2Spherical rHDLRadiolabeled constituentStoichiometry1-aStoichiometries were calculated from the means of triplicate determinations that varied by less than 7%.

So far, receptor antagonists for interleukin-6-type cytokines have been constructed that still bind to the specific ligand binding subunit of the receptor complex, but have lost the ability to stimulate gp130. Such receptor antagonists compete for a specific receptor of a member of the cytokine family. Interleukin-6 only binds to gp130 when complexed with the interleukin-6 receptor that exists as a membrane bound and soluble molecule. Here we have constructed fusion proteins that consist of the soluble form of the human interleukin-6 receptor covalently linked to interleukin-6 receptor antagonists. These fusion proteins directly bind to gp130. Moreover, at concentrations of 10–50 nm they completely neutralize not only the biological activity of interleukin-6 but also of other cytokines of the interleukin-6-type family that act via gp130 homodimers or gp130/LIF-R heterodimers. Therefore, these gp130 targeting cytokine antagonists might be useful therapeutic tools in disease states that are related to cytokines of the interleukin-6 family.

Interleukin-6-type cytokines (IL1-6, IL-11, CT-1, CNTF, LIF, OSM) share the same folding topology of a four-helix bundle (1Bazan J.F. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 350-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar,2Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). They all act via receptor complexes containing at least one molecule of gp130, the common signal-transducing protein of the IL-6-type family of cytokines (2Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Whereas IL-6 and IL-11 use a homodimer of gp130, CT-1, CNTF, LIF, and OSM require a heterodimer consisting of gp130 and the LIF-receptor (LIF-R) (2Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that, in the human system, OSM additionally binds and acts via a receptor complex consisting of gp130 and OSM-receptor, a protein related to gp130 and LIF-R (3Mosley B. De Imus C. Friend D. Boiani N. Thoma B. Park L.S. Cosman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32635-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). However, in mice, OSM only acts via the gp130 and OSM-receptor (4Ichihara M. Hara T. Kim H. Murate T. Miyajima A. Blood. 1997; 90: 165-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, IL-6, IL-11, CT-1, and CNTF bind first to specific receptor proteins and these complexes associate with the gp130 homodimer or the gp130/ILIF-R heterodimer. In contrast, LIF and OSM bind directly to LIF-R and gp130, respectively, leading to the formation of heterodimeric gp130·LIF-R or gp130·OSM-R complexes (2Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). An increased expression of IL-6 has been reported for several diseases like plasmacytoma/myeloma, Castleman's disease, mesanglial proliferative glomerulonephritis, osteoporosis, autoimmune diseases, and AIDS (5Akira S. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 1-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kallen K.-J. Meyer zum Büschenfelde K.H. Rose-John S. Exp. Opin. Invest.

The administration of IL-6-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to patients with rheumathoid arthritis and multiple myeloma has highly improved the conditions of the patients for several weeks (7Klein B.

Regrettably, the symptoms returned, because the high stability of antibodies in plasma increased the circulating levels of IL-6 that is normally cleared from the circulation within several minutes (9Castell J.

Direct stimulation of gp130 on such cells with the combination of IL-6/sIL-6R might prove to be of therapeutic value although the concentrations needed for effective stimulation make such an application difficult. We have recently constructed a designer cytokine (Hyper-IL-6) consisting of the bioactive parts of IL-6 and sIL-6R fused by a flexible protein linker. This cytokine was 100–1,000 times more active than the separate proteins IL-6 and sIL-6R (27Fischer M. Goldschmitt J. Peschel C. Kallen K.J. Brakenhoff J.P.J. Wollmer A. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Because the designer cytokine Hyper-IL-6 directly binds to and stimulates gp130, we speculated that the fusion of sIL-6R to IL-6 receptor antagonists via a flexible peptide linker would result in proteins that would bind to one gp130 protein without inducing its dimerization, thereby acting as an effective antagonist. Because gp130 is a constituent of all receptor complexes of the IL-6 family of cytokines, we analyzed whether these designer cytokine antagonists could inhibit receptor complexes consisting of gp130/gp130 homodimers or gp130/LIF-R heterodimers. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glutamax, minimum Eagle's medium, and penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Eggenstein, Germany). Fetal calf serum was obtained from Seromed (Berlin, Germany). The human sIL-6R ELISA was purchased from CLB (Hiss Diagnostics, Freiburg, Germany). DEAE-dextran and Nonidet P-40 were obtained from Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany). Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Freiburg, Germany). Restriction enzymes, T4-DNA-ligase and Vent polymerase were from New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany). Tran35S-label (44 TBq/mmol) was from ICN (Meckenheim, Germany) and [3H]thymidine was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Aylesbury, U.K.). X-ray films (X-OMAT-AR) were from Eastman Kodak Co. The following antibodies have been used: MT18, recognizing the NH2-terminal immunoglobulin domain of the human IL-6R (28Hirata Y. Taga T. Hibi M. Nakano N. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2900-2906PubMed Google Scholar); IL-6-mAb-8, recognizing human IL-6 (29Brakenhoff J.P. Hart M. De Groot E.R. Di Padova F. Aarden L.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 561-568PubMed Google Scholar). Human hepatoma cells (HepG2), COS-7, and BAF/3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 5% CO2 and 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere. The culture medium was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 60 mg/liter penicillin. Standard cloning procedures were performed as described by Sambrook et al.(30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). H-DFRD was constructed in a three-step process by PCR-ligation-PCR (31Ali S.A. Steinkasserer A. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 746-750PubMed Google Scholar). As the first step three fragments of H-DFRD were made using the previous described H-IL-6 (27Fischer M. Goldschmitt J. Peschel C. Kallen K.J. Brakenhoff J.P.J. Wollmer A. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) as the common template. The PCR leading to the first fragment used the following oligonucleotides as primers 5′-CAGCATCACTGTGTCATCCAC-3′ (s1) sense and 5′-GAGGATATCCCGAATTTGTTTGTCAAT-3′ (as1) antisense for the second fragment the primers 5′-CGGGATATCCTCGACTTCATCTCAGCCCTGAGAAAG-3′ (s2) sense and 5′-TGTTCTCATCTGCACAGCTCTGGC-3′ (as2) antisense were used the third fragment was made with the primers 5′-AAAGACCTGATCCAGTTCCTGCAG-3′ (s3) sense and a pCDM8 reverse primer (as3). The mutated nucleotides are underlined. As the second step the fragments were ligated by digesting the first and the second fragment with EcoRV and ligating them. After phosphorylation, the ligation product was amplified by a second PCR round using the primers s1 and as2. The product of this PCR was ligated via blunt ends to the third PCR fragment of step one, and a final PCR was made using the primers s1 and as3 for amplification. As the third step the last PCR product was cloned into the pCDM8 expression vector. Thereafter, the PCR DNA and pCDM8 containing H-IL-6 were digested with the unique sites XhoI and NotI and then ligated. For the construction of a H-AIL-6 cDNA, aEcoNI/NotI fragment of the previously constructed IL-6 receptor antagonist cDNA IL-6–2a2/3C9 in the vector pRSET (15Ehlers M. de Hon F.D. Bos H.K. Horsten U.

COS-7 cells were transiently transfected using the DEAE-dextran (32Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Sollner-Webb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). After 48 h, medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% fetal calf serum penicillin/streptomycin. After 72 h, the supernatant was collected and concentrated 10-fold by ultrafiltration. Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were metabolically labeled with 50 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine/methionine for 6 h in cysteine/methionine-free minimum Eagle's medium. The supernatant was harvested, supplemented with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and pretreated with pansorbin (Calbiochem). After incubation with the appropriate antibody or fusion protein for 5 h at 4 °C, the immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose preincubated with COS-7 supernatant of unlabeled cells, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7.5%) electrophoresis and visualized by fluorography. Proliferation assays were performed with stably transfected BAF/3 cells treated with increasing amounts of IL-6, LIF, OSM, CNTF, and H-IL-6 and antagonized with H-DFRD or H-AIL-6 at the concentrations indicated in the figures. Proliferation of the cells was measured after 72 h by pulse labeling with [3H]thymidine for 4.5 h. Radioactivity incorporated in the DNA was determined by scintillation counting. Supernatants of transiently transfected COS-7 cells were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7.5%) electrophoresis and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The proteins were detected by a murine monoclonal IL-6 specific antibody (mAb-8) (29Brakenhoff J.P. Hart M. De Groot E.R. Di Padova F. Aarden L.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 561-568PubMed Google Scholar) and visualized via peroxidase reaction by a secondary POD-linked rabbit IgG anti-mouse antibody. HepG2 cells were stimulated as described, and activation was measured as the secretion of the acute phase protein haptoglobin that was analyzed by ELISA (33Oppmann B. Stoyan T. Fischer M. Voltz N. März P. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 195: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). IL-6 is a four-helix bundle cytokine that interacts with a receptor complex consisting of IL-6R and a homodimer of gp130. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the interaction sites of IL-6 with the receptor subunits have been named site I (contact site to IL-6R), site II (contact site to gp130) (14Savino R. Ciapponi L. Lahm A. Demartis A. Cabibbo A. Toniatti C. Delmastro P. Altamura S. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5863-5870Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and site III (contact site to gp130) (11Ehlers M.

A schematic representation of the IL-6 receptor antagonists (Fig. 1 B) and the fusion proteins (Fig. 1 C) used in this study is shown. H-IL-6 is a recently developed fusion protein with the sIL-6R covalently linked to human IL-6 by a 13-amino acid peptide linker (27Fischer M. Goldschmitt J. Peschel C. Kallen K.J. Brakenhoff J.P.J. Wollmer A. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The sIL-6R is linked either to human IL-6 (H-IL-6) or to an IL-6 receptor antagonist with a defective site II (H-DFRD) (14Savino R. Ciapponi L. Lahm A. Demartis A. Cabibbo A. Toniatti C. Delmastro P. Altamura S. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5863-5870Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or a defective site III (H-AIL-6) (11Ehlers M. Grötzinger J. de Hon F.D. Müllberg J. Brakenhoff J.P.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cDNAs coding for the fusion proteins were transfected into COS-7 cells, and the secreted proteins were quantified using a sIL-6R ELISA (Fig. 2 A). The supernatants were adjusted to equal fusion protein concentrations. As shown in Fig. 2 B, approximately equal amounts were detected on a Western blot using an anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody. The somewhat weaker detection of the fusion protein H-AIL-6 might be because of reduced recognition of the mutated IL-6 within the fusion protein by the monoclonal antibody used for detection. The fusion protein H-IL-6 has been shown to directly stimulate gp130 expressed on target cells (27Fischer M. Goldschmitt J. Peschel C. Kallen K.J. Brakenhoff J.P.J. Wollmer A. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins H-DFRD and H-AIL-6 each have one defective contact site to gp130, either site II or site III, respectively (14Savino R. Ciapponi L. Lahm A. Demartis A. Cabibbo A. Toniatti C. Delmastro P. Altamura S. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5863-5870Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 15Ehlers M. de Hon F.D. Bos H.K. Horsten U. Kurapkat G. van De Leur H.S. Grötzinger J.

They should, however, still be able to bind to gp130 via the second site. To test for the binding ability of the fusion proteins, we metabolically labeled COS-7 cells that had been transfected with H-IL-6, H-DFRD, and H-AIL-6 cDNAs. To confirm equal expression of the fusion proteins, the supernatants of the transfected COS-7 cells were immunoprecipitated with the mAb MT18, which recognized the NH2-terminal immunoglobulin domain of the human IL-6R (28Hirata Y. Taga T. Hibi M. Nakano N. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2900-2906PubMed Google Scholar). The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and gels were subjected to fluorography. As shown in Fig. 3 A, this procedure led to the precipitation of proteins of an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa. The approximately equal intensities indicate equal protein concentrations in the supernatant of transfected cells. In a parallel experiment, a fusion protein consisting of the extracellular portion of human gp130 fused to the constant part of human immunoglobulin (Fc) was added to the supernatants of transfected COS-7 cells. Supernatants were treated with protein A-Sepharose, and precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to fluorography. As shown in Fig. 3 B, radiolabeled H-IL-6, H-DFRD, and H-AIL-6 were all precipitated by the gp130-Fc protein albeit with slightly different efficiencies. H-IL-6 and H-DFRD were precipitated at nearly equal amounts compared with H-AIL-6 that was precipitated with reduced efficiency. From this experiment it can be concluded that the three fusion proteins directly bind to the extracellular portion of gp130. We speculated that the fusion proteins H-DFRD and H-AIL-6, which both had only one intact contact site to gp130, would bind to and block gp130 by preventing homodimerization with gp130 or heterodimerization with LIF-R. We first tested whether the fusion proteins H-DFRD and H-AIL-6 exhibited biological activity on gp130-expressing cells. We used IL-3-dependent BAF/3 cells stably transfected with a human gp130 cDNA (27Fischer M. Goldschmitt J. Peschel C. Kallen K.J. Brakenhoff J.P.J. Wollmer A. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 4, in the absence of IL-3 these cells proliferate when stimulated with 10 ng/ml H-IL-6. In contrast, stimulation of cells with H-DFRD and H-AIL-6 at concentrations up to 5 μg/ml led to no [3H]thymidine incorporation. This experiment clearly demonstrated that in contrast to H-IL-6, the fusion proteins H-DFRD and H-AIL-6 possessed no intrinsic biological activity. We next asked whether the proteins H-DFRD and H-AIL-6 were able to inhibit the growth of BAF/3 cells stably transfected with human gp130 and human IL-6R cDNAs. These cells can be stimulated by human IL-6 with half-maximal proliferation achieved at 0.5 ng/ml IL-6 (Fig. 5 A). To cells stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml IL-6 we added increasing amounts of the two fusion proteins H-DFRD and H-AIL-6. The H-DFRD and H-AIL-6 fusion proteins completely inhibited the proliferation of the cells with an IC50 of 300–500 ng/ml as shown in Fig. 5 B. An identical amount of COS-7 supernatants of mock transfected cells did not affect the IL-6-stimulated proliferation of gp130-transfected BAF/3 cells (data not shown). As an additional control we used the IL-6R specific IL-6 antagonists 2a2/3C9 (15Ehlers M. de Hon F.D. Bos H.K. Horsten U. Kurapkat G. van De Leur H.S. Grötzinger J. Wollmer A. Brakenhoff J.P. Rose-John S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8158-8163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and DFRD (14Savino R. Ciapponi L. Lahm A. Demartis A. Cabibbo A. Toniatti C. Delmastro P. Altamura S. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5863-5870Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). As described previously (14Savino R. Ciapponi L. Lahm A. Demartis A. Cabibbo A. Toniatti C. Delmastro P. Altamura S. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5863-5870Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 15Ehlers M. de Hon F.D. Bos H.K. Horsten U.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8158-8163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) these proteins inhibited the IL-6-induced proliferation of BAF/3 cells transfected with gp130 and IL-6R cDNAs. The LIF, OSM, or CNTF-induced proliferation of BAF/3 cells stably transfected with gp130, LIF-R, and CNTF-R remained unaffected by the two IL-6 antagonists 2a2/3C9 and DFRD (data not shown). When BAF/3 cells stably transfected with human gp130 were used, proliferation can be stimulated with the fusion protein H-IL-6 (27Fischer M. Goldschmitt J. Peschel C. Kallen K.J. Brakenhoff J.P.J. Wollmer A. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Cells grown in the presence of 10 ng/ml H-IL-6 were treated with increasing doses of H-DFRD and H-AIL-6. As shown in Fig. 6, the two fusion antagonists inhibited growth of the gp130-transfected BAF/3 cells with an IC50 of about 1,000 ng/ml. Because the fusion antagonistic proteins were effective in blocking the activity of IL-6 and H-IL-6 due to the fact that the proteins directly bind to gp130, we tested whether these proteins might also block the biologic response of cytokines that induce heterodimerization of gp130 and LIF-R. We therefore tested the fusion proteins for their ability to inhibit proliferation of BAF/3 cells stably transfected with human gp130, human LIF-R and human CNTF-R cDNAs. These cells were stimulated with LIF, OSM, or CNTF. Fig. 7 A shows that BAF/3 cells stably transfected with these cDNAs proliferated in response to the cytokines LIF and CNTF with EC50 values of about 1 ng/ml. The EC50 for OSM was slightly higher, about 5 ng/ml. The proliferation induced by LIF was inhibited by both fusion proteins with an IC50 of around 100 ng/ml (Fig. 7 B). The inhibition of the biologic activity of OSM and CNTF, however, occurred with an IC50 dose of about 500 ng/ml (Fig. 7,C and D). On hepatoma cells, cytokines of the IL-6 family have been shown to induce the synthesis and secretion of acute phase proteins (2Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 35Gauldie J. Richards C. Harnish D. Lansdorp P. Baumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7251-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). Therefore we tested if the constructed fusion proteins were able to block the biological activity on HepG2 cells of gp130/LIF-R requiring cytokines. HepG2 cells treated with increasing amounts of human LIF secreted the acute phase protein haptoglobin into the supernatant (36Mackiewicz A. Schooltink H. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2021-2027PubMed Google Scholar). Haptoglobin concentration can be measured by ELISA (33Oppmann B. Stoyan T. Fischer M. Voltz N. März P. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 195: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8 A, HepG2 cells stimulated with LIF secreted haptoglobin into the medium with maximal stimulation at 25–50 ng/ml. When HepG2 cells stimulated with 25 ng/ml human LIF were treated with increasing amounts of the H-DFRD and H-AIL-6 fusion proteins, haptoglobin secretion was reduced to background levels. The inhibition of the biologic activity of LIF on HepG2 cells occurred with an IC50 dose of 200 ng/ml for H-AIL-6 and more than 1,000 ng/ml for H-DFRD. We have used the approach to covalently link IL-6 or IL-6 muteins with one defective contact site for gp130 (IL-6 receptor antagonists) to the soluble form of the IL-6R to create fusion proteins which directly bind to gp130. These fusion proteins directly target the extracellular portion of gp130 and therefore inhibit cytokines of the IL-6-type family, which interact with either a homodimer of gp130 (like IL-6) or with a heterodimer of gp130 and LIF-R (like CNTF, OSM and CNTF). The coprecipitation studies with the extracellular portion of gp130 linked to an Fc protein revealed that H-IL-6 and H-DFRD proteins bind equally well to gp130, whereas H-AIL-6 seemed to bind with somewhat reduced efficiency. Experiments with IL-6 receptor antagonists in the presence of soluble IL-6R and a soluble form of gp130 with a C-terminalmyc tag led to the conclusion that site II and site III act independently from each other as binding sites for gp130 (37Ciapponi L. Graziani R. Paonessa G. Lahm A. Ciliberto G. Savino R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31249-31254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although coprecipitation with a gp130-Fc fusion protein does not necessarily reflect the situation on the plasma membrane, these data might indicate that site III of IL-6 is more important for gp130 contact than site II. This notion is, however, not supported by the inhibition data presented in this mansucript. One would expect that H-DFRD being a better binder of gp130 would be a more effective antagonist of gp130. The fusion proteins H-AIL-6 and H-DFRD, however, are not significantly different in their inhibitory efficiency. Disregulation of the expression of cytokines of the IL-6-type family has been implicated in the pathophysiology of many diseases including Castleman's disease, multiple myeloma, osteoporosis, and the development of Kaposi's sarcoma (6Kallen K.-J. Meyer zum Büschenfelde K.H. Rose-John S. Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs. 1997; 6: 237-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Efforts have been made to neutralize the activity of the IL-6-type cytokines by mAbs or cytokine receptor antagonists (7Klein B. Wijdenes J. Zhang X.G. Jourdan M. Boiron J.M. Brochier J. Liautard J.

Today. 1994; 15: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently we reported on the development of a specific targeting strategy of cytokine-secreting cells by a bispecific diabody recognizing human IL-6 and CD3, which induced T-cell-mediated killing of these cells (40Krebs B. Griffin H. Winter G. Rose-John S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2858-2865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All these strategies, however, act to neutralize or block one given cytokine. IL-6 receptor antagonists or neutralizing mAbs do not neutralize the biologic activity of IL-11, LIF, OSM, CNTF, or CT-1. In the case of multiple myeloma cells, it has been shown that these cells not only proliferate in response to IL-6 but also in the presence of other if not all members of the IL-6 cytokine family (16Zhang X.G. Gu J.J. Lu Z.Y. Yasukawa K. Yancopoulos G.D. Turner K. Shoyab M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Bataille R. Klein B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1337-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The gp130-interacting antagonist presented in this report has the great advantage of blocking gp130 directly and thereby blocking the biological activities all members of the IL-6-type family of cytokines. In addition, it has recently been demonstrated that IL-6 bound to soluble IL-6R has a longer plasma half-life in vivo than IL-6 alone (41Peters M. Jacobs S. Ehlers M. Vollmer P. Müllberg J. Wolf E. Brem G. Meyer zum Büschenfelde K.H. Rose-John S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1399-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have recently shown that the fusion protein H-IL-6 when injected into mice has a considerably longer bioavailability than IL-6 alone. 2M. Peters and S. Rose-John, manuscript in preparation. We therefore anticipate that our newly developed gp130-targeting fusion proteins will also show a more favorable pharmacokinetics than do IL-6 receptor antagonists (41Peters M. Jacobs S. Ehlers M. Vollmer P. Müllberg J. Wolf E. Brem G. Meyer zum Büschenfelde K.H. Rose-John S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1399-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). On the other hand, one has to be aware that pleiotropic side effects upon injection of the fusion proteins might occur, because gp130 is present on all cells of the body and is involved in a wide spectrum of cellular activities (2Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Recently, an inhibitor of LIF was constructed that exhibited a lowered affinity for gp130 because of introduced point mutations, whereas the affinity for LIF-R was unchanged (42Vernalis A.B.

Consequently, this LIF-R antagonist was shown to possess antagonistic activity not only for LIF but also for the LIF-R binding cytokines CT-1, CNTF, and OSM (42Vernalis A.B. Hudson K.R. Heath J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26947-26952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Taken together we have provided evidence that fusion proteins of IL-6 receptor antagonists and the soluble IL-6R can be used to directly target the receptor subunit gp130, which is a component of all receptor complexes of the IL-6 cytokine family. These fusion proteins when given at a molar excess are able to bind to the extracellular portion of gp130. Therefore we have for the first time constructed an antagonist with the potential to block all cytokines of the IL-6-type family. These novel inhibitors of IL-6-type cytokines might have therapeutic implications for diseases that have been connected with disregulation of the expression of these cytokines. We thank Dr. R.

We have developed a means of examining in vivo protein folding and assembly that utilizes the coat protein of bacteriophage P22, a naturally occurring substrate of GroEL/S. Here we show that amino acid substitutions in coat protein that cause a temperature-sensitive-folding (tsf) phenotype slowed assembly rates upon increasing the temperature of cell growth. Raising cellular concentrations of GroEL/S increased the rate of assembly of the tsf mutant coat proteins to nearly that of wild-type (WT) coat protein by protecting a thermolabile folding intermediate from aggregation, thereby increasing the concentration of assembly-competent coat protein. The rate of release of thetsf coat proteins from the GroEL/S-coat protein ternary complex was approximately 2-fold slower at non-permissive temperatures when compared with the release of WT coat protein. However, the rate of release of WT or tsf coat proteins at each temperature remained constant regardless of GroEL/S levels. Thus, raising the cellular concentration of GroEL/S increased the amount of assembly-competent tsf coat proteins not by altering the rates of folding but by increasing the probability of GroEL/S-coat protein complex formation.

Characterizing the folding of polypeptides in vivo is difficult because of the transient nature of their folding intermediates and because the intracellular environment can influence the kinetic partitioning between productive and non-productive folding pathways (1King J. Hasse-Pettingell C. Robinson A.S.S. Speed M. Mitraki A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Consequently, most studies of the mechanism of protein folding have been conducted in vitro using defined assay conditions. Recently, there has been much attention given to a class of proteins called molecular chaperones, which assist folding polypeptides in reaching their native structure. It is believed that the chaperonins, the hsp60 subclass of molecular chaperones, allow folding intermediates the opportunity to avoid kinetic traps by associating with misfolding polypeptide chains thereby preventing aggregation (2Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar,3Martin J. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The complex of GroEL/S, the prokaryotic chaperonins (4Georgopoulos C.P. Hendrix R.W. Casjens S.R. Kaiser A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), forms as a homo-oligomeric double toroid consisting of 14 GroEL monomers (57 kDa) and a single ring cap of seven GroES monomers (10 kDa). A current debate about the mechanism of GroEL/S concerns the extent of structure in substrate polypeptides upon release from the GroEL inner chamber (for review, see Ref. 2Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Regardless of the mechanism, it is believed that the increase in the yield of native protein is correlated to its rate of folding, i.e. a polypeptide that is folding slowly is more prone to aggregation (5Peralta D. Hartman D.J. Hoogenraad N.J. Hoj P.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Ranson N.A. Dunster N.J. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In order to study this hypothesis, folding kinetics for many GroEL/S substrates have been analyzed.In vitro rates of folding have been shown to both increase (5Peralta D. Hartman D.J. Hoogenraad N.J. Hoj P.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7Staniforth R.A. Burston S.G. Atkinson T. Clarke A.R.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2554-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) as a result of GroEL/S action. In addition, yields of citrate synthase (9Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmit F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (10Miller A.D. Maghlaoui K. Alabnese G. Kleinjan D.A. Smith C. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have been shown to be enhanced by GroEL/S while the rates of folding remained unaffected. To date, there has been little information about how GroEL/S affects the folding of substrate proteins within the cell. Recently, macromolecular crowding has been shown to affect the rate of release of rhodanese from GroEL/S in vitro (3Martin J. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition, the rates of release of rhodanese from GroEL and its partitioning into soluble and aggregated states have been calculated in vivo, and the total polypeptide flux has been examined within the cell (11Ewait K.L. Hendrick J.P. Houry W.A. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1997; 90: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To understand how the flux of a naturally occurring substrate is controlled by GroEL/S in vivo, we utilized the coat protein of phage P22 and itstsf 1 mutants, which misfold at high temperatures yet fold correctly at lower temperatures (12Gordon C.L. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9358-9368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies of the folding of WT and tsf coat proteins conducted in vitro have shown that WT coat protein folds into assembly-competent monomeric subunits with high efficiency (13Teschke C.M. King J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10839-10847Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Prevelige Jr., P.E. Thomas D. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 743-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, the tsf coat protein mutants fold into dimers and trimers with altered secondary and tertiary structure (15Teschke C.M. King J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6815-6826Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Galisteo M.L. Gordon C.L. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16595-16601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recent experiments demonstrated thattsf coat proteins refolded in 20 mm phosphate buffer are assembly-competent, albeit with reduced kinetics. 2C. M. Teschke, unpublished results. Thus, we will be able to compare our in vivo folding results to foldingin vitro where defined conditions were used. Bacteriophage P22 is a lambdoid-like phage with a capsid composed of coat protein (gene product 5) subunits arranged in a T= 7 icosahedron (17Casjens S. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Procapsid assembly occurs by the association of 420 molecules of coat protein with 150–200 molecules of scaffolding protein (gene product 8) along with minor proteins in a nucleation dependent reaction (Fig. 1) (18Casjens S. King J. J. Supramol. Struct. 1974; 2: 202-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 19Earnshaw W. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 126: 721-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Bazinet C. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Greene B. King J.

Therefore, any change in the kinetics of the folding of coat protein into the assembly-competent state influences the rate of nucleus formation, which subsequently affects the rate of procapsid assembly. After the formation of the procapsid, DNA packaging occurs through a headful mechanism (20Bazinet C. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) along with concomitant release of scaffolding protein and a conformational change of the procapsid from spherical to icosahedral (23Earnshaw W. Casjens S. Harrison S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 387-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 24Prasad B.V. Prevelige P.E. Marietta E. Chen R.O. Thomas D. King J. Chiu W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Addition of several proteins, such as the plug proteins of the portal vertex (gene products 4, 10, and 26) and tailspike protein (gene product 9), then complete the infectious particle. In order to investigate how GroEL/S controls the flux of coat protein in the cell, we have established a means of examining the productive and non-productive folding pathways in vivo. In this study, we have used the rate of formation of the procapsid to monitor the folding of coat polypeptides into the assembly-competent conformation within the cell (25Gordon C.L. Sather S.K. Casjens S. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27941-27951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the non-productive folding pathway, we used the amount of coat protein in the pellet after a short centrifugation as a barometer of aggregation. The rate of release of coat protein from the GroEL-coat protein ternary complex and the effect of elevated levels of GroEL/S upon this system were also determined. At high temperatures, the release rates of tsf coat protein from the GroEL/S-coat protein ternary complex were approximately 2-fold slower compared with WT coat protein, regardless of the level of GroEL/S expression. Aggregation increased as temperatures were raised, and GroEL/S overexpression decreased the amount of aggregate. We found that the rate of assembly of the tsf polypeptides was slower at high temperatures and that GroEL/S overexpression increased these assembly rates. Thus, GroEL/S overexpression increased the concentration of assembly-competent coat protein by increasing the frequency of coat protein and GroEL/S association and not by changing the rate of folding of the tsf coat protein mutants within the GroEL/S-coat protein ternary complex. These conditions likely mimic those found in a severely stressed cell. Salmonella typhimurium strain DB7000 (leu A414am) contained either pOF39, a plasmid that carries the groEL/S operon behind its own promoter (26Fayet O. Louarn J.M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 202: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), or pBR322 as the control plasmid. All cells were ampicillin-resistant due to the presence of the plasmid and were grown in Luria broth or minimal media with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. In addition, the strains DB7136 (leu A414am, his C525am) and DB7155 (leu A414am, his C525am, supE), a derivative of DB7136 that carries the glutamine amber suppressor and allows the growth of P22 strains carrying amber mutations, were used in some plating experiments (27Winston F. Botstein D. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 433-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TheEscherichia coli strains (4Georgopoulos C.P. Hendrix R.W. Casjens S.R. Kaiser A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 28Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Baird L. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1134-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) DW720 (WT groEL and groES), DW716 (groEL44), DW717 (groEL59), DW721 (groEL673), DW715 (groEL764), and DW619 (groES619) were transformed with the plasmid pPR1347 (29Neal B.L. Brown P.K. Reeves P.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7115-7118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which encodes for the rfb gene cluster and rfcgene so that the E. coli synthesizes the O antigen needed for P22 infection. The plasmid was maintained by growing cells in media with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. The P22 bacteriophage used in this study either were WT in gene 5, which encodes coat protein, or carried thetsf mutations in gene 5, which lead to the amino acid substitutions serine at position 223 for phenylalanine (S223F) or alanine at position 108 for valine (A108V) (12Gordon C.L. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9358-9368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All phage used possessed the c1–7 allele to prevent lysogeny. In some experiments, the phage also carried amber mutations in gene 13 to prevent cell lysis, and gene 3 to prevent DNA packaging, in order to produce procapsids (30King J. Lenk E.V. Botstein D. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 697-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). M9 media contained 0.6% NaHPO4, 0.3% KH2PO4, 0.05% NaCl, and 0.01% NH4Cl (31Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431Google Scholar). Minimal media was M9 with 1 mmMgSO4, 1 μm FeCl3 and CaCl2, 4% glucose, 150 μm amino acids (except methionine and cysteine), and ampicillin (100 μg/ml). For storing phage stocks, dilution fluid containing 0.1% tryptone, 0.7% NaCl, and 2 mm MgSO4 was used (25Gordon C.L. Sather S.K. Casjens S. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27941-27951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DB7000 carrying the plasmids pOF39 or pBR322 were grown in minimal media at temperatures ranging from 30 °C to 39 °C and concentrated to a density of 4 × 108cell/ml in fresh media. The cells were infected with phage at a multiplicity of infection of 10. After 2 h of infection, an aliquot of cells was removed and diluted in dilution fluid saturated with chloroform to lyse infected cells. Dilutions of phage were plated on DB7136 cells to determine the number of phage produced/cell in each strain at a given temperature (32Gordon C.L. King J. Genetics. 1994; 136: 427-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phage with either WT gene 5 or gene 5tsf mutations were plated at various temperatures onE. coli strains as mentioned above. Plating efficiencies were calculated by dividing the titer of the phage grown at each temperature and on each strain of cells by the titer produced when the phage was grown at 22 °C on DW720 (12Gordon C.L. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9358-9368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Minimal media inoculated with an overnight culture was grown at the experimental temperature to a density of 2.5 × 108 cells/ml, chilled on ice for at least 15 min, and stored at 4 °C overnight. The cells were diluted 1:10 with minimal media and grown to 2.5 × 108 cells/ml at the experimental temperature, and then chilled on ice for 15 min before infection. Phage infection was carried out at a multiplicity of infection of 15 and incubated for 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65 min at 39, 37, 35, 33, 30, and 28 °C, respectively. The cells were then pulsed with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine protein labeling mix (10 mCi/ml, NEN Life Science Products) for 1 min at a final isotope concentration of 20 μCi/ml. Incorporation was halted by the addition of unlabeled Met/Cys (final concentration 26 mm). Immediately after the addition of unlabeled Met/Cys, an aliquot of cells was transferred into a tube containing EDTA (final concentration 17 mm) and frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Samples were taken at intervals after initial infection and quickly frozen by the same method. Temperature shift down experiments were performed as described above, except aliquots were shifted from 39 °C to 30 °C for 75 min prior to rapid freezing. The thawed samples from both assembly and temperature shift down experiments were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.2% HGT Seakem (American Bioanalytical) agarose gel to separate procapsids from other labeled proteins (33Serwer P. Pichler M.E. J. Virol. 1978; 28: 917-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Galisteo M.L. King J. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 227-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 35Teschke C.M. Fong D.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14831-14840Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The incorporation of labeled coat protein into procapsids was analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad GS-525) or by scintillation counting. Samples quantified by scintillation counting were prepared by excising bands containing radiolabeled procapsids rehydrated in 300 μl of double-distilled H2O at 60 °C for 30 min, followed by elution of the isotope in 300 μl of Solvable (DuPont). Samples were heated to 60 °C for 3 h, and then incubated at room temperature for 24 h after the addition of scintillation mixture. For the assembly experiments, half-times were determined using the formula x max −x t/Δx to calculate the fraction of correctly folded coat protein. In this formula,x max refers to the maximum amount of35S label incorporated into procapsids,x t is the amount of isotope incorporation at a given time point, and Δx is the total change in isotope incorporation (x max −x o). The results were then plotted on a log scale against time, and t½ values were calculated by determining the time at which half-maximal incorporation occurred. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described in Gordon et al. (25Gordon C.L. Sather S.K. Casjens S. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27941-27951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with radiolabeling as described above with the exception that infected cells were pulsed for 30 s and the final concentration of unlabeled methionine and cysteine was 1 mm. Following immunoprecipitation, GroEL-coat protein complexes were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Quantification of GroEL and coat protein bands was performed by phosphorimaging. Each time point was normalized to the efficiency of immunoprecipitation by dividing the percentage of coat protein co-immunoprecipitated of the total coat protein produced by the percentage of GroEL immunoprecipitated of the total GroEL produced to give percentage of coat protein bound. Thet½ of release of coat protein from GroEL was calculated using the formula x t −x min/Δx, wherex t is the percentage of coat protein bound to GroEL at a given time point and x min represents the minimum percentage of coat protein bound to GroEL after co-immunoprecipitation. Δx represents the total change in percent of coat protein bound to GroEL (x initial− x min). The results were plotted on a log scale against time, and t½ values were calculated by determining the time at which half-maximal incorporation occurred. Infected cells were labeled as described in the immunoprecipitation experiments. Aliquots were taken at 9, 12, and 15 min after chase and frozen as described above. The infected cells in each aliquot were lysed by freeze/thaw and treated as described by Gordon et al. (25Gordon C.L. Sather S.K. Casjens S. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27941-27951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except cell lysates were subjected to a 5-min spin instead of a 3-min spin in a Sorval FA-Micro rotor at 15,000 × g. Coat protein in the pellet and in the total lysate were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and the coat protein band quantified by phosphorimaging. The reported amount of aggregated coat protein is expressed as a percentage of the total amount of coat protein produced and represents the average of the three time points. It has been reported that GroEL/S increase the yield of a variety of proteins such as Rubisco, citrate synthase, and rhodanese when they are refolded in vitro (9Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmit F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 37Goloubinoff P. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H.

Chem. 1991; 266: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, the tsf mutants of the coat protein of bacteriophage P22 have displayed a similar increase in phage viability with the overproduction of GroEL/S (25Gordon C.L. Sather S.K. Casjens S. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27941-27951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Dyk T.K.V. Gatenby A.A. LaRossa R.A. Nature. 1989; 342: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Since we used a different growth medium for our experiments than Gordon et al. (25Gordon C.L. Sather S.K. Casjens S. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27941-27951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we determined the number of properly folded coat proteins produced per cell (i.e. phage burst) at a variety of temperatures in cells with normal and overproduced levels of the chaperonins in order to assess the role of GroEL/S in the enhancement of proper folding of these tsf mutant coat proteins in our conditions (Fig. 2). The ability of WT coat protein to fold and assemble remained constant over the range of temperatures in both strains of cells, indicating that there was no significant effect on the yield of correctly folded WT coat protein by the overproduction of GroEL/S. The tsf mutant S223F consistently produced larger bursts than WT phage at permissive temperatures. In cells expressing normal levels of GroEL/S, S223F and A108V exhibited a decrease in the yield of assembly-competent coat protein at their non-permissive temperatures (≥37 °C). However, when thetsf coat proteins were synthesized in cells overproducing GroEL/S at the restrictive temperatures, the level of assembly-competent coat proteins approached those seen at permissive temperatures. The amount of assembly-competent coat protein observed for the tsf mutants in cells overproducing GroEL/S increased 60–200-fold over the amount when folded in cells with normal levels of GroEL/S (Fig. 2), suggesting that the 9-fold increase of GroEL/S levels (25Gordon C.L. Sather S.K. Casjens S. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27941-27951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) overcame the folding defect in tsf mutant coat proteins, which is consistent with Gordon et al. (25Gordon C.L. Sather S.K. Casjens S. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27941-27951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize the effect of GroEL/S on the folding and assembly of coat protein, we examined WT and tsf mutant phage biogenesis in cells producing WT GroEL/S or cells that carry point mutations in GroEL or GroES that result in dysfunctional chaperonin action (Fig. 3) (28Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Baird L. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1134-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). WT phage grew efficiently in any GroEL or GroES mutant strain, even at high temperatures, and the tsf mutants showed the same temperature-sensitive phenotype in cells producing WT GroEL/S as observed in Salmonella. However, the tsf coat protein mutants G232D, P238S, and D302G, as well as other mutant phage not shown here, exhibited a dramatic decrease in the temperature where phage growth became non-permissive on each GroEL or GroES mutant strain as compared with that observed in cells producing WT GroEL/S. These data indicate that GroEL and GroES are critical for the folding of thetsf mutant coat proteins, at least at 33 °C and above, but are not an essential requirement for the folding and assembly of WT coat protein. To characterize the GroEL-coat protein ternary complex, we calculated the percent of the total coat protein initially bound to GroEL at each temperature from co-immunoprecipitation experiments. From these data we observed a small increase in the percent of WT coat protein bound to GroEL with increasing temperature. Overproduction of GroEL did not significantly change the amount of WT coat protein initially bound to GroEL (Fig. 4). These data suggest that the productive folding pathway of WT coat protein does not generally require GroEL/S, although WT coat protein does exhibit some affinity for GroEL, particularly at higher temperatures. The percenttsf mutant coat protein bound to GroEL, however, does show a dependence upon GroEL/S concentration. The percent of tsfmutant coat protein bound to GroEL at the higher temperatures in cells with high amounts of the chaperonins was 38% and 60% for A108V and S223F, respectively, and an increase of 20–40% over the binding at normal levels of GroEL/S. Intriguingly, the percent of S223F coat protein initially bound at 30 and 33 °C increased 10–20% with the overproduction of GroEL/S, yet the level of properly folded S223F coat proteins/cell (Fig. 2) seems not to be affected by GroEL/S overproduction at these temperatures. This suggests that there are sufficient levels of assembly-competent S223F coat protein to produce phage bursts in cells with normal levels of GroEL/S, but there is some S223F coat protein that is misfolding and binding to GroEL at these permissive temperatures. In order to understand the events that lead to the productive folding of coat protein in vivo, the rate of release of the coat protein from the GroEL-coat protein ternary complex was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 5shows the percent of coat protein that remained bound to GroEL after co-immunoprecipitation at various times after the addition of chase at 39 °C. The half-times calculated for the rate of release at high temperatures indicated that the tsf mutants had slower release rates than WT coat protein. For example, the release rates at 39 °C were approximately 15 s for WT coat protein and 20 and 25 s for A108V and S223F, respectively. Overall, the half-times of release decreased 6-fold for WT coat protein and 3-fold for thetsf mutants from 30 °C to 39 °C (Fig. 6). GroEL/S overproduction had no effect upon the half-times of release at any temperature, which suggests that GroEL/S overproduction rescues the phage production by increasing the probability of association between a misfolding tsf coat protein and GroEL, leading to a higher yield of assembly-competent coat proteins.Figure 6Release rates of coat proteins from the GroEL-coat protein complex in vivo. The half-times of release of coat protein from GroEL were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures” from the co-immunoprecipitation experiments at each temperature with (♦) and without (⋄) the overproduction of GroEL/S. The curves drawn here are not fit to any model but are shown to guide the eye.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The possible fates of coat protein after being released from GroEL are assembly of procapsids, formation of inclusion bodies, or rebinding to GroEL. It is possible that, once folded, the tsf coat protein could remain in the soluble state and not assemble. However, this possibility seems unlikely since we can account for all of the newly synthesized coat protein. Gordon et al. (25Gordon C.L. Sather S.K. Casjens S. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27941-27951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have previously shown that GroEL/S overproduction decreased the amount of tsf coat protein that has aggregated in vivo at non-permissive temperatures. That study quantified the aggregation of a singletsf coat protein mutant at only two temperatures. We have conducted similar experiments but utilized different tsfmutants and examined the aggregation of coat protein over a range of temperatures (Fig. 7). From these experiments, we observed a 20% increase in the amount of aggregated WT coat protein from 30 °C to 39 °C, suggesting that WT coat protein is somewhat defective in folding at high temperatures. However, the overproduction of GroEL/S seemed not to decrease the amount of aggregation of WT coat protein at any temperature. In contrast, thetsf coat proteins aggregated in a temperature-dependent manner; increasing the temperature from 30 °C to 39 °C resulted in 40% higher amount of aggregatedtsf coat proteins in cells with normal GroEL/S levels. The overproduction of GroEL/S caused a 20–30% decrease in the amount of aggregated tsf coat proteins at the higher temperature"
https://openalex.org/W2161631758,"This study addressed the role of guanylyl cyclase (GC) and phosphodiesterase (PDE) in interleukin (IL)-1 activation of human articular chondrocytes. The GC inhibitors LY83583 and methylene blue dose-dependently inhibited IL-1-induced nitric oxide (NO) production, inducible NO synthase (iNOS) protein, and mRNA expression. These effects of GC inhibition were consistent with the rapid induction of cGMP by IL-1, which reached maximal levels after 5 min. The effects of GC inhibitors were selective as they did not reduce IL-1-induced cyclooxygenase II protein and mRNA. An inhibitor specific for soluble GC did not affect IL-1-induced NO production, and activators of soluble GC did not induce NO. However, the expression of iNOS mRNA was induced by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), activators of particulate GC, indicating that particulate rather than soluble guanylyl cyclases were involved in iNOS induction. The expression of iNOS mRNA and the production of NO were induced by a slowly hydrolyzable analog of cGMP, 8-bromo-cGMP, but not by nonhydrolyzable analog, dibutyryl cGMP, suggesting that PDE rather than cGMP-dependent protein kinase mediates the cGMP effects. Chondrocytes contained extensive cGMP PDE activity. This had PDE5 biochemical features and an inhibitor profile consistent with PDE5. Furthermore, the nonisoformspecific PDE inhibitor IBMX and PDE5-specific inhibitors suppressed IL-1-induced NO release and iNOS mRNA expression. PDE5 mRNA was constitutively expressed in chondrocytes. In addition to increasing PDE5 activities, IL-1 treatment reduced the sensitivity of PDE5 to several pharmacological inhibitors by up to 50-fold. In summary, inhibitors of either GC or PDE5 prevented IL-1 induction of iNOS; IL-1 increased the rates of both cGMP generation and hydrolysis; and exogenous PDE hydrolyzable cGMP analog induced iNOS and NO. These results suggest that increased cGMP metabolic flux is sufficient to induce iNOS, and GC and PDE5 activities are required for IL-1 induction of iNOS expression via increases in coupled cGMP synthesis and hydrolysis.

Although there are tissue-specific differences in the IL-1-activated signaling pathways, even in the same cell type there are multiple IL-1-induced second messengers that differentially regulate subsets of IL-1-responsive genes.

Studies on intracellular signals that regulate iNOS expression have shown cell-type specific differences.

Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1994; 2: 199-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that activation of protein tyrosine kinases but not of protein kinase A nor protein kinase C is required for iNOS mRNA expression in chondrocytes (18Geng Y. Maier R. Lotz M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Also, increased levels of intracellular calcium were not associated with the induction of NO synthesis. However, when IL-1-activated chondrocytes were treated with drugs that increase intracellular calcium, NO synthesis was completely suppressed via a reduction in iNOS mRNA half-life (33Geng Y. Lotz M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1651-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In chondrocytes, IL-1 increases levels of cGMP, and this is at least in part NO-mediated (32Rediske J. Koehne C. Zhang B. Lotz M. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1994; 2: 199-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The role of increased cGMP levels in IL-1-induced gene expression and iNOS induction, as well as the downstream target(s) of cGMP, is unknown. The present study demonstrates that the activities of guanylyl cyclase and cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase are required for the induction of iNOS by IL-1. COX-2, also an IL-1-induced gene in chondrocytes, is not cGMP dependent. Pharmacological, biochemical and molecular characterization suggests that the chondrocyte cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) involved in iNOS induction is PDE5 and undergoes posttranslational modification in response to IL-1. Cartilage was obtained at autopsy from donors with no history of joint disease. Chondrocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion of cartilage from the femoral condyles and tibial plateaus of the knee joints and cultured as described previously (34Lotz M. Clark-Lewis I. Ganu V. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with primary or passage 1 cells. Chondrocytes were plated at 40,000 cells per well in 96-well plates for studies on NO production and at 106cells per well in 6-well plates for Western blotting and ribonuclease protection assay (RPA). Cells were cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. The concentration of nitrites, stable end products of cellular NO breakdown, in conditioned media from chondrocytes was determined by the Griess reaction using NaNO2 as standard (18Geng Y. Maier R. Lotz M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All results are expressed as nmol of nitrite per 100,000 cells. Western blotting for iNOS and COX-2 was performed as described previously (33Geng Y. Lotz M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1651-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, chondrocyte cultures in 6-well plates were stimulated for 24 h. Cell lysates were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and the blots were stained with primary antibody to iNOS or COX-2 followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG. The blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate solution and exposed to x-ray film. RPA for iNOS and COX-2 was performed as described previously (33Geng Y. Lotz M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1651-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, fragments of a 236-base pair fragment of iNOS cDNA and a 292-base pair fragment of COX-2 cDNA were subcloned into pGEM3z or pGEM4z. The plasmids were linearized, and iNOS and COX-2 antisense riboprobes were prepared byin vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase with the incorporation of [α-32P]UTP. The RNA samples were hybridized in solution containing [α-32P]UTP-labeled antisense riboprobes. Unhybridized RNA was digested with ribonuclease T1 and RNase A. The protected RNA fragments were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels and exposed to Kodak film. Extraction of cGMP was performed as described by Cicirelli and Smith (35Cicirelli M.F. Smith L.D. Dev. Biol. 1985; 108: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cells were extracted twice with ethanol. The supernatants were pooled, vacuum dried and resuspended in assay buffer. The levels of cGMP were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Chondrocytes were harvested by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline, and cell pellets were frozen at −70 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of TMPI buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.13 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.09 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 18.5 μg/ml 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone (TLCK), and 1.58 mg/ml benzamidine) and homogenized in a Duall-type homogenizer with a Teflon pestle driven at 1,300 rpm. The cell homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatants were collected and immediately applied to a 5-ml Trisacryl M anion-exchange resin packed in a 20 × 1.6 cm column at a 1 ml/min loading rate. The column was washed with 20 ml of TMPI buffer at 1 ml/min and eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient of 0–1.2 m NaOAC in TMPI buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The pellet from the ultracentrifugation was resuspended in the original volume of TMPI buffer, using a smooth Teflon pestle. PDE activities were determined using a modified two-step procedure as described (36Thompson W.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 13-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). All incubation mixtures (0.4 ml) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 3.75 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 30 μg/ml lipid-free bovine serum albumin, and 100,000–200,000 cpm of [3H]cAMP or [3H]cGMP with the indicated unlabeled substrate per assay. DEAE peaks 1 and 2 activities were characterized using 0.001–100 μm inhibitor concentrations. The inhibitor concentrations that produced 50% inhibition (IC50) of PDE activity were determined with nonlinear regression sigmoidal dose-response models with GraphPad Prism program (Intuitive Software for Science, San Diego, CA) and Curvefit (37Rodbard, D., and Hutt, D. M. (1974) Proceedings, Symposium on Radioimmunoassays and Related Procedures in Medicine, International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, AustriaGoogle Scholar). RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and PCR amplification of chondrocyte cDNA was performed as described previously (18Geng Y. Maier R. Lotz M. J. Cell.

The PDE primer sequence of the sense strand was GTGAAAGATATTTCTAGTCACTTG, corresponding to nucleotides 534–557, and that of the antisense strand was ATACATGTAATTGATTCTGTTTGC, corresponding to nucleotides 1301–1278 from bovine cGMP binding, cGMP-specific PDE (38McAllister-Lucas L.M.

IBMX, methylene blue, dibutyryl cGMP (Bt2cGMP), 8-Br-cGMP, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) were purchased from Sigma; SNAP, GSNO, and ODQ were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). [2,8-3H]cAMP (specific activity 36 Ci/mmol) and [8-3H]cyclic GMP (specific activity 19 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA) and purified as described previously (36Thompson W.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 13-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The sources of the PDE inhibitors were: trequinsin (HL-725), Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Paris, France); rolipram, Schering AG (Berlin, Germany); indolidan, Eli Lilly Co. (Indianapolis, IN); zaprinast, May and Baker, Ltd.; CGS-9343B, Ciba-Geigy Corporation (Summit, NJ); LY83583, dipyridamole, MY5445 and MXZ from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). All inhibitors were dissolved in 100% Me2SO. The vehicle at the concentration used did not influence chondrocyte viability and PDE activity. LY83583, an inhibitor of guanylyl cyclases (GC) was used to study the role of cGMP in IL-1-induced NO release and iNOS mRNA expression in cultures of primary human articular chondrocytes. LY83583 dose-dependently inhibited IL-1-induced NO release (Fig. 1 A). Complete inhibition of NO release by LY83583 was observed at nanomolar concentrations. An IC50 of 250 nm was determined. The next set of experiments addressed whether the reduction in IL-1-induced NO release by LY83583 was because of a reduction in iNOS protein. Analysis by Western blot showed that LY83583 or methylene blue (MB), another GC inhibitor, reduced IL-1-induced iNOS protein almost to background levels (Fig. 1 B). COX-2, also an IL-1-induced protein (9Geng Y. Blanco F. Corenelisson M. Lotz M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 796-801PubMed Google Scholar), was only marginally reduced by MB or LY83583 (Fig. 1 B). To quantify iNOS mRNA levels, RPAs were performed with analysis of iNOS, COX-2, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA in the same samples. This showed that LY83583 or MB blocked iNOS mRNA expression but did not significantly change IL-1-induced COX-2 mRNA levels or the constitutively expressed GAPDH (Fig. 1 C). Kinetic study showed that iNOS mRNA was suppressed at all tested time points, 6, 24, and 48 h (not shown). IL-1-induced expression of c-fos mRNA was not inhibited by either LY83583 or MB. These reagents even enhanced the IL-1 effect, and in the absence of IL-1, they induced c-fos mRNA expression (not shown). These results suggested a role of GC in the expression of a subset of genes in human articular chondrocytes. To characterize whether soluble or particulate GC (39Drewett J.G. Garbers D.L. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 135-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 40Garbers D.L. Lowe D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30741-30744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is involved in the iNOS induction, the effect of a soluble GC-specific inhibitor (41Garthwaite J. Southam E. Boulton C.L.

ODQ did not show significant inhibitory effects at any of the doses used on IL-1-induced NO release in chondrocytes although LY83583 completely blocked NO release in the same experiment (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest that soluble GC appear not to be required for iNOS induction. Specific activators of soluble or particulate GC were studied in the next set of experiments. Among the seven membrane GC (GC-A to -G) (43Wedel B.J. Garbers D.L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 23: 29-33Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 44Schulz S. Wedel B.J. Matthews A. Garbers D.L. J. Biol.

They are ANP and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) for GC-A; CNP for GC-B; and heat-stable enterotoxin (STa), guanylin, and uroguan for GC-C (43Wedel B.J. Garbers D.L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 23: 29-33Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). GC-A and GC-B are expressed in rat chondrocytes, and ANP and CNP induced cGMP synthesis in these cells (45Hagiwara H. Sakaguchi H. Itakura M. Yoshimoto T. Furuya M. Tanaka S. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10729-10733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both, ANP and CNP peptides induced iNOS mRNA expression as detected by RPA although they were much less potent than IL-1 (Fig. 2 B). Among three forms of soluble GC heterodimers, two, α1/β1 and α2/β1, are activated by NO (43Wedel B.J. Garbers D.L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 23: 29-33Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar); the activator for the third form is unknown. However, two NO generators, SNAP and GSNO, which generate NO in solution, failed to induce iNOS expression (Fig. 2 B). Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), another NO donor, was also not able to induce iNOS (not shown). These results are consistent with our earlier observations using a soluble GC-specific inhibitor and suggest that particulate rather than soluble GC is involved in iNOS induction. Cellular responses are regulated by cGMP through several different downstream mechanisms, including calcium influx by activation of calcium channels, protein phosphorylation by cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) and hydrolysis of cGMP and/or cAMP by activation or inhibition of PDE (46Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The next set of experiments was designed to examine the downstream targets of cGMP. The possible role of cGK and Ca2+ channels in NO release and iNOS mRNA expression was studied by using the cGMP analog Bt2cGMP, which can mimic native cGMP to activate cGK and Ca2+ channels but is not hydrolyzed by PDE. This analog did not induce NO release (Fig. 2 b) nor iNOS mRNA expression (not shown). Additionally, this analog did not reverse the effects of the GC inhibitor LY83583. Two cGK inhibitors, KT5823 and Rp-8-pCPT-cGMP, did not reduce IL-1-induced NO release, iNOS protein, and mRNA expression (not shown). The calcium channel blockers nifedipine and diltiazem also had no effect on IL-1-induced NO release. Chondrocyte lysates were tested directly for cGK activity using the relatively selective substrate BPDEtide. The activity of cGK was not detectable in nonstimulated or IL-1-stimulated chondrocytes. These results suggest that cGK or Ca2+ channels do not function as downstream targets of cGMP in the IL-1 induction of iNOS. Because cGK or Ca2+ channels appeared not to be involved in the iNOS induction, the effect of another cGMP target protein, PDE, was examined by using a slowly hydrolyzable analog of cGMP (47Galione A. White A. Willmott N. Turner M. Potter B.V. Watson S.P. Nature. 1993; 365: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 48MacFarland R.T. Zelus B.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 8-bromo-cGMP (8-Br-cGMP). 8-Br-cGMP dose-dependently induced NO release (Fig. 3 A) although at much lower levels as compared with IL-1 (Fig. 3 C). The time course of NO induction by 8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 3 B) was similar to that of IL-1 (18Geng Y. Maier R. Lotz M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). 8-Br-cGMP had additive effects with IL-1 in the induction of NO (Fig. 3 C). In the same experiments, NO production was induced by 8-Br-cGMP but not by Bt2cGMP nor 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 3 D) at any of the doses tested. To further characterize the role of 8-Br-cGMP in NO induction, iNOS protein and mRNA were determined. 8-Br-cGMP did induce iNOS mRNA expression (Fig. 2 B) and protein synthesis (not shown). These results further argue against a role of cGK and Ca2+ channels and suggest a role of cGMP PDE in IL-1-induced NO production. To further determine whether PDE is required for iNOS induction via mediating cGMP hydrolysis, the xanthine analog IBMX, a commonly used inhibitor of all PDE isoforms, was examined. IBMX alone did not induce NO release although it can increase intracellular cGMP concentrations by blocking cGMP hydrolysis. In contrast, it caused a dose-dependent reduction in NO release (Fig. 4 A), iNOS mRNA expression (Fig. 4 B), as well as iNOS protein levels (not shown) in IL-1-stimulated chondrocytes. IBMX did not reduce IL-1-induced COX-2 mRNA levels even at 1 mm dose, indicating that the inhibition of NO release and iNOS expression was not the consequence of nonspecific effects on the cells. These results suggested that PDE is involved in the cGMP-mediated iNOS induction. Increases in cGMP concentrations followed by hydrolysis by PDE rather than changes in steady state cGMP levels are sufficient to induce iNOS expression and are required for IL-1 induction of iNOS in chondrocytes.Figure 4PDE inhibition suppresses NO release and iNOS mRNA expression. Chondrocytes were preincubated with PDE inhibitor IBMX for 1 h at the doses indicated and then stimulated with IL-1β (1 ng/ml). Nitrite levels were determined in 48-h conditioned media. Results represent mean values of triplicate determinations ± S.E. (A). Cells were harvested after 6 h for RNA isolation. Levels of iNOS, COX-2, and GAPDH mRNA were analyzed by RPA (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Chondrocyte PDE was further characterized. Whole cell lysates, and pellets and supernatants obtained after ultracentrifugation of the whole cell lysates were tested for the major isoforms of PDE activity. Whole cell lysates contained large amounts of cGMP PDE that were approximately 100-fold higher than those of cAMP PDE (Table I). Most of the cGMP PDE activity was in the supernatant after ultracentrifugation (30,388 pmol/min/mg in supernatantversus 7,060 pmol/min/mg in pellet), indicating that this PDE was in the cytosolic fraction (Table I). To determine whether GC and PDE are activated by IL-1 and whether these events are prior to iNOS mRNA induction, cGMP levels and cGMP PDE activity were analyzed. IL-1 induced a rapid and large increase in cGMP levels in chondrocytes. Total cellular cGMP was maximal within 5 min of IL-1 treatment and decreased to base line after 2 h (Fig. 5). The increased cGMP levels declined after 5 min of IL-1 stimulation followed by an increase in cGMP PDE activity (Fig. 5). Cyclic GMP PDE activity in the supernatant from the ultracentrifugation of the cell lysates was determined. IL-1 caused a time-dependent increase in cGMP PDE activity that was already evident after 5 min and approximately 10-fold higher than background after 60 min (Fig. 5). These results showed that chondrocytes contain large amounts of cGMP-specific PDE activity and that IL-1 increased both cGMP synthesis and hydrolysis by activation of guanylyl cyclase and cGMP PDE, respectively, and these events preceded iNOS induction.Table ICyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity in human articular chondrocytesCell fractionSpecific activitycGMP-PDEcAMP-PDEpmol/min/mgWhole cell lysate19167170Supernatant30388254Pellet706062Whole cell lysates and the supernatants and pellets obtained after ultracentrifugation of the whole cell lysates were tested for the major isoforms of PDE.

It has been found that a late promoter DNA binding activity cochromatographs and cosediments with VLTF-X activity. Current experiments show that VLTF-X activity is present in a variety of uninfected mammalian cell types and is indistinguishable from that recovered from infected cells based upon several criteria. VLTF-X activity from both sources displays the same purification profile over phosphocellulose and DNA affinity resins and has the same sedimentation coefficient. In addition, the factors purified from both infected and uninfected cells form protein-DNA complexes of identical electrophoretic mobility in the presence of vaccinia virus late promoter-containing DNA. The affinity of these factors for the late promoter probes is identical and late promoter-specific based on competition experiments. Moreover, VLTF-X purified from both sources bound to late promoter-containing DNA in the presence or absence of MgCl2 and ATP and formed complexes resistant to heat inactivation. These experiments offer proof that vaccinia virus factor VLTF-X is a host cell protein that supports transcription of the viral late genes.

Poxviruses are large DNA viruses that replicate within the cytoplasm of host cells and encode most of the specific enzymes and factors required for their transcription and replication. Our knowledge of transcription regulation in poxviruses has come largely from studies of vaccinia virus, the prototypical member of this family. The vaccinia virus genome contains approximately 200 genes whose expression is tightly regulated at the level of transcription initiation. The life cycle of vaccinia virus is complex, with three temporally regulated classes of gene products. These genes can be divided into early, intermediate, and late classes based on their time of synthesis relative to viral DNA replication. The different gene classes are distinguished by their requirement for different trans-acting factors and by unique promoter sequences (1Moss B. Ahn B-Y. Amegadzie B. Gershon P.D. Keck J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1355-1358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the components required for transcription of the early genes are packaged within the virion core, which is activated upon entry into the host cytoplasm. Fractionation of virion extracts has shown that two components are needed for early gene transcription initiation: the viral RNA polymerase and a protein designated VETF (forvaccinia early transcriptionfactor) (2Broyles S.S. Yuen L. Shuman S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10754-10760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription of the intermediate class of viral genes requires the viral RNA polymerase, capping enzyme (3Vos J.C. Sasker M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2552-2558Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the viral E4L gene product (4Rosales R. Harris N. Ahn B-Y. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14260-14267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a factor apparently provided by the host cell (5Rosales R. Sutter G. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1994; 9: 3794-3798Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Most of the factors necessary for late transcription are only present in the cell after the onset of viral DNA replication. Thus far, at least five factors, in addition to the viral RNA polymerase, have been identified as being necessary for maximal late transcription activityin vitro. These are the virally encoded products of the A1L, A2L, G8R, and H5R open reading frames (6Hubbs A.E. Wright C.F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 327-331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Keck J.G Kovacs G.R Moss B. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5740-5748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kovacs G.R. Moss B. J.

Wright C.F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 327-331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wright C.F. Coroneos A.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7264-7270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the products of the viral G2R and A18L genes may play a role in transcript elongation or stability (12Black E.P Condit R.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 47-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,13Condit R.C. Xiang Y. Lewis J.I. Virology. 1996; 220: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recent data have demonstrated that VLTF-X activity is found in uninfected HeLa cell cytoplasmic extracts and virion extracts, thus defining it as a unique late transcription factor (14Wright C.F. Hubbs A.E. Gunasinghe S.K. Oswald B.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1446-1451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of this factor in uninfected cells was surprising in that it potentially defined another host factor, besides that required for intermediate transcription, that participates in the viral transcriptional machinery. We have also shown that this factor copurifies from infected cells with a late promoter-specific DNA binding activity, which suggested that its biochemical role is in the recognition of vaccinia virus late promoters. In the present study, we demonstrate that VLTF-X affinity-purified from uninfected and infected cells shares the same size and biochemical and molecular properties. Based on these data, we conclude that VLTF-X purified from both preparations is most likely the same factor. The A1L, A2L, and G8R proteins were expressed in a recombinant baculovirus system and purified as described previously (11Wright C.F. Coroneos A.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7264-7270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The A2L protein was also expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and purified from Escherichia coli using glutathione-Sepharose. The vaccinia virus RNA polymerase was purified from infected HeLa cells to the glycerol gradient-pure stage as described previously (11Wright C.F. Coroneos A.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7264-7270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Uninfected HeLa cell extracts were prepared from the nucleus or cytoplasm as described by Abmayr and Workman (15Abmayr S.M Workman J.L. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.A. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 12.1.1-12.1.9Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts from a variety of cell lines (Fig. 1) were prepared as described previously (16Wright C.F. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8883-8887Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with the omission of the ammonium sulfate precipitation step. VLTF-X was purified from 30 liters of uninfected and vaccinia virus-infected HeLa cells as described previously (14Wright C.F. Hubbs A.E. Gunasinghe S.K. Oswald B.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1446-1451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) over sequential columns of phosphocellulose, heparin-agarose, DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, and phosphocellulose a second time. A double-stranded late promoter-containing oligonucleotide affinity resin was prepared according to the protocol of Kerrigan and Kadonaga (17Kerrigan L.A Kadonaga J.T. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.A. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 12.10.1-12.10.18Google Scholar). Briefly, the oligonucleotides 5′-GGATCCTTTCATTTTGTTTTTTTCTATGCTATAAATAGACTCG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCCGAGTCTATTTATAGCATAGAAAAAAACAAAATGAAA-3′ were annealed, ligated into multimeric chains (∼7-mers) with T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and coupled directly to CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-B4 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The affinity resin was equilibrated with buffer A (0.05 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from uninfected and infected HeLa cells, passed individually over phosphocellulose columns, and eluted in step fractions of 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 m NaCl as described previously, except on a smaller scale (11Wright C.F. Coroneos A.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7264-7270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 0.3 m fractions (3 mg of protein) were dialyzed against buffer A and passed over a 1-ml column containing double-stranded calf thymus DNA-cellulose resin (Sigma) equilibrated in buffer A to deplete the extracts of nonspecific DNA-binding proteins. The flow-through fractions were collected and applied over a 1-ml column of the equilibrated affinity resin. The column was washed with 5 ml of buffer A, and proteins bound to the resin were collected by increasing NaCl concentrations (buffer A with 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0m NaCl). The presence of VLTF-X in the bound and flow-through fractions was monitored with mobility shift assays and transcription assays. All protein fractions from the 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0m eluates were dialyzed for 2 h against buffer A containing 0.01 m salt prior to use in the above mentioned assays. The 0.2 m salt fractions, which contained VLTF-X activity, were pooled, reapplied over the affinity resin, and eluted as above to further purify the factor. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays contained varying amounts of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 2–10 μl of protein samples. Mobility shift assays were conducted as described previously (14Wright C.F. Hubbs A.E. Gunasinghe S.K. Oswald B.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1446-1451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled DNA targets for the mobility shift experiments were prepared by using the plasmid pCFW7, which contains the wild-type promoter and flanking sequences of the vaccinia virus late gene expressing the 11-kDa protein product (F17R) cloned into pUC18 (16Wright C.F. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8883-8887Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Three additional radiolabeled DNA target oligonucleotides, 101/102 (5′-CTATGCTATAAATGAATTCTCATTTTG-3′, 5′-CAAAATGAGAATTCATTTATAGCATAG-3′), 60/61WT(5′-AAGCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGGCATATAAATAGACTCG-3′, 5′-CGAGTCTATTTATATGCCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGCTT-3′), and 60/61 M (5′-AAGCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGGCATATGAATAGACTCG-3′, 5′-CGAGTCTATTCATATGCCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGCTT-3′) were prepared for mobility shift experiments. To form the double-stranded DNA, 40-μl reaction mixtures containing a 25 μm concentration of each oligonucleotide, 250 mm NaCl, and 10 mmTris-HCL (pH 8) were placed in a 1.5-ml tube in a beaker of boiling water, and the water was allowed to come to room temperature over several hours. To prepare the DNA probes, approximately 200 ng of DNA was used in a kinase reaction consisting of T4 kinase (20 units), 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and buffer as recommended by the manufacturer. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, phenol-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated, and the DNA was subsequently gel-purified. The early and late promoter-containing oligonucleotide competitors were prepared under previously described conditions (14Wright C.F. Hubbs A.E. Gunasinghe S.K. Oswald B.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1446-1451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific in vitro transcription reactions were conducted under previously described conditions (14Wright C.F. Hubbs A.E. Gunasinghe S.K. Oswald B.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1446-1451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, protein fractions were incubated with a plasmid containing the late promoter fragment of the gene expressing the 11-kDa protein product fused to 400 bp of DNA lacking G residues in the noncoding strand (18Sawadogo M. Roeder R. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Reactions were conducted for 30 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 50 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CTP, 0.02 mm UTP, 5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 9% polyvinyl alcohol, 5% glycerol, and approximately 1 μg of DNA template. Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217317) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proteins were electrophoresed on discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gels and silver-stained. A radiolabeled DNA fragment for UV cross-linking was prepared by using the plasmid pCFW7. Approximately 1 ng of plasmid DNA was used as the template in polymerase chain reaction in reactions containing polymerase chain reaction buffer II (Perkin-Elmer) (2.25 mmMgCl2; 0.1 mm dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP; 50 μCi [α-32P]dATP; 25 ng of M13/pUC forward and reverse primers (Life Technologies); and 5 units of Ampli Taqpolymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The reaction mixtures were heated to 94 °C for 5 min and then cycled for 10 cycles at 94 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 10 s, followed by 72 °C for 5 min; then 0.02 mm dATP was added to the reaction, and 30 additional cycles were conducted at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by 72 °C for 5 min. This created a 273-bp1 labeled fragment, which was subsequently gel-purified. Crude protein samples (3 μg of protein) from phosphocellulose 0.3 m NaCl salt fractions of uninfected and infected cytoplasmic extracts were incubated with approximately 1 ng of 32P-labeled target DNA and 50 ng of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) in a final volume of 20 μl under conditions described previously for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (14Wright C.F. Hubbs A.E. Gunasinghe S.K. Oswald B.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1446-1451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5-μl aliquots of the reaction mixtures were run on a mobility shift gel under the usual conditions. 10-μl aliquots of the reaction mixtures were placed on Parafilm (American National Can, Greenwich, CT) and irradiated at a wavelength of 253 nm for 6 min in a Hoefer UV cross-linker (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following UV irradiation, the mixture was digested for 5 min at room temperature with 2 units of DNase I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of 4 mm MgCl2. The molecular weights of the cross-linked proteins were determined by electrophoretic analysis of the mixture on an SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel as described above. The electrophoresed proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (MSI, Westborough, MA), which was subsequently autoradiographed. Affinity-purified VLTF-X (0.2 ml) from uninfected HeLa cells was sedimented through a 13-ml 15–35% glycerol gradient in buffer consisting of 0.2 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 2 mmdithiothreitol. The gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor at 41,000 rpm for 48 h. Fractions of 0.4 ml were collected from the top of the tube and tested for VLTF-X activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. For calibration, parallel glycerol gradients loaded with cytochrome c, bovine serum albumin, and catalase were centrifuged under identical conditions. Having found that a VLTF-X complementing activity was present in uninfected HeLa cell extracts (14Wright C.F. Hubbs A.E. Gunasinghe S.K. Oswald B.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1446-1451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine if there was a similar activity present in other cell lines. Therefore, whole cell extracts from various cell lines were tested in transcription assays for their ability to complement for VLTF-X activity. Additionally, cell fractionation studies were conducted to determine if this factor was localized to the nucleus or cytoplasm of uninfected HeLa cells. Fig. 1 shows thein vitro transcription reactions reconstituted with extracts prepared from different sources. The reactions in all of the lanes contain the viral A1L, A2L, and G8R proteins and the viral RNA polymerase purified from infected cells. The reaction in lane 2 contained no additional proteins, demonstrating that these factors alone are not sufficient to reconstitute transcription. The reaction in lane 1 is a positive control in which transcription was reconstituted by the addition of cytoplasmic extract from uninfected HeLa cells, previously shown to contain VLTF-X activity (14Wright C.F. Hubbs A.E. Gunasinghe S.K. Oswald B.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1446-1451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription product made when this extract was used as the source of VLTF-X was apparently identical to that produced when authentic VLTF-X, purified from infected cells, was used (14Wright C.F. Hubbs A.E. Gunasinghe S.K. Oswald B.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1446-1451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional reactions contained cytoplasmic (lane 3) or nuclear extract (lane 4) prepared simultaneously from uninfected HeLa cells, demonstrating once again the presence of a complementing factor in uninfected cells that is apparently distributed to both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Lanes 5–9 are reactions reconstituted with whole cell extracts made from various cell lines available in the laboratory. A factor complementing for VLTF-X is present in extracts from STM91–01 and TTC 1240 cells (lanes 6 and 7, both human malignant rhabdoid tumor cell lines), GM13258 cells (lane 8, a derivative of mouse A9 cells), and OVCAR3 cells (lane 9, a human ovarian cancer cell line). In contrast, reactions reconstituted with extracts derived from the Trichoplusia ni (Hi-5) insect cell line only produced a smear of nonspecific products (lane 5). Thus, it appears as though a variety of mammalian cell lines contain this factor, as would be expected if this cellular protein is normally participating in vaccinia virus late transcription, since many different cell types are permissive for vaccinia virus infection. Our most recent studies have established that a factor that can provide VLTF-X activity is present in uninfected HeLa cells. As a first step toward distinguishing this factor from, or identifying it as, the complementing factor present in infected cells, we purified VLTF-X activity from both sources in order to compare their chromatographic profiles. In these experiments, cytoplasmic extracts from either infected or uninfected HeLa cells were partially purified by passage over a phosphocellulose column (11Wright C.F. Coroneos A.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7264-7270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions containing VLTF-X activity were then passed over a double-stranded calf thymus DNA cellulose column to deplete the extracts of nonspecific DNA-binding proteins. Fractions containing VLTF-X activity were then applied to a vaccinia virus late promoter-coupled affinity resin. VLTF-X-containing fractions from this first affinity column were reapplied to the oligonucleotide affinity resin to obtain more concentrated factor with fewer impurities. In all cases, VLTF-X activity was measured both by mobility shift and transcription complementation reactions. Figs. 2, A and B, shows assays of fractions from the second oligonucleotide affinity column for both uninfected and infected cell extracts. In both cases, the mobility shift and corresponding transcription complementation activity bound to the affinity column and eluted with 0.2 m NaCl. In no case could transcription activity be uncoupled from band shift activity. Thus, the factor present in infected and uninfected cell extracts has the same purification profile over phosphocellulose, double-stranded DNA cellulose, and oligonucleotide affinity columns. The most pure fractions from the oligonucleotide affinity columns were concentrated 10-fold, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and silver-stained (Fig. 2 C). This analysis revealed several faint bands of which common, approximately 35, 40, and 55-kDa bands were visible. The specificity of late promoter binding by affinity-pure VLTF-X from both cell sources was tested by performing assays in which early or late vaccinia virus promoter-containing DNA fragments were allowed to compete with the labeled late promoter probe (Fig. 3,A and B). As previously observed with VLTF-X purified by conventional chromatography from infected cells (14Wright C.F. Hubbs A.E. Gunasinghe S.K. Oswald B.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1446-1451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the early promoter-containing competitor did not affect the shifted complexes when present at 10 ng (a 58-fold molar excess over the target probe). The complexes were only partially inhibited at 20 ng of early oligonucleotide (a 116-fold molar excess). In contrast, the late promoter-containing DNA oligonucleotide almost completely inhibited complex formation at 10 ng, a 66-fold molar excess over the target probe. In a further effort to distinguish the purified infected and uninfected cell proteins from one another, the DNA-protein complexes from each preparation were subjected to a variety of biochemical tests. The influences of ATP, MgCl2, and heat on the stability of complex formation were investigated. Fig. 4, A and B, show the effects of different MgCl2 and ATP concentrations on the binding of VLTF-X to promoter-containing DNA. VLTF-X bound to DNA in the presence of up to 20 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm ATP. Heat treatment of affinity-purified VLTF-X-DNA complexes from both cell sources at 30, 37, 47, 65, and 100 °C for 10 min showed that the complexes were stable even at temperatures of 100 °C for 10 min (Fig. 4 C). The experiments performed above indicated that a protein with identical late promoter DNA binding specificity and biochemical properties is present in uninfected and infected cells. To confirm that the same protein(s) from infected and uninfected cells is binding to viral late promoters, a UV cross-linking experiment was performed. A uniformly 32P-labeled late promoter-containing DNA fragment was incubated with crude infected or uninfected 0.3 mphosphocellulose extracts under band shift conditions. Transcription reactions performed with these extracts confirmed that the infected cell preparation contained VLTF-X and viral RNA polymerase activity and that the uninfected cell preparation contained only VLTF-X activity (data not shown). The complexes were irradiated with UV light, digested with DNase I, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fig. 5 A demonstrates that an approximately 35-kDa protein was the most prominent protein cross-linked in both extracts with a less prominent species of approximately 55-kDa also visible (lanes 1 and 6). The specificity of this cross-linking was verified by performing a competition experiment using vaccinia virus early or late promoter-containing oligonucleotides as competitors as described previously (14Wright C.F. Hubbs A.E. Gunasinghe S.K. Oswald B.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1446-1451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of up to an approximately 6000-fold molar excess of early promoter-containing oligonucleotide had no effect on either cross-linked species (lanes 2, 3, 7, and 8). In contrast, the late promoter-containing DNA inhibited complex formation of both cross-linked proteins (lanes 4, 5, 9, and 10). To correlate the cross-linking results with our previous observations, 5-μl aliquots of the above reaction mixtures were also analyzed on a mobility shift gel (Fig. 5 B). The DNA binding activities of both types of extracts correlated with the above observations showing the protein-DNA complexes being relatively unaffected by an approximately 6000-fold molar excess of early oligonucleotide but almost completely eliminated by a 3000-fold molar excess of late oligonucleotide. Previous glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis of VLTF-X purified from infected cells showed that the sedimentation coefficient of this factor was consistent with a protein with a mass of approximately 32–38 kDa (11Wright C.F. Coroneos A.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7264-7270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To estimate the mass of VLTF-X affinity-purified from uninfected cells, the affinity-purified protein was sedimented through a 15–35% glycerol gradient. Gradient fractions were assayed for VLTF-X activity by mobility shift assays (Fig. 6). The sedimentation coefficient was calculated to be 3.0 S by comparison of the sedimentation position of marker proteins on parallel gradients as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using the Martin and Ames equation (20Martin G.M. Ames B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the approximate molecular mass of VLTF-X from uninfected cells was calculated to be between 35 and 40 kDa. Thus, the molecular mass determination of affinity-purified VLTF-X from uninfected cells is consistent with that of the infected cell VLTF-X (11Wright C.F. Coroneos A.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7264-7270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further understand the biochemical role of VLTF-X in late promoter recognition, studies were conducted to determine the DNA residues that are critical for protein binding. Fig. 7 A shows the sequence of a portion of the late promoter fragment (273 bp) currently being used as a probe as well as three additional late promoter-containing DNA fragments designated 60/61, 60/61 M, and 101/102. The 60/61 oligonucleotide is similar to the portion of the probe between residues −31 and +11 and has been shown in vivo to function as a strong late promoter (21Davison A.J. Moss B. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 21: 749-769Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The 60/61 M oligonucleotide is essentially the same as oligonucleotide 60/61 except for a single mutation in the TAAAT sequence to TGAAT. Previous studies have shown that the TAAAT sequence motif common to all vaccinia virus late promoters is highly conserved and essential for transcription of late genes in vivo (21Davison A.J. Moss B. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 21: 749-769Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 22Bertholet C. Stocco P. VanMeir E. Wittek R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1951-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Also, a promoter containing a TGAAT mutation was previously tested in the in vitro transcription system and shown to be nonfunctional (16Wright C.F. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8883-8887Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In vivo studies have also shown that an A/T-rich tract within approximately 30 bp upstream of the TAAAT sequence is also necessary for late promoter function (21Davison A.J. Moss B. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 21: 749-769Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 22Bertholet C. Stocco P. VanMeir E. Wittek R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1951-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Weir J.P. Moss B. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 75-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 101/102 oligonucleotide contains the late promoter region from −9 to +18; the main difference between this and the 60/61 oligonucleotide is that the latter contains the upstream tract of T residues. In preliminary studies (Fig. 7 B), mobility shift assays conducted with phosphocellulose II-pure VLTF-X (from infected cells) found that the protein will bind to the 60/61 oligonucleotide with an affinity that is comparable with the binding of the full-length probe, establishing that a much smaller DNA fragment suffices for protein binding. However, the factor will not bind to the 101/102 oligonucleotide, which lacks the upstream T tract. To determine whether the TGAAT mutation affects the binding of VLTF-X to the DNA fragment, affinity-purified VLTF-X from uninfected cells was allowed to complex with 60/61 and 60/61 M oligonucleotides (Fig. 7 C). VLTF-X bound to the wild-type and mutant probes with equal affinity and had an activity that was resistant to over 1000 ng of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). Further competition experiments were conducted with the single-stranded oligonucleotides (60 or 61), used to form the 60/61 duplex to determine if affinity-purified VLTF-X binds to single-stranded DNA. In Fig. 7 D, affinity-purified VLTF-X from uninfected cells was incubated with full-length target DNA and competitor single-stranded 60- or 61-oligonucleotides. Protein-DNA complexes were unaffected by a calculated 132-fold molar excess of either of the single strands of DNA. We have previously described a factor present in crude, uninfected cell cytoplasmic extracts that could complement for the vaccinia virus late transcription factor designated VLTF-X. It was also found that a late promoter DNA binding activity cochromatographed and cosedimented with VLTF-X activity. These findings suggested that a cellular factor is needed to support vaccinia virus late transcription. In the present report, we have purified VLTF-X from uninfected and infected HeLa cell extracts in order to determine whether the factor present in both sources is indeed the same. The late transcription complementing factor from both infected and uninfected cells bound to a late promoter-containing DNA oligonucleotide affinity resin and eluted at the same salt concentration. These affinity-pure VLTF-X fractions were subjected to a variety of biochemical tests in an effort to determine if the proteins from these extracts were the same. Competition experiments demonstrated that an oligonucleotide containing a vaccinia virus late promoter sequence was much more effective in blocking the observed DNA-protein interaction of both factors than an oligonucleotide containing an early promoter. Steady-state levels of the complexes with both factors were unaffected by the presence of ATP or MgCl2, similar to the results seen with VETF (24Broyles S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15545-15548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hagler J. Shuman S.S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2982-2989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also found that VLTF-X-DNA complexes from both cell sources were remarkably thermostable; DNA binding was only marginally inhibited when the complexes were subjected to boiling for 10 min. Finally, we have now confirmed that VLTF-X purified from uninfected cells has a similar mass as that purified from infected cells as estimated by glycerol gradient sedimentation. To examine whether the same proteins from the uninfected and infected extracts were binding to the late promoter, a UV cross-linking experiment was performed. The preponderance of thymidine residues in the vaccinia virus late promoter region and the reactive nature of these residues in the presence of UV light (26Chodosh LA. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.A. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 12.5.1-12.5.8Google Scholar) suggested that special reagents would not be necessary for adequate transfer of label from the DNA to the protein. Using this technique, approximately 35- and 55-kDa radiolabeled bands were detected in both uninfected and infected cell extracts. Both species bound specifically to the late promoter DNA fragment, since the presence of the labeled bands were competed with added unlabeled late promoter-containing oligonucleotide but not by comparable amounts of early promoter-containing oligonucleotide. Thus, while it is not possible at this time to tell which of these bands may be VLTF-X or what their relationship to each other may be, the results of this experi-ment are consistent with the premise that the factors from infected and uninfected cells are indistinguishable. The indistinguishable DNA binding specificity, biochemical characteristics, and size of the proteins in infected and uninfected cells have led us to conclude that VLTF-X is a unique late transcription factor most likely encoded by a cellular gene. In this regard, we have found VLTF-X activity in a variety of mammalian cell lines but not in a cell line derived from insect cells. This result is as would be expected if a cellular protein is normally participating in viral late transcription, since vaccinia virus can replicate in a wide variety of cells. We have also conducted a preliminary analysis to determine the sequences within the late promoter that are critical for DNA-protein interaction. Although mutations within the TAAAT sequence common to vaccinia virus late promoters dramatically reduce the level of transcription in vivo (21Davison A.J. Moss B. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 21: 749-769Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 22Bertholet C. Stocco P. VanMeir E. Wittek R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1951-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and in vitro (16Wright C.F. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8883-8887Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), no effect on the interaction of VLTF-X with a late promoter containing a TGAAT mutation was observed. This result suggests that this sequence must have functions other than in the interaction with VLTF-X. We did, however, observe that a promoter lacking the upstream tract of T residues seen to be necessary for late promoter function in vivo did not bind VLTF-X, suggesting that these residues may play a role in factor binding or recruitment to the promoter. In accordance with our results, recent studies by Zhu et al.(27Zhu M. Moore T. Broyles S.S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3893-3899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have identified a factor termed LPBP (for latepromoter-binding protein) in uninfected HeLa cells that binds to vaccinia virus late promoters and stimulates late transcription in vitro. The binding of this factor to late promoters was also unaffected by a mutation in the TAAAT sequence. Considering the size and purification properties of this factor are similar to those of VLTF-X, we consider it likely that the two factors are identical."

Previous mutagenesis experiments have identified three TRAP residues, Lys-37, Lys-56, and Arg-58 that are essential for RNA binding. The location of these residues on the TRAP oligomer supports the proposal that RNA binds TRAP by encircling the TRAP oligomer. In this work, we show that RNAs containing 11 GAG or UAG repeats separated by CC dinucleotide spacers (((G/U)AGCC)11) form stable structures that inhibit binding to TRAP. This conclusion is based on the effects of temperature and Mg2+ on the affinity of TRAP for RNAs with CC spacers combined with UV hyperchromicity and circular dichroism. Furthermore, introducing the base analogue 7-deazaguanosine in the ((G/U)AGCC)11 RNAs stabilized the TRAP-RNA interaction. This effect was associated with decreased stability of the RNA structure as measured by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The precise nature of the structure of the ((G/U)AGCC)11 RNAs is not known but evidence is presented that it involves noncanonical interactions. We also observed that substitution of Arg-58 with Lys further reduced the ability of TRAP to interact with structured RNAs. Since in vivo function of TRAP may involve binding to structured RNAs, we suggest a potential function for this residue, which is conserved in TRAP from three different bacilli.

Tarpey R. Babitzke P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2582-2586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA-binding sites for TRAP contain multiple GAG or UAG (rarely AAG) triplet repeats, generally separated by two or three spacer nucleotides (8Babitzke P. Stults J.T. Shire S.J. Yanofsky C. J.

Results from experiments using artificial RNA-binding sites have demonstrated that these trinucleotide repeats are crucial for TRAP binding (10Babitzke P. Bear D.G. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These studies also indicate that two nucleotide spacer regions are optimal. Lack of sequence conservation, as well as mutagenesis and footprinting experiments have suggested that the spacer nucleotides do not directly interact with the protein (8Babitzke P. Stults J.T.

Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of TRAP complexed with l-tryptophan reveals that TRAP is an oligomeric protein with 11 identical subunits arranged in a symmetrical ring (9Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Wison K.S. Smith T.M. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13Antson A.A. Brzozowski A. Dodson E. Dauter E. Wilson K. Kurecki T. Otrdige J. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The secondary structure of TRAP is entirely comprised of β-strands, β-turns, and random coils. Four β-strands from one subunit combine with 3 β-strands from the adjacent subunit, resulting in a novel quaternary structure consisting of 11 7-stranded antiparallel β-sheets. Mutagenesis studies have identified three residues in TRAP, Lys-37, Lys-56, and Arg-58 that when substituted with alanine decrease the affinity of TRAP for trp leader RNA 600–800-fold without altering its ability to bind tryptophan (14Yang M. Chen X.-P. Militello K. Hoffman R. Fernandez B. Baumann C. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 696-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Structural analysis revealed that 11 clusters of this KKR motif, comprised of Lys-37 from one subunit and Lys-56 and Arg-58 from the adjacent subunit, are directly aligned and encircle the TRAP oligomer. This spatial arrangement suggests a model in which the trp leader RNA wraps around TRAP with the (G/U)AG repeats interacting with these 3 amino acid residues (14Yang M. Chen X.-P. Militello K. Hoffman R. Fernandez B. Baumann C. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 696-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This model implies that the RNA would have to be flexible in order to wrap around the protein. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that the spacer nucleotides in RNA sequences selected for TRAP binding in vitro were predominantly pyrimidines, which stack less well than purines and allow greater flexibility in the RNA (12Baumann C. Xirasagar S. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19863-19869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Arginine residues have been shown to be important in several other protein-RNA interactions (15Tao J. Frankel A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2723-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 16Oubridge C. Ito N. Evans P.R. Teo C.H. Nagai K. Nature. 1994; 372: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Mutagenic analysis of Arg-58 in TRAP revealed that proteins with substitutions of alanine (R58A), glutamine (R58Q), and lysine (R58K) at this position display a broad range of activity (14Yang M. Chen X.-P. Militello K. Hoffman R. Fernandez B. Baumann C. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 696-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Whereas R58A bound trp leader RNA with greater than 600-fold lower affinity than wild-type TRAP, glutamine substitution was less deleterious and replacement with lysine had no effect on RNA binding. These studies suggested a role for hydrogen bonding interactions between this residue and the RNA in the TRAP-RNA complex. Furthermore, although lysine at this position allows TRAP to function similar to wild-type TRAP with regard to RNA binding and gene regulation, residue 58 is an arginine in TRAP proteins from three different bacilli, suggesting an important role for arginine at this position (17Gollnick P. Ishino S. Kuroda M.I. Henner D.J. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8726-8730Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Hoffman R.J. Gollnick P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 839-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2X. Chen, C. Baumann, and P. Gollnick, unpublished results. These studies led us to further examine the role of Arg-58 in the TRAP-RNA interaction. To test the role of this residue in specificity determination, we compared the sequences of RNAs that bind to wild-type TRAP to those that bind R58K TRAP using SELEX (19Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8055) Google Scholar). RNAs selectedin vitro for binding to R58K TRAP showed a bias for UAG over GAG repeats, whereas RNAs selected with wild-type TRAP contained more GAG repeats. These results suggested that Arg-58 may interact with the first nucleotide of each triplet repeat in the RNA, possibly including an interaction with the nitrogen at position 7 (N-7) of guanosine. However, RNAs containing the analogue 7-deazaguanosine (C7G), in which the N-7 is replaced by carbon, showed an unexpected enhanced affinity for TRAP, especially in the case of R58K TRAP. This effect was independent of the position of the analogue in the (G/U)AG repeat but was only observed with RNAs containing CC spacers. Effects of temperature and Mg2+ on the binding of RNAs containing 11 GAG or UAG repeats with UU or CC spacers, as well as thermal denaturation studies of these RNAs demonstrated that ((G/U)AGCC)11 RNAs form stable structures that inhibit binding to TRAP. The exact nature of this structure is not yet known, however, we present evidence that it involves interactions other than Watson-Crick base pairing. Furthermore, although our studies did not support a direct interaction between Arg-58 and the first nucleotide in each triplet repeat, they did indicate a role for Arg-58 in binding to structured RNAs. The nucleoside 7-deazaguanosine was synthesized as described previously (20Ramasamy K. Imamura N. Robins R.K. Revankar G.R. Tetrahedron Lett. 1987; 28: 5107-5110Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Conversion to the triphosphate was achieved by reacting 50 mg of the nucleoside analogue with 34 μl of POCl3 in 100 μl of trimethyl phosphate. Progress of the reaction was followed by silica gel TLC usingn-Pr-OH:NH4OH:H2O (6:3:1). After 1 h, 2 ml of 1 m pyrophosphate tributylammonium salt (Sigma) in freshly distilled dimethylformamide was added. After 10 min, the reaction solution was cooled to 4 °C and quenched by adding 2 ml of triethylamine and 4 ml of H2O and then stored at −20 °C. Purification was achieved by anion exchange chromatography with DEAE-cellulose (22 × 1.5 cm; Whatman DE-52) as described previously (21Wiecsorek A. Dinter-Gottlieb G. Gottlieb P.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1994; 4: 987-994Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The yield of the triphosphate was 1.65 mg.

All plasmids were propagated in Escherichia coli JM107. Plasmid pTZ18UAGCC has 11 repeats of the sequence 5′-TAGCC-3′ cloned downstream of the T7 promoter in pTZ18U (USB). The insert was created by annealing oligonucleotides B (5′-TCTAAGCTTGGCTAGGCTAG-3′) and C (5′-AGAGAATTC(TAGCC)11AAGCT TAGA-3′). The 3′ ends were extended using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and the resulting duplex DNA was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and ligated into similarly digested pTZ18U. With the exception of the sequence of the oligonucleotides that were used to make the duplex DNA, plasmids pTZ18UAGUU and pTZ18GAGUU were made by a similar approach. Oligonucleotides D (5′-AGGGAATTC(TAGTT)10TAGAAGCTTGGTCGTGACTGGGAAAAC-3′) and −40 (5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′) were used to construct plasmid pTZ18UAGUU with 10 repeats of the sequence 5′-TAGTT-3′ followed by TAGA. Plasmid pTZ18GAGUU, with the sequence 5′-GAGTT-3′ repeated 10 times followed by GAGA was constructed using oligonucleotides E (5′-AGGGAATTC(GAGTT)10GAGAAGCTTGGTCGTGACTGGGAAAAC-3′) and −40 (see above). Plasmid pSP64GAGCC contains 11 repeats of the sequence 5′-GAGCC-3′ cloned downstream of the T7 promoter. To construct this plasmid, oligos T7 (5′-AGGAATTCAATTATAATACGACTCACTATA-3′) and F (5′-GAGGGCCC (GGCTC)11TATAGTGAGTCG-3′) were used to make the duplex DNA, which was digested with EcoRI and Bsp120I and ligated into similarly digested pSP64/p36T (22Ziehler W.A. Engelke D.R. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 622-624PubMed Google Scholar). In vitrosynthesis of 32P-labeled RNA using T7 RNA polymerase has been described previously (23Baumann C. Otridge J. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12269-12274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For 7-deazaguanosine (C7G) substituted RNAs, GTP was substituted with C7GTP (2 mm), and GMP (2.5 mm) was included to allow initiation of transcription. Templates for transcription were generated by linearizing the appropriate plasmids with HindIII. For the sake of convenience, we will designate the RNA with 10 GAGUU repeats followed by GAGA as (GAGUU)11, that with 10 UAGUU repeats followed by UAGA as (UAGUU)11, that with 11 UAGCC repeats, as (UAGCC)11, and that with 11 GAGCC repeats, as (GAGCC)11. All of the transcripts, except (GAGCC)11, contain the sequence GGGAAUUC at their 5′ ends. To synthesize unlabeled RNAs, linearized templates were incubated in T7 transcription buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10 mmdithiothreitol, 100 mm MgCl2, 4 mmGTP, ATP, CTP, and UTP and T7 RNA polymerase at 37 °C for 2 h. Transcription of (UAGUU)11 was performed at room temperature because the reaction was most efficient at this temperature. All RNAs were gel-purified and quantitated as described previously (23Baumann C. Otridge J. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12269-12274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Wild-type and R58K TRAP were purified as described previously (13Antson A.A. Brzozowski A. Dodson E.

A. 1993; 90: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Quantitative filter binding assays were performed in filter binding buffer (250 mm potassium glutamate, 16 mm HEPES pH 8.0, and 4 mmMgCl2) as described previously (23Baumann C. Otridge J. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12269-12274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), except that the reactions were incubated for 1 h instead of 15 min, because this time was required for binding to reach equilibrium with some of the RNAs studied. The data was analyzed using a nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm (Psi Plot, Poly Software International, Sandy UT). Data are the average of at least two individual experiments. SELEX experiments with R58K TRAP were performed as described previously for wild-type TRAP (12Baumann C. Xirasagar S. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19863-19869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide pool with 25 random positions, which can accommodate five trinucleotide repeats each separated by two nucleotide spacers was used. This pool size (425) was well represented by 2 nmol of synthetic oligonucleotide. RNAs that bound to TRAP were selected by filter binding and were eluted from the nitrocellulose filters as described previously (12Baumann C. Xirasagar S. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19863-19869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Eight rounds of SELEX were performed and selected RNAs were reverse transcribed, the cDNAs cloned in to pUC118 and individual clones sequenced using Sequenase (Amersham). Temperature-dependent UV absorption data of RNAs (5 μm in 250 mm KCl and 16 mm HEPES pH 8.0) were collected with a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer using a circulating water bath with a heating rates of either 1 °C or 0.25 °C per min. Both heating rates gave identical results. Data were normalized to the absorbance at 16 °C. CD spectra were obtained with a JASCO model J-500C spectropolarimeter using 1-mm path length cuvettes. CD spectra of RNAs (2.5 μm) were recorded between 25 and 80 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. For studies of TRAP binding, 2.5 μm RNA was incubated with 5 μm wild-type TRAP and 50 μml-tryptophan at 55 °C for 1 h. Neither TRAP nor tryptophan show significant dichroism in the range in which the data were recorded (230–300 nm) and therefore make no contribution to the spectra. Previous studies identified Arg-58 as one of three residues important for RNA binding to TRAP (14Yang M. Chen X.-P. Militello K. Hoffman R. Fernandez B. Baumann C. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 696-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of Arg-58 in the specificity of this interaction, we used SELEX to select from a pool of 1.2 × 1015RNAs containing 25 random positions, those RNAs that bound R58K TRAP with highest affinity (19Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8055) Google Scholar). We then compared the sequence requirements for RNA binding to R58K TRAP to those for binding to wild-type. RNAs selected for binding to R58K TRAP were similar to those found previously with wild-type TRAP (12Baumann C. Xirasagar S. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19863-19869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), in that they all contained multiple GAG and UAG repeats (Fig. 1 and Table I).Table IAnalysis of RNA sequences that bind to wild-type and R58K TRAPRepeats1-a% GAG and % UAG refers to their percentage among the triplet repeats in all of the selected RNAs.

Open table in a new tab RNAs were selected using SELEX from a pool containing 25 positions with random nucleotides. The spacers separating the (G/U)AG repeats were also similar to those obtained previously with wild-type TRAP (12Baumann C. Xirasagar S. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19863-19869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), being predominately 2 nucleotides (90%), with 1 (8%) and 3 nucleotides (2%) spacers rarely observed (Table I). The composition of the spacers was also similar to that observed previously with wild-type TRAP, being predominately (>90%) pyrimidines with greater than 75% uridines. We suggested previously that this bias for pyrimidines reflects their lower stacking ability (as compared with purines) allowing greater flexibility for the RNA to wrap around the protein. However, this hypothesis does not explain the preponderance of U's in the spacers since both C's and U's are predicted to stack similarly (25Broyde S. Hingerty B. Nucleic acids Res. 1978; 5: 2729-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and thus would be expected to be present with comparable frequencies if flexibility is the only consideration. Furthermore, few if any C's occurred as CC dinucleotide spacers. In RNAs obtained with wild-type TRAP, 75% of C's in the spacers were observed as CU, 7% as UC, and 6% each as AC, CA, or CC dinucleotides. With R58K TRAP, 88% of the C's occurred as CU spacers, and 4% each as UC, CA, or single nucleotide C spacers. These results suggest that C's in spacers are inhibitory to TRAP binding, particularly as CC spacers. These findings are consistent with previous studies of CU spacers in RNAs with 6 GAG repeats (11Babitzke P. Yealy J. Campanelli D. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5159-5163Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The only significant difference we observed between RNAs that bound R58K TRAP as compared with wild-type TRAP was the ratio of GAG to UAG repeats in the RNAs. While RNAs that bound wild-type TRAP contained more GAGs, RNAs obtained with R58K TRAP contained predominantly UAG repeats (Table I). These results indicate that amino acid substitution at position 58 in TRAP can alter the preference for the base in the first position of the trinucleotide repeat, suggesting that Arg-58 may interact directly with the first G or U in the triplet. One mechanism by which Arg-58 could interact with the first guanosine of a GAG repeat would be by forming two hydrogen bonds with the O-6 and N-7 positions of the base. Such bidentate interactions between arginines and guanosines have been demonstrated to be important in other protein-nucleic acid complexes (15Tao J. Frankel A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2723-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 16Oubridge C. Ito N. Evans P.R. Teo C.H. Nagai K. Nature. 1994; 372: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). This model makes several predictions about the interaction of TRAP with RNA. First, wild-type TRAP should have a much higher affinity for GAG- than for UAG-containing RNAs because arginine can form two hydrogen bonds with guanosine but only one with uracil. This would result in a total of 11 additional hydrogen bonds in a complex between wild-type TRAP and an RNA with 11 GAG repeats as compared with one with 11 UAG repeats (ΔΔG o = 11–22 kcal/mol) (26Lesser D.R. Kurpiewski M.R. Jen-Jacobson L. Science. 1990; 250: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 27Mazzarelli J.M. Rajur S.B. Ladarola P.L. McLaughlin L.W. Biochem. 1992; 31: 5925-5936Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Zhang X. Gottlieb P.A. Biochem. 1993; 32: 11374-11385Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Conversely, R58K TRAP should have similar affinities for both GAG and UAG repeat containing RNAs since lysine can only form one hydrogen bond with either guanosine or uridine. We therefore examined the affinities of wild-type and R58K TRAP for RNAs with 11 GAG repeats ((GAGUU)11) or 11 UAG repeats ((UAGUU)11) (Table II). In contrast to our predictions, at 37 °C in the presence of Mg2+, wild-type TRAP bound (GAGUU)11 and (UAGUU)11 with equal affinities (K d = 0.3 nm). In addition, both wild-type and R58K TRAP bound similarly to both RNAs, although R58K displayed a slightly lower affinity for (GAGUU)11 (K d = 0.8 nm) than for (UAGUU)11 (K d = 0.3 nm). Moreover, at higher temperature (55 °C), both R58K and wild-type TRAP behaved identically when binding to these RNAs (Table II). The results of these binding studies are consistent with our SELEX data, however, they do not support the model of bidentate hydrogen bonding between Arg-58 and guanosine in the first position of the triplet repeats.Table IIEffect of Mg2+ and temperature on RNA binding to wild-type and mutant TRAP(UAGUU)11 K d(nm)2-aApparent K d values (as determined by filter binding) represent the averages of at least two independent experiments; standard deviations were less than 10% of the mean.(GAGUU)11 K d (nm)(UAGCC)11 K d (nm)(GAGCC)11 K d (nm)37 °C37 °C55 °C37 °C37 °C55 °C37 °C37 °C55 °C37 °C37 °C55 °CMg2+2-b+ indicates the presence of 4 mm Mg2+.−++−++−++−++TRAP WT0.30.31ND2-cND, not determined.0.30.32020056609R58K0.30.31ND0.80.3300NB2-dNo binding detected up to 3 μm TRAP.60066672-a Apparent K d values (as determined by filter binding) represent the averages of at least two independent experiments; standard deviations were less than 10% of the mean.2-b + indicates the presence of 4 mm Mg2+.2-c ND, not determined.2-d No binding detected up to 3 μm TRAP. Open table in a new tab Although the binding data did not support the model for two hydrogen bonds between the first guanosine of a GAG repeat and Arg-58, they did not rule out a role for N-7 of guanosines in interacting with TRAP. We tested whether the N-7 position of guanosines are involved in binding to TRAP using RNAs substituted with 7-deazaguanosine (C7G), an analogue of guanosine, in which the nitrogen at position 7 is replaced by carbon (Fig. 2). If the N-7 of guanosine interacts with TRAP via hydrogen bonding, substitution with C7G will eliminate this interaction and therefore lower the affinity of the substituted RNA for TRAP. We were particularly interested in the first position of the triplet repeat, since our studies suggested a possible interaction between Arg-58 and guanosine in this position. However, since it is not possible to specifically replace only the first guanosine of each GAG repeat by in vitro transcription, we first tested the effect of C7G in the third position of each UAG repeat in the RNA (UAGCC)11. We then compared this effect with that of substituting the analogue at both the first and the third positions in each GAG repeat, using RNAs (GAGCC)11and (GAGUU)11. Surprisingly, we found that introduction of C7G in (UAC7GCC)11 did not reduce the affinity of this RNA for either wild-type or R58K TRAP but instead resulted in increased affinity for both proteins as compared with the unsubstituted RNA (Table III). With wild-type TRAP we observed a 30-fold effect, and R58K TRAP bound (UAC7GCC)11 with an apparentK d of 7 nm but showed no detectable binding to the unsubstituted (UAGCC)11 (Table III). Introduction of C7G in both positions of each triplet repeat in (C7GAC7GCC)11 also increased the affinity of this RNA (8–9-fold) relative to the unsubstituted RNA for both wild-type and R58K TRAP (Table III). In contrast to observations with RNAs containing CC spacers,C7G substitution in (C7GAC7GUU)11 had little effect on the affinity of this RNA for wild-type or R58K TRAP (Table III). The observation that incorporation of C7G into either GAG- or UAG-containing RNAs never reduced the affinity of these RNAs for TRAP, and in several cases significantly increased their affinities, suggests that the N-7 of guanosine at neither the first nor the third position of the triplet repeats interacts directly with the protein.Table IIIEffect of 7-deazaguanosine (C7G) on RNA binding to wild-type and mutant TRAP(UAGCC)11 K d3-aApparent K d values were determined by filter binding at 37 °C in the presence of 4 mmMg2+.

These results demonstrate directly that HTLV-I Tax is evolved principally toward activating transcription from the viral cis regulatory element, the HTLV-I 21-bp repeats.The molecular basis for the DNA sequence specificity of Tax trans-activation is not well understood. DNase I footprinting and methylation interference performed on the Tax·CREB·21-bp-repeat complex revealed no protein protection of the G-rich and C-rich sequences (15Paca Uccaralertkun S. Zhao L.J.

Many members of the bZip family, including the mammalian CREB, ATF, c-Jun/c-Fos, and yeast GCN4, bind either the 7-bp AP-1 motif (TGA(C/G)TCA) or the related CRE motif (TGACGTCA). Remarkably, a third group of the families whose members include NF-IL6 (also known as C/EBP-β) and C/EBP, bind a set of DNA elements (T(T/G)NNGNAA(T/G) and CCAAT box, respectively) whose sequences differ significantly from the AP-1 site and CRE.CREB becomes phosphorylated and activated as a function of the cAMP- or Ca2+-mediated signaling process (26Gonzalez G.A.

A 265-kDa protein called CBP (CREB binding protein), and its cellular homologue, p300, specifically bind the Ser133-phosphorylated form of CREB (29Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M.

These data have recently been confirmed and extended (32Giebler H.A. Loring J.E. van Orden K. Colgin M.A. Garrus J.E. Escudero K.W. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. (2) Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5156-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Indeed, in in vitro protein/DNA binding reactions, the inclusion of CBP/p300 results in a highly stable quaternary nucleoprotein complex containing the 21-bp repeat/CREB/Tax/CBP-p300 (see “Results” and Ref. 32Giebler H.A. Loring J.E. van Orden K. Colgin M.A. Garrus J.E. Escudero K.W. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. (2) Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5156-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In essence, Tax functions as a virus-specific link to connect the transcriptional co-activator, CBP/p300, and possibly other cellular transcription factors in a signal-independent manner to CREB/ATF-1 assembled on the viral 21-bp repeats. This allows HTLV-I viral gene expression to proceed in the absence of cellular activation.X-ray structures of the bZip domain of GCN4 and the bZip heterodimer of c-Jun/c-Fos indicate that the dimerization of bZip proteins results from a coiled-coil structure composed of two intertwined α-helices, each derived from one subunit of the homo- or heterodimer (33Ellenberger T.E.

The basic domains extend from the leucine zipper like two prongs of a fork to engage DNA in the major groove (33Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Harrison S.C.

Many of the invariant amino acid residues (boldface letters in Fig. 1) in the basic domain are responsible for sequence-specific contacts with DNA (33Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 34Konig P. Richmond T.J. J. Mol.

In this study, we show that an α-helix extending beyond the DNA-binding domain of CREB bZip is required for Tax binding. Along this extended helix, three amino acid (aa) residues, Arg284, Met291, and Glu299, located on the opposing side of the invariant DNA recognition residues form the contact surface for Tax. The Tax-contact residues span a distance of approximately 23 Å along most of the length of the basic domain and beyond. Interestingly, these three amino acid residues point away from the major groove of the DNA and are posed adjacent to the minor groove of the G/C-rich sequences flanking the CRE motif, which we and others have shown to be critical for Tax binding (11Bantignies F. Rousset R. Desbois C. Jalinot P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2174-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 12Shnyreva M. Munder T. J.

Our data lend further support to the notion that Tax is involved in minor groove DNA contact with the G/C-rich flanking sequences after its binding to CREB. The human T lymphotropic retrovirus type I (HTLV-I)1 trans-activator, Tax, stimulates viral transcription via three imperfect 21-bp repeat DNA elements in the HTLV-I U3 region (1Cann A.J. Irvin S.Y.

Each of the viral 21-bp-repeats contains a cAMP responseelement (CRE) core flanked by 5′ G-rich and 3′ C-rich sequences. The 21-bp repeats, in collaboration with the cellular transcription factors, cAMP responseelement binding protein (CREB), CREB/activating transcriptionfactor 1 (ATF-1) heterodimer, and to a lesser extent, ATF-1 homodimer, form nucleoprotein complexes uniquely capable of recruiting Tax into ternary complexes that mediate trans-activation (7Zhao L.J.

Whereas CREB binds to the CRE irrespective of DNA sequence context, the stable assembly of Tax, CREB, and DNA into a ternary complex and Tax-mediated trans-activation require the CRE and the 5′ G-rich and 3′ C-rich flanking sequences present in the viral 21-bp repeats (11Bantignies F.

Virology. 1995; 214: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).In vitro selection also indicates that DNA sequences bound preferentially by the Tax/CREB complex contain the CRE motif flanked by exceedingly long stretches of 5′ G-rich or 3′ C-rich sequences and bear striking resemblance to the HTLV-I 21-bp repeats (15Paca Uccaralertkun S. Zhao L.J. Adya N. Cross J.V. Cullen B.R. Boros I.M. Giam C.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 456-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results demonstrate directly that HTLV-I Tax is evolved principally toward activating transcription from the viral cis regulatory element, the HTLV-I 21-bp repeats. The molecular basis for the DNA sequence specificity of Tax trans-activation is not well understood. DNase I footprinting and methylation interference performed on the Tax·CREB·21-bp-repeat complex revealed no protein protection of the G-rich and C-rich sequences (15Paca Uccaralertkun S. Zhao L.J. Adya N. Cross J.V. Cullen B.R. Boros I.M. Giam C.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 456-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, naturally occurring or genetically engineered single nucleotide substitutions in the G-rich and C-rich sequences do not affect their function (6Giam C.Z. Xu Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15236-15241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent data indicate that Tax may be involved in contacting the minor groove of the G/C-rich sequences (19Lenzmeier B.A. Giebler H.A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 721-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity for the flanking sequences requires a specific interaction between Tax and the basic region of CREB (20Adya N. Zhao L.J. Huang W. Boros I. Giam C.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5642-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Tax interacts with CREB via the latter's basic domain and amino acid residues in its immediate vicinity (11Bantignies F. Rousset R. Desbois C. Jalinot P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2174-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 12Shnyreva M. Munder T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7478-7484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Adya N. Zhao L.J. Huang W. Boros I.

Like CREB, Tax functions as a dimer (22Perini G. Wagner S. Green M.R. Nature. 1995; 376: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 23Tie F. Adya N. Greene W.C. Giam C.Z. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8368-8374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses of Tax mutants indicate that the CREB-binding domain is located in the NH2 terminus, while the subunit dimerization domain resides in the middle section of Tax (10Goren I. Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. Moelling K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5806-5811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tie F. Adya N. Greene W.C. Giam C.Z. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8368-8374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Adya N. Giam C.Z. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1834-1841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CREB and ATFs are prototypic bZip proteins noted for the common basic domain-leucine zipper structure responsible for sequence specific DNA recognition and intersubunit protein-protein interaction, respectively (25Hai T.W. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Many members of the bZip family, including the mammalian CREB, ATF, c-Jun/c-Fos, and yeast GCN4, bind either the 7-bp AP-1 motif (TGA(C/G)TCA) or the related CRE motif (TGACGTCA). Remarkably, a third group of the families whose members include NF-IL6 (also known as C/EBP-β) and C/EBP, bind a set of DNA elements (T(T/G)NNGNAA(T/G) and CCAAT box, respectively) whose sequences differ significantly from the AP-1 site and CRE. CREB becomes phosphorylated and activated as a function of the cAMP- or Ca2+-mediated signaling process (26Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R.

A 265-kDa protein called CBP (CREB binding protein), and its cellular homologue, p300, specifically bind the Ser133-phosphorylated form of CREB (29Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar) and function as transcriptional co-activators of CREB (30Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C.

These data have recently been confirmed and extended (32Giebler H.A. Loring J.E. van Orden K. Colgin M.A. Garrus J.E. Escudero K.W. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. (2) Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5156-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Indeed, in in vitro protein/DNA binding reactions, the inclusion of CBP/p300 results in a highly stable quaternary nucleoprotein complex containing the 21-bp repeat/CREB/Tax/CBP-p300 (see “Results” and Ref. 32Giebler H.A. Loring J.E. van Orden K. Colgin M.A. Garrus J.E. Escudero K.W. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. (2) Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5156-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In essence, Tax functions as a virus-specific link to connect the transcriptional co-activator, CBP/p300, and possibly other cellular transcription factors in a signal-independent manner to CREB/ATF-1 assembled on the viral 21-bp repeats. This allows HTLV-I viral gene expression to proceed in the absence of cellular activation. X-ray structures of the bZip domain of GCN4 and the bZip heterodimer of c-Jun/c-Fos indicate that the dimerization of bZip proteins results from a coiled-coil structure composed of two intertwined α-helices, each derived from one subunit of the homo- or heterodimer (33Ellenberger T.E.

The basic domains extend from the leucine zipper like two prongs of a fork to engage DNA in the major groove (33Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Harrison S.C.
