https://openalex.org/W2098349861,"Analysis of a series of clinical isolates of the swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus reveals that in mammalian models (mice, ferrets and macaques) the current pandemic virus is associated with more severe disease than a seasonal H1N1 strain. The viruses can also infect pigs but do not cause clinical signs. All antivirus drugs tested, including Tamiflu, were effective in cell culture against the new virus, lending support to the use of these compounds as a first line of defence against the pandemic. On 11 June 2009 the World Health Organization declared that the infections caused by a new strain of influenza A virus closely related to swine viruses had reached pandemic levels. Here, one of the first US isolates of the new swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus (S-OIV) is characterized, as well as several other S-OIV isolates, both in vitro and in vivo. Influenza A viruses cause recurrent outbreaks at local or global scale with potentially severe consequences for human health and the global economy. Recently, a new strain of influenza A virus was detected that causes disease in and transmits among humans, probably owing to little or no pre-existing immunity to the new strain. On 11 June 2009 the World Health Organization declared that the infections caused by the new strain had reached pandemic proportion. Characterized as an influenza A virus of the H1N1 subtype, the genomic segments of the new strain were most closely related to swine viruses1. Most human infections with swine-origin H1N1 influenza viruses (S-OIVs) seem to be mild; however, a substantial number of hospitalized individuals do not have underlying health issues, attesting to the pathogenic potential of S-OIVs. To achieve a better assessment of the risk posed by the new virus, we characterized one of the first US S-OIV isolates, A/California/04/09 (H1N1; hereafter referred to as CA04), as well as several other S-OIV isolates, in vitro and in vivo. In mice and ferrets, CA04 and other S-OIV isolates tested replicate more efficiently than a currently circulating human H1N1 virus. In addition, CA04 replicates efficiently in non-human primates, causes more severe pathological lesions in the lungs of infected mice, ferrets and non-human primates than a currently circulating human H1N1 virus, and transmits among ferrets. In specific-pathogen-free miniature pigs, CA04 replicates without clinical symptoms. The assessment of human sera from different age groups suggests that infection with human H1N1 viruses antigenically closely related to viruses circulating in 1918 confers neutralizing antibody activity to CA04. Finally, we show that CA04 is sensitive to approved and experimental antiviral drugs, suggesting that these compounds could function as a first line of defence against the recently declared S-OIV pandemic."

However, at the metastatic site the role of these cells and their mechanism of actions for establishment and growth of metastases remain largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Using animal models of breast cancer metastasis, we show that a population of host macrophages displaying a distinct phenotype is recruited to extravasating pulmonary metastatic cells regardless of species of origin. Ablation of this macrophage population through three independent means (genetic and chemical) showed that these macrophages are required for efficient metastatic seeding and growth. Importantly, even after metastatic growth is established, ablation of this macrophage population inhibited subsequent growth. Furthermore, imaging of intact lungs revealed that macrophages are required for efficient tumor cell extravasation. Conclusion/Significance These data indicate a direct enhancement of metastatic growth by macrophages through their effects on tumor cell extravasation, survival and subsequent growth and identifies these cells as a new therapeutic target for treatment of metastatic disease."

https://openalex.org/W2012353540,"Many cancer cells display a CIN (Chromosome Instability) phenotype, by which they exhibit high rates of chromosome loss or gain at each cell cycle. Over the years, a number of different mechanisms, including mitotic spindle multipolarity, cytokinesis failure, and merotelic kinetochore orientation, have been proposed as causes of CIN. However, a comprehensive theory of how CIN is perpetuated is still lacking. We used CIN colorectal cancer cells as a model system to investigate the possible cellular mechanism(s) underlying CIN. We found that CIN cells frequently assembled multipolar spindles in early mitosis. However, multipolar anaphase cells were very rare, and live-cell experiments showed that almost all CIN cells divided in a bipolar fashion. Moreover, fixed-cell analysis showed high frequencies of merotelically attached lagging chromosomes in bipolar anaphase CIN cells, and higher frequencies of merotelic attachments in multipolar vs. bipolar prometaphases. Finally, we found that multipolar CIN prometaphases typically possessed gamma-tubulin at all spindle poles, and that a significant fraction of bipolar metaphase/early anaphase CIN cells possessed more than one centrosome at a single spindle pole. Taken together, our data suggest a model by which merotelic kinetochore attachments can easily be established in multipolar prometaphases. Most of these multipolar prometaphase cells would then bi-polarize before anaphase onset, and the residual merotelic attachments would produce chromosome mis-segregation due to anaphase lagging chromosomes. We propose this spindle pole coalescence mechanism as a major contributor to chromosome instability in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2000551557,"Most studies investigating the neurobiology of depression and suicide have focused on the serotonergic system. While it seems clear that serotonergic alterations play a role in the pathogenesis of these major public health problems, dysfunction in additional neurotransmitter systems and other molecular alterations may also be implicated. Microarray expression studies are excellent screening tools to generate hypotheses about additional molecular processes that may be at play. In this study we investigated brain regions that are known to be implicated in the neurobiology of suicide and major depression are likely to represent valid global molecular alterations.We performed gene expression analysis using the HG-U133AB chipset in 17 cortical and subcortical brain regions from suicides with and without major depression and controls. Total mRNA for microarray analysis was obtained from 663 brain samples isolated from 39 male subjects, including 26 suicide cases and 13 controls diagnosed by means of psychological autopsies. Independent brain samples from 34 subjects and animal studies were used to control for the potential confounding effects of comorbidity with alcohol. Using a Gene Ontology analysis as our starting point, we identified molecular pathways that may be involved in depression and suicide, and performed follow-up analyses on these possible targets. Methodology included gene expression measures from microarrays, Gene Score Resampling for global ontological profiling, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR. We observed the highest number of suicide specific alterations in prefrontal cortical areas and hippocampus. Our results revealed alterations of synaptic neurotransmission and intracellular signaling. Among these, Glutamatergic (GLU) and GABAergic related genes were globally altered. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR results investigating expression of GLU and GABA receptor subunit genes were consistent with microarray data.The observed results represent the first overview of global expression changes in brains of suicide victims with and without major depression and suggest a global brain alteration of GLU and GABA receptor subunit genes in these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2162988145,"Background With the exception of APOE ε4 allele, the common genetic risk factors for sporadic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are unknown. Methods and Findings We completed a genome-wide association study on 381 participants in the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) study. Samples were genotyped using the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip. 516,645 unique Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were included in the analysis following quality control measures. The genotype data and raw genetic data are freely available for download (LONI, http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Data/). Two analyses were completed: a standard case-control analysis, and a novel approach using hippocampal atrophy measured on MRI as an objectively defined, quantitative phenotype. A General Linear Model was applied to identify SNPs for which there was an interaction between the genotype and diagnosis on the quantitative trait. The case-control analysis identified APOE and a new risk gene, TOMM40 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40), at a genome-wide significance level of≤10−6 (10−11 for a haplotype). TOMM40 risk alleles were approximately twice as frequent in AD subjects as controls. The quantitative trait analysis identified 21 genes or chromosomal areas with at least one SNP with a p-value≤10−6, which can be considered potential “new” candidate loci to explore in the etiology of sporadic AD. These candidates included EFNA5, CAND1, MAGI2, ARSB, and PRUNE2, genes involved in the regulation of protein degradation, apoptosis, neuronal loss and neurodevelopment. Thus, we identified common genetic variants associated with the increased risk of developing AD in the ADNI cohort, and present publicly available genome-wide data. Supportive evidence based on case-control studies and biological plausibility by gene annotation is provided. Currently no available sample with both imaging and genetic data is available for replication. Conclusions Using hippocampal atrophy as a quantitative phenotype in a genome-wide scan, we have identified candidate risk genes for sporadic Alzheimer's disease that merit further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2054330377,"The bZIP transcription factor Nrf2 has emerged as a pivotal regulator of intracellular redox homeostasis by controlling the expression of many endogenous antioxidants and phase II detoxification enzymes. Upon oxidative stress, Nrf2 is induced at protein levels through redox-sensitive modifications on cysteine residues of Keap1, a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets Nrf2 for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. The mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have previously been proposed to regulate Nrf2 in response to oxidative stress. However, the exact role of MAPKs and the underlying molecular mechanism remain poorly defined. Here we report the first evidence that Nrf2 is phosphorylated in vivo by MAPKs. We have identified multiple serine/threonine residues as major targets of MAPK-mediated phosphorylation. Combined alanine substitution on those residues leads to a moderate decrease in the transcriptional activity of Nrf2, most likely due to a slight reduction in its nuclear accumulation. More importantly, Nrf2 protein stability, primarily controlled by Keap1, is not altered by Nrf2 phosphorylation in vivo. These data indicate that direct phosphorylation of Nrf2 by MAPKs has limited contribution in modulating Nrf2 activity. We suggest that MAPKs regulate the Nrf2 signaling pathway mainly through indirect mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2064861163,"DNA methylation [1], [2] is capable of modulating coordinate expression of large numbers of genes across many different pathways, and may therefore warrant investigation for their potential role between genes and disease phenotype. In a rare set of monozygotic twins discordant for Alzheimer's disease (AD), significantly reduced levels of DNA methylation were observed in temporal neocortex neuronal nuclei of the AD twin. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms may mediate at the molecular level the effects of life events on AD risk, and provide, for the first time, a potential explanation for AD discordance despite genetic similarities."
https://openalex.org/W1965360728,"Ecological and genetic factors that govern the occurrence and persistence of anthrax reservoirs in the environment are obscure. A central tenet, based on limited and often conflicting studies, has long held that growing or vegetative forms of Bacillus anthracis survive poorly outside the mammalian host and must sporulate to survive in the environment. Here, we present evidence of a more dynamic lifecycle, whereby interactions with bacterial viruses, or bacteriophages, elicit phenotypic alterations in B. anthracis and the emergence of infected derivatives, or lysogens, with dramatically altered survival capabilities. Using both laboratory and environmental B. anthracis strains, we show that lysogeny can block or promote sporulation depending on the phage, induce exopolysaccharide expression and biofilm formation, and enable the long-term colonization of both an artificial soil environment and the intestinal tract of the invertebrate redworm, Eisenia fetida. All of the B. anthracis lysogens existed in a pseudolysogenic-like state in both the soil and worm gut, shedding phages that could in turn infect non-lysogenic B. anthracis recipients and confer survival phenotypes in those environments. Finally, the mechanism behind several phenotypic changes was found to require phage-encoded bacterial sigma factors and the expression of at least one host-encoded protein predicted to be involved in the colonization of invertebrate intestines. The results here demonstrate that during its environmental phase, bacteriophages provide B. anthracis with alternatives to sporulation that involve the activation of soil-survival and endosymbiotic capabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2138442021,"Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are remarkable ""green energy"" devices that exploit microbes to generate electricity from organic compounds. MFC devices currently being used and studied do not generate sufficient power to support widespread and cost-effective applications. Hence, research has focused on strategies to enhance the power output of the MFC devices, including exploring more electrochemically active microbes to expand the few already known electricigen families. However, most of the MFC devices are not compatible with high throughput screening for finding microbes with higher electricity generation capabilities. Here, we describe the development of a microfabricated MFC array, a compact and user-friendly platform for the identification and characterization of electrochemically active microbes. The MFC array consists of 24 integrated anode and cathode chambers, which function as 24 independent miniature MFCs and support direct and parallel comparisons of microbial electrochemical activities. The electricity generation profiles of spatially distinct MFC chambers on the array loaded with Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 differed by less than 8%. A screen of environmental microbes using the array identified an isolate that was related to Shewanella putrefaciens IR-1 and Shewanella sp. MR-7, and displayed 2.3-fold higher power output than the S. oneidensis MR-1 reference strain. Therefore, the utility of the MFC array was demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2133907923,"Although the lipid mediator prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) exerts antifibrotic effects by inhibiting multiple fibroblast functions, its ability to regulate fibroblast survival is unknown. Here, we examined the effects of this prostanoid on apoptosis and apoptosis pathways in normal and fibrotic lung fibroblasts. As compared to medium alone, 24 h of treatment with PGE(2) increased apoptosis of normal lung fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner (EC(50) approximately 50 nM), as measured by annexin V staining, caspase 3 activity, cleavage of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, and single-stranded DNA levels. PGE(2) also potentiated apoptosis elicited by Fas ligand plus cycloheximide. These proapoptotic actions were dependent on signaling through the EP2/EP4 receptors and by downstream activation of both caspases 8 and 9. Silencing and gene deletion of PTEN demonstrated that the effects of PGE(2) involved decreased activity of the prosurvival molecule Akt. PGE(2) also down-regulated expression of survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis, and increased expression of Fas. Fibroblasts from patients with pulmonary fibrosis exhibited resistance to the apoptotic effects of PGE(2). These findings show for the first time that, in contrast to its effects on many other cell types, PGE(2) promotes apoptosis in lung fibroblasts through diverse pathways. They provide another dimension by which PGE(2) may inhibit, and perhaps even reverse, fibrogenesis in patients with interstitial lung disease."
https://openalex.org/W1583868454,"Lung injury promotes the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7, matrilysin), which is required for neutrophil recruitment and re-epithelialization. MMP7 governs the lung inflammatory response through the shedding of syndecan-1. Because inflammation and repair are related events, we evaluated the role of syndecan-1 shedding in lung re-epithelialization.Epithelial injury induced syndecan-1 shedding from wild-type epithelium but not from Mmp7(-/-) mice in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, cell migration and wound closure was enhanced by MMP7 shedding of syndecan-1. Additionally, we found that syndecan-1 augmented cell adhesion to collagen by controlling the affinity state of the alpha(2)beta(1) integrin.MMP7 shedding of syndecan-1 facilitates wound closure by causing the alpha(2)beta(1) integrin to assume a less active conformation thereby removing restrictions to migration. MMP7 acts in the lungs to regulate inflammation and repair, and our data now show that both these functions are controlled through the shedding of syndecan-1."
https://openalex.org/W2004293593,"Gene expression alterations have previously been associated with type 2 diabetes, however whether these changes are primary causes or secondary effects of type 2 diabetes is not known. As healthy first degree relatives of people with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, they provide a good model in the search for primary causes of the disease.We determined gene expression profiles in skeletal muscle biopsies from Caucasian males with type 2 diabetes, healthy first degree relatives, and healthy controls. Gene expression was measured using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays covering the entire human genome. These arrays have not previously been used for this type of study. We show for the first time that genes involved in insulin signaling are significantly upregulated in first degree relatives and significantly downregulated in people with type 2 diabetes. On the individual gene level, 11 genes showed altered expression levels in first degree relatives compared to controls, among others KIF1B and GDF8 (myostatin). LDHB was found to have a decreased expression in both groups compared to controls.We hypothesize that increased expression of insulin signaling molecules in first degree relatives of people with type 2 diabetes, work in concert with increased levels of insulin as a compensatory mechanism, counter-acting otherwise reduced insulin signaling activity, protecting these individuals from severe insulin resistance. This compensation is lost in people with type 2 diabetes where expression of insulin signaling molecules is reduced."
https://openalex.org/W2001372608,"Background Arterial aging is well characterized in industrial populations, but scantly described in populations with little access to modern medicine. Here we characterize health and aging among the Tsimane, Amazonian forager-horticulturalists with short life expectancy, high infectious loads and inflammation, but low adiposity and robust physical fitness. Inflammation has been implicated in all stages of arterial aging, atherogenesis and hypertension, and so we test whether greater inflammation associates with atherosclerosis and CVD risk. In contrast, moderate to vigorous daily activity, minimal obesity, and low fat intake predict minimal CVD risk among older Tsimane. Methods and Findings Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), based on the Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI), and hypertension were measured in Tsimane adults, and compared with rates from industrialized populations. No cases of PAD were found among Tsimane and hypertension was comparatively low (prevalence: 3.5%, 40+; 23%, 70+). Markers of infection and inflammation were much higher among Tsimane than among U.S. adults, whereas HDL was substantially lower. Regression models examine associations of ABI and BP with biomarkers of energy balance and metabolism and of inflammation and infection. Among Tsimane, obesity, blood lipids, and disease history were not significantly associated with ABI. Unlike the Tsimane case, higher cholesterol, C-reactive protein, leukocytes, cigarette smoking and systolic pressure among North Americans are all significantly associated with lower ABI. Conclusions Inflammation may not always be a risk factor for arterial degeneration and CVD, but instead may be offset by other factors: healthy metabolism, active lifestyle, favorable body mass, lean diet, low blood lipids and cardiorespiratory health. Other possibilities, including genetic susceptibility and the role of helminth infections, are discussed. The absence of PAD and CVD among Tsimane parallels anecdotal reports from other small-scale subsistence populations and suggests that chronic vascular disease had little impact on adult mortality throughout most of human evolutionary history."
https://openalex.org/W2075520537,"Although helping behavior is ubiquitous throughout the animal kingdom, actual rescue activity is particularly rare. Nonetheless, here we report the first experimental evidence that ants, Cataglyphis cursor, use precisely directed rescue behavior to free entrapped victims; equally important, they carefully discriminate between individuals in distress, offering aid only to nestmates. Our experiments simulate a natural situation, which we often observed in the field when collecting Catagyphis ants, causing sand to collapse in the process. Using a novel experimental technique that binds victims experimentally, we observed the behavior of separate, randomly chosen groups of 5 C. cursor nestmates under one of six conditions. In five of these conditions, a test stimulus (the “victim”) was ensnared with nylon thread and held partially beneath the sand. The test stimulus was either (1) an individual from the same colony; (2) an individual from a different colony of C cursor; (3) an ant from a different ant species; (4) a common prey item; or, (5) a motionless (chilled) nestmate. In the final condition, the test stimulus (6) consisted of the empty snare apparatus. Our results demonstrate that ants are able to recognize what, exactly, holds their relative in place and direct their behavior to that object, the snare, in particular. They begin by excavating sand, which exposes the nylon snare, transporting sand away from it, and then biting at the snare itself. Snare biting, a behavior never before reported in the literature, demonstrates that rescue behavior is far more sophisticated, exact and complexly organized than the simple forms of helping behavior already known, namely limb pulling and sand digging. That is, limb pulling and sand digging could be released directly by a chemical call for help and thus result from a very simple mechanism. However, it's difficult to see how this same releasing mechanism could guide rescuers to the precise location of the nylon thread, and enable them to target their bites to the thread itself."
https://openalex.org/W1985142231,"Recurrent deletions of 2q32q33 have recently been reported as a new microdeletion syndrome. Clinical features of this syndrome include severe mental retardation, growth retardation, dysmorphic features, thin and sparse hair, feeding difficulties and cleft or high palate. The commonly deleted region contains at least seven genes. Haploinsufficiency of one of these genes, SATB2, a DNA-binding protein that regulates gene expression, has been implicated as causative in the cleft or high palate of individuals with 2q32q33 microdeletion syndrome. In this study we describe three individuals with smaller microdeletions of this region, within 2q33.1. The deletions ranged in size from 173.1 kb to 185.2 kb and spanned part of SATB2. Review of clinical records showed similar clinical features among these individuals, including severe developmental delay and tooth abnormalities. Two of the individuals had behavioral problems. Only one of the subjects presented here had a cleft palate, suggesting reduced penetrance for this feature. Our results suggest that deletion of SATB2 is responsible for several of the clinical features associated with 2q32q33 microdeletion syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2041958683,"Similar to CNG and HCN channels, EAG and ERG channels contain a cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) in their C terminus. While cyclic nucleotides have been shown to facilitate opening of CNG and HCN channels, their effect on EAG and ERG channels is less clear. Here we explored cyclic nucleotide binding and modulation of mEAG1 and hERG1 channels with fluorescence and electrophysiology. Binding of cyclic nucleotides to the isolated CNBD of mEAG1 and hERG1 channels was examined with two independent fluorescence-based methods: changes in tryptophan fluorescence and fluorescence of an analog of cAMP, 8-NBD-cAMP. As a positive control for cyclic nucleotide binding we used changes in the fluorescence of the isolated CNBD of mHCN2 channels. Our results indicated that cyclic nucleotides do not bind to the isolated CNBD domain of mEAG1 channels and bind with low affinity (K(d) > or = 51 microm) to the isolated CNBD of hERG1 channels. Consistent with the results on the isolated CNBD, application of cyclic nucleotides to inside-out patches did not affect currents recorded from mEAG1 channels. Surprisingly, despite its low affinity binding to the isolated CNBD, cAMP also had no effect on currents from hERG1 channels even at high concentrations. Our results indicate that cyclic nucleotides do not directly modulate mEAG1 and hERG1 channels. Further studies are necessary to determine if the CNBD in the EAG family of K(+) channels might harbor a binding site for a ligand yet to be uncovered."
https://openalex.org/W2042429347,"Protein C-mannosylation is the attachment of alpha-mannopyranose to tryptophan via a C-C linkage. This post-translational modification typically occurs within the sequence motif WXXW, which is frequently present in thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSRs). TSRs are especially numerous in and a defining feature of the ADAMTS superfamily. We investigated the presence and functional significance of C-mannosylation of ADAMTS-like 1/punctin-1, which contains four TSRs (two with predicted C-mannosylation sites), using mass spectrometry, metabolic labeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and expression in C-mannosylation-defective Chinese hamster ovary cell variants. Analysis of tryptic fragments of recombinant human punctin-1 by mass spectrometry identified a peptide derived from TSR1 containing the (36)WDAWGPWSECSRTC(49) sequence of interest modified with two mannose residues and a Glc-Fuc disaccharide (O-fucosylation). Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and MS/MS/MS analysis demonstrated the characteristic cross-ring cleavage of C-mannose and identified the modified residues as Trp(39) and Trp(42). C-Mannosylation of TSR1 of the related protease ADAMTS5 was also identified. Metabolic labeling of CHO-K1 cells or Lec35.1 cells demonstrated incorporation of d-[2,6-(3)H]mannose in secreted punctin-1 from CHO-K1 cells but not Lec35.1 cells. Quantitation of punctin-1 secretion in Lec35.1 cells versus CHO-K1 cells suggested decreased secretion in Lec35.1 cells. Replacement of mannosylated Trp residues in TSR1 with either Ala or Phe affected punctin secretion efficiency. These data demonstrate that TSR1 from punctin-1 carries C-mannosylation in close proximity to O-linked fucose. Together, these modifications appear to provide a quality control mechanism for punctin-1 secretion."

Although bacterial and fungal Phys use the immediate cleavage product biliverdin (BV), cyanobacterial and higher plant Phys use phycocyanobilin (PCB) and phytochromobilin, respectively, produced by enzymatic reduction of BV (1Rockwell N.C. Su Y.S. Lagarias J.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 837-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 2Vierstra R.D. Karniol B. Handbook of Photosensory Receptors.in: Briggs W.R. Spudich J.L. Wiley-VCH Press, Weinheim, Germany2005: 171-196Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The bilin is then covalently bound autocatalytically to the photosensory unit of the apoprotein, which typically contains a sequence of Per/Arndt/Sim (PAS), cGMP phosphodiesterase/adenyl cyclase/FhlA (GAF), and Phy-associated (PHY) domains. Intimate contact between the bilin and surrounding protein residues then generates the unique photochromic properties of Phys. Recent three-dimensional structures of the Pr form of several bacterial Phys (BphPs) and two cyanobacterial Phys (Cphs) have shown that the bilin is deeply buried within the GAF domain in a ZZZssa configuration and that the connection between the GAF and PAS domains is stabilized by a rare figure-of-eight knot involving the region upstream of the PAS domain being lassoed by a conserved loop within the GAF domain (4Wagner J.R.

Although the structure of Pfr remains unsolved, various physicochemical studies have proposed that photoconversion involves a rotation of one of the three methine bridges between the pyrrole rings (1Rockwell N.C.

This rotation then induces much slower thermally driven movements of the protein to initiate signal transduction. In microorganisms, Pfr can activate a variety of signaling systems using output motifs directly appended to the C-terminal end of the photosensory region. The most prevalent are histidine kinase domains that then begin specific two-component phosphorelays (3Karniol B. Wagner J.R. Walker J.M. Vierstra R.D. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 15Yeh K.C. Wu S.H. Murphy J.T. Lagarias J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 1505-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 16Bhoo S.H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Although the output of plant Phys remains unclear, the presence of a C-terminal HK-related domain suggests that they also work as light-regulated protein kinases (17Yeh K.C. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13976-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In addition to the canonical Phys, it has become apparent through phylogenetic and biochemical studies that a heterogeneous collection of Phy-like photoreceptors exists (e.g. Refs. 3Karniol B. Wagner J.R. Walker J.M. Vierstra R.D. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar and 18Wu S.H. Lagarias J.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13487-13495Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These include Phys that prefer Pfr as the dark-adapted state (7Yang X. Kuk J. Moffat K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Katayama M. Geng X. Ikeuchi M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 1729-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 23Hirose Y. Shimada T. Narikawa R. Katayama M. Ikeuchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. 2008; 380: 844-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Often these Phy-like sequences are missing key residues or domains common among canonical Phys, suggesting that they employ novel bilins as chromophores, bind the bilin in different architectures, and/or use distinct photochemistries. One subclass of novel Phy-like photoreceptors present in a number of cyanobacteria, which we have designated cyanochromes (or Cycs) to better distinguish them from Cphs, is exemplified by Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (Syn) PixJ (or TaxD1, locus sll0041) and its relatives. Syn-PixJ was discovered based on its involvement in blue light-mediated phototaxis in this mesophilic cyanobacterium (26Bhaya D. Takahashi A. Grossman A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 7540-7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 27Yoshihara S. Suzuki F. Fujita H. Geng X.X. Ikeuchi M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) with its close homolog Te-PixJ (locus tll0569) then found in the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 by sequence similarity (28Ishizuka T. Shimada T. Okajima K. Yoshihara S. Ochiai Y. Katayama M. Ikeuchi M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Like Cphs, the cyanochromes tested thus far covalently bind PCB but then generate photoreceptors that convert between blue and green light-absorbing forms designated Pb and Pg, respectively (22Yoshihara S. Katayama M. Geng X. Ikeuchi M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 1729-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24Rockwell N.C. Njuguna S.L. Roberts L. Castillo E. Parson V.L. Dwojak S. Lagarias J.C. Spiller S.C. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7304-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 29Ikeuchi M. Ishizuka T. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2008; 7: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies proposed that PCB is converted to phycoviolobilin (PVB) upon attachment to the apoprotein (30Ishizuka T. Narikawa R. Kohchi T. Katayama M. Ikeuchi M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2007; 48: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PVB differs from PCB by having a methylene instead of a methine bridge between the A and B pyrrole rings, which blue-shifts the absorption of the chromophore by shortening the π-conjugation system. Phototransformation of Pb to Pg could then occur by a mechanism similar to Phys. How Te-PixJ and related cyanochromes bind PCB to generate more blue-shifted PVB-type chromophores remains unclear. Like Cphs, two cyanochromes examples link PCB via a thioether linkage between a cysteine in the Cyc-GAF domain and the C31 carbon of the ethylidene side chain of ring A (24Rockwell N.C. Njuguna S.L. Roberts L. Castillo E. Parson V.L. Dwojak S. Lagarias J.C. Spiller S.C. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7304-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 28Ishizuka T. Shimada T. Okajima K. Yoshihara S. Ochiai Y. Katayama M. Ikeuchi M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Additionally, loss of the C4=C5 double bond is necessary to generate PVB. One model by Ishizuka et al. (30Ishizuka T. Narikawa R. Kohchi T. Katayama M. Ikeuchi M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2007; 48: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) from studies with Te-PixJ proposed that the double bond moves from the C4-C5 position to the C2-C3 position by an autoisomerase activity intrinsic to the GAF domain. A more recent model by Rockwell et al. (24Rockwell N.C. Njuguna S.L. Roberts L. Castillo E. Parson V.L. Dwojak S. Lagarias J.C. Spiller S.C. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7304-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) using another Syn-PixJ relative in T. elongatus, Tlr0924, invoked the possibility of a second cysteine that also participates in PCB ligation. This cysteine was proposed to bind the bilin at the C10 position via a reversible thioether linkage. In the dark-adapted Pb state, the second linkage would then be formed to generate a rubin-like chromophore attached to the bridge between the B and C pyrrole rings. This bond would then break upon photoconversion to generate the more π-conjugated green light-absorbing photoproduct Pg. In this report, we employed a number of physicochemical approaches to help resolve the unique chromophore architecture and photochemical properties of cyanochromes, using Te-PixJ as the example. By independently mutagenizing the cysteine that binds the A ring ethylidene (Cys-522 (22Yoshihara S. Katayama M. Geng X. Ikeuchi M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 1729-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)) and that proposed by Rockwell et al. (24Rockwell N.C. Njuguna S.L. Roberts L. Castillo E. Parson V.L. Dwojak S. Lagarias J.C. Spiller S.C. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7304-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) to reversibly bind the bilin at a second site (Cys-494), we demonstrate that both residues form light-stable covalent adducts with a PVB-type chromophore. In addition, we employed various spectroscopic methods to show that the bound PVB is fully protonated as both Pb and Pg, that only one pyrrole ring is active during photoconversion, and that the polypeptide may undergo extensive remodeling as Pb converts to Pg. We identified a set of conserved amino acids in Te-PixJ important for cyanochrome photochemistry, including several that when substituted generate yellow or red fluorescent chromoproteins potentially useful for cell biological applications. Phylogenetic analyses show that cyanochromes are widespread among cyanobacteria with their closest relatives being members of the red/far-red light-absorbing Phy subfamily defined by the absence of the N-terminal PAS domain (31Ulijasz A.T. Cornilescu G. von Stetten D. Kaminski S. Mroginski M.A. Zhang J. Bhaya D. Hildebrandt P. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol.

Phy/Cyc sequences were identified by performing BLAST searches of the GenBankTM data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) using the Te-PixJ Cyc-GAF domain sequence as the query. Amino acid sequence alignments were generated with ClustalW (32Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54897) Google Scholar) and displayed using MacBoxShade version 2.15 (Institute of Animal Health, Pirbright, UK). Secondary structure was predicted using the Scratch Protein Predictor (SSpro) (33Pollastri G. Przybylski D. Rost B. Baldi P.

Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar) by inputting an alignment of the SyB-Cph1 GAF domain (Leu-31 to Gln-200) and Te-PixJ Cyc-GAF domain (Arg-440 to Phe-585) sequences along with the three-dimensional structure of SyB-Cph1(GAF) as the molecular template (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 2K2N (8Cornilescu G.

Representations of the predicted Te-PixJ(Cyc-GAF) structure were generated by PyMOL (DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA). Phy, Cyc and related sequences were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the Joint Genomes Institute (JGI) data bases and are listed with their accession numbers in supplemental Table 1. Sequences were aligned using CLUSTALX (36Chenna R. Sugawara H. Koike T. Lopez R. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3996) Google Scholar) under default settings and trimmed to include only the GAF domain (supplemental Table 2). Phylogenetic analysis was performed with MrBayes version 3.1.2 (37Ronquist F. Huelsenbeck J.P. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1572-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (24501) Google Scholar) using the proportion of invariable sites γ rate model and the mixed amino acid model. The software was run for 1,350,000 generations, discarding the first 25% (337,500 generations) as “burn-in” after checking that the log likelihood values had plateaued. The strict consensus tree was displayed with TreeView (38Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). A similar tree architecture was produced using the PROTML application in the PHYLIP package (39Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar). The coding regions for the Cyc-GAF domain from Te-PixJ (residues 430–591 from locus tll0569) and Syn-Etr1 (residues 466–624 from locus slr1212) were PCR-amplified from T. elongatus BP-1 genomic DNA and the Synechocystis plasmid pYCDE (40Rodríguez F.I.

Primers used in this study are shown in supplemental Table 3. Recombinant GAF domain expression and purification were performed as described previously (31Ulijasz A.T. Cornilescu G. von Stetten D.

Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10566-10571Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For in vitro assembly, Escherichia coli crude extracts containing the apoprotein were incubated with 200 μm protoporphyrin IXα, BV, or PCB at 4 °C for 4 h prior to purification. Bilin incorporation was assayed by zinc-induced fluorescence of the chromoproteins following SDS-PAGE (15Yeh K.C. Wu S.H. Murphy J.T. Lagarias J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 1505-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 29Ikeuchi M. Ishizuka T. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2008; 7: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The zinc-impregnated gels were irradiated with UV light with the fluorescence emission detected in the visible region of the light spectrum. To isotopically label PCB with 13C at carbons 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 15, and 19 prior to assembly with the Te-PixJ(Cyc-GAF) apoprotein, 100 μm 5-[13C]α-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) was added to the minimal expression medium as described (31Ulijasz A.T. Cornilescu G. von Stetten D. Kaminski S. Mroginski M.A. Zhang J. Bhaya D. Hildebrandt P. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol.

Incorporation of 15N into PCB was similarly accomplished by adding a final concentration of 100 μm [15N]ALA (Medical Isotopes Inc., Pelham, NH). Following a 2-h induction of the E. coli BL21-AI cultures with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and an overnight induction at 18 °C with 0.2% arabinose, the expressed proteins were purified by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Ni-NTA) chromatography (Qiagen, Valencia CA), using 300 mm imidazole for elution. Most eluates were then dialyzed into 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filters (10 kDa cutoff, Millipore, Billerica, MA), with the exception of samples used for resonance Raman (RR) or IR spectroscopy, which were dialyzed into 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA. Samples for NMR analysis were further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography with a phenyl-HP column (GE Healthcare) (31Ulijasz A.T. Cornilescu G. von Stetten D. Kaminski S.

The [15N]ALA-labeled Te-PixJ(GAF) samples were brought to a concentration of 1.5 mm before NMR analysis. Absorption spectra were measured with a PerkinElmer Lambda 650 UV-visible spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with the samples dissolved in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Pb → Pg and Pg → Pb photoconversions were achieved with white light filtered through appropriate 430- and 530-nm interference filters, respectively. Pr → Pfr and Pfr → Pr photoconversions were achieved with white light filtered through 630- and 690-nm interference filters, respectively. For denaturation experiments, the chromoproteins were either photoconverted with white light and the appropriate interference filter (430 nm for Pb and 630 nm for Pr) or kept in darkness followed by denaturation in 8 m urea (pH 2.0). Soluble and bound chromophores were separated following 10% trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The precipitated fraction was redissolved in acidic urea. Following UV-visible absorption measurements, denatured samples were then irradiated with the appropriate wavelength of light corresponding to their Pb/Pr and Pg/Pfr peak absorbance as follows: wild-type Te-PixJ(Cyc-GAF) (590 and 530 nm), Te-PixJ(Cyc-GAF) D494H (590 and 660 nm), Te-PixJ(Cyc-GAF) C522A (590 or 690 nm), Te-PixJ(Cyc-GAF) C494A, and SyB-Cph1(GAF) (590 and 660 nm). Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra were recorded with a QuantaMaster model C-60/2000 spectrofluorometer (Photon Technologies International, Birmingham, NJ). Emission spectra were recorded with an excitation of 523–555 nm, depending on the sample. Wild-type Te-PixJ(Cyc-GAF) and the Y463H, D492H, and C522A mutants were excited with 360 nm light, and the C494H and C494A mutants were excited with 590 nm light. Excitation spectra were recorded with 551–651-nm emission wavelengths, depending on the sample. RR spectra were recorded with 1064 nm excitation (Nd-YAG continuous wave laser, line width <1 cm−1) using a RFS 100/S (Bruker Optics, Ettlingen, Germany) Fourier transform Raman spectrometer (4 cm−1 spectral resolution). The near IR excitation line was sufficiently close to the first electronic transition to generate a strong preresonance enhancement of the chromophoric vibrational bands such that Raman bands of the protein matrix remained very weak in the spectra of the parent states (42Wagner J.R.

https://openalex.org/W2067631794,"G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of cell surface receptors; they activate heterotrimeric G-proteins in response to ligand stimulation. Although many GPCRs have been shown to form homo- and/or heterodimers on the cell membrane, the purpose of this dimerization is not known. Recent research has shown that receptor dimerization may have a role in organization of receptors on the cell surface. In addition, microdomains on the cell membrane termed lipid rafts have been shown to play a role in GPCR localization. Using a combination of stochastic (Monte Carlo) and deterministic modeling, we propose a novel mechanism for lipid raft partitioning of GPCRs based on reversible dimerization of receptors and then demonstrate that such localization can affect GPCR signaling. Modeling results are consistent with a variety of experimental data indicating that lipid rafts have a role in amplification or attenuation of G-protein signaling. Thus our work suggests a new mechanism by which dimerization-inducing or inhibiting characteristics of ligands can influence GPCR signaling by controlling receptor organization on the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2076866050,"A stimulus approaching the body requires fast processing and appropriate motor reactions. In monkeys, fronto-parietal networks are involved both in integrating multisensory information within a limited space surrounding the body (i.e. peripersonal space, PPS) and in action planning and execution, suggesting an overlap between sensory representations of space and motor representations of action. In the present study we investigate whether these overlapping representations also exist in the human brain.We recorded from hand muscles motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by single-pulse of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) after presenting an auditory stimulus either near the hand or in far space. MEPs recorded 50 ms after the near-sound onset were enhanced compared to MEPs evoked after far sounds. This near-far modulation faded at longer inter-stimulus intervals, and reversed completely for MEPs recorded 300 ms after the sound onset. At that time point, higher motor excitability was associated with far sounds. Such auditory modulation of hand motor representation was specific to a hand-centred, and not a body-centred reference frame.This pattern of corticospinal modulation highlights the relation between space and time in the pps representation: an early facilitation for near stimuli may reflect immediate motor preparation, whereas, at later time intervals, motor preparation relates to distant stimuli potentially approaching the body."
https://openalex.org/W2045156720,"Adaptive radiation in Mediterranean plants is poorly understood. The white-flowered Cistus lineage consists of 12 species primarily distributed in Mediterranean habitats and is herein subject to analysis.We conducted a ""total evidence"" analysis combining nuclear (ncpGS, ITS) and plastid (trnL-trnF, trnK-matK, trnS-trnG, rbcL) DNA sequences and using MP and BI to test the hypothesis of radiation as suggested by previous phylogenetic results. One of the five well-supported lineages of the Cistus-Halimium complex, the white-flowered Cistus lineage, comprises the higher number of species (12) and is monophyletic. Molecular dating estimates a Mid Pleistocene (1.04+/-0.25 Ma) diversification of the white-flowered lineage into two groups (C. clusii and C. salviifolius lineages), which display asymmetric characteristics: number of species (2 vs. 10), leaf morphologies (linear vs. linear to ovate), floral characteristics (small, three-sepalled vs. small to large, three- or five-sepalled flowers) and ecological attributes (low-land vs. low-land to mountain environments). A positive phenotype-environment correlation has been detected by historical reconstructions of morphological traits (leaf shape, leaf labdanum content and leaf pubescence). Ecological evidence indicates that modifications of leaf shape and size, coupled with differences in labdanum secretion and pubescence density, appear to be related to success of new species in different Mediterranean habitats.The observation that radiation in the Cistus salviifolius lineage has been accompanied by the emergence of divergent leaf traits (such as shape, pubescence and labdanum secretion) in different environments suggets that radiation in the group has been adaptive. Here we argued that the diverse ecological conditions of Mediterranean habitats played a key role in directing the evolution of alternative leaf strategies in this plant group. Key innovation of morphological characteristics is supported by our dated phylogeny, in which a Mediterranean climate establishment (2.8 Ma) predated the adaptive radiation of the white-flowered Cistus."
https://openalex.org/W2083262188,"The androgen receptor (AR) plays important roles in the development of male phenotype and in different human diseases including prostate cancers. The AR can act either as a promoter or a tumor suppressor depending on cell types. The AR proliferative response program has been well studied, but its prohibitive response program has not yet been thoroughly studied.Previous studies found that PC3 cells expressing the wild-type AR inhibit growth and suppress invasion. We applied expression profiling to identify the response program of PC3 cells expressing the AR (PC3-AR) under different growth conditions (i.e. with or without androgens and at different concentration of androgens) and then applied the newly developed ChIP-seq technology to identify the AR binding regions in the PC3 cancer genome. A surprising finding was that the comparison of MOCK-transfected PC3 cells with AR-transfected cells identified 3,452 differentially expressed genes (two fold cutoff) even without the addition of androgens (i.e. in ethanol control), suggesting that a ligand independent activation or extremely low-level androgen activation of the AR. ChIP-Seq analysis revealed 6,629 AR binding regions in the cancer genome of PC3 cells with an FDR (false discovery rate) cut off of 0.05. About 22.4% (638 of 2,849) can be mapped to within 2 kb of the transcription start site (TSS). Three novel AR binding motifs were identified in the AR binding regions of PC3-AR cells, and two of them share a core consensus sequence CGAGCTCTTC, which together mapped to 27.3% of AR binding regions (1,808/6,629). In contrast, only about 2.9% (190/6,629) of AR binding sites contains the canonical AR matrix M00481, M00447 and M00962 (from the Transfac database), which is derived mostly from AR proliferative responsive genes in androgen dependent cells. In addition, we identified four top ranking co-occupancy transcription factors in the AR binding regions, which include TEF1 (Transcriptional enhancer factor), GATA (GATA transcription factors), OCT (octamer transcription factors) and PU1 (PU.1 transcription factor).Our data provide a valuable data set in understanding the molecular basis for growth inhibition response program of the AR in prostate cancer cells, which can be exploited for developing novel prostate cancer therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2118922086,"Background An adult zebrafish heart possesses a high capacity of regeneration. However, it has been unclear whether and how myocyte hyperplasia contributes to cardiac remodeling in response to biomechanical stress and whether myocyte hypertrophy exists in the zebrafish. To address these questions, we characterized the zebrafish mutant tr265/tr265, whose Band 3 mutation disrupts erythrocyte formation and results in anemia. Although Band 3 does not express and function in the heart, the chronic anemia imposes a sequential biomechanical stress towards the heart. Methodology/Principal Findings Hearts of the tr265/tr265 Danio rerio mutant become larger than those of the sibling by week 4 post fertilization and gradually exhibit characteristics of human cardiomyopathy, such as muscular disarray, re-activated fetal gene expression, and severe arrhythmia. At the cellular level, we found both increased individual cardiomyocyte size and increased myocyte proliferation can be detected in week 4 to week 12 tr265/tr265 fish. Interestingly, all tr265/tr265 fish that survive after week-12 have many more cardiomyocytes of smaller size than those in the sibling, suggesting that myocyte hyperplasia allows the long-term survival of these fish. We also show the cardiac hypertrophy process can be recapitulated in wild-type fish using the anemia-inducing drug phenylhydrazine (PHZ). Conclusions/Significance The anemia-induced cardiac hypertrophy models reported here are the first adult zebrafish cardiac hypertrophy models characterized. Unlike mammalian models, both cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia contribute to the cardiac remodeling process in these models, thus allowing the effects of cardiomyocyte hyperplasia on cardiac remodeling to be studied. However, since anemia can induce effects on the heart other than biomechanical, non-anemic zebrafish cardiac hypertrophy models shall be generated and characterized."
https://openalex.org/W2047923175,"Signaling through the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) is important for the homeostasis of naïve and memory CD4(+) T cells. The significance of TCR signaling in regulatory T (Treg) cells has not been systematically addressed. Using an Ox40-cre allele that is prominently expressed in Treg cells, and a conditional null allele of the gene encoding p56(Lck), we have examined the importance of TCR signaling in Treg cells. Inactivation of p56(Lck) resulted in abnormal Treg homeostasis characterized by impaired turnover, preferential redistribution to the lymph nodes, loss of suppressive function, and striking changes in gene expression. Abnormal Treg cell homeostasis and function did not reflect the involvement of p56(Lck) in CD4 function because these effects were not observed when CD4 expression was inactivated by Ox40-cre.The results make clear multiple aspects of Treg cell homeostasis and phenotype that are dependent on a sustained capacity to signal through the TCR."

Few studies have been performed specifically for B2 MβL carbapenemases yet (17Simona F. Magistrato A. Vera D.M. Garau G. Vila A.J. Carloni P.

The mechanistic hypotheses proposed so far are based on the x-ray structure of B2 enzyme CphA from Aeromonas hydrophila in complex with a biapenem (Bia) derivative (15Garau G. Bebrone C. Anne C. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank entry 1X8I; supplemental Figs. S5 and S6). In this structure Asp120, Cys221, His263, and a Bia derivative carboxylate oxygen (O2 in the top panel of Fig. 1, and in supplemental Fig. S5) bind to the metal ion in the Zn2 site. Based on this structure, Garau et al. (15Garau G. Bebrone C. Anne C. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) proposed that Bia acts as the fourth coordinated ligand of the metal ion in the Henry-Michaelis complex (called ES1 in top panel of Fig. 1). Within this proposal, a water molecule (Wat1 in Fig. 1) activated by a general base (His118 or Asp120) (15Garau G. Bebrone C. Anne C. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) would perform a nucleophilic attack to the substrate (C-7 at Bia). The resulting intermediate (Int) would subsequently rearrange by a rotation of the C-5–C-6 bond (path I in top panel of Fig. 1), forming the adduct as found in the x-ray structure (15Garau G. Bebrone C. Anne C. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the second step of the reaction, a second water molecule (Fig. 1, Wat2), coming from the bulk solvent, would protonate the β-lactam nitrogen with subsequent cleavage of the β-lactam ring at the N-1–C-7 bond. Theoretical calculations performed at the self-consistent charge density functional tight binding level of theory (29Elstner M. Porezag D. Jungnickel G. Elsner J. Haugk M. Frauenheim T. Suhai S. Seifert G. Phys. Rev. B. 1998; 58: 7260-7268Crossref Scopus (3228) Google Scholar) were employed to describe the postulated first step of the reaction, identifying Asp120 as general base (27Xu D. Zhou Y. Xie D. Guo H. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 6679-6689Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Xu D. Xie D. Guo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8740-8747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The calculated free energy barrier is consistent with experimental data (15Garau G. Bebrone C. Anne C. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) in the hypothesis that such a step is the rate-limiting of the enzymatic cycle. The authors speculated that the β-lactam N-1 would accept a proton directly from Asp120 (path II in top panel of Fig. 1) with consequent breaking of the C–N bond. However, this hypothesis is not consistent with experimental studies by Crowder and co-workers (30Sharma N.P. Hajdin C. Chandrasekar S. Bennett B. Yang K.W. Crowder M.W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10729-10738Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), who have shown that the reaction catalyzed by the B2 MβL ImiS from Aeromonas veronii bv. Sobria is characterized by a rate-determining proton transfer step. In addition, our recent molecular simulation study (17Simona F. Magistrato A. Vera D.M. Garau G. Vila A.J. Carloni P. Proteins. 2007; 69: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) pointed to the existence of an alternative conformation of the Henry-Michaelis complex, in which a water molecule replaces Bia substrate as the fourth zinc ligand (ES2 complex in the bottom panel of Fig. 1), similar to the reactant state found in B1 MβLs (21Dal Peraro M. Llarrull L.I. Rothlisberger U. Vila A.J. Carloni P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 12661-12668Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Dal Peraro M. Vila A.J. Carloni P. Klein M.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 2808-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We perform hybrid Car-Parrinello quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations of the whole hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by CphA, using as starting reactants both the complex with a single active water (ES1) and the conformation with two water molecules in the catalytic pocket (17Simona F. Magistrato A. Vera D.M. Garau G. Vila A.J. Carloni P. Proteins. 2007; 69: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our calculations do not support the previously proposed mechanisms by Xu et al. (28Xu D. Xie D. Guo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8740-8747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) based on ES1 state, because the second step of the reaction turns out to be associated with an activation free energy barrier larger than the experimental data. Instead, the catalytic mechanism derived from the presence of two water molecules at the active pocket in the reactant state is associated with a free energy of activation consistent with experiments (15Garau G. Bebrone C. Anne C. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and with the findings of Crowder and co-workers (30Sharma N.P. Hajdin C. Chandrasekar S. Bennett B. Yang K.W. Crowder M.W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10729-10738Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) on ImiS MβL. Importantly, the reaction occurs via a single-step mechanism, through the activation of a second catalytic water molecule in the active pocket. This result points in turn to functional similarities between B2 and B1 MβL species, in which the conserved zinc metal at the second binding site is positioned to promote a water-mediated reaction mechanism (18Suárez D.

Hybrid Car-Parrinello QM/MM calculations (31Carloni P. Rothlisberger U. Parrinello M. Acc. Chem.

Magistrato A. Vera D.M. Garau G. Vila A.J. Carloni P. Proteins. 2007; 69: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These initial structures feature one or two water molecules in the zinc-binding pocket, respectively (Fig. 1). In particular, ES1 conformation is the same as that proposed in Refs. 27Xu D. Zhou Y.

As discussed above, ES2 conformation differs from ES1 by the presence of a second water molecule, which links the zinc metal and the carboxylate moiety of Bia β-lactam (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S4). The atoms treated at the QM level of theory include His118 and His263 imidazole rings (cut at the Cγ), Asp120 and Cys221 (cut at the Cβ), the reactive part of the biapenem that is its backbone, and part of its hydroxyethyl substituent at the 6 position (Bia) (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S3), catalytic water (Wat1), and, for ES2, the additional second water Wat2 (giving a QM box including 59 and 61 atoms, respectively; supplemental Fig. S3).

The estimated activation free energy in our scheme should be considered, approximated; this is due to several factors: the still limited sampling accessible to current density-functional theory (DFT)/MM MD calculations, the well known limitations of the current GGA exchange-correlation functionals, and the choice of a one-dimensional RC as a first approximation of the real, unknown RC (42Piana S.

All of the substrate-enzyme interactions were maintained during the QM/MM simulations. In particular, the substrate interacts with Val67 and Lys224 (supplemental Table S1), in agreement with mutagenesis studies (15Garau G. Bebrone C. Anne C. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 47Bebrone C. Anne C. Kerff F. Garau G. De Vriendt K. Lantin R. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J. Dideberg O. Frère J.M. Galleni M.

However, the carboxylate-zinc bond assumed in ES1, which is a key facet of this conformation (15Garau G. Bebrone C. Anne C. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 28Xu D. Xie D. Guo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8740-8747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), was readily disrupted during simulations (see O-2 at Bia-zinc distance evolution in supplemental Table S1). This might be a consequence of the salt bridge formed between the substrate and Lys224 (supplemental Fig. S3). As a result, Wat1 enters the coordination sphere of the zinc ion, resulting in a distorted tetrahedral geometry of the metal center (supplemental Table S1). Minimization calculations of the atom described at the QM level of theory (i.e. gas phase calculations) turned out to describe a direct binding of the Bia carboxylate group to the metal, a result similar to those reported in (28Xu D. Xie D. Guo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8740-8747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), in which a different QM/MM set-up was used. Thus, several effects, including the mobility of Lys224, the presence of the protein frame, and temperature effects are for a proper modeling of the correct conformation of the Henri-Michaelis complex. The distance between the oxygen of the nucleophilic water molecule, Wat1, and the C-7 β-lactam carbon (dO–C-7) was selected as RC (see under “Computational Methods”). This choice is similar to those used in other studies (21Dal Peraro M. Llarrull L.I. Rothlisberger U. Vila A.J. Carloni P. J. Am. Chem.

The coordination sphere of the zinc ion in ES1 was maintained until TS1 was reached; then the polyhedron was subsequently modified because of the simultaneous occurrence of several events (Fig. 2): (i) Bia carboxylate and the β-lactam nitrogen N-1 entered the ligand shell of zinc; (ii) Asp120 and Wat1 detached from the metal ion; (iii) the catalytic Wat1 was deprotonated by Asp120, becoming an activated hydroxide; and (iv) the β-lactam C–N bond weakened, as evidenced by the lengthening of the C–N bond from 1.5 to 1.7 Å (Fig. 2, middle panel).

https://openalex.org/W2010161862,"Background Patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) require significantly different durations of therapy and achieve substantially different sustained virologic response rates to interferon-based therapies, depending on the HCV genotype with which they are infected. There currently exists no systematic framework that explains these genotype-specific response rates. Since humans are the only known natural hosts for HCV–a virus that is at least hundreds of years old–one possibility is that over the time frame of this relationship, HCV accumulated adaptive mutations that confer increasing resistance to the human immune system. Given that interferon therapy functions by triggering an immune response, we hypothesized that clinical response rates are a reflection of viral evolutionary adaptations to the immune system. Methods and Findings We have performed the first phylogenetic analysis to include all available full-length HCV genomic sequences (n = 345). This resulted in a new cladogram of HCV. This tree establishes for the first time the relative evolutionary ages of the major HCV genotypes. The outcome data from prospective clinical trials that studied interferon and ribavirin therapy was then mapped onto this new tree. This mapping revealed a correlation between genotype-specific responses to therapy and respective genotype age. This correlation allows us to predict that genotypes 5 and 6, for which there currently are no published prospective trials, will likely have intermediate response rates, similar to genotype 3. Ancestral protein sequence reconstruction was also performed, which identified the HCV proteins E2 and NS5A as potential determinants of genotype-specific clinical outcome. Biochemical studies have independently identified these same two proteins as having genotype-specific abilities to inhibit the innate immune factor double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). Conclusion An evolutionary analysis of all available HCV genomes supports the hypothesis that immune selection was a significant driving force in the divergence of the major HCV genotypes and that viral factors that acquired the ability to inhibit the immune response may play a role in determining genotype-specific response rates to interferon therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2075750452,"In 2005, the first robust hepatitis C virus (HCV) infectious cell culture system was developed based on the HCV genotype 2a JFH-1 molecular clone and the human-derived hepatoma cell line Huh7. Although much effort has been made to dissect and expand the repertoire of JFH-1-derived clones, less attention has been given to the host cell despite the intriguing facts that thus far only Huh7 cells have been found to be highly permissive for HCV infection and furthermore only a limited number of Huh7 cell lines/stocks appear to be fully permissive. As such, we compiled a panel of Huh7 lines from disparate sources and evaluated their permissiveness for HCV infection. We found that although Huh7 lines from different laboratories do vary in morphology and cell growth, the majority (8 out of 9) were highly permissive for infection, as demonstrated by robust HCV RNA and de novo infectious virion production following infection. While HCV RNA levels achieved in the 8 permissive cell lines were relatively equivalent, three Huh7 lines demonstrated higher infectious virion production suggesting these cell lines more efficiently support post-replication event(s) in the viral life cycle. Consistent with previous studies, the single Huh7 line found to be relatively resistant to infection demonstrated a block in HCV entry. These studies not only suggest that the majority of Huh7 cell lines in different laboratories are in fact highly permissive for HCV infection, but also identify phenotypically distinct Huh7 lines, which may facilitate studies investigating the cellular determinants of HCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2116168075,"T cell receptor (TCR) engagement leads to formation of signaling microclusters and induction of rapid and dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton, although the exact mechanism by which the TCR initiates actin polymerization is incompletely understood. The Vav family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) has been implicated in generation of TCR signals and immune synapse formation, however, it is currently not known if Vav's GEF activity is required in T cell activation by the TCR in general, and in actin polymerization downstream of the TCR in particular.Here, we report that Vav1 assembles into signaling microclusters at TCR contact sites and is critical for TCR-initiated actin polymerization. Surprisingly, Vav1 functions in TCR signaling and Ca(++) mobilization via a mechanism that does not appear to strictly depend on the intrinsic GEF activity.We propose here a model in which Vav functions primarily as a tyrosine phosphorylated linker-protein for TCR activation of T cells. Our results indicate that, contrary to expectations based on previously published studies including from our own laboratory, pharmacological inhibition of Vav1's intrinsic GEF activity may not be an effective strategy for T cell-directed immunosuppressive therapy."

We used four vaccine platforms for prime or boost vaccinations: plasmids (DNA), alphavirus replicons (VRP), attenuated adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad), or attenuated poxvirus (Pox). These four platforms combined to produce five different prime/boost vaccine regimens: Pox alone, VRP/Pox, VRP/Ad, Ad/Pox, and DNA/Pox. Five rhesus monkeys were immunized with each regimen, and five Control monkeys received a mock vaccination. The time to complete vaccinations was 420 days. All monkeys were challenged twice with 100 P. knowlesi sporozoites given IV. The first challenge was given 12 days after the last vaccination, and the monkeys receiving the DNA/Pox vaccine were the best protected, with 3/5 monkeys sterilely protected and 1/5 monkeys that self-cured its parasitemia. There was no protection in monkeys that received Pox malaria vaccine alone without previous priming. The second sporozoite challenge was given 4 months after the first. All 4 monkeys that were protected in the first challenge developed malaria in the second challenge. DNA, VRP and Ad5 vaccines all primed monkeys for strong immune responses after the Pox boost.

https://openalex.org/W2057632749,"Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors have been considered potential targets for the therapy of experimental parkinsonism. One hypothetical advantage associated with the use of mGlu receptor ligands is the lack of the adverse effects typically induced by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists, such as sedation, ataxia, and severe learning impairment. Low doses of the mGlu2/3 metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, LY379268 (0.25-3 mg/kg, i.p.) increased glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) mRNA and protein levels in the mouse brain, as assessed by in situ hybridization, real-time PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. This increase was prominent in the striatum, but was also observed in the cerebral cortex. GDNF mRNA levels peaked at 3 h and declined afterwards, whereas GDNF protein levels progressively increased from 24 to 72 h following LY379268 injection. The action of LY379268 was abrogated by the mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist, LY341495 (1 mg/kg, i.p.), and was lost in mGlu3 receptor knockout mice, but not in mGlu2 receptor knockout mice. In pure cultures of striatal neurons, the increase in GDNF induced by LY379268 required the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase pathways, as shown by the use of specific inhibitors of the two pathways. Both in vivo and in vitro studies led to the conclusion that neurons were the only source of GDNF in response to mGlu3 receptor activation. Remarkably, acute or repeated injections of LY379268 at doses that enhanced striatal GDNF levels (0.25 or 3 mg/kg, i.p.) were highly protective against nigro-striatal damage induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine in mice, as assessed by stereological counting of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. We speculate that selective mGlu3 receptor agonists or enhancers are potential candidates as neuroprotective agents in Parkinson's disease, and their use might circumvent the limitations associated with the administration of exogenous GDNF."
https://openalex.org/W2144549121,"For the majority of microbial eukaryotes (protists, algae), there is no clearly superior species concept that is consistently applied. In the absence of a practical biological species concept, most species and genus level delineations have historically been based on morphology, which may lead to an underestimate of the diversity of microbial eukaryotes. Indeed, a growing body of molecular evidence, such as barcoding surveys, is beginning to support the conclusion that significant cryptic species diversity exists. This underestimate of diversity appears to be due to a combination of using morphology as the sole basis for assessing diversity and our inability to culture the vast majority of microbial life. Here we have used molecular markers to assess the species delineations in two related but morphologically distinct genera of uncultivated symbionts found in the hindgut of termites.Using single-cell isolation and environmental PCR, we have used a barcoding approach to characterize the diversity of Coronympha and Metacoronympha symbionts in four species of Incisitermes termites, which were also examined using scanning electron microscopy and light microcopy. Despite the fact that these genera are significantly different in morphological complexity and structural organisation, we find they are two life history stages of the same species. At the same time, we show that the symbionts from different termite hosts show an equal or greater level of sequence diversity than do the hosts, despite the fact that the symbionts are all classified as one species.The morphological information used to describe the diversity of these microbial symbionts is misleading at both the genus and species levels, and led to an underestimate of species level diversity as well as an overestimate of genus level diversity. The genus 'Metacoronympha' is invalid and appears to be a life history stage of Coronympha, while the single recognized species of Coronympha octonaria inhabiting these four termites is better described as four distinct species."
https://openalex.org/W2024086258,"Mothers that mate with multiple males often produce higher quality offspring than mothers that mate with a single male. By engaging in polyandry, mothers may increase their chances of mating with a compatible male or promote sperm competition -- both of which act to increase maternal fitness via the biasing of the paternity of offspring. Surprisingly, mating with multiple males, can carry benefits without biasing paternity and may be due simply to differences in genetic diversity between monandrous and polyandrous clutches but role of genetic diversity effects in driving the benefits of polyandry remains poorly tested. Disentangling indirect, genetic benefits from genetic diversity effects is challenging but crucial if we are to understand the selection pressures acting to promote polyandry.Here, we examine the post-fertilisation benefits of accessing the sperm of multiple males in an externally fertilising polychaete worm. Accessing the sperm of multiple males increases offspring performance but this benefit was driven entirely by genetic diversity effects and not by the biasing of paternity at fertilisation.Previous studies on polyandry should be interpreted cautiously as genetic diversity effects alone can explain the benefits of polyandry yet these diversity effects may be difficult to disentangle from other mechanisms. We suggest that future studies use a modified experimental design in order to discriminate between genetic diversity effects and indirect, genetic benefits."
https://openalex.org/W1977349700,"How much we desire a meal depends on both the constituent foods and how hungry we are, though not every meal becomes more desirable with increasing hunger. The brain therefore needs to be able to integrate hunger and meal properties to compute the correct incentive value of a meal. The present study investigated the functional role of the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex in mediating hunger and dish attractiveness. Furthermore, it explored neural responses to dish descriptions particularly susceptible to value-increase following fasting. We instructed participants to rate how much they wanted food menu items while they were either hungry or sated, and compared the rating differences in these states. Our results point to the representation of food value in the amygdala, and to an integration of attractiveness with hunger level in the orbitofrontal cortex. Dishes particularly desirable during hunger activated the thalamus and the insula. Our results specify the functions of evaluative structures in the context of food attractiveness, and point to a complex neural representation of dish qualities which contribute to state-dependent value."
https://openalex.org/W2111097135,"Background Lévy flights are random walks, the step lengths of which come from probability distributions with heavy power-law tails, such that clusters of short steps are connected by rare long steps. Lévy walks maximise search efficiency of mobile foragers. Recently, several studies raised some concerns about the reliability of the statistical analysis used in previous analyses. Further, it is unclear whether Lévy walks represent adaptive strategies or emergent properties determined by the interaction between foragers and resource distribution. Thus two fundamental questions still need to be addressed: the presence of Lévy walks in the wild and whether or not they represent a form of adaptive behaviour. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied 235 paths of solitary and clustered (i.e. foraging in group) fallow deer (Dama dama), exploiting the same pasture. We used maximum likelihood estimation for discriminating between a power-tailed distribution and the exponential alternative and rank/frequency plots to discriminate between Lévy walks and composite Brownian walks. We showed that solitary deer perform Lévy searches, while clustered animals did not adopt that strategy. Conclusion/Significance Our demonstration of the presence of Lévy walks is, at our knowledge, the first available which adopts up-to-date statistical methodologies in a terrestrial mammal. Comparing solitary and clustered deer, we concluded that the Lévy walks of solitary deer represent an adaptation maximising encounter rates with forage resources and not an epiphenomenon induced by a peculiar food distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2063909509,"Biotic stress may operate in concert with physical environmental conditions to limit or facilitate invasion processes while altering competitive interactions between invaders and native species. Here, we examine how endolithic parasitism of an invasive and an indigenous mussel species acts in synergy with abiotic conditions of the habitat. Our results show that the invasive Mytilus galloprovincialis is more infested than the native Perna perna and this difference is probably due to the greater thickness of the protective outer-layer of the shell of the indigenous species. Higher abrasion due to waves on the open coast could account for dissimilarities in degree of infestation between bays and the more wave-exposed open coast. Also micro-scale variations of light affected the level of endolithic parasitism, which was more intense at non-shaded sites. The higher levels of endolithic parasitism in Mytilus mirrored greater mortality rates attributed to parasitism in this species. Condition index, attachment strength and shell strength of both species were negatively affected by the parasites suggesting an energy trade-off between the need to repair the damaged shell and the other physiological parameters. We suggest that, because it has a lower attachment strength and a thinner shell, the invasiveness of M. galloprovincialis will be limited at sun and wave exposed locations where endolithic activity, shell scouring and risk of dislodgement are high. These results underline the crucial role of physical environment in regulating biotic stress, and how these physical-biological interactions may explain site-to-site variability of competitive balances between invasive and indigenous species."
https://openalex.org/W2095357998,"Bacterial species utilize a vast repertoire of surface structures to interact with their surroundings and employ a number of strategies to reconfigure the cellular envelope according to specific stimuli. Gram-positive bacteria, exemplified by Streptomyces and Bacillus species, control production of some exposed molecules by importing oligopeptide signals via permeases (Opp). Such oligopeptides modulate intracellular signaling pathways. In this work, we functionally characterized an Opp of the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and propose its reannotation. Using genome-wide transcriptional profiling, we found that Opp was required to modulate (fold-change ranging from -3.5 to 2.0) the expression of several genes, most of them encoding surface-exposed molecules. These included the virulence-associated lipids mycolic acids and phthiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIMs) as well as PE-family proteins. By thin-layer chromatography and MALDI-TOF-MS we confirmed changes in the lipid profile, including an altered accumulation of triacylglycerides and an affected ratio of mycolic acids to PDIMs. An Opp loss of function mutant showed no in vitro growth defect, but had diminished burden during chronic infection and produced a slightly delayed time to death of animals when compared to WT Mtb infection."

We hypothesized that there are correlations between the alteration of ADC and BBB permeability. Rats were subjected to 2 h of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and studied at 3 and 48 h of reperfusion, which are crucial times of BBB opening. BBB permeability and ADC values were measured by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging, respectively. Temporal and spatial analyses of the evolution of BBB permeability and ADC alteration in cortical and subcortical regions were conducted along with the correlation between ADC and BBB permeability data. We found significant increases in BBB leakage and reduction in ADC values between 3 and 48 h of reperfusion. We identified three MR tissue signature models: high Ki and low ADC, high Ki and normal ADC, and normal Ki and low ADC. Over time, areas with normal Ki and low ADC transformed into areas with high Ki. We observed a pattern of lesion evolution where the extent of initial ischemic injury reflected by ADC abnormalities determines vascular integrity. Our results suggest that regions with vasogenic edema alone are not likely to develop low ADC by 48 h and may undergo recovery."

Methodology/Principal Findings In the present work, we sought to explore further this model. However, we found that effective suppression of A3G by combined RNA interference and expression of HIV1 Vif does not relieve the restrictive phenotype of post-activation resting T cells. We also failed to find a correlation between HIV resistance and the presence of A3G in a low molecular complex in primary T cells. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that A3G is unlikely to play a role in the HIV restrictive phenotype of quiescent T lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1973100234,"The increase in the size of the scientific community created an explosion in scientific production. We have analyzed the dynamics of biomedical scientific output during 1957-2007 by applying a bibliometric analysis of the PubMed database using different keywords representing specific biomedical topics. With the assumption that increased scientific interest will result in increased scientific output, we compared the output of specific topics to that of all scientific output. This analysis resulted in three broad categories of topics; those that follow the general trend of all scientific output, those that show highly variable output, and attractive topics which are new and grow explosively. The analysis of the citation impact of the scientific output resulted in a typical longtail distribution: the majority of journals and articles are of very low impact. This distribution has remained unchanged since 1957, although the interests of scientists must have shifted in this period. We therefore analyzed the distribution of articles in top journals and lower impact journals over time for the attractive topics. Novelty is rewarded by publication in top journals. Over time more articles are published in low impact journals progressively creating the longtail distribution, signifying acceptance of the topic by the community. There can be a gap of years between novelty and acceptance. Within topics temporary novelty is created with new subtopics. In conclusion, the longtail distribution is the foundation of the scientific output of the scientific community and can be used to examine different aspects of science practice."
https://openalex.org/W2007682013,"Merkel cells (MCs) are involved in mechanoreception, but several lines of evidence suggest that they may also participate in skin disorders through the release of neuropeptides and hormones. In addition, MC hyperplasias have been reported in inflammatory skin diseases. However, neither proliferation nor reactions to the epidermal environment have been demonstrated. We established a culture model enriched in swine MCs to analyze their proliferative capability and to discover MC survival factors and modulators of MC neuroendocrine properties. In culture, MCs reacted to bFGF by extending outgrowths. Conversely, neurotrophins failed to induce cell spreading, suggesting that they do not act as a growth factor for MCs. For the first time, we provide evidence of proliferation in culture through Ki-67 immunoreactivity. We also found that MCs reacted to histamine or activation of the proton gated/osmoreceptor TRPV4 by releasing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Since VIP is involved in many pathophysiological processes, its release suggests a putative regulatory role for MCs in skin disorders. Moreover, in contrast to mechanotransduction, neuropeptide exocytosis was Ca(2+)-independent, as inhibition of Ca(2+) channels or culture in the absence of Ca(2+) failed to decrease the amount of VIP released. We conclude that neuropeptide release and neurotransmitter exocytosis may be two distinct pathways that are differentially regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2103282924,"Obesity results from the dysregulation of energy balance throughout the entire body. Although the ubiquitin system participates in many cellular pro- cesses, its contribution to the balance of energy in the body remains poorly understood. Here, we show that ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCH)-L3, one of the deubiquitinating enzymes, contributes to the regulation of metabolism. Uchl3−/− mice displayed a reduction of adipose tissue mass and were protected against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Uchl3−/− mice given both a normal chow and an HFD had an increased whole-body energy expenditure ac- counting for the reduction of adipose tissue mass. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in skeletal muscle has been reported to increase fatty acid β-oxidation, leading to the elevation of the whole-body energy expenditure. Consistently, increased activation of AMPK and fatty acid β-oxidation was observed in skeletal muscle of Uchl3−/− mice. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from Uchl3−/− mice also showed increased activation of AMPK, indicating that UCH-L3 is involved in a cell-autonomous down-regulation of AMPK. These results suggest a role for UCH-L3 in the regulation of AMPK activity and whole-body energy metabolism.—Setsuie, R., Suzuki, M., Kabuta, T., Fu- jita, H., Miura, S., Ichihara, N., Yamada, D., Wang, Y.-L., Ezaki, O., Suzuki, Y., Wada, K.

Protein-protein interactions indicated that it exists in complex with Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and its anchoring protein αKAP. Confocal imaging of isolated cardiomyocytes revealed the colocalization of CAMKII and αKAP with SERCA2a at the SR. Deletion analysis indicated that SERCA2a and CaMKII bind to different regions in the association domain of αKAP but not with each other. Although deletion of the putative N-terminal hydrophobic amino acid stretch in αKAP prevented its membrane targeting, it did not influence binding to SERCA2a or CaMKII. Both CaMKIIδC and the novel CaMKIIβ4 isoforms were found to exist in complex with αKAP and SERCA2a at the SR and were able to phosphorylate Thr-17 on phospholamban (PLN), an accessory subunit and known regulator of SERCA2a activity. Interestingly, the presence of αKAP was also found to significantly modulate the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of Thr-17 on PLN.

Further, studies suggest that CaMKIIβ4 can recruit the glycolytic machinery to the SR membrane in cardiac and skeletal muscle and potentially serve to spatially modulate the supply of ATP for the calcium transport process (13Singh P.

In view of the emerging concept of spatial and temporal control of signal transduction through kinase-anchoring proteins, we investigated further the role of αKAP at the SR membrane and found that it directly interacts with the calcium ATPase and serves to recruit CaMKII isoforms and modulate the phosphorylation of PLN at Thr-17, which is known to critically regulate calcium uptake and muscle relaxation (18Mattiazzi A. Mundiña-Weilenmann C. Guoxiang C. Vittone L. Kranias E. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 68: 366-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We propose a model in which αKAP would serve to modulate PLN phosphorylation and integrate the spatial and temporal control on calcium transport through direct binding to the calcium ATPase on the one hand and recruitment of CaMKII activity on the other. The cloning of CaMKIIβ4 and αKAP from myocardium has been described previously (14Singh P. Leddy J.J. Chatzis G.J. Salih M. Tuana B.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 270: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These constructs were subcloned in frame either into pcDNA3-six-Myc, pcDNA3-GFP, or pGEX-2TK. SERCA2a, CaMKIIδC, and PLN were cloned by reverse transcription-PCR. In brief, total RNA was extracted from a mouse heart using the Tripure isolation kit (Roche Applied Science). First strand cDNA was obtained using oligo(dT) primer and reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Specific primers were designed for SERCA2a, CaMKIIδC, and phospholamban. PCR was performed using cDNA as a template and Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen). The PCR products were cloned into either pcDNA3-six-Myc, pcDNA3-GFP, or pGEX-2TK and sequenced by an automated ABI sequencer using M13 and T7 sequencing primers, and sequences were analyzed with Seqaid II (University of Kansas) and BLAST. HeLa cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection was performed with FuGENE-HD (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primary culture of mouse cardiomyocytes was carried out following the isolation procedure described (19Bkaily G. Pothier P. D'Orléans-Juste P. Simaan M. Jacques D. Jaalouk D. Belzile F. Hassan G. Boutin C. Haddad G. Neugebauer W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 172: 171-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Hearts from neonatal mice were washed with suspension minimum essential medium (Invitrogen), sliced into small pieces with scissors, and transferred into a cell dispenser containing 0.1% trypsin at 37 °C. Enzymatic treatment was allowed for 30 min, and the yielded cells were spun down and collected in Hanks minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Enzymatic digestion was repeated three more times, and isolated cells were cultured on dishes. After 50 min of plating, the non-adherent cells, mostly consisting of cardiomyocytes, were transferred onto new dishes, and this procedure was repeated three more times to enrich for cardiomyocytes. Escherichia coli BL21 containing recombinant proteins were shaken in a special medium (Peptone 20, yeast extract 10, and NaCl, 7 g/liter) at 37 °C. When the A595 reached 0.5, the temperature was cooled to 28 °C, and cells were induced by 0.1 mm 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and maintained at 28 °C for 4 h. Then cells were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Debris was removed by centrifugation, and supernatant was saved. The fusion proteins were isolated on glutathione-Sepharose beads 4B (GE Healthcare) by incubating the lysate for 60 min and then washed four times with the same buffer. Mouse hearts were homogenized with TBS buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). The homogenate was centrifuged at 7500 × g for 20 min, and supernatant was transferred to new tubes and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and considered as the crude SR fraction. The latter was solubilized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 0.8% CHAPS for 2 h at 4 °C and centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was retained as solubilized SR. For GST pull-down assays, GST alone and GST-αKAP fusion proteins (10 μg) were incubated with solubilized SR fraction (500 μg) in 1 ml of TBS buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times in TBS buffer, 2× gel loading buffer was added, and bound proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE. For isolation of CaM-binding proteins, detergent-solubilized SR fraction (500 μg) was applied to a CaM-Sepharose column in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 and then washed with four volumes of buffer before elution with 5 mm EGTA in the same buffer but without CaCl2 (20Tuana B.S. MacLennan D.H. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Protein samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted with different antibodies or stained with Coomassie Blue or silver stain to visualize protein bands that were further sequenced by liquid chromatography-MS/MS analysis (LTQ) at the Proteomics Resource Centre at the University of Ottawa. Protein samples were also analyzed by MALDI-TOF techniques at the proteomics facility at Queens University. Cells transfected with different cDNA expression constructs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline. These were incubated with anti-Myc antibody (Sigma) for 2 h, washed four times, and then incubated with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 594; Invitrogen) for 40 min, washed four times, and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium. The cells were observed under a Zeiss LSM 500 confocal laser-scanning system attached to a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss). Cardiomyocytes were fixed in a similar manner as above; immunostained with anti-CaMKIIβ, anti-αKAP, and anti-SERCA2a antibodies; and analyzed by confocal microscopy. IP assay was carried out using c-Myc-agarose (catalog number A7470; Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells transfected in a 10-cm culture dish were scraped and lysed in TBS buffer. The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was collected, and protein was measured by a Bradford kit (Bio-Rad). Myc-agarose and IgG-agarose beads (control) were washed four times with TBS buffer, and 250 μg of cell lysate was incubated with 50 μl of washed Myc-agarose beads. The mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C for 60 min, and beads were collected and washed (four times) with 1 ml of cold TBS buffer for 10 min each time. The precipitated proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and immunoblotted with different antibodies as described above. Deletion constructs of αKAP were constructed with PCR using selected primers in which a stop codon (TGA) was introduced at the desired locations of the αKAP sequence. The PCR products generated were inserted into pcDNA3-six-Myc or pcDNA3-GFP and sequenced as described above to confirm identity. Phosphorylation of SERCA2a was carried out by co-transfecting SERCA2a-GFP and αKAP-Myc with either CaMKIIδC-Myc or CaMKIIβ4-Myc. IP reactions were performed with Myc-agarose as described above, and precipitated proteins were incubated in assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovandate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, either 1 mm CaCl2 plus 100 nm calmodulin or 5 mm EGTA, and [γ-32P]ATP (0.4 × 10−5 cpm)) for 2 min at room temperature; the reaction was terminated with 50 μl of SDS gel loading buffer; proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and gel-dried; and phosphoproteins were detected on x-ray films. Phosphorylation of PLN was studied in the presence or absence of purified αKAP-GST (10 μg). In brief, purified GST-PLN (20 μg) was incubated with either GST-CaMKIIδC or GST-CMKIIβ4 (10 μg). The control reactions include GST alone (20 μg) instead of GST-PLN. The mixture of proteins was incubated in the phosphorylation assay buffer (as above except that hot ATP was replaced with cold ATP) for 2 min at 30 °C and then terminated with 50 μl of SDS gel loading buffer. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-CaMKII polyclonal antibody or phospho-PLN antibody (Badrilla, UK) or anti-PLN antibody (Affinity Bioreagent). Previous data have shown that αKAP is a component of the SR membrane in skeletal and cardiac muscle (13Singh P. Salih M. Leddy J.J. Tuana B.S. J. Biol.

In order to define interacting components of αKAP, GST pull-down assays were performed with a detergent-solubilized SR fraction from cardiac muscle. The potential interacting proteins were revealed with Coomassie Blue staining. Characterization of the interacting proteins with respect to molecular mass revealed that αKAP specifically binds polypeptides of ∼110, 86, 83, 74, 71, 52, 34, and 23 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 2). The presence of these polypeptides was not detected in the pull down with GST alone (Fig. 1A, lane 4). Further, recombinant GST-αKAP (Fig. 1A, lane 1) or GST alone (Fig. 1A, lane 3) in TBS buffer also lacked the presence of these polypeptides. The recombinant GST-αKAP appeared as a 47-kDa form (mature form) and a 32-kDa truncated product (lanes 1 and 2), and GST alone appeared as 25 kDa on SDS gels (lanes 3 and 4). In order to identify the specifically bound polypeptides, gel bands were excised and sequenced and analyzed by liquid chromatography-MS/MS. This revealed that αKAP exists in complex with a diverse array of proteins (Table 1), including aralar, aconitase 2, acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, hydroxyacyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase, SERCA2a, CaMKII, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Since CaMKII, αKAP, and SERCA2a are enriched in the SR, we further investigated their potential interactions. The GST pull-down experiments noted above were repeated, and the polypeptides present were probed in immunoblots with an anti-SERCA2a monoclonal antibody, which clearly identified a 110-kDa polypeptide in the GST-αKAP pull-down (Fig. 1B, top, lane 2) and not in the GST-alone pull-down (Fig. 1B, top, lane 4). GST-αKAP (Fig. 1B, top, lane 1) and GST-alone (Fig. 1B, top, lane 3) incubated in TBS buffer showed no reactivity. The immunoblot was stripped and immunostained with anti-GST antibody to define the protein loading (Fig. 1B, bottom).TABLE 1Identity of the αKAP-associated complex in cardiac microsomesProteinMassPeptide matchScoreExpectation scorekDaSERCA2a110196934.1 × 10−7Aconitase 2863011811.0 × 10−7Hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase83277929.2 × 10−8Aralar74176693.1 × 10−8Acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase715110884.2 × 10−8CaM kinase52134233.1 × 10−8Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase34648343.9 × 10−7αKAP23123921.1 × 10−7 Open table in a new tab The CaMKII activity of the SR can be isolated on calmodulin affinity columns (20Tuana B.S. MacLennan D.H. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if SERCA2a, αKAP, and CaMKII exist in a complex, these proteins would co-purify together on CaM-Sepharose. CaM-Sepharose 4B was incubated with detergent-solublized SR and CaM-binding proteins eluted with EGTA, resolved in SDS-PAGE, and silver-stained (20Tuana B.S. MacLennan D.H. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). CaM-Sepharose specifically binds to a multitude of polypeptides of different molecular mass (Fig. 1C, lane 2), and analysis with either MALDI-TOF or liquid chromatography-MS/MS revealed that the ∼450 kDa band was the ryanodine receptor, the 110 kDa band was SERCA2a, the 86 kDa band was 6-phosphofructose kinase, and the 23 kDa band was αKAP (Table 2). Further, immunoblotting of the EGTA-eluted proteins with a polyclonal anti-CaMKII antibody (Fig. 1D, bottom, lane 2) recognized ∼70-, 60-, 52-, 54-, and 23-kDa polypeptides, which we have previously shown to represent the CaMKIIβ4, CaMKIIβ, CaMKIIδ, and αKAP, respectively (13Singh P.

The anti-SERCA2a antibody recognized a 110-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 1D, top, lane 2), further confirming the specific retention of the calcium ATPase on the CaM affinity column. Since both SERCA2a and αKAP lack calmodulin binding motifs (14Singh P. Leddy J.J. Chatzis G.J. Salih M. Tuana B.S. Mol. Cell.

Korczak B. MacLennan D.H. Cell. 1986; 44: 597-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), their retention on the CaM affinity column could only be due to an association with other CaM-binding proteins, such as CaMKII or the ryanodine receptor (20Tuana B.S.

The Sepharose 4B exhibited some nonspecific binding of polypeptides (Fig. 1C, lane 1), but these appeared mostly distinct in terms of molecular mass from those retained specifically on the CaM-Sepharose 4B column and did not exhibit any cross-reactivity with anti-CaMKII or anti-SERCA2a antibodies (Fig. 1D, lane 1).TABLE 2Identity of the calmodulin-associated complex in cardiac SRProteinMassPeptide matchMOWSE ScoreExpectation scorekDaMALDI-TOF analysisRyanodine receptor450342.6 × 107SERCA2a11097.3 × 104Liquid chromatography-MS/MS analysisSERCA2a110505.5 × 10−86-Phosphofructose kinase86300.1 × 10−7αKAP23491.7 × 10−8 Open table in a new tab We further studied the interaction of αKAP with SERCA2a and CaMKIIβ4 by transfection of expression constructs in mammalian cells. In a series of experiments, cDNA of mouse SERCA2a fused to GFP was co-expressed with six-Myc-tagged αKAP in HeLa cells, and IP was carried out on cell lysates with anti-Myc. Western blot analysis with anti-SERCA2a monoclonal antibody revealed that SERCA2a-GFP was detected in the IP reactions of cell lysates containing αKAP-Myc (Fig. 2A, middle, lane 1) and not in the reactions of cell lysates containing control pcDNA3-six-Myc vector (Fig. 2A, middle, lane 2). The top panel in the same figure shows staining with anti-SERCA2a antibody and confirms the relative level of expression of SERCA2a protein in test and control cell lysates (Fig. 2A, top, lanes 1 and 2). Similarly, the bottom panel in the figure shows staining with anti-Myc, which identified the presence of αKAP-Myc in cell lysates (Fig. 2A, bottom, lane 1). The control experiment consisting of pcDNA3-Myc alone (Fig. 2A, bottom, lane 2) does not show any protein band, because of the very small size of the six-Myc tag. The samples from the IP reactions noted above were also immunoblotted with anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2B), which identified the expression of SERCA2a protein and confirmed the data obtained with the anti-SERCA2a antibody. In these sets of experiments, SERCA2a-GFP was only detected in the IP reactions with αKAP-Myc (Fig. 2B, middle, lane 1) and not in control pcDNA3-Myc vector (Fig. 2B, middle, lane 2). The top panel in the figure shows the expression of SERCA2a-GFP in test (Fig. 2B, top, lane 1) and control (Fig. 2B, top, lane 2) cell lysates, as identified with anti-GFP staining. In the bottom panel, anti-CaMKIIα antibodies confirm the expression of αKAP in the cell lysates (Fig. 2B, bottom, lane 1). Notably, SERCA2a-GFP appeared as a doublet in this experiment. The presence of two protein bands for SERCA2a from expression constructs have been previously noted as well (23Kim Y.K. Kim S.J. Yatani A. Huang Y. Castelli G. Vatner D.E. Liu J. Zhang Q. Diaz G.

https://openalex.org/W2056470003,"Background How do people sustain a visual representation of the environment? Currently, many researchers argue that a single visual working memory system sustains non-spatial object information such as colors and shapes. However, previous studies tested visual working memory for two-dimensional objects only. In consequence, the nature of visual working memory for three-dimensional (3D) object representation remains unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, I show that when sustaining information about 3D objects, visual working memory clearly divides into two separate, specialized memory systems, rather than one system, as was previously thought. One memory system gradually accumulates sensory information, forming an increasingly precise view-dependent representation of the scene over the course of several seconds. A second memory system sustains view-invariant representations of 3D objects. The view-dependent memory system has a storage capacity of 3–4 representations and the view-invariant memory system has a storage capacity of 1–2 representations. These systems can operate independently from one another and do not compete for working memory storage resources. Conclusions/Significance These results provide evidence that visual working memory sustains object information in two separate, specialized memory systems. One memory system sustains view-dependent representations of the scene, akin to the view-specific representations that guide place recognition during navigation in humans, rodents and insects. The second memory system sustains view-invariant representations of 3D objects, akin to the object-based representations that underlie object cognition."
https://openalex.org/W1998829813,"Small invertebrate animals, such as nematodes and fruit flies, are increasingly being used to test candidate drugs both for specific therapeutic purposes and for long-term health effects. Some of the protocols used in these experiments feature such experimental design features as lifelong virginity and very low densities. By contrast, the ability of both fruit flies and nematodes to resist stress is frequently correlated with their longevity and other functional measures, suggesting that low-stress assays are not necessarily the only useful protocol for testing the long-term effects of drugs.Here we report an alternative protocol for fruit fly drug-testing that maximizes reproductive opportunities and other types of interaction, with moderately high population densities. We validate this protocol using two types of experimental tests: 1. We show that this protocol detects previously well-established genetic differences between outbred fruit fly populations. 2. We show that this protocol is able to distinguish among the long-term effects of similar types of drugs within two broad categories, stimulants and tranquilizers.Large-scale fly drug testing can be conducted using mixed-sex high-density cage assays. We find that the commonly-used stimulants caffeine and theobromine differ dramatically in their chronic functional effects, theobromine being more benign. Likewise, we find that two generic pharmaceutical tranquilizers, lithium carbonate and valproic acid, differ dramatically in their chronic effects, lithium being more benign. However, these findings do not necessarily apply to human subjects, and we thus do not recommend the use of any one substance over any other."
https://openalex.org/W2116088614,"Zebrafish mutant belladonna (bel) carries a mutation in the lhx2 gene (encoding a Lim domain homeobox transcription factor) that results in a defect in retinotectal axon pathfinding, which can lead to uncrossed optic nerves failing to form an optic chiasm. Here, we report on a novel swimming behavior of the bel mutants, best described as looping. Together with two previously reported oculomotor instabilities that have been related to achiasmatic bel mutants, reversed optokinetic response (OKR) and congenital nystagmus (CN, involuntary conjugate oscillations of both eyes), looping opens a door to study the influence of visual input and eye movements on postural balance. Our result shows that looping correlates perfectly with reversed OKR and CN and is vision-dependent and contrast sensitive. CN precedes looping and the direction of the CN slow phase is predictive of the looping direction, but is absent during looping. Therefore, looping may be triggered by CN in bel. Moreover, looping in wild-type fish can also be evoked by whole-field motion, suggesting that looping in a bel mutant larvae is a result of self-motion perception. In contrary to previous hypotheses, our findings indicate that postural control in vertebrates relies on both direct visual input (afference signal) and eye-movement-related signals (efference copy or reafference signal)."
https://openalex.org/W2052390174,"Microtubules are self-assembling polymers whose dynamics are essential for the normal function of cellular processes including chromosome separation and cytokinesis. Therefore understanding what factors effect microtubule growth is fundamental to our understanding of the control of microtubule based processes. An important factor that determines the status of a microtubule, whether it is growing or shrinking, is the length of the GTP tubulin microtubule cap. Here, we derive a Monte Carlo model of the assembly and disassembly of microtubules. We use thermodynamic laws to reduce the number of parameters of our model and, in particular, we take into account the contribution of water to the entropy of the system. We fit all parameters of the model from published experimental data using the GTP tubulin dimer attachment rate and the lateral and longitudinal binding energies of GTP and GDP tubulin dimers at both ends. Also we calculate and incorporate the GTP hydrolysis rate. We have applied our model and can mimic published experimental data, which formerly suggested a single layer GTP tubulin dimer microtubule cap, to show that these data demonstrate that the GTP cap can fluctuate and can be several microns long."
https://openalex.org/W2067737295,"We performed benchmarks of phylogenetic grammar-based ncRNA gene prediction, experimenting with eight different models of structural evolution and two different programs for genome alignment. We evaluated our models using alignments of twelve Drosophila genomes. We find that ncRNA prediction performance can vary greatly between different gene predictors and subfamilies of ncRNA gene. Our estimates for false positive rates are based on simulations which preserve local islands of conservation; using these simulations, we predict a higher rate of false positives than previous computational ncRNA screens have reported. Using one of the tested prediction grammars, we provide an updated set of ncRNA predictions for D. melanogaster and compare them to previously-published predictions and experimental data. Many of our predictions show correlations with protein-coding genes. We found significant depletion of intergenic predictions near the 3′ end of coding regions and furthermore depletion of predictions in the first intron of protein-coding genes. Some of our predictions are colocated with larger putative unannotated genes: for example, 17 of our predictions showing homology to the RFAM family snoR28 appear in a tandem array on the X chromosome; the 4.5 Kbp spanned by the predicted tandem array is contained within a FlyBase-annotated cDNA."
https://openalex.org/W2007046039,"Background In the cardiovascular system, laminar shear stress (SS) is one of the most important source of endothelial protecting signals. Physical and chemical agents, however, including ionising radiations and anticancer drugs, may injure endothelial cells determining an increase in oxidative stress and genotoxic damage. Whether the SS protective function remains intact in the presence of strong oxidants or DNA damage is currently unclear. Methods and Results To investigate this aspect a series of experiments were performed in which HUVEC were exposed to sub-lethal doses of the radio-mimetic compound Bleomycin (Bleo; 10 µg/ml) which generated free radicals (ROS) without significantly compromising cell survival. Remarkably, the application of a SS of 12 dyne/cm2 did not protect endothelial cells but markedly accelerated apoptosis compared to controls kept in static culture and in the presence of Bleo. Experiments with the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor GW274150 significantly reduced the SS-dependent apoptosis indicating that the production of NO was relevant for this effect. At molecular level, the ataxia-telangectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase, the homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2) and p53 were found activated along a pro-apoptotic signalling pathway while p21waf1,cip1,sdi1 was prevented from its protective action. RNA interference experiments revealed that HIPK2 and p53 were both important for this process, however, only the forced expression p21waf1,cip1,sdi1 fully restored the SS-dependent pro-survival function. Conclusions This study provides the first evidence that, in the presence of genotoxic damage, laminar flow contributes to endothelial toxicity and death and identifies molecular targets potentially relevant in endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease pathogenesis."
