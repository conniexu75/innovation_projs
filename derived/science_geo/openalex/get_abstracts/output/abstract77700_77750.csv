https://openalex.org/W1587804137,"Abstract The citrate cleavage enzyme (EC 4.1.3.8) of rat liver is inhibited by adenosine diphosphate, which appears to compete with adenosine triphosphate. This effect may ensure that fatty acids are produced only when the ATP level is high. The of the adenylate system, defined as (ATP + ½ ADP)/(AMP + ADP + ATP), is proposed as a fundamental metabolic control parameter. Enzymes that utilize ATP and are inhibited by ADP or AMP will yield steep curves of velocity as a function of energy charge (resembling the steep curves of velocity as a function of substrate concentration that are characteristic of many regulatory enzymes) even in the absence of multiple sites and cooperative binding."
https://openalex.org/W1489055368,"Anisomycin (2-p-methoxyphenylmethyl-3-acetoxy-4-hydroxypyrrolidine) inhibits protein synthesis in HeLa cells, rabbit reticulocytes, Saccharomyces fragilis, and cell-free extracts prepared from these sources, but it is inactive against extracts of Escherichia coli. Partial inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in HeLa cells is observed at anisomycin concentrations which produce 95% inhibition of protein synthesis. These effects on protein and DNA synthesis are rapid in onset and reversible. Anisomycin acts on the transfer reaction subsequent to the formation of aminoacyl transfer ribonucleic acid. In the presence of anisomycin, nascent peptide remains attached to polyribosomes. No derivative of anisomycin that was tested showed more than 1% of the inhibitory activity of the parent compound."
https://openalex.org/W1588149841,"Evidence has been obtained that the biosynthesis of a peptidoglycan with particulate enzyme from Staphylococcus aureus or Micrococcus lysodeikticus proceeds by a cyclic mechanism involving two lipid intermediates, as follows (the abbreviation Mur stands for muramyl). UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide + P-phospholipid ⇄ UMP + MurNAc(-pentapeptide)-P-P-phospholipid (1) UDP-GIc-NAc + MurNAc(-pentapeptide)-P-P-phospholipid ⇄ GlcNAc-MurNAc(-pentapeptide)-P-P-phospholipid + UDP (2) GlcNac-MurNAc(-pentapeptide)-P-P-phospholipid + acceptor → GlcNAc-MurNAc(-pentapeptide)-acceptor + P-phospholipid + Pi (3) P-P-phospholipid is assumed to be an intermediate in Reaction 3. Both MurNAc(-pentapeptide)-P-P-phospholipid and Glc-NAc-MurNAc(-pentapeptide)-P-P-phospholipid have been obtained bound to the enzymes, and shown to be intermediates in the reaction cycle. Both of these intermediates have also been isolated from reaction mixtures with particulate enzyme from either organism by n-butyl alcohol extraction followed by purification on diethylaminoethyl cellulose and silicic acid columns. Analyses of GlcNAc-Mur-NAc(-pentapeptide)-P-P-phospholipid from both organisms are presented. Both MurNAc(-pentapeptide)-P-P-phospholipid and Glc-NAc-MurNAc(-pentapeptide)-P-P-phospholipid, isolated with the use of enzyme from M. lysodeikticus, were utilized for peptidoglycan synthesis by the particulate enzyme from this organism. Ristocetin and vancomycin at low concentrations inhibited utilization of GlcNAc-MurNAc(-pentapeptide)-P-P-phospholipid for peptidoglycan synthesis, thus confirming that this reaction is the step in peptidoglycan synthesis which is most sensitive to these antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W1977052740,"Zygotes of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardi occasionally divide mitotically to give rise to stable diploid vegetative strains. As well as by their mode of origin, these strains are distinguished from haploids by cell and nuclear size, DNA content per nucleus, and chromosome number. Diploid strains heterozygous for a variety of mutant genes are phenotypically wild type and mating-type minus. Thus these mutant genes are recessive to their wild-type alleles, and the mating-type-minus is dominant over the mating-type-plus allele."

However, there are clear species differences in the type of extract responded to by previously unfed snakes, even within the same genus. These differences correspond to the normal feeding preferences shown by the various species."

https://openalex.org/W1997586696,"An experiment with goldfish showed the effects of change in amount of reward that are predicted from reinforcement theory. The performance of animals shifted from small to large reward improved gradually to the level of unshifted large-reward controls, while the performance of animals shifted from large to small reward remained at the large-reward level. The difference between these results and those obtained in analogous experiments with the rat suggests that reward functions differently in the instrumental learning of the two animals."
https://openalex.org/W2087314914,"One of five rats given a single subcutaneous injection of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) early in pregnancy appeared to abort early; two delivered stunted stillborn offspring at term, one delivered a littler of seven healthy and one underdeveloped young, and the last one delivered an apparently normal litter. All five matched controls, given saline injections, went to term and delivered healthy litters of 11 to 16 offspring; there were no abortions and no stillbirths. In a replicate experiment, one of five rats given LSD on the 4th day of gestation aborted, two delivered some stillborn offspring, one gave an abnormally small litter of four, and the last one produced an apparently normal litter of ten. All matched controls delivered healthy litters, totaling 66. Some surviving offspring treated with LSD failed to develop as well as control animals. Treatment of five additional rats with LSD late in pregnancy had no obvious effect on the offspring."
https://openalex.org/W1680341609,"Abstract The basic equations for molecular sieve behavior of associating systems are presented in detail. In this analysis equations are derived to describe elution boundaries for which axial dispersion of solute arises as a result of macromolecular interactions. The theory is developed as an extension of de Vault's basic approach to idealized column chromatography, but emphasizes the molecular sieve coefficient as a basic phenomenological transport parameter. By this approach, the partition isotherm for an interacting system of macromolecules is resolved into terms that represent linear isotherms of the individual components. Equations for elution profiles of associating systems are then derived in a convenient form in which the equilibrium constants for interactions among components are related to the corresponding transport coefficients of the individual molecular species. The theory has been formulated on the basis of a model sufficiently general to include isomeric forms for each degree of aggregation. The treatment is therefore applicable to equilibria that include (a) subunit association reactions, including the special case of monomer ⇌ n-mer interactions, (b) isomers that represent different geometric arrangements of subunits, and (c) isomeric states that are reversibly accessible to allosteric oligomers. A brief extension of the analysis is outlined to include the case of linearly concentration-dependent molecular sieve transport coefficients for each of the interacting species."
https://openalex.org/W1968881935,"Ribosomes isolated from the cytoplasmic and chloroplast fractions of Chlamydomonas were characterized in the ultracentrifuge. The cytoplasmic ribosomes belong to the 80S class of ribosomes, and, like animal ribosomes, dissociate to 60, 50, and 40S subunits. However, like the ribosomes of microorganisms, they contain smaller RNA's, 24 and 16S, and require 0.01 mole of magnesium ions per liter for stability. Chloroplast ribosomes are 70S like those of higher plants but are very unstable. A stable 50S subunit has been observed."
https://openalex.org/W1553953650,"Abstract A system has been described for the incorporation of glycine into the peptidoglycan catalyzed by particulate enzymes from Micrococcus lysodeikticus. Glycine incorporation required both of the uridine nucleotides required for peptidoglycan synthesis uridine diphosphate acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide (UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide) and uridine diphosphate acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), as well as adenosine triphosphate. It was independent of addition of supernatant solution or soluble ribonucleic acid. The glycine residue was incorporated into the product in a COOH-terminal position. Since it was not attached to the terminal d-alanine residue of MurNAc-pentapeptide, it must have been attached to the only other available carboxyl group, the α-carboxyl group of glutamic acid. This point of attachment is in agreement with structural studies of the peptidoglycan of this organism. It has been demonstrated that the immediate acceptor of glycine is the lipid, disaccharide(-pentapeptide)-P-P-phospholipid, previously shown to be an intermediate in peptidoglycan synthesis. Some properties of the reaction have been investigated with the isolated lipid intermediate as acceptor in the absence of added uridine nucleotides. Although MurNAc(-pentapeptide)-P-P-phospholipid also accepted glycine, it was not as effective an acceptor as the disaccharide-containing lipid. The 14C-glycine-labeled product of the reaction, disaccharide(-14C-hexapeptide)-P-P-phospholipid, was also isolated and shown to be utilized for peptidoglycan synthesis in the absence of glycine, ATP, or added uridine nucleotides. The arsenolysis of this product in the presence of ADP suggests that ADP and inorganic phosphate are the products of the forward reaction, although their formation could not be measured because of simultaneous ATPase activity."

As shown by beta liquid-scintillation measurement and by autoradiography, the resultant breakdown products did not label DNA, but entered macromolecules, other than nucleic acid, contained in the cytoplasm. Caution should be exercised in using aged tritiated thymidine solutions."
https://openalex.org/W1582510195,"Abstract Factors regulating the rate behavior and substrate specificity of purified cobamide-dependent ribonucleotide reductase of Lactobacillus leichmannii have been examined in detail. Reduction of each of the four common ribonucleoside triphosphates (cytidine triphosphate, uridine triphosphate, adenosine triphosphate, and guanosine triphosphate) is maximally stimulated by a different deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate. These deoxyribonucleotides, conveniently termed effectors, are: deoxyadenosine triphosphate for CTP reduction; deoxycytidine triphosphate for UTP reduction; deoxyguanosine triphosphate for ATP reduction; and thymidine triphosphate for GTP reduction. Only ATP and GTP are actively reduced in the absence of added effector; in both cases, however, reduction is enhanced by prime effector. Deoxyribonucleotides that are not prime effectors for a given reduction may be negative or weakly positive effectors. Effector nucleotides are active at low concentrations (viz. 10-4 m); they are not replaceable by the corresponding diphosphates and monophosphates; and they are in competition with one another for an enzymatic binding site other than the catalytic site. Thus, they are allosteric effectors. Kinetic studies with substrate mixtures suggest the presence of a single catalytic site, but are inconclusive because the reduction product of one substrate (or the substrate itself) may be a positive or negative effector for reduction of the other substrate. Divalent cations (Mg++, Ca++, and Mn++) also have significant stimulatory and inhibitory effects that vary with the substrate, the effector, and the sequence of cation and effector addition. The results indicate that this enzyme, previously shown to be derepressed when folate-free cells are grown in thymine-free medium (and probably repressed by intracellular dTTP), is also subject to a complex network of positive and negative feedback effects in which allosteric effector nucleotides and divalent cations, presumably through modifications of the physical state of the enzyme, determine which ribonucleotides are reduced. It is concluded that these effects may maintain the balance of deoxyribonucleotide synthesis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2002658669,"Free light chains isolated from specifically purified antibody have been shown to bind specific hapten. This proves that part of the binding site does exist on the light chain. The light chains were obtained from antibody directed against the 4-azonaphthalene-1-sulfonate group, and the binding of the simple hapten 4-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate was determined by the fluorescence-enhancement technique. Since this hapten undergoes a striking increase in fluorescence on binding to light chains (and also on binding to specific antibody), the presence of small amounts of bound hapten could be determined, even in the presence of the high concentrations of unbound hapten required because of the low binding constant."

https://openalex.org/W1642063851,"Abstract At neutral pH, the circular dichroism (CD) and optical rotatory dispersion (ORD) of α-crystallin between 200 and 590 mµ are characteristic of the β conformation. The Moffitt parameter b0 value obtained from the ORD between 313 and 589 mµ also indicates the absence of α-helix. Most of the data suggest that the β form may represent from 35 to 63% of the protein polypeptide chain with the remainder in random conformation. α-Crystallin deaggregates to an Mw of approximately 7 x 104 when the pH is raised from 8 to 11.7 (1). The corresponding CD and ORD indicate an increase in random structure as well as the appearance of approximately 5% α-helix. Reaggregation occurs when the pH is returned to pH 8.0 (1). The 216 mµ CD negative band of the β structure reappears and the ORD spectra are also similar to the original preparations although certain small irreversible changes were noted."

https://openalex.org/W2072382790,Three patterns of 6-phosphogluconic dehydrogenase activity were obtained by starch-gel electrophoresis of blood from domestic cats. Genetic analysis indicates control of these patterns by a pair of alleles at an autosomal locus. Presence of three enzymatically active bands in heterozygotes and of single bands in homozygotes is compatible with at least a dimeric structure for the enzyme.
https://openalex.org/W2167684375,"Cycloleucine (1-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid) administration in cancer patients resulted in a reversible marked aminoaciduria consisting predominantly of cystine, ornithine, lysine, and arginine, with only minor elevations of other amino acids. Plasma levels of amino acids were essentially unchanged except for slight decreases in ornithine and lysine. This aminoaciduria is most likely due to a blockage by the drug of the renal tubular reabsorption of cystine, ornithine, lysine, and arginine, resulting in an aminoaciduria of the type seen in cystinuria."

The percentage of the total sialic acid present in the sedimentable fraction obtained from homogenates of cells treated with hydrocortisone is smaller than that of the corresponding fraction of control cells. In addition to N-acetylneuraminic acid, the chromatographic analysis suggests that HeLa S(3) cells probably contain trace amounts of N-glycolylneuraminic acid."

https://openalex.org/W113697370,"Abstract d-Glyceraldehyde-3-14C was synthesized and administered to intact Nicotiana rustica. Degradation of the pyridine moiety of nicotine produced by these plants showed that over half of the incorporated 14C was in position 4 of the pyridine ring, and the remainder of the radioactivity was divided almost equally among carbon atoms 2, 3, and 6. Lack of randomization of the label in positions 4, 5, and 6 indicates that a nonsymmetrical compound condenses with aspartate to form the pyridine ring. Glyceraldehyde-3-14C was incorporated into the pyridine ring with a dilution of about 217 as compared with a dilution of about 300 when 14C-labeled glycerol was used as the precursor. This finding suggests that d-glyceraldehyde may be a more immediate precursor of the pyridine ring than glycerol. Incorporation of 14C into carbon atoms 2 and 3 of the pyridine ring indicates that d-glyceraldehyde is phosphorylated and metabolized through glycolysis to form acetate-2-14C which is then converted to aspartate-2,3-14C through the reactions of the tricarboxylic acid cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1555220423,"Abstract Spectrophotometric studies are presented of the glycylglycine-copper(II) [GG-Cu(II)] system in aqueous solution under conditions in which the ligand is present in great excess (up to 1000:1). In highly basic solution (pH 12 to 13) the spectral absorption maximum changes with increasing ligand concentration from 640 to 540 mµ. The spectral data are interpreted in terms of an equilibrium between two dominant species, and the species responsible for the 540 mµ peak is concluded to be the heretofore unobserved Cu(GG)2-2. Comparison studies under similar conditions for copper complexes of glycine, glycylglycylglycine, and glycylsarcosine are presented and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W180092757,"The interactions of primary, aliphatic amines with the highly purified monoamine oxidase of rabbit serum have been studied. The pH dependence of Michaelis and inhibitor constants supports previous evidence that protonated amines are bound by an unprotonated enzyme group (pKa, 6.2). The competitive inhibition by ammonium chloride is consistent with this mechanism of substrate binding. Methylene residues of n-alkylamines enhance the affinities of these substrates for the enzyme. The kinetic data are consistent with the hypothesis that the active center of the enzyme contains hydrophobic areas and that the interactions of substrate residues with these areas determine maximal velocities as well as affinity constants. Affinity constants determined for a variety of substrates and substrate analogues indicate that substrate groups other than ammonium and hydrocarbon residues may affect substrate binding. The increased affinities of substrates with p-chloro-, p-hydroxy-, and p-methoxyphenyl groups support previous evidence that the active center of the enzyme contains a polar site for interactions involving electronegative substituents. Aliphatic alcohols selectively stimulate the oxidation of certain monoamines by increasing their affinities for the enzyme. Although the stimulation appears to be complicated, the available data are consistent with the simple hypothesis that aliphatic alcohols are bound in a tertiary complex with enzyme and substrate, that alcohol binding depends upon hydrophobic interactions, and that the alcohols increase the effectiveness of the hydrophobic areas of the enzyme for substrate binding."

The enzyme preparation was found to be homogeneous on ultracentrifugation and electrophoresis. The enzymic properties of porcine gastricsin, including optimal pH, hydrolysis of synthetic and protein substrates, milk-clotting activity, and stability in an alkaline solution, were found to be similar to those of the human enzyme. The molecular weight was found to be 32,500.

This enzyme preparation has been separated into its protein and lipid components by extraction with chloroform-methanol (1:1) at -17°. The enzyme protein and phospholipid have been reconstituted in the presence of deoxycholate at low concentrations. The endogenous phospholipid acceptors have been labeled with 32P and then separated from other 32P-phospholipids by thin layer chromatography in several solvents. Two 32-P-phospholipid fractions were separated, each of which could be converted to the 32P-phospholipid intermediate, disaccharide(-pentapeptide)-P-P-phospholipid, in the presence of uridine diphosphate acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide and UDP-acetylglucosamine."
