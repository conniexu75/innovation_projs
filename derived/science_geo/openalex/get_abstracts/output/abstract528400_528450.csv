https://openalex.org/W1798922910,"Friction and wear remain as the primary modes of mechanical energy dissipation in moving mechanical assemblies; thus, it is desirable to minimize friction in a number of applications. We demonstrate that superlubricity can be realized at engineering scale when graphene is used in combination with nanodiamond particles and diamondlike carbon (DLC). Macroscopic superlubricity originates because graphene patches at a sliding interface wrap around nanodiamonds to form nanoscrolls with reduced contact area that slide against the DLC surface, achieving an incommensurate contact and substantially reduced coefficient of friction (~0.004). Atomistic simulations elucidate the overall mechanism and mesoscopic link bridging the nanoscale mechanics and macroscopic experimental observations."

The approach combines the transfer of a productive asset with consumption support, training, and coaching plus savings encouragement and health education and/or services. Results from the implementation of the same basic program, adapted to a wide variety of geographic and institutional contexts and with multiple implementing partners, show statistically significant cost-effective impacts on consumption (fueled mostly by increases in self-employment income) and psychosocial status of the targeted households. The impact on the poor households lasted at least a year after all implementation ended. It is possible to make sustainable improvements in the economic status of the poor with a relatively short-term intervention."

TERT , the gene coding for the enzyme's catalytic subunit, is not expressed in healthy somatic cells, but its expression is reactivated in the majority of human cancers. The resultant high levels of telomerase help cancer cells survive and multiply. Recurrent mutations in the promoter region of TERT are associated with high telomerase levels in multiple cancer types. Bell et al. show that a specific transcription factor called GABP is selectively recruited to the mutant form of the TERT promoter, which activates TERT gene expression Science , this issue p. 1036"

We expressed (G4C2)66 throughout the murine central nervous system by means of somatic brain transgenesis mediated by adeno-associated virus. Brains of 6-month-old mice contained nuclear RNA foci, inclusions of poly(Gly-Pro), poly(Gly-Ala), and poly(Gly-Arg) dipeptide repeat proteins, as well as TDP-43 pathology. These mouse brains also exhibited cortical neuron and cerebellar Purkinje cell loss, astrogliosis, and decreased weight.

Primary piRNAs, generated from transcripts of genomic transposon ""junkyards"" (piRNA clusters), are amplified by the ""ping-pong"" pathway, yielding secondary piRNAs. We report that secondary piRNAs, bound to the PIWI protein Ago3, can initiate primary piRNA production from cleaved transposon RNAs. The first ~26 nucleotides (nt) of each cleaved RNA becomes a secondary piRNA, but the subsequent ~26 nt become the first in a series of phased primary piRNAs that bind Piwi, allowing piRNAs to spread beyond the site of RNA cleavage. The ping-pong pathway increases only the abundance of piRNAs, whereas production of phased primary piRNAs from cleaved transposon RNAs adds sequence diversity to the piRNA pool, allowing adaptation to changes in transposon sequence."

These are processed from single-stranded precursor RNAs by largely unknown mechanisms. Here we show that primary piRNA biogenesis is a 3'-directed and phased process that, in the Drosophila germ line, is initiated by secondary piRNA-guided transcript cleavage. Phasing results from consecutive endonucleolytic cleavages catalyzed by Zucchini, implying coupled formation of 3' and 5' ends of flanking piRNAs. Unexpectedly, Zucchini also participates in 3' end formation of secondary piRNAs. Its function can, however, be bypassed by downstream piRNA-guided precursor cleavages coupled to exonucleolytic trimming. Our data uncover an evolutionarily conserved piRNA biogenesis mechanism in which Zucchini plays a central role in defining piRNA 5' and 3' ends."

Passive administration of anti-tumor antibodies is an important clinical tool for the management of a variety of cancers (Pincetic et al., 2014Pincetic A. Bournazos S. DiLillo D.J. Maamary J.

Med. 2004; 199: 1659-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) or possibly natural killer (NK) cells. Because of this FcγR-mediated mechanism of action, next-generation versions of anti-tumor mAbs that have been Fc-engineered for enhanced engagement of activating hFcγRIIIA are now being used in the clinic or are under investigation (Goede et al., 2014Goede V. Fischer K. Busch R. Engelke A. Eichhorst B. Wendtner C.M. Chagorova T. de la Serna J. Dilhuydy M.S. Illmer T. et al.Obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil in patients with CLL and coexisting conditions.N. Engl. J. Med. 2014; 370: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). However, while ADCC-mediated tumor killing is rapid and relatively short-acting, patients with some malignancies see long-term responses after cessation of antibody therapy; this has prompted the hypothesis that a vaccinal or auto-immunization effect is initiated, in which tumor targeting by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) primes the patient’s immune system to generate an anti-tumor T cell memory response (Cartron et al., 2004Cartron G. Watier H. Golay J. Solal-Celigny P. From the bench to the bedside: ways to improve rituximab efficacy.Blood. 2004; 104: 2635-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been demonstrated that cellular immune responses are generated in both mice and patients treated with anti-HER-2/neu mAb (Park et al., 2010Park S. Jiang Z. Mortenson E.D. Deng L. Radkevich-Brown O. Yang X. Sattar H. Wang Y. Brown N.K.

Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 5133-5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Anti-MUC1 cellular immune responses have also been reported after the use of anti-MUC1 mAb in patients with MUC1+ tumors (de Bono et al., 2004de Bono J.S. Rha S.Y. Stephenson J. Schultes B.C. Monroe P. Eckhardt G.S. Hammond L.A. Whiteside T.L. Nicodemus C.F. Cermak J.M. et al.Phase I trial of a murine antibody to MUC1 in patients with metastatic cancer: evidence for the activation of humoral and cellular antitumor immunity.Ann. Oncol. 2004; 15: 1825-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Evidence in lymphoma patients suggests that a vaccinal effect can be generated by anti-human (h)CD20 mAb immunotherapy (rituximab), since a single course of treatment with mAb can result in long-lasting, durable responses (Cartron et al., 2004Cartron G. Watier H. Golay J. Solal-Celigny P. From the bench to the bedside: ways to improve rituximab efficacy.Blood. 2004; 104: 2635-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In support of this, it has been reported that some patients treated with rituximab developed lymphoma-specific anti-idiotype T cell responses after mAb treatment (Hilchey et al., 2009Hilchey S.P. Hyrien O. Mosmann T.R. Livingstone A.M. Friedberg J.W. Young F. Fisher R.I. Kelleher Jr., R.J. Bankert R.B. Bernstein S.H. Rituximab immunotherapy results in the induction of a lymphoma idiotype-specific T-cell response in patients with follicular lymphoma: support for a “vaccinal effect” of rituximab.Blood. 2009; 113: 3809-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Recent studies in mice have also demonstrated that passive administration of anti-CD20 mAbs can initiate anti-tumor cellular immune responses (Abès et al., 2010Abès R. Gélizé E. Fridman W.H. Teillaud J.L. Long-lasting antitumor protection by anti-CD20 antibody through cellular immune response.Blood. 2010; 116: 926-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore, while the hypothesis of a tumor-specific antibody-induced anti-tumor vaccinal effect has persisted for more than a decade, an experimentally derived mechanistic explanation is lacking. New technologies have enabled the identification of tumor mutational signatures, some common across multiple cancer types while others are restricted to specific malignancies (Alexandrov et al., 2013Alexandrov L.B. Nik-Zainal S. Wedge D.C. Aparicio S.A. Behjati S. Biankin A.V. Bignell G.R. Bolli N. Borg A. Børresen-Dale A.L. et al.Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome InitiativeICGC Breast Cancer ConsortiumICGC MMML-Seq ConsortiumICGC PedBrainSignatures of mutational processes in human cancer.Nature. 2013; 500: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (6221) Google Scholar). Thus, mutation-induced, developmentally restricted, or overexpressed tumor neoantigens are a major target of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients (Fritsch et al., 2014Fritsch E.F. Hacohen N.

Neoantigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been identified, showing that such antigens are indeed processed and presented (Gros et al., 2014Gros A. Robbins P.F. Yao X. Li Y.F. Turcotte S. Tran E. Wunderlich J.R. Mixon A. Farid S. Dudley M.E. et al.PD-1 identifies the patient-specific CD8+ tumor-reactive repertoire infiltrating human tumors.J. Clin.

Oncol. 2013; 31: e439-e442Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Further, new immune-checkpoint blockade therapies function in patients by amplifying neoantigen-specific responses (van Rooij et al., 2013van Rooij N. van Buuren M.M. Philips D. Velds A. Toebes M. Heemskerk B. van Dijk L.J. Behjati S. Hilkmann H. El Atmioui D. et al.Tumor exome analysis reveals neoantigen-specific T-cell reactivity in an ipilimumab-responsive melanoma.J. Clin. Oncol. 2013; 31: e439-e442Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). However, although studies analyzing antibody responses to tumor neoantigens are lacking, antibody:antigen immune complexes can stimulate cellular immunity by engaging activating FcγRs on antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), to induce DC maturation, traditional antigen presentation and cross-presentation, co-stimulatory molecule upregulation, and stimulate cellular immune responses in both mice (Kalergis and Ravetch, 2002Kalergis A.M. Ravetch J.V. Inducing tumor immunity through the selective engagement of activating Fcgamma receptors on dendritic cells.J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, Rafiq et al., 2002Rafiq K. Bergtold A. Clynes R. Immune complex-mediated antigen presentation induces tumor immunity.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and humans (Boruchov et al., 2005Boruchov A.M. Heller G. Veri M.C. Bonvini E. Ravetch J.V. Young J.W. Activating and inhibitory IgG Fc receptors on human DCs mediate opposing functions.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2914-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, Dhodapkar et al., 2005Dhodapkar K.M. Kaufman J.L. Ehlers M. Banerjee D.K. Bonvini E. Koenig S. Steinman R.M. Ravetch J.V.

USA. 2005; 102: 2910-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Often, antibody:antigen immune complex immunization results in more potent cross-presentation and CD4 or CD8 T cell responses than antigen immunization alone. Thus, a logical approach to boosting cellular immune responses involves passive administration of antibodies reactive with tumor antigens or tumor neoantigens. Therefore, in this current study, we utilize a tumor model expressing a model tumor neoantigen to test whether and how passive anti-tumor antibody treatment stimulates an anti-tumor vaccinal effect and cellular immune response. Three activating FcγRs are expressed in mice (mouse [m]FcγRI, mFcγRIII, and mFcγRIV) and humans (hFcγRI, hFcγRIIA, and hFcγRIIIA), and a single inhibitory FcγR, FcγRIIB, is expressed in both species. The cellular outcome of IgG interactions with FcγRs is governed by the affinity of an antibody’s Fc for the specific receptor and the expression pattern of those receptors on effector cells (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2008Nimmerjahn F. Ravetch J.V. Fcgamma receptors as regulators of immune responses.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (2048) Google Scholar). Since most effector cells co-express activation and inhibitory FcγRs, it is the ratio of the binding affinities of a specific IgG Fc to these receptors that will determine the outcome of the IgG-FcγR interaction. These binding affinities are determined by the amino acid sequences of the IgG Fc subclasses and the IgG Fc’s N-linked glycan. The IgG Fc composition can dramatically influence the in vivo outcome of engaging a tumor antigen by directing the antibody-antigen immune complex or opsonized cell into either a pro- or anti-inflammatory response. For example, mIgG2a antibodies trigger cytotoxicity by virtue of this Fc having a 2-log greater affinity for the activating mFcγRIV receptor as compared to the inhibitory mFcγRIIb receptor, while mIgG1 preferentially engages the inhibitory mFcγRIIb receptor. Mice and humans differ regarding the specific FcγRs expressed on various antigen-presenting cells and the relative affinities of each IgG Fc subclass for each FcγR (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2007Nimmerjahn F. Ravetch J.V. Fc-receptors as regulators of immunity.Adv. Immunol. 2007; 96: 179-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Thus, hIgG1 Fc does not preferentially engage a single hFcγR, as occurs in mice. Two low-affinity activating FcγRs are expressed on monocytes and macrophages in both mice (mFcγRIII and mFcγRIV) and humans (hFcγRIIA and hFcγRIIIA). Murine NK cells express only mFcγRIII, while human NK cells express only hFcγRIIIA. Importantly, while mice express two low-affinity activating FcγRs, mFcγRIII and mFcγRIV, on DCs, humans only express one low-affinity activating FcγR on DCs, hFcγRIIA. Because of these species differences, we have generated FcγR-humanized mice, which express the full array of hFcγRs on a background lacking all murine FcγRs (Smith et al., 2012Smith P. DiLillo D.J. Bournazos S. Li F. Ravetch J.V. Mouse model recapitulating human Fcγ receptor structural and functional diversity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 6181-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Appropriate cell-type-specific expression of all hFcγRs is observed in the FcγR-humanized mice, allowing the characterization of hIgG1 antibody-mediated effector function in the context of human FcγRs. Here, using a murine lymphoma expressing a model tumor neoantigen (hCD20), we mechanistically dissect how an anti-tumor cellular immune response is generated after passive treatment of lymphoma-bearing mice with anti-hCD20 mAb. We demonstrate that not only are activating FcγRs required for macrophage-mediated ADCC, but activating FcγR expression specifically on CD11c+ antigen-presenting cells is required for the generation of an anti-tumor T cell memory immune response and long-term survival. Because of the complexity of the FcγR system, with multiple genes expressed and regulated differentially on the diverse cells of the immune system, designing an anti-tumor antibody for optimal activity requires compatible model systems. We therefore assessed the generation of an anti-tumor vaccinal effect for a hIgG1 anti-hCD20 mAb in FcγR-humanized mice. We show that anti-tumor mAb must engage hFcγRIIIA on clodronate liposome (CLOD)-sensitive macrophages to mediate immediate ADCC, as well as hFcγRIIA (the sole FcγR expressed by human DCs) in order to stimulate a long-term anti-tumor cellular immune response. Thus, while next-generation anti-tumor antibodies with enhanced binding to only hFcγRIIIA on innate effector cells are now in clinical use, our results indicate that anti-tumor antibodies with optimal long-term survival benefit must be optimized for both their short-acting cytotoxic effects through hFcγRIIIA, as well as for engagement of hFcγRIIA on DCs to stimulate long-term anti-tumor cellular immunity. To understand how passive anti-tumor mAb treatment can induce long-term anti-tumor cellular immune responses, we adapted a murine lymphoma model (Abès et al., 2010Abès R. Gélizé E. Fridman W.H. Teillaud J.L. Long-lasting antitumor protection by anti-CD20 antibody through cellular immune response.Blood. 2010; 116: 926-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) of an anti-neoantigen mAb-mediated vaccinal effect (Figure 1A). Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were given syngenic EL4 lymphoma cells that express hCD20 as a tumor neoantigen (EL4-hCD20 cells), followed by mIgG2a isotype anti-hCD20 mAb. The mIgG2a isotype preferentially engages activating mFcγRs and is the most potent mouse subclass for triggering effector cells to result in cellular cytotoxicity, phagocytosis, and inflammatory responses (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2005Nimmerjahn F. Ravetch J.V.

Mice receiving lymphoma cells plus anti-hCD20 mAb clear the tumors and survive in an activating FcγR-dependent manner; wild-type mice survive the tumor challenge, while FcRα null (Smith et al., 2012Smith P. DiLillo D.J. Bournazos S. Li F. Ravetch J.V. Mouse model recapitulating human Fcγ receptor structural and functional diversity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 6181-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) mice (that lack all mFcγRs: mFcγRI, mFcγRIIB, mFcγRIII, and mFcγRIV) and Fcer1g−/− mice (that lack all activating mFcγRs: mFcγRI, mFcγRIII, and mFcγRIV) do not (Figures 1B and S1A). The activating mFcγRIV is a major contributor during this clearance of tumor cells, since only 52% of Fcgr4−/− mice survive tumor challenge after anti-hCD20 mAb treatment (p < 0.001; Figure S1B). Non-FcγR binding DA265 mutant anti-hCD20 was also unable to clear tumors (Figure S1C). Thus, activating FcγRs mediate the initial ADCC clearance of tumor cells by anti-tumor mAb, as reported (Clynes et al., 2000Clynes R.A. Towers T.L. Presta L.G. Ravetch J.V.

Immunol. 1988; 18: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), surviving tumor/mAb-primed mice were re-challenged with 5 × 106 EL4-hCD20 tumor cells, a dose that is 10-fold greater than the initial challenge, without treatment with any additional anti-hCD20 mAb. These primed mice showed 100% survival during re-challenge with EL4-hCD20 cells (Figure 1C). By contrast, surviving tumor/mAb-primed mice re-challenged with EL4-WT cells, which do not express hCD20, showed poor survival. Similar results were seen using a different anti-hCD20 mAb, clone 2B8, which is the parental hybridoma from which rituximab was generated (Figures S1D and S1E). Thus, mice primed with EL4-hCD20 and anti-hCD20 mAb generate a memory immune response and subsequently reject re-challenge with EL4-hCD20 cells, but not EL4 WT cells. In this model of the vaccinal effect, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are required after antibody treatment in order to reject the tumor re-challenge (Abès et al., 2010Abès R. Gélizé E. Fridman W.H. Teillaud J.L. Long-lasting antitumor protection by anti-CD20 antibody through cellular immune response.Blood. 2010; 116: 926-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Specifically, T cell depletion studies demonstrated that CD4+ T cells are required during the initial phases of antibody therapy as well as during tumor re-challenge in order to reject tumors. Using CD8-deficient mice, it was also shown that CD8+ cells are required for tumor rejection during re-challenge. By contrast, mice do not mount any detectable antibody response against hCD20 or EL4-hCD20 cells, and adoptive transfer of serum from tumor/mAb-primed mice does not protect against tumor challenge (Abès et al., 2010Abès R. Gélizé E. Fridman W.H. Teillaud J.L. Long-lasting antitumor protection by anti-CD20 antibody through cellular immune response.Blood. 2010; 116: 926-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In Figure 1C, we show that EL4-hCD20/anti-hCD20 mAb-primed mice only reject EL4-hCD20 cells, and not wild-type EL4 cells, suggesting that the vaccinal effect is directed against hCD20, with little detectable antigen spreading. To confirm that at least a portion of the vaccinal effect cellular immune response is directed at hCD20, mice primed with EL4-hCD20 cells and anti-hCD20 mAb were re-challenged with a distinct tumor cell line, B6BL lymphoma cells, that expressed either cell-surface hCD20 or an irrelevant antigen (mCD20). While 100% of mice re-challenged with B6BL-mCD20 died by day 31, 80% of mice re-challenged with B6BL-hCD20 cells survived at least 90 days (Figure 1D; p = 0.0001). Thus, only cells expressing hCD20 were capable of being rejected. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that an anti-hCD20 immune response is generated after the initial FcγR-mediated clearance of tumor cells by ADCC. To understand the mechanistic basis for an anti-tumor vaccinal effect and to determine whether FcγR expression plays a role during this process, we utilized mice with a CD11c+ cell-specific deletion of mFcγRIV. Fcgr4fl/fl;cd11c-cre mice (Nimmerjahn et al., 2010Nimmerjahn F. Lux A. Albert H. Woigk M. Lehmann C. Dudziak D. Smith P. Ravetch J.V. FcγRIV deletion reveals its central role for IgG2a and IgG2b activity in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 19396-19401Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) show a complete absence of mFcγRIV expression on spleen CD11chi DCs, but only a partial decrease in mFcγRIV expression on spleen CD11b+Gr-1loSSClo monocytes (Figure 2A). All CD11chi cells lose mFcγRIV expression in Fcgr4fl/fl;cd11c-cre mice, while spleen CD11cint cells show partial loss of mFcγRIV and CD11c− cells show only a modest decrease in mFcγRIV (Figure S2A; Table S1). The majority of CD11chiCD8+ DCs and a fraction of CD11chiCD4+ DCs express mFcγRIV, both of which lose all mFcγRIV expression in Fcgr4fl/fl;cd11c-cre mice (Figure S2E). While the majority of CD11cint/−CD11bint cells lose expression of mFcγRIV, only a modest reduction in mFcγRIV is seen in CD11cint/−CD11bhi cells in Fcgr4fl/fl;cd11c-cre mice (Figure S2B). Expression of mFcγRIV is not affected in Ly6G+ neutrophils (Figure S2C). Most CD11b+CD11cint/-F4/80hi macrophages lose mFcγRIV expression in Fcgr4fl/fl;cd11c-cre mice, as these cells express CD11c at intermediate levels (Figure S2D). Similar results demonstrating decreases in mFcγRIV expression on CD11c+ cells and lesser decreases in CD11b+ or F4/80+ cells were seen in bone marrow, peritoneal cavity, and peripheral blood from Fcgr4fl/fl;cd11c-cre mice (Figures S3, S4, and S5; Table S1). Therefore, because mFcγRIV expression was maintained to a sufficient degree on ADCC-mediating innate cells, both control Fcgr4fl/fl and Fcgr4fl/fl;cd11c-cre mice were able to clear primary EL4-hCD20 lymphoma cell challenge after treatment with anti-hCD20 mAb (Figure 2B), indicating that mFcγRIV expression on CD11c+ cells is not required for anti-hCD20 mAb-mediated ADCC.Figure S2Spleen mFcγRIV Expression in Fcgr4fl/fl, Fcgr4fl/fl;cd11c-cre, or Fcgr4−/− Mice, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A–D) Spleens were isolated from the indicated mice, digested, and surface stained before flow cytometry analysis.

Although these features have been proposed to have provided the selective context for the evolution of human hypercooperation and cumulative culture, how such a distinctive social system may have emerged remains unclear. We present an agent-based model suggesting that, even if all individuals in a community seek to live with as many kin as possible, within-camp relatedness is reduced if men and women have equal influence in selecting camp members. Our model closely approximates observed patterns of co-residence among Agta and Mbendjele BaYaka hunter-gatherers. Our results suggest that pair-bonding and increased sex egalitarianism in human evolutionary history may have had a transformative effect on human social organization."
https://openalex.org/W1674032221,"All galaxies once passed through a hyperluminous quasar phase powered by accretion onto a supermassive black hole. But because these episodes are brief, quasars are rare objects typically separated by cosmological distances. In a survey for Lyman-α emission at redshift z ≈ 2, we discovered a physical association of four quasars embedded in a giant nebula. Located within a substantial overdensity of galaxies, this system is probably the progenitor of a massive galaxy cluster. The chance probability of finding a quadruple quasar is estimated to be ∼10(-7), implying a physical connection between Lyman-α nebulae and the locations of rare protoclusters. Our findings imply that the most massive structures in the distant universe have a tremendous supply (≃10(11) solar masses) of cool dense (volume density ≃ 1 cm(-3)) gas, which is in conflict with current cosmological simulations."

Despite the importance of centrosomes as microtubule-organizing centers, the mechanism and regulation of PCM assembly are not well understood. In Caenorhabditis elegans, PCM assembly requires the coiled-coil protein SPD-5. We found that recombinant SPD-5 could polymerize to form micrometer-sized porous networks in vitro. Network assembly was accelerated by two conserved regulators that control PCM assembly in vivo, Polo-like kinase-1 and SPD-2/Cep192. Only the assembled SPD-5 networks, and not unassembled SPD-5 protein, functioned as a scaffold for other PCM proteins. Thus, PCM size and binding capacity emerge from the regulated polymerization of one coiled-coil protein to form a porous network."
https://openalex.org/W2105448992,"Adult neural stem cells are the source for restoring injured brain tissue. We used repetitive imaging to follow single stem cells in the intact and injured adult zebrafish telencephalon in vivo and found that neurons are generated by both direct conversions of stem cells into postmitotic neurons and via intermediate progenitors amplifying the neuronal output. We observed an imbalance of direct conversion consuming the stem cells and asymmetric and symmetric self-renewing divisions, leading to depletion of stem cells over time. After brain injury, neuronal progenitors are recruited to the injury site. These progenitors are generated by symmetric divisions that deplete the pool of stem cells, a mode of neurogenesis absent in the intact telencephalon. Our analysis revealed changes in the behavior of stem cells underlying generation of additional neurons during regeneration."

Herbal medicines are made from vegetal drugs, the processed products of medicinal species. These processed materials present a number of challenges in terms of botanical identification, and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the use of incorrect species is a threat to consumer safety. The samples used in this study consisted of the dried leaves, flowers and roots of 257 samples from 8 distinct species approved by the WHO for the production of medicinal herbs and sold in Brazilian markets. Identification of the samples in this study using DNA barcoding (matK, rbcL and ITS2 regions) revealed that the level of substitutions may be as high as 71%. Using qualitative and quantitative chemical analyses, this study identified situations in which the correct species was being sold, but the chemical compounds were not present. Even more troubling, some samples identified as substitutions using DNA barcoding contained the chemical compounds from the correct species at the minimum required concentration. This last situation may lead to the use of unknown species or species whose safety for human consumption remains unknown. This study concludes that DNA barcoding should be used in a complementary manner for species identification with chemical analyses to detect and quantify the required chemical compounds, thus improving the quality of this class of medicines."

Using simple incubation and chromatography approaches, we measured the rate of the chemical reduction of phosphate to P(III) compounds in the western tropical North Atlantic Ocean. Colonial nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria in surface waters played a critical role in phosphate reduction, but other classes of plankton, including potentially deep-water archaea, were also involved. These data are consistent with marine geochemical evidence and microbial genomic information, which together suggest the existence of a vast oceanic phosphorus redox cycle."

Tobacco cigarettes are more toxic than e-cigarettes at comparable nicotine concentrations. During cardiac differentiation of hESCs, tobacco smoke exposure results in a delayed transition through mesoderm. Both types of cigarettes decrease expression of cardiac transcription factors in cardiac progenitor cells, suggesting a persistent delay in differentiation. In definitive human cardiomyocytes, both e-cigarette- and tobacco cigarette-treated samples showed reduced expression of sarcomeric genes such as MLC2v and MYL6. Furthermore, tobacco cigarette-treated samples had delayed onset of beating and showed low levels and aberrant localization of N-cadherin, reduced myofilament content with significantly reduced sarcomere length, and increased expression of the immature cardiac marker smooth muscle alpha-actin.These data indicate a negative effect of both tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes on heart development in vitro and in vivo. Tobacco cigarettes are more toxic than E-cigarettes and exhibit a broader spectrum of cardiac developmental defects."

Rosmarinic acid in serum was measured by a coulometric detection method using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography electrochemical detector. The serum concentration of total rosmarinic acid peaked at 1 hour after administration of Melissa officinalis extract containing 500mg rosmarinic acid in fasted state, with a maximum serum concentration 162.20 nmol/ L. The area under the curve for intact rosmarinic acid was calculated from the serum concentration-time profile to be 832.13 nmol • hour/ L. Food intake increases area under the curve and delayed time at which the maximum serum concentration. Rosmarinic acid supplementation did not affect liver, kidney, or blood cell function parameters. No adverse event was reported by any of the participants due to the study treatment.

We previously characterized GALT2 (At4g21060), and now report on functional characterization of GALT5 (At1g74800). GALT5 was identified using heterologous expression in Pichia and an in vitro GALT assay. Product characterization showed GALT5 specifically adds galactose to hydroxyproline in AGP protein backbones. Functions of GALT2 and GALT5 were elucidated by phenotypic analysis of single and double mutant plants. Allelic galt5 and galt2 mutants, and particularly galt2 galt5 double mutants, demonstrated lower GALT activities and reductions in β-Yariv-precipitated AGPs compared to wild type. Mutant plants showed pleiotropic growth and development phenotypes (defects in root hair growth, root elongation, pollen tube growth, flowering time, leaf development, silique length, and inflorescence growth), which were most severe in the double mutants. Conditional mutant phenotypes were also observed, including salt-hypersensitive root growth and root tip swelling as well as reduced inhibition of pollen tube growth and root growth in response to β-Yariv reagent. These mutants also phenocopy mutants for an AGP, SOS5, and two cell wall receptor-like kinases, FEI1 and FEI2, which exist in a genetic signaling pathway. In summary, GALT5 and GALT2 function as redundant GALTs that control AGP O-glycosylation, which is essential for normal growth and development."

Under a resonant drive, the level occupation was found to oscillate in time, similarly to an N-level system.

To gain insight into the role of isolated fragments in NPM1 activities, we dissected the C-terminal domain (CTD) into its helical fragments. In this study, we observed the unexpected structural behavior of the peptide fragment corresponding to helix (H)2 (residues 264-277). This peptide has a strong tendency to form amyloidlike assemblies endowed with fibrillar morphology and β-sheet structure, under physiologic conditions, as shown by circular dichroism, thioflavin T, and Congo red binding assays; dynamic light scattering; and atomic force microscopy. The aggregates are also toxic to neuroblastoma cells, as determined using 3-(4;5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction and Ca(2+) influx assays. We also found that the extension of the H2 sequence beyond its N terminus, comprising the connecting loop with H1, delayed aggregation and its associated cytotoxicity, suggesting that contiguous regions of H2 have a protective role in preventing aggregation. Our findings and those in the literature suggest that the helical structures present in the CTD are important in preventing harmful aggregation. These findings could elucidate the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) caused by NPM1 mutants. Because the CTD is not properly folded in these mutants, we hypothesize that the aggregation propensity of this NPM1 region is involved in the pathogenesis of AML. Preliminary assays on NPM1-Cter-MutA, the most frequent AML-CTD mutation, revealed its significant propensity for aggregation. Thus, the aggregation phenomena should be seriously considered in studies aimed at unveiling the molecular mechanisms of this pathology."

In addition, the profiles in children with a different training volume were compared and possible differences in training hours per week between children from a low, moderate, and high level of physical fitness and motor coordination were investigated.Data of 620 children, 347 boys and 273 girls, who participated in the Flemish Sports Compass were used. Only the primary sport of each child was considered and six groups of sports (Ball sports, Dance, Gymnastics, Martial arts, Racquet sports and Swimming) were formed based on common characteristics. Measurements consisted of 17 tests. Independent T-tests and Mann-Whitney U-tests revealed few differences between the groups of sports and the discriminant analyses with the moderate and low active group did not show any significant results (p > .05). However, when discriminating among the high active children, a 85.2 % correct classification between six groups of sports was found (Wilks' Λ = .137 and p < .001). Finally, children performing under average on the tests spent significantly fewer hours in sport per week (2.50 ± 1.84 hours) compared to the children performing best (3.25 ± 2.60 hours) (p = .016) and the children performing above average (2.90 ± 1.96 hours) (p = .029) on physical fitness and motor coordination.The study showed that in general, children at a young age do not exhibit sport-specific characteristics, except in children with a high training volume. It is possible that on the one hand, children have not spent enough time yet in their sport to develop sport-specific qualities. On the other hand, it could be possible that they do not take individual qualities into account when choosing a sport."

In most strains of mice, lethality occurs only 2 or 3 weeks after a single dose of 114–300 μg/kg of dioxin, and it is associated with inhibition of gluconeogenesis but also with feed intake refusal and body weight loss (12Poland A.

There is approximately a 10-fold difference in susceptibility between the high sensitive C57BL/6 and low sensitive DBA/2 strains, which is due to polymorphic variations in the ligand-binding domain and in the C-terminal transactivation domain of the Ahr in each strain (16Poland A. Palen D. Glover E. Analysis of the four alleles of the murine aryl hydrocarbon receptor.Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 915-921PubMed Google Scholar). C57BL/6 mice harbor the high affinity Ahrb1 b1 allele, whereas DBA/2 and 129 substrains harbor the low affinity Ahrd allele (17Poland A. Glover E.

The molecular mechanisms of the dioxin-induced wasting syndrome remain obscure, but Ahr-deficient (Ahr−/−) mice are resistant to this and other dioxin-dependent outcomes, indicating a key role for AHR in dioxin-induced toxicity (19Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Hilbert D.M. Rudikoff S. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Aryl-hydrocarbon receptor-deficient mice are resistant to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-induced toxicity.Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 140: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). TCDD-inducible poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Tiparp; Parp7; Artd14) is an Ahr target gene that is expressed in many different tissues, including liver, heart, spleen, brain, and reproductive organs (20Ma Q. Baldwin K.T. Renzelli A.J. McDaniel A. Dong L. TCDD-inducible poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase: a novel response to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). TIPARP is a member of the poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) family that uses NAD+ as a substrate to transfer ADP-ribose onto target proteins. TIPARP contains a CCCH-type zinc finger, a tryptophan-tryptophan-glutamate (WWE) domain involved in protein-protein interactions and a C-terminal catalytic domain (21Hottiger M.O. Hassa P.O. Lüscher B. Schüler H. Koch-Nolte F. Toward a unified nomenclature for mammalian ADP-ribosyltransferases.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 208-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). The majority of PARP family members transfer mono-ADP-ribose, and not poly-ADP-ribose to their substrates (22Vyas S. Matic I. Uchima L. Rood J. Zaja R. Hay R.T. Ahel I. Chang P. Family-wide analysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification involved in several biological processes, such as immune cell function, the regulation of transcription, and DNA repair (23Kraus W.L. Hottiger M.O. PARP-1 and gene regulation: progress and puzzles.Mol. Aspects Med. 2013; 34: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylation is reversible with its removal being catalyzed by macrodomain-containing proteins, such as macrodomain 1 (MacroD1) and macrodomain 2 (MacroD2) (24Feijs K.L. Forst A.H. Verheugd P. Lüscher B. Macrodomain-containing proteins: regulating new intracellular functions of mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). We recently reported that TIPARP mono-ADP-ribosylates itself and core histones, and as part of a negative feedback loop it represses AHR activity by increasing its proteolytic degradation (25MacPherson L. Tamblyn L. Rajendra S. Bralha F. McPherson J.P. Matthews J. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (TiPARP, ARTD14) is a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase and repressor of aryl hydrocarbon receptor transactivation.Nucleic Acid Res. 2013; 41: 1604-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the impact of TIPARP on AHR signaling and dioxin-induced toxicity in vivo has not been determined. Here, we show that the loss of Tiparp increases sensitivity to dioxin-induced steatohepatitis and lethality. We also provide evidence that Tiparp mono-ADP-ribosylates AHR, but not ARNT, and that the actions of TIPARP are reversed by the ADP-ribosylase, MACROD1. Overall, our findings reveal previously unidentified roles for Tiparp, MACROD1, and ADP-ribosylation in AHR signaling, dioxin toxicity, and lethality. TiparpGt(ROSA)79Sor (26Schmahl J. Raymond C.S. Soriano P. PDGF signaling specificity is mediated through multiple immediate early genes.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). These mutant mice were produced on a mixed C57BL/6;129S4 background (26Schmahl J. Raymond C.S. Soriano P. PDGF signaling specificity is mediated through multiple immediate early genes.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), before being backcrossed 2 to 3 generations onto C57BL/6. 3P. Soriano, personal communication. The mice were then backcrossed one generation onto C57BL/6J (stock no. 000664) at The Jackson Laboratory prior to being received in our laboratory. The exact number of backcrosses onto C57BL/6 was not known when we initiated these studies; however, single nucleotide polymorphism analysis done by The Jackson Laboratory revealed the mice to be ∼90% C57BL/6 or that they have been backcrossed at least three generations onto C57BL/6. Congenic C57BL/6 and 129S mice used for Ahr genotyping were from Charles River (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). The mice we received from the cryopreserved TiparpGt(ROSA)79Sor strain were maintained by breeding heterozygous mice throughout this study. Eight-week-old mice were injected intraperitoneally with 30 μg/kg bw of dioxin (Wellington Laboratories) dissolved in corn oil (Sigma) and 10 or 100 μg/kg bw of dioxin dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma). Control mice received an equivalent volume of corn oil or DMSO. For the mortality studies, mice were followed for up to 30 days after a single injection of 10 or 100 μg/kg of dioxin. For food intake studies, mice were housed individually and provided intact pellets of food that were weighed daily. A baseline was determined for each mouse by monitoring food intake for 1 week prior to treatment. Briefly, standard mouse pellets (Harlan Laboratories) that weighed ∼4–5 g each were placed on top of the wire mouse feeder and a single pellet placed in a dish on the cage floor. To obtain the amount of food a mouse ate, we weighed the total amount of food the day before. The next morning, the food pellets on the wire feeder, the single pellet in the dish, and any additional pieces were collected and weighed. This amount was subtracted from the measurement made the day before to give us the food intake value. Because there was only a single pellet placed on the floor of the cage, with the rest of the pellets in the wire rack, contamination from water or urine was assumed to be minimal in comparison with the total amount of food and similar among the different cages. Coprophagia could not be accounted for under these conditions. After treatment, food intake (g/g of body weight) was calculated daily until the end of the study. To determine serum glucose levels, whole blood was collected from mice treated for 1–3 days with 100 μg/kg bw dioxin. Mice were fasted for 4 h prior to blood collection. Serum was then isolated and analyzed using the Autokit glucose reagent (Wako Diagnostics) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Care and treatment of animals followed the guidelines set by the Canadian Council on Animal Care and was approved by the University of Toronto Animal Care Committee. Genomic DNA was isolated from the tails of pups born from Tiparp+/− intercrosses. Tiparp genotypes were determined by PCR analysis of tail biopsies. The common forward primer was 5′-TGTCAGATCCCTCCTTCGTGAGGC-3′, the Tiparp+/+ reverse primer was 5′-GTATAGTACCTAGCACTGTTCACC-3′, and the Tiparp−/− reverse primer was 5′-GAAGCCTATAGAGTACGAGCCGTAGA-3′. Homozygous null mice were designated Tiparp−/−. A 20-μl reaction contained 1× Jumpstart Taq buffer and 0.2 units of Jumpstart Taq polymerase (Sigma), 1.75 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.2 μm of each primer, and 2 μl of DNA. PCR cycling conditions included an initial step of 3 min at 94 °C that was followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C to denature DNA, 30 s at 59 °C for primer annealing, and 70 °C for 45 s for elongation. This was followed by a final step of 7 min at 70 °C. PCR products were resolved using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis followed by visualization with ethidium bromide. The Ahr genotypes were determined using real time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Genomic DNA used to genotype Tiparp was purified using GenElute Mammalian Genomic DNA Miniprep kit (Sigma). Discrimination between the Ahrb1 and Ahrd alleles was based on common Ahr forward 5′-TCGACATAACGGACGAATCC-3′ and reverse 5′-CATACAGCTTAGGTGCTGAGTC-3′ primers and allele-specific probes designed to take advantage of differences between the Ahrb1 and Ahrd alleles in the exon 10 sequence of the Ahr gene (18Yu Z.

Ahrb1 allele-specific probe was 5′6FAMTCAACTTTGZENCTGAACTCGGCTTGCIABkFQ-3′. Ahrd-allele specific probe was 5′-6FAMAACTTTGAaZENGAACTCCGCTTGCIABkFQ-3′. The underlined nucleotides distinguish the Ahr alleles, and the lowercase boldface nucleotide does not match the mouse genomic sequence and represents a T to A point mutation that was necessary for specificity of the Ahrd probe for the Ahrd rather than the Ahrb1 allele. 6FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein, reporter dye), ZEN (internal quencher), and IABkFQ (Iowa Black FQ, quencher dye) were included on the probes (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). A 10-μl reaction was set up using 25 ng of genomic DNA, 2× Kapa Probe reaction mix (Kapa Biosystems), 0.9 μm forward primer, 0.3 μm reverse primer, and 0.2 μm probe. qPCR conditions to detect the Ahrb1 allele using the Ahrb1 probe were 95 °C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 64 °C for 40 s. For detection of the Ahrd allele using the Ahrd probe, the following qPCR conditions were used, 95 °C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 59 °C for 40 s. All samples were also analyzed using Kapa SYBR FAST Green reaction mix, 0.9 μm forward primer, 0.3 μm reverse primer using the following qPCR conditions 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 59 °C for 40 s. Ahr probe-specific reactions were normalized to Ahr gene levels detected by Kapa SYBR FAST Green and analyzed using the comparative CT method. Livers were removed, washed in ice-cold PBS, weighed, and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen livers were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Plus kit and reverse-transcribed as described previously (25MacPherson L.

All genes were amplified using Kapa SYBR Green 2× mix, normalized to ribosomal 18S levels and analyzed using the comparative CT method. For the microarray studies, RNA was isolated from male liver tissues treated with 30 μg/kg dioxin. RNA was processed, labeled, and hybridized to the GeneChIP Mouse Exon 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix) at The Centre for Applied Genomics (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Differentially regulated genes with an absolute fold change of ≥1.5 and p value ≤0.05 were identified using Affymetrix Transcriptome Analysis software. The average gene signal was converted to a log2 scale using a Tukey's bi-weight average for the gene signal intensity for all the samples in a treatment condition. Traditional unpaired one-way ANOVA was performed for dioxin-treated versus corn oil-treated Tiparp+/+ and dioxin-treated versus corn oil-treated Tiparp−/− samples.

Human MacroD1 and MacroD2 cDNAs were amplified by PCR using pCMV6 Myc-DDK MACROD1 or pCMV6 Myc-DDK MACROD2 variant 1 as templates, respectively (Origene, Rockville, MD). The PCR primers for MACROD1 were forward primer 5′-CAAAGAATTCATGTCTCTACAGAGCCGACTGTC-3′ and reverse 5′-CAAAGTCGACGGCCACGGGGAAGTAGTGGG-3′, and for MACROD2 were forward primer 5′-CAAAGAATTCATGTACCCCAGCAACAAGAAGAAAAA-3′ and reverse 5′-CAAACTCGAGTTTAGTTCCATTTCTTTGTTCCTTCG-3′. Following amplification, the MacroD1 sequence was digested with EcoRI and SalI, and the MacroD2 sequence was digested with EcoRI and XhoI. The digested sequences were cloned into EcoRI and XhoI sites of pCMV-2B (Invitrogen). The plasmids pCMV-FLAG-MACROD1_G182E and pCMV-FLAG-MACROD1_D184A were generated by PCR mutagenesis using the forward primer 5′-TCCCTGCTCGGAGGCGGTGAAGTGGACGGCTGCATTCATCGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCGATGAATGCAGCCGTCCACTTCACCGCCTCCGAGCAGGGA-3′ for G182E, and forward primer 5′-CTGCTCGGAGGCGGTGGCGTGGCCGGCTGCATTCATCGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCGATGAATGCAGCCGGCCACGCCACCGCCTCCGAGCAG-3′ for D184A.

Liver tissues from 100 μg/kg dioxin-treated animals were collected on days 1, 3, or 6. Control tissue was from DMSO-treated animals on days 3 or 6 after dosing. Liver tissues from 10 μg/kg dioxin-treated Tiparp−/− animals were collected after the mice were euthanized, which ranged from days 5 to 13 after dosing. Tiparp+/+ animals were euthanized to day-match the Tiparp−/− animals, and their liver tissues were collected. Staining for β-galactosidase activity to visualize cells expressing the lacZ reporter (inserted in intron 1 of the Tiparp gene) was performed on optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT)-embedded tissue following standard methods. H&E staining was done following standard methods with representative images obtained using an AxioImager M2 microscope, AxioCam MRm camera, and AxioVision software (Zeiss). Oil-Red-O/hematoxylin staining was done on sections from OCT-embedded tissue using standard methods. Images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope and Nikon Elements software (NIS-Elements Basic Research, version 3.10). Livers from mice treated with 100 μg/kg dioxin were flash-frozen and used to measure tissue triglyceride, free fatty acid, and cholesterol levels. Free fatty acids were quantified using a kit following the manufacturer's recommendations (MAK044, Sigma). Triglycerides and cholesterol were extracted from livers in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and quantified as described previously (29Patel R. Patel M. Tsai R. Lin V. Bookout A.L. Zhang Y.

https://openalex.org/W208576153,"Objectives To quantify the proportion of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) specifically designed for elderly, and to assess their characteristics, as compared to RCTs not specifically designed for elderly. Design Review and synthesis of published literature. Measurements We searched PubMed for articles published in the year 2012. We included RCTs. Articles were excluded if not conducted with human subjects or if findings of secondary analyses were reported. A random sample of 10% was drawn and of this selection the following trial characteristics were extracted: sample size, disease category, age of sample, and age-related inclusion criteria. Clinical trials were defined to be specifically designed for elderly if a lower age cut-off of ≥ 55 years was used, or when participants had an average age of ≥ 70 years. Results The search strategy yielded 26,740 articles, from which a random sample was drawn, resulting in 2375 articles. After exclusion, data was extracted from 1369 publications. Of these 1369 RCTs, 96 (7%) were specifically designed for elderly. In comparison with trials not designed for older adults, trials designed for elderly contained a significantly larger median number of participants (125 vs. 80, p = 0.008) significantly more trials designed for elderly fell into the disease categories eye (6% vs. 2%, p = 0.005), musculoskeletal (13% vs. 7%, p = 0.023) and circulatory system (16% vs. 9%, p = 0.039). No significant difference was observed with regard to the other disease categories. Conclusion There is a low proportion of RCTs specifically designed for elderly. As older patients will increasingly form the majority in medical practice, there is an urgent need for stronger evidence for the formulation of treatment guidelines specifically for older adults."
https://openalex.org/W282155303,"Cullin 3 (Cul3) recognition by BTB domains is a key process in protein ubiquitination. Among Cul3 binders, a great attention is currently devoted to KCTD proteins, which are implicated in fundamental biological processes. On the basis of the high similarity of BTB domains of these proteins, it has been suggested that the ability to bind Cul3 could be a general property among all KCTDs. In order to gain new insights into KCTD functionality, we here evaluated and/or quantified the binding of Cul3 to the BTB of KCTD proteins, which are known to be involved either in cullin-independent (KCTD12 and KCTD15) or in cullin-mediated (KCTD6 and KCTD11) activities. Our data indicate that KCTD6BTB and KCTD11BTB bind Cul3 with high affinity forming stable complexes with 4:4 stoichiometries. Conversely, KCTD12BTB and KCTD15BTB do not interact with Cul3, despite the high level of sequence identity with the BTB domains of cullin binding KCTDs. Intriguingly, comparative sequence analyses indicate that the capability of KCTD proteins to recognize Cul3 has been lost more than once in distinct events along the evolution. Present findings also provide interesting clues on the structural determinants of Cul3-KCTD recognition. Indeed, the characterization of a chimeric variant of KCTD11 demonstrates that the swapping of α2β3 loop between KCTD11BTB and KCTD12BTB is sufficient to abolish the ability of KCTD11BTB to bind Cul3. Finally, present findings, along with previous literature data, provide a virtually complete coverage of Cul3 binding ability of the members of the entire KCTD family."
https://openalex.org/W208386854,"Pollen released by allergenic members of the botanically unrelated families of Asteraceae and Cupressaceae represent potent elicitors of respiratory allergies in regions where these plants are present. As main allergen sources the Asteraceae species ragweed and mugwort, as well as the Cupressaceae species, cypress, mountain cedar, and Japanese cedar have been identified. The major allergens of all species belong to the pectate lyase enzyme family. Thus, we thought to investigate cross-reactivity pattern as well as sensitization capacities of pectate lyase pollen allergens in cohorts from distinct geographic regions.The clinically relevant pectate lyase pollen allergens Amb a 1, Art v 6, Cup a 1, Jun a 1, and Cry j 1 were purified from aqueous pollen extracts, and patients' sensitization pattern of cohorts from Austria, Canada, Italy, and Japan were determined by IgE ELISA and cross-inhibition experiments. Moreover, we performed microarray experiments and established a mouse model of sensitization.In ELISA and ELISA inhibition experiments specific sensitization pattern were discovered for each geographic region, which reflected the natural allergen exposure of the patients. We found significant cross-reactivity within Asteraceae and Cupressaceae pectate lyase pollen allergens, which was however limited between the orders. Animal experiments showed that immunization with Asteraceae allergens mainly induced antibodies reactive within the order, the same was observed for the Cupressaceae allergens. Cross-reactivity between orders was minimal. Moreover, Amb a 1, Art v 6, and Cry j 1 showed in general higher immunogenicity.We could cluster pectate lyase allergens in four categories, Amb a 1, Art v 6, Cup a 1/Jun a 1, and Cry j 1, respectively, at which each category has the potential to sensitize predisposed individuals. The sensitization pattern of different cohorts correlated with pollen exposure, which should be considered for future allergy diagnosis and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W405332197,"Introduction Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine-metabolic disorders. Evidence of familial aggregation analysis and different clinical traits among different regions and ethnicities indicated that the pathogenesis of PCOS is associated with multiple genetic and environmental factors. Our previous research had identified three susceptibility loci (rs2479106, DENND1A; rs13405728, LHCGR; rs13429458, THADA) for PCOS in Han Chinese women. The overall aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between three susceptibility gene polymorphisms and PCOS in Hui ethnic women. Methods 151 patients with PCOS (case group) and 99 healthy women (control group) were recruited from the Reproductive Medicine Center of the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University. Clinical data and serum hormone characteristics of case and control groups were collected and analyzed. The three susceptibility single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been replicated in both case and control groups. Gene polymorphisms were detected by direct sequencing after polymerase chain reaction. Results The Body Mass Index, LH, LH/FSH ratio and total testosterone were significantly elevated in PCOS patients compared to control group (P<0.05). The frequencies of genotype and allele in rs13405728 were significantly different between the PCOS and the control groups (P<0.05). Of the SNP rs13405728, the PCOS cases with TT genotype stayed at a higher level of total testosterone, TG and LDL than those with the CC and CT genotypes. In contrary, there was no statistical difference between the two groups for SNP rs13429458 and rs2479106 (P>0.05). Conclusion The present study suggested that the SNP rs13405728 in the LHCGR gene was associated with PCOS in Hui ethnic women, and its TT genotype characterized with higher level of TT, TG and LDL."
https://openalex.org/W345093731,"Urbanisation is one of the most dramatic forms of land use change which relatively few species can adapt to. Determining how and why species respond differently to urban habitats is important in predicting future biodiversity loss as urban areas rapidly expand. Understanding how morphological or behavioural traits can influence species adaptability to the built environment may enable us to improve the effectiveness of conservation efforts. Although many bat species are able to exploit human resources, bat species richness generally declines with increasing urbanisation and there is considerable variation in the responses of different bat species to urbanisation. Here, we use acoustic recordings from two cryptic, and largely sympatric European bat species to assess differential responses in their use of fragmented urban woodland and the surrounding urban matrix. There was a high probability of P. pygmaeus activity relative to P. pipistrellus in woodlands with low clutter and understory cover which were surrounded by low levels of built environment. Additionally, the probability of recording P. pygmaeus relative to P. pipistrellus was considerably higher in urban woodland interior or edge habitat in contrast to urban grey or non-wooded green space. These results show differential habitat use occurring between two morphologically similar species; whilst the underlying mechanism for this partitioning is unknown it may be driven by competition avoidance over foraging resources. Their differing response to urbanisation indicates the difficulties involved when attempting to assess how adaptable a species is to urbanisation for conservation purposes."
https://openalex.org/W305790684,"Exponential growth of high-throughput data and the increasing complexity of omics information have been making processing and interpreting biological data an extremely difficult and daunting task. Here we developed FuncTree (http://bioviz.tokyo/functree), a web-based application for analyzing and visualizing large-scale omics data, including but not limited to genomic, metagenomic, and transcriptomic data. FuncTree allows user to map their omics data onto the ""Functional Tree map"", a predefined circular dendrogram, which represents the hierarchical relationship of all known biological functions defined in the KEGG database. This novel visualization method allows user to overview the broad functionality of their data, thus allowing a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the omics information. FuncTree provides extensive customization and calculation methods to not only allow user to directly map their omics data to identify the functionality of their data, but also to compute statistically enriched functions by comparing it to other predefined omics data. We have validated FuncTree's analysis and visualization capability by mapping pan-genomic data of three different types of bacterial genera, metagenomic data of the human gut, and transcriptomic data of two different types of human cell expression. All three mapping strongly confirms FuncTree's capability to analyze and visually represent key functional feature of the omics data. We believe that FuncTree's capability to conduct various functional calculations and visualizing the result into a holistic overview of biological function, would make it an integral analysis/visualization tool for extensive omics base research."

Starting in childhood, Pb in the skeleton can disrupt epiphyseal plate function, constrain the growth of long bones, and prevent attainment of a high peak bone mass, all of which will increase susceptibility to osteoporosis later in life. We hypothesize that the effects of Pb on bone mass, in part, come from depression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, a critical anabolic pathway for osteoblastic bone formation. In this study, we show that depression of Wnt signaling by Pb is due to increased sclerostin levels in vitro and in vivo. Downstream activation of the β-catenin pathway using a pharmacological inhibitor of GSK-3β ameliorates the Pb inhibition of Wnt signaling activity in the TOPGAL reporter mouse. The effect of Pb was determined to be dependent on sclerostin expression through use of the SOST gene knock-out mice, which are resistant to Pb-induced trabecular bone loss and maintain their mechanical bone strength. Moreover, isolated bone marrow cells from the sclerostin null mice show improved bone formation potential even after exposure to Pb. Also, our data suggest that the TGFβ canonical signaling pathway is the mechanism by which Pb controls sclerostin production. Taken together these results support our hypothesis that the osteoporotic-like phenotype observed after Pb exposure is, in part, regulated through modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

https://openalex.org/W282305505,"Group A streptococcus (GAS, Streptococcus pyogenes), a multi-virulent, exclusive human pathogen responsible for various invasive and non-invasive diseases possesses biofilm forming phenomenon as one of its pathogenic armaments. Recently, antibiofilm agents have gained prime importance, since inhibiting the biofilm formation is expected to reduce development of antibiotic resistance and increase their susceptibility to the host immune cells.The current study demonstrates the antibiofilm activity of 3Furancarboxaldehyde (3FCA), a floral honey derived compound, against GAS biofilm, which was divulged using crystal violet assay, light microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The report is extended to study its effect on various aspects of GAS (morphology, virulence, aggregation) at its minimal biofilm inhibitory concentration (132μg/ml). 3FCA was found to alter the growth pattern of GAS in solid and liquid medium and increased the rate of auto-aggregation. Electron microscopy unveiled the increase in extra polymeric substances around cell. Gene expression studies showed down-regulation of covR gene, which is speculated to be the prime target for the antibiofilm activity. Increased hyaluronic acid production and down regulation of srtB gene is attributed to the enhanced rate of auto-aggregation. The virulence genes (srv, mga, luxS and hasA) were also found to be over expressed, which was manifested with the increased susceptibility of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to 3FCA treated GAS. The toxicity of 3FCA was ruled out with no adverse effect on C. elegans.Though 3FCA possess antibiofilm activity against GAS, it was also found to increase the virulence of GAS. This study demonstrates that, covR mediated antibiofilm activity may increase the virulence of GAS. This also emphasizes the importance to analyse the acclimatization response and virulence of the pathogen in the presence of antibiofilm compounds prior to their clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W1529655496,"The dual role of glycolytic enzymes in cytosol-located metabolic processes and in cell surface-mediated functions with an influence on virulence is described for various micro-organisms. Cell wall-less bacteria of the class Mollicutes including the common human pathogen Mycoplasma pneumoniae possess a reduced genome limiting the repertoire of virulence factors and metabolic pathways. After the initial contact of bacteria with cells of the respiratory epithelium via a specialized complex of adhesins and release of cell-damaging factors, surface-displayed glycolytic enzymes may facilitate the further interaction between host and microbe. In this study, we described detection of the four subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHA-D) among the cytosolic and membrane-associated proteins of M. pneumoniae. Subunits of PDH were cloned, expressed and purified to produce specific polyclonal guinea pig antisera. Using colony blotting, fractionation of total proteins and immunofluorescence experiments, the surface localization of PDHA-C was demonstrated. All recombinant PDH subunits are able to bind to HeLa cells and human plasminogen. These interactions can be specifically blocked by the corresponding polyclonal antisera. In addition, an influence of ionic interactions on PDHC-binding to plasminogen as well as of lysine residues on the association of PDHA-D with plasminogen was confirmed. The PDHB subunit was shown to activate plasminogen and the PDHB-plasminogen complex induces degradation of human fibrinogen. Hence, our data indicate that the surface-associated PDH subunits might play a role in the pathogenesis of M. pneumoniae infections by interaction with human plasminogen."
https://openalex.org/W1611180290,"The fragmentation of production across countries has become an important feature of the globalization in recent decades and is often conceptualized by the term, global value chains (GVCs). When empirically investigating the GVCs, previous studies are mainly interested in knowing how global the GVCs are rather than how the GVCs look like. From a complex networks perspective, we use the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) to study the global production system. We find that the industry-level GVCs are indeed not chain-like but are better characterized by the tree topology. Hence, we compute the global value trees (GVTs) for all the industries available in the WIOD. Moreover, we compute an industry importance measure based on the GVTs and compare it with other network centrality measures. Finally, we discuss some future applications of the GVTs."
https://openalex.org/W2105925331,"The angiopoietin (Ang) ligands are potential therapeutic targets for lymphatic related diseases, which include lymphedema and cancer. Ang-1 and Ang-2 functions are established, but those of Ang-4 are poorly understood. We used intravital fluorescence microscopy to characterize Ang-4 actions on T241 murine fibrosarcoma-associated vessels in mice. The diameters of lymphatic vessels draining Ang-4- or VEGF-C (positive control)-expressing tumors increased to 123 and 135 μm, respectively, and parental, mock-transduced (negative controls) and tumors expressing Ang-1 or Ang-2 remained at baseline (∼60 μm). Ang-4 decreased human dermal lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) monolayer permeability by 27% while increasing human dermal blood endothelial cell (BEC) monolayer permeability by 200%. In vivo, Ang-4 stimulated a 4.5-fold increase in tumor-associated blood vessel permeability compared with control when measured using intravital quantitative multiphoton microscopy. Ang-4 activated receptor signaling in both LECs and BECs, evidenced by tyrosine kinase with Ig and endothelial growth factor homology domains-2 (TIE2) receptor, protein kinase B, and Erk1,2 phosphorylation detectable by immunoblotting. These data suggest that Ang-4 actions are mediated through cell-type-specific networks and that lymphatic vessel dilation occurs secondarily to increased vascular leakage. Ang-4 also promoted survival of LECs. Thus, blocking Ang-4 may prune the draining lymphatic vasculature and decrease interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) by reducing vascular permeability."
https://openalex.org/W362892045,"Gaucher disease, the most common lysosomal storage disorder, is caused by β-glucocerebrosidase deficiency. Bone complications are the major cause of morbidity in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease (GD1). Genetic components strongly influence bone remodelling. In addition, chronic inflammation produced by Gaucher cells induces the production of several cytokines, which leads to direct changes in the bone remodelling process and can also affect the process indirectly through other immune cells. In this study, we analysed the association between bone mineral density (BMD), bone marrow burden score, and relevant genetic polymorphisms related to bone metabolism, as well as profiles of proinflammatory cytokines in a GD1 cohort. This study included 83 patients distributed according to bone status. BMD was measured with DXA and broadband ultrasound attenuation; bone marrow involvement was evaluated using MRI. We also analysed 26 SNPs located in 14 genes related to bone metabolism. To assess proinflammatory status, we analysed IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-13, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and TNFα in plasma samples from 71 control participants and GD1 patients. SNP genotype proportions and BMD differed significantly between ESRI c.453-397T>C and VDR c.1024+283G>A variants. We also observed significant associations between GD1 genotypes and bone affectation. When patients were stratified by spleen status, we observed significant correlations between non-/splenectomized groups and Spanish MRI (S-MRI) score. Across genotype proportions of non-/splenectomized patients and S-MRI, we observed significant differences in ESRI c.453-397T>C, VDR c.-83-25988G>A, and TNFRSF11B c.9C>G polymorphisms. We observed different significant proinflammatory profiles between control participants, treatment-naïve patients, and patients on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT); between non-/splenectomized patients (between untreated and ERT-treated patients) and among those with differing GBA genotypes. The data suggest that patients with GD1 have increased susceptibility to developing bone disease owing to the coexistence of genetic variants, and that genetic background in GD1 is fundamental to regulate the impact of proinflammatory status on the development of bone disease."
https://openalex.org/W990126919,"Arenaviruses are bi-segmented, single-stranded RNA viruses that cause significant human disease. The manner in which they regulate the replication of their genome is not well-understood. This is partly due to the absence of a highly sensitive assay to measure individual species of arenavirus replicative RNAs. To overcome this obstacle, we designed a quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay for selective quantitation of each of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) genomic or antigenomic RNAs. During the course of assay design, we identified a nonspecific priming phenomenon whereby, in the absence of an RT primer, cDNAs complementary to each of the LCMV replicative RNA species are generated during RT. We successfully circumvented this nonspecific priming event through the use of biotinylated primers in the RT reaction, which permitted affinity purification of primer-specific cDNAs using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. As proof of principle, we used the assay to map the dynamics of LCMV replication at acute and persistent time points and to determine the quantities of genomic and antigenomic RNAs that are incorporated into LCMV particles. This assay can be adapted to measure total S or L segment-derived viral RNAs and therefore represents a highly sensitive diagnostic platform to screen for LCMV infection in rodent and human tissue samples and can also be used to quantify virus-cell attachment."
https://openalex.org/W1517029016,"Fruit and seed development in plants is a complex biological process mainly involved in input and biosynthesis of many storage compounds such as proteins and oils. Although the basic biochemical pathways for production of the storage metabolites in plants are well characterized, their regulatory mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we functionally identified rapeseed (Brassica napus) miR394 with its target gene Brassica napus LEAF CURLING RESPONSIVENESS (BnLCR) to dissect a role of miR394 during the fruit and seed development. Transgenic rapeseed plants over-expressing miR394 under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter were generated. miR394 over-expression plants exhibited a delayed flowering time and enlarged size of plants, leaf blade, pods and seed body, but developed seeds with higher contents of protein and glucosinolates (GLS) and lower levels of oil accumulation as compared to wild-type. Over-expression of miR394 altered the fatty acid (FA) composition by increasing several FA species such as C16:0 and C18:0 and unsaturated species of C20:1 and C22:1 but lowering C18:3. This change was accompanied by induction of genes coding for transcription factors of FA synthesis including LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (BnLEC1), BnLEC2, and FUSCA3 (FUS3). Because the phytohormone auxin plays a crucial role in fruit development and seed patterning, the DR5-GUS reporter was used for monitoring the auxin response in Arabidopsis siliques and demonstrated that the DR5 gene was strongly expressed. These results suggest that BnmiR394 is involved in rapeseed fruit and seed development."
https://openalex.org/W301303608,"Background Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG), occurs due to the developmental defects in the trabecular meshwork and anterior chamber angle in children. PCG exhibits genetic heterogeneity and the CYP1B1 gene has been widely implicated worldwide. Despite the diverse mutation spectra, the clinical implications of these mutations are yet unclear. The present study attempted to delineate the clinical profile of PCG in the background of CYP1B1 mutations from a large cohort of 901 subjects from India (n=601) and Brazil (n=300). Methods Genotype-phenotype correlations was undertaken on clinically well characterized PCG cases from India (n=301) and Brazil (n=150) to assess the contributions of CYP1B1 mutation on a set of demographic and clinical parameters. The demographic (gender, and history of consanguinity) and quantitative clinical (presenting intraocular pressure [IOP] and corneal diameter [CD]) parameters were considered as binary and continuous variables, respectively, for PCG patients in the background of the overall mutation spectra and also with respect to the prevalent mutations in India (R368H) and Brazil (4340delG). All these variables were fitted in a multivariate logistic regression model using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (OR) using the R software (version 2.14.1). Results The overall mutation spectrum were similar across the Indian and Brazilian PCG cases, despite significantly higher number of homozygous mutations in the former (p=0.024) and compound heterozygous mutations in the later (p=0.012). A wide allelic heterogeneity was observed and only 6 mutations were infrequently shared between these two populations. The adjusted ORs for the binary (demographic) and continuous (clinical) variables did not indicate any susceptibility to the observed mutations (p>0.05). Conclusions The present study demonstrated a lack of genotype-phenotype correlation of the demographic and clinical traits to CYP1B1 mutations in PCG at presentation. However, the susceptibility of these mutations to the long-term progression of these traits are yet to be deciphered."

Information on four indices of fetal growth: ponderal index, head circumference/ abdominal circumference ratio, cephalization index and birth weight/ placenta weight ratio was collected. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). All measurements were evaluated as gestational age and sex specific z-scores and in z-score percentile groups, adjusted for potential confounders, and stratified on gestational age groups (<32, 32-36, 37-38, 39, 40, ≥ 41 weeks).We identified 503,784 singleton births, of which 983 were confirmed cases of CP. Head/ abdominal circumference ratio (aHR:1.12; 95%CI:1.07-1.16) and cephalization index (aHR:1.14; 95%CI:1.11-1.16) were associated with the risk of CP irrespective of gestational age. Birth weight-placental weight ratio was also associated with CP in the entire cohort (aHR:0.90; 95%CI:0.83-0.97). Ponderal index had a u-shaped association with CP, where both children with low and high ponderal index were at higher risk of CP.CP is associated with disproportions between birth weight, birth length, placental weight and head circumference suggesting pre and perinatal conditions contribute to fetal growth restriction in children with CP."
https://openalex.org/W269015836,"Quantitatively, methanesulfonate (MSA) is a very relevant compound in the global biogeochemical sulfur cycle. Its utilization by bacteria as a source of carbon and energy has been described and a specific enzyme, methanesulfonate monooxygenase (MSAMO), has been found to perform the first catabolic step of its oxidation. Other proteins seemingly involved in the import of MSA into bacterial cells have been reported. In this study, we obtained novel sequences of genes msmA and msmE from marine, estuary and soil MSA-degraders (encoding the large subunit of the MSAMO enzyme and the periplasmic component of the import system, respectively). We also obtained whole-genome sequences of two novel marine Filomicrobium strains, Y and W, and annotated two full msm operons in these genomes. Furthermore, msmA and msmE sequences were amplified from North Atlantic seawater and analyzed. Good conservation of the MsmA deduced protein sequence was observed in both cultured strains and metagenomic clones. A long spacer sequence in the Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster-binding motif within MsmA was found to be conserved in all instances, supporting the hypothesis that this feature is specific to the large (α) subunit of the MSAMO enzyme. The msmE gene was more difficult to amplify, from both cultivated isolates and marine metagenomic DNA. However, 3 novel msmE sequences were obtained from isolated strains and one directly from seawater. With both genes, our results combined with previous metagenomic analyses seem to imply that moderate to high-GC strains are somehow favored during enrichment and isolation of MSA-utilizing bacteria, while the majority of msm genes obtained by cultivation-independent methods have low levels of GC%, which is a clear example of the misrepresentation of natural populations that culturing, more often than not, entails. Nevertheless, the data obtained in this work show that MSA-degrading bacteria are abundant in surface seawater, which suggests ecological relevance for this metabolic group of bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W229642873,"Texel lambs are known to be more resistant to gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) infection than Suffolk lambs, with a greater ability to limit infection. The objectives of this study were to: 1) profile the whole transcriptome of abomasal lymph node tissue of GIN-free Texel and Suffolk lambs; 2) identify differentially expressed genes and characterize the immune-related biological pathways and networks associated with these genes. Abomasal lymph nodes were collected from Texel (n = 6) and Suffolk (n = 4) lambs aged 19 weeks that had been GIN-free since 6 weeks of age. Whole transcriptome profiling was performed using RNA-seq on the Illumina platform. At the time of conducting this study, a well annotated Ovine genome was not available and hence the sequence reads were aligned with the Bovine (UMD3.1) genome. Identification of differentially expressed genes was followed by pathway and network analysis. The Suffolk breed accounted for significantly more of the differentially expressed genes, (276 more highly expressed in Suffolk v 162 in Texel; P < 0.001). The four most significant differentially expressed pathways were all related to immunity and were classified as: Role of Pattern Recognition Receptors in Recognition of Bacteria and Viruses, Activation of IRF by Cytosolic Pattern Recognition Receptors, Role of RIG-I-like Receptors in Antiviral Innate Immunity, and Interferon Signaling. Of significance is the fact that all of these four pathways were more highly expressed in the Suffolk. These data suggest that in a GIN-free environment, Suffolk lambs have a more active immune profile relative to the Texel: this immune profile may contribute to the poorer efficiency of response to a GIN challenge in the Suffolk breed compared to the Texel breed."
https://openalex.org/W307229724,"Multifunctional protein Dps plays an important role in iron assimilation and a crucial role in bacterial genome packaging. Its monomers form dodecameric spherical particles accumulating ~400 molecules of oxidized iron ions within the protein cavity and applying a flexible N-terminal ends of each subunit for interaction with DNA. Deposition of iron is a well-studied process by which cells remove toxic Fe2+ ions from the genetic material and store them in an easily accessible form. However, the mode of interaction with linear DNA remained mysterious and binary complexes with Dps have not been characterized so far. It is widely believed that Dps binds DNA without any sequence or structural preferences but several lines of evidence have demonstrated its ability to differentiate gene expression, which assumes certain specificity. Here we show that Dps has a different affinity for the two DNA fragments taken from the dps gene regulatory region. We found by atomic force microscopy that Dps predominantly occupies thermodynamically unstable ends of linear double-stranded DNA fragments and has high affinity to the central part of the branched DNA molecule self-assembled from three single-stranded oligonucleotides. It was proposed that Dps prefers binding to those regions in DNA that provide more contact pads for the triad of its DNA-binding bundle associated with one vertex of the protein globule. To our knowledge, this is the first study revealed the nucleoid protein with an affinity to branched DNA typical for genomic regions with direct and inverted repeats. As a ubiquitous feature of bacterial and eukaryotic genomes, such structural elements should be of particular care, but the protein system evolutionarily adapted for this function is not yet known, and we suggest Dps as a putative component of this system."
https://openalex.org/W228798924,"The immunoproteasome is upregulated by disease, oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokines, suggesting an expanded role for the immunoproteasome in stress signaling that goes beyond its canonical role in generating peptides for antigen presentation. The signaling pathways that are regulated by the immunoproteasome remain elusive. However, previous studies suggest a role for the immunoproteasome in the regulation of PTEN and NF-κB signaling. One well-known pathway upstream of NF-κB and downstream of PTEN is the Akt signaling pathway, which is responsible for mediating cellular survival and is modulated after optic nerve crush (ONC). This study investigated the role of retinal immunoproteasome after injury induced by ONC, focusing on the Akt cell survival pathway. Retinas or retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells from wild type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice lacking either one (LMP2) or two (LMP7 and MECL-1) catalytic subunits of the immunoproteasome were utilized in this study. We show that mRNA and protein levels of the immunoproteasome subunits are significantly upregulated in WT retinas following ONC. Mice lacking the immunoproteasome subunits show either a delayed or dampened apoptotic response as well as altered Akt signaling, compared to WT mice after ONC. Treatment of the RPE cells with insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to stimulate Akt signaling confirmed that the immunoproteasome modulates this pathway, and most likely modulates parallel pathways as well. This study links the inducible expression of the immunoproteasome following retinal injury to Akt signaling, which is important in many disease pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2220942228,"The autoimmune regulator (AIRE) is expressed in the thymus, particularly in thymic medullary epithelial cells (mTECs), and is required for the ectopic expression of a diverse range of peripheral tissue antigens by mTECs, facilitating their ability to perform negative selection of auto-reactive immature T-cells. The expression profile of peripheral tissue antigens is affected not only by AIRE deficiency but also with variation of AIRE activity in the thymus.Therefore we screened 591bp upstream of the AIRE transcription start site including AIRE minimal promoter for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and identified two SNPs -655R (rs117557896) and -230Y (rs751032) respectively. To study the effect of these variations on AIRE promoter activity we generated a Flp-In host cell line which was stably transfected with a single copy of the reporter vector. Relative promoter activity was estimated by comparing the luciferase specific activity for lysates of the different reporter AIRE promoter-reporter gene constructs including AIRE-655G AIRE-230C, AIRE-655G AIRE-230T and AIRE-655A AIRE-230C. The analysis showed that the commonest haplotype AIRE-655G AIRE-230C has the highest luciferase specific activity (p<0.001). Whereas AIRE-655G AIRE-230T has a luciferase specific activity value that approaches null. Both AIRE promoter polymorphic sites have one allele that forms a CpG methylation site which we determined can be methylated in methylation assays using the M.SssI CpG methyltransferase.AIRE-230Y is in a conserved region of the promoter and is adjacent to a predicted WT1 transcription factor binding site, suggesting that AIRE-230Y affects AIRE expression by influencing the binding of biochemical factors to this region. Our findings show that AIRE-655GAIRE-230T haplotype could dramatically alter AIRE transcription and so have an effect on the process of negative selection and affect susceptibility to autoimmune conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1908651185,"Conficker is a computer worm that erupted on the Internet in 2008. It is unique in combining three different spreading strategies: local probing, neighbourhood probing, and global probing. We propose a mathematical model that combines three modes of spreading: local, neighbourhood, and global, to capture the worm's spreading behaviour. The parameters of the model are inferred directly from network data obtained during the first day of the Conficker epidemic. The model is then used to explore the tradeoff between spreading modes in determining the worm's effectiveness. Our results show that the Conficker epidemic is an example of a critically hybrid epidemic, in which the different modes of spreading in isolation do not lead to successful epidemics. Such hybrid spreading strategies may be used beneficially to provide the most effective strategies for promulgating information across a large population. When used maliciously, however, they can present a dangerous challenge to current internet security protocols."
https://openalex.org/W1520194817,"In mouse cerebral corticogenesis, neurons are generated from radial glial cells (RGCs) or from their immediate progeny, intermediate neuronal precursors (INPs). The balance between self-renewal of these neuronal precursors and specification of cell fate is critical for proper cortical development, but the signaling mechanisms that regulate this progression are poorly understood. EphA4, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily, is expressed in RGCs during embryogenesis. To illuminate the function of EphA4 in RGC cell fate determination during early corticogenesis, we deleted Epha4 in cortical cells at E11.5 or E13.5. Loss of EphA4 at both stages led to precocious in vivo RGC differentiation toward neurogenesis. Cortical cells isolated at E14.5 and E15.5 from both deletion mutants showed reduced capacity for neurosphere formation with greater differentiation toward neurons. They also exhibited lower phosphorylation of ERK and FRS2α in the presence of FGF. The size of the cerebral cortex at P0 was smaller than that of controls when Epha4 was deleted at E11.5 but not when it was deleted at E13.5, although the cortical layers were formed normally in both mutants. The number of PAX6-positive RGCs decreased at later developmental stages only in the E11.5 Epha4 deletion mutant. These results suggest that EphA4, in cooperation with an FGF signal, contributes to the maintenance of RGC self-renewal and repression of RGC differentiation through the neuronal lineage. This function of EphA4 is especially critical and uncompensated in early stages of corticogenesis, and thus deletion at E11.5 reduces the size of the neonatal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1559959295,"Early in my scientific career, I pursued research while remaining blissfully unaware of the difficulty of securing a permanent academic position, especially for women and mothers. I drifted happily through a Ph.D. and two postdocs abroad, guided by interesting science, people, and places—and a nonscientist husband with ideas about where he wanted to live. It wasn't until I had been a postdoc for several years, with two children and a third on the way, that I recognized the need to adopt a sound strategic approach to securing a tenured faculty position, particularly given my career breaks.

“I wanted to make sure I was judged fairly.” 

ILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER

For each of my three sons—born in 2009, 2011, and 2013—I took 8 months of maternity leave, and since then I've worked largely part time and continue to do so. Counted over calendar years, these breaks make my track record look ordinary. My early job applications—using a standard CV that mentioned my maternity leaves only in passing—reflected the apparent ordinariness of that track record: I didn't get so much as an interview. Then, with mentoring and advice from colleagues and friends, I reshaped my CV to account for the time I'd spent raising my family. I put my career breaks front and center, and I reported my productivity metrics to account for my time away from work. Numbers of publications, citation rates, and grant income are used widely to assess and compare researchers, so I wanted to make sure I was judged fairly.

The result: My first application after I made the adjustments yielded a tenured position in the city we had already settled in. Reframing my track record undoubtedly helped. Here's how I did it.

Get the data. First, I calculated how many years of full-time equivalent work I've done by tallying the time worked each month (e.g., 0% when on maternity leave, 60% when working part time, and 100% when working full time). Accounting for time off and part-time work, I've worked 5.6 full-time years during the 8.5 calendar years since I finished my Ph.D., the equivalent of 66% of full time. Since my first child was born 6 years ago, I have worked the equivalent of 3.3 full-time years, or 55% of full time. Next, I worked out how much I'd achieved each year in terms of publications, grants, student supervision, and so on.

Do the math. Rather than hoping the readers of my application would do the math on their own, I did it for them. I corrected the number of publications I had each year to account for my maternity leaves. For example, in the 6 years since my first son was born I had 23 publications—equivalent to about 42 publications if I had been working full time. Similar corrections can be made to other common metrics: citations, grants, and so on.

Write about career interruptions up front and in a positive way. I present the data on career breaks, effective years worked, and achievements at the top of my CV, in cover letters for job applications, and in a prominent position on grant applications. Here's an example: “Since 2009, I have worked the equivalent of approximately 3.3 full-time years, 55% of full time. Yet it has been a highly productive period: 23 publications—including 12 as lead or last author—a research fellowship, and a major grant. On a pro-rata basis, that equates to about 42 publications in 6 years of full-time work.”

I also like to emphasize—without complaining—that working part time while raising kids isn't easy. “This does not account for the effect reduced working hours and travel opportunities has on networking opportunities, which affect collaborations and citation rates. I have nonetheless established several fruitful national and international collaborations, and my research has scientific and practical impacts.” I want readers to think, “If she managed this working part time, with breaks and sleep deprivation, imagine what she'll do once the kids are older!”

https://openalex.org/W276548197,"This study attempted to clarify the material basis for the detoxification of Rhizoma Zingiberis (RZ) on aconitine, an analgesic drug, by quantitatively assessing the influence of RZ on the in vitro intestinal concentration of aconitine using an everted gut sac model and by qualitatively identifying the components in the RZ extract. To quantify aconitine in rat everted gut sacs, both an accurate processing method and a sensitive detection method were required. We developed a three-step sample processing method to protect the components from decomposition and applied ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC/TQMS) to quantify aconitine, glucose and digoxin. In addition, ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with linear ion trap mass spectrometry (UPLC/ITMS) was applied to detect the potential antidotal components in the RZ extract. Finally, the RZ extract reduced the level of aconitine in everted gut sacs, and eleven gingerols were successfully identified, which could be considered potential antidotal components for aconitine. This study demonstrated the application of two UPLC/MS methods for analyzing the material basis for the reciprocity between Chinese medicine components in everted gut sacs."
https://openalex.org/W2338453324,"Peripheral immune regulation depends on the generation of thymic-derived regulatory T (tTreg) cells to maintain self-tolerance and to counterbalance overshooting immune responses. The expression of the Treg lineage defining transcription factor Foxp3 in developing tTreg cells depends on TCR signaling during the thymic selection process of these T cells. In this study, we surprisingly identify Foxp3+ immature thymocytes at the double-negative (DN) stage in transcription factor 7 (Tcf7)-deficient mice. These Foxp3+ cells did not express a TCR (β or γδ chains), CD3 or CD5 and therefore these cells were true DN cells. Further investigation of this phenomenon in a transgenic TCR model showed that Foxp3-expressing DN cells could not respond to TCR stimulation in vivo. These data suggest that Foxp3 expression in these DN cells occurred independently of TCR signaling. Interestingly, these Foxp3+ DN cells were located in a transition state between DN1 and DN2 (CD4-CD8-CD3-TCR-CD44highCD25low). Our results indicate that Tcf7 is involved in preventing the premature expression of Foxp3 in DN thymocytes."

Creating a global finance mechanism, ideally tied to existing global health frameworks, is a first step. The World Bank recently announced it would create a Pandemic Emergency Facility (PEF). The next necessary element is a trigger to release those funds to support rapid and effective responses during early phases of a public health event. With the World Health Assembly convening soon, we suggest how the World Health Organization's (WHO's) International Health Regulations (IHR) present such an initiator."
