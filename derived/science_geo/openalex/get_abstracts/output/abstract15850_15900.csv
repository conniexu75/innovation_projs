https://openalex.org/W2029790299,"Angiogenic factors produced by monocytes-macrophages are involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory disorders characterized by persistent angiogenesis. The possibility was tested that interleukin-8 (IL-8), which is a cytokine that is chemotactic for lymphocytes and neutrophils, is also angiogenic. Human recombinant IL-8 was potently angiogenic when implanted in the rat cornea and induced proliferation and chemotaxis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Angiogenic activity present in the conditioned media of inflamed human rheumatoid synovial tissue macrophages or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated blood monocytes was equally blocked by antibodies to either IL-8 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. An IL-8 antisense oligonucleotide specifically blocked the production of monocyte-induced angiogenic activity. These data suggest a function for macrophage-derived IL-8 in angiogenesis-dependent disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, tumor growth, and wound repair."

https://openalex.org/W2067626539,"Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induces the transcription of the gene encoding a guanylate binding protein by activating a latent cytoplasmic factor, GAF (gamma-activated factor). GAF is translocated to the nucleus and binds a DNA element, the gamma-activated site. Through cross-linking and the use of specific antibodies GAF was found to be a 91-kilodalton DNA binding protein that was previously identified as one of four proteins in interferon-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF-3), a transcription complex activated by IFN-alpha. The IFN-gamma-dependent activation of the 91-kilodalton DNA binding protein required cytoplasmic phosphorylation of the protein on tyrosine. The 113-kilodalton ISGF-3 protein that is phosphorylated in response to IFN-alpha was not phosphorylated nor translocated to the nucleus in response to IFN-gamma. Thus the two different ligands result in tyrosine phosphorylation of different combinations of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that then act at different DNA binding sites."

https://openalex.org/W2028926788,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder of unknown aetiology that affects numerous body systems including skin, brain and kidneys. Some TSC has been linked to chromosome 9, additional TSC genes on chromosomes 11 and 12 have been proposed, but the majority of TSC families remain unlinked. Using TSC families in which data had excluded linkage to chromosome 9, we failed to detect linkage with loci on chromosomes 11, 12 and others. One marker examined was D16S283, the closest locus on the proximal side of the polycystic kidney disease type 1 (PKD1) gene. Linkage between TSC and D16S283 demonstrated a lod score of 9.50 at theta = 0.02 with one family independently presenting a lod score of 4.44 at theta = 0.05. These data reveal an important TSC locus near the region of PKD1 on chromosome 16p13."

https://openalex.org/W2044070030,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules bind and deliver peptides derived from endogenously synthesized proteins to the cell surface for survey by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. It is believed that endogenous antigens are generally degraded in the cytosol, the resulting peptides being translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum where they bind to MHC class I molecules. Transporters containing an ATP-binding cassette encoded by the MHC class II region seem to be responsible for this transport. Genes coding for two subunits of the '20S' proteasome (a multicatalytic proteinase) have been found in the vicinity of the two transporter genes in the MHC class II region, indicating that the proteasome could be the unknown proteolytic entity in the cytosol involved in the generation of MHC class I-binding peptides. By introducing rat genes encoding the MHC-linked transporters into a human cell line lacking both transporter and proteasome subunit genes, we show here that the MHC-encoded proteasome subunit are not essential for stable MHC class I surface expression, or for processing and presentation of antigenic peptides from influenza virus and an intracellular protein."

https://openalex.org/W2063947982,"U14 snRNA is a small nucleolar RNA species essential for eukaryotic pre-rRNA processing. We have previously shown that the mouse U14 snRNA genes are positioned within introns 5, 6, and 8 on the coding strand of the constitutively expressed cognate hsc70 heat shock gene. This genomic organization suggested the possibility that U14 snRNAs are transcribed as part of the hsc70 pre-mRNA and then excised from the intron to yield mature U14 snRNA species. To test this hypothesis directly, we have microinjected Xenopus oocytes with hsc70 pre-mRNA transcripts possessing intron 5 and the encoded U14 snRNA sequence. Processing results demonstrate that, in addition to the splicing of upstream and downstream exons, a mature 87 nt U14 snRNA is excised from the intron. Accurate excision of U14 snRNA from hsc70 intron 5 can occur in the absence of splicing. These results demonstrate a biosynthetic pathway for an snRNA species and provide a novel example of a eukaryotic pre-mRNA intron that is processed to produce a stable, biologically functional RNA species."
https://openalex.org/W2383231537,"Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is the prototype for a family of at least eight neutrophil chemoattractants whose genes map to human chromosome 4q13-q21. Two human IL-8 receptors, IL8RA and IL8RB, are known from cDNA cloning; IL8RA is a promiscuous receptor for at least two other related ligands, GRO alpha and NAP-2. We now report cloning of the genes for IL8RA, IL8RB and a recently inactivated pseudogene of receptor A (IL8RAP). These form a cluster of only three genes in the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and map to 2q34-q35. The coevolutionary diversity displayed by the IL-8 ligand-receptor complex--ligand promiscuity for IL-8, receptor promiscuity for IL8RA, gene duplication for both ligands and receptors and gene extinction in the case of IL8RAP--is unprecedented for the GPCR superfamily."

https://openalex.org/W2094628601,"Two major developmentally regulated isoforms of the Drosophila chorion transcription factor CF2 differ by an extra zinc finger within the DNA binding domain. The preferred DNA binding sites were determined and are distinguished by an internal duplication of TAT in the site recognized by the isoform with the extra finger. The results are consistent with modular interactions between zinc fingers and trinucleotides and also suggest rules for recognition of AT-rich DNA sites by zinc finger proteins. The results show how modular finger interactions with trinucleotides can be used, in conjunction with alternative splicing, to alter the binding specificity and increase the spectrum of sites recognized by a DNA binding domain. Thus, CF2 may potentially regulate distinct sets of target genes during development."
