https://openalex.org/W2036362108,"The apolipoprotein E type 4 allele (APOE-epsilon 4) is genetically associated with the common late onset familial and sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Risk for AD increased from 20% to 90% and mean age at onset decreased from 84 to 68 years with increasing number of APOE-epsilon 4 alleles in 42 families with late onset AD. Thus APOE-epsilon 4 gene dose is a major risk factor for late onset AD and, in these families, homozygosity for APOE-epsilon 4 was virtually sufficient to cause AD by age 80."
https://openalex.org/W2064416689,"Olfaction is a versatile and sensitive mechanism for detecting volatile odorants. We show that the nematode C. elegans detects many volatile chemicals, which can be attractants, repellents, or attractants at low concentrations and repellents at high concentrations. Through laser ablation, we have identified chemosensory neurons that detect volatile odorants. Chemotaxis to volatile odorants requires different sensory neurons from chemotaxis to water-soluble attractants, indicating that C. elegans might have senses that correspond to smell and taste, respectively. Single neurons have complex sensory properties, since six distinguishable volatile odorants are sensed by only two types of sensory neurons. Chemotaxis to subsets of volatile odorants is disrupted by mutations in the odr genes, which might be involved in odorant sensation or signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2040029402,"We have characterized an element near the 5' boundary of the chicken beta-globin domain that insulates a reporter gene from the activating effects of a nearby beta-globin locus control region (5'HS2) when assayed in the human erythroid cell line K562. We show that the insulation mechanism is directional, that it operates at the level of transcription, and that it involves the alteration of chromatin structure over the promoter of the gene. The insulator has no significant stimulatory or inhibitory effects of its own. In transgenic Drosophila, the insulator protects the white minigene from position effects. The action of the insulator thus is not restricted to erythroid or mammalian cells, suggesting that such elements may serve an important and widely distributed function in the organization of chromatin structure."
https://openalex.org/W2122689321,"A genetic algorithm is a form of evolution that occurs on a computer. Genetic algorithms are a search method that can be used for both solving problems and modeling evolutionary systems. With various mapping techniques and an appropriate measure of fitness, a genetic algorithm can be tailored to evolve a solution for many types of problems, including optimization of a function of determination of the proper order of a sequence. Mathematical analysis has begun to explain how genetic algorithms work and how best to use them. Recently, genetic algorithms have been used to model several natural evolutionary systems, including immune systems."
https://openalex.org/W1545295983,"Mast cells release the mediators of the immediate hypersensitivity reaction. Adenosine is known to modulate this process, but the receptor responsible for this is not the classical A1 or A2 adenosine receptors. This study was undertaken to determine whether the unique adenosine receptor (AR) previously postulated in a cultured mast cell line (RBL-2H3 cells) is the recently cloned A3AR. The receptors were quantitated by the agonist 125I-labeled APNEA (aminophenylethyladenosine), an A3AR agonist, which yielded Bmax and Kd values of 826 fmol/mg protein and 34 nM, respectively. A variety of adenosine analogs competed for 125I-APNEA binding sites with the following potency series: (R)-phenylisopropyladenosine = 5'-N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine > (S)-phenylisopropyladenosine. 125I-APNEA binding was relatively insensitive to the xanthine amine congener (XAC, 1 microM), a selective antagonist for the A1AR. Functionally, activation of these A3AR stimulated the production of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, leading to an increase in the level of intracellular Ca2+. Furthermore, while activation of these receptors alone produced little secretory response in RBL-2H3 cells, it enhanced antigen-induced secretion by 2-2.5-fold. Northern blotting studies using poly(A+) RNA from RBL-2H3 cells detected two transcripts of 2.0 and 3.5 kilobases, which hybridized to an A3AR cDNA but not to the A1 or A2AR cDNA probes. These data indicate that the unique AR that potentiates the secretory response to antigen in RBL-2H3 cells is exclusively the A3AR."
https://openalex.org/W2019918282,"The wee1 tyrosine kinase and cdc25 tyrosine phosphatase of fission yeast play antagonistic roles in the induction of mitosis through cdc2 regulation. We show here that the human wee1-like tyrosine kinase is a nuclear protein that ensures the completion of DNA replication prior to mitosis in cells expressing otherwise catastrophic levels of cdc2 activators. Paradoxically, wee1-rescued cells display very high levels of mitotic cdc2 kinase activity. We account for this anomaly by our observation that the cdc2 activator, cdc25C, is a cytoplasmic protein that, like cyclin B1, enters the nucleus at the G2/M transition. Thus, cdc2 is likely to be activated in the cytoplasm and requires nuclear localization to initiate both cytoplasmic and nuclear mitotic transformations. The human wee1 kinase appears to coordinate the transition between DNA replication and mitosis by protecting the nucleus from this cytoplasmically activated cdc2 kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1993154580,"Vg1 is a TGF beta-related growth factor encoded by a maternal mRNA localized to vegetal blastomeres in Xenopus embryos. Vg1 precursor protein is abundant in vegetal cells, but the processed mature form has not been readily detected and no activity has been demonstrated for the putative Vg1 mature protein. We have engineered a BMP2-Vg1 fusion (BVg1) that promotes formation of mature Vg1 protein in vivo. Injection of BVg1 mRNA induces dorsal mesoderm in animal cap cells, and BVg1 expression in ultraviolet-ventralized embryos fully restores a normal dorsal axis. Blastomeres expressing BVg1 act as a Nieuwkoop center, the region that induces the Spemann organizer. our results lead us to suggest that localized posttranslational processing of Vg1 precursor protein on the future dorsal side of the embryo is a key step in generating dorsal mesoderm and the body axis in Xenopus."
https://openalex.org/W2064675349,"T cells detect infection of cells by recognizing peptide fragments of foreign proteins bound to class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the surface of the infected cell. MHC class I molecules bind peptide in the endoplasmic reticulum, and analysis of mutant cells has demonstrated that an adequate supply of peptides requires the presence of two genes in the MHC class II locus that encode proteins called transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP) 1 and 2. TAP1 and TAP2 are members of the ATP-binding cassette family of membrane translocators. In this study, we demonstrate in a cell-free system that TAP1 is part of an ATP-dependent, sequence-specific, peptide translocator."
https://openalex.org/W2064894017,"To identify and characterize tissue remodeling processes mediated by macrophages, we have generated transgenic mice in which diphtheria toxin is expressed from a macrophage-specific transgene. Expression of the transgene disrupts subsets of mature macrophages in both the eye and the peritoneal cavity and results in the persistence of two normally transient ocular tissues, the hyaloid vasculature and the pupillary membrane. Furthermore, the cells comprising the pupillary membrane appear alive up to 14 days after the structure is normally remodeled, suggesting that the macrophage actively elicits target cell death. Thus, these transgenic mice provide direct evidence for the active involvement of macrophages in developmentally programmed tissue remodeling and identify the hyaloid vessels and the pupillary membrane in the eye as targets of macrophage-mediated remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W1528949927,"Substrate specificity determinants of human acetylcholinesterase (HuAChE) were identified by combination of molecular modeling and kinetic studies with enzymes mutated in residues Trp-86, Trp-286, Phe-295, Phe-297, Tyr-337, and Phe-338. The substitution of Trp-86 by alanine resulted in a 660-fold decrease in affinity for acetythiocholine but had no effect on affinity for the isosteric uncharged substrate (3,3-dimethylbutylthioacetate). The results demonstrate that residue Trp-86 is the anionic site which binds, through cation-pi interactions, the quaternary ammonium of choline, and that of active center inhibitors such as edrophonium. The results also suggest that in the non-covalent complex, charged and uncharged substrates with a common acyl moiety (acetyl) bind to different molecular environments. The hydrophobic site for the alcoholic portion of the covalent adduct (tetrahedral intermediate) includes residues Trp-86, Tyr-337, and Phe-338, which operate through nonpolar and/or stacking interactions, depending on the substrate. Substrates containing choline but differing in the acyl moiety (acetyl, propyl, and butyryl) revealed that residues Phe-295 and Phe-297 determine substrate specificity of the acyl pocket for the covalent adducts. Phe-295 also determines substrate specificity in the non-covalent enzyme substrate complex and thus, the HuAChE F295A mutant exhibits over 130-fold increase in the apparent bimolecular rate constant for butyrylthiocholine compared with wild type enzyme. Reactivity toward specific butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors is similarly dependent on the nature of residues at positions 295 and 297. Amino acid Trp-286 at the rim of the active site gorge and Trp-86, in the active center, are essential elements in the mechanism of inhibition by propidium, a peripheral anionic site ligand. Molecular modeling and kinetic data suggest that a cross-talk between Trp-286 and Trp-86 can result in reorientation of Trp-86 which may then interfere with stabilization of substrate enzyme complexes. It is proposed that the conformational flexibility of aromatic residues generates a plasticity in the active center that contributes to the high efficiency of AChE and its ability to respond to external stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W1984094934,"In a number of cell types, epidermal growth factor (EGF) evokes dramatic morphological changes, cortical actin polymerization, and stress fiber breakdown. The molecular processes by which increased EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity results in actin reorganization and morphological changes are unresolved. Recently, we demonstrated that arachidonic acid metabolites function in EGF signal transduction. We now report that in A431 cells, HeLa cells, and rat-1 fibroblasts, the EGF-induced cortical actin polymerization is produced by lipoxygenase metabolism, whereas in these cells stress fiber breakdown is mediated by cyclooxygenase metabolites. Also, the EGF-provoked rounding up in A431 cells is dependent on arachidonic acid metabolism. We conclude that leukotrienes and prostaglandins act in concert, as second messengers, to produce morphological effects and actin reorganization, providing a novel mechanism for directing growth factor-induced cytoskeletal changes."

https://openalex.org/W2081981294,"Most Bacillus tRNA synthetase genes are regulated by a common transcription antitermination mechanism but respond individually to limitation for the cognate amino acid. The mRNA leader regions of these genes exhibit extensive structural conservation, with a single codon specific for the appropriate amino acid at the identical position in each structure. Alteration of this sequence in the tyrS gene from UAC (tyrosine) to UUC (phenylalanine) resulted in loss of induction by tyrosine limitation and a switch to induction by phenylalanine limitation. Insertion of an extra base immediately upstream of the codon did not alter regulation, indicating a nontranslational mechanism. A nonsense codon resulted in an uninducible phenotype that was suppressible in a lysyl-tRNA nonsense suppressor mutant, indicating that tRNA acts as an effector."
https://openalex.org/W2011273569,"The peptide alpha 4 is a designed four-helix bundle that contains a highly simplified hydrophobic core composed exclusively of leucine residues; its tertiary structure is therefore largely dictated by hydrophobic forces. This small protein adopts a structure with properties intermediate between those of the native and molten globule states of proteins: it is compact, globular, and has very stable helices, but its apolar side chains are mobile and not as well packed as in many natural proteins. To induce a more native-like state, two Zn(2+)-binding sites were introduced into the protein, thereby replacing some of the non-specific hydrophobic interactions with more geometrically restrictive metal-ligand interactions. In the metal-bound state, this protein has properties that approach those of native proteins. Thus, hydrophobic interactions alone are sufficient to drive polypeptide chain folding nearly to completion, but specific interactions are required for a unique structure."

After the first cleavage of the C. elegans embryo, only the posterior blastomere, P1, has a cell-intrinsic ability to produce pharyngeal cells. The product of the maternal gene skn-1 is required for P1 to produce pharyngeal cells. We show here that the Skn-1 protein is nuclear localized and that P1 appears to accumulate markedly higher levels of Skn-1 protein than its sister, the AB blastomere. We have examined the distribution of Skn-1 protein in embryos from mothers with maternal-effect mutations in the genes mex-1, par-1, and pie-1. These results suggest that mex-1(+) and par-1(+) activities are required for the unequal distribution of the Skn-1 protein and that pie-1(+) activity may function to regulate the activity of Skn-1 protein in the descendants of the posterior blastomere P1.

https://openalex.org/W1561712938,"What kind of peptide sequences can be cleaved by HIV protease, and what kind cannot be? This is a crucially important problem in designing effective inhibitors against HIV protease as potential drugs for AIDS therapy. To tackle this problem, a sequence-coupling and vectorized model is proposed for predicting the cleavability of oligopeptides by proteases with multiple and extended specificity subsites. In comparison with existing methods, the new method has proved to be an improvement in both the accuracy of the model and the rationality of the statistical treatment. Meanwhile, the Monte Carlo sampling procedure introduced here has also proved to be very useful in dealing with the situation when the experimental data are insufficiently sampled for complete statistics. Owing to its very high rate of correct prediction, it is expected that the new method can be a useful technique for helping to find effective inhibitors of HIV protease, which is one of the targets in designing potential drugs against AIDS. The principle of the new method can also be applied to analyzing the specificity of any multi-subsite enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2022785862,"Proteins that shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm are implicated in transport and signal transduction processes. Using assays based on interspecies heterokaryons and microinjection of Xenopus oocytes, we examined what structural features determine nuclear export of shuttling proteins. Three classes of proteins were studied: first, wild-type and mutant forms of nucleolin, one of the first shuttling proteins identified; second, artificial nuclear reporter proteins derived from cytoplasmic pyruvate kinase; and third, wild-type and mutant lamins differing in their abilities to be incorporated into the lamina. Our results show that a protein does not require positively acting export signals to be transported from nucleus to cytoplasm; instead, its shuttling ability is limited primarily by intranuclear interactions. We conclude that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is a general phenomenon not restricted to proteins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport."
https://openalex.org/W2007195150,"The receptor complex in the mitochondrial outer membrane, which consists of at least seven different proteins, is responsible for the recognition and translocation of cytosolically synthesized preproteins. Two of its subunits, MOM19 and MOM72, function as surface receptors for preproteins. Four other subunits (MOM38, MOM30, MOM8, and MOM7) have been suggested to constitute the general insertion pore (GIP). Here we report on the structure and function of MOM22. MOM22 is anchored in the outer membrane by a single transmembrane segment. The highly negatively charged N-terminal domain is exposed to the cytosol and the C-terminal domain to the intermembrane space. MOM22 appears to be a central component of the receptor complex, required for the transfer of preproteins from the receptors to the GIP. We speculate that the negatively charged domain of MOM22 is involved in the transfer of positively charged signal sequences of preproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1497214669,"Most of what is known of the Egr-1 DNA binding site GCGGGGGCG was originally identified by experiments using DNA sequences and bacterially expressed or in vitro translated EGR-1 protein. Here we report the binding of cellular EGR-1 protein derived from HeLa, mouse and human fibroblasts to its consensus sequence. Binding is strongly but transiently stimulated in these cells by serum, phorbol ester, or by okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein serine/threonine phosphatases 1 and 2A, suggesting the regulation of this gene expression and its DNA binding activity to be under the control of protein kinase(s) and phosphatase(s). When EGR-1 synthesis is stimulated under the above conditions, binding of the transcription factor Sp1 to its recognition site in the Egr-1 promoter is reduced with a concomitant appearance of EGR-1 DNA binding. This is likely a result of competition between Sp1 and the newly synthesized EGR-1, since there is a partial overlap in the binding sequences recognized by these proteins. In cotransfection experiments EGR-1 activated transcription through multiple copies of GCGGGGGCG 5' to a minimum promoter of c-fos. Interestingly, EGR-1 is shown to down-regulate the transcription of its own gene expression, whereas Sp1 activated Egr-1 gene expression. The detection of cellular EGR-1 binding to the Egr-1 consensus sequence in the different cell types provides a model for studying the mechanism by which an immediate-early gene is regulated by various ligands."

Here, it is shown that members of the C6 zinc cluster family of yeast transcriptional activators distinguish related DNA sites by a different mechanism. The DNA binding site for each of these proteins contains identical nucleotide triplets (CGG ... CCG) but differs in the spacings between the triplets. It is shown that zinc clusters of these proteins work interchangeably to recognize the conserved triplets and that the region 19 amino acids to the carboxyl-terminal side of the zinc cluster, comprising the linker and the beginning of a dimerization element as inferred from the GAL4 crystal structure, directs the protein to its preferred site."

The purification procedure involved ammonium sulfate fractionation, Sephadex G-50 gel filtration, cation exchange chromatography on CM-Sephadex, and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a C-18 Vydac column. Four forms of the protein were separated by the cation exchange and reverse phase chromatography steps. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry of the four proteins revealed masses of 9550 +/- 1, 9596 +/- 1.2, 9858 +/- 1.3, and 9898 +/- 1.1 daltons. Glutamate, glycine, lysine, leucine, and valine are the major amino acids in this protein. About 0.92 g atoms of selenium was found per g mol of protein, and this selenium was present as selenocysteine. Thus, this appears to be a new selenoprotein, and we have named it selenoprotein W."
https://openalex.org/W1603668575,"Neutrophils possess a multicomponent NADPH-oxidase that produces large quantities of superoxide, which can in turn generate other reactive oxygen intermediates. Superoxide and its dismutation product, hydrogen peroxide, are powerful oxidants. Because the activity of certain tyrosine kinases and phosphatases can be affected by their redox state, we considered the possibility that endogenously generated reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) may alter phosphotyrosine formation and thereby function as intra- or intercellular messengers in neutrophils. Exposure of human neutrophils to exogenous oxidants such as diamide induced marked tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins. More importantly, activation of the NADPH oxidase in permeabilized neutrophils, by direct stimulation of GTP-binding proteins, also resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation. The latter was NADPH-dependent, paralleled by production of superoxide, and was inhibited by diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of the flavoprotein component of the oxidase. Neutrophils, from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease, which are deficient in the production of ROI, demonstrated no such phosphotyrosine accumulation. We conclude that ROI produced by the NADPH oxidase can regulate tyrosine phosphorylation in granulocytes, possibly by effects of oxidation-sensitive tyrosine kinases and/or phosphatases."
https://openalex.org/W66891075,"Arrestins play an important role in regulating the activity of the G protein-coupled receptors rhodopsin and the beta 2-adrenergic receptor. Recently, we described the expression and functional characterization of visual arrestin using an in vitro translation system. Here we report the expression of beta-arrestin and development of a direct binding assay to study the interaction of arrestins with a muscarinic cholinergic receptor. In vitro translated beta-arrestin was found to specifically bind to purified reconstituted human m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (hm2 mAChR) in an agonist- and phosphorylation-dependent manner. Visual arrestin also bound to the hm2 mAChR, albeit to a lesser extent and with lower affinity. In an attempt to dissect the major domains responsible for determining the receptor binding specificity of arrestin and beta-arrestin, we generated several chimeric arrestins. One contained the first 340 residues of beta-arrestin followed by residues 346-404 of arrestin (BRV4), another consisted of the first 207 residues of beta-arrestin and residues 214-404 of visual arrestin (BV3), and a third had residues 1-43 of beta-arrestin replaced by residues 1-47 of arrestin (VIN1). All of these arrestins were able to specifically bind to the activated and phosphorylated form of both the hm2 mAChR and rhodopsin, with a clear preference for the muscarinic receptor. The Kd values for beta-arrestin, BRV4, BV3, VIN1, and visual arrestin binding to the hm2 mAChR were 0.48 +/- 0.06, 0.51 +/- 0.19, 1.38 +/- 0.26, 1.13 +/- 0.26, and 7.2 +/- 1.2 nM, respectively. These data demonstrate that: 1) beta-arrestin binds to the hm2 mAChR in an activation- and phosphorylation-dependent fashion, 2) visual arrestin has 15-fold lower affinity for the hm2 mAChR as compared to beta-arrestin, and 3) the N-terminal half of beta-arrestin plays a key role in determining receptor binding specificity. The use of in vitro translated arrestins to directly assess receptor binding may serve as a viable approach for elucidating the specificity and molecular mechanisms involved in receptor-arrestin interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1572726437,"Our previous studies have suggested that a derivative of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), HGF/NK2, containing the coding sequences for the N-terminal hairpin and first two kringle domains, is sufficient to mediate high affinity binding to the HGF receptor. Here, we wished to test directly whether HGF/NK1 (N-terminal hairpin and first kringle domains) could bind the receptor and/or mediate receptor signaling. HGF/NK1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity using heparin-affinity and fast protein liquid cation-exchange chromatography. Biological characterization of HGF/NK1 showed that it can compete for binding to the HGF receptor on human lung carcinoma A549 cells and to a soluble form of the HGF receptor. HGF/NK1 is inefficient at promoting autophosphorylation of the HGF receptor, although some activity was detected at very high concentrations. HGF/NK1 fails to exhibit mitogenic properties even at very high concentrations. However, HGF/NK1 can act as a potent competitive antagonist in this assay. Our data demonstrate directly that a receptor binding determinant of HGF is located within the N-terminal 32-212 residues of HGF. HGF/NK1 will serve as a powerful tool for (i) generating neutralizing antibodies, (ii) in determining x-ray crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance structures, and (iii) for in vivo studies as an HGF antagonist."

Early steps in signaling through the zeta chain of the TCR were examined in transfected COS-1 cells. Coexpression of the PTK p59fynT, but not p56lck, with zeta or with a homodimeric TCR beta-zeta fusion protein produced tyrosine phosphorylation of both zeta and phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma 1, as well as calcium ion mobilization in response to receptor cross-linking. CD45 coexpression enhanced these effects. No requirement for the PTKZAP-70 was observed. Thus, p59fynT may link zeta directly to the PLC-gamma 1 activation pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1586732387,"We have previously cloned a segment of a gene, ABR, homologous to the BCR gene, which encodes a protein consisting of three distinct functional domains.

These are predicted to encode proteins of 93.5 and 92.3 kDa molecular mass. ABR showed a differential expression pattern in various mouse tissues, analogous to that of BCR, and the highest level was found in brain. Similar to BCR, ABR contains a region with homology to DBL, vav, and CDC24, which are likely to or have been shown to encode GTP exchange factors. A domain of ABR with similarity to GAPrho was expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli and was shown to have GAP activity toward rac. Although both ABR and BCR have GAP activity, ABR lacks homology to the serine/threonine kinase domain of BCR. Therefore, ABR is likely to have cellular functions overlapping with but also distinct from those of BCR."
https://openalex.org/W1576592272,"Asn-linked oligosaccharides terminating with the sequence SO4-4GalNAc beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1,2Man alpha (S4GGnM) are present on the glycoprotein hormones lutropin and thyrotropin, pro-opiomelanocortin, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor. The peptide motif ProXaaArg/Lys (PXR/K), which is recognized by a PXR/K-specific GalNAc-transferase, is present in each of these glycoproteins 6-9 residues NH2-terminal to an Asn glycosylation site. Both the PXR/K-specific GalNAc-transferase and a GalNAc beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1,2Man alpha (GGnM)-4-sulfotransferase are required for synthesis of the S4GGnM sequence. Glycoproteins which do not contain the PXR/K motif but bear Asn-linked oligosaccharides terminating with GGnM or sialic acid alpha 2,3/6GGnM have also been described, suggesting a distinct GalNAc-transferase may be responsible for their synthesis. We have examined a number of tissues and cultured cell lines for the transfer of sulfate to the trisaccharide acceptor GGnM and transfer of GalNAc to oligosaccharide acceptors on protein which do, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and do not, transferrin (Trf), contain the PXR/K motif. The PXR/K-specific GalNAc-transferase and the GGnM-4-sulfo-transferase are expressed in salivary gland, pituitary, lacrimal gland, kidney, and brain, and in the cell lines AtT-20, 293, SHSY5Y, and alpha T3. In contrast Bowes, EL-4, and B16L6 cell extracts transferred GalNAc to oligosaccharides acceptors on Trf but not on hCG. A number of tissues and cell lines displayed transfer of GalNAc to both hCG and to Trf suggesting that two distinct GalNAc-transferases were present. The GGnM-4-sulfotransferase was expressed in tissues and cell lines which expressed the PXR/K-specific GalNAc-transferase but not in cell lines expressing exclusively the Trf-specific GalNAc-transferase. Thus, the PXR/K-specific GalNAc-transferase and the GGnM-4-sulfotransferase are coordinately expressed in a number of tissues other than pituitary. The Trf-specific GalNAc-transferase may account for the presence of beta 1,4-linked GalNAc on glycoproteins which do not contain the PXR/K motif."
https://openalex.org/W1567962789,Using inverted Escherichia coli inner membrane vesicles we have analyzed the phosphatidylglycerol dependence of translocation of an OmpF-Lpp fusion protein carrying a signal sequence with varying positive charge at the N terminus and a hydrophobic core of varying length. It is shown that there is a direct relationship between the phosphatidylglycerol requirement of translocation and the requirement within the translocation process for positive charges on the signal sequence. This provides further evidence that the negative head group of the lipid is required for functional interaction with the positively charged N terminus of the signal sequence.
https://openalex.org/W1506565709,"Abstract The kinetics of binding of O2, CO, and NO to the octameric, two-domain hemoglobins of the parasitic nematodes Pseudoterranova decipiens and Ascaris suum were determined on nanosecond and picosecond time scales using flash photolysis. The two nematode hemoglobins have very similar kinetic properties. On the picosecond time scale, they exhibit an unusual behavior in showing a geminate reaction with oxygen that is biphasic and dependent on the flash intensity. The geminate reaction with NO is also faster and more complete than for sperm whale myoglobin; however, in contrast to the O2 reaction, it is homogeneous. In addition, the oxygen dissociation rate of P. decipiens hemoglobin, 0.0035 s-1, is as low as that of A. suum hemoglobin, 0.004 s-1 (Gibson, Q. H., and Smith, M. H. (1965) Proc. R. Soc. Lond.

The complete gene sequence (GenBank M96233) and the cDNA sequence (M96234) are reported and named GSTM4. The gene, located on chromosome 1, is comprised of eight exons with an organization similar to that of other Mu class genes. GSTM4 differs from a partial gene sequence, termed GSTmu2 (Taylor, J. B., Oliver, J., Sherrington, R., and Pemble, S. E. (1991) Biochem. J. 274, 587-593), in exons 3 through 5 by only 11 nucleotides within introns. The cDNA for GSTM4 was isolated from a library derived from the cervical carcinoma cell line, HeLa. Northern blots demonstrate the presence of GSTM4 mRNA in human heart, placenta, lung, brain, liver, skeletal muscle, pancreas, testis, cerebral cortex, uterus, ovary, a lymphoblastoid cell line, and four carcinoma cell lines.

https://openalex.org/W1571312504,"S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase, an enzyme important in the regulation of biological methylation reactions, was shown by McCarthy et al. (McCarthy, J.R., Jarvi, E.T., Matthews, D.P., Edwards, M.L., Prakash, N.J., Bowlin, T.L., Mehdi, S., and Bey, P. (1989) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111, 1127-1128) to be inactivated by (Z)-4',5'-didehydro-5'-deoxy-5'-fluoroadenosine (ZDDFA). In this study we have shown that the mechanism of this inactivation of AdoHcy hydrolase (NAD+ form) includes a rapid addition of water to the 5'-position of ZDDFA and elimination of fluoride ion, resulting in the formation of the 5'-carboxaldehydes 3 and 4. The 5'-carboxaldehydes 3 and 4 are then oxidized in a slower step to the 3'-keto-5'-carboxaldehydes 5 and 6 by reduction of the enzyme-bound NAD+ to NADH. Evidence in support of this mechanism includes the observation that the first step in this mechanism (i.e. elimination of fluoride ion and formation of the 5'-carboxaldehydes 3 and 4) can be catalyzed by apo-AdoHcy hydrolase and the NADH form of AdoHcy hydrolase. Incubation of ZDDFA with either the apo or NADH form of AdoHcy hydrolase resulted in rapid release of fluoride ion (determined by 19F NMR) and formation of the 5'-carboxyaldehydes 3 and 4 (determined by high performance liquid chromatography). The carboxaldehydes 3 and 4 were synthesized independently and were shown to be potent inhibitors of the NAD+ form of the enzyme. When the relative first-order rates of fluoride ion release (determined by 19F NMR) from ZDDFA, NAD+ reduction to NADH, and inactivation of the NAD+ form of the enzyme were compared, the release of fluoride ion was found to be approximately 20 times faster than NAD+ reduction or enzyme inactivation. Incubation of ZDDFA with the NAD+ form of AdoHcy hydrolase was shown to afford the 3'-keto-5'-carboxaldehydes 5 and 6, which were also formed upon incubation of the enzyme with the 5'-carboxaldehydes 3 and 4. The 3'-keto-5'-carboxaldehydes 5 and 6 were shown to be tightly (but not covalently) bound to the enzyme, since these products could be released by treatment of the ZDDFA-inactivated enzyme with HClO4 or other denaturing agents."
https://openalex.org/W1552843030,"In cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) beta receptor was expressed at a high level, whereas PDGF-alpha receptor was not detected. PDGF-BB showed a high binding activity at 4 degrees C in the cells and was not displaced by PDGF-AA or -AB. This result indicates that PDGF-AB as well as PDGF-AA does not bind to the cells lacking PDGF-alpha receptor at 4 degrees C. However, at 37 degrees C, PDGF-AB bound to the cells and induced the internalization of PDGF-beta receptor. DNA synthesis was also stimulated potentially by PDGF-AB as well as PDGF-BB in the cells, although PDGF-AA was completely inactive. At 37 degrees C, PDGF-AB caused tyrosine phosphorylation of a group of proteins including PDGF-beta receptor and phospholipase C-gamma 1, but at a slower rate than PDGF-BB. At 4 degrees C, PDGF-AB did not stimulate protein tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas PDGF-BB did. A chemical cross-linking experiment showed that PDGF-beta receptor was dimerized by PDGF-AB as well as PDGF-BB. These results indicate that PDGF-beta receptor binds PDGF-AB without participation of PDGF-alpha receptor at 37 degrees C (but not at 4 degrees C), and PDGF-AB as well as PDGF-BB acts as a potent mitogen in the vascular smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1608422633,"Ferredoxin reductase (Fd-reductase) supplies electrons to mitochondrial steroid hydroxylase cytochrome P450 enzymes via a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin. Chemical labeling studies with bovine Fd-reductase have implicated Lys-243 as important in binding to bovine ferredoxin (Hamamoto, I., Kazutaka, K., Tanaka, S., and Ichikawa, Y. (1988) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 953, 207-213). We have used site-directed mutagenesis to examine the role of charged residues in this region of human Fd-reductase in ferredoxin binding. Mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and were assayed for activity by ferredoxin-mediated electron transfer to cytochrome c. Replacement of Lys-242 (homologous to Lys-243 in bovine Fd-reductase) with Gln and replacement of Arg-241 with Ser had little effect (2.7- and 3.6-fold increased Km, respectively). In contrast, mutants at positions 239 and 243 (R239S and R243Q) exhibited markedly lower affinity for ferredoxin (17.5- and 1,600-fold increased Km, respectively). Studies were also carried out with two ferredoxin charge mutants shown previously to have lowered affinity for Fd-reductase (Coghlan, V. M., and Vickery, L. E. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 18606-18612). Comparisons of the binding of ferredoxin mutants D76N and D79N to Fd-reductase mutants R239S and R243Q suggest that Arg-239 and Arg-243 of Fd-reductase each interact directly with both Asp-76 and Asp-79 of ferredoxin during formation of the complex between the two proteins. These results support the hypothesis that specific electrostatic interactions involving this region are important in stabilizing the ferredoxin-Fd-reductase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1603575390,"The current model for the tricarboxylic acid cycle in Dictyostelium discoideum is based on extensive experimental studies of enzyme kinetics in vitro and of metabolite fluxes measured in vivo. In the previous papers (Shiraishi, F., and Savageau, M. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 22912-22918; 22919-22925; 22926-22933; 22934-22943) of this series we have carried out extensive analyses of the current model within the framework of biochemical systems theory with a view toward understanding the behavior of the integrated system. The model was found to be ill determined with respect to at least three of its features. In this paper we propose a minimal modification in the model that is consistent with previous experimental data but also includes recycling of amino acids for protein synthesis, one of the neglected features identified as important in the previous analysis. We again perform an analysis within the framework of biochemical systems theory to determine the systemic consequences of this change. The results show that the robustness of the modified model, as determined by the parameter sensitivities, is improved by 2 orders of magnitude over that of the previous model. Analysis of the dynamics shows that the turnover times for the pools of alanine, glutamate, and aspartate are reduced by 2 orders of magnitude and made more physiologically realistic. The distribution of flux is no longer rigidly fixed, and problems previously centered on the metabolism of pyruvate have been partially alleviated. Continued discrepancies lead us to question the degree to which kinetic data obtained with purified enzymes in vitro faithfully reflect the kinetic behavior of the integrated enzyme system in vivo. We must continue to re-examine the manner in which the kinetics of reactions in vivo are represented and to reassess the physical conditions that prevail in vitro and in vivo. Results in this paper direct our attention toward specific aspects of the system where these efforts should be focused. Thus, a minimal modification of the previous model has led to several improvements that make it more representative of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in D. discoideum, and the analysis in this paper leads to further predictions for improving the model."
https://openalex.org/W1479982529,"The human 46-kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR46) is phosphorylated in its cytoplasmic domain at serine residues. Substitution of cytoplasmic serines (at positions 35 and 56) with alanine, expression of mutant receptors in baby hamster kidney cells, and phosphopeptide mapping revealed that serine 56 is phosphorylated. Mutant MPR46 and wild-type MPR46 were found to be similarly distributed between the cell surface and intracellular membranes. Phosphate incorporation in the presence of cycloheximide indicates that phosphorylation occurred on pre-existing MPR46. Similar half-lives for the wild-type and mutant receptor proteins (approximately 43 h) and the receptor-associated phosphate (1.4 h) were found. The mutant receptors were internalized at the same rate as the wild-type receptors. Expression of mutant MPR46 and wild-type MPR46 in mouse L-cells deficient in 300-kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptors did not affect the sorting of newly synthesized cathepsin D to lysosomes. Phosphorylation of cytoplasmic serine 56 is therefore essential neither for stability nor for cell-surface expression and transport activities of MPR46."
https://openalex.org/W1491391137,"Alternative splicing of mRNA is often used as a regulatory switch, determining whether a functional protein is made or not. The plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mediates the transfer of cholesteryl esters from high density lipoproteins to other lipoproteins. In addition to the mRNA encoding plasma CETP, human tissues contain an alternatively spliced variant in which exon 9-derived sequences are omitted. To determine a possible regulatory role of alternative splicing, COS cells were co-transfected with full-length and exon 9-deleted cDNAs. The exon 9-deleted protein was poorly secreted and inhibited the secretion of full-length CETP, due to formation of an intracellular heteromeric complex between full-length and exon 9-deleted proteins. The findings suggest a novel use of alternative splicing to generate a poorly secreted protein variant, which complexes with the active form and prevents its secretion by cells."
https://openalex.org/W2138181510,"We have studied the role of myosin II light chain phosphorylation in yeast phagocytosis by J774 cells. J774 cells, which are mouse cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage, ingest opsonized yeast particles, and the rate of internalization is linear for 60 min at 37 degrees C. Immunoprecipitation of myosin II from cells labeled with 32P, using an affinity-purified antibody to myosin II purified from J774 cells, demonstrated phosphorylation of both the myosin heavy chain and the 20-kDa light chain (PMLC) prior to the addition of the opsonized yeast. However, the levels of heavy chain and PMLC phosphorylation did not change during the linear phase of yeast uptake by J774 cells. Other experiments demonstrated that the amount of myosin II associated with the cytoskeleton did not change during phagocytosis, further supporting the observation that PMLC phosphorylation does not increase during phagocytosis. In contrast, F-actin increased by 1.6-fold during the linear phase of phagocytosis. Two additional approaches were used to analyze in greater detail the role of myosin II phosphorylation in phagocytosis. First, antibodies to myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), the enzyme that phosphorylates PMLC, were electroinjected into J774 cells. These antibodies, which inhibit MLCK activity, inhibited chemotaxis as previously described but had no effect on phagocytosis. Second, quantitation of phagocytosis and chemotaxis following treatment with the phosphoprotein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid demonstrated that chemotaxis was much more sensitive than phagocytosis to okadaic acid treatment; at 0.3 microM okadaic acid, there is a substantial increase in myosin phosphorylation and chemotaxis is inhibited by 60%, whereas phagocytosis is unaffected. These data indicate that PMLC phosphorylation and, by implication, myosin II are not involved in yeast phagocytosis. They also suggest that PMLC phosphorylation displays a high degree of specificity with respect to mediating energy-dependent cellular processes in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1588420170,"The procoagulant alpha-thrombin is produced by the proteolytic cleavages of a minimum of two peptide bonds Arg274-Thr275 and Arg323-Ile324 in prothrombin. The Arg323-Ile324 cleavage is required for the expression of the active site of thrombin (Morita, T., Iwanaga, S. Suzuki, T. (1976) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 79, 1089-1108; Hibbard, L. S., Nesheim, M. E., and Mann, K. G. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 2285-2292). It is not yet clear to what extent the proteolytic events are responsible for exposing protein recognition exosites on thrombin. We employed high resolution NMR spectroscopy to examine interactions of prothrombin and thrombin with synthetic hirudin peptides targeted toward the fibrinogen recognition exosite of thrombin. The hirudin tail synthetic analogues (acetyl-Asp55-Phe-Glu-Glu-Ile-Pro-Glu-Glu-Tyr-Leu-Gln65/G ly65-OH) exhibited similar NMR relaxation enhancements (line broadening patterns and transferred nuclear Overhauser effects) with human prothrombin as with human alpha-thrombin, indicating that both proteins bind the peptide in a similar manner. The protein-induced relaxation enhancements are specific to the interaction of the hirudin peptides with the fibrinogen recognition exosite of thrombin since no significant effects were observed with either human serum albumin or with human gamma-thrombin, which has an impaired recognition exosite. The binding affinities were determined from NMR relaxation time measurements, which gave approximate Kd values of 500 microM and"
https://openalex.org/W1502662336,"Cholera toxin (CT) consists of a pentameric B subunit that binds to specific cell surface receptors identified as ganglioside GM1 and an A subunit that activates adenylylcyclase. The A subunit consists of A1 and A2 peptides linked by a disulfide bond; A2 acts to connect A to B, whereas A1 is an ADP-ribosyltransferase that modifies the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gs). How the toxin is oriented when it binds to the cell surface and the related issue of the mechanism by which A1 gains access to Gs alpha are not known. In the present study, we used subunit-specific antibodies and their corresponding Fab fragments to assess their affects on holotoxin binding to target cells and their immunoreactivity to cell-bound toxin. Our results suggest that CT binds with A1 facing away from the membrane. Our hypothesis is further supported by the ability to assemble active CT on the cell surface of cultured human intestinal and neurotumor cells by the sequential addition of purified B and A subunits. We also observed that when cells containing bound CT were incubated at 37 degrees C, both subunits rapidly became inaccessible to their respective antibodies. We propose that the holotoxin binds with its A subunit facing away from the membrane and must enter the cell in order for A1 to be released, gain access to Gs alpha, and activate adenylylcyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1519594446,"hXBP-1 is a transcription factor of the leucine zipper (b-zip) family important in the expression of the class II major histocompatibility complex gene, DRA. Studies with mouse-human hybrids have mapped hXBP-1 hybridizing fragments to human chromosomes 5 and 22 and the frequent detection of two mRNA transcripts suggested that hXBP-1 may be a member of a small gene family. To analyze the structure and regulation of hXBP-1 further, cosmid clones from both chromosomes were isolated. Mapping and sequence analyses reveal that chromosome 22 contains the functional hXBP-1 gene while chromosome 5 contains a processed pseudogene. hXBP-1 promoter analysis has revealed that cis-active elements within the 5'-untranslated region of hXBP-1 are essential for full promoter activity. One such element, hX2, is identical to the hXBP-1 target sequence in the DRA promoter. Mutagenesis of the hX2 site substantially decreases promoter activity. This element interacts with four distinct protein complexes in mature B cells and cross-competition experiments show that two of these complexes (complex 1 and complex 4) also interact with the hXBP-1 target sequence (X2) from the DRA promoter. The similarities of the hXBP-1 promoter and of the DRA promoter (the gene that the hXBP-1 protein regulates) are further emphasized by the fact that a Y box element is located 3' of both hX2 and X2."
https://openalex.org/W1513952484,"We have isolated and characterized Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants defective in the intracellular transport of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-derived cholesterol (Dahl, N. K., Reed, K. L., Daunais, M. A., Faust, J. R., and Liscum, L. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 4889-4896). Mutant 2-2, which exhibits a cholesterol transport defect indistinguishable from the Niemann-Pick C phenotype, shows impaired but not absent LDL-mediated suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase activity. In parental cells, LDL suppression of HMG-CoA reductase is modulated by two mechanisms, decreased gene transcription and accelerated protein turnover. Using the chimeric protein HMGal as a reporter protein for LDL-mediated turnover and Northern blot analysis to monitor HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels, we have dissected the contributions of these two regulatory responses to LDL-mediated suppression of HMG-CoA reductase activity. Kinetic modeling using the kinlsq program showed the following. Mutant 2-2 exhibits normal LDL-mediated acceleration of HMGal degradation, coupled with relatively abnormal regulation of mRNA. This suggests that the LDL-cholesterol signaling pathway to the nucleus is defective relative to the signal that results in HMG-CoA reductase turnover. In addition, LDL-mediated acceleration of HMGal turnover occurs well before LDL stimulation of cholesterol esterification in mutant 2-2, whereas these events occur synchronously in the parental cell line. This suggests that more than one pathway or mechanism exists for LDL-cholesterol signaling to the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1580190469,"A gene encoding for a putative isozyme of p-hydroxy-benzoate hydroxylase (PHBH) has been isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens (ATCC 13525). A comparison of the translated amino acid sequence with that of the known PHBH from P. fluorescens revealed that the new enzyme contains 3 additional amino acids and has 73% absolute homology to the previously known enzyme; conservation of secondary and active-site structures implied that the isozyme and known enzyme share the same general tertiary structure. Subsequent expression of the isozyme in Escherichia coli produced an enzyme with a specific activity about half that of the previously characterized PHBHs from P. fluorescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; in addition, somewhat weaker binding affinities for both NADPH and p-hydroxybenzoate were observed. Speculations are made on the reason for the existence of the isozyme, which does not appear to be expressed routinely in P. fluorescens."
https://openalex.org/W1569301878,"A molecule of myosin subfragment 1 (S1) from rabbit skeletal muscle has one highly reactive lysine residue, Lys-83 (RLR), in the heavy chain, which is rapidly and stoichiometrically modified by trinitrobenzenesulfonate. Our previous kinetic study (Komatsu, H., Emoto, Y., and Tawada K. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 7799-7808) showed that although MgPPi reduces the maximum number of trinitrophenylated RLR down to about 0.5 mol/mol of S1, this half-stoichiometric modification of RLR is not the result of any heterogeneity in the primary structure of S1. However, this result conflicts with a previous report in which the half-stoichiometric trinitrophenylation has been reported to be related to Pro/Ser microheterogeneity at the 78th residue position in the heavy chain of rabbit skeletal muscle myosin. To resolve the conflict, we isolated peptides containing both the 78th residue and RLR from the two different preparations of S1, one whose RLR was trinitrophenylated in the presence of MgPPi and the other whose RLR was not trinitrophenylated in the presence of MgPPi, and then we determined the amino acid sequences of the peptides. We found the same Pro/Ser microheterogeneity at the 78th position in the peptides from these S1s and thus concluded that this microheterogeneity has no correlation to the half-stoichiometric trinitrophenylation of RLR."
