These changes may influence larval growth and alter the course of further outbreaks."

https://openalex.org/W2082512307,"The eye of the marine mollusc Bulla contains a circadian pacemaker which, along with critical entrainment pathways, is located among a small group of neurons at the base of the retina. Long-term intracellular recording from cells of the organized photoreceptor layer, which constitutes most of the retinal volume, indicates that these cells are not involved in generating the rhythm since rhythmic changes in membrane potential were not observed. In addition, surgical removal of the entire photoreceptor layer does not alter the period of the circadian rhythm and does not prevent phase shifts by light pulses."
https://openalex.org/W2006252244,Interneurons involved in the generation of motor activity for flight in the locust were found in the first three abdominal ganglia as well as in thoracic ganglia. The evidence that sets of homologous flight interneurons occur in abdominal and thoracic ganglia supports theories that insect wings originated from movable appendages which were serially distributed along the thorax and abdomen and which were under central nervous control.
https://openalex.org/W2041304391,"The basic theoretical considerations involved in developing instruments for electron spectroscopy for atoms and solids are discussed. To be competitive with x-ray emission or absorption spectroscopy methods, electron spectroscopy would have to achieve such high resolution that well-defined electron lines would be obtained with line widths equal to or close to the atomic levels themselves. Chronology of development of equipment to achieve these demands on resolution is discussed. Successful instrument development led to application of electron spectroscopy to the chemical analysis of all elements in the periodic system and the coining of the acronym ESCA (electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis). Numerous applications of ESCA are described. A brief overview of recent development of new electron spectroscopic instrumentation is included, and several reviews and books published on the subject during the 1970s are among the 260 references cited.

https://openalex.org/W2044157357,"The promise of technology for improving the quality of life has never been greater, and American science and technology has led the way toward fulfillment of that promise. Now this preeminence is threatened by forces that may affect technological progress throughout the world. It is up to those of us in science, industry, and government to strengthen the institutions that have made us the leaders and to restore our initiative."
