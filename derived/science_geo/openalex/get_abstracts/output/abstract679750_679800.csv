https://openalex.org/W3194049481,"Over the course of an individual’s lifetime, normal human cells accumulate mutations1. Here we compare the mutational landscape in 29 cell types from the soma and germline using multiple samples from the same individuals. Two ubiquitous mutational signatures, SBS1 and SBS5/40, accounted for the majority of acquired mutations in most cell types, but their absolute and relative contributions varied substantially. SBS18, which potentially reflects oxidative damage2, and several additional signatures attributed to exogenous and endogenous exposures contributed mutations to subsets of cell types. The rate of mutation was lowest in spermatogonia, the stem cells from which sperm are generated and from which most genetic variation in the human population is thought to originate. This was due to low rates of ubiquitous mutational processes and may be partially attributable to a low rate of cell division in basal spermatogonia. These results highlight similarities and differences in the maintenance of the germline and soma. The authors report the mutational landscape of 29 cell types from microdissected biopsies from 19 organs and explore the mechanisms underlying mutation rates in normal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W3195821545,"Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used in applications ranging from electric vehicles to wearable devices. Before the invention of secondary LIBs, the primary lithium-thionyl chloride (Li-SOCl2) battery was developed in the 1970s using SOCl2 as the catholyte, lithium metal as the anode and amorphous carbon as the cathode1-7. This battery discharges by lithium oxidation and catholyte reduction to sulfur, sulfur dioxide and lithium chloride, is well known for its high energy density and is widely used in real-world applications; however, it has not been made rechargeable since its invention8-13. Here we show that with a highly microporous carbon positive electrode, a starting electrolyte composed of aluminium chloride in SOCl2 with fluoride-based additives, and either sodium or lithium as the negative electrode, we can produce a rechargeable Na/Cl2 or Li/Cl2 battery operating via redox between mainly Cl2/Cl- in the micropores of carbon and Na/Na+ or Li/Li+ redox on the sodium or lithium metal. The reversible Cl2/NaCl or Cl2/LiCl redox in the microporous carbon affords rechargeability at the positive electrode side and the thin alkali-fluoride-doped alkali-chloride solid electrolyte interface stabilizes the negative electrode, both are critical to secondary alkali-metal/Cl2 batteries."
https://openalex.org/W3195445434,"Starting from the zygote, all cells in the human body continuously acquire mutations. Mutations shared between different cells imply a common progenitor and are thus naturally occurring markers for lineage tracing1,2. Here we reconstruct extensive phylogenies of normal tissues from three adult individuals using whole-genome sequencing of 511 laser capture microdissections. Reconstructed embryonic progenitors in the same generation of a phylogeny often contribute to different extents to the adult body. The degree of this asymmetry varies between individuals, with ratios between the two reconstructed daughter cells of the zygote ranging from 60:40 to 93:7. Asymmetries pervade subsequent generations and can differ between tissues in the same individual. The phylogenies resolve the spatial embryonic patterning of tissues, revealing contiguous patches of, on average, 301 crypts in the adult colonic epithelium derived from a most recent embryonic cell and also a spatial effect in brain development. Using data from ten additional men, we investigated the developmental split between soma and germline, with results suggesting an extraembryonic contribution to primordial germ cells. This research demonstrates that, despite reaching the same ultimate tissue patterns, early bottlenecks and lineage commitments lead to substantial variation in embryonic patterns both within and between individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3196155953,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic astrophysical transients whose brightness requires emitters that are highly energetic, yet compact enough to produce the short, millisecond-duration bursts. FRBs have thus far been detected between 300 MHz and 8 GHz, but lower-frequency emission has remained elusive. A subset of FRBs is known to repeat, and one of those sources, FRB 20180916B, does so with a 16.3 day activity period. Using simultaneous Apertif and LOFAR data, we show that FRB 20180916B emits down to 120 MHz, and that its activity window is both narrower and earlier at higher frequencies. Binary wind interaction models predict a narrower periodic activity window at lower frequencies, which is the opposite of our observations. Our detections establish that low-frequency FRB emission can escape the local medium. For bursts of the same fluence, FRB 20180916B is more active below 200 MHz than at 1.4 GHz. Combining our results with previous upper-limits on the all-sky FRB rate at 150 MHz, we find that there are 3-450 FRBs/sky/day above 50 Jy ms at 90% confidence. We are able to rule out the scenario in which companion winds cause FRB periodicity. We also demonstrate that some FRBs live in clean environments that do not absorb or scatter low-frequency radiation."
https://openalex.org/W3193574244,"Transient neuromodulation can have long-lasting effects on neural circuits and motivational states1-4. Here we examine the dopaminergic mechanisms that underlie mating drive and its persistence in male mice. Brief investigation of females primes a male's interest to mate for tens of minutes, whereas a single successful mating triggers satiety that gradually recovers over days5. We found that both processes are controlled by specialized anteroventral and preoptic periventricular (AVPV/PVpo) dopamine neurons in the hypothalamus. During the investigation of females, dopamine is transiently released in the medial preoptic area (MPOA)-an area that is critical for mating behaviours. Optogenetic stimulation of AVPV/PVpo dopamine axons in the MPOA recapitulates the priming effect of exposure to a female. Using optical and molecular methods for tracking and manipulating intracellular signalling, we show that this priming effect emerges from the accumulation of mating-related dopamine signals in the MPOA through the accrual of cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels and protein kinase A activity. Dopamine transients in the MPOA are abolished after a successful mating, which is likely to ensure abstinence. Consistent with this idea, the inhibition of AVPV/PVpo dopamine neurons selectively demotivates mating, whereas stimulating these neurons restores the motivation to mate after sexual satiety. We therefore conclude that the accumulation or suppression of signals from specialized dopamine neurons regulates mating behaviours across minutes and days."
https://openalex.org/W3193608265,"Water is one of the most important, yet least understood, liquids in nature. Many anomalous properties of liquid water originate from its well-connected hydrogen bond network1, including unusually efficient vibrational energy redistribution and relaxation2. An accurate description of the ultrafast vibrational motion of water molecules is essential for understanding the nature of hydrogen bonds and many solution-phase chemical reactions. Most existing knowledge of vibrational relaxation in water is built upon ultrafast spectroscopy experiments2-7. However, these experiments cannot directly resolve the motion of the atomic positions and require difficult translation of spectral dynamics into hydrogen bond dynamics. Here, we measure the ultrafast structural response to the excitation of the OH stretching vibration in liquid water with femtosecond temporal and atomic spatial resolution using liquid ultrafast electron scattering. We observed a transient hydrogen bond contraction of roughly 0.04 Å on a timescale of 80 femtoseconds, followed by a thermalization on a timescale of approximately 1 picosecond. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the need to treat the distribution of the shared proton in the hydrogen bond quantum mechanically to capture the structural dynamics on femtosecond timescales. Our experiment and simulations unveil the intermolecular character of the water vibration preceding the relaxation of the OH stretch."
https://openalex.org/W3194717314,"Only five species of the once-diverse Rhinocerotidae remain, making the reconstruction of their evolutionary history a challenge to biologists since Darwin. We sequenced genomes from five rhinoceros species (three extinct and two living), which we compared to existing data from the remaining three living species and a range of outgroups. We identify an early divergence between extant African and Eurasian lineages, resolving a key debate regarding the phylogeny of extant rhinoceroses. This early Miocene (∼16 million years ago [mya]) split post-dates the land bridge formation between the Afro-Arabian and Eurasian landmasses. Our analyses also show that while rhinoceros genomes in general exhibit low levels of genome-wide diversity, heterozygosity is lowest and inbreeding is highest in the modern species. These results suggest that while low genetic diversity is a long-term feature of the family, it has been particularly exacerbated recently, likely reflecting recent anthropogenic-driven population declines."
https://openalex.org/W3195230691,"Tropical forests store 40-50 per cent of terrestrial vegetation carbon1. However, spatial variations in aboveground live tree biomass carbon (AGC) stocks remain poorly understood, in particular in tropical montane forests2. Owing to climatic and soil changes with increasing elevation3, AGC stocks are lower in tropical montane forests compared with lowland forests2. Here we assemble and analyse a dataset of structurally intact old-growth forests (AfriMont) spanning 44 montane sites in 12 African countries. We find that montane sites in the AfriMont plot network have a mean AGC stock of 149.4 megagrams of carbon per hectare (95% confidence interval 137.1-164.2), which is comparable to lowland forests in the African Tropical Rainforest Observation Network4 and about 70 per cent and 32 per cent higher than averages from plot networks in montane2,5,6 and lowland7 forests in the Neotropics, respectively. Notably, our results are two-thirds higher than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change default values for these forests in Africa8. We find that the low stem density and high abundance of large trees of African lowland forests4 is mirrored in the montane forests sampled. This carbon store is endangered: we estimate that 0.8 million hectares of old-growth African montane forest have been lost since 2000. We provide country-specific montane forest AGC stock estimates modelled from our plot network to help to guide forest conservation and reforestation interventions. Our findings highlight the need for conserving these biodiverse9,10 and carbon-rich ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3195696762,"Selfish centromere DNA sequences bias their transmission to the egg in female meiosis. Evolutionary theory suggests that centromere proteins evolve to suppress costs of this ""centromere drive."" In hybrid mouse models with genetically different maternal and paternal centromeres, selfish centromere DNA exploits a kinetochore pathway to recruit microtubule-destabilizing proteins that act as drive effectors. We show that such functional differences are suppressed by a parallel pathway for effector recruitment by heterochromatin, which is similar between centromeres in this system. Disrupting the kinetochore pathway with a divergent allele of CENP-C reduces functional differences between centromeres, whereas disrupting heterochromatin by CENP-B deletion amplifies the differences. Molecular evolution analyses using Murinae genomes identify adaptive evolution in proteins in both pathways. We propose that centromere proteins have recurrently evolved to minimize the kinetochore pathway, which is exploited by selfish DNA, relative to the heterochromatin pathway that equalizes centromeres, while maintaining essential functions."
https://openalex.org/W3194478006,"Engineering new functionality into living eukaryotic systems by enzyme evolution or de novo protein design is a formidable challenge. Cells do not rely exclusively on DNA-based evolution to generate new functionality but often utilize membrane encapsulation or formation of membraneless organelles to separate distinct molecular processes that execute complex operations. Applying this principle and the concept of two-dimensional phase separation, we develop film-like synthetic organelles that support protein translation on the surfaces of various cellular membranes. These sub-resolution synthetic films provide a path to make functionally distinct enzymes within the same cell. We use these film-like organelles to equip eukaryotic cells with dual orthogonal expanded genetic codes that enable the specific reprogramming of distinct translational machineries with single-residue precision. The ability to spatially tune the output of translation within tens of nanometers is not only important for synthetic biology but has implications for understanding the function of membrane-associated protein condensation in cells."
https://openalex.org/W3193700355,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented a global pandemic in 2020 and 2021, and has therefore spurred a flurry of research, whether related directly to the disease and its treatment or regarding its spread, containment, and effect on everyday lives. In particular, two pressing streams of research have investigated antecedents to COVID-19 preventative behaviors and vaccination intentions. This nascent research has led to many interesting and practically important findings, however, there remains many segmented, compartmentalized studies that address topics that, while certainly generative and meaningful, may not provide a full lens to possible antecedents. The current study takes an interdisciplinary approach that investigates commonly studied variables from biology and public health, political science, and psychology as they relate to COVID-19 preventative behaviors and vaccine intentions in a stratified sample of South Carolina residents ( N = 1695). Results from correlations and multiple regression substantiated the findings of many previous studies, however, it was found that, when controlling for shared variance among predictors via relative weights analysis, COVID-19 knowledge, trust in science, age, and Trump approval were the strongest predictors of preventative behaviors. Alternatively, trust in science, gender, age, and conservatism were the strongest predictors of vaccine intentions. Understanding the variables that contribute to the practice of preventative behaviors and vaccine intentions can be used by public health officials to better target and tailor their educational campaign in the community."
https://openalex.org/W3194363998,"Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder that leads to hemolytic anemia, pain, organ damage and early mortality. It is characterized by polymerized deoxygenated hemoglobin, rigid sickle red blood cells and vaso-occlusive crises (VOC). Recurrent hypoxia-reperfusion injury in the gut of SCD patients could increase tissue injury, permeability, and bacterial translocation. In this context, the gut microbiome, a major player in health and disease, might have significant impact. This study sought to characterize the gut microbiome in SCD.Stool and saliva samples were collected from healthy controls (n = 14) and SCD subjects (n = 14). Stool samples were also collected from humanized SCD murine models including Berk, Townes and corresponding control mice. Amplified 16S rDNA was used for bacterial composition analysis using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Pairwise group analyses established differential bacterial groups at many taxonomy levels. Bacterial group abundance and differentials were established using DeSeq software.A major dysbiosis was observed in SCD patients. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was lower in these patients. The following bacterial families were more abundant in SCD patients: Acetobacteraceae, Acidaminococcaceae, Candidatus Saccharibacteria, Peptostreptococcaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae, Veillonellaceae, Actinomycetaceae, Clostridiales, Bacteroidacbactereae and Fusobacteriaceae. This dysbiosis translated into 420 different operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Townes SCD mice also displayed gut microbiome dysbiosis as seen in human SCD.A major dysbiosis was observed in SCD patients for bacteria that are known strong pro-inflammatory triggers. The Townes mouse showed dysbiosis as well and might serve as a good model to study gut microbiome modulation and its impact on SCD pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W3193372575,"This report is prepared to examine the heat transport in stagnation point mixed convective hyperbolic tangent material flow past over a linear heated stretching sheet in the presence of magnetic dipole. Phenomenon of thermal transmission plays a vital role in several industrial manufacturing processes. Heat generation is along with thermal relaxation due to Cattaneo-Christov flux is engaged while modeling the energy equation. In order to improve the thermal performance, inclusion of hybrid nanoparticles is mixed in hyperbolic tangent liquid. The conservation laws are modeled in Cartesian coordinate system and simplified via boundary layer approximation. The modeled partial differential equations (PDEs) system are converted into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) system by engaging the scaling group transformation. The converted system of modeled equations has been tackled via finite element procedure (FEP). The efficiency of used scheme has been presented by establishing the grid independent survey. Moreover, accurateness of results is shown with the help of comparative study. It is worth mentioning that the inclusion of hybrid nanoparticles has significant higher impact on heat conduction as compared with nanoparticle. Moreover, hybrid nanoparticles are more efficient to conduct maximum production of heat energy as compared with the production of heat energy of nanoparticles. Hence, hybrid nanoparticles (MoS2/Ag) are observed more significant to conduct more heat energy rather than nanoparticle (Ag)."

https://openalex.org/W3196081197,"This study analyzes the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on grade inflation in higher education. Data were collected from five universities in Turkey, including grades of 152,352 students who attended 2,841 courses conducted by 903 instructors before the COVID-19 pandemic and grades of 149,936 students who attended 2,841 courses conducted by 847 instructors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this study demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic causes a marginal increase in grades in higher education when the other factors that might explain the differences are controlled. Grade inflation of 9.21% is the highest ever reported in literature. Compared with a year ago, DD and DC grades decreased 55%; FD and FF grades decreased 31%; and the highest-grade AA increased 41% for courses taken during the pandemic. Additionally, classroom population, academic history of the instructor, class level, field, university entrance scores, and course execution and evaluation (grading) forms of course notes are important determinants. This increase can be explained by the effort of instructors who are accustomed to face-to-face settings. When they suddenly switch to distant education, they might try to grade higher to compensate for the unforeseen negative circumstances."

https://openalex.org/W3195206845,"Endometriosis is a chronic pain condition in premenopausal women. Pain is mainly characterized by pain intensity and may induce disability in all areas of daily life. Nevertheless, pain is influenced by emotional and social factors as well. Social distancing measures or quarantine, as reaction to rapidly rising infections with the COVID-19 virus due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, were implemented across Europe to prevent the spread of the virus and social distancing measures were imposed by the German government by beginning of March 2020 with initiation of the lockdown by the end of March 2020. The objective of this study was to assess, how social distancing measures during the lockdown impacted the various aspects of pain perception in a group of chronic pain patients, such as women suffering from endometriosis.Between 6th to 27th April 2020, an online questionnaire was activated at internet platforms of endometriosis patients support groups. Participants were asked retrospectively at one time point about their visual pain intensity measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS) and pain disability via pain disability index (PDI) prior to initiation of social distancing measures in Germany (VASP, PDIP), as well as the pain intensity and pain disability since implementation of social distancing measures (VASI, PDII). Differences of VAS and PDI previous and after implementation of social distancing measures were displayed as ΔVAS and ΔPDI. Pain experience and social support were assessed by a 5-point Likert scale.285 participants completed at least one question regarding pain intensity, disability, pain experience or social support. Dysmenorrhea, the symptom with the highest level of pain assessed by VAS, decreased significantly during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic compared to the time period prior to social isolation (45.30% respondents experienced improvemenet vs 40.50% who experienced worsening; p = 0.025). The global physical impairment improved significantly (improvement of pain induced disability in 48.20% vs 40.90% with worsening of pain symptoms; p = 0.032) after the implementation of social distancing measures. Pain experience was negatively affected by social distancing measures, since frequency of pain awareness increased in 43.6% (p<0.001) of participants and 30.0% (p<0.001) more participants experienced pain as a threat. Verbalization of pain experience was reduced in 36.6% (p = 0.001) of participants and 14.6% (p = 0.91), 21.9% (p<0.001) and 31.5% (p<0.001) of participants reported less social support from their partner, family and friends.Physical pain and disability on one hand and emotional and social pain experience on the other were differentially affected by the emerged emotional, social and health care constraints related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3196701901,"Abstract Efficient cooling of trapped charged particles is essential to many fundamental physics experiments 1,2 , to high-precision metrology 3,4 and to quantum technology 5,6 . Until now, sympathetic cooling has required close-range Coulomb interactions 7,8 , but there has been a sustained desire to bring laser-cooling techniques to particles in macroscopically separated traps 5,9,10 , extending quantum control techniques to previously inaccessible particles such as highly charged ions, molecular ions and antimatter. Here we demonstrate sympathetic cooling of a single proton using laser-cooled Be + ions in spatially separated Penning traps. The traps are connected by a superconducting LC circuit that enables energy exchange over a distance of 9 cm. We also demonstrate the cooling of a resonant mode of a macroscopic LC circuit with laser-cooled ions and sympathetic cooling of an individually trapped proton, reaching temperatures far below the environmental temperature. Notably, as this technique uses only image–current interactions, it can be easily applied to an experiment with antiprotons 1 , facilitating improved precision in matter–antimatter comparisons 11 and dark matter searches 12,13 ."
https://openalex.org/W3195290349,"Background Switzerland has a liberal implementation of Coronavirus mitigation measures compared to other European countries. Since March 2020, measures have been evolving and include a mixture of central and federalistic mitigation strategies across three culturally diverse language regions. The present study investigates a hypothesised heterogeneity in health, social behavior and adherence to mitigation measures across the language regions by studying pre-specified interaction effects. Our findings aim to support the communication of regionally targeted mitigation strategies and to provide evidence to address longterm population-health consequences of the pandemic by accounting for different pandemic contexts and cultural aspects. Methods We use data from from the COVID-19 Social Monitor, a longitudinal population-based online survey. We define five mitigation periods between March 2020 and May 2021. We use unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models to investigate a hypothesized interaction effect between mitigation periods and language regions on selected study outcomes covering the domains of general health and quality of life, mental health, loneliness/isolation, physical activity, health care use and adherence to mitigation measures. Results We analyze 2,163 (64%) participants from the German/Romansh-speaking part of Switzerland, 713 (21%) from the French-speaking part and 505 (15%) from the Italian-speaking part. We found evidence for an interaction effect between mitigation periods and language regions for adherence to mitigation measures, but not for other study outcomes (social behavior, health). The presence of poor quality of life, lack of energy, no physical activity, health care use, and the adherence to mitigation measures changed similarly over mitigation periods in all language regions. Discussion As the pandemic unfolded in Switzerland, also health and social behavior changed between March 2020 to May 2021. Changes in adherence to mitigation measures differ between language regions and reflect the COVID-19 incidence patterns in the investigated mitigation periods, with higher adherence in regions with previously higher incidence. Targeted communcation of mitigation measures and policy making should include cultural, geographical and socioeconomic aspects to address yet unknown long-term population health consequences caused by the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3193689363,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted surveillance activities for multiple pathogens. Since March 2020, there was a decline in the number of reports of norovirus and Campylobacter recorded by England’s national laboratory surveillance system. The aim is to estimate and compare the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on norovirus and Campylobacter surveillance data in England. Methods We utilised two quasi-experimental approaches based on a generalised linear model for sequential count data. The first approach estimates overall impact and the second approach focuses on the impact of specific elements of the pandemic response (COVID-19 diagnostic testing and control measures). The following time series (27, 2015–43, 2020) were used: weekly laboratory-confirmed norovirus and Campylobacter reports, air temperature, conducted Sars-CoV-2 tests and Index of COVID-19 control measures stringency. Results The period of Sars-CoV-2 emergence and subsequent sustained transmission was associated with persistent reductions in norovirus laboratory reports (p = 0.001), whereas the reductions were more pronounced during pandemic emergence and later recovered for Campylobacter (p = 0.075). The total estimated reduction was 47% - 79% for norovirus (12–43, 2020). The total reduction varied by time for Campylobacter , e.g. 19% - 33% in April, 1% - 7% in August. Conclusion Laboratory reporting of norovirus was more adversely impacted than Campylobacter by the COVID-19 pandemic. This may be partially explained by a comparatively stronger effect of behavioural interventions on norovirus transmission and a relatively greater reduction in norovirus testing capacity. Our study underlines the differential impact a pandemic may have on surveillance of gastrointestinal infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3194558706,"Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) manipulates the coupling of light with matter, and allows several emitters to couple coherently with one light mode1. However, even in a many-body system, the light-matter coupling mechanism has so far been restricted to one-body processes. Leveraging cavity QED for the quantum simulation of complex, many-body systems has thus far relied on multi-photon processes, scaling down the light-matter interaction to the low energy and slow time scales of the many-body problem2-5. Here we report cavity QED experiments using molecular transitions in a strongly interacting Fermi gas, directly coupling cavity photons to pairs of atoms. The interplay of strong light-matter and strong interparticle interactions leads to well-resolved pair polaritons-hybrid excitations coherently mixing photons, atom pairs and molecules. The dependence of the pair-polariton spectrum on interatomic interactions is universal, independent of the transition used, demonstrating a direct mapping between pair correlations in the ground state and the optical spectrum. This represents a magnification of many-body effects by two orders of magnitude in energy. In the dispersive regime, it enables fast, minimally destructive measurements of pair correlations, and opens the way to their measurement at the quantum limit and their coherent manipulation using dynamical, quantized optical fields."
https://openalex.org/W3194700959,"Notable cross-country differences exist in the diffusion of the Covid-19 and in its lethality. Contact patterns in populations, and in particular intergenerational contacts, have been argued to be responsible for the most vulnerable, the elderly, getting infected more often and thus driving up mortality in some context, like in the southern European one. This paper asks a simple question: is it between whom contacts occur that matters or is it simply how many contacts people have? Due to the high number of confounding factors, it is extremely difficult to empirically assess the impact of single network features separately. This is why we rely on a simulation exercise in which we counterfactually manipulate single aspects of countries’ age distribution and network structures. We disentangle the contributions of the kind and of the number of contacts while holding constant the age structure. More precisely, we isolate the respective effects of inter-age contact patterns, degree distribution and clustering on the virus propagation across age groups. We use survey data on face-to-face contacts for Great Britain, Italy, and Germany, to reconstruct networks that mirror empirical contact patterns in these three countries. It turns out that the number of social contacts (degree distribution) largely accounts for the higher infection rates of the elderly in the Italian context, while differences in inter-age contacts patterns are only responsible for minor differences. This suggests that policies specifically targeting inter-age contacts would be little effective."
https://openalex.org/W3193576175,"A key challenge in lifestyle interventions is long-term maintenance of favorable lifestyle changes. Middle-aged and older adults are important target groups. The purpose of this analysis was to investigate changes in adiposity, physical activity, cardiometabolic risk factors, diet, physical capacity, and well-being, in inactive middle-aged and older women and men with obesity and elevated cardiovascular disease risk, participating in an interdisciplinary single-arm complex lifestyle intervention pilot study. Participants were recruited from the population-based Tromsø Study 2015-2016 with inclusion criteria age 55-74 years, body mass index (BMI) ≥30kg/m2, sedentary lifestyle, no prior myocardial infarction and elevated cardiovascular risk. Participants (11 men and 5 women aged 57-74 years) underwent a 6-month intervention of two 1-hour group-sessions per week with instructor-led gradually intensified exercise (endurance and strength), one individual and three 2-hour group counselling sessions with nutritionist (Nordic Nutrition Recommendations) and psychologist (Implementation intention strategies). We investigated changes in adiposity (weight, BMI, body composition, waist circumference), physical activity (self-reported and via physical activity trackers), cardiometabolic risk factors (blood pressure, HbA1c, blood lipids), diet (intake of energy, nutrients, foods), physical capacity (aerobic capacity, muscle strength), and psychological well-being, measured at baseline and end-of-intervention, using mean-comparison paired t-tests. Further, we investigated self-reported healthy lifestyle maintenance six months after end-of-intervention, and monthly changes in daily step count, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and total energy expenditure. From baseline to end-of-intervention, there was a mean decrease in weight, BMI, fat mass, waist circumference, intake of total- and saturated fat, and increase in lean mass, lateral pulldown and leg press. We detected no changes in mean levels of physical activity, cardiometabolic risk factors or well-being. Six months after end-of-intervention, 25% responded healthy lifestyle achievement and maintenance, while objectively measured physical activity remained unchanged. The results are useful for development of a protocol for a full-scale trial. Trial registration: The study was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov registry (NCT03807323)."
https://openalex.org/W3193837472,"Background Transcatheter methods have been rapidly evolving to provide an alternative less invasive therapeutic option, mainly because redo patients often present with multiple comorbidities and high operative risk. We sought to evaluate and compare our experience with transapical transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TA-TMVR) to conventional redo mitral valve replacement in patients presenting with degenerated biological mitral valve prostheses or failed valve annuloplasty. Methods and material Between March 2012 and November 2020, 74 consecutive high-risk patients underwent surgical redo mitral valve replacement (n = 33) or TA-TMVR (n = 41) at our institution. All patients presented with a history of a surgical mitral valve procedure. All transcatheter procedures were performed using the SAPIEN XT/3™ prostheses. Data collection was prospectively according to MVARC criteria. Results The mean logistic EuroSCORE-II of the whole cohort was 19.9±16.7%, and the median STS-score was 11.1±12.5%. The mean age in the SMVR group was 63.7±12.8 years and in the TMVR group 73.6±9.7 years. Patients undergoing TA-TMVR presented with significantly higher risk scores. Echocardiography at follow up showed no obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract, no paravalvular leakage and excellent transvalvular gradients in both groups (3.9±1.2 mmHg and 4.2±0.8 mmHg in the surgical and transcatheter arm respectively). There was no difference in postoperative major adverse events between the groups with no strokes in the whole cohort. Both methods showed similar survival rates at one year and a 30-day mortality of 15.2% and 9.8% in SAVR and TMVR group, respectively. Despite using contrast dye in the transcatheter group, the rate of postoperative acute kidney failure was similar between the groups. Conclusion Despite several contraindications for surgery, we showed the non-inferiority of TA-TMVR compared to conventional surgical redo procedures in high-risk patients. With its excellent hemodynamic and similar survival rate, TA-TMVR offers a feasible alternative to the conventional surgical redo procedure in selected patients."
https://openalex.org/W3194092109,"Based on the assumption that some progenitor cells in an organ might reside in neighboring adipose tissue, we investigated whether melanocyte progenitor cells reside in human subcutaneous adipose tissue. First, we examined the expression of human melanoma black 45 (HMB45) and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) in undifferentiated adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) by immunostaining, RT-PCR, and western blotting. These two markers were detected in undifferentiated ADSCs, and their expression levels were increased in differentiated ADSCs in melanocyte-specific culture medium. Other melanocytic markers (Melan A, MATP, Mel2, Mel EM, tyrosinase, KIT, and PAX3) were also detected at variable levels in undifferentiated ADSCs, and the expression of some markers was increased during differentiation into the melanocyte lineage. We further showed that ADSCs differentiated in melanocyte-specific culture medium localized in the basal layer and expressed tyrosinase and HMB45 in a 3D epidermal culture system. Melanin deposits were also induced by ultraviolet-light-B (UVB) irradiation. These results demonstrate that melanocyte progenitor cells reside in human subcutaneous adipose tissue and that these cells might have the potential to differentiate into mature melanocytes. Melanocyte and keratinocyte progenitors residing in human subcutaneous tissue can be used for the treatment of skin diseases and skin rejuvenation in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3193698583,"Purpose To evaluate whether there is a change in findings of coronavirus disease 2019 patients in follow up lung ultrasound and to determine whether these findings can predict the development of severe disease. Materials and methods In this prospective monocentric study COVID-19 patients had standardized lung ultrasound (12 area evaluation) at day 1, 3 and 5. The primary end point was detection of pathologies and their change over time. The secondary end point was relationship between change in sonographic results and clinical outcome. Clinical outcome was assessed on development of severe disease defined as need for intensive care unit. Results Data of 30 patients were analyzed, 26 patients with follow-up lung ultrasound. All of them showed lung pathologies with dynamic patterns. 26,7% developed severe disease tending to have an ubiquitous lung involvement in lung ultrasound. In patients with need for intensive care unit a previously developed increase in B-lines, subpleural consolidations and pleural line irregularities was more common. A statistically significant association between change in B-lines as well as change in pleural line irregularities and development of severe disease was observed (p&lt;0,01). Conclusion The present study demonstrates that follow up lung ultrasound can be a powerful tool to track the evolution of disease and suggests that lung ultrasound is able to indicate an impending development of severe disease in COVID-19 patients."
https://openalex.org/W3193934403,"Introduction Assisting smokers to quit before surgery reduces surgical site infection (SSI) risk. The short-term economic benefits of reducing SSIs by embedding tobacco dependence treatment in Australian hospitals are unknown. Estimated annual number of SSIs prevented, and hospital bed-days (HBD) and costs saved from reducing smoking before surgery are calculated. Methods The most recent number of surgical procedures and SSI rates for Australia were sourced. The number of smokers and non-smokers having a SSI were calculated using the UK Royal College of Physicians reported adjusted odds ratio (1.79), and the proportion of SSIs attributable to smoking calculated. The potential impact fraction was used to estimate reductions in SSIs and associated HBDs and costs from reducing the smoking rates among surgical patients from 23.9% to 10% or 5% targets. Uncertainty around the final estimates was calculated using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results In 2016–17, approximately 40,593 (95% UI 32,543, 50,239) people having a surgical procedure in Australia experienced a SSI leading to 101,888 extra days (95% UI 49,988, 200,822) in hospital. If the smoking rate among surgical patients was reduced to 10%, 3,580 (95% UI 2,312, 5,178) SSIs would be prevented, and 8,985 (95% UI 4,094, 19,153) HBDs and $19.1M (95% UI $7.7M, $42.5M) saved in one year. If the smoking rate was reduced to 5%, 4,867 (95% UI 3,268, 6,867) SSIs would be prevented, and 12,217 (95% UI 5,614, 25,642) HBDs and $26.0M (95% UI $10.8M, $57.0M) would be saved. Conclusions The findings suggest achieving smoking rate targets of 10% or 5% would provide substantial short-term health and economic benefits through reductions in SSIs. Embedding tobacco dependence treatment in Australian hospitals would provide value for money by reducing costs and improving clinical quality and safety. A more comprehensive, modelled economic evaluation synthesising the best available evidence is needed to confirm findings."
https://openalex.org/W3195842513,"We study geographical epidemic scales and patterns and positivity trends of SARS-CoV-2 pandemics in mass antigen testing in Slovakia in 2020. The observed test positivity was exponentially distributed with a long scale exponential spatial trend, and its characteristic correlation length was approximately 10 km. Spatial scales also play an important role in test positivity reduction between two consecutive testing rounds. While test positivity decreased in all counties, it increased in individual municipalities with low test positivity in the earlier testing round in a way statistically different from a mean-reversion process. Also, non-residents testing influences the mass testing results as test positivity of non-residents was higher than of residents when testing was offered only in municipalities with the highest positivity in previous rounds. Our results provide direct guidance for pandemic geographical data surveillance and epidemic response management."
https://openalex.org/W3194031199,"The aim of this study was to assess the relationships among motivational profiles, their responsibility levels, the school social climate and resilience, and the differences according to gender and age of students from different secondary schools in Spain. A sample of 768 students (mean age of 13.84 years), 314 boys (46.1%) and 354 girls (53.9%) was used. The measurements taken concerned: personal and social responsibility, basic psychological need satisfaction, motivation, resilience and school social climate. Bivariate correlation, cluster and multivariate analyses were carried out. The cluster analysis was made using the Motivation toward Education Scale with its different variables (intrinsic, identified, introjected, external motivation and amotivation), revealing four profiles: low quality (1, low values in all motivational variables except in amotivation), low quantity (2, low values), high quantity (3, high values), and high quality (4, high values except in amotivation). The contrast in comparisons shows differences in resilience, personal and social responsibility, teacher climate and school climate (p < .001). The group with the highest values in resilience, basic psychological needs, responsibility and school social climate was that with a high quality profile. There were statistical differences in all variables with respect to the low quantity and low quality groups (p < .001), while the high quantity group showed statistical differences only in personal and social responsibility (p < .001). The low quality group had the lowest values among all the variables, with statistical differences with respect to all groups (p < .001). On the other hand, there were more boys than girls associated with high quantity, without differences in their age. In conclusion, high quality motivation profiles (those with high or low amotivation values and high values in autonomous and controlling motivation), also have a higher satisfaction of basic psychological needs. Moreover, these students are more resilient, show more responsibility and enhance the school/teaching social climate, while low quality and /or quantity motivation, influence negatively on these variables."
https://openalex.org/W3193320086,"Cruciferous vegetables have been widely studied for cancer prevention and cardiovascular health. Broccoli is the cruciferous vegetable whose phytochemistry and physiological effects have been most extensively studied. Kale (Brassica oleracea var. acephala) appears on lists of 'healthiest, nutrient dense foods' but, there is paucity of data on kale as a functional food. In a 12-week study, we tested the effect of curly green kale on high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity and insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, endotoxemia and inflammation in C57BL/6J mice fed isocaloric diets. Kale supplementation did not attenuate HFD diet induced fat accumulation and insulin resistance (P = ns; n = 9) but, it lowered serum triglycerides, low density lipoprotein (LPL) cholesterol and prevented HFD induced increases in systemic endotoxemia and inflammation (serum LPS and Ccl2) (P<0.01; n = 9). In adipose tissue, kale enhanced the expression of genes involved in adipogenesis (P<0.01; n = 9), reduced the appearance of histologic markers of inflammation, downregulated both the gene expression and protein expression of the adipose tissue specific inflammation markers CD11c and F4/80 (P<0.001; n = 9) and reduced the gene expression of a battery of chemokine C-C motif ligands (Ccl2, Ccl6, Ccl7, Ccl8, Ccl9) and chemokine C-C motif receptors (Ccr2, Ccr3, Ccr5). We conclude that kale vegetable protects against HFD diet induced dysfunction through mechanisms involving lipid metabolism, endotoxemia and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3193440314,"Introduction Internationally, countries have reacted to the COVID-19 outbreak by introducing key public health non-pharmaceutical interventions to protect vulnerable population groups. In response to COVID-19, the Government of Ethiopia has been taking a series of policy actions beyond public health initiatives alone. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the applicability of basic preventive measures of the pandemic COVID-19 and associated factors among the residents of Guraghe Zone from 18 th to 29 th September, 2020. Methods Community based cross sectional study was conducted at Guraghe Zone from 18 th to 29 th September, 2020. Systematic random sampling method was applied among the predetermined 634 samples. Variables which had p-value less than 0.25 in bivariate analysis were considered as candidate for multivariable logistic regression model. P-value &lt;0.05 was used as a cutoff point to determine statistical significance in multiple logistic regressions for the final model. Result In this study, 17.7% (95% CI: 14.7, 20.5) of the respondents apply the basic preventive measures towards the prevention of the pandemic COVID-19. In addition, being rural resident (AOR: 4.78,; 95%CI: 2.50, 8.90), being studied grade 1–8 (AOR: 3.70; 95%CI: 1.70, 7.90), being a farmer (AOR: 4.10; 95%CI: 1.25, 13.35), currently not married (AOR: 2.20, 95%CI: 1.24, 4.06), having family size 1-3(AOR: 6.50; 95%CI: 3.21, 3.35), have no diagnosed medical illness (AOR: 6.40; 95%CI: 3.85, 10.83) and having poor knowledge (AOR: 3.50; 95%CI: 1.60, 7.40) were factors which are statistically significant in multivariable logistic regression model. Conclusion Despite the application of preventive measures and vaccine delivery, the applicability of the pandemic COVID-19 preventive measures was too low, which indicate that the Zone is at risk for the infection. Rural residents, those who have lower educational level, farmers, non-marrieds, those who have lower family size, those who have diagnosed medical illnesses and those who have poor knowledge were prone to the infection with the pandemic COVID-19 due to the lower practice of applying the basic preventive measures. In addition, awareness creation should be in practice at all levels of the community especially lower educational classes and rural residents."

Consequently, diabetes complications usually exist at the time of diagnosis. Foot ulcers is a leading cause of disability and mortality among diabetes patients.To assess the knowledge and experiences of adult patients with Diabetes on diabetes complications and self-management practices with emphasis on foot care.This applied phenomenological study design. Twenty patients attending Diabetes clinics were purposively sampled from two hospitals in Ghana. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted to evaluate patient's understanding of diabetes and self-management practices. The interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, and analysed to generate themes using the constant comparison method.Three-quarters of the participants in the study correctly defined diabetes as high blood glucose levels, but few knew the risk factors and complications of diabetes. Stroke and Hypertension were the most popular complications known, whiles diabetes foot complications were the least known. Almost all participants showed awareness of dietary self-management practices, but few had limited knowledge in foot care practices.Diabetes education in LMICs should promote self-management practices, especially foot care and clear dietary guidelines. There is also opportunity to invest in specialist diabetes training for healthcare providers and increase community-based care for people living with diabetes in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W3195490502,"Early antenatal care (ANC) reduces maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality through identification of pregnancy-related complications, yet 44% of Rwandan women present to ANC after 16 weeks gestational age (GA). The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with delayed initiation of ANC and describe differences in the obstetric risks identified at the first ANC visit (ANC-1) between women presenting early and late to care.This secondary data analysis included 10,231 women presenting for ANC-1 across 18 health centers in Rwanda (May 2017-December 2018). Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed using backwards elimination to identify predictors of presentation to ANC at ≥16 and ≥24 weeks GA. Logistic regression was used to examine differences in obstetric risk factors identified at ANC-1 between women presenting before and after 16- and 24-weeks GA.Sixty-one percent of women presented to ANC at ≥16 weeks and 24.7% at ≥24 weeks GA, with a mean (SD) GA at presentation of 18.9 (6.9) weeks. Younger age (16 weeks: OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.75; 24 weeks: OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 0.95, 1.85), higher parity (16 weeks: 1-4 births, OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.39, 1.72; five or more births, OR = 2.57, 95% CI: 2.17, 3.04; 24 weeks: 1-4 births, OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.78, 2.09; five or more births, OR = 3.20, 95% CI: 2.66, 3.85), lower educational attainment (16 weeks: primary, OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.86; secondary, OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.47,0.76; university, OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.70; 24 weeks: primary, OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.77; secondary, OR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.63; university, OR = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.32) and contributing to household income (16 weeks: OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.40, 2.25; 24 weeks: OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.42, 2.55) were associated with delayed ANC-1 (≥16 and ≥24 weeks GA). History of a spontaneous abortion (16 weeks: OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.66, 0.84; 24 weeks: OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.84), pregnancy testing (16 weeks: OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.71; 24 weeks: OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.61; 24 weeks) and residing in the same district (16 weeks: OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.08, 2.22; 24 weeks: OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.87) or catchment area (16 weeks: OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.05, 2.23; 24 weeks: OR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.28, 2.66; 24 weeks) as the health facility were protective against delayed ANC-1. Women with a prior preterm (OR, 0.71, 95% CI, 0.53, 0.95) or low birthweight delivery (OR, 0.72, 95% CI, 0.55, 0.95) were less likely to initiate ANC after 16 weeks. Women with no obstetric history were more likely to present after 16 weeks GA (OR, 1.18, 95% CI, 1.06, 1.32).This study identified multiple predictors of delayed ANC-1. Focusing existing Community Health Worker outreach efforts on the populations at greatest risk of delaying care and expanding access to home pregnancy testing may improve early care attendance. While women presenting late to care were less likely to present without an identified obstetric risk factor, lower than expected rates were identified in the study population overall. Health centers may benefit from provider training and standardized screening protocols to improve identification of obstetric risk factors at ANC-1."
https://openalex.org/W3193373237,"Background The recent COVID-19 pandemic has seen an explosion of coronavirus-related information. In many cases, this information was supported by images representing the SARS-CoV-2. Aim To evaluate how attributes of images representing the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that were used in the initial phase of the coronavirus crisis in 2020 influenced the public’s perceptions. Methods We have carried out an in-depth survey using 46 coronavirus images, asking individuals how beautiful, scientific, realistic, infectious, scary and didactic they appeared to be. Results We collected 91,908 responses, obtaining 15,315 associations for each category. While the reference image of SARS-CoV-2 used in the media is a three-dimensional, colour, illustration, we found that illustrations of the coronavirus were perceived as beautiful but not very realistic, scientific or didactic. By contrast, black and white coronavirus images are thought to be the opposite. The beauty of coronavirus images was negatively correlated with the perception of scientific realism and didactic value. Conclusion Given these effects and the consequences on the individual’s perception, it is important to evaluate the influence that different images of SARS-CoV-2 may have on the population."
https://openalex.org/W3194514769,"Arithmetic processing is represented in a fronto-parietal network of the brain. However, activation within this network undergoes a shift from domain-general cognitive processing in the frontal cortex towards domain-specific magnitude processing in the parietal cortex. This is at least what is known about development from findings in children and young adults. In this registered report, we set out to replicate the fronto-parietal activation shift for arithmetic processing and explore for the first time how neural development of arithmetic continues during aging. This study focuses on the behavioral and neural correlates of arithmetic and arithmetic complexity across the lifespan, i.e., childhood, where arithmetic is first learned, young adulthood, when arithmetic skills are already established, and old age, when there is lifelong arithmetic experience. Therefore, brain activation during mental arithmetic will be measured in children, young adults, and the elderly using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Arithmetic complexity will be manipulated by the carry and borrow operations in two-digit addition and subtraction. The findings of this study will inform educational practice, since the carry and borrow operations are considered as obstacles in math achievement, and serve as a basis for developing interventions in the elderly, since arithmetic skills are important for an independent daily life."
https://openalex.org/W3194771296,"Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) is involved in various metabolic pathways, including fatty acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis in the liver. However, its role in initiation and progression of liver cancer remains unclear. Studying Sirt1 liver-specific knockout (LKO) mice in combination with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) treatment, we demonstrated that loss of Sirt1 rendered mice resistant to DEN-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. RNA-seq revealed that livers from LKO mice exhibited an enrichment in glutathione metabolism eight months after DEN challenge. Sirt1 deficiency elevated the expression of glutathione-s-transferase family genes by increasing the level of Nrf2, a key regulator of glutathione metabolism. Hence, LKO livers displayed a reductive environment with an increased ratio of GSH to GSSG and an elevated GSH level. Furthermore, using CRISPR knockout techniques, we confirmed that the impairment of HCC formation in LKO mice is mainly dependent on NRF2 signaling. Meanwhile, HCC induced by DEN could be blocked by the administration of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) when administered one month after DEN challenge. However, NAC treatment starting five months after DEN injection was not able to prevent tumor development. In conclusion, our findings indicate that a reductive environment orchestrated by glutathione metabolism at an early stage can prevent the initiation of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W3195273272,"Osteoarthritis (OA) as the main degenerative disease of articular cartilage in joints is accompanied by structural and compositional changes in the tissue. Degeneration is a consequence of a reduction of the amount of macromolecules, the so-called proteoglycans, and of a corresponding increase in water content, both leading to structural weakening of cartilage. NMR investigations of cartilage generally address only the relaxation properties of water. In this study, two-dimensional (T1-T2) measurements of bovine articular cartilage samples were carried out for different stages of hydration, complemented by molecular exchange with D2O and treatment by trypsin which simulates degeneration by OA. Two signal components were identified in all measurements, characterized by very different T2 which suggests liquid-like and solid-like dynamics. These measurements allow the quantification of separate hydrogen components and their assignment to defined physical pools which had been discussed repeatedly in the literature, i.e. bulk-like water and a combination of protein hydrogens and strongly bound water. The first determination of 2H relaxation dispersion in comparison to 1H dispersion suggests intramolecular interactions as the dominating source for the pronounced magnetic field dependence of the longitudinal relaxation time T1."
https://openalex.org/W3195905692,"Threats to public health and environmental quality from septic systems are more prevalent in areas with poorly draining soils, high water tables, or frequent flooding. Significant research gaps exist in assessing these systems' vulnerability and evaluating factors associated with higher rates of septic systems replacement and repair. We developed a novel GIS-based framework for assessing septic system vulnerability using a database of known septic system specifications and a modified Soil Topographic Index (STI) that incorporates seasonal high groundwater elevation to assess risks posed to septic systems in coastal Georgia. We tested the hypothesis that both the modified STI and septic system specifications such as tank capacity per bedroom and drainfield type would explain most of the variance in septic system repair and replacement using classification inference tree and generalized logistic regression models. Our modeling results indicate that drainfield type (level vs. mounded) is the most significant variable (p-value < 0.001) in predicting septic systems functionality followed by septic tank capacity per bedroom (p-value < 0.01). These show the importance of septic system design regulations such as a minimum requirement for horizontal separation distance between the bottom of trenches and seasonal water table, and adequate tank capacity design. However, for septic systems with a mounded drainfield and a larger tank capacity per bedroom, the modified STI representing hydrological characteristics of septic system location is a significant predictor of a high septic system repair and replacement rate. The methodology developed in this study can have important implications for managing existing septic systems and planning for future development in coastal areas, especially in an environment of rapid climatic change."

While angiogenin is a potent contributor to angiogenesis in general, little is known about its impact on TIPS function over time.In a total of 118 samples from 47 patients, angiogenin concentrations were measured in portal and inferior caval vein plasma at TIPS insertion (each blood compartment n = 23) or angiographic intervention after TIPS (each blood compartment n = 36) and its relationship with patient outcome was investigated.Angiogenin levels in the inferior caval vein were significantly higher compared to the portal vein (P = 0.048). Ten to 14 days after TIPS, inferior caval vein angiogenin level correlated inversely with the portal systemic pressure gradient (P<0.001), measured invasively during control angiography. Moreover, patients with TIPS revision during this angiography, showed significantly lower angiogenin level in the inferior caval vein compared to patients without TIPS dysfunction (P = 0.01).In cirrhosis patients with complications of severe portal hypertension, circulating levels of angiogenin are derived from the injured liver. Moreover, angiogenin levels in the inferior caval vein after TIPS may predict TIPS dysfunction."

However, few studies have yet addressed this issue. This study aims to describe the association of the intention to seek help with mental health knowledge and stigma and the severity of depressive symptoms in Japan Rugby Top League players.As a target population, we studied 233 Japan Rugby Top League male players (25-29 years = 123 [52.8%]), who were born in Japan, using a cross-sectional design. Surveys were conducted using anonymous, web-based self-administered questionnaires. Structural equation modelling was performed to evaluate the hypothesis of an interrelationship between mental health knowledge, stigma, and severity of depressive symptoms as factors influencing the intention to seek help.Players with more severe depressive symptoms were more reluctant to seek help from others (β = - 0.20, p = 0.03). Players with greater knowledge about mental health tended to have less stigma toward others with mental health problems (β = 0.13, p = 0.049), but tended not to seek help with their own mental health problems.Rugby players in need of mental health support, even with greater knowledge, tend not to seek help from others, while having less stigma toward people with mental health problems. Rugby players might require approaches other than a knowledge-based educational approach to encourage them to seek help."
https://openalex.org/W3193582080,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has led the world to an unprecedented global shortage of ventilators, and its sharing has been proposed as an alternative to meet the surge. This study outlines the performance of a preformed novel interface called ’ACRA’, designed to split ventilator outflow into two breathing systems. The ’ACRA’ interface was built using medical use approved components. It consists of four unidirectional valves, two adjustable flow-restrictor valves placed on the inspiratory limbs of each unit, and one adjustable PEEP valve placed on the expiratory limb of the unit that would require a greater PEEP. The interface was interposed between a ventilator and two lung units (phase I), two breathing simulators (phase II) and two live pigs with heterogeneous lung conditions (phase III). The interface and ventilator adjustments tested the ability to regulate individual pressures and the resulting tidal volumes. Data were analyzed using Friedman and Wilcoxon tests test (p &lt; 0.05). Ventilator outflow splitting, independent pressure adjustments and individual tidal volume monitoring were feasible in all phases. In all experimental measurements, dual ventilation allowed for individual and tight adjustments of the pressure, and thus volume delivered to each paired lung unit without affecting the other unit’s ventilation—all the modifications performed on the ventilator equally affected both paired lung units. Although only suggested during a dire crisis, this experiment supports dual ventilation as an alternative worth to be considered."
https://openalex.org/W3194222754,"A scientific measurement of the amount of tradable water rights forms the premise for reaching an agreement in water rights trading. However, the existing measurement methods, based on water saving potential, still have problems caused by large computation workload and difficult-to-control errors. Conflicts also easily emerge between transferor and transferee during the execution of transaction agreements. This paper proposes a new method for measuring tradable water rights from the perspective of an assessment of the risk of water shortage for the transferor. The following describes the basic idea: An index system is established for the assessment of the water shortage risk of the transferor to identify water shortage risk categories. The impact of the water rights transaction volume on the transferor’s water shortage risk category is analyzed under different incoming water frequencies. The transferor’s water shortage risk threshold is set and a simulated annealing algorithm is designed to calculate the theoretical value of tradable water rights. The following summarizes the innovation of the proposed method: The water resource shortage risk evaluation index of the transferor is constructed based on water resource endowment, water supply, water demand, and water ecological environment of the transferor; then, a risk classification evaluation model of water resource shortage is established and a measurement method of tradable water rights is introduced. Comprehensive analysis of a case analysis of Helan County in the Ningxia Autonomous Region, China, shows that the recommended value of tradable water rights of Helan County is 40 million m 3 . Various methods are used to calculate the weights of evaluation indexes, which are compared to the measured results of tradable water rights; moreover, the sensitivity of the results is analyzed. The obtained results show that the use of water-saving potential to measure the amount of tradable water rights is feasible."
https://openalex.org/W3195217829,"Although docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an important dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), is at present primarily sourced from marine fish, bioengineered crops producing DHA may offer a more sustainable and cost-effective source. DHA has been produced in transgenic oilseed crops, however, DHA in seed oil primarily occupies the sn-1/3 positions of triacylglycerol (TAG) with relatively low amounts of DHA in the sn-2 position. To increase the amount of DHA in the sn-2 position of TAG and in seed oil, putative lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases (LPAATs) were identified and characterized from the DHA-producing alga Schizochytrium sp. and from soybean (Glycine max). The affinity-purified proteins were confirmed to have LPAAT activity. Expression of the Schizochytrium or soybean LPAATs in DHA-producing Arabidopsis expressing the Schizochytrium PUFA synthase system significantly increased the total amount of DHA in seed oil. A novel sensitive band-selective heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR method was developed to quantify DHA at the sn-2 position of glycerolipids. More than two-fold increases in sn-2 DHA were observed for Arabidopsis lines expressing Schizochytrium or soybean LPAATs, with one Schizochytrium LPAAT driving DHA accumulation in the sn-2 position to 61% of the total DHA. Furthermore, expression of a soybean LPAAT led to a redistribution of DHA-containing TAG species, with two new TAG species identified. Our results demonstrate that transgenic expression of Schizochytrium or soybean LPAATs can increase the proportion of DHA at the sn-2 position of TAG and the total amount of DHA in the seed oil of a DHA-accumulating oilseed plant. Additionally, the band-selective HSQC NMR method that we developed provides a sensitive and robust method for determining the regiochemistry of DHA in glycerolipids. These findings will benefit the advancement of sustainable sources of DHA via transgenic crops such as canola and soybean."

The role of socioeconomic status (SES) in immune activation amongst PLWH is unknown, especially in low-income sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where such impacts may be particularly severe.We recruited Malawian adults with CD4<100 cells/ul two weeks after starting ART in the REALITY trial (NCT01825031), as well as volunteers without HIV infection. Clinical assessment, socioeconomic evaluation, blood draw for immune activation markers and carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) were carried out at 2- and 42-weeks post-ART initiation. Socioeconomic risk factors for immune activation and arterial stiffness were assessed using linear regression models.Of 279 PLWH, the median (IQR) age was 36 (31-43) years and 122 (44%) were female. Activated CD8 T-cells increased from 70% amongst those with no education to 88% amongst those with a tertiary education (p = 0.002); and from 71% amongst those earning less than 10 USD/month to 87% amongst those earning between 100-150 USD/month (p = 0.0001). Arterial stiffness was also associated with higher SES (car ownership p = 0.003, television ownership p = 0.012 and electricity access p = 0.029). Conversely, intermediate monocytes were higher amongst those with no education compared to a tertiary education (12.6% versus 7.3%; p = 0.01) and trended towards being higher amongst those earning less than 10 USD/month compared to 100-150 USD/month (10.5% versus 8.0%; p = 0.08). Water kiosk use showed a protective association against T cell activation (p = 0.007), as well as endothelial damage (MIP1β, sICAM1 and sVCAM1 p = 0.047, 0.026 and 0.031 respectively).Socioeconomic risk factors for persistent inflammation amongst PLWH in SSA differ depending on the type of inflammatory pathway. Understanding these pathways and their socioeconomic drivers will help identify those at risk and target interventions for NCDs. Future studies assessing drivers of inflammation in HIV should include an SES assessment."
