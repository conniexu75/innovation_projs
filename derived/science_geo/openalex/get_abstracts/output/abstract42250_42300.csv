https://openalex.org/W1611407165,"Microtubule-associated protein tau was purified from bovine brain microtubules by either (1) phosphocellulose chromatography, (2) heat treatment at pH 6.4, (3) heat treatment at pH 2.7, (4) heat treatment at pH 2.7 followed by extraction with perchloric acid and precipitation with glycerol, or (5) by precipitation with ammonium sulfate followed by extraction with perchloric acid. All of these tau preparations reacted specifically with antibodies to Alzheimer paired helical filaments. Affinity purified antibodies to tau labeled both Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles and plaque neurites but not amyloid in Alzheimer brain tissue sections and labeled paired helical filament polypeptides on Western blots. Human brain tau and paired helical filament polypeptides co-migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. These results suggest that tau is a major component of Alzheimer paired helical filaments."
https://openalex.org/W2035826838,"We have characterized a cDNA clone that encodes a protein related to the 70 kd heat shock protein, but is expressed in normal rat liver. This protein has a hydrophobic leader and is secreted into the endoplasmic reticulum. We show that it is identical with two previously described proteins: GRP78, whose synthesis is induced by glucose starvation, and BiP, which is found bound to immunoglobulin heavy chains in pre-B cells. This protein, which is abundant in antibody-secreting cells, can be released from heavy chains by ATP, a reaction analogous to the release of hsp70 from heat shocked nuclear structures. We propose a specific role for this protein in the assembly of secreted and membrane-bound proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1969735301,"Recent studies of animals with complex nervous systems, including humans and other primates, have improved our understanding of how the brain accomplishes learning and memory. Major themes of recent work include the locus of memory storage, the taxonomy of memory, the distinction between declarative and procedural knowledge, and the question of how memory changes with time, that is, the concepts of forgetting and consolidation. An important recent advance is the development of an animal model of human amnesia in the monkey. The animal model, together with newly available neuropathological information from a well-studied human patient, has permitted the identification of brain structures and connections involved in memory functions."
https://openalex.org/W1497083865,"A unique cytochrome P-450-dependent fatty acid monooxygenase from Bacillus megaterium ATCC 14581 is strongly induced by phenobarbital (Narhi, L. O., and Fulco, A. J. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 2147-2150) and many other barbiturates (Kim, B.-H., and Fulco, A. J. (1983) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 116, 843-850). This monooxygenase has now been purified to homogeneity from pentobarbital-induced bacteria as a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of 119,000 +/- 5,000 daltons. In the presence of NADPH and O2, it can catalyze the oxygenation of long chain fatty acids without the aid of any other protein. The enzyme has a catalytic center activity of 4,600 nmol of fatty acid oxygenated per nmol of P-450 (the highest activity yet reported for a P-450-dependent monooxygenase) and also functions as a highly active cytochrome c reductase in the presence of NADPH. The purified holoenzyme is a soluble protein containing 40 mol % hydrophobic amino acid residues and 1 mol each of FAD and FMN/mol of heme. It is isolated and purified in the low spin form but is converted to the high spin form in the presence of long chain fatty acids. The enzyme, which catalyzes the omega-2 hydroxylation of saturated fatty acids and the hydroxylation and epoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids has its highest affinity (Km = 2 +/- 1 microM) for the C15 and C16 chain lengths."
https://openalex.org/W2058455617,"Activated mononuclear cells appear to be important effector cells in autoimmune beta cell destruction leading to insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus. Conditioned medium from activated mononuclear cells (from human blood) is cytotoxic to isolated rat and human islets of Langerhans. This cytotoxic activity was eliminated from crude cytokine preparations by adsorption with immobilized, purified antibody to interleukin-1 (IL-1). The islet-inhibitory activity and the IL-1 activity (determined by its comitogenic effect on thymocytes) were recovered by acid wash. Purified natural IL-1 and recombinant IL-1 derived from the predominant pI 7 form of human IL-1, consistently inhibited the insulin response. The pI 6 and pI 5 forms of natural IL-1 were ineffective. Natural and recombinant IL-1 exhibited similar dose responses in their islet-inhibitory effect and their thymocyte-stimulatory activity. Concentrations of IL-1 that inhibited islet activity were in the picomolar range. Hence, monocyte-derived pI 7 IL-1 may contribute to islet cell damage and therefore to the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W1516922966,"A membrane-bound protein cofactor (ARF) is required for the cholera toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation of the stimulatory regulatory component (Gs) of adenylate cyclase. Improved methods for the purification of ARF from bovine brain are described. ARF has a high-affinity binding site for guanine nucleotides. Binding of GTP or GTP gamma S to ARF is necessary for the activity of the cofactor; GDP X ARF does not support ADP-ribosylation of Gs. Although the protein as purified contains stoichiometric amounts of GDP, GTPase activity of isolated ARF was not detected. Cholera toxin-dependent activation of adenylate cyclase thus requires two guanine nucleotide binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2054657407,"von Willebrand factor (vWf) secreted constitutively by human endothelial cells was compared to that released from Weibel-Palade bodies after stimulation. The majority of constitutively secreted molecules were dimeric and contained both pro-vWf and mature subunits. In contrast, the vWf released by the calcium ionophore A23187 or thrombin consisted of only very large multimers of mature subunits. The large multimers are known to be more active in in vitro platelet binding assays, and their absence in vivo results in a bleeding disorder. Endothelial cells therefore concentrate a special subclass of very large and biologically potent vWf multimers in Weibel-Palade bodies, presumably available for release in response to vascular injury."
https://openalex.org/W1601059079,"Previously our laboratory reported the discovery of a novel protein-saccharide linkage in which single N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues are attached in O-linkages to protein (Torres, C. R., and Hart, G. W. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3308-3317). This linkage was first found on plasma membrane proteins of living cells by galactosylation with bovine milk galactosyltransferase. Here we report the distribution of O-linked GlcNAc in highly enriched rat liver subcellular organelles. Nonidet P-40 solubilized organelles were labeled by galactosyltransferase with UDP-[3H]galactose, and the amount of radiolabel occurring on GlcNAc residues in O-linkages was assessed by its sensitivity to beta-elimination and by its resistance to deglycosylation with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F. The presence of galactose-labeled O-linked GlcNAc residues was confirmed by high voltage paper electrophoresis. There is a 17-fold range per mg of protein in the amount of galactosylatable terminal GlcNAc residues found in the various organelles, as well as a wide range in the organelles' apparent content of O-linked GlcNAc residues. Nuclei and the soluble fraction of rat liver cells are particularly enriched with proteins bearing O-linked GlcNAc residues, although these residues are demonstrable in virtually all organelles tested. Furthermore, examination by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals that many different organelle-specific proteins are glycosylated with O-linked GlcNAc residues. Because of the wide occurrence of this unique linkage, these data suggest that glycosylation with O-linked GlcNAc residues is not an exclusive marker for a particular organelle. In addition, we have surveyed the organelles for their content of glycoproteins bearing GlcNAc-terminated N-linked oligosaccharides. Our data demonstrate that there are significant amounts of these oligosaccharides in rough and stripped microsomes, nuclei, and nuclear envelopes. In light of evidence that terminal GlcNAc transferases are localized to the Golgi complex, these data suggest that there are glycoproteins which enter into the Golgi for processing and then are transported back into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and possibly the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2074407786,"A specific DNA probe was used to study the effect of recombinant rat, mouse, and human gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) on the course of sporozoite-induced malaria infections. In mice and rats infected with sporozoites of Plasmodium berghei, mouse and rat gamma-IFN's strongly inhibited the development of the exoerythrocytic forms in the liver liver cells of the hosts, but not the development of the erythrocytic stages. The degree of inhibition of the exoerythrocytic forms was proportional to the dose of gamma-IFN administered, but was independent of the number of sporozoites used for challenge. A 30 percent reduction in the development of exoerythrocytic forms in rat liver was achieved when 150 units (about 15 nanograms of protein) of rat gamma-IFN were injected a few hours before sporozoite challenge; the reduction was 90 percent or more with higher doses of gamma-IFN. The effect was less pronounced if the gamma-IFN was administered 18 hours before or a few hours after challenge. Human gamma-IFN also diminished the parasitemia in chimpanzees infected with sporozoites of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax. The target of gamma-IFN activity may be the infected hepatocytes themselves, as shown by in vitro experiments in which small doses of the human lymphokine inhibited the development of exoerythrocytic forms of Plasmodium berghei in a human hepatoma cell line. These results suggest that immunologically induced interferon may be involved in controlling malaria infection under natural conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2096205803,"Hemopoietin-1 (H-1) is known to act synergistically with CSF-1, a mononuclear phagocyte growth factor, to induce the development of primitive hemopoietic cells. To determine whether purified H-1 also acts on multipotent hemopoietic cells, its ability to act synergistically with interleukin-3 (IL-3) and erythropoietin (Epo) was tested in methyl cellulose cultures of murine bone marrow cells. In the presence of IL-3, H-1 increased the number of colonies formed by primitive, multipotent cells by ∼30-fold. H-1 alone or H-1 plus Epo produced no colonies. Forty percent of the colonies induced by H-1 plus IL-3 contained cells that could be subcultured at least twice, whereas cells from colonies induced by IL-3 alone could not be similarly subcultured. Thus H-1 permits CSF-1 or IL-3 to act on cells more primitive than those acted on by either growth factor alone. The results indicate that H-1 acts on the most primitive hemopoletic cells yet shown to proliferate and differentiate in culture."

https://openalex.org/W1544256708,"Purified guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins, as either the oligomers or the isolated nucleotide-binding alpha subunits, display anomalous kinetics of nucleotide binding. This is due to the presence of tightly bound GDP in these preparations. The dissociation of bound GDP is the rate-limiting step for nucleotide binding. GDP can be removed by chromatography in the presence of 1 M (NH4)2SO4 and 20% glycerol, which yields preparations of G proteins that contain less than 0.1 mol of GDP/mol of guanosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S)-binding site. When the GDP is removed, the binding of GTP gamma S displays kinetics consistent with a bimolecular reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1969638997,"The Xenopus hsp70 promoter contains three copies of the consensus heat shock element (HSE) between positions -260 and -100. When the gene is transfected into mammalian cells, maximal heat-induced expression requires two HSEs in addition to a CCAAT box located next to the TATA box. The HSE-containing region can be separated from the CCAAT/TATA region without affecting expression of the gene, and it can enhance transcription of a linked beta-globin gene upon heat shock. It thus has the properties of a heat-inducible enhancer. Such an enhancer can also be generated by duplication of HSE sequences from the Drosophila hsp70 promoter, which were previously identified as an upstream promoter element and are known to bind a purified heat shock transcription factor in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2051350037,"The virulence loci of Agrobacterium tumefaciens are a set of linked transcriptional units that play an essential role in the early stages of plant tumorigenesis. These loci are induced upon cocultivation of the bacteria with plant cells. Seven phenolic compounds that are widely distributed among the angiosperm plants—catechol, gallic acid, pyrogallic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, β-resorcylic acid, and vanillin—are able to induce the expression of the virulence loci. These phenolics in combination induce each transcriptional locus of the vir loci. Furthermore, this induction displays similar kinetics and genetic control to that observed during cocultivation of the bacteria with plant cells."

https://openalex.org/W1499469957,"An approximately 75% pure form of a human Mr approximately 54,000 plasminogen activator inhibitor from conditioned culture fluid of the fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080 was obtained by a single step of chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose. The inhibitor inhibited human urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator, but not plasmin. Rabbit antibodies against this plasminogen activator inhibitor also reacted with a plasminogen activator inhibitor with identical electrophoretic mobility in extracts of human blood platelets, indicating that the HT-1080-inhibitor is of the same type as the inhibitor of blood platelets. As revealed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fibrin-agarose zymography, incubation of HT-1080-inhibitor with the active form of human u-PA led to the formation of an equimolar sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant complex between them; in contrast, no complex formation was observed between the inhibitor and the proenzyme form of human u-PA (pro-u-PA). Likewise, using a column of anti-inhibitor antibodies coupled to Sepharose for removal of excess inhibitor and activator-inhibitor complexes, the potential enzymatic activity of pro-u-PA was found to be unaffected by incubation with inhibitor under conditions in which more than 95% of the active u-PA had formed complex with inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1519216115,"Initial incorporation and subsequent remodeling of 16 phosphoglyceride molecular species containing arachidonate in the human neutrophil have been studied. Neutrophils were pulse-labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid (AA) for 5 min, then phospholipids were analyzed either at this time point or after a subsequent 120-min incubation. [3H]AA was found to be incorporated into phosphoglycerides phosphatidylinositol (PI) greater than phosphatidylcholine (PC) greater than phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by 5 min. Incorporation of [3H]AA was not related to pool size, but reflected an increase in phosphoglyceride turnover. Following the 120-min incubation, only PE gained a significant amount of labeled arachidonate. Specific activity analysis revealed that PI contained the highest labeled/unlabeled ratio at both 5 min and 120 min. After the initial 5-min pulse, the majority of [3H]arachidonate was incorporated into 1-acyl-2-[3H]arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-PC, -PE, and -PI showing no preference for fatty acyl chains at the sn-1 position. However, [3H]AA was remodeled into 1-alkyl-acyl-and 1-alk-1-enyl-acyl-sn-glycero-3-PC and -PE molecular species in those neutrophils incubated for the additional 120 min. Specific activities of [3H]AA within all diacyl molecular species were initially higher relative to those alkyl-acyl and alk-1-enyl-acyl molecular species, but for PC and PE became more uniform as label shifted into ether and plasmalogen pools during the additional 120-min incubation. In contrast, the specific activity of 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-PI remained constant throughout the 120-min incubation."
https://openalex.org/W2122959032,"Human leukemic cells corresponding to the earliest identifiable stages of intrathymic T cell differentiation lack cell surface expression of the T cell receptor(TCR alpha/beta)-T3 complex but transcribe TCR beta mRNA from either germ-line configuration (1/13) or partially (DJ) or fully (VDJ) rearranged (12/13) genes. These cells do not produce TCR alpha mRNA, but do contain T3 delta and T3 epsilon mRNA and accumulate T3 polypeptides, primarily in the perinuclear envelope. Equivalent normal T cells isolated from thymus have a predominantly germ-line configuration of TCR beta but contain intracellular T3 proteins. T3 gene expression is therefore a very early event in T cell differentiation. TCR alpha chain production appears to be the limiting maturation-linked event in the transport, assembly, and cell surface membrane insertion of the TCR alpha/beta-T3 complex."
https://openalex.org/W1995551561,"The c-fos gene is rapidly and transiently expressed when human U-937 and HL-60 leukemia cells are induced to differentiate to macrophages. We show that the expression of c-fos is controlled primarily at the transcriptional level. c-fos mRNA is very labile, with a half-life of less than 30 min. Superinduction of c-fos in the presence of cycloheximide occurs primarily because of stabilization of c-fos mRNA. When U-937 cells are serum-stimulated or treated with diacylglycerol, a c-kinase agonist, c-fos is transiently expressed to high levels; however, the cells fail to differentiate to macrophages. Furthermore, HL-60 cell variants resistant to TPA can be induced to differentiate to macrophages in the absence of detectable c-fos expression."
https://openalex.org/W1602129277,"Using minor modifications of procedures developed to purify GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) from rabbit liver, we have purified the major G-proteins present in human placental membranes. One, referred to as Gi, is the major substrate for pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation and has an alpha-subunit of 41,000 daltons, and beta-subunit of 36,000 and 35,000 daltons, and a gamma-subunit of 10,000 daltons. The other protein, referred to as Gp, was identified by its ability to bind guanine nucleotides specifically with high affinity. This activity was resolved from Gs and Gi by the second step of purification (AcA-34 chromatography) and was further purified through heptylamine-Sepharose and hydroxylapatite. The guanine nucleotide-binding site, which can be resolved by high performance liquid chromatography procedures and identified by a photolyzable GTP analogue, is associated with a 21,000-dalton protein (Gp alpha) that copurifies with beta gamma-subunits indistinguishable from the beta gamma-subunits associated with Gs and Gi. This protein represents a potentially novel member of the structurally and functionally homologous family of G-proteins that are transducing elements in the receptor-mediated regulation of a variety of cellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W1570879094,"It has been demonstrated recently by Poirier et al. (Poirier, G. G., de Murcia, G., Jongstra-Bilen, J., Niedergang, C., and Mandel, P. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 3423-3427) that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of pancreatic nucleosomes causes relaxation of the chromatin superstructure through H1 modification. The in vitro effect of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis and degradation on calf thymus chromatin was investigated by the time course incorporation of ADP-ribose, electron microscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and autoradiography of the protein acceptors. Purified calf thymus poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and partially purified bull testis poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase were used. Degradation of ADP-ribose units on hyper(ADP-ribosyl)ated H1 by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase restores the native condensed chromatin superstructure. This reversible conformational change induced by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation on nucleosomal arrangement could be one of the mechanisms by which the accessibility of DNA polymerases and/or excision-repair enzymes is favored, the native structure being fully restorable."
https://openalex.org/W1668867309,"Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase was purified to near homogeneity from the 105,000 X g supernatant of porcine leukocyte homogenate by immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal anti-5-lipoxygenase antibody. Reaction of the purified enzyme with arachidonic acid produced predominantly 5-hydroperoxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid with concomitant formation of several more polar compounds in smaller amounts. These minor products were identified as the degradation products of leukotriene A4, namely, 6-trans-leukotriene B4 (epimeric at C-12) and an epimeric mixture of 5,6-dihydroxy-7,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acids. These compounds were also produced by reaction of the enzyme with 5-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid. Association of the 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene A synthase activities was demonstrated by several experiments: heat inactivation of enzyme, effect of selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, requirements of calcium ion and ATP, and self-catalyzed inactivation of enzyme. The enzyme was also active with 12- and 15-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acids producing (5S,12S)- and (5S,15S)-dihydroperoxy acids, respectively. Maximal velocities of the reactions with these hydroperoxy acids as compared with that of arachidonic acid (100%, 0.6 mumol/3 min/mg of protein) were as follows: 5-hydroperoxy acid, 3.5%, 12-hydroperoxy acid, 22%, and 15-hydroperoxy acid, 30%."
https://openalex.org/W1679145101,"The cDNA encoding a phenobarbital-inducible form of rat liver UDP-glucuronosyltransferase has been isolated, sequenced, and expressed to yield a catalytically active enzyme. The cDNA was found to be 1,961 nucleotides in length and to have an open reading frame of 1,590 nucleotides flanked by 25 and 346 base pairs of 5‘ and 3‘ untranslated regions, respectively. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 529 residues (Mr = 60,484) and contains amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal segments characteristic of a signal peptide and a transmembrane-anchoring region, respectively. Two potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites are located between these segments. In an in vitro transcription-translation reaction, the cDNA directed the synthesis of a 52,000-dalton polypeptide with immunologic epitopes characteristic of native microsomal UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. This in vitro synthesized polypeptide was cleaved and glycosylated when dog pancreatic microsomes were included in the in vitro reaction. The coding region of the cDNA was inserted into a SV40 recombinant vector, and this construct transfected into permissive monkey kidney cells. Seventy hours after transfection, the glucuronidation of 4-methylumbelliferone was detected in lysates of cells containing the cDNA in the correct orientation with respect to SV40 transcription signals. This experimental approach should allow definitive characterization of the structure, function, and heterogeneity of this major family of drug-metabolizing enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2131159286,"Each segment of Drosophila has a characteristic pattern of muscles. Like the segments of the cuticle and the central nervous system, the muscle pattern is ultimately dependent on the deployment of selector genes such as elements of the bithorax complex. We use nuclear transplantation to make genetic mosaics in which the donor, but not the host, is mutant for part of the bithorax complex. Making use of a muscle pattern that is found only in the male, we ask which cells have to be mutant in order to obtain mutant muscles and find that these crucial cells do not contribute to the muscles themselves. The evidence implicates neurons that innervate the muscles. Our hypothesis is that the sex and segmental identity of the motor or neurosecretory neurons determine the development of muscle pattern."
https://openalex.org/W1484188159,"The GTP binding regulatory protein (Ni involved in adenylate cyclase inhibition was purified from rat brain and reconstituted, together with muscarinic cholinergic receptors purified from porcine brain, into phospholipid vesicles. Guanosine 5'-O-(3-[35S]thio)-triphosphate ([35S]GTP gamma S) binding and GTP hydrolyzing activities of reconstituted Ni were stimulated by the addition of a muscarinic agonist, carbachol. The effect of carbachol was to increase the Vmax values of these activities, but the Km values were also increased slightly in most cases. Carbachol bound to vesicles with the same order of magnitude of Km as that for stimulation of GTPase. The affinity of this binding was reduced by GTP gamma S, indicating that the high-affinity receptor-Ni complex was formed in a GTP-dependent manner in reconstituted vesicles. Incubation of Ni with NAD and islet-activating protein (IAP), pertussis toxin, caused ADP-ribosylation of the alpha-subunit of Ni. The criteria for the receptor-Ni interaction, i.e. carbachol stimulation of the activities of Ni and the GTP gamma S effect on carbachol binding, were no longer observed, when this IAP-treated Ni, instead of the nontreated Ni, was reconstituted into vesicles, though there was no difference between IAP-treated and nontreated Ni in their basal activities observable without carbachol. No, the protein with a character very similar to Ni in rat brain, was also coupled to muscarinic receptors when they were reconstituted into vesicles under the same conditions. Thus, GTP-binding proteins serving as the substrate of IAP-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation are capable of interaction functionally with muscarinic receptors in phospholipid vesicles."

The most striking feature of the predicted coding sequence, corresponding to the key 4.5 kb transcript from this locus, is an extensive run of alternating Gly-Thr residues. This is homologous to a series of Gly-Ser repeats in a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. To determine whether the per transcript codes for a proteoglycan, a region of its coding sequence was expressed (in bacteria) as part of a fusion protein, which was used to immunize rabbits. When the resultant immune sera were used to probe fly protein preparations, they detected an antigen that is present in wild-type flies and absent in a per- mutant. Biochemical characterization of this antigen indicated that it is indeed a proteoglycan."
https://openalex.org/W1554506362,"The abalone sperm adenylate cyclase does not appear to be regulated by guanine nucleotides, but has a Mg2+-supported catalytic activity similar to other hormone- and guanine nucleotide-regulated enzymes (Kopf, G. S., and Vacquier, V. D. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 7590-7596; Kopf, G. S., and Vacquier, V. D. (1985) Biol. Reprod. 33, 1094-1104). The present studies were undertaken to ascertain whether the abalone enzyme has associated guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins. Membrane fractions were incubated with either islet-activating protein (IAP) or cholera toxin and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the presence of toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylated proteins. The supernatant from a Lubrol PX-extracted 48,000 X g pellet fraction contained a Mr = 41,000 IAP substrate. This substrate could not be ADP-ribosylated prior to detergent extraction. Lubrol PX-solubilized fractions of membrane preparations from mouse, bovine, and human sperm also contained a Mr = 41,000 IAP substrate. These proteins co-migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with the Mr = 41,000 alpha i-subunit of the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (Gi) from transformed chicken embryo fibroblast and mouse S-49 lymphoma membrane extracts. The sperm IAP substrates displayed similar protease digest patterns to alpha i of mouse S-49 lymphoma cells. Sea urchin sperm analyzed in a similar manner contained a Mr = 39,000 IAP substrate. Cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of specific sperm membrane proteins was not observed in any of the sperm preparations tested. The presence of the beta-subunit common to both the stimulatory and inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory heterotrimers was confirmed in sperm using an antiserum directed against the purified beta-subunit of the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins from bovine brain. It is concluded that all of the sperm tested, with the possible exception of sea urchin sperm, contain a Gi-like protein. Additional properties of these proteins and their role(s) in sperm function are currently being examined."

https://openalex.org/W2027812727,"The availability of highly specific and homogeneous antibodies to human T cells by the hybridoma technique has elicited new interest in the clinical use of antibodies to lymphocytes as immunosuppressive agents. OKT3 is the murine monoclonal antibody that has been the most widely used in clinical transplantation to induce immunosuppression. This antibody recognizes a membrane molecular complex, exclusively present on mature human T lymphocytes, which is tightly linked to the T-cell antigen receptor. The long-term therapeutic use of murine monoclonal antibodies in vivo is hampered by the intense antibody response that occurs in most human patients. Thus, when administered alone, OKT3 manifests its immunosuppressive activity only during the 10 to 15 days that precede the onset of sensitization. The results presented here show, by use of isoelectrofocusing, that the antibody response to OKT3, already reported to be restricted in its specificity (only anti-isotypic and anti-idiotypic antibodies are produced), is in addition oligoclonal. This restriction of the anti-monoclonal response may suggest that an efficient way to circumvent the sensitization problem would be to administer consecutively different monoclonal antibodies presenting the same specificity but distinct idiotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1599147169,"Abstract D-Glucose transport was studied with isolated brush border membrane vesicles from guinea pig jejunum. Saturation curves were carried out at either 25 or 35 degrees C in buffers containing Na+, Li+, K+ (100 mM chloride salt), or sorbitol (200 mM). Uncorrected uptake rates were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis to an equation involving one diffusional and two saturable terms. In the presence of Na+ at 35 degrees C, two saturable systems (Km = 0.4 and 24 mM, respectively) were evident, as well as a diffusion component quantitatively identical with that measured with L-glucose in separate experiments. In contrast, at 25 degrees C only one saturable system was apparent (Km = 1.2 mM): the second exhibited diffusion-like kinetics. In the presence of Na+ at 35 degrees C, D-glucose uptake was fully inhibited by both D-glucose and D-galactose, whereas alpha-methylglucoside gave kinetics of partial inhibition. We conclude that in the presence of Na+ there are at least two distinct D-glucose transport systems: 1) System I, a low temperature-sensitive system, fully inhibited by D-glucose, D-galactose, and alpha-methylglucoside; we identify it as the classical D-glucose/Na+ cotransport system, insensitive to inhibition by cytochalasin B and obligatorily dependent on Na+; and 2) System II, a high temperature-sensitive system where D-glucose and D-galactose inhibit but alpha-methylglucoside is inert. Its cation specificity is unclear but it appears to be sensitive to cytochalasin B inhibition. When Li+ or K+ substituted for Na+, only one transport system was apparent. The Li+-activated transport was: independent of the incubation temperature; inhibited by D-glucose and D-galactose but not by alpha-methylglucoside, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, D-mannose, and D-xylose; and sensitive to cytochalasin B inhibition. The exact nature of the system (or systems) involved in D-glucose transport in the absence of sodium remains to be established."

This phosphatidylcholine analogue (1-palmitoyl-2-[10-[4-[(trifluoromethyl)diazirinyl]phenyl]-[3H] 9-oxaundecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), with the photoactivatable diazirine group on its apolar portion, has been shown to label selectively membrane-embedded domains of membrane proteins. Vinculin is significantly labeled upon incubation and photolysis with liposomes containing trace amounts of this photoactivatable phospholipid, but only when the liposomes also contain acidic phospholipids. Labeling of vinculin is markedly increased (5-17-fold) by all acidic phospholipids tested so far (30%, w/w), compared to labeling in neutral phospholipids. Labeling is high at low ionic strength, but significant vinculin labeling can still be observed at physiological salt concentrations and acidic phospholipid content of the membrane. Our results provide evidence that vinculin inserts into the hydrophobic part of the bilayer by interacting with acidic phospholipids. A similar interaction may be of importance in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2071967858,"The junctions, separating unit-length genomes in intracellular concatemeric forms of vaccinia virus DNA, are duplex copies of the hairpin loops that form the ends of mature DNA molecules present in infectious virus particles. Circular E. coli plasmids with palindromic junction fragments were replicated in vaccinia virus-infected cells and resolved into linear minichromosomes with vector DNA in the center and vaccinia virus DNA hairpins at the two ends. Resolution did not occur when the concatemer joint was less than 250 bp or when plasmids were transfected into uninfected cells, indicating requirements for a specific DNA structure and viral trans-acting factors. These studies indicate that concatemers can serve as replicative intermediates and account for the generation of flip-flop sequence variation of the hairpins at the ends of the mature vaccinia virus genome."
https://openalex.org/W1604191551,"NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase releases FAD upon dilution into slightly acidic potassium bromide. Chromatography on high performance hydroxylapatite resolved the FAD-dependent reductase from holoreductase. The FAD dependence was matched by a low FAD content, with the ratio of FAD to FMN as low as 0.015. The aporeductase had negligible activity toward cytochrome c, ferricyanide, menadione, dichlorophenolindophenol, nitro blue tetrazolium, and an analogue of NADP, acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate. A 4-min incubation in FAD reconstituted from one-half to all of the enzyme activity, as compared to the untreated reductase, depending upon the substrate. After a 2-h reconstitution, the reductase eluted from hydroxylapatite at the same location in the elution profile as did the untreated holoreductase. The reconstituted reductase had little flavin dependence, was nearly equimolar in FMN and FAD, and had close to the specific activity, per mol of flavin, of untreated reductase. The dependence upon FAD implies that FMN is not a competent electron acceptor from NADPH. Thus, the FAD site must be the only point of electron uptake from NADPH."
https://openalex.org/W1527007871,"A phospholipase C which hydrolyzes [14C]phosphatidylcholine has been purified 1782-fold from 70% ammonium sulfate extract of bull seminal plasma. Purification steps included acid precipitation, chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, concanavalin A, octyl-Sepharose 4B and Ultrogel AcA 34. The final step provided homogeneous phospholipase C as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme comprised two subunits, Mr 69,000 and Mr 55,000, respectively. The enzyme had an optimum at pH 7.2 and pI 5.0. EDTA, Cd2+, Pb2+, Ni2+, Fe2+, and Zn2+ inhibited phospholipase C activity. Km and Vmax on p-nitrophenyl phosphorylcholine and phosphatidylcholine substrates were 20 mM and 17 mumol/min/mg of the purified enzyme and 100 microM and 18 mumol/min/mg of the purified enzyme, respectively. The enzyme appeared to be localized in the acrosome as judged by the binding of anti-phospholipase C to the acrosome. This phospholipase C, unlike other known phospholipases (C), did not hydrolyze [1-14C]phosphatidylinositol. The testicular extract of the guinea pig contained inactive phospholipase C which was activated on incubation with acrosin and trypsin but not chymotrypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1490556115,"An essential function of C-cells is to monitor extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]e) and to respond to changes in [Ca2+]e by regulating hormone secretion. Using the calcitonin-secreting rat C-cell line rMTC 44-2, we have investigated a possible tight linkage between [Ca2+]e and cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca/+]i). We have demonstrated, using the Ca2+ indicator Quin 2, that the [Ca2+]i is particularly sensitive to changes in [Ca2+]e. Sequential increases in [Ca2+]e as small as 0.1 mM evoke clear elevations in [Ca2+]i. In contrast, other cell types tested did not alter their [Ca2+]i in response to increasing [Ca2+]e even to levels as high as 4.0 mM. Sequential 1.0 mM increments in [Ca2+]e caused the [Ca2+]i to rise from a base line of 357 +/- 20 nM Ca2+i at 1.0 mM Ca2+e to a maximum of 1066 +/- 149 nM Ca2+i at 5.0 mM Ca2+e. [Ca2+]e above 2.0 mM produced a biphasic response in [Ca2+]i consisting of an immediate (less than 5 s) spike followed by a decay to a new plateau. Treatment of rMTC 44-2 cells with either 50 mM K+ or 100 nM ionomycin at 1.0 mM Ca2+e caused an immediate spike in [Ca2+]i to micromolar levels. Pretreatment with EGTA or verapamil inhibited completely the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by 50 mM K+. However, pretreatment with EGTA only slightly attenuated the spike phase in [Ca2+]i produced by ionomycin, demonstrating that ionomycin released intracellular stores of calcium. We conclude that rMTC 44-2 cells regulate [Ca2+]i by monitoring small physiological changes in [Ca2+]e, the primary secretagogue for C-cells."
https://openalex.org/W1502751317,"Abstract Isolated beef heart mitochondria were treated with A23187 in the presence of different concentrations of Mg2+ or EDTA to establish varying levels of total mitochondrial Mg2+. The Mg2+ content was related to the rate of passive swelling of the mitochondria in potassium acetate and other potassium salts in which swelling is presumed to depend on K+ entry via an endogenous K+/H+ antiport. Swelling in these salts does not commence until Mg2+ has been depleted from an initial value of 36 nmol X mg-1 of protein to 8 nmol/mg-1, or less. Below this level, swelling increases linearly with decreasing Mg2+ to a maximum rate at 2 nmol of Mg2+ X mg-1. Rotenone-treated heart mitochondria suspended in 75 mM potassium acetate at pH 7.80 show no delta pH by 5,5-dimethyl-2,4-oxazolidinedione distribution. Distribution of methylamine also shows essentially no delta pH under these conditions when allowance is made for binding of [14C]methylamine by mitochondrial membranes under these conditions. Addition of A23187 results in a small and transient delta pH (delta pH less than 0.14, acid interior) as measured by methylamine distribution. Estimation of the maximum matrix free Mg2+ concentration from the maximum delta pH observed and the external free Mg2+ concentration at equilibrium with A23187 shows that swelling is not initiated until matrix free Mg2+ is decreased to below 150 microM. An independent estimate of free Mg2+ using a null-point procedure gives a lower, but quite similar value (50 microM) for maximum matrix free Mg2+ when swelling commences. The large depletion of total and free Mg2+ that is required to activate swelling in potassium acetate (and presumably K+/H+ antiport activity) does not appear to be compatible with previous indications that free Mg2+ acts as a carrier brake to regulate K+ extrusion from the mitochondrion on such an antiport (Garlid, K. D. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 11273-11279). The removal of a tightly bound component of mitochondrial Mg2+ is closely related to increased K+ permeability and increased passive swelling in potassium salts. This Mg2+ appears to play a role in the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane structure and integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2002981550,"Transcription of immunoglobulin κ genes is regulated by enhancer and promoter elements, both of which function in a tissue-specific fashion. We have studied the interaction of these elements by transfecting plasmacytoma cells with genes that have tandem κ promoters located next to a single κ enhancer and assaying these genes for transient or stable transcription. We find that the promoters located proximal and distal to the enhancer function identically whether they are separated by 440 bp or by 2.7 kb or whether they are located 1.7 or 7.7 kb away from the enhancer. Our results indicate that the immunoglobulin κ enhancer does not operate as a bidirectional entry site for RNA polymerase or for other factors associated with the transcription complex. Rather, they suggest that the enhancer exerts its influence uniformly over large distances and independently of the presence of intervening promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1511257425,"DNA ligase II has been purified about 4,000-fold to apparent homogeneity from a calf thymus extract. The ligase consists of a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of 68,000 as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. On fluorography after electrophoresis, a DNA ligase-[3H]AMP complex gave a single band corresponding to a molecular weight of 68,000. The Km values of the ligase for ATP and nicked DNA (5'-phosphoryl ends) were obtained to be 40 and 0.04 microM, respectively. Antibody against calf thymus DNA ligase II was prepared by injecting the purified enzyme into a rabbit. The antibody cross-reacted with DNA ligase II but not with calf thymus DNA ligase I. DNA ligase II was not affected by antibody against calf thymus DNA ligase I with a molecular weight of 130,000 (Teraoka, H. and Tsukada, K. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4758-4763). These results indicate that DNA ligase II (Mr = 68,000) is immunologically distinct from DNA ligase I (Mr = 130,000)."

Nitrogenase and ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase are protein complexes that are, respectively, active in heterocysts and absent from vegetative cells, and active in vegetative cells and absent from heterocysts. The structural genes for the proteins of these two complexes are found to be in close proximity within one of the linkage groups. Other genes have also been tentatively localized on the basis of heterologous hybridization. Possible methods for linking the defined linkage groups are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1485093206,"Cadaverine links covalently to the D-glutamic acid residue of the peptidoglycan in Selenomonas ruminantium, a strictly anaerobic Gram-negative bacterium (Kamio, Y., Itoh, Y., and Terawaki, Y. (1981) J. Bacteriol. 146, 49-53). This report clarifies a physiological function of cadaverine in this organism by using DL-alpha-difluoromethyllysine, which had previously been shown to be a selective irreversible inhibitor of lysine decarboxylase of Mycoplasma dispar (Poso, H., MaCann, P.P., Tanskanen, R., Bey, P., and Sjoerdsma, A. (1984) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 125, 205-210). DL-alpha-Difluoromethyllysine is now shown to be a potent and irreversible inhibitor of lysine decarboxylase of S. ruminantium in vitro; however, it did not inhibit the transfer of cadaverine to the alpha-carboxyl group of the D-glutamic acid residue of the peptidoglycan. DL-alpha-Difluoromethyllysine at 5 mM markedly inhibited the growth of the bacterium and caused rapid cell lysis. Immediately before the cell lysis, almost all cells became swollen, and such cells showed a loosened envelope structure when studied by electron microscopy. The peptidoglycan prepared from the DL-alpha-difluoromethyllysine-treated cells did not have covalently linked cadaverine. The growth inhibition by DL-alpha-difluoromethyllysine was completely reversed by adding cadaverine (1 mM) to the medium. Furthermore, the exogenous cadaverine was exclusively incorporated into the peptidoglycan in the presence of DL-alpha-difluoromethyllysine (5 mM), and a normal peptidoglycan was synthesized. The cell lysis and the formation of an abnormal cell structure were completely prevented by cadaverine added to the medium. We conclude that cadaverine covalently linked to the peptidoglycan in S. ruminantium is an essential constituent of the peptidoglycan and is required for cell surface integrity and the normal growth of S. ruminantium."
https://openalex.org/W1593791665,"The embryonic rat parietal yolk sac has been previously shown to synthesize a number of basement membrane glycoconjugates including type IV procollagen, laminin, and entactin. In this study, parietal yolk sacs were isolated from 14.5-day rat embryos and incubated in organ culture for 4-7 h with [35S]sulfate, [3H] glucosamine, and/or 3H-labeled amino acids, and the newly synthesized proteoglycans were characterized. The major [35S]sulfate-labeled macromolecule represented approximately 90% of the medium and 80% of the tissue radioactivity. It also represented nearly 80% of the total [3H]glucosamine-labeled glycosaminoglycans. After purification by sequential ion-exchange chromatography and isopycnic CsCI density gradient ultracentrifugation, size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography showed a single species with an estimated Mr of 8-9 X 10(5). The intact proteoglycan did not form aggregates in the presence of exogenous hyaluronic acid or cartilage aggregates. Alkaline borohydride treatment released glycosaminoglycan chains with Mr of 2.0 X 10(4) which were susceptible to chondroitinase AC II and chondroitinase ABC digestion. Analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography of the disaccharides generated by chondroitinase ABC digestion revealed that chondroitin 6-sulfate was the predominant isomer. The uronic acid content of the glycosaminoglycans was 92% glucuronic acid and 8% iduronic acid, and the hexosamine content was 96% galactosamine and 4% glucosamine. No significant amounts of N- or O-linked oligosaccharides were detected. Deglycosylation of the proteoglycan with chondroitinase ABC in the presence of protease inhibitors revealed a protein core with an estimated Mr of 1.25-1.35 X 10(5). These results indicated that the major proteoglycan synthesized by the 14.5-day rat embryo parietal yolk sac is a high-density chondroitin sulfate containing small amounts of copolymeric dermatan sulfate. Hyaluronic acid and minor amounts of heparan sulfate proteoglycan were also detected."
https://openalex.org/W2067966439,"Three Drosophila salivary gland glue genes show a dramatic transition in their DNAse I hypersensitive sites during the short period between the late third instar and the white prepupa, which correlates with the cessation of their transcription. In culture cells, where the genes are inactive, there is a chromatin configuration similar to that of prepupal salivary glands. In two transformed fly strains where the sgs3 gene is active at new chromosomal sites, including one in which 2.6 kb of sgs3 upstream sequences have been inverted, the same DNAase I hypersensitive sites and developmental transitions are seen over the same DNA regions. These results, together with the analysis of transformants carrying rearranged sgs3 genes, suggest that there is at least one distal DNAase I hypersensitive site associated with an element of regulation which may be exchanged between sgs genes."
https://openalex.org/W1507301406,"A series of mouse monoclonal antibodies has been developed against a soluble form of bovine UDP-galactose:N-acetylglucosamine galactosyltransferase purified to apparent chemical homogeneity by a combination of affinity and immunoadsorption chromatography. The purified enzyme consists of two molecular mass variants of 42 and 48 kDa. Individual monoclonal antibodies were selected for by their ability to recognize immobilized affinity-purified galactosyltransferase and were not reactive against bovine alpha-lactalbumin and bovine immunoglobulins. Based on competitive binding assays and Western blot analysis with either galactosyltransferase or lactose synthetase (covalently cross-linked alpha-lactalbumin galactosyltransferase), these monoclonal antibodies can be subdivided into four groups. Group A (3 clones) recognize an epitope at or near the alpha-lactalbumin binding site. In addition, this group is cross-reactive with soluble galactosyltransferase from human milk and pleural effusion. Group B (6 clones) and D (1 clone) appear to recognize two different epitopes on the 6-kDa fragment which is released when the 48-kDa galactosyltransferase polypeptide is converted to the 42-kDa form, apparently by proteolysis. Groups A and C (1 clone) recognize epitopes found on both the 48- and 42-kDa polypeptide. Interestingly, immunofluorescence studies indicate that only two monoclonal antibody groups (C and D) are able to decorate membrane-bound galactosyltransferase (Golgi-associated) in formalin-fixed, methanol-, or detergent-permeabilized cells. Thus, these groups of monoclonal antibodies appear to identify four separate structural/functional domains on soluble galactosyltransferase, two of which are not readily accessible for binding in situ."
https://openalex.org/W1513898424,"Previously, we reported that incorporation of threo-beta-fluoroasparagine into cellular protein inhibits N-linked glycosylation. We now show that short synthetic peptides which contain N-acetyl-threo-beta-fluoroasparagine fail to undergo glycosylation in a cell-free system except at extremely high substrate concentrations. An N-benzoyl-threo-beta-fluoroasparagine-containing peptide has a 100-fold lower Vmax/Km than the analogous N-benzoyl-asparagine-containing peptide. Substitution of a fluorine for a hydrogen on the beta-carbon of asparagine weakens the ability of the peptide to bind the oligosaccharyltransferase. A 100-fold excess of acetyl-threo-beta-fluoroasparaginyl-leucyl-threonine methylamide over acetyl-asparaginyl-leucyl-threonine methylamide inhibited glycosylation of the latter peptide by less than 10%. Both threo-beta-fluoroasparagine and erythro-beta-fluoroasparagine-containing peptides are glycosylated at the same rate. Glycofluoropeptides generated from beta-fluoroasparagine-containing peptides were N-glycosylated. These cell-free studies with synthetic fluoropeptides suggest that incorporation of beta-fluoroasparagine into cellular protein inhibits N-linked glycosylation by rendering protein substrates ineffective for glycosylation. In the course of this work, we also demonstrate that the N-linked glycosylating enzyme acts only on L-asparagine-containing peptides and not on D-asparagine peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2142509180,"Terbium was used as a probe of Ca2+-binding sites on the prothrombin-phospholipid complex. Stoichiometric titrations of prothrombin binding to phospholipid vesicles with either Tb3+ or Ca2+ showed that a minimum of 8 metal ions were needed for binding prothrombin to vesicles (3 Mn2+ + 5 Ca2+ for prothrombin or 8 Tb3+ for F-1). When Ca2+ alone was used, a total of about 11 metal ions were needed for complete binding. These stoichiometries indicated 3 classes of metal ions: one class needed to induce the conformational change, a second required for protein-membrane contact, and a third class bound at other sites on the protein that are not involved in membrane binding. By adding Tb3+ to solutions containing both protein and phospholipid, undesirable Tb3+-induced events, such as irreversible aggregation of prothrombin or vesicle fusion, were avoided. Protein-vesicle binding apparently prevented protein aggregation or vesicle fusion. The protein-vesicle binding affinity was severalfold greater in the presence of Tb3+ compared to Ca2+. CoEDTA quenching of Tb3+ bound to the prothrombin-phospholipid complexes indicated that all metal ions were at least partially exposed to the quencher. Some populations of Tb3+ showed lower quenching constants when all of the prothrombin was bound. Tb3+ emission lifetimes revealed that some Tb3+ ions in the protein-membrane complex were in a different environment from those bound to the protein alone. The results indicated that the metal ions in the prothrombin-membrane complex are relatively open to the solvent yet do affect the characteristics of the protein-membrane binding equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W1573087062,"Both temperature-stable and temperature-labile testicular cholesteryl ester hydrolases are shown to be regulated by an endogenous cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. The temperature-stable form (Mr = 28,000) was activated 3-fold by the endogenous kinase. This activation was completely blocked by protein kinase inhibitor. Following purification by high performance gel permeation chromatography, the temperature-stable form could also be activated 2-fold by bovine heart protein kinase, type I. The partially purified endogenous protein kinase, type I, which was completely separated from hydrolase activity by ion exchange chromatography, increased hydrolase activity 2-fold in the presence of optimal concentrations of cAMP, ATP, and Mg2+. Cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity could be stabilized indefinitely at -10 degrees C with the addition of 0.1 mM thioglycolate, but not by other thiol reagents. In contrast, the endogenous protein kinase activity was lost from 104,000 X g supernatants after 14 days. However, the property of activation could be restored by addition of bovine heart protein kinase. The temperature-labile hydrolase (Mr = 72,000) could be totally inactivated by a Mg2+-dependent, fluoride-sensitive cytosolic factor and reactivated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These observations strongly suggest that the inactivating factor is a phosphoprotein phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1589617410,"Mead (5,8,11-icosatrienoic) acid was found to be metabolized by the cyclooxygenase enzyme system of ram seminal vesicle microsomes in a calcium-dependent manner. Although the enzyme converted Mead acid to products more slowly and less completely than the isomeric 8,11,14-icosatrienoic acid, both oxidations were inhibitable by indomethacin. Experiments using purified cyclooxygenase confirmed the participation of this enzyme system in the calcium-dependent oxidation. The products of the oxidation were separated by high performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by ultraviolet and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The spectra obtained were consistent with the products having the structures 13-hydroxy-5,8,11-icosatrienoate (the major product), 11-hydroxy-5,8,12-icosatrienoate, 9-hydroxy-5,7,11-icosatrienoate, and two isomeric 8,11-dihydroxy-5,9,12-icosatrienoates. No prostaglandin-like, cyclized products could be identified.
