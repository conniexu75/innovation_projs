https://openalex.org/W2972422665,"During cancer therapy, tumor heterogeneity can drive the evolution of multiple tumor subclones harboring unique resistance mechanisms in an individual patient1-3. Previous case reports and small case series have suggested that liquid biopsy (specifically, cell-free DNA (cfDNA)) may better capture the heterogeneity of acquired resistance4-8. However, the effectiveness of cfDNA versus standard single-lesion tumor biopsies has not been directly compared in larger-scale prospective cohorts of patients following progression on targeted therapy. Here, in a prospective cohort of 42 patients with molecularly defined gastrointestinal cancers and acquired resistance to targeted therapy, direct comparison of postprogression cfDNA versus tumor biopsy revealed that cfDNA more frequently identified clinically relevant resistance alterations and multiple resistance mechanisms, detecting resistance alterations not found in the matched tumor biopsy in 78% of cases. Whole-exome sequencing of serial cfDNA, tumor biopsies and rapid autopsy specimens elucidated substantial geographic and evolutionary differences across lesions. Our data suggest that acquired resistance is frequently characterized by profound tumor heterogeneity, and that the emergence of multiple resistance alterations in an individual patient may represent the 'rule' rather than the 'exception'. These findings have profound therapeutic implications and highlight the potential advantages of cfDNA over tissue biopsy in the setting of acquired resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2955994579,"A large number of putative cis-regulatory sequences have been annotated in the human genome, but the genes they control remain poorly defined. To bridge this gap, we generate maps of long-range chromatin interactions centered on 18,943 well-annotated promoters for protein-coding genes in 27 human cell/tissue types. We use this information to infer the target genes of 70,329 candidate regulatory elements and suggest potential regulatory function for 27,325 noncoding sequence variants associated with 2,117 physiological traits and diseases. Integrative analysis of these promoter-centered interactome maps reveals widespread enhancer-like promoters involved in gene regulation and common molecular pathways underlying distinct groups of human traits and diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2948766130,"Hindered ethers are of high value for various applications; however, they remain an underexplored area of chemical space because they are difficult to synthesize via conventional reactions1,2. Such motifs are highly coveted in medicinal chemistry, because extensive substitution about the ether bond prevents unwanted metabolic processes that can lead to rapid degradation in vivo. Here we report a simple route towards the synthesis of hindered ethers, in which electrochemical oxidation is used to liberate high-energy carbocations from simple carboxylic acids. These reactive carbocation intermediates, which are generated with low electrochemical potentials, capture an alcohol donor under non-acidic conditions; this enables the formation of a range of ethers (more than 80 have been prepared here) that would otherwise be difficult to access. The carbocations can also be intercepted by simple nucleophiles, leading to the formation of hindered alcohols and even alkyl fluorides. This method was evaluated for its ability to circumvent the synthetic bottlenecks encountered in the preparation of 12 chemical scaffolds, leading to higher yields of the required products, in addition to substantial reductions in the number of steps and the amount of labour required to prepare them. The use of molecular probes and the results of kinetic studies support the proposed mechanism and the role of additives under the conditions examined. The reaction manifold that we report here demonstrates the power of electrochemistry to access highly reactive intermediates under mild conditions and, in turn, the substantial improvements in efficiency that can be achieved with these otherwise-inaccessible intermediates. A route to the synthesis of hindered ethers is developed, in which electrochemical oxidation is used to liberate high-energy carbocations that are then captured by an alcohol."
https://openalex.org/W2973012689,"Organic photovoltaic cells are now approaching commercially viable efficiencies, particularly for applications that make use of their unique potential for flexibility and semitransparency1-3. However, their reliability remains a major concern, as even the most stable devices reported so far degrade within only a few years4-8. This has led to the belief that short operational lifetimes are an intrinsic disadvantage of devices that are fabricated using weakly bonded organic materials-an idea that persists despite the rapid growth and acceptance of organic light-emitting devices, which can achieve lifetimes of several million hours9. Here we study an extremely stable class of thermally evaporated single-junction organic photovoltaic cells. We accelerated the ageing process by exposing the packaged cells to white-light illumination intensities of up to 37 Suns. The cells maintained more than 87 per cent of their starting efficiency after exposure for more than 68 days. The degradation rate increases superlinearly with intensity, leading to an extrapolated intrinsic lifetime, T80, of more than 4.9 × 107 hours, where T80 is the time taken for the power conversion efficiency to decrease to 80 per cent of its initial value. This is equivalent to 27,000 years outdoors. Additionally, we subjected a second group of organic photovoltaic cells to 20 Suns of ultraviolet illumination (centred at 365 nanometres) for 848 hours, a dose that would take 1.7 × 104 hours (9.3 years) to accumulate outdoors. No efficiency loss was observed over the duration of the test. Overall, we find that organic solar cells packaged in an inert atmosphere can be extremely stable, which is promising for their future use as a practical energy-generation technology."

https://openalex.org/W2972857012,"Mitochondria vary in morphology and function in different tissues; however, little is known about their molecular diversity among cell types. Here we engineered MitoTag mice, which express a Cre recombinase-dependent green fluorescent protein targeted to the outer mitochondrial membrane, and developed an isolation approach to profile tagged mitochondria from defined cell types. We determined the mitochondrial proteome of the three major cerebellar cell types (Purkinje cells, granule cells and astrocytes) and identified hundreds of mitochondrial proteins that are differentially regulated. Thus, we provide markers of cell-type-specific mitochondria for the healthy and diseased mouse and human central nervous systems, including in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Based on proteomic predictions, we demonstrate that astrocytic mitochondria metabolize long-chain fatty acids more efficiently than neuronal mitochondria. We also characterize cell-type differences in mitochondrial calcium buffering via the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (Mcu) and identify regulator of microtubule dynamics protein 3 (Rmdn3) as a determinant of endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria proximity in Purkinje cells. Our approach enables exploring mitochondrial diversity in many in vivo contexts."

https://openalex.org/W2972339980,"Conventional leg prostheses do not convey sensory information about motion or interaction with the ground to above-knee amputees, thereby reducing confidence and walking speed in the users that is associated with high mental and physical fatigue1–4. The lack of physiological feedback from the remaining extremity to the brain also contributes to the generation of phantom limb pain from the missing leg5,6. To determine whether neural sensory feedback restoration addresses these issues, we conducted a study with two transfemoral amputees, implanted with four intraneural stimulation electrodes7 in the remaining tibial nerve (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03350061). Participants were evaluated while using a neuroprosthetic device consisting of a prosthetic leg equipped with foot and knee sensors. These sensors drive neural stimulation, which elicits sensations of knee motion and the sole of the foot touching the ground. We found that walking speed and self-reported confidence increased while mental and physical fatigue decreased for both participants during neural sensory feedback compared to the no stimulation trials. Furthermore, participants exhibited reduced phantom limb pain with neural sensory feedback. The results from these proof-of-concept cases provide the rationale for larger population studies investigating the clinical utility of neuroprostheses that restore sensory feedback. A new prosthetic leg that can transmit sensory signals via implanted electrodes is shown to restore meaningful sensory feedback that improves walking performance and lowers phantom limb pain during use in two human lower-limb amputees."

https://openalex.org/W2972926468,"The inability to preserve vascular organs beyond several hours contributes to the scarcity of organs for transplantation1,2. Standard hypothermic preservation at +4 °C (refs. 1,3) limits liver preservation to less than 12 h. Our group previously showed that supercooled ice-free storage at -6 °C can extend viable preservation of rat livers4,5 However, scaling supercooling preservation to human organs is intrinsically limited because of volume-dependent stochastic ice formation. Here, we describe an improved supercooling protocol that averts freezing of human livers by minimizing favorable sites of ice nucleation and homogeneous preconditioning with protective agents during machine perfusion. We show that human livers can be stored at -4 °C with supercooling followed by subnormothermic machine perfusion, effectively extending the ex vivo life of the organ by 27 h. We show that viability of livers before and after supercooling is unchanged, and that after supercooling livers can withstand the stress of simulated transplantation by ex vivo normothermic reperfusion with blood."

Complex carbohydrates—oligosaccharides and polysaccharides of diverse residue and linkage composition—are central to a wide range of biological processes, such as energy storage, inflammation, host–pathogen interactions, diseases, and differentiation/development (1Varki A. Essentials of Glycobiology.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2017Google Scholar).

The synthesis, rearrangement, and ultimate saccharification of the vast diversity of glycosidic linkages in natural carbohydrates require a correspondingly broad range of specific carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). 4The abbreviations used are: CAZymecarbohydrate-active enzymeSSNsequence similarity networkHMMhidden Markov modelMSAmultiple sequence alignmentGHglycoside hydrolase (family)CBMcarbohydrate-binding modulePDBProtein Data BankXETxyloglucan endo-transglycosylase. In light of the continually accelerating rate of sequence data deposition, the CAZy database has emerged as a central resource uniting specificity, mechanistic, and structural information within actively curated, sequence-based families of glycosyltransferases, glycoside hydrolases (GHs), polysaccharide lyases, carbohydrate esterases, auxiliary activity enzymes, and associated noncatalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) (7Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. The carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy) in 2013.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24270786): D490-D49510.1093/nar/gkt1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (4141) Google Scholar, 8CAZypedia ConsortiumTen years of CAZypedia: a living encyclopedia of carbohydrate-active enzymes.Glycobiology. 2018; 28 (29040563): 3-810.1093/glycob/cwx089Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The CAZy classification offers extraordinary predictive power on the family level, whereby the key active-site residues, the catalytic mechanism, and the overall three-dimensional fold are generally strictly conserved. Family classification is also a broad predictor of substrate specificity, in terms of overall glycosidic linkage orientation (α or β) and saccharide composition. However, the subtle natural variations in configuration among structurally related groups of complex carbohydrates has given rise to several “polyspecific” families, which comprise diverse activities. As it pertains to genomics and bioinformatics, polyspecificity confounds precise functional annotation of CAZyme family members in the absence of biochemical data (7Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. The carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy) in 2013.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24270786): D490-D49510.1093/nar/gkt1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (4141) Google Scholar). carbohydrate-active enzyme sequence similarity network hidden Markov model multiple sequence alignment glycoside hydrolase (family) carbohydrate-binding module Protein Data Bank xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase. The problem of polyspecificity is especially significant among large CAZyme families, which may encompass tens of thousands of sequences from taxonomically diverse organisms. In such cases, division into subfamilies based on molecular phylogeny has been shown to significantly increase predictive power in a handful of GH and polysaccharide lyase families previously (9Aspeborg H.

However, a major limitation of large-scale phylogenetic analyses is the dependence on a highly accurate multiple sequence alignment (MSA) (14Liu K. Linder C.R. Warnow T. Multiple sequence alignment: a major challenge to large-scale phylogenetics.PLoS Curr. 2010; 2 (21113338)RRN1198PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequent phylogenetic tree estimation, in which the computational complexity increases exponentially with the number of sequences (15Carrillo H. Lipman D. The multiple sequence alignment problem in biology.SIAM J. Appl. Math. 1988; 48: 1073-108210.1137/0148063Crossref Google Scholar). As the number of nonredundant sequences in the CAZy database increases (7Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. The carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy) in 2013.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24270786): D490-D49510.1093/nar/gkt1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (4141) Google Scholar), highly accurate subfamily phylogenies will be infeasible for most families in the foreseeable future. Sequence similarity networks (SSNs), which are conceptually illustrated in Fig. 1, offer a potential solution to this conundrum. In contrast to MSA-based phylogenies, SSNs are based on all-versus-all pairwise local sequence alignments, the computational requirements of which scales linearly with the number of sequences and are easily amenable to parallelization. Notably, the resulting networks of nodes and edges, which can be rapidly generated using any Expect (E) value or bit score as a threshold, usually resolve the same monophyletic groups observed in corresponding phylogenetic trees (16Atkinson H.J. Morris J.H. Ferrin T.E. Babbitt P.C.

Like phylogenetic approaches, SSNs can underpin the creation of subfamilies and establish a robust framework to predict substrate specificity and highlight unexplored sequence space (17Copp J.N. Akiva E. Babbitt P.C. Tokuriki N. Revealing unexplored sequence–function space using sequence similarity networks.Biochemistry. 2018; 57 (30052428): 4651-466210.1021/acs.biochem.8b00473Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Glycoside hydrolase family 16 (GH16) is a polyspecific family of β-glycanases involved in the degradation or remodeling of cell wall polysaccharides in marine and terrestrial biomass (see Table 1). GH16 represents a current challenge for functional subfamily classification because of its large size and diversity.

The subfamily topology was equal to that obtained by classical phylogenetic analysis of a reduced sequence data set. The resulting robust subfamilies were used in turn to generate hidden Markov models (HMMs), which will form the basis for the automated incorporation of new sequences into the continually expanding CAZy database. All-versus-all pairwise local sequence alignments were calculated for 22,946 GH16 domain sequences from the CAZy database in 210 min on a desktop computer (Intel Xeon Processor E5-1620 v4, 8 cores, 3.5 GHz, 16 GB RAM). For comparison, the computational time was reduced to 13 min using 128 cores on Compute Canada’s WestGrid high-performance infrastructure. Subsequently, the BLAST result file was indexed over thresholds in intervals of 5 log units for E values between 10−5 and 10−120. Our preliminary SSN and HMM analyses indicated that the 10 SSNs for E-value thresholds between 10−20 and 10−65 were of most interest with the number of subfamilies ranging from 3 at E = 10−20 to 27 at E = 10−65 (Fig. 2). Mapping sequence origin and the 15 currently known substrate specificities (from nearly 200 biochemically characterized GH16 proteins (7Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. The carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy) in 2013.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24270786): D490-D49510.1093/nar/gkt1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (4141) Google Scholar) (Table 1) reveals the distribution of these features across emergent subfamilies (Fig. 2). To determine the threshold at which optimal discrimination of subfamilies is achieved, a library of HMMs was created for each SSN, and their performance was evaluated by computing precision and recall rates using all 22,946 GH16 members as input (Fig. 3). It was observed that at a threshold of E = 10−60, the HMM library was able to retrieve all of the sequence assignments into the 26 subfamilies, with limited loss of precision at high E values, compared with SSN based on lower thresholds (Fig. 3). For SSNs induced by higher thresholds, GH16 was only broken down into an increasing number of subfamilies, primarily along taxonomic lines (Figs. S1 and S2). Such divisions are unlikely to be functionally significant and rather are likely only to reflect sequence drift caused by speciation. In this analysis, it is also helpful to keep the limit analysis in mind: division of GH16 into 22,946 individual subfamilies would result in recall and precision values of 100% at the subfamily level, yet it would provide no predictive power. Thus, although the data in Fig. 3 would suggest that the HMM library from the SSN at E = 10−60 may have the best performance, practically this represents little performance gain and might be unnecessarily stringent. Analysis of the taxonomic distribution and number of unclustered sequences between the SSN at E = 10−60 and the previous SSN at E = 10−55 suggest that the latter would be a more pragmatic choice, considering that the continuous growth of GH16 family would likely result in new sequences filling the gaps between subfamilies that are too finely divided. Hence, the SSN at E = 10−55 and the corresponding HMM library was chosen for the creation of the final subfamilies in GH16. In total, 23 subfamilies were defined using the SSN based on the E = 10−55 threshold (Fig. 4A), which collectively assigned 22,367 sequences to a subfamily (97.5% of all GH16 modules analyzed). Subfamily size ranges from 20 to 6,300 sequences. The taxonomical diversity within subfamilies mainly occurs at the phylum level, with only four subfamilies (GH16_3, GH16_10, GH16_14, and GH16_21) present in multiple kingdoms of life. The lowest taxonomic diversity was in an early diverging group of mycobacterial sequences (GH16_9), which robustly formed a distinct subfamily (Fig. 2). Notably, one of the earliest emerging features that distinguishes subfamilies is the presence or absence of the β-bulge sequence motif (EXDXXE versus EXDXE) in the active-site β-strand presenting the catalytic residues (Fig. 2), which is a key structural feature among GH16 members (30Michel G. Chantalat L. Duee E. Barbeyron T. Henrissat B. Kloareg B. Dideberg O. The κ-carrageenase of P. carrageenovora features a tunnel-shaped active site.Structure. 2001; 9 (11435116): 513-52510.1016/S0969-2126(01)00612-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A limitation of SSNs is the inability to establish phylogenetic relationships between subfamilies. To establish overall context and to validate further the subfamily classification of GH16, a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed from 30 randomly selected sequences from each subfamily defined by the SSN. The delineation of subfamilies from the SSN (Figure 2, Figure 4A) is identical to the monophyletic groups inferred from the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 5A). Importantly, all clades comprising individual subfamilies are supported by high bootstrap values. The SSN analysis delineated GH16 sequences into “characterized” subfamilies with one or more biochemically or structurally characterized members (denoted in the CAZy database (7Lombard V.

Here we combine genetic tagging of nuclei and ribosomes with RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing and Hi-C to investigate transcriptional and chromatin changes occurring in mouse hippocampal excitatory neurons at different time points after synchronous activation during seizure and sparse activation by novel context exploration. The transcriptional burst is associated with an increase in chromatin accessibility of activity-regulated genes and enhancers, de novo binding of activity-regulated transcription factors, augmented promoter–enhancer interactions and the formation of gene loops that bring together the transcription start site and transcription termination site of induced genes and may sustain the fast reloading of RNA polymerase complexes. Some chromatin occupancy changes and interactions, particularly those driven by AP1, remain long after neuronal activation and could underlie the changes in neuronal responsiveness and circuit connectivity observed in these neuroplasticity paradigms, perhaps thereby contributing to metaplasticity in the adult brain. Multi-omic analyses of transcriptional, chromatin occupancy and chromatin interaction dynamics in hippocampal excitatory neurons of adult mice upon activation by status epilepticus or novel context exploration reveals short- and long-lasting changes."

As such, there is strong interest in long-acting antiretroviral (ARV) agents that can be administered less frequently4. Herein, we report GS-CA1, a new archetypal small-molecule HIV capsid inhibitor with exceptional potency against HIV-2 and all major HIV-1 types, including viral variants resistant to the ARVs currently in clinical use. Mechanism-of-action studies indicate that GS-CA1 binds directly to the HIV-1 capsid and interferes with capsid-mediated nuclear import of viral DNA, HIV particle production and ordered capsid assembly. GS-CA1 selects in vitro for unfit GS-CA1-resistant capsid variants that remain fully susceptible to other classes of ARVs. Its high metabolic stability and low solubility enabled sustained drug release in mice following a single subcutaneous dosing. GS-CA1 showed high antiviral efficacy as a long-acting injectable monotherapy in a humanized mouse model of HIV-1 infection, outperforming long-acting rilpivirine. Collectively, these results demonstrate the potential of ultrapotent capsid inhibitors as new long-acting agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. A new compound that inhibits HIV capsid assembly and nuclear transport functions offers potential as a long-acting antiretroviral."

https://openalex.org/W2973026428,"Cytoplasmic dynein is an ATP-driven motor that transports intracellular cargos along microtubules. Dynein adopts an inactive conformation when not attached to a cargo, and motility is activated when dynein assembles with dynactin and a cargo adaptor. It was unclear how active dynein-dynactin complexes step along microtubules and transport cargos under tension. Using single-molecule imaging, we showed that dynein-dynactin advances by taking 8 to 32-nm steps toward the microtubule minus end with frequent sideways and backward steps. Multiple dyneins collectively bear a large amount of tension because the backward stepping rate of dynein is insensitive to load. Recruitment of two dyneins to dynactin increases the force generation and the likelihood of winning against kinesin in a tug-of-war but does not directly affect velocity. Instead, velocity is determined by cargo adaptors and tail-tail interactions between two closely packed dyneins. Our results show that cargo adaptors modulate dynein motility and force generation for a wide range of cellular functions."

Escherichia coli causes more bacteraemia episodes in England than any other bacterial species. This study aimed to estimate the burden of E. coli bacteraemia and associated antibiotic resistance in the secondary care setting. Materials and methods This was a retrospective cohort study, with E. coli bacteraemia as the main exposure of interest. Adult hospital in-patients, admitted to acute NHS hospitals between July 2011 and June 2012 were included. English national surveillance and administrative datasets were utilised. Cox proportional hazard, subdistribution hazard and multistate models were constructed to estimate rate of discharge, rate of in-hospital death and excess length of stay, with a unit bed day cost applied to the latter to estimate cost burden from the healthcare system perspective. Results 14,042 E. coli bacteraemia and 8,919,284 non-infected inpatient observations were included. E. coli bacteraemia was associated with an increased rate of in-hospital death across all models, with an adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio of 5.88 (95% CI: 5.62–6.15). Resistance was not found to be associated with in-hospital mortality once adjusting for patient and hospital covariates. However, resistance was found to be associated with an increased excess length of stay. This was especially true for third generation cephalosporin (1.58 days excess length of stay, 95% CI: 0.84–2.31) and piperacillin/tazobactam resistance (1.23 days (95% CI: 0.50–1.95)). The annual cost of E. coli bacteraemia was estimated to be £14,346,400 (2012 £), with third-generation cephalosporin resistance associated with excess costs per infection of £420 (95% CI: 220–630). Conclusions E. coli bacteraemia places a statistically significant burden on patient health and the hospital sector in England. Resistance to front-line antibiotics increases length of stay; increasing the cost burden of such infections in the secondary care setting."

Our system translates drug inputs into diverse outputs using a suite of engineered reader proteins to provide variable dimerization states of the receiver protein. We show that our single receiver protein architecture can be used to program a variety of cellular responses, including graded and proportional dual-output control of transcription and mammalian cell signaling. We apply our tools to titrate the competing activities of the Rac and Rho GTPases to control cell morphology.

To understand the basis of the ADA response and the mechanism of ADA-mediated neutralization, we performed an in-depth analysis of the B and T cell responses in two patients. By characterizing a large panel of NZM-specific monoclonal antibodies, we found that, in both patients, the response was polyclonal and targeted different epitopes of the NZM idiotype. The neutralizing activity was acquired through somatic mutations and correlated with a slow dissociation rate, a finding that was supported by structural data. Interestingly, in both patients, the analysis of the CD4+ T cell response, combined with mass spectrometry-based peptidomics, revealed a single immunodominant T cell epitope spanning the FR2-CDR2 region of the NZM light chain. Moreover, a CDR2-modified version of NZM was not recognized by T cells, while retaining binding to α4 integrins. Collectively, our integrated analysis identifies the basis of T-B collaboration that leads to ADA-mediated therapeutic resistance and delineates an approach to design novel deimmunized antibodies for autoimmune disease and cancer treatment. An analysis of T cell specificities sufficient to sustain a neutralizing anti-drug antibody response offers a potential approach for enhancing the clinical efficacy of a therapeutic humanized antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2972451306,"Cancer cells are known to adopt aerobic glycolysis in order to fuel tumor growth, but the molecular basis of this metabolic shift remains largely undefined. O-GlcNAcase (OGA) is an enzyme harboring O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) hydrolase and cryptic lysine acetyltransferase activities. Here, we report that OGA is upregulated in a wide range of human cancers and drives aerobic glycolysis and tumor growth by inhibiting pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). PKM2 is dynamically O-GlcNAcylated in response to changes in glucose availability. Under high glucose conditions, PKM2 is a target of OGA-associated acetyltransferase activity, which facilitates O-GlcNAcylation of PKM2 by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). O-GlcNAcylation inhibits PKM2 catalytic activity and thereby promotes aerobic glycolysis and tumor growth. These studies define a causative role for OGA in tumor progression and reveal PKM2 O-GlcNAcylation as a metabolic rheostat that mediates exquisite control of aerobic glycolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2972686779,"Unsustainable wildlife trade is a pervasive issue affecting wildlife globally. To address this issue, a plethora of demand reduction efforts have been carried out. These necessitate consumer research which provides crucial knowledge for designing and evaluating targeted interventions. We implemented a rigorous consumer survey on saiga (Saiga tatarica) horn use in Singapore, where usage is legal and widely sold. Saiga are Critically Endangered antelopes from Central Asia with horns (often marketed as ling yang) used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Few past studies have assessed saiga horn consumers. This work is the most extensive consumer research to date specifically characterising saiga horn consumers and usage. We conducted 2294 in-person surveys on saiga horn use with Chinese Singaporeans, employing neutral questioning approaches. We found 19% of individuals reported saiga horn as a product they choose most often for themselves and/or others when treating fever and/or heatiness (a TCM state of illness), indicating a minimum estimate of high-frequency usage, not including possible low-frequency users. Overall saiga users were most characterised as middle-aged Buddhists and Taoists. However, saiga users were found in a range of demographic groups. Women preferred saiga shavings (the more traditional form), while men preferred saiga cooling water (the more modern form). About 53% of individuals who used saiga horn themselves also bought it for someone else. Buyers for others were most likely to be female middle-aged Buddhists or Taoists. Key motivating reasons for usage were “it works” and “someone recommended it to me.” The top two reported recommenders were family and TCM shopkeepers. Saiga users were more likely than non-saiga users to perceive saiga as a common species in the wild. This research holds significance for interventions targeting saiga horn consumption within Singapore and throughout Asia, by identifying potential target audiences, product types, non-desirable alternatives, and motivations for use."

Of those participants, 45.5% reported suicidal ideation on the day of the interview (acute suicidal ideation). Qualitative text analysis (software ATLAS.ti 7) was used to investigate experiences with expressions of active suicidal thoughts on Instagram. Quantitative text analysis of language use in the interviews and directly on Instagram (in picture captions) was performed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software. Language markers in the interviews and in picture captions, as well as activity on Instagram were added to regression analyses, in order to investigate predictors for current suicidal ideation.Most participants (80%) had come across expressions of active suicidal thoughts on Instagram and 25% had expressed active suicidal thoughts themselves. Participants with acute suicidal ideation used significantly more negative emotion words (Cohen's d = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.088-1.232) and words expressing overall affect (Cohen's d = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.001-1.138) in interviews. However, activity and language use on Instagram did not predict acute suicidality.While participants differed with regard to their use of language in interviews, differences in activity and language use on Instagram were not associated with acute suicidality. Other mechanisms of machine learning, like identifying picture content, might be more valuable."

Despite the substantial public health implications, markers of diabetes progression with abdominal obesity are still needed to facilitate early detection and treatment. In this study, we performed a proteomic approach to identify differential target proteins underlying diabetes progression in patients with abdominal obesity. Proteomic differences were investigated in the serum of controls and patients with prediabetes or diabetes with or without abdominal obesity by 2-DE combined with MALDI-TOF-MS. Proteomics data were validated by western blot analyses and major protein-protein interactions were assessed using a network analysis with String database. Among 245 matched protein spots, 36 exhibited marked differences in normal patients with abdominal obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes compared to levels in normal patients without abdominal obesity. Seven (Alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, Alpha-1-antitrypsin, Apolipoprotein A-I, haptoglobin, retinol-binding protein 4, transthyretin, and zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein) of these spots exhibited significant differences between normal and prediabetes/diabetes patients. After a network analysis, functional annotation using Gene Ontology indicated that most of the identified proteins were involved in lipid transport, lipid localization, and the regulation of serum lipoprotein particle levels. Our results indicated that variation in the levels of these identified protein biomarkers has been reported in normal, prediabetes and diabetic Assessment of the levels of these biomarkers may contribute to the development of biomarkers for not only early diagnosis but also in prognosis of diabetes mellitus type 2."
https://openalex.org/W2973044890,"Seed germination traits are key drivers of population dynamics, yet they are under-represented in community ecology studies, which have predominately focussed on adult plant and seed morphological traits. We studied the seed traits and germination strategy of eight woody plant species to investigate regeneration strategies in the arid zone of eastern Australia. To cope with stochastic and minimal rainfall, we predict that arid seeds will either have rapid germination across a wide range of temperatures, improved germination under cooler temperatures, or dormancy and/or longevity traits to delay or stagger germination across time. To understand how temperature affects germination responses, seeds of eight keystone arid species were germinated under laboratory conditions, and under three diurnal temperatures (30/20°C, 25/15°C and 17/7°C) for 30 days. We also tested for decline in seed viability across 24 months in a dry-aging treatment (~20°C). Six of the eight arid species studied had non-dormant, rapidly germinating seeds, and only two species had physiological dormancy traits. Seed longevity differed widely between species, from one recalcitrant species surviving only months in aging (P50 = <3 months) and one serotinous species surviving for many years (P50 = 84 months). Our results highlight the importance of understanding the reproductive strategies of plant species in arid environments. Rapid germination, the dominant seed trait of species included in this study, allows arid species to capitalise on sporadic rainfall. However, some species also exhibit dormancy and delayed germination; this an alternative strategy which spreads the risk of germination failure over time."
https://openalex.org/W2973180611,"Abstract Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most lethal urological tumors. Using sunitinib to improve the survival has become the first-line therapy for metastatic RCC patients. However, the occurrence of sunitinib resistance in the clinical application has curtailed its efficacy. Here we found TR4 nuclear receptor might alter the sunitinib resistance to RCC via altering the TR4/lncTASR/AXL signaling. Mechanism dissection revealed that TR4 could modulate lncTASR (ENST00000600671.1) expression via transcriptional regulation, which might then increase AXL protein expression via enhancing the stability of AXL mRNA to increase the sunitinib resistance in RCC. Human clinical surveys also linked the expression of TR4, lncTASR, and AXL to the RCC survival, and results from multiple RCC cell lines revealed that targeting this newly identified TR4-mediated signaling with small molecules, including tretinoin, metformin, or TR4-shRNAs, all led to increase the sunitinib sensitivity to better suppress the RCC progression, and our preclinical study using the in vivo mouse model further proved tretinoin had a better synergistic effect to increase sunitinib sensitivity to suppress RCC progression. Future successful clinical trials may help in the development of a novel therapy to better suppress the RCC progression."

Objectives: The main purpose was to determine whether asymmetry between the preferred and non-preferred lower limb is present in the lower limb tendon structure, muscle architecture and stiffness values of professional badminton players.Sixteen male professional badminton players (age = 24.1 ± 6.7 years; body height = 177.90 ± 7.53 cm) participated in this study. The muscle architecture of the vastus lateralis (VL), medial gastrocnemius (MG) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) and the structure of patellar and Achilles tendons were measured in the dominant and non-dominant lower limb with ultrasonography. Stiffness was also measured at the same points with a hand-held MyotonPro. Significant differences between the dominant and non-dominant lower limb were determined using Student's t test for related samples.Bilateral differences were observed for thickness, width and cross-sectional area (CSA) in both tendons showing higher values for the dominant side: patellar tendon CSA (2.02 ± 0.64 vs. 1.51 ± 0.42 cm2; p < 0.05) and Achilles tendon CSA (1.12 ± 0.18 vs. 0.92 ± 0.28 cm2; p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in muscle architecture and myotonic variables between the dominant and non-dominant lower limb.The prolonged practice of badminton caused asymmetries in the CSA, width and thickness of the patellar and Achilles tendon between the dominant and non-dominant lower limbs. No bilateral differences were found in the muscle architecture of VL, MG and LG or in the stiffness of any muscle or tendon analyzed."
https://openalex.org/W2972772084,"The development of effective malaria vaccines remains a global health priority. Currently, the most advanced vaccine, known as RTS,S, has only shown modest efficacy in clinical trials. Thus, the development of more efficacious vaccines by improving the formulation of RTS,S for increased efficacy or to interrupt malaria transmission are urgently needed. The RTS,S vaccine is based on the presentation of a fragment of the sporozoite antigen on the surface of virus-like particles (VLPs) based on human hepatitis B virus (HBV). In this study, we have developed and evaluated a novel VLP platform based on duck HBV (known as Metavax) for malaria vaccine development. This platform can incorporate large and complex proteins into VLPs and is produced in a Hansenula cell line compatible with cGMP vaccine production. Here, we have established the expression of leading P. falciparum malaria vaccine candidates as VLPs. This includes Pfs230 and Pfs25, which are candidate transmission-blocking vaccine antigens. We demonstrated that the VLPs effectively induce antibodies to malaria vaccine candidates with minimal induction of antibodies to the duck-HBV scaffold antigen. Antibodies to Pfs230 also recognised native protein on the surface of gametocytes, and antibodies to both Pfs230 and Pfs25 demonstrated transmission-reducing activity in standard membrane feeding assays. These results establish the potential utility of this VLP platform for malaria vaccines, which may be suitable for the development of multi-component vaccines that achieve high vaccine efficacy and transmission-blocking immunity."

Here we show that unassembled monomers of the small multidrug resistance (SMR) family exist in a dynamic equilibrium where the N-terminal transmembrane helix flips in and out of the membrane, with rates that depend on dimerization and the polypeptide sequence. Thus, membrane topology can display rapid dynamics in vivo and can be regulated by post-translational assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2972717396,"Conservation planning relies on integrating existing knowledge, social-environmental contexts, and potential threats to identify gaps and opportunities for action. Here we present a case study on how priority areas for conservation can be determined using existing information on biodiversity occurrence and threats. Specifically, our goals are: (1) to model the ecological niche of twelve endemic snake species in the Dry Chaco Forest, (2) to quantify the impact of the deforestation rates on their distributions, (3) to propose high priority areas for conservation in order to improve the actual protected area system, and (4) to evaluate the influence of the human footprint on the optimization of selected priority areas. Our results demonstrate that Argentinian Dry Chaco represent, on average, ~74% of the distribution of endemic snake species and deforestation has reduced suitable areas of all snake species in the region. Further, the current protected areas are likely insufficient to conserve these species as only very low percentages (3.27%) of snakes’ ranges occur within existing protected areas. Our models identified high priority areas in the north of the Chaco forest where continuous, well-conserved forest still exists. These high priority areas include transition zones within the foothill forest and areas that could connect patches of forest between the western and eastern Chaco forest. Our findings identify spatial priorities that minimize conflicts with human activities, a key issue for this biodiversity hotspot area. We argue that consultation with stakeholders and decision-makers are urgently needed in order to take concrete actions to protect the habitat, or we risk losing the best conservation opportunities to protect endemic snakes that inhabit the Argentinian Dry Chaco."

Hsp90 activity is driven by ATP, which binds to the N-terminal domain and induces large conformational changes that are required for client maturation. Inhibitors targeting the ATP-binding pocket of the N-terminal domain have anticancer effects, but most bind with similar affinity to cytosolic Hsp90α and Hsp90β, endoplasmic reticulum Grp94, and mitochondrial Trap1, the four cellular hsp90 paralogs. Paralog-specific inhibitors may lead to drugs with fewer side effects. The ATP-binding pockets of the four paralogs are flanked by three side pockets, termed sites 1, 2, and 3, which differ between the paralogs in their accessibility to inhibitors. Previous insights into the principles governing access to sites 1 and 2 have resulted in development of paralog-selective inhibitors targeting these sites, but the rules for selective targeting of site 3 are less clear. Earlier studies identified 5′N-ethylcarboxamido adenosine (NECA) as a Grp94-selective ligand. Here we use NECA and its derivatives to probe the properties of site 3. We found that derivatives that lengthen the 5′ moiety of NECA improve selectivity for Grp94 over Hsp90α. Crystal structures reveal that the derivatives extend further into site 3 of Grp94 compared with their parent compound and that selectivity is due to paralog-specific differences in ligand pose and ligand-induced conformational strain in the protein.

In such circumstances, we speak of the possible effect of ethanol upon trauma outcomes. The present research aimed to assess the state of sobriety fatal pedestrian victims and the correlation between the level of sobriety and the severity of injuries.The data was obtained from the Warsaw Medical University's Department of Forensic Medicine. The analysis covered the data for the period of 2009-2013; it encompassed 158 fatal pedestrian victims hit by passenger cars. The appropriate methods of statistical analysis were applied.The majority of the fatal pedestrian victims were individuals under the influence of ethyl alcohol (72.15%). Significant correlations were observed between the concentration of ethyl alcohol and the victims' gender (p<0.0001) and age (p = 0.0026). The analysis showed that pedestrians under the influence of ethyl alcohol more often died on the scene (78.95%).Pedestrians under the influence of ethyl alcohol are a significant group of victims of traffic crashes. Ethyl alcohol is not an independent factor affecting the severity of injuries. A higher percentage of pedestrian victims die on the scene, especially in rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W2973106630,"Background Preclinical studies showed that antibiotic exposure played a role in clinical outcomes in patients with chemotherapy via modulation of microbiota. However, it remains unknown whether antibiotic exposure during the bevacizumab therapy affects the clinical outcomes in metastatic colorectal cancer(mCRC) patients. This study aimed to examine the association between the antibiotic medication and the clinical outcomes in mCRC patients with bevacizumab therapy. Methods This retrospective cohort analysis included 147 mCRC patients treated with bevacizumab. The hazard ratio of death was estimated using three Cox proportional hazards models with (1) never vs ever; (2) never vs 1–6 days and 7–40 days;(3) increase per day, and further tested using propensity score matching (PSM) and landmark analysis. A smooth curve technique was used to explore the shape of dose-response relationship. Results Compared with the non-antibiotic group, antibiotic exposure was inversely associated with the mortality in the antibiotic group after adjustment for demographic and other potential confounders (a history of medication: HR, 0.650(95%CI: 0.360 to 1.173); an increase per day: HR, 0.967(CI: 0.924 to 1.011); 1–6 days: HR, 0.859(CI: 0.441 to 1.674); 7–40 days: HR, 0.474(CI: 0.225 to 0.999); P for trend = 0.040). A test for the interaction between sex was statistically significant (p = 0.016). A similar result was found as measured by landmark and PSM analysis. Significant negative dose-response relationship was shown by smooth curve analysis in the male patients but not female after adjustment for confounders(p = 0.028). No association was found between the antibiotic medication and adverse events of bevacizumab. Conclusion Antibiotic exposure could be inversely associated with the mortality in mCRC patients treated with bevacizumab."

https://openalex.org/W2973089977,"The Nem1–Spo7 complex in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a protein phosphatase required for the nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane localization of Pah1, a phosphatidate phosphatase that produces diacylglycerol for triacylglycerol synthesis at the expense of phospholipid synthesis. In a previous study, we showed that the protein phosphatase is subject to phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA). Here, we demonstrate that Nem1–Spo7 is regulated through its phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC), which plays multiple roles, including the regulation of lipid synthesis and cell wall integrity. Phosphorylation analyses of Nem1–Spo7 and its synthetic peptides indicate that both subunits of the complex are bona fide PKC substrates. Site-directed mutagenesis of NEM1 and SPO7, coupled with phosphopeptide mapping and immunoblotting with a phosphoserine-specific PKC substrate antibody, revealed that Ser-201 in Nem1 and Ser-22/Ser-28 in Spo7 are major PKC target sites of phosphorylation. Activity analysis of mutant Nem1–Spo7 complexes indicates that the PKC phosphorylation of Nem1 exerts a stimulatory effect, but the phosphorylation of Spo7 has no effect. Lipid-labeling analysis of cells expressing the phosphorylation-deficient alleles of NEM1 and SPO7 indicates that the stimulation of the Nem1–Spo7 activity has the effect of increasing triacylglycerol synthesis. Prephosphorylation of Nem1–Spo7 by PKC inhibits the PKA phosphorylation of Nem1, whereas prephosphorylation of the phosphatase complex by PKA inhibits the PKC phosphorylation of Spo7.

In general, the phosphorylation on multiple sites, as mediated by several protein kinases (e.g. Cdc28-cyclin B, Pho85-Pho80, and PKA), attenuates enzyme function by sequestering Pah1 in the cytosol apart from its membrane-associated substrate PA and by inhibiting the PA phosphatase activity.

Histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution is a preservative used during organ transplantation. We tested the potential of HTK to protect neurons from severe hypoxia (SH) following CA. We isolated rat primary cortical neurons and induced SH with or without HTK. Changes in caspase-3, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase-4 (NOX4) expression were evaluated at different time points up to 72 h. Using a rat asphyxia model, we induced CA-mediated brain damage and then completed resuscitation. HTK or sterile saline was administered into the left carotid artery. Neurological deficit scoring and mortality were evaluated for 3 days. Then the rats were sacrificed for evaluation of NOX4 and H2O2 levels in blood and brain. In the in vitro study, HTK attenuated SH- and H2O2-mediated cytotoxicity in a volume- and time-dependent manner, associated with persistent HIF-1α expression and reductions in procaspase-3 activation and NOX4 expression. The inhibition of HIF-1α abrogated HTK's effect on NOX4. In the in vivo study, neurological scores were significantly improved by HTK. H2O2 level, NOX4 activity, and NOX4 gene expression were all decreased in the brain specimens of HTK-treated rats. Our results suggest that HTK acts as an effective neuroprotective solution by maintaining elevated HIF-1α level, which was associated with inhibited procaspase-3 activation and decreased NOX4 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2972527014,"Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the gene regulatory networks, or gene cascades, involved in cell fate determination and cell lineage segregation in Caenorhabditis elegans is a long-standing challenge. Although RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a promising technique to resolve these questions, the bioinformatics tools to identify associated gene cascades from RNA-Seq data remain inadequate. To overcome these limitations, we developed Gene Cascade Finder (GCF) as a novel tool for building gene cascades by comparison of mutant and wild-type RNA-Seq data along with integrated information of protein-protein interactions, expression timing, and domains. Application of GCF to RNA-Seq data confirmed that SPN-4 and MEX-3 regulate the canonical Wnt pathway during embryonic development. Moreover, lin-35, hsp-3, and gpa-12 were found to be involved in MEX-1-dependent neurogenesis, and MEX-3 was found to control the gene cascade promoting neurogenesis through lin-35 and apl-1. Thus, GCF could be a useful tool for building gene cascades from RNA-Seq data."

The sample for this study was 922 students, of both genres and in Compulsory Secondary Education, aged between 14 and 18 years. To carry out the study, the Student's Scale of Responsibility was used in the physical education assessment, the Basic Psychological Needs Measuring Scale, the Percentage Scale for Physical Education Causality and the Satisfaction Scale in Physical Education. The results of the structural equations model revealed a good adjustment to the data. This finding highlights the importance of giving responsibilities to the students in the evaluation process, in order to satisfy the psychological needs of the students and, therefore, self-determined motivation. Additionally, the satisfaction of psychological needs and self-determined motivation increase satisfaction towards physical education classes."

https://openalex.org/W2972788835,"HIV envelope protein (Env) is the sole target of broadly neutralizing antibodies (BNAbs) that are capable of neutralizing diverse strains of HIV. While BNAbs develop spontaneously in a subset of HIV-infected patients, efforts to design an envelope protein-based immunogen to elicit broadly neutralizing antibody responses have so far been unsuccessful. It is hypothesized that a primary barrier to eliciting BNAbs is the fact that HIV envelope proteins bind poorly to the germline-encoded unmutated common ancestor (UCA) precursors to BNAbs. To identify variant forms of Env with increased affinities for the UCA forms of BNAbs 4E10 and 10E8, which target the Membrane Proximal External Region (MPER) of Env, libraries of randomly mutated Env variants were expressed in a yeast surface display system and screened using fluorescence activated cell sorting for cells displaying variants with enhanced abilities to bind the UCA antibodies. Based on analyses of individual clones obtained from the screen and on next-generation sequencing of sorted libraries, distinct but partially overlapping sets of amino acid substitutions conferring enhanced UCA antibody binding were identified. These were particularly enriched in substitutions of arginine for highly conserved tryptophan residues. The UCA-binding variants also generally exhibited enhanced binding to the mature forms of anti-MPER antibodies. Mapping of the identified substitutions into available structures of Env suggest that they may act by destabilizing both the initial pre-fusion conformation and the six-helix bundle involved in fusion of the viral and cell membranes, as well as providing new or expanded epitopes with increased accessibility for the UCA antibodies."
