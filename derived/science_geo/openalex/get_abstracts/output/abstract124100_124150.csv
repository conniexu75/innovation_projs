https://openalex.org/W1979995768,"Bcl-2 is an integral membrane protein located mainly on the outer membrane of mitochondria. Overexpression of Bcl-2 prevents cells from undergoing apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli. Cytosolic cytochrome c is necessary for the initiation of the apoptotic program, suggesting a possible connection between Bcl-2 and cytochrome c, which is normally located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Cells undergoing apoptosis were found to have an elevation of cytochrome c in the cytosol and a corresponding decrease in the mitochondria. Overexpression of Bcl-2 prevented the efflux of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and the initiation of apoptosis. Thus, one possible role of Bcl-2 in prevention of apoptosis is to block cytochrome c release from mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2130866079,"In a cell-free apoptosis system, mitochondria spontaneously released cytochrome c, which activated DEVD-specific caspases, leading to fodrin cleavage and apoptotic nuclear morphology. Bcl-2 acted in situ on mitochondria to prevent the release of cytochrome c and thus caspase activation. During apoptosis in intact cells, cytochrome c translocation was similarly blocked by Bcl-2 but not by a caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk. In vitro, exogenous cytochrome c bypassed the inhibitory effect of Bcl-2. Cytochrome c release was unaccompanied by changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Thus, Bcl-2 acts to inhibit cytochrome c translocation, thereby blocking caspase activation and the apoptotic process."

Direct measurements of force and fiber length in the lateral gastrocnemius muscle of running turkeys revealed that the stretch and recoil of tendon and muscle springs supply mechanical work while active muscle fibers produce high forces. During level running, the active muscle shortens little and performs little work but provides the force necessary to support body weight economically. Running economy is improved by muscles that act as active struts rather than working machines."
https://openalex.org/W2068240610,"Previous genetic studies of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans identified three important components of the cell death machinery. CED-3 and CED-4 function to kill cells, whereas CED-9 protects cells from death. Here CED-9 and its mammalian homolog Bcl-x L (a member of the Bcl-2 family of cell death regulators) were both found to interact with and inhibit the function of CED-4. In addition, analysis revealed that CED-4 can simultaneously interact with CED-3 and its mammalian counterparts interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE) and FLICE. Thus, CED-4 plays a central role in the cell death pathway, biochemically linking CED-9 and the Bcl-2 family to CED-3 and the ICE family of pro-apoptotic cysteine proteases."
https://openalex.org/W2004487226,"The Caenorhabditis elegans survival gene ced-9 regulates ced-4 activity and inhibits cell death, but the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Through a genetic screen for CED-4-binding proteins, CED-9 was identified as an interacting partner of CED-4. CED-9, but not loss-of-function mutants, associated specifically with CED-4 in yeast or mammalian cells. The CED-9 protein localized primarily to intracellular membranes and the perinuclear region, whereas CED-4 was distributed in the cytosol. Expression of CED-9, but not a mutant lacking the carboxy-terminal hydrophobic domain, targeted CED-4 from the cytosol to intracellular membranes in mammalian cells. Thus, the actions of CED-4 and CED-9 are directly linked, which could provide the basis for the regulation of programmed cell death in C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W1967883278,"To determine whether activation of the neutral sphingomyelinase pathway was responsible for the immediate (<30 min) negative inotropic effects of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), we examined sphingosine levels in diluent and TNF-α-stimulated cardiac myocytes. TNF-α stimulation of adult feline cardiac myocytes provoked a rapid (<15 min) increase in the hydrolysis of [14C]sphingomyelin in cell-free extracts, as well as an increase in ceramide mass, consistent with cytokine-induced activation of the neutral sphingomyelinase pathway. High performance liquid chromatographic analysis of lipid extracts from TNF-α-stimulated cardiac myocytes showed that TNF-α stimulation produced a rapid (<30 min) increase in free sphingosine levels. Moreover, exogenous D-sphingosine mimicked the effects of TNF-α on intracellular calcium homeostasis, as well as the negative inotropic effects of TNF-α in isolated contracting myocytes; time course studies showed that exogenous D-sphingosine produced abnormalities in cell shortening that were maximal at 5 min. Finally, blocking sphingosine production using an inhibitor of ceramidase, n-oleoylethanolamine, completely abrogated the negative inotropic effects of TNF-α in isolated contracting cardiac myocytes. Additional studies employing biologically active ceramide analogs and sphingosine 1-phosphate suggested that neither the immediate precursor of sphingosine nor the immediate metabolite of sphingosine, respectively, were likely to be responsible for the immediate negative inotropic effects of TNF-α. Thus, these studies suggest that sphingosine mediates the immediate negative inotropic effects of TNF-α in isolated cardiac myocytes. To determine whether activation of the neutral sphingomyelinase pathway was responsible for the immediate (<30 min) negative inotropic effects of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), we examined sphingosine levels in diluent and TNF-α-stimulated cardiac myocytes.

Med. 1990; 223: 236-241Google Scholar). The long-standing interest in defining the mechanisms responsible for the cardiodepressant effects of TNF-α has been intensified recently by experimental studies that have shown that TNF-α produces negative inotropic effects in the intact left ventricle (6Yokoyama T. Vaca L. Rossen R.D. Durante W. Hazarika P. Mann D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2303-2312Google Scholar, 7Natanson C. Eichenholz P.W. Danner R.L. Eichacker W. Hoffman D. Kuo S.M. Banks T.J. MacViottie T.J. Parrillo J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 823-832Google Scholar), in thin strips of myocardial tissue (8Finkel M.S. Oddis C.V. Jacob T.D. Watkins S.C. Hattler B.G. Simmons R.L. Science. 1992; 257: 387-389Google Scholar), and in isolated contracting cardiac myocytes (6Yokoyama T. Vaca L. Rossen R.D. Durante W. Hazarika P. Mann D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2303-2312Google Scholar). Although the exact cellular signaling pathways that are responsible for the negative inotropic effects of TNF-α are not known, a careful inspection of the literature suggests that TNF-α modulates myocardial function through at least two different pathways. tumor necrosis factor-α nitric oxide nitric oxide synthase TNF receptor n-oleoylethanolamine phosphatidylcholine-dependent phospholipase C protein kinase C high performance liquid chromatography phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate tetradecylamine. It is quite clear, for example, that TNF-α can produce immediate negative inotropic effects in myocardial tissue within 10-30 min (6Yokoyama T. Vaca L. Rossen R.D. Durante W. Hazarika P. Mann D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2303-2312Google Scholar, 8Finkel M.S. Oddis C.V. Jacob T.D. Watkins S.C. Hattler B.G. Simmons R.L. Science. 1992; 257: 387-389Google Scholar). Similarly, it is equally clear that TNF-α exerts delayed effects on myocardial function that appear to be related to uncoupling of the β-adrenergic receptor from cyclic AMP, rather than from a direct depression in basal myocardial contractility per se; moreover, these effects occur only after prolonged TNF-α exposure (24-72 h) (9Gulick T.S. Chung M.K. Pieper S.J. Lange L.G. Schreiner G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6753-6757Google Scholar, 10Chung M.K. Gulick T.S. Rotondo R.E. Schreiner G.F. Lange L.G. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 753-763Google Scholar). Given the recognition that TNF-α increases nitric oxide (NO) levels in myocardial tissue through increased transcription of the inducible Ca2+-independent form of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) (11Schulz R. Nava E. Moncada S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 105: 575-580Google Scholar, 12De Belder A.J. Radomski M.W. Why H.J.F. Richardson P.J. Bucknall C.A. Salas E. Martin J.F. Moncada S. Lancet. 1993; 341: 84-86Google Scholar), given that NO directly mediates myocardial depression (13Balligand J.L. Kelly R.A. Marsden P.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 347-351Google Scholar, 14Balligand J.L. Ungureanu D. Kelly R.A. Kobzik L. Pimental D. Michel T. Smith T.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2314-2319Google Scholar), and given that NO is likely responsible for the uncoupling of the β-adrenergic receptor following TNF-α stimulation (15Ungunreanu-Longrois D. Balligand J.L. Simmons W.W. Okada I. Kobzik L. Lowenstein C.J. Kunkel S.L. Michel T. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 494-502Google Scholar), the logical assumption has been that NO mediates the full spectrum of cytokine-induced cardiodepressant effects. However, no previous report to date has provided direct evidence that shows that TNF-α stimulates NO production in cardiac myocytes with a time course that is rapid enough to explain the immediate negative inotropic effects of TNF-α (6Yokoyama T. Vaca L. Rossen R.D. Durante W. Hazarika P. Mann D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2303-2312Google Scholar). As a case in point, a recent study in which thin strips of myocardial tissue from Syrian hamsters were treated with TNF-α provided indirect evidence that suggested that the immediate (<5 min) negative inotropic effects “appear(ed) to result from enhanced activity of a constitutive (Ca2+-dependent) NO synthase enzyme in the myocardium.” (8Finkel M.S. Oddis C.V. Jacob T.D. Watkins S.C. Hattler B.G. Simmons R.L. Science. 1992; 257: 387-389Google Scholar) Nonetheless, although combinations of cytokines may increase Ca2+-dependent NOS activity indirectly over 24 h by increasing the synthesis of NOS cofactors (16Rosenkranz-Weiss P. Sessa W.C. Milstien S. Kaufman S. Watson C.A. Pober J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 223: 2236-2243Google Scholar), the demonstration of a rapid increase in Ca2+-dependent NOS activity by TNF-α, or by any other cytokine, has not been observed thus far (17Roberts A.B. Vodovotz Y. Roche N.S. Sporn M.B. Nathan C.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1921-1930Google Scholar). Moreover, we have found that the immediate negative inotropic effects of TNF-α were not abrogated by NOS inhibition (6Yokoyama T. Vaca L. Rossen R.D. Durante W. Hazarika P. Mann D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2303-2312Google Scholar), suggesting that TNF-α may produce myocardial depression through a NOS-independent pathway. During the course of previous studies we observed that TNF-α-induced activation of the type 1 TNF receptor (TNFR1) resulted in reversible negative inotropic effects in isolated cardiac myocytes as a direct result of alterations in intracellular calcium homeostasis (6Yokoyama T. Vaca L. Rossen R.D. Durante W. Hazarika P. Mann D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2303-2312Google Scholar, 18Torre-Amione G. Kapadia S. Lee J. Bies R.D. Lebovitz R. Mann D.L. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1487-1493Google Scholar). Insofar as concentrations of TNF-α that produced negative inotropic effects did not produce discernible changes in the voltage-sensitive inward calcium current, we suggested that the TNF-α-induced alterations in intracellular calcium homeostasis were secondary to alterations in sarcoplasmic reticular handling of calcium (6Yokoyama T. Vaca L. Rossen R.D. Durante W. Hazarika P. Mann D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2303-2312Google Scholar). Encouraged by the observation that TNF-α-induced oligomerization of TNFR1 leads to the rapid degradation of sphingomyelin (19Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Kampen E. Himmler A. Machleidt T. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17997-18001Google Scholar) with the resultant generation of a sphingoid base termed sphingosine (20Kolesnick R.N. Prog. Lipid Res. 1991; 30: 1-38Google Scholar), as well as by the observation that sphingosine was not only present in cardiac and skeletal muscle (21Sabbadini R.A. Mcnutt W. Jenkins G. Betto R. Salviati G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 752-758Google Scholar), but was also capable of blocking calcium release from the ryanodine receptor (22Sabbadini R.A. Betto R. Teresi A. Fachechi-Cassano G. Salviati G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15475-15484Google Scholar, 23Dettbarn C.A. Betto R. Salviati G. Palade P. Jenkins G.M. Sabbadini R.A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1994; 26: 229-242Google Scholar), we investigated whether the immediate negative inotropic effects of TNF-α were mediated by sphingosine. In the present brief report we demonstrate that sphingosine is both necessary and sufficient to produce the negative inotropic effects of TNF-α in isolated cardiac myocytes, thus suggesting that TNF-α-induced activation of the neutral sphingomyelinase pathway is responsible for the immediate negative inotropic effects of this proinflammatory cytokine. Acidic (pH 5.0) and neutral (pH 7.5) sphingomyelinase activity were measured in adult feline cardiac myocytes according to the method described by Machleidt et al. (24Machleidt T. Wiegmann K. Henkel T. Schutze S. Baeuerle P. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13760-13765Google Scholar). Briefly, feline cardiac myocytes were isolated, and a 2-ml suspension of cells was plated at a final concentration of 5 × 104 cells·;ml−1 onto laminin-coated (20 μg·;ml−1) polystyrene Petri dishes as described previously (25Mann D.L. Kent R.L. Cooper G. Circ. Res. 1989; 64: 1079-1090Google Scholar, 26Mann D.L. Kent R.L. Parsons B. Cooper G. Circulation. 1992; 85: 790-804Google Scholar). On the 1st day in culture the M199 medium was changed, and the cells were treated for 0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min with diluent (endotoxin-free 0.1% human serum albumin) or with recombinant human TNF-α (200 units·;ml−1). The cells were then lysed, and the resultant cell supernatants were incubated at 37°C with 1 μl of [methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (25 μCi·;ml−1). The reaction was stopped after 2 h by the addition of chloroform:methanol (2:1). After thorough mixing by inversion and vortexing, ddH2O was added, and the two phases were separated by centrifugation. The upper aqueous phase containing [14C]phosphorylcholine was removed and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Final results were expressed as fold increase in [14C]phosphorylcholine levels relative to base-line levels. Ceramide mass was measured according to the method of Preiss et al. (27Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Google Scholar) Briefly, isolated cardiac myocytes were prepared as described above and stimulated for 30 min with diluent, TNF-α (200 units·;ml−1), either in the presence or absence of a specific inhibitor of ceramidase: n-oleoylethanolamine (NOE) (28Coroneous E. Martinez M. McKenna S. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23305-23309Google Scholar). The lipid fractions from cell extracts were extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:1 (v/v)), the samples vortexed, and then separated by centrifugation. The upper aqueous phase was aspirated and used for determination of the protein concentration, whereas the chloroform phase was dried in vacuo. The extracts were resuspended and incubated with Escherichia coli diacylglycerol and [γ-32P]ATP using a commercial diacylglycerol kinase assay system (Amersham Corp.). Ceramide 1-phosphate was then isolated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid (65:15:5 (v/v/v)) in the presence of a ceramide standard, which was run simultaneously along with the unknown samples. Authentic ceramide 1-phosphate was identified by autoradiography, and the spots corresponding to ceramide 1-phosphate were scraped from the plates and then counted in a scintillation counter. Final results were expressed as cpm/mg protein. Sphingosine levels in adult cardiac myocytes were determined according to the method of Merrill et al. (29Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Jamison W.C.L. Nimkar S. Liotta D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 373-381Google Scholar). Briefly, lipid extracts were obtained from freshly isolated cardiac myocytes by thoroughly mixing the cells with chloroform/methanol (1:2) for 5 min. In order to account for variability in the lipid extraction process, 0.6 nmol of tetradecylamine was added to the unknown samples as an internal standard (30Shayman J.A. Deshmukh G.D. Mahdiyoun S. Thomas T.P. Wu D. Barcelon F.S. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22968-22974Google Scholar). Equal volumes of chloroform and 1 M NaCl were then added, and the two phases were separated by centrifugation. The upper aqueous phase was discarded, and the chloroform phase was washed twice with 1 M NaCl and vacuum-dried for 30 min. The dried lipid extracts were then subjected to a mild alkaline hydrolysis by resuspending them in 0.1 M KOH in methanol for 1 h (37°C), in order to remove ester-containing glycerolipids. After cooling to room temperature the samples were re-extracted as described above, and the free long chain sphingoid bases recovered in the chloroform phase, washed 2 × with 1 M NaCl, and then vacuum-dried. Thereafter, samples were derivatized with o-phthaldialdehyde, exactly as described by Merrill and colleagues (29Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Jamison W.C.L. Nimkar S. Liotta D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 373-381Google Scholar). O-Phthaldialdehyde derivatives of the unknown samples were separated by reverse phase HPLC using an isocratic elution with methanol, 5 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) (90:10), employing a Beckman 112 solvent delivery module, a 250 × 4.6 mm C18 (5 μm) Brownlee column with a Dynamax C18 guard column; all samples were run at 1 ml/min. Fluorescent derivatives were detected using Waters 420-AC fluorescent detector with excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 455 nm, respectively. Under the above conditions, incorporated fluorescence is linearly related to sphingoid base levels between 2 to 400 pmol. To determine the absolute level of sphingosine in unknown samples, the amount of fluorescence was compared with a standard curve generated from known quantities of sphingoid base. To compare the level of sphingosine in diluent and TNF-α-stimulated samples, we expressed the amount of free sphingosine present in the unknown samples as the ratio of the area under the sphingosine peak to the area under the tetradecylamine peak. To determine whether stimulation with TNF-α would increase the level of free sphingosine in isolated adult cardiac myocytes, freshly isolated cells were treated for 30 min with TNF-α (20 and 200 units·;ml−1), as well as TNF-α mutants that bind selectively either to the type 1 (TNFR1) TNF receptor (corresponding mutant = TNFM1) or the type 2 (TNFR2) TNF receptor (corresponding mutant = TNFM2). Both the TNFM1 and TNFM2 mutants were the generous gifts of W. Lesslauer (F. Hoffman-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) (31Loetscher H. Stueber D. Banner D. Mackay F. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26350-26357Google Scholar). The specificity of the mutated TNF ligands for binding to feline TNFR1 and TNFR2 has been validated previously (18Torre-Amione G. Kapadia S. Lee J. Bies R.D. Lebovitz R. Mann D.L. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1487-1493Google Scholar). For these studies we used a single concentration of TNFM1(2 ng·;ml−1) and TNFM2 (2 ng·;ml−1), since this concentration is equivalent to the concentration of wild-type TNF-α (200 units·;ml−1) that produces well-defined negative inotropic effects in adult feline cardiac myocytes (6Yokoyama T. Vaca L. Rossen R.D. Durante W. Hazarika P. Mann D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2303-2312Google Scholar) Cell motion was characterized by video-edge detection at a stimulation frequency of 0.25 Hz, using experimental conditions identical to those we have described elsewhere (6Yokoyama T. Vaca L. Rossen R.D. Durante W. Hazarika P. Mann D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2303-2312Google Scholar, 32Kapadia S. Lee J.R. Torre-Amione G. Birdsall H.H. Ma T.S. Mann D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1042-1052Google Scholar). Four separate series of experiments were performed. First, to determine whether blocking the conversion of ceramide to sphingosine would abrogate the negative inotropic effects of TNF-α, freshly isolated feline cardiac myocytes were allowed to stabilize for 1 h and were then treated for 30 min at 37°C with 200 units·;ml−1 of TNF-α, either in the presence or absence of a specific inhibitor of ceramidase, n-oleoylethanolamine (NOE) (28Coroneous E. Martinez M. McKenna S. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23305-23309Google Scholar). In preliminary control experiments we determined that concentrations of NOE >10.0 μM completely inhibited cell motion; therefore, 1.0 μM NOE was chosen as the maximal concentration of NOE to inhibit ceramidase. As an additional control for the above experiments NOE-pretreated cells (1.0 μM) were stimulated with 200 units·;ml−1 of TNF-α and 1 μMD-sphingosine for 30 min. Second, to determine whether exogenous D-sphingosine would mimic the negative inotropic effects of TNF-α, cardiac myocytes were incubated for 30 min with a broad range of concentrations (0.1 nM to 10 μM) of D-sphingosine or a closely related sphingoid base, 10 μM dihydrosphingosine. To determine the time course for the effects of D-sphingosine (1 μM), cell shortening was examined at 5, 15, and 30 min. The reversibility of the effects of D-sphingosine (1 μM) was determined by treating the cells for 30 min and then washing the cells free from exogenous D-sphingosine; cell motion was examined 30 min after the D-sphingosine was removed from the cells. Given that sphingosine 1-phosphate, the phosphorylated metabolite of sphingosine, is thought to mediate many of the biological effects of D-sphingosine (33Desai N.N. Zhang H. Olivera A. Mattie M.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23122-23128Google Scholar), we performed parallel experiments to those described above for sphingosine, by incubating the cells for 30 min with 0.1-10 μM sphingosine 1-phosphate. To determine the time course for the effects of sphingosine 1-phosphate (1 μM), cell shortening was examined at 5, 15, 30, and 60 min after stimulation. Third, to determine whether exogenous ceramide would mimic the effects of TNF-α, the cells were treated for 30 min with two different ceramide analogs: C2-ceramide (N-acetyl-D-sphingosine) and C6-ceramide (N-hexanoyl-D-sphingosine). In preliminary control experiments we established that concentrations ≥100 μM C2-ceramide and ≥10 μM C6-ceramide were overtly toxic to the cells; therefore, we employed 10 μM C2-ceramide and 1 μM C6-ceramide for these studies. Fourth, to determine whether TNF-α-induced stimulation of the phosphatidylcholine-dependent phospholipase C pathway (PC-PLC), with resultant activation of protein kinase C (PKC), was responsible for the immediate negative inotropic effects of TNF-α, we pretreated the cells with D609 (60 min), an inhibitor of the PC-PLC pathway (34Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Google Scholar). In preliminary control experiments we determined that concentrations of ≤1 μM D609 did not depress cell motion significantly; therefore, we used 0.4 μM D609 to inhibit PC-PLC activity. Since the maximal concentration of D609 used may not have inhibited PC-PLC activity completely, we also pretreated the cells with 20 μM sangivamycin, which has been shown to significantly inhibit diacylglycerol-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) activity (35Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1682-1692Google Scholar); 20 μM sangivamycin did not significantly inhibit cell motion in preliminary control experiments. For the studies with D609 and sangivamycin, the cells were pretreated with inhibitor for 60 min and were then stimulated with TNF-α or diluent for an additional 30 min prior to assessing cell motion. In addition to these indirect studies, we performed direct measurements of PKC activity in TNF-α and sphingosine-stimulated cardiac myocytes. Evidence for cytokine-induced activation of PKC (translocation) was determined in freshly isolated myocytes stimulated for 1, 7.5, or 30 min either with 200 units·;ml−1 TNF-α using differential membrane centrifugation and immunoblot analysis, as described previously (36Ali S. Becker M.W. Davis M.G. Dorn II, G.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 836-837Google Scholar); cells stimulated with 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) served as the appropriate positive controls. Two separate primary antibodies were employed for immunoblotting; the first antibody was specific for PKCϵ, the major PKC isoform in myocytes, whereas the second antibody recognized PKCα, -β, -γ, and -δ. The relative amounts of protein kinase C in the membrane and cytosolic fractions were assessed by laser densitometry and expressed as a ratio of membrane-to-cytosolic PKC. Evidence for inhibition of PKC activity was sought by determining the incorporation of [32P]ATP into a PKC-specific pseudosubstrate peptide, as described previously (37Dorn G.W. Davis M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 263: C864-C872Google Scholar). Briefly, cardiac myocytes were homogenized and then centrifuged for 1 h at 1,000 × g; the resultant crude homogenate was then separated into cytosolic and membrane fractions by centrifugation at 70,000 × g. Insofar as preliminary studies showed that ≈75% of the PKC activity resided in the cytosolic fraction, this fraction was employed for all further studies. The PKC inhibitory activity of TNF-α (200 units·;ml−1) and sphingosine (0.1-10 μM) was compared with that of l00 nM staurosporine in assays wherein myocyte cytosolic extracts were stimulated with mixed micelles containing 0.3 mg/ml phosphatidyl-L-serine and 24 μg/ml PMA, in order to simulate PKC activity. Intracellular calcium transients were determined in isolated contracting cardiac myocytes using the fluorescent indicator fluo-3 AM (20 μM), exactly as we have described previously (6Yokoyama T. Vaca L. Rossen R.D. Durante W. Hazarika P. Mann D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2303-2312Google Scholar). A time-intensity curve for fluorescence brightness was determined for a single cardiac myocyte contraction by measuring the total fluorescence brightness over the surface area of individual cell; the final time-intensity curves were determined as the average values for 10 consecutive contraction sequences after cell shortening had stabilized. For the purpose of comparison between D-sphingosine (1 μM) and diluent-treated cells, peak levels of intracellular fluorescence brightness were compared. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, with post hoc testing where appropriate (Dunnett's), or by non-paired t tests. TNF-α-induced oligomerization of TNFR1 has been shown to activate membrane-bound neutral sphingomyelinase, with the resultant generation of ceramide, which can then be deacylated to sphingosine by the enzyme ceramidase (20Kolesnick R.N. Prog. Lipid Res. 1991; 30: 1-38Google Scholar). Three series of experiments were performed to determine whether TNF-α activated this pathway in the adult mammalian cardiac myocyte. Table I shows that TNF-α stimulation resulted in time-dependent increase in neutral sphingomyelinase activation in adult cardiac myocytes. As shown, [14C]phosphorylcholine levels were significantly different from control values by 15 min (p < 0.05) and were ≈2-fold greater than control values 60 min following stimulation. TNF-α stimulation also activated the acidic sphingomyelinase pathway, consistent with reports from other laboratories (34Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Google Scholar). Next we measured ceramide mass in diluent and TNF-α-stimulated cardiac myocytes (n = 4 dishes per group). When compared with diluent-treated controls, TNF-α stimulation provoked a significant (p < 0.05) 1.8-fold increase in ceramide mass (10,458 ± 571 versus 18,955 ± 831 cpm/μg protein). In contrast, stimulating the cells with diluent in the presence of NOE resulted in ≈8-fold increase in ceramide mass (82,998 ± 5,140 cpm/μg protein), whereas stimulating the cells with TNF-α in the presence of NOE resulted in ≈12-fold increase in ceramide mass (121,155 ± 24,086 cpm/μg protein) Thus, these studies are consistent with the notion that NOE acts, at least in part, by inhibiting ceramidase (28Coroneous E. Martinez M. McKenna S. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23305-23309Google Scholar). Finally, to determine whether TNF-α activation would stimulate increased levels of free sphingosine in cardiac myocytes, freshly isolated cells were stimulated with TNF-α for 30 min before lipid extraction. Fig. 1 shows the elution profiles for the o-phthaldialdehyde derivatives of the lipid extracts from cardiac myocytes stimulated with diluent (Fig. 1A) and 200 units·;ml−1 of TNF-α (Fig. 1B). As shown, a major sphingosine peak was resolved at 14 min in the diluent and TNF-α-treated myocytes, consistent with previous studies that have demonstrated constitutive levels of sphingosine in cardiac and skeletal muscle (21Sabbadini R.A. Mcnutt W. Jenkins G. Betto R. Salviati G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 752-758Google Scholar). The identity of the sphingosine peak was confirmed by its comigration on HPLC with authentic sphingosine standards, as well as by the observation that closely related exogenous lipids (dihydrosphingosine and psychosine) had different elution times when added to the unknown samples. In preliminary control experiments we established that the amount of free sphingosine present in isolated cardiac myocytes was ≈23 pmol/106 cells, consistent with reports in cardiac and skeletal muscle, as well as other cell types (29Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Jamison W.C.L. Nimkar S. Liotta D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 373-381Google Scholar, 38Webster R.J. Sabbadini R.A. Dettbarn C.A. Paolini P.J. J. Mol. Cell.

As shown in Fig. 1 the elution profile for tetradecylamine, which was added as an internal standard, had a retention time of 30 min. In the representative example depicted in Fig. 1B, TNF-α stimulation led to a 1.4-fold increase in the sphingosine/TDA ratio when compared with values obtained in diluent-treated cardiac myocytes.Table I.TNF-α induced activation of the neutral and acidic sphingomyelinase pathwaysNeutral sphingomyelinaseAcidic sphingomyelinase0 min1.00 ± 0.031.00 ± 0.045 min1.27 ± 0.091.07 ± 0.0215 min1.91 ± 0.3ap < 0.05 compared with control values (Dunnett's test).1.27 ± 0.03ap < 0.05 compared with control values (Dunnett's test).30 min2.03 ± 0."
https://openalex.org/W2041586068,"The mechanism by which platelets regulate the function of integrin αIIbβ3 (or GPIIb/IIIa), the platelet fibrinogen receptor, is unknown but may involve the binding of proteins or other factors to integrin cytoplasmic domains. To identify candidate cytoplasmic domain binding proteins, we screened a human fetal liver cDNA library in the yeast two-hybrid system, using the αIIb cytoplasmic domain as “bait,” and isolated a novel 855-base pair clone. The open reading frame encodes a novel 191-amino acid polypeptide (termed CIB for calcium- and integrin-binding protein) that appears to be specific for the cytoplasmic domain of αIIb, since it does not interact with the αv, α2, α5, β1, or β3 integrin cytoplasmic domains in the yeast two-hybrid system. This protein has sequence homology to two known Ca2+-binding regulatory proteins, calcineurin B (58% similarity) and calmodulin (56% similarity), and has two EF-hand motifs corresponding to the two C-terminal Ca2+ binding domains of these proteins. Moreover, recombinant CIB specifically binds 45Ca2+ in blot overlay assays. Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, we detected CIB mRNA and protein (∼25 kDa), respectively, in human platelets. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay performed using either immobilized recombinant CIB or monoclonal antibody-captured αIIbβ3 indicates a specific interaction between CIB and intact αIIbβ3. These results suggest that CIB is a candidate regulatory molecule for integrin αIIbβ3. The mechanism by which platelets regulate the function of integrin αIIbβ3 (or GPIIb/IIIa), the platelet fibrinogen receptor, is unknown but may involve the binding of proteins or other factors to integrin cytoplasmic domains.

An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay performed using either immobilized recombinant CIB or monoclonal antibody-captured αIIbβ3 indicates a specific interaction between CIB and intact αIIbβ3. These results suggest that CIB is a candidate regulatory molecule for integrin αIIbβ3. Integrin-mediated adherence of cells to extracellular matrix is important for a variety of physiological processes, such as hemostasis, angiogenesis, and cell differentiation (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Google Scholar). Integrin αIIbβ3, the platelet fibrinogen receptor, is specific to the megakaryocytic lineage. In unstimulated platelets the majority of αIIbβ3 is in an inactive conformation or low affinity state and is unable to bind soluble ligands. Platelet agonists through their respective receptors transduce a cascade of intracellular signals ultimately converting αIIbβ3 to an active, high affinity state, capable of binding soluble ligands. This activation process is termed inside-out signaling (2Smyth S.S. Joneckis C.C. Parise L.V. Blood. 1993; 81: 2827-2843Google Scholar). The role of the αIIb and β3 cytoplasmic domains in inside-out signaling has been indicated using mutants of αIIbβ3 transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells (3Ylanne J. Chen Y. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Takada Y. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 223-233Google Scholar). When wild type αIIbβ3 is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, it is unable to bind soluble fibrinogen. However, when an αIIbβ3 construct lacking the αIIb cytoplasmic domain is expressed, the integrin becomes constitutively active and binds soluble fibrinogen with high affinity (4O'Toole T.E. Mandelman D. Forsyth J. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Science. 1991; 254: 854-857Google Scholar). Moreover, deletion of the conserved GFFKR motif of the αIIb cytoplasmic domain makes the integrin constitutively active. These data suggest that the αIIb cytoplasmic domain helps to maintain a default low affinity state of αIIbβ3. Interestingly, a naturally occurring point mutation, Ser-752 → Pro in the β3 cytoplasmic domain, disrupts inside-out signaling (5Chen Y.P. Djaffar I. Pidard D. Steiner B. Cieutat A.M. Caen J.P. Rosa J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10169-10173Google Scholar), indicating that the β3 cytoplasmic domain is involved in inducing or maintaining the high affinity state. Thus, inside-out signaling probably requires both integrin cytoplasmic domains. It seems likely that during platelet activation, the conformations of the αIIb and β3 cytoplasmic domains are altered as a result of an interaction with cytoplasmic factors. It is therefore of interest to identify candidate cytoplasmic factors and determine their roles in integrin affinity modulation. In this regard, Shattil et al. (6Shattil S.J. O'Toole T. Eigenthaler M. Thon V. Williams M. Babior B.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 807-816Google Scholar), using the yeast two-hybrid system, recently identified a novel protein termed β3-endonexin, which interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of the β3 integrin. Fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 causes receptor clustering, which induces outside-in signaling, leading to cytoskeletal rearrangements and localization of the integrin in focal contacts. The mechanism of integrin-mediated signaling and localization is unclear but is believed to involve the interaction of integrin cytoplasmic domains with specific proteins. The β cytoplasmic domain is required for integrin localization in focal contacts, while the α cytoplasmic domain is required for selective association of αIIbβ3 with focal contacts (3Ylanne J. Chen Y. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Takada Y. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 223-233Google Scholar). The αIIb and/or β3 cytoplasmic domains have been shown to interact with talin (7Knezevic I. Leisner T.M. Lam S.C.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16416-16421Google Scholar), Shc, and Grb2, proteins potentially involved in these processes (8Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Google Scholar). We have identified a novel Ca2+-binding protein that interacts specifically with the integrin αIIb subunit cytoplasmic domain. This protein is expressed in platelets and binds to heterodimeric integrin αIIbβ3. It has significant homology to two well known Ca2+-binding proteins, calmodulin and calcineurin B, which are involved in regulating the activity of a variety of proteins. Thus, our studies identify a novel candidate intracellular regulatory molecule for platelet integrin αIIbβ3. The cytoplasmic domains of integrin subunits were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionRT-PCRreverse transcriptase-PCRCIBcalcium- and integrin-binding proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseHELhuman erythroleukemiamAbmonoclonal antibodyPBSTphosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPVDFpolyvinylidene difluoridebpbase pair(s)kbkilobase(s)BSAbovine serum albumin. from corresponding plasmid constructs and directionally cloned into pGBT9, a yeast expression vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA).

Human cDNA libraries derived from fetal liver in pGAD10 (Clontech) were screened in the yeast two-hybrid system (9Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Google Scholar, 10Chien C. Bartel L.P. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Google Scholar), for αIIb cytoplasmic domain binding proteins, as described by the manufacturer. The CIB cDNA insert was subcloned into pGEX 2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The in-frame fusion was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The GST-fusion protein was purified by glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) affinity chromatography following elution with 10 mM reduced glutathione. Recombinant CIB was released from GST by cleavage of the GST fusion protein while on the column with 10 units of thrombin as described by the manufacturer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a PVDF membrane (0.2-μ pore size). Blots were overlaid with 45Ca2+ (1 μCi/ml) for 10 min as described by Maruyama et al. (11Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 511-519Google Scholar) with or without excess unlabeled CaCl2 (10 mM). Total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) from washed human platelets made free of leukocytes and other cells. The RNA was reverse-transcribed using the 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and random primers. PCR amplification of specific fragments was performed for 30 cycles using specific sense (5′-CGAGTTGGCGGAGCTGT-3′) and antisense (5′-AGGATGTTGTCGATGAG-3′) primers to amplify a 0.5-kb fragment of CIB, and sense (5′-GGCATTCAGTCGCTGTCA-3′) and antisense (5′-CTCGTTGGCTGCGTCCA-3′) primers to amplify a 1.05-kb fragment of αIIb. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against an antigenic synthetic peptide derived from the amino acid sequence (KQEILLAHRRFCELLPQEQR) of CIB. The antisera were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting to determine specificity and titer for recombinant CIB. Monoclonal antibodies against CIB were developed by immunizing mice with GST-CIB and screening the culture supernatants with thrombin-cleaved CIB (North Carolina State University Hybridoma Facility). Microtiter wells were coated with 10 μg/ml recombinant CIB, monoclonal antibody 10E5 (provided by Dr. Barry Coller, Mt. Sinai Medical Center, New York), or BSA. After blocking with 1% BSA, 5-fold diluted platelet extract in 1% Triton X-100 containing 2 mM Ca2+ was added to each well and incubated for 1 h. Wells were washed four times with PBST. Wells containing immobilized CIB and BSA were incubated with αIIbβ3 complex-specific mAb 10E5, whereas wells containing immobilized mAb 10E5 were incubated with recombinant CIB (10 μg/ml) followed by anti-CIB antiserum. The amount of bound αIIbβ3 and recombinant CIB were determined using anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, respectively. Using the αIIb cytoplasmic domain (αIIb-cyt) as bait, we screened a human fetal liver cDNA library constructed in plasmid pGAD10 encoding the GAL4 activation domain. A human fetal liver library was of special interest because the fetal liver produces platelets, making it a likely source of relevant platelet-related cDNA. Out of 2 × 106 total clones screened, we isolated a single clone (clone 8). In an experiment designed to eliminate false positives, plasmid DNA from clone 8 was isolated, purified, and retransformed into the yeast SFY526 strain alone or with one of the following: (a) pGBT9, (b) a pGBT9 hybrid with an αIIb-cyt insert, or (c) a pGBT9 hybrid with the unrelated protein, lamin C (Fig. 1). Only transformants that received the αIIb-cyt hybrid and clone 8 were positive for β-galactosidase activity, indicating a true positive interaction. The clone 8 cDNA was also transformed into the yeast SFY526 strain along with plasmid pGBT9 encoding cytoplasmic domains of integrins αIIb, αv, α2, α5, β1, or β3, and β-galactosidase activity was quantified. The product of clone 8 failed to interact with the cytoplasmic domains of integrins αv, α2, α5, β1, and β3, indicating a relatively specific interaction with the αIIb cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis of this clone indicated an 855-bp insert and an ATG sequence (bp 47-49) in a region making it the likely translation start site (12Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Google Scholar). The open reading frame of 573 bp encodes a polypeptide of 191 amino acids with a predicted mass of 21.7 kDa (Fig. 2A). A consensus sequence for a polyadenylation recognition site (AATAAA) is located 20 bp before the 3′ end. A search of GenBank™ using the cDNA sequence revealed no significant homology to any published genes. Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis (13Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-128Google Scholar) of the deduced amino acid sequence predicts that the protein is highly hydrophilic. CIB has a large number of acidic amino acid residues with a predicted isoelectric point of 4.48 and net charge of −13. Sequence analysis of CIB using “Prosite” revealed an N-terminal myristoylation site, two consensus sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase C, and five consensus sites for phosphorylation by casein kinase II (Fig. 2A). A search of protein data banks indicated that the deduced amino acid sequence is novel but shares homology with calcineurin B, the regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2B (28% identity, 58% similarity) and calmodulin (27% identity, 55% similarity) (Fig. 2B). Further sequence analysis of CIB indicated the presence of two EF-hand motifs that correspond to the two adjacent C-terminal Ca2+ binding domains in calcineurin B and calmodulin. The identity between EF-hand motif I of CIB and EF-hand 3 of calcineurin B is 39% and that of EF-hand II of CIB and EF-hand 4 of calcineurin B is 35% (Fig. 2B). To determine whether Ca2+ specifically bound to CIB, we performed 45Ca2+ blot overlay assays. Purified bovine calmodulin was used as a positive control. Recombinant CIB, which was purified free from GST as described under “Experimental Procedures,” had a mass of ∼25 kDa. 45Ca2+ bound to CIB and calmodulin; the binding was abolished upon inclusion of 10 mM unlabeled Ca2+, indicating a specific interaction (Fig. 3). To address whether CIB is expressed in human platelets and other hematopoietic cells or cell lines, we isolated total RNA from platelets, leukocytes, HEL cells, and K-562 cells. RT-PCR was performed using CIB-specific sense and antisense primers designed to amplify a 0.5-kb segment. As a control for the quality of platelet RNA, αIIb-specific primers, designed to amplify a 1.05-kb segment, were used. With CIB-specific primers, we observed the amplification of a 0.5-kb band from RNA derived from platelets and HEL cells (Fig. 4A) indicating the presence of CIB-specific mRNA. A slightly smaller sized band was observed from leukocytes and K-562 cells, the identity of which is not yet known. In contrast, none of these bands were amplified in a breast cancer cell line (T47D). Amplification of a fragment of the expected size (∼1 kb) from platelet RNA with αIIb primers served as a positive control and demonstrates the integrity of the platelet RNA. We also performed Western blot analysis using two different monoclonal anti-CIB antibodies in an attempt to detect CIB in platelets, HEL, and K-562 cells. Both mAbs detected an ∼25-kDa band in platelet but not in HEL or K-562 cell extracts (Fig. 4B) despite the detection of CIB mRNA in HEL cells. The slightly higher than predicted molecular mass observed on Western blots may be due to post-translational modification of CIB. In vitro binding assays were used to determine whether CIB interacts with the intact heterodimeric αIIbβ3 integrin. In these experiments, purified recombinant CIB was immobilized to microtiter wells, wells were blocked with BSA, and αIIbβ3 from platelet extract was allowed to bind. The amount of integrin bound was quantified using mAb 10E5, an integrin complex specific antibody. Immobilized CIB bound significantly higher levels of αIIbβ3 than did immobilized BSA in the absence of CIB (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained in a reverse experiment in which heterodimeric integrin αIIbβ3 from platelet lysate was captured on immobilized mAb 10E5 (Fig. 5B). Significantly more recombinant CIB bound to wells containing antibody-captured integrin αIIbβ3 than to similarly treated wells lacking mAb 10E5, as detected with anti-CIB antiserum. Moreover, CIB did not bind to immobilized mAb 10E5 alone (data not shown). These results demonstrate an in vitro interaction of CIB with integrin αIIbβ3. In the present study, we attempted to identify molecules that might interact with cytoplasmic domains of αIIbβ3, using the yeast two-hybrid system (9Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Google Scholar, 10Chien C. Bartel L.P. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Google Scholar). We isolated a novel full-length human cDNA that encodes a polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 21.7 kDa, which binds to the integrin αIIb cytoplasmic domain and is expressed in platelets. The structural properties of CIB indicate that it is a hydrophilic calcium-binding protein, most similar to calcineurin B and calmodulin. Calcineurin B is a small regulatory subunit (19 kDa) of phosphoprotein phosphatase 2B or calcineurin, the only known protein phosphatase that is regulated by Ca2+ and calmodulin (14Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Google Scholar). Calcineurin is a heterodimer that also consists of a large catalytic subunit, calcineurin A. The A subunit binds calmodulin, whereas the B subunit binds four atoms of Ca2+ (14Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Google Scholar) and is a member of the “EF-hand” family of Ca2+-binding proteins. Calmodulin is a well described Ca2+-dependent regulatory molecule for several different enzymes. Unlike calcineurin B and calmodulin, CIB has two rather than four EF-hand motifs. Nonetheless, the similarity between CIB and these regulatory molecules raises the question as to whether CIB also serves as a regulatory subunit for an unknown enzyme(s) as well as for integrin αIIbβ3. Because CIB appears to interact only with αIIb and not with other integrin α subunits (αv, α2, and α5) in the yeast two-hybrid system, it is unlikely that CIB binds to the membrane-proximal GFFKR region of the αIIb cytoplasmic domain, since this sequence is common to all integrin α subunits. This is in contrast to calreticulin, a Ca2+-binding protein that binds to GFFKR (15Rojiani M.V. Finlay B.B. Gray V. Dedhar S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9859-9866Google Scholar) and co-purifies with several integrins (16Leung-Hagesteijn C.Y. Milankov K. Michalak M. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 589-600Google Scholar). This suggests that the CIB binding site on the αIIb cytoplasmic domain may include the highly acidic portion distal to the membrane. It is well documented that a rise in intracellular Ca2+ is a prerequisite for platelet activation by many agonists. How intracellular calcium regulates the function of integrins is not clearly understood. One possibility is that an increase in intracellular Ca2+ may regulate integrin function through CIB or a CIB-like protein. In fact, it has been shown that neutrophil migration on vitronectin is regulated by calcineurin; migration is decreased by inhibitors of calcineurin or intracellular Ca2+ chelators, suggesting that increases in [Ca2+]i promote neutrophil migration and reduce integrin-mediated cell adhesion to vitronectin (17Hendey B. Lawson M. Marcantonio E.E. Maxfield F.R. Blood. 1996; 87: 2038-2048Google Scholar). Interaction of fibronectin and integrin α5β1 in vitro has also been shown to be regulated by calcineurin (18Pomies P. Frachet P. Block M.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5104-5112Google Scholar). It was further demonstrated that Ca2+ and calcineurin regulate recycling of integrin αvβ3 to the leading edge of migrating neutrophils (17Hendey B. Lawson M. Marcantonio E.E. Maxfield F.R. Blood. 1996; 87: 2038-2048Google Scholar, 19Lawson M.A. Maxfield F.R. Nature. 1995; 376: 75-79Google Scholar). The αIIbβ3 integrin also undergoes recycling, in a process that down-regulates platelet aggregation (20Wencel-Drake J.D. Boudignon-Proudhon C. Dieter M.G. Criss A.B. Parise L.V. Blood. 1996; 87: 602-612Google Scholar). This event appears to be independent of the β3 cytoplasmic domain (21Ylanne J. Huuskonen J. O'Toole T.E. Ginsberg M.H. Virtanen I. Gahmberg C.G. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 9550-9557Google Scholar) and probably dependent on the αIIb cytoplasmic domain. Thus, it is possible that calcineurin or a calcineurin-like regulatory molecule such as CIB contributes to recycling. In this regard, Barroso et al. (22Barroso M.R. Bernd K.K. DeWitt N.D. Chang A. Mills K. Sztul E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10183-10187Google Scholar) have reported the cloning of a novel 22-kDa calcium-binding protein (p22) that is also highly homologous to calcineurin B and required for constitutive membrane traffic. Another protein called CHP, which is 99% identical to p22, is involved in regulating the Na+/H+ antiporter by interacting with a specific domain of the cytoplasmic tail (23Lin Xia. Barber D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Google Scholar). Both of these proteins have two distinct C-terminal EF-hand motifs, like CIB. However, their amino acid sequences are only 53% homologous (29% identical) to CIB, but do suggest the existence of a family of small regulatory Ca2+-binding proteins with two EF-hand motifs. Both serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events appear to play key roles in the regulation of integrin function (24Barreuther M.F. Grabel L.B. Exp.

Recently, it has been shown that exposure of ligand binding sites on αIIbβ3 correlates under some conditions with phosphorylation of the β3 subunit of αIIbβ3 although the extent of β3 phosphorylation is unclear (25Van Willigen G. Hers I. Gorter G. Akkerman J.W.N. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 769-779Google Scholar, 26Hillery C.A. Smyth S.S. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14663-14669Google Scholar). In addition, a protein kinase that interacts with the β1 and β3 cytoplasmic domains has been identified (27Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Gibbon L.F. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that a protein phosphatase may be directly involved in integrin regulation. Since CIB shows structural similarity to calcineurin B, it is conceivable that CIB may also be a subunit of a multisubunit protein phosphatase. Thus, it will be of interest to determine specific sites that mediate CIB binding to αIIb, identify other molecules that bind to CIB, and delineate functional details of this novel Ca2+-binding protein.

https://openalex.org/W2073893214,"Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is anchored at specific subcellular sites through the interaction of the regulatory subunit (R) with protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) via an amphipathic helix binding motif. Synthetic peptides containing this amphipathic helix domain competitively disrupt PKA binding to AKAPs and cause a loss of PKA modulation of cellular responses. In this report we use S-Ht31, a cell-permeant anchoring inhibitor peptide, to study the role of PKA anchoring in sperm. Our analysis of three species of mammalian sperm detected three isoforms of PKA (RIIα, RIIβ, and RIβ) and one 110-kDa AKAP. The addition of S-Ht31 to bovine caudal epididymal sperm inhibits motility in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. A control peptide, S-Ht31-P, identical to S-Ht31 except for a proline for isoleucine substitution to prevent amphipathic helix formation, had no effect on motility. The inhibition of motility by S-Ht31 is reversible but only if calcium is present in the suspension buffer, suggesting a role for PKA anchoring in regulating cellular calcium homeostasis. Surprisingly, inhibition of PKA catalytic activity had little effect on basal motility or motility stimulated by agents previously thought to work via PKA activation. These data suggest that the interaction of the regulatory subunit of PKA with sperm AKAPs, independent of PKA catalytic activity, is a key regulator of sperm motility and that disruption of this interaction using cell-permeable anchoring inhibitor peptides may form the basis of a sperm-targeted contraceptive.

Signal transduction enzymes such as protein kinases and phosphatases play pivotal roles in mediating cellular responses to a wide variety of stimuli. These enzymes are often targeted to specific substrates or cellular compartments through their interaction with cellular “anchoring proteins” (1Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Google Scholar). This anchoring or compartmentalization is thought to be critical in determining the specificity of response for a particular stimuli (2Scott J.D. Carr D.W.

Synthetic peptides containing an amphipathic helix domain are able to competitively disrupt PKA binding to AKAPs (6Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D.C. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Google Scholar). Microinjection of these anchoring inhibitor peptides (AIPs) into neurons or skeletal muscle cells disrupts PKA anchoring and PKA modulation of glutamate receptor channels (7Rosenmund C. Carr D.W. Bergeson S.E. Nilaver G. Scott J.D. Westbrook G.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 853-856Google Scholar) and voltage-gated calcium channels (8Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11492-11496Google Scholar). To facilitate studies of PKA anchoring in cells where microinjection is not feasible, we now have developed membrane-permeable AIPs containing an amino-terminal stearic acid moiety. Similar approaches with fatty acid-peptide conjugates have been used to inhibit protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase activities in intact cells (9Eichholtz T. de Bont D.B.A. de Widt J. Liskamp R.M.J.

Sperm are an excellent model in which to test permeant AIPs. Cyclic AMP is known to mediate the motility of sperm and a variety of other ciliated cells (11Satir P. Mod.

Fertil. 1974; 37: 131-133Google Scholar). Cell-permeant cAMP analogs, cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and adenylyl cyclase activators all stimulate motility of sperm from several species (15Garbers D.L. First N.L. Lardy H.A. Biol.

Res. 1985; 10: 499-510Google Scholar). The kinetic and metabolic responses to cAMP elevation occur within 5-10 min (15Garbers D.L. First N.L. Lardy H.A. Biol. Reprod. 1973; 8: 589-598Google Scholar, 16Garbers D.L. Watkins H.E. Tubb J. Kopf G.S. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1978; 9: 583-595Google Scholar). Sperm lack nucleic acid and protein synthetic activity, thereby considerably reducing the possible range of targets of cAMP action. The highly polarized sperm cell has distinct subcellular structures easily distinguished at the light microscopic level. Immunogold staining indicates a predominant localization of type II PKA (RII) to the outer membrane of the mitochondria, which spirals around the proximal flagella (20Lieberman S.J. Wasco W. MacLeod J. Satir P. Orr G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1809-1816Google Scholar). A developmentally regulated sperm AKAP (S-AKAP84) is also localized to the sperm mitochondria (21Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Google Scholar). These data suggest that PKA anchoring might be a key factor in the regulation of sperm motility. In this report we characterize sperm PKA isoforms and AKAPs and show that AIPs, but not PKA inhibitors, are able to totally arrest sperm motility. These data suggest that the interaction of RII with AKAPs, but not PKA catalytic activity, is essential for motility. Testes from mature bulls with intact tunica were obtained from a local slaughterhouse, and sperm from caput or caudal epididymis were isolated and washed as described previously (22Vijayaraghavan S. Critchlow L.M. Hoskins D.D. Biol. Reprod. 1985; 32: 489-500Google Scholar). The sperm were resuspended in buffer A (120 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4) supplemented with 10 mM glucose and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for motility measurements. Monkey semen was obtained by electroejaculation and processed by procedures previously reported (23Smith G.D. Wolf D.P. Trautman K.C. da Cruze Silva E.F. Greengard P. Vijayaraghavan S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 719-727Google Scholar). Human semen were obtained from a fertility clinic at the Oregon Health Sciences University. Head motility parameters were determined as described previously (24Vijayaraghavan S. Stephens D.T. Trautman K. Smith G.D. Khatra B. da Cruze Silva E.F. Greengard P. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 709-718Google Scholar, 25Stephens D.T. Hickman R. Hoskins D.D. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 38: 577-586Google Scholar). A 3-4-μl aliquot of sperm suspension (5 × 107/ml) was loaded onto a counting chamber at 37°C. After bulk fluid movement had subsided, six different locations on the slide were recorded. The videotaped segments were analyzed by a computerized image analysis system (CASMA) as described previously (24Vijayaraghavan S. Stephens D.T. Trautman K. Smith G.D. Khatra B. da Cruze Silva E.F. Greengard P. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 709-718Google Scholar, 25Stephens D.T. Hickman R. Hoskins D.D. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 38: 577-586Google Scholar). This computer system measures several parameters of head motion. In this report we have used the forward motility index (FMI) as a measure of motility. FMI is a product of percent motile (%M, percent of sperm moving at velocity greater that 20 mm/s) and average velocity (Va, the five-point smoothed average of the head positions through at least 20 of the 30 frames analyzed). In most cases both components of FMI were found to increase together. PKA was assayed as described previously (26Carr D.W. DeManno D.A. Atwood A. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20729-20732Google Scholar) with minor changes. Whole caput or caudal sperm were treated with 2-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine (50 μM) or H-89 (50 μM), or both, for 30 min. at 37°C. The sperm were then washed 2 times in an ice-cold homogenization buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors, benzamidine (10 mM), leupeptin (4 μg/ml), and L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (100 μM) and sonicated for 1 min. Reaction mixtures (20 μl total) contained 250 μM Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide), 250 μM [γ-32P]ATP, 25 mM Na3VO4, 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and where indicated, 10 μM cAMP. Assays were initiated by the addition of labeled ATP, incubated for 2 min at 30°C, and stopped by addition of 30 μl of 1 N HCl. Twenty μl of the reaction was then spotted on phosphocellulose paper followed by three washes in 75 mM phosphoric acid. The papers were then analyzed by Cerenkov counting. All determinations were in quadruplicate. The peptides were synthesized on an automated synthesizer using N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl chemistry employing base-mediated coupling. The activator of choice was either benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate or O-(7-azabenzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate using diisopropylethylamine as solvent. Stearic acid was added together with an activator of attachment to the free NH2 terminus of the protected peptide. The progress of the stearation reaction was monitored by ninhydrin, a trifluoroacetic acid test cleave, or by mass spectral or HPLC analysis. The final stearated peptide product was purified by reverse phase HPLC using a C8 column employing a trifluoracetic acid/acetonitrile buffer system. To identify the correct peak and facilitate the recovery of pure material, the molecular weight confirmation of the stearated material was performed using a time of flight mass spectrometry analyzer. Analytical HPLC traces of the pooled fractions confirmed the expected purity. Pooled fractions were lyophilized to a dry powder under nitrogen. The peptides had the following sequences: S-Ht31, N-stearate-DLIEEAASRIVDAVIEQVKAAGAY; S-Ht31-P, N-stearate-DLIEEAASRPVDAVPEQVKAAGAY; S-AKAP79, N-stearate-YETLLIETASSLVKNAIQLSIE; S-CaNBP, N-stearate-SLKRLVTRRKRSESSKQQKPLE; and S-PKI, N-stearate-TYADFIASGRTGRRNAI. The overlay procedure is a modified Western blot procedure. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon. After treatment with Blotto to prevent nonspecific binding, radiolabeled RIIα or RIIβ probes were applied (27Carr D.W. Scott J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 246-249Google Scholar). Recombinant RIIα was produced as described previously (5Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Google Scholar, 6Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D.C. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Google Scholar). RIIβ and RIβ were gifts from Dr. John Scott (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). Two different variations of the overlay assay were used. In the first procedure, we used recombinant RII that has been radiolabeled by incubating it with the catalytic subunit of PKA and [32P]ATP. After separation from free[32P]ATP, the 32P-labeled RII (500,000 cpm/10 ml of Blotto) was incubated with the blocked blot for 4 h followed by washing and autoradiography. In the second procedure, we incubated the blot with cold RIβ (1 μg/10 ml of Blotto) and then washed and incubated it with anti-RIβ antiserum. After washing again, we incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. A final wash was followed by development with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Renaissance, DuPont NEN). The PKA isoform-specific antibodies were affinity-purified antibodies obtained from Triple Point Biologics (Forest Grove, OR). Cyclic AMP is known to stimulate sperm motility in a variety of species. To determine if PKA anchoring is involved in regulating motility, we first identified the PKA isoforms and AKAPs present in mammalian sperm. Immunoblot analysis of sperm proteins with affinity-purified isoform-specific antibodies detected three (RIIα, RIIβ, and RIb) of the four known PKA isoforms in bovine, human, and monkey sperm (Fig. 1A). RIα was not detected in any of the species under these conditions, although in subsequent experiments using concentrated sperm lysates and lower dilutions of antibodies we were able to detect RIα in bovine sperm, suggesting that it does exist in sperm, just at lower concentrations than the other isoforms. The lower Mr bands detected in bovine and human sperm with anti-RIα antibody might be breakdown products of RIα. However, the other isoforms showed very little apparent proteolysis, suggesting these bands are probably due to the antibody cross-reacting with unrelated proteins. The fuzziness of the bands detected with the RIIα and RIβ antibodies suggests that these proteins may be at least partially phosphorylated. To determine if these isoforms are associated with the soluble or insoluble fractions, bovine sperm were homogenized, centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min, and subjected to Western analysis (Fig. 1B). Greater than 50% of all three R subunit isoforms are present in the pellet fraction of sperm sonicates, and RIβ is found almost exclusively in this fraction. These results suggest that all of these isoforms are associated with structural or cytoskeletal elements of the sperm. Overlay analysis of bovine, human, and monkey sperm using 32P-labeled RIIα or RIIβ as probes detected a single dominant AKAP in each species (Fig. 1C). The bovine and human AKAP migrated at Mr = 110,000, and the monkey AKAP was slightly larger at 115,000. The bands detected at approximately 55 kDa by the RIIβ probe are probably due to dimerization of the probe with endogenous RII, although it is not clear why these proteins are preferentially binding to RIIβ compared with RIIα. Overlay analysis using RIβ did not detect any binding proteins (data not shown). These data suggest that a single AKAP in sperm may be responsible for the localization of both RIIα and RIIβ. The fact that RIβ is clearly present in the particulate fraction but does not interact with denatured proteins on the blot suggests that the overlay method may not be appropriate for detecting AKAPs that interact with RIβ. All AKAPs identified to date contain an amphipathic helix domain responsible for RII binding (5Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Google Scholar, 6Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D.C. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Google Scholar, 28Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E.

A peptide, Ht31, containing an amphipathic helix domain binds to RII and competitively inhibits the interaction of RII with other AKAPs (6Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D.C. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Google Scholar). The addition of this anchoring inhibitor peptide to the overlay assay blocked RII binding with AKAP 110 (Fig. 1D), suggesting that this sperm AKAP also contains an amphipathic helix binding domain. A cell-permeable stearated Ht31 counterpart, S-Ht31, also inhibited in vitro binding of RII to AKAP 110, albeit at a reduced potency (85% inhibition compared with 100% by the non-stearated Ht31). The control peptide, S-Ht31-P, which has a proline substitution preventing amphipathic helix formation, had no effect on RII binding. In order to determine if in situ RII/AKAP interactions are disrupted by the S-Ht31, the control and S-Ht31-treated sperm were fractionated to separate RII bound to AKAPs (particulate) from RII that is soluble. The addition of the anchoring inhibitor peptide caused a significant translocation of RIIβ (Fig. 1E; 24.6 ± 3.0% increase in soluble RIIβ, n = 4, p < 0.05), suggesting the AIP was capable of disrupting RIIβ/AKAP interaction. Although we did not detect any S-Ht31-mediated translocation of RIIα, this may be due to the fact the RIIα is trapped in the flagellar cytoskeletal meshwork after disruption of the RIIα·;AKAP complex. Previous studies have shown that RIIα can only be removed from the flagellum by repeated washes with dithiothreitol and that this solubilization of RII by dithiothreitol is not a rapid process but occurs over a period of several hours (31Horowitz J.A. Wasco W. Leiser M. Orr G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2098-2104Google Scholar). They also show that sperm RII binding proteins (AKAPs) are not solubilized under these conditions and suggest that the RIIα is trapped in a highly disulfide cross-linked structure. To determine the effects of anchoring inhibitor peptides on sperm motility, S-Ht31 was added to vigorously motile sperm under a variety of conditions. S-Ht31 inhibits basal motility in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. A complete arrest of motility was observed at concentrations from 5 to 50 μM within 3-5 min after treatment (Fig. 2A). When motility is measured at 5 min post-treatment, the concentration of S-Ht31 needed to produce 50% inhibition is approximately 1 μM (Fig. 2B). A control peptide, S-Ht31-P, which is ineffective in disrupting PKA anchoring to AKAPs (see Fig. 1D), had no effect on sperm motility at concentrations of up to 100 μM, suggesting that motility inhibition by S-Ht31 was due to a disruption of PKA anchoring. To test the specificity of the stearated peptides, three other stearated peptides were synthesized. Two of these peptides were based on sequences from AKAP79. The first peptide (S-AKAP79) contained the amphipathic helix RII binding domain (28Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Cone R.D. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16816-16823Google Scholar) and the second (S-CaNBP) contained the domain that binds to protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin) but should not bind to RII (32Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-111Google Scholar). The third peptide (S-PKI) contained the sequence of the protein kinase A inhibitor peptide that should interact with the catalytic subunit of PKA but not the regulatory subunit (33Glass D.B. Lundquist L.J. Katz B.M. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 84-14579Google Scholar). Only the peptide containing the amphipathic helix RII binding motif (S-AKAP79) inhibited sperm motility (Fig. 2C). The S-CaNBP and S-PKI peptides inhibited the activity of calcineurin and PKA, respectively, 2S. Vijayaraghavan, K. Trautman, S. A. Goueli, and D. W. Carr, manuscript in preparation. but had no effect on motility. The reduced potency of S-AKAP79 compared with S-Ht31 might be due to the fact that this peptide was very insoluble in aqueous solution. The peptide would only dissolve in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide, and therefore its final concentration after being diluted into aqueous buffer is uncertain. Equivalent amounts of dimethyl sulfoxide were added to control sperm without effects on motility. These data are consistent with a model where RII/AKAP interaction is required for sperm motility. To determine if S-Ht31 is effecting the viability or structural integrity of the sperm, the vital dyes SYBR-green and rhodamine 123 were added to sperm before and after treatment with S-Ht31. Only viable, intact cells will take up these dyes. Both treated and control sperm accumulated these dyes to the same extent, suggesting that the stearated peptide did not decrease viability or disrupt the integrity of the sperm plasma membrane. In experiments using sperm loaded with the chromophores 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein or Fura 2, the addition of digitonin but not S-Ht31 caused the release of these dyes, confirming that peptide treatment did not compromise the integrity of the plasma membrane (data not shown). Perhaps the best evidence supporting the viability of the S-Ht31-treated sperm is that, under certain conditions, the sperm are able to regain full motility. Monitoring motility beyond 5 min of S-Ht31 treatment showed that sperm kinetic activity recovered spontaneously over 30-60 min period (Fig. 3A). This recovery occurred only in sperm suspended in calcium containing medium. In medium depleted of external calcium by EGTA, S-Ht31 caused irreversible motility arrest. The motility of untreated sperm was unaffected in the presence or absence of calcium. Bicarbonate ion has been shown to stimulate sperm adenylyl cyclase (34Okamura N. Tajima Y. Soejima A. Masuda H. Sugita Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9699-9705Google Scholar) and increase intracellular pH (22Vijayaraghavan S. Critchlow L.M. Hoskins D.D. Biol. Reprod. 1985; 32: 489-500Google Scholar) and is an essential component of suspension buffers required for optimal sperm function in vitro (35Lee M.A. Storey B.T. Biol. Reprod. 1986; 34: 349-356Google Scholar, 36Kopf G.S. Gerton G.L. Wassarmaan P.M. Elements of Mammalian Fertilization. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 153-203Google Scholar). Sperm motility in the presence of bicarbonate is significantly enhanced compared with untreated sperm (Fig. 3B. To determine the effect of AIPs on stimulated sperm, S-Ht31 was added to sperm in both basal and bicarbonate-supplemented media (Fig. 3B). The peptide was equally effective in inhibiting motility in both media. Similar results were obtained when sperm were pretreated with other activators of motility, dibutyryl cAMP, IBMX, and CDA, all thought to increase cAMP content (data not shown). The peptide also caused inhibition of motility when added to undiluted rhesus monkey and human ejaculated semen. 3S. Vijayaraghan and D. W. Carr, unpublished observations. If the effect of anchoring inhibitor peptides on sperm motility is due to the dissociation of the catalytic subunit of PKA from its preferred substrates then this effect should be mimicked by inhibitors of PKA activity. However, the addition of up to 100 μM S-PKI to sperm had no effect on motility (Fig. 2C). The addition of high levels of another PKA inhibitor, H-89 (50 μM), inhibited basal sperm motility approximately 50% or less and had no effect on sperm motility stimulated by the adenosine analog CDA (Fig. 4A). Essentially identical data were obtained when sperm were stimulated with IBMX or 8-bromo-cAMP instead of CDA. This unexpectedly weak action of H-89 apparently results primarily from a decrease in motility of a subpopulation of sperm because a considerable proportion of sperm maintains vigorous motility. This contrasts sharply with the complete arrest of motility seen in S-Ht31-treated sperm. Also, unlike the action of AIPs, H-89 had no effect on CDA-stimulated sperm. The effectiveness of H-89 was also observed with caput sperm, which are immotile unless stimulated with agents such as CDA or IBMX. Motility induction by CDA is unaffected by preincubating sperm with H-89 before treatment (Fig. 4A). Together these observations suggest that AIPs and PKA inhibitors have different mechanisms of action. In previous reports, initiation or stimulation of sperm motility by CDA was associated with an elevation of cAMP, and an increase in PKA activity was assumed (37Vijayaraghavan S. Hoskins D.D. Biol. Reprod. 1986; 34: 468-477Google Scholar). Because H-89 failed to suppress stimulation of motility by CDA, we measured PKA activity from caudal and caput sperm that had been treated with CDA, H-89, or CDA + H-89 (Fig. 4B). All assays were performed in the absence or presence of cAMP to determine the basal and maximal PKA activities. CDA increased basal PKA activity by approximately 60% in both caudal and caput sperm. H-89 treatment, in the presence or absence of CDA, strongly inhibited PKA activity. The addition of cAMP to the assay was not able to overcome this inhibition. To ensure that H-89 was affecting PKA activity in the cells and not just its activity in the in vitro assay, the sperm were washed several times before lysis to remove all exogenous H-89. As a control, the non-permeable PKA inhibitor peptide (50 μM) was added to sperm which then were washed, lysed, and assayed for PKA activity in a manner identical to the H-89 treated sperm. PKA inhibitor peptide had no effect on cellular PKA activity, although a similar concentration, when added to the PKA assay, will inhibit virtually 100% of activity (data not shown). These data suggest that motility stimulation associated with treatments that elevate cAMP does not require increases in the catalytic activity of PKA and can occur even if PKA activity is substantially inhibited. As an initial step in studying the role of PKA anchoring in regulation of sperm function, we first identified PKA isoforms and AKAPs that are present in mammalian sperm. Three of the four isoforms of the regulatory subunit of PKA were detected in bovine, human, and monkey sperm. RIα was only detected when higher concentrations of antibody were used, suggesting that this isoform may be less prevalent than the other isoforms. Consistent with previous reports (31Horowitz J.A. Wasco W. Leiser M. Orr G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2098-2104Google Scholar), the major proportion of all isoforms remained in the particulate fraction, presumably due to their interaction with AKAPs. Bovine, human, and monkey sperm all contain one predominant AKAP with a relative molecular weight of 110,000-115,000. The AKAPs predominantly localize to the particulate fraction and bind both RIIα and RIIβ, suggesting that a single AKAP is responsible for the localization of both these RII isoforms. Overlay assays using RIβ as a probe did not detect any binding protein in sperm. Preliminary analysis at the electron microscope level detects RIIβ in both the head and tail while RIIα is found almost exclusively associated with the flagellum. 4S. Vijayaraghavan, G. E. Olson, S. K. NagDas, V. P. Winfrey, and D. W. Carr, manuscript in preparation. In concordance with our observations, Orr and colleagues (31Horowitz J.A. Wasco W. Leiser M. Orr G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2098-2104Google Scholar) reported one predominant AKAP at Mr of approximately 120,000 in bovine sperm (31Horowitz J.A. Wasco W. Leiser M. Orr G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2098-2104Google Scholar), and Rubin and colleagues (21Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Google Scholar) found a single RIIβ AKAP (∼120 kDa) in mature mouse sperm. Others, however, have reported RIIα AKAPs of 82 kDa in mouse (38Carrera A. Gerton G.L. Moss S.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 272-284Google Scholar), 80 kDa in rat (31Horowitz J.A. Wasco W. Leiser M. Orr G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2098-2104Google Scholar), and 72 kDa in human (39Pariset C. Weinman S. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 39: 415-422Google Scholar). The reason for these differences is not clear, although proteolysis is one possibility. We find that prolonged storage of SDS-solubilized extracts leads to the loss of the 110-kDa band and the appearance of an 80-kDa band. The 72-kDa RIIα binding band reported in human sperm (39Pariset C. Weinman S. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 39: 415-422Google Scholar) is distinct from all other known AKAPs due to the fact that it was detected using a peptide from RIIα (45-75) that does not contain the AKAP binding domain (40Luo Z. Shafit-Zagardo B. Erlichman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21804-21810Google Scholar, 41Scott J.D. Stofko R.E. McDonald J.R. Comer J.D. Vitalis E.A. Mangili J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Google Scholar). Finally, a recent report has described the cloning of a sperm AKAP of 84 kDa uniquely expressed during spermatogenesis (21Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Google Scholar). Intriguingly, this AKAP is not found in mature sperm and thus its relationship, if any, to AKAP 110 in mature sperm is unknown. To date, only sperm cells have been shown to contain an AKAP of 110 kDa. If it turns out that AKAP 110 is unique to sperm, this protein could possibly be used as a target for a male contraceptive. Several previous reports have suggested that flagellar activity in sperm is regulated by cAMP (12Tash J.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 14: 332-339Google Scholar, 44Garbers D.L. Kopf G.S. Greengard P. Robison G.A. Advances in Cyclic Nucleotide Research. 13. Raven Press, New York1980: 252-306Google Scholar, 45Lindemann C.B. Kanous K.S. Arch. Androl. 1989; 23: 1-22Google Scholar, 46Tash J.S. Means A.R. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 267: 335-355Google Scholar). Both PKA and AKAPs have been shown to be located at the same subcellular site in sperm in the outer mitochondrial membrane located on the proximal flagella, the sperm “midpiece” (20Lieberman S.J. Wasco W. MacLeod J. Satir P. Orr G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1809-1816Google Scholar, 21Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Google Scholar). Our study is the first to investigate the physiological role of PKA anchoring in sperm function. The addition of cell-permeable anchoring inhibitor peptides dramatically inhibits sperm motility in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This inhibition is reversible, but only in the presence of external calcium, suggesting that the regulatory mechanism being disrupted may involve the maintenance of calcium homeostasis or a calcium-regulated function that recovers only in the presence of exogenous calcium. Since the mitochondria plays an important role in sperm calcium homeostasis (47Babcock D.F. First N.L. Lardy H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3881-3886Google Scholar, 48Vijayaraghavan S. Hoskins D. Cell Calcium. 1989; 10: 241-253Google Scholar, 49Vijayaraghavan S. Bhattacharyya A. Hoskins D.D. Biol. Reprod. 1989; 40: 744-751Google Scholar, 50Vijayaraghavan S. Hoskins D.D. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1990; 25: 186-194Google Scholar, 51Vijayaraghavan S. Trautman K. Mishra S.K. Hermsmeyer K. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 38: 326-333Google Scholar), it is possible that disruption of RII anchoring in this region could be responsible for the changes in sperm Ca2+ regulation. The control peptide, S-Ht31-P, had no effect on motility, suggesting that motility inhibition by S-Ht31 and S-AKAP79 was not due to the stearate moiety but due to the disruption of PKA anchoring. Although we cannot prove that the anchoring inhibitor peptides arrest motility by disrupting RII/AKAP interaction instead of another protein/protein interaction, evidence supporting this hypothesis include the following: 1) S-Ht31 disrupts RII/AKAP interaction in vitro, 2) the addition of S-Ht31 to sperm causes a translocation of RIIβ from the particulate to the soluble fraction, and 3) two different PKA-anchoring inhibitor peptides with totally unique sequences arrest motility while three other stearated peptides, including the S-Ht31-P control peptide, had no effect on motility. Reversibility of the motility inhibition and the observations that S-Ht31-treated sperm take up vital dyes provide evidence that the motility inhibition is not due to disruption of sperm plasma membrane integrity. The simplest model consistent with these data is that the interaction of the regulatory subunit of PKA with AKAP 110 is essential for sperm movement. It is usually assumed that the main function of PKA/AKAP interaction is to anchor the catalytic subunit at a preferential subcellular site for specific phosphorylation of protein substrates in the vicinity. This model is supported by studies showing that microinjection of AIPs into neuronal or muscle cells mimics the effect of PKA inhibitors, causing a loss of cAMP modulation of the glutamate receptor and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (7Rosenmund C. Carr D.W. Bergeson S.E. Nilaver G. Scott J.D. Westbrook G.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 853-856Google Scholar, 8Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11492-11496Google Scholar). In sperm, however, inhibition of the catalytic subunit of PKA does not mimic the effect of AIPs. Our studies now document that under conditions where sperm PKA is clearly inhibited, compounds that elevate cAMP such as CDA, IBMX, and 8-bromo-cAMP still induce or stimulate sperm motility. The lack of effect of S-PKI and H-89, even at concentrations as high as 100 μM, on cAMP-mediated induction and stimulation of motility is quite unequivocal. What then is the role of cAMP, independent of PKA activity, in sperm motility? Our data using anchoring inhibitor peptides provides a possible answer: that the interaction of the regulatory subunit with sperm AKAPs has regulatory actions independent of the catalytic subunit. The interaction between RII and other sperm proteins may also be cAMP-dependent, since cAMP is known to produce a conformational change in the regulatory subunit. Others have also suggested that the regulatory subunit acts independently of the catalytic subunit (52De Camilli P. Moretti M. Donini S.D. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 189-203Google Scholar). It is known that RII can inhibit phosphatases (53Khatra B.S. Printz R. Cobb C.E. Corbin J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 567-573Google Scholar), and preliminary data from our laboratory show that RII will inhibit sperm PP1.2 An independent role of RII in the regulation of sperm motility has also been suggested by reports showing that the addition of axokinin (later shown to be RII (54Noland T.D. Abumrad N.A. Beth A.H. Garbers D.L. Biol. Reprod. 1987; 37: 171-180Google Scholar, 55Paupard M.C. MacLeod J. Wasco W. Orr G.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 37: 161-175Google Scholar)) to demembraned sperm was sufficient to induce motility (56Tash J.S. Kakar S.S. Means A.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 551-559Google Scholar, 57Tash J.S. Hidaka H. Means A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 649-655Google Scholar, 58Tash J.S. Bracho G.E. J. Androl. 1994; 15: 505-509Google Scholar). The regulation of sperm motility may involve interactions between the RII·;AKAP complex and other sperm proteins. The demonstration that phosphatase PP2B, PKA, and protein kinase C are all anchored to the same AKAP in neurons (59Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Google Scholar) opens up several possible, previously unidentified roles for the individual members of this multimeric complex. Clearly, the isolation and characterization of the sperm AKAP and its associated proteins are required for further insights into their possible functions. Whatever the biochemical pathways controlled by the sperm RII anchoring complex may be, our data suggest that RII anchoring, independent of PKA catalytic activity, is essential for sperm motility and that cell-permeable AIPs are a useful tool for studying PKA anchoring in cellular function.

The 17-kDa proteolipid subunit (VMA3 gene product; Vma3p) is predicted to constitute at least part of the proton translocating pore of V0. Recently, two VMA3 homologues, VMA11 and VMA16 (PPA1), have been identified in yeast, and VMA11 has been shown to be required for the V-ATPase activity. Cells disrupted for the VMA16 gene displayed the same phenotypes as those lacking either Vma3p or Vma11p; the mutant cells lost V-ATPase activity and failed to assemble V-ATPase subunits onto the vacuolar membrane. Epitope-tagged Vma11p and Vma16p were detected on the vacuolar membrane by immunofluorescence microscopy. Density gradient fractionation of the solubilized vacuolar proteins demonstrated that the tagged proteins copurified with the V-ATPase complex. We conclude that Vma11p and Vma16p are essential subunits of the V-ATPase. Vma3p contains a conserved glutamic acid residue (Glu137) whose carboxyl side chain is predicted to be important for proton transport activity. Mutational analysis of Vma11p and Vma16p revealed that both proteins contain a glutamic acid residue (Vma11p Glu145 and Vma16p Glu108) functionally similar to Vma3p Glu137. These residues could only be functionally substituted by an aspartic acid residue, because other mutations we examined inactivated the enzyme activity. Assembly and vacuolar targeting of the enzyme complex was not inhibited by these mutations. These results suggest that the three proteolipid subunits have similar but not redundant functions, each of which is most likely involved in proton transport activity of the enzyme complex. Yeast cells contain V0 and V1 subcomplexes in the vacuolar membrane and in the cytosol, respectively, that can be assembled into the active V0V1 complex in vivo.

The 36-kDa subunit is not an integral membrane protein but stably associates with the V0 subcomplex and thus is considered to be a nonintegral component of the V0 domain (20Bauerle C. Ho M.N.

The membrane disposition of this subunit has not yet been unambiguously determined. Yeast cells also express genes that encode proteins with sequence similarity to the 100-kDa (Vph1p) and the 17-kDa (Vma3p) 2In this paper, Vma3p and Vma11p are used to indicate the protein products of the respective genes. The term “the 17 kDa subunit” is reserved mainly for referring to the polypeptide biochemically identified in the V-ATPase complex. V-ATPase subunits (29Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E.

Stv1p is localized to nonvacuolar membranes, possibly endosomal and/or Golgi membrane, and is not required for vacuolar membrane V-ATPase activity. Overexpression of Stv1p induces mislocalization of this protein to the vacuolar membrane and can partially complement the phenotypes associated with the loss of V-ATPase activity in Δvph1 mutant cells (29Manolson M.F.

From these observations, it has been proposed that yeast cells possess another V-type ATPase acidifying organelles (containing Stv1p) other than vacuoles and that the 100-kDa subunit isoforms are responsible for targeting of the V-type ATPases to different organelles (29Manolson M.F.

FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 147-153Google Scholar, 25Umemoto N. Yoshihisa T. Hirata R. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18447-18453Google Scholar, 30Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol.

Vma3p is a hydrophobic polypeptide chemically characterized as a proteolipid (soluble in chloroform/methanol) and is thought to constitute all or part of the proton translocating pore in V0 (5Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Google Scholar, 24Nelson H. Nelson N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 147-153Google Scholar, 25Umemoto N. Yoshihisa T. Hirata R. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18447-18453Google Scholar). Homologous subunits are found universally in V-type ATPase complexes characterized from various membrane sources, and all amino acid sequences determined for the subunits contain a conserved glutamic acid residue predicted to be critical for proton transport activity (32Nelson N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 407-414Google Scholar). VMA11 was cloned by complementation of the growth defect of a calcium sensitive mutant, cls9 (30Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24526-24532Google Scholar, 33Ohya Y. Umemoto N. Tanida I. Ohta A. Iida H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13971-13977Google Scholar). Unlike STV1, VMA11 is required for the activity and assembly of the vacuolar membrane V-ATPase complex (30Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24526-24532Google Scholar, 33Ohya Y. Umemoto N. Tanida I. Ohta A. Iida H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13971-13977Google Scholar). VMA16 was originally identified as PPA1, an open reading frame adjacent to the MAS2 gene (31Apperson M. Jensen R.E. Suda K. Witte C. Yaffe M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 574-579Google Scholar). Initial gene disruption analysis demonstrated that Vma16p is important for cell growth (31Apperson M. Jensen R.E. Suda K. Witte C. Yaffe M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 574-579Google Scholar), but the physiological function of this protein remained unclear. In this work, the function of Vma11p and Vma16p was studied by examining the cellular localization of these proteins and by characterizing phenotypes of the cells carrying mutant forms of each protein. Our results indicate that Vma11p and Vma16p are novel V0 subunits of the V-ATPase complex essential for enzyme activity. We also report here that both proteins contain a glutamic acid residue important for their function as found for Vma3p (34Noumi T. Beltrán C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1938-1942Google Scholar), and inactivating mutations of these residues influence the assembly status of the enzyme complex. Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. RHA374, LGY11, and LGY10 are VMA3::HA, VMA11:: HA, and VMA16::HA derivatives, respectively, of SF838-1D (35Rothman J.H. Stevens T.H. Cell. 1986; 47: 1041-1051Google Scholar). YRH11a and RHP110 are isogenic to YPH499 (36Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar) except Δvma11:: TRP1 and Δvma16::TRP1, respectively. RHA115 (VMA11::TRP1) was constructed by inserting a TRP1 gene fragment in the upstream region of the VMA11 in YPH499. RHA115 is Trp+ and Vma+. RHA116 (E145D), RHA117 (E145L), and RHA118 (E145Q) are vma11 mutant derivatives of RHA115. RHP1100-RHP1107 are isogenic to RHP110, except that each carries a wild type or mutant vma16 gene on a yeast low copy, centromere-based plasmid, pRS316 (36Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar).

YPD medium was buffered at pH 5.0 or 7.5 with 50 mM phosphate/succinate buffer as described previously (17Yamashiro C.T. Kane P.M. Wolczyk D.F. Preston R.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3737-3749Google Scholar). Calcium sensitivity of the cells was examined on YPD medium supplemented with 100 mM CaCl2 (33Ohya Y. Umemoto N. Tanida I. Ohta A. Iida H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13971-13977Google Scholar). Null vma11 mutants were constructed as follows. A 1.8-kb EcoRV-SpeI fragment containing the VMA11 gene was cloned into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene), creating pRHA150. pRHA150 was digested with XhoI and HindIII, blunted with Klenow, and religated to remove the ClaI and HincII sites originating from the multicloning site of pBluescript KS+. The 0.6-kb HincII-ClaI (blunt) fragment of pRHA151 was replaced with a 0.85-kb EcoRI-BglII (blunt) fragment of pJJ280 (TRP1) (37Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Google Scholar) to create Δvma11::TRP1 (pRHA163). The Δvma11 fragment in pRHA163 was isolated from the plasmid by digestion with EcoRV and SpeI and used to construct the disruption strain YRH11a by the method as described previously (38Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotide primers, atcgaagttgttttcagtctc and acatgtatctcagatatctca were synthesized based on the reported sequence of the VMA16 (PPA1) gene (31Apperson M. Jensen R.E. Suda K. Witte C. Yaffe M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 574-579Google Scholar) and used to amplify the gene fragment by polymerase chain reaction from yeast chromosomal DNA in the presence of digoxigenin-11-dUTP. A yeast genomic DNA library (18Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Google Scholar) was screened by hybridization with the digoxigenin-labeled VMA16 fragment to isolate the full-length VMA16 gene. A 2.0-kb NcoI (blunt ended)-EcoRI fragment containing the VMA16 gene was cloned into the SmaI-EcoRI site of pUC119 (39Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Google Scholar) to yield pRHP152. A 0.6-kb BamHI-EcoRV fragment within the VMA16 gene was replaced with a 0.94-kb BamHI-HincII TRP1 fragment from pJJ281 (37Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Google Scholar) to create pRHP165. The Δvma16::TRP1 fragment was liberated from the plasmid by HpaI-BglI digestion and used to disrupt the chromosomal VMA16 gene by the method as described in Ref. 38Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar. VMA3::HA gene fragment was constructed as follows. A 1.6-kb EcoRI fragment containing the VMA3 open reading frame was cloned into pBluescript KS+, and the resultant plasmid was mutagenized to introduce AatII and NheI restriction sites near the 3′ end of the VMA3 open reading frame with a mutagenic primer, ctagctagcagacgacgtcttgagtagccctggagttca (40Sayers J.R. Schmidt W. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 791-802Google Scholar). Then the AatII-NheI fragment, encoding the last four amino acids of Vma3p, was replaced with a synthetic oligonucleotide duplex coding for the last four amino acids followed by a nine amino acid HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) (41Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Google Scholar). A 1-kb AgeI-EcoRI fragment containing a part of the VMA3::HA gene fragment was cloned into a yeast integrating vector pRS306 (36Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar), digested with HindIII, and used to substitute for the chromosomal VMA3 gene by two step gene replacement (38Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis following the method of Kunkel (42Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar) was performed to epitope tag VMA11 at the extreme C terminus. The primer ttttaaacttttgactcacgcatagtcaggaacatcatatgggtattcagagcctc was used to introduce the sequence encoding the HA epitope just prior to the stop codon of VMA11. The generation of pLG36 (pRS316-VMA11::HA) was determined by the introduction of a unique NdeI site within the oligonucleotide sequence (underlined). A 2-kb KpnI-SacI fragment from pLG36 containing VMA11::HA was subcloned into pRS306 creating pLG40. The chromosomal copy of VMA11 was replaced by VMA11::HA to generate the yeast strain LGY11 by transformation of SF838-1D with linearized pLG40 (BglII) and two-step gene replacement. The sequence encoding the HA epitope was introduced into VMA16 before the stop codon by site-directed mutagenesis using the primer tggtttgagcgcttacgcatagtcaggaacatcatatgggtactgaaattcagaagc. The creation of pLG32 (pRS316-VMA16::HA) was confirmed by the presence of a unique NdeI restriction enzyme site (underlined). pLG34 was generated by subcloning a 1.9-kb SacI-KpnI fragment from pLG32 containing VMA16::HA into pRS306. The chromosomal copy of VMA16 was replaced by VMA16::HA to generate the yeast strain LGY10 by transformation with linearized pLG34 (BstUI) as described above. vma11 genes with a mutation at the glutamic acid at position 145 (Glu145) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of pRHA150. Mutagenic primers used were, accatataaccctaacacgtcagagaaaattaga (E145D), tataaccctaaaactagtgagaaaattagaat (E145L), and taccatataaccctagtacttgagagaaaattagaat (E145Q). Each primer introduces a unique restriction site (underlined) to screen for the introduced mutation. A 0.85-kb EcoRI-BglII (blunt) fragment from pJJ280 (TRP1) (37Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Google Scholar) was inserted at the SnaBI site of the resultant mutant plasmids as a marker for mutant selection. The SnaBI site is located ∼450 base pairs 5′ of the initiating ATG, and insertion of the TRP1 gene into the wild type VMA11 gene at this position did not affect the cell growth or the V-ATPase activity (data not shown). The mutant vma11 fragments were used to substitute for the chromosomal VMA11 gene in YPH499 to yield RHA116-118. vma11 mutants were selected by Trp+ phenotype, and introduction of the mutations was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of chromosomal DNA. A 3.4-kb XbaI-EcoRI fragment containing the VMA16 gene was cloned into pRS316 (36Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar) to create pRHP111. Site-directed mutagenesis of the VMA16 gene was done by two sequential polymerase chain reaction reactions with pRHP111 and overlapping forward and reverse mutagenic primers as described (40Sayers J.R. Schmidt W. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 791-802Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences of the mutant gene fragments were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The wild type and mutant vma16 plasmids (listed in Table I) were introduced into RHP110 (Δvma16::TRP1) to yield RHP1100 (pRHP111, wild type), RHP1101 (pRHP131, E108D), RHP1102 (pRHP132, E108V), RHP1103 (pRHP133, E188D), RHP1104 (pRHP134, E188V), RHP1105 (pRHP135, E108L), RHP1106 (pRHP136, E108Q), and RHP1107 (pRHP137, E188Q). Preparation of vacuolar membrane fractions and purification of the V-ATPase were previously described (3Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19236-19244Google Scholar, 5Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Google Scholar). When vacuolar membranes were prepared from strains (RHP1100-RHP1108) expressing Vma16p from pRS316 (URA3+)-based plasmids, cells were grown in YNBD (−uracil) supplemented with 0.5% casamino acids (Difco). Each vacuolar membrane fraction was assayed for the vacuolar membrane marker, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B (DPAP-B) (43Roberts C.J. Pohlig G. Rothman J.H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1363-1373Google Scholar), and a purification index, which was expressed as the ratio of the specific DPAP-B activity in the vacuolar membrane to the activity in spheroplast lysate, was determined. Vacuolar membrane fractions with a purification index of >30 (5Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Google Scholar) were used throughout this study. Protein extracts of whole cell and vacuolar membrane fractions were prepared as described by Hill and Stevens (44Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1039-1050Google Scholar). Proteolipid subunits were purified by chloroform/methanol extraction of whole cell extracts or vacuolar membranes (45Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ho M.N. Ohya Y. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 961-967Google Scholar). Crude membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared as follows. Yeast cells were spheroplasted and lysed with a Dounce homogenizer in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 M Sorbitol, 1 mM EDTA, 2 μg/ml each of antipain, aprotinin, leupeptin, chymostatin, pepstatin, and 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to remove unbroken cells and then fractionated into membrane and cytosolic fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Proteins were solubilized and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis as described in Ref. 20Bauerle C. Ho M.N. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12749-12757Google Scholar. Immunoblots were prepared and probed as described (46Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22329-22336Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies for the 100- (7B1), 69- (R70), and 42-kDa (7A2) subunits and polyclonal antisera for the 60-, 54-, 36-, and 27-kDa subunits were used under the conditions as described (46Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22329-22336Google Scholar). Affinity purified antibodies that recognize the 12CA5 epitope peptide (YPYDVPDYA) were prepared and used as described (22Graham L.A. Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25974-25977Google Scholar). Recombinant DNA manipulations were performed as described (38Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar, 47Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopy was done essentially as described (44Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1039-1050Google Scholar). Affinity purified anti-HA polyclonal serum was used at a 1:40 dilution. Vacuolar acidification in vivo was examined by quinacrine staining of the cells (25Umemoto N. Yoshihisa T. Hirata R. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18447-18453Google Scholar). V-ATPase activity (ATPase activity sensitive to 0.1 μM bafilomycin A1) of wild type and site-directed mutants was assayed at 30°C as described (5Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 25 mM Tris-Mes (pH 6.9), 5 mM MgCl2, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM ATP-2Na+, and vacuolar membrane vesicles (10-20 μg of protein). Prior to the assay of ATPase activity, the reaction mixture (without ATP) was incubated with or without 0.1 μM bafilomycin A1 for 20 min on ice, and then the reaction was started by adding ATP. Bafilomycin A1 was added as an ethanolic solution, and control activities were determined in the presence of an equivalent amount of ethanol. All samples contained 1% ethanol, and this concentration of ethanol did not inhibit the enzyme activity. V-ATPase activity of the membrane fractions from LGY11 (VMA11::HA), LGY10 (VMA16::H"

https://openalex.org/W2098403002,"We have investigated cell metabolism during apoptosis in the murine interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent cell line Bo and two derivative clones (B14 and B15) overexpressing human bcl-2a. On removal of IL-3, Bo cells underwent apoptosis within 8 h, whereas B14 and B15 cells were resistant for at least 24 h. Metabolically, Bo, B14, and B15 cells were indistinguishable from each other. All were insensitive to mitochondrial poisons, derived ATP entirely by glycolysis, and maintained similar mitochondrial membrane potentials measured by rhodamine-123 fluorescence with or without IL-3. All virtually ceased glycolysis and production of lactic acid on IL-3 withdrawal but maintained intracellular [ATP] until in Bo cultures the cells began to apoptose. B14 and B15 cells became glycolytically arrested but maintained stable ATP levels during protection from apoptosis. Depletion of intracellular ATP by uncoupling the mitochondrial ATPase with 2,4-dinitrophenol or carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone induced apoptosis in Bo cells with or without IL-3, but not in B14 or B15 cells. bcl-2-overexpressing cells were recoverable with high plating efficiency even after prolonged exposure to 2,4-dinitrophenol. We conclude that IL-3 withdrawal leads to arrest of energy metabolism in which ATP levels are maintained. In Bo cells this is followed by apoptosis, whereas in bcl-2-overexpressing cells this state is stably prolonged. ATP depletion is a strong apoptotic signal which overrides IL-3 signaling in normal cells but is ineffective in bcl-2-overexpressing cells. Prolonged metabolic arrest and resistance to ATP depletion facilitated by bcl-2 are both reversible. Persistent reversible metabolic dormancy would provide cells with a survival advantage in nonsustainable environments (e.g. hypoxia or substrate lack) and suggests a mechanism for the survival advantage displayed by cells overexpressing bcl-2. We have investigated cell metabolism during apoptosis in the murine interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent cell line Bo and two derivative clones (B14 and B15) overexpressing human bcl-2a. On removal of IL-3, Bo cells underwent apoptosis within 8 h, whereas B14 and B15 cells were resistant for at least 24 h. Metabolically, Bo, B14, and B15 cells were indistinguishable from each other. All were insensitive to mitochondrial poisons, derived ATP entirely by glycolysis, and maintained similar mitochondrial membrane potentials measured by rhodamine-123 fluorescence with or without IL-3. All virtually ceased glycolysis and production of lactic acid on IL-3 withdrawal but maintained intracellular [ATP] until in Bo cultures the cells began to apoptose. B14 and B15 cells became glycolytically arrested but maintained stable ATP levels during protection from apoptosis. Depletion of intracellular ATP by uncoupling the mitochondrial ATPase with 2,4-dinitrophenol or carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone induced apoptosis in Bo cells with or without IL-3, but not in B14 or B15 cells. bcl-2-overexpressing cells were recoverable with high plating efficiency even after prolonged exposure to 2,4-dinitrophenol. We conclude that IL-3 withdrawal leads to arrest of energy metabolism in which ATP levels are maintained. In Bo cells this is followed by apoptosis, whereas in bcl-2-overexpressing cells this state is stably prolonged. ATP depletion is a strong apoptotic signal which overrides IL-3 signaling in normal cells but is ineffective in bcl-2-overexpressing cells. Prolonged metabolic arrest and resistance to ATP depletion facilitated by bcl-2 are both reversible. Persistent reversible metabolic dormancy would provide cells with a survival advantage in nonsustainable environments (e.g. hypoxia or substrate lack) and suggests a mechanism for the survival advantage displayed by cells overexpressing bcl-2. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is thought to play a crucial role in regulating cell growth (1Raff M.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Google Scholar, 2Collins M. Rivas A.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 318: 307-309Google Scholar). Many cells, including hematopoietic cells (3Vaux D. Corey S. Adams J.M. Nature. 1988; 335: 440-442Google Scholar), are susceptible to apoptosis induced by a wide variety of agents and conditions such as serum deprivation, radiation, heat shock, cytotoxic drugs, oncogene products, or lytic viruses (4Collins M.

Apoptosis is regulated by a number of genes, in particular those of the bcl-2 family, originally identified with follicular B-cell lymphoma (10Cleary M.L. Sklar J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7439-7443Google Scholar). bcl-2a codes for a 26-kDa membrane-inserted protein that has been located in outer mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear membranes (11Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1993; 348: 334-336Google Scholar, 12Chen-levy Z. Nourse J. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 701-710Google Scholar, 13Monaghan P.

Overexpression of the membrane-inserted form, but not the truncated free form (bcl-2b), protects many cells from apoptosis induced by numerous noxious agents (4Collins M. Marvel J. Malde P. Rivas A.

Nature. 1992; 359: 554-556Google Scholar). bcl-2 has therefore been considered a facilitatory gene for malignant change. Recently, a series of bcl-2 homologs has been isolated (14Boise L.H.

Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Google Scholar) whose activity can be apoptosis-inducing or -suppressing, depending on their state of dimerization with other members of the family. Other genes may also play important accessory roles in apoptosis; for example, c-myc and p53 (16Wagner A.J. Small M.B. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2432-2440Google Scholar, 17White E. Nature. 1994; 371: 21-22Google Scholar, 18Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of bcl-2 is unknown. Although its location in mitochondrial membranes suggests it may influence mitochondrial function, and recent work suggests that mitochondria may contribute to early stages of apoptosis induction, (19Lizard G.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 53-57Google Scholar) cells depleted of mitochondrial DNA or cultured in anaerobic conditions are still protected from apoptosis by bcl-2 (22Jacobson M.D. Burne J.F. King M.P. Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Raff M.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 365-369Google Scholar, 23Newmeyer D.D. Farschon D.M. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 353-364Google Scholar, 24Jacobson M.D. Burne J.F. Raff M.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1899-1910Google Scholar). bcl-2 has also been suggested to protect cells from apoptosis by inhibiting lipid peroxidation induced by free radicals (25Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Google Scholar, 26Albrecht H. Tschopp J. Jongeneel C.V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 45-48Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that tumor cells expressing bcl-2 or mutant p53 have a survival advantage in hypoxic conditions (27Graeber T.G. Osmanian C. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Koch C.J. Lowe S.W. Giaccia A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 88-91Google Scholar), raising the question whether bcl-2 confers a survival advantage by regulating metabolism and the synthesis or use of ATP. In murine interleukin-3 (IL-3) 1The abbreviations used are: IL-3interleukin-3DNP2,4-dinitrophenolFCCPcarbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazoneMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidTUNELterminal deoxynucleotide end labeling. -dependent cells, ATP is derived entirely from glycolysis (28Garland J.M. Lymphokines. 1984; 9: 153-200Google Scholar), and apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal is preceded by drastic reductions in lactic acid production without changes in glucose transport (29Palacios R. Garland J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1208-1211Google Scholar, 30Garland J.M. Kinnaird A. Elliott K. Leukemia. 1988; 2: 476-480Google Scholar). These cells thus provide a useful model for metabolic regulation induced by oncogenes including bcl-2. We examined the possibility that in these cells bcl-2 might either regulate ATP production independently of the IL-3 signaling pathway or sustain them in a minimal but metabolically active state. We found that bcl-2 expression makes no difference to the cessation of energy metabolism normally leading to apoptosis but facilitates a prolonged metabolically dormant state from which cells recover with high efficiency. interleukin-3 2,4-dinitrophenol carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid terminal deoxynucleotide end labeling. The murine IL-3-dependent pro-B line Bo and two independent derivative clones B14 and B15 overexpressing human bcl-2 were kindly made available by Dr. Mary Collins, Institute for Cancer Research, London. Whereas Bo cells apoptose within 8 h after IL-3 withdrawal, both B14 and B15 cells arrest growth but remain viable for several days and are refractory to further damage by radiation or cytotoxic drugs (3Vaux D. Corey S. Adams J.M. Nature. 1988; 335: 440-442Google Scholar). Cells were maintained as described previously (4Collins M. Marvel J. Malde P. Rivas A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1043-1051Google Scholar) in RPMI supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 5% WEHI 3b-conditioned medium as a source of IL-3. For experimental incubations, recombinant IL-3 was used at 100 units/ml. Cells were used in the exponential phase at densities between 1 and 4 × 105 cells/ml. IL-3 was removed by centrifugation (800 rpm × 5 min) and washing three times in prewarmed RPMI/fetal bovine serum. For all experiments, washed cells were resuspended to a known density of between 1 and 5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI/fetal bovine serum. Where cells were precultured in, and returned to, medium containing N-acetylcysteine, all wash solutions also contained N-acetylcysteine. Cells were washed and recultured with and without IL-3 and/or 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) for the times specified. After washing, 104, 5 × 104 and 105 cells were plated in triplicate in 1 ml of RPMI, fetal calf serum, 0.3% agarose supplemented with WEHI 3b-conditioned medium and reincubated. Colonies were scored at 5 days. N-Acetylcysteine (neutral injectable solution Parvolax) was obtained from Evans Pharmaceuticals. DNP was from BDH Ltd. Sodium cyanide, maleic acid diethyl ether, ATP, and carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) were from Sigma. Antimycin A was from Boehringer Mannheim. Dichlorofluorescein diacetate and rhodamine-123 were from Molecular Probes Inc. For rhodamine staining, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in prewarmed Hanks' solution with 0.1 μg/ml rhodamine-123, incubated 20 min, washed once in Hanks solution, reincubated a further 20 min, and analyzed on a Becton-Dickinson FACSCAN or Coulter Elite II flow sorter. For flow cytometric analysis of DNA profiles, cells were pelleted, resuspended in DNA labeling solution (Coulter Electronics Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and analyzed on a Coulter Epics II flow cytometer. For TUNEL assays, cells were deposited on slides using a Cytospin centrifuge and fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 1% fresh paraformaldehyde. TUNEL assays (Boehringer Mannheim) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed and reincubated for the lengths of time indicated with additions as described. DNA was prepared according to Ref. 4Collins M. Marvel J. Malde P. Rivas A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1043-1051Google Scholar. Briefly, 105-106 cells were centrifuged and solubilized in 200-500 μl of ice-cold lysis solution (10 mM Tris (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1 mM EDTA). 200 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) was added and the solution incubated overnight at 37°C. Protein was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (Sigma) and DNA precipitated with 0.10 volume of 3.5 M ammonium acetate and 2.5 volumes of absolute alcohol at −30°C. Precipitated DNA was redissolved in 50-100 μl of TE (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) and incubated with 10 units/ml DNase-free RNase (Sigma) for 30 min at 37°C. Known amounts of DNA (10 and 30 μg determined using A260) were electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. All experiments were conducted with RPMI supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum dialyzed against two changes of phosphate-buffered saline and one of RPMI. Exponential cells precultured overnight (final density, 2-4 × 105 cells/ml) were washed twice in prewarmed medium, resuspended to a known density of 2-4 × 105 cells/ml, and reincubated with additions as shown. One-ml aliquots of cell suspension in quadruplicate were layered onto 300 μl of silicone oil overlaying 100 μl of 10% w/v perchloric acid, 20% w/v glycerol in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged for exactly 1 min at room temperature. The supernatant was retained for lactic acid determination while the silicone oil layer was removed, and after the addition of 5 μl of universal indicator, the underlying perchloric acid layer was neutralized by careful titration with 5 M KOH, 0.5 M MOPS, 20 mM EDTA. The resulting KClO3 precipitate was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant stored at −70°C. Ten-μl aliquots were used for measurements of ATP and ADP with the luciferase method (31Stanley P.E. Williams S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 29: 381-392Google Scholar). Lactic acid was determined in 20-50 μl of each supernatant using lactic dehydrogenase (Sigma) (32Bucher T. Czok R. Lamprecht W. Latzko E. Bergmeyer H.-V. Methods of Enzymic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Berlin1963: 253-259Google Scholar). Dichlorofluorescein diacetate staining was used to detect intracellular free radicals (33Lebel C. Ischiropoulos H. Bondy C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 227-231Google Scholar). Cells were removed directly from the culture and incubated for 30 min with 5 μM dichlorofluorescein diacetate. The cells were pelleted once, resuspended in fresh medium, and analyzed immediately on a Coulter flow cytometer. For glutathione measurement, 4.5 × 106 cells were washed rapidly in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, extracted into 10% w/v 5′-sulfosalicylic acid dihydrate (Sigma), and assayed for total glutathione by the 2-nitrothiobenzoic acid method (34Owens J. Belcher B. Biochem. J. 1965; 94: 705-711Google Scholar). Standard curves were prepared from authentic glutathione (Sigma). Bo, B14, and B15 cells all possess rapid population doubling times of 10-14 h in the presence of IL-3 (data not shown). We wished first to exclude that bcl-2 overexpression may induce mitochondrial respiration, thereby significantly increasing efficiency of ATP generation per unit of glucose metabolized. Rhodamine-123 fluorescence was employed as a marker of mitochondrial energization (35Darzynkiewiez Z. Staiano-Coico C. Malamed M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2383-2387Google Scholar). Data are shown in Fig. 1 for Bo and B15 cells. There was no difference in basal fluorescence between Bo and B15 exponential cells nor between cells deprived of IL-3 and reincubated with or without IL-3 for several hours. However, Bo, B14, and B15 cells depleted of IL-3 underwent rounding of shape and volume contraction at 30 min. Bo cells commenced to apoptose between 4 and 6 h, which coincided with a slight relative decrease in rhodamine fluorescence compared with bcl-2-expressing B15 cells (Fig. 1). This reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 1) is consistent with changes in permeability transition (21Zamzani N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Masse B. Kroemer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 53-57Google Scholar), but we were unable to demonstrate any effect of cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of mitochondrial pore opening (data not shown). Also, a significant proportion of Bo cells (5-10%) became permeable to trypan blue at about 8 h, suggesting alternatively that the dye change could be due to a general increase in cell permeability. Comparison of B14 with B15 cells showed closely similar profiles (Fig. 2). We noted, however, that all cells, including Bo, kept undisturbed by further addition of materials or washing showed a similar progressive decrease in rhodamine-123 retention over 6 h, but this was still unaffected by IL-3. Confocal and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that rhodamine-123 was located in the cytoplasmic region surrounding the nucleus in Bo, B14, and B15 cells, consistent with mitochondrial localization, there being no significant differences in whether or not IL-3 was present (data not shown). To confirm that bcl-2 protection did not involve mitochondrial activation, we incubated cells with cyanide (500 μM-50 mM) or antimycin A (50 ng/ml-5 μg/ml); cyanide inhibits cytochrome oxidase, antimycin A electron flow through the cytochrome bc1 complex. Neither induced nor accelerated apoptosis after 24 h, with or without IL-3, as reported for other IL-3-dependent cells (30 and data not shown), suggesting that induction of oxidative phosphorylation was not involved in the regulation of apoptosis by bcl-2.Fig. 2Rhodamine-123 fluorescence profiles comparing B14 with B15.

Both B14 and B15 (and Bo, data not shown) showed progressive reduction of fluorescence with time which was unaffected by IL-3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 3 shows lactic acid production from two representative complete experiments using Bo and B15 cells with measurements taken at different time intervals. Two h after IL-3 withdrawal from both Bo and B15 cultures, lactate output declined to approximately 50% of controls supplemented with IL-3 and stopped almost completely at about 8 h. At 8 h, most Bo cells were visibly apoptosing, whereas B15 cells maintained almost full viability over the subsequent 24 h. However, no further production of lactic acid occurred from B15 cells after 8 h, indicating that glycolytic flux in these cells was arrested. Identical results were obtained from B14 cells (Table I). Since Bo, B14, and B15 cells displayed identical declines in glycolytic flux on IL-3 withdrawal, and B14 and B15 cells established prolonged glycolytic arrest, bcl-2 could not function by generating ATP through glycolysis in the absence of IL-3. Since we also excluded generation of ATP by mitochondrial respiration, we analyzed whether bcl-2 expression might activate or sustain ATP-consuming pathways, for example “housekeeping” or repair functions. Alternatively, enhanced survival could be due to decreased consumption of ATP allowing cellular [ATP] to be maintained. We therefore measured changes in cellular [ATP].Table IGlycolytic arrest in B14 and B15 cells and comparison of effects of DNP and FCCP on glycolytic fluxTimeLactic acid in supernatant from 2 × 105 cells/ml+IL-3−IL-3+IL-3 + DNP−IL-3 + DNP+IL-3 + FCCP−IL-3 + FCCPhmMB14 cells20.550.30.741.091.31.340.90.391.41.821.961.30.52.22.52.92.883.10.683.84.65.55227.30.675.968.88B15 cells20.530.280.61.11.321.3240.860.351.091.831.491.4661.30.431.82.482.22.1283.070.563.273.364.444.28226.50.65.965.657.86.8 Open table in a new tab Data from seven individual experiments using B15 cells are summarized in Table II, each data point being from least three experiments. Values are given as percentages of initial values (t = 0) since (i) cells in IL-3 maintained proliferation, whereas those without IL-3 ceased, and (ii) the fractional increase in numbers after short periods of time could not be determined accurately. The basal ATP content of the cells was similar in both Bo and B15 cells (Table II) and comparable to values determined previously in other IL-3-dependent cells (30Garland J.M. Kinnaird A. Elliott K. Leukemia. 1988; 2: 476-480Google Scholar). In IL-3-supplemented Bo and B15 cells [ATP] continued to rise commensurate with continued growth and increased cell number. In IL-3-starved Bo and B15 cells, intracellular [ATP] followed early rises similar to that observed in IL-3-supplemented cells until Bo cells commenced to apoptose (at about 6 h). After this point ATP levels in Bo cells fell dramatically, which was attributable to general cell leakiness and apoptotic fragmentation. However, in IL-3-starved B15 cells, cellular ATP content plateaued after 8 h and remained almost unaltered over the next 20 h. bcl-2 protection therefore does not appear to induce, activate, or maintain ATP-depleting mechanisms for cell survival, but rather maintains [ATP]. The early rise in [ATP] during IL-3 withdrawal while lactic acid production (and therefore glycolysis) declines, and its subsequent plateauing in B15 cells, suggest also that IL-3 signaling regulates ATP demand, not its generation. Thus glycolytic down-regulation appears to follow reduction in ATP demand when IL-3 is withdrawn and [ATP] is maintained. Later, when ATP demand is abrogated altogether, glycolysis ceases. In preventing apoptosis, bcl-2 thus enables cells to establish a stable state of glycolytic and therefore energy arrest.Table IIIntracellular ATP content of Bo and B15 cells after incubation in the presence and absence of IL-3 and DNPATP content of cell as a percentage of that at time zero2 h4 h6 h8 h22 h%Bo174 ± 16202 ± 13197 ± 27229 ± 1056 ± 29Bo + IL-3183 ± 12213 ± 4226 ± 36243 ± 52623 ± 183Bo + DNP125 ± 5143 ± 10102 ± 1294 ± 35NDBo + IL-3 + DNP141 ± 25146 ± 6155 ± 35117 ± 36NDB15184 ± 24196 ± 12226 ± 13289 ± 36211 ± 17B15 + IL-3188 ± 31220 ± 18237 ± 11323 ± 18629 ± 129B15 + DNP122 ± 15105 ± 21237 ± 39187 ± 361 ± 9B15 + IL-3 + DNP133 ± 15108 ± 6239 ± 18157 ± 7104 ± 15 Open table in a new tab Cellular ADP content was also determined in parallel with ATP, but the lower intracellular concentration of this nucleotide made its accurate determination difficult. However, we obtained no evidence for consistent changes in ATP:ADP ratios accompanying IL-3 stimulation or bcl-2 overexpression. One explanation for the extended survival of bcl-2-protected cells might be that it inhibits ATP-consuming metabolic pathways whose unbalanced activity signals apoptosis but whose impact on gross [ATP] is too small to be measurable. If so, then imposition of an ATP-depleting reaction might be expected to accelerate apoptosis and overcome the protective effects of bcl-2. In the absence of oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial uncouplers can still lower intracellular ATP through reversal of the mitochondrial F0-F1-ATPase, thereby causing hydrolysis of glycolytically derived ATP. Such ATP depletion would also lead to up-regulation of glycolytic flux through feedback regulation and therefore produce an increase in output of lactic acid. We therefore induced such a state by adding mitochondrial uncouplers: DNP, which has been used in many studies to specifically lower intracellular ATP (e.g. 36), or FCCP, a potent uncoupler of the mitochondrial F0-F1-ATPase (37Freeman K. Yatscoff R.W. Mason J.R. Patel H.V. Buckle M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 134: 215-222Google Scholar). In the presence of IL-3, DNP lowered ATP by an average of 40% after 2 h compared with controls in both Bo and B15 cell lines (Table II) and also raised ADP (data not shown). DNP also increased production of lactic acid by up to nearly 4-fold with almost identical kinetics in both lines (Fig. 3), confirming that uncoupling the mitochondrial ATPase stimulated glycolytic flux as predicted. Almost identical results were obtained using a different uncoupler, FCCP. Comparing the effects of FCCP with DNP showed that FCCP was more effective in early uncoupling (Table I) but that both lines responded almost identically to both uncouplers and produced almost identical levels of lactate on a per cell basis. In IL-3-starved Bo cells, enhanced lactic acid production stopped when cells apoptosed. DNP and FCCP induced or accelerated apoptosis in Bo cells even in the presence of IL-3. Such cells displayed earlier typical membrane blebbing and nuclear/DNA fragmentation shown by microscopy, TUNEL assays (Fig. 4), and DNA ladder gels (Fig. 5, B, D, F, and H). TUNEL assays detect in situ fragmented DNA through fluorescent end labeling of fragmented DNA in intact nuclei. DNP increased the proportion of TUNEL-positive cells from 10% in controls incubated without IL-3 for 6 h to nearly 50% (Fig. 4). In contrast, both B14 and B15 exhibited identical resistance to apoptosis with DNP and FCCP. Whereas DNP decreased the ATP content in B15 cells to an extent similar to that seen in Bo cells (Table II) they retained increased viability with significantly less DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5, C, E, and G), even in the absence of IL-3. Both B14 and B15 cultures continued to generate increased lactic acid throughout the 24-h period (Fig. 3 and Table I); but even after 24-h exposure to DNP in the absence of IL-3, DNA was still significantly intact compared to with cells (Fig. 5, I).Fig. 5Induction of apoptotic DNA ladders by DNP.

Whereas Bo cells from cultures preincubated for 24 h in DNP but without IL-3 generated no colonies at 5 days, B15 cultures similarly treated generated 40% of colonies of control cultures. Similarly, whereas almost no Bo cells survived DNP treatment in the presence of IL-3, B15 cells maintained nearly 70% of the control clonogenic cells. Colonies from DNP-treated B15 cultures were also the same size as controls, showing that any lag phase in recovery must have been very short. Thus our results show that although lowering ATP, even by a relatively modest amount, generates a strong apoptotic signal in Bo cells, it does not generate this signal in bcl-2-transfected cells, suggesting that focal ATP depletion may initiate apoptosis in Bo cells and that bcl-2 inhibits this step. Taken together, our results also imply that glucose and lactate transport and the glycolytic pathway are not disrupted by IL-3 withdrawal or uncouplers; furthermore, glycolysis is not operating at maximum capacity during growth stimulated by IL-3. Together with the data on maintenance of [ATP], it appears that bcl-2 does not act globally on energy metabolism, and bcl-2-overexpressing cells need neither generate nor use ATP to prolong their survival.Table IIISurvival of clonogenic cells in the presence of DNPColonies/104 input cells+IL-3−IL-3+IL-3 + DNP−IL-3 + DNPBo2,524 ± 20063 ± 23<100B15888 ± 84515 ± 36271 ± 67151 ± 71 Open table in a new tab If cells become quiescent, this might be reflected in decreased production of free radicals. Also, previous reports suggest that bcl-2 might exert its protective effect against apoptosis by decreasing free radical damage (25Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Google Scholar, 26Albrecht H. Tschopp J. Jongeneel C.V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 45-48Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 6 suggest that this is unlikely since cells exposed to the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine showed no protection from apoptosis. Thus, at concentrations above 1 mM, N-acetylcysteine accelerated apoptosis in IL-3-starved Bo cells judged both by microscopic examination and by an increase in DNA laddering. Pregrowing cultures in N-acetylcysteine for 24 or 48 h did not affect this response (data not shown). However, bcl-2 cells were resistant to N-acetylcysteine-induced apoptosis. Using dichlorofluorescein diacetate, which detects principally hydrogen peroxide but other reactive oxygen species (33Lebel C. Ischiropoulos H. Bondy C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 227-231Google Scholar), a small but significant signal was generated in IL-3-supplemented cells but not in IL-3 starved cells during the first 6 h. Reactive oxygen species production was at least partly dependent on reduced glutathione levels since maleic acid diethyl ether, an inhibitor of glutathione S-transferase (39Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Google Scholar), depleted reduced glutathione by over 90% while significantly increasing reactive oxygen species (data not shown). However, maleic acid diethyl ether did not accelerate progression of apoptosis. We therefore found that both Bo and B15 cells could produce free radicals equally well, but these did not appear to play a role in apoptosis induction in these cells. In Bo cells, apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal is preceded by rapid rounding of cells and decline in lactic acid production. However, this is not accompanied initially by intracellular ATP depletion. This suggests that removing IL-3 reduces the demand for ATP which in turn leads to a reduction in glycolytic flux and therefore lactate production. The constraint on glycolysis imposed by reduced ATP demand can, however, be reversed by activating the mitochondrial F0F1-ATPase with uncoupler. This reduces cellular ATP levels, stimulates glycolytic flux (probably regulated at the level of phosphofructokinase), and also accelerates apoptosis. IL-3 withdrawal therefore cannot directly affect glucose or lactate transport or enzymes regulating glycolysis; indeed, these cannot be saturated during normal growth as shown by the significant and immediate up-regulation of lactate production by ATP depletion. We also found no evidence that metabolic down-regulation induced by IL-3 withdrawal increases intracellular free radical concentrations; antioxidants in fact accelerated apoptosis. This would, however, be consistent with the recent observation that dATP or dADP may regulate apoptosis (40Zamzani N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. deCaudin D. Macho A. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Petit P.X. Mignotte B. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 367-377Google Scholar); antioxidants would be expected to increase reduced glutathione and thereby increase dNTPs via ribonucleotide reductase. We have also found that depletion of reduced glutathione inhibits some of the early stages of apoptosis in these cells. 2J. M. Garland, K. Sondergaard, and J. Jolly, submitted for publication. Surprisingly, we have found that in B14 and B15 cells overexpressing bcl-2, none of the preapoptotic characteristics of parental Bo cells undergoing apoptosis (cell rounding, maintenance of [ATP], down-regulation, and cessation of glycolysis) is altered. We obtained no evidence that bcl-2 initiates mitochondrial respiration nor that IL-3 signaling or its deprivation significantly affects mitochondrial membrane potential as proposed for a role in apoptosis induction (40Zamzani N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. deCaudin D. Macho A. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Petit P.X. Mignotte B. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 367-377Google Scholar). However, bcl-2-overexpressing cells are resistant to prolonged ATP depletion induced by mitochondrial uncouplers even in the absence of IL-3; although uncoupler produces identical sustained and increased glycolytic flux, apoptosis is still inhibited, and such cells can recover with high efficiency as revealed by clonal assays. B14 and B15 cells maintained in the absence of IL-3 therefore appear to have no requirement for ATP generation nor for significant ATP usage and appear to survive in an extended energetically arrested state. This is the first study to show that prevention of apoptosis by bcl-2 facilitates a stable state of prolonged metabolic arrest in previously rapidly proliferating cells (cycle time approximately 11 h) within hours of the removal of growth factor stimulus (IL-3). The mechanism closely coupling IL-3 signaling to glycolysis is unknown. Prolonged and stable inertness may generate resistance to many different forms of stress (4Collins M. Marvel J. Malde P. Rivas A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1043-1051Google Scholar, 5Oliver F.J. Marvel J. Collins M.K. Lopez-Rivas A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 126-132Google Scholar, 6Zhong L.T. Sarafian T.

Nature. 1992; 359: 554-556Google Scholar) and explain the known survival advantage of tumor cells protected by bcl-2, particularly in hypoxic environments (27Graeber T.G. Osmanian C. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Koch C.J. Lowe S.W. Giaccia A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 88-91Google Scholar). In solid tumors, vasculature is disorganized and creates hydrostasis (41Jain R.K.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1987; 6: 559-593Google Scholar). This in turn leads to hypoxia and reduction in nutrient flows as well as inhibiting diffusion of cytotoxic drugs. Cells in such conditions are likely to be severely stressed. Possibly both IL-3 removal and ATP depletion could create a stress response in the cells used here, regulating cascades involving stress-activated kinases that are activated by diverse stresses such as heat shock, arsenite, and hyperosmotic stress (44Lavoie N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Google Scholar, 45Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zemanillo D. Hunt T. Nebrada A.R.

Bose R. Hua Lin X. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyrakis J.M. Halmovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Google Scholar). However, taken together, our results with these cells are more consistent with a model in which apoptosis is dynamically inhibited by IL-3 signaling and related to an ATP-consuming inhibitory pathway, which, when switched off (as in IL-3 withdrawal), induces apoptosis. DNP mimics IL-3 withdrawal by making ATP unavailable locally to sustain this inhibitory pathway, whereas bcl-2 facilitates prolongation of an ATP-independent state wherein cellular [ATP] is maintained. Inhibition of apoptosis in B15 cells during ATP depletion therefore suggests that bcl-2 targets the apoptosis initiator. Tumor cells similarly maintained by bcl-2 in a stable metabolically dormant state would also be able to survive under adverse conditions but would readily revive when environments improved or when the cells became disseminated. Metabolic quiescence could therefore explain the survival advantage of tumor cells and how some metastatic deposits can remain dormant for prolonged periods of time. Although our cells are not directly comparable to those in solid tumors, and these findings may not be applicable to other cell types, we have shown that a mechanism does exist, facilitated by bcl-2, for significantly increasing survival via extending metabolic arrest.

In Escherichia coli this enzyme plays a pivotal role in the uptake of long chain fatty acids (C12-C18) and in the regulation of the global transcriptional regulator FadR. The E. coli fatty acyl-CoA synthetase has remarkable amino acid similarities and identities to the family of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic fatty acyl-CoA synthetases, indicating a common ancestry. Most notable in this regard is a 25-amino acid consensus sequence, DGWLHTGDIGXWXPXGXLKIIDRKK, common to all fatty acyl-CoA synthetases for which sequence information is available. Within this consensus are 8 invariant and 13 highly conserved amino acid residues in the 12 fatty acyl-CoA synthetases compared. We propose that this sequence represents the fatty acyl-CoA synthetase signature motif (FACS signature motif). This region of fatty acyl-CoA synthetase from E. coli, 431NGWLHTGDIAVMDEEGFLRIVDRKK455, contains 17 amino acid residues that are either identical or highly conserved to the FACS signature motif.

Fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (fatty acid:CoA ligase, AMP-forming; EC 6.2.1.3) plays a central role in intermediary metabolism by catalyzing the formation of fatty acyl-CoA from fatty acid, ATP, and CoA. Fatty acyl-CoAs represent bioactive compounds that are involved in protein transport (1Glick B.S. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1987; 326: 309-312Google Scholar, 2Pfanner N. Orci L. Glick B.S. Amherdt M.

Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1210: 123-145Google Scholar) in addition to serving as substrates for β-oxidation and phospholipid biosynthesis. Given the multiple roles of fatty acyl-CoA, it is clear that fatty acyl-CoA synthetase occupies a pivotal role in cellular homeostasis, particularly in lipid metabolism. This enzyme catalyzes the formation of fatty acyl-CoA by a two-step process that proceeds through the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate (10Groot P.H.E. Scholte H.R. Hulsmann W.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1976; 14: 75-126Google Scholar). A fatty acyl-adenylate intermediate is formed during the first step of the reaction with the corresponding release of pyrophosphate. The second step of the reaction requires CoA for the enzymatic conversion of the fatty acyl-adenylate to fatty acyl-CoA with the concomitant release of AMP. Our interests in fatty acyl-CoA synthetase stem from its role in the transport of exogenous long chain fatty acids (C12-C18) and in the regulation of the transcription factor FadR in the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. This enzyme activates exogenous long chain fatty acids to CoA thioesters concomitant with transport (i.e. vectorial esterification). As a component of the transport apparatus, fatty acyl-CoA synthetase may partition into the inner membrane and interact with a postulated fatty acid/H+ cotransporter (11Mangroo D. Gerber G.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 51-56Google Scholar, 12Kameda K. Biochem. Int. 1986; 13: 343-350Google Scholar, 13Kameda K. Suzuki L.K. Imai Y. Biochem. Int. 1987; 14: 227-234Google Scholar). The net result of long chain fatty acid transport is a predicted increase in intracellular pools of long chain acyl-CoA, which in turn control the activity of the global transcription factor FadR. When long chain fatty acyl-CoAs are bound to FadR, there is transcriptional derepression of the genes involved in fatty acid transport, activation and degradation, and transcriptional inactivation of at least two genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis (8DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Google Scholar, 9Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1210: 123-145Google Scholar). 1C. C. DiRusso, unpublished observations. In this regard, fatty acyl-CoA synthetase plays a central role in maintaining the appropriate levels of long chain fatty acyl-CoA within the cell and thus the transcriptional activities of genes involved in fatty acid degradation and biosynthesis. Exogenous long chain fatty acids represent an important class of hydrophobic compounds that can serve as a sole carbon and energy source to support the growth of E. coli. The acquisition of these compounds prior to β-oxidation occurs by a highly specific process that minimally requires the outer membrane protein FadL and fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (9Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1210: 123-145Google Scholar, 14Overath P. Pauli G. Schairer H.U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 559-574Google Scholar, 15Nunn W.D. Simons R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Acta. 1990; 1046: 97-105Google Scholar). FadL represents a bona fide membrane-bound long chain fatty acid transport protein that we propose contains a specific hydrophobic channel for transport that becomes accessible upon ligand binding (9Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1210: 123-145Google Scholar, 16Black P.N. Said B. Ghosn C.R. Beach J.V. Nunn W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1412-1419Google Scholar, 17Black P.N. Biochim.

The process of long chain fatty acid transport responds to the energized state of the membrane and to the presence of the periplasmic protein Tsp (22Azizan A. Black P.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6653-6662Google Scholar). As noted above, exogenous long chain fatty acids are activated by fatty acyl-CoA synthetase concomitant with transport. The notion that the synthetase is a component of a fatty acid transport apparatus is in agreement with recent data showing that the transport and activation of exogenous long chain fatty acids in mouse adipocytes occurs via a fatty acid transport protein and associated fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (23Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Google Scholar). The E. coli fatty acyl-CoA synthetase structural gene (fadD) has been cloned and sequenced and shown to encode a protein of 561 amino acid residues (26Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25513-25520Google Scholar, 27Fulda M. Heinz E. Wolter F.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 241-249Google Scholar). This enzyme shares amino acid sequence similarities to other fatty acyl-CoA synthetases and more broadly the family of adenylate-forming enzymes (26Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25513-25520Google Scholar–28Dieckmann R. Lee Y.-O. vanLiempt H. vonDohren H. Kleinkauf H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 212-216Google Scholar). The placement of this enzyme in the family of adenylate-forming enzymes is based on amino acid similarities within a proposed AMP/ATP binding domain (25Kameda K. Suzuki L.K. Imai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 840: 29-36Google Scholar). Of particular relevance to the present work was the identification of a second conserved segment that appears to be restricted to the family of fatty acyl-CoA synthetases (26Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25513-25520Google Scholar). Within this latter region is a highly conserved 25-amino acid residue segment that we propose specifies a signature motif common to the family of fatty acyl-CoA synthetases. A series of site-directed alanine substitutions within the fadD gene corresponding to this signature motif were constructed and analyzed to provide information regarding the role of this region to the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Our present data confirmed the prediction that this region of the enzyme was essential for activity. Three distinct classes of mutations were identified on the basis of growth characteristics of a fadD strain harboring these alleles on a low copy plasmid, fatty acyl-CoA synthetase profiles using oleate and decanoate as substrates, and studies using purified mutant forms of the enzyme: 1) those that resulted in either wild-type or nearly wild-type fatty acyl-CoA synthetase activity profiles; 2) those that had little or no enzyme activity; and 3) those that resulted in altered fatty acid chain length specificity. Within this latter group, seven mutant fadD alleles have been generated that have altered activity with fatty acids of differing chain lengths when compared with the wild type. On the basis of the data presented in this work, we propose that this signature motif within fatty acyl-CoA synthetase functions in part to promote fatty acid chain length specificity and may compose part of the fatty acid binding site.

Small scale plasmid isolation was achieved by using alkaline lysis (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1987Google Scholar) or by using QiaPrep columns as specified by the vendor (Qiagen). Single-stranded phagemid DNA and plasmid DNA were isolated from the different mutants and sequenced using the chain termination method of Sanger et al. (34Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) using [α-35S]dATP and Sequenase (version 2.0; U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Synthetic oligonucleotides (17- and 21-mer) complementary to various regions of the fadD gene were used as primers (26Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25513-25520Google Scholar). Site-directed mutations in the fadD gene were generated using the Altered Sites™ mutagenesis system of Promega. The EcoRI-HinDIII fragment from pN324 (26Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25513-25520Google Scholar) was gel-purified and ligated into the phagemid pSELECT-1™ to generate pN351. This phagemid contained the entire coding sequences of the fadD and fadR genes in opposite orientations. fadR was included in these constructs to prevent toxicity of fadD expression in this high copy plasmid. Phosphorylated mutagenic oligonucleotides harboring the required mutation (1-2 pmol; see Table I) and the ampicillin repair oligonucleotide (0.25 pmol) were annealed to single-stranded pN351 phagemid DNA (100-250 ng) in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl by heating at 70°C for 5 min followed by slowly cooling to room temperature. Following annealing, the mutagenic oligonucleotides were extended with T4 DNA polymerase (10 units) and ligated with T4 DNA ligase (2 units) in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM ATP, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mM dNTPs (dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP). The double-stranded DNA was transformed into a repair-defective strain of E. coli (BMH 71-18) using established methods. The pool of transformed cells was grown overnight in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin followed by phagemid DNA isolation. Phagemid DNA pools were transformed into strain JM109 with selection on LB plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Phagemid DNA was isolated from individual colonies as recommended by Promega and sequenced using fadD-specific or T7 promoter-specific oligonucleotides to confirm the mutation. Once the mutation was confirmed, BamHI fragments containing the different fadD alleles mutation were gel-purified and ligated into pACYC177. These final plasmid constructions are listed in Table I, and upon transformation into the appropriate host strains were analyzed as detailed below. An EcoRI site was generated at the +1 site of translation of the E. coli fatty acyl-CoA synthetase in the phagemid pN351 to generate pN3571. The EcoRI-HinDIII fragment from pN3571 containing the coding region of the fadD gene was gel-purified and ligated into pRSET-B (Invitrogen) to generate pN3576. The expression plasmid pN3576 contains six histidine residues and an enterokinase cleavage site preceding the coding sequence of the fadD gene. Expression of His-tagged fatty acyl-CoA synthetase is driven off a T7 RNA polymerase responsive promoter. Expression plasmids containing specific fadD mutations were generated by ligating gel-purified SalI-HinDIII fragments from the phagemid constructs listed in Table I into pN3576 digested with SalI and HinDIII. The final designations of the expression plasmids are listed in Table II. The plasmids noted in Table II were transformed into strain BL21 (λDE3)(pLysS), and wild-type or mutant forms of the enzyme were overexpressed following induction of midlogarithmic grown cultures in either LB or minimal medium E supplemented with glucose with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 90 min (31Studier W.F. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Google Scholar). Following induction, cells were harvested and prepared as described below for enzyme purification or resuspended in SDS sample buffer and boiled, and proteins were resolved on a 9 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel using the Laemmli buffer system (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Cells that were grown in minimal media were treated with rifampicin for the last 60-min period of induction as described previously (24Kameda K. Nunn W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5702-5707Google Scholar) and labeled with [35S]methionine. In this case, samples were prepared as described above, and following electrophoresis, the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography for 2-24 h. The bacterial strain BL21 (λDE3)/pLysS containing the different expression plasmids listed in Table II were grown to midlog phase (6 × 108 cells/ml) in 30-50-ml cultures of LB containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Following induction of T7 RNA polymerase with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, cells were harvested, washed with minimal medium E, resuspended in 3-5 ml of 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl (buffer A), and sonicated on ice using 3 × 30-s pulses (200 watts). The cell extract was clarified by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm in a TLS-50 rotor using a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. Four hundred microliters of a 50% slurry of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) was added per 3-5-ml cell extract that had been previously equilibrated with buffer A. The cell extract-Ni2+-NTA-agarose slurry was incubated for 2-12 h at 4°C with end-over-end rotation and finally applied to a 0.5-cm (inner diameter) column. The column was washed with 30 ml of buffer A; 30 ml of 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol (buffer B) containing 50 mM imidazole; and 5 ml of buffer B containing 100 mM imidazole. The His-tagged enzyme was eluted from the column using a imidazole step gradient (750 μl of 150 mM, 200 mM, 250 mM, 300 mM, 400 mM, 500 mM, and 600 mM imidazole in buffer B). Purification was monitored on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using the Laemmli buffer system (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The His-tagged fatty acyl-CoA synthetase generally eluted between 200 and 300 mM imidazole from the Ni2+-NTA column and was greater than 95% pure. The purified His-tagged enzyme was dialyzed against buffer B, ATP was added to a final concentration of 50 mM, and the sample was frozen at −80°C in 100-500-μl aliquots. Fatty acyl-CoA synthetase activity was stable in the frozen enzyme over a period of at least 4 months. The mutant forms of the E. coli fatty acyl-CoA synthetase were purified using the same system with identical or similar elution profiles from the Ni2+-NTA-agarose column. Bacteria (wild-type and fadD strains containing the collection of fadD+ and fadD clones) were grown to midlog phase (6 × 108 cells/ml) in TB or TB supplemented with 5 mM oleate and 0.5% Brij 58 (TBO) and with antibiotics as required. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with medium E, resuspended to a density of 1.2 × 109 cells/ml in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and lysed by three cycles of sonication at 0°C. Fatty acyl-CoA synthetase activities were determined in sonicated cell extracts or using the purified wild-type or mutant hexamic histidine-tagged enzymes as described by Kameda and Nunn (24Kameda K. Nunn W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5702-5707Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mM ATP, 8 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaF, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μM [3H]oleate, [3H]myristate or [14C]decanoate, 0.5 mM coenzyme A, and cell extract in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The reactions were initiated with the addition of coenzyme A, incubated at 35°C for 10 min, and terminated by the addition of 2.5 ml of isopropyl alcohol, n-heptane, 1 M H2SO4 (40:10:1). The radioactive fatty acid was removed by organic extraction using n-heptane. Fatty acyl-CoA formed during the reaction remained in the aqueous fraction and was quantified by scintillation counting. Protein concentrations in the enzyme extracts and purified enzyme samples were determined using the Bradford assay and bovine serum albumin as a standard (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). The values presented represent the average from at least three independent experiments. All experiments were analyzed using analysis of variance (StatView; Abacus Concepts, Inc.) Fatty acid binding capacity of the wild-type and mutant forms of fatty acyl-CoA synthetase were determined using Lipidex (for C18:1) or LH-20 (C10:0) as described previously (17Black P.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1046: 97-105Google Scholar). For oleic acid binding, substrate concentration was varied from 10 nM to 2.5 μM while the purified enzyme concentration was held at 0.2 mg/ml in 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Samples were incubated for 20 min at 37°C, cooled to 0°C in a salt-ice bath for 5 min, centrifuged (30 s at 3,000 rpm) through Lipidex preequilibrated with buffer, and held at 0°C. The amount of protein-bound fatty acid in the eluate was determined by scintillation counting. For decanoic acid binding, the substrate concentration was varied from 50 nM to 50 μM while the purified enzyme concentration was held at at 0.2 mg/ml. Samples were treated as above, but they were passed through LH-20 instead of Lipidex. The amount of protein-bound fatty acid in the eluate was determined by scintillation counting. Background counts from samples containing no protein were subtracted from those in the eluates containing the protein samples. The data were converted into nmol of fatty acid bound/mg of purified protein. All of the data presented represent the average from at least three independent experiments. [3H]Oleic acid, [3H]myristate, [35S]methionine, and [α-35S]dATP were purchased from DuPont NEN. [14C]decanoic acid was purchased from Sigma. Enzymes for DNA sequencing (Sequenase) were obtained from U.S. Biochemical Corp., and enzymes for routine DNA manipulations were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., Pharmacia, U.S. Biochemical Corp., or New England Biolabs. Chemicals for the synthesis of fadD-specific oligonucleotides and the mutagenic oligonucleotides were purchased from ABN/Biogenex or Pharmacia. Antibiotics and other supplements for bacterial growth were obtained from Difco and Sigma. All other chemicals were obtained from standard suppliers and were of reagent grade. In our previous work we identified two regions within the E. coli fatty acyl-CoA synthetase that were similar to other adenylate-forming enzymes (24Kameda K. Nunn W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5702-5707Google Scholar). The first region, corresponding to amino acids 200-273 within the E. coli enzyme, contains a putative AMP binding site. On the basis of this highly conserved sequence common to all adenylate-forming enzymes, the E. coli fatty acyl-CoA synthetase has been placed into the superfamily of AMP-binding proteins (27Fulda M. Heinz E. Wolter F.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 241-249Google Scholar). This region contains a sequence that is similar to ATP-binding P-loops and may represent part of the ATP binding pocket within fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (37Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1165-1174Google Scholar, 38Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Google Scholar). The second region that we noted having similarity to other adenylate-forming enzymes corresponds to amino acid residues 353-455 of the bacterial enzyme. Using BioSCAN, we identified a highly conserved 25-amino acid residue segment within this second region that is common to all fatty acyl-CoA synthetases. This segment within the bacterial enzyme, 431NGWLHTGIAVMDEEGFLRIVDRKK455, contains amino acid residues that are 84% identical or highly conserved to other fatty acyl-CoA synthetases currently within the data base (Fig. 1). This finding has led us to propose that the 25-amino acid residue consensus sequence, DGWLHTGDIGXWXPXGXLKIIDRKK, is a signature motif common to the family of fatty acyl-CoA synthetases specifically (FACS signature motif). In addition to the fatty acyl-CoA synthetases, the more distantly related enzymes, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.12) and Photinus-luciferin 4-monooxygenase (EC 1.13.12.7"

Species- and sex-specific bouts of anisogamous gamete release occurred synchronously and predictably on a given morning, with closely related species spawning at different times. Algal sexual reproduction was seasonal, but, unlike the mass-spawning behavior of other sessile marine organisms, showed no lunar or tidal cycling. The discovery of mass-spawning behavior by these algae has important implications for future studies of the reproductive ecology and speciation of a vital, yet poorly understood, component of the coral reef community."
https://openalex.org/W2048670619,"To delineate the biochemical mechanism by which increased availability of GlcN impairs insulin action on skeletal muscle glucose uptake, we replenished the uridine pool during GlcN administration. Co-infusion of uridine with GlcN prevented the GlcN-induced fall in skeletal muscle UDP-glucose levels (24.9 ± 5.3 versus 10.1 ± 2.9 nmol/g; p < 0.01) and further increased the skeletal muscle UDP-GlcNAc levels (198.4 ± 26.3 versus 96.0 ± 8.4 nmol/g; p < 0.01). Greater reductions in the rates of glucose infusion (∼53%), glucose uptake (∼43%), and glycogen synthesis (∼60%) were observed with the addition of uridine. Similarly, the infusion of uridine alone markedly increased the skeletal muscle levels of both UDP-glucose (55.2 ± 14.2 versus 17.8 ± 6.1 nmol/g; p < 0.01) and UDP-GlcNAc (86.8 ± 8.8 versus 35.9 ± 8.4 nmol/g; p < 0.05) and induced marked insulin resistance. The decrease in insulin action on peripheral glucose uptake was highly correlated with the increase in skeletal muscle UDP-GlcNAc levels. Finally, immunoisolation of GLUT4-containing vesicles revealed that the rate of labeled GlcN incorporation was ∼100-fold greater following GlcN compared with saline infusions (p < 0.01). We suggest that the marked reduction in insulin action induced by GlcN and uridine is mediated by increased accumulation of muscle UDP-N-acetylhexosamines, perhaps via altered glycosylation of protein(s) in GLUT4-containing vesicles.

INTRODUCTIONA decrease in the ability of insulin to stimulate the uptake of glucose in skeletal muscle is a major feature of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) 1The abbreviations used are: NIDDMnon-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitusHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyBSAbovine serum albuminPBSphosphate-buffered saline. (1DeFronzo R.A. Bonadonna R.C. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 318-368Google Scholar). Recent evidence obtained by 31P NMR spectroscopy of skeletal muscle glucose 6-phosphate (2Rothman D.L. Shulman R.G. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1069-1075Google Scholar) and by modeling of forearm glucose transport and uptake (3Bonadonna R.C. Del Prato S. Saccomani M.P. Bonora E. Gulli G. Ferrannini E. Bier D. Cobelli C. DeFronzo R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 486-494Google Scholar) has revealed that this defect in insulin action in subjects with NIDDM is due to decreased muscle glucose transport/phosphorylation. Glucose transport in skeletal muscle occurs by facilitated diffusion using the insulin-regulated type of glucose transporter, GLUT4 (4James D.E. Strube M. Mueckler M. Nature. 1989; 338: 83-87Google Scholar, 5Fukumoto H. Kayano T. Buse J.B. Edwards Y. Pilch P.F. Bell G.I. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7776-7779Google Scholar, 6Charron M.J. Brosius F.C.

Commun. 1990; 172: 728-736Google Scholar). Since skeletal muscle GLUT4 gene expression is similar in subjects with NIDDM and nondiabetic controls (8Garvey W.T. Maianu L. Zhu J.-H. Hancock J. Golichowski A. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1773-1785Google Scholar, 9Yki-Jarvinen H. Vuorinen-Markkola H. Koranyi L. Bourey R. Tordjman K. Mueckler M. Permutt A. Koivisto V. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1992; 75: 795-799Google Scholar), defective translocation or activation of GLUT4 in response to insulin has been hypothesized (10Garvey W.T. Olefsky J.M. Matthaei S. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 189-197Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) responsible for this impairment in the glucose transport system remains to be delineated.In primary culture of rat adipocytes, Marshall et al. (10Garvey W.T. Olefsky J.M. Matthaei S. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 189-197Google Scholar, 11Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Google Scholar) demonstrated that increased glucose flux into the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway is the mechanism by which prolonged exposure to high levels of glucose and insulin resulted in impaired glucose transport. Additional in vitro and in vivo studies support the hypothesis that recruitment of this pathway is a major mechanism by which hyperglycemia causes insulin resistance (12Traxinger R.R. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10148-10154Google Scholar, 13Robinson K.A. Sens D.A. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1333-1346Google Scholar, 14Giaccari A. Morviducci L. Zorretta D. Sbraccia P. Leonetti F. Caiola S. Buongiorno A. Bonadonna R.C. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 518-524Google Scholar, 15Crook E.D. Daniels M.C. Smith T.M. McClain D.A. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1289-1296Google Scholar). Recently, we infused GlcN in conscious rats at a rate designed to reproduce the flux of glucose into the hexosamine pathway during hyperglycemia (16Rossetti L. Hawkins M. Chen W. Gindi J. Barzilai N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 132-140Google Scholar). This was associated with increased accumulation of skeletal muscle UDP-N-acetylhexosamines, marked time-dependent impairments in the ability of insulin to promote peripheral glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis, and a pronounced decline in skeletal muscle UDP-Glc concentrations. More important, Baron et al. (17Baron A. Zhu J.-S. Zhu J.-H. Weldon H. Maianu L. Garvey W.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2792-2801Google Scholar) demonstrated that the marked impairment in insulin-mediated glucose disposal induced by increased GlcN availability was associated with decreased muscle GLUT4 translocation to the sarcolemmal fraction in response to insulin. Similarly, hyperglycemia resulted in the accumulation of skeletal muscle hexosamine metabolites, decreased skeletal muscle UDP-hexose (UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal) levels, and increased UDP-hexosamine/UDP-hexose ratios (18Robinson K.A. Weinstein M.L. Lindenmeyer G.E. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1438-1446Google Scholar). Thus, it has been hypothesized that this quantitatively small pathway of glucose utilization may link the rate of glucose flux to the activity of the glucose transport system by functioning as a “glucose sensor” capable of decreasing the rate of glucose uptake when detecting an increased availability of hexose phosphates (11Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Google Scholar, 19Buse M.G. Robinson K.A. Marshall B.A. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23197-23202Google Scholar, 20Rossetti L. Clin. Invest. Med. 1995; 18: 255-260Google Scholar).The rate-limiting step for the entry of glucose carbons into this pathway is the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to glucosamine 6-phosphate by the enzyme glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase. Downstream metabolic products are formed by subsequent acetylation and uridylation. The end product of this pathway (UDP-GlcNAc) serves as substrate in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins, and its accumulation provides an index of the amount of carbon flux through this pathway (Fig. 1A). Consumption of UTP in the synthesis of hexosamine end products causes depletion of the intracellular uridine pool (21Holstege A. Keppler D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1986; 76: 485-492Google Scholar–23Erichsen C. Christensson P. Jakobsson B. Eriksson G. Yngner T. Jonsson P. Stenram U. Anticancer Res. 1987; 7: 77-80Google Scholar). More important, the decreased cellular availability of UTP is expected to limit the synthesis of both UDP-glucose and UDP-GlcNAc while favoring the accumulation of intermediate products of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (22Pederson N. Knop R. Miller W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3782-3786Google Scholar). The above effects may modulate the action of insulin on glucose metabolism. As an example, the decrease in UDP-Glc available as substrate for glycogen formation may contribute to the GlcN-induced impairment in insulin action on glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis (16Rossetti L. Hawkins M. Chen W. Gindi J. Barzilai N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 132-140Google Scholar). Alternatively, uridine availability may alter the balance between intermediate and end products within the glucosamine pathway (22Pederson N. Knop R. Miller W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3782-3786Google Scholar); hence, depletion of intracellular uridine may either limit or potentiate the metabolic effects of GlcN administration on insulin action.In this study, we attempt to identify those metabolic/cellular effects of a prolonged increase in GlcN availability that are required for the induction of skeletal muscle insulin resistance. This study provides evidence that the inhibitory effects of GlcN on insulin-mediated glucose uptake are due to increased accumulation of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc, the end products of the GlcN pathway, rather than depletion of UDP-glucose.RESULTSGeneral Characteristics of the AnimalsAt the time of the study, the mean body weights of the animals in the +GlcN groups were similar to those in the saline-infused (−GlcN) groups (326 ± 12 versus 294 ± 20 g; p > 0.05). The mean plasma glucose concentrations at base line were 7.0 ± 0.2 mmol/liter in the +GlcN groups and 7.1 ± 0.3 mmol/liter in the −GlcN groups (p > 0.1).Plasma Glucose, Glucosamine, and Insulin ConcentrationsThe infusion of glucosamine (30 μmol/kg/min) over the 7-h studies increased the plasma glucosamine concentration by ∼100-fold in both +GlcN groups (to 1.9 ± 0.2 mM). The plasma glucose concentration was maintained at the basal level during all the insulin clamp studies. The plasma insulin levels were maintained constant at ∼570 nM throughout the 7 h in both study groups. The coefficients of variation in plasma glucose and insulin levels were <5 and 10%, respectively, in all studies.Skeletal Muscle UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GalNAc, UDP-Glc, and UDP-Gal ConcentrationsThe co-infusion of uridine during prolonged GlcN administration prevented the depletion in the skeletal muscle concentrations of UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal that was observed in +GlcN-S. Uridine infusion in the absence of GlcN elevated UDP-Glc levels by ∼2.5-fold. While 7-h GlcN infusion resulted in ∼2.5-fold elevation in skeletal muscle UDP-GlcNAc concentrations in the +GlcN groups (+GlcN-U and +GlcN-S) relative to their saline controls, there were significant and substantial increases in the skeletal muscle concentrations of both UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc in the presence of uridine repletion (+GlcN-U and −GlcN-U) (Table I).Table I.Skeletal muscle UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcNAc, and UDP-GalNAc concentrations at the end of paired euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp studies in 6-h fasted rats in the presence of 7-h glucosamine (+GlcN) or saline (−GlcN) infusions with (−GlcN-U, n = 4; +GlcN-U, n = 6) and without (−GlcN-S, n = 5; +GlcN-S, n = 5) repletion of uridineUridineSalineGlcN−+−+UDP-Glc (nmol/g)17.8 ± 6.155.2 ± 14.2ap < 0.05 versus −GlcN-S.10.1 ± 2.9ap < 0.05 versus −GlcN-S.24.9 ± 5.3bp < 0.01 versus +GlcN-S.UDP-Gal (nmol/g)5.2 ± 0.516.3 ± 3.2cp < 0.025 versus −GlcN-S.4.1 ± 0.88.7 ± 1.2dp < 0.025 versus +GlcN-S.UDP-GlcNAc (nmol/g)35.9 ± 9.784.8 ± 8.8ap < 0.05 versus −GlcN-S.94.7 ± 9.7ap < 0.05 versus −GlcN-S.198.4 ± 26.3bp < 0.01 versus +GlcN-S.UDP-GalNAc (nmol/g)9.4 ± 2.321.3 ± 1.6ap < 0.05 versus −GlcN-S.13.8 ± 3.027.0 ± 4.1dp < 0.025 versus +GlcN-S.UDP-GlcNAc/UDP-Glc2.1 ± 0.51.8 ± 0.312.3 ± 3.6cp < 0.025 versus −GlcN-S.9.4 ± 1.6a p < 0.05 versus −GlcN-S.b p < 0.01 versus +GlcN-S.c p < 0.025 versus −GlcN-S.d p < 0.025 versus +GlcN-S.

The glucose infusion rate exhibited a 53 ± 6% decrease in the +GlcN-U group as compared with a 25 ± 4% decrease with GlcN alone (+GlcN-S: 5-7 h = 28.4 ± 1.8 versus 0-2 h = 38.2 ± 2.6 mg/kg/min; p < 0.005 versus +GlcN-U). Similarly, glucose uptake decreased by 43 ± 5% with both GlcN and uridine infusion (+GlcN-U), but only by 29 ± 3% in the +GlcN-S group (p < 0.025). Infusion of uridine alone (−GlcN-U) also resulted in significant reductions in glucose infusion rate (5-7 h = 24.8 ± 1.8 versus 0-2 h = 37.4 ± 2.4 mg/kg/min; p < 0.025) (Fig. 2A) and skeletal muscle glucose uptake (Table II).The observed decreases in glucose infusion rate and in peripheral glucose uptake were largely due to marked reductions in the rate of glycogen synthesis, which also decreased to the greatest extent in the +GlcN-U group (Table II). It is noteworthy that the initial rates (0-2 h) of glycogen synthesis were higher with the addition of uridine. There was also an increase in the initial rate of glycogen synthesis with increased GlcN availability. The rates of glycolysis were not significantly altered between the two study intervals.Fig. 3 depicts the significant correlation between skeletal muscle UDP-GlcNAc concentrations and the percent decrease in glucose infusion rate observed from the initial 2 h to the final 2 h of 7-h GlcN or saline infusions, with and without uridine repletion (r2 = 0.758; p < 0.005).Fig. 3Percent decrease in glucose infusion rate plotted as a function of skeletal muscle UDP-GlcNAc concentrations following 7-h GlcN or saline infusions with paired euglycemic insulin clamp studies with (+GlcN-U, n = 6; −GlcN-U, n = 4) and without (+GlcN-S, n = 10; −GlcN-S, n = 5) uridine repletion.

Uridine infusion over the 7-h time interval modestly increased total glycogen concentration in the saline groups as well (−GlcN-U = 21.3 ± 0.4 versus 18.5 ± 1.7 mg/g, wet weight; p < 0.05).Muscle Glucose 6-Phosphate ConcentrationSkeletal muscle glucose 6-phosphate concentrations were similarly and significantly decreased following 7-h GlcN and uridine infusions. There was a further reduction in Glc-6-P levels in the +GlcN-U group, apparently reflecting the proportionally greater decrease in glucose uptake (Fig. 2B).Kinetic Analysis of Muscle Glycogen SynthaseMost of the short-term effects of insulin on skeletal muscle glycogen synthase activity are due to dephosphorylation of the enzyme. This in turn results in heightened affinity of the enzyme for its substrate, i.e. decreased Km for UDP-glucose. Following GlcN infusion alone (+GlcN-S), insulin caused normal activation of the enzyme with decreased Km. However, no significant decrease in the Km for UDP-glucose occurred in the uridine-treated rats; thus, insulin was unable to normally activate glycogen synthase in either the −GlcN-U or +GlcN-U group (+GlcN-U Km = 0.27 ± 0.05 versus +GlcN-S Km = 0.17 ± 0.02 mM, p < 0.05; −GlcN-U Km = 0.30 ± 0.05 versus −GlcN-S Km = 0.15 ± 0.02 mM, p < 0.01).Immunoisolation of GLUT4-containing VesiclesFig. 4A contrasts two representative GLUT4 immunoblots before (lane B) and after (lane A) immunoprecipitation of skeletal muscle membranes. The intensity of the lane A bands suggests the almost complete recovery of GLUT4 protein in the GLUT4-containing vesicles. Fig. 4B demonstrates that ∼100-fold greater amounts of [14C]glucosamine were incorporated from the UDP-GlcNAc pool into the GLUT4-containing vesicles following GlcN relative to saline infusion (+GlcN-S versus −GlcN-S; p < 0.01).Fig. 4Immunoisolation of GLUT4-containing vesicles from skeletal muscle.

The nonspecific radioactivity (i.e. dpm not due to oligosaccharide side chains) was estimated by treatment of the immunoisolated vesicles with endoglycosidase F (+EG-F). Specifically, the isolated membranes were incubated with or without 1 unit of endoglycosidase-F for 17 h at 37°C. After incubation, vesicles were immunoprecipitated as described above, and radioactivity was measured. The radioactivity due to [3H]glucose entrapment within the vesicles was not significantly diminished by the endoglycosidase treatment, while >90% of the radioactivity derived from [14C]GlcN was removed by the procedure. *, p < 0.01 versus −GlcN-S.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates that uridine repletion enhanced the formation of uridylated end products of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and resulted in substantial resistance to the metabolic effects of insulin. While infusion of GlcN resulted in significant depletion of skeletal muscle UDP-Glc, simultaneous and equimolar uridine infusions completely normalized the intracellular UDP-Glc pool. Substantial and comparable decreases in skeletal muscle glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis occurred following 7-h continuous infusions of both GlcN (+GlcN-S) and uridine (−GlcN-U) relative to saline (−GlcN-S), while GlcN and uridine infusions together (+GlcN-U) had considerably more effect on these parameters. In fact, the accumulation of skeletal muscle hexosamines (UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc) was significantly and similarly increased by ∼3-fold in the presence of either GlcN or uridine infusions alone, while the infusion of GlcN together with uridine repletion resulted in ∼6-fold increased accumulation. Thus, GlcN and uridine administration appeared to have additive effects, both on the accumulation of end products of the glucosamine pathway and on the induction of insulin resistance. Indeed, there was a highly significant correlation between skeletal muscle UDP-GlcNAc levels and the percent reduction in glucose infusion rate and glucose uptake. More important, increasing the levels of UDP-GlcNAc by infusion of uridine in the absence of increased GlcN availability and UDP-Glc depletion was equally effective in inducing skeletal muscle insulin resistance.Formation of glucose 6-phosphate in skeletal muscle decreased with glucosamine infusion, both in the uridine-treated and the saline-infused rats. The greatest effect (lowest Glc-6-P levels) was observed in the +GlcN-U group, in which the decline in peripheral glucose uptake was also greatest. As noted in previous studies in which continuous glucosamine infusion resulted in reduced insulin-mediated glucose uptake with decreased Glc-6-P levels (16Rossetti L. Hawkins M. Chen W. Gindi J. Barzilai N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 132-140Google Scholar, 37Hawkins M. Barzilai N. Chen W. Angelov I. Hu M. Cohen P. Rossetti L. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1734-1743Google Scholar), this indicates that the rate-limiting defect in glucose uptake with increased GlcN availability must be either glucose transport or phosphorylation. Conversely, while glycogen synthesis was significantly decreased in both groups, the lack of accumulation of Glc-6-P revealed that this was not the key regulatory site for the decrease in glucose uptake. This finding is consistent with the previous observations that increased GlcN availability was associated with decreased GLUT4 translocation (13Robinson K.A. Sens D.A. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1333-1346Google Scholar, 17Baron A. Zhu J.-S. Zhu J.-H. Weldon H. Maianu L. Garvey W.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2792-2801Google Scholar).Intracellular uridine availability may regulate both glycogen storage, through the formation of UDP-Glc, and the synthesis of such vital cellular products as glycoproteins via its incorporation into the UDP-hexosamines. Consequently, there is an important interrelationship between the intracellular uridine (UDP/UTP) pool and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. This connection has been extensively explored in oncology literature, examining the effects of uridine depletion and repletion on the efficacy of GlcN as a chemotherapeutic agent. A number of in vitro and in vivo studies showed that GlcN administration either to cultured carcinoma cells or to conscious rats resulted in depletion of the intracellular UTP pool (21Holstege A. Keppler D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1986; 76: 485-492Google Scholar, 23Erichsen C. Christensson P. Jakobsson B. Eriksson G. Yngner T. Jonsson P. Stenram U. Anticancer Res. 1987; 7: 77-80Google Scholar) and actually limited the accumulation of UDP-GlcNAc and other end products of the hexosamine pathway. Additionally, in the presence of uridine depletion, there was increased formation of such intermediate products of the hexosamine pathway as N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate and N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate (22Pederson N. Knop R. Miller W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3782-3786Google Scholar). However, the subsequent addition of uridine resulted both in depletion (i.e. normalization) of the concentrations of these hexosamine intermediates (22Pederson N. Knop R. Miller W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3782-3786Google Scholar) and in increased formation of the UDP-N-acetylhexosamine end products (21Holstege A. Keppler D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1986; 76: 485-492Google Scholar, 22Pederson N. Knop R. Miller W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3782-3786Google Scholar, 23Erichsen C. Christensson P. Jakobsson B. Eriksson G. Yngner T.

Overdijk B. Van den Eijnden D.H. Ferwerda W. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 865-870Google Scholar). Finally, it was noted that the amount of UDP-GlcNAc accumulation was associated with the functional efficacy of GlcN administration, i.e. with its antitumor activity (38Calvaruso G. Taibi G. Torregrossa M.V. Romano N. Tesoriere G. Life Sci. 1986; 39: 2221-2227Google Scholar).In this study, we generated marked alterations in the muscle concentration of key metabolites in the GlcN and glycogenic pathways to gain insight into the cellular mechanism(s) by which increased flux through the GlcN pathway causes insulin resistance. Consistent with the above observations, substantially higher skeletal muscle UDP-N-acetylhexosamine levels (UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc) were measured in both experimental groups receiving uridine repletion relative to their controls. The increased accumulation of UDP-GalNAc with uridine repletion was particularly noteworthy in the absence of GlcN, indicating that the increased availability of UDP/UTP had a stimulatory role in the formation of end products of the hexosamine pathway. These findings also suggest that the depletion of intracellular uridine following prolonged GlcN infusion had in fact limited the amount of flux through the hexosamine pathway down to the level of UDP-GlcNAc and hence ultimately the amount or composition of oligosaccharide chains in newly formed glycoproteins. This could also explain the highly significant correlation between skeletal muscle UDP-GlcNAc levels and the percent decrease in glucose uptake in all groups. On the contrary, the GlcN-induced depletion of the muscle UDP-Glc pool did not appear to play any significant role in the induction of insulin resistance. Thus, repletion of uridine apparently unmasked a greater potential for GlcN to affect insulin action by enhancing the formation of downstream products of the hexosamine pathway.The observation that increased GlcN availability led to a marked increase in the rate of incorporation of 14C-labeled GlcN into skeletal muscle GLUT4-containing vesicles suggests that one or more proteins associated with these vesicles is rapidly glycosylated. Thus, it is likely that GlcN administration resulted in either altered composition of the oligosaccharide chains in newly formed glycoproteins or an increase in the absolute rate of protein glycosylation.Indeed, UDP-GlcNAc is a critical component of both O-linked and N-linked protein glycosylation. There is a relative enrichment of proteins bearing O-linked GlcNAc in cell nuclei (40Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8049-8057Google Scholar), and transcription factors can be rapidly modified by O-linked glycosylation (41Jackson S. Tijan R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Google Scholar). The latter effects may play an important role in the long-term consequences of increased GlcN availability on the gene expression of key intracellular proteins. However, our current findings are most consistent with the hypothesis that altered post-translational glycosylation of a vesicular protein with an important role in GLUT4 vesicular trafficking or membrane docking could result in decreased GLUT4 translocation or activation and thus in defective activation of glucose transport by insulin.Activation of the GlcN pathway by either GlcN or uridine infusion was associated with a profound suppression of glycogen synthesis, accounting for nearly all the impairment in glucose uptake, and the degree of suppression was greater in the presence of increased GlcN availability with concomitant uridine repletion. As noted above, we previously reported similar GlcN-induced impairments in glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis, together with accumulation of UDP-hexosamines and depletion of UDP-Glc (16Rossetti L. Hawkins M. Chen W. Gindi J. Barzilai N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 132-140Google Scholar, 37Hawkins M. Barzilai N. Chen W. Angelov I. Hu M. Cohen P. Rossetti L. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1734-1743Google Scholar). This GlcN-induced suppression of glycogen synthesis had occurred despite normal activation of skeletal muscle glycogen synthase by insulin. Thus, the profound decrease in substrate availability appeared to be responsible for the reduction in glycogen synthesis. It is thus particularly noteworthy that the percent decrease in glycogen synthesis in the current studies was greater with uridine repletion than with GlcN alone. Thus, depletion of UDP-Glc was not solely responsible for GlcN-induced resistance to the peripheral effects of insulin either on glucose uptake or on glycogen synthesis.There was indeed a significant impairment in the activation of muscle glycogen synthase by insulin in the two groups receiving uridine infusions. The observation of a diminished ability of insulin to activate skeletal muscle glycogen synthase in the presence of an increased availability of both GlcN and uridine may be attributed to the higher levels of muscle UDP-GlcNAc achieved in this group. In fact, higher concentrations of this metabolite may be required to affect insulin action on glycogen synthase than on glucose transport. However, the concentration of skeletal muscle UDP-GlcNAc increased comparably with the addition of uridine and GlcN alone. A potential explanation for the lack of effect of GlcN infusion on glycogen synthase activation may be found in the known inhibitory action that elevated levels of GlcN per se exert on the rate of glycosylation (13Robinson K.A. Sens D.A. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1333-1346Google Scholar, 42Elbein A.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 497-534Google Scholar). In fact, the concomitant increase in the concentration of GlcN may restrain the effects of increased availability of UDP-GlcNAc on its metabolic targets. The increased efficiency of the skeletal muscle UDP-GlcNAc generated during uridine versus GlcN infusion is also supported by the heightened effects of the former on the in vivo rates of glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis.Despite a greater percent decrease in the rate of peripheral glycogen synthesis over 7 h of GlcN infusion, we noted an overall increase in total skeletal muscle glycogen content with the addition of uridine infusion. There was a significant time-dependent effect of uridine on the rate of glycogen synthesis: a transient initial increase, likely reflecting the increased concentration of UDP-Glc, was followed by a marked decrease (Table II).In conclusion, the marked decrease in insulin-mediated glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis observed with increased GlcN availability appears to be proportional to the amount of flux into the hexosamine pathway and is not the consequence of skeletal muscle UDP-glucose depletion. Furthermore, the addition of uridine during both GlcN and saline infusions resulted in enhanced accumulation of skeletal muscle UDP-hexosamines that was highly correlated with the degree of peripheral insulin resistance. Thus, increased formation of UDP-GlcNAc generated either by increased GlcN availability or by enhanced uridylation causes a severe impairment in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. The substantial decrease in Glc-6-P levels indicated that a defect in glucose transport and/or phosphorylation was responsible for the decrease in glucose uptake. Abnormal glycosylation of proteins that play a key role in the translocation of GLUT4-containing vesicles could explain such a reduction in glucose transport. We consequently propose that GlcN-induced resistance to the effects of insulin on glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis is mediated by increased accumulation of downstream hexosamine metabolites, perhaps via altered protein glycosylation of GLUT4-containing vesicles. INTRODUCTIONA decrease in the ability of insulin to stimulate the uptake of glucose in skeletal muscle is a major feature of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) 1The abbreviations used are: NIDDMnon-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitusHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyBSAbovine serum albuminPBSphosphate-buffered saline. (1DeFronzo R.A. Bonadonna R.C. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 318-368Google Scholar). Recent evidence obtained by 31P NMR spectroscopy of skeletal muscle glucose 6-phosphate (2Rothman D.L. Shulman R.G. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1069-1075Google Scholar) and by modeling of forearm glucose transport and uptake (3Bonadonna R.C. Del Prato S. Saccomani M.P. Bonora E. Gulli G. Ferrannini E. Bier D. Cobelli C. DeFronzo R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 486-494Google Scholar) has revealed that this defect in insulin action in subjects with NIDDM is due to decreased muscle glucose transport/phosphorylation. Glucose transport in skeletal muscle occurs by facilitated diffusion using the insulin-regulated type of glucose transporter, GLUT4 (4James D.E. Strube M. Mueckler M.

Commun. 1990; 172: 728-736Google Scholar). Since skeletal muscle GLUT4 gene expression is similar in subjects with NIDDM and nondiabetic controls (8Garvey W.T. Maianu L. Zhu J.-H. Hancock J. Golichowski A. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1773-1785Google Scholar, 9Yki-Jarvinen H. Vuorinen-Markkola H. Koranyi L. Bourey R. Tordjman K. Mueckler M. Permutt A. Koivisto V. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1992; 75: 795-799Google Scholar), defective translocation or activation of GLUT4 in response to insulin has been hypothesized (10Garvey W.T. Olefsky J.M. Matthaei S. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 189-197Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) responsible for this impairment in the glucose transport system remains to be delineated.In primary culture of rat adipocytes, Marshall et al. (10Garvey W.T. Olefsky J.M. Matthaei S. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 189-197Google Scholar, 11Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Google Scholar) demonstrated that increased glucose flux into the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway is the mechanism by which prolonged exposure to high levels of glucose and insulin resulted in impaired glucose transport. Additional in vitro and in vivo studies support the hypothesis that recruitment of this pathway is a major mechanism by which hyperglycemia causes insulin resistance (12Traxinger R.R. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10148-10154Google Scholar, 13Robinson K.A. Sens D.A. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1333-1346Google Scholar, 14Giaccari A. Morviducci L. Zorretta D. Sbraccia P. Leonetti F.

Recently, we infused GlcN in conscious rats at a rate designed to reproduce the flux of glucose into the hexosamine pathway during hyperglycemia (16Rossetti L. Hawkins M. Chen W. Gindi J. Barzilai N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 132-140Google Scholar). This was associated with increased accumulation of skeletal muscle UDP-N-acetylhexosamines, marked time-dependent impairments in the ability of insulin to promote peripheral glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis, and a pronounced decline in skeletal muscle UDP-Glc concentrations. More important, Baron et al. (17Baron A. Zhu J.-S. Zhu J.-H. Weldon H. Maianu L. Garvey W.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2792-2801Google Scholar) demonstrated that the marked impairment in insulin-mediated glucose disposal induced by increased GlcN availability was associated with decreased muscle GLUT4 translocation to the sarcolemmal fraction in response to insulin. Similarly, hyperglycemia resulted in the accumulation of skeletal muscle hexosamine metabolites, decreased skeletal muscle UDP-hexose (UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal) levels, and increased UDP-hexosamine/UDP-hexose ratios (18Robinson K.A.

Thus, it has been hypothesized that this quantitatively small pathway of glucose utilization may link the rate of glucose flux to the activity of the glucose transport system by functioning as a “glucose sensor” capable of decreasing the rate of glucose uptake when detecting an increased availability of hexose phosphates (11Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Google Scholar, 19Buse M.G. Robinson K.A. Marshall B.A. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23197-23202Google Scholar, 20Rossetti L. Clin. Invest. Med. 1995; 18: 255-260Google Scholar).The rate-limiting step for the entry of glucose carbons into this pathway is the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to glucosamine 6-phosphate by the enzyme glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase. Downstream metabolic products are formed by subsequent acetylation and uridylation. The end product of this pathway (UDP-GlcNAc) serves as substrate in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins, and its accumulation provides an index of the amount of carbon flux through this pathway (Fig. 1A). Consumption of UTP in the synthesis of hexosamine end products causes depletion of the intracellular uridine pool (21Holstege A. Keppler D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1986; 76: 485-492Google Scholar–23Erichsen C. Christensson P. Jakobsson B. Eriksson G. Yngner T. Jonsson P. Stenram U. Anticancer Res. 1987; 7: 77-80Google Scholar). More important, the decreased cellular availability of UTP is expected to limit the synthesis of both UDP-glucose and UDP-GlcNAc while favoring the accumulation of intermediate products of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (22Pederson N. Knop R. Miller W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3782-3786Google Scholar). The above effects may modulate the action of insulin on glucose metabolism. As an example, the decrease in UDP-Glc available as substrate for glycogen formation may contribute to the GlcN-induced impairment in insulin action on glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis (16Rossetti L. Hawkins M. Chen W. Gindi J. Barzilai N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 132-140Google Scholar). Alternatively, uridine availability may alter the balance between intermediate and end products within the glucosamine pathway (22Pederson N. Knop R. Miller W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3782-3786Google Scholar); hence, depletion of intracellular uridine may either limit or potentiate the metabolic effects of GlcN administration on insulin action.In this study, we attempt to identify those metabolic/cellular effects of a prolonged increase in GlcN availability that are required for the induction of skeletal muscle insulin resistance. This study provides evidence that the inhibitory effects of GlcN on insulin-mediated glucose uptake are due to increased accumulation of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc, the end products of the GlcN pathway, rather than depletion of UDP-glucose."

We studied the interactions of known factors that regulate this process by isolating compact COCs from mice and inducing their expansion in vitro. Maximum HA synthesis requires either follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) in combination with either a soluble factor(s) produced by the oocyte or transforming growth factor β1. FSH (or EGF) exerts its effects during the first 2 h of incubation, before HA synthesis actually begins. The oocyte factor(s) (or transforming growth factor β1) exerts its effects from 2 h onwards and must be continuously present throughout the subsequent ∼10 h to achieve a maximum level of HA synthesis. FSH stimulates intracellular cAMP synthesis, which correlates with net HA production up to ∼14 fmol/COC at 5 ng/ml FSH; however, higher concentrations of FSH increase cAMP levels ∼10-fold higher with no additional effect on HA synthesis. EGF at saturating concentrations for HA synthesis does not stimulate cAMP above basal levels. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and tyrphostin AG18 nearly abolish the HA synthesis response to EGF and inhibit the response to FSH by ∼60%, suggesting that a tyrosine kinase activity is involved for both factors, whereas FSH also operates partially through another signaling pathway. Actinomycin D abolishes HA synthesis if added at the beginning of culture and reduces HA synthesis by ∼50% if added between 6-12 h when HA synthesis is normally maximal.

In the mammalian preovulatory follicle, the cumulus oophorus expands dramatically when the cumulus cells (CCs), 1The abbreviations used are: CCcumulus cellHAhyaluronanCOCcumulus cell-oocyte complexFSHfollicle-stimulating hormonePMSGpregnant mares' serum gonadotropinEGFepidermal growth factorTGFβ1transforming growth factor β1dbcAMPdibutyryl cAMPFBSfetal bovine serumDSdermatan sulfateHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. consisting of a few layers of granulosa cells closely surrounding the oocyte, are induced to synthesize large amounts of hyaluronan (HA) (1Salustri A. Yanagishita M. Underhill C.B. Laurent T.C. Hascall V.C. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 541-551Google Scholar). The secreted HA interacts with specific matrix components, thereby forming a highly hydrated and viscoelastic matrix in the intercellular spaces, which results in an ∼20-fold increase in volume of the cumulus cell-oocyte complex (COC) (2Chen L. Mao S.J.T. Larsen W.J. J. Biol Chem. 1992; 267: 12380-12386Google Scholar, 3Chen L. Mao S.J.T. McLean L.R. Powers R.W. Larsen W.J. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 28282-28287Google Scholar, 4Camaioni A. Hascall V.C. Yanagishita M. Salustri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20473-20481Google Scholar). Recent findings show that CCs synthesize a dermatan sulfate (DS) proteoglycan with high molecular weight that also accumulates in the extracellular matrix, most likely through specific binding to HA (5Camaioni A. Salustri A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 190-198Google Scholar). The expansion of the COC may facilitate the extrusion of the oocyte through the ruptured follicle wall during ovulation and assist its capture by the oviductal fimbria and entry into the oviduct (6Chen L. Russell P.T. Larsen W.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 34: 87-93Google Scholar, 7Mahi-Brown C.A. Yanagimachi R. Gamete Res. 1983; 8: 1-10Google Scholar). Moreover, HA and DS proteoglycans may contribute to the success of oocyte fertilization by stabilizing the structure of the egg zona pellucida (8De Felici M. Salustri A. Siracusa G. Gamete Res. 1985; 12: 227-235Google Scholar) and by stimulating sperm activation (9Meizel S. Am. J. Anat. 1985; 174: 285-302Google Scholar) and motility (10Huszar G. Willetts M. Corrales M. Fertil.

Presently, it is not known if COC expansion in vivo is induced directly by gonadotropins or is mediated indirectly by the mural granulosa cells (12Eppig J.J. Biol. Reprod. 1980; 23: 545-552Google Scholar). However, the time course of mouse COC expansion and HA synthesis induced in vitro by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is nearly the same as that in vivo, and net production of HA per cell is essentially the same (1Salustri A. Yanagishita M. Underhill C.B. Laurent T.C. Hascall V.C. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 541-551Google Scholar). Studies in vitro have also shown that CCs dissected from mouse COCs and cultured without oocytes do not produce significantly higher amounts of HA when stimulated with FSH but do so when oocytes or oocyte-conditioned medium are also present (13Salustri A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 26-32Google Scholar). Thus, synthesis of HA by mouse CCs in vitro requires the combined action of FSH and a soluble factor(s) produced by the oocyte. Conversely, FSH induces CCs to increase the synthesis of DS independent of the presence of oocytes (13Salustri A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 26-32Google Scholar). A transient increase of intracellular cAMP is triggered by FSH treatment (14Salustri A. Petrungaro S. De Felici M. Conti M. Siracusa G. Biol. Reprod. 1985; 33: 797-802Google Scholar), and dbcAMP, a synthetic analogue of cAMP, induces similar effects on both HA and DS synthesis (15Salustri A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13840-13847Google Scholar), suggesting that FSH action is mediated by this cyclic nucleotide. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) can substitute for FSH, and transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) can substitute for the oocyte factor(s) in promoting these CC functions (16Salustri A. Ulisse S. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19517-19523Google Scholar). Like the oocyte factor(s), TGFβ1 synergizes with FSH (or EGF) to increase HA production, and EGF, like FSH or dbcAMP, requires the presence of the oocyte factor(s) (or TGFβ1) to induce HA synthesis while inducing DS synthesis even in their absence (16Salustri A. Ulisse S. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19517-19523Google Scholar). It is not known to what extent FSH and EGF share common intracellular signaling pathways for inducing HA and DS synthesis by CCs. EGF operates primarily through tyrosine kinase pathways and is generally considered to exert its effects independent of cAMP pathways. However, a slight but significant increase of intracellular levels of cAMP has been observed in EGF-stimulated mouse COCs (17Downs S.M. Daniel S.A.J. Eppig J.J. J. Exp. Zool. 1988; 245: 86-96Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been suggested that a protein tyrosine kinase activity is involved in the cAMP-dependent signal transduction pathway of gonadotropins in promoting differentiation (18Gomberg-Malool S. Reiz Re'em Y. Posner I. Levitzki A. Orly J. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 362-370Google Scholar, 19Orly J. Rei Z. Greenberg N.M. Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2336-2346Google Scholar) and luteinization of granulosa cells, as well as in events required for ovulation (20Wong W.Y.L. Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3512-3521Google Scholar, 21Morris J.K. Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 770-779Google Scholar). The aims of the present study were to investigate at which intracellular level the oocyte factor(s) (or TGFβ1) and FSH (or EGF) interact to control HA and DS synthesis and to define the roles of cAMP and tyrosine kinase activity in the signal transduction pathways elicited by FSH and EGF that are involved in the activation of these functions in COCs. Female Swiss CD-1 mice were obtained from Charles River. Pregnant mares' serum gonadotropin (PMSG) was from Intervet (Boxmeer, Holland). Papain, dbcAMP, L-glutamine, genistein, dimethylpolysiloxane (type 5X), and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were purchased from Sigma. Eagle's minimum essential medium with Earle's salt, Hepes, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were from Life Technologies, Inc. Bovine serum albumin was from Miles (Milano, Italy). Gentamicin sulfate was from Whittaker Bioproducts (Walkersville, MA). Chondroitinase ABC (Proteus vulgaris) and chondroitin sulfate disaccharides (ΔDi-0S, ΔDi-4S, and ΔDi-6S) were from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). D-[6-3H(N)]Glucosamine (30-40 Ci/mmol) and [35S]sulfate (∼40 Ci/mg, carrier-free) were obtained from DuPont NEN. A Partisphere PAC (0.4 × 25 cm) column was from Whatman. Highly purified FSH (NIDDK-rat-FSH-I-8) was kindly provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the National Hormone and Pituitary Program of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Mouse EGF was from Collaborative Research (Bedford, MA). Human TGFβ1 was from R & D System (Minneapolis, MN). Tyrphostin AG18 and actinomycin D were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Antibody to cAMP was a gift of Dr. A. L. Steiner (University of Texas, Houston, TX). Guanidine HCl was from ICN. Triton X-100 was from Research Product International. Sephadex G-50 (fine) was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. The scintillation mixture, OptiPhase “HiSafe” 3, was from Wallac. Bio-beads SH-2 were from Bio-Rad. Immature 21-22-day-old female Swiss CD-1 mice were injected with 5 IU PMSG in 0.1 ml of physiological saline and sacrificed by cervical dislocation 44-48 h later. Ovaries were collected in Hepes-buffered Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. COCs were released into the medium by puncturing large antral follicles and collected by micropipette. For each culture, 20 COCs were transferred to a 10-μl drop of culture medium covered with dimethylpolysiloxane to prevent evaporation. The basal culture medium was Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 0.25 mM pyruvate, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 3 mML-glutamine, and 5% FBS. When the time course of oocyte action was studied, intact COCs were cultured with 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the presence of FSH but in the absence of FBS. In this case, HA is synthesized at maximal levels but is not organized in the extracellular matrix (5Camaioni A. Salustri A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 190-198Google Scholar). This facilitates removal of oocytes from the COCs at any time during the 18 h of stimulation. Cultures of isolated CCs (20 COC equivalents) were prepared as described previously (13Salustri A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 26-32Google Scholar). Briefly, for each culture, 20 COCs were mechanically dissociated in a 10-μl drop of culture medium under dimethylpolysiloxane by repeated passage through a micropipette with a diameter similar to that of an oocyte, and the oocytes were removed. Intact COCs were stimulated to synthesize HA and DS by adding FSH, dbcAMP, or EGF to the culture drop, singularly or in combination. CCs isolated from intact COCs (20 COC-equivalents) were stimulated to synthesize HA and DS by adding FSH to the culture drop and subsequently adding either different numbers of fully grown oocytes obtained from freshly isolated COCs, or different concentrations of TGFβ1, either individually or in combination. All the stimulating factors were used at the concentrations specified under “Results”. Glycosaminoglycan labeling precursors were added at the beginning of culture for metabolic labeling of HA and DS. The final culture drop volume for each culture was 20 μl. The cultures were incubated for 18 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 in humidified air. The amounts of HA and DS synthesized in the cultures were determined by metabolic labeling as described elsewhere (15Salustri A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13840-13847Google Scholar). For radiolabeling, [35S]sulfate (60 μCi/ml) and [3H]glucosamine (100 μCi/ml) were added to the culture medium. In the FSH, EGF, and dbcAMP time course experiments, culture media were collected at different times, and the cultures were washed three times with 20 μl of basal medium containing radiolabeled precursors at identical concentrations as in the initial medium and then incubated for the remaining time in basal medium containing the same concentrations of radiolabeled precursors. The same procedure was used in the TGFβ1 time course experiments except that FSH was present with the radiolabel precursors in the culture medium used for washing and subsequent culturing. All manipulation steps of extraction were done under dimethylpolysiloxane. After labeling, 20 μl of a papain solution (750 mIU) was added, and the cultures were incubated for 1 h at 65°C. The extraction was completed by adding 40 μl of 8 M guanidine HCl containing 4% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 40 μl of 4 M guanidine HCl containing 4% (w/v) Triton X-100. Each extract (∼120 μl) was transferred to a tube and was stored frozen until further analysis. Each extract was heated at 100°C for 3 min to inactivate the papain. Bovine serum albumin and HA (100 μg of each) were added to improve recovery of radiolabeled macromolecules during subsequent gel filtration procedures. Each extract was diluted to 500 μl by adding 0.1 M Tris, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 7.3, followed by elution on a column of Sephadex G-50 (2-ml bed volume) equilibrated with 0.1 M Tris, 0.1 M sodium acetate, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.3. This step removes the unincorporated radioisotopes and exchanges the guanidine HCl for a buffer suitable for chondroitinase digestion. The macromolecules in the excluded volume fraction were digested for 1 h by adding 20 μl (0.1 unit) of chondroitinase ABC dissolved in 0.1 M Tris, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 7.3. Approximately one-third of each digested sample was chromatographed on a column of Sephadex G-50 (4-ml bed volume), equilibrated, and eluted with the same buffer used for the first elution. The excluded and included fractions were counted for radioactivity to determine the proportions of the radiolabeled macromolecules digested by the enzyme. The remaining portion of each sample was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the relative amounts of HA and DS disaccharides (22Zebrower M.E. Kieras F. Brown W.T. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 93-99Google Scholar). For this purpose, each sample was treated with Bio-beads to remove Triton X-100 and then with 100% ethanol (sample:ethanol in a ratio 1:4) to precipitate undigested macromolecules. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was recovered and concentrated to a final volume of ∼20 μl under vacuum on a Speed Vac concentrator (Savant). The concentrated sample was applied to the HPLC column after the addition of ΔDi-0S, ΔDi-4S, and ΔDi-6S disaccharide standards (5 μg of each) as internal standards. The ΔDi-HA standard in each sample was derived from the enzymatic digestion of the carrier HA. Each sample was eluted on a column of Partisphere PAC equilibrated with acetonitrile:methanol:aqueous buffer in a ratio of 52:12:36 (22Zebrower M.E. Kieras F. Brown W.T. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 93-99Google Scholar). The aqueous buffer contained 0.5 M Tris, 0.1 M boric acid, pH 8. Fractions of 0.7 ml were collected, and radioactivities in each were determined with a Beckman LS 3801 counter. Differentiation of 35S and 3H activities was done by calculating 35S spill-over into the 3H channel using 35S standards prepared for each set of samples. The mass of HA and DS synthesized during the labeling period (in hexosamine equivalents) was determined as described previously (23Yanagishita M. Salustri A. Hascall V.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 435-445Google Scholar) by calculating the specific activity of the UDP-N-acetylhexosamine pools from the ratio of 3H to 35S in the ΔDi-4S and multiplying the total 3H dpm digested by chondroitinase (Sephadex G-50 analysis) by the proportion of 3H in ΔDi-HA (Partisphere PAC analysis). Intracellular cAMP levels were measured by a radioimmunoassay (24Steiner A.L. Parker C.W. Kipnis D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1106-1113Google Scholar). Briefly, COCs were incubated in a 20-μl culture drop in the presence of FSH or EGF at the concentrations specified in the text. After 1 h of incubation, the media were removed, and COCs were then washed two times with 50 μl of Eagle's minimum essential medium buffered with Hepes containing 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine in order to inhibit phosphodiesterase activity and prevent cAMP hydrolysis. Intracellular cAMP was extracted by adding 150 μl of ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid to the cultures. Cell extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected and extracted twice with 5 vol of water saturated with diethylether. Samples were acetylated before the assay following the procedure of Harper and Brooker (25Harper J.F. Brooker G. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1975; 1: 207-218Google Scholar). The radioimmunoassay had a sensitivity of 2-4 fmol of cAMP, an intra-assay coefficient of variation of 5.0%, and an interassay coefficient of variation of 10.3%. The blank values were subtracted from all determinations. Between 4 and 80 COCs were used in each determination. All data shown are means of at least duplicate determinations. The statistical significance of differences between two groups of data was evaluated by the Student's t test; differences were considered significant when P values were smaller than 0.05. COCs isolated from PMSG-primed mice were cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of FSH or EGF or combinations of both for 18 h, a period of time required for full expansion in vitro and for maximal HA and DS accumulation in the COC matrix. [3H]Glucosamine and [35S]sulfate were used as labeling precursors, and net synthesis of HA and DS was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results (Fig. 1) show that EGF can stimulate HA and DS synthesis to the same maximum level as that achieved by FSH. Maximal stimulation for both glycosaminoglycans occurred at a concentration of ∼50 pg/ml EGF with an ED50 at ∼20 pg/ml. FSH reached maximal stimulation at ∼5 ng/ml with an ED50 of ∼1 ng/ml, as previously observed (15Salustri A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13840-13847Google Scholar). Treatment of COCs with both factors combined at optimal doses did not promote any further increase of HA and DS synthesis. However, an additive effect was observed with combinations at suboptimal doses (Fig. 1, dashed curves). The high sensitivity of COCs to EGF stimulation raised the possibility that the observed effect with FSH might be due to a minor contamination of the hormone preparation with EGF. This was ruled out by the observation that a polyclonal EGF-neutralizing antibody had no effect on FSH stimulation of HA and DS synthesis (data not shown). The results reported in Table I and Fig. 7 below provide further support for this conclusion.TABLE I.cAMP levels and HA synthesis in COCs cultured in vitroTreatmentcAMPHADSfmol/COCpmol hexN/COCpmol hexN/COCBasal2.6 ± 0.7aThe ± symbols indicate the S.E. values from three cultures for each treatment.1.0 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.1FSH (ng/ml)0.54.2 ± 0.42.5 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.12.08.5 ± 1.05.5 ± 1.61.3 ± 0.15.014.1 ± 0.18.4 ± 1.51.5 ± 0.030.078.5 ± 7.5100.0163.0 ± 22.08.6 ± 0.71.4 ± 0.2500.0141.0 ± 4.0EGF (ng/ml)1.03.3 ± 1.09.6 ± 1.01.4 ± 0.0a The ± symbols indicate the S.E. values from three cultures for each treatment. Open table in a new tab Oocytes were separated from CCs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cultures with CCs prepared from 20 COCs were co-cultured with different numbers of oocytes or with different concentrations of TGFβ1 or with both for 18 h in the presence of FSH and radioisotopic precursors. The amounts of HA and DS synthesized in the cultures are shown in Fig. 2 along with a value for intact COCs from the same batch used to prepare the CCs. The results show that increasing numbers of the oocytes increase HA synthesis while having no effect on DS synthesis. A near maximum stimulation of HA synthesis was reached when the cultures contained 20 oocytes (Fig. 2, solid circle), a ratio of cells to oocytes equivalent to that in the original COCs. Further, the maximum response was essentially equivalent to that for intact COCs. Increasing concentrations of TGFβ1 also increased HA synthesis with no effect on DS synthesis. A near maximum stimulation of HA synthesis occurred at ∼1 ng/ml, but the maximum level achieved was only ∼60% that achieved in co-cultures with oocytes. The combination of oocytes and TGFβ1 gave additive responses at suboptimal levels of each (Fig. 2, dashed curves) but did not achieve a significantly higher value than that with oocytes alone at optimal ratios. The length of time that COCs must be exposed to FSH, dbcAMP, or EGF to induce maximal synthesis of HA and DS was determined. Optimal doses of FSH (5 ng/ml), dbcAMP (1 mM), or EGF (50 pg/ml) were added at the beginning of the cultures and then removed at different times. All cultures were incubated for the subsequent time in medium without the factors and stopped at 18 h for HA and DS determination. Radiolabeled precursors were present throughout the 18-h incubation. The results (Fig. 3) indicate that each factor was progressively more effective in inducing HA and DS synthesis with increasing exposure time up to ∼2 h. Longer exposure did not increase the net production of HA and DS. Thus, these factors exert their maximal effects before HA synthesis actually begins at ∼2.5 h (15Salustri A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13840-13847Google Scholar). The temporal effects of the oocyte factor(s) on HA synthesis were studied by adding 5 ng/ml FSH to cultures with 20 intact COCs at time zero and incubating them in the absence of FBS to facilitate removal of the oocytes at later times as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Net HA synthesis is not altered by the presence or the absence of FBS (4Camaioni A. Hascall V.C. Yanagishita M. Salustri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20473-20481Google Scholar). For TGFβ1 cultures, oocytes were first removed from 20 COCs, and the CCs were subsequently incubated in the presence of FSH and with 5 ng/ml TGFβ1 for different lengths of time. The times at which the oocytes were removed or at which the medium was replaced with medium with FSH but without TGFβ1 are shown on the x axis of Fig. 4. All cultures were incubated for 18 h after the initial addition of FSH, with radioisotopes present throughout the 18 h. The amounts of HA synthesized in the cultures increased continuously with increased time of exposure to the oocytes or to TGFβ1 through 12 h, by which time HA synthesis is almost complete in intact COCs incubated in similar conditions (15Salustri A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13840-13847Google Scholar). This indicates that continuous exposure of the CCs to the oocyte factor(s) or to TGFβ1 is necessary to achieve maximal HA synthesis. As in the previous experiments (Fig. 2), neither factor affected DS synthesis. A similar experiment was done in which CC cultures were first incubated in the presence of FSH for different periods of time before adding oocytes, or TGFβ1 to the medium as indicated in the diagram at the top of Fig. 5. When either oocytes or TGFβ1 were added at 2 h after exposure to FSH, a nearly maximal stimulation of HA synthesis was achieved (Fig. 5). However, net synthesis of HA rapidly decreased when the oocytes or TGFβ1 were added at yet later times. Only ∼50% of the maximum was achieved when the factors were added at 6 h, a value similar to that observed when the factors were removed at 6 h (Fig. 4). These results again indicate that maximal achievable synthesis of HA requires the continuous presence of either the oocyte factor(s) or TGFβ1; their removal leads to a rapid decrease in synthesis, and their initial absence fails to initiate high levels of synthesis. As for earlier experiments, neither factor altered DS synthesis. Cultures of intact COCs incubated in the presence of 5 ng/ml FSH and 5 ng/ml TGFβ1 were treated with 1 μg/ml actinomycin D. The TGFβ1 was added to supplement the oocyte factor(s) in case actinomycin D treatment prevented synthesis or secretion of the oocyte factor(s). The cultures were incubated for 6 or 12 h; labeled between 0 and 6, 0 and 12, or 6 and 12 h; and treated with actinomycin D between 0 and 6 or 6 and 12 h as indicated at the bottom of Fig. 6. The concentration of actinomycin D was not cytotoxic as indicated by trypan blue exclusion by COCs after each exposure time, nor did this concentration prevent resumption of meiosis by the enclosed oocyte after removal (data not shown). The presence of actinomycin D from the beginning (0-6 h) totally prevents HA synthesis (Fig. 6), indicating that transcription of mRNA for new protein(s), including most likely an HA synthase, is required to initiate HA synthesis. Once HA synthesis has reached a high level at 6 h (15Salustri A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13840-13847Google Scholar), the addition of actinomycin D decreases net synthesis of HA between 6-12 h to ∼50% of the amount synthesized by the positive controls (FSH + TGFβ1) during the same time period (arrows, Fig. 6). This suggests that HA synthesis continues for a period of time (∼3 h) until the critical mRNA species synthesized before the actinomycin D block and the protein(s) transcribed from them are depleted. The results suggest that the net synthesis of HA is primarily under transcriptional control and that the critical mRNA species have relatively short half-lives. The total amounts of 3H in HA for the 0-12-h labeling period are greater by ∼20% than the sum of the 0-6- and 6-12-h labeling periods. This reflects the time required for the [3H]glucosamine to equilibrate with the intracellular UDP-N-acetylhexosamine metabolic precursor pool. This will have less of an effect during the 0-6- and 0-12-h labeling periods because equilibration is occurring before HA synthesis has begun, whereas during the 6-12-h labeling period, the [3H]glucosamine equilibrates when HA synthesis is at or near maximal. The effects of actinomycin D on DS synthesis were very similar to those for HA (Fig. 6). In this case, the DS would normally be synthesized covalently bound to core proteins to form proteoglycans, and actinomycin D most likely prevents further transcription of mRNA for these core proteins. Previous studies showed that treatment with 1 μg/ml FSH transiently increases intracellular cAMP levels of COCs, with maximal levels reached at 1 h of incubation (14Salustri A. Petrungaro S. De Felici M. Conti M. Siracusa G. Biol. Reprod. 1985; 33: 797-802Google Scholar). The following experiments were done to establish whether a correlation exists between cAMP formation and HA and DS production stimulated by FSH. COCs were incubated in basal medium alone or with increasing doses of highly purified FSH. The cultures were stopped either at 1 h of culture to measure intracellular cAMP levels or at 18 h to determine the amount of HA and DS synthesized (Table I). The increase of intracellular cAMP levels induced by FSH was dose-dependent with an ED50 of ∼30 ng/ml and reached maximal values 50-60-fold higher than that observed in COCs cultured in basal medium. Increases of intracellular cAMP correlated with increases in HA and DS synthesis for FSH concentrations up to 5 ng/ml, when the increase of the cyclic nucleotide was only ∼6-fold. At higher FSH concentrations, ∼10-fold still higher levels of cAMP were induced but without a further increase of HA and DS synthesis. Treatment of COCs with 1 ng/ml EGF stimulated maximal production of HA and DS synthesis without"

https://openalex.org/W2089733360,"Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) is a recently isolated cytokine belonging to the interleukin-6 cytokine family. In the present study we show that CT-1 activates its receptor expressed at the surface of a human neural cell line by recruiting gp130 and gp190/leukemia inhibitory factor receptor β, as shown by analyzing their tyrosine phosphorylation level. Neutralizing antibody directed against gp130 and reconstitution experiments performed in the COS-7 cell line demonstrate that gp130-gp190 heterocomplex formation is essential for CT-1 signaling. Analysis of the subsequent activation events revealed that CT-1 induces and utilizes Jak1-, Jak2-, and Tyk2-associated tyrosine kinases, which are in turn relayed by STAT-3 transcription factor. Cross-linking of iodinated CT-1 to the cell surface led to the identification of a third α component in addition to gp130 and gp190, with an apparent molecular mass of 80 kDa. Removal of N-linked carbohydrates from the protein backbone of the α component resulted in a protein of 45 kDa. Our results provide evidence that the CT-1 receptor is composed of a tripartite complex, a situation similar to the high affinity receptor for ciliary neurotrophic factor.

Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Google Scholar). These closely related cytokines share many common biological properties, such as activation of hepatocyte transcription (Baumann et al., 1Baumann H. Ziegler S.F. Mosley B. Morella K.K. Pajovic S. Gearing D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8414-8417Google Scholar), activation of neural proliferation and differentiation (Yamamory et al., 1989), and regulation of hematopoiesis (Leary et al., 20Leary A.G. Wong G.G. Clark S.C. Smith A.G. Ogawa M. Blood. 1990; 75: 1960-1964Google Scholar; Musashi et al., 26Musashi M. Clark S.C. Sudo T. Urdal D.L. Ogawa M. Blood. 1991; 78: 1448-1451Google Scholar). In addition, LIF, CNTF, and OSM display biological properties in the early stages of embryonic development and allow the in vitro growth of embryonic stem cells in an undifferentiated state (Smith et al., 32Smith A.G. Heath J.K. Donaldson D.D. Wong G.G. Moreau J. Stahl M. Rogers D. Nature. 1988; 336: 688-690Google Scholar; Conover et al., 4Conover J.C. Ip N.Y. Poueymirou W.T. Bates B. Goldfarb M.P. DeChiara T.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Development. 1993; 119: 559-565Google Scholar). IL-6 and IL-11 are also important modulators for the immune response by regulating immunoglobulin secretion (Kishimoto et al., 18Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Google Scholar; Yin et al., 40Yin T.G. Schendel P. Yang Y.C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 211-216Google Scholar). The redundancy of their biological properties is in part explained by the shared use of the common signaling protein, gp130, in their multimeric receptors. gp130, initially isolated as an IL-6 receptor signal transducer (Hibi et al., 15Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Google Scholar), associates with other receptor components to generate high affinity type receptors for the ligands. This is the case for the gp190/low affinity LIF receptor (Gearing et al., 12Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. VandenBos T. Gimpel S.D. Delaney P.B. King J. Price V. Cosman D. Beckmann M.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2839-2848Google Scholar), which associates with gp130 to generate a functional LIF/OSM receptor (Gearing et al., 13Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J. Gimpel S.D. Thut C.J. McGourty J. Brasher K.K. King J.A. Gillis S. Mosley B. Ziegler S.F. Cosman D. Science. 1992; 255: 1434-1437Google Scholar). For the CNTF receptor, a third additional component (CNTF α receptor subunit) (Davis et al., 5Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Valenzuela D.M. Wong V.V. Furth M.E. Squinto S.P. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1991; 253: 59-63Google Scholar) interacts with the gp130-gp190 heterocomplex to generate a high affinity CNTF receptor (Davis et al., 6Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Stahl N. Pan L. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1993; 260: 1805-1808Google Scholar). The IL-6 receptor is composed of a gp130 homodimer associated with an IL-6 binding chain, gp80 (Yamasaki et al., 39Yamasaki K. Taga T. Hirato H. Kawanishi Y. Seed B. Taniguchi T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Science. 1988; 241: 825-828Google Scholar). More recently, a binding subunit for IL-11 was also isolated (Hilton et al., 16Hilton D.J. Hilton A.A. Raicevic A. Rakar S. Smith M.H.

Dimerization of the transducing subunits initiates intracellular signaling by activating members of cytokine receptor-associated tyrosine kinases, referred to as Jaks (reviewed by Ihle et al. (1995)). Both gp130 and gp190/LIF receptor can associate Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 (Stahl et al., 34Stahl N. Boulton T.G. Farruggella T. Ip N.Y. Davis S. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Ihle J. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 263: 92-95Google Scholar). The information is next relayed by a family of transcription factors known as STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription), which are activated in the cytoplasm before translocation to the nucleus (Ihle et al., 1995). IL-6 type cytokines will preferentially activate STAT-1 and STAT-3 (Stahl et al., 35Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Google Scholar; Lütticken et al., 22Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T.

Recently, a new cytokine named cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) was isolated based on its ability to induce cardiac myocyte hypertrophy (Pennica et al., 27Pennica D. King K.L. Shaw K.J. Luis E. Rullamas J. Luoh S.-M. Darbonne W.C. Knutzon D.S. Yen R. Chien K.R. Baker J.B. Wood W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1142-1146Google Scholar; Pennica et al., 29Pennica D. Swanson T.A. Shaw K.J. Kuang W.-J. Gray C. Beatty B.G. Wood W.I. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 183-189Google Scholar). Analysis of its amino acid sequence revealed some homologies with LIF and CNTF, suggesting that it belongs to the IL-6 cytokine family. Since then, additional bioactivities have been ascribed to CT-1, showing that similar to LIF, CT-1 induces the terminal differentiation of the M1 myeloid cell line, the phenotypic switch in rat sympathetic neurons, and inhibits the spontaneous differentiation of embryonic stem cells (Pennica et al., 28Pennica D. Shaw K.J. Swanson T.A. Moore M.W. Shelton D.L. Zioncheck K.A. Rosenthal A. Taga T. Paoni N.F. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10915-10922Google Scholar). Direct binding of CT-1 to gp190/LIF β receptor and the implication of gp130 as a converter protein in the mouse CT-1 receptor were also reported (Pennica et al., 28Pennica D. Shaw K.J. Swanson T.A. Moore M.W. Shelton D.L. Zioncheck K.A. Rosenthal A. Taga T. Paoni N.F. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10915-10922Google Scholar). In the present study, we have characterized the receptor subunits involved in the signaling of the human CT-1 receptor. We found that gp130 and gp190/LIF receptor associate with a third not yet identified component of 80 kDa, referred to as the CT-1 α receptor subunit (CT-1Rα), to create a triparite receptor for the cytokine. Activation of the tripartite CT-1 receptor led to the recruitment of Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2, which in turn are relayed by STAT-3 to transduce the information inside the cell. The SK-N-MC neuroblastoma, KB epidermoid carcinoma, and COS-7 cell lines from ATCC (Rockville, MD) were routinely grown in RPMI culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For the growth of the multifactor-dependent hematopoietic TF1 and DA1.a cell lines (Kitamura et al., 19Kitamura T. Tange T. Terasawa T. Chiba S. Kuwaki T. Miyagawa K. Piao Y.F. Miyazono K. Urabe A.

The L-CNTF Rec. cell line was derived by stable transfection of the L929 cell line (ATCC) with a cDNA encoding the human CNTF receptor α subcloned in a pcDNA Neo expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, Ca). Purified human recombinant LIF (108 units/mg) produced in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line, E. coli recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (108 units/mg), and IL-11 (2.5 × 106 units/mg) were kindly donated by Dr. K. Turner (Genetics Institute, Boston, MA). IL-6 (107 units/mg) and OSM (2 × 106 units/mg) were purchased from Peprotech (Canton, MA). Mouse CT-1 was produced as described previously (Pennica et al., 27Pennica D. King K.L. Shaw K.J. Luis E. Rullamas J. Luoh S.-M. Darbonne W.C. Knutzon D.S. Yen R. Chien K.R. Baker J.B. Wood W.I.

Rat CNTF was produced as a GST fusion protein by using pGEX-4T2 gene fusion vector from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden), before being cleaved with thrombin. B-T6, B-P4, B-T2, and B-R3 anti-gp130 mAbs were described in detail elsewhere (Chevalier et al., 3Chevalier S. Fourcin M. Robledo O. Wijdenes J. Pouplard-Barthelaix A. Gascan H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14764-14772Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies raised against gp130 or gp190 were bought from R & D System (Oxon, United Kingdom). Rabbit anti-Tyk2 and antibodies recognizing the carboxyl-terminal sequence of gp190 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies directed against Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 and 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine mAb were from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). mAbs recognizing STAT-1 and STAT-3 were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Cytokines were added to 104 TF1 or DA1.a myeloid cells in triplicate in the assay. Cells were incubated for 72 h before being pulsed with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine for the last 4 h of the culture (Fourcin et al., 10Fourcin M. Chevalier S. Lebrun J.J. Kelly P. Pouplard A. Wijdenes J. Gascan H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 277-280Google Scholar). The KB carcinoma cell line was plated in triplicate in 96-well plates at a concentration of 50 × 103 cells/well in 150 μl of culture medium containing serial dilutions of tested cytokines. After 48 h, the supernatants were harvested, and their IL-6 content was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Thoma et al., 37Thoma B. Bird T.A. Friend D.J. Gearing D.P. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6215-6222Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected by using the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (Robledo et al., 31Robledo O. Auguste P. Coupey L. Praloran V. Chevalier S. Pouplard A. Gascan H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1391-1399Google Scholar). After a 48-h culture period, expression and function of the transfected proteins was studied. The cDNA encoding the human gp190/LIF receptor β was in pCMX and was a kind gift of Dr. George D. Yancopoulos (Davis et al., 5Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Valenzuela D.M. Wong V.V. Furth M.E. Squinto S.P. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1991; 253: 59-63Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the human gp130 transducer was cloned by polymerase chain reaction from the U266 cell line according to the published sequences and subcloned in the pCD vector (Robledo et al., 31Robledo O. Auguste P. Coupey L. Praloran V. Chevalier S. Pouplard A. Gascan H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1391-1399Google Scholar). After stimulation, cells were lysed in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, proteinase inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 1% Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40, or Brij 96, depending on the experiments (Fourcin et al., 10Fourcin M. Chevalier S. Lebrun J.J. Kelly P. Pouplard A. Wijdenes J. Gascan H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 277-280Google Scholar). After pelleting insoluble material and after protein standardization, the supernantants were immunoprecipitated overnight. The complexes were then isolated with beads coupled to protein A, submitted to SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto an Immobilon membrane (Millipore, Bedord, MA). The membranes were subsequently incubated with the relevant primary antibody before being incubated with the appropriate second antibody labeled with peroxidase for 60 min. The reaction was visualized on an x-ray film by using the ECL reagent (Amersham, Les Ulis, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some experiments the membranes were stripped in 0.1 M HCl-glycine, pH 2.5, for 1 h and neutralized in 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, before reblotting. CT-1, LIF, and CNTF were iodinated by the two-phase method as described previously (Gascan et al., 11Gascan H. Anegon I. Praloran V. Naulet J. Godard A. Soulillou J.P. Jacques Y. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2592-2598Google Scholar). The specific activity of radiolabeled products was 2,000-9,000 cpm/fmol for CT-1, 10,000-20,000 cpm/fmol for LIF, and 6,000-10,000 cpm/fmol for CNTF. Cells (0.5-5 × 106) were incubated with the indicated concentrations of radiolabeled ligand, and the nonspecific binding component was measured by including a 100-200-fold excess of unlabeled cytokine. After a 2-h incubation at 4°C, cell-bound radioactivity was separated from the unbound fraction. Determination of affinity binding constants was performed according to Scatchard. For cross-linking experiments, 2-3 × 106 COS-7 cells, 20 × 106 SK-N-MC cells, or 200 × 106 DA1.a cells were incubated in the presence of 0.5-2 nM125I-labeled CT-1 with or without a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled cytokine. After a 2-h incubation with agitation at 4°C, cells were washed extensively and incubated for an additional 45 min at 20°C in phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM BS3 (Pierce), 1 mM EGS (Pierce), pH 8.3. After washes, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% Brij 96 as described above. Insoluble material was pelleted, and the supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In some experiments cross-linked products were immunoprecipitated overnight with anti-gp130 or anti-gp190 antibodies before electrophoresis. For the N-linked polysaccharide analysis, cross-linked material or CT-1 was incubated overnight at 37°C in the presence of 1 unit of endoglycosidase F (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) per mg of protein in 10 mM phosphate buffer, 0.5% SDS, 25 mM EDTA, 0.5% 2 β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 6, before being submitted to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In the present study we have analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation events observed in response to CT-1. The SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cell line was used for these experiments, since tyrosine phosphorylation was readily detectable in these cells. Treatment of SK-N-MC cells with CT-1 resulted in the induction of gp130 tyrosine phosphorylation and of an additional protein with a molecular mass of 190-210 kDa co-precipitating with gp130 (Fig. 1A). A similar pattern was observed after treating the cells with OSM (or LIF), suggesting that the associated protein was gp190/LIF receptor. This was confirmed by reblotting the filter with an antibody directed against gp190. A blocking antibody to gp130 was sufficient to prevent the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation in both gp130 and gp190 subunit receptors, further indicating that gp130-gp190 heterodimer formation was required to induce the phosphorylation of both receptor components (Fig. 1B). In addition, a slight decrease in gp130 electrophoresis mobility was observed upon CT-1 activation, which was probably a result of the transducer activation as reported previously for IL-3β receptor (Liu et al., 21Liu L. Cutler R.L. Mui A.L.-F. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16774-16779Google Scholar). To determine whether gp130 and gp190 were sufficient to generate a functional receptor for CT-1, reconstitution experiments using cDNAs encoding these subunits were carried out in the COS-7 cell line (Fig. 1C). Individual expression of gp130 or gp190 did not allow the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of these components by CT-1. In contrast, receptor activation was readily detectable when both subunits were co-expressed in the COS-7 cells, indicating that gp130-gp190 heterocomplex formation was essential for CT-1 signaling. Receptor activation of the IL-6/LIF family of cytokines results in immediate phosphorylation of the transduction subunits by the Jak family members. Homo- or heterodimerization of the gp130 signal transducer was shown to induce activation and recruitment of Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 (Stahl et al., 34Stahl N. Boulton T.G. Farruggella T. Ip N.Y. Davis S. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Ihle J. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 263: 92-95Google Scholar). This led us to investigate whether the Jak-Tyk kinases are involved in signaling initiated by CT-1. Fig. 2, A-C show that tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1-, Jak2-, and Tyk2-signaling proteins is induced after treatment of SK-N-MC cells by CT-1. Tyk2 phosphorylation observed in response to CT-1 is weaker than the signals detected for Jak1 and Jak2 as previously reported for the other members of the IL-6 family. Nevertheless, immunoblots of lysates revealed a clear expression of Tyk2. Thus, these data indicate that the signaling cascade induced by CT-1 is similar to that induced by the related members of the family (Guschin et al., 14Guschin D. Rogers N. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B. Watling D. Horn F. Pellegrini S. Yasukawa K. Heinrich P. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. McKerr I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1421-1429Google Scholar). Downstream signaling events were further analyzed by studying the transcription factors known as STATs, which are tyrosine-phosphorylated at the cytoplasmic level before being translocated to the nucleus. As shown in Fig. 2, D-E, stimulation of the SK-N-MC cells with CT-1 elicits activation of STAT-3 protein. We failed to detect an induction of tyrosine phosphorylation in STAT-1 after CT-1 activation (Fig. 2D), sustaining the notion of a specific recruitment of STAT-3 by CT-1. Moreover, immunoprecipitation of the gp130 receptor allowed the co-precipitation of the LIF receptor but also of some additional tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with molecular masses of 110-130 kDa and in the range of 80-90 kDa (Fig. 3A). Immunostaining of the blots with antibodies recognizing the Jak family members demonstrated that the Jak1 and Jak2 kinases could be co-precipitated with gp130, and were preassociated to gp130 in the absence of ligand. Tyk2 did not directly contact gp130 even after induction of gp130-gp190 heterodimerization (Fig. 3, D-F). Interestingly, the STAT-1 signaling protein was preassociated with gp130, but no variation in its detection or activation level could be observed after CT-1 treatment of the cells. In contrast, CT-1 stimulation induced a strong association of STAT-3 to the gp130-gp190 heterocomplex, but the detected, associated form of STAT-3 was weakly tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 3, A and C), which is in striking contrast with the status of STAT-3 directly immunoprecipitated from the cytoplasmic extract (Fig. 2E). This indicates that STAT-3 was immediately released from the transducer receptors after activation. Scatchard analysis of saturation binding data was carried out in the SK-N-MC cell line, using concentrations of CT-1 ranging from 15 pM to 5 nM. Binding of 125I-CT-1 was specific and saturable and displayed high and low affinity sites in the SK-N-MC cell line (Fig. 4A). A biphasic Scatchard plot was observed with Kd values of 400-500 pM and 4 nM, indicating approximately 1,100-1,500 and 6,000 sites per cell, respectively. To assess the binding capacity of the gp130 and gp190 components, reconstitution experiments were performed in the COS-7 cell line. gp190-transfected cells bound both radiolabeled CT-1 and LIF with an affinity constant of about 10−9M (Table I). In contrast, the expression of gp130 alone led to a receptor that failed to bind CT-1 in an efficient way, indicating that the contribution of gp130 to CT-1 binding was not essential. Co-expression of gp130 and gp190 receptor subunits in COS-7 cells gave rise to high affinity receptors for both CT-1 and LIF (Kd = 200-470 pM) (Table I and Fig. 4B), in agreement with the recruitment of the two receptor subunits to generate a functional response as observed in Fig. 1C. We further analyzed the potential cross-competitions between CT-1 and the other members of the IL-6 family of cytokines toward their receptors. The experiments were performed on the SK-N-MC cell line, which expresses functional high affinity receptors for all described cytokines belonging to this group, as shown by Scatchard analysis and tyrosine phosphorylation assays of gp130 (Fig. 5A) (Chevalier et al., 3Chevalier S. Fourcin M. Robledo O. Wijdenes J. Pouplard-Barthelaix A. Gascan H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14764-14772Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in the presence of 1 nM radiolabeled CT-1 and a 200-fold excess of the putative competitors. Fig. 5B shows that bound radioactivity was displaced by an exogeneous addition of cold CT-1 and also by LIF and OSM. Cytokines using a homodimer of gp130 in their transducing machinery, such as IL-6, IL-11, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, known to use a different receptor complex, did not interfere with CT-1 binding. As to the effect of CNTF on the binding of CT-1 to its receptor, only a slight displacement of the radiolabeled protein was observed. Reciprocal experiments conducted with 125I-CNTF confirmed that CNTF and CT-1 did not cross-compete or cross-competed only in a very marginal way, whereas competition between LIF and CNTF was observed as reported previously (Robledo et al., 31Robledo O. Auguste P. Coupey L. Praloran V. Chevalier S. Pouplard A. Gascan H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1391-1399Google Scholar) (Fig. 5C).Table IScatchard analysis of CT-1 and LIF binding to the COS-7 cell line transfected with cDNAs encoding gp130 and gp190Transfected cDNACT-1LIFKdSite number/cellKdSite number/cellpMpMNoneNDND≥6000NDgp1902900-500035196-4217615006100gp130NDND≥6000NDgp130 + gp190208-4771347-6990706310 Open table in a new tab Fig. 5OSM and LIF displace CT-1 binding from its receptor. A, SK-N-MC cells were treated for 10 min with 50 ng/ml of the different cytokines of the IL-6 family as indicated. gp130 tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed as described in Fig. 1A, except that cell lysis was done in the presence of 1% TX100, and immunoprecipitation was performed by using B-T2 mAb, which allowed the precipitation of gp130 only. B, 3.5 × 106 SK-N-MC cells were incubated in triplicate in the presence of 0.6 nM radiolabeled CT-1 and a 200-fold excess of unlabeled competitors for 2 h at 4°C. Bound radioactivity was separated from the unbound fraction by centrifugation on an oil cushion, and the specific binding component was measured with a γ counter. C, the CNTF radioreceptor assay was developed as in B, but by using radiolabeled CNTF instead of radiolabeled CT-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next employed cross-linking of iodinated CT-1 to the SK-N-MC cell surface to determine whether the cytokine directly contacted gp130 and gp190. Three labeled bands were detected corresponding to the molecular masses of 190-210 kDa, 130-150 kDa, and 80 kDa (Fig. 6A). The identity of two higher molecular mass bands was confirmed by immunoprecipitating the cross-linked products with antibodies raised against either gp190 or gp130. Similar patterns were obtained, demonstrating that gp190 and gp130 were components of the cross-linked products (Fig. 6B). In addition, gp130, gp190, and gp80 remained associated, showing that these proteins tightly interacted to generate a tripartite complex. The observed bands were competed by an excess of unlabeled CT-1 or LIF, which is consistent with the results obtained in the radioreceptor experiments (Fig. 5A). Similar experiments using radiolabeled LIF were also carried out, and using these experimental procedures a single band that corresponded to gp190 (190-210 kDa) and was competed by an excess of LIF or CT-1 was observed (data not shown). To rule out the possibility of the 80-kDa band representing a degradation product of the gp130 or gp190 components, the experiments were performed in the presence of protease inhibitors. In additional experiments, incubation times with the cross-linking agents were increased up to 2 h, and an aliquot of the samples was incubated at 37°C for 24 h before being electrophoresed and compared with the conventional preparations. No variation in the ratio of the three cross-linked components could be observed, showing that gp80 did not result from a proteolytic fragmentation of gp130 or gp190 (data not shown). In addition, gp130 and gp190 were activated in the presence of CT-1 separated on SDS-PAGE and blotted as described in Fig. 1A. Staining of the membranes with polyclonal antibodies recognizing either gp130 or gp190 did not show a signal in the range of 80 kDa, indicating that the identified protein was not a clipped or a soluble product of the transducing receptor components (data not shown). The 80-kDa subunit of the CT-1 receptor was further characterized by analyzing its carbohydrate content after removing the N-linked sugars from the protein backbone. A preliminary experiment indicated that N-linked polysaccharides account for 2-3 kDa of the CT-1 molecular mass (Fig. 6C, right part), which is in agreement with the presence of a single potential N-glycosylation site in the CT-1 sequence (Pennica et al., 27Pennica D. King K.L. Shaw K.J. Luis E. Rullamas J. Luoh S.-M. Darbonne W.C. Knutzon D.S. Yen R. Chien K.R. Baker J.B. Wood W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1142-1146Google Scholar). Treatment of the 125I-CT-1 cross-linked receptor subunits with endoglycosidase F led, as expected, to a faster electrophoretic mobility of the products. Nevertheless, only a slight shift in gp190/LIF receptor molecular weight was detected, although 20 potential N-glycosylation sites are present in its amino acid sequence (Gearing et al., 12Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. VandenBos T. Gimpel S.D. Delaney P.B. King J. Price V. Cosman D. Beckmann M.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2839-2848Google Scholar). This result suggests that either the enzyme digestion was incomplete or that electrophoresis resolution was not sufficient to fully discern a molecular weight shift for large proteins. After treatment of gp130 with endoglycosidase F, a molecular mass of 100-110 kDa was observed as previously reported (Taga et al., 36Taga T. Hibi M. Hirata Y. Yamasaki K. Yasukawa K. Matsuda T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1989; 58: 573-581Google Scholar). Interestingly, the polysaccharide moiety of the CT-1 receptor α subunit represented about 35 kDa, leading to an N-deglycosylated protein with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa. The COS-7 cell line expresses functional high affinity binding sites for CT-1, when cotransfected with cDNAs encoding gp130 and gp190 (Fig. 4B and Table I). In order to determine whether the 80-kDa component was present in the COS-7 cell line, cross-linking experiments were conducted in the COS-7 cells transfected with the appropriate cDNAs. In the nontransfected cells or in COS-7 cells transfected with a cDNA encoding gp130, a slight cross-linking of CT-1 to endogeneous LIFRβ could be observed in some instances (Fig. 7A). Introduction of gp190 allowed a clear detection of CT-1 associated to LIFRβ."

The amplified cDNA fragment was then used as probe to screen a human renal cancer cell cDNA library. The isolated cDNA clone contained an open reading frame encoding 423 amino acids including all of the peptides that were sequenced.

Northern blot analysis demonstrated that a 1.9-kilobase mRNA was unique to renal cancer cells. When the cDNA was inserted into the expression vector pSVK3 and transfected into COS-1 cells, galactosylceramide sulfotransferase activity in the transfected cells increased from 8- to 16-fold over that of controls, and the enzyme product, sulfatide, was expressed on the transformed cells.

Sulfoglycolipids are a class of acidic glycolipids containing sulfate esters on their oligosaccharide chains which were originally found in the human brain by Thudichum (1Thudichum J.L.W. A Treatise on the Chemical Constitution of the Brain. Balliere,, London1884Google Scholar). Sulfoglycolipids are abundant in myelin, spermatozoa, kidney, and small intestine (for review, see Ref. 2Makita A. Taniguchi N. Wiegandt H. New Comprehensive Biochemistry. 10. Elsevier, Amsterdam1985: 1-99Google Scholar) and have been implicated in a variety of physiological functions through their interactions with extracellular matrix proteins, cellular adhesive receptors, blood coagulation systems, complement activation systems, cation transport systems, and microorganisms (for a review, see Ref. 3Vos J.P.

We have demonstrated that GalCer sulfotransferase activity is remarkably enhanced in human renal cell carcinoma (4Sakakibara N. Gasa S. Kamio K. Makita A. Koyanagi T. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 335-339Google Scholar, 5Kobayashi T. Honke K. Kamio K. Sakakibara N. Gasa S. Miyao N. Tsukamoto T. Ishizuka I. Miyazaki T. Makita A. Br. J. Cancer. 1993; 67: 76-80Google Scholar) and that the sulfotransferase level in cancer cells is raised by the action of epidermal growth factor (6Kobayashi T. Honke K. Gasa S. Kato N. Miyazaki T. Makita A. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 448-452Google Scholar), transforming growth factor-α (7Kobayashi T. Honke K. Gasa S. Imai S. Tanaka J. Miyazaki T. Makita A.

Biochem. 1994; 219: 407-413Google Scholar). Furthermore, tyrosine kinases have been shown to be involved in the expression of sulfotransferase in cancer cells (9Balbaa M. Honke K. Makita A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 141-145Google Scholar). Previously, we purified GalCer sulfotransferase to apparent homogeneity from human renal cancer cells (10Honke K. Yamane M. Ishii A. Kobayashi T. Makita A. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 421-427Google Scholar). Not only GalCer but also lactosylceramide, galactosyl 1-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol, and galactosyl diacylglycerol served as good acceptors for the purified enzyme. Now we have cloned a cDNA encoding the human GalCer sulfotransferase on the basis of the partial amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme. This is the first report on gene cloning of glycolipid sulfotransferase. GalCer sulfotransferase was purified from 1 × 1010 cells from a human renal cell carcinoma cell line, SMKT-R3 (11Miyao N. Tsukamoto T. Kumamoto Y. Urol. Res. 1989; 17: 317-324Google Scholar) using a method described previously (10Honke K. Yamane M. Ishii A. Kobayashi T. Makita A. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 421-427Google Scholar). The purified sulfotransferase (10 μg) was reduced and S-pyridylethylated. The treated enzyme was applied to a reversed phase HPLC column (Cosmosil 5C4-AR-300, 4.6 × 50 mm, Nacalai tesque, Japan) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-70% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Following digestion of the isolated enzyme with lysylendopeptidase (Achromobacter protease I, Wako, Japan), the hydrolysate was subjected to another reversed phase HPLC column (Aquapore OD-300, 7 μm, 1.0 × 250 mm, Applied Biosystems) and eluted with the solvent system described above. The NH2-terminal sequence analysis of separated peptides was performed by automated Edman degradation using a protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems 492). Based on the amino acid sequence of peptides (Table I) derived from the purified GalCer sulfotransferase, degenerate oligonucleotides of both sense and antisense strands were synthesized with deoxyinosine substitution (Applied Biosystems 392) as indicated in Table II. These oligonucleotides served as primers for RT-PCR analysis using total RNA from SMKT-R3 cells. A reverse transcriptase reaction was performed at 37°C for 1 h using 50 pmol of oligo(dT) primers, 2 μg of total RNA, a 0.5 mM concentration of each dNTP, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II, Life Technologies, Inc.) in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture of the following PCR contained 4-μl aliquots of the reverse transcriptase reaction solution, 100 pmol of each primer, a 0.25 mM concentration of each dNTP, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1. 5 mM MgCl2, and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) in a final volume of 50 μl. The reactions were subjected to 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 45-55°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 1-2 min. After agarose electrophoresis of the PCR products, DNA fragments were excised, subcloned into pT7Blue vector (Novagen), and sequenced as described below.Table IAmino acid sequence data for peptides from human renal cancer cell GalCer sulfotransferasePeptideAmino acid sequenceP1TASSTLLNILFRFGQKP2KPWESMAKP3SILGYNLKP4LSAGDKP5LNALNDXPVP6HRLKP7FILDFLEX Open table in a new tab Table IIOligonucleotide primers for the cDNA clone isolation experiments using PCROligonucleotideNucleotide sequence1Sa5′-ACIGCITCITCIACICT-3′1Sb5′-ACIGCIAGTTCIACICT-3′C1Sc5′-ACIGCITCIAGTACICT-3′C1Sd5′-ACIGCIAGTAGTACICT-3′C C1A5′-TTTTGICCAAAICGAAA-3′C G G2Sa5′-AAACCITGIGAATCIATGG-3′G G2Sb5′-AAACCITGIGAAAGTATGG-3′G G C2Aa5′-TIGCCATIGATTCICAIGG-3′C2Ab5′-TIGCCATACTTTCICAIGG-3′G C3S5′-ATTCTIGGITATAATCTITATAA-3′C C C C3A5′-TTATAIAGATTATAICCIAGAAT-3′G G G G Open table in a new tab Total RNA was extracted from SMKT-R3 cells, and poly(A)+ RNA was purified with oligo(dT)-latex (Oligotex-dT30, Roche). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized using a cDNA synthesis kit (SuperScript Choice System, Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, the first cDNA strand was synthesized by reverse transcription of the poly(A)+ RNA with oligo(dT) primers. After synthesis of the second strand, the double-stranded cDNA was ligated with an EcoRI adapter. Then, the EcoRI-adapted cDNA was ligated to EcoRI-digested λgt10 and subsequently packaged in vitro (Ready-To-Go Lambda Packaging Kit, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Based on the sequence of the PCR products using primer sets 1Sd and 1A, mixed oligonucleotides (5′-TTCTGGCCA/GAAGCGGAACAGGATGTTGAGCAGCGTA/GCTA/GCTCGCCGT-3′), termed OP1, were synthesized and labeled at their 3′-ends with terminal transferase using a DIG Oligonucleotide Tailing Kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Southern hybridization of RT-PCR products was carried out at 55°C for 4 h with a nylon membrane (Boehringer Mannheim) in a hybridization buffer containing 2 pmol/ml digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probe, 5 × SSC, 1% blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.1% N-laurylsarcosine, and 0.02% SDS. The detection procedure was carried out with a DIG luminescent detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 2 × 105 recombinant phages were screened by plaque hybridization with a digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe (see “Results”) which had been synthesized using a DIG RNA labeling kit with T7 RNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). Hybridization was carried out at 50°C overnight with a nylon membrane (Boehringer Mannheim) in a hybridization buffer containing 1 ng of digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe/cm2 of membrane, 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 2% blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.1% N-laurylsarcosine, and 0.02% SDS. Six λ phage clones were picked up from positive plaques, and the inserted cDNAs were subcloned into pBluescript (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan) by EcoRI digestion. The subcloned DNAs were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using Taq DNA polymerase (dye terminator cycle sequencing kit, Perkin-Elmer) with a DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems 373A). Ten μg of total RNA from SMKT-R3, THP-1 (human monocytic leukemia), GOTO (human neuroblastoma), and HT-1080 (human fibrosarcoma) cells were denatured in 50% (v/v) formamide, 6% (v/v) formaldehyde, 20 mM MOPS (pH 7.0) at 65°C, electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Boehringer Mannheim). A digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe was synthesized from the 0.64-kilobase SacII-fragment of pBS-hCST1 (nucleotides 425-1065 in Fig. 1) using a DIG high prime kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The membrane was hybridized with the DNA probe at 50°C. Other methods were the same as those used for the plaque hybridization. pBS-hCST1 was digested with EcoRI, and the inserted DNA was ligated into the EcoRI site of expression vector pSVK3 (Pharmacia). The direction of the inserted sequence was determined by the restriction enzyme map. COS-1 cells (2 × 105) precultured for 1 day in a 35-mm-diameter dish were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 72 h, the cells were washed twice with 2 ml of cold Tris-buffered saline, harvested with 0.2 ml of Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 using a silicon scraper, sonicated on ice, and assayed for GalCer sulfotransferase activity (12Kawano M. Honke K. Tachi M. Gasa S. Makita A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 9-15Google Scholar) and protein concentration (BCA protein assay kit, Pierce). To examine the expression of sulfatide on the COS-1 cells transfected with the cDNA, the cells (1 × 104) were transfected with 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA and 1 μl of LipofectAMINE in a Lab-Tek chamber slide (Nunc Inc.). After 48 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with an anti-sulfatide monoclonal antibody, Sulph I (13Fredman P. Mattsson L. Andersson K. Davidsson P. Ishizuka I. Jeansson S. Månsson J.-E. Svennerholm L. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 17-22Google Scholar), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Each incubation was for 45 min. Labeled cells were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). A Zeiss Axiophot with epi-illumination for fluorescence was used for fluorescence and phase microscopy. To determine a partial amino acid sequence, purified GalCer sulfotransferase was digested with lysylendopeptidase, and the hydrolysates were isolated on a reversed phase HPLC column. Amino acid sequences determined for seven peptides are shown in Table I. Based on the amino acid sequences of three peptides, P1, P2, and P3, we synthesized degenerate oligonucleotides for sense and antisense primers (Table II). To reduce the primer combinations, deoxyinosine was substituted in positions where the codon degeneration exceeded 2; and the frequently used codon, CTX, was employed for leucine. For each serine residue, we prepared primer combinations of two codon types: TCX and AGC/T. Oligonucleotides 1S(a-d) and 1A were synthesized on the basis of the amino- and the carboxyl-terminal sequences, respectively, of P1. Four possible pairs of sense (1Sa-1Sd) and antisense (1A) primers were first used in RT-PCR analysis with total RNA from human renal cancer cells, SMKT-R3, as the template. The pair of 1Sd and 1A primer sets produced a cDNA fragment of 47 bp, corresponding to the length estimated from the amino acid sequence of P1. When the fragment was subcloned and sequenced, the deduced amino acid sequence coincided with that of P1. Then, we synthesized a mixed oligonucleotide probe (OP1) based on the sequence of the 47-bp cDNA fragment for Southern hybridization of RT-PCR products. In the RT-PCR products using primer sets of 2Sa and 3A, a band of 600 bp was hybridized with the OP1 probe. Based on sequencing analysis, the 600-bp fragment included the sequence encoding P1 and P4, suggesting that the fragment was a part of the target gene. However, we later recognized that the 600-bp fragment lacked nucleotides 304-425 and 825-1291 sequences of the cloned cDNA (Fig. 1A) and contained an aberrant sequence of 70 nucleotides. The reason for the discrepancy is not clear at present. We have screened a λgt10 cDNA library made from SMKT-R3 cells using a digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe synthesized from the above described 600-bp cDNA fragment. Six positive clones were isolated from 2 × 105 plaques and subcloned into pBluescript. The nucleotide sequence of the largest cDNA insert (1.8 kilobases), termed pBS-hCST1, was determined. DNA sequencing analysis revealed that the cDNA consisted of 1791 nucleotides with a putative initiator codon at 204 and a TGA stop codon at 1473, having an open reading frame encoding 423 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 48,763 Da. A putative polyadenylation signal was located at nucleotide 1761 followed by poly(A) tracts. The 1801-bp cDNA length is highly consistent with the mRNA size observed in SMKT-R3 cells (Fig. 2), indicating that the cDNA is nearly full-length. The deduced amino acid sequence contained two potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Fig. 1A). Since the renal cancer GalCer sulfotransferase bound to lectin columns such as concanavalin A- and wheat germ agglutinin-agarose, 2K. Honke and A. Makita, unpublished observations. the enzyme may be modified by N-linked oligosaccharide chain(s). If the enzyme protein possesses two N-linked oligosaccharide chains, the molecular mass will agree with that of the purified protein, which is 54 kDa, observed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10Honke K. Yamane M. Ishii A. Kobayashi T. Makita A. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 421-427Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence included all of the amino acid sequences obtained from the purified protein. A hydropathy plot analysis revealed one prominent hydrophobic segment in the amino-terminal region (Fig. 1B), predicting that this protein has type II transmembrane topology, as has been the case for all glycoconjugate sulfotransferases and most glycosyltransferases cloned to date. One of the peptides obtained, P2 (Lys7-Lys14), is nearer the amino terminus than the putative transmembrane domain (Gly15-Leu37), an observation that is in accordance with the enzyme having been purified from the membrane fraction (10Honke K. Yamane M. Ishii A. Kobayashi T. Makita A. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 421-427Google Scholar). The total GC content of the coding region was high (65.5%). A Northern blot of total RNA from human cultured cells, renal cell carcinoma (SMKT-R3), monocytic leukemia (THP-1), neuroblastoma (GOTO), and fibrosarcoma (HT-1080), was hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled (−) strand DNA probe made from the sulfotransferase cDNA. As shown in Fig. 2, a transcript of 1.9 kilobases was observed in SMKT-R3 cells, whereas no bands were detected in the other human cancer cells. To demonstrate that the isolated cDNA clone encodes GalCer sulfotransferase, the cDNA was inserted into a mammalian expression vector, pSVK3, and overexpressed in COS-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, COS-1 cells transfected with the cloned cDNA (pSV-hCST) showed sulfotransferase activity 16 times higher than those transfected with the pSVK3 vector and eight times higher than those transfected with the plasmid in which the cDNA had been inserted in the opposite direction (pSV-hCSTR). To determine whether the transfected cells express sulfatide, the product of GalCer sulfotransferase, the cells were visualized immunocytochemically with an anti-sulfatide monoclonal antibody, Sulph I. Some of the pSV-hCST-transfected cells displayed surface immunofluorescence, whereas control cells did not exhibit marked staining (Fig. 3B). This observation indicates that the cDNA can serve as a template for the synthesis of sulfoglycolipids in cells. The types of sulfoglycolipids synthesized in the transformed cells remain to be determined. We have cloned a cDNA that encodes human GalCer sulfotransferase. Several lines of evidence indicate that the cloned cDNA corresponds to the GalCer sulfotransferase purified previously from human renal cancer cells: (a) the predicted sequence of the protein contains all seven peptides obtained from the purified enzyme protein; (b) when the cDNA was introduced into a eukaryotic expression vector and transfected into COS-1 cells, the enzyme activity expressed exceeded that in controls by 8-16-fold; and (c) the characteristics of the predicted protein are consistent with those of the purified protein in terms of molecular mass and membrane localization. Sulfonation is an important pathway in the metabolism of many drugs, xenobiotics, hormones, and neurotransmitters. Sulfotransferases involved in this process are cytosolic enzymes and a number of cDNA clones coding for these sulfotransferases have been isolated (for a review, see Ref. 14Her C. Raftogianis R. Weinshilboum M. Genomics. 1996; 33: 409-420Google Scholar). These cytosolic sulfotransferases, including plant flavonol sulfotransferases, show considerable homology and have been classified into three families on the basis of their amino acid sequences (14Her C. Raftogianis R. Weinshilboum M. Genomics. 1996; 33: 409-420Google Scholar). However, Golgi sulfotransferases functioning in the sulfonation of glycosaminoglycans, N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (15Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Google Scholar–17Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Google Scholar) and chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase (18Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18575-18580Google Scholar), have little homology with the cytosolic sulfotransferases. There is no significant homology between N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase and chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase (18Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18575-18580Google Scholar). The present GalCer sulfotransferase showed homology to neither the cytosolic sulfotransferases nor the Golgi sulfotransferases. These observations suggest that GalCer sulfotransferase has an evolutionary origin different from that of the other sulfotransferases. Based on a modification with pyridoxal phosphate, we suggested previously that lysine residue(s) may be involved in the PAPS binding site of human GalCer sulfotransferase (19Kamio K. Honke K. Makita A. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 762-766Google Scholar). Hashimoto et al. (15Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Google Scholar) noted a putative PAPS binding motif in sulfotransferases, GXXGXXK, which resembles the P-loop nucleotide binding motif for ATP- and GTP-binding proteins, and this motif is actually conserved near the COOH terminus of many sulfotransferases cloned to date (20Chiba H. Komatsu K. Lee Y.C. Tomizuka T. Strott C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8176-8179Google Scholar). However, there was no such sequence in GalCer sulfotransferase. The conserved motif, YPKSGT(T/N) W, which is located in the NH2-terminal portion of cytosolic sulfotransferases and bacterial sulfotransferases and has been suggested to be a PAPS binding site (21Marsolais F. Varin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30458-30463Google Scholar), was not present in GalCer sulfotransferase. Another candidate for the PAPS binding motif, LEKCGR, which has been demonstrated in arylsulfotransferase IV by affinity labeling with ATP dialdehyde (22Zheng Y. Bergold A. Duffel M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30313-30319Google Scholar), was also absent from GalCer sulfotransferase. Accordingly, we plan to continue the search for another PAPS binding motif in GalCer sulfotransferase. Since there is only one in-frame ATG codon upstream from the sequence of the P2 peptide, which is the most upstream peptide obtained, in the open reading frame, we identified the initiation codon a priori. Compared with the consensus eukaryotic translation initiation sequence (23Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Google Scholar), the most important purine, which is at the −3 position, is conserved. The putative hydrophobic transmembrane domain of GalCer sulfotransferase contains 23 amino acid residues with cationic borders characteristic of type II transmembrane proteins. From the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA, we deduced the amino acid sequence of GalCer sulfotransferase, showed it to consist of 423 amino acids, and calculated a molecular mass of 48,763 Da. Considering the two N-glycosylation sites, the 54-kDa purified human enzyme (10Honke K. Yamane M. Ishii A. Kobayashi T. Makita A. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 421-427Google Scholar) appears to reflect the size of the mature enzyme. However, the sizes of the GalCer sulfotransferases from rat kidney (24Tennekoon G. Aitchison S. Zaruba M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 932-944Google Scholar) and testis (25Sakac D. Zachos M. Lingwood C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1655-1659Google Scholar), 64 and 56 kDa, respectively, are too large. On the other hand, the 31 kDa of the mouse brain enzyme (26Sundaram K.S. Lev M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24041-24044Google Scholar) is too small. Although the reason for these discrepancies is unknown, possibilities include species differences and the existence of isozymes. On Northern analysis, transcripts of GalCer sulfotransferase were detected only in SMKT-R3 cells. When we measured the sulfotransferase activity of various human cell lines, this sulfotransferase was detectable only in renal cancer cells (5Kobayashi T. Honke K. Kamio K. Sakakibara N. Gasa S. Miyao N. Tsukamoto T. Ishizuka I. Miyazaki T. Makita A. Br. J. Cancer. 1993; 67: 76-80Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the high sulfotransferase activity in renal cancer cells is based on a high level of the gene expression. Future studies will be directed at elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of sulfotransferase expression in human renal cancer cells. It is also of particular interest to ascertain what causes the tissue-specific expression of sulfoglycolipids. In addition, experimental manipulation of sulfotransferase expression may clarify the physiological role of sulfoglycolipids in various biological processes such as myelination and fertilization. We thank Dr. Taiji Tsukamoto, Sapporo Medical University, for providing SMKT-R3 cells. We acknowledge gratefully the generous gift of the Sulph I antibody from Dr. Pam Fredman, Göterborg University, Sweden.

Methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFS) is the only enzyme known to metabolize 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and catalyzes the conversion of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate. In order to address the function of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate in mammalian cells, intracellular 5-formyltetrahydrofolate levels were depleted in human 5Y neuroblastoma by overexpressing the human cDNA encoding MTHFS (5YMTHFS cells). When cultured with 2 mM exogenous glycine, the intracellular serine and glycine concentrations in 5YMTHFS cells are elevated approximately 3-fold relative to 5Y cells; 5YMTHFS cells do not contain measurable levels of free methionine and display a 30-40% decrease in cell proliferation rates compared with 5Y cells. Medium supplemented with pharmacological levels of exogenous folinate or methionine ameliorated the glycine induced growth inhibition. Analysis of the folate derivatives demonstrated that 5-methyltetrahydrofolate accounts for 30% of total cellular folate in 5Y cells when cultured with 5 mM exogenous glycine. 5YMTHFS cells do not contain detectable levels of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate under the same culture conditions. These results suggest that 5-formyltetrahydrofolate inhibits serine hydroxymethyltransferase activity in vivo and that serine synthesis and homocysteine remethylation compete for one-carbon units in the cytoplasm.

Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14227-14233Google Scholar). The only enzyme known to metabolize 5-CHO-H4PteGlu is MTHFS, an enzyme that catalyzes the ATP-dependent and irreversible conversion of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu to 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu. In rabbit liver, MTHFS is located in the cytoplasm (2Maras B. Stover P. Valiante S. Barra D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18429-18433Google Scholar), whereas human liver contains 85% of the MTHFS activity in the cytoplasm and 15% in the mitochondria (3Bertrand R. Beauchemin M. Dayan A. Ouimet M. Jolivet J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 245-249Google Scholar). The combined enzymatic activities of MTHFS and SHMT constitute a futile cycle that may buffer cellular 5-CHO-H4PteGlu concentrations and regulate SHMT activity (Scheme 1) (4Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Google Scholar). 5-formyltetrahydrofolate tetrahydrofolate 10-formyltetrahydrofolate 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate 5-methyltetrahydrofolate serine hydroxymethyltransferase cytoplasmic SHMT mitochondrial SHMT methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase glycine cleavage system SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma high pressure liquid chromatography Chinese hamster ovary cells morpholineethanesulfonic acid minimal essential medium phosphate-buffered saline. Cytoplasmic one-carbon metabolism is responsible for the synthesis of purines, thymidylate, and methionine and numerous subsequent S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation reactions (Scheme 1). There is accumulating evidence that mitochondrial folate metabolism is primarily responsible for the generation of formate and that mitochondrial derived formate is the source of one-carbon units required for cytoplasmic folate-dependent anabolic reactions (5Appling D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Google Scholar) (Scheme 1). The major source of one-carbon units in the form of formate are generated from serine in a reaction catalyzed by mSHMT, but formate can also be generated in the mitochondria from glycine in cells that contain a GCS. Recently, it has been demonstrated that glycine is the major source of one-carbon units in kidney proximal tubules, cells that also contain a GCS (6Cowin G.J. Willgoss D.A. Bartley J. Endre Z.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1310: 32-40Google Scholar). The role of mitochondria in generating one-carbon units for cytoplasmic folate metabolism suggests that cSHMT may not play a major role in the generation of one-carbon units. In fact, there is accumulating evidence that cSHMT is not an efficient source of one-carbon units for cytoplasmic metabolism (Scheme 1). Recent studies of Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) that lack mSHMT activity have demonstrated that CHO cells deficient in mSHMT activity accumulate 15-fold increased intracellular serine concentrations over wild type CHO cells, and CHO cells lacking mSHMT activity are auxotrophic for glycine. Despite the accumulation of intracellular serine, the net metabolic flux through the cSHMT enzyme in CHO cells deficient in mSHMT activity is in the direction of serine synthesis (7Narkewicz M.R. Sauls S.D. Tjoa S.S. Fennessey P.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 991-996Google Scholar). Therefore, the primary role of cSHMT may not be to generate glycine or one-carbon units but instead may have other metabolic functions including the synthesis of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu. Although little is known about the regulation of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu, it has been reported that valproic acid treatment lowers the intracellular concentration of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu in fetuses (8Wegner C. Nau H. Neurology. 1992; 42: 17-24Google Scholar). In humans, valproic acid treatment is also associated with an increased incidence of neural tube defects, a disorder associated with folic acid status and elevated plasma homocysteine (9Scott J.M. Weir D.G. Kirke P.N. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Dekker, New York1995: 329-360Google Scholar). 5-CHO-H4PteGlu is a potent inhibitor of several folate-dependent enzymes including phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxamide formyltransferase and SHMT and may regulate folic acid-dependent metabolic pathways (4Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Google Scholar). 5-CHO-H4PteGlu polyglutamates are slow tight binding inhibitors of SHMT and therefore may have a significant physiological relevance because slow binding inhibitors are generally more effective enzyme inhibitors in vivo (10Stover P. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1543-1550Google Scholar). Inhibition of SHMT in vivo may be a mechanism whereby cells regulate not only folate-dependent glycine synthesis but also the supply of one-carbon units required for purine and thymidylate synthesis as well as homocysteine remethylation. In order to determine the influence of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu depletion on folic acid-mediated one-carbon metabolism and SHMT activity, we have overexpressed the human MTHFS cDNA in 5Y neuroblastoma and determined its effects on cell proliferation, intracellular serine, glycine and methionine concentrations, and the relative distribution of the folic acid one-carbon derivatives. (6S)-[3H]Folinic acid (40 Ci/mmol) was obtained from New England Nuclear. 5-CHO-H4PteGlu, MES, HEPES, and ATP were purchased from Sigma. Other chemicals were reagent grade. Fetal bovine serum, minimal essential medium (MEM), and its alpha modification (αMEM) lacking sodium bicarbonate, ribosides, ribotides, deoxyribosides, and deoxyribotides were obtained from Hyclone Laboratories, Inc. Geneticin was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The full-length human MTHFS cDNA was subcloned into the XhoI/XbaI site of pcDNA3 (11Dayan A. Bertrand R. Beauchemin M. Chahla D. Mamo A. Filion M. Skup D. Massie B. Jolivet J. Gene (Asmt.). 1995; 165: 307-311Google Scholar). The pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) utilizes the human cytomegalovirus major intermediate early promoter/enhancer and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal. A neomycin resistance marker expressed from the SV40 early promoter allows for selection of stable transformants in the presence of G418 sulfate. The human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, a subline of the SK-N-SH neuroblastoma, were obtained from Dr. June Biedler (Fordham University) (12Ross R.A. Spengler B.A. Biedler J.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1983; 71: 741-747Google Scholar). The cells are nearly diploid, have biochemical and morphological properties of fetal noradrenergic neurons, and have been demonstrated to have a functional glycine cleavage system (13Kohl R.L. Perez-Polo J.R. Quay W.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1980; 5: 271-280Google Scholar). The defined culture medium (αMEM) lacks glycine, serine, methionine, hypoxanthine, thymidine, and folate and allows variation in the concentration of nutrients with relevance to folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism. For all experiments, the fetal bovine serum was depleted of folic acid and other small molecules by dialysis at 4°C over a 24-h period against a 12-fold excess of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with buffer changes every 4 h. The serum was then charcoal-treated to remove any remaining folic acid. G418 sulfate was supplemented into the medium for selection of stable cell colonies that integrated the MTHFS construction. The MTHFS construction (15 μg) was linearized with PvuI and transfected into 1 × 107 5Y neuroblastoma by electroporation (0.22 kV, 950 microfarad, Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II). Cells were cultured in αMEM with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 24-48 h prior to the addition of 500 μg/ml G418 sulfate for selection of stable integrants. The cells were incubated in a 5% CO2 enriched, 37°C incubator until single stable colonies formed. Over 20 colonies formed and exhibited resistance to G418 sulfate, and 6 were isolated and passaged until a stable line was generated. The relative distribution of the one-carbon forms of H4PteGlu was performed by modification of previously reported procedures (14Trent D.F. Seither R.L. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1015-1020Google Scholar, 15Osborne C.B. Lowe K.E. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21657-21664Google Scholar, 16Horne D.W. Briggs W.T. Wagner C. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 393-397Google Scholar). Cells were passaged through three population doublings in αMEM without folate and supplemented with 200 μM glycine, 20 μM hypoxanthine, and 10 μM thymidine to deplete intracellular folate. Cells were labeled with [3H]folinic acid by plating at mid to late log phase (4 × 107 cells) on 100-mm dishes containing 3 ml of αMEM supplemented with 50 nM [3H]folinic acid (20 Ci/mmol) for 24-36 h. Following incubation, cell monolayers were washed with PBS until the wash contained less than 500 cpm/ml. Cells were harvested in buffer containing 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM ascorbate, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5. Cell extracts were boiled for 5 min, cooled to 4°C, and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. Folate polyglutamates were converted to monoglutamates by incubation with rat serum at pH 7.0 for 3 h (15Osborne C.B. Lowe K.E. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21657-21664Google Scholar). H4PteGlu, 10-CHO-H4PteGlu, 5-CHO-H4PteGlu, and 5-CH3-H4PteGlu standards were added to the sample prior to HPLC analysis. The various folate derivatives were separated using a Shimadzu HPLC equipped with a diode-array spectrophotometric detector using a C18 column (3.9 × 300 mm, 10 mm) and tetrabutylammonium phosphate/ethanol gradient as described previously (15Osborne C.B. Lowe K.E. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21657-21664Google Scholar), and 1-ml fractions were collected into scintillation vials. The fractions containing radioactivity were identified by comparison with the diode-array chromatogram and the absorbance spectra of the internal standards. The elution times were: p-aminobenzylglutamate, 9 min; 10-CHO-H4PteGlu, 17 min; H4PteGlu, 24 min; 5-CHO-H4PteGlu, 36 min; and 5-CH3-H4PteGlu, 42 min. The MTHFS enzyme activities were quantified by measuring the increase in absorbance at 360 nm due to the formation of 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu. The assay was initiated by incubating 300 μl of cell extract with 700 μl of reaction buffer (100 mM MES, 0.5% Triton X-100, 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM ATP, 150 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM (6R,6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu, pH 6.3). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry. Growth studies were performed to determine the effects of glycine, methionine, and folic acid on 5Y and 5YMTHFS cell proliferation rates. Cells were grown in αMEM/dialyzed fetal bovine serum lacking folate and passaged for three population doublings to deplete cells of intracellular folate. Following folate depletion, 1 × 105 cells were seeded into 15-mm wells at various glycine, methionine, and folate concentrations. Cells were harvested every 2 days and counted using a hemocytometer until at least three population doublings were observed. Cell viability was assessed by the ability of cells to exclude trypan blue. Free amino acids were isolated by a modification of a previously described procedure (17Hashimoto A. Nishikawa T. Oka T. Takahashi K. Hayashi T. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 582: 41-48Google Scholar). The medium was removed, and the cell monolayers were washed three times with 10 ml of PBS. The cells were harvested from 100-mm plates using a cell scraper after the addition of 300 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid. Cell extracts were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and vortexed to ensure complete cell lysis. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatants were transferred to new microcentrifuge tubes, and the trichloroacetic acid was removed by extraction with water-saturated diethyl ether. The aqueous solution containing the free amino acids was vacuum dried overnight. The free amino acids were derivatized with o-phthaldialdehyde, and the amino acid concentrations were determined at the Cornell Biotechnology Analytical/Synthesis Facility. Amino acid concentrations were determined relative to cell number, protein concentration, and intracellular valine concentrations. All methods gave similar relative results. 5Y and 5YMTHFS cell pellets were suspended and lysed by sonication then incubated at 100°C for 10 min in buffer containing 2% SDS, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 60 mM Tris, pH 6.8. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out using a 5% stacking gel and a 8% separating gel in a slab gel apparatus (Hoefer, San Francisco, CA) with the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli. Proteins were transferred overnight to a polyvinylidene difloride membrane (Millipore) in a Bio-Rad Transblot apparatus at 30 V with a limit of 0.2 mA. The membrane was rinsed with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS and blocked for 10 h with 1% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS. Sheep anti-human MTHFS antiserum was generated from Chiron Mimotopes (San Diego, CA) using synthetic peptides representing amino acids 2-28 in the human MTHFS protein. The serum was diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer, and the membrane was incubated in the buffer for 15 h at 4°C. The membrane was rinsed six times with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS and incubated for 23 h with blocking buffer containing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-sheep IgG antibody in a 1:6000 dilution. The membrane was visualized using the SuperSignal™ chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate system from Pierce. 5-CHO-H4PteGlu is the only derivative of H4PteGlu that does not have a known metabolic function. In order to determine the role of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu in mammalian metabolism and the metabolic consequences associated with its depletion in the cell, the human MTHFS cDNA was overexpressed in 5Y neuroblastoma. Over 20 neomycin-resistant colonies formed, and six colonies were isolated and passaged until stable cell populations were obtained. All transformants have remained viable for over 1 year. The MTHFS enzyme activity was determined for each transformant. The MTHFS activity in the 5YMTHFS cell extracts ranged from 175 to 584 pmol 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu formed/min/mg total protein, whereas the MTHFS activity was undetectable in 5Y cells (<5 pmol 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu/min/mg) (Table I). All of the MTHFS activity was localized to the cytoplasmic fraction, suggesting that the previously reported MTHFS cDNA does not encode a mitochondrial MTHFS enzyme. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that mitochondrial MTHFS has been increased because we were not able to detect any MTHFS activity in isolated mitochondria from either 5Y or 5YMTHFS cells.Table IMTHFS activity of 5Y transformants overexpressing MTHFSCell typeMTHFS activitypmol 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu/min/mg total protein5Y<5.05YMTHFS15845YMTHFS22855YMTHFS35555YMTHFS41755YMTHFS53505YMTHFS6520 Open table in a new tab MTHFS overexpression was verified by Western blot analysis using the 5Y and 5YMTHFS6 cell lines (Fig. 1). While varying molecular masses have been reported for the MTHFS enzyme ranging from 19 to 32 kDa, the human cDNA is expected to express an enzyme with a molecular mass of 23 kDa (11Dayan A. Bertrand R. Beauchemin M. Chahla D. Mamo A. Filion M. Skup D. Massie B. Jolivet J. Gene (Asmt.). 1995; 165: 307-311Google Scholar). Although MTHFS protein was not detected in the 5Y cells consistent with the low levels of enzyme activity found in these cells, 5YMTHFS6 cell extracts contain a strong immunoreactive band present at 26 kDa, consistent with the expression of the MTHFS cDNA (11Dayan A. Bertrand R. Beauchemin M. Chahla D. Mamo A. Filion M. Skup D. Massie B. Jolivet J. Gene (Asmt.). 1995; 165: 307-311Google Scholar). A second uncharacterized 33-kDa immunoreactive band is present at equal intensity in both 5Y and 5YMTHFS cells. Overexpression of the MTHFS cDNA in the cytoplasm would be expected to lower cytoplasmic 5-CHO-H4PteGlu levels and perhaps activate cSHMT activity and influence intracellular serine and glycine metabolism. In order to determine if 5-CHO-H4PteGlu depletion influenced cytoplasmic one-carbon metabolism, intracellular amino acid concentrations were determined for the 5Y and 5YMTHFS6 cells cultured in the presence and the absence of exogenous glycine (Table II). When cultured without glycine, serine and glycine concentrations were elevated approximately 60% in 5YMTHFS6 cells compared with 5Y cells; however, the glycine/serine ratio and intracellular methionine concentrations were unchanged. When cultured with exogenous glycine (2 mM), the intracellular glycine concentrations in 5YMTHFS6 cells were elevated nearly 3-fold compared with 5Y cells, whereas intracellular serine concentrations were elevated greater than 3-fold relative to 5Y cells. Additionally, no methionine was detected in the 5YMTHFS6 cells when cultured with 2 mM exogenous glycine. These results suggest that intracellular 5-CHO-H4PteGlu influences intracellular serine, glycine, and methionine concentrations and that these changes are associated with changes in SHMT activity in the cytoplasm.Table II.Relative intracellular amino acid concentrationsCell lineMedium glycineGlycineaAmino acid concentrations are represented as picomoles recovered relative to valine concentrations.

Open table in a new tab There is accumulating evidence that cells contain a greater number of folic acid-dependent enzymes than folic acid coenzymes and that folic acid metabolism is highly compartmentalized (5Appling D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Google Scholar, 18Schirch V. Strong W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 371-380Google Scholar). Evidence for channeling of the folic acid cofactor has also been suggested in a number of studies. This suggests that the purine, serine, and thymidylate synthesis, as well as homocysteine remethylation pathways are not saturated with folate and that these pathways compete for the limited supply of one-carbon units carried by folic acid cofactors. Initial studies of the 5YMTHFS cells suggested that all transfectants were growth inhibited in the presence of elevated exogenous glycine. In order to determine if overexpression of the MTHFS cDNA in 5Y cells disrupted cytoplasmic one-carbon metabolism, growth studies were performed to determine if the 5YMTHFS cells had additional nutrient requirements. Both 5Y and 5YMTHFS cells require exogenous glycine for maximum cell proliferation rates with growth rates reaching their optimum between 0.2 and 0.5 mM glycine (Fig. 2). When cultured in the presence of 1.0 μM (6R,6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu, 5YMTHFS6 cells did not require exogenous thymidylate, purines, or methionine to maintain optimal growth rates. However, when cultured in the presence of 10 nM (6R,6S)5-CHO-H4PteGlu as described under “Materials and Methods,” the 5YMTHFS6 cells were growth inhibited relative to 5Y cells when exogenous glycine concentrations exceeded 1 mM (Fig. 2). 5YMTHFS6 cells display a 30-40% decrease in cell proliferation rates at glycine concentrations of 2 mM or greater relative to 5Y cell proliferation rates. The growth inhibition was ameliorated in the 5YMTHFS6 cells by the addition of 1.0 μM folinic acid to the culture medium (Fig. 2). In order to determine if the glycine-induced growth inhibition of 5YMTHFS6 cells resulted in the disruption of purine, thymidine, or methionine synthesis, the ability of methionine, hypoxanthine, and thymidylate to ameliorate the glycine induced growth inhibition was examined (Fig. 3). The addition of exogenous hypoxanthine (500 μM) or thymidylate (500 μM) did not ameliorate the glycine-induced (5.0 mM) growth inhibition, whereas the addition of exogenous methionine at 1.0 mM completely ameliorated the glycine-induced growth inhibition in the 5YMTHFS6 cells. These results suggest that the growth inhibition exhibited by 5YMTHFS6 cells in the presence of glycine is due to depletion of intracellular methionine and that 5-CHO-H4PteGlu depletion results in disruptions of homocysteine remethylation. The individual distribution of folic acid one-carbon forms was determined for the 5Y and 5YMTHFS6 cells in the presence and the absence of glycine (Table III). 5Y cells cultured with 0.0 or 0.2 mM exogenous glycine or 0.5 mML-serine contain predominately 10-CHO-H4PteGlu (63-70%) and H4PteGlu (21-28%) with detectable levels of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu (3-7%) and 5-CH3-H4PteGlu (3-4%). However, when cultured in the presence of 5 mM glycine, 10-CHO-H4PteGlu (57%) and H4PteGlu (8.5%) concentrations were decreased, whereas 5-CH3-H4PteGlu levels increased markedly (31%) without affecting 5-CHO-H4PteGlu levels (3%). Cell fractionation studies suggested that all of the accumulated 5-CH3-H4PteGlu was localized to the cytoplasm. The increase in 5-CH3-H4PteGlu and decrease in H4PteGlu levels associated with 5.0 mM exogenous glycine suggests that glycine can serve as a major source of one-carbon units for cytoplasmic folate metabolism via the GCS.Table IIIRelative distribution of intracellular tetrahydrofolate derivatives as a function of variable serine and glycine concentrations in the culture mediumCell lineGlycineSerine10-CHO-H4PteGluH4PteGlu5-CHO-H4PteGlu5-CH3-H4PteGlumMmM5Y0072 ± 321 ± 33 ± 14 ± 15Y0.25065 ± 228 ± 24 ± 13 ± 15Y5.0057 ± 39 ± 33 ± 331 ± 35Y00.563 ± 127 ± 27 ± 24 ± 15YMTHFS60090 ± 38 ± 3<1<15YMTHFS60.25067 ± 432 ± 4<1<15YMTHFS65.0076 ± 323 ± 3<1<15YMTHFS600.570 ± 329 ± 3<1<1 Open table in a new tab When cultured in the absence of glycine, the 5YMTHFS6 cells do not contain any 5-CHO-H4PteGlu, verifying that overexpression of MTHFS in the cytoplasm depletes intracellular 5-CHO-H4PteGlu concentrations. In all culture conditions 10-CHO-H4PteGlu (67-90%) is the predominate folate derivative in these cells, with the remaining folate present as H4PteGlu (8-32%). 5-CH3H4PteGlu was not detected (<1%) in the culture conditions listed in Table III. These results suggest that although exogenous glycine is an effective source of one-carbon units for 5-CH3-H4PteGlu synthesis in 5Y cells, 5YMTHFS6 cells are not able to accumulate 5-CH3-H4PteGlu when cultured with exogenous glycine. In the present study, the effects of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu depletion on folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism were determined by overexpressing the MTHFS cDNA in the cytoplasm of human 5Y neuroblastoma. Previous studies of the 5Y neuroblastoma (13Kohl R.L. Perez-Polo J.R. Quay W.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1980; 5: 271-280Google Scholar) have demonstrated that these cells contain both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic SHMT activities, as well as an active GCS. Analysis of the folic acid one-carbon pools demonstrated that overexpression of MTHFS in the cytoplasm depletes all cellular 5-CHO-H4PteGlu, suggesting that 5-CHO-H4PteGlu accumulates in the cell due to limiting MTHFS activity. However, although overexpression of the MTHFS cDNA resulted in accumulation of MTHFS enzyme in the cytoplasm, we cannot rule out the possibility that mitochondrial MTHFS activity was also increased because we were not able to detect any MTHFS activity in purified mitochondria from either 5Y or 5YMTHFS cells. Analysis of the intracellular free amino acid pools suggests that depletion of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu increased both intracellular serine and glycine concentrations, suggesting that 5-CHO-H4PteGlu polyglutamates do inhibit cSHMT activity in vivo, consistent with previous in vitro studies (10Stover P. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1543-1550Google Scholar). In these studies, we have demonstrated that 5Y cells do not accumulate 5-CH3-H4PteGlu in the cytoplasm in the absence of exogenous glycine, whereas 5-CH3-H4PteGlu accounts for 31% of total folate in 5Y cells cultured with 5 mM exogenous glycine. This suggests that glycine is an effective one-carbon source for the synthesis of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu and subsequent homocysteine remethylation (Scheme 1). 5Y cells overexpressing MTHFS in the cytoplasm do not accumulate either free methionine or 5-CH3-H4PteGlu when cultured with elevated exogenous glycine, suggesting that glycine is no longer an effective source of one-carbon units for homocysteine remethylation. The observation that glycine is no longer an effective one-carbon source for homocysteine remethylation in 5YMTHFS cells suggests that 5-CHO-H4PteGlu plays a critical role in regulating the activity of cSHMT and the relative distribution of the one-carbon forms of folic acid. When cultured with exogenous glycine, 5YMTHFS6 cells appear to accumulate serine, whereas methionine pools are depleted. These results suggest that there are two reactions competing for one-carbon units in the form of 5,10-CH2-H4PteGlu: serine synthesis catalyzed by cSHMT and 5-CH3-H4PteGlu synthesis catalyzed by the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (Scheme 1). The combined activation of cSHMT resulting from 5-CHO-H4PteGlu depletion and the availability of exogenously supplied glycine inhibits the flow of one-carbon units from 10-CHO-H4PteGlu to 5-CH3H4PteGlu due to an increase in serine synthesis by cSHMT. In the absence of exogenous glycine, depletion of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu does not affect cell proliferation rates in 5YMTHFS cells. However, when cultured with 10 nM folinate, exogenous glycine (2 mM) inhibits 5YMTHFS cell proliferation 30-40% relative to 5Y cell proliferation rates. This suggests that both cSHMT activation and a source of exogenous glycine is required to deplete 5-CH3-H4PteGlu and thereby inhibit homocysteine remethylation. We have also attempted to overexpress the human MTHFS cDNA in human MCF-7 cells and CHO cells. 2J. R. Suh and P. Stover, unpublished data. These cell lines do not contain a GCS and require serine as the major source of one-carbon units. We were not able to obtain stable cell lines that overexpressed MTHFS in the CHO cells, suggesting that MTHFS overexpression may be lethal in these cells. We were only able to obtain two stable MCF-7 cell transfectants that overexpressed the MTHFS cDNA. In the MCF-7 transfectants, MTHFS activity was elevated less than 6-fold, suggesting that increases in MTHFS activity in MCF-7 cells may also be lethal.2 The low levels of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu in the cell do play a role in folic acid-dependent one-carbon metabolism. 5-CHO-H4PteGlu is required to keep cytoplasmic folate metabolism in homeostasis by mediating the flow of one-carbon units in the cytoplasm through either the homocysteine remethylation or serine synthesis pathways. The need for folate-dependent serine synthesis in the cytoplasm is not clearly understood because serine synthesis from glycolytic intermediates also occurs in the cytoplasm. However, these studies suggest that the slow tight binding inhibitor 5-CHO-H4PteGlu regulates cSHMT activity and folate-dependent serine synthesis. This may be a mechanism used by cells to prevent accumulation of intracellular folate as 5-CH3-H4PteGlu and thereby regenerate H4PteGlu for purine biosynthesis. This notion is supported by previous in vitro kinetic studies that have demonstrated substrate channeling of THF polyglutamate cofactor from cSHMT to 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase during the cSHMT catalyzed conversion of glycine to serine (19Strong W.B. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9430-9439Google Scholar). Finally, it is also of interest that increased availability of either methionine or folinate can ameliorate the glycine-induced growth inhibition of 5YMTHFS cells. It has been well established that disruptions in folate-dependent homocysteine remethylation can result in incomplete closure of the neural tube during development (9Scott J.M. Weir D.G. Kirke P.N. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Dekker, New York1995: 329-360Google Scholar). The ability of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu to influence 5-CH3-H4PteGlu concentrations and homocysteine remethylation suggests that regulation of the 5-CHO-H4PteGlu futile cycle may be critical to maintain one-carbon homeostasis especially during rapid proliferative stages in development."
https://openalex.org/W2051219431,"In differentiated tissues, such as muscle and brain, increased adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels stimulate glycolytic flux rates. In the breast cancer cell line MCF-7, which characteristically has a constantly high glycolytic flux rate, AMP induces a strong inhibition of glycolysis. The human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-453, on the other hand, is characterized by a more differentiated metabolic phenotype. MDA-MB-453 cells have a lower glycolytic flux rate and higher pyruvate consumption than MCF-7 cells. In addition, they have an active glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle. AMP inhibits cell proliferation as well as NAD and NADH synthesis in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 cells. However, in MDA-MB-453 cells glycolysis is slightly activated by AMP. This disparate response of glycolytic flux rate to AMP treatment is presumably caused by the fact that the reduced NAD and NADH levels in AMP-treated MDA-MB-453 cells reduce lactate dehydrogenase but not cytosolic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction. Due to the different enzymatic complement in MCF-7 cells, proliferation is inhibited under glucose starvation, whereas MDA-MB-453 cells grow under these conditions. The inhibition of cell proliferation correlates with a reduction in glycolytic carbon flow to synthetic processes and a decrease in phosphotyrosine content of several proteins in both cell lines.

The inhibition of cell proliferation correlates with a reduction in glycolytic carbon flow to synthetic processes and a decrease in phosphotyrosine content of several proteins in both cell lines. Both proliferating cells and tumor cells maintain a high glycolytic rate even under aerobic conditions, a process referred to as aerobic glycolysis. Observations on aerobic glycolysis in tumor cells prompted Warburg (1Warburg O. Science. 1956; 124: 269-270Crossref Google Scholar) to postulate an altered respiratory function leading to an increased glycolytic capacity and a high rate of lactate formation from glucose in the presence of oxygen. Data from former reports suggest that there are many factors contributing to the origin of aerobic glycolysis (2Eigenbrodt E. Gerbracht U. Mazurek S. Presek P. Friis R. Biochemical and Molecular Aspects of Selected Cancers. 2. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1994: 311-385Google Scholar). The altered control of glycolysis by expression of certain isoenzymes is one important factor (2Eigenbrodt E. Gerbracht U. Mazurek S. Presek P. Friis R.

Furthermore, the glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle and the malate-aspartate shuttle are altered in such a way that transport of cytosolic hydrogen into the mitochondria is reduced, requiring tumor cells to reoxidize NADH cytosolically by lactate dehydrogenase (13Sanchez-Jimenez F. Martinez P. Nunez de Castro I. Olavarria J.S. Biochimie (Paris). 1985; 67: 259-264Google Scholar, 14Lopez-Alarcon L. Eboli M.-L. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 5589-5591Google Scholar, 15Lopez-Alarcon L.

Additionally, oxidation of pyruvate is reduced in favor of glutamine oxidation (16Singer S. Souza K. Thilly W.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5140-5145Google Scholar, 17Marchok A.C. Huang S.F. Martin D.H.

Due to the expression of the mitochondrial, NAD-dependent malate decarboxylase, malate is converted to pyruvate and lactate (22Sauer L.A. Dauchy R.T. Nagel W.O. Morris H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3844-3848Google Scholar–24Moreadith R.W. Lehninger A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6222-6227Google Scholar). The conversion of glutamine to lactate is called, in analogy to glycolysis, glutaminolysis (25McKeehan W.L. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1982; 6: 635-650Google Scholar). In tumor cells the glycolytic capacity can be so great that all of the cell's energy requirements are derived from glycolysis (2Eigenbrodt E. Gerbracht U. Mazurek S. Presek P. Friis R. Biochemical and Molecular Aspects of Selected Cancers. 2. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1994: 311-385Google Scholar, 26Weber G. Stubbs M. Morris H.P. Cancer Res. 1971; 31: 2177-2183Google Scholar). Therefore, high glycolytic activity ensures the survival and the migration of tumor cells in hypoxic areas (2Eigenbrodt E. Gerbracht U. Mazurek S. Presek P. Friis R. Biochemical and Molecular Aspects of Selected Cancers. 2. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1994: 311-385Google Scholar, 26Weber G. Stubbs M. Morris H.P.

The main role of the glutaminolytic pathway is the generation of energy (2Eigenbrodt E. Gerbracht U. Mazurek S. Presek P. Friis R. Biochemical and Molecular Aspects of Selected Cancers. 2. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1994: 311-385Google Scholar, 25McKeehan W.L. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1982; 6: 635-650Google Scholar). However, a high glycolytic rate is not always linked to cell proliferation or tumor formation. There are several cell lines that are able to grow in a medium with 5 mM galactose or with low glucose supply (0.5 mM) without producing lactate via glycolysis (19Reitzer L.J. Wice B.M. Kennell D. J.

Investigations with labeled glucose and galactose have shown that the carbons of the two carbohydrates can either be used to synthesize nucleotides, phospholipids, and complex carbohydrates or can flow through pyruvate kinase to pyruvate and lactate for energy production (2Eigenbrodt E.

When those cells are replaced in a medium with a high glucose concentration (5 mM), all phosphometabolites above pyruvate kinase accumulate until the level of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is high enough to activate pyruvate kinase (34Glaser G. Giloh H. Kasir J. Gross M. Mager J. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 793-800Google Scholar, 35Ashizawa K. Willingham M.C. Liang C.-M. Cheng S. J. Biol.

The mass of lactate is then derived from glucose. As a consequence, all intermediates of glycolysis between hexokinase and pyruvate kinase increase. By this mechanism the supply of phosphometabolites for synthetic processes is ensured, although pyruvate kinase is activated (2Eigenbrodt E. Gerbracht U. Mazurek S. Presek P. Friis R. Biochemical and Molecular Aspects of Selected Cancers. 2. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1994: 311-385Google Scholar, 36Eigenbrodt E. Reinacher M. Scheefers-Borchel U. Scheefers H. Friis R. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1992; 3: 91-113Google Scholar). From these observations and the fact that growth factors and oncogene-dependent phosphorylation regulate glycolysis and phosphometabolite pools, one can assume that some phosphometabolites or synthetic products derived from the phosphometabolites, e.g. sugar phosphates, AMP, NAD, NADH and serine for sphinganine synthesis, regulate cell proliferation (2Eigenbrodt E.

Extracellular AMP is split to adenosine by the ecto-5′-nucleotidase. Adenosine is transported into the cells via an adenosine translocator and rephosphorylated by the cytosolic adenosine kinase to AMP (49Hugo F. Mazurek S. Zander U. Eigenbrodt E. J. Cell.

U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8242-8246Google Scholar). NADH levels drop so low that lactate dehydrogenase is no longer able to transfer the hydrogen from NADH to pyruvate. As a consequence, glycolysis is inhibited at the level of the NADH producing glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction (49Hugo F. Mazurek S. Zander U. Eigenbrodt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 539-549Google Scholar). The metabolic behavior of MCF-7 cells is in complete contrast to differentiated tissues and cells where the increase of AMP under hypoxic conditions drastically activates 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase and the glycolytic flux rate (55Schultz V. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1938-1943Google Scholar, 56Zeleznikar R.J. Dzeja P.P. Goldberg N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7311-7319Google Scholar, 57Ohno K. Maier P. J. Cell.

In order to investigate the mechanisms by which AMP stimulates glycolysis in differentiated cells and inhibits glycolysis in tumor cells, we decided to study another human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-453, which has a more differentiated metabolic phenotype (e.g. low aerobic glycolytic flux rate, high pyruvate consumption). In addition, we found that MDA-MB-453 cells grow well in a medium with a low glucose concentration and with galactose, whereas MCF-7 cells are unable to grow under these nutrient conditions. MCF-7 cells were obtained from Prof. Dr. K. Goerttler, Institute for Experimental Pathology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany. MDA-MB-453 cells were from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures in Braunschweig, Germany. For cell culture, the basic medium used was glucose-free Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, supplemented with 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, 2 mM glutamine, and 4 mM pyruvate (all from Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). For MCF-7 cells 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) 1The abbreviations used are: FCSfetal calf serumDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. from Biochrom, Berlin, Germany, were added to the basic medium. For MDA-MB-453 cells the basic medium was supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.0. Glucose and galactose from Sigma were added to the media of both cell lines as described under “Results.” MCF-7 cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2 environment. MDA-MB-453 cells were cultured in a CO2-free atmosphere. For the proliferation and flux experiments 4-cm diameter dishes (MCF-7 cells) and 25-cm2 flasks (MDA-MB-453 cells) were used (both from Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). For the intracellular measurements MCF-7 cells were cultured on 14-cm diameter dishes, and experiments were started with 1 million cells/dish. MDA-MB-453 cells were cultured in 83-cm2 flasks, and experiments were started with 2 million cells/flask. MCF-7 cells were passaged every 4 days and MDA-MB-453 cells every 5-6 days. AMP was derived from Boehringer Mannheim, Germany, and was added to the media at a final concentration of 3 mM. fetal calf serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. For the proliferation rate and glycolytic and glutaminolytic flux measurements, AMP was added to the medium at the beginning of each passage. For the intracellular measurements AMP was added to the media on the 2nd day of the culture period. After 2 (MCF-7 cells) or 3 days (MDA-MB-453 cells), the AMP-treated cells arrested at a cell density of 5 million cells/dish, whereas control cells without AMP treatment continued to proliferate, reaching a density of 10-15 million cells/dish (MCF-7 cells) or 15-20 million cells/flask (MDA-MB-453 cells). Every 24 h cell culture supernatants were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cells were removed from the plates with trypsin/EDTA from Biochrom, Berlin, Germany, and counted in a hemocytometer. The frozen supernatants were heated for 15 min at 80°C and were subsequently centrifuged at 8000 × g for 10 min (49Hugo F. Mazurek S. Zander U. Eigenbrodt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 539-549Google Scholar). Glucose, lactate, pyruvate, glutamine, and glutamate concentrations were determined according to Bergmeyer (60Bergmeyer H.U. Verlag Chemie.Band I and II. Weinheim/ Bergstraße 3, 1974Google Scholar). For galactose measurements a commercially available test kit from Boehringer Mannheim, Germany, was employed. For the extraction of intracellular lactate, pyruvate, and NAD, cells were treated at 80°C in aqua bidest for 15 min as described previously (49Hugo F. Mazurek S. Zander U. Eigenbrodt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 539-549Google Scholar). The concentrations of lactate, pyruvate, and NAD were measured enzymatically (60Bergmeyer H.U. Verlag Chemie.Band I and II. Weinheim/ Bergstraße 3, 1974Google Scholar). The NADH concentration was calculated via the equation [NADH] = 1.11·;10−4·;[NAD]·;[lactate]:[pyruvate] (47Schwartz J.P. Passonneau J.V. Johnson G.S. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4138-4143Google Scholar). The protein content in the pellet was determined using the commercially available Bio-Rad test-kit (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany). For the extraction of the intracellular enzymes, a homogenization buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4, 1 mM mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA/Na2, 2 mMϵ-amino-n-caproic acid, and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was used. For the measurements of malate dehydrogenase a homogenization buffer containing 10 mM Tris, 1 mM NaF, and 1 mM mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4, was used. The extractions and the measurements of enzyme activities were carried out as described in Ref. 49Hugo F. Mazurek S. Zander U. Eigenbrodt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 539-549Google Scholar. Protein concentrations were measured by the Biuret method using a commercially available test kit from Boehringer Mannheim, Germany. The pyruvate kinase subunits (dimer and tetramer) were separated by gel filtration as described in Ref. 36Eigenbrodt E. Reinacher M. Scheefers-Borchel U. Scheefers H. Friis R. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1992; 3: 91-113Google Scholar. Cells were extracted with a homogenization buffer containing 10 mM Tris, 1 mM NaF, and 1 mM mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4. Isoelectric focusing was carried out with a linear gradient of glycerine (50% to 0% (v/v)) and ampholines (pI 3.5-10.5) as described previously (61Mazurek S. Hugo F. Failing K. Eigenbrodt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 238-250Google Scholar). After separation on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. For the detection of phosphotyrosine a peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA) was used. Immunostaining without anti-phosphotyrosine antibody resulted in no detectable reaction (61Mazurek S. Hugo F. Failing K. Eigenbrodt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 238-250Google Scholar). For the glycolytic and glutaminolytic flux measurements as well as for the specific enzyme activities, statistical analysis was performed by a one- or two-factor (co)variance analysis with the “statistical program package BMDP,” whereby metabolite conversions or enzyme activities were plotted versus cell densities (62Dixon, W. J., (ed)(1993) University of California Press, Berkeley, Los Angeles.Google Scholar). Possible effects of cell density were taken into consideration. In all other analyses Student's t test was employed. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 cells were cultured in media with different glucose and galactose concentrations. The basic medium was glucose-free Dulbecco's minimal essential medium. After addition of fetal calf serum a final glucose concentration of 0.5 mM was obtained. Galactose was not detectable. In order to achieve other glucose and galactose concentrations, corresponding carbohydrates were added to the medium. To obtain a glucose-free medium fetal calf serum was dialyzed in a dialysis bag three times (for 8 h each) against 40 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline. To ensure that no vital necessary factors were lost during dialysis, the glucose-free medium was supplemented with 0.5 mM glucose, and cell proliferation was checked. There was no difference between the proliferation rate of MDA-MB-453 cells cultured in the glucose-supplemented medium (0.5 mM glucose) and that of the cells held in medium with 0.5 mM glucose from undialyzed fetal calf serum (data not shown). For cell stock breeding MCF-7 cells were cultured in the basic DMEM supplemented with 5 mM glucose. MDA-MB-453 cells were cultured in the basic DMEM supplemented with 5 mM galactose and 0.5 mM glucose from FCS (compare “Experimental Procedures”). Henceforth, these cells will be referred to as “proliferating” MCF-7 or MDA-MB-453 cells. For the described experiments with other glucose and galactose concentrations, cells were cultured for one passage in the new medium, and the cells of the second passage were used for the measurements. The effect of AMP on metabolites and enzymes was always determined in the culture medium in which the cells grew best. For MCF-7 cells this was basic DMEM supplemented with 5 mM glucose and for MDA-MB-453 the basic DMEM supplemented with 5 mM galactose and 0.5 mM glucose (from FCS). The concentration of AMP depends on the content of adenosine deaminase in the FCS charge (49Hugo F. Mazurek S. Zander U. Eigenbrodt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 539-549Google Scholar). Adenosine deaminase degrades AMP to inosine monophosphate, which has no inhibitory effect on the proliferation rate of the two cell lines (49Hugo F. Mazurek S. Zander U. Eigenbrodt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 539-549Google Scholar). For the experiments described in this paper an AMP concentration of 3 mM was chosen. Fig. 1, A and B, shows the effect of AMP and different glucose and galactose concentrations on the cell proliferation rate of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 cells. In MCF-7 cells the highest proliferation rate was reached at a glucose concentration of 5 mM in the medium (Fig. 1A). Reduction of the glucose concentration to 0.5 mM led to an inhibition of cell proliferation to less than half the maximal rate. In glucose-free DMEM supplemented with 5 mM galactose, the cells became adherent but ceased to proliferate. The addition of AMP to the culture medium (DMEM with 5 mM glucose) totally inhibited cell proliferation. This inhibition was reversible. After degradation of AMP in the medium or after reculture in AMP-free medium, cell proliferation began again and reached normal values (49Hugo F. Mazurek S. Zander U. Eigenbrodt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 539-549Google Scholar). MDA-MB-453 cells demonstrated a totally different association between proliferation rate and availability of glucose and galactose in the medium. MDA-MB-453 cells grew best in a medium containing 5 mM galactose (Fig. 1B). In the absence of galactose, cell proliferation was inhibited in MDA-MB-453 cells. If glucose was also removed cell proliferation was totally arrested. The cells did not become confluent. In the presence of glucose in the medium, the cell proliferation rate was only about half the rate in galactose containing medium. An increase of the glucose concentration from 0.5 to 5 mM had no effect on the proliferation rate. As in MCF-7 cells, incubation of MDA-MB-453 cells with AMP led to a total inhibition of cell proliferation. After reculture of the AMP-treated MDA-MB-453 cells in AMP-free medium, cell proliferation once again reached normal rates (data not shown). For flux measurements, two different forms of calculations were chosen. The first calculation is in nmol/(h·;dish) and describes the direct correlation between the consumption of a specific carbon source (glucose, galactose, glutamine, or pyruvate) and lactate or glutamate production. The second form of calculation in nmol/(h·;105 cells) describes the consumption or production of a certain metabolite by each cell. In MCF-7 cells the measurements of the glycolytic flux in nmol/(h·;dish) showed a close linkage between glucose consumption and lactate production, independent of the glucose concentration in the medium (0.5 mM or 5 mM) (Fig. 2A and Table I). The slope of the regression line with 5 mM glucose was 1.7, with a correlation coefficient of 0.932. This value approaches the ideal maximal value of 2 for the ratio of lactate production:glucose consumption. In glycolysis 1 mol of glucose is converted into 2 mol of lactate; therefore, a ratio between lactate production and glucose consumption of nearly 2 indicates that all lactate produced must be derived from glucose. A slope of 1.7 means that 85% of the glucose consumed was converted to lactate. Therefore, in MCF-7 cells 37 nmol of glucose consumed were converted to lactate, and 7 nmol were used for synthetic processes (calculated with data from Table III). The intercept of the regression line reflects the lactate production without glucose consumption (Fig. 2 and Table I, Table II). This lactate can derive from glutamine and/or pyruvate consumption (Table I, Table II). In MCF-7 cells with 5 mM glucose 91 nmol of lactate/(h·;dish) were derived from sources other than glucose (Table I). If cultured in a medium with 5 mM glucose, there was a significant correlation between glutamine consumption and lactate production (Table I) but not between pyruvate consumption and lactate production (data not shown). Therefore, when no glucose was consumed by MCF-7 cells, the mass of lactate derived from glutamine. Furthermore, glutamine consumption increased with glucose consumption when the cells were cultured in 5 mM glucose (slope = 0.08; intercept = 6.2 nmol/(h·;dish); r = 0.777; n = 33). A reduction of the glucose concentration to 0.5 mM led to an inhibition of cell proliferation (Fig. 1A) and to a reduction of the total glucose conversion (Table III), but the strong linkage between glucose consumption and lactate production was not influenced at low glucose concentrations (Fig. 2A and Table I). The slope of the regression line was 1.6 with a regression coefficient of 0.642. The intercept of the regression line dropped from 91 nmol/(h·;dish) in medium with 5 mM glucose to 25 nmol/(h·;dish) in medi"

https://openalex.org/W2087713324,"Insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) gene expression is regulated by various stimuli, including hormones, growth factors, and nutritional status. We have investigated the molecular mechanism by which two growth factors, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) regulate IGF-IR gene expression. bFGF increases the endogenous IGF-IR mRNA levels and IGF-IR promoter activity. This effect is mediated by a region of the IGF-IR promoter located between nucleotides −476 and −188 in the 5′-flanking region. In contrast, IGF-I decreases the IGF-IR mRNA levels. IGF-I down-regulates IGF-IR transcriptional activity as deduced from experiments in which the levels of pre-mRNA and mRNA were measured. IGF-I reduced pre-mRNA and mRNA levels in parallel, while the mRNA stability was found to be unchanged by IGF-I treatment. While these results strongly suggest an effect of IGF-I on IGF-IR transcriptional activity, no specific IGF-I response element was demonstrated in the 5′-untranslated region or 5′-flanking region studied.

INTRODUCTIONThe insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) 1The abbreviations used are: IGFinsulin-like growth factorIGF-IRinsulin-like growth factor-I receptorbFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorDRB5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole ribosideIRS-1insulin receptor substrate-1IGFBPIGF binding proteinsUTRuntranslated regionbpbase pair(s). and the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) are important modulators of cell growth and differentiation in many tissues (1Daughaday W.H. Rotwein P. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 68-91Google Scholar). IGF-IR gene expression is highly regulated under many physiological and pathological conditions (for review, see Ref. 2LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Google Scholar). For instance, IGF-IR mRNA levels and IGF-I binding are tightly regulated by the nutritional status of the animal. In vivo, fasting was shown to increase IGF-I-specific binding in several tissues, and these changes in IGF-I binding were accompanied by a ∼2-fold increase in IGF-IR mRNA abundance (3Lowe Jr., W.L. Adamo M. Werner H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 619-626Google Scholar). Since, in some of the tissues, the local levels of IGF-I are decreased after a reduction in caloric intake, it is possible that the increases in IGF-IR expression are secondary to the decrease in local tissue IGF-I concentrations (4Thissen J.P. Ketelslegers J.-M. Underwood L.E. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 80-163Google Scholar). In contrast, some growth disorders such as Laron-type dwarfism are associated with long term reductions of circulating levels of IGF-I. In these disorders the expression of the IGF-IR gene in mononuclear cells is enhanced severalfold, suggesting an effect of circulating IGF-I (5Eshet R. Werner H. Klinger B. Laron Z. LeRoith D. Roberts Jr., C.T. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 10: 115-120Google Scholar). Drug-induced diabetes in rats is an additional animal model in which the regulation of the IGF-IR gene has been studied. Streptozotocin-treated rats show a reduction in circulating IGF-I levels and increased expression of the IGF-IR in the kidney. Both circulating IGF-I levels and IGF-IR expression returned to control values following insulin treatment (6Werner H. Shen-Orr Z. Stannard B. Burguera B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 1490-1497Google Scholar). Similarly, the levels of IGF-IR in cultured cells are affected by the concentration of IGF-I in the medium. For instance, in cultured IM-9 lymphoid, FRTL-5 thyroid, and endothelial cells, IGF-IR expression is regulated by the concentration of IGF-I in the culture medium (7Rosenfeld R.G. Hintz R.L. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 1841-1848Google Scholar, 8Rosenfeld R.G. Dollar L.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1982; 55: 434-440Google Scholar), with increased IGF-I levels causing a decrease in receptor number. Under certain circumstances this down-regulation involves a translocation of cell-surface receptors to an intracellular pool (9Yamamoto H. Prager D. Yamasaki H. Melmed S. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1420-1425Google Scholar), whereas in other cell types the effect is due to decreased IGF-IR gene expression (10Rosenthal S.M. Brown E.J. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 141: 69-74Google Scholar).A possible mechanism by which competence factors like bFGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulate entry of cells into the G1 phase of the cell cycle (11Pledger W.J. Stiles C.D. Antoniades H.N. Scher C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4481-4485Google Scholar, 12Stiles C.D. Capone G.T. Scher C.D. Antoniades H.N. Van Wyk J.J. Pledger W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1279-1283Google Scholar) is their ability to increase the expression of the IGF-IR, thus enhancing the progression factor activity of the IGF-I ligand. For instance, bFGF increases IGF-I binding and IGF-IR mRNA levels in the BC3H-1 muscle cell line (13Rosenthal S.M. Brown E.J. Brunetti A. Goldfine I.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 678-684Google Scholar), and this change is associated with a decrease in IGF-II expression in these cells. Similarly, PDGF increases IGF-IR gene expression and ligand binding in cells in culture (14Clemmons D.R. Shaw D.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 115: 137-142Google Scholar), and this effect is due, at least in part, to PDGF stimulation of IGF-IR gene transcriptional activity. This transcriptional effect is mediated by a ∼100-base pair (bp) region located immediately upstream of the transcription start site (15Rubini M. Werner H. Gandini E. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Basevga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 374-379Google Scholar).In the present report, we studied the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of IGF-IR gene expression by bFGF and IGF-I. We found that bFGF and IGF-I regulate transcriptional activity of the IGF-IR gene positively and negatively, respectively. The region responsible for the response to bFGF is located in the proximal 476 bp of the 5′-flanking region, whereas the region responsible for the response to IGF-I is apparently located outside of the −2350-bp to +640-bp region of the IGF-IR gene promoter.DISCUSSIONThe biological actions of the IGFs are mediated through interaction with their specific cell-surface receptor. The IGF-IR is expressed in most body tissues and the levels of IGF-IR mRNA are modulated in a number of physiological and pathological states, including changes in the levels of various circulating and locally acting growth factors. In this study we characterized the molecular mechanisms by which bFGF and IGF-I regulate IGF-IR mRNA levels. While bFGF increases IGF-IR gene promoter activity by 2-fold, IGF-I decreases transcriptional activity by ∼50%.The stimulation of IGF-IR gene promoter activity by bFGF in transfection experiments correlates with its effect on the expression of the endogenous IGF-IR gene, as measured by mRNA and protein levels; i.e. all three parameters increased approximately 2-fold. By deletional analysis of the IGF-IR promoter region, we determined that the bFGF-responsive region is localized in the proximal promoter, between nucleotides −476 and −188 upstream of the transcription start site. Although within the skeletal α-actin gene promoter there is a unique serum response element (SRE1) necessary for induction of promoter activity by bFGF (21Parker T.G. Chow K.-L. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3343-3350Google Scholar), no such consensus sequence was found in the IGF-IR gene proximal promoter. bFGF has also been shown to stimulate proenkephalin gene expression by synergizing with cAMP through a cAMP response element (22Tan Y. Low K.G. Boccia C. Grossman J. Comb M.J Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7546-7556Google Scholar). We did not find any cAMP response element in the IGF-IR proximal promoter region; however, there are a number of AP2 sites, which in the absence of a cAMP response element may mediate the stimulatory effect of cAMP (23Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9063-9066Google Scholar). Further experiments will be required to address whether these AP2 sites are relevant to the stimulatory effect of bFGF on IGF-IR promoter. In addition, there are a number of SP1 sites. However, the significance of these sites to bFGF action has not been previously described.bFGF and PDGF are competence factors that stimulate entry of cells into the cell cycle (11Pledger W.J. Stiles C.D. Antoniades H.N. Scher C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4481-4485Google Scholar, 12Stiles C.D. Capone G.T. Scher C.D. Antoniades H.N. Van Wyk J.J. Pledger W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1279-1283Google Scholar). Both growth factors increase IGF-IR gene expression. It has been shown that PDGF stimulates IGF-IR promoter transcriptional activity (15Rubini M. Werner H. Gandini E. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Basevga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 374-379Google Scholar). Likewise, we show in the present study that bFGF stimulates IGF-IR gene expression by activating promoter activity. This stimulatory effect on IGF-IR promoter activity correlates with the IGF-IR transcriptional activation by bFGF recently shown in aortic smooth muscle cells (24Du J. Meng X.P. Delafontaine P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1378-1384Google Scholar).Both bFGF and PDGF synergize with IGF-I in their biological actions (25Pfeifle B. Boeder H. Ditschuneit H. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 2251-2258Google Scholar, 26Frödin M. Gammeltoft S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1771-1775Google Scholar). The results of the present study suggest that one mechanism may be the increased expression of the IGF-I receptor by these growth factors. Other investigators have demonstrated that increased expression of the IGF-I receptor enhances cellular responses (27Quinn L.S. Haugk K.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 34-41Google Scholar), whereas decreased levels by as little as 50% using antisense technologies decreases responsiveness to IGF-I (28Neuenschwander S. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4298-4303Google Scholar).bFGF also regulates the expression and secretion of various IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs). For instance, in the newborn rat olfactory bulb, bFGF enhanced IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 mRNA levels, whereas IGFBP-5 mRNA was not affected (29Russo V.C. Edmondson S.R. Mercuri F.A. Buchanan C.R. Werther G.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1437-1446Google Scholar). In addition, IGFBP secretion by rat neuronal and glial cells in culture was differentially affected by the presence of bFGF in the culture medium (30Pons S. Torres-Aleman I. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2271-2278Google Scholar). Since IGFBPs modulate both positively and negatively the actions of IGF-I (31Clemmons D.R. Growth Regul. 1992; 2: 80-87Google Scholar–33Rechler M.M. Vitam. Horm. 1993; 47: 1-67Google Scholar), the effect of bFGF on the expression of the IGFBPs represent another level of regulation of IGF-I action.IGF-I is a progression factor that is required by cells to progress through the cell cycle. In this study we have shown that IGF-I down-regulates endogenous IGF-IR mRNA levels in a neuroblastoma cell line and a muscle cell line. Similar results were described previously in a separate muscle cell line (10Rosenthal S.M. Brown E.J. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 141: 69-74Google Scholar). The direct demonstration that IGF-I down-regulates IGF-IR gene expression supports the hypothesis that both circulating and locally produced IGF-I are responsible for the regulation of IGF-IR mRNA levels under several physiological and pathological situations in animal models as well as in humans. Futher support of the hypothesis that IGF-I represses expression of the IGF-IR gene “in vivo,” comes from developmental studies in which we showed that increasing postnatal levels of IGF-I are correlated with decreased levels of IGF-IR mRNA in developing rats (20Werner H. Woloschak M. Adamo M. Shen-Orr Z. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7451-7455Google Scholar).Results of experiments in which we measured IGF-IR pre-mRNA levels and mRNA stability suggest that down-regulation of IGF-IR mRNA levels by IGF-I is due to a decrease in transcription activity rate with no change in mRNA stability. Thus, IGF-I decreases pre-mRNA and mature mRNA levels to a similar extent as measured with two different exon:intron boundary probes, whereas, on the other hand IGF-I does not affect the IGF-IR mRNA turnover.We were unable to demonstrate regulation of the IGF-IR promoter by IGF-I using fragments of the promoter extending from nucleotide −2350 in the 5′-flanking region to nucleotide +640 in the 5′-UTR. The promoter activity of this region has been previously characterized and several cis-acting regulatory elements have been described, including EGR/WT1 binding sites (34Werner H. Rauscher III, F.J. Sukhatme V.P. Drummond I.A. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12577-12582Google Scholar), Sp1 binding sites (35Beitner-Johnson D. Werner H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1147-1156Google Scholar), a PDGF response region (15Rubini M. Werner H. Gandini E. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Basevga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 374-379Google Scholar) and a potential FGF response region (this study). In addition, the IGF-IR promoter contains a sequence between nucleotides −583 and −555, which is similar to a putative IGF-I response element described in the elastin gene that mediates activation of the elastin promoter by IGF-I (36Wolfe B.L. Rich C.B. Goud H.D. Terpstra A.J. Bashir M. Rosenbloom J. Sonenshein G.E. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12418-12426Google Scholar). However, our present data would suggest that the putative IGF-I response element probably lies entirely outside this region (−2350/+640) or, alternatively, that it is within this region but requires other cis- or trans-activating elements for this effect. A similar discrepancy between transcriptional and promoter activity regulation has been seen in the transcriptional activation of the IκBα gene by glucocorticoids (37Schinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofsquist A.K. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Google Scholar, 38Auphan A. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Google Scholar). Thus, while increasing transcription from the IκBα gene as measured by run-on transcription assay, dexamethasone had no effect on IκBα gene promoter activity. Based on our results we cannot totally exclude the possibility that the luciferase reporter vector used in this study was the inappropriate vector, albeit similar results were obtained with two different luciferase reporter vectors (pOLUC and pGL2) (data not shown).In summary we have characterized the regulation of IGF-IR gene expression by two growth factors that exhibit opposite effects on the transcriptional activity of the IGF-IR gene. bFGF increases IGF-IR promoter activity by acting in the proximal promoter region whereas IGF-I down-regulates transcriptional activity through a different mechanism that may involve other as yet uncharacterized, regions of the IGF-IR gene. INTRODUCTIONThe insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) 1The abbreviations used are: IGFinsulin-like growth factorIGF-IRinsulin-like growth factor-I receptorbFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorDRB5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole ribosideIRS-1insulin receptor substrate-1IGFBPIGF binding proteinsUTRuntranslated regionbpbase pair(s). and the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) are important modulators of cell growth and differentiation in many tissues (1Daughaday W.H. Rotwein P. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 68-91Google Scholar). IGF-IR gene expression is highly regulated under many physiological and pathological conditions (for review, see Ref. 2LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Google Scholar). For instance, IGF-IR mRNA levels and IGF-I binding are tightly regulated by the nutritional status of the animal. In vivo, fasting was shown to increase IGF-I-specific binding in several tissues, and these changes in IGF-I binding were accompanied by a ∼2-fold increase in IGF-IR mRNA abundance (3Lowe Jr., W.L. Adamo M. Werner H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 619-626Google Scholar). Since, in some of the tissues, the local levels of IGF-I are decreased after a reduction in caloric intake, it is possible that the increases in IGF-IR expression are secondary to the decrease in local tissue IGF-I concentrations (4Thissen J.P. Ketelslegers J.-M. Underwood L.E. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 80-163Google Scholar). In contrast, some growth disorders such as Laron-type dwarfism are associated with long term reductions of circulating levels of IGF-I. In these disorders the expression of the IGF-IR gene in mononuclear cells is enhanced severalfold, suggesting an effect of circulating IGF-I (5Eshet R. Werner H. Klinger B. Laron Z. LeRoith D. Roberts Jr., C.T. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 10: 115-120Google Scholar). Drug-induced diabetes in rats is an additional animal model in which the regulation of the IGF-IR gene has been studied. Streptozotocin-treated rats show a reduction in circulating IGF-I levels and increased expression of the IGF-IR in the kidney. Both circulating IGF-I levels and IGF-IR expression returned to control values following insulin treatment (6Werner H. Shen-Orr Z. Stannard B. Burguera B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 1490-1497Google Scholar). Similarly, the levels of IGF-IR in cultured cells are affected by the concentration of IGF-I in the medium. For instance, in cultured IM-9 lymphoid, FRTL-5 thyroid, and endothelial cells, IGF-IR expression is regulated by the concentration of IGF-I in the culture medium (7Rosenfeld R.G. Hintz R.L. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 1841-1848Google Scholar, 8Rosenfeld R.G. Dollar L.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1982; 55: 434-440Google Scholar), with increased IGF-I levels causing a decrease in receptor number. Under certain circumstances this down-regulation involves a translocation of cell-surface receptors to an intracellular pool (9Yamamoto H. Prager D. Yamasaki H. Melmed S. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1420-1425Google Scholar), whereas in other cell types the effect is due to decreased IGF-IR gene expression (10Rosenthal S.M. Brown E.J. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 141: 69-74Google Scholar).A possible mechanism by which competence factors like bFGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulate entry of cells into the G1 phase of the cell cycle (11Pledger W.J. Stiles C.D. Antoniades H.N. Scher C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4481-4485Google Scholar, 12Stiles C.D. Capone G.T. Scher C.D. Antoniades H.N. Van Wyk J.J. Pledger W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1279-1283Google Scholar) is their ability to increase the expression of the IGF-IR, thus enhancing the progression factor activity of the IGF-I ligand. For instance, bFGF increases IGF-I binding and IGF-IR mRNA levels in the BC3H-1 muscle cell line (13Rosenthal S.M. Brown E.J. Brunetti A. Goldfine I.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 678-684Google Scholar), and this change is associated with a decrease in IGF-II expression in these cells. Similarly, PDGF increases IGF-IR gene expression and ligand binding in cells in culture (14Clemmons D.R. Shaw D.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 115: 137-142Google Scholar), and this effect is due, at least in part, to PDGF stimulation of IGF-IR gene transcriptional activity. This transcriptional effect is mediated by a ∼100-base pair (bp) region located immediately upstream of the transcription start site (15Rubini M. Werner H. Gandini E. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Basevga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 374-379Google Scholar).In the present report, we studied the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of IGF-IR gene expression by bFGF and IGF-I. We found that bFGF and IGF-I regulate transcriptional activity of the IGF-IR gene positively and negatively, respectively. The region responsible for the response to bFGF is located in the proximal 476 bp of the 5′-flanking region, whereas the region responsible for the response to IGF-I is apparently located outside of the −2350-bp to +640-bp region of the IGF-IR gene promoter."

The high resolution structures account for catalysis by transition state stabilization, and in all three antibodies a tyrosine residue participates in the oxyanion hole. Despite significant conformational differences in their combining sites, the three antibodies, which are the most efficient among those elicited, achieve catalysis in essentially the same mode, suggesting that evolution for binding to a single TSA followed by screening for catalysis lead to antibodies with structural convergence."
https://openalex.org/W1978073468,"In this paper we demonstrate for the first time a mitogen-induced activation of a nuclear acting phosphatidylcholine-phospholipase D (PLD) which is mediated, at least in part, by the translocation of RhoA to the nucleus. Addition of α-thrombin to quiescent IIC9 cells results in an increase in PLD activity in IIC9 nuclei. This is indicated by an increase in the α-thrombin-induced production of nuclear phosphatidylethanol in quiescent cells incubated in the presence of ethanol as well as an increase in PLD activity in isolated nuclei. Consistent with our previous report (Wright, T. M., Willenberger, S., and Raben, D. M. (1992) Biochem. J. 285, 395-400), the presence of ethanol decreases the α-thrombin-induced production of phosphatidic acid without affecting the induced increase in nuclear diglyceride, indicating that the increase in nuclear PLD activity is responsible for the effect on phosphatidic acid, but not that on diglyceride. Our data further demonstrate that RhoA mediates the activation of nuclear PLD. RhoA translocates to the nucleus in response to α-thrombin. Additionally, PLD activity in nuclei isolated from α-thrombin-treated cells is reduced in a concentration-dependent fashion by incubation with RhoGDI and restored by the addition of prenylated RhoA in the presence of guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. Western blot analysis indicates that this RhoGDI treatment results in the extraction of RhoA from the nuclear envelope. These data support a role for a RhoA-mediated activation of PLD in our recently described hypothesis, which proposes that a signal transduction cascade exists in the nuclear envelope and represents a novel signal transduction cascade that we have termed NEST ( n envelopesignal transduction).

We recently advanced the hypothesis that a novel nuclear lipid metabolism is a component of unique nuclear signaling cascades that we defined as nuclear envelope signal transduction (NEST) (15Jarpe M.B. Leach K.L. Raben D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 526-534Google Scholar, 16Raben D.M. Jarpe M.B. Leach K.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 142: 1-7Google Scholar). The canonical model of lipid-mediated signal transduction assumes that all induced lipid metabolism occurs at the plasma membrane and that the nuclear envelope is a passive participant in the transduction cascade. In the NEST hypothesis, just as the plasma membrane serves as the communication link between the extracellular environment and the cytoplasm, the nuclear envelope mediates the transmission of cytosolic signals to the nucleoplasm. Recently, our laboratory and others have presented compelling data supporting this hypothesis (15Jarpe M.B. Leach K.L. Raben D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 526-534Google Scholar, 16Raben D.M.

Jarpe M.B. Adams L.D. Fabbro D. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21816-21822Google Scholar). One of the PC-hydrolyzing enzymes, PLD, has been identified in the nucleus of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (19Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11738-11740Google Scholar, 20Huang C. Wykle R.L. Daniel L.W. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16859-16865Google Scholar, 21Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29843-29847Google Scholar), and further studies indicated that this activity may be modulated by RhoA (21Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29843-29847Google Scholar). These data suggest that a nuclear PLD is present in these cells, and its activity can be modulated by known signal transduction components. Clearly, a central tenet of the NEST hypothesis is that the enzymatic activities involved in this cascade are induced in an agonist-dependent manner. Such an agonist-induced nuclear activity has not been demonstrated. The data in this report are the first to demonstrate an agonist-induced increase in a nuclear PLD activity. This activity contributes to the production of nuclear PA but does not affect the level of nuclear DG generated in response to α-thrombin. RhoA translocates to the nucleus in response to α-thrombin, and removal of this GTP-binding protein with a RhoGDI results in a dose-dependent decrease in nuclear PLD activity. Taken together, the data demonstrate that the addition of α-thrombin to quiescent fibroblasts leads to the translocation of RhoA to the nucleus, which mediates the activation of a nuclear PLD.

GTPγS was from Boehringer Mannheim. Anti-RhoA antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz (SC-179G). Radiolabels were purchased from Amersham Corp. IIC9 cells, a subclone of CHEF18, were grown and serum deprived as described previously (1Wright T.M. Willenberger S. Raben D.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 395-400Google Scholar, 15Jarpe M.B. Leach K.L.

The medium was removed and replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml grade bovine serum albumin and supplemented with 5 μg/ml human transferrin (serum-free medium). The cells were serum deprived for 2 days and then washed twice in serum-free medium. They were incubated at 37°C in the fresh serum-free medium for at least 30 min before beginning the experiment. For each experiment, cells were then incubated at 37°C in serum-free medium either alone or containing 1 NIH unit/ml α-thrombin in the presence or absence of ethanol as indicated in the figure legends. Nuclei were isolated essentially as described previously (15Jarpe M.B. Leach K.L. Raben D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 526-534Google Scholar, 18Leach K.L. Ruff V.A. Jarpe M.B. Adams L.D. Fabbro D. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21816-21822Google Scholar). Briefly, incubations were terminated by removal of medium, transferring the dishes immediately to an ice bath and adding 4 ml of ice-cold fractionation buffer (buffer B: 10 mM Tris, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μM leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μM quinacrine, and 200 μM 2-nitro-4-carboxyphenyl N,N-diphenylcarbamate, pH 7.5 at 4°C). The cells were scraped from the dishes and subjected to 15 passes in a Potter type Teflon on glass homogenizer. Homogenates from four dishes were used for quantification of DG levels. Homogenation and subsequent steps were carried out at 4°C. Nuclei were isolated by centrifugation of the homogenate at 2,000 rpm (700 × g) for 7 min in an RT6000B centrifuge with a swinging bucket rotor. The pellet was dispersed in 5 ml of fractionation buffer and homogenized using a Dounce-type homogenizer with a tight fitting (type B) pestle for 20 passes and layered over a 5-ml cushion of 45% sucrose in fractionation buffer, followed by centrifugation at 2,800 rpm (1,660 × g) for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 0.8 ml of buffer B, and a small aliquot was assessed quickly for gross contamination by whole cells and other large debris by light microscopy. For nuclear lipid analysis, isolated nuclei (typically 50 μg of nuclear protein) were suspended in 0.8 ml of water and transferred into 1 ml of chloroform. The centrifuge tube was washed twice with 1 ml of methanol, and the wash was added to the water and chloroform. Nuclear lipids were extracted (30Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) and dried under a stream of dry nitrogen. All other assays, including in vivo assay for PLD, analysis of PA levels, analysis of DG levels, in vitro assay for PLD, treatment of nuclei with RhoGDI, Western blot analysis, were performed as described in the figure legends. Protein was quantified as described by Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, PEt in nuclei from cells exposed to α-thrombin in the presence of ethanol was approximately a 2-fold higher than it was in nuclei isolated from cells exposed to either alone. These data are consistent with the notion that α-thrombin induced the activation of a PLD, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of nuclear PC. The above data demonstrating an activation of PLD acting on the nucleus implies that α-thrombin-induced increase in nuclear PA should be blunted in the presence of ethanol. Indeed, α-thrombin induced an increase in nuclear PA. Radiolabeled PA as a percentage of total labeled nuclear lipid was 0.233 ± 0.072 in quiescent cells and 0.427 ± 0.034, n = 4, after incubation of cells for 15 min with α-thrombin (1 NIH unit/ml). In the presence of 1% ethanol, the increase in PA induced by α-thrombin was only 49%, significantly less than the 82% increase induced by α-thrombin without ethanol. These data are consistent with the data presented in Fig. 1 demonstrating the activation of a PLD, which acts on the nuclear membrane, and they indicate that this PLD is responsible for most of the PA generated in the nucleus in response to α-thrombin. In previous reports, we demonstrated in whole cells that although α-thrombin induced the activation of a PLD resulting in the formation of PA, a PC-PLC was responsible for the generation of PC-derived DGs (1Wright T.M. Willenberger S. Raben D.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 395-400Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that α-thrombin induced an increase in nuclear DGs in IIC9 cells and that these DGs are derived from PC (1Wright T.M. Willenberger S. Raben D.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 395-400Google Scholar, 15Jarpe M.B. Leach K.L. Raben D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 526-534Google Scholar, 17Leach K.L. Raben D.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 879-883Google Scholar, 18Leach K.L. Ruff V.A. Jarpe M.B. Adams L.D. Fabbro D. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21816-21822Google Scholar). Because the presence of ethanol inhibited the formation of PA but not DGs even though approximately 50% of the whole-cell DGs induced by α-thrombin reside in the nucleus (15Jarpe M.B. Leach K.L. Raben D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 526-534Google Scholar), it is unlikely that the nuclear DGs are derived by a PLD/PA-phosphohydrolase pathway. To test this directly, we evaluated the effect of ethanol on the generation of nuclear DGs in response to α-thrombin. As shown in Fig. 2, the presence of ethanol does not significantly affect the production of α-thrombin-induced nuclear DGs generated in radiolabeled cells. Similar results have been obtained when the nuclear DG mass is quantified using the DG kinase assay (29 and data not shown). These data demonstrate that the induced nuclear PLD is not involved in the generation of nuclear DGs. In view of previously published data demonstrating that these DGs are derived from PC (15Jarpe M.B. Leach K.L. Raben D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 526-534Google Scholar, 18Leach K.L. Ruff V.A. Jarpe M.B. Adams L.D. Fabbro D. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21816-21822Google Scholar), the present data implicate a PC-PLC in the production of these lipids. In view of the above, it was important to determine if the PLD activated in response to α-thrombin was a membrane-associated enzyme. We examined, therefore, the PLD activity in nuclei isolated from quiescent and α-thrombin-induced cells. As shown in Fig. 3, PLD activity was increased maximally in the nuclei isolated from α-thrombin-stimulated cells after a 15- and 20-min exposure to α-thrombin. The data are consistent with the notion that this enzyme is not involved in the production of nuclear DGs as the PLD activity was elevated well after the major increase in nuclear DGs occurred (15Jarpe M.B. Leach K.L. Raben D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 526-534Google Scholar, 18Leach K.L. Ruff V.A. Jarpe M.B. Adams L.D. Fabbro D. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21816-21822Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that a PLD activated in response to α-thrombin is associated with the nucleus. There is now strong evidence to suggest that small molecular weight GTP-binding proteins, RhoA in particular, are involved in activating PLD (21Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29843-29847Google Scholar). RhoA-mediated PLD activity requires that RhoA be constitutively present in nuclei or translocate to the nucleus in an agonist-induced manner. Western blot analysis of proteins in nuclei isolated from quiescent cells and α-thrombin-induced cultures demonstrated that RhoA translocates to the nucleus in response to α-thrombin (Fig. 4). To investigate further the role of RhoA, nuclei isolated from α-thrombin-induced cultures were treated with RhoGDI, and the level of PLD activity was quantified. As shown in Fig. 5, treatment of these nuclei with RhoGDI resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in nuclear PLD activity. Because this GDI can interact with several members of the Rho family, released protein was examined by Western blot analysis. Only RhoA was found to be released (data not shown). Addition of recombinant, prenylated RhoA, in the presence of GTPγS, restored the activity in the RhoGDI-treated membranes (Fig. 6). Interestingly, this RhoA also activates a PLD activity in nuclei isolated from quiescent cells (Fig. 6), suggesting that the enzyme resides in the nucleus. These data provide strong evidence indicating a role for RhoA in the α-thrombin-induced activation of a nuclear PLD.Fig. 6Effect of RhoA on PLD activity present in RhoGDI-treated and quiescent nuclei. [3H]Myristate-labeled nuclei were isolated from quiescent and α-thrombin-treated cultures (1 NIH unit/ml at 37°C for 15 min) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 50 μg of nuclear protein of the nuclei isolated from the α-thrombin-induced cultures was preincubated with the indicated concentrations of GST-tagged RhoGDI for 30 min at 37°C. 50 μg of nuclei isolated from α-thrombin-treated cultures was treated with GST-RhoGDI (6 μM). These GST-RhoGDI-treated nuclei, as well as 50 μg of nuclei isolated from quiescent cells, were then incubated for 30 min at 37°C in the presence of 50 μM GTPγS and 1% ethanol with or without 5 μM prenylated RhoA. [3H]PEt was isolated and quantified as described in the legend to Fig. 5 (PEt generated in nuclei isolated from the α-thrombin-induced cultures was 7,460 ± 70 cpm/50 μg of protein containing ≈ 9.2 × 105 cpm.)

(n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The canonical model of signal transduction cascades involves the initiation of signals at the plasma membrane which stimulate specific cascades leading to the stimulation of activities in target organelles such as the nucleus. For some time it has been assumed that the nuclear envelope played a passive role in these signal transduction cascades. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that the nuclear envelope is an active participant in signaling cascades, a process we have termed NEST, and that a major component of these cascades is the induction of specific nuclear lipid metabolism (15Jarpe M.B. Leach K.L. Raben D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 526-534Google Scholar–21Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29843-29847Google Scholar). In this report we present the first evidence for the involvement of a PC-PLD in NEST and identify one of the components involved in coupling the canonical plasma membrane signaling cascades to this novel pathway in the nuclear envelope. Our data demonstrate that the addition of a potent mitogen, α-thrombin, to quiescent IIC9 cells results in increased nuclear PLD activity. This is evidenced by the α-thrombin-induced increase in PEt (Fig. 1) and the increased nuclear PLD activity in nuclei isolated from α-thrombin-induced cultures (Fig. 3). We further demonstrate that RhoA is at least one of the factors involved in this activation. RhoA translocates to the membrane in response to α-thrombin, and treating nuclei isolated from α-thrombin-induced cultures with RhoGDI results in a dose-dependent decrease in PLD activity (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). Taken together, these data suggest that the addition of α-thrombin to quiescent IIC9 cells induces the translocation of RhoA to the nucleus resulting in the stimulation of nuclear PLD. Because the GST-tagged RhoGDI used in these studies is too large (≈50 kDa) to diffuse through a nuclear pore, the above data suggest that the α-thrombin-activated nuclear PLD is located on the outer nuclear membrane. In these studies, however, we cannot distinguish between a PLD resident in the outer nuclear membrane which is activated in response to α-thrombin and a cytosolic PLD that is translocated to the nucleus during the activation cascade. The activated PLD may translocate to the nucleus, or agonist-induced changes in the nuclear envelope may promote the association of the enzyme with the envelope where it is then activated. Further experiments are in progress to discriminate between these possibilities. These and other data lend further support to the notion that mitogens activate a PC cycle in the nuclear envelope as a component of NEST. Our data indicate that a PLD is activated by α-thrombin, which hydrolyzes PC, resulting in the production of PA in the nuclear envelope. Our data also support the notion that a PC-PLC is involved in the generation of nuclear DGs (15Jarpe M.B. Leach K.L. Raben D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 526-534Google Scholar). If a PC cycle were operating in the nucleus, enzymes involved in the biosynthesis would be expected to be present in the nucleus. Indeed, one of the enzymes involved in PC biosynthesis, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, has also been localized in the nucleus (40Wang Y. MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 354-360Google Scholar, 41Wang Y. MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5512-5518Google Scholar, 42Wang Y. Sweitzer T.D. Weinhold P.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5899-5904Google Scholar). This enzyme is particularly interesting as it often serves as the regulatory enzyme in PC biosynthesis, and its activity is regulated by diacylglycerol (43Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Google Scholar, 44Kolesnick R.N. Hemer M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10900-10904Google Scholar). Taken together, these data provide strong support for the hypothesis that mitogens activate a PC cycle in the nuclear envelope as a component of NEST.

We utilized as bait the sequence between −180 and −136 in the pro-α2(I) collagen promoter because it acts as a functional promoter element and binds several DNA-binding proteins. Three cDNA clones were isolated that encoded portions of the mouse SPR2 transcription factor, whereas a fourth cDNA contained a potential open reading frame for a polypeptide of 775 amino acids and was designated BFCOL1. Recombinant BFCOL1 was shown to bind to the −180 to −152 segment of the mouse pro-α2(I) collagen proximal promoter and to two discrete sites in the proximal promoter of the mouse pro-α1(I) gene. The N-terminal portion of BFCOL1 contains its DNA-binding domain. DNA transfection experiments using fusion polypeptides with the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding segment indicated that the C-terminal part of BFCOL1 contained a potential transcriptional activation domain.

We speculate that BFCOL1 participates in the transcriptional control of the two type I collagen genes. Type I collagen is a protein that is abundantly synthesized by a discrete number of cell types including osteoblasts, odontoblasts, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and mesenchymal cells. It is composed of two α1 chains and one α2 chain forming a characteristic triple helix. Expression of the genes for these polypeptides is coordinately regulated in a variety of physiological and pathological situations (1Vuorio E. de Crombrugghe B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 837-872Google Scholar). Changes in the synthesis of type I collagen occur not only during embryonic development in specific tissues but changes also take place in disease states, for example during wound healing as well as in fibrotic diseases such as lung fibrosis, cirrhosis, and scleroderma. In many of these instances it is likely that the control of expression of the two type I collagen genes is mainly exerted at the level of transcription, but the precise mechanisms that control transcription of these genes are still poorly understood. Our long term goal is to identify the critical cis-acting elements in these two genes and both the cell-specific and ubiquitous transcription factors that presumably control their expression. Recently, transgenic mouse studies have identified strong tissue-specific enhancer elements in the 5′-flanking regions of both type I collagen genes (2Rossert J. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1421-1432Google Scholar, 3Pavlin D. Lichtler A.C. Bedalov A. Kream B.E. Harrison J.R. Thomas H.F. Gronowicz G.A. Clark S.H. Woody C.O. Rowe D.W. J.

Eberspaecher H. Smith C. Black C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1333-1344Google Scholar). These elements are located further upstream than the proximal promoter elements. For instance, in the mouse pro-α1(I) gene, a potent enhancer element for osteoblast and odontoblast expression was localized about 1.6 kilobases (kb) 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobasebpbase pairCBFCCAAT-binding factorGSTglutathione S-transferaseCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseIF-1inhibitory factor 1RT-PCRreverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. upstream of the start of transcription, whereas another strong element for expression in tendon and fascia fibroblasts was found between −2.3 and −3.2 kb (2Rossert J. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1421-1432Google Scholar). Similar experiments from other laboratories have produced analogous results (3Pavlin D. Lichtler A.C. Bedalov A.

Biol. 1991; 11: 2066-2074Google Scholar). These experiments strongly suggested that separate elements control the expression of this gene in different type I collagen-producing cells. In the pro-α2(I) gene, an element that strongly enhanced expression in fibroblasts and mesenchymal cells was located between 13.5 and 17.5 kb upstream of the transcription start (5Bou-Gharios G.

Previous studies have identified several functional cis-acting elements in the 350-bp (base pair) proximal promoter of the mouse pro-α2(I) collagen gene (6Schmidt A. Rossi P. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 347-354Google Scholar). These included a binding site for the ubiquitous heterotrimeric CCAAT-binding factor (CBF), between −75 and −98 (7Hatamochi A. Paterson B. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11310-11314Google Scholar, 8Hatamochi A. Golumbek P.T. Van Schaftingen E. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol.

Science. 1988; 241: 582-585Google Scholar), redundant GC-rich binding sites for several proteins between −65 and −105, between −114 and −131, and between −152 and −176 (10Hasegawa T. Zhou X. Garrett L.A. Ruteshouser E.C. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3253-3260Google Scholar). Several classes of proteins that are mainly ubiquitous proteins bind to these redundant sites. Transient expression and in vitro transcription experiments with wild-type and mutant templates indicated that the segment between −40 and −170 containing the three redundant elements was essential for promoter activation. Other studies identified three short cis-acting GC-rich elements in the human pro-α2(I) collagen gene between −323 and −264 (11Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Google Scholar) that were capable of binding SP1. Additional studies presented evidence that a protein complex which includes SP1 binds to this segment of the human promoter and participates in the transforming growth factor-β activation of this promoter (12Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Google Scholar). In the mouse promoter there is also a binding site for CTF/NF1 between −305 and −290 (13Oikarinen J. Hatamochi A. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11064-11070Google Scholar). In the mouse pro-α1(I) collagen gene, the sequence between −220 and the TATA box presents strong homologies with the sequence of the pro-α2(I) gene in the same region. This DNA segment contains binding sites for DNA-binding factors that also bind to the proximal pro-α2(I) promoter. The DNA elements in the pro-α1(I) promoter include a binding site for CBF between −90 and −115, two apparently redundant sites between −190 and −170 and between −160 and −130 for a DNA-binding protein previously designated inhibitory factor 1 (IF-1), and two sites between −130 and −80 that flank the CBF-binding site and are binding sites for SP1 and probably other GC-rich binding proteins (14Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9934-9942Google Scholar). DNA transfection experiments with the pro-α1(I) promoter showed that point mutations in the CBF-binding site decreased promoter activity, whereas small substitution mutations in some of the other sites resulted in an increase in transcription (14Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9934-9942Google Scholar, 15Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 538-544Google Scholar). It was also shown that the sequence of the pro-α2(I) promoter between −173 and −143 was able to compete for the binding of a protein that was forming a major DNA-protein complex with two redundant elements in the pro-α1(I) promoter between −190 and −170 and between −160 and −130, suggesting that both type I promoters contained binding sites for the same proteins (15Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 538-544Google Scholar). Fig. 1 summarizes binding sites for DNA binding proteins in the two mouse proximal type I collagen promoters. The purpose of the present study was to identify one or more trans-acting factors that bind to these proximal cis-acting elements in the type I collagen promoters. We have used the sequence between −180 to −136 of the pro-α2(I) collagen promoter to clone cDNAs for proteins binding to this segment using the yeast one-hybrid system (16Wang M.M. Reed R.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 121-126Google Scholar, 17Li J.J. Herskowitz I. Science. 1993; 262: 1870-1874Google Scholar). This segment was chosen mainly because previous experiments with the pro-α2(I) proximal promoter showed that the DNA segment between −180 and −136 was capable of binding an array of DNA-binding proteins, many of which also bound to the same promoter between −133 and −105 and between −105 and −65; the sequence between −180 and −136 was also binding these proteins with greater efficiency than the more proximal sequences (10Hasegawa T. Zhou X. Garrett L.A. Ruteshouser E.C. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3253-3260Google Scholar). One of the cDNAs that was cloned encodes a polypeptide of 775 amino acids, which also bound to two discrete sites in the pro-α1(I) collagen promoter. The yeast strain BY 164 (MAT a his3 δ 200 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 lys2-801a trp1a) was provided by Dr. Stevan Marcus. The yeast reporter plasmid was constructed as follows. Six tandem copies of a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the sequence from −180 to −136 bp of the mouse pro-α2(I) collagen promoter were inserted into the BamHI site of the vector pRS315HIS containing the LEU2 gene as selectable marker (16Wang M.M.

Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Google Scholar) to generate pRS315HIS-6x160 (160 denotes the sequence between −180 and −136). The XbaI-SalI fragment of pRS315HIS-6x160 was then subcloned into the XbaI-SalI site of the vector pRS305 (16Wang M.M. Reed R.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 121-126Google Scholar); this plasmid was designated pRS305HIS-6x160. After digestion with ClaI, this vector was used for transformation. Yeast transformation was performed by the polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate method (20Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20Google Scholar). Plasmid integration in the genome of yeast strains was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide from −180 to −136 bp. Cells were then plated on a minimal synthetic dextrose plate without histidine to verify background HIS3 gene activity. One of the yeast strains that had minimal HIS3 gene activity was also selected as the strain for the transformation after the initial selection. Plasmid pJL638-6x160 contained six tandem copies of the sequence from −180 to −136 of the mouse pro-α2(I) promoter in the pBgl-lacZ plasmid harboring the URA3 gene as a selectable marker (17Li J.J. Herskowitz I. Science. 1993; 262: 1870-1874Google Scholar). The yeast strain in which both pRS305HIS-6x160 and pJL638-6x160 plasmids were integrated was used for cDNA library transformation. However, because lacZ was constitutively expressed at low levels in this strain, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside staining could not be used for screening HIS3-positive colonies. cDNAs were generated from the mRNA of primary fibroblasts of 14-day mouse embryos by priming with either oligo(dT) or with a random hexamer using the TimeSaver cDNA synthesis kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and cloned into the EcoRI-NotI site or EcoRI site of plasmid pPC86 containing the TRP1 gene as a selectable marker (19Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Google Scholar). The ligation products were electroporated into the Escherichia coli strain MC1061, and the resultant transformants (6 × 106 for the directionally cloned library, 3 × 106 for the non-directionally cloned plasmid library) were plated onto ampicillin plates. After scraping the cells from the plates, the plasmid library was purified with Promega's Wizard™ Maxiprep DNA purification system with additional phenol and chloroform extractions. Ten to 20 μg of cDNA plasmid from the libraries were transformed into the yeast strain harboring the two reporter plasmids integrated into the genome and plated onto plates lacking leucine, uracil, tryptophan, histidine, and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Transformation efficiency was about 2-3 × 105/μg cDNA plasmid. Colonies were picked after 5-7 days. Plasmid cDNAs were extracted and used for retransformation either into the same yeast strain or the yeast strain into which plasmid pRS305-HIS plasmid instead of pRS305-HIS-6x160 plasmid had been integrated. DNA sequencing was carried out using a primer present in the DNA for the GAL4 transactivation domain (5′-GGATGTTTAATACCACT-3′) or T3, T7, and SP6 primers. Three different recombinant polypeptides corresponding to the full-length, the N-terminal part, and the C-terminal part of BFCOL1 were generated using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega Corp). For the full-length polypeptide, the SalI-NotI fragment of pPC86-BFCOL1 was inserted into the SalI-NotI site of the pBluescript KS vector (pBS-BFCOL1-full). For the N-terminal and C-terminal polypeptides, the SalI-NsiI fragment and the ScaI-NotI fragment of pPC86-BFCOL1 DNA were inserted into the SalI-PstI site of pGEM 5Zf(+) and the EcoRV-NotI site of pBluescript KS to generate p5Zf-BFCOL1-N and pBS-BFCOL1-C, respectively. 35S-Labeled polypeptide products were analyzed using 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These were exposed to Fuji RX film. Three different fusion polypeptides were generated. For the full-length and N-terminal fusion polypeptides, the SalI-NotI fragment of pPC86-BFCOL1 and the SalI-NotI fragment of p5Zf-BFCOL1-N were inserted, respectively, into the XhoI-NotI site of the pGEX-4T-3 vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). For the C-terminal fusion polypeptide, the SalI-NotI fragment of pBS-BFCOL1-C was inserted into the SalI-NotI site of the pGEX-4T-3 vector. Procedures for production and purification of fusion polypeptides were carried out as suggested by the manufacturer. DNA-binding reactions were performed according to the method of the Core Footprinting System (Promega Corp). Ten femtomoles (1 μl) of the end-labeled BamHI-NarI fragment containing the −350 to +7-bp sequence of the pro-α2(I) collagen promoter inserted in the HindIII site of pA3LUC (20Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20Google Scholar) was used as a DNA substrate. Binding reactions were started by addition of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein or GST-BFCOL1 full-length recombinant polypeptide. At the end of the reaction the samples were heat-denatured and loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gel. Gels were then autoradiographed at −80°C with an intensifying screen. One microliter of recombinant protein (either products of in vitro transcription and translation or GST-fusion polypeptides) was incubated with 5 fmol of end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide in a volume of 10 μl. Incubation was carried out at room temperature for 20 min. All binding reactions contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4% glycerol, 50 mM NaC1, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 μg of poly(dA-dT). Following electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide Tris borate/EDTA gel, the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography at room temperature. The SP1 consensus oligonucleotide was purchased from Promega. The Krox consensus oligonucleotide (23Nardelli J. Gibson T. Charnay P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4137-4144Google Scholar) and other oligonucleotides containing specific sequences of the pro-α1(I) and pro-α2(I) collagen promoters were produced by an oligonucleotide synthesizer. Sequences of oligonucleotides used for competition experiments are listed in Fig. 2. The SmaI-SacI fragment of pPC86-BFCOL1, which contains the full-length DNA of BFCOL1, and the ScaI fragment of pPC86-BFCOL1, which contains the N-terminal portion of BFCOL1, were subcloned into the SmaI-SacI- and SmaI-digested pSG424 vector, respectively (24Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Google Scholar). In the case of the plasmid containing the C-terminal part of BFCOL1, we first made two constructs. First, the XhoI-BamHI fragment of pAS2 (25Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Google Scholar) containing the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 as well as several cloning sites was subcloned into pSG424 to add supplementary cloning sites (pSG424 m). Second, the ScaI-NotI fragment of pPC86-BFCOL1 that contained the C-terminal part of BFCOL1 was subcloned into the EcoRV-NotI site of plasmid pCITE-2a (Novagen, Inc.) (pCITE-2a-BFCOL1-C). Finally, the NdeI-XhoI fragment of pCITE-2a-BFCOL1-C was subcloned into the NdeI-SalI site of pSG424-m to make the pSG424-BFCOL1-C. Transfections were carried out using 10 μg of the reporter plasmid containing the GAL-binding sites upstream of an SV40 promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, 5 μg of pSG424-derivative plasmid, and 5 μg of SVβgal plasmid into 714 BALB 3T3 fibroblasts cells (26Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). Cells were harvested after 48 h and assayed for CAT activity (27Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 444-447Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured with a resorufin-β-D-galactopyranoside substrate (Boehringer Mannheim). Total RNA was extracted from 714 BALB 3T3 fibroblasts, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, S194 B cells, and EL4 T cells using TRIzol™ solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). About 20 μg of each total RNA preparation was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels containing 1.1 M formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Corp.). mRNA was detected with a 32P-labeled EcoRI-BamHI fragment of BFCOL1 (Multiprime labeling system, Amersham Corp.) after hybridization for 18 h at 42°C in 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE is composed of 0.18 M NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.7), and 1 mM EDTA), 5 × Denhardt's solution (1 × Denhardt's solution is composed of 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% Ficoll, and 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone), 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 50 μg/ml heat-denatured salmon testis DNA, and radioactive probe. Membranes were washed twice for 15 min each at 65°C in a solution containing 2 × SSC (1 × SSC is composed of 0.15 M NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS, then once in 1 × SSC with 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65°C, and finally twice for 15 min each in 0.1% SSC with 0.1% SDS at room temperature. The membranes were then autoradiographed at −80°C using Fuji RX film. Human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (Ambion) was used as an internal control. Total RNA of S194 B cells, HT29 cells, and HSC34 cells were annealed with the oligonucleotide 5′-CTCTTAATCTCCACATTCAGTGCCTG-3′ (12c) and reverse-transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. The cDNA products were then subjected to PCR using oligonucleotides 12n 5′-AATAGTAAGAGAAGTCTGAA-3′ and 12c. The sense strands of 12n and 12c are indicated in Fig. 3, A and B. Previous studies indicated that the GC-rich DNA segment between −180 and −136 of the mouse pro-α2(I) collagen gene was able to bind several different DNA-binding proteins in vitro and that this segment was also able to compete for the binding of proteins to two other redundant but discrete sites closer to the transcription start site of this promoter (10Hasegawa T. Zhou X. Garrett L.A. Ruteshouser E.C. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3253-3260Google Scholar). A deletion of this same segment resulted in substantial decrease in promoter activity. To begin to identify some of the proteins that bound to this segment, we used this DNA as bait in the yeast one-hybrid system and screened two mouse embryo fibroblast cDNA libraries, one primed with oligo(dT) (library 1) and the other primed with a random hexamer oligonucleotide (library 2). In the yeast strain that was used for selection, plasmid pRS305-HIS-6x160 was integrated into the genome. In this plasmid, six tandem copies of the sequence of the pro-α2(I) gene between −180 and −136 were cloned upstream of a minimal yeast GAL1 promoter itself linked to the HIS3 gene. After screening six million independent colonies from library 1 and three million from library 2, an initial 81 histidine-positive colonies from library 1 and 44 histidine-positive colonies from library 2 were picked; 17 cDNA plasmids from library 1 and 12 cDNA plasmids from library 2 gave positive colonies upon retransformation of the parental strain. However, most of these also gave histidine-positive colonies with the yeast strain in which the control plasmid pRS305-HIS was integrated, a plasmid that contains the minimal GAL1 promoter but not six tandem copies of the −180 to −136 sequence. Only four cDNAs, all from library 1, could specifically activate the HIS3 gene of the yeast strain containing the pRS305-HIS-6x160 plasmid without activating the HIS3 gene of the strain with the pRS305-HIS control plasmid. This suggested the possibility that the recombinant fusion polypeptides encoded by each of these four cDNAs might bind specifically to the −180 to −136-bp segment of the pro-α2(I) collagen gene and not to the DNA sequence of the GAL1 minimal promoter. One cDNA clone was designated as BFCOL1 (see below). Two other cDNAs contained an almost full-length coding sequence for mouse SPR-2 (28Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Google Scholar), and the fourth cDNA was a shorter partial cDNA for SPR-2. Fig. 3A presents the sequence of BFCOL1 cDNA. The open reading frame starting from the first methionine codon in the cDNA is 2328 nucleotides long and encodes a putative polypeptide of 775 amino acids. The amino acid sequence corresponding to the N-terminal 400 amino acids of BFCOL1 presents a 95% identity with human htβ, a protein previously identified as binding to the promoter of the gene for the Vβ8.1 chain of the human T cell receptor (29Wang Y. Kobori J.A. Hood L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5691-5701Google Scholar). Subsequent to the codon for amino acid 400 in BFCOL1, the reported nucleotide sequence of htβ DNA displays two translational frame changes compared with that of BFCOL1 immediately followed by a termination codon (29Wang Y. Kobori J.A. Hood L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5691-5701Google Scholar). The sequence of the 340 amino acids at the C terminus of BFCOL1 has no significant amino acid sequence homology with other polypeptides present in Genebank data bases. The nucleotide sequence preceding the initial methionine codon of BFCOL1 is also similar to that of htβ except that the first 25 nucleotide residues at the 5′ end of the cDNA of BFCOL1 are different from comparable residues in htβ. As reported for htβ, the deduced amino acid sequence of BFCOL1 contains four potential zinc finger motifs. Since the reported nucleotide sequence of the cDNA of htβ following the termination codon is also about 90% identical to that of BFCOL1 DNA, we performed RT-PCR experiments in order to verify the nucleotide sequence of the human homologue of BFCOL1 RNA. We used two primers that bracketed the sequence containing the reported frameshifts and stop codon in htβ and RNAs from two different human cell lines, the colon carcinoma cell line HT29 and the stomach cell line HSC34. The location of the primers that were used (12n, 12c) are indicated in Fig. 3A. The sequence of the PCR product from the RNAs of these human cells is presented in Fig. 3B and shows a continuous open reading frame without the frameshifts that were reported earlier. We then asked whether the entire open reading frame shown in Fig. 3A was translated into a polypeptide of the expected size, and we constructed three plasmids for in vitro transcription-translation. One plasmid encoded the full-length BFCOL1 (pBS-BFCOL1-full, from 1 to 2426), whereas the others encoded the N-terminal part (p5Zf-BFCOL1-N, from 1 to 1156) and the C-terminal segment (pBS-BFCOL1-C, from 1395 to 2426) of BFCOL1. The major product of pBS-BFCOL1-full (Fig. 4, lane 1) was a single polypeptide, whereas the DNA of p5Zf-BFCOL1-N (lane 2) gave rise to two major polypeptides and several fainter species. The major polypeptide species appeared to run more slowly by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis than expected from their estimated molecular sizes (expected sizes are 89 kDa for pBS-BFCOL1-full and 43 kDa for p5Zf-BFCOL1-N) maybe due to increased SDS binding. The major product of pBS-BFCOL1-C (Fig. 4, lane 3) was a single polypeptide that had about the expected size (estimated size is 37 kDa). Gel shift experiments were performed with the −180 to −136 DNA segment of the mouse pro-α2(I) collagen promoter that was used in the one-hybrid screen to verify whether BFCOL1 was able to form a DNA-protein complex under the conditions of this assay and to determine which segment of the BFCOL1 polypeptide contained a DNA-binding domain. In these experiments, the products of in vitro transcription-translation shown in Fig. 4 were tested. With the full-length BFCOL1, one major protein-DNA complex was detected (Fig. 5, lane 4), whereas two protein-DNA complexes were seen with the N-terminal BFCOL1 (Fig. 5, lane 3), the upper complex being less intense than the lower complex, although both complexes were migrating faster than the complex with full-length BFCOL1. The presence of these two complexes could possibly be a result of the heterogeneity of protein products observed with the cDNA for N-terminal BFCOL1 (see Fig. 4, lane 2). With the polypeptide corresponding to the C-terminal part of BFCOL1, no protein-DNA complexes were detected other than nonspecific bands (Fig. 5, lane 2). These results suggested that the N-terminal part of BFCOL1 contained a DNA-binding domain and that DNA binding might be mediated by the four tandem zinc fingers, consistent with previous results obtained with htβ (29Wang Y. Kobori J.A. Hood L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5691-5701Google Scholar). The proximal promoter of the mouse pro-α2(I) collagen gene contains several redundant GC-rich elements. To examine whether other segments of the 350-bp proximal promoter of this gene contained binding sites for BFCOL1, in vitro DNase I footprints were performed using a recombinant GST-full-length BFCOL1 fusion polypeptide and the promoter segment from −350 to +7. As shown in Fig. 6, the recombinant GST-full-length BFCOL1 fusion polypeptide protected the region between −180 and −152 (lane 2) and only this segment. When a similar DNase I footprint was performed using the promoter labeled on the other strand (lane 4), again no other protected regions were observed. Hence, recombinant BFCOL1 binds only to one specific sequence in this proximal promoter and not to other GC-rich sequences. To further confirm the specific binding of BFCOL1 to a discrete site in the proximal promoter of the pro-α2(I) collagen gene, gel shift experiments were performed using a 32P-labeled −180 to −136 oligonucleotide as probe and several competitor DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to specific sequences present in the mouse pro-α2(I) collagen proximal promoter (Fig. 7). In this experiment, the product of full-length BFCOL1 DNA was used, generated by in vitro transcription-translation. As expected, the −180 to −136 oligonucleotide (lane 2) competed for binding, as did, with somewhat less efficiency, the shorter −176 to −152 oligonucleotide (lane 3), which is included in the former. Other oligonucleotides from −140 to −86 (lane 4), from −135 to −104 (lane 5), from −105 to −65, which includes the CBF-binding site (lane 6), and from −315 to −284, which includes a CTF/NF1-binding site (lane 7), were unable to compete. An SP1 consensus oligonucleotide had practically no effect (lane 8), and an oligonucleotide containing a Krox consensus binding site was also u"
https://openalex.org/W2081972364,"The promoter of the human POLD1 gene encoding the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase δ is G/C-rich and does not contain a TATA box. Transient transfection analysis in HeLa cells employing POLD1-luciferase chimeric plasmids revealed a core promoter region extending 328 base pairs (bp) from the major transcription initiation site. Multiple elements in this region including two 11-bp direct repeats located between nucleotide positions −92 and −22, play an important role in POLD1 promoter activity. Deletion or linker-replacement mutations of the repeats drastically reduced the promoter activity. A 70-bp DNA fragment containing the two repeats could stimulate the expression of the POLD1 or a heterologous promoter in an orientation-independent manner. DNase I footprinting and band-shift assays showed that HeLa nuclear extracts contained proteins specifically binding to the repeat sequences. Southwestern blot and UV cross-linking analyses identified Sp1 and two 85-kDa proteins that bound to the repeats. Additionally, screening of HeLa cDNA expression libraries for the sequence-specific DNA-binding protein using the 11-bp repeat sequences as the probe, identified a cDNA that corresponds to Sp3, a member of the Sp1 family. Cotransfection studies in Drosophila SL2 cells showed that both Sp1 and Sp3, but not Sp2, could activate the POLD1 promoter through the repeat sequences. The POLD1 promoter activity was induced about 4-fold at the late G1/S boundary in serum-stimulated cells. The 11-bp repeats together with an E2F-like sequence, located adjacent to the major transcription initiation site, were important for the stimulation. Taken together, this study provides a direct evidence for transcriptional regulation of the human POLD1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2007399721,"The Escherichia coli UvrB and UvrC proteins play key roles in DNA damage processing and incisions during nucleotide excision repair. To study the DNA structural requirements and protein-DNA intermediates formed during these processes, benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide-damaged and structure-specific 50-base pair substrates were constructed. DNA fragments containing a preexisting 3′ incision were rapidly and efficiently incised 5′ to the adduct. Gel mobility shift assays indicated that this substrate supported UvrA dissociation from the UvrB-DNA complex, which led to efficient incision. Experiments with a DNA fragment containing an internal noncomplementary 11-base region surrounding the benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide adduct indicated that UvrABC nuclease does not require fully duplexed DNA for binding and incision. In the absence of UvrA, UvrB (UvrC) bound to an 11-base noncomplementary region containing a 3′ nick (Y substrate), forming a stable protein-DNA complex (Kd∼5-10 nM). Formation of this complex was absolutely dependent upon UvrC. Addition to this complex of ATP, but not adenosine 5′-(β,γ-iminotriphosphate) or adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate, caused incision three or four nucleotides 5′ to the double strand-single strand junction. The ATPase activity of native UvrB is activated upon interaction with UvrC and enhanced further by the addition of Y substrate. Incision of this Y structure occurs even without DNA damage.

https://openalex.org/W2004373826,"The Dbl-like guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Lbc oncoprotein specifically activates the small GTP-binding protein Rho in mammalian fibroblasts to induce transformation and actin stress fiber formation, whereas another Dbl-related molecule, Cdc24, stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange of the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 to elicit effects on both gene induction and actin-based cytoskeleton change in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To understand the mechanism of these functional interactions, we have taken a biochemical approach to probe the sites on Rho and Cdc42 that are involved in coupling to their respective GEFs, the Lbc and Cdc24 proteins. Point mutations in the switch II region of the small G-proteins, many of which would affect the interaction with GEF in the case of Ras, or a mutation in the switch I region that was identified as a contact site between Rab3A and Rab GEF had little effect on RhoA or Cdc42Hs with regard to the ability to interact with Lbc or Cdc24, suggesting that there exists a unique mechanism of regulation of the Rho family proteins by their GEFs. Analysis of a panel of chimeras made between RhoA and Cdc42Hs, which all maintained the ability to respond to Dbl, their mutual GEF, and to GTPase-activating protein, revealed that at least two distinct sites in each of the GTPases are required for activation by the respective GEFs. Further site-directed mutagenesis studies showed that the conserved residue Tyr32 in the putative effector region of both GTPases (numbered by Cdc42Hs) is critical for binding of the GEFs and that specific recognition for Lbc or Cdc24 is achieved at least in part through residues Lys27 of Rho and Gln116 of Cdc42. Moreover, the loss of GEF responsiveness of a RhoA mutation (D76Q) was found to be caused by the impaired GEF catalysis, not by a change in the GEF binding affinity. Together, these results indicate that multiple sites of the Rho GTPases are involved in the regulation by GEFs, contributing to GEF binding or GEF catalysis, and raise the possibility that activation of each Rho family G-protein by a specific GEF may engage in a distinct mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2038833293,"We evaluated the roles of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling cascades in Gα12-induced G1 to S phase cell cycle progression in NIH3T3(M17) fibroblasts. Transient expression of a constitutively active mutant of Gα12, Gα12(R203C), resulted in a 2-fold increase in the number of bromodeoxyuridine-positive S phase cells over vector control level under serum-deprived conditions. Consistent with the ability of Gα12(R203C) to induce G1/S transition, its expression led to a 2-fold increase in cyclin A promoter activity, which showed a marked synergism with a low concentration of serum, resulting in up to a 15-fold elevation over the basal level. In addition, Gα12(R203C) caused a 2-fold stimulation in E2F-mediated transactivation. Wild type Gα12 showed similar stimulatory effects on cyclin A promoter activity and E2F-mediated transactivation, although of lesser magnitude. We observed a modest but constitutive activation of MAPK in cells transfected with Gα12(R203C), which was abolished by a dominant negative form of Ras. Gα12(R203C) also induced a 3-fold increase in JNK activity, which was abolished by dominant negative forms of either Rac1 or Ras. The expression of dominant negative forms of Ras, MAPK, Rac1, or JNK inhibited Gα12(R203C)-induced increases in bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells. Also, the dominant negative forms of Ras, MAPK, and JNK strongly inhibited Gα12(R203C)-induced stimulation of cyclin A promoter activity. These results demonstrate that both the Ras/MAPK and Ras/Rac1/JNK pathways convey necessary, if not sufficient, mitogenic signals induced by Gα12 activation. We evaluated the roles of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling cascades in Gα12-induced G1 to S phase cell cycle progression in NIH3T3(M17) fibroblasts. Transient expression of a constitutively active mutant of Gα12, Gα12(R203C), resulted in a 2-fold increase in the number of bromodeoxyuridine-positive S phase cells over vector control level under serum-deprived conditions. Consistent with the ability of Gα12(R203C) to induce G1/S transition, its expression led to a 2-fold increase in cyclin A promoter activity, which showed a marked synergism with a low concentration of serum, resulting in up to a 15-fold elevation over the basal level. In addition, Gα12(R203C) caused a 2-fold stimulation in E2F-mediated transactivation. Wild type Gα12 showed similar stimulatory effects on cyclin A promoter activity and E2F-mediated transactivation, although of lesser magnitude. We observed a modest but constitutive activation of MAPK in cells transfected with Gα12(R203C), which was abolished by a dominant negative form of Ras. Gα12(R203C) also induced a 3-fold increase in JNK activity, which was abolished by dominant negative forms of either Rac1 or Ras. The expression of dominant negative forms of Ras, MAPK, Rac1, or JNK inhibited Gα12(R203C)-induced increases in bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells. Also, the dominant negative forms of Ras, MAPK, and JNK strongly inhibited Gα12(R203C)-induced stimulation of cyclin A promoter activity. These results demonstrate that both the Ras/MAPK and Ras/Rac1/JNK pathways convey necessary, if not sufficient, mitogenic signals induced by Gα12 activation. Heterotrimeric G proteins are critical components in transmembrane signaling via heptahelical receptors and regulate the activities of a variety of effector enzymes and ion channels. Heterotrimeric G proteins are composed of three polypeptides, an α subunit, a β subunit, and a γ subunit, the latter two of which form a dimer (1Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Google Scholar). The Gα subunits are a family of over 20 different proteins that share 45-95% amino acid identity. They have been divided into four classes: Gsα, Giα, Gqα, and Gα12 (1Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Google Scholar). The Gα12 class includes Gα12 and Gα13 (2Strathmann M.P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5582-5586Google Scholar, 3Chan A.M.-L. Fleming T.P. McGovern E.S. Chedid M. Miki T. Aaronson S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 762-768Google Scholar) and is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and cells (4Spicher K. Kalkbrenner F. Zobel A. Harhammer R. Nürnberg B. Soling A. Schultz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 906-914Google Scholar). In contrast to Gs, Gi, and Gq class members for which functional roles have been well established (1Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Google Scholar), the biological activity of the Gα12 class is not fully clarified. However, accumulating evidence suggests that Gα12 is involved in cell growth and transformation (5Offerman S. Schultz G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 71-74Google Scholar). First, mutationally activated Gα12, Gα12(Q229L), stimulated cell proliferation and induced neoplastic transformation in NIH3T3 cells (3Chan A.M.-L. Fleming T.P. McGovern E.S. Chedid M. Miki T. Aaronson S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 762-768Google Scholar, 6Xu N. Bradley L. Ambdukar I. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6741-6745Google Scholar, 7Jiang H. Wu D. Simon M.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 319-322Google Scholar) and Rat-1 cells (8Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2559-2565Google Scholar). Second, expression cloning of a transforming gene from a human sarcoma cDNA library resulted in isolation of wild type human Gα12, suggesting that overexpression of wild type Gα12 was sufficient to cause neoplastic transformation in the presence of serum growth factors (3Chan A.M.-L. Fleming T.P. McGovern E.S. Chedid M. Miki T. Aaronson S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 762-768Google Scholar). Third, DNA synthesis stimulated by thrombin and serum, but not basic fibroblast growth factor, was abrogated by microinjection of anti-Gα12 antibody in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells (9Aragay A.M. Collins L.R. Post G.R. Watson A.J. Feramisco J.R. Brown J.H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20073-20077Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which activated Gα12 promotes cell growth and causes transformation have not yet been clearly understood. The expression of Gα12(Q229L) was shown to increase the activity of Na+/H+ exchanger in COS-1 cells (10Dhanasekaran N. Prasad M.V.V.S.V. Wadsworth S.J. Dermott J.M. van Rossum G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11802-11806Google Scholar). It was demonstrated for Rat-1 cells stably expressing Gα12(Q229L) that the basal activity of MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseJNKJun N-terminal kinasepRbretinoblastoma proteinDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPCRpolymerase chain reactionBrdUrdbromodeoxyuridinebpbase pair(s)MEKmitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) under serum-starved conditions was not elevated, but MAPK activation induced by epidermal growth factor or serum was potentiated, as compared with cells transfected with an empty vector (8Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2559-2565Google Scholar). Very recently, constitutive activation of JNK (stress-activated protein kinase), a new member of the MAPK family, has been demonstrated in Gα12(Q229L)-transformed NIH3T3 cells (11Prasad M.V.V.S.V. Dermott J.M. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Dhanasekaran N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18655-18659Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether activation of either of these signaling pathways contributes to Gα12-elicited cell growth or transformation. mitogen-activated protein kinase Jun N-terminal kinase retinoblastoma protein Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium polymerase chain reaction bromodeoxyuridine base pair(s) mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. Recent progress in the understanding of mammalian cell cycle regulation has elucidated the principal molecular mechanism of G1 to S phase progression (12Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 551-555Google Scholar, 13Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Google Scholar). A number of studies demonstrate that the E2F family transcription factors play pivotal roles for entry into the S phase (14Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Google Scholar). It was reported that microinjection of E2F1 expression plasmid into quiescent REF-52 fibroblasts is sufficient to induce DNA synthesis (15Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Google Scholar). In G0 and early G1 phases, E2F is complexed with pRb, the product of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene, and the pRb-related proteins, p107 and p130. The E2F complex found during G0 and early G1 phases is inactive as a transcription activator for E2F target genes (12Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 551-555Google Scholar–14Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Google Scholar) or may have transcriptional repressor function (16Lam E.W. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Google Scholar). In middle to late G1 phase, activation of cyclin-dependent kinases occurs in a temporally ordered manner, and pRb and the pRb-related proteins become progressively phosphorylated by activated cyclin-dependent kinases, resulting in inactivation of their growth-suppressive function (12Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 551-555Google Scholar, 13Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Google Scholar). Consequently, E2F is liberated and transactivates a number of the late G1/S phase genes, including cyclin E, cyclin A, B-myb, cdc2, ribonucleotide reductase, thymidylate synthase, DNA polymerase α, and E2F1 itself, through consensus E2F binding sites in their promoter regions (14Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Google Scholar, 17DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Google Scholar). Cyclin A thus induced at the G1/S border forms complexes with its catalytic partner Cdk2. Accumulated evidence indicates that the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex mediates initiation and progression of the S phase (12Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 551-555Google Scholar, 13Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that MAPK is necessary for growth factor-stimulated G1/S progression (18Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Google Scholar). However, it is poorly understood how MAPK activation leads to activation of the critical events in late G1, i.e. E2F activation and induction of the E2F target genes that are necessary for G1 to S progression. Information about how JNK is involved in G1 to S progression is even more scanty. In the present study, we observed that the expression of the Gα12 mutant, Gα12(R203C), caused activation of both MAPK and JNK and stimulation of S phase entry in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. The mutation corresponding to Gα12(R203C) in Gsα, Giα2, and Gqα renders them constitutively active and oncogenic (19Freissmuth M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21907-21914Google Scholar, 20Landis C.A. Masters S.B. Spada A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Vallar L. Nature. 1989; 340: 692-696Google Scholar, 21Wong Y.H. Federman A. Pace A.M. Zachary I.

We evaluated the role of the MAPK and the JNK signaling cascades in Gα12(R203C)-induced G1 to S phase progression. We further explored the involvement of the Ras and Rho subfamilies of low molecular weight G proteins in Gα12(R203C)-induced activation of MAPK and JNK and tried to elucidate whether E2F-mediated transactivation and cyclin A gene expression, two major events occurring at the G1/S boundary, are downstream targets of these signaling molecules. The present results demonstrate that the expression of Gα12(R203C) leads to constitutive activation of MAPK and JNK in a small G protein-dependent manner and that both Ras/MAPK and Ras/Rac1/JNK pathways are indispensable for Gα12(R203C)-evoked activation of G1/S gene expression and S phase entry. A 219-bp fragment (679-891 when the A residue of the initiation codon ATG is numbered as 1) of rat Gα12 was obtained from the cDNAs reverse-transcribed from rat liver poly(A)+ RNA by PCR amplification using two sets of degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the two six-amino acid sequences (182DVGGQR and 290FLNKQD in Gsα) conserved between the Gsα and Giα class members that were designed by Strathmann et al. (24Strathmann M. Wilke T.M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7407-7409Google Scholar). The sense primer was GTCTAGAGA(C/T)GTC(A/C/G/T)GG(A/C/G/T)GG(A/G)(A/C)G, and the antisense primer was GGAATTC(A/G)TC(C/T)TT(C/T)TT(A/G)TT(A/C/G/T)AG(A/G)AA. The conditions for the PCR were 1 min at 94°C, 1.5 min at 37°C, and 2 min at 72°C. A full-length Gα12 cDNA was isolated form a rat brain λZAPII cDNA library (Stratagene) by hybridization screening using the 219-bp PCR fragment as a probe under high stringency condition (at 42°C in the presence of 50% formamide and 0.9 M NaCl). The nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNA insert was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method with Sequenase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). The nucleotide sequence of rat Gα12 has been deposited in the GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank with accession number D85760. A constitutively active mutant of Gα12, Gα12(R203C), was created with a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Muta-Gene M13, Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutagenic primer was CATCCTGTTGGCATGCAAGGACACCAAG. The created mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. It was previously demonstrated for Gsα, Giα2, and Gqα that substitution of the corresponding arginine with cysteine makes the Gα proteins constitutively active (19Freissmuth M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21907-21914Google Scholar, 20Landis C.A. Masters S.B. Spada A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Vallar L. Nature. 1989; 340: 692-696Google Scholar, 21Wong Y.H. Federman A. Pace A.M. Zachary I.

Wild type Gα12 and Gα12(R203C) were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pMT2 expression vector (a generous gift from Dr. Kaufman at Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA). NIH3T3(M17) (a gift from Dr. G. M. Cooper at Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) is a subclone of NIH3T3 fibroblasts in which the expression of the dominant negative mutant of Ras, Ras(N17), is induced by dexamethasone treatment (25Cai H. Szeberenyi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5314-5323Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% iron-enriched calf serum (25Cai H. Szeberenyi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5314-5323Google Scholar) and 200 μg/ml Geneticin at 37°C in subconfluent states. pSV-βgal, the expression plasmid for β-galactosidase, was purchased from Promega. pactEF-MAPK and pactEF-MAPK-DN, the expression vectors of Xenopus MAPK and its dominant negative form with Asp170 to Ala substitution, respectively, were kindly provided by Dr. Okazaki (26Okazaki K. Sagata N. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1149-1157Google Scholar) (Kurume University Institute of Life Science, Kurume, Japan). The expression vector for a Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL)-tagged MAPK (pME18S-Myc MAPK) was created by a PCR-based method (27Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 187-189Google Scholar). The cDNAs of human JNK1 with a Myc epitope tag at its N terminus and human Rac1 were obtained from a human WI-38 fibroblast cDNA library by PCR amplification. The cDNA of dominant negative JNK1 (JNK-DN) with Thr183 to Ala and Tyr185 to Phe substitutions (28Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Google Scholar) was generated by a PCR-based method (27Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 187-189Google Scholar). The cDNAs of Myc epitope-tagged MAPK and dominant negative Rac1 (Rac1(N17)) were also prepared by a PCR-based method (27Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 187-189Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs obtained by the PCR method were confirmed by sequencing with an ALFred DNA sequencer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The cDNAs were subcloned into the EcoRI site or the BstX1 site of a mammalian expression vector, pME18S (generously provided by Dr. Maruyama at the Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). A luciferase reporter vector, E2F-Luc, was created as described previously by Slansky et al. (29Slansky J.E. Li Y. Kaelin W.G. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1610-1618Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide 5′-CTAGCAGCTGCTGCGATTTCGCGCCAAACTTGACG-3′, which contains a −20 to +9 from the dihydrofolate reductase promoter plus a PvuII site for screening and XhoI and NheI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, was inserted into the vector pGL3basic (Promega). A 2.5-kilobase pair BglII fragment of the cyclin A genomic DNA was isolated from a human leukocyte genomic library (Clontech). A luciferase reporter vector, CycA-Luc, was constructed by ligating the blunted 1.3-kilobase pair HindIII-SmaI fragment of cyclin A genomic DNA (30Henglein B. Chenivesse X. Wang J. Eick D. Brechot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5490-5494Google Scholar) to pGL2 basic vector (Promega) at the SmaI site. The bacterial expression plasmid of truncated c-Jun (amino acids 5-89) fused to glutathione S-transferase, pGEX-2T-c-Jun-(5-89), was kindly provided by Dr. A. Kraft (University of Alabama School of Medicine, Birmingham, AL). The plasmids were purified by two cycles of CsCl2 density gradient centrifugation and introduced into cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure. The day after transfection, the cells were serum-deprived by incubating in DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 24 h. To induce Ras(N17), dexamethasone (5 × 10−7M) was added into media at least 8 h prior to each experiment (25Cai H. Szeberenyi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5314-5323Google Scholar). Two or three days after transfection, as indicated in the figure legends, the cells were washed twice with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 2 × SDS sample buffer. Gel-loaded sample volumes were adjusted on the basis of protein concentration (5Offerman S. Schultz G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 71-74Google Scholar) determined on parallel dishes so that an equal amount of total cellular protein was loaded onto gels per well. Proteins were separated on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore Corp.). Western blot analysis was performed by probing with anti-Gα12 antibody (Santa Cruz) or a mouse monoclonal anti-Myc epitope antibody (9E10), which recognized the N-terminal amino acid sequence (EQKLISEEDL) of c-Myc, and respective alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Zymed). NIH3T3 cells, seeded at 1 × 105 cells/35-mm dish, were co-transfected with pSV-βgal and various expression plasmids at a total of 3 μg of DNA/dish as indicated in the figure legends. The cells were serum-deprived in the presence or absence of dexamethasone. Then 10 mM of BrdUrd (Boehringer Mannheim) was added and further incubated for 17 h in the presence or absence of dexamethasone. The cells were washed with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, and permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100. Cells were first incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-β-galactosidase antibody (Cappel) and then with a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cappel). After fixation in 3.7% formalin and treatment in 1.5 N HCl (31Baldin V. Lukas J. Marcote M.J. Pagano M. Draetta G. Gene. & Dev. 1993; 7: 812-821Google Scholar), BrdUrd was probed sequentially with a mouse monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody (Sigma) and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (Zymed). Each incubation was performed according to the manufacturers' recommendations. More than 200 β-galactosidase-positive (transfected) cells were examined, and BrdUrd-positive cells were counted under a fluorescent microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). NIH3T3(M17) cells (seeded at 5 × 104/well in 12-well plates) were co-transfected with expression plasmids and either CycA-Luc or E2F-Luc (a total of 2 μg of DNA/well), serum-deprived for 24 h, and then incubated in DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin with or without calf serum (0.5%) and dexamethasone for 17 h. Cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activity was measured with a Lumat LB95001 luminometer (Berthold) using the luciferase assay system (Promega). Protein concentrations of the same samples were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, and luciferase activity was normalized for protein content. NIH3T3(M17) cells in 35-mm dishes were co-transfected with pME18S-Myc-MAPK and either pMT2-Gα12(R203C) or pMT2 empty vector (a total of 3 μg of DNA/dish). After incubation for 24 h in DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of dexamethasone (5 × 10−7M), the cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1% NP-40. Myc-tagged MAPK was immunoprecipitated by using 9E10 anti-Myc epitope antibody. MAPK activity associated with the immune complex was assayed in vitro at 30°C for 10 min using myelin basic protein (Sigma) as a substrate as described (32Lubinus M. Meier K.E. Smith E.A. Gause K.C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9822-9825Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by adding 4 × SDS sample buffer, and samples were analyzed on SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. The radioactivity in the band corresponding to myelin basic protein was determined with a Fuji BAS 2000 Bio-Image Analyzer (Fuji Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). NIH3T3(M17) cells in 35-mm dishes were co-transfected with pME18S-Myc-JNK and indicated expression plasmids (a total of 3 μg/dish). The cells were deprived of serum for 24 h and then an immune complex JNK assay was performed as described by Derijard et al. (33Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, cells were lysed in an ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM EDTA, 3 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). A soluble fraction was obtained by centrifugation and precleared with protein A-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia). The supernatant was incubated with 9E10 antibody and subsequently with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Zymed)-bound protein A-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the lysis buffer and twice with a kinase assay buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 20 mM MgCl2, 20 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM Na3VO4). The pelleted beads were incubated with 30 μl of the kinase assay buffer containing 3 μg of GST-c-Jun-(5-89), 20 μM ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30°C for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of 4 × Laemmli's SDS-sample buffer and boiled. The samples were analyzed by SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the radioactivity in the band corresponding to GST-c-Jun-(5-89) was measured. A 2.1-kilobase pair cDNA clone containing the entire coding region of rat Gα12 was isolated. Sequence analysis of this clone revealed that the predicted amino acid sequence was identical to that of mouse Gα12 except for one residue (341), where serine in mouse Gα12 is changed to glycine in rat Gα12. NIH3T3(M17) cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids carrying either wild type Gα12 or the constitutively active mutant Gα12(R203C). The expression of either form was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-Gα12 antibody (Fig. 1), which detected expression of 45-kDa proteins corresponding to Gα12 and Gα12(R203C) proteins. A trace level of endogenous Gα12 was detected in empty vector-transfected control cells. Previous studies demonstrated that expression of Gα12(Q229L), another constitutively active mutant with deficient GTPase activity, resulted in an increased thymidine incorporation into DNA (8Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2559-2565Google Scholar). To evaluate whether Gα12(R203C) has a similar stimulatory effect on cell cycle progression, cells were transfected with pMT2-Gα12(R203C), pMT2-Gα12, or pMT2 empty vector together with a β-galactosidase expression plasmid, and BrdUrd incorporation into nuclei in a β-galactosidase-positive cell population was determined (Fig. 2). Under serum-deprived conditions, the expression of Gα12(R203C) resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in BrdUrd-positive cells over the vector control level. The stimulatory effect of Gα12(R203C) on S phase progression was also evident in the presence of a low concentration of serum (0.5%). The expression of wild type Gα12 tended to increase BrdUrd-positive cells in the presence and absence of serum but without statistical significance. Recent investigations have elucidated that G1 to S phase progression requires activation of E2F family transcription factors, a process dependent on cyclin-dependent kinase-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of pRb family proteins (12Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 551-555Google Scholar–14Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Google Scholar). It is also known that S phase entry is associated with transcriptional activation of the cyclin A gene (12Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 551-555Google Scholar, 13Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Google Scholar). To investigate whether or not activation of Gα12 elicits these events, we performed a series of co-transfection experiments using luciferase-reporter plasmids. As shown in Fig. 3 (left), under serum-deprived conditions, transfection of Gα12(R203C) resulted in a 2-fold increase in transactivation of a luciferase gene that is under the control of a consensus E2F binding site in the 5′-upstream region. It was of note that transfection of wild type Gα12 also resulted in stimulation of E2F activity, although to a smaller extent. In the presence of a low concentration of serum, the basal luciferase activity was slightly stimulated as compared with serum-deprived cells. Under this condition, wild type Gα12 and Gα12(R203C) also caused stimulation of luciferase activity over the vector control level. Shown in Fig. 3 (right) is Gα12-induced stimulation of cyclin A promoter activity. Transfection of Gα12(R203C) resulted in a weak but significant increase in luciferase activity in the absence of serum stimulation, which was potentiated by a low concentration of serum in a synergistic manner. Again, the wild type Gα12 showed stimulatory effects, although to a lesser extent. These results demonstrate that Gα12(R203)-induced G1/S transition is associated with stimulation of E2F activity and up-regulation of cyclin A gene transcription. We evaluated whether Gα12(R203C) activates MAPK in a transient co-transfection assay with a Myc epitope-tagged MAPK (Fig. 4). In cells transfected with Gα12(R203C), MAPK activity showed a 1.5-fold increase over the vector control in the absence of external growth factors. This increase was statistically significant (p < 0.01) and reproducible. By taking advantage of inducible expression of the dominant negative mutant of Ras(N17) by dexamethasone treatment, we examined whether Gα12(R203C)-induced activation of MAPK is dependent on Ras. When Ras(N17) was induced, MAPK activity in Gα12(R203C)-transfected cells was not significantly different from the vector control level. Western blot analysis using anti-Myc epitope antibody revealed that the expression level of a Myc epitope-tagged MAPK was not changed by co-expression of Ras(N17) and/or Gα12(R203C). The results demonstrate that Gα12(R203C) induces stimulation of MAPK in a Ras-dependent manner. Very recently Prasad et al. (11Prasad M.V.V.S.V. Dermott J.M. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Dhanasekaran N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18655-18659Google Scholar) have reported that Gα12(Q229L) activates JNK. We examined whether Gα12(R203C) activated JNK and, if so, whether Gα12(R203C)-induced JNK activation was dependent on the small G proteins, Ras and Rac. As shown in Fig. 5A, co-transfection of Gα12(R203C) and a Myc epitope-tagged JNK resulted in an approximately 2.5-fold increase in JNK activity over the vector control level. Gα12(R203C)-induced activation of JNK was completely abolished when Ras(N17) was expressed. In addition, Gα12(R203C)-induced JNK activation was entirely dependent on Rac1, as demonstrated by the inhibition of JNK activation by the dominant negative Rac1(N17). Western blot analysis using anti-Myc epitope antibody revealed that the expression level of a Myc epitope-tagged JNK was not changed by co-expression of either Rac1(N17) or Ras(N17) (Fig. 5B). We investigated whether Ras, MAPK, and JNK are involved in G1/S cell cycle progression evoked by Gα12. To this end, we studied the effects of expression of dominant negative forms of these signaling molecules on Gα12(R203C)-induced activation of cyclin A promoter and BrdUrd incorporation into DNA. As shown in Fig. 6A, stimulation of cyclin A promoter activity by activated Gα12 was completely abolished by induced expression of Ras(N17), both in the presence and absence of a low concentration of serum. The dominant negative MAPK also strongly inhibited the stimulatory effect of Gα12(R203C) down to the serum-starved vector control level (Fig. 6B). Similarly, co-expression of the dominant negative JNK potently"

Major unresolved questions in this pathway are the identity and role of the internal calcium stores in light excitation and the mechanism underlying regulation of Ca2+ release from internal stores. Treatment of Drosophila photoreceptors with ryanodine and caffeine disrupted the current induced by light, whereas subsequent application of calcium-calmodulin (Ca-CaM) rescued the inactivated photoresponse. In calcium-deprived wild-type Drosophila and in calmodulin-deficient transgenic flies, the current induced by light was disrupted by a specific inhibitor of Ca-CaM. Furthermore, inhibition of Ca-CaM revealed light-induced release of calcium from intracellular stores. It appears that functional ryanodine-sensitive stores are essential for the photoresponse. Moreover, calcium release from these stores appears to be a component of Drosophila phototransduction, and Ca-CaM regulates this process."
https://openalex.org/W2082591672,"Acetone cyanohydrin lyase from <i>Linum usitatissimum</i> is a hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL) which is involved in the catabolism of cyanogenic glycosides in young seedlings of flax. We have isolated a full-length cDNA clone encoding <i>L. usitatissimum</i> HNL (LuHNL) from a cDNA expression library by immunoscreening. LuHNL cDNA was expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and isolated from the respective soluble fraction in an active form which was biochemically indistinguishable from the natural enzyme. An open reading frame of 1266 base pairs encodes for a protein of 45,780 kDa. The derived amino acid sequence shows no overall homologies to the to date cloned HNLs, but has significant similarities to members of the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) family of enzymes. In particular, the cysteine and histidine residues responsible for coordination of an active site Zn<sup>2+</sup> and a second structurally important Zn<sup>2+</sup> in alcohol dehydrogenases are conserved. Nevertheless, we found neither alcohol dehydrogenase activity in LuHNL nor HNL activity in ADH. Moreover, well known inhibitors of ADHs, which interfere with the coordination of the active site Zn<sup>2+</sup>, fail to affect HNL activity of LuHNL, suggesting principally different mechanisms of cyanohydrin cleavage and alcohol oxidation. Interestingly, LuHNL like ADH and <i>Prunus serotina</i> (PsHNL) possesses an ADP-binding βαβ unit motif, pointing to the possibility that the non-flavoprotein PsHNL and the flavoprotein LuHNL have developed from two independent lines of evolution of a common ancestor with an ADP-binding βαβ unit."

It was the second flavoprotein to be uncovered, and probably it is the most studied member of this superfamily. In addition to the classical protein from mammalian kidney, recently related DAAOs have been described from various yeasts (1Kubicek-Pranz E.M. Röhr M. Can. J. Microbiol. 1985; 31: 625-628Google Scholar, 2Pilone Simonetta M. Vanoni M.A. Casalin P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 914: 136-142Google Scholar). A common feature of all these enzymes is the dehydrogenation of D-amino acids to yield α-imino and, upon subsequent hydrolysis, α-ketoacids. The terminal redox acceptor is dioxygen. In spite of the innumerable studies, the molecular mechanism by which this enzyme brings about substrate dehydrogenation is far from being solved. Mechanistic proposals revolve around possible modes by which the substrate αC-H bond is being broken in the step critical for catalysis.The most prominent proposal is the carbanion mechanism, which is characterized by initial abstraction of the α-H as H+ leading to an intermediate in which the α-carbon carries a negative charge. Evidence in its favor has been discussed in various review articles (3Bright H.J. Porter D.J.T. Enzymes. 1975; 12: 421-505Google Scholar, 4Curti B. Ronchi S. Pilone Simonetta M. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 69-94Google Scholar). So called “hydride mechanisms” in which a H− is expulsed from αC-H also have been discussed at various occasions but have not been proposed explicitly until most recently by Mattevi et al. (5Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Google Scholar). From Miura and Miyake (6Miura R. Miyake Y. Bioorg. Chem. 1988; 16: 97-110Google Scholar) stems a proposal in which “the lone-pair electrons of the neutral amino group of the substrate are transferred to the flavin in a concerted manner with the abstraction of the α-proton.” (For schematic representations of the mechanisms and structures see Denu and Fitzpatrick (7Denu J.M. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4001-4007Google Scholar).)An approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms of enzymes consists in the correlation of reactivities (reaction rates) with the properties of substrate substituents which influence the steric or electronic properties of the latter. This approach was advocated originally by Hammett (8Hammett L.P. Physical Organic Chemistry. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1940: 184-228Google Scholar) for chemical systems and was extended by Hansch and Leo (9Hansch C. Leo A. Substituent Constants For Correlation Analysis in Chemistry and Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1979Google Scholar). Klinman and co-workers (10Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2018-2026Google Scholar, 11Miller S.M. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2114-2127Google Scholar) have pioneered its use in the study of enzymatic reactions. Recently Walker and Edmondson (12Walker M.C. Edmondson D.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7088-7098Google Scholar) have used it to study monoamine oxidase. As early as in 1966 Neims et al. (13Neims A.H. DeLuca D.C. Hellerman L. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 203-212Google Scholar) have employed substituted phenylglycines for probing the mechanism of pkDAAO; however, the results were contradictory. In retrospect the reason for this is clear: these authors did rely on the correlations of Vmax data hoping to probe the reductive half-reaction. With pkDAAO the rate-limiting step in turnover is, in general, product release (14Massey V. Gibson Q.H. Fed. Proc. Am. Chem. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1964; 23: 18-29Google Scholar). Later, Porter et al. (15Porter D.J.T. Voet J.G. Bright H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4464-4473Google Scholar) using a series of substituted phenylalanines have correlated the rate of the reversal of the dehydrogenation step of pkDAAO with the Hammett σn coefficient. They interpret their positive ρ (the numerical coefficient of σ) as compatible with a carbanion mechanism. Effects of the substituents on the rate of enzyme reduction, on ΔG0 and, by reflection of the latter on ΔG‡, did not get addressed.It has been pointed out elsewhere (16Ghisla S. Massey V. Williams C.H. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Elsevier, North-Holland, New York1982: 133-142Google Scholar–18Lederer F. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 153-242Google Scholar) that the dehydrogenation of amino acids by DAAOs should be mechanistically related to that of α-OH acids as catalyzed, e.g. by lactate monooxygenase or flavocytochrome b2, to name only the two most prominent members of this family. This assumption has been substantiated nicely by Mattevi et al. (5Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Google Scholar), who have shown that the active sites of pkDAAO and flavocytochrome b2 are mirror images resulting probably from convergent evolution. If these assumptions are correct, then the mechanistic arguments from the two subfamilies should be usable reciprocally. A major argument against a simple carbanion mechanism is, as discussed earlier (16Ghisla S. Massey V. Williams C.H. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Elsevier, North-Holland, New York1982: 133-142Google Scholar), the finding of incorporation of the substrate α-H into the 5-deazaflavin position C(5) both in the case of pkDAAO and of α-OH acid oxidases (16Ghisla S. Massey V. Williams C.H. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Elsevier, North-Holland, New York1982: 133-142Google Scholar, 19Hersh L.B. Jorns M.S. J. Biol.

If a carbanion mechanism was to be operative, this would require additional steps or intermediates, since the H+ originating from the αC-H cannot be transferred to the flavin N(5) or C(5) concomitantly with its abstraction, unless the flavin position N(5) (or C(5) in 5-deazaflavin) would be the “abstracting base” itself, a most unlikely alternative. From this, the importance of the question about the concertedness of the reaction, as stated and studied e.g. by Denu and Fitzpatrick (7Denu J.M. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4001-4007Google Scholar), becomes apparent.During our recent studies on the catalytic mechanism of the two yeast DAAOs from Rhodotorula gracilis and Trigonopsis variabilis (21Pollegioni L. Langkau B. Tischer W. Ghisla S. Pilone M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13850-13857Google Scholar) using aliphatic D-amino acids, major differences compared with pkDAAO have emerged. Importantly, the yeast enzymes are more tolerant of variations in the chain of the amino acid; they have, overall, much higher turnover rates and have a different rate-limiting step, e.g. with alanine as substrate it is the reductive half-reaction, compared with product release in the case of pkDAAO (14Massey V. Gibson Q.H. Fed. Proc. Am. Chem. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1964; 23: 18-29Google Scholar). In view of this we have attempted to apply the concepts of linear free energy relationships (LFER) using p-substituted phenylglycines to probe the mechanistic questions mentioned above. The rationale behind the choice of phenylglycine is that the electronic and inductive effects of substituents on the aromatic ring should be more substantial compared with those in substituted phenylalanines as studied by Porter et al. (15Porter D.J.T. Voet J.G. Bright H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4464-4473Google Scholar). We have worked out the detailed kinetic mechanism for phenylglycines since we consider this to be an indispensable basis for linear free energy interpretations. Concomitantly, we have studied the primary deuterium isotope effect (on αC-H) and the solvent deuterium isotope effect on the dehydrogenation step of phenylglycine in order to establish whether, with TvDAAO, it occurs in a concerted fashion or via intermediates. The results are interpreted in view of the recently solved three-dimensional structure of pkDAAO, the coordinates of which were made available to us prior to publication by Mattevi et al. (5Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Google Scholar).

The rationale behind the choice of phenylglycine is that the electronic and inductive effects of substituents on the aromatic ring should be more substantial compared with those in substituted phenylalanines as studied by Porter et al. (15Porter D.J.T. Voet J.G. Bright H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4464-4473Google Scholar). We have worked out the detailed kinetic mechanism for phenylglycines since we consider this to be an indispensable basis for linear free energy interpretations. Concomitantly, we have studied the primary deuterium isotope effect (on αC-H) and the solvent deuterium isotope effect on the dehydrogenation step of phenylglycine in order to establish whether, with TvDAAO, it occurs in a concerted fashion or via intermediates. The results are interpreted in view of the recently solved three-dimensional structure of pkDAAO, the coordinates of which were made available to us prior to publication by Mattevi et al. (5Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Google Scholar).

It was the second flavoprotein to be uncovered, and probably it is the most studied member of this superfamily. In addition to the classical protein from mammalian kidney, recently related DAAOs have been described from various yeasts (1Kubicek-Pranz E.M. Röhr M. Can. J. Microbiol. 1985; 31: 625-628Google Scholar, 2Pilone Simonetta M. Vanoni M.A. Casalin P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 914: 136-142Google Scholar). A common feature of all these enzymes is the dehydrogenation of D-amino acids to yield α-imino and, upon subsequent hydrolysis, α-ketoacids. The terminal redox acceptor is dioxygen. In spite of the innumerable studies, the molecular mechanism by which this enzyme brings about substrate dehydrogenation is far from being solved. Mechanistic proposals revolve around possible modes by which the substrate αC-H bond is being broken in the step critical for catalysis. D-Amino acid oxidase amino acid imino acid D-amino acid oxidase from the yeast Trigonopsis variabilis D-amino acid oxidase from pig kidney DAAO oxidized form DAAO reduced form reduced DAAO imino acid complex Michaelis complex between the oxidized DAAO and substrate linear free energy relationship. The most prominent proposal is the carbanion mechanism, which is characterized by initial abstraction of the α-H as H+ leading to an intermediate in which the α-carbon carries a negative charge. Evidence in its favor has been discussed in various review articles (3Bright H.J. Porter D.J.T. Enzymes. 1975; 12: 421-505Google Scholar, 4Curti B. Ronchi S. Pilone Simonetta M. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 69-94Google Scholar). So called “hydride mechanisms” in which a H− is expulsed from αC-H also have been discussed at various occasions but have not been proposed explicitly until most recently by Mattevi et al. (5Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Google Scholar). From Miura and Miyake (6Miura R. Miyake Y. Bioorg. Chem. 1988; 16: 97-110Google Scholar) stems a proposal in which “the lone-pair electrons of the neutral amino group of the substrate are transferred to the flavin in a concerted manner with the abstraction of the α-proton.” (For schematic representations of the mechanisms and structures see Denu and Fitzpatrick (7Denu J.M. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4001-4007Google Scholar).) An approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms of enzymes consists in the correlation of reactivities (reaction rates) with the properties of substrate substituents which influence the steric or electronic properties of the latter. This approach was advocated originally by Hammett (8Hammett L.P. Physical Organic Chemistry. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1940: 184-228Google Scholar) for chemical systems and was extended by Hansch and Leo (9Hansch C. Leo A. Substituent Constants For Correlation Analysis in Chemistry and Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1979Google Scholar). Klinman and co-workers (10Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2018-2026Google Scholar, 11Miller S.M. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2114-2127Google Scholar) have pioneered its use in the study of enzymatic reactions. Recently Walker and Edmondson (12Walker M.C. Edmondson D.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7088-7098Google Scholar) have used it to study monoamine oxidase. As early as in 1966 Neims et al. (13Neims A.H. DeLuca D.C. Hellerman L. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 203-212Google Scholar) have employed substituted phenylglycines for probing the mechanism of pkDAAO; however, the results were contradictory. In retrospect the reason for this is clear: these authors did rely on the correlations of Vmax data hoping to probe the reductive half-reaction. With pkDAAO the rate-limiting step in turnover is, in general, product release (14Massey V. Gibson Q.H. Fed. Proc. Am. Chem. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1964; 23: 18-29Google Scholar). Later, Porter et al. (15Porter D.J.T. Voet J.G. Bright H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4464-4473Google Scholar) using a series of substituted phenylalanines have correlated the rate of the reversal of the dehydrogenation step of pkDAAO with the Hammett σn coefficient. They interpret their positive ρ (the numerical coefficient of σ) as compatible with a carbanion mechanism. Effects of the substituents on the rate of enzyme reduction, on ΔG0 and, by reflection of the latter on ΔG‡, did not get addressed. It has been pointed out elsewhere (16Ghisla S. Massey V. Williams C.H. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Elsevier, North-Holland, New York1982: 133-142Google Scholar–18Lederer F. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 153-242Google Scholar) that the dehydrogenation of amino acids by DAAOs should be mechanistically related to that of α-OH acids as catalyzed, e.g. by lactate monooxygenase or flavocytochrome b2, to name only the two most prominent members of this family. This assumption has been substantiated nicely by Mattevi et al. (5Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Google Scholar), who have shown that the active sites of pkDAAO and flavocytochrome b2 are mirror images resulting probably from convergent evolution. If these assumptions are correct, then the mechanistic arguments from the two subfamilies should be usable reciprocally. A major argument against a simple carbanion mechanism is, as discussed earlier (16Ghisla S. Massey V. Williams C.H. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Elsevier, North-Holland, New York1982: 133-142Google Scholar), the finding of incorporation of the substrate α-H into the 5-deazaflavin position C(5) both in the case of pkDAAO and of α-OH acid oxidases (16Ghisla S. Massey V. Williams C.H. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Elsevier, North-Holland, New York1982: 133-142Google Scholar, 19Hersh L.B. Jorns M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8728-8734Google Scholar, 20Averill B.A. Schonbrunn A. Abeles R.H. Weinstock L.T. Cheng C.C. Fisher J. Spencer R. Walsh C. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1603-1605Google Scholar). If a carbanion mechanism was to be operative, this would require additional steps or intermediates, since the H+ originating from the αC-H cannot be transferred to the flavin N(5) or C(5) concomitantly with its abstraction, unless the flavin position N(5) (or C(5) in 5-deazaflavin) would be the “abstracting base” itself, a most unlikely alternative. From this, the importance of the question about the concertedness of the reaction, as stated and studied e.g. by Denu and Fitzpatrick (7Denu J.M. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4001-4007Google Scholar), becomes apparent. During our recent studies on the catalytic mechanism of the two yeast DAAOs from Rhodotorula gracilis and Trigonopsis variabilis (21Pollegioni L. Langkau B. Tischer W. Ghisla S. Pilone M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13850-13857Google Scholar) using aliphatic D-amino acids, major differences compared with pkDAAO have emerged. Importantly, the yeast enzymes are more tolerant of variations in the chain of the amino acid; they have, overall, much higher turnover rates and have a different rate-limiting step, e.g. with alanine as substrate it is the reductive half-reaction, compared with product release in the case of pkDAAO (14Massey V. Gibson Q.H. Fed. Proc. Am. Chem. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1964; 23: 18-29Google Scholar). In view of this we have attempted to apply the concepts of linear free energy relationships (LFER) using p-substituted phenylglycines to probe the mechanistic questions mentioned above. The rationale behind the choice of phenylglycine is that the electronic and inductive effects of substituents on the aromatic ring should be more substantial compared with those in substituted phenylalanines as studied by Porter et al.

The initial rates of the enzymatic reactions were determined as μmole NADPH oxidized from the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm recorded as linear slopes for 3 min. Control runs were carried out under the same conditions as mentioned above using distilled water instead of the enzyme solutions. Data were expressed as means of at least three experiments. Kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax, for the reduction of the cholesterol hydroperoxides by GSTs or Se-GSH Px were obtained by double-reciprocal plots at substrate concentrations of 5-100 μM versus apparent reaction rates. Data were expressed as means of at least three experiments. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 250-270 g (at 7 weeks), were used for preparation of liver, kidney, and skin cytosolic fractions after an overnight fast. The animals were anesthetized with ether and sacrificed. Their isolated livers were perfused with cold isotonic KCl through the portal vein. The kidney and the perfused liver were cut into pieces and rinsed with cold isotonic KCl before homogenization. The skin was removed from the back of each rat after the area was shaved. The skin was then chilled and washed in cold isotonic KCl to remove blood. The skin sample was then scraped with a scalpel blade to remove dermal fat and muscle and cut into small pieces with scissors. The resultant pieces of tissue were prehomogenized in 150 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mM EDTA, 193 mM KCl, 0.25 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 6.25 mM dithiothreitol with a Polytron tissue homogenizer (Kinematica, Switzerland) and filtered through two layers of surgical gauze. The skin prehomogenate, liver and kidney isolated from the animals were homogenized in the same buffer with a Teflon-pestled Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. Tissue cytosolic fractions were obtained by centrifugation of postmitochondrial fractions of 33% (w/v) homogenates at 105,000 × g for 60 min. The cytosolic fractions were dialyzed against 50 volumes. 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 1 mM EDTA and 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. GSTs Ya-Ya, Ya-Yc, Yc-Yc, Yb1-Yb1, Yb1-Yb2, Yb2-Yb2 (25Mannervik B. Jensson H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9909-9912Google Scholar), and Yrs-Yrs (22Hiratsuka A. Sebata N. Kawashima K. Okuda H. Ogura K.

Nyström L. Österlund E. Tahir M.K. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 609-615Google Scholar) from rat kidney cytosol as reported previously. Rat skin GSTs were purified from skin cytosol (3,666 mg of protein) by the same methods as used for purification of GSTs from liver and kidney (see legends for Fig. 4 and Table III in the text).Table IIISummary of purification of GSTs from rat skin cytosolPurification stepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldmgμmol/minμmol/mg protein/min%Cytosol3,6661830.05100S-Hexyl-GSH8.116820.792ChromatofocusingFraction I (Yc-Yc)1.430.521.817Fraction II (Yb1-Yb1)1.023.623.613Fraction III1.933.517.618S-Hexyl-GSHFraction IIIa (Yp-Yp)1.215.012.58Fraction IIIb (Yb1-Yb2)0.57.615.24Fraction IV (Yb2-Yb2)2.329.312.716 Open table in a new tab Hepatic Se-GSH Px was purified as reported previously (27Yoshimura S. Komatsu N. Watanabe K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 621: 130-137Google Scholar) from a pooled fraction passing through an S-hexyl-GSH affinity column to which dialyzed rat liver cytosol (4,778 mg of protein) was directly applied to obtain GSTs. Purification of cutaneous Se-GSH Px was performed by modifications of the previously reported methods (27Yoshimura S. Komatsu N. Watanabe K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 621: 130-137Google Scholar, 28Yoshida M. Iwami K. Yasumoto K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1982; 46: 41-46Google Scholar). The pooled fraction which had passed through (3,325 mg of protein) an S-hexyl-GSH affinity column (2.0 × 7 cm) used for obtaining skin GSTs was mixed with glycerol and EDTA to make final concentrations of 10% (v/v) and 1 mM, respectively, and the mixture was brought to 40% saturation with ammonium sulfate. The precipitate formed was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant solution was brought to 60% saturation with ammonium sulfate. Precipitate collected by centrifugation was dissolved in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1 mM EDTA and 0.7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer A) and then dialyzed overnight against 5,000 ml of buffer A. The dialyzed solution (1,144 mg of protein/15 ml) was applied to a Sephadex G-200 column (2.6 × 84 cm) equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with the same buffer. The column effluent was collected into 7-ml fractions. The chromatographic fractions active toward hydrogen peroxide were pooled and concentrated to 7 ml (542 mg of protein) against Aquacide II and dialyzed against 5,000 ml of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 1 mM EDTA (buffer B) for 18 h, and then applied to a CM-Sephadex C-50 column (1.7 × 21 cm) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was eluted successively with buffer B (100 ml), a linear gradient of 0-0.4 M NaCl in buffer B (250 ml), and the same buffer (200 ml) containing 1 M NaCl. The column effluent was collected into 5-ml fractions. The chromatographic fractions active toward hydrogen peroxide were pooled and concentrated to 5 ml (108 mg of protein) against Aquacide II and dialyzed against 5,000 ml of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mM EDTA (buffer C) for 18 h and applied to an activated thiol-Sepharose 4B column (0.9 × 5 cm) which was pre-equilibrated with buffer C, containing 0.1 M NaCl. The enzyme adsorbed was eluted from the column with 0.3 mM cysteine in buffer C after the column was washed with buffer C (30 ml) containing 0.1 M NaCl. The column effluent was collected into 2-ml fractions. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed by the method of Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or with silver nitrate. Separation, identification, and isolation of GST subunits were carried out on a μBondasphere C18-300 Å column (5 μm particle size, 3.9 × 300 mm, Nihon Waters Ltd., Tokyo) with an Atto model Constametric-II liquid chromatograph as reported previously (30Ostlund Farrants A.-K. Meyer D.J. Coles B. Southan C. Aitken A. Johnson P.J. Ketterer B. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 423-428Google Scholar). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with a 22-55% (v/v) linear gradient of acetonitrile in water, both containing 0.1%(v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Chromatograms were monitored by absorbance at 220 nm. GSTs (10-20 μg of protein) purified by chromatofocusing were used as samples. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was carried out with an Applied Biosystems model 470A gas phase sequence analyzer (Foster, CA) and a Spectra Physics SP8700XR phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (San Jose, CA). Polyclonal antibodies to rat GSTs Ya-Ya, Yb1-Yb1, Yp-Yp and Yrs-Yrs were prepared as reported previously (22Hiratsuka A. Sebata N. Kawashima K. Okuda H. Ogura K. Watabe T. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Tsuchida S. Ishikawa T. Sato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11973-11981Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed by the method of Towbin et al. (31Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. A dialyzed cytosolic fraction from rat liver had a GSH Px activity of 1.9 nmol/mg of protein/min toward cholesterol 7α-hydroperoxide. Fifty-three percent of the GSH Px activity passed through an S-hexyl-GSH-Sepharose 6B affinity column to which the cytosolic fraction was directly applied, and the remainder was retained on and eluted from the affinity column with S-hexyl-GSH (Fig. 1). The retained fraction contained 92% of the cytosolic activity toward CDNB. All the GSH Px activity toward hydrogen peroxide passed through the affinity column. Both GSH Px activities toward cholesterol 7α-hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide in the passing-through fraction were inseparable and concentrated into a single protein throughout the purification steps most frequently used for hepatic Se-GSH Px. The purified enzyme protein showed a molecular mass of 80 kDa on a Sephadex G-200 gel filtration column and a subunit mass of 22 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The sequence of the first 28 N-terminal amino acids of the tetrameric protein was completely identical with that of known rat liver Se-GSH Px (33Reddy A.P. Hsu B.L. Reddy P.S. Li N-Q. Thyagaraju K. Reddy C.C. Tam M.F. Tu C-P.D. Nucleic Acid Res. 1988; 16: 5557-5568Google Scholar). No other protein with GSH Px activity toward cholesterol 7α-hydroperoxide was found in the passing-through fraction from the S-hexyl-GSH affinity column. The GSH Px activity toward cholesterol 7α-hydroperoxide, which was retained on the S-hexyl-GSH affinity column and eluted with S-hexyl-GSH, was separated by chromatofocusing into peaks I and II, both of which showed GSH-conjugating activities toward CDNB (Fig. 2). The GSTs of peaks I and II were identified as Ya-Ya and Ya-Yc, respectively, by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses and by co-reverse phase partition HPLC on μBondasphere C18-300Å with the corresponding authentic specimens purified from rat liver cytosol in our laboratory as reported previously (22Hiratsuka A. Sebata N. Kawashima K. Okuda H. Ogura K. Watabe T. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Tsuchida S. Ishikawa T. Sato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11973-11981Google Scholar). The GSTs appeared as a single band at 25 kDa for Ya-Ya and as two bands at 25 and 28 kDa for Ya-Yc on SDS-PAGE and Western blot using anti-Ya-antiserum (Fig. 3). The chromatographic profiles of the GSTs identified as Ya-Ya and Ya-Yc were very similar to those reported previously (22Hiratsuka A. Sebata N. Kawashima K. Okuda H. Ogura K. Watabe T. Satoh K.

Western blot analysis was performed using rabbit anti-Ya-antiserum.

Cholesterol 7β-hydroperoxide was a 2.5-fold better substrate for GST Ya-Ya than the 7α-isomer. A kinetic study indicated that there existed a much smaller difference in GSH Px activity toward the cholesterol 7-hydroperoxides between Se-GSH Px and GST Ya-Ya because of their much smaller Km values for Se-GSH Px than for the GST (Table II).Table I.GSH Px activities of rat Se-GSH Px and GSTs toward cholesterol hydroperoxides and other organic and inorganic hydroperoxidesSubstrate (concentration)Se-GSH PxGSTsAlphaMuPi, Yp-YpTheta, Yrs-YrsYa-YaYa-YcYc-YcYb1-Yb1Yb1-Yb2Yb2-Yb2μmol/mg protein/minμmol/mg protein/minμmol/mg protein/minμmol/mg protein/minCholesterol7α-hydroperoxide (0.1 mM)0.180.750.5NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.7β-hydroperoxide (0.1 mM)0.101.800.83NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.5α-hydroperoxide (0.1 mM)0.070.700.3NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.Linoleic acid13-hydroperoxide (0.1 mM)4082.01.51.60.10.10.11.44.6Linolenic acid13-hydroperoxide (0.1 mM)4022.71.91.50.20.20.21.69.7Arachidonic acid15-hydroperoxide (0.1 mM)5111.61.41.20.10.10.11.313.6Cumene hydroperoxide (1.5 mM)4721.42.53.30.10.30.50.012.0Hydrogen peroxide (0.25 mM)445NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.CDNB (1 mM)NDbLess than 100 nmol/mg of protein/min.33.024.417.739.231.413.614.1NDbLess than 100 nmol/mg of protein/min.DCNB (1 mM)NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.0.140.10.17.43.90.560.08NDaLess than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.SMCR (0.025 mM)NDcLess than 0.05 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDcLess than 0.05 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDcLess than 0.05 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDcLess than 0.05 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDcLess than 0.05 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDcLess than 0.05 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDcLess than 0.05 nmol/mg of protein/min.NDcLess than 0.05 nmol/mg of protein/min.0.2a Less than 10 nmol/mg of protein/min.b Less than 100 nmol/mg of protein/min.c Less than 0.05 nmol/mg of protein/min.

Open table in a new tab Four other hepatic GSTs active toward CDNB were isolated as homogeneous proteins by chromatofocusing (Fig. 2) and identified by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and reverse phase partition HPLC analyses with authentic specimens of GSTs Yc-Yc (Alpha), Yb1-Yb1 (Mu), Yb1-Yb2 (Mu), and Yb2-Yb2 (Mu) for peaks III, IV, V, and VI, respectively (data not shown). However, as readily predicted from the result of chromatofocusing, these purified Alpha- and Mu-class GSTs had no GSH Px activity toward cholesterol hydroperoxides, but showed activity toward fatty acid hydroperoxides and cumene hydroperoxide (Table I). Despite its highest activity toward the fatty acid hydroperoxides among the hepatic GSTs, Theta-class GST Yrs-Yrs isolated from the passing-through fraction from the S-hexyl-GSH affinity column had no activity toward the cholesterol 7-hydroperoxides. The Pi-class GST Yp-Yp isolated from rat kidney cytosol also had no activity toward the steroid hydroperoxides. A dialyzed rat skin cytosolic fraction had a very weak GSH Px activity of 0.05 nmol/mg of protein/min, 1/38 of the hepatic activity, toward cholesterol 7α-hydroperoxide. All the GSH Px activity passed through the S-hexyl-GSH affinity column together with the GSH Px activity toward hydrogen peroxide (0.12 μmol/mg of protein/min) on direct application of the cytosol to the affinity column. However, 92% of the total skin cytosolic GST activity toward CDNB (183 μmol/min) was retained on and eluted with S-hexyl-GSH from the S-hexyl-GSH affinity column. The dermal GST activity eluted from the affinity column was separated into four major peaks, I-IV, and a minor peak eluted at pH 8.3 by chromatofocusing (Fig. 4). SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses indicated peak III to be a mixture of a Mu- and a Pi-class GSTs. This mixture was separated into two single peaks, IIIa and IIIb, with activity toward CDNB on the S-hexyl-GSH affinity column from which they were eluted stepwise with 0.05 and 5 mM S-hexyl-GSH, respectively.

A series of mutant proteins with distinctive structural parameters such as redox potential, microenvironment of the iron-sulfur cluster, electrostatic properties, and conformational stability was used to provide more detailed insight into the contribution of the electronic and conformational states of adrenodoxin to the driving forces of the complex formation of reduced adrenodoxin with cytochromes P450scc and P45011β and electron transfer. The apparent rate constants of P450scc reduction were generally proportional to the adrenodoxin redox potential under conditions in which the protein-protein interactions were not affected. However, the effect of redox potential differences was shown to be masked by structural and electrostatic effects. In contrast, no correlation of the reduction rates of P45011β with the redox potential of adrenodoxin mutants was found.

The key step of different biological reactions such as oxidative phosphorylation, photosynthesis, respiration, drug metabolism, and many other processes taking place in living organisms is an electron transfer. Electron transfer reactions commonly occur between protein-bound prosthetic groups of the electron donors and acceptors by protein-protein interaction (1Beratan D.N. Onuchic J.N. Winkler J.R. Gray H.B. Science. 1992; 258: 1740-1741Google Scholar). However, only a little is known about the geometry of the protein-protein complex required for successful electron transfer and about the rate-limiting processes. Bovine adrenodoxin is of particular interest because of its specific role as an electron carrier associated with steroid hydroxylation reactions. Adrenodoxin is a member of the ferredoxin family of electron-transferring non-heme iron proteins. It is a low molecular mass protein (14 kDa), negatively charged at neutral pH values and containing the [2Fe-2S] cluster as redox-active group. Adrenodoxin mediates the transfer of electrons from NADPH via adrenodoxin reductase to the heme iron of mitochondrial cytochromes P450, which are localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane of bovine adrenal cortex, involved in the side chain cleavage of cholesterol (CYP11A1), 1The abbreviations used are: CYP11A1cytochrome P45011A1 (P450scc)CYP11B1cytochrome P45011B1 (P45011β)HPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. the 11β-hydroxylation of 11-deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol, and the production of aldosterone (CYP11B1). The flavin prosthetic group of adrenodoxin reductase accepts two electrons from NADPH and contributes one electron to adrenodoxin. Reduced adrenodoxin in turn transfers an electron to either ferric or oxygen-bound P450 species. Both side chain cleavage and 11β-hydroxylation utilize molecular oxygen and require two electrons per oxidation (six electrons in total for side chain cleavage) (2Lambeth J.D. Seybert D.W. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4667-4672Google Scholar).

Based on chemical modification studies a charge-pair interaction mechanism has been proposed between adrenodoxin and its redox partners (3Geren L.M. O'Brien P. Stonehuerner J. Millett F. J. Biol.

Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8932-8935Google Scholar) and CYP11A1 (7Wada A. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22877-22882Google Scholar) confirmed the role of electrostatic interactions for the functioning of adrenodoxin as electron transport protein. The acidic region of adrenodoxin between residues 72 and 79 was shown as being crucial for binding to adrenodoxin reductase and cytochrome CYP11A1, implying common or overlapping binding site(s) on adrenodoxin and its redox partners. Nevertheless, detailed studies on the single tyrosine 82 residue of adrenodoxin (8Beckert V. Dettmer R. Bernhardt R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2568-2573Google Scholar) revealed that Tyr-82 seems to play an essential role in the interaction with CYP11A1 and CYP11B1, but not with adrenodoxin reductase. Furthermore, the data clearly demonstrated the different requirements of CYP11A1 and CYP11B1 for recognition of adrenodoxin, which may be important for allowing the proteins to discriminate between the oxidized and reduced forms of adrenodoxin to produce effective electron transfer complexes (12Lambeth J.D. Front. Biotransformation. 1990; 3: 58-100Google Scholar). These observations were supported by site-directed mutagenesis studies of histidine 56 (9Beckert V. Schrauber H. Bernhardt R. Van Dijk A.A. Kakoschke C. Wray V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 226-235Google Scholar) and threonine 54 (10Uhlmann H. Bernhardt R. J. Biol.

Despite much information provided from structural and kinetic studies of the components of steroid hydroxylase system, there is no definite model of electron transport from NADPH to the natural acceptor, cytochrome P450. At present the “shuttle” model (4Lambeth J.D. Geren L.M. Millett F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10025-10029Google Scholar, 13Hanukoglu I. Jefcoate C.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1979; 254: 11806-11815Google Scholar), and a model suggesting the occurrence of two adrenodoxin molecules in the electron transport chain (15Hara T. Takeshima M. Lechner M. Cytochrome P450. Biochemistry, Biophysics and Molecular Biology. John Libbey Eurotext, Paris1994: 417-420Google Scholar) are under discussion. Unfortunately, the tertiary structures of adrenodoxin and its redox partners, adrenodoxin reductase, CYP11A1, and CYP11B1, which could give some structural information for understanding the mechanism of electron transfer at molecular level, have not been solved yet. In general, for redox partners that associate prior to electron transfer, the driving force of the reaction depends on both the reduction potentials of the free species and any differences in the association free energies for the one-electron reduced complex (16Beinert H. Thompson A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 15: 333-361Google Scholar). Theoretical dependence of electron transfer rate on redox potential has been shown to be valid in many model systems (17Marcus R.A. Sutin N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 265-322Google Scholar). However, electron transfer reactions of cytochrome P450 are very complicated and could meet very different driving forces in different reaction steps (18Bernhardt R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 127: 137-221Google Scholar). Another point that should be emphasized is that most experimental data on electron transfer in steroid hydroxylase system were obtained for CYP11A1. The general conclusions derived from these experiments are not necessarily true for CYP11B1 if the different physicochemical, immunochemical, and catalytic characteristics of cytochromes CYP11A1 and CYP11B1 are considered. To provide more detailed insight into the contribution of electronic and conformational states to the driving forces for the one-electron reduced complex formation we performed studies with special attention to the exclusive role of adrenodoxin. For this purpose a series of adrenodoxin mutants possessing distinctive structural characteristics (i.e. redox potential, microenvironment of the iron-sulfur chromophore, electrostatic parameters, conformational stability) was used as electron transfer mediators. The wild type adrenodoxin and the site-directed mutants were generated as originally described by Beckert et al. (8Beckert V. Dettmer R. Bernhardt R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2568-2573Google Scholar, 9Beckert V. Schrauber H. Bernhardt R. Van Dijk A.A. Kakoschke C. Wray V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 226-235Google Scholar). Expression in Escherichia coli and purification of recombinant proteins were carried out as reported previously (8Beckert V. Dettmer R. Bernhardt R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2568-2573Google Scholar). The absorbance ratios A414/A276 for wild type, His-56, and Asp-76 mutant adrenodoxin preparations were higher than 0.9. Absorbance ratios of A414/A276 for the Tyr-82 mutants were higher than 1.0 because of the absence of tyrosine 82. The concentrations of adrenodoxin proteins were determined using ϵ414 = 9.8 (mM·;cm)−1 (19Kimura T. Jorgensen C.K. Neilands J.B. Nyholm R.S. Reinen D. Williams R.J.P. Structure and Bonding. 5. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1968: 1-40Google Scholar). Adrenodoxin reductase and cytochromes CYP11A1 and CYP11B1 were purified according to the procedure of Akhrem et al. (20Akhrem A.A. Lapko V.N. Lapko A.G. Shkumatov V.M. Chashchin V.L. Acta Biol. Med. Ger. 1979; 38: 257-274Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The concentration of adrenodoxin reductase was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 11.3 (mM·;cm)−1 at 450 nm (21Hiwatashi A. Ichikawa Y. Maruya N. Yamano T. Aki K. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3082-3090Google Scholar). The concentrations of cytochromes P450 were estimated according to Omura and Sato (22Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Google Scholar). EPR and CD spectra were recorded as described previously (8Beckert V. Dettmer R. Bernhardt R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2568-2573Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission spectra of protein solutions were taken with an RF-5001 PC spectrofluorometer by exciting at 270 nm. Measurements were carried out in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at room temperature. Protein concentrations used were in the range 0.03-0.2 mg/ml, where all geometric effects may be eliminated (9Beckert V. Schrauber H. Bernhardt R. Van Dijk A.A. Kakoschke C. Wray V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 226-235Google Scholar, 23Lim T.B. Kimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2440-2444Google Scholar). Redox potentials of the wild type adrenodoxin and the mutants were measured by the dye photoreduction method with safranin T as indicator and mediator according to Sligar and Gunsalus (24Sligar S.G. Gunsalus I.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1078-1082Google Scholar). Potentials were quantitated in a 3-ml reaction mixture containing 10 mM EDTA, 0.3 M glucose, 2.5 μM safranin T, and 100 μl of an oxygen-scavenging system (4 mg/ml glucose oxidase and 2 mg/ml catalase) in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, using the procedure described by Beckert et al. (8Beckert V. Dettmer R. Bernhardt R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2568-2573Google Scholar). All data were analyzed according to the Nernst equation. The assays involving the measurements of the kinetics of interaction between adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase using cytochrome c as an electron acceptor were carried out in the cytochrome c reduction mixture (1 ml) containing 0.2 μM adrenodoxin reductase, 100 μM horse heart cytochrome c, and adrenodoxin or adrenodoxin mutants (variable amounts) in 33 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The reaction was started by the addition of 120 μM NADPH. The reduction of cytochrome c was monitored at 550 nm, and the activity was calculated on the basis of an extinction coefficient of 20 (mM·;cm)−1 at 550 nm for cytochrome c. 11β-Hydroxylation activity measurements were performed as described previously (8Beckert V. Dettmer R. Bernhardt R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2568-2573Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (0.5 ml) consisted of CYP11B1 (0.4 μM), adrenodoxin reductase (0.4 μM), adrenodoxin or adrenodoxin mutants (variable amounts), deoxycorticosterone (100 μM), and the NADPH-regenerating system (64 μM glucose 6-phosphoric acid disodium salt and 2 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM dithioerythritol, 0.01% (w/v) Tween 80. The conversion of deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone was carried out at 37°C for 10 min after initiation of the reaction with NADPH. The reaction was stopped with dichloromethane, which simultaneously extracts the steroids. The extracted steroids were then dried under a nitrogen stream and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC with 70% methanol as a solvent at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Corticosterone and deoxycorticosterone were used as external standards. The cholesterol side chain cleavage activity of the adrenodoxin mutants was measured in the reconstituted assay system catalyzing the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone according to the procedure of Sugano et al. (25Sugano S. Morishima N. Ikeda N. Horie S. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 327-333Google Scholar) with modifications described by Beckert et al. (8Beckert V. Dettmer R. Bernhardt R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2568-2573Google Scholar). The incubation mixture contained, in a final volume of 1 ml, 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.3% (w/v) Tween 20, 100 μM cholesterol, 1 μM CYP11A1, 0.5 μM adrenodoxin reductase, adrenodoxin (variable amounts), and the NADPH-regenerating system. The reaction was started by adding 60 μM NADPH. After a 10-min incubation at 37°C, the reaction was stopped by heating to 98°C. For conversion of steroids into the 3-on-4-ene form, 50 μl of cholesterol oxidase (0.4 unit) in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% sodium cholate and 100 μM corticosterone as an internal standard was added to the reaction mixture. The internal standard was necessary because of the additional isomerase activity of cholesterol oxidase, which makes the exact determination of the transformed cholesterol amounts impossible, but not that of pregnenolone formation. After incubation at 37°C for 10 min, the steroids were extracted with dichloromethane. The samples were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC with a gradient solvent system of 70-100% methanol. Cholestenone, progesterone, corticosterone, and pregnenolone were used as standards. Titration was performed according to Kido and Kimura (14Kido T. Kimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11806-11815Google Scholar). Binding of oxidized adrenodoxin to the oxidized CYP11A1 was followed spectrophotometrically by a high spin shift of the P450 heme iron, caused by adrenodoxin-induced cholesterol binding, using 2.3 μM CYP11A1 in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.03% Tween 20 and 25 μM cholesterol at room temperature. Defined amounts of adrenodoxin were added from a stock solution. Calculation of concentrations of free adrenodoxin was done as described by Coghlan and Vickery (5Coghlan V.M. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18606-18612Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters were determined by least squares linear regression analysis of the Lineweaver-Burk plot. The standard deviations of the kinetic and binding constants were calculated from data of three or four separate experiments. An investigation of the first electron transfer reaction from adrenodoxin to cytochromes P450 was carried out using a single channel stopped flow ASVD spectrometer SX-17MV (Applied Photophysics) according to Lambeth and Kriensgiri (26Lambeth J.D. Kriensgiri S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8810-8816Google Scholar) with some modifications. The reduction assays were performed in two different manners. In a first set of experiments one test tube contained 0.5 μM adrenodoxin reductase, varying amounts of adrenodoxin, and 1 μM CYP11A1 in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.03% Tween 20 and 25 μM cholesterol, or with 0.01% Tween 80, 1 mM EDTA, and 25 μM deoxycorticosterone, respectively. The second test tube contained the reducing component, NADPH (1 mg/ml) in the respective reaction solution. The reaction mixtures were treated with carbon monoxide, and an oxygen scavenging system was added. Electron transfer reaction was followed by monitoring the absorbance of the ferrous-carbon monoxide-complex at 450 nm, an increase of which was shown to be a precise measurement of cytochrome P450 reduction by reduced adrenodoxin (27Tuckey R.C. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4232-4237Google Scholar). Electron transfer rate constants were obtained by a computerized exponential fit of the data. In the other case, the reduction assay was essentially similar to the above mentioned one, with the only exclusion that NADPH was first incubated with the adrenodoxin/adrenodoxin reductase mixture in the first test tube, and the oxidized cytochrome P450 (CYP11A1 or CYP11B1) complexed with the steroid was in the second test tube. The extent to which the reduction of adrenodoxin by adrenodoxin reductase proceeds after incubation with NADPH was checked spectrophotometrically using the method described by Kimura (19Kimura T. Jorgensen C.K. Neilands J.B. Nyholm R.S. Reinen D. Williams R.J.P. Structure and Bonding. 5. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1968: 1-40Google Scholar). The main concern of the present study was to relate the essential structure-function properties of adrenodoxin, which were modified by site-directed mutagenesis, to the specific aspects of electron transfer in steroid hydroxylase systems. The surface near to the [2Fe-2S] cluster of adrenodoxin is of considerable interest since here the flavoprotein must supply its electrons, and yet it is at this part of the adrenodoxin surface that the P450 cytochrome must interact. Tyr-82 mutants (i.e. Y82F, Y82S, Y82L) were chosen taking into consideration two points. On the one hand, mutations of tyrosine 82 were shown to affect differentially interactions of adrenodoxin with cytochromes CYP11A1 and CYP11B1 (8Beckert V. Dettmer R. Bernhardt R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2568-2573Google Scholar); and on the other hand, Tyr-82 seems to be located close to the conserved His-56 residue, which is immediately adjacent to one of the cysteine ligands of the [2Fe-2S] cluster (9Beckert V. Schrauber H. Bernhardt R. Van Dijk A.A. Kakoschke C. Wray V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 226-235Google Scholar). In addition, adrenodoxin proteins with amino acid substitutions in position 56 (i.e. H56T, H56Q, and H56R) were used for our studies, since His-56 has been shown to contribute to the integrity of the protein region between the iron-sulfur cluster and the highly conserved acidic region of adrenodoxin, which is important for binding to both adrenodoxin reductase and P450 (9Beckert V. Schrauber H. Bernhardt R. Van Dijk A.A. Kakoschke C. Wray V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 226-235Google Scholar). Moreover, His-56 seems to play a key role in the stabilization of adrenodoxin structure as became evident from recent calorimetric studies on folding and stability of adrenodoxin (28Burova T.V. Beckert V. Uhlmann H. Ristau O. Bernhardt R. Pfeil W. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1890-1897Google Scholar). Taking into account the role of complementary electrostatic interactions for the association of electron transfer proteins, mutant D76E of adrenodoxin with a substitution in the highly conserved acidic region was further selected. This conservative change maintained the negative charge in position 76 but altered the exact positioning of the carboxylate moiety potentially inducing disturbances of specific short range protein-protein interactions as was shown for a heterologous system consisting of human placenta ferredoxin, bovine adrenodoxin reductase, and CYP11A1 (6Coghlan V.M. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8932-8935Google Scholar). The wild type and the mutants were expressed in similar yields as holoprotein and exhibited absorption CD and EPR spectra characteristic for the correctly assembled iron-sulfur cluster, indicating that incorporation of the cluster was not disturbed upon amino acid replacements (data not shown). The redox potentials of the mutant proteins provide more detailed insight into the local environment of the iron-sulfur center in these proteins (29Holden H.M. Jacobson B.L. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Oh B.H. Skjeldal L. Chae Y.K. Cheng H. Xia B. Markley J.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 67-88Google Scholar). The effect of amino acid replacement near the cluster is sharply defined in the case of His-56 substitution. Replacement of His-56 by Gln, Arg, or Thr led to marked changes in the redox potentials of the mutants being 28, 65, and 66 mV, respectively, lower compared with that of the wild type (Table I). These changes demonstrate that histidine in position 56 affects the ligand field around the iron-sulfur cluster. Some lowering (8 mV) in the redox potential was estimated for mutant Y82S (−282 mV), indicating that introduction of the small polar serine residue instead of the hydrophobic tyrosine residue could produce conformational changes of the cluster environment since the microenvironment of the iron-sulfur chromophore of native adrenodoxin is known to be largely hydrophobic (30Mukai K. Kimura T. Helbert J. Kevan L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 295: 49-56Google Scholar). Redox potentials obtained for other Tyr-82 mutant proteins, in which tyrosine was changed to the hydrophobic phenylalanine or leucine (i.e. Y82F and Y82L), were found to be not significantly different from those of the wild type (−274 mV). The redox potential of the D76E mutant remains unchanged, confirming the previous suggestion that residues in this position are most likely not located in the immediate vicinity of the cluster (6Coghlan V.M. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8932-8935Google Scholar).Table I.Redox potentials of the adrenodoxin mutantsAdrenodoxinRedox potentialmVWTaWT, wild type.−274Y82F−274Y82S−282Y82L−274H56Q−302H56T−340H56R−339D76E−274a WT, wild type. Open table in a new tab Theoretical analysis of electron transport reactions, based on the outer sphere mechanism, predicts that a relationship should exist between the rate constant of the electron transfer and the redox potential difference between donor and acceptor (17Marcus R.A. Sutin N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 265-322Google Scholar). Indeed, a clear correlation was shown to exist between the rate constant for the reduction and the redox potential of the reactants in a structurally homologous series of electron transfer proteins (31Meyer T.E. Przysiecki C.T. Watkins J.A. Bhattacharyya A. Simondsen R.P. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6740-6744Google Scholar). The regulation of the CYP11A1 redox potential by substrates and the influence of these changes on the rate of the electron transfer from reduced adrenodoxin to cytochrome have been investigated by Lambeth and Kriensgiri (26Lambeth J.D. Kriensgiri S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8810-8816Google Scholar). Here we have investigated in more detail the relationship among structural properties of adrenodoxin mutants and the rates of cytochromes CYP11A1 and CYP11B1 reduction using the stopped flow technique. Electron transfer rate constants were obtained using increased concentrations of the wild type and the mutant adrenodoxin proteins. The assay for CYP11A1 reduction was performed in two different manners. In the first case, reduction of the heme iron was measured after the reaction was started with NADPH as reducing component. In this regime a certain time is needed for interaction of oxidized adrenodoxin with reduced adrenodoxin reductase and the electron transfer from adrenodoxin reductase to adrenodoxin followed by electron transfer from adrenodoxin to cytochrome. The kinetics of cytochrome reduction was first order at all ratios of adrenodoxin to cytochrome CYP11A1. Fig. 1A shows plots of apparent first order rate constants (kapp) versus the adrenodoxin concentration. In contrast to observations of Lambeth and Kriensgiri (26Lambeth J.D. Kriensgiri S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8810-8816Google Scholar), the data demonstrate a clear increase in the CYP11A1 reduction rates by increasing concentrations of adrenodoxin with an apparent saturation at a ratio of approximately 10:1 (adrenodoxin/cytochrome). Since adrenodoxin and cytochrome P450 associate in the electron transfer complex prior to electron exchange, intracomplex electron transfer seems to become the rate-limiting step at high concentrations of adrenodoxin. The lack of concentration dependence of the reduction rates observed previously (26Lambeth J.D. Kriensgiri S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8810-8816Google Scholar) could be due to the presence of dithionite as reducing component in the stopped flow assay. As evident from Fig. 1A, the mutant proteins Y82S, H56R, and D76E exhibited significantly lower kapp values than wild type adrenodoxin. All other mutants reduced CYP11A1 with essentially the same rate constant as does wild type adrenodoxin (Fig. 1A). The second set of experiments was performed to avoid a possible contribution of adrenodoxin reduction or oxidation by adrenodoxin reductase to the measured rate of electron transfer between adrenodoxin and CYP11A1. For this purpose, adrenodoxin was preincubated with adrenodoxin reductase and NADPH in the first test tube. The other test tube contained oxidized cytochrome CYP11A1. The molar ratios of proteins were identical to those for the preceding stopped flow assays. Analyses of the adrenodoxin absorption spectra after incubation with adrenodoxin reductase and NADPH in the oxygen-free solution indicated that at the start point of the stopped flow measurement, when the mixture containing adrenodoxin reductase, NADPH, and adrenodoxin or its mutants was mixed with oxidized cytochrome, the wild type adrenodoxin as well as the mutant proteins were fully reduced by adrenodoxin reductase (data not shown), thus being appropriately dissociated from the flavoprotein (32Lambeth J.D. Seybert D.W. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7255-7264Google Scholar). In this case the rate constants of electron transfer from the reduced adrenodoxin to the oxidized cytochrome must be totally adrenodoxin-dependent since the flavin- to iron-sulfur electron transfer is not rate-limiting under these conditions. As evident from Fig. 1B, the wild type adrenodoxin and the mutants, which have unchanged redox potentials (Table I) and no significantly changed affinity to adrenodoxin reductase and to CYP11A1 (Table II., Table III.) (i.e. Y82F, Y82L), revealed about the same values of the reduction rates as in the preceding stopped flow assay. This observation indicates that at least for these adrenodoxin proteins association and dissociation of the complexes of adrenodoxin with adrenodoxin reductase as well as a reduction of adrenodoxin occur more rapidly than the measured overall rate of electron transfer. In contrast, the reduction rates of CYP11A1 were accelerated nearly 2.3-fold using H56T or H56Q mutants. A comparison of data presented in Fig. 1, A and B, allows the conclusion that in the case of the reaction start by NADPH (Fig. 1A) the obtained values of electron transfer rates to CYP11A1 for these mutants reflect their less favorable electron acceptance from adrenodoxin reductase. This led us to suppose that for defined mutants the reduction of adrenodoxin by adrenodoxin reductase is influencing the overall electron transfer rate from adrenodoxin to cytochrome under certain conditions. Binding studies using optical difference spectroscopy revealed that oxidized H56Q exhibits the same affinity for oxidized CYP11A1, whereas H56T has a slight increase in Kd value (Table III). Since the association energies appear to be similar for the interaction of oxidized and reduced adrenodoxin with the oxidized CYP11A1·;substrate complex, a correlation of the rate constants for the reduction with the redox potential for these mutants becomes apparent (Fig. 2). As indicated above, the reduction potentials of the H56Q and H56T mutants are significantly lowered compared with that of the wild type (−274 mV), being −302 and −340 mV, respectively, thus making the electron donation to the heme iron of CYP11A1 more favorable. The rate constants for the adrenodoxin to CYP11A1 electron transfer are decreased significantly in the case of mutant proteins Y82S and D76E under reaction conditions of the second variant of stopped flow experiments (Fig. 1B). Since these mutations do not appreciably influence redox potential values of the adrenodoxin proteins, the observed decrease of the rate constants seems to reflect a strong influence of these mutations on complex formation with CYP11A1. Particular emphasis must be given to the behavior of mutant H56R. This protein possesses nearly the same redox potential as does H56T (−339 and −340 mV, respectively). However, the rate constants obtained for mutant H56R are considerably lower than those for mutant H56T. This can be due to the proximity of the voluminous positively charged arginine residue to the highly acidic binding region of adrenodoxin. Thus, H56R and H56T are excellent examples for the interplay of factors that are known from the theory to influence the rates of electron transfer reactions between proteins, i.e. the difference in redox potential between reactants and electrostatic effects of protein-protein interaction. It is evident from Fig. 2 that in a series of structurally homologous proteins, in which the interaction with CYP11A1 was not altered significantly upon single amino acid substitution (i.e. Y82F, Y82L, H56Q, H56T) the redox potential difference was the dominant factor in determining electron transfer rate. Approximately linear correlation (r = 0.86) between redox potentials and rate constants for reduction could be shown in this protein group. In contrast, for the mutant proteins Y82S, H56R, and D76E structural and electrostatic effects become much more important, masking the effect of redox potential differences on electron transfer rates.Table II.Relative kinetic parameters for mutants of adrenodoxinAdrenodoxinCytochrome c reduction assayCholesterol side chain cleavage11β-Hydroxylation activityrelative Kmrelative Kmrelative KmWTaWT, wild type.1.01.01.0Y82F0.70.70.2Y82S0.91.42.7Y82L1.01.20.4H56Q2.11.26.1H56T2.81.24.1H56R5.03.66.3D76E11.22.63.8a WT, wild type.

Open table in a new tab An investigation of the first electron transfer from adrenodoxin to cytochrome CYP11B1 catalyzing 11β hydroxylation of deoxycorticosterone was carried out taking into consideration stopped flow data obtained for CYP11A1. For these measurements adrenodoxin was incubated with NADPH and adrenodoxin reductase prior to mixing with the oxidized CYP11B1·;substrate complex. As for CYP11A1 reduction we obtained a clear dependence of the first-order rate constants of electron transfer on adrenodoxin concentration (Fig. 3). However, the kapp values were lowered nearly 2-fold using CYP11B1 at the same stoichiometry of the reaction components, coinciding with earlier suggestions about a less effective transfer of reducing equivalents to CYP11B1 compared with CYP11A1 (33Yamazaki T. McNamara B.C. Jefcoate C.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 95: 1-11Google Scholar). Additionally, as shown in Fig. 4, no correlation of the reduction rates of CYP11B1 on the redox potential of the adrenodoxin mutants was found. Moreover, the reduction rates of the D76E mutant are approximately the same compared with those of the wild type, whereas they are 5-fold lower in the reduction assay with CYP11A1. In addition, CYP11B1, although not sensitive to the replacement D76E, seems to be more sensitive than CYP11A1 to the properties of the amino acids substituting positions 56 and 82. Analyzing the data shown in Fig. 3 revealed that interaction between CYP11B1 and adrenodoxin is substantially of hydrophobic nature. The hydrophobic protein region between the iron-sulfur cluster and the acidic site on the surface of the adrenodoxin seems to play an important role for the precise complementarity of the tightly associated complex with CYP11B1.Fig. 4Plot of the natural logarithm of the apparent rate constants for the CYP11B1 reduction as a function of the redox potential of adrenodoxin mutants. The rate constants were obtained at the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures” at a [CYP11B1]:[adrenodoxin] ratio of 1:2. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Successively, we have examined comparatively how the kinetics of the first electron transfer is related to catalytic and binding properties of the adrenodoxin mutants in cytochrome c reduction and CYP11A1- or CYP11B1-dependent substrate conversion. These studies have demonstrated that amino acid substitutions that alter the electrostatic properties of adrenodoxin (i.e. Y82S, H56R, D76E) decreased the activity and affinity of these mutants for both adrenodoxin reductase and CYP11A1 as evidenced by raised Km and Kd values (Table II., Table III.). As expected, the effect of imbalance of the electrostatic interactions is most pronounced for mutant D76E, exhibiting a more than 10-fold decrease in the affinity to adrenodoxin reductase as measured by a respective increase in the Km value of the cytochrome c reduction (Table II) Moreover, although adrenodoxin mutant D76E exhibits a 10-fold increase in the Kd value for CYP11A1 as evident from the spectral binding studies (Table III), the Km value for this mutant in the CYP11A1 substrate conversion assay reveals under our experimental conditions only a 2.6-fold increase compared with the wild type (Table II). Of particular interest is the similarity of the electrostatic effects caused by H56R and D76E replacements concerning adrenodoxin interaction with adrenodoxin reductase and CYP11A1. Replacement of His-56 with arginine residue results in ∼5-fold decreases in binding affinities for both adrenodoxin reductase and CYP11A1 (Table II., Table III.). Analysis of the enzymatic activity of adrenodoxin mutants with respect to CYP11B1-dependent substrate conversion suggests differences in the binding requirements of this protein compared with CYP11A1. Close examination of the Km values indicates that the adrenodoxin mutants with charged or polar residues in positions 56 and 82 (i.e. H56Q, H56R, and Y82S) show decreased affinities to the CYP11B1. Interestingly, increases of the Km values for mutants H56R, H56Q, and H56T are greater than that of mutant D76E (Table II). On the other hand, replacing Tyr-82 with the more hydrophobic resides leucine or phenylalanine increased the ability of these mutants to interact with CYP11B1 as evidenced in 2.5-5-fold lower Km values. However, the interpretation of the Km values obtained for CYP11A1 and CYP11B1 becomes more complicated since the turnover of these systems, being totally adrenodoxin-dependent, could become dependent on the interaction between adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase, at least for the mutants possessing affected affinity to adrenodoxin reductase. As was clearly demonstrated in our stopped flow investigations, such flavin- to iron-sulfur electron transfer limitation would mask the measured kinetic constants for cytochrome reduction. The Vmax values remain unchanged for all mutants in cytochrome c reduction and cholesterol or deoxycorticosterone conversion assays (data not shown), demonstrating that the efficiency of substrate conversion at infinite adrenodoxin concentrations is not influenced by amino acid substitution in positions 56, 82, or 76. Since the second electron transfer appears to be rate-determining for P450-dependent mixed function oxidations (13Hanukoglu I. Jefcoate C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3057-3061Google Scholar), it seems likely that the kinetic constants are primarily determined by second electron transfer. In conclusion, it has been shown that a linear correlation between the redox potential of various adrenodoxin mutants and the apparent rate constant of CYP11A1 reduction can be observed. The correlation does not hold true for mutants changing the electrostatics and/or structure of the interaction site (i.e. H56R, D76E). Such a correlation could also not be obtained for CYP11B1 reduction. Our data led us to conclude that for adrenodoxin/CYP11B1 interaction hydrophobic properties of the interaction site are more important. Interestingly, in some cases the rate of the first electron transfer does not reflect the rate of the efficiency of substrate conversion. This indicates that either the first and second electron transfers are differentially regulated (implying different requirements for the adrenodoxin·;P450 electron transfer complex) or that another step (e.g. product release) is rate-limiting in these systems.

https://openalex.org/W2030929691,"Hepatoma Hep3B cell lines stably expressing a temperature-sensitive p53 species (p53-Val-135) displayed a reduced response to interleukin-6 (IL-6) when cultured at the wild-type (wt) p53 temperature (Wang, L., Rayanade, R., Garcia, D., Patel, K., Pan, H., and Sehgal, P. B. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 23159-23165). We now report that in such cultures IL-6 caused a rapid (20-30 min) and marked loss of cellular immunostaining for STAT3 and STAT5, but not for STAT1. The loss of STAT3 and STAT5 immunostaining was transient (lasted 120 min) and tyrosine kinase-dependent, and even though the loss was blocked by the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin it was not accompanied by changes in cellular levels of STAT3 and STAT5 proteins suggesting that IL-6 triggered a rapid masking but not degradation of these transcription factors. STAT3 and STAT5 masking was accompanied by a reduction in IL-6-induced nuclear DNA-binding activity. The data suggest that p53 may influence Jak-STAT signaling through a novel indirect mechanism involving a wt p53-dependent gene product which upon cytokine addition is activated into a “STAT-masking factor” in a proteasome-dependent step. Hepatoma Hep3B cell lines stably expressing a temperature-sensitive p53 species (p53-Val-135) displayed a reduced response to interleukin-6 (IL-6) when cultured at the wild-type (wt) p53 temperature (Wang, L., Rayanade, R., Garcia, D., Patel, K., Pan, H., and Sehgal, P.

The cellular protein p53 has been implicated in the regulation of mammalian cell processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA repair either directly as a transcription factor which modulates expression of specific regulatory genes or indirectly as a transcription factor which up-regulates the expression of genes whose products, in turn, then regulate other cellular regulatory proteins (1Michalovitz D.

As an example of the latter, the inhibitory effect of p53 on the cell cycle is attributed to the ability of p53 to increase the transcriptional expression of p21, a cellular protein which inhibits cyclin kinases, thus inhibiting the function of cyclins, a class of regulatory proteins required for cell proliferation (5El-Deiry W.S.

The temperature dependence of the secretion of plasma proteins such as β-fibrinogen and α1-antichymotrypsin in response to IL-6 by these p53-Val-135-expressing Hep3B lines, but not by the pSVneo control cell lines or the p53-free parental Hep3B cells, suggested that wt p53 negatively influenced cytokine signaling (14Wang L. Rayanade R. Garcia D. Patel K. Pan H. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23159-23165Google Scholar). In as much as the transcriptional response to IL-6 of the β-fibrinogen and α1-antichymotrypsin genes is primarily through activation of STAT3 and STAT5 transcription factors through the Jak-STAT signaling pathway (15Darnell Jr., J.E.

For example, the cytokine-induced phosphorylation-dependent degradation of I-κBα through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is now well characterized (21Scherrer D.C. Brockman J.A. Chen Z. Maniatis T.

The data obtained in the present study suggest that p53 may influence Jak-STAT signaling through a novel indirect mechanism involving a wt p53-dependent gene product which upon IL-6 addition is rapidly activated into a STAT3 and STAT5 “masking” factor in a proteasome-dependent step. A series of 11 stably transfected cell lines constitutively expressing p53-Val-135 and seven control cell lines expressing pSVneo alone were derived from the p53-free human hepatoma Hep3B line as has been described earlier (14Wang L. Rayanade R. Garcia D. Patel K. Pan H. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23159-23165Google Scholar). Line 1 and Line 5 cells which express p53-Val-135 were used in the data shown in this communication. For immunofluorescence assays, cells were planted in wells of 8-chamber slides (Nunc; 2 × 104cells/chamber) in 0.3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium supplemented with 1 mML-glutamine, 2 mM sodium pyruvate, 1 × non-essential amino acids, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (all obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.). The cultures were incubated at 37°C for 18-24 h and then either continued at 37°C or shifted to 32.5°C for 18-24 h. All cultures were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) previously equilibrated to the respective temperatures and replenished with 0.3 ml of serum-free medium also previously equilibrated at the respective temperatures. Four hours after the switch to serum-free medium, the cells were treated with human IL-6 (Escherichia coli-derived, a gift from Sandoz) (30 ng/ml) for 30 min. At the end of the IL-6 treatment, the cultures were washed with ice-cold PBS, drained, and fixed with cold methanol/acetone (2:1) for 10 min, the fixative was drained, and the slides were allowed to air dry. Immunostaining using various monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies was carried out as per the instructions provided by the respective antibody suppliers using fluorescein-tagged goat anti-murine IgG or rhodamine-tagged goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel Organon Teknika). Cellular immunofluorescence was evaluated using a Bio-Rad MRC 1000 dual laser confocal microscopy system. Murine monoclonal antibodies to STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5a (marketed as anti-“STAT5”) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories, murine monoclonal antibody to STAT5b and rabbit polyclonal antibody to STAT3 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech, and anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies PAb240 and PAb421 were purchased from Oncogene Research Products/Calbiochem. The whole cell lysis buffer used and Western blot procedure were as per protocol provided by Transduction Laboratories using the ABC Elite Vectastain kit (Vector Laboratories). Aliquots containing equal total cellular protein amounts in the range of 30-40 μg (Bio-Rad Micro Assay, Bio-Rad) were loaded in each lane of particular Western blots. Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described earlier (29Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Google Scholar), and STAT-specific DNA-binding activity was assayed using a “GAS” (γ-interferon activated site) double-stranded DNA element from the interferon response factor-1 promoter (top strand 5′-gatcGATTTCCCCGAAATcgagatc-3′; lower case letters are linkers) which yields the typical pattern of A, B, and C complexes in gel-shift assays corresponding to STAT3 homodimer, STAT1/3 heterodimer, and STAT1 homodimer, respectively (29Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Google Scholar, 30Lin J.-X. Mietz J. Modi W.S. John S. Leonard W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10738-10744Google Scholar). The confocal immunofluorescence data in Fig. 1A confirm the temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype of the conformation of p53-Val-135 expressed in Line 5: mutant conformation at 37°C and wt conformation at 32.5°C. All 11 p53-Val-135-expressing Hep3B cell lines showed this ts phenotype with respect to p53 conformation. None of the seven pSVneo control lines nor the parental Hep3B cells showed immunostaining for p53. When cultures of Line 5 cells were first incubated at 37°C for 1 day, shifted to 32.5°C for 18-20 h, and then exposed to IL-6 for 30 min, there was a marked loss of STAT3 and STAT5 immunostaining but not that of STAT1 (Fig. 1B). Cultures kept throughout at 37°C did not display the loss of STAT3 and STAT5 immunostaining (Fig. 1B). All 11 of the p53-Val-135-expressing Hep3B cell lines displayed a loss of STAT3 and STAT5 immunostaining 30 min after IL-6 addition at 32.5°C, whereas none of the 7 pSVneo control lines nor the parental Hep3B cells displayed any loss of STAT3 or STAT5 immunostaining upon IL-6 addition at either 32.5 or 37°C (data not shown). The loss of STAT3 and STAT5 immunostaining as illustrated in Fig. 1B (i) was IL-6-induced and rapid in that a reduction in immunostaining was observed within 10 min and there was almost complete loss by 20-30 min after IL-6 addition, (ii) was transient in that STAT3 and STAT5 immunostaining returned 120-240 min after IL-6 addition, (iii) was dependent upon cytokine concentration in that, when assayed 30 min after IL-6 addition, the loss of immunostaining was elicited by IL-6 at 0.3 ng/ml, was near-maximal at 3-10 ng/ml, and was still evident at 100 ng/ml, (iv) was selective in that a loss of immunostaining was not observed for STAT1, STAT4, STAT6, RelA (p65), C/EBPα, β, γ, and Sp1 transcription factors, (v) was cytokine-specific in that interferon-γ elicited a modest reduction in STAT3 immunostaining but no loss of STAT5 or STAT1 immunostaining, and epidermal growth factor elicited no changes in immunostaining of any STAT transcription factors, (vi) required that the p53-Val-135-expressing Hep3B cells be incubated for at least 18-20 h at the wt p53 temperature (32.5°C) in that a 5- or 10-h incubation at 32.5°C was insufficient to elicit this phenotype, and (vii) was not dependent upon rapid de novo protein synthesis upon IL-6 addition in that the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide added 30 min prior to IL-6 did not inhibit the cytokine-induced loss of STAT3 or STAT5 immunostaining (data not shown). The loss of IL-6-triggered STAT3 immunostaining was observed using an anti-STAT3 monoclonal antibody or an anti-STAT3 polyclonal antibody each raised to different peptides from different regions of the STAT3 amino acid sequence (data not shown). Similarly, the loss of IL-6-triggered STAT5 immunostaining was observed using an anti-STAT5a monoclonal antibody (which cross-reacts with STAT5b in its native form) as well as using an anti-STAT5b monoclonal antibody (data not shown). In these Hep3B cell lines, significant nuclear immunostaining for STAT1 and STAT5, as in Fig. 1B, was observed even in the absence of IL-6 addition. IL-6 addition did not result in any clear cytoplasm to nuclear translocation of STAT1 or STAT5 immunostaining. In the case of STAT3, although cytoplasmic immunostaining predominated, some nuclear staining was always seen even in the absence of IL-6 addition. There was increased STAT3 nuclear staining upon IL-6 addition at 37°C (as in Fig. 1B). The dramatic loss of STAT3 and STAT5 immunostaining upon IL-6 addition to Line 5 cells at 32.5°C was dependent upon tyrosine kinase activity in that it was blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein and by staurosporine but not by the protein kinase C inhibitor H7 (Fig. 2) (15Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar, 16Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Google Scholar, 17Lai C.-F. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Kumaki S.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 upon IL-6 addition is known to occur within 1-5 min and to reach a maximum by 20-30 min (15Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar, 16Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Google Scholar, 17Lai C.-F. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Kumaki S. Gearing D. Zeigler S.F.

Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Google Scholar) consistent with the time course of disappearance of STAT3 and STAT5 immunostaining (Fig. 1 and data not shown). The cytokine-triggered loss of STAT3 and STAT5 transcription factors suggested the involvement of proteasomes in this phenomenon. Fig. 3 shows that the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin both blocked the IL-6-induced loss of STAT3 and STAT5 immunostaining providing evidence for a proteasome-dependent step in this mechanism. The possibility that the loss of STAT3 and STAT5 immunostaining was the result of a degradation of the respective STAT proteins was evaluated by Western blot analyses. The total cellular amounts of STAT3 and STAT5b (Hep3B cells contain STAT5b but little STAT5a; Refs. 15Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar–18Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Google Scholar and 30Lin J.-X. Mietz J. Modi W.S. John S. Leonard W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10738-10744Google Scholar) 2R. J. Rayanade and P. B. Sehgal, unpublished data. showed no change upon addition of IL-6 (Fig. 4A) or upon addition of IL-6 in combination with MG132 or lactacystin (Fig. 4B). Thus the marked loss of STAT3 and STAT5 immunostaining was not accompanied by a loss of STAT3 and STAT5 Western blottable proteins suggesting that the loss of immunostaining was an IL-6-triggered masking of STAT3 and STAT5 proteins and not the result of the degradation of these transcription factors. The observation that p53-Val-135-containing cultures had to be incubated at the wt p53 temperature (32.5°C) for at least 18-20 h before the IL-6-induced loss of STAT3 and STAT5 immunostaining could be elicited suggested that a wt p53-induced gene product which accumulated in these cells in the 18-20-h period was activated in a proteasome- and tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent step upon IL-6 addition into a novel STAT-masking factor. The simplest possibility is that upon IL-6 addition a wt p53-induced protein is proteasomally processed into the STAT-masking factor which binds tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 and STAT5. The functional consequences of STAT-factor masking and the effect of proteasomal inhibitors upon nuclear STAT-DNA-binding activity were evaluated in experiments in which nuclear extracts prepared from IL-6-treated p53-Val-135-expressing cells incubated at either 37°C or 32.5°C were evaluated for their ability to bind a canonical STAT-binding DNA element. Fig. 5 shows that, consistent with the masking phenomenon illustrated in Fig. 1, IL-6 had a reduced ability to elicit STAT3 homodimer DNA-binding activity (“Complex A”) in nuclear extracts prepared from cells at 32.5°C compared to cells at 37°C. Similar data were obtained in experiments with both Line 1 and Line 5 cell lines. As a control, there was no difference in the levels of interferon-γ activated STAT1 DNA-binding activity detected in the nuclear extracts of Line 1 or Line 5 cells cultured at either 37°C or 32.5°C (data not shown), consistent with the observation that immunostaining for STAT1 was not “masked” upon interferon-γ treatment of Line 5 (or Line 1) cells at 32.5°C. Fig. 5 also shows that, at both temperatures, the inclusion of MG132 increased STAT-DNA binding corresponding to Complex C (STAT1 homodimer), Complex B (STAT1/3 heterodimer), Complex A (STAT3 homodimer), as well as a slower mobility complex (Complex A*, presumably corresponding to STAT5), an observation consistent with the effect of MG132 on STAT-specific cellular immunofluorescence (Fig. 3). The increase in STAT1 DNA-binding complexes (“Complex C”) in IL-6-treated cells which had also been exposed to MG132 extends a recent report implicating proteasomes in the turnover/degradation of ubiquitinated and tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 protein in interferon-γ-treated cells (31Kim T.K.

The underlying mechansims have remained elusive. The cytokine-triggered proteasome- and p53-dependent masking of STAT-family transcription factors described in this report represents a novel indirect mechanism for the regulation of cytokine responses by a wt p53-induced gene product. The eventual identification and characterization of the p53-induced STAT-masking factor and the elucidation of its physiological function is likely to add a new, proteasomal, dimension to our understanding of the regulation of cytokine-activated Jak-STAT signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2030948712,"Successful pregnancy is dependent upon an array of signaling proteins secreted by the trophoblast cells of the placenta. Among these is a group of proteins related to pituitary prolactin, known as the prolactin/growth hormone family. These proteins are expressed at specific times during gestation and synthesized in distinct trophoblast cell types in the rat placenta. We report here that select members of this family, prolactin-like protein (PLP-A), PLP-B, PLP-C, decidual/trophoblast PRP, and placental lactogen I variant, only which are expressed in the spongiotrophoblast, late in rat placental development bear Asn-linked oligosaccharides terminating with NeuAcα2,6GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ-R. This reflects the concurrent expression of these prolactin/growth hormone family members with the peptide-specific β1,4GalNAc-transferase and an α2,6-sialyltransferase, which can add sialic acid to terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc. We have determined that at least one of the prolactin-like proteins, PLP-A, is recognized by the protein-specific GalNAc-transferase. The presence of NeuAcα2,6GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ-R on only a limited number of glycoproteins synthesized by the spongiotrophoblasts between mid gestation and birth reflects the need for both the GalNAc-transferase and the peptide recognition determinant for efficient addition of GalNAc. Thus, expression of the GalNAc-transferase and specific members of the prolactin/growth hormone family is developmentally regulated in the rat placenta, suggesting a physiological role for the terminal NeuAcα2,6GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ-R sequence on Asn-linked oligosaccharides of these proteins.

The placenta is a complex organ that is essential for successful growth and maturation of the fetus throughout pregnancy (1Cross J.C. Werb Z. Fisher S.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1508-1518Google Scholar). In addition to bringing oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, the placenta produces a number of hormones, cytokines, and growth factors which influence the endocrine, immune, and metabolic functions of the mother. Among these is a group of closely related proteins synthesized by the rat placenta, the prolactin/growth hormone family. We demonstrate here that specific members of this family bear asparagine (Asn)-linked oligosaccharides with NeuAcα2,6GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ. This is the result of high expression levels of a protein-specific GalNAc-transferase in the rat placenta. Levels of the transferase increase from undetectable at mid gestation to maximal at day 18 of gestation. This corresponds precisely with the expression of the prolactin/growth hormone family members PLP 1The abbreviations used are: PLPprolactin-like protein Cd/t PRPdecidual/trophoblast prolactin-related proteinPL-Ivplacental lactogen I variantPAPSadenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfateWGAwheat germ agglutininWFAWisteria floribunda agglutininhCGhuman chorionic gonadotropinTrftransferrinConAconcanavalin APAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTGCtrophoblast giant cell(s)rrecombinanthhuman-Rcore Asn-linked oligosaccharide. -A, PLP-B, PLP-C, d/t PRP, and PL-Iv by spongiotrophoblasts from the junctional zone of the placenta.

We have shown previously that unique Asn-linked oligosaccharides terminating with the sequence SO4-4-GalNAcβ1, 4GlcNAcβ1,2Man, which is closely analogous to the oligosaccharide structure on the placental prolactin family members, are present on the pituitary glycoprotein hormones lutropin and thyrotropin and are critical for the expression of full biological activity in vivo (6Green E.D. van Halbeek H.

Chem. 1988; 263: 36-44Google Scholar). The sulfated oligosaccharides determine the circulatory half-life of the glycoproteins bearing them because they are recognized by a receptor, the GalNAc-4-SO4 receptor, in hepatic endothelial cells, which rapidly removes these glycoproteins from circulation (9Fiete D. Srivastava V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. Cell. 1991; 67: 1103-1110Google Scholar, 10Smith P.L. Bousfield G.R. Kumar S. Fiete D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol.

Thotakura N.R. Tropea J.E. Grossmann M. Weintraub B.D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3325-3330Google Scholar). In the case of lutropin, the short circulatory half-life is essential for producing the episodic rise and fall of hormone in the blood throughout the ovulatory cycle (13Veldhuis J.D. Carlson M.L. Johnson M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7686-7690Google Scholar, 14Evans W.S. Sollenberger M.J. Booth R.A.J. Rogol A.D. Urban R.J. Carlsen E.C. Johnson M.L. Veldhuis J.D. Endocr.

The presence of terminal GalNAc-4-SO4 on lutropin and thyrotropin reflects the action of a protein-specific GalNAc-transferase and a GalNAc4-sulfotransferase expressed in the gonadotrophs and thyrotrophs of the pituitary (16Dharmesh S.M. Skelton T.P. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17096-17102Google Scholar). The peptide sequences recognized by the GalNAc-transferase consist of a cluster of basic amino acids in the α subunit and a similar cluster of basic residues in the β subunit of lutropin (4Smith P.L. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 329-333Google Scholar, 5Mengeling B.J. Manzella S.M. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 502-506Google Scholar). The recognition determinant on the α subunit, as well as GalNAc-4-SO4, is found on pituitary glycoprotein hormones of all classes of vertebrates, indicating that these are highly conserved and biologically important structures (17Manzella S.M. Dharmesh S.M. Beranek M.C. Swanson P. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21665-21671Google Scholar). In addition, the levels of the GalNAc-transferase in the pituitary gonadotroph rise and fall in parallel to the expression of lutropin in response to changing estrogen levels thus assuring that the oligosaccharides on lutropin are always fully modified with GalNAc-4-SO4 (18Dharmesh S.M. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11127-11131Google Scholar). A rapidly increasing number of glycoproteins that bear Asn-linked oligosaccharides with β1,4-linked GalNAc, but which are unrelated to the glycoprotein hormones, have subsequently been described. Like the glycoprotein hormones, the β1,4-linked GalNAc on a number of these glycoproteins has been shown to be modified with sulfate at the 4-hydroxyl (19Baenziger J.U. Green E.D. Ginsberg V.

Each of these structures is confined to a limited number of glycoproteins because of the peptide specificity of the GalNAc-transferase. In contrast to the sulfated oligosaccharides on lutropin and thyrotropin, biological significance of these structures remains to be established; however, the presence of such unique structures on limited numbers of glycoproteins makes it highly probable that they too will be recognized by specific receptors and play critical biological roles. The concurrent expression in the rat placenta of the protein-specific GalNAc-transferase and specific members of the prolactin/growth hormone family which contain a peptide recognition determinant results in nearly quantitative modification of their Asn-linked oligosaccharides with the termini NeuAcα2,6GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ. Taken together this suggests that these structures will play a role in the expression of the biological activity of prolactin/growth hormone family members during pregnancy. [35S]PAPS was enzymatically synthesized as described previously (34Skelton T.P. Hooper L.V. Srivastava V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17142-17150Google Scholar) using 35SO4 from ICN. UDP-[3H]GalNAc and CMP-[3H]NeuAc were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA), and Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase were obtained from Sigma. Timed pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis). Animals were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation on days 9-21 of pregnancy (day 0 being the day rats were found to be sperm-positive). The placentas were removed and washed with ice-cold sterile 20 mM phosphate buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl (pH 7.4). Placentas were homogenized and used for glycosyltransferase assays, or tissue slices were made for isolation of secreted glycoproteins. Undifferentiated Rcho-1 trophoblast cells were obtained from subconfluent cultures in fetal bovine serum, and differentiated Rcho-1 trophoblast cells were obtained from confluent cultures maintained in donor horse serum as described in (35Faria T.N. Soares M.J. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2895-2906Google Scholar, 36Hamlin G.P. Lu X. Roby K.F. Soares M.J. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2390-2396Google Scholar). Extracts of whole rat placentas, isolated junctional and labyrinth zones, or Rcho-1 trophoblast cells were made as described previously (16Dharmesh S.M. Skelton T.P. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17096-17102Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the combined postnuclear supernatants was determined by the Bradford dye binding assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Transfer of GalNAc or Gal by the glycoprotein hormone β1,4GalNAc-transferase or the β1,4Gal-transferase, respectively, to Asn-linked oligosaccharides acceptors on hCG was compared using the assay described previously (18Dharmesh S.M. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11127-11131Google Scholar). [3H]GalNAc transfer to Asn-linked oligosaccharides of different protein acceptors was assessed as described previously (4Smith P.L. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 329-333Google Scholar). Recombinant prolactin-like protein A (PLP-A) and recombinant prolactin-like protein B (PLP-B) were isolated from Chinese hamster ovary culture medium (37Deb S. Hamlin G.P. Roby K.F. Kwok S.C.M. Soares M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3298-3305Google Scholar, 38Cohick C.B. Xu L. Soares M.J. J. Endocrinol. 1997; Google Scholar). Day 18 rat placenta postnuclear supernatant (100 μg) or partially purified bovine pituitary GalNAc-transferase (2.4 microunits) was incubated with 0.25 mM UDP-[3H]GalNAc (1 × 107 cpm) and either agal-Trf, agal-hCG, agal-rPLP-A, or agal-rPLP-B at either 4 μM or 7.5 μM concentrations under conditions used previously for the GalNAc-transferase assay (4Smith P.L. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 329-333Google Scholar). The enzyme reaction was terminated by the addition of 450 μl of 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.02 M CaCl2 containing 1 mg of Pronase (Calbiochem), and [3H]GalNAc incorporation was determined as described previously (4Smith P.L. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 329-333Google Scholar). Rat placenta postnuclear supernatants were assayed for α2,6-sialyltransferase activity using GalNAc-Trf (39Hooper L.V. Baenziger J.U. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 128-133Google Scholar), a modification of a method described previously (40Weinstein J. de Souza-e-Silva U. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13835-13844Google Scholar). Reactions consisted of 100 μg of postnuclear supernatant protein, 50 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 6.0), 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 50 μg of bovine serum albumin, protease inhibitors described above for the GalNAc-transferase assay, 2 μM CMP-[3H]NeuAc (2 × 105 cpm), and 20 μM GalNAc-Trf in a total volume of 60 μl. The enzyme reaction was terminated by the addition of 40 μl of 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 100 μl of ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, 4% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid. The precipitated protein was pelleted by brief centrifugation, the supernatant containing unincorporated CMP-[3H]NeuAc was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended and washed three times with 5% trichloroacetic acid. The final precipitated protein was solubilized with 250 μl of 1 N NaOH, neutralized with 250 μl of 1 N HCl, and incorporated [3H]NeuAc was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Individual rat chorioallantoic placentas from mid to late pregnancy were sliced using a Stadie-Riggs slicer (A. H. Thomas Co., Philadelphia) and incubated in a 35-mm dish containing 2 ml of minimum essential medium/Earle's medium with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Alternatively, sliced placentas were incubated with sulfate-, cysteine-, and methionine-free minimum essential medium/Earle's containing 100 μCi/ml Trans35S-label (ICN Inc., Irvine, CA; 70% [35S]methionine, 1,173 Ci/mmol). In either case, medium was collected after 16 h of incubation at 37°C under an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Medium was separated from tissue debris by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. Saturated ammonium sulfate was added to give a final concentration of 70% (v/v) and stirring for 1 h at 4°C. Precipitated proteins were isolated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. [35S]Cysteine/methionine-labeled ammonium sulfate pellets were resuspended in TBS (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl), and unincorporated 35S label was separated from the protein in 2-ml aliquots by gel filtration on a 45-ml bed volume column of Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in water. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and lyophilized. The proteins were resuspended in 200 μl of 20 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 6.0) and incubated with either C. perfringens or Newcastle disease virus neuraminidase as described below. The protein mixture was diluted to 1 ml with TBS and applied to a 1.5-ml bed volume column of WFA-agarose (EY-laboratories, Inc., San Mateo, CA) equilibrated in TBS. Following adsorption, the column was washed with TBS (∼50-column volumes) until radioactivity was no longer detectable, and bound proteins were specifically eluted with TBS containing 50 mM GalNAc. Nonradiolabeled ammonium sulfate precipitates were resuspended in TBS and dialyzed against 3 × 2 liters of TBS and applied to 5-ml columns of WGA-Sepharose equilibrated in TBS. The unbound fraction of proteins was brought to 1 mM MnCl2 and 1 mM CaCl2 and adsorbed to 5-ml columns of ConA-Sepharose (Pharmacia) equilibrated in TBS containing 1 mM MnCl2 and 1 mM CaCl2. After washing with 25 column volumes of the equilibration buffer, bound proteins were specifically eluted with TBS containing 0.5 Mα-methyl mannoside. WGA-Sepharose columns were washed with 25 column volumes of TBS, and bound proteins were specifically eluted with TBS containing 0.5 M GlcNAc. Following removal of GlcNAc by dialysis and lyophilization, the bound glycoproteins were resuspended in 200 μl of 20 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 6.0), treated with neuraminidase, and subjected to WFA affinity chromatography as described above. Peptide:N-glycanase F digestions were carried out as described previously (10Smith P.L. Bousfield G.R. Kumar S. Fiete D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 795-802Google Scholar). Digestions with C. perfringens neuraminidase, Newcastle disease virus neuraminidase, or diplococcal β-galactosidase were performed in 20 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 6.0). Digestion with jack bean β-hexosaminidase was carried out in 50 mM sodium citrate (pH 4.5). All buffers contained protease inhibitors described above in the GalNAc-transferase assay. Glycoprotein fractions purified from rat placenta tissue slice medium (7.5 μg/well) were subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted on to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Immobilized proteins were probed with either biotinylated WFA (20 ng/ml) (23Hooper L.V. Beranek M.C. Manzella S.M. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol.

Enzymatic reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of sample buffer (10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.003% bromphenol blue, and 62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)). 35S-Labeled proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Extracts of placenta were prepared at various times during gestation and tested for the presence of the glycoprotein hormone-specific GalNAc-transferase and GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase. GalNAc-transferase activity with the expected properties was detected in placental extracts (Fig. 1), commencing at day 9 of gestation and increased 150-fold by day 18 before falling to lower levels just before parturition at day 21. The specific activity of the GalNAc-transferase on day 18 is 8-fold higher than that typical of rat pituitary extracts, making late gestational rat placenta the richest source of glycoprotein hormone GalNAc-transferase found to date. The placental GalNAc-transferase displays the same protein specificity as the pituitary enzyme transferring 78 pmol of GalNAc to the oligosaccharide acceptor on agal-hCG compared with 1 pmol to the oligosaccharides on agal-Trf at an acceptor concentration of 4 μM. GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase was not detected in placental extracts at any point during gestation (not shown). Furthermore, the specific activity for β1,4Gal-transferase, which is not protein-specific (2Smith P.L. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7275-7279Google Scholar), does not change over the same time frame (Fig. 1). Thus, a GalNAc-transferase with the same peptide and oligosaccharide specificity as the pituitary GalNAc-transferase is expressed at high levels in the rat placenta during pregnancy between days 9 and 21 of gestation. The absence of detectable GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase activity suggested that the oligosaccharides produced would either terminate with β1,4-linked GalNAc or be capped by a moiety other than sulfate. Oligosaccharides terminating with GalNAcβ1, 4GlcNAc (23Hooper L.V. Beranek M.C. Manzella S.M. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5985-5993Google Scholar, 25Bergwerff A.A. Van Oostrum J.

Even though the high levels of GalNAc-transferase activity suggested that large amounts of a glycoprotein or glycoproteins bearing β1,4-linked GalNAc are produced in the placenta during the late phases of gestation, affinity chromatography on WFA-agarose did not reveal large amounts of glycoprotein(s) with terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc following metabolic labeling. This suggested that terminal GalNAc moieties were efficiently capped with another group like sialic acid. Since the α2,6-sialyltransferase (EC 2.4.99.1) will transfer sialic acid to either terminal β1,4-linked Gal or GalNAc (44Nemansky M. Van den Eijnden D.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 311-316Google Scholar), we tested for the presence of α2,6-sialyltransferase in rat placenta membrane preparations from mid to late pregnancy using GalNAc-Trf, transferrin synthetically modified to contain Asn-linked oligosaccharides terminating with β1,4-linked GalNAc, as an acceptor substrate (Fig. 2). Sialyltransferase activity was detected beginning at day 12 and increased 5-fold by day 18 of pregnancy. Day 18 placental extracts were also able to transfer sialic acid to the hydrophobic substrate GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,2Man-(CH2)8 COOCH3 (not shown). The incorporated [3H] sialic acid was resistant to release by Newcastle disease virus neuraminidase, which is specific for α2,3-linked sialic acid, but was sensitive to release by C. perfringens neuraminidase, which removes both α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialic acid (not shown). The concurrent increase in α2,6-sialyltransferase and the GalNAc-transferase activity suggested that the absence of oligosaccharides containing terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc might reflect efficient capping with α2,6-linked sialic acid to produce NeuAcα2,6GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ-R. To identify glycoproteins bearing oligosaccharides with β1,4-linked GalNAc, tissue slices from day 18 rat placenta were incubated with [35S]cysteine/methionine for 16 h so as to incorporate 35S label into the peptide backbone of newly made glycoproteins. The medium containing secreted glycoproteins was collected, gel filtered over Sephadex G-25 to remove unincorporated 35S label, and then incubated overnight in the presence or absence of neuraminidase. These samples were then fractionated by lectin affinity chromatography using immobilized WFA, which is specific for terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc (45Cummings R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 66-86Google Scholar). The bound 35S-labeled proteins were eluted and detected by fluorography following separation by 10% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). Secreted placenta glycoproteins were not bound by WFA prior to treatment with C. perfringens neuraminidase (Fig. 3, lane 3), whereas large amounts of a limited number of glycoproteins were bound following digestion (Fig. 3, lane 1). Digestion with Newcastle disease virus neuraminidase did not result in binding to the WFA column (Fig. 3, lane 2), indicating that a major fraction of β1,4-linked GalNAc is substituted with α2,6-linked sialic acid. The secreted placenta glycoproteins recognized by WFA after neuraminidase digestion are bound quantitatively by immobilized WGA. Secreted, placental glycoproteins that are bound by immobilized WGA represent 15% of the protein applied. The glycoproteins bound by WGA were digested with neuraminidase, applied to WFA-agarose, and equal amounts of protein from the unbound fraction (lane 1) and bound fraction (lane 2) were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Fig. 4A).

EpiD catalyzes the formation of a (Z)-enethiol derivative from the C-terminal cysteine residue of the precursor peptide of epidermin and related peptides. The UV-visible spectra of the reaction products of EpiD are pH-dependent, indicating that the enethiol side chain is converted to an enethiolate anion. The pKa value of the enethiol group was determined to be 6.0 and is substantially lower than the pKa value of the thiol side chain of cysteine residues. The increased acid strength of the enethiol side chain compared with that of the thiol group is attributed to the resonance stabilization of the negative charge of the anion.

INTRODUCTIONSeveral new posttranslational modification reactions, such as dehydration of serine and threonine residues, thioether formation, and formation of D-alanine residues from L-serine residues, are involved in the biosynthesis of the ribosomally synthesized lantibiotics (reviewed in Refs. 1Sahl H.-G. Jack R.W. Bierbaum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 827-853Google Scholar and 2Kupke T. Götz F. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1996; 69: 139-150Google Scholar). The lantibiotic epidermin contains the α,β-unsaturated amino acid didehydroaminobutyric acid, S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-D-cysteine, 3-methyl-lanthionine, and meso-lanthionine (3Allgaier H. Jung G. Werner R.G. Schneider U. Zähner H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1985; 24: 1051-1053Google Scholar). The formation of epidermin from the precursor peptide EpiA (4Kupke T. Stevanovic S. Ottenwälder B. Metzger J.W. Jung G. Götz F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 112: 43-48Google Scholar) includes the oxidative decarboxylation of the C-terminal cysteine residue of EpiA to a (Z)-enethiol catalyzed by the FMN-containing enzyme EpiD (5Kupke T. Stevanovic S. Sahl H.-G. Götz F. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5354-5361Google Scholar, 6Kupke T. Kempter C. Gnau V. Jung G. Götz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5653-5659Google Scholar). Two reducing equivalents from the C-terminal cysteine residue are removed, a double bond is formed, and the coenzyme FMN is reduced to FMNH2. The decarboxylation occurs spontaneously or is also catalyzed by EpiD. The (Z)-enethiol derivative is the intermediate in the formation of the C-terminal S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-D-cysteine residue of epidermin (6Kupke T. Kempter C. Gnau V. Jung G. Götz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5653-5659Google Scholar). The unusual enethiol structure has been confirmed by using mass spectrometry, tandem mass spectrometry, UV-visible spectroscopy, two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, and conversion of the enethiol to a mixed disulfide with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent (7Kupke T. Kempter C. Jung G. Götz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11282-11289Google Scholar, 8Kempter C. Kupke T. Kaiser D. Metzger J.W. Jung G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1996; 35: 2104-2107Google Scholar)). EpiD has a low substrate specificity, and most of the peptides with the sequence [V/I/L/(M)/F/Y/W]-[A/S/V/T/C/(I/L)]-C at the C terminus are substrates of EpiD, as elucidated by analysis of the reaction of EpiD with single peptides and peptide libraries, respectively (7Kupke T. Kempter C. Jung G. Götz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11282-11289Google Scholar).Here we report the further characterization of the reaction products of EpiD. We demonstrate that at physiological pH, the dominant form of the reaction product is the enethiolate anion and that the pKa value of the enethiol group is 6.0. We assume that the enethiolate anion is strongly nucleophilic and is the substrate for the Michael addition-like formation of S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-D-cysteine. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility that enzymes exist in nature that catalyze the formation of enethiol groups from non-C-terminal cysteine residues.DISCUSSIONThe determined pKa value of 6.0 for the enethiol group of SFNSYV-NH-CH=CH-SH is significantly (3 pH units) lower than the reported pKa value for the thiol group of cysteine residues in small peptides. Peptides with a C-terminal cysteine residue in which the negative charge of the carboxyl group is removed (cysteine amides, a negative charge in the vicinity of the thiol group decreases the acidity of the thiol group (11Crampton M.R. Patai S. The Chemistry of the Thiol Group. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1974: 379-415Google Scholar)), as is also the case for the investigated oxidatively decarboxylated peptides SFNSYV-NH-CH=CH-SH and SFNSYT-NH-CH=CH-SH, are reported to have a pKa value in the range of pH 8.8 (12Kortemme T. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 799-812Google Scholar). The increased acid strength of the enethiol group compared with the acid strength of the thiol group is explained by a resonance effect in which the negative charge on the sulfur anion is delocalized in the enethiolate. Delocalization of the negative charge is the reason for stabilization of enolate ions so that the acidity of enols is increased compared with alcohols (13Keeffe J.R. Kresge A.J. Rappoport Z. The Chemistry of Enols. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 399-480Google Scholar).For several enzymes, such as the protein thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase DsbA from Escherichia coli, human glutathione transferase, and cysteine peptidases, it has been shown that the catalytic active cysteine thiol groups have a pKa value near 4.0 (14Lo Bello M. Parker M.W. Desideri A. Polticelli F. Falconi M. Del Boccio G. Pennelli A. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19033-19038Google Scholar–16Roberts D.D. Lewis S.D. Ballou D.P. Olson S.T. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5595-5601Google Scholar). This low pKa value is partially explained by stabilization of the thiolate anion by interaction with histidine or lysine side chains in the tertiary structure of the proteins. It is very unlikely that the peptides SFNSYV-NH-CH=CH-SH and SFNSYT-NH-CH=CH-SH have a defined three-dimensional structure and that this structure is responsible for stabilization of the enethiolate anion.There is a strong correlation between the low pKa value of the thiol group of Cys30 of DsbA and the redox potential of DsbA (17Grauschopf U. Winther R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Google Scholar). The two cysteine residues of the active site Cys30-Pro31-His32-Cys33 form a disulfide bridge, and disulfide-bonded DsbA is a potent oxidant that generates protein disulfide bonds (18Zapun A. Bardwell J.C. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Google Scholar, 19Bardwell J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 199-205Google Scholar). Because of the correlation between the pKa value of the thiol group and the redox potential, we are interested in determining the redox potential of peptides containing both a cysteine residue and a C-terminal enethiol group (e.g. oxidatively decarboxylated precursor peptide EpiA), and we are interested in investigating the reaction between protein thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases and such substrates.As known for thiols (20Lundblad R.L. Noyes C.M. Chemical Reagents for Protein Modification. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1984Google Scholar), we assume that enethiols are far more reactive as the enethiolate anions. Therefore, reasonable chemical intuition suggests that the intermediate in the Michael addition-like formation of the S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-D-cysteine residue of epidermin is the enethiolate and not the enethiol form of posttranslationally modified precursor peptide EpiA. Furthermore, we postulate that in the case of lanthionine formation the thiolate anions of the involved cysteine residues are stabilized by interaction with positive charges within the precursor peptide or by interaction with the enzyme responsible for the thioether formation (EpiC and/or EpiB). Glutathione transferase catalyzes a similar reaction, the nucleophilic addition of glutathione to xenobiotic compounds containing an electrophilic center. It has been discussed that the pKa of the thiol group of glutathione is shifted from 9.0 in aqueous solution to 6.6 in the active site of glutathione transferase so that the predominant species in the active site is the thiolate anion of glutathione (21Graminski G.F. Kubo Y. Armstrong R.N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3562-3568Google Scholar).A fascinating question is whether enzymes exist in nature that catalyze the formation of enethiols/enethiolates from cysteine residues that are not located at the C terminus. Principally, such a reaction can be involved in the formation of the thiazole backbone modification of the gyrase inhibitor microcin B17, whose structure has been elucidated recently (22Bayer A. Freund S. Nicholson G. Jung G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1993; 32: 1336-1339Google Scholar, 23Bayer A. Freund S. Jung G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 414-426Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Enzymes involved in microcin B17 modification have not been characterized, and there is no experimental evidence for the existence of the proposed enethiol-forming activity in microcin B17 modification. By converting the thiol side chain of cysteine residues in peptides and proteins to enethiol/enethiolates the (pH dependence of the) activity and stability of proteins may be influenced to a large extent. However, nothing is known about the stability of these enethiol side chains. Peptides with a C-terminal enethiolate group are unstable, but they are stabilized in the presence of zinc ions (6Kupke T. Kempter C. Gnau V. Jung G. Götz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5653-5659Google Scholar–8Kempter C. Kupke T. Kaiser D. Metzger J.W. Jung G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1996; 35: 2104-2107Google Scholar). In addition to the flavoprotein EpiD, another enzyme catalyzing an α,β-dehydrogenation reaction of peptides has already been characterized; heme-containing L-tryptophan 2′,3′-oxidase from Chromobacterium violaceum is responsible for the synthesis of α,β-dehydrotryptophan derivatives (24Genet R. Denoyelle C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18177-18184Google Scholar, 25Genet R. Bénetti P.-H. Hammadi A. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23540-23545Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2011142183,"The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of ADP and the role of cytoskeleton reorganization during reversible and irreversible platelet aggregation induced by ADP and thrombin, respectively, on the heterodimeric (p85α-p110) phosphoinositide 3-kinase translocation to the cytoskeleton and its activation. Reversible ADP-induced aggregation was accompanied by a reversible reorganization of the cytoskeleton and an increase in levels of the regulatory subunit p85α in this cytoskeleton similar to the increase observed in thrombin-activated platelets. This translocation followed a course parallel to the amplitude of aggregation. No increase in levels of both phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) and phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)P3 could, however, be detected even at the maximum aggregation and PI 3-kinase α translocation. Moreover, in contrast to the situation for thrombin stimulation, the GTP-binding protein RhoA was hardly translocated to the cytoskeleton when platelets were stimulated with ADP, whereas translocation of pp60c-src and focal adhesion kinase did occur. These results suggest (i) translocation of signaling enzymes does not necessarily imply their activation, (ii) the reversibility of ADP-induced platelet aggregation may be the cause or the result of a lack of PI 3-kinase activation and hence of PtdIns(3,4)P2 production, and (iii) RhoA does not seem to be involved in the ADP activation pathway of platelets.

Thrombin activation of human platelets leads to cytoskeletal translocation of the heterodimeric (p85α-p110) PI 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase α) and accumulation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 in an integrin αIIbβ3-dependent manner (6Sultan C. Plantavid M. Bachelot C. Grondin P. Breton M. Mauco G. Lévy-Toledano S. Caen J.P. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23554-23557Google Scholar, 7Zhang J. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Jaken S. Liao L.

Integrins are transmembrane heterodimers mediating cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions. The platelet αIIbβ3 integrin serves as an activation-dependent receptor for the adhesive proteins fibrinogen, fibronectin, and von Willebrand factor. In patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (8Bray P.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 492-502Google Scholar), an inherited hemorrhagic disorder where the αIIbβ3 integrin is absent, reduced, or abnormal, platelets are unable to bind fibrinogen upon activation and consequently do not aggregate. In platelets, as in other cells, integrin ligation triggers the assembly of specific cytoskeletal proteins and enzymes into structures termed focal adhesion sites (9Shattil S.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 149-155Google Scholar, 10Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Google Scholar). These focal adhesion structures comprise proteins such as vinculin, talin, and the integrin αIIbβ3 itself, enzymes such as PI 3-kinase α, phospholipase C, protein kinase C, the tyrosine kinases pp60c-src, pp72SYK, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) or the small GTP-binding proteins, RhoA and Cdc42Hs (11Grondin P.

Rho, Rac, and Cdc42Hs are all members of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins. These molecules are important regulators of the cytoskeleton, and evidence is now accumulating that Rho promotes the formation of focal adhesions and their anchoring to stress fibers (17Ridley A.J.

Depending on the cell type studied, the heterodimeric PI 3-kinase α has been found to be activated by several pathways including interactions of the p85α regulatory subunit with phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases, tyrosine kinases of the src family (20Shoelson S.E.

Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Google Scholar). In platelets stimulated by thrombin, both RhoA and FAK could participate to the activation of PI 3-kinase α, the former presumably by an indirect mechanism (24Zhang J. Zhang J. Benovic J.L. Sugai M. Wetzker R. Gout I. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6589-6594Google Scholar) and the latter by a direct interaction with the SH3 domain of the p85α subunit (16Guinebault C. Payrastre B. Racaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Google Scholar). In addition, heterotrimeric G-protein βγ complexes may be involved in the stimulation of a second isoform of PI 3-kinase present in platelets. This form is immunologically related to a recently cloned monomeric PI 3-kinase, which was designated PI 3-kinase γ and found to be activated in vitro by βγ subunits (24Zhang J. Zhang J. Benovic J.L.

Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Google Scholar). A close relationship between integrin αIIbβ3-dependent p85α translocation to the cytoskeleton and PtdIns(3,4)P2 accumulation has been demonstrated in thrombin-stimulated platelets (16Guinebault C. Payrastre B. Racaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Google Scholar), suggestive of a role of the heterodimeric PI 3-kinase at this stage of 3-phosphoinositide synthesis. However, true assessment of the direct action of thrombin on platelets is difficult due to the presence of several mediators, in particular ADP and serotonin, released from the platelet-dense granules and of mediators such as thromboxane A2 resulting from activation of the arachidonic pathway, all of which interact with their own specific receptors on the platelet membrane. Platelet aggregation by ADP plays a key role in the development and extension of arterial thrombosis (28Born G.V.R. Circulation. 1985; 72: 741-742Google Scholar). Specific inhibitors of the ADP activation pathway such as the anti-aggregatory thienopyridine compounds ticlopidine and clopidogrel (29Schrör K. Platelets. 1993; 4: 252-261Google Scholar) markedly prolong the bleeding time and are used clinically as antithrombotic drugs. Furthermore, a rare congenital bleeding disorder with impairment of ADP-induced platelet aggregation (30Cattaneo M. Lecchi A. Randi A.M. McGregor J.L. Mannuci P.M. Blood. 1992; 80: 2787-2796Google Scholar, 31Nurden P. Savi P. Heilmann E. Bihour C. Herbert J.M. Maffrand J.P. Nurden A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1612-1622Google Scholar) strikingly resembles the acquired thrombopathy resulting from ticlopidine or clopidogrel intake (32Gachet C. Cattaneo M. Ohlmann P. Lecchi A. Hechler B. Chevalier J. Cassel D. Mannucci P. Cazenave J.-P. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 91: 434-444Google Scholar). Contained at very high concentrations in the platelet-dense granules, ADP is released when platelets are stimulated by other aggregating agents such as thrombin or collagen and thus contributes to and reinforces platelet aggregation. Low concentrations of ADP also potentiate or amplify the effects of all other agents, even weak agonists such as epinephrine or serotonin. Addition of ADP to washed human platelet suspensions results in shape change, exposure of the fibrinogen binding site on the αIIbβ3 integrin, and in contrast to other agonists such as thrombin, reversible aggregation in the presence of fibrinogen and physiological concentrations of Ca2+. At the intracellular level, platelet activation following ADP binding to its receptor leads to a transient rise in free cytoplasmic Ca2+, resulting from both Ca2+ influx and mobilization of internal stores, without apparent activation of phospholipase C or D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (33Packham M.A. Livne A. Ruben D.H. Rand M. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 849-856Google Scholar, 34Pulcinelli F.M. Ashby B. Gazzaniga P.P. Daniel J.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 87-90Google Scholar). ADP also inhibits stimulated adenylyl cyclase (35Hourani S.M.O. Hall D.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 103-108Google Scholar). On the basis of its agonist selectivity and signaling properties, the platelet receptor for ADP has been classified as a P2T receptor of the P2 purinoceptor family (36Dubyac G.R. El Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Google Scholar). Although the biochemical structure of this receptor remains unknown, it may belong to the seven transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptor family since ADP has been found to activate the Gi2 subtype of the heterotrimeric G-protein family (37Gachet C. Cazenave J.-P. Ohlmann P. Hilf G. Wieland T. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 259-263Google Scholar, 38Ohlmann P. Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Nurnberg K. Schultz G. Cazenave J.-P. Gachet C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 775-779Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the direct effect of ADP on PI 3-kinase activation and to compare PtdIns(3,4)P2 accumulation during reversible and irreversible aggregation. ADP was found to induce a reversible modification of the cytoskeleton which paralleled aggregation. The regulatory subunit p85α of PI 3-kinase α and FAK reversibly translocated to the cytoskeleton, and this effect was dependent on the presence of αIIbβ3 and on the binding of fibrinogen to its receptor. However, significant accumulation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 did not occur, indicating that although translocation of the heterodimeric PI 3-kinase α occurred, activation did not. Moreover, in contrast to thrombin stimulation, the small GTP-binding protein RhoA was not significantly translocated to the cytoskeleton when platelets were stimulated with ADP, adding further support to a functional relationship between RhoA and PI 3-kinase. The rabbit anti-p85α antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and rabbit anti-FAK and anti-RhoA antibodies were from Tebu (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and an affinity purified sheep polyclonal antibody against pp60c-src was from Cambridge Research Biochemicals Inc. (Cambridge, UK). Human blood was collected from a forearm vein (6 blood volumes into 1 volume of acid/citrate/dextrose anticoagulant), and twice-washed platelet suspensions were prepared as described previously (39Cazenave J.-P. Hemmendinger S. Beretz A. Sutter-Bay A. Launay J. Ann. Biol. Clin. 1983; 41: 167-179Google Scholar). In some experiments, platelets were labeled with sodium [32P]orthophosphate (200 μCi/ml) for 1 h at 37°C during a first washing step in Tyrode's buffer containing no phosphate. The final resuspending medium, pH 7.35, was Tyrode's buffer containing 2 mM Ca2+, 1 mM Mg2+, 0.35% human serum albumin (Etablissement de Transfusion Sanguine, Strasbourg, France), and apyrase (2 μg/ml, a concentration which converted 0.25 μM ATP to AMP within 2 min at 37°C). Platelets were stored at 37°C throughout experiments, and cell count was adjusted in the final suspension to 7.5 × 105/μl using a Sysmex 100 particle counter (Merck Clevenot, Nogent-sur-Marne, France). Aggregation was measured at 37°C by a turbidimetric method in a dual-channel Payton aggregometer (Payton Associates, Scarborough, Ontario, Canada). A 1.45-ml aliquot of nonlabeled or 32P-labeled platelet suspension was stirred at 1,100 rpm and activated by addition of ADP in the absence or presence of human fibrinogen (0.8 mg/ml), or of thrombin in the absence of fibrinogen. The extent of aggregation was estimated quantitatively by measuring the maximum curve height above base-line level. At predetermined times, the reaction was stopped by addition of 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (v/v) for lipid extraction and analysis or by addition of an equal volume of CSK buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100). Lipids were extracted and analyzed as described previously (2Sultan C. Breton M. Mauco G. Grondin P. Plantavid M. Chap H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 831-834Google Scholar). Unlabeled platelets, activated or nonactivated, were mixed with 1 volume of CSK buffer and incubated successively for 5 min at room temperature and for 10 min at 4°C under shaking. Cytoskeletal material was collected by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 10 min, 4°C), washed once with 2 volumes of CSK buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and then washed five times with 2 volumes of CSK buffer containing no Triton. Cytoskeletal proteins were solubilized in electrophoresis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 25 mM dithiothreitol, 3% SDS), boiled for 5 min, and separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels. The protein bands were blotted onto nitrocellulose, and immunodetection was performed with relevant antibodies as described. Washed human platelets were stimulated with 10 μM ADP in the presence of fibrinogen or with 1 unit/ml thrombin in the absence of added fibrinogen. Typical aggregation curves were obtained (Fig. 1A), ADP inducing reversible and thrombin irreversible aggregation. In some experiments, the reaction was stopped at predetermined time points, the cytoskeleton was extracted and cytoskeletal proteins were solubilized, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Small amounts of actin binding protein (250 kDa), α-actinin (100 kDa), and F-actin (45 kDa) were found in the cytoskeleton of resting platelets. After stimulation with ADP, actin binding protein, myosin (200 kDa), and actin were reversibly translocated to the cytoskeleton, maximum incorporation corresponding to the maximum amplitude of platelet aggregation (Fig. 1B, left panel). Myosin was only weakly incorporated into the cytoskeleton of ADP-stimulated platelets. When platelets were stimulated with thrombin, translocation of actin binding protein, myosin, and actin to the cytoskeleton was not reversible (Fig. 1B, right panel). Actin polymerization induced by ADP was reversible and followed a course parallel to the amplitude of aggregation (Fig. 1C). Using a polyclonal antibody, we found an increase in amounts of the regulatory subunit p85α in the cytoskeleton during both ADP- and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 2A). In the case of ADP-stimulated platelets, translocation was reversible and followed the amplitude of aggregation. However, 20 and 40 s after stimulation, levels of p85α in the cytoskeleton were identical using either ADP or thrombin, and PI 3-kinase activity measured in the cytoskeleton followed the same time course (not shown). In order to measure [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 accumulation during platelet aggregation, 32P-labeled washed human platelets were stimulated with 10 μM ADP in the absence or presence of fibrinogen or with 1 unit/ml thrombin in the absence of added fibrinogen. Thrombin stimulation gave rise to the expected time-dependent accumulation of [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 (Fig. 2B, right panel), whereas ADP did not induce any significant synthesis of [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 (Fig. 2B, left panel). In 5 of 7 experiments, where 32P incorporation into lipids was especially high, we could detect only transient trace amounts of radioactivity in both PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 at short times (20 s) following ADP stimulation. Addition of fibrinogen did not increase this labeling. Similar results were obtained using 100 μM ADP (data not shown). ADP-induced translocation of PI 3-kinase α to the cytoskeleton was dependent on the presence of the integrin αIIbβ3, since this effect was not detectable using platelets from a type I Glanzmann's thrombasthenia patient (40De La Salle C. Schwartz A. Baas M.J. Lanza F. Cazenave J.-P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 990-991Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, right panels). Translocation was also dependent on the binding of fibrinogen to its receptor and was clearly reduced when fibrinogen was omitted (Fig. 3, left panels). The residual translocation observed is probably due to secreted fibrinogen. Washed human platelets were stimulated with 10 μM ADP in the presence of fibrinogen or with 1 unit/ml thrombin in the absence of added fibrinogen; the cytoskeleton was extracted at indicated time points and analyzed by Western blotting. The tyrosine kinases pp60c-src and FAK were translocated to the cytoskeleton in a similar manner to the PI 3-kinase regulatory subunit p85α (Fig. 4). In contrast, although thrombin induced clearly detectable translocation of RhoA to the cytoskeleton (Fig. 4, right panel), ADP did not (Fig. 4, left panel), and we could distinguish only a faint band at 20 s. As is now well established (7Zhang J. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Jaken S. Liao L. Fox J.E.B. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4686-4692Google Scholar, 16Guinebault C. Payrastre B. Racaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Google Scholar), thrombin activation of washed human platelets resulted in translocation of the heterodimeric PI 3-kinase α to the actin-rich cytoskeleton, together with production and accumulation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 (Fig. 2B, right panel). These effects of thrombin are dependent on the presence of functional αIIbβ3 integrin (6Sultan C. Plantavid M. Bachelot C. Grondin P. Breton M. Mauco G. Lévy-Toledano S. Caen J.P. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23554-23557Google Scholar, 41Sorisky A. King W.G. Rittenhouse S.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 581-584Google Scholar). In general terms, coordinated signaling through agonist receptors and integrins results in reorganization of the cytoskeleton and formation of focal adhesion structures with translocation and activation of signaling proteins and enzymes (9Shattil S.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 149-155Google Scholar). The aim of our study was to assess the specific role of ADP in these events and to investigate PI 3-kinase α activation during reversible aggregation. So far, the molecular mechanisms leading to platelet aggregation by ADP and its typical feature of reversibility are not well understood. Our results showed an increase in levels of the regulatory subunit p85α in the cytoskeleton of ADP-stimulated platelets equivalent to the increase observed in thrombin-stimulated platelets (Fig. 2A). This translocation was reversible and followed a course parallel to the amplitude of aggregation. Furthermore, this effect of ADP was dependent on the presence of the integrin αIIbβ3 and on the binding of fibrinogen to its receptor (Fig. 3), clearly indicating an “outside-in” signaling event involving the “ADP-activated” integrin. Reversibility of the association of transduction proteins with the cytoskeleton of platelets activated by a thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP) has already been reported to occur 15 min after stimulation in a Ca2+-dependent but aggregation-independent manner (42Dash D. Aepfelbacher M. Siess W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 231-234Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate the rapidly reversible association of these proteins in a manner differing according to the agonist used and the aggregation response. Surprisingly, PtdIns(3,4)P2 did not accumulate even at the maximum amplitude of aggregation, although PI 3-kinase α was translocated to the cytoskeleton in amounts comparable with those found in thrombin-aggregated platelets. This result demonstrates that translocation of the enzyme is an aggregation-dependent event but is not sufficient for activation of PI 3-kinase. At least three pathways of activation of PI 3-kinases have been reported in platelets, involving the small GTP-binding protein RhoA (23Zhang J. King W.G. Dillon S. Hall A. Feig L. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22251-22254Google Scholar, 24Zhang J. Zhang J. Benovic J.L. Sugai M. Wetzker R. Gout I. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6589-6594Google Scholar) and the tyrosine kinase FAK (16Guinebault C. Payrastre B. Racaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Google Scholar) for the (p85α-p110) enzyme, or the βγ subunit complex of heterotrimeric G-proteins for the p110 PI 3-kinase γ (24Zhang J. Zhang J. Benovic J.L. Sugai M. Wetzker R. Gout I. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6589-6594Google Scholar, 26Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Google Scholar, 27Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nürnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Google Scholar). In the case of ADP-induced platelet aggregation, we found pp60c-src and FAK to be reversibly translocated to the cytoskeleton in a manner similar to p85α, whereas RhoA was not. These observations deserve several comments. (i) Gi2 proteins involved in the ADP signaling pathway do not seem to provide PI 3-kinase activating βγ subunits which would otherwise have activated such an enzyme. (ii) The clear-cut difference between ADP and thrombin in inducing translocation of RhoA suggests that PI 3-kinase α could be regulated by this small G-protein as previously reported (23Zhang J. King W.G. Dillon S. Hall A. Feig L. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22251-22254Google Scholar, 24Zhang J. Zhang J. Benovic J.L. Sugai M. Wetzker R. Gout I. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6589-6594Google Scholar). Interestingly, using lysophosphatidic acid as an agonist of a G-protein-coupled receptor, evidence has been provided that Rho-dependent assembly of an actin-based signaling complex linked to integrins was stimulated downstream of Gq (43Moolenar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Google Scholar, 44Hordijk P.L. Verlaan I. van Corven E.J. Moolenar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 645-651Google Scholar). In contrast to thrombin, ADP activates only Gi2 with no effect on Gq (38Ohlmann P. Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Nurnberg K. Schultz G. Cazenave J.-P. Gachet C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 775-779Google Scholar). Our data would fit with this scheme, underlying a possible role of RhoA in regulating PI 3-kinase activity and stabilization of the cytoskeleton. (iii) One cannot exclude a direct role of FAK, since its translocation to the cytoskeleton does not necessarily imply activation. This point could be clarified by looking at tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK during ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Nevertheless, the ADP scavenger apyrase has been shown to prevent tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and the spreading of platelets on immobilized fibrinogen, which suggests that ADP in fact induces this phosphorylation (45Haimovich B. Lipfert L. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15868-15877Google Scholar). Inhibition of PI 3-kinase by wortmannin or LY294002 has been reported to reverse the platelet aggregation induced by agonists such as TRAP (46Kovacsovics T.J. Bachelot C. Toker A. Vlahos C.J. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Hartwig J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11358-11366Google Scholar). These authors suggested that PI 3-kinase activation may be necessary for prolonged αIIbβ3 activation and irreversible platelet aggregation. However, using wortmannin up to 100 nM, we were unable to reverse the irreversible aggregation induced by thrombin, even though the aggregates were smaller (data not shown). Aggregation was also found to be necessary for the late accumulation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 measured 3-5 min after thrombin addition (16Guinebault C. Payrastre B. Racaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Google Scholar). Furthermore, previous studies have clearly established that thrombin-induced translocation to the cytoskeleton of several signaling proteins including αIIbβ3, pp60c-src, PI 3-kinase α (12Oda A. Druker B.J. Smith M. Salzman E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20075-20081Google Scholar, 16Guinebault C. Payrastre B. Racaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Google Scholar), as well as FAK tyrosine phosphorylation (47Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobbi B.S. Parsons J.T. Brugge J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 905-912Google Scholar) require platelet to platelet contacts. Hence, the current data suggest that irreversible aggregation is necessary to initiate a “mechanical” transduction pathway leading to PI 3-kinase α activation, whereas reversible aggregation would appear to be insufficient. Thrombospondin, a large trimeric adhesive molecule released from the α granules of thrombin- but not ADP-stimulated platelets, could contribute to such a late signaling event by binding to the plasma membrane through its receptor CD 36, which has been shown to be linked to tyrosine kinases of the src family (48Huang M.M.

On the other hand, when platelets were stimulated with lysophosphatidic acid (49Zhang J. Rittenhouse S.E. Biochem. Bioph. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 484-490Google Scholar) or concanavalin A (50Torti M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13179-13185Google Scholar), aggregation did not appear to be necessary for the synthesis of PtdIns(3,4)P2. Identification of the PI 3-kinase isoforms involved in these processes would contribute to a better understanding of the different pathways and stages of 3-phosphoinositide synthesis in platelets. Nevertheless, the physiological significance of the synthesis of PtdIns(3,4)P2 depending on irreversible platelet aggregation remains to be established. The microvesiculation and clot retraction occurring at this stage of platelet activation are controlled by mechanisms involving reorganization of the membrane and cytoskeleton, which could be regulated by 3-phosphoinositide synthesis. Alternatively, the results presented here are also consistent with the hypothesis that the typical reversibility of ADP-induced platelet aggregation finds its origin in the lack of PI 3-kinase activation and hence of PtdIns(3,4)P2 formation. Recent data on the effects of wortmannin on platelet aggregation induced by TRAP (46Kovacsovics T.J. Bachelot C. Toker A. Vlahos C.J. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Hartwig J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11358-11366Google Scholar) may indicate that PI 3-kinase products are necessary to stabilize platelet aggregates. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is able to bind to the SH2 domains of several proteins including p85α (51Rameh L.E. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Google Scholar), thereby blocking the binding of PI 3-kinase to tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, which would suggest direct involvement of these D3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides. Whether PtdIns(3,4)P2, among other components of assembled signaling complexes, contributes directly to the stability of platelet aggregates is not known. The differential effects of ADP and thrombin on platelet activation and aggregation may thus provide a physiological model leading to the improvement of our understanding of PI 3-kinase pathways, at least in platelets.

In this study, we used gel filtration and anion exchange chromatographies to resolve the isoforms into eight fractions that were characterized with respect to their biochemical, biophysical, and biological properties. Each fraction contained one to three major protein species with apparent sizes ranging from 11 to 17 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 11-kDa species contains no post-translational modifications and consists of an extended IGF-II backbone terminating at Gly-87. The remaining high Mr IGF-II isoforms are also composed of an 87-amino acid IGF-II peptide backbone but contain increasing amounts of sialated, O-linked sugars. Plasmon resonance spectroscopy experiments revealed that all the high Mr isoforms and mature 7.5-kDa IGF-II bound to immobilized recombinant soluble human IGF-I receptor, recombinant human IGF-binding protein 1, and sIGF-II/MPR with similar kinetics. In addition, radiolabeled tracer experiments demonstrated that both mature and high Mr IGF-II isoforms have similar binding profiles in fetal bovine serum and have similar affinities for IGF-II-binding proteins secreted from human fibroblasts.

Genetic evidence suggests that IGF-II plays an important role in prenatal growth and that its actions are mediated through the IGF-I receptor and another yet uncharacterized receptor (1Filson A.J. Louvi A. Efstratiadis A. Robertson E.J. Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 731-736Google Scholar, 2Baker J. Liu J.P. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Google Scholar, 3Liu J.P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Google Scholar). In addition, IGF-II also binds to the IGF-II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor (IGF-II/MPR). This protein has two distinct functions: first, it mediates the biosynthetic targeting of mannose 6-phosphate containing lysosomal enzymes to the lysosome (for review, see Ref. 4Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Google Scholar); second, it mediates endocytosis of IGF-II, resulting in its delivery to the lysosome and subsequent degradation (5Oka Y. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9090-9093Google Scholar, 6Kiess W. Haskell J.F. Lee L. Greenstein L.A. Miller B.E. Aarons A.L. Rechler M.M. Nissley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12745-12751Google Scholar).The availability of IGF-II for interaction with its receptors is regulated by its association with binding proteins. To date, six different IGF-binding proteins have been characterized and have molecular masses ranging from 22.8 to 31.3 kDa (for review, see Refs. 7Lamson G. Giudice L.C. Rosenfeld R.G. Growth Factors. 1991; 5: 19-28Google Scholar and 8Clemmons D.R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 35: 368-374Google Scholar). In addition, a soluble form of the IGF-II/MPR (sIGF-II/MPR) has been detected in serum and urine (9Kiess W. Greenstein L.A. White R.M. Lee L. Rechler M.M. Nissley S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This protein retains IGF-II and Man-6-P binding activities and is abundant (∼5 μg/ml) in fetal bovine serum (FBS) (14Valenzano K.J. Remmler J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16441-16448Google Scholar). In FBS, ≤5% of IGF-II is in the free state, with the remainder circulating as high molecular weight (Mr) complexes with the binding proteins and sIGF-II/MPR (14Valenzano K.J. Remmler J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16441-16448Google Scholar). Complex formation with the binding proteins has been shown to both inhibit and potentiate IGF-II's interactions with its receptors as well as increase the serum half-life of the ligand (for review, see Ref. 8Clemmons D.R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 35: 368-374Google Scholar).IGF-II is synthesized as a preproprotein (15Bell G.I. Merryweather J.P. Sanchez-Pescador R. Stempien M.M. Priestley L. Scott J. Rall L.B. Nature. 1984; 310: 775-777Google Scholar). After cleavage of its signal sequence, the COOH-terminal 88 residues (E-peptide) of the proprotein are removed to yield the 67-residue, mature 7.5-kDa IGF-II. The mature polypeptide can be subdivided into four domains (B, C, A, and D domains) that are homologous to the B and A chains of mature insulin and the B, C, A, and D domains of IGF-I. In addition, the existence of extended forms of IGF-II has been documented (for review, see Refs. 16Humbel R.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 445-462Google Scholar, 17Rechler M.M. LeRoith D.

Chem. 1992; 267: 8153-8160Google Scholar), although their physiological role in the biology of IGF-II is not clear.To date, high Mr isoforms of IGF-II have been detected in human serum (19Hill D.J. Early Hum. Dev. 1990; 21: 49-58Google Scholar, 20Gowan L.K. Hampton B. Hill D.J. Schlueter R.J. Perdue J.F. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 449-458Google Scholar, 21Zumstein P.P. Luthi C. Humbel R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 3169-3172Google Scholar), cerebrospinal fluid (22Haselbacher G. Humbel R. Endocrinology. 1982; 110: 1822-1824Google Scholar), and malignant tissue extracts (23Daughaday W.H. Emanuele M.A. Brooks M.H. Barbato A.L. Kapadia M. Rotwein P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 1434-1440Google Scholar, 24Daughaday W.H. Kapadia M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6778-6782Google Scholar, 25Shapiro E.T. Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S. Rubenstein A.H. Kew M.C. Tager H.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1672-1679Google Scholar). Human IGF-II variants that are substituted at Ser-29 and Ser-33 with Arg-Leu-Pro-Gly and Cys-Gly-Asp, respectively, with or without E-peptide extensions, have also been identified (21Zumstein P.P. Luthi C. Humbel R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 3169-3172Google Scholar, 26Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Marshak D.R. Cullen K.J. Perdue J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19155-19160Google Scholar). In addition, two IGF-II species with apparent Mr values of 15,000 and 11,500 were purified from human serum Cohn fraction IV1 and represent 87-88-amino acid polypeptides that are glycosylated at Thr-75 (18Hudgins W.R. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Perdue J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8153-8160Google Scholar).We recently described the isolation of a high Mr IGF-II fraction from FBS (14Valenzano K.J. Remmler J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16441-16448Google Scholar). In this study we have separated the high Mr IGF-II isoforms into eight different fractions. Each fraction is composed of a COOH-terminally extended IGF-II that terminates at Gly-87 and contains variable amounts of O-linked sugars. Our studies indicate that all high Mr isoforms are similar to 7.5-kDa IGF-II in terms of both receptor/binding protein interactions and biological activity.DISCUSSIONThese studies were initiated to characterize individual high Mr IGF-II isoforms. Preliminary analysis of the unfractionated high Mr IGF-II pool isolated from fetal bovine serum revealed that it contained at least 12 different IGF-II isoforms and that all species contained an identical peptide backbone extended beyond the COOH terminus of mature 7.5-kDa IGF-II (14Valenzano K.J. Remmler J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16441-16448Google Scholar). In addition, this pool contained a significant amount of sialated, O-linked sugars. In this study, the high Mr IGF-II pool was fractionated into nine distinct fractions to facilitate analysis. Taken together, results from amino-terminal sequence analysis, amino acid analysis, mass spectrometry, glycosidase digestions, isoelectric focusing, and SDS-PAGE experiments demonstrate that all fractions predominantly contain IGF-II species with a 20-amino acid COOH-terminal extension to Gly-87 that is modified with different amounts of sialated, O-linked oligosaccharides.The presence of O-linked sugars on IGF-II precursors may represent an important modification to promote correct processing to the mature form (46Daughaday W.H. Trivedi B. Baxter R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5823-5827Google Scholar). Mapping of the glycosylation site on an extended IGF-II isoform isolated from human serum indicated that Thr-75 carries this post-translational modification (18Hudgins W.R. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Perdue J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8153-8160Google Scholar). While we did not directly determine the location of the modified residues for the different high Mr IGF-II isoforms, our mass spectrometry and isoelectric focusing results strongly suggest that most isoforms are likely to be glycosylated at multiple positions. The E-peptide extension (residues 68-87) contains five potential O-linked glycosylation sites (two serines and three threonines; Ref. 47Wilson I.B. Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 529-534Google Scholar). If three sites were modified with a tetrasaccharide consisting of a Galβ1-3GalNAc core modified with two sialic acids, this would give a predicted size of ∼12,630 and an isoelectric point of 3.9. In comparison, the major species of peak H had an isoelectric point of 3.7 and the Mr range of 10,500-12,500. Similarly, an 87-residue IGF-II with one site modified with the tetrasaccharide would have a predicted isoelectric point of 4.4 and a Mr of 10,600. In comparison, the major species of peak D had an isoelectric point of 4.35 and an Mr of 10,854. Thus, the most likely explanation for the heterogeneity of the different high Mr isoforms is that they contain 1-3 O-linked oligosaccharides, each of which contains one to two sialic acids.Binding studies with mature 7.5-kDa IGF-II and the high Mr IGF-II isoforms indicate that no substantial differences exist in the association or dissociation rate constants (Table II, Table III, respectively) or in the calculated equilibrium dissociation constants (Table IV) for interaction with the sIGF-II/MPR, sIGF-I receptor, or IGFBP-1. In addition, similar distribution profiles among serum-binding proteins (Fig. 7), and similar displacement curves from IGFBP-3 (Fig. 9) and intact human IGF-I receptor (Fig. 12) were observed for both mature and high Mr IGF-II. This suggests that the COOH-terminal extensions do not have adverse effects on the rates or affinities with which these ligands interact with their receptors and binding proteins. This is consistent with other reports. Site-directed mutagenesis studies interpreted in light of the three-dimensional structure of mature IGF-II have implicated three regions of the folded molecule that appear to play important roles in determining protein-protein interactions (48Bach L.A. Hsieh S. Sakano K. Fujiwara H. Perdue J.F. Rechler M.M. LeRoith D. Raizada M.K. Current Direction in Insulin-like Growth Factor Research. Plenum Press, New York1994: 55-61Google Scholar, 49Oh Y.

Hatanaka H. Nagata K. Higashihashi N. Fujiwara H. Sakano K. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5590-5597Google Scholar). Whereas residues 27 and 43 of the B and A domains, respectively, play key roles in IGF-I receptor interactions, residues 48-50 and 54-55 of the A chain are important in mediating IGF-II/MPR interactions. Likewise, residues 48-50, together with 6-7 of the B domain, are important in IGFBP interactions. More importantly, mutations within, or deletion of, the D domain (comprising the carboxyl-terminal six amino acids of mature IGF-II) has no effect on IGFBP interactions (48Bach L.A. Hsieh S. Sakano K. Fujiwara H. Perdue J.F. Rechler M.M. LeRoith D. Raizada M.K. Current Direction in Insulin-like Growth Factor Research. Plenum Press, New York1994: 55-61Google Scholar). Finally, it has been shown that extended forms of human IGF-II display similar binding affinities for the IGF-II/MPR (20Gowan L.K. Hampton B. Hill D.J. Schlueter R.J. Perdue J.F. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 449-458Google Scholar) and the IGF-I receptor (51Perdue J.F. LeBon T.R. Kato J. Hampton B. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3101-3108Google Scholar) as compared with mature IGF-II. Taken together, these data suggest that E-peptide extensions, with or without glycosylation, do not supplement or occlude the important contact regions between IGF-II and the sIGF-II/MPR, IGF-I receptor, or the IGFBPs.An intriguing question still remaining, therefore, is what is the biological significance of the different IGF-II isoforms? One possible answer is that glycosylation is important for proper folding or export of IGF-II. Evidence suggests that glycosylation of proIGF-II is necessary for proper proteolytic processing to the mature 7.5-kDa form (46Daughaday W.H. Trivedi B. Baxter R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5823-5827Google Scholar). If so, the mechanism may involve binding of glycosylated IGF-II to intracellular lectins that retain and present the glycoprotein to the appropriate processing enzymes (52Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Google Scholar). In this case, the sIGF-II/MPR-bound high Mr IGF-IIs may simply reflect inefficiencies in this system resulting in the secretion of processing intermediates. Alternatively, the glycosylated IGF-II species may have unique biological functions. This is not unprecedented as N-linked glycosylation of several glycoprotein hormones is necessary for receptor activation but not binding (for review, see Ref. 53Sairam M.R. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1915-1926Google Scholar). Although no differences in the binding rates or affinities for mature and high Mr IGF-II were observed for the receptors and binding proteins analyzed in this study, this does not preclude the possibility that the high Mr isoforms have specialized roles in signal transduction. For instance, the extensions and/or saccharides could: 1) serve as a targeting signal to concentrate IGF-II in specific tissues or cell types; 2) interact with other cellular components, either when free or complexed with receptors or binding proteins, and/or; 3) alter the efficacy/potency of receptor activation after ligand binding. Such possibilities are supported from previous studies that demonstrated that a high Mr form of IGF-II with an apparent Mr of 15,000 was more potent than mature IGF-II in stimulating the replication of fetal dermal fibroblasts (20Gowan L.K. Hampton B. Hill D.J. Schlueter R.J. Perdue J.F. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 449-458Google Scholar) and in the clonal expansion and differentiation of peripheral blood granulocyte colony-forming cells (54Schwartz G.N. Hudgins W.R. Perdue J.F. Exp. Hematol. 1993; 21: 1447-1454Google Scholar). Future studies will be required to determine if the high Mr IGF-II glycoproteins have other specialized biological activities or pharmacological properties.

Human IGF-II variants that are substituted at Ser-29 and Ser-33 with Arg-Leu-Pro-Gly and Cys-Gly-Asp, respectively, with or without E-peptide extensions, have also been identified (21Zumstein P.P.

In addition, two IGF-II species with apparent Mr values of 15,000 and 11,500 were purified from human serum Cohn fraction IV1 and represent 87-88-amino acid polypeptides that are glycosylated at Thr-75 (18Hudgins W.R. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Perdue J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8153-8160Google Scholar).We recently described the isolation of a high Mr IGF-II fraction from FBS (14Valenzano K.J. Remmler J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16441-16448Google Scholar). In this study we have separated the high Mr IGF-II isoforms into eight different fractions. Each fraction is composed of a COOH-terminally extended IGF-II that terminates at Gly-87 and contains variable amounts of O-linked sugars. Our studies indicate that all high Mr isoforms are similar to 7.5-kDa IGF-II in terms of both receptor/binding protein interactions and biological activity.

Genetic evidence suggests that IGF-II plays an important role in prenatal growth and that its actions are mediated through the IGF-I receptor and another yet uncharacterized receptor (1Filson A.J. Louvi A. Efstratiadis A. Robertson E.J. Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 731-736Google Scholar, 2Baker J. Liu J.P. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Google Scholar, 3Liu J.P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Google Scholar). In addition, IGF-II also binds to the IGF-II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor (IGF-II/MPR). This protein has two distinct functions: first, it mediates the biosynthetic targeting of mannose 6-phosphate containing lysosomal enzymes to the lysosome (for review, see Ref. 4Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Google Scholar); second, it mediates endocytosis of IGF-II, resulting in its delivery to the lysosome and subsequent degradation (5Oka Y. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

The availability of IGF-II for interaction with its receptors is regulated by its association with binding proteins. To date, six different IGF-binding proteins have been characterized and have molecular masses ranging from 22.8 to 31.3 kDa (for review, see Refs. 7Lamson G. Giudice L.C. Rosenfeld R.G. Growth Factors. 1991; 5: 19-28Google Scholar and 8Clemmons D.R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 35: 368-374Google Scholar). In addition, a soluble form of the IGF-II/MPR (sIGF-II/MPR) has been detected in serum and urine (9Kiess W. Greenstein L.A. White R.M. Lee L. Rechler M.M. Nissley S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This protein retains IGF-II and Man-6-P binding activities and is abundant (∼5 μg/ml) in fetal bovine serum (FBS) (14Valenzano K.J. Remmler J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16441-16448Google Scholar). In FBS, ≤5% of IGF-II is in the free state, with the remainder circulating as high molecular weight (Mr) complexes with the binding proteins and sIGF-II/MPR (14Valenzano K.J. Remmler J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16441-16448Google Scholar). Complex formation with the binding proteins has been shown to both inhibit and potentiate IGF-II's interactions with its receptors as well as increase the serum half-life of the ligand (for review, see Ref. 8Clemmons D.R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 35: 368-374Google Scholar). IGF-II is synthesized as a preproprotein (15Bell G.I. Merryweather J.P. Sanchez-Pescador R. Stempien M.M. Priestley L. Scott J. Rall L.B. Nature. 1984; 310: 775-777Google Scholar). After cleavage of its signal sequence, the COOH-terminal 88 residues (E-peptide) of the proprotein are removed to yield the 67-residue, mature 7.5-kDa IGF-II. The mature polypeptide can be subdivided into four domains (B, C, A, and D domains) that are homologous to the B and A chains of mature insulin and the B, C, A, and D domains of IGF-I. In addition, the existence of extended forms of IGF-II has been documented (for review, see Refs. 16Humbel R.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 445-462Google Scholar, 17Rechler M.M. LeRoith D.

Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Perdue J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8153-8160Google Scholar). We recently described the isolation of a high Mr IGF-II fraction from FBS (14Valenzano K.J. Remmler J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16441-16448Google Scholar). In this study we have separated the high Mr IGF-II isoforms into eight different fractions. Each fraction is composed of a COOH-terminally extended IGF-II that terminates at Gly-87 and contains variable amounts of O-linked sugars. Our studies indicate that all high Mr isoforms are similar to 7.5-kDa IGF-II in terms of both receptor/binding protein interactions and biological activity. DISCUSSIONThese studies were initiated to characterize individual high Mr IGF-II isoforms. Preliminary analysis of the unfractionated high Mr IGF-II pool isolated from fetal bovine serum revealed that it contained at least 12 different IGF-II isoforms and that all species contained an identical peptide backbone extended beyond the COOH terminus of mature 7.5-kDa IGF-II (14Valenzano K.J. Remmler J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16441-16448Google Scholar). In addition, this pool contained a significant amount of sialated, O-linked sugars. In this study, the high Mr IGF-II pool was fractionated into nine distinct fractions to facilitate analysis. Taken together, results from amino-terminal sequence analysis, amino acid analysis, mass spectrometry, glycosidase digestions, isoelectric focusing, and SDS-PAGE experiments demonstrate that all fractions predominantly contain IGF-II species with a 20-amino acid COOH-terminal extension to Gly-87 that is modified with different amounts of sialated, O-linked oligosaccharides.The presence of O-linked sugars on IGF-II precursors may represent an important modification to promote correct processing to the mature form (46Daughaday W.H. Trivedi B. Baxter R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5823-5827Google Scholar). Mapping of the glycosylation site on an extended IGF-II isoform isolated from human serum indicated that Thr-75 carries this post-translational modification (18Hudgins W.R. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Perdue J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8153-8160Google Scholar). While we did not directly determine the location of the modified residues for the different high Mr IGF-II isoforms, our mass spectrometry and isoelectric focusing results strongly suggest that most isoforms are likely to be glycosylated at multiple positions. The E-peptide extension (residues 68-87) contains five potential O-linked glycosylation sites (two serines and three threonines; Ref. 47Wilson I.B. Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 529-534Google Scholar). If three sites were modified with a tetrasaccharide consisting of a Galβ1-3GalNAc core modified with two sialic acids, this would give a predicted size of ∼12,630 and an isoelectric point of 3.9. In comparison, the major species of peak H had an isoelectric point of 3.7 and the Mr range of 10,500-12,500. Similarly, an 87-residue IGF-II with one site modified with the tetrasaccharide would have a predicted isoelectric point of 4.4 and a Mr of 10,600. In comparison, the major species of peak D had an isoelectric point of 4.35 and an Mr of 10,854. Thus, the most likely explanation for the heterogeneity of the different high Mr isoforms is that they contain 1-3 O-linked oligosaccharides, each of which contains one to two sialic acids.Binding studies with mature 7.5-kDa IGF-II and the high Mr IGF-II isoforms indicate that no substantial differences exist in the association or dissociation rate constants (Table II, Table III, respectively) or in the calculated equilibrium dissociation constants (Table IV) for interaction with the sIGF-II/MPR, sIGF-I receptor, or IGFBP-1. In addition, similar distribution profiles among serum-binding proteins (Fig. 7), and similar displacement curves from IGFBP-3 (Fig. 9) and intact human IGF-I receptor (Fig. 12) were observed for both mature and high Mr IGF-II. This suggests that the COOH-terminal extensions do not have adverse effects on the rates or affinities with which these ligands interact with their receptors and binding proteins. This is consistent with other reports. Site-directed mutagenesis studies interpreted in light of the three-dimensional structure of mature IGF-II have implicated three regions of the folded molecule that appear to play important roles in determining protein-protein interactions (48Bach L.A.

Hatanaka H. Nagata K. Higashihashi N. Fujiwara H. Sakano K. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5590-5597Google Scholar). Whereas residues 27 and 43 of the B and A domains, respectively, play key roles in IGF-I receptor interactions, residues 48-50 and 54-55 of the A chain are important in mediating IGF-II/MPR interactions. Likewise, residues 48-50, together with 6-7 of the B domain, are important in IGFBP interactions. More importantly, mutations within, or deletion of, the D domain (comprising the carboxyl-terminal six amino acids of mature IGF-II) has no effect on IGFBP interactions (48Bach L.A. Hsieh S. Sakano K. Fujiwara H. Perdue J.F. Rechler M.M. LeRoith D. Raizada M.K. Current Direction in Insulin-like Growth Factor Research. Plenum Press, New York1994: 55-61Google Scholar). Finally, it has been shown that extended forms of human IGF-II display similar binding affinities for the IGF-II/MPR (20Gowan L.K. Hampton B. Hill D.J. Schlueter R.J. Perdue J.F. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 449-458Google Scholar) and the IGF-I receptor (51Perdue J.F. LeBon T.R. Kato J. Hampton B. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3101-3108Google Scholar) as compared with mature IGF-II. Taken together, these data suggest that E-peptide extensions, with or without glycosylation, do not supplement or occlude the important contact regions between IGF-II and the sIGF-II/MPR, IGF-I receptor, or the IGFBPs.An intriguing question still remaining, therefore, is what is the biological significance of the different IGF-II isoforms? One possible answer is that glycosylation is important for proper folding or export of IGF-II. Evidence suggests that glycosylation of proIGF-II is necessary for proper proteolytic processing to the mature 7.5-kDa form (46Daughaday W.H. Trivedi B. Baxter R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5823-5827Google Scholar). If so, the mechanism may involve binding of glycosylated IGF-II to intracellular lectins that retain and present the glycoprotein to the appropriate processing enzymes (52Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Google Scholar). In this case, the sIGF-II/MPR-bound high Mr IGF-IIs may simply reflect inefficiencies in this system resulting in the secretion of processing intermediates. Alternatively, the glycosylated IGF-II species may have unique biological functions. This is not unprecedented as N-linked glycosylation of several glycoprotein hormones is necessary for receptor activation but not binding (for review, see Ref. 53Sairam M.R. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1915-1926Google Scholar). Although no differences in the binding rates or affinities for mature and high Mr IGF-II were observed for the receptors and binding proteins analyzed in this study, this does not preclude the possibility that the high Mr isoforms have specialized roles in signal transduction. For instance, the extensions and/or saccharides could: 1) serve as a targeting signal to concentrate IGF-II in specific tissues or cell types; 2) interact with other cellular components, either when free or complexed with receptors or binding proteins, and/or; 3) alter the efficacy/potency of receptor activation after ligand binding. Such possibilities are supported from previous studies that demonstrated that a high Mr form of IGF-II with an apparent Mr of 15,000 was more potent than mature IGF-II in stimulating the replication of fetal dermal fibroblasts (20Gowan L.K. Hampton B. Hill D.J. Schlueter R.J. Perdue J.F. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 449-458Google Scholar) and in the clonal expansion and differentiation of peripheral blood granulocyte colony-forming cells (54Schwartz G.N. Hudgins W.R. Perdue J.F. Exp. Hematol. 1993; 21: 1447-1454Google Scholar). Future studies will be required to determine if the high Mr IGF-II glycoproteins have other specialized biological activities or pharmacological properties.

https://openalex.org/W2040531143,"The transcription of the mts1 gene correlates with the metastatic potential of mouse adenocarcinomas. Here we describe strong enhancer whose location coincides with the DNase I hypersensitivity area in the first intron of the mts1 gene. The investigation of the transcriptional activity of a series of plasmids bearing deletions in the first intron sequences revealed that the observed enhancer has a composite structure. The enhancer activity is partially formed by the κB-related element: GGGGTTTTTCCAC. This sequence element was able to form several sequence-specific complexes with nuclear proteins extracted from both Mts1-expressing CSML100 and Mts1-non-expressing CSML0 adenocarcinoma cells. Two of these complexes were identified as NF-κB/Rel-specific p50·;p50 homo- and p50·;p65 heterodimers. The third complex was formed by the 200-kDa protein. Even though the synthetic κB-responsible promoter was active in mouse adenocarcinoma cells, a mutation preventing NF-κB binding had no effect on the mts1 natural enhancer activity. On the contrary, the mutation in the κB-related element, which abolished the binding of the 200-kDa protein, led to the functional inactivation of this site in the mts1 first intron. The mts1 κB-like element activated transcription from its own mts1 gene promoter, as well as from the heterologous promoter in both CSML0 and CSML100 cells. However, in vivo occupancy of this site was observed only in Mts1-expressing CSML100 cells, suggesting the involvement of the described element in positive control of mts1 transcription.

The mts1 gene encodes a Ca2+-binding protein belonging to the S100 subfamily (1Barraclough R. Savin J. Dube S.K. Rudland P.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 13-20Google Scholar, 2Jackson-Grusby L.L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18992-18999Google Scholar), have been characterized, the precise biological function of the Mts1 protein remains unknown. The possible involvement of this protein in cell motility and signal transduction is under discussion (5Kriajevska M.V. Cardenas M.N. Grigorian M.S. Ambartsumian N.S. Georgiev G.P. Lukanidin E.M. J.

It was shown in direct transfection experiments that constitutive overexpression of the Mts1 protein in a benign rat epithelial cell line (11Davies B.R. Davies M.P. Gibbs F.E. Barraclough R. Rudland P.S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 999-1008Google Scholar) and in src-transformed rat fibroblasts (9Takenaga K. Nakamura Y. Endo H. Sakiyama S. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1994; 85: 831-839Google Scholar) influenced in vitro cell invasion and promoted tumor progression. In addition, the expression of the mts1 gene correlated with the metastatic phenotype of mouse and human carcinoma cells (12Ebralidze A. Tulchinsky E. Grigorian M. Afanasyeva A. Senin V. Revazova E. Lukanidin E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1086-1093Google Scholar, 13Pedrocchi M. Schafer B.W. Mueller H. Eppenberger U. Heizmann C.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 684-690Google Scholar). Therefore, the study of the regulation of mts1 transcription can give knowledge leading to a better understanding of the changes that occur in transcription controlling mechanisms in carcinoma cells during tumor progression. Transcriptional regulation of the mts1 gene has been studied in the mouse metastatic adenocarcinoma cell line CSML100, where this gene is highly expressed. It was demonstrated that the 5′-flanking area of the mts1 gene up to −1890 bp 2The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pairs(s)NF-κBnuclear factor κBCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseDHSDNase I hypersensitivity siteEMSAelectrphoretic mobility shift assayMsbpsminisatellite binding proteinsPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reactionβ-galβ-galactosidase. did not contain any sequences that positively regulate mts1 gene expression in these cells (14Tulchinsky E. Ford H. Kramerov D. Reshetnyak E. Grigorian M. Zain S. Lukanidin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9146-9150Google Scholar). On the other hand, a positive regulatory element was identified in the first intron of the mts1 gene between positions +294 and +309 (15Tulchinsky E. Kramerov D. Ford H. Reshetnyak E. Lukanidin E.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 79-86Google Scholar). base pair(s) kilobase pairs(s) nuclear factor κB chloramphenicol acetyltransferase DNase I hypersensitivity site electrphoretic mobility shift assay minisatellite binding proteins polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction β-galactosidase. The constructs that contained the CAT gene, under the control of the mts1 regulatory sequences, revealed some level of transcriptional activity when they were transiently transfected into mouse adenocarcinoma cells CSML0, even though the endogenous mts1 transcription was not detectable in those cells (14Tulchinsky E. Ford H. Kramerov D. Reshetnyak E. Grigorian M. Zain S. Lukanidin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9146-9150Google Scholar). Furthermore, mts1 gene transcription can be induced by azadeoxycytidine in two human lymphoma cell lines (16Tulchinsky E. Grigorian M. Tkatch T. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 243-248Google Scholar). Thus it was speculated that DNA methylation is involved in transcriptional control of the mts1 gene (14Tulchinsky E. Ford H. Kramerov D. Reshetnyak E. Grigorian M. Zain S. Lukanidin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9146-9150Google Scholar, 16Tulchinsky E. Grigorian M. Tkatch T. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 243-248Google Scholar). Strutz et al. (17Strutz F. Okada H. Lo C.W. Danoff T. Carone R.L. Tomaszewski J.E. Neilson E.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 393-405Google Scholar) have described a cell-specific enhancer that was present in the 1800-bp upstream region of the mts1 gene. The −1800 to +65 mts1 upstream region placed in front of luciferase reporter gene revealed transcriptional activity in 3T3 and DBF fibroblasts. This activity composed 14-21% of the strength of SV40 early enhancer. On the other hand, the mts1 upstream region was not active in mouse epithelial MCT, embryonic PYS-2, and mesangial MHC cells. In our research we have continued to study the transcriptional control of the mts1 gene. We show that the enhancer activity is associated with the mts1 first intron sequences in mouse adenocarcinoma cells. We report that the previously described regulatory element located between bp +294 and +309 does not exhaust the positive regulatory system which controls mts1 gene expression in CSML100 cells. The deletion of the SacI-PstI fragment (positions +258 and +646) of the mts1 first intron sequence decreased but did not abolish the transcriptional activity of reporter-containing plasmids transiently transfected in CSML100 cells. Another enhancer was found to be located in the DNase I hypersensitive area in the first intron of the mts1 gene between positions +750 and +950 bp. Two regions of DNA-protein interactions were identified in this area. One of these regions represents a κB-related site that binds p50, p65, and another protein with molecular mass of 200 kDa in vitro. The occupancy of this site in vivo was observed only in Mts1-expressing cells. The mutagenesis analysis of the κB-related site allowed us to conclude that the interaction with 200-kDa protein was functional in the nucleotide context of the mts1 enhancer. The second type of proteins that are likely to be involved in formation of DHSs in both CSML0 and CSML100 cells apparently represent Msbps (minisatellite binding proteins) (18Collick A. Jeffreys A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 625-628Google Scholar, 19Wahls W.P. Swenson G. Moore D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3269-3274Google Scholar). These proteins protect intron DNA between +811 and +841 bp and are not involved in the control of mts1 transcription. Nuclei were isolated as described in Ref. 16Tulchinsky E. Grigorian M. Tkatch T. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 243-248Google Scholar and incubated at 37°C for 5 min in 200-μl aliquots with different concentrations of DNase I (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 6 units per aliquot). DNA was purified, digested with EcoRI or HindIII, and analyzed by Southern blot hybridization. To map the DHSs we used two probes. The ExIII probe corresponded to the sequence 1-145 bp from the beginning of the mts1 third exon; the mi-probe corresponded to the +294 to +442 bp from the mts1 gene transcription start. The highly radioactive probes were synthesized in 11 PCR cycles. P-41CATInt plasmid was used as a template. P-41CATInt and p-41CATIntΔ plasmids have been described previously under the names p-41CAT and p-41CATΔ (15Tulchinsky E. Kramerov D. Ford H. Reshetnyak E. Lukanidin E. Zain S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 79-86Google Scholar). The structure of the p-41CATInt plasmid contained the −41 to +1254 mts1 sequences and was as follows: 41 bp of mts1 gene 5′-flanking area, first exon, first intron sequences, 14 bp of the second exon linked to the bacterial CAT gene. p-41CATIntΔ corresponded to the p-41CATInt with the exception of the deleted SacI-PstI restriction fragment. p-41LUCInt, p-1890LUC, and p-41LUC were made by cloning of the −41 to +1254, −1890 to +65, and −41 to +65 sequences of the mts1 gene, upstream of the Photinius pyralis luciferase gene obtained from pfLUC plasmid (20Saksela K. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3698-3705Google Scholar) kindly provided by Dr. M. Jäättelä. Promoterless pLUC plasmid was made by the excision of the c-fos minimal promoter from pfLUC. CAT-containing deletion mutants were obtained as described below. Pdel1 and pdel4 constructs were as follows: p-41CATInt DNA was digested with PstI and, after Bal31 nuclease treatment, self-ligated. Plasmids pdel5 to pdel8 were constructed as follows: after PstI and Bal31 nuclease treatment, p-41CATInt DNA was digested with EcoRI. The obtained fragments were subcloned into PstI/EcoRI-treated p-41CATInt plasmid. Pdel9 plasmid DNA was synthesized on p-41CATInt template DNA in 12 cycles PCR according to Ref. 21Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Google Scholar. As primers we used oligonucleotides AGCAGCCGCGCCCAACGCTGGGAG (coding strand; positions +831, +854) and GTGGAAAAACCCCAGCTGCCTAATAGGAG (noncoding strand; positions +800, +772). This amplification generated deletion of 30 bp between +800 and +831. To generate the plasmids pmut1LUC and pmut2LUC, we introduced the mutations into p-41LUCInt plasmid DNA by amplifying the whole plasmid using non-mutated 5′-end and mutated 3′-end primers: 5′-end, AGTAAGATGAAGTGGCAGAGG; 3′-end, CCTATTAGGCTGCCTGGTTTTTTCCAC (pmut1LUC) or CCTATTAGGCAGCTGCTATTTTTACAC (pmut2LUC). The borders of all deletions as well as point mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis. PGL2 control plasmid that contained the luciferase gene driven by SV40 promoter/enhancer elements was purchased from Promega Inc. To create pM5+ and pM5− plasmids, we cloned five copies of the Sb sequence, GCAGCTGGGGTTTTTCCACTT, in direct (pM5+) and reverse (pM5−) orientations, downstream of the CAT gene in the pCAT plasmid (Promega), where the CAT gene was driven by minimal SV40 promoter. The plasmid pN5 contained five copies of κB oligonucleotide, AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC, from the mouse Igκ enhancer (22Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Google Scholar), downstream of the CAT gene in the pCAT plasmid. Mouse non-metastatic adenocarcinoma CSML0 and mouse metastatic adenocarcinoma CSML100 cell lines (12Ebralidze A. Tulchinsky E. Grigorian M. Afanasyeva A. Senin V. Revazova E. Lukanidin E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1086-1093Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml each of streptomycin and penicillin. 2 × 106 CSML0 or CSML100 cells in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline were transfected by electroporation with a single pulse of 250 V, 250 microfarads using the Bio-Rad electroporation system “Gene Pulser” and seeded on 10-cm dishes. The efficiency of each transfection was monitored by a cotransfected β-galactosidase expression vector pSVβ-gal. Two days post-transfection the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured by a luminometer (Promega luciferase assay system). The obtained lysates were also tested for their β-galactosidase activity by using o-nitrophenyl β-D-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as a chromogenic substrate. In some experiments the transfected cells were subjected to RNA isolation. RNA from transfected cells was isolated as described (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar), treated with DNase I, extracted by phenol/chloroform, and analyzed in RNase protection assay or by primer extension technique. Commercial plasmids pTRIB and pTRIC (Ambion) were used for riboprobes preparation. The intensity of CAT- and β-gal-specific signals was determined using an UltraScan apparatus (LKB). For primer extension analysis CAT-specific primer CAACGGTGGTATATCCAGTG was annealed to the RNA and extended using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Nuclear extract preparation, EMSA, in vitro DNase I footprinting analysis, and methylation interference assay were performed as described (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.(eds) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1 and 2. Green Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience,, New York1987: 2.12-12.31–12.35Google Scholar, 25Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). The +691 to +891 fragment of the mts1 first intron sequence studied in EMSA was amplified in 15 cycles PCR using one end-labeled and one non-labeled primer: GAACATATAGCACCTAGG and TCAACCACAAGCACAGG. The sequences of end-labeled double-stranded Sb-containing and κB consensus-containing oligonucleotides (22Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Google Scholar) analyzed in EMSA are given under “Plasmids.” Oct-1 was detected with the double-stranded oligonucleotide TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA (26LeBowitz J.H. Kobayashi T. Staudt L. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1227-1237Google Scholar). All anti-NF-κB/Rel antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. CSML100 nuclear proteins were UV cross-linked in situ to the Sb containing oligonucleotide, where all Ts were substituted on 5-bromodeoxyuridine, and analyzed as described (27Williams M. Brys A. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4935-4936Google Scholar). The dimethyl sulfate treatment of cell cultures, DNA preparation, and ligation-mediated PCR were performed as described (28Garrity P.A. Wold B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1021-1025Google Scholar). The chain-specific primers were as follows: primer 1, CTGAAACCTGCAAAG; primer 2, CTACCCCTCAAACTCTGGAGATC; primer 3, CTGGAGATCCATGCCAGCACCTTTC. Previously, we have searched in the mts1 5′-flanking area for cis-elements controlling mts1 transcription in CSML100 mouse adenocarcinoma cells. No such elements were found (14Tulchinsky E. Ford H. Kramerov D. Reshetnyak E. Grigorian M. Zain S. Lukanidin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9146-9150Google Scholar). All plasmids studied contained the mts1 first intron sequence and differed by the length of upstream regions. However, the enhancer activity of the first intron of the mts1 gene could mask the function of some regulatory elements located upstream of the gene. Therefore, at the initial step of the search for cis-elements regulating mts1 transcription, we compared the abilities of the mts1 first intron and 5′-flanking sequences to enhance transcription in mouse adenocarcinoma CSML0 and CSML100 cells. The cells were transiently transfected by the constructs whose structure is presented in Fig. 1. p-1890LUC and p-41LUC contained 1890 and 41 bp upstream from the mts1 first exon, the whole sequence of the first exon (38 bp), and 27 nucleotides of the first intron placed in front of luciferase reporter gene. p-41LUCInt construct was generated from the previously described p-41CAT and contained the whole mts1 first intron. The activity of these plasmids was studied in CSML100 and CSML0 adenocarcinoma cells compared with the activity of SV40 promoter/enhancer (pGL2 control construct), taken as 100%. The results of these experiments showed that there were no sequences that significantly influenced mts1 promoter activity between −1890 and −41 bp, neither in CSML100 nor in CSML0 cells (compare p-41LUC and p-1890LUC). The comparison of p-41LUC and p-1890LUC plasmids with the promoterless pLUC revealed that these plasmids were weakly expressed in CSML100 and inert when transfected in CSML0 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). On the other hand, the presence of the mts1 first intron sequence considerably increased the activity of the reporter plasmid in CSML100 (Fig. 1A) and to the lesser extent in CSML0 cells (Fig. 1B). 1226 bp of the mts1 first intron contain several potential TATA boxes, which can work as artificial promoters in transient transfection assay and thereby determine the enhanced level of activity of p-41LUCInt. To exclude this possibility, as well as to check if the first intron enhancer activity can be exclusively addressed to the previously described +294 to +309 positive element (15Tulchinsky E. Kramerov D. Ford H. Reshetnyak E. Lukanidin E. Zain S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 79-86Google Scholar), we transfected CSML100 cells by p-41CATInt, p-41CATIntΔ, and pdel4 plasmids (Fig. 1C). RNA was isolated and normalized to the transfection standard, and the 5′-ends of CAT-containing RNA were mapped by the extension of the CAT-specific primer. The main bands obtained in lanes 1 and 2 corresponded to the 138-nucleotide cDNA and coincided with the predicted size of RNA synthesized from the mts1 gene natural promoter. The deletion of the previously described +294 to +309 element led to the 40% reduction of the mts1 natural promoter activity (Fig. 1C, lane 2). The deletion of the +43 to +1134 sequence in pdel4 plasmid abolished the transcription directed by the mts1 promoter (Fig. 1C, lane 3). The obtained data allowed us to make two conclusions. First, several potential TATA boxes located in the mts1 first intron were inactive in transient transfection experiments in CSML100 cells. Therefore, the constructed plasmids created an adequate model to study transcription from the natural mts1 promoter. Second, in addition to the described +294 to +309 functional sequence, a novel positive element(s) was present in the first intron of the mts1 gene. The presence of DHSs correlates with the binding of transcription factors to nearby DNA sequences in many tissue-specific genes (for review see Ref. 29Gross D.S. Garrard W.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 159-197Google Scholar). Therefore, we have searched for DHSs in and around the mts1 gene as potential indicators for regions involved in the transcriptional control. Nuclei were isolated from CSML0 and CSML100 cells and treated with DNase I in different concentrations. After DNA purification and digestion with EcoRI, the samples were blot-hybridized to the ExIII probe, which corresponded to the third exon sequence of the mts1 gene, close to the EcoRI site (Fig. 2A). The 2.1-kb fragment was detected in DNA isolated from DNase I-treated CSML100 nuclei. The appearance of this fragment identified a DHS 2.1 kb upstream from the EcoRI site, hence in the vicinity of the transcription start. Another DNase I-hypersensitive area, located 1.2-1.4 kb upstream from the EcoRI site of the third exon, was revealed in DNA isolated from both CSML0 and CSML100 nuclei. This area, which contained at least two DHSs located next to each other, corresponded to the first intron sequences (Fig. 2A). In order to map the first intron DHSs more precisely, DNA from DNase I-treated CSML0 and CSML100 nuclei was digested with HindIII and hybridized to the mi probe. This hybridization revealed a cell-specific location of DHSs in the first intron of the mts1 gene mapped 100-300 bp downstream from PstI site between + 750 and +950 (Fig. 2B). The different positions of DHSs in the chromatin of mts1-expressing and mts1-non-expressing cells might indicate both quantitative and qualitative differences in the composition of proteins (possibly including transcription factors) involved in their formation. To determine whether a transcription enhancer element was present within the mts1 first intron DNase I-hypersensitive area, two series of deletion-bearing constructs were obtained and examined by transient transfection of CSML0 and CSML100 cells (Fig. 3). To obtain more reliable statistical data, we have used two different genes as reporters in deletion constructs: CAT (analyzed by RNase protection) and luciferase (analyzed by detection of enzymatic activity in cell extracts). The deletion of the sequence between positions +470 and +780 (plasmid pdel1) did not influence CAT transcription in CSML100 or CSML0 cells (Fig. 3). On the other hand, the +646 to +789 deletion in the composition of the pdel5 construct caused a 2.5-fold reduction of transcriptional activity in CSML100 cells (Fig. 3). Beside that, the +646 to +789 deletion apparently affected activity of CAT-containing constructs transfected in CSML0 cells (Fig. 3A). However, in these cells where the activity of the p-41Int plasmid was relatively low, the sensitivity of the RNase protection method was insufficient to measure the influence of the +646 to +789 deletion (Fig. 3A). The application of luciferase as a reporter gene allowed us to conclude that this deletion caused approximately equal effects on activities of plasmids transfected in both CSML0 and CSML100 cells (Fig. 3B). The expansion of the deleted region to +850 at the 3′-end (construct pdel6) did not change the level of the reporter's expression. However, in CSML100 cells the next deletion mutant, pdel7, with the 3′-end border of the deletion mapped at the position +880, revealed further reduction of the enhancer activity from 35 to 16% compared with the p-41CATInt and p-41LUCInt plasmids (Fig. 3). Pdel7 had approximately the same level of transcriptional activity as the pdel8 construct (3′-end border at +1031). Therefore, two elements located in the DNase I-hypersensitive area in the mts1 first intron composed enhancer activity in CSML100 cells. One element is mapped in the vicinity of +789, and the other is located between +850 and +880 (Fig. 3, compare the transcriptional activities of pdel1 with pdel5 and pdel6 with pdel7). The +850 to +880 region seemed to be not active in mts1-non-expressing CSML0 cells (Fig. 3B). Functional analysis of the mts1 first intron sequences showed that in CSML100 cells the enhancer located in the vicinity of DHSs has stronger activity than the previously described +294 to +309 positive regulatory element (15Tulchinsky E. Kramerov D. Ford H. Reshetnyak E. Lukanidin E. Zain S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 79-86Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B, compare the activities of pdel8 with p-41IntΔ). To further characterize the mts1 first intron enhancer we searched for proteins interacting with the mts1 first intron sequence in the area of DHSs. Gel retardation analysis of the +691 to +891-bp DNA fragment revealed two types of sequence-specific complexes in both CSML100 (Fig. 4A) and CSML0 (data not shown) nuclear extracts: rapidly migrating group of complexes, Cr, and the slowly migrating Cs. Using the DNase I footprinting technique, as well as methylation interference analysis, we found that Cr complexes were formed by the extensive sequence +811 to +841 bp (designated as Sa) which contains the minisatellite “core” element, CTGGGCAGGCAG (data not shown). The minisatellite core sequence was shown to be able to interact with the ubiquitously expressed minisatellite-binding proteins, Msbps (18Collick A. Jeffreys A.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3269-3274Google Scholar), which form rapidly migrating complexes that appear to be similar to Cr complexes. Cr complexes were not functional in transient transfection; the deletion of the +801 to +830 as well as the +789 to +850 intron sequences did not influence mts1 enhancer activity neither in CSML100 nor in CSML0 cells (compare p-41CATInt and p-41LUCInt to pdel9, and pdel5 to pdel6, Fig. 3, A and B). On the other hand, Msbps strongly interacting with the +811 to +841-bp sequence in vitro could be involved in the formation of DHSs in vivo in both CSML0 and CSML100 cells. The methylation interference analysis of Cs revealed two guanines with the coordinates +789 and +790 (sense strand) and three guanines with the coordinates +797, +798, and +800 (antisense strand) which were directly involved in the formation of this complex (Fig. 4B). The positions of these guanines directly coincided with the location of κB-related sequence. Moreover, +788 and +789 guanines were deleted in pdel5 construct which revealed the decreased expression in both CSML100 and CSML0 cells, but they remained intact in the structure of pdel1 plasmid with a wild-type level of enhancer activity (Fig. 3). The κB-related sequence was designated as Sb. A more detailed study of proteins interacting with the Sb sequence was performed. The end-labeled 21-mer oligonucleotide that contained Sb sequence was mixed with 15 μg of CSML0 (Fig. 5, lanes 1-3) or 15 μg of CSML100 nuclear extracts (lanes 6-8) and analyzed in EMSA. We observed three sequence-specific complexes in both extracts used. In addition, another complex designated as C2 was observed in some CSML0 and CSML100 nuclear extracts. This complex was poorly reproducible, and its appearance could result from C1 degradation. Slowly migrating C1 seemed to be identical with Cs formed by the Sb sequence in the composition of the +691 to +891 fragment (Fig. 4); two more rapidly migrating complexes were NF-κB-specific; their formation was abolished when 100-fold excess of the nonlabeled κB consensus oligonucleotide was added (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 and 8). To determine the composition of these complexes, we used specific antibodies to all known members of the NF-κB/Rel family. Gel supershift analysis revealed that rapidly migrating complexes represent p50·;p50 homo- and p50·;p65 heterodimers in both CSML0 and CSML100 cells (data not shown). C1 and C2 complexes were not influenced by any of the anti-NF-κB antibodies. In order to determine the number and molecular weights of the proteins compri"

Therefore, the metabolism of variously labeled [13C]- and [14C]glutamates has been studied in isolated rabbit kidney tubules with and without acetate. CO2, glutamine, and alanine were the main carbon and nitrogenous end products of glutamate metabolism but no ammonia accumulated. Absolute fluxes through enzymes involved in glutamate metabolism, including enzymes of four different cycles operating simultaneously, were assessed by combining mainly the 13C NMR data with a new model of glutamate metabolism. In contrast to a previous conclusion of Klahr et al. (Klahr, S., Schoolwerth, A. C., and Bourgoignie, J. J. (1972) Am. J. Physiol. 222, 813-820), glutamate metabolism was found to be initiated by glutamate dehydrogenase at high rates. Glutamate dehydrogenase also operated at high rates in the reverse direction; this, together with the operation of the glutamine synthetase reaction, masked the release of ammonia. Addition of acetate stimulated the operation of the “glutamate →α-ketoglutarate → glutamate” cycle and the accumulation of glucose but reduced both the net oxidative deamination of glutamate and glutamine synthesis. Acetate considerably increased flux through α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase at the expense of flux through phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; acetate also caused a large decrease in flux through alanine aminotransferase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and the “substrate cycle” involving oxaloacetate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate."

Hybrids between the coding regions of the phenylalanine-activating module of tyrocidine synthetase and the valine-activating module of surfactin synthetase were constructed by combining the two reading frames at various highly conserved consensus sequences. The resulting DNA fragments were expressed in Escherichia coli as C-terminal fusions to the gene encoding for the maltose-binding protein. The fusion proteins were purified, and the amino acid specificities, the acceptance of different nucleotide analogues, and the substrate binding affinities were analyzed. We found evidence for a large N-terminal domain and a short C-terminal domain of about 19 kDa within the two modules, which are separated by the sequence motif GELCIGG. The two domains could be reciprocally transferred between the two modules, and the constructed hybrid proteins showed amino acid adenylating activity. Hybrid proteins fused at various consensus motifs within the two domains were inactive, indicating that the domains may fold independently and represent complex functional units. The N-terminal domain was found to be responsible for the amino acid specificity of the modules, and it is also involved in the recognition of the ribosyl and the phosphate moieties of the nucleotide substrate. For tyrocidine synthetase I, we could confine the sites for amino acid specificity to a region of 330 residues.

This is the first report of a homoplasmic missense point mutation of the mitochondrial DNA acting as a functional suppressor of a mutation located in a nuclear gene and the first demonstration that the supernumerary core protein 2 subunit is not essential for the electron transfer and energy transducing functions of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex.

In the mitochondrial respiratory chain, the cytochrome bc1 complex transfers electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c and couples this electron transfer to vectorial proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane (for reviews, see Refs. 1Trumpower B.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 101-129Google Scholar, 2Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Google Scholar). The structure of this respiratory enzyme is best characterized for yeast, beef, and potato where it consists of 10 or 11 different polypeptide subunits, three of which (cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, and the Rieske iron-sulfur protein) carry redox prosthetic groups, and 7 to 8 polypeptides, which lack redox prosthetic groups (core proteins 1 and 2 and five to six small proteins with molecular masses below 15 kDa). The cytochrome b subunit is encoded by the mitochondrial DNA while all the other subunits of the complex are encoded in the nucleus. The three subunits carrying redox prosthetic groups have been studied extensively, and their roles in electron transfer and proton translocation have been elucidated. Much less is known about the subunits that do not carry redox prosthetic groups. These are often referred to as supernumerary subunits because they have no counterparts in bacteria such as Paracoccus denitrificans and Rhodospirillum rubrum, where the cytochrome bc1 complex contains only cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, and the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (3Yang X.

The bacterial and mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complexes exhibit essentially identical electron transfer and proton translocating activities, suggesting that the supernumerary polypeptides of the mitochondrial enzyme are not directly involved in the energy transducing mechanism (5Yang X. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11962-11970Google Scholar).

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1439-1447Google Scholar). Although they are proteolytically inactive, the two core proteins of the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex show structural similarities to MPP (17Tzagoloff A. Wu M. Crivellone M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17163-17169Google Scholar, 18Oudshoorn P. Van Steeg H. Swinkels B.W. Schoppink P. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 97-103Google Scholar). Thus, it is believed that the core proteins and MPP have a common phylogenetic origin in an ancestral protease and that the proteolytic activity became detached from the yeast complex after some gene duplication occurred (6Schulte U. Arretz M. Schneider H. Tropschug M. Wachter E. Neupert W. Weiss H. Nature. 1989; 339: 147-149Google Scholar, 12Braun H.-P. Schmitz U.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 171-174Google Scholar). matrix processing protease polymerase chain reaction. The question which remains to be addressed is what are the functions of the proteolytically inactive core proteins of the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex? Yeast mutants with a structural deficiency in either core protein 1 or core protein 2 fail to properly assemble the cytochrome bc1 complex and, consequently, they do not grow or have extremely reduced growth rates on non-fermentable substrates (17Tzagoloff A. Wu M. Crivellone M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17163-17169Google Scholar, 18Oudshoorn P. Van Steeg H. Swinkels B.W. Schoppink P. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 97-103Google Scholar). Here we aimed to know if the respiratory capacity can be restored in such a mutant by a second mutation in another gene, thus allowing the assembly of bc1 complex despite a core protein deficiency. We first describe a mutant in which about half of core protein 2 is lacking due to a frameshift mutation in its gene and show that the assembly of the bc1 complex is blocked in this mutant. We then show that the assembly and activity of the complex are restored by a second mutation located in the mitochondrial DNA which replaces serine 223 by proline in cytochrome b and that this single missense mutation eliminates the need for core protein 2. This is the first report of a homoplasmic missense point mutation of the mitochondrial DNA acting as a functional suppressor of a mutation located in a nuclear gene. This also unequivocally establishes that core protein 2 is not centrally involved in the electron transfer and energy transducing functions of the bc1 complex and emphasizes the question of its biological role.

Genomic DNAs were prepared from the mutant and wild-type strains (23Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene. 1987; 57: 267-272Google Scholar) and were PCR amplified with two primers flanking the COR2 gene: C1, 5′-GCTCGAACGATTAGGACGGG and C2, 5′-CCTTTAGTTTTTCGTTTTGTAC (the 5′-ends are located, respectively, at nucleotide positions −58 and +1141 from the first base of the initiator AUG codon; see Ref. 18Oudshoorn P. Van Steeg H. Swinkels B.W. Schoppink P. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 97-103Google Scholar). PCR was performed from 100 ng of genomic DNA with 25 pmol of each primer in 50 μl of each 200 μM dNTP, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100, containing 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Bioprobe), at 95°C for 3 min, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1.5 min (for 1 cycle), at 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 1.5 min (for 28 cycles), and at 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 15 min (for 1 cycle). The PCR products were sequenced twice from separately made PCR products using a primer extension procedure developed by E. Coissac 2E. Coissac, Gif-sur-Yvette, France, personal communication. with primers C1 and C2 and three primers located between C1 and C2: S1, 5′-GCTTTGAAATTAGTCAGAG (+189); S2, 5′-CCGAAGACCAATTGTATGCC (+424); and S3, 5′-GGTGAAGAAAACAGGG (+675). Twenty-two independent subclones of the mutant SM45 were grown until stationary phase in 10% glucose, 1% yeast extract, 1% bactopeptone, and 20 mg/liter adenine. About 5 × 108 cells of each culture were plated on 2% glycerol, 1% yeast extract, 1% bactopeptone, and 2% agar. Eleven subclones gave at least one colony after 1 week of incubation at 28°C. Twenty-two isolates (2 per original subclone) corresponding to at least 11 independent reversion events were retained for further analysis. The revertants were treated with ethidium bromide to eliminate their mitochondrial DNA (rho0) and then back-crossed to the original mutant (strain CB10-2a). With one revertant, called SM45/CB2, all the resulting diploid cells were respiratory deficient, indicating that this revertant was either nuclear recessive or mitochondrial. The 21 other revertants gave respiratory competent diploids and were thus nuclear dominant. These were not further analyzed. Two additional test-crosses proved that the revertant SM45/CB2 was the result of a mutation located in the mtDNA. First, the original mutant (strain CB10-2a) was treated with ethidium bromide to eliminate its mitochondrial DNA (rho0) and then crossed to the revertant SM45/CB2; the resulting diploid progeny was composed entirely (barring the spontaneous rho− cells occurring in all yeast cultures) by respiratory competent cells (it would have been composed of only respiratory deficient cells if the suppressor was nuclear recessive). Second, the revertant SM45/CB2 was crossed synchronously to the original mutant (strain CB10-2a) and after segregation of mitochondrial heteroplasmons, about 50% of the resulting diploid cells were respiratory competent (mitotic segregation of respiratory competence would not have been observed if the suppressor was nuclear recessive). The suppressor was localized on mtDNA using a previously described procedure (24Kruszewska A. Slonimski P.P. Curr. Genet. 1984; 9: 1-10Google Scholar). To this end the revertant SM45/CB2 was treated 15 h at 28°C in 0.4% NaCl containing 10 mg/liter ethidium bromide, and the resulting rho− cells were tested for the retention or loss of the suppressor mutation by crossing with the original mutant (strain CB10-2a). Forty rho− clones having retained the suppressor mutation were then analyzed for the retention or loss of the wild-type alleles of four different mit− mutations previously located on mtDNA (25Slonimski P.P.

As summarized in Table II, the rho− tested were all able to rescue mit− mutations located in the cytochrome b gene, whereas only a minor fraction of them were able to rescue mit− mutations located in the genes COXI and COXII, indicating that the suppressor mutation is located in the cytochrome b gene.Table IILocation of the SM45/CB2 suppressor mutation in the cytochrome b gene by rho− deletion mappingcoxIIcytbcoxIn0 of rho−oxi1-V45cob-M7622cob-M4410oxi3-G481+++−1−++−31−+++8 Open table in a new tab Optical spectra of cytochromes were recorded at liquid nitrogen temperature with a Cary 128 spectrophotometer after reduction of the cytochromes by dithionite of whole cells grown for 1 day at 28°C on 2% glucose, 1% yeast extract, 1% bactopeptone, and 2% agar (27Claisse M.

The cytochrome b mRNA was sequenced by primer extension with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Amersham Corp.) from total mitochondrial RNA of the SM45/CB2 revertant (28di Rago J.-P. Netter P. Slonimski P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3332-3339Google Scholar). Mitochondrial membranes were isolated using a procedure described previously (29Graham L.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22485-22492Google Scholar). Yeast were grown overnight on 2% glucose, 1% yeast extract, 1% bactopeptone, and 2% agar. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min. They were then washed once with distilled water and resuspended in 400 mM mannitol, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, and 2 mM EDTA. The yeast were disrupted using glass beads in five 1-min intervals using a Biospec Products Bead-Beater. The cell extract was diluted with 1 volume of ice-cold Tris/mannitol buffer and centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 × g at 4°C to remove intact cells. The supernatant was saved and recentrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. Mitochondrial membranes were collected by centrifugation of the supernatant at 16,000 × g for 20 min. Membranes were washed twice with 150 mM NaCl and recentrifuged. Final membrane pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris, 1 mM MgSO4, pH 7.6, containing 50% glycerol and stored at −20°C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (50Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) as modified by Markwell et al. (51Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Google Scholar). Ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity was assayed at pH 7.0 and 23°C using the substrate analog 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-n-nonyl-1,4-benzoquinol (52Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8697-8706Google Scholar). The nonenzymatic rate of cytochrome c reduction was determined by the addition of quinol to the assay buffer and allowing the reaction to proceed for approximately 5 s. The enzymatic rate was then initiated by adding the membrane fraction to the assay buffer. Rates were obtained in duplicate and varied less than 10%. The amounts of proteins used in the enzyme assays are given in the legend of Fig. 2. Immunoblot analysis on the mitochondrial membranes prepared as described above was performed with polyclonal antibodies raised against purified cytochrome bc1 complex as described previously (29Graham L.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22485-22492Google Scholar). The amounts of protein used in the immunoblot analysis are given in the legends of Fig. 4. The mutant CW30/SM45 (abbreviated SM45; Table I) exhibits a substrate-conditional phenotype commonly observed in strains with respiratory defective mitochondria. It grows on glucose but cannot grow on non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol, ethanol, or lactate, the metabolism of which needs functional mitochondria (Fig. 1). The phenotype of this mutant was complemented by crossing with a rho0 tester strain (KL14-4A/60), indicating that the respiratory defect is caused by a nuclear recessive mutation and not by a deficiency of mitochondrial DNA. The mutant SM45 is devoid of dithionite-reducible cytochrome b while the amounts of cytochromes a and a3 are not markedly modified, indicating a specific defect at the level of the cytochrome bc1 complex (Fig. 2). A complementing DNA fragment was selected by transformation of the mutant SM45 with a plasmid library of yeast nuclear DNA. The restriction enzyme digestion pattern of the fragment suggested the presence of the COR2 gene (17Tzagoloff A. Wu M. Crivellone M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17163-17169Google Scholar), and this was confirmed by complementation of a strain carrying a null allele in core protein 2 (strain HR2::40K0). Finally, sequence determination of the chromosomal COR2 locus in SM45 showed the deletion of 1 base pair at codon 165 in comparison with the wild-type COR2 gene. As a result of this mutation, the last 204 residues of wild-type core protein 2 are replaced by 32 novel residues as indicated in Fig. 3. This mutation will be referred to as cor2-45. In order to better understand how the cor2-45 mutation affects assembly of the cytochrome bc1 complex, we used antibodies that recognize core proteins 1 and 2 (29Graham L.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22485-22492Google Scholar) to test for the presence of these subunits in the mutant. As shown in Fig. 4, these antibodies also recognize a third protein that migrates ahead of core protein 2 and is distinct therefrom. The identity of this protein is not known. It is unlikely to be a subunit of the MPP protease, analogous to the protease subunit in the potato cytochrome bc1 complex (30Emmermann M. Braun H.P. Schmitz Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 237-245Google Scholar), since the yeast MPP subunits have apparent molecular masses of 48 and 51 kDa, and the unknown bc1 protein migrates with an apparent molecular mass of less than 40 kDa. The unknown protein is not derived from the COR2 gene since it is not affected by the loss of core 2 protein (Fig. 4, lane 2), and it is present when the COR2 gene is deleted (Fig. 4, lane 5). Although it is possible that this is a spurious impurity, this seems unlikely since a protein of identical size is present in invariant amounts in highly purified preparations of yeast bc1 complex (see Fig. 11 in Ref. 1Trumpower B.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 101-129Google Scholar). Further experimentation is in progress to establish the identity and possible function of this bc1-associated protein. As expected, no immunological response corresponding to core protein 2 was detected in the mutant carrying the cor2-45 mutation (Fig. 4, lane 2). We did not observe any signal that could correspond to the mutated protein. A possible explanation is that the antibodies react with the C-terminal half of core protein 2, which is lacking in the mutant, or that the mutated protein is more prone to proteolytic degradation. As shown previously (18Oudshoorn P. Van Steeg H. Swinkels B.W. Schoppink P. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 97-103Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 1, Fig. 2), a mutant carrying a null allele in the core protein 2 gene grows slowly on non-fermentable substrates and exhibits a low level of cytochrome c reductase activity. Surprisingly, the growth on non-fermentable substrates as well as the cytochrome c reductase activity are virtually abolished by the cor2-45 mutation (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Moreover, only traces of core protein 1 are present in cells carrying the cor2-45 mutation (Fig. 4, lane 2), whereas core protein 1 is at a nearly normal level in the core 2 deletion strain (Fig. 4, lane 5). From these results, it is clear that the cor2-45 frameshift mutation has more severe effects than a deletion allele in the COR2 gene. As shown in Fig. 3, the cor2-45 mutation presumably leads to the synthesis of a truncated protein with a net charge of +15 versus +1 for the wild-type protein. This drastic charge and size modification could be responsible for the toxic effects of cor2-45, for instance, by allowing potentially harmful protein-protein interactions between the modified core protein 2 and other subunits of the cytochrome bc1 complex. This led us, as described in the next section, to search for extragenic suppressor mutations, in order to see if the effects of the cor2-45 mutation can be alleviated by a second mutation in another subunit of the complex. Only 1 revertant (SM45/CB2) out of 22 isolates was due to a mutation in mtDNA. The mutation was mapped by rho− deletion mapping to the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (Table II) and sequenced. The suppressor mutation leads to replacement of the serine codon 223 (TCA) by a proline codon (CCA). The revertant SM45/CB2 grows on glycerol medium (Fig. 1), exhibits ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity of at least 60% of that of the wild type (Fig. 2, right panel), and spectrally detectable cytochrome b is partially restored (Fig. 2, left panel). In addition, core protein 1, which is dramatically decreased by the cor2-45 mutation, is present at a nearly normal level in the revertant (Fig. 4, lane 3). We then tested whether the S223P mutation in cytochrome b can also alleviate the effects seen with a null allele in COR2, which encodes core protein 2. To this end, we constructed by cytoduction a yeast strain having the nucleus of the COR2 deletion strain HR2::40K0 and the mtDNA of the revertant SM45/CB2 (Table I). Analysis of this strain (CHR2::40K0) clearly showed that the null allele in COR2 becomes less deleterious in the presence of cytochrome b containing the S223P mutation, as indicated by a markedly faster growth rate on glycerol medium (Fig. 1), a substantially higher content of spectrally detectable cytochrome b (Fig. 2), and a three- to four-fold increase in the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity (Fig. 2). As a control, we tested whether the S223P mutation in cytochrome b gives a phenotype when associated with the wild-type core protein 2. To this end, we constructed a strain having the nucleus of the wild-type strain CW30 and the mtDNA of the revertant SM45/CB2 (Table I). This strain (CCW30) exhibits normal cytochrome b content and grows normally on glycerol medium (Fig. 2), indicating that the S223P mutation in cytochrome b by itself has no deleterious effects on the cytochrome bc1 complex. In the studies reported here, we first describe a frameshift mutation (cor2-45) in the nuclear COR2 gene by which the last 204 residues of core protein 2 are replaced by 32 novel residues and show that this mutation severely impairs assembly of the cytochrome bc1 complex. We then show that assembly of an active bc1 complex is restored by a single base pair transition in mitochondrial DNA, which leads to replacement of serine 223 by proline in cytochrome b. This is the first known example of a homoplasmic missense point mutation of the mitochondrial DNA acting as a functional suppressor of a mutation located in a nuclear gene. Replacement of serine 223 by proline in cytochrome b not only corrects the cytochrome bc1 complex deficiency resulting from the original frameshift mutation, but it also obviates the need for the core 2 protein since it alleviates the respiratory deficiency resulting from its complete deletion. It should be noted that the frameshift mutation strain is more responsive to the suppression by the cytochrome b mutation than is the cor2 deletion strain (60% and 41%, respectively, in terms of activity relative to the wild type are recovered by the S223P replacement). It is possible that the remaining part of core protein 2 in cor2-45 (about half of the wild-type protein) helps the assembly of or stabilize the bc1 complex, which could explain the observed differences in terms of activity and growth rates of the corresponding strains. These unexpected results illustrate unequivocally that the core 2 subunit of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex is not essential for the electron transfer and energy transducing functions of this respiratory enzyme, which is consistent with the finding that cytochrome bc1 complexes from bacteria do not contain such proteins (3Yang X. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12282-12289Google Scholar, 4Wynn R.M. Gaul D.F. Choi W.K. Shaw R.W. Knaff D.B. Photosynth. Res. 1986; 9: 181-195Google Scholar). Core proteins 1 and 2 are the two largest subunits, contributing about half of the protein mass of the bc1 complex. They are proximal to each other (31Gonzalez-Halphen D. Lindorfer M.A. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7021-7031Google Scholar), lack any obvious membrane-anchoring domains (17Tzagoloff A. Wu M. Crivellone M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17163-17169Google Scholar, 18Oudshoorn P. Van Steeg H. Swinkels B.W. Schoppink P. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 97-103Google Scholar), and extend from the phospholipid bilayer into the matrix phase (32Karlsson B. Hovmöller S. Weiss H. Leonard K. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 165: 287-302Google Scholar). Cytochrome b is a highly hydrophobic protein with eight α-helical segments spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane, as deduced from hydropathy calculations (33Crofts A.R. Robinson H. Andrews K.

Acta. 1993; 1143: 243-271Google Scholar–37di Rago J.-P. Hermann-Le Denmat S. Pâques F. Risler J.-L. Netter P. Slonimski P.P. J. Mol.

In the eight-helix cytochrome b models, serine 223 is located in a matrix-exposed loop that connects transmembrane helices D and E, as shown in Fig. 5. Thus, the suppressor mutation affects a subdomain of cytochrome b that may be in contact with the core proteins. In yeast, a null mutation in core protein 1 does not significantly affect the steady-state concentration of core 2 (39Crivellone M.D. Wu M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14323-14333Google Scholar); similarly, a null mutation in core protein 2 does not markedly change that of core protein 1 (Fig. 4) (18Oudshoorn P. Van Steeg H. Swinkels B.W. Schoppink P. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 97-103Google Scholar, 39Crivellone M.D. Wu M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14323-14333Google Scholar). However, a deficiency in either core protein 1 or 2 results in a drastic decrease in immunodetectable cytochrome b content, whereas mutants lacking cytochrome b have normal core protein contents. Since mRNA levels and expression of cytochrome b in pulse-label experiments are not affected by a core protein deficiency, it is thought that the decrease in the steady-state level of cytochrome b results from an increased susceptibility of cytochrome b to proteolytic degradation when the core proteins are absent (39Crivellone M.D. Wu M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14323-14333Google Scholar). We have shown that a modified core protein 2 can elicit the loss of core protein 1. The C-terminal extension created by the frameshift cor2-45 mutation, which contains many basic residues (Fig. 3), could block the proper folding of core 1, thus making this subunit sensitive to proteolytic degradation. If the core proteins bind to cytochrome b, as suggested by the loss of the cytochrome in core protein-deficient yeast strains, the restoration of core protein 1 by the revertant could simply be due to a conformational change in cytochrome b that strengthens its interaction with core protein 1 and thus protects against any deleterious interaction with the mutated core protein 2. More important, however, is that a single mutation, S223P, in one of its matrix-exposed connecting loops makes the cytochrome b resistant to a core protein 2 deficiency. In N. crassa and plant mitochondria, the core proteins of the cytochrome bc1 complex are proteolytically active (6Schulte U. Arretz M. Schneider H. Tropschug M. Wachter E. Neupert W. Weiss H. Nature. 1989; 339: 147-149Google Scholar, 7Braun H.-P. Emmermann M. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3219-3227Google Scholar). In yeast, the core proteins located in the cytochrome bc1 complex appear to be proteolytically inactive homologues of α-MPP and β-MPP (6Schulte U. Arretz M. Schneider H. Tropschug M. Wachter E. Neupert W. Weiss H. Nature. 1989; 339: 147-149Google Scholar, 12Braun H.-P. Schmitz U.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 171-174Google Scholar), which are localized in the matrix (14Jensen R.E. Yaffe M.P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3863-3871Google Scholar–16Witte C. Jensen R.E. Yaffe M.P. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1439-1447Google Scholar). From this relationship and the peripheral location of the core proteins at the matrix side of the bc1 complex, we speculate that the proteolytically inactive core proteins bind to the matrix-exposed loop of cytochrome b and thus protect it from proteolysis by a mitochondrial protease. The S223P mutation may render the matrix-exposed loop of the cytochrome intrinsically resistant to mitochondrial protease, thus obviating the requirement for the core proteins. Notably, the cytochromes b in N. crassa and plant mitochondria, in which the core proteins have been shown to be proteolytically active, and likewise those of most eukaryotic mitochondria except yeast, contain a proline at the position equivalent to serine 223 of yeast (35Degli Esposti M. De Vries S. Crimi M. Ghelli A. Patarnello T. Meyer A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 243-271Google Scholar). Furthermore, a single serine to proline mutation proximal to the MPP cleavage site in the presequence of the iron-sulfur protein of the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex blocks proteolysis by MPP. 3J. Nett and B. L. Trumpower, unpublished experiments. Given the complex evolutionary relationships between the core proteins and MPP and the genetic data presented in this study, it will be particularly interesting to see if, in yeast, the core proteins function to protect the cytochrome b against mitochondrial proteases. Further experiments to test this hypothesis are in progress. We are grateful to E. Petrochillo for stimulating and helpful discussions. The mutant CW30/45 was isolated by S. Robineau who kindly gave it to us for characterization."

In the accompanying paper (16Chauvin M.-F. Megnin-Chanet F. Martin G. Mispelter J. Baverel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4705-4716Google Scholar), we have conducted a study on glutamate metabolism in isolated rabbit kidney tubules. For the interpretation of the data obtained, we have constructed a mathematical model that is based on the incorporation of 13C and 14C into various metabolites and allows the calculation of reaction rates of gluconeogenesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the pathways of glutamate and glutamine synthesis and degradation occurring simultaneously in mammalian cells. This model, which is applicable to data obtained by 13C NMR, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and 14C counting, is described in the present paper. A general representation of glutamate metabolism is given in Fig. 1. This figure shows the main pathways of glutamate metabolism, as well as the main products accumulated during glutamate metabolism. Fig. 2 shows five metabolic cycles that are functioning simultaneously during glutamate metabolism. Oxaloacetate is the only metabolite common to three of these cycles that were referred to as a multicycle in a previous study (1Martin G. Chauvin M.-F. Dugelay S. Baverel G. J. Biol.

Glutamate is the metabolite common to the two other cycles that have been introduced to improve the model; these are (iv) the “Glu →αKG → Glu” cycle and (v) the “Glu → Gln → Glu” cycle. Fig. 3, derived from Fig. 2, allows the calculation of the total amount of oxaloacetate formed from glutamate during 1 h of incubation and, subsequently, the calculation of the amount of the different intermediates and end products formed from glutamate during the same incubation time. From these data, fluxes can be calculated since a flux through a given enzyme is taken as the formation of one product of the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme during 1 h of incubation. In our model, the calculation of the proportions of each metabolite converted into the next one(s) is based on the fates of individual carbons 3, 5, and 1 of the glutamate molecule together with the fate of the incorporated labeled CO2 which are represented in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, respectively.Fig. 5Metabolic fate of the CO2 carbon fixed during glutamate metabolism in rabbit kidney tubules. Based on the same principle as that used in Fig. 4, this figure shows the fate of unlabeled oxaloacetate and of oxaloacetate labeled on its carbon 1 or 4 because the CO2 carbon which is fixed by pyruvate carboxylase at each turn of the “Pyr → OAA → PEP → Pyr” cycle yields oxaloacetate labeled either on its carbon 1 or 4. Oxaloacetate carbons directly labeled from the CO2 carbon are represented in brackets. The arrows have the same meaning as those used in Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 6 shows the successive proportions allowing us to calculate the amount of labeled oxaloacetate formed from labeled glutamate. These proportions are related to the substrates and not to the products of the reactions. Let us call [CyMET]CzGlu the amount of the metabolite (MET) formed labeled on its carbon y (where 1 ≤ y ≤ 6) arising from glutamate labeled on its carbon z, where z is equal to 1, 3, or 5 because we used [1,2-13C]-, [1-14C]-, [3-13C]-, [5-13C]-, [1,5-14C]-, and [U-14C]glutamate as labeled substrates and also because it is assumed that the C-2 and C-3 of glutamate had the same metabolic fate as the C-5 and C-4, respectively. And let [CyMET]Glu+*CO2 be the amount of the metabolite (MET) labeled on its carbon y (where 1 ≤ y ≤ 6) arising from glutamate plus labeled CO2. Similarly, let [(Cy+Cy′)MET]CzGlu be the amount of the metabolite (MET) labeled on its carbon y plus the amount of the metabolite (MET) labeled on its carbon y′; let [(Cy,y′)MET]CzGlu be the amount of the metabolite (MET) labeled simultaneously on its carbons y and y′. Let [(Cy(MET1 + MET2)]CzGlu be the amount of the metabolite (MET1) labeled on its carbon y plus the amount of the metabolite (MET2) labeled on its carbon y. Let [MET]Glu be the total amount of the metabolite (MET) formed as a result of glutamate metabolism. When the amount of the metabolite accumulated is considered, a (˄) sign is added on the left side inside the brackets []. Let (Met1 ⇅ Met2) be the proportion of any metabolite resynthesized at each turn of the metabolic cycle that is identified by the two characteristic metabolites Met1 and Met2. For the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the simple notation (TCA⇅) is used. Let (Met1 ⇅ Met2 + Met3) be the proportion of any metabolite resynthesized at each turn of the metabolic cycle which is identified by the two characteristic metabolites Met1 and Met2 while a second metabolic cycle identified by Met2 and Met3 is performing an infinite number of turns. Let (Met1 → Met2) be the proportion of Met1 converted into Met2 by either one or a succession of enzymatic reactions but without any recycling. The corresponding proportion taking into account the recycling over an infinite number of turns of exclusively the “Glu →αKG → Glu” and “Glu → Gln → Glu” cycles is indicated by substituting the parentheses () by {}. Special symbols are used in the notations {vGlu → Met2} and {CitαKG → OAA} to stress the fact that only added glutamate and only citrate-derived α-ketoglutarate, respectively, are concerned. Let (AcCoA + OAA → Cit) be the proportion of acetyl-CoA related to glutamate metabolism that is condensed to oxaloacetate not related to glutamate metabolism to yield direct synthesis of citrate at each turn of the TCA cycle. Similarly, let (OAA + AcCoA → Cit) the proportion of oxaloacetate related to glutamate metabolism which is condensed to acetyl-CoA not related to glutamate metabolism to yield direct synthesis of citrate at each turn of the TCA cycle. Let [Met1 ň Met2] the flux of conversion of Met1 to Met2. The flux through an enzyme E can also be indicated by [E].

Fig. 1 shows the metabolic pathways involved in glutamate metabolism which include five main metabolic cycles as presented in Fig. 2. Let's consider individually each metabolic cycle; the recycling factor (RF) is taken as the proportion of any metabolite resynthesized after each complete turn of the cycle of interest. The corresponding recycling ratio (RR) is taken as the sum of the successive proportions of any metabolite resynthesized during an infinite number of cycle turns plus 1, the proportion of this metabolite present at the beginning of the first cycle turn: (RR)=∑n=0∞(RF)n=1/[1−(RF)](Eq. 1) A complete turn of the metabolic cycle is considered to have occurred as soon as the metabolite of interest of the cycle is resynthesized once. Fig. 2 shows the recycling factor of each metabolic cycle. (i)(Glu ⇅αKG) is the recycling factor of the “Glu →αKG → Glu” cycle;( Glu ↑↓αKG)=(Glu→αKG)⋅(αKG→Glu)(Eq. 2) where (Glu →αKG) is the proportion of added glutamate directly converted into α-ketoglutarate, and (αKG → Glu) is the proportion of α-ketoglutarate directly converted into glutamate.(ii)(Glu ⇅ Gln) is the recycling factor of the “Glu → Gln → Glu” cycle; (Glu ↑↓Gln)=(Glu→Gln)⋅(Gln→Glu)(Eq. 3) =(Glu→Gln)⋅1Gln→G^ln​ where (Glu → Gln) is the proportion of glutamate directly converted into glutamine and (Gln → Glu) and (Gln →˄Gln) are the proportions of glutamine converted into glutamate and glutamine accumulated, respectively.Fig. 1 shows that glutamate is either accumulated or con- verted into α-ketoglutarate or glutamine; therefore, the proportion of glutamate formed which accumulated (Glu →˄Glu) is defined by Glu→ ^Glu=1−(Glu→αKG)−(Glu→Gln)(Eq. 4) In the following equations, the proportion of glutamate and α-ketoglutarate molecules that are metabolized and then resynthesized through the successive operation of “Glu →αKG → Glu” and “Glu → Gln → Glu” cycles over a theoretically infinite number of turns are noted {Glu ⇅ αKG + Gln} and {αKG ⇅ Glu + Gln}, respectively.The resulting glutamate recycling through α-ketoglutarate and glutamine, is {Glu ↑↓ αKG + Gln} = ∑n=0∞[(Glu ↑↓ αKG) + (Glu ↑↓ Gln)]n= 1/[1−(Glu ↑↓ αKG)−(Glu ↑↓ Gln)](Eq. 5) (see also Fig. 2).One can demonstrate that {KG ⇅ Glu + Gln}, the resulting -ketoglutarate recycling through glutamate and glutamine, is: {αKG↑↓ G]u+Gln}=[1−(Glu↑↓ Gln)]/[1−(Glu↑↓αKG)− (Glu↑↓Aln)](Eq. 6) (see also Fig. 2).Therefore, from the latter equation and Equation 3, it follows that {αKG ↑↓ Glu + Gln} = [1−(Glu ↑↓ Gln)] ·{Glu ↑↓ αKG + Gln} = {Glu ↑↓ αKG + Gln}−{G∨lu→ Gln}+ {G∨lu → G∧ln}(Eq. 7) (see also Fig. 2) where {vGlu → Gln} and {vGlu →˄Gln} represent the proportion of added glutamate not recycled or recycled only in the “Glu →αKG → Glu” and “Glu → Gln → Glu” cycles which was converted in glutamine formed and glutamine accumulated, respectively.The parameters {vGlu → Gln} and {vGlu →˄Gln}, as defined above (see “Notations”), are equal to {Glu ⇅αKG + Gln} multiplied by (Glu → Gln) and (Glu →˄Gln), respectively.(iii)(Pyr ⇅ OAA) is the recycling factor of the “OAA → PEP → Pyr → OAA” cycle, i.e. the proportion of oxaloacetate resynthesized at each turn of this cycle. (Pyr ⇅ OAA) = (OAA → PEP)·;(PEP → Pyr)·;(Pyr → OAA) (see Fig. 2). Where (OAA → PEP), (PEP → Pyr), and (Pyr → OAA) are the proportions of oxaloacetate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate converted into phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, and oxaloacetate, respectively (see Fig. 2).(iv)(TCA ⇅) is the recycling factor of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, i.e. the proportion of oxaloacetate resynthesized at each turn of this cycle. The proportion of citrate converted into α-ketoglutarate, noted (Cit →αKG) is considered to be 1. (TCA↑↓)=(OAA→Cit)⋅{αCitKG→OAA}(Eq. 8) where (OAA → Cit) and {CitαKG → OAA} are the proportions of oxaloacetate converted into citrate and citrate-derived α-ketoglutarate converted into oxaloacetate, respectively (see Fig. 2).(v)(AcCoA ⇅ OAA) is the recycling factor of the “OAA → PEP → Pyr → AcCoA → Cit → OAA” cycle, i.e. the proportion of oxaloacetate resynthesized at each turn of this cycle (see Fig. 2). The proportion of acetyl-CoA yielding citrate, noted (AcCoA → Cit) is equal to 1. (AcCoA ↑↓ OAA) = (OAA→PEP)⋅(PEP→Pyr) ⋅ (Pyr→AcCoA)⋅{αCitKG→OAA}(Eq. 9) In the latter 2 equations (TCA ⇅) and (AcCoA ⇅ OAA) take into account the recycling of α-ketoglutarate through glutamate and glutamine since {CitαKG → OAA} = (αKG → OAA)·;{αKG ⇅ Glu + Gln} (see Fig. 2). The amount of glutamine formed directly from the substrate glutamate is given by X·;{vGlu → Gln}, where X is the amount of glutamate utilized and {vGlu → Gln} is the proportion of the substrate glutamate converted into glutamine. As already mentioned, this proportion takes into account glutamate recycling through α-ketoglutarate and glutamine. The corresponding amount of glutamine accumulated is given by X·;{vGlu →˄Gln} = X·;(Glu →˄Gln)·;{Glu ⇅αKG + Gln} where (Glu →˄Gln) = (Glu → Gln)·;(Gln →˄Gln) and (Gln →˄Gln) is the proportion of glutamine formed which accumulated (see also Equation 3). It can be seen in Fig. 4 that X·;{vGlu →˄Gln} is given by C5Gln accumulated from C5Glu: X·;{vGlu →˄Gln} = [˄C5Gln]C5Glu·;X·;{vGlu →˄Gln} is also equal to [˄C3Gln]C3Glu− [˄C2Gln]C3Glu (see Fig. 4). Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4 allow us to calculate the amount X·;{vGlu →αKG}·;(αKG → OAA) of glutamate-derived oxaloacetate: X·;{vGlu →αKG}·;(αKG → OAA) = [*CO2]C1Glu where {vGlu →αKG} is equal to (Glu →αKG)·;{Glu ⇅αKG + Gln}. [C2Glu]C3Glu/[C2Gln]C3Glu and [C1Glu]C5Glu/[C1Gln]C5Glu is equal to the ratio {vGlu →˄Glu}/{vGlu →˄Gln} which, after simplification by the factor {Glu ⇅αKG + Gln}, is also equal to (Glu →˄Glu)/(Glu →˄Gln) (see above, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Table I). From X·;{vGlu →˄Gln} and {vGlu →˄Glu}/{vGlu →˄Gln}, one can calculate X·;{vGlu →˄Glu}. Fig. 2 shows that the glutamate utilized (X) is either accumulated as glutamate, X·;{vGlu →˄Glu}, or glutamine, X·;{vGlu →˄Gln}, or converted into oxaloacetate, X·;{vGlu →αKG}·;(αKG → OAA), indicating that X = X·;{vGlu →˄Glu} + X·;{vGlu →˄Gln} + X·;{vGlu →αKG}·;(αKG → OAA). Therefore the following parameters can be calculated: {G∨lu→ G∧lu} = (αKG→ OAA) = X⋅{G∨lu→αKG}⋅(αKG→ OAA)/X(Eq. 10) allows us to calculate that [C1OAA]C5Glu = X{G∨lu → αKG} ⋅ (αKG → OAA) ⋅ ∑n=0∞([1 − (OAAi)] ⋅ (Pyr↑↓ OAA))n= X ⋅ {G∨lu → KG} ⋅ (αKG → OAA) ⋅ (1/2)/(1 − [1 − (OAAi)] ⋅ (Pyr ↑↓ OAA))(Eq. 11) where (OAAi) is the proportion of oxaloacetate inverted as a result of its equilibration with fumarate, a symmetrical molecule (see also Table I), and where, as mentioned above (Pyr ⇅ OAA) = (OAA → PEP)·;(PEP → Pyr)·;(Pyr → OAA) (see also Fig. 2 and Table I). [C1OAA]C5Glu = X⋅{G∨lu → αKG} ⋅ (αKG → OAA) /2+ (OAAi) ⋅ (Pyr↑↓ OAA)⋅[C1OAA]C5Glu=(1−[1-2⋅ (OAAi)] ⋅ (Pyr ↑↓ OAA))⋅[C1OAA]C5Glu =(Eq. 12) Then, [C4OAA]C5Glu = X·;{vGlu →αKG}·;(αKG → OAA)·;(1/2)·;(1 − [1 − 2·;(OAAi)]·;(Pyr ⇅ OAA))/(1 − [1 − (OAAi)]·;(Pyr ⇅ OAA)). And, [(C1+ C4)OAA]C5Glu = X·;{vGlu →αKG}·;(αKG → OAA)·;[1 + [(OAAi)/2]/(1 − [1 − (OAAi)]·;(Pyr ⇅ OAA))]. From Fig. 4 one can also deduce that [C1OAA]C3Glu = ([C2OAA]C3Glu⋅[(AcCoA↑↓ OAA)/2] + [C3OAA]C3Glu⋅[(TCA ↑↓)/2]) ⋅∑n=0∞[(1−(OAAi)⋅(Pyr ↑↓ OAA))n(Eq. 13) where, as mentioned in Equation 9 (AcCoA ⇅ OAA) = (OAA → PEP).(PEP → Pyr)·;(Pyr → AcCoA)·;{CitαKG → OAA} (see also Fig. 2 and Table I) and ([C2OAA]C3Glu·;[(AcCoA ⇅ OAA)/2] + [C3OAA]C3Glu·;[(TCA⇅)/2]) represents the C1OAA formed directly from the C-2 and C-3 of oxaloacetate. Fig. 6 shows that [(C2 + C3)OAA]C3Glu= X⋅{G∨lu→αKG}⋅ (αKG→ OAA)⋅∑n=0∞((Pyr ↑↓ OAA)) + [(TCA↑↓) + (AcCoA ↑↓ OAA]/2)n=X⋅{G∨lu→αKG}⋅ (αKG→ OAA)/(1−(Pyr ↑↓ OAA)) + [(TCA↑↓) + (AcCoA ↑↓ OAA)]/2)(Eq. 14) From Fig. 4, one can deduce that the C-3 of glutamate yields equal amounts of C-2 and C-3 of oxaloacetate, so that [(C2OAA]C3Glu−[C3OAA]C3Glu=X⋅G∨lu→αKG⋅ (αKG→ OAA)⋅(1/2)(1−(Pyr ↑↓ OAA)−[(TCA↑↓) + (AcCoA ↑↓ OAA)]/2)(Eq. 15) Using Equation 14, Equation 13 can be rewritten as C1OAAC3Glu=C2+C3OAAC3Glu⋅[(TCA↑))+(Accos↑OAA)]/4)/1−1−OAAi⋅(Pyr ↑↓ OAA)(Eq. 16) Then, C1OAAC3Glu =X⋅vGlu→αKG⋅(αKG→OAA)⋅(1/2)⋅([TCA↑↑)+(AcCoA↑OAA)]/2)/[(1−(Pyr↑OAA)−[(TCA↑)+(AccoA↑OAA)]/2)⋅1−1−OAAi⋅(Pyr 个 OAA)(Eq. 17) And, C4OAAC3Glu=(C2+C3OAAC3Glu×[(TCA)↑↓ +(AcCoA↑↓ OAA)]/4)+(OAAi) × (Pyr↑↓ OAA) × [C1OAA]C3Glu =(1-[1-2×(OAAi)] × (Pyr↑↓OAA)×[C1OAA]C3Glu=X×vGlu→αKG×(αKG→OAA)×(1/2)×([TCA↑↓)+(AcCoA↑↓OAA)]/2)/[(1-(Pyr↑↓OAA)-[(TCA↑↓)+(AccoA↑↓OAA)]1/2)×1-1-2×OAAi×(Pyr ↑↓ OAA)/1-1-OAAi×(Pyr ↑↓ OAA)(Eq. 18) And, [(C1+ C4)OAA]C3Glu =X⋅vGlu→αKG⋅(αKG→OAA)⋅[([TCA↑↓)+(AcCoA↑↓OAA)]/2)/[(1−(Pyr↑↓OAA)−[(TCA↑↓)+(AcCoA↑↓OAA)]/2)⋅[1+[(Pyr↑↓OAA)/2]/1−1−OAAi⋅(Pyr ↑↓ OAA)](Eq. 19) Therefore, C4OAAC3Glu/C4OAAC5Glu=([(TCA)↑↓ +(AcCoA↑↓ OAA)]/2)/1−1−2⋅OAAi⋅(Pyr ↑↓ OAA)−[(TCA)↑↓ +(AcCoA ↑↓ OAA)]/2)(Eq. 20) Let us call A the Latter Ratio, then one can deduce from Fig. 4 that C4OAAC3Glu/C4OAAC5Glu=C1Glx1C3Glu/C1GlxC5Glu=A(Eq. 21) and [CO2]C3Glu/*CO2C5Glu=C1Ala1C3Glu/C1AlaC5Glu=A(Eq. 22) From Fig. 4, one can deduce that [C3OAA]C3Glu/C1OAA]C5Glu = [C3Ala]C3Glu/[C1Ala]C5Glu = B(Eq. 23) where the value B of the latter 2 ratios can be calculated from Equations 11 and 15: B = [1 − (Pyr ⇅ OAA) + (OAAi)·;(Pyr ⇅ OAA)]/(1 − (Pyr ⇅ OAA) − [(TCA ⇅) + (AcCoA ⇅ OAA)]/2). Combining Equations 21 and 23, yields (A + 1)/(B − A − 1) = [1 − (Pyr ⇅ OAA)]/[(OAAi)·;(Pyr ⇅ OAA)]. Let C = [1 − (Pyr ⇅ OAA)]/[(OAAi)·;(Pyr ⇅ OAA)]. Let D = [C1Glx]C5Glu/[C1Ala]C5Glu From Fig. 4 and Equations 11 and 12, one can deduce that D = (1 − [1 − 2·;(OAAi)]·;(Pyr ⇅ OAA))·;[(OAA → Cit) − (TCA ⇅)]/[(OAA → PEP)·;(PEP → Pyr)·;(Pyr → Ala)]. Where (Pyr → Ala) is the proportion of pyruvate directly converted to alanine. From Fig. 5 it is also possible to calculate that [C4OAA]Glu+*CO2 = [OAA]Glu × [1 - [OAAi)] × (Pyr ↑↓ OAA)+(OAAi) × (Pyr ↑↓ OAA) × [C1OAA]Glu1+*CO2[C1OAA]Glu+*CO2 = [OAA]Glu × (OAAi) × (Pyr ↑↓ OAA)×∑n=0∞([1 - (OAAi)] × (Pyr ↑↓OAA)) =[OAA]Glu⋅ (OAAi) × (Pyr ↑↓ OAA)/1-[1 - (OAAi)]× (Pyr ↑↓ OAA))(Eq. 24) Combining the latter equation and Equation 24, we obtain [C4OAA]Glu+*CO2⋅ [OAA]Glu ⋅ [1 − [OAAi)] ⋅ (Pyr ↑↓ OAA)+((OAAi) ⋅ (Pyr ↑↓ OAA))2/(1−[1 − (OAAi)] ⋅ (Pyr ↑↓ OAA))](Eq. 25) Let us call E = [C1Glx]Glu +*CO2/[C1Ala]Glu +* CO2 where [C1Glx]Glu+*CO2= [C4OAA]Glu+*CO2⋅[(OAA → Cit)−(TCA↑↓)](Eq. 26) (see Fig. 5) and [C1Ala]Glu+*CO2= [C4OAA]Glu+*CO2⋅[(OAA → PEP) ⋅ (PEP → Pyr) ⋅ (Pyr→Ala)](Eq. 27) (see Fig. 5). Combining Equations 24 and 26, we obtain E=([1−(Pyr↑↓OAA)]/(OAAi)+2⋅(Pyr↑↓OAA)−1)⋅[(OAA→Cit)−(TCA↑↓)]/[(OAA→PEP) ⋅ (PEP→Pyr) ⋅ (Pyr→Ala)](Eq. 28) Let us call F = D/E F = (1−[1−2 ⋅ (OAAi)] ⋅ (Pyr↑↓OAA))/([1 −(Pyr → OAA)]/(OAAi)+ 2 ⋅ (Pyr↑↓OAA)−1) = (2 + C) ⋅ (OAAi)/(C ⋅ [1 − (OAAi)] + 1)(Eq. 29) Therefore, i = F·;(1 + C)/[2 + C·;(1 + F)]. Since C was defined as [1 − (Pyr ⇅ OAA)]/[(OAAi)·;(Pyr ⇅ OAA)] (see above), one can calculate that (Pyr ⇅ OAA) = 1/[1 + (OAAi) ·;C]. Let us call G = 1/A; then, G = [1 −(Pyr ↑↓ OAA)]/([(TCA) + (AcCoA↑↓OAA)]/2) − 1(Eq. 30) and [(TCA ↑↓)+(AcCoA↑↓OAA)] =2 ⋅ [1 — (Pyr ↑↓ OAA)]/(1 + G)(Eq. 31) From Fig. 6, it can be deduced that [(C2 + C3)OAA]C3Glu = X · { ∨Glu →·αKG} ·( ·αKG → OAA)/H(Eq. 32) where H = 1−( Pyr ↑↓ OAA)−[(TCA↑↓)+(AcCoA ↑↓ OAA)]/2(Eq. 33) And Fig. 4 shows that [(C2+C3)Lac]C3Glu=[(C2+ C3)OAA]C3Glu·(OAA→PEP) ·(PEP→Pyr) · (Pyr→Lac)(Eq. 34) where (Pyr → Lac) is the proportion of pyruvate directly converted to lactate. Combining Equations 32 and 34, it follows that (OAA → PEP) ·; (PEP → Pyr) ·; (Pyr → Lac) = [(C2+ C3)Lac]C3Glu·; H/[X ·; {vGlu →αKG} ·; (αKG → OAA)]. Similarly, (OAA → PEP) · (PEP → Pyr) · (Pyr → Ala) =[(C2 + C3)Ala]C3Glu·H/[X · {∨Glu →αKG} · (αKG → OAA)](Eq. 35) Then, [C2OAA]C3Glu and [C3OAA]C3Glu can be calculated: [C2OAA]C3Glu=[C2Ala]C3Glu/[(OAA → PEP) ⋅ (PEP → Pyr) ⋅ (Pyr → Ala)](Eq. 36) and similarly, [C3OAA]C3Glu= [C3Ala]C3Glu/[(OAA → PEP) ⋅ (PEP → Pyr) ⋅ (Pyr → Ala)](Eq. 37) Furthermore, [C2OAA]C3Glu and [C3OAA]C3Glu are theoretically identical (see Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). The proportion (OAA → Asp1) of oxaloacetate directly converted into aspartate is given by (OAA → Asp) = [C3Asp]C3Glu/[C3OAA]C3Glu (see Fig. 4). From the latter equation and Equation 37, it follows that (OAA → Asp) is equal to [C3Asp]C3Glu·;[(OAA → PEP)·;(PEP → Pyr)·;(Pyr → Ala)]/[C3Ala]C3Glu. Oxaloacetate is either converted into citrate or phosphoenolpyruvate or aspartate (see Fig. 4) with the proportion (OAA → Cit), (OAA → PEP) or (OAA → Asp), respectively. Therefore, it follows that (OAA → Cit) + (OAA → PEP) + (OAA → Asp) = 1 which yields (OAA → Cit) + (OAA → PEP) = [1 − (OAA → Asp)](Eq. 38) From Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, it can be deduced that [C4Glx]C3Glu/[C2Glx]C3Glu = (AcCoA ↑↓ OAA)/(TCA↑↓)= (OAA → PEP) ⋅ (PEP → Pyr) ⋅ (Pyr → AcCoA)/(OAA → Cit)(Eq. 39) Thus, (TCA ⇅) and (AcCoA ⇅ OAA) can be calculated from Equations 31 and 39: (TCA↑↓)=[(TCA↑↓)+(AcCoA↑↓OAA)]/[1+(AcCoA↑↓OAA)/(TCA↑↓)] and(AcCoA↑↓OAA)=[(TCA↑↓)+(AcCoA↑↓OAA)]−(TCA↑↓)(Eq. 40) Let us call J = [(C6+ C1+ C5+ C2)Glc1]C3Glu and L = [(C3+ C2)Ser1]C3Glu. Then J + L = (OAA → PEP)·;(PEP → 3PG)·;[(C2+ C3)OAA]C3Glu (see Fig. 4). Where (PEP → 3PG) is the proportion of phosphoenolpyruvate directly converted to 3-phosphoglycerate. From Equations 14 and 33, it follows that (OAA→PEP)·(PEP→3PG)=(J+L)·H/[X·{vGlu→αKG}·(αKG→OAA)](Eq. 41) From Eqs. 38 and 39, and knowing (AcCoA⇅OAA)/(TCA⇅) and [(OAA→Cit)+(OAA→PEP)],we obtain: [(AcCoA ↑↓ OAA)/(TCA↑↓)] · [1- (OAA→Asp)]=(OAA → PEP) · ((PEP → Pyr) · (Pyr → AcCoA)+(AcCoA ↑↓ OAA)/(TCA↑↓))(Eq. 42) Phosphoenolpyruvate is either converted into pyruvate or 3-phosphoglycerate to yield glucose and serine (see Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4) with the proportion (PEP → Pyr) or (PEP → 3PG), respectively. Therefore, (PEP → Pyr) + (PEP → 3PG) = 1 which yields: (OAA → PEP)=(OAA→ PEP) · (PEP→ Pyr)+(OAA → PEP)·(PEP→ 3PG)(Eq. 43) Pyruvate is either converted into oxaloacetate, lactate, alanine, or acetyl-CoA (see Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4) with the proportion (Pyr → OAA), (Pyr → Lac), (Pyr → Ala), or (Pyr → AcCoA), respectively. Therefore, (Pyr → OAA) + (Pyr → Lac) + (Pyr → Ala) + (Pyr → AcCoA) = 1(Eq. 44) Combining the latter equation and Equations 42 and 43, one can deduce that (OAA → PEP) = ((Pyr ↑↓OAA) +(OAA → PEP) · (PEP → Pyr) · (Pyr → Lac) +(OAA → PEP) · (PEP → Pyr) · (Pyr → Ala) +[(AcCoA ↑↓ OAA)/(TCA↑↓)] · [1 - (OAA → Asp)] +(OAA → PEP) · (PEP → 3PG))/(1 +[(AcCoA ↑↓ OAA)/(TCA ↑↓)])(Eq. 45) Where, as indicated above, (Pyr⇅OAA) = (OAA → PEP).(PEP → Pyr)·;(Pyr → OAA). Then (PEP → 3PG) = (OAA → PEP)·;(PEP → 3PG)/(OAA → PEP, and, since (PEP → Pyr) + (PEP → 3PG) = 1, (PEP → Pyr) = 1 − (PEP → 3PG). The parameter (OAA → Cit) can be calculated from Equation 38: (OAA → Cit) = [1 - (OAA → Asp) - (OAA → PEP)](Eq. 46) Since the recycling factor in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA⇅), which accounts also for α-ketoglutarate recycling through glutamate and glutamine, is equal to (OAA → Cit)·;{CitαKG → OAA} (see Equation 8), it can be calculated that {citαKG → OAA} = (TCA ↑↓)/(OAA → Cit).(Eq. 47) From Equation 7 and since as shown in Fig. 1 (Glu →αKG) + (Glu →˄Glu) + (Glu → Gln) = 1 (see Equation 4), it follows that {vGlu →αKG} + {vGlu → ∧Glu} +{vGlu → ∧Gln} = {αKG ↑↓ Glu + Gln}(Eq. 48) Thus, [{∨Glu → ∧Glu} + {∨Glu → ∧Gln}] = {αKG ↑↓ Glu + Gln} - {∨Glu →αKG}(Eq. 49) Then, multiplying the 2 members of the latter equation by (αKG → OAA) and rearranging, we obtain (αKG → OAA) = [{citαKG → OAA}- {∨Glu → αKG} · (αKG → OAA)]/[{∨Glu → ∧Glu}+{∨Glu → ∧Gln}](Eq. 50) Therefore, the α-ketoglutarate recycling through glutamate and glutamine {αKG ⇅ Glu + Gln} is equal to {αKG ⇅ Glu + Gln} = {CitαKG → OAA}/(αKG → OAA). Then, {˅Glu →αKG} can be calculated from Equations 10 and 50. Equation 39 yields (OAA → PEP)·;(PEP → Pyr)·;(Pyr → AcCoA) = [(AcCoA ⇅ OAA)/(TCA ⇅)]·;(OAA → Cit). The proportion (Pyr → AcCoA) of pyruvate converted into acetyl-CoA is given by (Pyr → AcCoA) = (OAA → PEP)·;(PEP → Pyr)·;(Pyr → AcCoA)/[(OAA → PEP)·;(PEP → Pyr)]. Similarly, the proportions (Pyr → Lac), (Pyr → Ala), and (Pyr → OAA) corresponding to the proportions of pyruvate transformed into lactate, alanine, and oxaloacetate, respectively, are obtained as follows. (Pyr → Lac) = (OAA → PEP)·;(PEP → Pyr)·;(Pyr → Lac)/(OAA → PEP)·;(PEP → Pyr); (Pyr → Ala) = (OAA → PEP)·;(PEP → Pyr)·;(Pyr → Ala)/(OAA → PEP)·;(PEP → Pyr); (Pyr → OAA) = (Pyr ⇅ OAA)/(OAA → PEP)·;(PEP → Pyr); where (Pyr ⇅ OAA) = (OAA → PEP)·;(PEP → Pyr)·;(Pyr → OAA). The proportion (3PG → Glc) of 3-phosphoglycerate which yields glucose is given by (3PG → Glc) = J/(J + L) (see also Fig. 4). It should be stressed that, in this study, we did not calculate enzyme activities. Our model allowed us to calculate only mean fluxes in relation to glutamate metabolism. In this model, as already mentioned, a flux through a given enzyme is taken as the formation of one product per g dry wt and per unit of time (1 h in this study) of the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme. It should be pointed out that oxaloacetate is the only metabolite common to three of the metabolic cycles involved in glutamate metabolism. Therefore, a key step in the calculations of enzymatic fluxes is the determination of the amount of the oxaloacetate molecules that have been formed in relation to glutamate metabolism (noted [OAA]Glu), these oxaloacetate molecules containing 1, 2, 3, 4, or 0 carbon atoms derived from glutamate. Fig. 3 gives a schematic representation providing the basic elements needed for such a determination. In the left panel of Fig. 3, which is derived from Fig. 2 (Pyr ⇅ OAA), (TCA ⇅) and (AcCoA ⇅ OAA) represent the oxaloacetate recycled in the “OAA → PEP → Pyr → OAA,” the tricarboxylic acid and the “OAA → PEP → Pyr → AcCoA → Cit → OAA” cycles, respectively (see Fig. 2 and Table I). It should be stressed that the proportions (TCA ⇅) and (AcCoA ⇅ OAA) take also into account the recycling in the “Glu →αKG → Glu” and “Glu → Gln → Glu” cycles. Let us call (AcCoA +OAA→ Cit) the proportion of the acetyl-CoA molecules derived from glutamate that have been condensed with oxaloacetate molecules of endogenous origin to give citrate. It is necessary to introduce this proportion (see Fig. 2) to calculate correctly the oxaloacetate formation from glutamate by avoiding to take into account twice the citrate molecules synthesized from an oxaloacetate and an acetyl-CoA molecules originating both from glutamate. The proportion (AcCoA +OAA→ Cit) also allows one to take into account the citrate molecules formed from an acetyl-CoA molecule derived from glutamate and an oxaloacetate molecule arising from endogenous"
https://openalex.org/W2058674156,"The pancreas-specific transcriptional enhancer of the rat elastase I gene was modified by substituting, in turn, each of its three individual constitutive elements with the <i>tetO</i> element, which confers regulation by exogenous tetracycline in the presence of the hybrid <i>tetO</i> binding transactivator (tTA). Whereas the unmodified enhancer was active in transfected acinar tumor cells, substitution of individual elements with the tet-responsive element abolished activity. The modified enhancers were reactivated in the presence of the tTA and, upon addition of tetracycline, were silenced. Thus, substitution of individual enhancer elements renders the enhancer responsive to regulation by tetracycline. Moreover, the tTA-activated levels were 2-8-fold greater than the unmodified enhancer. The acinar cell specificity of the unmodified enhancer was retained; none of the <i>tetO-</i>substituted enhancers were activated by tTA in a variety of nonacinar cell lines. These results show that a foreign and artificial transcriptional activator, tTA, can be incorporated into an enhancer to create a novel, efficient, and regulatable transcriptional control region whose cell specificity is retained."

To elucidate the roles of hydrogen bonds in the interaction site between the α and β subunits for subunit association, eight mutant α subunits at five hydrogen bonding residues (N104D, N104A, N108D, N108A, E134A, E135A, N157D, and N157A) were constructed, and the thermodynamic parameters of association with the β subunit were obtained using a titration calorimeter. The N104D and N104A mutations remarkably decreased the stimulation activities, the association constants, and the association enthalpies. Although the association constant and the stimulation activities of E134A were reduced in the absence of salt, the change in the association enthalpy was relatively small, and the addition of salt could repair its defects. The substitutions at positions 135 and 157 did not affect the stimulation activity and decreased the Gibbs energy of association corresponding to the defect in 1 mol of hydrogen bond. The present results suggest that the α subunit which has a mutation at position 104 cannot fold into an intact conformation upon complex formation, resulting in reduced stimulation activities.

https://openalex.org/W1975261392,"Previous reports have suggested that receptors for immunoglobulin G (IgG), FcγRs, directly activate a nonselective cation channel (Young, J. D.-E., Unkeless, J. C., Young, T. M., Mauro, A., and Cohn, Z. A. (1983) Nature 306, 186-189; Nelson, D. J., Jacobs, E. R., Tang, J. M., Zeller, J. M., and Bone, R. C. (1985) J. Clin. Invest. 76, 500-507). To investigate the mechanisms underlying membrane conductance changes following human high affinity (FcγRI) receptor activation, we have used the human monocytic cell line U937 and combined conventional whole cell patch-clamp recordings with single cell fura-2 Ca2+ measurements. Using a K+-free internal solution, antibody cross-linking of IgG-occupied FcγRI activated an inward current at negative potentials, whose amplitude and time course mirrored the concomitant rise in intracellular Ca2+. Current-voltage relationships, obtained under different ionic conditions, revealed a monovalent cation-selective conductance that, under physiological conditions, would result in Na+ influx. Noise analysis of current recordings indicated a single channel conductance of 18 picosiemens and a mean opening time of 4.5 ms. This current was also activated by rises in intracellular Ca2+ induced by ionomycin (3 μM) or thapsigargin (1 μM). Addition of the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid to the intracellular medium abolished any channel activation by ionomycin, FcγRI, or the low affinity receptor, FcγRII. These results demonstrate that FcγRI activation triggers a novel Ca2+-activated channel selective for monovalent cations and that neither FcγRI nor FcγRII can directly activate a channel. Previous reports have suggested that receptors for immunoglobulin G (IgG), FcγRs, directly activate a nonselective cation channel (Young, J. D.-E., Unkeless, J. C., Young, T.

Current-voltage relationships, obtained under different ionic conditions, revealed a monovalent cation-selective conductance that, under physiological conditions, would result in Na+ influx. Noise analysis of current recordings indicated a single channel conductance of 18 picosiemens and a mean opening time of 4.5 ms. This current was also activated by rises in intracellular Ca2+ induced by ionomycin (3 μM) or thapsigargin (1 μM). Addition of the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid to the intracellular medium abolished any channel activation by ionomycin, FcγRI, or the low affinity receptor, FcγRII. These results demonstrate that FcγRI activation triggers a novel Ca2+-activated channel selective for monovalent cations and that neither FcγRI nor FcγRII can directly activate a channel. Human receptors for the constant, or Fc, region of immunoglobulin G (IgG), 1The abbreviations used are: IgGimmunoglobulin GBAPTA1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acidNMDGNmethyl-D-glucamine[Ca2+]ifree cytosolic Ca2+ concentrationSsiemensCANCa2+-activated nonselective cation. FcγRs, play a central role in linking the cellular and humoral arms of the immune system and trigger a number of downstream events including endocytosis, phagocytosis, superoxide generation, and cytokine release (for reviews, see Refs. 1van de Winkel J.G.J. Capel P.J.A. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 215-221Google Scholar, 2Lin C.-T. Shen Z. Boros P. Unkeless J.C. J. Clin. Immunol. 1994; 14: 1-13Google Scholar, 3Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 553-560Google Scholar). Three closely related classes of FcγRs have been identified: a high affinity (FcγRI) and two low affinity (FcγRII and FcγRIII) forms, each of which has different tissue distribution, structure, and affinity for IgG (1van de Winkel J.G.J. Capel P.J.A. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 215-221Google Scholar). Both FcγRI and FcγRII are constitutively expressed on cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage including the human monocytic cell line U937, which has commonly been used as a model in which to study Fc receptor signaling (4Harris P. Ralph P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1985; 37: 407-422Google Scholar). FcγRI is a 72-kDa protein comprising three extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains of the C2 set, a single transmembrane-spanning region, and a short cytoplasmic tail with no known signaling motifs (5Allen J.M. Seed B. Science. 1989; 243: 378-381Google Scholar), whereas the 40-kDa class II receptor contains only two Ig-like extracellular domains and has a cytoplasmic region containing tyrosine kinase activation motifs (6Brooks D.G. Qiu W.Q. Luster A.D. Ravetch J.V. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 1369-1385Google Scholar). Signaling by both receptors is thought to involve mainly, although not exclusively, aggregation of tyrosine kinase activation motifs leading to recruitment and activation of a number of soluble tyrosine kinases and the subsequent initiation of various signaling pathways, for example phospholipase Cγ activation (7Liao F. Shin H.S. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3659-3663Google Scholar). immunoglobulin G 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid Nmethyl-D-glucamine free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration siemens Ca2+-activated nonselective cation. Several reports suggest that FcγRs could directly couple to and activate a nonselective cation channel. Indirect measurements of mouse macrophage membrane potential using [3H]tetraphenylphosphonium ion accumulation indicated that FcγR activation triggered an initial Na+-dependent depolarization followed by a prolonged hyperpolarization in part attributable to K+ efflux (8Young J.D.-E. Unkeless J.C. Kaback H.R. Cohn Z.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1357-1361Google Scholar). Subsequent recordings from planar lipid bilayers, into which FcγR-containing proteoliposomes (again from mouse macrophages) had been incorporated (9Young J.D.-E Unkeless J.C. Young T.M. Mauro A. Cohn Z.A. Nature. 1983; 306: 186-189Google Scholar), suggested that the receptor was tightly associated to and directly activating a nonselective cation channel. More recently, in studies using human macrophages, antibody cross-linking of FcγRs (10Nelson D.J. Jacobs E.R. Tang J.M. Zeller J.M. Bone R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 500-507Google Scholar) and Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis of opsonized particles (11Ince C. Coremans J.M.C.C. Ypey D.L. Leijh P.C.J. Verveen A.A. van Furth R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1873-1878Google Scholar) have been shown to trigger channel activation and inward currents. In this study we have combined conventional whole cell patch-clamp recording and single cell fura-2 Ca2+ measurements of U937 cells to examine the conductance changes following Fc receptor activation and to determine the mechanism of channel activation. Furthermore, we have investigated the possible functional consequences of channel activation using measurements of membrane potential and intracellular [Na+]. Preliminary results from this study have appeared in abstract form (12Floto R.A. Somasundaram B. Allen J.M. Mahaut-Smith M.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 487: 190Google Scholar). U937 cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C, 6.8% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in a standard external saline (see below). Ionomycin was obtained from Calbiochem; fura-2, SBFI-AM, Pluronic F-127 (all prepared as stocks in dimethyl sulfoxide), and Cs4BAPTA were from Molecular Probes, Inc. Monomeric polyclonal human IgG and FcγRII monoclonal antibody were from Serotec (U. K.), and all other reagents were from Sigma (U. K.). All experiments were carried out at room temperature (20-23°C). Whole cell patch-clamp experiments were carried out using an Axopatch 200A patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass tubing (Clark Electromedical Instruments) and had filled resistances of 2-3 megohms. Electronic compensation of capacitance currents and series resistances (which were between 10 and 30 megohms) was performed. Membrane currents during voltage ramps were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz using Axon Instruments hardware and pCLAMP6 software (Axon Instruments). Currents were also acquired continuously at 37 kHz (filtered at 5 kHz) by a VR-10B digital data recorder (Instrutech Corp.). Liquid junction potentials were measured by reference to a 3 M KCl bridge and correcting computations made. Cells were resuspended in standard external saline containing (in mM): 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose (pH 7.35, Tris). The internal solution contained (in mM): 150 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.35, Tris). To minimize the contribution of K+ currents, K+ was replaced internally by Cs+, externally by Na+, and 10 mM tetraethylammonium chloride was added externally. For low Cl− solutions, all Cl−, except that added with divalent salts, was replaced by either aspartate or gluconate. For solutions containing no monovalent cations, these were substituted by NMDG+. High Ca2+ external solution contained (in mM): 110 CaCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.35). Highly buffered internal solution contained (in mM): 80 cesium gluconate, 20 Cs4BAPTA, 5 NaCl, 0.2 Na2GTP. For simultaneous fura-2 fluorescence experiments, 0.1 K5 fura-2 was added to the patch solution. In nystatin-perforated patch experiments, the pipette contained (in mM): 100 KCl, 40 K2SO4, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.35, Tris). Cross-linking antibodies and ionomycin were applied from a nearby pipette (150 μm from the cell) using a pressure injection system (PLI-100, Medical Systems). To activate FcγRI, cells were first loaded, for 15 min, with polyclonal human IgG (10 μM). The addition of goat anti-human IgG antibody (0.2 mg/ml) was then used to cross-link and thus activate IgG-loaded FcγRI. Since FcγRI alone can bind monomeric IgG with significant affinity, this established cross-linking method only results in FcγRI activation (for review, see Ref. 13Unkeless J.C. Scigliano E. Freedman V.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 251-281Google Scholar). To activate FcγRII specifically, cells were preloaded with the mouse IgG1 anti-FcγRII monoclonal antibody, AT10 (10 μM) followed by subsequent addition of goat anti-mouse IgG1 antibody (0.2 mg/ml). Whole cell currents used for both nonstationary fluctuation analysis and spectral analysis were obtained at a holding potential of −28 mV with 140 mM sodium aspartate, K+-free external solution, and cesium aspartate internally. Recordings were filtered at 1 kHz (through an eight-pole Bessel filter) and acquired at 5 kHz. For fluctuation analysis, the mean current and its variance were calculated for 200-ms segments taken once or twice every second before, during, and after the addition of cross-linking antibody. Spectral analysis, using Origin (Microcal, MA) software, involved averaging the fast Fourier transform of 10 4,096-point segments taken during channel activation and subtracting the average fast Fourier transform of 10 taken before the addition of cross-linker. The subtracted power spectrum was fitted by a single Lorentzian function, S(f)=S(0)/1+f/fc2(Eq. 1) where S(0) is the zero frequency asymptote, and fc is the corner frequency. The total variance (V) was calculated from this background-corrected spectrum by the equation V=S(0)⋅π⋅fc/2(Eq. 2) Single cell fura-2 fluorescence measurements were made using a Cairn Spectrophotometer system. Excitation light passed through a spinning filter wheel assembly containing four 340 nm and two 380 nm bandpass excitation filters. Emitted light was selected by two (400-600 nm) dichroic filters and further filtered by a 485 nm long pass gelatin filter and a 600 nm dichroic mirror. The combined output from all 340 and 380 nm excitation filters provided a 340/380 nm ratio for each revolution of the filter wheel. The signal was then averaged to give a ratio value every 67 ms. Background and cell autofluorescence were subtracted from the signal to give fura-2 fluorescence. [Ca2+]i was calculated according to Grynkiewicz et al. (14Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar) using a Kd for fura-2 of 135 nM. In SBFI fluorescence experiments, cells were loaded by 45-min incubation at room temperature with 10 μM SBFI-AM mixed with an equal volume of 25% (w/v) Pluronic F-127. Aliquots of 106 cells were resuspended in 1.5 mM external saline (containing, in mM: 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES (pH 7.35, Tris) and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), placed in continuously stirred cuvettes attached to a Cairn Spectrophotometer system (as above). Signal calibration was achieved by resuspending aliquots in media containing different [Na+] prepared by appropriate mixing of high [Na+] solution (110 mM sodium gluconate, 30 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM Na-HEPES (pH 7.4)) with a similar solution in which K+ completely replaced Na+ (15Sage S.O. Rink T.J. Mahaut-Smith M.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 441: 559-573Google Scholar). [Na+]i was clamped by the addition of a mixture of ionophores (5 μM each, gramicidin, nigericin, and monensin (15Sage S.O. Rink T.J. Mahaut-Smith M.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 441: 559-573Google Scholar)), and the fluorescence ratios were calibrated as described by Harootunian et al. (16Harootunian A.T. Kao J.P.Y. Eckert B.K. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19458-19467Google Scholar). Under pseudophysiological ionic conditions of 145 mM NaCl externally and 150 mM KCl pipette solution, the addition of goat anti-human antibody to IgG-loaded cells held at −20 mV resulted in the generation of a large transient outward current (current density of 23.7 ± 5.6 pA/picofarad; n = 3). Voltage ramps from −80 to +60 mV applied every 9 s during the experiment (shown plotted against time in Fig. 1A) revealed the development of a current, entirely outward over this voltage range, which displayed a curvilinear current-voltage relationship. The current reached a peak approximately 60 s after the addition of cross-linking antibody and returned to resting levels after 2-3 min. Since the size and duration of this current mirrored the FcγRI-induced rise in [Ca2+]i, shown in Fig. 1B and reported previously in U937 cells (17Floto R.A. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Somasundaram B. Allen J.M. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 377-389Google Scholar), and this current could be abolished by substitution of internal K+ by Cs+ (data not shown), we concluded that it was due to the activation of calcium-activated K+ channels known to be present in many monocytic cell types (18Gallin E.K. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 775-811Google Scholar). Under conditions that minimized the contribution of both K+ and Cl− to whole cell current recordings (145 mM sodium aspartate, 10 mM tetraethylammonium chloride externally, and 150 mM cesium aspartate internally; see “Experimental Procedures”), the addition of goat anti-human IgG antibody generated a small inward current in 23/30 cells held at −40 mV (current density 1.148 ± 0.52 pA/picofarad, n = 12), which mirrored the concomitant rise in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1B). No current activation or Ca2+ rise was observed in cells not preloaded with polyclonal human IgG (n = 2, data not shown). Leak-subtracted current-voltage relationships obtained during and after current activation are shown in Fig. 1C and demonstrate the development of a linear (“ohmic”) conductance with an Erev (where Erev = a reversal potential), under these ionic conditions, of −16 mV. To determine whether this current was activated directly by FcγRI or required an increase in [Ca2+]i, 20 mM Cs4BAPTA was added to the pipette solution to buffer any [Ca2+]i rise. Under these conditions, the addition of goat anti-human antibody both failed to trigger a [Ca2+]i rise (Fig. 2A) and also prevented the activation of any whole cell current (n = 11), as shown by the leak-subtracted current-voltage curves (Fig. 2B). Under identical conditions, specifically cross-linking FcγRII using monoclonal antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”), again failed to activate a current (n = 9). In separate fluorescence experiments, specific FcγRII cross-linking was shown to trigger a [Ca2+]i rise in intact cells (data not shown). Leak-subtracted current-voltage relationships obtained 60 and 180 s following FcγRII cross-linking are shown in Fig. 2C. These results indicate that neither FcγRI nor FcγRII can directly activate a nonselective current in U937 cells. To confirm that a rise in [Ca2+]i was necessary and sufficient to activate a nonselective current, we examined the effect of a 10-s application of the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin (3 μM), to whole cell current recordings with Na+ aspartate externally and Cs+ aspartate internally. In 6/6 cells held at −40 mV, ionomycin activated an inward current (current density 2.53 ± 1.375 pA/picofarad). The leak-subtracted current-voltage curves, generated by voltage ramps applied every 5 s following the addition of ionomycin, are shown in Fig. 2D and demonstrate the development of a nonselective conductance that, at high levels of current activation, displays some inward rectification. Since these recordings were obtained in the presence of 5 mM KCl, one possibility was that this observed rectification was due to a small K+ influx through Ca2+-activated K+ channels which, despite the presence of internal Cs+ (blocking K+ efflux), would still be predicted under these conditions. This conclusion was supported by a similar experiment, carried out in the absence of any external K+ (Fig. 2E), where the activated current showed a linear (ohmic) current-voltage relationship in the voltage range −80 to +60 mV. An indication of the affinity of Ca2+ binding and the level of cooperativity involved in activation of this current was obtained by plotting the degree of current activation (under ionic conditions identical to those for Fig. 2E) as a percentage of maximum against [Ca2+]i, as determined by simultaneous fura-2 fluorescence measurements. The resultant plot (Fig. 2F) was fitted by a modified Hill equation y=1/1+Kd/Ca2+n(Eq. 3) with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 278 nM and a Hill coefficient (n) of 4.1 The ion selectivity of this Ca2+-activated conductance was investigated in a series of ionic substitution experiments (Fig. 3 A-C). Voltage ramps, applied throughout the experiments, were used to generate leak-subtracted current-voltage relationships of the FcγRI-induced current as described above. When external monovalent cations were substituted with the impermeant ion, NMDG+, an outward current developed in response to a 10-s addition of either cross-linking antibody (current n = 8; Fig. 3A) or 3 μM ionomycin (n = 12, data not shown). Substitution of both internal and external monovalent cations with NMDG+ in the presence of 5 mM Ca2+ externally resulted in no detectable conductance change (n = 6; Fig. 3B), suggesting a conductance permeable to monovalent cations and with little or no permeability to Ca2+. To define the level of permeability to divalents, 110 mM CaCl2 was used externally with NMDG+ aspartate internally. The addition of 3 μM ionomycin (n = 5; Fig. 3C) or cross-linking antibody (n = 3; data not shown) failed to generate any detectable inward current. Ionomycin also failed to activate a current when the external solution was changed to 110 mM BaCl2 (n = 4, data not shown), further indicating no significant permeability to divalent cations. The mean single channel conductance of this current was estimated by nonlinear fluctuation analysis. The variance and mean current were calculated for 200-ms segments taken once every 0.5 or 1 s during low levels of channel activation (Fig. 4A). The variance is shown in Fig. 4A, and the variance plotted against the mean current in Fig. 4B. Although the relationship of current variance with mean current over the entire range of opening probabilities is best described by a binomial distribution (19Katz B. Miledi R. Nature. 1970; 226: 962-963Google Scholar), at low levels of channel activity (i.e. when channel opening follows a Poisson distribution), it is approximately linear with a slope equal to the mean single channel current (19Katz B. Miledi R. Nature. 1970; 226: 962-963Google Scholar, 20Anderson C.R. Stevens C.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1973; 235: 655-691Google Scholar). A straight line, fitted to the data in Fig. 4C by linear regression), gave a single channel current of 218 fA. With a holding potential of −28 mV and a reversal potential under these ionic conditions, of −16 mV, this corresponded to a unitary conductance of 18 pS (n = 2). This may be an underestimate since this method is known to generate lower values than direct single channel recording (21Dart C. Standen N.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 471: 767-786Google Scholar). We went on to use spectral analysis to determine the mean channel opening time. The background corrected spectrum (Fig. 4C) was well fitted by a single Lorentzian function with a corner frequency of 35 Hz. This corresponded to a single open state with a mean opening time of 4.5 ms. The total variance calculated from this background-corrected spectrum (1.37 pA2) agreed well with the variance of the mean current, obtained by fluctuation analysis, in the same experiment (1.1 pA2), confirming that the power spectrum obtained was dominated by noise attributable to the nonselective cation channel. One expected consequence of activation of this monovalent-selective channel under physiological conditions will be to cause an influx of Na+. We examined the magnitude of changes in [Na+]i using population fluorescence recordings of cells loaded with the Na+ indicator, SBFI (Fig. 5A). Cross-linking FcγRI triggered a slow rise in [Na+]i reaching a peak of 18.7 ± 3.1 mM (n = 3) after approximately 4 min and returning to basal levels after 20-25 min. To assess whether this Na+ influx would result in a membrane depolarization, current-clamp recordings were made under nystatin whole cell configuration. Fig. 5B shows a typical experiment. Resting membrane potentials of −21.0 ± 8.29 mV (n = 7) were recorded. These values compare with previous measurements in monocytes and macrophages of between −15 and −56 mV (10; for review, see Ref. 18Gallin E.K. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 775-811Google Scholar). Following a short delay, the addition of cross-linking antibody resulted in membrane hyperpolarization to −64.7 ± 6.07 mV (n = 7) lasting 2-3 min. The present study demonstrates that FcγRI cross-linking triggers a Ca2+-activated cation channel, highly selective for monovalent over divalent ions, with a unitary conductance of 18 pS. In addition, we have shown that neither the high affinity (FcγRI) nor low affinity (FcγRII) forms of the IgG receptor can directly activate a nonselective cation channel in U937 cells. There have been numerous reports of various types of Ca2+-activated nonselective cation (CAN) channels in a wide variety of cells types (for review, see Ref. 22Partridge L.D. Swandulla D. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 69-72Google Scholar). These channels show considerable variation in unitary conductance (18-45 pS), mean opening time (0.5-930 ms), and Ca2+ sensitivity for activation (50 nM-1 mM). In addition, there seems to be a division between CAN channels showing some permeability to divalent as well as monovalent cations and those that show no detectable permeability to Ca2+ (22Partridge L.D. Swandulla D. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 69-72Google Scholar). Thus the Ca2+-activated channel found in U937 cells appears to belong to this last group. A Ca2+-activated channel with similar selectivity for monovalents and single channel conductance (22 pS) has been reported in neuroblastoma cells (23Yellen G. Nature. 1982; 296: 357-359Google Scholar); however, the Ca2+ sensitivity for activation (Kd of 1 μM) and mean single channel opening time (50-200 ms) vary considerably from those observed for the channel in U937 cells (Kd for Ca2+ activation: 278 nM; mean opening time: 4.5 ms). The properties of the Ca2+-activated monovalent cation channel in U937 cells are similar to those of Fc receptor-operated cation channels reported by other groups. The direct Fc receptor-operated channel reported from lipid bilayer studies (9Young J.D.-E Unkeless J.C. Young T.M. Mauro A. Cohn Z.A. Nature. 1983; 306: 186-189Google Scholar) has similar ionic selectivity (low Ca2+ permeability) and a slightly larger single channel conductance (50 pS). In single cell studies where Fc receptor cross-linking, by antibody (10Nelson D.J. Jacobs E.R. Tang J.M. Zeller J.M. Bone R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 500-507Google Scholar) or opsonized particle (11Ince C. Coremans J.M.C.C. Ypey D.L. Leijh P.C.J. Verveen A.A. van Furth R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1873-1878Google Scholar), has been shown to trigger a current attributable to Na+ influx, intracellular Ca2+ changes were not monitored or prevented. This raises the possibility that channel activation was via a rise in [Ca2+]i and not directly receptor-triggered. Inside-out patch recordings from mouse macrophages, excised after FcγR-evoked channel activity had been observed in a cell-attached configuration (24Lipton S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 856: 59-67Google Scholar), showed the presence of a nonselective cation channel with a 35-45-pS single channel conductance whose opening could be modulated by [Ca2+]i. Neither Ca2+ activation in the absence of receptor cross-linking nor Ca2+ permeability was assessed; however, it seems likely that this channel is similar to the one reported in this study. Whole cell current recordings indicated that activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels was the dominant ionic conductance change following FcγRI stimulation of U937 cells under pseudophysiological conditions (see Fig. 1A). This accounts for the prolonged hyperpolarization of more than 45 mV observed in current-clamp recordings of membrane potential (Fig. 5B). The lack of observable depolarization can be explained by both the opposing action of K+ current through Ca2+-activated K+ channels and the fact that the resting potential (−21 mV) is very close to the reversal potential for this Ca2+-activated cation channel (−16 mV). Differences in resting potentials and variations in the relative density and/or differences in Ca2+-binding affinities of CAN and Ca2+-activated K+ channels may explain the initial depolarization and subsequent hyperpolarization observed in mouse macrophages (8Young J.D.-E. Unkeless J.C. Kaback H.R. Cohn Z.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1357-1361Google Scholar) and the transient outward current followed by a sustained inward current reported in human alveolar macrophages (10Nelson D.J. Jacobs E.R. Tang J.M. Zeller J.M. Bone R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 500-507Google Scholar) following FcγR activation. Indeed, earlier microelectrode studies reporting action potentials in human monocyte-derived macrophages (25McCann F.V. Cole J.J. Guyre P.M. Russell J.A.G. Science. 1983; 219: 991-993Google Scholar) may also be explained along similar lines. The possible physiological role for this CAN channel remains unclear. One predicted consequence of channel activation would be to cause a Na+ influx that would be enhanced under conditions of membrane hyperpolarization. Fluorescence measurements of SBFI-loaded U937 cells (Fig. 5A) revealed an FcγR-triggered [Na+]i rise of 10-20 mM. The contribution of CAN channel activation to this [Na+]i can be estimated by integration of FcγRI-evoked currents generated under the ionic conditions in Fig. 1B and scaled to holding potentials of −75 mV. This is the potential observed in current-clamp experiments following cross-linking antibody addition (Fig. 5B). Using this method, the total Na+ influx through CAN channels following FcγRI activation was obtained and provided an estimated [Na+]i increase, for an 8-μm cell, of 31.6 ± 3.3 mM. This value is considerably greater than peak Na+ concentrations obtained by SBFI fluorescence measurements (18.7 mM) and indicates that the CAN channel can account for most of the observed Na+ influx. However, it also suggests that some Na+ efflux must take place. Further studies will be required to assess the contributions of other influx pathways, such as Na+/Ca2+ or Na+/H+ exchangers, to this [Na+]i rise. Increases in [Na+]i have been reported to alter cytosolic pH (26Grinstein S. Furuya W. Biggar W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 512-514Google Scholar) and osmolarity (27Haussinger D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 697-710Google Scholar) required for cytoskeletal rearrangement in a variety of cell types, modulate G protein receptor coupling (28Gierschik P. Bouillon T. Jakobs K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 13-26Google Scholar), and alter K+ channel activity (29Marty A. Pflüegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1983; 396: 179-181Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that one or more downstream events initiated by FcγR activation may require or be modulated by rises in [Na+]i. In conclusion, we have shown that in U937 cells, Fc receptor aggregation does not activate a conductance directly but triggers a Ca2+-activated cation channel, selective for monovalents, which contributes to FcγR-mediated Na+ influx.
