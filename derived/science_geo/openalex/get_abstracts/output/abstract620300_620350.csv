https://openalex.org/W2895844696,"Virtual Reality (VR) has been increasingly referred to as the ""ultimate empathy machine"" since it allows users to experience any situation from any point of view. However, empirical evidence supporting the claim that VR is a more effective method of eliciting empathy than traditional perspective-taking is limited. Two experiments were conducted in order to compare the short and long-term effects of a traditional perspective-taking task and a VR perspective-taking task (Study 1), and to explore the role of technological immersion when it comes to different types of mediated perspective-taking tasks (Study 2). Results of Study 1 show that over the course of eight weeks participants in both conditions reported feeling empathetic and connected to the homeless at similar rates, however, participants who became homeless in VR had more positive, longer-lasting attitudes toward the homeless and signed a petition supporting the homeless at a significantly higher rate than participants who performed a traditional perspective-taking task. Study 2 compared three different types of perspective-taking tasks with different levels of immersion (traditional vs. desktop computer vs. VR) and a control condition (where participants received fact-driven information about the homeless). Results show that participants who performed any type of perspective-taking task reported feeling more empathetic and connected to the homeless than the participants who only received information. Replicating the results from Study 1, there was no difference in self-report measures for any of the perspective-taking conditions, however, a significantly higher number of participants in the VR condition signed a petition supporting affordable housing for the homeless compared to the traditional and less immersive conditions. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings."

https://openalex.org/W2895794785,"Fatty acid synthase (FASN) predominantly generates straight-chain fatty acids using acetyl-CoA as the initiating substrate. However, monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids (mmBCFAs) are also present in mammals but are thought to be primarily diet derived. Here we demonstrate that mmBCFAs are de novo synthesized via mitochondrial BCAA catabolism, exported to the cytosol by adipose-specific expression of carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT), and elongated by FASN. Brown fat exhibits the highest BCAA catabolic and mmBCFA synthesis fluxes, whereas these lipids are largely absent from liver and brain. mmBCFA synthesis is also sustained in the absence of microbiota. We identify hypoxia as a potent suppressor of BCAA catabolism that decreases mmBCFA synthesis in obese adipose tissue, such that mmBCFAs are significantly decreased in obese animals. These results identify adipose tissue mmBCFA synthesis as a novel link between BCAA metabolism and lipogenesis, highlighting roles for CrAT and FASN promiscuity influencing acyl-chain diversity in the lipidome. mmBCFAs are endogenous fatty acids synthesized from BCAAs by brown and white adipose tissue via CrAT and FASN promiscuity. BCAA catabolism and mmBCFA lipogenesis are decreased by obesity-induced adipose hypoxia and influenced by the microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W2897059447,"Salmeterol is a partial agonist for the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) and the first long-acting β2AR agonist to be widely used clinically for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Salmeterol’s safety and mechanism of action have both been controversial. To understand its unusual pharmacological action and partial agonism, we obtained the crystal structure of salmeterol-bound β2AR in complex with an active-state-stabilizing nanobody. The structure reveals the location of the salmeterol exosite, where sequence differences between β1AR and β2AR explain the high receptor-subtype selectivity. A structural comparison with the β2AR bound to the full agonist epinephrine reveals differences in the hydrogen-bond network involving residues Ser2045.43 and Asn2936.55. Mutagenesis and biophysical studies suggested that these interactions lead to a distinct active-state conformation that is responsible for the partial efficacy of G-protein activation and the limited β-arrestin recruitment for salmeterol. The active-state structure of a GPCR occupied by a partial agonist, β2AR with salmeterol, together with mutagenesis and biophysical studies, explains this ligand's unusual pharmacological profile."
https://openalex.org/W2897110091,"α-Synuclein (αsyn) aggregates into toxic fibrils in multiple neurodegenerative diseases where these fibrils form characteristic pathological inclusions such as Lewy bodies (LBs). The mechanisms initiating αsyn aggregation into fibrils are unclear, but ubiquitous post-translational modifications of αsyn present in LBs may play a role. Specific C-terminally (C)-truncated forms of αsyn are present within human pathological inclusions and form under physiological conditions likely in lysosome-associated pathways, but the roles for these C-truncated forms of αsyn in inclusion formation and disease are not well understood. Herein, we characterized the in vitro aggregation properties, amyloid fibril structures, and ability to induce full-length (FL) αsyn aggregation through prion-like mechanisms for eight of the most common physiological C-truncated forms of αsyn (1–115, 1–119, 1–122, 1–124, 1–125, 1–129, 1–133, and 1–135). In vitro, C-truncated αsyn aggregated more readily than FL αsyn and formed fibrils with unique morphologies. The presence of C-truncated αsyn potentiated aggregation of FL αsyn in vitro through co-polymerization. Specific C-truncated forms of αsyn in cells also exacerbated seeded aggregation of αsyn. Furthermore, in primary neuronal cultures, co-polymers of C-truncated and FL αsyn were potent prion-like seeds, but polymers composed solely of the C-truncated protein were not. These experiments indicated that specific physiological C-truncated forms of αsyn have distinct aggregation properties, including the ability to modulate the prion-like aggregation and seeding activity of FL αsyn. Proteolytic formation of these C-truncated species may have an important role in both the initiation of αsyn pathological inclusions and further progression of disease with strain-like properties. α-Synuclein (αsyn) aggregates into toxic fibrils in multiple neurodegenerative diseases where these fibrils form characteristic pathological inclusions such as Lewy bodies (LBs).

Truncated forms of αsyn are elevated in PD and LBD, but only limited studies have gone beyond this association and explored mechanistic implications for disease. Overexpression of some C-truncated forms of αsyn in cell culture, in Drosophila, and in murine models mainly under the rat TH promoter has demonstrated that these truncations tend to be more toxic than the FL protein, and the mouse models have displayed motor symptoms, filamentous neuronal inclusion formations, and dopaminergic dysfunction (34Zhang Z.

We evaluated the role of Ezh2 in chondrocyte lineage differentiation and endochondral ossification. Ezh2 was genetically inactivated in the mesenchymal, osteoblastic, and chondrocytic lineages in mice using the Prrx1-Cre, Osx1-Cre, and Col2a1-Cre drivers, respectively. WT and conditional knockout mice were phenotypically assessed by gross morphology, histology, and micro-CT imaging. Ezh2-deficient chondrocytes in micromass culture models were evaluated using RNA-Seq, histologic evaluation, and Western blotting. Aged mice with Ezh2 deficiency were also evaluated for premature development of osteoarthritis using radiographic analysis. Ezh2 deficiency in murine chondrocytes reduced bone density at 4 weeks of age but caused no other gross developmental effects. Knockdown of Ezh2 in chondrocyte micromass cultures resulted in a global reduction in trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and altered differentiation in vitro RNA-Seq analysis revealed enrichment of an osteogenic gene expression profile in Ezh2-deficient chondrocytes. Joint development proceeded normally in the absence of Ezh2 in chondrocytes without inducing excessive hypertrophy or premature osteoarthritis in vivo In summary, loss of Ezh2 reduced H3K27me3 levels, increased the expression of osteogenic genes in chondrocytes, and resulted in a transient post-natal bone phenotype. Remarkably, Ezh2 activity is dispensable for normal chondrocyte maturation and endochondral ossification in vivo, even though it appears to have a critical role during early stages of mesenchymal lineage commitment."
https://openalex.org/W2896143972,"The GalNAc-type O-glycoproteome is orchestrated by a large family of polypeptide GalNAc-transferase isoenzymes (GalNAc-Ts) with partially overlapping contributions to the O-glycoproteome besides distinct nonredundant functions. Increasing evidence indicates that individual GalNAc-Ts co-regulate and fine-tune specific protein functions in health and disease, and deficiencies in individual GALNT genes underlie congenital diseases with distinct phenotypes. Studies of GalNAc-T specificities have mainly been performed with in vitro enzyme assays using short peptide substrates, but recently quantitative differential O-glycoproteomics of isogenic cells with and without GALNT genes has enabled a more unbiased exploration of the nonredundant contributions of individual GalNAc-Ts. Both approaches suggest that fairly small subsets of O-glycosites are nonredundantly regulated by specific GalNAc-Ts, but how these isoenzymes orchestrate regulation among competing redundant substrates is unclear. To explore this, here we developed isogenic cell model systems with Tet-On inducible expression of two GalNAc-T genes, GALNT2 and GALNT11, in a knockout background in HEK293 cells. Using quantitative O-glycoproteomics with tandem-mass-tag (TMT) labeling, we found that isoform-specific glycosites are glycosylated in a dose-dependent manner and that induction of GalNAc-T2 or -T11 produces discrete glycosylation effects without affecting the major part of the O-glycoproteome.

Perhaps surprisingly, this latter approach has indicated that the nonredundant contributions of GalNAc-T isoenzymes to the O-glycoproteome appear to be minor, and the majority of O-glycosites are redundantly glycosylated among the isoforms present in a cell (22Schjoldager K.T.

Moreover, it appears that most human glycosyltransferase genes identified as GWAS candidates have diagnostic nucleotide variants positioned within intronic regions (32Joshi H.J. Hansen L.

Glycosyltransferase genes that cause monogenic congenital disorders of glycosylation are distinct from glycosyltransferase genes associated with complex diseases.Glycobiology. 2018; 28 (29579191): 284-29410.1093/glycob/cwy015Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and thus may also represent gene variants with altered regulation. Surveying the degrees of potential transcriptional regulation of glycosyltransferase genes by reported RNA-Seq transcriptome data indicated indeed that genes with predicted high transcriptional regulation were overrepresented among GWAS candidate genes (32Joshi H.J. Hansen L. Narimatsu Y. Freeze H.H. Henrissat B. Bennett E. Wandall H.H. Clausen H. Schjoldager K.T.

These findings pose a fundamental question. What is the need for fine-tuned regulation of the glycosylation process, and how may this regulation be achieved? The glycosylation process involves a large number of glycosyltransferases that act sequentially and competitively on diverse substrates, and the kinetic properties, substrate availabilities, and subcellular topologies of these enzymes direct the glycosylation outcome (19Wandall H.H. Hassan H. Mirgorodskaya E. Kristensen A.K. Roepstorff P. Bennett E.P. Nielsen P.A. Hollingsworth M.A. Burchell J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Clausen H.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111 (9394011): 45-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, many glycosyltransferases appear to be supersaturated in cells because, for example, proficient glycosylation can be achieved for recombinant glycoproteins over a wide range of expression levels (39Walsh G. Post-translational modifications of protein biopharmaceuticals.Drug Discov. Today. 2010; 15 (20599624): 773-78010.1016/j.drudis.2010.06.009Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Moreover, glycosyltransferase isoenzymes have overlapping redundant functions that may affect regulation of specific functions. The latter is particularly apparent for the large group of GalNAc-T isoenzymes that have a plethora of possible peptide/protein substrates and a high likelihood for redundant activity toward these, but presumably with great variation in kinetic properties. It is therefore of considerable interest to probe the effects of regulating such enzymes. In this study, we developed isogenic human embryonic kidney HEK293 (HEK) cell lines with inducible expression of GalNAc-T2 or -T11. Two isoenzymes endogenously expressed in these cells and kidney. We constructed isogenic HEK cell lines with KO of GALNT2 or GALNT11 and by KI installed corresponding doxycycline-inducible expression cassettes with the coding region of GALNT2 or GALNT11. We applied a quantitative differential O-glycoproteomics approach to probe effects of gradual induction, up to and beyond the normal endogenous levels of the enzymes, and found impressive selective and gradual induction of glycosylation of specific nonredundant substrates for each isoenzyme in an isoform-specific and dose-dependent manner. The study clearly demonstrates that regulation of glycosyltransferase isoenzymes can fine-tune glycosylation and the functions exerted on proteins. HEK cells express a subset of the 20 GALNT genes with the major isoenzymes expressed being GALNT1 and -T2; with lower levels of GALNT3, -T7, -T11, and -T18; and with barely detectable levels of GALNT6 and -T16 (Fig. S1). HEK cells produce mainly sialylated core 1 O-glycans with a minor amount of core 2 structures (40Fujitani N. Furukawa J. Araki K. Fujioka T. Takegawa Y. Piao J. Nishioka T. Tamura T. Nikaido T.

https://openalex.org/W2896965902,"Background Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) have been associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Our objective was to quantify the association between PPI use and incident CKD in a population-based cohort. Methods and findings We used a population-based retrospective cohort, including people aged 15 years or over, between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2012. PPI use was measured in a follow-up session by recording prescriptions. Incident CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/ min/1.73 m2 and/or urinary albumin level to creatinine level ≥ 30 mg/g, in two or more determinations over a period of at least 3 months of the follow-up. Proton Pump Inhibitor use was associated with incident CKD in analysis adjusted for different clinical variables (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.18; 95% CI 1.04–1.51) in individuals who used PPI in the basal visit (HR 1.37; 95% CI 1.25–1.50) and in those who started to use PPI during the follow-up. High doses of PPI increased the risk of incident CKD (HR 1.92; 95%CI 1.00–6.19) for any type of exposure to PPIs (HR 2.40; 95%CI 1.65–3.46) and for individuals who used high doses throughout the follow-up. This risk of incident CKD increased after three months’ exposure to PPIs, (HR1.78; 95% CI 1.39–2.25) between the third and sixth months and (HR 1.30; 95%CI 1.07–1.72) after the sixth month. Conclusions PPI use is associated with a higher risk of incident CKD. This association is greater for high doses and becomes apparent after three months’ exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2896167783,"Earth’s rising temperature has substantial repercussions for food-producing animals by increasing morbidity and mortality, diminishing reproductive potential, and reducing productivity. In the dairy industry this equates to massive losses in milk yield, which occur when cows are exposed to heat stress during lactation or during the non-lactating period between lactations (i.e. dry period). Furthermore, milk yield is significantly lower in first-lactation heifers that experienced fetal heat stress. The mechanisms underlying intrauterine effects of heat stress on the offspring’s future lactation have yet to be fully elucidated. We hypothesize that heat stress experienced through the intrauterine environment will alter the mammary gland microstructure and cellular processes involved in cell turnover during the cow’s first lactation. Mammary biopsies were collected from first-lactation heifers that were exposed to heat stress or cooling conditions while developing in utero (IUHT and IUCL; respectively, n = 9–10). IUHT heifers produced less milk compared to IUCL. The mammary glands of IUHT heifers differed morphologically from IUCL, with the IUHT heifers having smaller alveoli and a greater proportion of connective tissue relative to their IUCL herdmates. However, intrauterine heat stress had little impact on the proliferation and apoptosis of mammary cells during lactation. Our results indicate that fetal exposure to heat stress impairs milk production in the first lactation, in part, by inducing aberrant mammary morphology. This may result from alterations in the developmental trajectory of the fetal mammary gland that persist through the first lactation rather than to alterations in the cellular processes controlling mammary cell turnover during lactation."
https://openalex.org/W2897353298,"Homogalacturonan (HG) is a pectic glycan in the plant cell wall that contributes to plant growth and development and cell wall structure and function, and interacts with other glycans and proteoglycans in the wall. HG is synthesized by the galacturonosyltransferase (GAUT) gene family. Two members of this family, GAUT1 and GAUT7, form a heteromeric enzyme complex in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we established a heterologous GAUT expression system in HEK293 cells and show that co-expression of recombinant GAUT1 with GAUT7 results in the production of a soluble GAUT1:GAUT7 complex that catalyzes elongation of HG products in vitro. The reaction rates, progress curves, and product distributions exhibited major differences dependent upon small changes in the degree of polymerization (DP) of the oligosaccharide acceptor. GAUT1:GAUT7 displayed >45-fold increased catalytic efficiency with DP11 acceptors relative to DP7 acceptors. Although GAUT1:GAUT7 synthesized high-molecular-weight polymeric HG (>100 kDa) in a substrate concentration–dependent manner typical of distributive (nonprocessive) glycosyltransferases with DP11 acceptors, reactions primed with short-chain acceptors resulted in a bimodal product distribution of glycan products that has previously been reported as evidence for a processive model of GT elongation. As an alternative to the processive glycosyltransfer model, a two-phase distributive elongation model is proposed in which a slow phase, which includes the de novo initiation of HG and elongation of short-chain acceptors, is distinguished from a phase of rapid elongation of intermediate- and long-chain acceptors. Upon reaching a critical chain length of DP11, GAUT1:GAUT7 elongates HG to high-molecular-weight products.

Although GAUT1:GAUT7 synthesized high-molecular-weight polymeric HG (>100 kDa) in a substrate concentration–dependent manner typical of distributive (nonprocessive) glycosyltransferases with DP11 acceptors, reactions primed with short-chain acceptors resulted in a bimodal product distribution of glycan products that has previously been reported as evidence for a processive model of GT elongation. As an alternative to the processive glycosyltransfer model, a two-phase distributive elongation model is proposed in which a slow phase, which includes the de novo initiation of HG and elongation of short-chain acceptors, is distinguished from a phase of rapid elongation of intermediate- and long-chain acceptors. Upon reaching a critical chain length of DP11, GAUT1:GAUT7 elongates HG to high-molecular-weight products.

Our current understanding of pectin synthesis and structure, however, is insufficient to explain its diverse functions in the plant or how reductions to pectin synthesis correlate with phenotypes such as increased plant growth and reduced recalcitrance to deconstruction. The first gene identified encoding an HG biosynthetic enzyme was galacturonosyltransferase 1 (GAUT1), a CAZy (13Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. The carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy) in 2013.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24270786): D490-D49510.1093/nar/gkt1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (4136) Google Scholar) family 8 glycosyltransferase (GT). The in vitro synthesis of HG or homogalacturonan:galacturonosyltransferase (HG:GalAT) activity was mapped to GAUT1 following MS sequencing of Arabidopsis thaliana solubilized membrane proteins (1Atmodjo M.A. Hao Z. Mohnen D. Evolving views of pectin biosynthesis.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2013; 64 (23451775): 747-77910.1146/annurev-arplant-042811-105534Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 14Sterling J.D.

Subsequent co-immunoprecipitation, MS sequencing, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation revealed that GAUT1 functions as a disulfide-linked heterocomplex with the homologous protein, GAUT7 (15Atmodjo M.A. Sakuragi Y.

In vivo, GAUT1 is truncated at its N terminus by 167 residues and requires GAUT7 for localization in the Golgi (15Atmodjo M.A. Sakuragi Y. Zhu X. Burrell A.J. Mohanty S.S. Atwood 3rd, J.A. Orlando R.

Based on these results, GAUT7 was proposed to be a noncatalytic membrane anchor for GAUT1 (14Sterling J.D. Atmodjo M.A. Inwood S.E. Kumar Kolli V.S. Quigley H.F. Hahn M.G. Mohnen D.

A more detailed study of the function of the GAUT1:GAUT7 complex and the mechanism of HG synthesis required the establishment of a recombinant protein expression system that could co-express GAUT1 and GAUT7 and properly post-translationally fold and process the active GT complex. Progress in studying plant cell wall biosynthesis has been hampered by difficulties associated with expressing and biochemically characterizing the relevant glycosyltransferases (16Petersen B.L.

We propose a two-phase model of polysaccharide elongation in which short-chain acceptors are elongated slowly, followed by a rapid elongation phase once the glycans reach an intermediate, critical degree of polymerization.

The activity reported also provides a basis for the initiation of HG polysaccharides by the GAUT1:GAUT7 complex and suggests that GAUT7 has a previously unrecognized role in contributing to the synthesis of high-MW polysaccharides. The co-immunoprecipitation of GAUT1 with GAUT7 from A. thaliana solubilized membranes revealed that GAUT1 and GAUT7 function as a GAUT1:GAUT7 heterocomplex covalently linked by disulfide bonds (15Atmodjo M.A. Sakuragi Y.

https://openalex.org/W2897621888,"The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill coincided with the spawning season of many pelagic fish species in the Gulf of Mexico. Yet, few studies have investigated physiological responses of larval fish to interactions between anthropogenic crude oil exposure and natural factors (e.g. temperature, oxygen levels). Consequently, mahi mahi (Coryphaena hippurus) embryos were exposed for 24 hours to combinations of two temperatures (26 and 30°C) and six concentrations of oiled fractions of weathered oil (from 0 to 44.1 μg ∑50PAHs·L-1). In 56 hours post-fertilization larvae, heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output were measured as indicators of functional cardiac phenotypes. Fluid accumulation and incidence of edema and hematomas were quantified as indicators of morphological impairments. At both 26 and 30°C, oil-exposed larvae suffered dose-dependent morphological impairments and functional heart failure. Elevation of temperature to 30°C appeared to induce greater physiological responses (bradycardia) at PAH concentrations in the range of 3.0–14.9 μg·L-1. Conversely, elevated temperature in oil-exposed larvae reduced edema severity and hematoma incidence. However, the apparent protective role of warmer temperature does not appear to protect against enhanced mortality. Collectively, our findings show that elevated temperature may slightly decrease larval resilience to concurrent oil exposure."

A prominent feature is abnormal bundling of neurofilaments in many neuronal populations. This study shows the direct involvement of sacsin domains in regulating intermediate filament assembly and dynamics and identifies important domains for alleviating neurofilament bundles in neurons lacking sacsin. Peptides encoding sacsin internal repeat (SIRPT) 1, J-domains, and ubiquitin-like domain modified neurofilament assembly in vivo. The domains with chaperone homology, the SIRPT and the J-domain, had opposite effects, promoting and preventing filament assembly, respectively. In cultured Sacs-/- motor neurons, both the SIRPT1 and J-domain resolved preexisting neurofilament bundles. Increasing expression of heat shock proteins also resolved neurofilament bundles, indicating that this endogenous chaperone system can compensate to some extent for sacsin deficiency.-Gentil, B.

However, little is known about how Chrm2 expression is transcriptionally regulated. Here we show that nerve injury persistently increased the expression of RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST, also known as neuron-restrictive silencing factor [NRSF]), a gene-silencing transcription factor, in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Remarkably, nerve injury–induced chronic but not acute pain hypersensitivity was attenuated in mice with Rest knockout in DRG neurons.

Nerve injury persistently reduced Chrm2 expression in the DRG and diminished the analgesic effect of muscarine. The RE1 binding site on the Chrm2 promoter is required for REST-mediated Chrm2 repression, and nerve injury increased the enrichment of REST in the Chrm2 promoter in the DRG.

However, little is known about how the expression of Chrm2 in the DRG is regulated in neuropathic pain. In this study, we provide new evidence that REST in DRG neurons not only contributes to the transition from acute to chronic pain after nerve injury but is also responsible for nerve injury–induced Chrm2 repression and diminished muscarinic analgesia in neuropathic pain. Thus, REST-dependent epigenetic remodeling is a central mechanism involved in regulating Chrm2 expression in primary sensory neurons and in neuropathic pain development. REST is a key transcriptional repressor that is normally expressed at a low level in differentiated neurons (22Palm K. Belluardo N. Metsis M. Timmusk T. Neuronal expression of zinc finger transcription factor REST/NRSF/XRB gene.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18 (9454838): 1280-129610.1523/JNEUROSCI.18-04-01280.1998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine how nerve injury affects Rest expression in the DRG, we performed L5 and L6 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) in rats, a commonly used rodent model of neuropathic pain (23Kim S.H. Chung J.M. An experimental model for peripheral neuropathy produced by segmental spinal nerve ligation in the rat.Pain. 1992; 50 (1333581): 355-36310.1016/0304-3959(92)90041-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2673) Google Scholar, 24Chaplan S.R.

Quantitative PCR analysis showed that the mRNA level of Rest in the DRG was significantly higher in SNL rats than in sham-operated control rats on days 5, 10, and 21 after surgery (p < 0.0001, F(1,30) = 120.5, n = 6 rats/group; Fig. 1A). In contrast, SNL had no significant effect on the mRNA level of Rest in the dorsal spinal cord (Fig. 1B). To determine whether REST plays a role in nerve injury–induced pain hypersensitivity, we first used an siRNA to knock down Rest in rats subjected to SNL. Three weeks after SNL, intrathecal injection of 2 μg/day of Rest-specific siRNA, but not control siRNA, for 5 days fully restored the mRNA level of Rest in the injured DRG to that observed in the DRG of rats that underwent sham surgery (p < 0.0001, F(2,15) = 56.64, n = 6 rats/group; Fig. 1C). However, treatment with Rest-specific siRNA had no effect on the mRNA level of REST-corepressor 1 (Rcor1) in the DRG (Fig. 1C). Western blotting showed that treatment with Rest-specific siRNA restored the protein level of REST in the injured DRG to that found in sham control rats (p < 0.0001, F(2,15) = 23.24, n = 6 rats/group; Fig. 1D). SNL rats treated with control siRNA displayed a sustained reduction in the withdrawal threshold of the ipsilateral hind paw in response to tactile and noxious pressure stimuli (Fig. 1, E and F). By comparison, treatment with Rest-specific siRNA (2 μg/day) significantly attenuated tactile allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia caused by SNL (n = 9 rats/group; Fig. 1, E and F). These results suggest that nerve injury increases REST expression in the DRG and that REST up-regulation is involved in maintaining chronic neuropathic pain. To further elucidate the role of REST in DRG neurons in the development of chronic pain after nerve injury, we generated Rest conditional knockout mice (Rest-cKO) by crossing Rest-floxed mice (25Gao Z.

The ambulatory behavior and motor coordination, measured with the rotarod test, were similar in Rest-cKO mice and WT littermate controls (Fig. 2A). The protein and mRNA levels of REST in the DRG were diminished in Rest-cKO mice compared with those in WT controls (n = 8 mice/group; Fig. 2, B and C). Furthermore, spared nerve injury (SNI) significantly increased the mRNA level of Rest in the DRG in WT (p = 0.0004, F(1.84,9.20) = 179, n = 6) but not in Rest-cKO mice (Fig. 2D). In WT mice, SNI induced a persistent reduction in the tactile and pressure withdrawal thresholds of the ipsilateral hind paw that lasted for at least 4 weeks (n = 8 mice; Fig. 2, E and F). The withdrawal thresholds did not differ significantly between WT and Rest-cKO mice during the first week after SNI. Remarkably, the nerve injury–induced reduction in the withdrawal thresholds was significantly attenuated in Rest-cKO mice 8 to 29 days after SNI (Fig. 2, E and F). These data indicate that REST-dependent epigenetic remodeling in DRG neurons contributes to the transition from acute to chronic pain after nerve injury. Chrm2 is the most dominant mAChR subtype expressed in the DRG (2Laumet G. Garriga J. Chen S.R. Zhang Y. Li D.P. Smith T.M. Dong Y. Jelinek J. Cesaroni M. Issa J.P. Pan H.L.

Quantitative PCR analysis showed that 5 days after surgery, the mRNA level of Chrm2 in the DRG was significantly lower in SNL rats than in control rats subjected to sham surgery (p < 0.001, F(1,10) = 619.4, n = 6 rats/group, Fig. 3A). This nerve injury-induced Chrm2 down-regulation lasted for at least 3 weeks after surgery (Fig. 3A). However, the mRNA level of Chrm2 in the dorsal spinal cord was not significantly different between SNL and sham control rats on days 5, 10, and 21 after surgery (Fig. 3B). Also, the mRNA level of Chrm4 in the DRG did not differ significantly between the SNL and sham control groups (Fig. 3C). We next used ChIP followed by quantitative PCR to determine whether nerve injury affects the amount of REST in the promoter region of Chrm2 in the DRG. In DRG tissues from sham control rats, the REST occupancy at the Chrm2 promoter was very low and similar to that precipitated by the IgG-negative control (Fig. 3D). However, SNL caused a large increase in the enrichment of REST in the promoter region of Chrm2 in the DRG (p = 0.0002, t(10) = 5.65, n = 6 rats/group; Fig. 3D). In contrast, the level of REST in the promoter region of Gapdh, a highly expressed gene in the DRG, did not differ significantly between the SNL and control groups (Fig. 3E). These results indicate that nerve injury increases REST enrichment at the Chrm2 promoter in the DRG. DNA sequences containing the RE1 site typically recruit the binding of REST and are associated with repression of gene expression (7Johnson D.S. Mortazavi A. Myers R.M. Wold B. Genome-wide mapping of in vivo protein-DNA interactions.Science. 2007; 316 (17540862): 1497-150210.1126/science.1141319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). We initially used Matinspector, a software tool (28Cartharius K. Frech K. Grote K. Klocke B. Haltmeier M. Klingenhoff A. Frisch M. Bayerlein M. Werner T. MatInspector and beyond: promoter analysis based on transcription factor binding sites.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21 (15860560): 2933-294210.1093/bioinformatics/bti473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar), to search for transcription factor binding sites to the promoter region of rat Chrm2. We found an RE1-binding site (taTTCAGgAtacagaagaaGGACtGggaagt; uppercase letters indicate conserved sequences) near the transcription start site (between nucleotides −150 and −119) of Chrm2 (Fig. 4A). We then used a luciferase reporter assay to determine directly whether the RE1 site is involved in suppression of Chrm2 expression by REST. In HEK293 cells transduced with Chrm2 promoter/luciferase expression vectors, luciferase activity was significantly lower in cells with the Chrm2 promoter containing the RE1 sequence than in cells without the RE1 sequence (p = 0.0286, n = 4; Fig. 4B). We repeated the luciferase reporter assay using the F11 cell line, which is a hybrid of a rat embryonic DRG neurons with mouse neuroblastoma cells (29Francel P.C. Harris K. Smith M. Fishman M.C. Dawson G. Miller R.J. Neurochemical characteristics of a novel dorsal root ganglion X neuroblastoma hybrid cell line, F-11.J. Neurochem. 1987; 48 (2435852): 1624-163110.1111/j.1471-4159.1987.tb05711.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was also significantly lower in cells transduced with the Chrm2 promoter containing the RE1 sequence than in F11 cells with the RE1 sequence–deficient Chrm2 promoter (p = 0.0286, n = 4; Fig. 4B). These data indicate that the Chrm2 RE1 site is necessary and sufficient to repress Chrm2 promoter activity. We used a Rest-specific siRNA in SNL rats to determine whether REST is responsible for nerve injury–induced transcriptional repression of Chrm2 in the DRG. Intrathecal treatment with the Rest-specific siRNA fully restored the mRNA level of Chrm2 in the DRG that was decreased by SNL (p < 0.0001, F(2,15) = 21.56, n = 6 rats/group, Fig. 5A). Neither Rest knockdown nor SNL had any effect on the mRNA level of Chrm4 in the DRG (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, treatment with Rest-specific siRNA normalized the M2 protein level in the DRG that was reduced by SNL (p = 0.0012, F(2,15) = 10.92, n = 6 rats/group; Fig. 5C). Because M2 plays a major role in mediating mAChR agonist–induced analgesia (19Cai Y.Q. Chen S.R. Han H.D. Sood A.K. Lopez-Berestein G. Pan H.L.

Treatment with Rest-specific siRNA only slightly augmented the analgesic effect of intrathecal injection of muscarine in sham control rats (Fig. 5, D and E). Compared with the sham control group, intrathecal injection of 2 μg of muscarine in SNL rats produced a minimal analgesic effect on tactile allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia (n = 6 rats/group; Fig. 5, D and E). Strikingly, the effect produced by intrathecal injection of 2 μg of muscarine on pain hypersensitivity was much larger in SNL rats treated with Rest-specific siRNA than in SNL rats treated with control siRNA (Fig. 5, D and E). We then used Rest-cKO mice to confirm the role of REST in DRG neurons in the diminished analgesic effect of muscarine in nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain. In WT mice, SNI significantly reduced the mRNA (p = 0.0003, F(3,20) = 9.93, n = 6 mice/group) and protein (p = 0.0025, F(3,20) = 6.77, n = 6 mice/group) levels of M2 in the DRG (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, in Rest-cKO mice, SNI failed to significantly reduce the mRNA and protein levels of M2 in the DRG (Fig. 6, A and B). The mRNA and protein levels of M2 in the injured DRG of Rest-cKO mice were comparable with those in the DRG of sham-operated WT mice. In WT mice subjected to SNI, intrathecal injection of 0.2 μg and 0.5 μg of muscarine produced only a minimal effect on pain hypersensitivity. By comparison, the analgesic effect of intrathecally administrated muscarine at both 0.2 μg and 0.5 μg was markedly enhanced in Rest-cKO mice subjected to SNI (n = 8 mice/group; Fig. 6, C–F). Collectively, these findings indicate that REST in DRG neurons is responsible for nerve injury–induced transcriptional repression of Chrm2 and the diminished analgesic effect of muscarine in neuropathic pain. At the spinal cord level, M2 is predominately expressed at the central terminals of primary afferent nerves and plays a critical role in regulating glutamate release to spinal dorsal horn neurons (14Chen S.R.

Here we provide further evidence that MT1-MMP interacts with APP and promotes amyloidogenesis in a proteolytic-dependent manner in Swedish APP-expressing human embryonic kidney 293 (HEKswe) cells. MT1-MMP-mediated processing of APP releases a soluble APP fragment, sAPP95. This process partly requires the activation of endogenous MMP-2 but is independent of β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) or α-secretase activities. In contrast, MT1-MMP-mediated increase of Aβ levels involved BACE-1 activity and was inhibited by tissue inhibitor of MMP-2, a natural inhibitor of both MT1-MMP and MMP-2. Interestingly, near abolishment of basal Aβ production upon BACE-1 inhibition was rescued by MT1-MMP, indicating that the latter could mimic β-secretase-like activity. Moreover, MT1-MMP promoted APP/Aβ localization in endosomes, where Aβ production mainly occurs. These data unveil new mechanistic insights to support the proamyloidogenic role of MT1-MMP based on APP processing and trafficking, and reinforce the idea that this proteinase may become a new potential therapeutic target in AD.-Paumier, J.-M., Py, N.

They occur as full-size or half-size transporters and form an active unit consisting of two transmembrane and two nucleotide-binding domains. The ubiquitous presence of ABC transporters in almost all organisms highlights their importance for cellular metabolism. Typically, they play a major role in extruding a multitude of cytotoxic compounds like heavy metal ions or xenobiotics (1Higgins C.F. ABC transporters: physiology, structure and mechanism–an overview.Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152 (11421269): 205-21010.1016/S0923-2508(01)01193-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 2Borst P.

For instance, the human Tangier disease, characterized by the absence of high-density lipoprotein, can be traced back to a defect in HsABCA1, a member of the human A subfamily of ABC transporters. In addition, mutations in HsABCA4 result in delayed dark adaptation in the retina by a reduced all-trans-retinaldehyde clearance, a characteristic feature of Stargardt disease (2Borst P. Elferink R.O. Mammalian ABC transporters in health and disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71 (12045106): 537-59210.1146/annurev.biochem.71.102301.093055Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). The strong association with lipid metabolism suggests that certain lipids might directly serve as transport substrates. Indeed, several reports have demonstrated a role of numerous ABC transporters in the rearrangement of certain lipids within the membrane bilayer. Depending on the direction of movement, the translocator is either called flippase (from the exoplasmic to the cytoplasmic leaflet) or floppase (from the cytoplasmic to the exoplasmic leaflet). A prominent example is the pleiotropic drug resistance–type transporter PDR5 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which was characterized as a phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) floppase besides its function in extruding a diverse set of cytotoxic compounds (3Decottignies A. Grant A.M. Nichols J.W. de Wet H. McIntosh D.B. Goffeau A. ATPase and multidrug transport activities of the overexpressed yeast ABC protein Yor1p. J.

In addition, the human pathogen Leishmania contains a half-size ABCG transporter, which is responsible for the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on its plasma membrane (PM) (4Campos-Salinas J.

The closest related orthologous genes can be found in Oryza sativa (OsABCG50) and Sorghum bicolor (SbABCG50) sharing 86 and 76% identity, respectively. By comparison, the corresponding genes in Arabidopsis thaliana only show intermediate similarity ranging from 50% identity (AtPEN/PDR8) to 56% identity (AtPDR5). In the wheat gene pool, the Lr34 gene is present in two different alleles, called Lr34sus and Lr34res, which are characterized by their susceptible and resistant phenotype, respectively, to biotrophic fungal pathogens in the corresponding wheat varieties. These two alleles differ at two positions within the coding region for the first transmembrane domain leading to a phenylalanine deletion and a conversion of tyrosine to histidine in Lr34res. It is still unclear whether the phenotypic differences are caused by varying protein levels or distinct biochemical functions of the two transporter versions. Recent reports have demonstrated that Lr34res can be functionally transferred to related crop species, like barley, rice, or maize, making them partially resistant against their specific pathogens (8Risk J.M.

Mass Spectrometry-based Metabolomic Approaches to Characterize Plant Pathogen Resistance in Cereals and the Flavonols Modifying Development in Arabidopsis thaliana. Doctoral dissertation, Universität of Zürich, Zürich2017Google Scholar). Moreover, transcriptomic data of Lr34res-expressing barley have revealed the up-regulation of numerous stress- and pathogenicity-related (PR) genes in the absence of fungal infection (12Chauhan H. Boni R. Bucher R. Kuhn B. Buchmann G. Sucher J. Glauser G.

To explain all these observations, it is essential to understand how the ABC transporter functions at the molecular level. The fact that several stress-responsive genes are up-regulated in Lr34res-expressing plants in the absence of pathogens (12Chauhan H. Boni R. Bucher R. Kuhn B. Buchmann G. Sucher J. Glauser G.

A common feature of hormone and pathogen defense signaling pathways is the activation of certain phospholipases (PLases) upon the perception of external signals (14Xue H. Chen X. Li G. Involvement of phospholipid signaling in plant growth and hormone effects.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2007; 10 (17709277): 483-48910.1016/j.pbi.2007.07.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These enzymes convert membrane lipids into signaling compounds like phosphatidic acid (PA), diacylglycerol (DAG), or inositol triphosphate (IP3), which affects downstream PL-interacting factors in their subcellular localization and thus their activity. A prominent example in plants is the protein phosphatase ABI1 from A. thaliana, which binds to PA in the PM upon phospholipase D (PLD) activation and thereby loses its suppressor function in the abscisic acid–signaling pathway (15Mishra G. Zhang W. Deng F. Zhao J. Wang X. A bifurcating pathway directs abscisic acid effects on stomatal closure and opening in Arabidopsis.Science. 2006; 312 (16614222): 264-26610.1126/science.1123769Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Other reports showed that PLDβ1 has a major role in modulating defense responses against bacterial and fungal pathogens through the generation of PA (16Zhao J. Phospholipase D and phosphatidic acid in plant defence response: from protein–protein and lipid–protein interactions to hormone signalling.J. Exp. Bot. 2015; 66 (25680793): 1721-173610.1093/jxb/eru540Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The aim of this work was to address whether the ABC transporter Lr34 affects membrane properties that might lead to the activation of PL-mediated stress signaling in the absence of external factors. We demonstrate that Lr34res promotes the translocation of PA and PS in transgenic barley and changes the distribution of PS and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) in the PM of tobacco BY2 cells. When heterologously expressed in S. cerevisiae, both versions of the ABC transporter (Lr34sus and Lr34res) enhanced PS and reduced PE exposure at the PM. Finally, the presence of Lr34res promoted the accumulation of neutral lipids in oil bodies in an S. cerevisiae mutant strain defective in PL-transfer. Together, these data suggest that Lr34 plays a pivotal role in redistributing certain membrane PLs with impact on overall cellular lipid metabolism. Pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR)-type transporters are usually found in the plasma membrane (17Kang J. Hwang J.U. Lee M. Kim Y.Y. Assmann S.M. Martinoia E. Lee Y. PDR-type ABC transporter mediates cellular uptake of the phytohormone abscisic acid.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

As a prerequisite for subsequent functional studies, it was necessary to confirm the presence of Lr34res in the plant PM. Therefore, the total membrane fraction from tobacco BY2 cells expressing HA-tagged Lr34res was isolated and fractionated on a linear density gradient. Immunolabeling of the fractions with antibodies directed to specific proteins residing at different intracellular membrane compartments demonstrated that the distribution of HA-Lr34res correlated with the PM H+-ATPase marker (Fig. 1, A and B) indicating that Lr34res is indeed associated with the plant PM. Next, the activity of the ABC transporter was investigated that might be responsible for the Lr34res-mediated resistance against various biotrophic pathogens.

J. 2016; 14 (26471973): 1261-126810.1111/pbi.12491Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Lr34res might have a PL flippase or floppase activity with impact on the distribution of certain PLs within the membrane. To study this putative function, Lr34res-expressing (BG9) and the corresponding nontransgenic (sib) barley plants (8Risk J.M. Selter L.L. Chauhan H. Krattinger S.G. Kumlehn J. Hensel G. Lagudah E.S. The wheat Lr34 gene provides resistance against multiple fungal pathogens in barley.Plant Biotechnol. J. 2013; 11: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) were used to isolate protoplasts. These were then incubated with fluorescence-labeled (NBD) PLs to investigate their incorporation in a time-dependent manner. Overall, the uptake rates of NBD-PC, NBD-PE, and NBD-PG were similar between sib and BG9 protoplasts, and no statistically significant difference could be found at any time point (Fig. 2). By contrast, NBD-PA strongly accumulated in transgenic BG9 protoplasts after 10 min, while NBD-PS uptake was significantly reduced. The advantage of using NBD-labeled PLs is the easy detection and quantification of the emitted fluorescence. However, their physical properties slightly differ from natural lipids, what potentially affects their behavior in the hydrophobic membrane environment. To avoid this possible problem, protoplasts from control and transgenic Lr34res-expressing tobacco BY2 cells were transformed with PL-specific biosensors to visualize the intracellular distribution of selected native membrane lipids. In agreement with previous reports (20Simon M.L.A. Platre M.P. Assil S. Wijk R. Chen W.Y. Chory J. Jaillais Y. A multi-colour/multi-affinity marker set to visualize phosphoinositide dynamics in Arabidopsis.Plant J. 2014; 77 (24147788): 322-33710.1111/tpj.12358Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P)-binding, red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged biosensor P18R was enriched in intracellular membranes both in the presence and absence of Lr34res (Fig. 3A). The phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P)-binding biosensor P21R and the corresponding citrine-tagged version (P21Y) showed the strongest signal at a membrane that could be stained with FM4-64 at the periphery of the protoplast (Fig. 3, A and B). This is consistent with the normal localization of PI(4)P at the PM (20Simon M.L.A. Platre M.P. Assil S. Wijk R. Chen W.Y. Chory J. Jaillais Y. A multi-colour/multi-affinity marker set to visualize phosphoinositide dynamics in Arabidopsis.Plant J. 2014; 77 (24147788): 322-33710.1111/tpj.12358Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although the ABC transporter did not affect the subcellular destination of the two monophosphorylated inositides, the PI(4,5)P2-binding biosensor P24R did not label the PM anymore under Lr34res expression but was instead restricted to intracellular, vacuole-like structures. A PS biosensor (Lact-C2) was present at the PM and endomembranes independently of Lr34res expression. However, an accumulation of this biosensor in dot-like structures was observed in Lr34res-expressing protoplasts in contrast to the control. For a verification of these observations, the ratio of the PM/total signal was calculated for the PI(4,5)P2 and PS biosensors. This indeed confirmed a significantly lower fluorescence signal at the PM for the PI(4,5)P2 and PS biosensors in the presence of Lr34res (Fig. 3C) suggesting that these lipids accumulate less at the cytoplasmic PM leaflet. To confirm the role of Lr34 as a translocator for certain PLs and to investigate potential differences in activity between the two transporter versions, Lr34sus and Lr34res, the protein was heterologously expressed in a WT S. cerevisiae strain in order to perform growth assays that use toxins to probe for the translocation of specific endogenous PLs at the PM. In addition to the two native Lr34 proteins, Lr34sus and Lr34res, inactive versions bearing mutations of the critical amino acids in all four Walker domains (Lr34sus/resW, Table 1) were used as controls besides the empty vector because these domains are essential for the hydrolysis of ATP in all ABC transporters.Table 1Mutagenesis sites for generation of inactive Lr34 versionsMotif (position in Lr34r)Original sequenceMutated sequenceWalker A1(168–175)GPPGCGKSGPPGCAASWalker B1(327–332)AYFMDEAYFMAEWalker A2(846–853)GVSGAGKTGVSGAAATWalker B2(973–978)IILMDEIILMAE Open table in a new tab Under standard conditions, the expression of an active Lr34 transporter impaired growth in yeast cells, whereas the inactive Lr34 versions did not cause any effect even when slightly higher protein expression levels were achieved (Fig. 4, A and B). Next, the growth behavior of Lr34-expressing yeast cells was investigated in the presence of specific toxins. The cyclic depsipeptide duramycin specifically binds PE upon exposure to the outer leaflet of the PM and forms pores in the membrane that induces cell death (21Märki F. Hänni E. Fredenhagen A. van Oostrum J. Mode of action of the lanthionine-containing peptide antibiotics duramycin, duramycin B and C, and cinnamycin as indirect inhibitors of phospholipase A2.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42 (1741778): 2027-203510.1016/0006-2952(91)90604-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, any floppase activity resulting in increased PE exposure should enhance the drug sensitivity of the cells, whereas a PE flippase would evoke the opposite effect. Interestingly, duramycin application altered the general growth behavior of yeast cells, indicated by a constant linear growth and loss of clearly distinguishable growth phases (Fig. 5A). Moreover, when growth inhibition was calculated, cells expressing Lr34sus and especially Lr34res were more resistant to the drug and consequently grew significantly better than the corresponding controls at 5 and 10 μm duramycin (Fig. 5B), pointing to a PE flippase activity of both Lr34 versions. Similarly, cells were tested for growth in the presence of the PS-binding cyclic depsipeptide papuamide A, which develops its toxic effect by the same mechanism as duramycin (22Andjelic C.D. Planelles V. Barrows L.R. Characterizing the anti-HIV activity of papuamide A.Mar. Drugs. 2008; 6 (19172193): 528-54910.3390/md20080027Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Parsons A.B.

Exploring the mode-of-action of bioactive compounds by chemical-genetic profiling in yeast.Cell. 2006; 126: 611-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The growth of Lr34sus- and Lr34res-expressing cells was significantly impaired compared with cells expressing the corresponding inactive transporter versions or containing the empty vector already at 0.6 μg/ml papuamide A. This effect persisted when increasing the drug concentration to 1 μg/ml. To get further insights on the PL specificity of the ABC transporter, the growth of cells expressing the different Lr34 versions was also tested in media containing miltefosine. This compound is a structural analogue of lyso-PC and develops its toxic effect upon transport into the cell (24Hanson P.K. Malone L. Birchmore J.L. Nichols J.W. Lem3p is essential for the uptake and potency of alkylphosphocholine drugs, edelfosine and miltefosine. J. Biol.Chem. 2003; 278 (12842877): 36041-3605010.1074/jbc.M305263200Scopus (107) Google Scholar). If Lr34 were able to extrude miltefosine, yeast cells expressing the ABC transporter should be less sensitive to this drug. Apparently, even small toxin concentrations altered the growth behavior in a similar way as duramycin. However, when comparing the growth inhibition rates, it was asserted that in this case neither Lr34sus nor Lr34res expression significantly altered the drug sensitivity of the yeast cells, suggesting that no import or export of miltefosine occurred through the PM. The papuamide and duramycin sensitivity assays probe the distribution of lipids at the PM, which is affected both by the presence of specific transporters at this membrane and by the distribution of lipids at the membrane of vesicles fusing to the PM from internal compartments (25Alder-Baerens N. Lisman Q. Luong L. Pomorski T. Holthuis J.C. Loss of P4 ATPases Drs2p and Dnf3p disrupts aminophospholipid transport and asymmetry in yeast post-Golgi secretory vesicles. Mol. Biol.Cell. 2006; 17 (16452632): 1632-164210.1091/mbc.e05-10-0912Google Scholar). In contrast, the miltefosine sensitivity assay requires the presence of the transporter at the PM, as miltefosine needs to be transported inside the cell to exert its action. Therefore, a lack of miltefosine sensitivity could be related to a trafficking problem, rather than reflect the substrate transport preference of the transporter. Indeed, fluorescent GFP-tagged versions of the Lr34 transporters could be visualized in internal membranes in yeast, but no PM localization was detected (Fig. S1). Nevertheless, we aimed at performing lipid uptake and export assays using NBD-PLs, to directly test the lipid transport capabilities of the Lr34 transporters in yeast. A number of different growth parameters (inducible/constitutive expression, agitation, and temperature) were tested, but we were unable to identify reproducible growth conditions leading to the presence of the transporters at the PM. In summary, Lr34sus and Lr34res enhanced the yeast tolerance to duramycin, suggesting that PE is translocated to the inner side of the yeast PM. The opposite effect was observed for papuamide A, indicating a role of Lr34sus and Lr34res in PS exposure. In accordance with the protein expression levels (Fig. 4B), these effects were slightly more pronounced for Lr34res than for Lr34sus. The previously reported triacylglycerol accumulation in leaves of Lr34res-expressing barley plants (11Bucher R.R. Mass Spectrometry-based Metabolomic Approaches to Characterize Plant Pathogen Resistance in Cereals and the Flavonols Modifying Development in Arabidopsis thaliana. Doctoral dissertation, Universität of Zürich, Zürich2017Google Scholar) suggests a potential link between the PL flippase or floppase activity of Lr34res and overall lipid metabolism. As Lr34res apparently not only translocates PLs in the PM of plants but also in the PM of yeast, it could be assumed that enhanced neutral lipid storage might also be induced by the ABC transporter in fungo. Instead of using WT S. cerevisiae strains that hardly accumulate any lipids under standard growth conditions, the Sec14ts PL-transfer protein mutant CTY1-1A showing constitutively enhanced oil body formation for the storage of accumulating neutral lipids was selected for the following studies. This mutant is characterized by a defect in the PL-transfer protein Sec14, which is necessary for efficient vesicle budding and fusion events between the trans-Golgi network and the PM. Because a deletion of the Sec14 gene is lethal, a mutation was introduced in the coding"

When affecting the heart, amyloidosis can cause severe heart failure, which is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Different subtypes of cardiac amyloidosis exist e.g. transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis and senile cardiac amyloidosis. Today, diagnostics is primarily based on cardiac biopsies and no clinically used circulating blood-based biomarkers existing. Therefore, our aim was to identify circulating microRNAs in patients with different forms of amyloidosis. Methods Blood was collected from healthy subjects (n = 10), patients with reduced ejection fraction (EF < 35%; n = 10), patients affected by transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (n = 13) as well as senile cardiac amyloidosis (n = 11). After performing TaqMan array profiling, promising candidates, in particular miR-99a-5p, miR-122-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-221-3p, miR-1180-3p, miR-155-5p, miR-339-3p, miR-574-3p, miR-342-3p and miR-329-3p were validated via quantitative real time PCR. Results The validation experiments revealed a significant upregulation of miR-339-3p in patients affected with senile cardiac amyloidosis compared to controls. This corresponded to the array profiling results. In contrast, there was no deregulation in the other patient groups. Conclusion MiR-339-3p was increased in blood of patients with senile cardiac amyloidosis. Therefore, miR-339-3p is a potential candidate as biomarker for senile cardiac amyloidosis in future studies. Larger patient cohorts should be investigated."

Using directed cell evolution, rewiring and repurposing of uracil metabolism allowed formation of an alternative β-alanine biosynthetic pathway. After this pathway was deleted, a second was evolved that used a gain-of-function mutation on ornithine decarboxylase (SpeC) to alter reaction and substrate specificity toward an oxidative decarboxylation–deamination reaction. After deletion of both pathways, yet another independent pathway emerged using polyamine biosynthesis, demonstrating the vast capacity of metabolic repair. In response to the deletion of key genes involved in biosynthesis of the essential CoA precursor β-alanine, Escherichia coli overcomes this pathway damage by successively evolving alternative metabolic pathways."

However, little is known on bathymetric and regional effects on the macrobenthos diversity. This study synthesizes new and available macrobenthos data to provide a baseline for future studies of the effects of Arctic change on macrofauna community composition in the Arctic basins. Samples collected during three expeditions (in 1993, 2012 and 2015) at 37 stations on the slope of the Barents and Laptev Seas and in the abyssal of the Nansen and Amundsen Basins in the depth range from 38 m to 4381 m were used for a quantitative analysis of species composition, abundance and biomass. Benthic communities clustered in five depth ranges across the slope and basin. A parabolic pattern of species diversity change with depth was found, with the diversity maximum for macrofauna at the shelf edge at depths of 100-300 m. This deviates from the typical species richness peak at mid-slope depths of 1500-3000 m in temperate oceans. Due to the limited availability of standardized benthos data, it remains difficult to assess if and how the significant sea-ice loss observed in the past decade has affected benthic community composition. The polychaete Ymerana pteropoda and the bryozoan Nolella sp. were found for the first time in the deep Nansen and Amundsen Basins."
https://openalex.org/W2897730066,"Mollusk shells represent important archives for paleoclimatic studies aiming to reconstruct environmental conditions at high temporal resolution. However, the shells, made of calcium carbonate in the form of aragonite and /or calcite, can be altered through time which may undermine the suitability for any reconstruction based on geochemical proxies (i.e., stable isotopes, radiocarbon). At present, the diagenetic processes involved in this chemical and physical deterioration are still poorly understood. The present study aims to shed light on the onset and development of diagenetic alteration in the aragonitic shell of Phorcus turbinatus. To artificially mimic diagenesis, shells of P. turbinatus were exposed to elevated temperatures. The transformation of the mineral phase was monitored by means of Confocal Raman Microscopy whereas the structural changes were investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy. The results indicate that the two distinct shell layers (prismatic layer and nacre) respond differently to the elevated temperatures, suggesting that the different microstructural organization and organic content may drive the onset and spread of the aragonite-to-calcite transformation. Furthermore, changes in the microstructural arrangement became visible prior to the mineralogical transition. Our results demonstrate that the specific physico-chemical characteristics of structurally different areas within the biogenic carbonates have to be taken into account when studying the phase transformation occurring during diagenesis."

Objective We sought to elucidate the electrophysiological, procedural, and clinical baseline parameters that are associated with and perhaps predict the need for PPI after TAVR in a heterogeneous-valve-type real-world cohort. Methods Overall, 494 patients receiving TAVR at our center from April 2009 to August 2015 were screened. ECG analyses and clinical parameters were collected prospectively. Results Overall, 401 patients in this all-comers real-world TAVR cohort with a PPI rate of 16% were included. The mean age was 82 years, and the mean duration to PPI was 5.5 days. A large proportion of Edwards SAPIEN valves (81%), DirectFlow, CoreValve, and Portico were implanted. The main indications for PPI were atrioventricular (AV) block III, AV-block Mobitz type II, bradycardic atrial fibrillation and persistent sinus bradycardia. Between groups with and without PPI, significant differences were noted in the prevalence of post TAVR balloon dilatation, resting heart rate, QRS interval, PR interval with a cut-off of >178 ms, left anterior fascicular block and RBBB in univariate analyses. In the subsequent multiple regression analysis, post TAVR balloon dilatation and a PR interval with a cut-off of >178 ms were significant predictors of PPI. Conclusion This real-world cohort differs from others in its size and heterogeneous valve selection, and indicates for the first time that patients with post balloon dilatation or prolonged PR interval are at a higher risk for pacemaker dependency after TAVR."

The structures of several (bacterial, protozoan, fungal, and human) CYP51 orthologs, in both the ligand-free and inhibitor-bound forms, have been determined and have revealed striking similarity at the secondary and tertiary structural levels, despite having low sequence identity. Moreover, in contrast to many of the substrate-promiscuous, drug-metabolizing P450s, CYP51 structures do not display substantial rearrangements in their backbones upon binding of various inhibitory ligands, essentially representing a snapshot of the ligand-free sterol 14α-demethylase. Here, using the obtusifoliol-bound I105F variant of Trypanosoma cruzi CYP51, we report that formation of the catalytically competent complex with the physiological substrate triggers a large-scale conformational switch, dramatically reshaping the enzyme active site (3.5–6.0 Å movements in the FG arm, HI arm, and helix C) in the direction of catalysis. Notably, our X-ray structural analyses revealed that the substrate channel closes, the proton delivery route opens, and the topology and electrostatic potential of the proximal surface reorganize to favor interaction with the electron-donating flavoprotein partner, NADPH–cytochrome P450 reductase. Site-directed mutagenesis of the amino acid residues involved in these events revealed a key role of active-site salt bridges in contributing to the structural dynamics that accompanies CYP51 function. Comparative analysis of apo-CYP51 and its sterol-bound complex provided key conceptual insights into the molecular mechanisms of CYP51 catalysis, functional conservation, lineage-specific substrate complementarity, and druggability differences.

Here, using the obtusifoliol-bound I105F variant of Trypanosoma cruzi CYP51, we report that formation of the catalytically competent complex with the physiological substrate triggers a large-scale conformational switch, dramatically reshaping the enzyme active site (3.5–6.0 Å movements in the FG arm, HI arm, and helix C) in the direction of catalysis. Notably, our X-ray structural analyses revealed that the substrate channel closes, the proton delivery route opens, and the topology and electrostatic potential of the proximal surface reorganize to favor interaction with the electron-donating flavoprotein partner, NADPH–cytochrome P450 reductase. Site-directed mutagenesis of the amino acid residues involved in these events revealed a key role of active-site salt bridges in contributing to the structural dynamics that accompanies CYP51 function. Comparative analysis of apo-CYP51 and its sterol-bound complex provided key conceptual insights into the molecular mechanisms of CYP51 catalysis, functional conservation, lineage-specific substrate complementarity, and druggability differences. Cytochrome P450 (CYP or P450) 2The abbreviations used are: CYP or P450cytochrome P450CYP51sterol 14α-demethylaseCPRNADPH–cytochrome P450 reductaseRMSDroot mean square deviationHPCD2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrinDLPCl-α-1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholinePDBProtein Data BankMCP14α-methylenecyclopropyl-Δ7-24,25-dihydrolanosterol. enzymes perform multiple biological functions, ranging from degradation of xenobiotics (e.g. drugs and pollutants) to the synthesis of vital endogenous compounds (e.g. steroids, vitamins, fatty acids). While drug-metabolizing CYPs are known for their broad substrate promiscuity, the P450s involved in physiological processes display more strict specificity toward their natural substrates. Sterol 14α-demethylases (CYP51) belong to this second group of P450s, the major distinguishing features of the family being the broadest distribution in nature (found in all biological domains) and the profound functional conservation (the same three-step stereospecific reaction across phylogeny) (1Lepesheva G.I. Waterman M.R. Sterol 14α-demethylase cytochrome P450 (CYP51), a P450 in all biological kingdoms.Biochim. Biophys.

From bacteria to humans, CYP51s catalyze the removal of the 14α-methyl group from the core of one or more of the five naturally occurring cyclized sterol precursors, i.e. lanosterol, 24,25-dihydrolanosterol, eburicol, obtusifoliol, or norlanosterol (Fig. S1A). cytochrome P450 sterol 14α-demethylase NADPH–cytochrome P450 reductase root mean square deviation 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin l-α-1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine Protein Data Bank 14α-methylenecyclopropyl-Δ7-24,25-dihydrolanosterol. The CYP51 reaction includes three consecutive monooxygenation steps (Fig. S1B), in other words three cytochrome P450 catalytic cycles (2Guengerich F.P. Mechanisms of cytochrome P450 substrate oxidation: MiniReview.J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2007; 21 (17936929): 163-16810.1002/jbt.20174Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), except that the resting (water-bound) low-spin ferric state of the heme iron between cycles 1 and 3 is missing because of the presence of the substrate in the enzyme active center (3Hargrove T.Y.

When the substrate binds, it displaces the water molecule from the sixth (distal axial) position in the coordination sphere of the ferric heme iron. The pentacoordinated Fe3+ atom becomes high-spin, and its reduction potential increases. The P450 interacts with its redox partner protein (NADPH–cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), in the case of eukaryotic CYP51s) and accepts one electron forming a high-spin ferrous complex (Fe2+). Subsequent binding of molecular oxygen yields the ferrous dioxygen complex (Fe2+–O–O), which triggers acceptance of a second electron from CPR, producing the ferric-peroxo anion (Fe3+–O–O2−). The ferric-peroxo complex is then protonated to form the ferric-hydroperoxo intermediate (Fe3+–O–OH−), the second protonation of whose distal oxygen atom causes heterolytic scission of the O–O bond, release of water, and generation of a highly reactive Fe4+–oxo cation radical (formally FeO3+, compound I (4Rittle J. Green M.T. Cytochrome P450 compound I: capture, characterization, and C–H bond activation kinetics.Science. 2010; 330 (21071661): 933-93710.1126/science.1193478Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar)), which oxygenates the sterol 14α-methyl group forming the 14α-hydroxymethyl derivative. The iron returns into the ferric state yet remains pentacoordinated high-spin, ready to accept another electron from CPR and proceed to the second monooxygenation cycle. The second cycle produces the 14α-formyl derivative, and the third cycle removes it as formic acid, with the concomitant introduction of the Δ14–15 double bond into the sterol core (1Lepesheva G.I. Waterman M.R. Sterol 14α-demethylase cytochrome P450 (CYP51), a P450 in all biological kingdoms.Biochim. Biophys.

Thus, altogether, the CYP51 reaction consumes six electrons, three molecules of oxygen, and six protons. The CYP51 reaction is required for biosynthesis of sterols that are indispensable components of eukaryotic membranes and also serve as precursors for many kinds of crucial regulatory molecules, such as steroid hormones, nuclear receptors, etc. As a result, CYP51 is the leading target for clinical and agricultural antifungals, is in trials as a target for protozoan infections (5Lepesheva G.I. Friggeri L. Waterman M.R. CYP51 as drug targets for fungi and protozoan parasites: past, present and future.Parasitology. 2018; 145 (29642960): 1820-183610.1017/S0031182018000562Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and is being investigated as a potential target for cholesterol-lowering drugs and post-cancer chemotherapy (6Hargrove T.Y.

The role of CYP51 in most of the bacteria remains unclear, yet its presence in both proteobacteria and actinobacteria (5Lepesheva G.I. Friggeri L. Waterman M.R.

Thus, further understanding of the CYP51 structure/function can be applied not only for the design of new more efficient CYP51-targeting drugs but should also advance the general knowledge on the P450 molecular mechanisms and information about P450 evolution.

Waterman M.R. Structural basis for conservation in the CYP51 family.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1814 (20547249): 88-9310.1016/j.bbapap.2010.06.006Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The lack of conformational changes in response to inhibitor binding in the CYP51 crystal structures is in a good agreement with our previous FRET-based data (in the solution) that detected no conformational changes in the CYP51 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis upon binding of ketoconazole, fluconazole, or the substrate analog estriol (16Lepesheva G.I.

The same experiments, however, demonstrated up to 10 Å movement in the enzyme FG arm (F″ helix) in response to the binding of the substrate lanosterol, thus strongly suggesting that large-scale conformational dynamics must still be involved in CYP51 catalysis, and the evidence for this is provided for the first time in this study. For many years our attempts to co-crystallize CYP51 in complex with a natural substrate were unsuccessful. First, the CYP51 substrates are highly hydrophobic (Fig. S1A) and therefore have poor solubility in water (e.g. obtusifoliol, lanosterol, and eburicol have estimated (ChemDraw Professional) n-octanol/water partition coefficients (log P) values of 8.0, 8.2, and 8.6, respectively). Second, in vitro most CYP51 orthologs do not produce more than 20–40% spectral transition into the high-spin form upon substrate binding (9Lepesheva G.I. Park H.W. Hargrove T.Y. Vanhollebeke B.

Moreover, in our experience, CYP51s from Trypanosoma brucei, Aspergillus fumigatus, and humans lost their substrates upon crystallization, with their heme iron returning to the low-spin water-bound state. Several high-resolution datasets were collected, but no clear density for a sterol molecule was observed (14Hargrove T.Y. Wawrzak Z. Alexander P.W. Chaplin J.H. Keenan M. Charman S.A. Perez C.J.

The I105F mutant of Trypanosoma cruzi CYP51 was selected for this work (this mutation alters the enzyme substrate preferences, converting it from a fungi-like eburicol-specific CYP51 to the plant-like obtusifoliol-specific enzyme (17Lepesheva G.I.

The best resolution achievable was 3.18 Å, with R and Rfree values of 0.26 and 0.28, respectively, and the trigonal P3112 space group (Table 1). The asymmetric unit contained four CYP51 molecules; three of them were obtusifoliol-bound and one was ligand-free (Fig. 2A). Although the electron density of the ligand-free molecule coincided quite well with the Cα trace of the search model (RMSD, 0.8 Å), in the three obtusifoliol-bound molecules the density for several protein backbone segments (the FG arm, the HI arm, and helix C) clearly required manual model rebuilding (Fig. S4).Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsComplexT. cruzi I105F CYP51-ObtusifoliolData collectionWavelength (Å)1.12713Detector usedEIGER X 9 mExposure time0.4 sSpace groupP 31 1 2Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)154.31, 154.31, 178.876α, β, γ (°)90.00, 90.00, 120.00Molecules per asymmetric unit4Number of reflections38,484Resolution (outer shell) (Å)133.64–3.18 (3.27–3.18)Rmerge (outer shell)0.061 (1.357)I/σ (outer shell)14.6 (1.0)Completeness (outer shell) (%)99.3 (99.6)Redundancy (outer shell)6.2 (6.4)RefinementRwork0.260Rfree0.282RMSDs from ideal geometryBond lengths (Å)0.0016Bond angles (°)0.846Ramachandran plotResidues in favorable/allowed regions (%)97/100Outliers (%)0Number of atoms (mean B-factor,Å2)14,610 (156.44)Number of residues per moleculeA/B/C/DProtein (mean B-factor, Å2)447 (137.8)/447 (161.4)/447 (170.2)/447 (166.9)Heme (mean B-factor, Å2)1 (91.0)/1 (94.9)/1 (118.0) /1 (113)Substrate (mean B-factor, Å2)1 (100.5)/1 (123.3)/1 (136.8) /0 (—)PDB code6FMO Open table in a new tab The position of the obtusifoliol molecules is well-defined (Fig. 2B).

Thus, when bound in a productive mode, the substrate enters the CYP51 active site with its aliphatic side chain first. Overall, binding of the physiological substrate obtusifoliol causes a large-scale conformational switch in the CYP51 molecule that involves most of the structural segments of the active cite (Movie S1 and Fig. S6). Only the B′ helix and the β1–4 strand remain stable. The RMSD for the Cα atoms between the substrate-free and substrate-bound molecules is 2.0 Å, more than twice as high as the deviations observed upon binding of inhibitors (usually within 0.5–0.8 Å, e.g. 0.75 Å upon binding of MCP (3Hargrove T.Y.

The HI segment (residues 261–293) moves ∼4 Å toward the distal surface of the CYP51 molecule, somewhat following the movement of the C-terminal portion of helix G and thus creating additional volume for the aliphatic side chain of obtusifoliol that would otherwise collide with the upper portion of the I helix (Fig. 3B). The active site volume, however, remains essentially unchanged, or even slightly decreases, from 1,330 Å3 to 1,240 Å3, because of the rearrangements in helix C (calculated in Accelrys Discovery Studio; probe radius, 1.4 Å). The C-helix (residues 119–138) moves ∼3.5–4 Å inside the protein globule approaching the substrate. It crosses the heme plane and shields the obtusifoliol side chain at the top (Fig. 3C). This large-scale movement alters the topology of the CYP51 proximal surface, the P450 area known to interact with the electron donor partner. Moreover, the guanidino group of Arg-124, which in the ligand-free and in most of the inhibitor-bound protozoan CYP51 structures forms the salt bridge with the heme ring D propionate, moves away from the propionate OH group and now protrudes above the proximal surface of the CYP51 molecule (Fig. 3C, right panel), suggesting that Arg-124 might be directly involved in the electron transfer. The His residue in the middle of the I helix that is followed by the “conserved P450 threonine” (Fig. 4, A and B) is a signature residue in the CYP51 family, whereas in other P450s there is always an acidic residue (Glu or Asp) here (1Lepesheva G.I. Waterman M.R. Sterol 14α-demethylase cytochrome P450 (CYP51), a P450 in all biological kingdoms.Biochim. Biophys.

The corresponding Asp (Asp-251) in P450cam (CYP101A1) has been found to play a key role in proton transfer (21Vidakovic M. Sligar S.G. Li H. Poulos T.L. Understanding the role of the essential Asp251 in cytochrome p450cam using site-directed mutagenesis, crystallography, and kinetic solvent isotope effect.Biochemistry. 1998; 37 (9649301): 9211-921910.1021/bi980189fCrossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the P450cam structure it is usually salt-bridged with the positively charged residues from the F-helix (Lys-178 and Arg-186). The bridges break, however, upon binding of the ferredoxin redox partner (putidaredoxin). The authors proposed that Asp-251 “has to be freed of salt bridges in order to serve its function in the proton relay network” (22Tripathi S. Li H. Poulos T.L. Structural basis for effector control and redox partner recognition in cytochrome P450.Science. 2013; 340 (23744947): 1227-123010.1126/science.1235797Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To test whether the conserved (although reverse-charged) His-acid salt bridge (Fig. 4, A and B) that opens upon binding of the substrate in our structure (Fig. 3A) plays a similar role in proton transfer in the CYP51 family, we mutated His-314 and Asp-231 (Fig. 4B) in human CYP51 to Ala and also made the double mutant (H314A/D231A). The human ortholog was selected for mutagenesis because, in our collection of CYP51 enzymes, catalytically it is the fastest (6Hargrove T.Y. Friggeri L. Wawrzak Z. Sivakumaran S. Yazlovitskaya E.M.

https://openalex.org/W2898054793,"Ecological communities are composed of species that interact with each other forming complex interaction networks. Although interaction networks have been usually treated as static entities, interactions show high levels of temporal variation, mainly due to temporal species turnover. Changes in taxonomic composition are likely to bring about changes in functional trait composition. Because functional traits influence the likelihood that two species interact, temporal changes in functional composition and structure may ultimately affect interaction network structure. Here, we study the seasonality (spring vs. summer) in a community of cavity-nesting solitary bees and wasps (‘hosts’) and their nest associates (‘parasitoids’). We analyze seasonal changes in taxonomic compostion and structure, as well as in functional traits, of the host and parasitoid communities. We also analyze whether these changes result in changes in percent parasitism and interaction network structure. Our host and parasitoid communities are strongly seasonal. Host species richness increases from spring to summer. This results in important seasonal changes in functional composition of the host community. The spring community (almost exclusively composed of bees) is characterized by large, univoltine, adult-wintering host species. The summer community (composed of both bees and wasps) is dominated by smaller, bivoltine, prepupa-wintering species. Host functional diversity is higher in summer than in spring. Importantly, these functional changes are not only explained by the addition of wasp species in summer. Functional changes in the parasitoid community are much less pronounced, probably due to the lower parasitoid species turnover. Despite these important taxonomic and functional changes, levels of parasitism did not change across seasons. Two network metrics (generality and interaction evenness) increased from spring to summer. These changes can be explained by the seasonal increase in species richness (and therefore network size). The seasonal shift from a bee-dominated community in spring to a wasp-dominated community in summer suggests a change in ecosystem function, with emphasis on pollination in spring to emphasis on predation in summer."
https://openalex.org/W2896133660,"Aspen ecosystems (upland Populus-dominated forests) support diverse species assemblages in many parts of the northern hemisphere, yet are imperiled by common stressors. Extended drought, fire suppression, human development, and chronic herbivory serve to limit the sustainability of this keystone species. Here we assess conditions at a renowned quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) grove-purportedly the largest living organism on earth-with ramifications for aspen biogeography globally. The ""Pando"" clone is 43 ha and estimated to contain 47,000 genetically identical aspen ramets. This iconic forest is threatened in particular by herbivory, and current management activities aim to reverse the potential for type conversion, likely to a non-forest state. We set out to gauge agents affecting recent deterioration through a network of monitoring plots and by examining a chronosequence of historic aerial photos to better understand the timing of putative departure from a sustainable course. Sixty-five permanent forest monitoring plots were located in three management regimes existing within Pando: no fencing, fencing with active and passive treatments, fencing with passive-only treatment. At each sample plot we measured live and dead mature trees, stem recruitment and regeneration, forest and shrub cover, browse level, and feces counts as a surrogate for ungulate presence. Ordination results indicate that aspen regeneration was the strongest indicator of overall forest conditions at Pando, and that mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) presence strongly impacts successful regeneration. Additionally, fencing with active/passive treatments yielded the most robust regeneration levels; however, a fence penetrable by ungulates in the passive-only treatment most likely played a role in this outcome. The aerial photo sequence depicts various human intrusions over the past seven decades, but perhaps most telling, a decline in self-replacement beginning 30-40 years ago. Aspen communities in many locations in North American and Europe are impacted by unchecked herbivory. The Pando clone presents a unique opportunity for understanding browse mechanisms in a forest where tree genotype, closely aligned with growth and chemical defense, is uniform."

To target specific pathogenicity factors used by the pathogen to infect its host or other targets of interest, e-probes need to be developed for transcripts related to that function. In this study, EDNA transcriptomics (EDNAtran) was developed to detect the expression of genes related to aflatoxin production at the transcriptomic level. E-probes were designed from genes up-regulated during A. flavus aflatoxin production. EDNAtran detected gene transcripts related to aflatoxin production in a transcriptomic database from corn, where aflatoxin was produced. The results were significantly different from e-probes being used in the transcriptomic database where aflatoxin was not produced (atoxigenic AF36 strain and toxigenic AF70 in Potato Dextrose Broth)."

In this study, Next-Generation Sequencing was utilised to produce transcriptomes of the major ampullate gland of two Australian golden orb-weavers, Nephila plumipes and Nephila pilipes, in order to identify highly expressed predicted proteins that may co-factor in the construction of the final polymer. Furthermore, proteomics was performed by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectroscopy to analyse the natural solid silk fibre of each species to confirm highly expressed predicted proteins within the silk gland are present in the final silk product. We assembled the silk gland transcriptomes of N. plumipes and N. pilipes into 69,812 and 70,123 contigs, respectively. Gene expression analysis revealed that silk gene sequences were among the most highly expressed and we were able to procure silk sequences from both species in excess of 1,300 amino acids. However, some of the genes with the highest expression values were not able to be identified from our proteomic analysis. Proteome analysis of ""reeled"" silk fibres of N. plumipes and N. pilipes revealed 29 and 18 proteins, respectively, most of which were identified as silk fibre proteins.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) are known as predictors of CVD in these patients. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a biomarker of acute kidney injury. Recently, elevated NGAL levels have been reported in patients with CVD. This study aimed to evaluate the association between plasma NGAL levels and LVH/LVDD in patients with CKD.This study included 332 patients with pre-dialysis CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73m2). Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed to measure the left ventricular mass index (LVMI). Tissue Doppler imaging was used to measure early mitral inflow velocity (E) and the peak early mitral annular velocity (E'). Diastolic function was estimated using E' and the ratio of E to E' (E/E'). The associations of echocardiographic index with clinical and laboratory variables (age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, eGFR, albumin, uric acid, calcium, phosphate, total cholesterol, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), the inferior vena cava collapse index (IVCCI) < 50%, and plasma NGAL) were investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses.In multivariate logistic regression analysis, plasma NGAL was an independent predictor of LVH (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.02), P < 0.001). In addition, hypertension, intact PTH, and IVCCI < 50% were independent predictors of LVH. Plasma NGAL (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.02, P < 0.001) was also an independent factor of LVDD. Furthermore, hypertension, intact PTH, and IVCCI < 50% were independent predictors of LVDD. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (area under the curve: 0.835, 95% CI: 0.792-0.879) showed the best cutoff value of plasma NGAL for identifying LVDD was ≥ 258 ng/ml with an associated sensitivity of 77.6% and a specificity of 87.6%.Plasma NGAL levels were independent predictors of LVH and LVDD in patients with pre-dialysis CKD, suggesting that plasma NGAL could be a biomarker for LVH and LVDD in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2896592666,"Background Promoter DNA methylation of Cysteine dioxygenase type1 (CDO1) gene has been clarified as a molecular diagnostic and prognostic indicator in various human cancers. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical relevance of CDO1 methylation in primary biliary tract cancer (BTC). Methods CDO1 DNA methylation was assessed by quantitative methylation-specific PCR in 108 BTC tumor tissues and 101 corresponding normal tissues. BTC was composed of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EHCC) (n = 81) and ampullary carcinoma (AC) (n = 27). Results The CDO1 methylation value in the tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in the corresponding normal tissues (p<0.0001). The overall survival (OS) in EHCC patients with hypermethylation was poorer than those with hypomethylation (p = 0.0018), whereas there was no significant difference in AC patients. Multivariate analysis identified that CDO1 hypermethylation, preoperative serum CA19-9 and perineural invasion were independent prognostic factors in EHCC. The EHCC patients with CDO1 hypermethylation exhibited more dismal prognosis than those with hypomethylation even in low group of CA19-9 level (p = 0.0006). Conclusions Our study provided evidence that promoter DNA methylation of CDO1 gene could be an excellent molecular diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in primary EHCC. The combination of CDO1 methylation and preoperative serum CA19-9 effectively enriched EHCC patients who showed the most dismal prognosis. These markers would be beneficial for clinical clarification of the optimal strategies in EHCC."

Qualitative observations (5), interviews with staff (20) and with TB patients (10) were conducted mid-way and at the end of the intervention to understand perceptions, processes, and experiences of TB care.The organisation of TB services is strongly influenced by a divide between medical and social aspects of TB care. Communication and care practices are geared towards addressing individual risk factors for non-adherence rather than the structural vulnerabilities that patients experience in accessing care. Support for vulnerable patients is limited because of standardised programmatic approaches, resource constraints and restricted job descriptions for non-medical staff.Providing support for vulnerable patients is challenged in this setting by the strict division between medical and social aspects of TB care, and the organisational focus on patient-related rather than systems-related barriers to access and adherence. Potential systems interventions include the introduction of multi-disciplinary approaches and teams in TB care, strengthening patient literacy at the point of treatment initiation, as well as stronger linkages with social care organisations."
https://openalex.org/W2897713497,"Actinobacteria possess a great wealth of pathways for production of bioactive compounds. Following advances in genome mining, dozens of natural product (NP) gene clusters are routinely found in each actinobacterial genome; however, the modus operandi of this large arsenal is poorly understood. During investigations of the secondary metabolome of Streptomyces rapamycinicus, the producer of rapamycin, we observed accumulation of two compounds never before reported from this organism. Structural elucidation revealed actinoplanic acid A and its demethyl analogue. Actinoplanic acids (APLs) are potent inhibitors of Ras farnesyltransferase and therefore represent bioactive compounds of medicinal interest. Supported with the unique structure of these polyketides and using genome mining, we identified a gene cluster responsible for their biosynthesis in S. rapamycinicus. Based on experimental evidence and genetic organization of the cluster, we propose a stepwise biosynthesis of APL, the first bacterial example of a pathway incorporating the rare tricarballylic moiety into an NP. Although phylogenetically distant, the pathway shares some of the biosynthetic principles with the mycotoxins fumonisins. Namely, the core polyketide is acylated with the tricarballylate by an atypical nonribosomal peptide synthetase–catalyzed ester formation. Finally, motivated by the conserved colocalization of the rapamycin and APL pathway clusters in S. rapamycinicus and all other rapamycin-producing actinobacteria, we confirmed a strong synergism of these compounds in antifungal assays. Mining for such evolutionarily conserved coharboring of pathways would likely reveal further examples of NP sets, attacking multiple targets on the same foe. These could then serve as a guide for development of new combination therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2897408195,"Pausing of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) during early transcription, mediated by the negative elongation factor (NELF) complex, allows cells to coordinate and appropriately respond to signals by modulating the rate of transcriptional pause release. Promoter proximal enrichment of Pol II occurs at uterine genes relevant to reproductive biology; thus, we hypothesized that pausing might impact endometrial response by coordinating hormonal signals involved in establishing and maintaining pregnancy. We deleted the NELF-B subunit in the mouse uterus using PgrCre (NELF-B UtcKO). Resulting females were infertile. Uterine response to the initial decidual stimulus of NELF-B UtcKO was similar to that of control mice; however, subsequent full decidual response was not observed. Cultured NELF-B UtcKO stromal cells exhibited perturbances in extracellular matrix components and also expressed elevated levels of the decidual prolactin Prl8a2, as well as altered levels of transcripts encoding enzymes involved in prostaglandin synthesis and metabolism. Because endometrial stromal cell decidualization is also critical to human reproductive health and fertility, we used small interfering to suppress NELF-B or NELF-E subunits in cultured human endometrial stromal cells, which inhibited decidualization, as reflected by the impaired induction of decidual markers PRL and IGFBP1. Overall, our study indicates NELF-mediated pausing is essential to coordinate endometrial responses and that disruption impairs uterine decidual development during pregnancy.-Hewitt, S.

These networks offer an exciting new tool for neuroscience that can give us insight in the emergence of neural and behavioral mechanisms. A big gap remains though between the very deep neural networks that have risen in popularity and outperformed many existing shallow networks in the field of computer vision and the highly recurrently connected human brain. This trend towards ever-deeper architectures raises the question why the brain has not developed such an architecture. Besides wiring constraints we argue that the brain operates under different circumstances when performing object recognition, being confronted with noisy and ambiguous sensory input. The role of time in the process of object recognition is investigated, showing that a recurrent network trained through reinforcement learning is able to learn the amount of time needed to arrive at an accurate estimate of the stimulus and develops behavioral and neural mechanisms similar to those found in the human and non-human primate literature."

To better understand how the MD regulates ClpB activity, here we investigated the roles of motif-1 in ClpB from Thermus thermophilus (TClpB). Using systematic alanine substitution of the conserved charged residues, we identified functionally important residues in motif-1, and using a photoreactive cross-linker and LC-MS/MS analysis, we further explored potential interacting residues. Moreover, we constructed TClpB mutants in which functionally important residues in motif-1 and in other candidate regions were substituted by oppositely charged residues. These analyses revealed that the intra-subunit pair Glu-401–Arg-532 and the inter-subunit pair Asp-404–Arg-180 are functionally important, electrostatically interacting pairs. Considering these structural findings, we conclude that the Glu-401–Arg-532 interaction shifts the equilibrium of the MD conformation to stabilize the activated form and that the Arg-180–Asp-404 interaction contributes to intersubunit signal transduction, essential for ClpB chaperone activities.

The structural changes of the ring, induced by the cooperative ATPase cycle, promote disentangling of aggregated substrates by threading them into the central pore of the ring.

The NBD controls the conformation of the SBD and its binding affinity for substrate proteins in an ATPase cycle-dependent manner (24Kityk R. Kopp J. Sinning I. Mayer M.P.

In the high-affinity conformation, the NBD can bind to the edge of MD motif-2 of ClpB/Hsp104 (21Hayashi S. Nakazaki Y. Kagii K. Imamura H. Watanabe Y.H. Fusion protein analysis reveals the precise regulation between Hsp70 and Hsp100 during protein disaggregation.Sci.

This interaction causes recruitment of ClpB/Hsp104 to aggregates and relieves repression by the MD. Mutations at the edge of motif-1 and motif-2, E432A and Y503D of Escherichia coli ClpB (EClpB), are known to stabilize the repressed and activated conformations, and these mutants are termed repressed and hyperactive mutants, respectively (18Oguchi Y. Kummer E. Seyffer F. Berynskyy M. Anstett B. Zahn R. Wade R.C. Mogk A. Bukau B. A tightly regulated molecular toggle controls AAA+ disaggregase.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Single particle reconstitution of cryo-EM images of these mutants revealed that the conformations of the MD in the repressed and hyperactive mutants are horizontal and tilted to the main body, respectively (28Carroni M. Kummer E. Oguchi Y. Wendler P. Clare D.K. Sinning I. Kopp J. Mogk A. Bukau B. Saibil H.R. Head-to-tail interactions of the coiled-coil domains regulate ClpB activity and cooperation with Hsp70 in protein disaggregation.Elife. 2014; 3 (24843029): e0248110.7554/eLife.02481Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the horizontal conformation, both edges of the MD interact with the MD edges of neighboring subunits in a head-to-tail manner. The interaction between the DnaK NBD and the motif-2 of ClpB MD is thought to disrupt the inter-MD interactions and induce the MD into the tilted conformation. Although the role of MD motif-2 in binding DnaK NBD is clear, the roles of motif-1 should also be investigated to understand the mechanisms involved in controlling MD conformation, and in the regulation of ClpB activity by the MD. To clarify these issues, here we identified functionally important residues in motif-1 and their targets for interaction. We also identified the nucleotide dependence of the interactions. To identify important residues in the MD motif-1, we substituted the conserved charged residues, Glu-401, Glu-402, Asp-404, Glu-407, Arg-408, Glu-416, Lys-422, Glu-423, Asp-425, Arg-431, and Glu-438, in motif-1 with Ala and tested the effects on ClpB activities (Fig. 1, b and c). At 55 °C, WT TClpB hydrolyzed ATP at a rate of 48 min−1, and the rate was stimulated by the presence of κ-casein up to 83 min−1 (Fig. 2a). All of the tested Ala mutants showed similar or at most 2-fold higher ATPase activity to that of the WT, in both the absence and presence of κ-casein (Fig. 2a). The disaggregation activities were measured by using α-glucosidase from Bacillus stearothermophilus, which was completely aggregated by heat treatment at 73 °C for 10 min (29Watanabe Y.H. Yoshida M. Trigonal DnaK–DnaJ complex versus free DnaK and DnaJ: heat stress converts the former to the latter, and only the latter can do disaggregation in cooperation with ClpB.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 (14729677): 15723-1572710.1074/jbc.M308782200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The WT TClpB could reactivate 54% of the aggregated α-glucosidase by incubation with TDnaK, TDnaJ, TGrpE (TKJE), and ATP at 55 °C for 90 min (Fig. 2b). Although the E402A, E407A, E416A, K422A, R431A, and E438A mutants showed almost the same disaggregation activity as that of WT, the reactivation yields of E401A, R408A, and D425A mutants decreased to 10, 24, and 42%, respectively, and the D404A and E423A mutants completely lost disaggregation activity. When the α-glucosidase was heat-treated in the presence of TKJE and ATP, the substrate protein lost enzyme activity (denatured); however, it remained soluble (29Watanabe Y.H. Yoshida M. Trigonal DnaK–DnaJ complex versus free DnaK and DnaJ: heat stress converts the former to the latter, and only the latter can do disaggregation in cooperation with ClpB.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 (14729677): 15723-1572710.1074/jbc.M308782200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The soluble, denatured protein can be reactivated by incubation at 55 °C in the presence of TKJE, ATP, and TClpB supplemented after the 73 °C heat treatment. In this case, WT TClpB could reactivate 80% of soluble, denatured α-glucosidase (Fig. 2c). As in the case of disaggregation, D404A and E423A mutations severely inhibited the reactivation activity. However, R408A and D425A mutants could reactivate the soluble, denatured α-glucosidase at almost the same efficiency as that of the WT, and the reactivation yield by the E401A mutant also increased, reaching 54%. Here, we identified several important (Glu-401, Arg-408, and Asp-425) and essential (Asp-404 and Glu-423) residues for the chaperone activity of ClpB. Among these residues, the importance of Glu-423 (corresponding to Glu-432 of EClpB) has been reported, and its roles have been proposed previously (18Oguchi Y. Kummer E. Seyffer F. Berynskyy M. Anstett B. Zahn R. Wade R.C. Mogk A. Bukau B. A tightly regulated molecular toggle controls AAA+ disaggregase.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Thus, hereafter, we focused on Asp-404 and Glu-401. The former is a newly identified essential residue, and the latter is an amino acid that is more important than Arg-408 and Asp-425. To identify the interaction targets of Glu-401 and Asp-404, we used the bidirectional photoreactive cross-linker, benzophenone-4-maleimide (BPM). The BPM-labeled TClpB mutants, E401C-BPM and D404C-BPM, were UV-irradiated in the absence or presence of nucleotides and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3, a and b). By the UV irradiation, the intensity of the band representing noncross-linked BPM-labeled TClpB decreased, and several ladder bands with higher molecular weights appeared (Fig. 3a). As the reaction mixture did not contain proteins other than BPM-labeled TClpB, inter-subunit cross-linking would occur, and each ladder band corresponded to a multimer of BPM-labeled TClpB. We quantified the intensities of bands corresponding to 1–5- and over 6-mer (Fig. 3b). It should be noted that the over 6-mer bands consisted of a few closely positioned bands, which would correspond to linear 6-mer, closed-ring 6-mer, or 7-mer that would appear transiently (17Uchihashi T. Watanabe Y.H. Nakazaki Y. Yamasaki T. Watanabe H. Maruno T. Ishii K. Uchiyama S. Song C. Murata K. Iino R. Ando T. Dynamic structural states of ClpB involved in its disaggregation function.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 (29858573): 214710.1038/s41467-018-04587-wCrossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When the E401C-BPM was UV-irradiated in the absence of nucleotide, the intensity of the noncross-linked 1-mer band decreased to 24%, and 31% of E401C-BPM appeared as over 6-mer band. However, intensities of the over 6-mer bands decreased to less than 4% when the UV irradiation was performed in the presence of ATP or ADP (Fig. 3, a and b). Also, in the case of D404C-BPM, similar ladder bands appeared after UV irradiation (Fig. 3, a and b). However, the nucleotide dependence was opposite that seen in the case of E401C-BPM. These results indicated that Glu-401 and Asp-404 interacted with neighboring subunits, in different ways, and these interactions were influenced by the nucleotide states. To identify the responsible nucleotide-binding domain, similar experiments using E401C-BPM and D404C-BPM bearing mutations in the Walker-A consensus sequences of AAA1 or AAA2 were also performed (Fig. 3, a and b). Conserved Lys–Thr pairs in the Walker-A sequence (GXXGXGKT) were replaced by Ala–Ala, and the mutated AAA module could not bind nucleotides (30Watanabe Y.H. Motohashi K. Yoshida M. Roles of the two ATP binding sites of ClpB from Thermus thermophilus.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (11741950): 5804-580910.1074/jbc.M109349200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In both cases of E401C-BPM and D404C-BPM, Walker-A mutations involving AAA1 were more effective than those in AAA2 in canceling the nucleotide dependence of cross-linking efficiency (Fig. 3, a and b). To identify the site of cross-linkage, we performed mass spectrometric analysis of cross-linked TClpBs by using LC-MS/MS (Table 1). To simplify the interpretation of MS data, ND-truncated TClpB (TClpB_ΔN) was used in this analysis. The TClpB_ΔN_E401C-BPM, UV-irradiated in the absence of nucleotides, was cleaved by trypsin and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. We detected some peptides cross-linked by BPM. Peptides comprising the sequence from Gly-218 to Lys-225 (218GDVPEGLK225) of TClpB were most frequently detected as the cross-linkage targets of E401C-BPM. The peptides 519LEVTEEDIAEIVSRWTGIPVSK540 and 381AIDLIDEAAARLR393 were also detected. When the UV irradiation was performed in the presence of ATP, a similar set of peptides was detected. In this condition, the peptides 519LEVTEEDIAEIVSR532 (a part of 519LEVTEEDIAEIVSRWTGIPVSK540) and 392LRMALESAPCEIDALERKK410 were also detected. In the cases of TClpB_ΔN_D404C-BPM, UV-irradiated in the absence or presence of ATP, peptides containing the sequence 218GDVPEGLK225, 381AIDLIDEAAARLR393, 409KKLQLEIER417, and 701NTVIILTSNLGSPLILEGLQK721 were detected as the cross-linkage targets. A peptide 835VQVDVGPAGLVFAVPAR851 was detected only when the UV irradiation was performed in the presence of ATP. It should be noted that the peptide, 701NTVIILTSNLGSPLILEGLQK721 might be mis-annotated, because the peptide was also detected in the analysis without UV irradiation.Table 1Cross-linked peptide pairs detected by LC-MS/MSTClpBNucleotidePeptide including Cys labeled with BPMPeptide including photo cross-linked residueTheoretical peptide massNo. of detected spectraDaE401CNo nucleotide394MALESAPCEIDALER408218GDVPEGLK2252756.2792412394MALESAPCEIDALER408215IVKGDVPEGLK2253096.5266610394MALESAPCEIDALERK409215IVKGDVPEGLK2253224.621627392LRMALESAPCEIDALERK409218GDVPEGLK2253153.559355394MALESAPCEIDALER408519LEVTEEDIAEIVSRWTGIPVSK5404413.151458394MALESAPCEIDALER408381AIDLIDEAAARLR3933368.649955ATP394MALESAPCEIDALER408218GDVPEGLK2252756.279247394MALESAPCEIDALER408215IVKGDVPEGLK2253096.5266611394MALESAPCEIDALERK409218GDVPEGLK2252884.374192394MALESAPCEIDALER408519LEVTEEDIAEIVSR5323544.670802394MALESAPCEIDALER408519LEVTEEDIAEIVSRWTGIPVSK5404413.1514512394MALESAPCEIDALERK409519LEVTEEDIAEIVSRWTGIPVSK5404541.246402394MALESAPCEIDALER408381AIDLIDEAAARLR3933368.649954394MALESAPCEIDALER408392LRMALESAPCEIDALERKK4104114.995432D404CNo nucleotide394MALESAPEEICALER408218GDVPEGLK2252770.294892394MALESAPEEICALER408215IVKGDVPEGLK2253110.542315394MALESAPEEICALERKK410215IVKGDVPEGLK2253366.732222394MALESAPEEICALER408381AIDLIDEAAARLR3933382.6656011394MALESAPEEICALER408409KKLQLEIER4173112.569192394MALESAPEEICALER408701NTVIILTSNLGSPLILEGLQK721aMALESAPEEICALER-NTVIILTSNLGSPLILEGLQK cross-linked signals were also detected in no UV-irradiation samples.4179.160164ATP394MALESAPEEICALER408215IVKGDVPEGLK2253110.542316394MALESAPEEICALERK409218GDVPEGLK2252898.389842394MALESAPEEICALER408381AIDLIDEAAARLR3933382.665607394MALESAPEEICALER408409KKLQLEIER4173112.569192394MALESAPEEICALER408835VQVDVGPAGLVFAVPAR8513650.823152394MALESAPEEICALER408701NTVIILTSNLGSPLILEGLQK721aMALESAPEEICALER-NTVIILTSNLGSPLILEGLQK cross-linked signals were also detected in no UV-irradiation samples.4179.160164a MALESAPEEICALER-NTVIILTSNLGSPLILEGLQK cross-linked signals were also detected in no UV-irradiation samples. Open table in a new tab To confirm the plausibility of the mass spectrometric analysis, we constructed hexameric structural models of TClpB by homology modeling using recently solved cryo-EM structures of EClpB hexamers as templates (16Deville C.

Fig. 4 shows interfaces between an MD motif-1 and the AAA1 of the neighboring subunit in the TClpB models. The MDs in Fig. 4, a and b, correspond to the tilted (chain D of the PDB code 5og1) and the horizontal (chain C of the PDB code 5ofo) conformation, respectively. Although inter-subunit interactions involving Glu-401 and Asp-404 were not identified in these models, the B3-helix (Asp-176–Leu-187) and the loop between the B4-helix and b3-strand (Gly-218–Lys-227) of the AAA1 large sub-domain of the neighboring subunit were found to be proximal to Glu-401 and Asp-404. This was consistent with the result that the 218GDVPEGLK225 peptide was found as the primary cross-linking target of both E401C-BPM and D404C-BPM. On the surface of the helix and the loop, some conserved charged residues, Asp-176, Glu-177, Arg-180, Arg-181, Arg-214, Asp-219, and Glu-222, were found (Fig. 4, a–c). In addition, only in the tilted conformation Glu-401 was located near Arg-532 in the 519LEVTEEDIAEIVSRWTGIPVSK540 peptide that was detected as a cross-linking target for E401C-BPM (Fig. 4, d and e). Furthermore, Arg-532 was highly conserved among various ClpB/Hsp104s (Fig. 4f). Considering the hexameric model, structural regions corresponding to the other detected peptides, 381AIDLIDEAAARLR393, 392LRMALESAPCEIDALERKK410, 409KKLQLEIER417, 835VQVDVGPAGLVFAVPAR851, did not seem to interact with either Glu-401 or Asp-404. Thus, we considered these conserved charged eight residues as candidates for target residues that functionally interact with Glu-401 and/or Asp-404. We substituted these candidate residues with Ala and tested the effects on ClpB activities. D176A and E177A mutants showed 2–4 times higher ATPase activity than the WT, whereas the activities of the other mutants were similar to or slightly lower than the WT (Fig. 5a). D176A, E177A, and E222A mutants could reactivate aggregated and soluble, denatured α-glucosidase with efficiencies comparable with that of WT (Fig. 5, b and c). However, the other mutants hardly reactivated the aggregated α-glucosidase. The reactivation yields of soluble, denatured α-glucosidase by R180A, R181A, R214A, and D219A mutants were also relatively low, ∼20–30%, whereas that of R532A was considerably high at 61%, similar to the case of E401A (Fig. 5, b and c). Because the effects of the R180A, R181A, R214A, D219A, and R532A mutations were similar to those of the E401A and D404A mutations, these residues might interact with Glu-401 and/or Asp-404. To test this possibility, we prepared TClpB mutants in which these charged residues were substituted by amino acids having the opposite charge, and the mutations were combined. All of the single and combined charge-inverted mutants tested here showed comparable ATPase activities to that of the WT (48–150%) and 1.5–2.7-fold ATPase stimulation by κ-casein (Fig. 6, a and b). Although all the single charge-inverted mutants hardly reactivated the heat-aggregated α-glucosidase (the reactivation yields were less than 7%), the R180D_D404R and R532E_E401R double mutants could reactivate it to 31 and 25%, respectively (Fig. 6, c and d). Such recovery of disaggregation activity was not observed with any other combinations of charge-inverted mutations. Concerning the reactivation of soluble, denatured α-glucosidase, some single and combined charge-inverted mutants resulted in some extent of reactivation: R181E (34%), R181D (25%), R214E (50%), R214D (46%), R532E (41%), E401R (20%), and R214D_D404R (27%) (Fig. 6, e and"

Due to the scarcity of scientific publications focused on diseases of poverty, the development of well-founded clinical guidelines becomes more and more important. In view of that, this paper aims to evaluate the quality of Brazilian guidelines for those diseases. The AGREE II method was used to evaluate 16 guidelines for poverty-related diseases (PRD) and 16 guidelines for global diseases whose treatment require high-cost technologies (HCD), with the ultimate aim of comparing the results. It was found that, in general, the guideline development quality standard is higher for the HCD guidelines than for the PRD guidelines, with emphasis on the ""rigour of development"" (48% and 7%) and ""editorial independence"" (43% and 1%) domains, respectively, which had the greatest discrepancies. The HCD guidelines showed results close to or above international averages, whereas the PRD guidelines showed lower results in the 6 domains evaluated. It can be concluded that clinical protocol development priorities need some redirecting in order to qualify the guidelines that define the healthcare organization and the care of vulnerable populations."

https://openalex.org/W2896676869,"Novel ecosystems have emerged through human intervention and are rapidly expanding around the world. Whether they can support animal wildlife has generated considerable controversy. Here we developed a new approach to evaluate the ability of a novel forest ecosystem, dominated by the exotic tree species Eucalyptus globulus, to support animal wildlife in the medium and long term. To evaluate this ability, we took advantage of the fact that species territory size decreases with increasing habitat quality, and we used territoriality of a raptor guild composed of Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Eurasian Sparrowhawk (A. nisus) and Common Buzzard (Buteo buteo) as indicator. We compared the territoriality of these species in the novel ecosystem with that in other ecosystems found in the literature. Average distances between con-specifics in the novel ecosystem were similar, or even shorter, than those in other ecosystems. Average distances between Goshawk con-specifics were among the shortest described in the literature. All three species nested preferably in mixed stands abundant in large exotic trees, with high structural complexity and abundance of native species within the stand. Key factors supporting this diverse and dense raptor community were the special forest management system implemented in the study area and the agricultural matrix located close to forest plantations that complements the supply of prey. Our results suggest that forest management that promotes a complex and suitable forest structure can increase the ability of novel forest ecosystems to support wildlife biodiversity, particularly a diverse nesting community of forest-dwelling raptors and their preys. The results further suggest the suitability of territoriality for assessing this potential of novel ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2897145181,"Myocardial computed tomography perfusion (CTP) allows the assessment of the functional relevance of coronary artery stenosis. This study investigates to what extent the contour sharpness of sequences acquired by dynamic myocardial CTP is influenced by the following noise reduction methods: temporal averaging and adaptive iterative dose reduction 3D (AIDR 3D).Dynamic myocardial CT perfusion was conducted in 29 patients at a dose level of 9.5±2.0 mSv and was reconstructed with both filtered back projection (FBP) and strong levels of AIDR 3D. Temporal averaging to reduce noise was performed as a post-processing step by combining two, three, four, six and eight original consecutive 3D datasets. We evaluated the contour sharpness at four distinct edges of the left-ventricular myocardium based on two different approaches: the distance between 25% and 75% of the maximal grey value (d) and the slope in the contour (m).Iterative reconstruction reduced contour sharpness: both measures of contour sharpness performed better for FBP than for AIDR 3D (d = 1.7±0.4 mm versus 2.0±0.5 mm, p>0.059 at all edges; m = 255.9±123.9 HU/mm versus 160.6±123.5 HU/mm; p<0.023 for all edges). Increasing levels of temporal averaging degraded contour sharpness. When FBP reconstruction was applied, contour sharpness was best without temporal averaging (d = 1.7±0.4 mm, m = 255.9±123.9 HU/mm) and poorest for the strongest levels of temporal averaging (d = 2.1±0.3 mm, m = 142.2±104.9 HU/mm; comparison between lowest and highest temporal averaging level: for d p>0.052 at all edges and for m p<0.001 at all edges).The use of both temporal averaging and iterative reconstruction degrades objective contour sharpness parameters of dynamic myocardial CTP. Thus, further advances in image processing are needed to optimise contour sharpness of 4D myocardial CTP."
https://openalex.org/W2897311551,"For managing overactive bladder (OAB), mirabegron, a β3 adrenergic receptor agonist, is typically used as second-line pharmacotherapy after antimuscarinics. Therefore, patients initiating treatment with mirabegron and antimuscarinics may differ, potentially impacting associated clinical outcomes. When using observational data to evaluate real-world safety and effectiveness of OAB treatments, residual bias due to unmeasured confounding and/or confounding by indication are important considerations. Falsification analysis, in which clinically irrelevant endpoints are tested as a reference, can be used to assess residual bias. The objective in this study was to compare baseline cardiovascular risk among OAB patients by treatment, and assess the presence of residual bias via falsification analysis of OAB patients treated with mirabegron or antimuscarinics, to determine whether clinically relevant comparisons across groups would be feasible. Linked electronic health record and claims data (Optum/Humedica) for OAB patients in the United States from 2011-2015 were available, with index defined as first date of OAB treatment during this period. Unadjusted characteristics were compared across groups at index and propensity-matching conducted. Falsification endpoints (hepatitis C, shingles, community-acquired pneumonia) were compared between groups using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The study identified 10,311 antimuscarinic- and 408 mirabegron-treated patients. Mirabegron patients were predominantly older males, with more comorbidities. The analytic sample included 1,188 antimuscarinic patients propensity-matched to 396 mirabegron patients; after matching, no significant baseline differences remained. Estimates of falsification ORs were 0.7 (CI:0.3-1.7) for shingles, 1.5 (CI:0.3-8.2) for hepatitis C, 0.8 (CI:0.4-1.8) and 0.9 (CI:0.6-1.4) for pneumonia. While propensity matching successfully balanced observed covariates, wide CIs prevented definitive conclusions regarding residual bias. Accordingly, further observational comparisons by treatment group were not pursued. In real-world analysis, bias-detection methods could not confirm that differences in cardiovascular risk in patients receiving mirabegron versus antimuscarinics were fully adjusted for, precluding clinically relevant comparisons across treatment groups."
https://openalex.org/W2898037427,"Densin is a scaffold protein known to associate with key elements of neuronal signaling. The present study examines the distribution of densin at the ultrastructural level in order to reveal potential sites that can support specific interactions of densin. Immunogold electron microscopy on hippocampal cultures shows intense labeling for densin at postsynaptic densities (PSDs), but also some labeling at extrasynaptic plasma membranes of soma and dendrites and endoplasmic reticulum. At the PSD, the median distance of label from the postsynaptic membrane was ~27 nm, with the majority of label (90%) confined within 40 nm from the postsynaptic membrane, indicating predominant localization of densin at the PSD core. Depolarization (90 mM K+ for 2 min) promoted a slight shift of densin label within the PSD complex resulting in 77% of label remaining within 40 nm from the postsynaptic membrane. Densin molecules firmly embedded within the PSD may target a minor pool of CaMKII to substrates at the PSD core."

https://openalex.org/W2896341081,"Few prospective studies have explored the effect of interactions among metabolic syndrome (MS) components on the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the Kazakh population in Xinjiang Province of China.As of December 2016, 2,644 participants who completed a baseline survey over a period of 5 years or more were included in the study. The multiplicative interactions among MS components were evaluated by incorporation of the product terms into a logistic regression model. The additive interactions among MS components were evaluated by calculating the additive interaction index. Logistic regression was used to construct a predictive model, and CVD risk level was divided according to the risk probability of the population that did not eventually have CVD.When we analyzed the independent risk of MS and its components on developing CVD, only blood pressure(BP) and waist circumference(WC) were associated with CVD. A linear association was found between the risk of CVD, BP/WC, and the number of other components (trend, P<0.001). The risk of developing CVD increased when BP and WC coexisted, or when combined BP/WC with MS (≥3 components except for BP and WC) was present; however, there were no significant interactions among MS components. After the CVD hazards were divided into four levels, it was showed that over 19.92% of the incidence probability was in the population under mediate-risk while over 35.24% of them was in the high-risk group, respectively.BP and WC were independent risk factors for CVD in the Kazakh population. The risk of CVD was greatly increased when BP and WC coexisted or when combined BP/WC with MS (≥3 components except for BP and WC) was present, but no significant interactions were found among MS components."
https://openalex.org/W2897002272,"Protein Structure Comparison (PSC) is a well developed field of computational proteomics with active interest from the research community, since it is widely used in structural biology and drug discovery. With new PSC methods continuously emerging and no clear method of choice, Multi-Criteria Protein Structure Comparison (MCPSC) is commonly employed to combine methods and generate consensus structural similarity scores. We present pyMCPSC, a Python based utility we developed to allow users to perform MCPSC efficiently, by exploiting the parallelism afforded by the multi-core CPUs of today’s desktop computers. We show how pyMCPSC facilitates the analysis of similarities in protein domain datasets and how it can be extended to incorporate new PSC methods as they are becoming available. We exemplify the power of pyMCPSC using a case study based on the Proteus_300 dataset. Results generated using pyMCPSC show that MCPSC scores form a reliable basis for identifying the true classification of a domain, as evidenced both by the ROC analysis as well as the Nearest-Neighbor analysis. Structure similarity based “Phylogenetic Trees” representation generated by pyMCPSC provide insight into functional grouping within the dataset of domains. Furthermore, scatter plots generated by pyMCPSC show the existence of strong correlation between protein domains belonging to SCOP Class C and loose correlation between those of SCOP Class D. Such analyses and corresponding visualizations help users quickly gain insights about their datasets. The source code of pyMCPSC is available under the GPLv3.0 license through a GitHub repository (https://github.com/xulesc/pymcpsc)."
https://openalex.org/W2897956353,"Objectives Projections of fertility of HIV positive women as ART scales up are needed to plan prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services. We describe differences in exposure to pregnancy between HIV positive and HIV negative women by age, region and national ART coverage to evaluate the extent to which behavioural differences explain lower fertility among HIV positive women and assess whether exposure to pregnancy has changed with antiretroviral treatment (ART) scale-up. Methods We analysed 46 nationally representative household surveys in sub-Saharan Africa conducted between 2003 and 2015 to estimate risk of exposure to recent sex and pregnancy of HIV positive and HIV negative women by age using a log binomial model. We tested for regional and urban/rural differences and associations with national ART coverage. We estimated an adjusted fertility rate ratio of HIV positive to HIV negative women adjusting for differences in exposure to pregnancy. Results Exposure to pregnancy differs significantly between HIV positive and negative women by age, modified by region. Younger HIV positive women have a higher exposure to pregnancy than HIV negative women and the opposite is true at older ages. The switch occurs at 25–29 for rural women and 30–34 for urban women. There was no evidence that exposure to pregnancy of HIV positive women have changed as national ART coverage increased. The inferred rate of fecundity of HIV positive women when adjusted for differences in exposure to pregnancy were lower than unadjusted fertility rate ratios in women aged 20–29 and 20–24 in urban and rural areas respectively varying between 0.6 and 0.9 over regions. Discussion The direct effects of HIV on fertility are broadly similar across ages, while the dramatic age gradient that has frequently been observed is largely attributable to variation in relative sexual exposure by age."
https://openalex.org/W2896419085,"Diabetes mellitus prevalence is increasing rapidly and is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. In addition to the known severe complications associated with the disease, in recent years diabetes has been recognized as a major risk factor for cancer. Patients with diabetes experience significantly higher incidence of and higher mortality rates from many types of cancer. However, to date there are no conclusive data on the pathophysiology underlying the association between these two diseases. We previously reported that insulin regulates skin proliferation and differentiation, while IGF1 had different sometimes contrasting effects to those of insulin, suggesting direct involvement of insulin in transformation. To this end, we developed an epidermal skin-specific insulin receptor knockout (SIRKO) mouse, in which the insulin receptor (IR) is inactivated only in skin, with no other metabolic consequences. We found that IR inactivation by itself resulted in a marked decrease in skin tumorigenesis. In the control group 100% of the mice developed tumors, but in the SIRKO group tumor incidence was over 60% lower, and 25% of the SIRKO mice did not develop tumors at all, and the tumors that did develop were smaller and benign in their appearance. Furthermore, IR inactivation in vitro not only prevented cell transformation but also reversed the keratinocyte-transformed phenotype. We found that IR inactivation led to a striking abnormality in the major keratin cytoskeleton filaments structure in both in vivo and in vitro, a change that we were able to link to the decreased transformation potential in IR-null cells. In summary, we identified a unique pathway in which IR regulates cytoskeletal assembly, thus affecting skin transformation, opening a new potential target for cancer treatment and prevention.—Weingarten, G., BenYaakov, A., Dror, E., Russ, J., Magin, T.
