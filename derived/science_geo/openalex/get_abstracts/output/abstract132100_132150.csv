https://openalex.org/W2122482353,"FADD (also known as Mort-1) is a signal transducer downstream of cell death receptor CD95 (also called Fas). CD95, tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 (TNFR-1), and death receptor 3 (DR3) did not induce apoptosis in FADD-deficient embryonic fibroblasts, whereas DR4, oncogenes E1A and c- myc , and chemotherapeutic agent adriamycin did. Mice with a deletion in the FADD gene did not survive beyond day 11.5 of embryogenesis; these mice showed signs of cardiac failure and abdominal hemorrhage. Chimeric embryos showing a high contribution of FADD null mutant cells to the heart reproduce the phenotype of FADD-deficient mutants. Thus, not only death receptors, but also receptors that couple to developmental programs, may use FADD for signaling."

Application of this method to folding of the Tetrahymena ribozyme revealed that the most stable domain of the tertiary structure, P4-P6, formed cooperatively within 3 seconds. Exterior helices became protected from hydroxyl radicals in 10 seconds, whereas the catalytic center required minutes to be completely folded. The results show that rapid collapse to a partially disordered state is followed by a slow search for the active structure."

Linkage analysis placed this deafness locus, DFNA15, on chromosome 5q31. The human homolog of mouse Pou4f3, a member of the POU-domain family of transcription factors whose targeted inactivation causes profound deafness in mice, was physically mapped to the 25-centimorgan DFNA15-linked region. An 8-base pair deletion in the POU homeodomain of human POU4F3 was identified in Family H. A truncated protein presumably impairs high-affinity binding of this transcription factor in a dominant negative fashion, leading to progressive hearing loss."
https://openalex.org/W2143197614,"Photoactive yellow protein (PYP) is a member of the xanthopsin family of eubacterial blue-light photoreceptors. On absorption of light, PYP enters a photocycle that ultimately transduces the energy contained in a light signal into an altered biological response. Nanosecond time-resolved x-ray crystallography was used to determine the structure of the short-lived, red-shifted, intermediate state denoted [pR], which develops within 1 nanosecond after photoelectronic excitation of the chromophore of PYP by absorption of light. The resulting structural model demonstrates that the [pR] state possesses the cis conformation of the 4-hydroxyl cinnamic thioester chromophore, and that the process of trans to cis isomerization is accompanied by the specific formation of new hydrogen bonds that replace those broken upon excitation of the chromophore. Regions of flexibility that compose the chromophore-binding pocket serve to lower the activation energy barrier between the dark state, denoted pG, and [pR], and help initiate entrance into the photocycle. Direct structural evidence is provided for the initial processes of transduction of light energy, which ultimately translate into a physiological signal."
https://openalex.org/W1985862855,"The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the VEGF-C promote growth of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, respectively. VEGF activates the endothelial VEGF receptors (VEGFR) 1 and 2, and VEGF-C activates VEGFR-3 and VEGFR-2. Both VEGF and VEGF-C are also potent vascular permeability factors. Here we have analyzed the receptor binding and activating properties of several cysteine mutants of VEGF-C including those (Cys156 and Cys165), which in other platelet-derived growth factor/VEGF family members mediate interchain disulfide bonding. Surprisingly, we found that the recombinant mature VEGF-C in which Cys156 was replaced by a Ser residue is a selective agonist of VEGFR-3. This mutant, designated DeltaNDeltaC156S, binds and activates VEGFR-3 but neither binds VEGFR-2 nor activates its autophosphorylation or downstream signaling to the ERK/MAPK pathway. Unlike VEGF-C, DeltaNDeltaC156S neither induces vascular permeability in vivo nor stimulates migration of bovine capillary endothelial cells in culture. These data point out the critical role of VEGFR-2-mediated signal transduction for the vascular permeability activity of VEGF-C and strongly suggest that the redundant biological effects of VEGF and VEGF-C depend on binding and activation of VEGFR-2. The DeltaNDeltaC156S mutant may provide a valuable tool for the analysis of VEGF-C effects mediated selectively via VEGFR-3. The ability of DeltaNDeltaC156S to form homodimers also emphasizes differences in the structural requirements for VEGF and VEGF-C dimerization."
https://openalex.org/W2086253147,"In the magnesium ion–dependent folding of the Tetrahymena ribozyme, a kinetic intermediate accumulates in which the P4-P6 domain is formed, but the P3-P7 domain is not. The kinetic barriers to P3-P7 formation were investigated with the use of in vitro selection to identify mutant RNA molecules in which the folding rate of the P3-P7 domain was increased. The critical mutations disrupt native tertiary interactions within the P4-P6 domain and increase the rate of P3-P7 formation by destabilizing a kinetically trapped intermediate. Hence, kinetic traps stabilized by native interactions, and not simply by mispaired nonnative structures, can present a substantial barrier to RNA folding."
https://openalex.org/W1969929211,"Two closely related IκBα kinases as well as the upstream kinase, NIK, which integrates interleukin-1β (IL-1β)- and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-dependent activation of the transcription factor NF-κB have recently been described. However, in this emerging pathway the role of previously identified components of cytokine-induced NF-κB activation, namely phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C and protein kinase C, remains unclear. We now show that, in A549 human alveolar epithelial cells, the activation of a stably transfected NF-κB-dependent reporter gene by TNF-α and IL-1β is completely blocked by the phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C inhibitor D609 and the protein kinase C inhibitor RO31-8220. However, IL-1β-induced IκBα degradation as well as NF-κB nuclear translocation and DNA binding, as determined by Western blot and electro-mobility shift assay, respectively, are not affected by these inhibitors. A similar effect, although less pronounced, is observed with the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor SB 203580. On the basis of these data we propose the existence of a second signaling pathway induced by IL-1β and TNF-α that is activated in parallel to the cascade leading to IκBα degradation and is specifically required for NF-κB-dependent transcriptional competency.

Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, which play a major role in inflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, rapidly induce NF-κB DNA binding and cause up-regulation of NF-κB-dependent genes, including cyclooxygenase-2 (2Newton R. Kuitert L.M. Bergmann M. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (3Nunokawa Y. Oikawa S. Tanaka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because the potent anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids have been linked to a functional antagonism between the NF-κB subunit p65 and the activated glucocorticoid receptor (4Scheinman R.I. Gualberto A. Jewell C.M. Cidlowski J.A. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 15: 943-953Crossref Google Scholar, 5Mukaida N. Morita M. Ishikawa Y. Rice N. Okamoto S. Kasahara T. Matsushima K. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar), NF-κB activation pathways have attracted much attention as potential targets for new anti-inflammatory strategies. In resting cells, the inhibitory subunit IκBα is bound to the p50/p65 heterodimer of NF-κB in the cytoplasm. Treatment of cells with IL-1β or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α results in the specific phosphorylation of two serine residues on IκBα (7Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Chen Z. Maniatis T. Ballard D.W. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11259-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) followed by the ubiquitination (8Roff M. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Jacque J.M. Baleux F. Arenzana Seisdedos F. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7844-7850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and degradation of this subunit (9Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). This releases active NF-κB, which then translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription. Recently, two closely related kinases that directly phosphorylate IκBα have been described (10DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar, 11Maniatis T. Science. 1997; 278: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 12Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar). In addition, the upstream kinase, where the IL-1β and TNF-α signaling pathways converge prior to IκBα phosphorylation, has been identified as a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase and named NF-κB-inducing kinase (13Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). At present, it remains unclear where other previously identified pathways activated by IL-1β and TNF-α feed into this emerging signal transduction cascade. For example, the phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) as part of the sphingomyelin pathway upstream of the second messenger ceramide has been implicated in TNF activation of NF-κB (14Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). However, the signal transduction pathway leading to nuclear translocation of NF-κB after TNF stimulation was found to be intact in acidic sphingomyelinase-deficient mice (15Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10904-10909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms have also been implicated in NF-κB activation. Transfection of a dominant negative mutant of the atypical isoform PKC-ζ severely impaired the activation of a NF-κB-dependent reporter gene plasmid by sphingomyelin (16Lozano J. Berra E. Municio M.M. Diaz Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Sanz L. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19200-19202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), implicating a role of PKC-ζ downstream of the sphingomyelin pathway. In addition, PKC-ζ was shown to phosphorylate IκBα in vitro (17Diaz Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Sanz L. Dent P. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Hay R.T. Sturgill T.W. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In contrast, the expression of highly purified PKC isoenzymes α, β, γ, δ, ε, and ζ in vivo failed to induce IκBα phosphorylation (18Janosch P. Schellerer M. Seitz T. Reim P. Eulitz M. Brielmeier M. Kolch W. Sedivy J.M. Mischak H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13868-13874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, in vivo studies with constitutively active isoforms demonstrated novel PKC-ε to be a potent inducer of a NF-κB-dependent reporter gene (19Genot E.M. Parker P.J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9833-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In addition to PC-PLC and PKC, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), p38, has been implicated in NF-κB activation, because the selective inhibitor, SB203580, was able to inhibit the activation of a NF-κB-dependent reporter gene by TNF-α. However, NF-κB nuclear translocation and DNA binding was unaffected (20Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). A similar effect has been observed with the protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor genistein, which was able to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription (21Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y.Q. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18306-18309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have used human type II A549 pneumocyte cells to provide evidence of a second signaling pathway that is distinct from IκBα degradation and NF-κB nuclear translocation but is required for NF-κB transcriptional activation by IL-1β and TNF-α. A549 cells obtained from ECACC (code 86012804) were cultured as previously described (22Newton R. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Prior to transfection, cells were grown in T-75 culture flasks to 50–60% confluency. The NF-κB-dependent reporter, 6NF-κBtkluc, contains three tandem repeats of the sequence 5′-AGC TTA CAA GGG ACT TTC CGC TGG GGA CTT TCCAGG GA-3′, which harbors two copies of the NF-κB binding site (underlined) upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter (−105 to +51) driving a luciferase gene as described before (23Israel N. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Aillet F. Virelizier J.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3386-3393PubMed Google Scholar). Neomycin resistance was conferred by ligating a HincII (blunted)/PvuI fragment from pMC1neoPoly(A) (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK) into the PvuI site of 6NF-κBtkluc downstream of the luciferase gene. The resulting plasmid was named 6NF-κBtkluc.neo. Cells were washed with serum-free medium and incubated with medium containing 8 μg of plasmid and Tfx50 (Promega, UK) for 2 h. Subsequently, cells were cultured in fresh medium for 16 h before adding 0.5 mg/ml G-418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Foci of stable transfected cells developed after approximately 14 days of culture in the presence of G-418. To create a heterogeneous population with regard to integration site, multiple clones were then harvested and used for experiments for another eight passages while maintained in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G-418. Cells were stimulated with IL-1β and TNF-α (R & D Systems, Oxon, UK) at 1 and 10 ng/ml, respectively. Where used, RO31-8220 (Alexis, Nottingham, UK), SB203580, herbimycin A, and D609 (Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK) were added 5 min prior to stimulation. Cells were harvested 6 or 24 h later and assayed for luciferase activity using a commercially available luciferase reporter gene assay (Promega). RNA isolation, reverse transcription, PCR primers, conditions, and cycling parameters for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were as described previously (24Newton R. Kuitert L.M. Slater D.M. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Life Sci. 1997; 60: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Luciferase primers were: 5′-GAG AGC AAC TGC ATA AGG CTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAC ATC GAC TGA AAT CCC TGG-3′ (reverse) (accession number M15077). Cycling parameters were: 94 °C, 20 s; 60 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s. The number of amplification cycles used was the number necessary to achieve exponential amplification where product formation is proportional to starting cDNA, and in each case this was determined as described (24Newton R. Kuitert L.M. Slater D.M. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Life Sci. 1997; 60: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Following amplification, products (10 μl) were run on 2.0% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. After densitometry, data were expressed as the ratio of luciferase/GAPDH as a percentage of IL-1β treated as means ± S.E. Because the transfected luciferase gene has no introns, identical control amplifications were performed from similar reverse transcriptions in which the reverse transcriptase had been omitted. In these cases no product was visible, indicating that any genomic contamination was below detectable levels (data not shown). A549 cells were grown to confluency in 6-well plates and incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h prior to treatment. Nuclear protein was isolated 1 h after stimulation with 1 ng/ml IL-1β or 10 ng/ml TNF-α as described previously (22Newton R. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Where used, inhibitors were added 5 min prior to stimulation. The consensus NF-κB (5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG-3′) and Oct-1 (TGT CGA ATG CAA ATC ACT AGA) probe were obtained from Promega. Specificity was determined by prior addition of 100-fold excess unlabeled consensus oligonucleotide. Reactions were separated on 7% native acrylamide gels before vacuum drying and autoradiography. Confluent A549 cells grown in 6-well plates were stimulated for the indicated times and harvested in 200 μl of lysing buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 0.75% deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris-base, 75 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.5 mm PMSF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 1.25 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate). Prior to loading onto 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels, samples were denatured by boiling for 5 min. Gels were run at 200 mA for 40 min at 25 °C. Proteins were transferred onto Hybond-ECL nitro-cellulose paper (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) in blotting buffer (20 mm Tris-base, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol) at 400 mA for 1 h at 25 °C. Membranes were blocked for 1 h with a 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk solution in TBS/T (10 mmTris-base, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) before incubating the filter for 1 h with rabbit polyclonal anti-human IκBα (clone C21, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:1000. Membranes were washed five times with TBS/T and incubated for a further hour with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked IgG (Dako, Bucks, UK) diluted 1:4000. After another five washes, antibody-labeled proteins were detected by ECL as described by the manufacturer (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). Induction of two p50/p65 NF-κB DNA binding complexes by IL-1β and TNF-α has previously been shown in these cells (2Newton R. Kuitert L.M. Bergmann M. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 22Newton R. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects on κB-dependent transcription, a NF-κB-dependent reporter, 6NF-κBtkluc.neo, was stably transfected into A549 cells. As shown in Fig.1, the PTK inhibitor herbimycin A (25Kuo M.L. Chau Y.P. Wang J.H. Lin P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the PC-PLC inhibitor D609 (14Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar), the PKC inhibitor RO31-8220 (26Wilkinson S.E. Parker P.J. Nixon J.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 335-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (27Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar) inhibited both the IL-1β and TNF-α stimulation of NF-κB-dependent luciferase activity at concentrations previously shown to be selectively effective. The MAPK/extracellular regulated kinase kinase-1/2 inhibitor, PD 098059, at 10 μm, which potently inhibits downstream activation of the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)1 and ERK2 (28Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar), and the PTK inhibitor, genistein (21Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y.Q. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18306-18309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), at 100 μm had no effect on luciferase activity induced by IL-1β or TNF-α (data not shown). TableI depicts the EC50 for the various inhibitors; results are in the range of previously reported selectively active concentrations (see references cited above). Vehicle, 1 μl/ml Me2SO, had no effect on luciferase activity after IL-1β or TNF-α stimulation. Inhibitors alone had no effect on luciferase activity (data not shown).Table IEC50 of different inhibitors on IL-1β and TNF-α induced NF-κB-dependent transcriptionStimulusRO31–8220D609SB 203580Herbimycin AμmIL-1β (1 ng/ml)1.03112 (25.5 μg/ml)1.31.01TNF-α (10 ng/ml)0.8676 (17.4 μg/ml)1.833.93 Open table in a new tab To examine the effect of these inhibitors on NF-κB nuclear translocation and DNA binding electro mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed. IL-1β-induced NF-κB DNA binding was only slightly altered by the nonselective PTK inhibitor herbimycin A, whereas the potent inhibitors of NF-κB-dependent transcription, RO31-8220, SB203580, and D609, had no effect (Fig.2 A). Specificity of the complex was shown by competing out the signal with a 100-fold excess of cold competitor (data not shown). Neither IL-1β nor any of the inhibitors under investigation had an effect on DNA binding activity of the noninducible transcription factor Oct-1 (data not shown). Likewise induction of NF-κB DNA binding by TNF-α was also unaffected by RO31-8220, D609, and SB203580 (Fig. 2 B). Because the changes in luciferase activity were observed at 24 h and the lack of change in NF-κB DNA binding was after a 1-h treatment, there remained the possibility that these drugs exert their effects by changing the longer term levels of active NF-κB. However, because the reporter assay produced identical data after a 6-h treatment, this possibility seemed remote (data not shown). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to further examine this question. Consistent with the luciferase activity data, both RO31-8220 and D609 showed total repression of IL-1β-induced luciferase mRNA following a 1-h incubation (Fig.2 C). These data indicate that the changes in luciferase expression were the result of immediate changes in κB-dependent transcription and not due to effects on p50 or p65 expression or luciferase translation. Because NF-κB DNA binding was unaffected, these data suggest that phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα would also be unaffected by these compounds. The time course of IL-1β-induced IκBα degradation and resynthesis is shown in Fig.3. The IκBα signal is lost by 15 min post-stimulation except for a retarded band indicating phosphorylated but as yet undegraded IκBα. RO31-8220 and SB203580 appeared to have little effect on loss of IκBα, whereas D609 seemed to result in a marginally reduced loss of IκBα. These data are consistent with the EMSA data indicating no substantial effect of these compounds on NF-κB activation. By contrast both D609 and RO31-8220 delayed, by 30 and 60 min, respectively, the reappearance of IL-1β-induced IκBα, whereas SB203580 had no obvious effect. A significant step toward understanding the mechanism of NF-κB activation was the recent identification of two related IκBα kinases (IKKα and IKKβ) and the upstream kinase, NF-κB-inducing kinase, integrating IL-1β- and TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (reviewed in Refs. 11Maniatis T. Science. 1997; 278: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 29Stancovski I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 91: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, and 30Wallach D. Boldin M. Varfolomeev E. Beyaert R. Vandenabeele P. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, because the pathways leading to IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent degradation are characterized in some detail now, the role of other previously identified components of cytokine-mediated NF-κB activation is becoming less clear. By employing a NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene stably transfected into the human alveolar epithelial cell line A549, the compounds D609, RO31-8220, and SB203580 selective for the sphingomyelin, PKC, and p38 MAPK pathways, respectively, were shown to be potent inhibitors of NF-κB-dependent transcription after IL-1β or TNF-α stimulation. However, neither of these inhibitors had an effect on IκBα degradation or NF-κB nuclear translocation and DNA binding. We therefore propose the existence of a second pathway triggered by TNF-α and IL-1β in parallel to IκBα degradation, which confers NF-κB transcriptional competency. In the same assay system the PTK inhibitor herbimycin A was able to partially inhibit both the luciferase activity and DNA binding as determined by EMSA. The PTK inhibitor genistein, previously reported to inhibit NF-κB transactivation induced by lipopolysaccharide in a pro-monocytic cell line (21Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y.Q. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18306-18309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), had no effect on NF-κB-dependent transcription in our model. The PTK p59fyn is a possible target for these inhibitors, because it was shown to be involved in NF-κB-mediated activation of the HIV long terminal repeat promoter (31Hohashi N. Hayashi T. Fusaki N. Takeuchi M. Higurashi M. Okamoto T. Semba K. Yamamoto T. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1851-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Discrepant findings with different PTK inhibitors as shown here for genistein and herbimycin A were recently described for the regulation of inducible nitric-oxide synthase mRNA in primary rat hepatocytes involving the PTK pp60c-src (25Kuo M.L. Chau Y.P. Wang J.H. Lin P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), suggesting different target proteins for each inhibitor. In contrast to the partial effect exercised by herbimycin A and SB203580, the PC-PLC inhibitor D609 completely abolished NF-κB-dependent reporter gene activation by IL-1β and TNF α at doses of 50 μg/ml. The sphingomyelin pathway with its second mediator ceramide has previously been implicated in TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (14Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). At doses of 100 μg/ml, D609 completely inhibited PC-PLC; however, doses of 250 μg/ml only partially affected NF-κB DNA binding (14Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). In contrast, the EC50 for the D609 effect on NF-κB-dependent transcription in this study is similar to the one calculated from the dose response curve for TNF-α-activated PC-PLC (14Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Taking the data concerning the time course of IκBα degradation presented here into account, we conclude that the inhibitory effect of D609 on NF-κB activation is only marginally due to the inhibition of IκBα degradation and nuclear translocation. More importantly, D609, at doses that abolish PC-PLC activity completely, inhibits NF-κB-dependent transcription induced by IL-1β and TNF-α. The delayed resynthesis of IκBα observed here supports this view, because the IκBα promoter contains multiple NF-κB sites responsible for conferring TNF-α inducibility (32Le Bail O. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5043-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 33Ito C.Y. Kazantsev A.G. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3787-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Importantly, this hypothesis would also explain recent findings in sphingomyelinase-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, where TNF-α-induced IκBα degradation and NF-κB nuclear translocation was unaffected (15Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10904-10909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, Zumbansen and Stoffel (15Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10904-10909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) questioned any role for acidic sphingomyelinase, which is downstream of PC-PLC (14Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). However, NF-κB transactivation competency was not investigated and may be the crucial step mediated by PC-PLC and sphingomyelinase in response to TNF-α. The specificity of D609 for PC-PLC has recently been challenged by data showing the inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor-activated phospholipase D as well as PC-PLC (34van Dijk M.C. Muriana F.J. de Widt J. Hilkmann H. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11011-11016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, TNF-α-induced phopholipase D activity was not affected by D609 (14Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar), raising the possibility of a platelet-derived growth factor-specific effect. Data concerning the role of PKC isoforms in TNF-α- or IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation have been conflicting. Here we find that the PKC-inhibitor RO31-8220 was able to completely block NF-κB-dependent transcription yet failed to block NF-κB nuclear translocation and DNA binding or IκBα degradation. The marked delay in IL-1β-dependent IκBα resynthesis further supports the hypothesis of a selective effect on NF-κB transcriptional competency. However, evidence for the involvement of PKC isoforms is only indirect, because RO31-8220 is not selective for PKC isoenzymes (36Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 37Yeo E.J. Provost J.J. Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1356: 308-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Both MAPK-activated protein kinase 1β and p70 S6 kinase, which are activated in response to growth factors and phorbol esters, are also inhibited (36Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Whether other kinases activated by cytokines are inhibited remains unclear. The cross-reactivity toward MAPK-activated protein kinase 1β was examined by testing the MAPK/extracellular regulated kinase kinase-1/2 specific inhibitor PD 098059, which blocks the upstream activation of ERK1 and ERK2. PD 098059 had no effect on NF-κB-dependent transcription. In summary, PC-PLC and PKC isoforms appear to be involved in a TNF-α- and IL-1β-induced pathway of NF-κB transcriptional activation that is distinct from the signaling pathway leading to IκBα degradation, NF-κB nuclear translocation, and DNA binding. Because cytokine-mediated phosphorylation of NF-κB subunits is shown to occur for p65 after TNF-α stimulation of HeLa cells (38Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and a serine kinase, which specifically phosphorylates NF-κB subunits and not IκBα, has been described (39Hayashi T. Sekine T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26790-26795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we speculate that both D609 and RO31-8220 may prevent p65 phosphorylation and lead to reduced transcriptional activity. Furthermore, Mercurio et al. (12Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar) identified a RelA kinase activity that was associated with the IKK signalsome and supports the hypothesis that cytokine-dependent phosphorylation of p65 (RelA) may be required for transcriptional activity. However, regulated phosphorylation of NF-κB subunits has been tested for the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (20Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), and no change in NF-κB subunit phosphorylation was detected. Because the inhibition of NF-κB-dependent transcription by SB 203580 was the least pronounced effect observed in this study, future work needs to specifically address the effect of D609 and RO31-8220 on NF-κB subunit phosphorylation."

This report describes the properties of a new set of peptides from Anemonia sulcata that act as blockers of a specific member of the Kv3 potassium channel family. These toxins, blood depressing substance (BDS)-I and BDS-II, are 43 amino acids long and differ at only two positions. They share no sequence homologies with other K+ channel toxins from sea anemones, such as AsKS, AsKC, ShK, or BgK. In COS-transfected cells, the Kv3.4 current was inhibited in a reversible manner by BDS-I, with an IC50value of 47 nm. This inhibition is specific because BDS-I failed to block other K+ channels in the Kv1, Kv2, Kv3, and Kv4 subfamilies. Inward rectifier K+ channels are also insensitive to BDS-I. BDS-I and BDS-II share the same binding site on brain synaptic membranes, with K0.5 values of 12 and 19 nm, respectively. We observed that BDS-I and BDS-II have some sequence homologies with other sea anemone Na+ channels toxins, such as AsI, AsII, and AxI. However, they had a weak effect on tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+channels in neuroblastoma cells and no effect on Na+channels in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells.

Kv channels are the most numerous and diversified ion channel structures. More than 20 mammalian genes encoding the α subunits of Kv channels have now been cloned and expressed. They differ in their gating mechanisms, ion conduction properties, and regulation (22Pongs O. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: S69-S88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 535-555Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Although they are structurally similar, K+ channels can be separated into four distinct classes based on the degree of amino acid sequence homology with α subunits encoded by the Drosophila Shaker (Kv1), Shab (Kv2), Shaw (Kv3), and Shal (Kv4), loci (24Perney T.M.

Many other types of K+ channels, such as Kv1.4, Kv1.5, or many of the Shaw- and Shal-related Kv channels, do not yet have a specific and high affinity pharmacology despite the recent discovery of many new K+ channel toxins (13Swartz K.J.

This study reports the identification of two 43-amino acid peptides from the sea anemone Anemonia sulcata, which represent the first specific blockers for the rapidly inactivating Kv3.4 channel. The purification started with a previously described chromatographic procedure (8Schweitz H. Bruhn T. Guillemare E. Moinier D. Lancelin J.-M. Béress L. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

We found that it displayed a blocking activity against the K+ current expressed by Xenopus oocytes injected with the Kv3.4 channel. This fraction was then chromatographied on a cation exchange column TSK/SP 5PW (7.5 × 75 mm) (Toyosoda, Tokyo, Japan) with 1% acetic acid as solvent A and 1 m ammonium acetate as solvent B. The AsF28 fraction (10 mg) was loaded onto the column equilibrated with 30% solvent B. An inactive material eluted for 50 min, and then three peaks were eluted in a gradient from 30 to 100% solvent B in 20 min. The last two peaks contained the Kv3.4 potassium channel blocking activity. They were pooled and loaded on a Hypersil BDS column (4.6 × 250 mm), C18, 5 μm particle diameter (Shandon). Elution was performed with a linear gradient in 40 min from 10 to 50% acetonitrile in water complemented with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Activity was found in the third peak, which was both the sharpest and the highest. The primary structure of the peptide was determined by Edman degradation of the complete peptide using an Applied Biosystems model 477 A microsequencer. The native peptide was reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol and pyridylethylated with 4-vinylpyridine before sequencing. Rat brain synaptic membranes were prepared as described by Jones and Matus (33Jones D.H. Matus A.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 356: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). BDS-I was iodinated by the IODO-GEN method (Pierce). Three nanomoles were mixed with 0.5 nm of125I-labeled sodium (2000 Ci/mmol; 1 Ci = 37 GBq; NEN Life Science Products) and buffered at pH 7.5 with 100 mmTris-HCl in an Eppendorf tube coated with 1 nm of IODO-GEN (total volume, 40 μl). After a 15-min incubation, free iodine was quenched with 500 μl of bovine serum albumin in 0.1% TFA (solvent A). 125I-BDS-I was separated from native BDS-I by high performance liquid chromatography on a Spherisorb ODS1 5 μm (250 × 4.1-mm) Interchrom column (Interchim, Asnières, France) at 1 ml/min with a gradient from 20 to 50% solvent B in 60 min, where solvent B was 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile. 125I-BDS-I eluted between 50 and 55 min, after native BDS-I. Fractions (1 ml) were neutralized and stabilized by addition of 100 μl of a mixture containing bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml) and sodium azide (2 mg/ml) in 1 m Tris, pH 7.4. They were aliquoted and kept frozen at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad assay with bovine serum albumin used as a standard. The buffer used for incubations contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 1.3 mm MgSO4, 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin and 0.2 mg/ml of sodium azide as a bacteriostatic. For the dose-response curves, series of predilutions (10 times as concentrated as that in the incubation medium) were done with pure water in low protein absorption tubes. Incubations were carried out for 3 h at room temperature, and then the samples were diluted with 2 ml of cold washing buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and filtered on Whatman GF/C filters that had been presoaked with 0.5% polyethyleneimine at pH 7.4 and washed with 5 ml of washing buffer before use. The samples were washed twice with 5 ml of washing buffer, and the radioactivity retained on the filters was counted.

Xenopus laevis specimens were purchased from Centre de Recherches en Biochimic Macromoléculaire (CRBM) (Montpellier, France). Pieces of the ovary were surgically removed, and individual oocytes were dissected away in a saline solution (ND96) containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES at pH 7.4 with NaOH. Stage V and VI oocytes were treated for 2 h with collagenase (1 mg/ml, type Ia, Sigma) in ND96 to discard follicular cells. cRNA solutions were injected (5–100 ng/μl, 50 nl/oocyte) using a pressure microinjector. This laboratory has previously shown that a high level of expression of some cloned K+ channels could lead to high magnitude K+currents with major variations in their kinetics, pharmacological sensitivities, and voltage-dependences as compared with currents of lower intensity (29Guillemare E.

Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, particular attention was given to comparison of currents of similar and relatively low intensities (below 3 μA for a test pulse at +30 mV). The oocytes were kept at 19 °C in the ND96 saline solution supplemented with gentamycin (5 μg/ml). Oocytes were studied within 2–4 days following injection of cRNA. In a 0.3-ml perfusion chamber, a single oocyte was impaled with two standard glass microelectrodes (1–2.5 MΩ resistance) filled with 3 m KCl and maintained under voltage-clamp using a Dagan TEV 200 amplifier. Stimulation of the preparation, data acquisition and analysis were performed using pClamp software (Axon Instruments). All experiments were performed at room temperature (21–22 °C) in ND96 solutions. Drugs were systematically applied externally by gently puffing 100 μl of drug solution near the oocyte. Control puffs revealed no mechanical effects on Kv currents. COS M6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (60 μg/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). Two days before transfection, 20,000 cells were plated on coverslips onto 35-mm Petri dishes. The cells were transfected by a modification of the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method (35Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Sollner-Webb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) using 0.01 μg of super-coiled pRc/CMV Kv3.4 plasmid DNA to have low density expression of Kv3.4 channel. Currents were recorded within 1–2 days following transfection. Rat dorsal root ganglion neurons were dissected from 2-day-old postnatal embryos. Cells were plated at a density of 20,000 cells per 35-mm-diameter Petri dish. The pipette solution used in voltage-clamp experiments for K+ current recordings in COS M6 cells was 150 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4. For action potential measurements, the pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3. For Na+ currents in N1E-115 cells and Ca2+ currents in dorsal root ganglion cells, the composition was 150 mmCsCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmEGTA, 10 mm HEPES-CsOH, pH 7.4. The extracellular solution composition for K+ currents recordings in COS M6 cells was 5 mm KCl, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 3 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4. For action potential measurements, the composition was 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4. The composition for Na+ currents was 120 mmNaCl, 25 mm TEACl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4. For Ca2+ currents, it was 124 mm TEACl, 10 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES-TEAOH, pH 7.4. 0.1% bovine serum albumin was added in BDS-containing solutions to prevent its adsorption onto containers. The initial purpose of this work was to find new specific and sufficiently high affinity ligands for K+ channels that have no specific pharmacology as yet. As a first step, we tested more than 200 peptidic fractions from the venom of different snakes, scorpions, spiders, and sea anemones on K+ currents recorded in Xenopusoocytes injected with cRNA from different cloned K+channels, and we found interesting activities in A. sulcataextracts. A. sulcata venom has previously been shown to contain two classes of K+ channel blockers for the Shaker subfamily, kaliseptine (AsKS) and kalicludines (AsKCs); the latter is structurally similar to DTXs from snake venoms (8Schweitz H.

Other blockers of the DTX-sensitive Kv channels have been found in other sea anemone species (1Harvey A.L. Rowan E.G. Vatanpour H. Young L.C. Castaneda O. Mebs D. Cervenansky C. Karlsson E.

We observed that a peptidic fraction (AsF28, 1 mg/ml) that we had previously purified from A. sulcata when searching for other K+ channel toxins (see Fig. 1A in Ref. 8Schweitz H. Bruhn T. Guillemare E. Moinier D. Lancelin J.-M. Béress L. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25121-25126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) produced more than a 50% inhibition of the Kv3.4 current recorded in Xenopus oocytes. This was a preliminary indication that this venom contained a component (or components) that blocked a K+ channel belonging to a subfamily different from Shaker. The AsF28 fraction (10 mg) was then separated as described under “Experimental Procedures”; this led to the isolation of a pure peptide active on the Kv3.4 channel. The active component was reduced, pyridylethylated, and subjected to Edman degradation to determine its primary structure (Fig.1 A).This peptide is identical to BDS-II and very similar to BDS-I, two peptides that had been previously purified from A. sulcata extracts by Béress et al. (39Béress, L., Doppelfeld, I.-S., Etschenberg, E., Graf, E., Henschen, A., and Zwick, J. (January 17, 1985) Federal Republic of Germany Patent DE 33 24 689 A1.Google Scholar) and that had been described as blood pressure-depressing substances in the cat but apparently not in other animal species (39Béress, L., Doppelfeld, I.-S., Etschenberg, E., Graf, E., Henschen, A., and Zwick, J. (January 17, 1985) Federal Republic of Germany Patent DE 33 24 689 A1.Google Scholar, 40Llewellyn L.E. Norton R.S. Biochem. Int. 1991; 24: 937-946PubMed Google Scholar). BDS-I differs from BDS-II at only two positions (Ser-7 instead of Pro and Gly-11 instead of Asp) (Fig.1 A). Both peptides have 43 amino acids and are cross-linked by three disulfide bridges. Their molecular absorbency at 280 nm is ε280 = 16910, and their molecular weights are 4715 for BDS-I and 4783 for BDS-II. The primary amino acid sequence of BDS-I and BDS-II is compared in Fig. 1 A with those of other well known sea anemone toxins active on voltage-dependent Na+ channels. BDS-I displays only 24–26% identity with toxins AsI (ATX-I), AsII (ATX-II), and AsV (ATX-V) from A. sulcata and AxI (AP-A) from Anthopleura xanthogrammica. All four peptides behave as selective and high affinity effectors of voltage-sensitive Na+ channels and slow down Na+ current inactivation (41Frelin C. Vigne P. Schweitz H. Lazdunski M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 70-74PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences of BDS-I and BDS-II and those of identified Na+ channel toxins have a total of six cysteines, with five cysteines at identical positions and one cysteine at a different position (Fig. 1 A). These cysteines residues are known to form disulfide bridges (42Driscoll P.C. Clore G.M. Béress L. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2178-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 43Driscoll P.C. Gronenborn A.M. Béress L. Clore G.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2188-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 44Mabbutt B.C. Norton R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 45Widmer H. Wagner G. Schweitz H. Lazdunski M. Wuthrich K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 177-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Due to their apparent overall structural similarities with toxins active on Na+ channels, BDS-I (the most abundant) (100 nm) was tested for its possible activity against these channels. First, it had only small effects on TTX-sensitive Na+ channels from neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 1 B). Even at a high concentration of 500 nm BDS-I, the slowing down of Na+ channel inactivation was much smaller than that observed with AsII or AxI at the same concentration. Both AsII and AxI were active on cardiac Na+ channels. The toxin-induced slowing down of the inactivation of cardiac Na+ channels led to an inotropic action of the two toxins (46Renaud J.F. Fosset M. Schweitz H. Lazdunski M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 120: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). BDS-I and BDS-II were also tested for their possible positive inotropic action on isolated cardiac organ. No modifications in amplitude and frequency of rat and guinea-pig atria contractions were observed with 1 μm of BDS-I or BDS-II (n = 2–6). AsII was also active on TTX-resistant Na+ channels in myotubes. Action potentials recorded in rat myotubes were not modified by 1 μm BDS-I, but they were drastically prolonged by AsII (100 nm; data not shown). None of the three Na+channel toxins, AsI, AsII, or AxI, at a concentration of 10 μm, was able to inhibit the Kv3.4 current (n = 3; data not shown). The effect of BDS-I was also tested on voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Perfusion of 1 μm BDS-I failed to affect low or high voltage-activated Ca2+ currents recorded in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons (n = 6; data not shown). BDS-I, in particular, was analyzed for its ability to block a variety of K+ channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The specificity of BDS-I for channels of the Shaw subfamily was first analyzed by assaying its possible action on different members of other families of K+ channels, such as the Shaker family (Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, Kv1.4, and Kv1.5), the Shab family (Kv2.1 and Kv2.2), and the Shalfamily (Kv4.2 and Kv4.3). The sensitivity to the toxin of inward rectifier K+ channels, such as IRK1, IRK2, and ROMK1, was also tested. None of these cloned channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes (n = 3–6 for each channel type) was significantly affected by BDS-I. In the Shawfamily, only one member, Kv3.4, was extensively inhibited by BDS-I (Fig. 2). These results clearly show that BDS-I has a particularly high specificity for the Kv3.4 channel as compared with other K+ channels. The pharmacological effect of BDS-I and BDS-II was then analyzed in more detail in COS cell lines transiently transfected with a Kv3.4-expressing plasmid. Whole cell voltage-clamp recordings indicated a high level of expression of Kv3.4 channels, with current amplitudes ranging from 500 pA to 6 nA for depolarizing pulses from −80 to +50 mV. Kv3.4 currents recorded from high density transfected cells (>0.01 μg of Kv3.4 plasmid per 35-mm-diameter Petri dish) displayed noninactivating kinetics and a lower sensitivity to BDS-I and BDS-II. This phenomenon has already been demonstrated for delayed rectifier Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 channels, which displayed a much lower sensitivity to toxins when high cRNA concentrations were injected in Xenopus oocytes, resulting in high current levels (29Guillemare E. Honoré E. Pradier L. Lesage F. Schweitz H. Attali B. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12463-12468Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31Honoré E. Attali B. Romey G. Lesage F. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, particular attention was paid to the analysis of the effect of the toxin in cells expressing Kv3.4 currents of relatively lower intensities (under 2 nA for a test pulse at +50 mV) and rapidly inactivating kinetics, which probably correspond to the normal function of these K+ channels (47Schroter K.H. Ruppersberg J.P. Wunder F. Rettig J. Stockler M. Pongs O. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, currents induced by a series of depolarizing pulses at −20 to +50 mV in 10-mV steps from a holding potential of −80 mV rapidly evoked an inactivating outward Kv3.4 current (τinac = 17 ± 8 ms; n = 19 at +50 mV; Fig.3 A) very similar to that recorded in Xenopus oocytes. Inhibition of the Kv3.4 current, induced by a perfusion with 50 nm BDS-I, was not voltage-dependent (Fig. 3 A). The time course of the block and the reversibility is presented in Fig. 3 B. Inhibition developed after 1–2 min of toxin application. Extensive recovery occurred during the 5–6-min period after completion of the toxin exposure. The concentration dependence of the inhibitory effect of BDS-I and BDS-II on Kv3.4 currents is presented in Fig.3 C. This curve indicates a 1:1 association of the two partners, with IC50 values of 47 and 56 nm for BDS-I and BDS-II, respectively. Voltage-clamp studies carried out in outside-out patches from COS-transfected cells showed that a rapid inhibition of Kv3.4 current occurred when BDS-I or BDS-II was applied to th"

This was possible through the use of rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction (RACE-PCR) in which the 5′ sequence of the human gastric mucin cDNA HGM-1 (1Klomp L. van Rens L.

Primers for subsequent rounds of RACE were designed from the 5′-ends of amplified RACE products. After five rounds of RACE-PCR, we could no longer generate upstream extensions of the cDNA and hypothesized that we had reached the 5′-end. Primer extension and RNase protection analysis confirmed this. Combined nucleotide sequence for the RACE-PCR products was 3.3 kb with an open reading frame encoding 1100 amino acids. A putative translation start site was found at nucleotide +48. This was followed by a 45 nucleotide putative signal sequence. This amino-terminal sequence contains no tandem repeats but is >60% similar to the amino-terminal nucleotide sequence of MUC2. The positions of cysteine residues in this MUC2-similar region are almost 100% conserved between the two genes. Northern analysis showed expression of cognate RNA in the stomach and airway but not muscle and esophagus. This pattern was the same as that obtained using previously reported 3′-MUC5ACsequences.

Mucin is a glycoprotein secreted from epithelial cells at many body surfaces. In the airways, mucin interacts with cilia to trap and clear pathogens and irritants. This mucociliary mechanism is impaired when mucin is produced excessively as in cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, and asthma. Mucociliary impairment leads to airway mucus plugging, which promotes chronic infection, airflow obstruction, and sometimes death.Nine mucin genes are known to be expressed in man: MUC1-4, MUC5AC, MUC5B, MUC6-8 (2Gendler S.J.

Insofar as DNA-RNA transcription is controlled by mechanisms amenable to pharmaceutical intervention, an understanding of mucin transcription may suggest ways of inhibiting mucin overproduction.Both MUC2 and MUC5AC map to chromosome 11p15.5 and may have arisen from a common ancestral gene. The structure of MUC2 is known. Its central region, comprising >50% of the polypeptide, contains two tandem repeat sequences rich in threonine, serine, and proline (4Gum J.R. Byrd J.C. Hicks J.W.

Strous G. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This cDNA likely derives from MUC5AC as nucleotides 1942–2281 are 99% similar to the MUC5AC clone JUL 32 (19Guyonnet-Duperat V. Audie J. Debailleul V. Laine A. Buisine M. Galiegue-Zouitina S.

J. 1995; 308: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the ∼8% discrepancy between HGM-1 and NP3a suggests that portions of HGM-1 are repeated twice in MUC5AC. HGM-1's similarity to NP3a would place one HGM-1-like sequence near the 3′-end since NP3a contains a polyadenylation signal; its ∼60% similarity to the MUC2 D3-domain (1Klomp L. van Rens L. Strous G. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) would place another HGM-1-like sequence near the 5′-end since the MUC2 D3 domain is within 3 kb of the MUC2 transcription start site (17Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J. Toribara N. Siddiki B. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hypothesizing that HGM-1 itself is present near the MUC5AC5′-end, we used an HGM-1 sequence as the first gene-specific primer in repetitive 5′-RACE-PCR reactions. This approach ultimately permitted amplification of a 3.3-kb upstream extension of HGM-1, which we call MUC5AC-5′-RACE product (MUC5AC-5′RP). Primer extension, RNase protection assays, and the presence of a translation start site and putative signal sequence indicate that this sequence is at the gene's 5′-end. Genomic DNA immediately upstream of MUC5AC-5′RP has the structural properties of a promoter and contains elements mediating transcriptional up-regulation in response to bacterial exoproducts. We conclude that our cloned sequences are the amino-terminal and 5′-flanking region of MUC5AC. The availability of these sequences should aid identification of the elements controlling MUC5AC overexpression in disease.DISCUSSIONIn this series of studies, we isolated the amino terminus and 5′-flanking region of the MUC5AC mucin gene as a first step toward understanding the dysregulation of mucin mRNA production in the airways of cystic fibrosis patients. Hypothesizing that the previously reported cDNA HGM-1 was relatively upstream in the MUC5AC sequence, we performed progressive RACE-PCR amplifications that eventually reached the transcription start site. We used a similar approach to isolate the 5′-flanking region from genomic DNA.Evidence That HGM-1 and Its 5′-RACE Extended Product Are Part of MUC5ACHGM-1 is a human gastric mucin cDNA (1Klomp L. van Rens L.

The cysteine-rich domains in mucins show varying degrees of similarity to the D-domains of von Willebrand factor.The evidence that HGM-1 is part of MUC5AC essentially rests on the observation that HGM-1 nucleotides 1942–2281 are 99% similar to the MUC5AC clone JUL 32 (19Guyonnet-Duperat V. Audie J. Debailleul V. Laine A. Buisine M. Galiegue-Zouitina S. Pigny P. Degand P. Aubert J.-P. Porchet N. Biochem. J. 1995; : 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and nucleotides 2190–2541 are 92% similar to the 5′-end of MUC5AC clone NP3a (1Klomp L. van Rens L. Strous G. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). By the same reasoning, HGM-1's extended 5′ sequence MUC5AC-5′RP is also part of MUC5AC.Evidence That the MUC5AC RACE-PCR Product Contains the Gene's 5′-EndThat 5′-RACE-PCR yielded products with identical 5′-ends after several successive amplifications regardless of whether stomach or airway cDNA was used as a template, first suggested we had reached the 5′-end. The results of subsequent primer extension and RNase protection assays supported this. Further support was provided by characteristics of the DNA both upstream and downstream of the putative transcription start site: 25 bp upstream of the start site is a TATA box, and 48 bp downstream is a putative translation start codon (ATG) embedded in a Kozak consensus sequence (24Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by a 45-bp signal sequence.Current Model of MUC5ACThe overall structure of MUC5AC, as pieced together from evidence currently available, is compared with the structure of MUC2 in Fig.9. The structure of the MUC5ACcarboxyl terminus has been known since the cloning of NP3a, a cDNA isolated from a nasal polyp library. Its identification as part of MUC5AC rests on the fact that cDNAs containing part of the NP3a sequence had previously been designated as MUC5(25Aubert J.-P. Porchet N. Crepin M. Duterque-Coquillaud M. Vergnes G. Mazzuca M. Debuire B. Petiprez D. Degand P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 175-185Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and were later designated as MUC5AC (19Guyonnet-Duperat V. Audie J. Debailleul V. Laine A. Buisine M. Galiegue-Zouitina S. Pigny P. Degand P. Aubert J.-P. Porchet N. Biochem. J. 1995; : 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) The recognition that NP3a comprises the gene's 3′-end rests on its containing a polyadenylation signal and poly(A) tail. It also contains a homologue of the MUC2 D-domain 4 (8Meezaman D. Charles P. Daskal E. Polymeropoulos M. Martin B. Rose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12932-12939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar cDNA, L31, was isolated from an HT29 (colon carcinoma) cell library (9Lesuffleur T. Roche F. Hill A. Lacasa M. Fox M. Swallow D. Zweibaum A. Real F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13665-13673Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Other than the positioning of NP3a and L31 at the 3′-end, it has not been possible to assign any of the other known MUC5ACcDNAs to particular positions in the coding sequence. cDNAs containing threonine/serine/proline-rich repetitive sequences (JER 47, JER 58, Mar 2, 10, 11, and CEL 2) from a tracheobronchial library (19Guyonnet-Duperat V. Audie J. Debailleul V. Laine A. Buisine M. Galiegue-Zouitina S. Pigny P. Degand P. Aubert J.-P. Porchet N. Biochem. J. 1995; : 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and cDNA 4F from a stomach library (15Ho S. Roberton A. Shekels L. Lyftogt C. Niehans G. Toribara N. Gastroenterol. 1995; 109: 735-747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) are assumed to occupy positions in a central part of the gene based on comparisons with MUC2. Our Northern blots (Fig. 4) suggest that the size of the full-length MUC5 AC mRNA is 12–14 kb and possibly larger. Subtracting the amount of currently known sequence at the 5′- and 3′-ends, we estimate the size of the repeat region in MUC5AC to be at least 6 kb. The size of the repeat region in MUC2 is 8.4 kb.Despite considerable interest in the gene 5′-end and promoter, prior to this report no 5′ cDNAs had been conclusively identified. Klomp et al. (1Klomp L. van Rens L. Strous G. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) had noted, however, that HGM-1, a cDNA isolated from a gastric cDNA library, is >60% similar to the MUC2 D-domain 3, which is approximately 3 kb downstream of the MUC2 5′ transcription start site. Taken together with evidence that HGM-1 is part of MUC5AC (see above), its similarity to this upstream region of MUC2 suggested that HGM-1 might comprise an upstream region of MUC5AC. Our 5′-RACE-PCR studies yielded a 3.3-kb 5′ extension of HGM-1. Within the MUC5AC sequence reported here are homologues of MUC2 D-domains 1 and 2 and the 5′-end of D-domain 3. Upstream of D-domain 1 is a signal peptide and translation start site.Sequence similarity between MUC2 and MUC5ACcDNAs has suggested a common ancestral origin. With the extension of the 5′-end of MUC5AC and manifestation of the conserved domain structure between the two genes, this theory gains increased support.The cloning work described here has provided insights not only into mucin gene structure and evolution but also into the mechanisms by which mucin is overproduced in human disease. Although MUC5AC has been recognized for some time to encode an airway mucin, it was only recently discovered that its expression is up-regulated in airway disease. The work reported here is the first to establish that this up-regulation is controlled at the transcriptional level and that key cis- and trans-activating factors operate within 4 kb upstream of the transcription start site. Availability of the newly cloned sequence will permit precise identification of transcriptional control mechanisms and will facilitate elucidation of upstream signaling pathways as well. Mucin is a glycoprotein secreted from epithelial cells at many body surfaces. In the airways, mucin interacts with cilia to trap and clear pathogens and irritants. This mucociliary mechanism is impaired when mucin is produced excessively as in cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, and asthma. Mucociliary impairment leads to airway mucus plugging, which promotes chronic infection, airflow obstruction, and sometimes death. Nine mucin genes are known to be expressed in man: MUC1-4, MUC5AC, MUC5B, MUC6-8 (2Gendler S.J. Lancaster C.A. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Duhig T. Peat N. Burchell J. Pemberton L. Laloni E.N. Wilson D.

Insofar as DNA-RNA transcription is controlled by mechanisms amenable to pharmaceutical intervention, an understanding of mucin transcription may suggest ways of inhibiting mucin overproduction. Both MUC2 and MUC5AC map to chromosome 11p15.5 and may have arisen from a common ancestral gene. The structure of MUC2 is known. Its central region, comprising >50% of the polypeptide, contains two tandem repeat sequences rich in threonine, serine, and proline (4Gum J.R. Byrd J.C. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Lamport D.T.A.

Much less information is available regarding MUC5AC. Understanding the transcriptional control of this gene will require isolation of the amino terminus and 5′-flanking region. To date, MUC5AC amino-terminal cDNAs have not been reported. Although PCR-based techniques can in principle extend existing cDNA fragments over long distances, the large size of the MUC5ACmRNA (10–12 kb) (8Meezaman D. Charles P. Daskal E. Polymeropoulos M.

A significant aid in this regard was provided by publication of the sequence of cDNA HGM-1 cloned from the human stomach (1Klomp L. van Rens L. Strous G. Biochem.

J. 1995; 308: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the ∼8% discrepancy between HGM-1 and NP3a suggests that portions of HGM-1 are repeated twice in MUC5AC. HGM-1's similarity to NP3a would place one HGM-1-like sequence near the 3′-end since NP3a contains a polyadenylation signal; its ∼60% similarity to the MUC2 D3-domain (1Klomp L. van Rens L. Strous G. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) would place another HGM-1-like sequence near the 5′-end since the MUC2 D3 domain is within 3 kb of the MUC2 transcription start site (17Gum Jr., J.R.

https://openalex.org/W1993666970,"We isolated a cDNA encoding a novel glucuronyltransferase from human placenta cDNA with the use of the degenerate reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method. Degenerate primers were designed based upon the amino acid sequence alignment of rat glucuronyltransferase (GlcAT-P) involved in the biosynthesis of the carbohydrate epitope HNK-1 with putative proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans and Schistosoma mansoni. The new cDNA sequence revealed an open reading frame coding for a protein of 335 amino acids with a type II transmembrane protein topology. The amino acid sequence displayed 43% identity to the rat GlcAT-P, and the highest sequence identity was found in the COOH-terminal catalytic domain. The expression of a soluble recombinant form of the protein in COS-1 cells produced an active glucuronyltransferase with marked specificity for a glycoserine Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser. In contrast, asialoorosomucoid, which contains the Galβ1–4GlcNAc sequence and is a good acceptor substrate for the GlcAT-P, did not serve as an acceptor. The reaction product was sensitive to β-glucuronidase digestion and co-chromatographed with authentic GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser in high-performance liquid chromatography, suggesting that the enzyme is a β1,3-glucuronyltransferase. These results indicate that this new member of the glucuronyltransferase gene family is the enzyme previously described as glucuronyltransferase I that forms the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region, GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser, of proteoglycans.

Proteoglycans are polyanionic molecules that are distributed on the surfaces of most cells and the extracellular matrixes in virtually every tissue and comprise a wide range of structures involving different core proteins and different classes, numbers, and lengths of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) 1The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; bp, base pair(s); DABS-Cl, 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4′-sulfonyl chloride; GlcA,d-glucuronic acid; GlcAT-I, glucuronyltransferase I (EC2.4.1.135); GlcAT-P, glycoprotein-specific glucuronyltransferase (10Terayama K.

Despite the ubiquity of this family of molecules, a wide variety of proteoglycans with characteristic sulfated GAG chains exhibit tissue-specific and developmentally regulated expression (for a review, see Ref. 3Poole A.R.

Sulfated GAGs, including heparin/heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate, are covalently bound to Ser residues in the core proteins through the common carbohydrate-protein linkage structure, GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser (1Lindahl U.

Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). Heparin/heparan sulfate is synthesized once GlcNAc is transferred to the common linkage region, while chondroitin sulfate is formed if GalNAc is first added. The biosynthesis of these GAGs is initiated by the addition of Xyl to specific Ser residues in the core protein and is followed by the addition of two Gal residues, a GlcA residue and then alternating addition of N-acetylhexosamine and GlcA residues. The addition of each sugar is thought to be catalyzed by a specific glycosyltransferase, which uses the corresponding uridine diphosphate sugar as a donor substrate (1Lindahl U. Rodén L.

The glucuronyl transfer to the Gal residue is catalyzed by a β1,3-glucuronyltransferase, which has been termed glucuronyltransferase I (GlcAT-I), which is thought to be distinct from the glucuronyltransferases involved in the formation of the repeating disaccharide units characteristic of various GAG species (5Helting T.

Chem. 1969; 244: 2799-2805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was subsequently partially purified from embryonic chick brain (9Brandt A.E. Distler J. Jourdian G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 64: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and mouse mastocytoma cells (6Helting T. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4327-4332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, attempts to purify GlcAT-I to homogeneity have not been successful due to the low concentrations and the difficulty in solubilization of the enzyme. Recently, cDNA encoding a glucuronyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope on glycoproteins (GlcAT-P) was cloned (10Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The GlcAT-P is a β1,3-glucuronyltransferase that utilizes glycoprotein acceptor substrates with the terminal Galβ1–4GlcNAc sequence. Mixed substrate experiments have indicated that GlcAT-I and the GlcAT-P are distinct enzymes, although the two enzymatic reactions are similar (11Curenton T. Ekborg G. Rodén L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In view of the resemblance of the reactions catalyzed by GlcAT-I and GlcAT-P, we anticipated that a molecular similarity might exist between the two enzymes and attempted to exploit this suspected similarity to isolate a cDNA encoding GlcAT-I. The alignment of the amino acid sequence of rat GlcAT-P with putative proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans and Schistosoma mansoni revealed the presence of four highly conserved motifs (I–IV) in the large catalytic region (10Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we used degenerate primers to conserved elements found in the motifs II and III for a PCR-based approach to clone new members of this gene family. In the present study, we describe the successful use of the approach for cloning a cDNA from human placenta which encodes GlcAT-I responsible for the formation of the GAG-protein linkage region, GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser, of proteoglycans. UDP-[U-14C]GlcA (285.2 mCi/mmol) and unlabeled UDP-GlcA were purchased from NEN Life Science Products and Sigma, respectively. Chondroitin (a chemically desulfated derivative of whale cartilage chondroitin sulfate A) and bovine liver β-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31) were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo) and Sigma, respectively. The following linkage trisaccharide-, tetrasaccharide-, pentasaccharide-, and heptasaccharide-serines were synthesized chemically (12Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Liebigs Ann. 1996; : 1239-1257Google Scholar): Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser, GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser, GalNAcβ1–4GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser, andGalNAcβ1–4GlcAβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser. The purity and concentration of these chemically synthesized substrates were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (12Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Liebigs Ann. 1996; : 1239-1257Google Scholar) and by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column as described (13Sugahara K. Okumura Y. Yamashina I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), respectively. HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 30 (prep grade) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Based upon the amino acid sequence alignment of rat GlcAT-P with putative proteins in C. elegans and S. mansoni (see Fig. 2 in Ref.10Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), two degenerate oligonucleotides to conserved elements found in the motifs II and III were synthesized, which were predicted to yield amplified fragments composed of around 210 bp. The sequences of the 5′ and 3′ primers were 5′-TSGTSTAYTTYGCYGAYGAYGA-3′ (the nucleotide sequence corresponding to 608–629 of the cDNA for rat GlcAT-P (10Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar)) and 5′-TTSACRGCRAASCCRGCCATRT-3′ (the nucleotide sequence corresponding to 800–821) (R = A + G, S = C + G, and Y = C + T), respectively. For PCR amplification, first strand cDNA synthesized with 25 ng of human placenta poly(A)+ RNA (OriGene, Rockville, MD) was combined with 50 pmol of each primer. Thirty cycles (94 °C for 45 s, 50 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s) were run using EX Taq polymerase (Takara Shuzo Co., Kyoto), and the products were subcloned into the pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The 12 clones were sequenced using a T7 primer, and 10 of the 12 clones contained a novel putative glucuronyltransferase fragment. To obtain the entire coding sequence containing the cDNA fragment, a cloning strategy of a rapid amplification of cDNA ends was employed according to the manufacturer's instructions (5′/3′ RACE kit, Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany), using 0.2 μg of human placenta poly(A)+ RNA as a template. The nucleotide sequence of the amplified cDNA was determined in a 377 DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA). Several clones were sequenced to compensate for misreading by EX Taq polymerase. A truncated form of GlcAT, lacking the first NH2-terminal 43 amino acids of the GlcAT, was amplified by PCR using a 5′ primer (5′-GGAAGATCTCTACGGCAGAAGGATCTGAGGAT-3′) containing an in-frame BglII site and a 3′ primer (5′-GGAAGATCTGTGCCTGAAAAGAGGTGGTAG-3′) containing an in-frame BglII site located 40 bp downstream of the stop codon. PCR reactions were carried out with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by 30 cycles of 96 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s. The PCR fragment was subcloned into the BamHI site of pGIR201protA (14Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1394-1401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) resulting in the fusion of GlcAT to the insulin signal sequence and the protein A sequence present in the vector. A NheI fragment containing the fusion protein was inserted into the XbaI site of the expression vector pSVL. The expression plasmid (11 μg) was transfected into COS-1 cells on 100-mm plates using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Two days after transfection, 1 ml of the culture medium was collected and incubated with 10 μl of IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads recovered by centrifugation were washed with and then resuspended in the assay buffer and tested for glucuronyltransferase activities using linkage oligosaccharide-serines (1 nmol each), chondroitin (300 μg), and asialoorosomucoid (20 μg) as acceptor substrates as described, respectively (5Helting T. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2799-2805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kitagawa H. Ujikawa M. Sugahara K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22711-22714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolation of the products from the GlcAT reaction using the linkage trisaccharide-serine was carried out by gel filtration on a Superdex 30 column equilibrated with 0.25 mNH4HCO3, 7% 1-propanol. The radioactive peak containing the product was pooled and evaporated to dryness. The isolated product was digested with 100 mIU of β-glucuronidase overnight at 37 °C in a total volume of 50 μl of 0.1 msodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5. The digest was analyzed using the same Superdex 30 column as that noted above. To further identify the reaction product, it was subjected to the recently developed analytical method for linkage glycoserines using chromophore labeling in conjunction with HPLC. 2K. Sugahara and H. Tsuda, unpublished results. The product purified by the Superdex 30 was derivatized with 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4′-sulfonyl chloride (DABS-Cl) (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) as essentially described (17Chang J.-Y. Knecht R. Braun D.G. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, the product (1 nmol) was dissolved in 20 μl of a 50 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.1) and mixed with 40 μl of a DABS-Cl solution (4 nmol/μl in acetone). The mixture was heated at 70 °C for 10 min, dried, and redissolved in 1 ml of 5% (v/v) ethanol. The labeled product was analyzed by HPLC on a Nova-Pak® C18column (3.9 × 150 mm; Waters, Tokyo) in an LC-10AS system (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto) using a linear acetonitrile gradient in 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5, containing 4% dimethylformamide. The gradient was made by increasing the acetonitrile concentration from 14 to 28% over a 60-min period at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at room temperature. Eluates were monitored at 436 nm. The identification of the reaction product was accomplished by co-chromatography with the authentic linkage tetrasaccharide-serine labeled with DABS-Cl as described above. The alignment of the amino acid sequence of rat GlcAT-P with those of the corresponding putative proteins in C. elegans and S. mansoni revealed the presence of four highly conserved motifs (I–IV) in the large catalytic region (see Fig. 2 in Ref. 10Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we first designed degenerate oligonucleotide primers to the conserved regions found in the motifs II and III for a PCR-based approach to clone new members of this gene family (see “Experimental Procedures”). Human placenta was chosen as a source for cDNA isolation in the initial PCR experiments, since it is an abundant source of sulfated GAGs and does not express the GlcAT-P gene. 3Y. Mitsumoto, S. Oka, and T. Kawasaki, unpublished results. With human placenta cDNA as the template, the PCR using degenerate primers resulted in the amplification of a major ∼210-bp product (data not shown). After subcloning the PCR product and sequencing individual clones, we found that 10 of the 12 characterized clones had an identical sequence that was similar to but distinct from that of the GlcAT-P, suggesting that these clones encoded a novel member of the glucuronyltransferase gene family. To clone the complete coding sequence of the novel cDNA, the cloning strategy of rapid amplification of cDNA ends was employed (18Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4336) Google Scholar). The revealed sequence of the overlapping cDNA fragments indicated a single open reading frame of 1005-bp coding for a protein of 335 amino acids, including one potential N-glycosylation site (Fig.1). The deduced amino acid sequence corresponds to a 37,061-Da polypeptide. The predicted translation initiation site conformed to the Kozak consensus sequence for initiation (19Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2382) Google Scholar). However, since no in-frame stop codon is present upstream of the assigned initiating ATG codon, the possibility that the identified cDNA still lacks a 5′-terminal sequence cannot be excluded (Fig. 1). A Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis (20Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar) revealed one potential membrane-spanning region consisting of 18 hydrophobic amino acid residues, which was located 7 residues away from the amino terminus (Fig. 1) and appears to result in a type II transmembrane orientation characteristic of many of the other glycosyltransferases cloned to date. An additional characteristic feature in the amino acid sequence of the newly cloned gene was a proline-rich domain (from Pro-30 to Pro-69) next to the transmembrane region, as is seen in several other glycosyltransferases including the rat GlcAT-P (10Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Data base searches indicated that the amino acid sequence displayed 42.7% identity to the rat GlcAT-P, and the highest sequence identity was found in the COOH-terminal catalytic domain containing the four previously identified highly conserved motifs (I–IV) (10Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), following the proline-rich region (252-amino acids between Pro-68 and Glu-319 overlap with 56.7% identity) (Fig. 2). The sequence conservation strongly suggests that the newly cloned gene product is a novel glucuronyltransferase.Figure 2Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the novel glucuronyltransferase (GlcAT-I) and rat GlcAT-P (10Terayama K.

Bold arrows indicate the positions of the degenerate primers used in this study.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To facilitate the functional analysis of the putative glucuronyltransferase, a soluble form of the protein was generated by replacing the first 43 amino acids of the putative glucuronyltransferase with a cleavable insulin signal sequence and a protein A IgG binding domain as described under “Experimental Procedures” and then the soluble putative glucuronyltransferase was expressed in COS-1 cells as a recombinant enzyme fused with the protein A IgG binding domain. The fused enzyme expressed in the medium was absorbed on IgG-Sepharose beads to eliminate endogenous glucuronyltransferase and then the enzyme-bound beads were used as an enzyme source. The bound fusion protein was assayed for glucuronyltransferase activity using a variety of acceptor substrates. As shown in Table I, activity was detected only with the linkage trisaccharide-serine, Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser as the substrate, whereas no activity was detected using polymer chondroitin, the linkage pentasaccharide-serine, or heptasaccharide-serine as acceptors. In contrast, asialoorosomucoid, which contains a Galβ1–4GlcNAc sequence and is a good acceptor substrate for the GlcAT-P (10Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), did not serve as an acceptor. In addition, no detectable glucuronyltransferase activity was recovered by the affinity purification from a control pSVL transfection sample. These results clearly indicate that the expressed protein is a glucuronyltransferase with marked specificity for Galβ1–3 Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser.Table IAcceptor specificity of the glucuronyltransferase secreted into the culture medium by transfected COS-1 cellsAcceptorActivity1-aThe values represent the averages of two independent experiments.pmol/ml medium/hGalβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser7.6GalNAcβ1–4GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-SerND1-bND, not detected (<0.1 pmol/ml medium/h).GalNAcβ1–4GlcAβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-SerNDChondroitinNDAsialoorosomucoid (Galβ1–4GlcNAc-R)1-cR represents the remainder of the N-linked oligosaccharide chain.ND1-a The values represent the averages of two independent experiments.1-b ND, not detected (<0.1 pmol/ml medium/h).1-c R represents the remainder of the N-linked oligosaccharide chain. Open table in a new tab To identify the glucuronyltransferase reaction products, the linkage trisaccharide-serine was labeled with [14C]GlcA using the enzyme-bound beads as an enzyme source, and the products were isolated and then subjected to a gel filtration analysis after β-glucuronidase treatment. The labeled products were completely digested by β-glucuronidase, quantitatively yielding a 14C-labeled peak at the position of free [14C]GlcA (data not shown). These results indicate that a GlcA residue was indeed transferred to the linkage trisaccharide-serine through a β-linkage. The labeled products were also derivatized with DABS-Cl and analyzed by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 3, only a single radioactive peak was detected at the elution position of a DABS-derivative of the linkage tetrasaccharide-serine, GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser, being separated from those of Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser and GalNAcβ1–4GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser. Moreover, the identity of the reaction product was confirmed by co-chromatography with the authentic linkage tetrasaccharide-serine labeled with DABS-Cl (data not shown). These results indicate that a GlcA residue was transferred exclusively to the nonreducing terminal Gal of the linkage trisaccharide-serine, most likely through a β1–3 linkage. GlcAT-I is the first cloned glycosyltransferase among those responsible for the biosynthesis of sulfated GAGs, including heparin/heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate. It should be emphasized that no protein sequence information had been available for GlcAT-I, although the identification and partial purification of the enzyme had been reported in a few tissues. The initial characterization of crude enzyme preparations showed that the enzyme catalyzed the GlcA transfer not only to GAG-protein linkage region fragments with the characteristic structure (e.g.Galβ1–3Gal) but also to disaccharides with analogous structures such as lactose (Galβ1–4Glc) and N-acetyllactosamine (Galβ1–4GlcNAc) (5Helting T. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2799-2805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Helting T. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4327-4332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Brandt A.E. Distler J. Jourdian G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 64: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Curenton et al. (11Curenton T. Ekborg G. Rodén L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) suggested that these glucuronyl transfer reactions might be catalyzed by two distinct β1,3-glucuronyltransferases, GlcAT-I and GlcAT-P, respectively. This hypothesis has now been confirmed by the cDNA cloning of both enzymes in a recent study (10Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and in the present study. It is not surprising, however, that a molecular similarity exists between the two enzymes, although the product glycan types are different (the GAG linkage region and the HNK-1 epitope on N-linked glycoproteins), since these two enzymes exhibit a certain similarity in their substrate recognition (both enzymes recognize the terminal Gal moiety of their acceptor substrates). In addition, the molecular similarity revealed in this study suggests that both genes may be evolutionarily related and originate from one primordial gene. The expression of GlcAT-I in COS-1 cells, where a fusion was made among the cleavable insulin signal sequence, the protein A IgG binding domain, and the truncated GlcAT-I, resulted in the secretion of the truncated soluble enzyme into the medium, which exhibited the glucuronyltransferase activity despite the finding that GlcAT-I in embryonic chick brain was firmly membrane-associated (11Curenton T. Ekborg G. Rodén L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The present result demonstrated that the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains are not required for the catalytic activity. The characterization of the acceptor substrate specificity of the recombinant GlcAT-I revealed that the enzyme showed strict specificity toward the linkage trisaccharide-serine, Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser (Table I). Neither other linkage oligosaccharide-serines nor polymer chondroitin was utilized as an acceptor substrate. These findings clearly indicate that the transfer of GlcA to the linkage trisaccharide primer is mediated by GlcAT-I, distinct from the enzyme that has been termed glucuronyltransferase II involved in the formation of the repeating disaccharide units of chondroitin sulfate, as proposed previously (5Helting T.

Likewise, the recombinant GlcAT-I efficiently utilized Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl as an acceptor, 4Y. Tone, H. Kitagawa, and K. Sugahara, unpublished results. being consistent with the property of the previously characterized enzyme and the finding that the serine residue is not essential for the GlcA transfer. The availability of the GlcAT-I cDNA now provides an essential tool for investigating the biological functions of sulfated GAGs, especially since GlcAT-I is responsible for the synthesis of the common GAG-protein linkage region. Hence, the gene knockout would result in the complete elimination of chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and heparin unless functional redundancy exists."
https://openalex.org/W2044570539,"We recently identified a 35-kDa erythrocyte membrane protein, phospholipid scramblase, that promotes Ca2+-dependent transbilayer movement of phosphatidylserine (PS) and other phospholipids (PL) in reconstituted proteoliposomes (Zhou, Q., Zhao, J., Stout, J. G., Luhm, R. A., Wiedmer, T., and Sims, P. J. (1997) J. Biol. Chem.272, 18240–18244). To determine whether this same protein is responsible for the rapid movement of PS from inner-to-outer plasma membrane leaflets in other cells exposed to elevated cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]c), we analyzed how induced movement of PS to the cell surface related to expression of PL scramblase. Exposure to Ca2+ ionophore A23187 resulted in rapid PS exposure in those cell lines constitutively high in PL scramblase (HEL, Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-lymphocytes, and Jurkat), whereas this response was markedly attenuated in cells expressing low amounts of this protein (Raji, HL60, and Dami). To confirm this apparent correlation between PL scramblase expression and PS egress at elevated [Ca2+]c, Raji cells were transfected with PL scramblase cDNA in pEGFP-C2, and stable transformants expressing various amounts of GFP-PL scramblase fusion protein were obtained. Clones expressing GFP-PL scramblase showed distinctly plasma membrane-localized fluorescence. When compared either with untransfected Raji cells or with transformants expressing GFP alone, clones expressing GFP-PL scramblase fusion protein showed increased exposure of PS at the cell surface in response to elevated [Ca2+]c, accompanied by increased expression of membrane catalytic function for the prothrombinase enzyme complex. These data indicate that transfection with PL scramblase cDNA promotes movement of PS to cell surfaces and suggest that this protein normally mediates redistribution of plasma membrane phospholipids in activated, injured, or apoptotic cells.

This exposure of the plasma membrane aminophospholipids has been shown to promote assembly and activation of several key enzymes of the coagulation and complement systems, as well as to accelerate the clearance of injured or apoptotic cells by the reticuloendothelial system, suggesting that Ca2+-induced remodeling of plasma membrane PL is central to both vascular hemostatic and cellular clearance mechanisms (1Schroit A.J.

We recently identified an integral membrane protein from human erythrocytes that when reconstituted into liposomes mediated a Ca2+-dependent, bidirectional scrambling of PL between membrane leaflets, mimicking the action of Ca2+ at the endofacial surface of the erythrocyte membrane (11Bassé F.

Here we show that when cell lines are compared, the level of expressed PL scramblase generally reflects the extent to which PS migrates to the plasma membrane outer leaflet in response to elevated [Ca2+]c. We also demonstrate that the propensity for PS to become exposed at cell surfaces can be manipulated by altering the level of expression of PL scramblase through plasmid transfection.

The IgG fraction was isolated on protein A-Sepharose-CL4B, and the peptide-reactive antibody was purified by affinity chromatography on peptide [Cys]-ESTGSQEQKSGVW coupled to UltraLink Iodoacetyl resin. Human PL scramblase cDNA insert was released from plasmid pMAL-C2-PL scramblase (13Zhou Q. Zhao J. Stout J.G. Luhm R.A. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol.

The pEGFP-C2-PL scramblase plasmid was amplified from single clones in Escherichia coli strain Top 10, and the orientation and reading frame of the insert were confirmed by sequencing on an ABI DNA Sequencer Model 373 Stretch (Perkin Elmer-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). 1.6 × 107 Raji cells were electroporated with 160 μg of plasmid DNA (pEGFP-C2-PL scramblase or pEGFP-C2) in a total volume of 0.8 ml of OPTI-MEM, selected with 1.5 mg/ml geneticin, sorted by flow cytometry (FACStar, Becton-Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San José, CA), and dilutionally cloned. pEGFP-PL scramblase transformants expressing the 62-kDa GFP-PL scramblase fusion protein were identified by Western blotting with anti-GFP and with anti-PL-306-W318 antibodies. Comparable GFP-expressing clones served as controls. Phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy were performed with a ZEISS AXIOSKOP microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped for epifluorescence, and images were recorded with a MC100 camera system. Western blotting of GFP and PL scramblase antigens was performed using 1.5 × 106cells/lane. Cell pellets were extracted with 2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 in 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm benzamidine, 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose, the blocked membrane was incubated with either 10 μg/ml of rabbit anti-PL scramblase-E306-W318, or 1:10,000 dilution of mouse anti-GFP. The blots were developed using SuperSignal ULTRA chemiluminescence. Calcium ionophore-induced exposure of PS on the surface of all cell lines analyzed was detected by the specific binding of coagulation factor Va (light chain) as described previously (7Sims P.J. Faioni E.M. Wiedmer T. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18205-18212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kojima H. Newton-Nash D. Weiss H.J. Zhao J. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. J. Clin.

Briefly, cells were washed and suspended (2 × 106 cells/ml) at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm HEPES, and adjusted to 1.2 mm free [Ca2+]. At time 0, A23187 (final concentration, 0 or 2 μm) was added, and at times indicated, 6 mm EGTA was added. PS exposed at each time point was detected by incubating (10 min, room temperature) 50 μl of the cell suspension with 10 μg/ml FVa, followed by 10 μg/ml anti-FVa, to detect the cell-bound FVa light chain. After staining with 10 μg/ml Tri-Color conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (CALTAG Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), single cell fluorescence was quantified by flow cytometry (FL3 channel, FACScan, Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems). In experiments in which cell lysis was monitored by uptake of propidium iodide, cells were stained for bound FVa with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate of goat anti-mouse IgG (FL1 channel)) substituting for Tri-Color conjugate, and propidium iodide was detected in FL3 channel. Propidium iodide (0.5 μg/ml) was added immediately before dilution for flow cytometry. Prothrombinase activity of Raji cells was determined by modification of methods previously described for platelets, using the chromogenic thrombin substrate S2238 (7Sims P.J. Faioni E.M. Wiedmer T. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18205-18212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes reconstituted with erythrocyte PL scramblase exhibit accelerated transbilayer movement of fluorescent phospholipids in response to added Ca2+, similar to the observed effect of calcium on the endofacial surface of the red cell membrane (11Bassé F.

To determine whether this same protein is responsible for mediating the accelerated egress of plasma membrane PS that is observed under conditions of elevated cytosolic [Ca2+]c, we examined whether the level of expression of PL scramblase in various human cell lines correlated to the induced movement of PS to the surface of these cells. In these experiments, the cell surface exposure of PS was monitored by the binding of the light chain of coagulation factor Va, a PS-specific binding protein whose affinity for the PS headgroup is independent of Ca2+ concentration (7Sims P.J. Faioni E.M. Wiedmer T. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18205-18212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kojima H. Newton-Nash D. Weiss H.J. Zhao J. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2237-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.1, when challenged with ionophore, human cell lines exhibit considerable differences in the extent to which PS is mobilized to the cell surface. Among the cells tested, Raji, HL60, and Dami were notably unresponsive to A23187, whereas HEL, W9, and Jurkat showed notably robust responses. This apparent cell type-specific variability in response to induced elevation of [Ca2+]c was consistently maintained through many months of passage in culture. As also shown in Fig. 1, we observed considerable differences in the content of PL scramblase protein among these various cell lines, and their sensitivity to induced exposure of plasma membrane PS (lower panel) generally reflected the amount of cellular PL scramblase protein detected by Western blotting (upper panel). Those cell lines that were most responsive to induced elevation of [Ca2+]c (HEL, W9, and Jurkat) also expressed greatest amounts of PL scramblase antigen, whereas cell lines with attenuated response to [Ca2+]c (Raji, HL60, and Dami) contained relatively little of this protein. Cell lines Molt-4 and K562 showed intermediate responses to elevated [Ca2+]c and expressed intermediate levels of PL scramblase antigen. These relatively large differences in cell line-specific expression of this protein was found to correspond to marked differences in level of specific mRNA as detected by Northern blotting with PL scramblase cDNA (Ref. 13Zhou Q. Zhao J. Stout J.G. Luhm R.A. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18240-18244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar and data not shown). Whereas the Ca2+-dependent movement of PS generally reflected the level of expression of PL scramblase antigen per cell, some exceptions were noted, most particularly when results for HL60 and Dami are compared (Fig. 1). We also noted that those cell lines with the highest content of PL scramblase exhibited a higher background of PS exposed in the absence of ionophore. This was most notable for HEL, for which 15–30% of cells exposed PS prior to the addition of A23187, resulting in an underestimation of the ionophore-dependent response. To determine whether the increase in PS exposure in calcium ionophore-treated cells reflected actual transbilayer movement of PS or increased sensitivity of the plasma membrane to lytic disruption, FVa binding to the cell surface was monitored simultaneously with uptake of propidium iodide, as a measure of cell lysis. In the B-lymphocyte line W9 and other cells expressing high level PL scramblase, addition of ionophore resulted in a marked increase in cell surface receptors for FVa that distinctly preceded the later uptake of propidium iodide (data not shown). This confirmed that in this PL scramblase-expressing cell line, elevation of [Ca2+]c induces a rapid movement of PS to the cell surface before onset of cell lysis is observed. By contrast, Raji cells that are virtually devoid of PL scramblase (Fig.1), exhibited a general insensitivity of the plasma membrane to elevated [Ca2+]c, as reflected either by de novo appearance of PS at the cell surface or by cellular uptake of propidium iodide. To confirm that the extent to which PS moves to the cell surface with elevation of [Ca2+]c actually depends upon plasma membrane content of PL scramblase, we stably transformed Raji, a cell line exhibiting low endogenous PL scramblase expression (Fig. 1) by transfection with plasmid pEGFP-C2-PL scramblase. This plasmid expresses PL scramblase as a fusion protein with GFP, facilitating flow cytometric sorting of transformants for subsequent cloning and enabling quantitation by fluorescence of the content of recombinant protein in select clones. Expression of full-length GFP-PL scramblase fusion protein in transformed clones was confirmed by Western blotting with antibody against GFP and with antibody against the carboxyl terminus of human PL scramblase (Fig.2). As is also illustrated by Fig. 2, clones that expressed the GFP-PL scramblase fusion protein showed a distinct rim appearing pattern of fluorescence, consistent with trafficking of GFP-PL scramblase to the plasma membrane. Clonal populations of transformed Raji cells expressing comparable levels of either GFP-PL scramblase or GFP (transformed with pEGFP-C2 lacking insert) were analyzed for their capacity to mobilize PS to the cell surface (Fig.3). In response to an A23187-induced elevation of [Ca2+]c, transformants expressing the GFP-PL scramblase fusion construct showed a marked increase in both the rate and extent that PS became exposed on the cell surface, when compared with either the identically treated parental Raji cell line or to GFP-expressing clones transformed with pEGFP-C2 vector alone (Fig.3). We noted a small but reproducible increase in the background level of PS exposure in transformants expressing GFP-PL scramblase protein when compared either with the parental Raji cell lines or with GFP-expressing clones transformed with vector alone. The increase in FVa binding seen for the GFP-PLS transformed cell lines was accompanied by equivalent increase in membrane coagulant function as measured by prothrombinase assay (data not shown). To confirm the apparent correlation between endogenous cell content of PL scramblase and plasma membrane sensitivity to elevated [Ca2+]c that is evident when different human cell lines are compared (Fig. 1), we analyzed multiple Raji clones that were stably transfected with either GFP-PL scramblase or with GFP vector alone (Fig.4). These experiments confirmed that a cell's capacity to mobilize PS to the surface can be increased through expression of GFP-PL scramblase fusion protein, whereas this response is unaffected by cell content of GFP. These results provide the first evidence that the PL scramblase protein identified in the erythrocyte membrane and implicated in [Ca2+]c-induced remodeling of membrane phospholipids actually functions to induce accelerated transbilayer movement of plasma membrane phospholipid in human cells that express this protein. Our results also confirm that the level of expression of PL scramblase can determine the extent to which PS is mobilized to the cell surface upon elevation of [Ca2+]c and suggest that this protein normally functions to mediate the redistribution of plasma membrane phospholipids in response to the entry of calcium into the cytosol. Furthermore, these data provide the first indication that the movement of PS and other procoagulant aminophospholipids from plasma membrane inner leaflet to the cell surface can be manipulated by selectively altering the level of expression of a particular cellular protein, either through direct transfection with the PL scramblase cDNA or potentially by another intervention affecting cell expression of this protein. In addition to conferring increased sensitivity of the plasma membrane to ionophore-induced elevation of [Ca2+]c, we generally observed a higher background of PS exposure (in the absence of ionophore) in those transfected cell clones expressing large amounts of the GFP-PL scramblase fusion protein. This elevated background PS exposure was also observed in the case of untreated HEL, the cell line containing the highest endogenous content of PL scramblase. Although we suspect that this increased background reflects the enhanced sensitivity of the plasma membrane of these cells to any adventitial elevation of [Ca2+]c during cell processing for assay, we cannot exclude the possibility that these cells are also inherently more fragile due to the large amounts of PL scramblase that is inserted into the plasma membrane. Although the movement of plasma membrane PS to the cell surface at elevated [Ca2+]c can be demonstrated in a variety of cells and tissues (2Devaux P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1163-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 15Zwaal R.F.A. Schroit A.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we detect marked differences in the levels of PL scramblase mRNA and protein among different human cell types, which is generally reflected by corresponding differences in sensitivity to this [Ca2+]c-induced collapse of plasma membrane PL asymmetry (Fig. 1 and Ref. 13Zhou Q.

In particular, we note that the content of PL scramblase in human platelet is approximately 10-fold greater than that of the erythrocyte, which is consistent with the respective PS-mobilizing potential and different roles of these two cells in contributing procoagulant membrane surface for thrombin generation during blood clotting (13Zhou Q.

In addition to the relatively high levels of PL scramblase identified in circulating human platelets, this protein was also most abundant in the cell line HEL, whereas only small amounts of this protein (and low PL scramblase activity) was detected for Dami (Fig. 1), two human cancer cell lines exhibiting partial megakaryocytic-like properties. It is also noteworthy that several of the lymphoma-derived cell lines (e.g. Raji and MOLT-4) express considerably reduced levels of PL scramblase and also show distinctly attenuated PS exposure in response to elevated [Ca2+]c when compared either with peripheral blood leukocytes or with Epstein-Barr virus transforms of normal lymphocytes. The collapse of plasma membrane phospholipid asymmetry is a relatively early event in apoptosis of lymphocytes and other cells, and the consequent exposure of PS on the cell surface is thought to contribute to phagocytic removal of such cells by scavenger macrophages (9Fadok V.A.

It is therefore of interest to consider whether the apparent resistance of certain lymphoma-derived cell lines to such remodeling of plasma membrane phospholipids due to a decrease in expression of PL scramblase in the plasma membrane might contribute to the proliferative potential and in vivo survival of these or other transformed cells.

https://openalex.org/W2083663804,"The three-dimensional structure of an antibody (39-A11) that catalyzes a Diels-Alder reaction has been determined. The structure suggests that the antibody catalyzes this pericyclic reaction through a combination of packing and hydrogen-bonding interactions that control the relative geometries of the bound substrates and electronic distribution in the dienophile. A single somatic mutation, serine-91 of the light chain to valine, is largely responsible for the increase in affinity and catalytic activity of the affinity-matured antibody. Structural and functional studies of the germ-line precursor suggest that 39-A11 and related antibodies derive from a family of germ-line genes that have been selected throughout evolution for the ability of the encoded proteins to form a polyspecific combining site. Germ line–encoded antibodies of this type, which can rapidly evolve into high-affinity receptors for a broad range of structures, may help to expand the binding potential associated with the structural diversity of the primary antibody repertoire."

The mouse and human versions of each NMT are highly homologous, displaying greater than 95% amino acid sequence identity. Comparisons between the NMT-1 and NMT-2 proteins revealed reduced levels of sequence identity (76–77%), indicating that NMT-1 and NMT-2 comprise two distinct families of N-myristoyltransferases. Transient transfection of either the hNMT-1 or hNMT-2 cDNA into COS-7 cells resulted in the expression of high levels of NMT enzyme activity. Both hNMT-1 and hNMT-2 were found to myristoylate several commonly studied peptide substrates with similar, but distinguishable, relative selectivities.

Cell Res. 1997; 235: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), leading to the proposal that NMT could serve as a target for anticancer therapies (16Felsted R.L. Glover C.G. Hartman K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 1571-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this regard, one speculated mechanism for the antitumor activity of the natural product fumagillin is through indirectly preventing protein myristoylation (17Sin N. Meng L. Wang M.Q.W. Wen J.J. Bornmann W.G. Crews C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6099-6103Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Fumagillin has been shown to inhibit the methionine aminopeptidase, MetAP-2, an enzyme that cleaves the N-terminal methionine from newly synthesized proteins (17Sin N. Meng L. Wang M.Q.W. Wen J.J. Bornmann W.G. Crews C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6099-6103Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), a process required for the exposure of N-terminal glycine residues of NMT protein substrates. A single human NMT cDNA has been isolated and characterized (18Duronio R.J. Reed S.I. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4129-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar,19Glover C.J. Hartman K.D. Felsted R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28680-28689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and subsequent failures to identify homologous human cDNAs has led some to speculate that NMT activity in vivo is likely derived from a single gene (20Peseckis S.M. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30888-30892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, biochemical studies have repeatedly indicated the presence of multiple distinct protein forms of NMT in vivo, often varying in either molecular size and/or subcellular distribution (2Boutin J.A. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 15-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 21Glover C.J. Felsted R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23226-23233Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22King M.J.

Cell Res. 1996; 223: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Whether all of these NMT forms are derived from a single gene or from multiple NMT genes has remained unclear (2Boutin J.A. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 15-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We now report the isolation and characterization of a second distinct NMT cDNA from a human liver library, as well as the cloning of the respective mouse homologue for each of the two human NMTs. For the sake of clarity, we will hereafter refer to the originally characterized human NMT as hNMT-1 and the human NMT described in the present study as hNMT-2. PCR primers based on the sequence of expressed sequence tag (EST) AA036845 were designed for the amplification of a 550-base pair portion of the hNMT-2 cDNA from a human liver 5′Stretch Plus cDNA library (CLONTECH): Primer 1, 5′-GCGAATTCAACATCCACACAGAGACGCCC-3′; Primer 2, 5′-GCGAATTCTCTGTAACTTCTACTTAGTCC-3′. This amplified DNA was used as a probe to screen human and mouse liver 5′Stretch Plus cDNA libraries according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Four positive human clones and six positive mouse clones were isolated from screenings of 3.2 × 105 and 9.6 × 105 plaques, respectively. A 2.85-kb human clone and a 1.9-kb mouse clone contained the presumed complete coding sequence for hNMT-2 and mNMT-2, respectively. The hNMT-1 cDNA was isolated by PCR with primers based on the reported GenBank™ sequence (accession number AF020500): Primer 1, 5′-GCAAGCTTCGCTGCCGCAGATGATGG-3′, Primer 2, 5′-GCGAATTCAGTTCTGCTCCCTTTGCC-3′. This hNMT-1 cDNA was then used as a probe to screen both human brain and mouse liver cDNA libraries (CLONTECH; 3.2 × 105 plaques per screening). Six positive human clones and eight positive mouse clones were identified. A 4.4-kb human clone and 1.6-kb mouse clone encoded the presumed complete coding sequence for hNMT-1 and mNMT-1, respectively. All reported cDNAs were cloned into pBluescript II SK(+) and sequenced completely in both directions. NMT protein sequence comparisons were conducted using the DNASTAR MegAlign program (Clustal method), and percentage sequence identities were calculated from sequence alignments after excluding the identified gaps. For Northern analysis, cDNA probes specific for the NMT-1 and NMT-2 genes were generated from the 5′ most 400 base pairs of each cDNA (the least homologous region between NMT-1 and NMT-2). The hNMT-1 and hNMT-2 cDNAs were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3, and transiently transfected into COS-7 cells as described previously (24Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K. Mayfield S.P. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar), with the exception that 1.25 μg of the hNMT-1 cDNA was used per transfection to reduce the amount of hNMT-1 expression to levels comparable with hNMT-2 expression (as judged by NMT enzyme activities). Transfected cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice with Hepes buffer (12.5 mmHepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl), and Dounce-homogenized in Hepes buffer containing 1 × complete protease inhibitors (Boehringer Mannheim) on ice. The homogenized cell extracts were then sonicated briefly (5 s), assayed for protein content (Dc protein assay kit, Bio-Rad), and used for enzyme assays, Western blotting, and cell fractionation experiments (25Giang D.K. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2238-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The hNMT-1 cDNA was cloned into the pGEX-4T-3 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for generation of a GST-hNMT-1 fusion protein (residues 89–496 of hNMT-1) according to manufacturer's guidelines. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies generated against the GST-NMT-1 fusion protein were affinity-purified by first removing GST-cross-reactive antibodies and then isolating antibodies that bound the GST-hNMT-1 protein. These antibodies were used in standard Western blotting procedures and recognized both the hNMT-1 and hNMT-2 proteins. N-Myristoyltransferase activity was monitored using the methods employed by Towler and Glaser (26Towler D. Glaser L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). [3H]Myristoyl-CoA (0.75 μCi; 52 Ci/mmol; 0.3 μm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to a mixture of COS-7 total cell protein (7.5 μg) and peptide substrate (200 μm) in a reaction buffer of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 with 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1.0% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 4.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (total reaction volume of 50 μl; reaction buffer from King and Sharma (27King M.J. Sharma R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 25 °C, then quenched with 50 μl of methanol followed by 5 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid, placed on ice for 10 min, and spun at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Aliquots (25 μl) of the supernatant were analyzed by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. A myristoylated GNAAAARR peptide was synthesized as described by Towler and Glaser (26Towler D. Glaser L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and used as a standard to define the elution times for myristoylated peptide products. Column fractions (1 ml) were collected and counted by scintillation counting. In all cases, control reactions without peptide were also analyzed and subtracted from reactions with peptide to provide the myristoylation rates reported in Table I. Each reaction was run in triplicate with data reported as the average ± S.D. of these values. Initial rates were determined from reactions in which less than 20% myristoylated product was formed. Peptide substrates were designed based on previous work of Boutin and colleagues (28Boutin J.A. Ferry G. Ernould A.-P. Maes P. Remond G. Vincent M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 853-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Table IN-Myristoyltransferase activities of hNMT-1- and hNMT-2-transfected COS-7 cellsSubstrateMock-transfected myristoylation ratehNMT-1-transfected myristoylation ratehNMT-1 myristoylation ratehNMT-2-transfected myristoylation ratehNMT-2 myristoylation ratepmol · min−1 · mg−1%pmol · min−1 · mg−1%Src peptide (GSSKSKPKDP)6.4 ± 0.234.7 ± 1.410038.5 ± 1.6100PKA peptide (GNAAAARR)1.9 ± 0.121.9 ± 0.77017.9 ± 0.350c-Abl peptide (GQQPGKVL)1.0 ± 0.313.2 ± 2.7439.5 ± 1.527Tumor necrosis factor peptide (EEALPKKTGGPQGSR)NDNDNDN-Myristoyltransferase activity measured in transfected COS-7 cell extracts with various potential peptide substrates.

Intrigued by an apparent disparity between the available biochemical and genetic data on N-myristoyltransferase enzymes, we searched the EST data base for homologues to a previously characterized human NMT cDNA (hNMT-1). Identified ESTs separated into two distinct categories, either being identical to the hNMT-1 cDNA or approximately 70–80% identical to the hNMT-1 cDNA (e.g. EST AA203325,AA036845, AA036785, AA364769). Moreover, the collection of homologous, but distinct, ESTs appeared to be derived from a common cDNA, leading us to conclude that a second as of yet uncharacterized NMT existed in humans. Oligonucleotide primers based on the cDNA sequence of EST AA036845 were used in the PCR to amplify a 550-base pair fragment of the novel NMT cDNA from a human liver cDNA library. This PCR product was subsequently used to isolate a 2.85-kb cDNA that encoded a putative full-length NMT (hNMT-2). Although no stop codon was identified upstream of the first encoded methionine residue, the sequence surrounding this ATG matched well with the Kozak sequence for predicted eukaryotic translation initiation sites (29Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Additionally, this putative translation initiation site was shared by all four mammalian NMT cDNAs and coded for the only conserved in-frame methionine residue upstream of the previously defined NMT ribosomal targeting domain (19Glover C.J. Hartman K.D. Felsted R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28680-28689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (see below). Comparisons between the predicted protein sequences for hNMT-1 and hNMT-2 demonstrated that the two proteins shared 77% amino acid identity (Fig. 1). Sequence divergence was most prevalent in the N-terminal domains of the NMTs, a region of hNMT-1 dispensable for catalytic activity, but implicated in protein targeting (19Glover C.J. Hartman K.D. Felsted R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28680-28689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Rudnick D.A. Johnson R.L. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23852-23861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, an intriguing conserved sequence was noted in this otherwise dissimilar region of the NMTs, as amino acids 54–68 of hNMT-1, GAKKKKKKQKKKKEK, matched nearly identically amino acids 44–58 of hNMT-2, GAKKKKKKQKRKKEK. Similar stretches of positively charged residues have been identified in other proteins involved in the cotranslational processing of proteins, including N-methionylaminopeptidase (31Arfin S.M. Kendall R.L. Hall L. Weaver L.H. Stewart A.E. Matthews B.W. Bradshaw R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7714-7718Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), leading to the proposal that these sequence elements serve to target such enzymes to the ribosome (19Glover C.J. Hartman K.D. Felsted R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28680-28689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To gain a better understanding of the potential significance of the sequence divergence between hNMT-1 and hNMT-2, their respective mouse homologues, mNMT-1 and mNMT-2, were isolated and characterized. Interestingly, the mouse and human NMTs segregated neatly into two distinct pairs of enzymes based on their homologies in primary structure (Fig. 2), with mNMT-1 and hNMT-1 sharing 97% amino acid sequence identity and mNMT-2 and hNMT-2 sharing 96% amino acid sequence identity. One notable difference between mNMT-2 and hNMT-2 was the presence in the former of an inserted stretch of 31 amino acids in the N-terminal portion of the protein (amino acids 84–114). Further examination of the mNMT-2 cDNA failed to identify consensus intron splice sites within this inserted sequence, indicating that amino acids 84–114 were a legitimate part of the mNMT-2 protein. Additionally, five independent mNMT-2 cDNA clones were isolated and one EST (W62224) identified that covered this region of the mNMT-2 sequence and each of these clones possessed this insert. A comparison between the mNMT-1 and mNMT-2 proteins revealed a reduced level of sequence identity of 76%, reminiscent of the homology found between hNMT-1 and hNMT-2. Thus, most of the distinguishing features between the primary structures of NMT-1 and NMT-2 have been conserved from mouse to human. Northern analysis demonstrated that most human and mouse tissues concurrently express both NMTs, indicating that a functional difference between the two enzymes is not likely rooted in restricted tissue distribution profiles (data not shown). To compare the hNMT-1 and hNMT-2 proteins further, each NMT cDNA was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 and transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells expressing either hNMT-1 or hNMT-2 showed significantly higher levels of NMT activity than mock-transfected cells (Table I). Several peptides were tested as substrates for each NMT to gain a preliminary understanding of the relative substrate selectivities of each enzyme. Both hNMT-1 and hNMT-2 myristoylated peptide substrates corresponding to the N termini of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), Src kinase, and Abl kinase (Table I). Analysis of the initial reaction rates revealed that the enzymes shared similar substrate selectivities, with the notable exception that hNMT-2 showed a greater relative preference for the Src peptide substrate. Neither NMT myristoylated either 1) a control peptide in which the N-terminal glycine from the PKA peptide was removed or 2) an internal peptide from the tumor necrosis factor α precursor protein, EEALPKKTGGPQGSR, which is myristoylated on lysine residues (32Stevenson F.T. Bursten S.L. Locksley R.M. Lovett D.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified antibodies generated against a GST fusion protein of hNMT-1 were used to characterize by Western blotting the expression of each NMT in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3). hNMT-1 and hNMT-2 appeared as primarily single protein bands of 68 and 65 kDa in size, respectively (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 7). While these apparent sizes for hNMT-1 and hNMT-2 were larger than their predicted molecular masses (about 57 kDa for each enzyme), previous work has indicated that NMTs migrate anomalously large on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (19Glover C.J. Hartman K.D. Felsted R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28680-28689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, three additional isoforms of hNMT-1 were also identified in transfected COS-7 extracts (apparent sizes of 49, 55, and 56 kDa; lane 4), while no additional forms of hNMT-2 were observed (lane 7). The multiple hNMT-1 proteins were likely the result of in vivo processing events, as an equivalent hNMT-1 protein profile was identified in transfected COS-7 cells harvested directly into standard SDS gel loading buffer (data not shown). Mock-transfected COS-7 cells showed weakly immunoreactive 64- and 67-kDa proteins that may represent endogenous NMTs (lanes 1–3). Separation of COS-7 extracts into cytoplasmic and membrane fractions revealed that hNMT-2 and the 68-kDa isoform of hNMT-1 appeared significantly in both the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions (lanes 5, 6, 8, and 9), while the 49-, 55-, and 56-kDa isoforms of hNMT-1 were predominately cytoplasmic (lane 5). The majority of each NMT enzyme activity was found in the cytoplasm (85 and 75% for hNMT-1 and hNMT-2, respectively). However, such relative enzyme activity comparisons should be interpreted with caution, given that membrane associated inhibitory factors have been shown to reduce the apparent activity of membranous NMTs (33King M.J. Sharma R.K. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Finally, considering that hNMT-1 has recently been shown to target to ribosomes (19Glover C.J. Hartman K.D. Felsted R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28680-28689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the membranous NMTs identified here may in fact reflect association of these proteins with ribosomes that are themselves bound to membranes. The isolation and characterization of a second family of mammalian N-myristoyltransferases has profound implications on both the in vivo regulation and pharmaceutical targeting of protein myristoylation. The strict conservation of primary structure identified within both NMT-1 and NMT-2 families suggests unique functions for each enzyme in vivo. At the mRNA level, both enzymes were identified in most human and mouse tissues examined, while a preliminary analysis of hNMT-1 and hNMT-2's substrate selectivity demonstrated that the enzymes have similar, but distinguishable, substrate preferences. One difference observed between hNMT-1 and hNMT-2 was that only hNMT-1 was processed to lower molecular weight isoforms upon expression in COS-7 cells. The potential biological significance of these hNMT-1 isoforms remains to be determined, but it is intriguing to speculate that in different cell types the extent of NMT processing could vary, allowing for the generation of distinct NMT protein profiles."

The major aims of this work were to design a procedure for the isolation of the thylakoid lumen which could be generally used to characterize lumenal proteins. The preparation was a stepwise procedure in which thylakoid membranes were isolated from intact chloroplasts. Loosely associated thylakoid surface proteins were removed, and following Yeda press fragmentation the lumenal content was recovered in the supernatant following centrifugation. The purity and yield of lumenal proteins were determined using appropriate marker proteins specific for the different chloroplast compartments. Quantitative immunoblot analyses showed that the recovery of soluble lumenal proteins was 60–65% (as judged by the presence of plastocyanin), whereas contamination with stromal enzymes was less than 1% (ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase) and negligible for thylakoid integral membrane proteins (D1 protein). Approximately 25 polypeptides were recovered in the lumenal fraction, of which several were identified for the first time. Enzymatic measurements and/or amino-terminal sequencing revealed the presence of proteolytic activities, violaxanthin de-epoxidase, polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase, as well as a novel prolyl cis/trans-isomerase.

The chloroplast is the photosynthetic organelle of green algae and higher plants. The chloroplast architecture comprises an envelope membrane, which encloses the soluble stroma as well as the highly specialized thylakoid membrane. The stromal compartment contains mainly the components of the Calvin cycle, which are required for the fixation of carbon dioxide. The thylakoids, on the other hand, carry out the light reactions of photosynthesis leading to the production of NADPH and ATP. The thylakoid membrane has a characteristic flat shape and is differentiated into appressed grana stacks and single non-appressed stroma-exposed lamellae. The inner surface of the thylakoid membrane encloses a narrow, continuous compartment, the lumen (1Andersson B. Barber J. Adv. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 1-53Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 2Hall D.O. Rao K.K. Photosynthesis. 5th Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1994Google Scholar). Electron microscopy studies of spinach thylakoids have suggested that the lumen is a densely packed space (3Weibull C. Albertsson P.-Å. J. Ultrastruct. Mol. Struct. Res. 1988; 100: 55-59Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). No isolation method has so far been available for obtaining a high yield of pure thylakoid lumen. Thus, the present knowledge of the lumen from a compositional and functional point of view is fragmentary and is gathered from several independent approaches, addressing only single aspects of this compartment. By developing a technique for obtaining inside-out thylakoids, the investigation of the membrane surface of the lumenal side became possible (4Andersson B. Åkerlund H.-E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 503: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This work contributed to the discovery of the extrinsic proteins PsbO, PsbP, and PsbQ (5Åkerlund H.-E. Jansson C.

Res. 1993; 38: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). More recent studies have shown that these subunits of photosystem II occur also as soluble lumenal proteins (9Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This pool of unassembled PsbO, PsbQ, and PsbP was resistant to proteolytic degradation and was capable of assembling into photosystem II (10Hashimoto A. Yamamoto Y. Theg S.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was found that during photoinhibitory conditions the extrinsic proteins were released from the membrane into the lumen (11Hundal T. Virgin I. Styring S. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys.

Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 302-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). So far all lumenal proteins have been found to be nuclear-encoded and synthesized as precursors in the cytoplasm. These precursor proteins have characteristic amino-terminal bipartite transit peptides, which direct their import into the chloroplast stroma and across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen (23von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 24Robinson C. Klösgen R.B. Plant Mol.

IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 145-159Google Scholar). On the basis of this property, bipartite transit peptides have become typical markers for lumenal proteins. However, not all chloroplast proteins encoded with such presequences are routed into the lumenal space. The PsbW protein and CFoII, for instance, are synthesized with bipartite transit peptides but have been shown to be integral proteins of the thylakoid membrane (26Michl D. Robinson C. Shackleton J.B.

In this study we have developed a procedure by which a lumenal fraction can be isolated in a highly pure form from spinach thylakoids. We have carried out the first systematic characterization of this compartment, and we show that the thylakoid lumen contains a high concentration of proteins, among which at least 25 distinct polypeptides can be identified. Several have been characterized in terms of enzymatic activity or amino-terminal sequence. Spinach (Spinacia oleracea) was grown hydroponically for 6 weeks with alternating periods of 10 h light and 14 h darkness. The general approach applied consists of three principal steps as follows: (i), preparation of chloroplasts, (ii) purification of carefully washed thylakoids, and (iii) rupture of thylakoids by a Yeda press and isolation of the lumenal content (Fig. 1). Spinach leaves (200 g) were blended twice for 5–10 s in 330 mm sorbitol, 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.15% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 4 mm sodium ascorbate, and 7 mmcysteine. The resulting slurry was filtered through four layers of nylon mesh (20 μm), and the filtrate was centrifuged 1 min at 1000 × g. The pellets were resuspended in 330 mm sorbitol, 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 10 mm KCl, centrifuged for 1 min at 1000 × g, and resuspended in 12–18 ml of the same buffer. The yield was 60–70% intact chloroplasts containing 50–60 mg of chlorophyll. The chloroplasts were diluted with 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate buffer (pH 7.8) to a final chlorophyll concentration of 0.2 mg ml−1 and resuspended in a glass homogenizer. The thylakoids were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 7500 ×g and sequentially washed in the same way twice with each of the following buffers: I, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate (pH 7.8) to remove the soluble stromal proteins; II, 2 mmTricine (pH 7.8), 300 mm sucrose to partially remove ATP synthase, the membrane-attached fraction of Rubisco, 1The abbreviations used are: Rubisco, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase; AC, accession number; Chl, chlorophyll; FNR, ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase; LHCII, light harvesting complex II; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl] glycine. and unidentified extrinsic thylakoid membrane proteins; III, 30 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 mm sucrose (fragmentation buffer) to equilibrate the thylakoids for Yeda press fragmentation. The thylakoid pellets were suspended in a small volume of fragmentation buffer to a concentration of 3.5–4.5 mg of chlorophyll ml−1 (total yield: 25–30 mg of chlorophyll). The washed thylakoids were then passed once through a Yeda press at a nitrogen pressure of 10 megapascals and centrifuged for 1 h at 200,000 ×g and 2 °C. The supernatant was separated from the pellet and centrifuged a second time under the same conditions to spin down residual membrane particles. The entire isolation procedure was performed on ice, and the chloroplasts and thylakoid membranes were purified under green light. The lumenal fraction was either used directly or stored in liquid nitrogen. The washed thylakoids (2 mg of chlorophyll ml−1) were incubated in the presence of 10 μm thermolysin (0.4 mg ml−1) for 2 min on ice in 100 mm sucrose, 30 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2. The digestion was stopped by adding EDTA to final concentration of 50 mm, and the thylakoids were washed twice with 100 mm sucrose, 30 mmHepes (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl, and 50 mm EDTA. These conditions were balanced to degrade the major part of peripheral proteins on the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane, without degrading too much of the integral membrane proteins. Harsher treatments were found to lead to leaky membranes followed by a loss of especially the lumenal part of the exposed stromal lamellae. Chlorophyll concentrations were measured as described (29Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4697) Google Scholar).

Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5333) Google Scholar). The standard used was bovine serum albumin. Oxygen evolution activities and intactness of the chloroplasts were measured with a Clarke-type electrode at 20 °C using potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) as the electron acceptor (32Leegood R.C.

Determination of molecular masses were performed by using the low molecular weight electrophoresis calibration kit from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. For immunoblotting analyses proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in a semidry electroblotter system (Millipore). The antisera used were raised in rabbits against the following spinach proteins: phosphoribulokinase (K.-H. Süss, Institute for Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research, Gatersleben); violaxanthin de-epoxidase (H.-E. Åkerlund, University of Lund); plastocyanin (P.-Å. Albertsson, University of Lund); PsbO, PsbP, PsbQ, the lumen fraction, and Rubisco (our own production). The immunoreactivity was detected using goat anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated horseradish peroxidase in combination with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Quantification was performed using a Fast Scan Personal Densitometer and the ImageQuant software from Molecular Dynamics. To be able to compare directly the results for the chlorophyll-free lumenal fractions with those of the chloroplast and thylakoids, a chlorophyll equivalent was used for the lumenal fraction. It was calculated as follows: [Lumeneq] = [Chl]thyl ×Vthyl/Vlumen. However, the amount of plastocyanin and ferredoxin-NADP reductase (FNR) in the lumenal fraction was determined from the difference between the content in the washed thylakoids and their residual membrane fragments.

Proteins were sequenced from polyvinylidene difluoride membrane following resolution by SDS-PAGE essentially as described (41Matsudaira P. J. Biol.

Ohlsson (University of Umeå) using an Applied Biosystems pulsed liquid phase sequenator (ABS 477A). Searches in the data bases of EMBL and SwissProt as well as sequence alignments were carried out using the Wisconsin GCG software (42Genetics Computer Group (1996) Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Version 9, Madison, WI.Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to obtain a preparation of thylakoid lumen in a yield and purity sufficiently high to make it generally useful for characterizing this chloroplast compartment. The developed method, as outlined in the scheme of Fig.1, starts with the isolation of intact spinach chloroplasts. The chloroplasts obtained were normally 60–70% intact and had an oxygen evolving activity of 140–185 μmol of O2 mg Chl−1 h−1. In the next step the chloroplasts were disrupted by osmotic shock, and the thylakoids were collected and purified by several washing steps. Soluble stromal proteins were effectively removed by 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate (pH 7.8), and 2 mm Tricine (pH 7.8) containing 300 mm sucrose was used to remove ATP synthase, membrane-attached Rubisco, and other unidentified peripheral thylakoid proteins. Finally, the thylakoids were equilibrated in fragmentation buffer; these thylakoids retained an oxygen evolution rate of 90–165 μmol of O2 mg Chl−1 h−1. The washed thylakoids were then fragmented by a Yeda press, and the released lumenal content was separated from the membrane fragments by two ultracentrifugation steps. The final fraction was free of chlorophyll and had a protein concentration of 0.3–0.5 mg ml−1, giving a total yield of 2–3 mg of protein from 200 g of spinach leaves. The separation during the course of the preparation was followed by electrophoretic analysis of the polypeptide pattern of the starting chloroplasts, the stromal fraction, the washed thylakoids, and the final lumenal preparation (Fig. 2). The dominant bands in the isolated chloroplasts (lane 1) were the large and small subunits of Rubisco and the LHCII. The two subunits of Rubisco and other soluble proteins were found in the stromal fraction (lane 2). The membrane-bound LHCII and other integral membrane proteins were recovered in the thylakoid fraction (lane 3). Finally, lane 4 shows the soluble lumenal proteins released after the disruption of the washed thylakoids and removal of the membrane fragments. As summarized in Table I, there were more than 25 polypeptides in the purified lumenal fraction. Furthermore, the polypeptide pattern (Fig. 2, lane 4) is clearly different from that of the other chloroplast subfractions. These polypeptides range in molecular mass from 14 to 100 kDa. There are 5 dominant, 10 to 12 medium abundance, and 8 to 10 low abundance polypeptides. Silver staining the polypeptides led to the detection of five additional bands in the molecular mass range of 20–45 kDa. Furthermore, an investigation of the low molecular mass polypeptides of the lumenal fraction by Tricine/SDS-PAGE (43Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10481) Google Scholar) revealed five additional low abundance polypeptides in the range of 6–14 kDa (not shown).Table IPolypeptides of the isolated thylakoid lumenApparent molecular massIdentityMethod of identificationkDa100?64.5Polyphenol oxidaseProtein sequencing57.5?54.0Large subunit of Rubisco and ?Immunoblotting40.0New protein (see Table IV)Protein sequencing38.0 and 37.5Ferredoxin NADP+reductaseProtein sequencing32.5PsbO proteinImmunoblotting, protein sequencing29.0 and 28.5New protein (see Table IV)Protein sequencing28.0?27.5?25.0PsbP proteinImmunoblotting, protein sequencing24.0?23.0?21.0?20.0?18.5?18.0PsbQ proteinImmunoblotting, protein sequencing17.6?17.4New protein (see TableIV)Protein sequencing17.2?16.5New protein (see Table IV)Protein sequencing15.5?15.0PlastocyaninImmunoblotting, protein sequencing14.0?6–14Five protein bandsTricine/SDS-PAGE Open table in a new tab Following this general description of the protein content of the isolated lumenal fraction, several different approaches were used (summarized in Table I) to identify the individual polypeptides. Initially three of the four major polypeptides (Fig. 2, lane 4) at positions 32.5, 25, and 18 kDa were immunologically identified as the extrinsic proteins PsbO, PsbP, and PsbQ of photosystem II. This is consistent with the observation that a soluble unassembled pool of these proteins occurs in the thylakoid lumen (9Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The fourth major protein of the lumenal fraction, with the apparent molecular mass of 15 kDa, was identified by immunoblotting as plastocyanin. The proteins of the lumenal fraction were systematically studied by amino-terminal protein sequencing. This confirmed the identification of plastocyanin, PsbO, PsbP, and PsbQ. Polyphenol oxidase was identified as a polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 64 kDa, and four new polypeptides were discovered at 40, 29, 17.4, and 16.5 kDa (see Tables I and IV). Finally, ferredoxin NADP+ reductase (FNR) was found to migrate at apparent molecular masses of 38 and 37.5 kDa.Table IVAmino-terminal sequences of four unknown proteins from the thylakoid lumenal fractionkDa1 3040.0VLISGPXIKD PEALLRYALP IDNKAIREVQ29.0ADLIQRRQRS EFQSDIKGIL YTVIKKNPDL17.4ANQRLPPLSN DPKRKE.... ..........16.5APLEDEDDLE LLEKVKRDRK KRLERQGAI. Open table in a new tab The detection of FNR, which is located on the stromal side of the thylakoid surface, prompted a more detailed analysis of contamination in the isolated lumenal fraction. Therefore, the washed thylakoids were treated by limited proteolysis with thermolysin prior to the Yeda press fragmentation. Lumenal proteins, unlike the contamination, should be protected against such proteolytic degradation. The conditions of proteolysis were designed to ensure degradation of most of the peripheral protein on the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane and to minimize membrane rupture. More extensive proteolysis could cause disruption of the thylakoid membrane, as was previously reported (44Carter D.P. Staehlin A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 2: 364-373Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The intensity of the polypeptide bands of the lumenal fraction following SDS-PAGE before (Fig. 2, lane 4) and after (Fig.2, lane 5) thermolysin treatment was compared by densitometric analysis of the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels using the PsbO protein as an internal reference protein. The data obtained from three different preparations demonstrated that most of the polypeptides of the lumenal fraction were not degraded, arguing that these proteins were located within the thylakoid lumen. Only in two cases were polypeptides significantly degraded (Fig. 2). A 40-kDa protein decreased in abundance by approximately 60%, whereas the 38-kDa FNR (Fig. 2) was degraded to 80–85%, which is consistent with its location at the stromal surface of the thylakoid membranes (1Andersson B. Barber J. Adv. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 1-53Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 2Hall D.O. Rao K.K. Photosynthesis. 5th Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1994Google Scholar). The FNR may have been sheared off the outer thylakoid surface during the Yeda press treatment, thereby ending up with the lumenal proteins in the supernatant following centrifugation. In another test for purity an immunoblot analysis was performed to quantify marker proteins associated with specific chloroplast compartments: plastocyanin as a soluble lumenal protein; PsbO as a lumenal extrinsic thylakoid-bound protein; the D1 reaction center protein of photosystem II as an integral membrane protein; the FNR for the outer thylakoid surface; Rubisco as the major stromal protein, and phosphoribulokinase as typical soluble stromal enzyme. As presented in Table II, 60–65% of the total amount of plastocyanin and 10% that of the extrinsic PsbO protein were recovered in the lumenal fraction. Furthermore, the lumenal fraction was free of D1 protein demonstrating the absence of contaminating thylakoid membranes. In addition, less than 1% of the total amount of the large subunit of Rubisco was present in the lumenal fraction. The major contamination was FNR. Between 10 and 40% of this enzyme was found in the lumen; this represents approximately 10% of the total protein content of the lumenal fraction.Table IIImmunological analyses of chloroplast subcompartment marker enzymesChloroplastsWashed thylakoidsLumenal fractionResidual thylakoid fragments%Thylakoid lumen Plastocyanin10060–7560–652–10 PsbO protein10080–901070–80Thylakoid membrane D1 protein100100–1100100–105 Ferredoxin-NADR+ reductase10040–6010–405–30Chloroplast stroma Rubisco (large subunit)1008–20<1NDaPhosphoribulokinase100Under detection limitNDND, not determined. Open table in a new tab ND, not determined. As an additional indication of stromal contaminations as well as to find possible extra chloroplast contaminants, we assayed for a number of different marker enzymes. These marker activities included phosphoribulokinase from the chloroplast stroma, catalase from the cytoplasm, peroxisomes, and vacuole, and the mitochondrial enzymes cytochrome c oxidase (inner membrane) and malate dehydrogenase (matrix). As shown in TableIII, the contamination of the isolated lumenal fraction by phosphoribulokinase was only 0.3% of the total activity of the isolated chloroplasts and that of catalase was even lower. The activity of cytochrome c oxidase in the chloroplasts was 0.007 mmol of oxidized cytochrome cmin−1 mg protein−1 and that of spinach mitochondria was 8 mmol of oxidized cytochrome cmin−1 mg protein−1. Furthermore, the activity of malate dehydrogenase was 0.5 mmol of oxidized NADH min−1 mg protein−1 and that of the spinach mitochondria was 330 mmol of oxidized NADH min−1 mg protein−1. Based on these values the contamination of the lumenal fraction by soluble mitochondrial proteins was estimated to be lower than 0.2%. The activity of cytochrome c oxidase was not detectable in the lumenal fraction.Table IIIActivities of marker enzymesChloroplastsWashed thylakoidsLumenal fractionResidual thylakoid fragmentsThylakoid lumen Polyphenol oxidase3-aμmol oxidized 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionic acid min−1 mg Chl−1.0.01 ± 0.010.09 ± 0.050.25 ± 0.050.02 ± 0.005 ViolaxanthinNDND18 ± 1.8ND De-epoxidase3-bμmol of violaxanthin min−1 g protein−1.Chloroplast stroma Phosphoribulokinase3-cmmol oxidized NADPH min−1 mg Chl−1.7 ± 10.07 ± 0.0010.024 ± 0.002NDMitochondria and cytoplasm Cytochrome c oxidase3-dmmol oxidized cytochrome c min−1 mg Chl−1.0.06 ± 0.0050.02 ± 0.0070ND Cytochrome c oxidase3-emmol oxidized cytochrome c min−1 mg protein−1.0.007 ± 0.00060.003 ± 0.0010ND Malate dehydrogenase3-fmmol oxidized NADH min−1 mg Chl−1.0.18 ± 0.020.14 ± 0.0020.05 ± 0.04ND Malate dehydrogenase3-gmmol oxidized NADH min−1 mg protein−1.NDND0.5 ± 0.3ND Catalasei341 ± 24014 ± 70.7 ± 0.2ND3-h μmol O2 mg h−1 Chl−1.3-a μmol oxidized 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionic acid min−1 mg Chl−1.3-b μmol of violaxanthin min−1 g protein−1.3-c mmol oxidized NADPH min−1 mg Chl−1.3-d mmol oxidized cytochrome c min−1 mg Chl−1.3-e mmol oxidized cytochrome c min−1 mg protein−1.3-f mmol oxidized NADH min−1 mg Chl−1.3-g mmol oxidized NADH min−1 mg protein−1."
https://openalex.org/W2067471234,"The Grb10 protein appears to be an adapter protein of unknown function that has been implicated in insulin receptor (IR) signaling. The interaction of this protein with the IR has been shown to be mediated in part by the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of Grb10. Here we demonstrate the existence of a second novel domain within Grb10 that interacts with the IR and insulin-like growth factor receptor in a kinase-dependent manner. This domain was localized to a region of approximately 50 amino acids, and we term it the BPS domain to denote its location between thePH and SH2 domains. The BPS domain does not bear any obvious resemblance to other known protein interaction domains but is highly conserved among the Grb10-related proteins Grb7 and Grb14. We show that the BPS domain interaction is dependent upon receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Furthermore, interaction of the BPS domain requires the kinase domain of the IR, since mutation of the paired tyrosine residues (Y1150F/Y1151F) within the IR activation loop dramatically reduced the interaction. Last, our data suggest that the presence of two distinct protein interaction domains may help to determine the specificity by which Grb10 interacts with different receptors. Specifically, the IR, which appears to interact most strongly with Grb10, interacts well with both the SH2 and BPS domains. Conversely, the insulin-like growth factor receptor and EGFR, which interact less avidly with Grb10, interact well only with the BPS domain or the SH2 domain, respectively.

Whether these proteins are sufficient to explain the diverse effects of insulin receptor signaling is a matter of intense investigation. In this regard, the recent discovery of the related proteins that interact with the IR termed Grb-IR, Grb10/IR-SV1, or GrbIRβ/Grb10 by several groups is of interest (23O'Neill T.J. Rose D.W.

These three Grb10 variants are derived from the same gene via alternative splicing and have recently been renamed Grb10α for Grb-IR and Grb10β for Grb10/IR-SV1 and Grb-IRβ/Grb10, the latter two being identical cDNAs. Grb10α contains a distinct amino terminus compared with Grb10β, and in addition, Grb10β contains an intact PH domain, which is partially deleted due to a splicing event in the Grb10α mRNA. Since the Grb10 domains that we are addressing in this paper are found in both the α and β forms of Grb10, for simplicity we will refer to the protein as Grb10 in the remainder of the paper. Grb10 (26Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1610-1630Google Scholar) is a member of a family of proteins that also includes Grb7 (27Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A.W. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V. D'Eustachio P. Moskow J.J.

These proteins share highly homologous amino acid sequences and common domains, including a C-terminal SH2 domain, a conserved proline-rich region within the N terminus, and a ∼300-amino acid conserved central domain that includes the PH domain and other conserved regions of unknown structure or function located both upstream and downstream of the PH domain (26Ooi J.

The Grb7/Grb10/Grb14 proteins were originally cloned by screening cDNA expression libraries with a labeled tyrosyl-phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal fragment of the EGFR (26Ooi J. Yajnik V.

However, neither Grb10 nor Grb14 have been demonstrated to interact efficiently with the EGFR in cells (26Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B.

Grb10 has also been identified using yeast two-hybrid methodologies using the cytoplasmic domains of the IR or IGFIR as “bait” (23O'Neill T.J. Rose D.W. Pillay T.S. Hotta K. Olefsky J.M.

The role that Grb10 plays in cellular signaling mediated by any of these receptor tyrosine kinases remains unclear, as do the roles of Grb7 and Grb14. The multidomain structure of these proteins suggests that they act as adapter molecules, but the signaling pathways that are affected and the nature of this effect remain to be identified. It has previously been shown that the SH2 domain located at the extreme C terminus of Grb10 is important for interaction with the IR (23O'Neill T.J. Rose D.W. Pillay T.S. Hotta K. Olefsky J.M.

These data are consistent with the previous demonstrations that (a) Grb10 interaction depends upon IR kinase activity in the two-hybrid assay, (b) in vitro interaction of the IR with Grb10-GST fusion proteins is insulin-dependent, and (c) coimmunoprecipitation of Grb10 with the IR is insulin-dependent (23O'Neill T.J.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3165-3167PubMed Google Scholar). However, some recent evidence has suggested that the SH2 domain of Grb10 may not fully explain the interaction of Grb10 with the IR. Specifically, Frantz et al. showed that a full-length Grb10-GST fusion protein was able to interact more efficiently with the IR in vitro than the SH2 domain alone (25Frantz J.D. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Ottinger E.A. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2659-2667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These authors suggested that the PH domain might play a role in mediating the Grb10 interaction, since a construct containing both the PH and SH2 domains showed more efficient interaction. To address this issue, we used the yeast two-hybrid system and assays of in vitro protein interaction to demonstrate that Grb10 does indeed contain a second domain capable of independently interacting with the IR in an insulin-dependent manner. We demonstrate that this novel domain is relatively small (∼50 amino acids) and is located between the PH and SH2 domains. We therefore term it the BPS domain to denote this location. We present data to suggest that the two binding domains within Grb10 may play a role in determining the specificity of receptor interaction with Grb10.

NWTb3 cells (a gift from Derek LeRoith) overexpressing the human IGFI receptors (44Blakesley V.A. Kato H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol.

GST fusion proteins were generated by introducing Grb10 cDNA fragments corresponding to the PH domain (amino acids 216–358), the SH2 domain (amino acids 435–536), BPS plus SH2 domains (amino acids 358–536), and various other fragments surrounding the BPS region (358–434, 364–412, 369–412, 358–402, 364–402, and 369–402) into the pGEX5X plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After transformation of Escherichia coli strain DH5α, induction of fusion protein expression with isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside, and cell collection and lysis by sonication, the proteins were purified using immobilized glutathione-agarose beads (38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J.S. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). Cultured CHO/IR cells, NWTb4 cells, or 5HR11 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 6 mmNa2HPO4, 1 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) prewarmed to 37 °C, stimulated with or without ligands for 10 min at 37 °C, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEGTA, 20 mm Na4P2O7, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.6, 1.0% Triton X-100) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C and incubated overnight (∼500 μg of total protein/reaction) at 4 °C with (∼3–4 μg) immobilized GST fusion proteins. After extensive washing with 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100, the proteins that coprecipitated with the Grb10 or control GST proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell), and immunoblotted with either anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20, Transduction Laboratories) or antibodies against the IR (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). NWTb3 cells, which overexpress the IGFIR, were maintained as described previously (19Rose D.W. Salteil A.R. Majumdar M. Decker S.J. Olefsky J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cells were rendered quiescent by serum deprivation for 24–36 h prior to injection. GST-Grb10 fusion proteins were expressed in DH5α cells and purified with glutathione-agarose beads by standard techniques (38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J.S. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were microinjected at a concentration of 3.5 mg/ml, and preimmune sheep IgG was added to the protein for detection purposes. Parallel injections of sheep IgG alone were also performed. One hour after injection, the cells were stimulated as indicated with 100 ng/ml IGFI. A solution of 3-bromo-5′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was also added to the medium for 16 h to label newly synthesized DNA. Following the labeling period, the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence as described by Xiao et al. (9Xiao S. Rose D.W. Sasaoka T. Maegawa H. Burke Jr., T.R. Roller P.P.

Briefly, the cells were stained with a rat monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody (Accurate Scientific), followed by a tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG antibody to detect the injected cells. This technique results in red nuclear staining in cells that have progressed to S phase of the cell cycle and green cytoplasmic staining in the injected cells. Results were analyzed and quantitated using an epifluorescence photomicroscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Grb10 has been shown to interact directly with the IR and IGFIR (23O'Neill T.J. Rose D.W.

We had previously reported that the IR interacts strongly with a region of Grb10 that spans amino acids 358–536, a region that includes the SH2 domain. Since this interaction was kinase-dependent in the two-hybrid assay and because in vitro interaction of Grb10-GST fusions with cell-derived receptors was insulin-dependent (23O'Neill T.J. Rose D.W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22506-22513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we concluded that the interaction was mediated via the SH2 domain. In fact, it has been demonstrated that the SH2 domain of Grb10 does mediate an interaction with the IR (24Liu F. Roth R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3165-3167PubMed Google Scholar). However, in subsequent experiments we found that mutagenesis of the critical arginine (to lysine) within the SH2 FLVRES motif, which would be predicted to disrupt phosphotyrosine interactions, had only minor effects upon full-length Grb10 interaction with the IR despite the demonstration that the mutant SH2 domain showed no interaction by itself. This prompted us to conclude that an additional interaction domain must exist within Grb10. To delineate this binding domain, we again utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to test the interaction of a number of Grb10 fragments with the IR. As shown in Fig. 1, full-length Grb10 interacted well with the IR as did the full-length Grb10, which contained a single amino acid substitution in the SH2 domain, in which Arg462 within the conserved FLVRES motif was substituted with Lys. This substitution is known to cause a dramatically reduced interaction with phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in a variety of SH2 domains. To ensure that this mutation would indeed reduce the interaction of the Grb10 SH2 domain with the IR, we expressed a fusion protein that consisted of only the mutated SH2 domain (SH2-R/K, amino acids 413–536). As expected, this mutated SH2 domain showed no interaction with the IR, despite equal expression levels compared with the intact SH2 domain (data not shown). To localize the additional interac"
https://openalex.org/W2060692647,"We recently identified a novel prostaglandin transporter called PGT (Kanai, N., Lu, R., Satriano, J. A., Bao, Y., Wolkoff, A. W., and Schuster, V. L. (1995)Science 268, 866–869). Based on initial functional studies, we have hypothesized that PGT might mediate the release of newly synthesized prostaglandins (PG), epithelial transport of PGs, or metabolic clearance of PGs. Here we examined the mechanism of PGT transport as expressed in HeLa cells and Xenopus oocytes, using isotopic PG influx and efflux studies. In both native HeLa cells and oocytes, cell membranes were poorly permeable to PGs. In contrast, in oocytes injected with PGT mRNA, the PG influx permeability coefficient was 90–157 times that of oocytes injected with water. The rank order substrate profile was PGF2α ≈ PGE2 > TXB2 ≫ 6 keto-PGF1α. PG influx displayed an overshoot with rapid accumulation of tracer PGE2, followed by a gradual return to baseline. Based on estimated oocyte volumes, the PGT-mediated accumulation of PGE2 reached steady state at intra-oocyte concentrations 25-fold higher than the external media. The accumulation of PG was not due to intracellular binding or metabolism. PGT-mediated uptake was ATP- and temperature-dependent, but not sodium-dependent, and was inhibited by disulfonic stilbenes, niflumic acid, and the thiol reactive anion MTSES (Na(2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate). [3H]PGE2 efflux from PGT-transfected HeLa cells was stimulated by external (trans) PGE2 in a dose-dependent fashion and was inhibited by bromcresol green and 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate. Membrane depolarization inhibited uptake of [3H]PGE2, consistent with a model of net outward movement of negative charge during the translocation event. These findings suggest that PGT mediates [3H]PGE2 accumulation via obligatory, electrogenic anion exchange.

They elicit potent actions on the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory and reproductive systems, and are important mediators of inflammation, fever, and pain (2Smith W.L. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). As autacoids, PGs are synthesized by intracellular enzymes at or near their sites of action before they are presented to adjacent PG receptors. Thereafter, extracellular PGs are metabolized in situ within seconds before they are able to reach the general circulation (3Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6713-6721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Feigen L.P. Chapnick B.M. Flemming J.E. Flemming J.M. Kadowitz P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 233: H573-H579PubMed Google Scholar). At least in the case of PGE2and PGF2α, loss of biologic activity is due to cellular uptake followed by intracellular oxidation (5Samuelsson B. Fed. Proc. 1972; 31: 1442-1450PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ferreira S.H. Vane J.R. Nature. 1967; 216: 868-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 7Piper P.J. Vane J.R. Wyllie J.H.

At physiologic pH, PGs predominate as the charged organic anion (9Uekama K. Hiryama F. Tanaka H. Takematsu K. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1978; 26: F58Google Scholar) and diffuse poorly through the lipid bilayer (10Bito L.Z. Baroody R.A. Am. J.

Facilitated, carrier-mediated PG transport has been demonstrated by many diverse tissues including the lung (8Anderson M.W. Eling T.E. Prostaglandins. 1976; 11: 645-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Eling T.E. Anderson M.W. Agents Actions. 1976; 6: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), liver (13Bito L.Z. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Comp. Physiol. 1972; 43: 65-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), kidney (14Irish III, J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1979; 237: F268-F273PubMed Google Scholar), vagina and uterus (15Bito L.Z. Spellane P.J. Prostaglandins. 1974; 8: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and blood-brain and blood-intraocular fluid barriers (16Bito L.Z. Salvador E.V. Exp. Eye Res. 1972; 14: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The clearance and metabolism of PGs from the pulmonary circulation has been widely studied using the isolated, perfused rat lung model where concentrative uptake of PGs has been described followed by the appearance of metabolites in the venous effluent (8Anderson M.W. Eling T.E. Prostaglandins. 1976; 11: 645-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Bito L.Z. Baroody R.A. Reitz M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 232: E383-E387PubMed Google Scholar). Substances that inhibit PG transport reduce PG inactivation by the lung (18Pitt B.R. Forder J.R. Gillis C.N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 1983; 227: 531-537PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, whereas PGE1, PGF2α, PGD2, and PGI2 are all good substrates for the oxidizing enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, PGI2 escapes pulmonary metabolism (8Anderson M.W. Eling T.E. Prostaglandins. 1976; 11: 645-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These phenomena are best explained by selective, carrier-mediated PG transport. Transepithelial PG transport has also been clearly demonstrated in several tissues. In the brain where PGs are ineffectively metabolized (19Nakano J. Prancan A.V. Moore S.E. Brain Res. 1972; 39: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), accumulation of PGs in the extracellular fluids of the brain would be expected to have adverse effects. Transepithelial transport of PGs across the blood-brain barrier to sites of cellular uptake and metabolism would therefore be necessary for removal of locally released PGs. Indeed, saturable and inhibitable carrier-mediated transport of PG has been demonstrated in tissues of the blood-brain and blood-intraocular fluid barriers, as well as across the rabbit vagina (20Bito L.Z. Nature. 1975; 256: 134-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Bito L.Z. Davson H. J. Physiol. 1974; 236: 39P-40PPubMed Google Scholar), and the renal proximal tubule (14Irish III, J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1979; 237: F268-F273PubMed Google Scholar). It is less clear if a carrier-mediated process facilitates the release of intracellular PGs across the cell membrane. Newly synthesized PGs, localized in the cell cytosol (22Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar), might exit from the cell via a permease or via diffusion through the plasma membrane. On the other hand, as PGs are synthesized on the luminal surface of the endoplasmic reticulum they may conceivably be released from the lumen of the ER via fusion with the plasma membrane in a sort of “secretory pathway.” Until recently, little has been known about PG transport at a molecular level. Our laboratory recently identified a broadly expressed PG transporter (PGT) (1Kanai N. Lu R. Satriano J.A. Bao Y. Wolkoff A.W. Schuster V.L. Science. 1995; 268: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In the present study, the mechanisms of PG transport by PGT were investigated both in transfected HeLa cells and in PGT-expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes. Our results provide evidence for active, energy-dependent accumulation of PGs as the organic anion via an exchange mechanism. All salts were of analytic grade, and were purchased from Sigma. Succinic acid, malic acid, glutamic acid, α-ketoglutaric acid, aspartic acid, fumaric acid, oxaloacetic acid, and lactic acid were purchased from Sigma. The disulfonic stilbenes H2-DIDS and DIDS were purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL), niflumic acid was purchased from Sigma, and MTSES−/MTSEA+ were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (Ontario, Canada). Tritiated PGs were from NEN Life Science Products Inc. (Boston, MA). All chemicals were of the purest grade available. Full-length PGT cDNAs cloned in pGEM-3z with coding strand downstream of the T7 promoter were transfected into HeLa cells. Cells grown to 80% confluence on 35-mm dishes were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7–3 (23Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar) for 30 min and then transfected by adding PGT cDNA (10 μg/ml) and Lipofectin (20 μl/ml, Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Transfection with the plasmid pBluescript was used as a negative control. After 3 h of incubation, the medium was changed (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium plus 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin) and the cells were maintained overnight in humidified incubators with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Isotopic influx and efflux experiments were performed 18–22 h after transfection. The cell monolayers were washed twice with a balanced salt solution (BSS) (135 mm NaCl, 13 mm H-Hepes, 13 mm Na-Hepes, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5 mm KCl, and 28 mmd-glucose). Influx measurements were initiated by the addition of tritiated PGE2 (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) to the flux media (BSS) to reach a final concentration of <1.5 nm, which is well below the Michaelis constant (Km) for PGT (1Kanai N. Lu R. Satriano J.A. Bao Y. Wolkoff A.W. Schuster V.L. Science. 1995; 268: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Influx measurements were carried out at room temperature over 10 min to 2 h. Isotopic influx experiments were terminated by aspiration of the incubation media followed by two rapid washings with ice-cold 5% bovine serum albumin in BSS and two additional washings with ice-cold BSS. The cells were scraped into 1 ml of saline, mixed with liquid scintillation mixture (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA), and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Influx values in all experiments were calculated as femtomoles per mg of protein per nanomolar concentration [3H]PGE2 and expressed as means ± S.E. from duplicate monolayers. In some experiments, uptake studies were performed in the presence of unlabeled substrates (succinic acid, malic acid, glutamic acid, α-ketoglutaric acid, aspartic acid, fumaric acid, oxaloacetic acid, and lactic acid). HeLa cell monolayers were preloaded with isotopic PGE2 by incubation with [3H]PGE2 for 20 min prior to efflux measurements. Immediately after incubation, cells were washed twice with room temperature BSS to remove adherent [3H]PGE2. At time 0, 1 ml of BSS was added to each monolayer. At each subsequent time interval (2–40-min intervals in different experiments) the 1 ml of efflux media was removed for scintillation counting and 1 ml of fresh BSS was added. At the end of the experiment, the cell monolayers were scraped and analyzed by scintillation counting. The remaining counts/min in the cells was added to the sum of the effluxed counts to estimate the amount of isotope loaded. Efflux rate constants were calculated from curve fitting with an iterative method (Deltagraph, Monterey, CA) using a single-exponential. In separate experiments, efflux was measured in BSS with various concentrations of unlabeled PGE2, or in BSS with unlabeled PGE2 and 300 μm DIDS or 50 μm bromcresol green (BCG). DIDS and BCG were added for 2 min before unlabeled PGE2. Mature female X. laevis frogs (Xenopus I, Ann Arbor, MI) were anesthetized by hypothermia and 0.4% topical tricane. Ovarian tissue was removed via a 1-cm flank incision, then minced and placed in 2 mg/ml collagenase A (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) for 1–2 h at 20 °C with gentle continuous agitation to remove the follicular layer. The oocytes were then washed with ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes, 1.8 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5). Mature oocytes (stage IV-V) were separated and stored in ND96E (ND96 plus 2.5 mm pyruvate, 0.5 mm sodium phosphate, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin) at 18 °C overnight prior to injection. mRNA was prepared using the mRNA capping kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by linearizing plasmids encoding PGT with XbaI and transcribing capped RNA using T7 RNA polymerase. 30 ng of mRNA in 50 nl of water were injected into individual oocytes using a microinjection apparatus. 50 nl of water were injected into oocytes as a control. Injected oocytes were incubated in ND96E for 2–3 days prior to isotopic PG influx and efflux studies. The incubation medium was changed daily. Preliminary experiments indicated that tracer PG uptake was the same in ND96 and BSS; accordingly, all fluxes were determined in the latter medium. In some cases sodium chloride was substituted with either choline chloride or lithium chloride. Tritiated prostaglandins were added to the flux media to reach a final concentration of 0.2–1.7 nm. A preliminary time course of PGT-mediated [3H]PGE2 uptake was performed over 3 h at room temperature. Subsequent influx experiments were performed over 30 min, during which PG uptake was linear with time. Groups of 10–15 oocytes were placed in micro-Eppendorf tubes containing 500 μl of the appropriate influx media and isotopic PG. Isotopic influx was terminated by removal of the flux media, followed by rapid transfer through two 1-ml washes of ice-cold 5% bovine serum albumin in BSS, followed by 2 additional washes of BSS. At the end of the transport assay, a 100-μl aliquot of the flux media was measured by scintillation counting. Individual oocytes were transferred to 10-ml scintillation vials containing 500 μl of 10% SDS, scintillation fluid was added, and the oocytes were counted. All influx values were calculated as femtomoles per oocyte per nanomolar concentration of substrate and expressed as means ± S.E. The intracellular concentration of isotopic PG was calculated from the measured counts/min in an estimated oocyte aqueous volume of 450 nl (24Zhang R.B. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C26-C34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All oocytes from a single experiment were obtained from the same frog. In some experiments, influx measurements were determined in the presence of inhibitors of organic anion transport (disulfonic stilbenes or niflumic acid), the water-soluble, thiol reactive anion MTSES−, or its cationic version MTSEA+. Inhibitors were preincubated with oocytes prior to the start of the transport assay and/or introduced with isotope where indicated. Some oocytes were voltage clamped by the addition of 100 mm KCl prior to the influx assay. The cell membrane potential was determined in oocytes in BSS or high [K] using standard microelectrode techniques. For trans-stimulation experiments, uptake assays were performed on oocytes immediately after injection with unlabeled PGE2 or candidate substrates (α-ketoglutaric acid, succinic acid, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and lactic acid). Individual oocytes from a group in which PGT expression had been confirmed by tracer uptake were injected with 50 nl of BSS containing [3H]PGE2. Immediately after injection, an individual oocyte was placed in a 1.5-ml micro-Eppendorf tube containing 200 μl of BSS with or without unlabeled PGE2. At each subsequent 10-min time interval, 190 μl of efflux media was removed for scintillation counting and 190 μl of fresh efflux media was replaced. At the end of the experiment, the oocyte was lysed with 10% SDS (25Humphreys B.D. Jiang L. Chernova M.N. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1295-C1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The counts/min in the lysed oocyte was added to the sum of the effluxed counts to estimate the amount of isotope injected. The data were plotted as % cpm remaining versus time. Curve fitting was performed as described previously. Intracellular binding of PG was determined by three methods. First, oocytes and HeLa cell monolayers were preincubated in 0.015% Triton X-100 (26Thelestam M. Mollby R. Med. Biol. 1976; 54: 39-49PubMed Google Scholar) prior to incubation with BSS containing [3H]PGE2. The degree of intracellular PG binding was determined by the increase in cell associated [3H]PGE2 in intact versuspermeabilized cells. Second, oocytes were homogenized in a micro-Eppendorf tube using a pestle and the cell contents mixed in 1 ml of BSS media containing [3H]PGE2 in concentrations similar to those used in the transport assays (approximately 1 nm). The mixture (100–200 μl) was dialyzed against BSS (80 ml) using the Microdialyzer System 500 (Pierce) in the static mode. Prior to initiation of dialysis and at hourly intervals, 25–50 μl were removed from a sample well and counted. Third, PGT-expressing oocytes were subjected to the usual [3H]PGE2 influx, washed, and mechanically lysed in BSS. The accumulated [3H]PGE2 was dialyzed as described above to determine the degree of intracellular binding. To determine if the isotopic counts accumulated in PGT-expressing oocytes represented native PGE2 or metabolites, PGT-expressing oocytes were subjected to a 30-min [3H]PGE2 uptake assay and washed as described previously. The oocytes were then extracted in 100% methanol, centrifuged in methanol at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant stored on dry ice for HPLC analysis. HPLC analysis with radiomatic detection was performed using a Phenomenex Ultramex C-18 column. The mobile phase was: A, H2O, 0.05% acetic acid with pH adjusted to 5.5 with ammonium hydroxide, and B, methanol:acetonitrile (1:1) at an initial composition of 10% B followed by a linear gradient to 55% B in 45 min and a second linear gradient to 100% B in the next 10 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. A sample of the initial isotopic influx media was used as a control. The PG permeability of PGT-injected oocytes compared with water-injected oocytes was determined from the kinetics of isotopic PG influx and efflux. The PG permeability coefficient P (cm·s−1) was calculated from the relation Jsolute (mol·s−1) = P (cm·s−1)·SA (cm2)·Δ concentration (moles·cm−3), where J is the solute flux, SA is the oocyte surface area (0.045 cm2) assuming a smooth oocyte surface (24Zhang R.B. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C26-C34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Δ concentration is the difference in solute concentration between inside and outside the oocyte. In the influx experiments, we assumed that Δ concentration was the PG concentration in the influx media (no intracellular PG at the initiation of the assay). In the efflux experiments, we took Δ concentration as the concentration of intracellular PG, calculated from the mean intracellular isotopic PG during the efflux period. Inhibitors were added at various concentrations during [3H]PGE2 uptake. K½ was determined by relating the uninhibited uptake rate to the inhibited uptake rate calculated from the relation, K1/2=[v(i)/v−v(i)]·Km[i]/[S]+KmEquation 1 where v = uptake without inhibitor, v(i) = uptake with inhibitor, and [i] = inhibitor concentration. Since [[3H]PGE2] was nearly 100-fold less than Km, the equation may be simplified to K½ = [v(i)/v −v(i)]·[i] (27Neame K.D. Richards T.G. Elementary Kinetics of Membrane Carrier Transport. John Wiley & Sons, New York1972: 56-79Google Scholar). Some PGT-expressing oocytes were incubated in 3 mmiodoacetic acid in N2 equilibrated BSS for 3 h prior to the transport assay. As a control, oocytes from the same group were incubated in standard air-equilibrated BSS without iodoacetate. The intracellular ATP concentration was also measured in similarly treated oocytes using an ATP assay (Sigma) based on the enzymatic reaction described by Bucher (28Bucher T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1947; 1: 292Crossref Scopus (322) Google Scholar). It has been previously reported that PGs at physiologic pH diffuse poorly across lipid bilayers. Here we determined the permeability coefficients (P), calculated from the means of the solute fluxes, for 10-min PGE2 influx and efflux in native Xenopus oocytes (Table I). Efflux coefficients were obtained by measuring the amount of [3H]PGE2release into the external media over the first 10 min following injection of [3H]PGE2. As shown in Fig.1, this 10-min efflux was linear over intraoocyte concentrations from 35 to 380 nm[3H]PGE2, suggesting simple diffusion across the lipid bilayer. The permeability coefficient for efflux is the same as for influx, indicating that PG entry and exit from native Xenopus oocytes occurs by simple diffusion. Permeability coefficients for mannitol and para-aminohippurate (data not shown) were in agreement with those published by others (29Ip T.K. Aebischer P. Galletti P.M. Am. Soc. Artif. Intern. Organs Trans. 1988; 34: 351-355Google Scholar, 30Ren S. Das A. Lien E.J. J. Drug Target. 1996; 4: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), indicating that our oocytes are comparable to those reported in the literature.Table IPermeability coefficients for PGE2 in native X. laevis oocytesPermeability coefficients, × 10−5 cm/sInflux0.11 ± 0.1Efflux0.15 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab We previously reported that transient PGT expression in HeLa cell monolayers resulted in PG influxes with a clear rank order for various PG substrates (31Itoh S. Lu R. Bao Y. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. Schuster V.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 738-742PubMed Google Scholar). Here we established the Xenopus oocyte as a PGT expression system as follows. PGT-mediated [3H]PGE2 influx in oocytes increased as a function of the amount of injected mRNA (0–25 ng/oocyte) and peaked 3–5 days after injection (data not shown). PGT caused significant increases in tritiated PG influx when compared with water-injected oocytes with the following rank order profile: PGF2α ≈ PGE2 > TXB2 ≫ 6-keto-PGF1α. This is similar to the rank order of PGT expressed in mammalian cells (1Kanai N. Lu R. Satriano J.A. Bao Y. Wolkoff A.W. Schuster V.L.

In PGT-expressing oocytes, the permeability coefficients for PGF2α, TXB2, and PGE2 were increased 157-, 90-, and 49-fold, respectively, over that of water-injected oocytes. For 6-keto-PGF1α and AA, the PGT-associated increase in permeability was only 7- and 1.5-fold, respectively, that of water-injected oocytes (Table II).Table IIPermeability coefficients for prostanoid influxSubstrateInflux permeability coefficients, × 10−5 cm/sH2O-injected oocytesPGT-expressing oocytesAA2.90 ± 0.374.50 ± 0.33PGF2α0.04 ± 0.016.30 ± 0.60PGE20.11 ± 0.015.40 ± 1.50TXB20.02 ± 0.011.80 ± 0.406-Keto-PGF1α0.04 ± 0.010.28 ± 0.10 Open table in a new tab In both PGT-transfected HeLa cell monolayers and PGT-expressing oocytes, influx rates showed an overshoot phenomenon. As shown in Fig.2 A, [3H]PGE2 influx in PGT-transfected HeLa cells showed a rapid accumulation of [3H]PGE2 over 10 min, a plateau by about 20 min, and then a return to baseline by 120 min. This time course is most consistent with a model of exchange whereby the accumulation of PG is coupled to the counterflow of another substrate down its concentration gradient, which is dissipated over time. As shown in Fig. 2 B, [3H]PGE2 influx in PGT-expressing oocytes also showed an overshoot that peaked at approximately 150 min. The different time courses observed between the oocytes and HeLa cell monolayers are mostly attributed to their differences in cell surface area and volume. Based on the oocyte volume, apparent intracellular [PGE2] plateaued at concentrations 25-fold that of the external PG concentration. To determine whether this apparent concentrative uptake might simply represent passive entry followed by intracellular binding, we tested the effect of cell membrane permeabilization on PG uptake in oocytes. We reasoned that a maneuver to render plasma membranes permeable to small molecules the size of PG's (26Thelestam M. Mollby R. Med. Biol. 1976; 54: 39-49PubMed Google Scholar) would either: (a) increase oocyte-associated counts if PG entry across the plasma membrane were the rate-limiting step in gaining access to intracellular binding site(s); or (b) decrease oocyte-associated counts, by introducing a leak pathway, if PGT served to actively accumulate PGs against a concentration gradient. Water-injected and PGT-expressing oocyte membranes were permeabilized with 0.015% Triton X-100 and subjected to tracer PGE2 uptake. As shown in Fig.3, water-injected oocytes were poorly permeable to [3H]PGE2. When water-injected oocytes were permeabilized, they showed a small increase in [3H]PGE2 influx, which saturated at 30 min. This accumulation likely represents low levels of intracellular binding of [3H]PGE2. In contrast, PGT-expressing oocytes were able to actively accumulate [3H]PGE2 to intracellular concentrations 12-fold higher than that of the external medium (60 min). Membrane permeabilization of PGT-injected oocytes led to a decrease of oocyte-associated counts to a level consistent with a low, but finite, intracellular binding capacity estimated to be approximately 5 nm. When we account for this level of intracellular PG binding, we observe peak concentrative uptake of unbound [3H]PGE2 up to 20-fold greater than that of the external media (Fig. 2 B). The important point is that Triton decreased PG uptake, consistent with active, but not passive transport by PGT. In addition, we determined the level of intracellular binding of PGE2 in HeLa cell monolayers by comparing cell associated [3H]PGE2 in intact versuspermeabilized cells. As with oocytes, we found a low and finite level of [3H]PGE2 binding in HeLa cells. There was a 2-fold increase in cell-associated [3H]PGE2after cells were permeabilized as compared with a 80–100-fold increase in PGT-mediated counts in intact cells (data not shown). However, because we do not accurately know cell volumes we were unable to calculate transmembrane gradients in transfected monolayers. To further exclude the possibility that the apparent “accumulation” of tracer counts is due to intracellular binding, oocyte cell contents from either water-injected or PGT-expressing oocytes were mixed with [3H]PGE2 and dialyzed. Fig.4 represents dialysis rates through membranes of 3500 Mr cutoff of: 1) [3H]PGE2 in BSS alone (unbound); 2) [3H]PGE2 in 5% bovine serum albumin (bound) (32Robinson C. Hoult J.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); and 3) [3H]PGE2 mixed with oocyte contents (n = 20). In addition, 20 PGT-expressing oocytes were subjected to [3H]PGE2 uptake and washing, as described above, and were then homogenized and dialyzed to determine if oocytes expressing PGT exhibited binding of [3H]PGE2. [3H]PGE2in 5% bovine serum albumin was substantially less dialyzable than [3H]PGE2 in BSS. In contrast, the dialysis curve of [3H]PGE2 mixed with homogenized oocyte contents did not differ from that of unbound controls, indicating minimal or no binding of [3H]PGE2in native oocytes. Furthermore, [3H]PGE2 that had been taken up by PGT-expressing oocytes was as readily dialyzable as that in the BSS controls, indicating that the accumulated [3H]PGE2 in PGT-expressing oocytes was not extensively bound. Another mechanism for apparent “uphill” concentrative transport could be intra-oocyte degradation/metabolism of PGE2, such that an inwardly directed gradient for native PGE2 was maintained. To determine if metabolic breakdown of influxed [3H]PGE2 had occurred, 20 PGT-expressing oocytes were subjected to a 30-min [3H]PGE2uptake assay, after which their contents were extracted in methanol, centrifuged, and analyzed by HPLC.

We analyzed roles for and the sites of action for the cAMP-dependent protein kinases (cAPKs) in apoptosis induced in human neutrophils by in vitro storage, cycloheximide (CHX) exposure, and anti-Fas exposure. Treatment with 8-chlorophenylthio-cAMP (8-CPT-cAMP) prolonged the time required for 50% of the cells to exhibit apoptotic morphology (t50) from 16.3 to 41.8 h (in vitro culture), from 2.4 to 7.8 h (CHX), and from 4.8 to 6.5 h (anti-Fas). CHX ± 8-CPT-cAMP did not significantly alter resting intracellular calcium levels and H-89, a selective inhibitor of cAPK, had no effect on apoptosis in the absence of the analogue. In contrast, site-selective cAMP analogues that specifically activated the type I cAPK, but not type II cAPK, synergistically attenuated apoptosis. Exposure to 8-CPT-cAMP delayed, in parallel, the activity of caspase-3 (CPP-32β), whereas mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) inhibitor, PD98059, had no effect on CHX-induced apoptosis ± 8-CPT-cAMP. Together these results indicate that type I cAPK activation is necessary and sufficient to mediate cAMP-induced delay in human neutrophil apoptosis induced by several mechanisms and suggest that one of the major sites of cAPK action is upstream of caspase-3 (CPP-32β) activation.

Roles for caspase proteases in apoptosis have been analyzed in several cell types but have not been investigated in neutrophils.Intracellular signaling mechanisms typically involve protein kinases as major regulators of cellular processes (11Hunter T.

This activates downstream signaling and transcription events, which likely account for recognized roles for cAMP in neutrophil chemotaxis (15Harvath L. Robbins J.D. Russell A.A. Seamon K.B. J.

The cAPK exists as two major isoforms, type I and type II, with different R subunits, RI and RII subunits, respectively (12Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 13Taylor S.S. Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten-Eyck L.F. Sowadski J.M. Annu. Rev.

Academic Press, Inc., Orlando1986: 43-111Google Scholar). The R subunits exhibit two different cAMP binding sites, designated sites A (or site 2) and B (or site 1), which interact with positive cooperativity for binding cyclic nucleotides, activating the C subunit and regulating physiological responses (14Beebe S.J. Corbin J.D. Krebs E.G. Boyer P.D. 3rd. Ed. The Enzymes. 17. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando1986: 43-111Google Scholar, 21Beebe S.J. Blackmore P.F. Chrisman T.D. Corbin J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 118-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This positive cooperativity provides a physiological amplification mechanism for cAMP-mediated events that occur through cAPK and a means for distinguishing between activation of type I and type II cAPK by using cAMP analogues that bind differently to sites A and B on type I and type II cAPK.In the following studies, we utilized three different models for apoptosis, i.e. in vitro storage, cycloheximide exposure, and anti-Fas exposure, to examine the roles for cAMP and cAPK and potential sites of action in this process. Apoptosis was quantified using morphologic changes and annexin V-FITC binding as markers. cAPK activity was manipulated by cAMP analogue exposure, inhibition using selective inhibitors, and synergistic activation with type-specific cAMP analogue pairs.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar) were utilized to define sites of convergence between cAPK and apoptosis pathways. The data show that stimulation of cAPK activity delays apoptosis in all three model systems and that activation of type I cAPK is responsible for the observed effects by delaying the activation of the cysteine protease, caspase-3.DISCUSSIONNeutrophils are terminally differentiated cells that survive a limited time in the peripheral blood and tissues. Because of their central roles in host defense and acute inflammation, the numbers of cells available and the duration of their survival are significant to survival of the host. The signals and mechanisms that control production and survival of these cells are incompletely understood, but both appear to involve apoptosis, the physiologic form of cellular death that is internally controlled by the cell. We sought to examine the roles of second messenger, Ca2+-based, and cAMP-based signaling in human neutrophil apoptosis.Since cAMP was the first second messenger discovered (35Sutherland E.W. Science. 1972; 177: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) and is important for regulation of vital functions (e.g.proliferation, differentiation, gene transcription) in essentially all organisms, we focused our studies on cAMP and the cAPK in neutrophils. Cyclic AMP regulates apoptosis in several cell types, inhibiting or stimulating the process depending on the cell type and stage of differentiation (17Rossi A.G. Cousin J.M. Dransfield I. Lawson M.F. Chilvers E.R. Haslett C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 18Aoshiba K. Nagai A. Konno K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 19Duprez E. Gjertsen B.T. Bernard O. Lanotte M. Døskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8332-8340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fladmark K.E. Gjertsen B.T. Døskeland S.O. Vintemyr O.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The studies reported here clearly demonstrate that cAMP delays and does not inhibit apoptosis in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in human neutrophils. Furthermore, activation of cAPK is required for this effect, as H-89, a potent and selective inhibitor of cAPK (33Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), neither induced apoptosis itself nor delayed apoptosis resulting from in vitrostorage, cycloheximide, or anti-Fas exposure. This suggests that basal levels of cAPK activity do not play significant roles in neutrophil apoptosis. Use of site-selective cAMP analogues allowed clear demonstration that the type I cAPK, but not the type II, mediates the delay in apoptosis. This is consistent with the observation that the type I cAPK is the predominant isoform in human neutrophils, comprising about 85% of total cAPK. The complete lack of synergism when type II pairs were used indicates that the type II cAPK is either unnecessary, not sufficient, or localized (36Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) in a compartment that is not exposed to substrates needed for delaying apoptosis. It could be argued that the levels of type II cAPK are below the levels of sensitivity for this method. However, this is unlikely because very low levels of cAMP and cAPK activation are required for cAPK-mediated events, and synergism is a result of the cooperative activation of cAPK, which serves as a physiologically relevant means to amplify cAMP signals.Other studies have demonstrated that elevation of cAMP by forskolin prostaglandin E2-mimics, and inhibitors of cAMP phosphodiesterases inhibits apoptosis in neutrophils (17Rossi A.G. Cousin J.M. Dransfield I. Lawson M.F. Chilvers E.R. Haslett C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It is possible that elevation of endogenous cAMP levels by agonists such as adrenergic agents, prostaglandins, or other agents in tissues may serve to delay apoptosis and prolong the life of neutrophils in vivo under certain circumstances. Generally, elevation of cAMP levels is transient, and prolonged elevation of cAMP is subject to feedback mechanisms that interrupt cAPK signal in various ways. The studies presented here demonstrate that even in the presence of sustained elevation of cAMP levels using relatively stable cAMP analogues, apoptosis is only delayed and not inhibited as reported by others (17Rossi A.G. Cousin J.M. Dransfield I. Lawson M.F. Chilvers E.R. Haslett C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, for neutrophils, which have relatively short life spans, this delay in apoptosis would be expected to be significant. Activation of type I cAPK is also associated with attenuation of the respiratory burst, 2L. K. Parvathenani, E. S. Buescher, E. Chacon-Cruz, and S. J. Beebe, unpublished data. suggesting that cAPK prolongs the life of neutrophils with some attenuated functions. This may serve to protect the host against neutrophil-mediated inflammation.Apoptosis is a complex cellular process that mediates a transition from life to death in most cell types. The process involves diverse structural and biochemical changes, three of which we used as markers in these studies. Many investigators have used morphologic changes to identify apoptotic cells. For neutrophils in single cell suspension, this marker is definitive and quantitative but is not likely to be an early event in the apoptosis process. In comparison, annexin V-FITC binding identifies membrane asymmetry due to transposition of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer leaflet of the surface membrane (31Vermes I. Haanen C. Nakken H.S. Reutelingsperger C.P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4545) Google Scholar). Development of this asymmetry may be an early marker for apoptosis, which allows selective recognition and clearance of the apoptotic cell from its normal environment. In close agreement with apoptotic morphology, annexin V-FITC binding also clearly defined the cAMP-mediated delay in apoptosis and was a more sensitive marker for apoptosis and the effects of cAPK. Chromatin fragmentation was used as a third, qualitative marker for apoptosis. This fragmentation results from cleavage of chromatin into approximately 200-base pair fragments by a Ca2+-dependent endonuclease (28Zhivotovsky B. Wade D. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1994; 105: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This marker confirmed that the morphologic and annexin V-FITC binding changes observed in cycloheximide-exposed cells were associated with chromatin fragmentation, but because this marker is not quantitative, it was not used to examine cAMP effects or apoptosis induced by either in vitro storage of anti-Fas exposure. Thus, we used two functionally distinct quantitative markers to demonstrate apoptosis and the effects on cAMP on apoptosis and found consistency between them. These studies leave little doubt that cAPK are important regulators for delaying apoptosis in neutrophils.Because apoptosis can result from different stimuli, we used three different models of the process in these studies. The precise mechanisms underlying storage-induced and cycloheximide-induced apoptosis are not known, although stimulation of the S6 kinase and signaling via the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway may be involved in the CHX model (37Blenis J. Chung J. Erikson E. Alcorta D.A. Erikson R.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 279-285PubMed Google Scholar, 38Price D.J. Nemenoff R.A. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13825-13833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, anti-Fas exposure has been and continues to be intensively studied, because apoptosis in this situation results from receptor activation at the cell surface and now has a relatively well defined pathway. Cyclic AMP and type I cAPK delayed apoptosis in each of these diverse models, raising questions about the mechanisms of action and the site(s) of action for cAPK in each model. Previous studies suggested that a delay in apoptosis was accompanied by a transient Ca2+ spike (34Whyte M.K. Hardwick S.J. Meagher L.C. Savill J.S. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In the results presented here, neither the induction of apoptosis by CHX nor the delay of apoptosis by cAMP analogues was associated with changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels.We investigated the possibility that by analyzing the well defined actions of the cAPK pathway and determining the sites for cAPK action in human neutrophils, the regulatory sites in one or more pathways for apoptosis could be identified. Cyclic AMP and cAPK could modulate each of the models used in this study at different sites, some shared and some unique or could act at a single site common to all pathways. Several experimental observations suggest that cAPK acts at different sites in each of the models. Although cAMP inhibition is present in all models, the sensitivity to cAMP differs across models: cAMP prolonged neutrophil survival 3.3-, 2.6-, and 1.4-fold in the cycloheximide exposure, in vitro storage, and anti-Fas exposure models, respectively. If cAPK acted at a common site in each model, it might reasonably be expected that inhibition would be quantitatively similar. However, it is possible that the intensity of the apoptosis signal is different in each model, and despite a common site of action, cAPK is more effective in some models than in others. A second observation against a common point of action for cAPK in all models is that inhibition of disparate processes (annexin V-FITC binding and morphologic apoptosis) resulted from cAMP exposure. The possibility that surface membrane changes and morphologic changes occur as temporally distinct events also suggests that cAPK has multiple sites of action, as might be expected for a multisubstrate kinase (39Walsh D.A. Van Patten S.M. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1227-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it could be argued that each of the markers used here occur as a result of a common event, such as caspase-3 (CPP-32β) activation.Alternatively, it is possible that the same site of cAPK action is common to all models, with the different pathways initiated in each model converging to a common path that involves cAPK. Because cAPK generally acts at rate-limiting steps, it is likely that the site(s) will be an important regulatory locus for control of the process. Studies with the caspase substrates suggest that cAPK acts upstream of caspase-3. It is highly likely that the activation of caspase-3 may be a point of no return in the apoptosis pathway (10Anderson P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Although sites downstream of caspase-3 activation may modulate apoptosis, it is expected that they are less effective than sites upstream of protease activation. Cyclic AMP/cAPK action upstream of a putative committed step for apoptosis is consistent with cAPK action at a rate-dependent or process-dependent point in apoptosis pathways.Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway has been shown to delay apoptosis in a number of cell types (40Perkins G.R. Marshall C.J. Collins M.K. Blood. 1996; 87: 3669-3675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thus used PD98059 to block the activation of MAPKK before the addition of CHX or cAMP and observed the effects of these agents on apoptotic morphology. PD98059 has been shown to readily cross the cell membrane and to be a highly selective inhibitor of MAPKK1 (24Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). PD98059 had no effect on the cAPK-mediated delay in apoptosis in the CHX model. This suggests that MAPKK activation is not involved in this model of apoptosis, or if it is involved, cAPK may be acting at a site(s) downstream of or independent of MAPKK to delay CHX-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggests that cAPK acts at a relatively downstream site but upstream of a critical determinant of apoptosis that may be common to all apoptosis pathways.In summary, our data demonstrate for the first time that through activation of type I cAPK, cAMP delays, but does not prevent, apoptosis in human neutrophils due to in vitro storage, cycloheximide exposure, and anti-Fas exposure. A quantitative and temporal analysis of apoptosis in the presence and absence of cAMP analogues using different models, distinct markers, kinase inhibitors, and caspase substrates suggest that the type I cAPK acts at multiple sites that could be either unique or common to the models used in this study. However, a major site of cAPK action is before caspase activation, which may be a common and committed step in all models of apoptosis (10Anderson P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP and cAPK may represent a potential therapeutic target for prolonging the life span of myeloid cells in vivo and in vitro. Human neutrophils are short-lived cells that play important roles in both host defense and acute inflammation in humans (1Baggiolini M. Boulay F. Badwey J.A. Curnutte J.T.

Recent data suggest that apoptosis, a physiologic mechanism for cell death, regulates both production and survival of neutrophils, representing a basic biological mechanism for this cell type (3Ellis R.

Rev. 1997; 61: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) is understood. Recent evidence indicates that a family of cysteine proteases, the caspases, are critical components of apoptosis cascades, are primary determinants for the orderly disassembly of structural components, and incapacitate repair and homeostatic mechanisms in cells (10Anderson P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Roles for caspase proteases in apoptosis have been analyzed in several cell types but have not been investigated in neutrophils. Intracellular signaling mechanisms typically involve protein kinases as major regulators of cellular processes (11Hunter T.

https://openalex.org/W2042792856,"Porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the major pathogens associated with adult periodontitis, a major chronic inflammatory disease. Potent proteinases elaborated by these bacteria aid directly and indirectly in both the development of the pathophysiology of the disease and in host defense evasion. For these reasons they are considered key virulence factors. To investigate whether possible immune evasion mechanisms involve the dysregulation of the host cytokine network, we examined the ability of P. gingivalis cysteine proteinases, including Arg-specific gingipains HRGP and RGP2 and Lys-specific KGP, to degrade the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). All three gingipains rapidly degraded TNF-α as exhibited by immunoblot analysis. Moreover, all biological activity was significantly reduced over extended incubation periods with the proteinases tested, whereas the host neutrophil proteinases were ineffective. These results indicate that the gingipain proteinases elaborated by P. gingivalis are capable of disrupting the cytokine network at the site of infection through the degradation of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α, suggesting the removal of one of several mediators important to the function of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.

Adult periodontitis occurs as a result of a bacterial infection that, if left untreated, may result in tooth loss (1Shaw J.H. N. Eng. J. Med. 1987; 317: 996-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 2Williams R.C. N. Eng. J. Med. 1990; 322: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). It is commonly characterized as a chronic inflammatory disease, exemplified by inflamed gingival tissues, increased crevicular fluid, and massive polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) 1The abbreviations used are: PMN, polymorphonuclear leukocytes; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; HRGP, adhesion domain containing Arg-gingipain 1; RGP2, Arg-gingipain 2; KGP, Lys-gingipain; HNE, human neutrophil elastase; cat G, cathepsin G; pNA, p-nitroanilide; Suc, succinyl; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; IL, interleukin; Tricine, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine. infiltration of the gingival tissues, all of which contribute to both connective tissue loss and alveolar bone loss (3White D.

Mosby Co., St. Louis, MO1988: 348-375Google Scholar). The development of adult periodontitis is now believed to be a result of the uncontrolled activity of two members of a family of cysteine proteinases synthesized and secreted by the organism Porphyromonas gingivalis, an opportunistic pathogen that colonizes beneath the gum line in infected individuals. The two proteinase types are referred to as Arg-gingipains (HRGP and RGP2) and Lys-gingipain (KGP) because of their specificity for cleavage after arginyl and lysyl residues, respectively. HRGP differs from RGP2 in that the protein contains an additional adhesion domain accounting for its higher molecular mass in comparison to RGP2 (100 and 50 kDa, respectively). Significantly, the enzymatic activity of the gingipains is not susceptible to inhibition by human plasma proteinase inhibitors (5Chen Z. Potempa J. Polanowski A. Wikstrom M. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18896-18901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason one family member (RGP) can rapidly activate proteinases involved in the complement (6Wingrove J.A.

Immun. 1995; 63: 4877-4882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), nearly all of which require cleavage after arginyl-Xresidues, whereas the other (KGP) degrades fibrinogen (13Imamura T. Potempa J. Pike R.N. Moor J.N. Barton M.H. Travis J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4877-4882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, these enzymes can also inactivate many of the host plasma proteinase inhibitors, essentially dysregulating each of the cascade pathways. Because P. gingivalis cannot extensively degrade proteins, it is now believed that this organism receives its amino acid/nitrogen requirements through the fragmentation of host proteins by proteinases produced by PMNs, including those found in crevicular fluid and, more importantly, gingival connective tissues. This apparently occurs through the release and/or activation of chemotactic factors such as C5a (6Wingrove J.A. DiScripio R.G. Hugli T.E. Chen Z. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18902-18907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and IL-8, 2J. Mikolajczyk-Pawlinska, J. Potempa, J. Travis, manuscript in preparation. which cause PMNs to migrate toward the bacterium. However, cleavage of chemotactic receptors from the PMN surface by RGPs and KGP inhibits complete migration and phagocytosis (8Jagels M.A. Travis J. Potempa J. Pike R. Hugli T.E. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1984-1991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the result being the death and disintegration of these cells and the release of their potent proteolytic and oxidative enzymes, including elastase, cathepsin G, and myeloperoxidase. The function of PMNs is primarily associated with the eradication of bacterial infections and involves a complex interaction with cytokines, which are produced by epithelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and lymphocytes. In particular, TNF-α, a proinflammatory cytokine, not only induces the production of chemotactic signals (IL-8), which result in the recruitment of PMNs to infected sites (14Ben-Baruch A.

Although the presence of TNF-α has been demonstrated in both the crevicular fluid and gingival tissues at infected sites of patients with periodontitis through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or in situ hybridization methodology (21Rossomando E.F.

Immunol. 1997; 107: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), these procedures are incapable of measuring functional protein. Thus, the question arises as to whether TNF-α post-secretion is biologically active. Here, we report that members of the gingipain family are capable of degrading TNF-α. Additionally, we identify the cleavage points made by the individual gingipains within the TNF-α molecule. More importantly, these observations correlate with the loss of the TNF-α cytolytic activity. Significantly, host proteinases, human neutrophil elastase (HNE), and cathepsin G (cat G) do not degrade TNF-α and thus do not affect this specific activity. These results suggest that pathogenic bacterium may use proteolysis as a means of dysregulating cytokine activity, ultimately contributing to the evasion of host defenses. The mouse L929 connective tissue cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Sigma). Highly purified TNF-α was a kind gift of Bayer corporation (Berkeley, CA). Three major forms of gingipain, HRGP, RGP1, and KGP, were purified according to the method of Pike et al. (26Pike R. McGraw W. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 406-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cathepsin G and HNE were purified as described previously (27Baugh R.J. Travis J. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against human recombinant TNF-α were obtained from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA), and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was purchased from Pierce. H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone was from Bachem Biosciences (Philadelphia, PA). Nα-benzoyl-dl-Arg-pNA, methoxy-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA, and Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA were from Sigma, whereas carboxybenzoyl-Lys-pNA was purchased from NovaBiochem (La Jolla, CA). The amidolytic activity of the purified gingipains HRGP, RGP2, and KGP was determined with either Nα-benzoyl-dl-Arg-pNA or carboxybenzoyl-Lys-pNA. Samples were preincubated in 200 mmHepes, 5 mm CaCl2, and 10 mmcysteine, pH 7.6, for 5 min, 37 °C and then assayed for amidase activity with 1 mm substrate. The formation of p-nitroanaline was monitored spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. Amidolytic activities of the host enzymes HNE and cat G were measured spectrophotometrically using the substrates methoxy-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA for HNE and Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA for cat G. The activity of TNF-α and fragments of TNF-α was monitored by the method of Mathews and Neale (28Matthews N. Neale M.L. Lymphokines and Interferons: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 221-225Google Scholar). Briefly, L929 cells were grown in 96-well flat bottom plates (Falcon Plastics) at 3 × 105 cells/ml and incubated with a serially diluted test sample of TNF-α or digested reaction mixtures of TNF-α (equivalent to a final concentration of 0.0375 ng/ml active TNF-α) in the presence of 1 μg/ml actinomycin D (final concentration) in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After 20 h the culture medium was removed, the plates were washed, the remaining cells were fixed with 5% formaldehyde, and cell lysis was detected by staining the plates with a 0.2% solution of crystal violet. Stained cells were solubilized with 33% acetic acid. The end point on the microplates was determined spectrophotometrically by a Vmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) set for absorption at 562 nm. Cells exposed to culture medium alone were set at 0% lysis, whereas 100% lysis was equivalent to blank wells. Curves were normalized to zero time point cytolytic activity, expressed as the percentage of control. TNF-α digest samples were subjected to 16% SDS-Tricine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (29Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar), followed by electroblotting to nitrocellulose membranes. The primary antibody, rabbit anti-human recombinant TNF-α serum, was diluted 1:1000 prior to use. The secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, was diluted 1:12,000. Immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminesence (Amersham Corp.). Enzymatic digestion of TNF-α was performed at E:S molar ratios of 1:25 or 1:100. Briefly, reaction mixtures containing 1180 nm TNF-α and either 47.2 or 11.8 nm active enzyme in digest buffer (200 mmHepes, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm cysteine, pH 7.6) were allowed to proceed for indicated times, whereupon enzyme activity was extinguished by the addition of the cysteine proteinase inhibitor FPRck. Each time point was divided such that 1 μl was set aside for biological assays, with the remainder being utilized for immunoblot analysis. Digestion of TNF-α (2 μg) by gingipain HRGP, RGP2, or KGP was performed in digest buffer at 37 °C for 120, 10, or 120 min, respectively, at an E:S molar ratio of 1:100. Peptides from TNF-α were resolved by 16% SDS-Tricine polyacrylamide electrophoresis, electrotransferred to PVDF membrane, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Specific bands were excised and subjected to automated Edman sequence analysis using the Applied Biosystems 494 Protein Sequencer (Foster City, CA). To investigate the potential immunomodulatory activities of cysteine proteinases elaborated from P. gingivalis, we first examined the ability of homogeneous preparations of three gingipains (HRGP, RGP2, and KGP) to degrade TNF-α. Fig.1 illustrates cleavage of TNF-α by gingipains as a function of time, with protein degradation being monitored by immunoblot analysis, utilizing a polyclonal antibody raised against human recombinant TNF-α. When reaction digests at an E:S molar ratio of 1:25 were incubated at 37 °C for up to 8 h, we observed that all three gingipains were capable of degrading TNF-α. More specifically, RGP2 was capable of significantly reducing the level of the 17-kDa TNF-α band within 10 min, whereas both gingipain HRGP and KGP required additional time, with complete degradation by 240 min. As a comparison study, similar experiments were performed using homogeneous preparations of the host neutrophil serine proteinases HNE and cat G. Significantly, no detectable degradation of TNF-α was observed with either enzyme as determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2).Figure 2Lack of effect of host serine proteases cat G (A) and human neutrophil elastase (B) on TNF-α. Details are as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test whether the proteolytic degradation of TNF-α correlated with decreased biological activity of the cytokine, digest reactions were also monitored for residual biological activity in a TNF-α-specific cytolytic assay. Using aliquots from the digest mixtures above, samples were diluted to within the working range (0.080 pg/ml) of the assay (Fig. 3). Gingipain RGP2 reduced TNF-α activity by 75% within 10 min (Fig. 3 B), whereas both HRGP and KGP (Fig. 3, A and C, respectively) were significantly more sluggish, requiring 4 h to eliminate all TNF-α activity. When parallel activity studies were performed using the host proteinases HNE and cat G, no significant loss in cytolytic activity was detected (data not shown), again correlating with the immunoblot result. Degradation and inactivation by gingipains was also confirmed in parallel experiments using decreased molar ratios of enzyme to substrate (1:100), albeit at a slower rate. We next investigated the sites of proteolytic cleavage within the TNF-α molecule by the individual gingipains. The specific digestion conditions for each proteinase were optimized so as to get several cleavage products after separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrotransfer to PVDF membrane, and Coomassie Blue staining. Both HRGP and RGP2 were found to cleave TNF-α after Arg2 and Arg6 (Fig.4). A third point of cleavage, determined only for RGP2, occurred at residue Arg32. Points of cleavage by KGP were at Lys63, Lys90, and Lys98. Periodontopathic bacterial infection activates the host inflammatory response, leading to the rapid infiltration of PMNs along with an increased flow of crevicular fluid. Significantly, substances from the bacteria initiate and drive the response through the up-regulation of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, e.g. IL-8, that are synthesized and released from resident fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells, in addition to leukocytes and lymphocytes. These mediators play a major role in amplification and perpetuation of inflammation, as well as in the destruction of host gingival tissues (30Page R.C. J. Periodont. Res. 1991; 26: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The gingipains, RGPs and KGP, are believed to be key virulence factors elaborated from P. gingivalis, the Gram-negative bacterium most often associated with adult periodontitis (31Grenier D.

Such activities, together with an ability to inactivate host plasma proteinase inhibitors, can clearly lead to a dysregulation of the inflammatory response. The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α is synthesized by cells in response to inflammatory mediators. In addition, it may induce the production of other cytokines, including IL-1 and IL-8 (14Ben-Baruch A. Michiel D.F. Oppenheim J.J. J. Biol.

Although up-regulated levels of TNF-α at infected periodontal sites, as compared with healthy gingival tissue, have been demonstrated through both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and in situhybridization studies (21Rossomando E.F.

In the present study we analyzed the ability of three individual gingipains, HRGP, RGP2, and KGP, to digest TNF-α. We chose a pH value of 7.6 for these experiments, primarily because the pH of the gingival crevicular fluid at inflamed sites has been shown to be more alkaline (pH 7.4–8.5) than that of clinically healthy sites (pH 6.7–7.2) (33Kleinberg I. Jenkins G.N. Arch. Oral Biol. 1964; 9: 493-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 34Kleinberg I. Hall G. J. Periodont.

Significantly, both RGPs reduced the level of the 17-kDa TNF-α band within 10 min, at an E:S ratio of 1:25. In contrast, KGP needed nearly 4 h for complete digestion of the TNF-α band. During our studies on gingipain inactivation of TNF-α, we identified the points of cleavage associated with each enzyme. Previous studies, reviewed in Goh and Porter (37Goh C.R. Porter A.G. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), demonstrated that the first nine residues of the TNF-α N terminus are not necessary for biological activity, although a 3.7-fold increase in activity was observed upon deletion of the first seven residues of the N terminus. Both HRGP and RGP2 initially cleaved after residues Arg2 and Arg6. RGP2 additionally caused fragmentation at Arg32, a residue important for biological activity because a conserved substitution at this position results in a loss of activity (37Goh C.R. Porter A.G. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although cleavage at Arg32 by HRGP was not confirmed by this method, the fragmentation pattern was similar to that of RGP2. For KGP, cleavage occurred after residues Lys63, Lys98, and Lys90. Taken together these results demonstrate that the gingipain cysteine proteinases are capable of not only trimming the N terminus of TNF-α but also of cleaving the polypeptide at several internal residues buried within the molecule, thus rendering the proinflammatory cytokine inactive. It is significant that in these studies protein degradation correlated with the loss of TNF-α cytolytic activity (Fig. 3), which was significantly reduced within 10 min upon treatment with gingipain RGP2. Additional incubation did not reduce activity further. As expected from the protein fragmentation pattern, cytolytic inactivation by either HRGP or KGP occurred at a slower rate but was still complete within 4 h. Despite the apparent disappearance of the 17-kDa substrate within the first 60 min of digestion with KGP (Fig. 1 C), these samples possessed essentially 100% biological activity (Fig.3 C), suggesting an artificially low representation of substrate and/or limitation of immunodetection method. Nevertheless, these results, taken in total, indicate that TNF-α is rapidly degraded and inactivated by the gingipains tested, albeit most rapidly by RGP2. In addition to non-host proteinases we also investigated the ability of the host PMN proteinases HNE and cat G to degrade TNF-α, because these enzymes are also likely to be present at inflammatory sites. Significantly, they were ineffectual in both degradation (Fig. 2) and inactivation, suggesting that TNF-α is resistant to proteolytic digestion by PMN-derived enzymes. We are continuing these studies to determine whether TNF-α and/or other cytokines are also refractory to proteinases secreted by host cells, in general, and more specifically to those classified as metalloproteinases because the latter are secreted by numerous cell types that would be present at inflammatory sites. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the bacterial cysteine proteinases elaborated by P. gingivalis are capable of digesting TNF-α, an important inflammatory mediator. This strongly suggests a local dysregulation of the cytokine network and, ultimately, interruption of the host defense response, including the dysfunction of PMNs. Moreover, this study supports the belief that proteolysis can be used as a mechanism of virulence by pathogenic organisms, ultimately leading to host immune evasion."
https://openalex.org/W2093007308,"Genetic selection was exploited in combination with structure-based design to transform an intimately entwined, dimeric chorismate mutase into a monomeric, four-helix–bundle protein with near native activity. Successful reengineering depended on choosing a thermostable starting protein, introducing point mutations that preferentially destabilize the wild-type dimer, and using directed evolution to optimize an inserted interhelical turn. Contrary to expectations based on studies of other four-helix–bundle proteins, only a small fraction of possible turn sequences (fewer than 0.05 percent) yielded well-behaved, monomeric, and highly active enzymes. Selection for catalytic function thus provides an efficient yet stringent method for rapidly assessing correctly folded polypeptides and may prove generally useful for protein design."
https://openalex.org/W1992982359,"A highly specific Diels-Alder protein catalyst was made by manipulating the antibody repertoire of the immune system. The catalytic antibody 13G5 catalyzes a disfavored exo Diels-Alder transformation in a reaction for which there is no natural enzyme counterpart and that yields a single regioisomer in high enantiomeric excess. The crystal structure of the antibody Fab in complex with a ferrocenyl inhibitor containing the essential haptenic core that elicited 13G5 was determined at 1.95 angstrom resolution. Three key antibody residues appear to be responsible for the observed catalysis and product control. Tyrosine-L36 acts as a Lewis acid activating the dienophile for nucleophilic attack, and asparagine-L91 and aspartic acid-H50 form hydrogen bonds to the carboxylate side chain that substitutes for the carbamate diene substrate. This hydrogen-bonding scheme leads to rate acceleration and also pronounced stereoselectivity. Docking experiments with the four possible ortho transition states of the reaction explain the specific exo effect and suggest that the (3R,4R)-exo stereoisomer is the preferred product."

Partial deletions of the CTD alter the regulatory properties of distinct promoters in different ways. The CTD has been shown to interact with a multisubunit complex containing the TATA-binding protein, which is an integral part of the transcription initiation complex (6Thompson C.M. Koleske A.J. Chao D.M. Young R.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1361-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The CTD motif is mainly composed of phosphorylatable amino acid residues, and the RNA polymerase II CTD is actually highly phosphorylated in vivo, mostly at serine and to a lesser extent at threonine and tyrosine (7Buhler J.M.

The in vivo phosphorylation sites are not known, but this issue has been approached indirectly by comparing the ratio of phosphorylated serine and threonine. The predominance of serine phosphorylation in vivo (with a serine/threonine ratio of ∼10:1) has been explained by phosphorylation at positions 2 and 5: the serine at position 2 is replaced by a threonine in one-fifth of the repeats, and position 5 has only one threonine out of 51 (9Zhang J. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2290-2296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

The kinase-cyclin pair MO15-cyclin H (KIN28-CCL1) is already known as a cyclin-dependent kinase (CAK (Cdc2-activating kinase)) in vitro (28Valay J.G. Simon M. Faye G. J. Mol.

Other protein kinases have also been described as able to phosphorylate the CTD. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is composed of a catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and a regulatory component corresponding to the Ku autoimmune antigen (30Dvir A. Peterson S.R. Knuth M.W. Lu H.

It acts as a CTD kinase when stimulated by linear double-stranded DNA and by several transcriptional activators (30Dvir A. Peterson S.R. Knuth M.W. Lu H. Dynan W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, DNA-PK has also been shown to phosphorylate the RNA polymerase I transcriptional apparatus and to inhibit RNA polymerase I transcription. Moreover, this protein kinase plays a major role in DNA repair processes and recombination of immunoglobulin gene locus in the cells of the immune system (33Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 412-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). MAP kinases are induced by mitogenic stimuli and by heat shock. They are able to phosphorylate the CTD among their many known in vitro substrates (34Dubois M.-F. Nguyen V.-T. Dahmus M.E. Pagès G. Pouyssegur J. Bensaude O. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4787-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to determine the sites phosphorylated in vitro in the CTD by TFIIH kinase, DNA-PK, and MAP kinases. Comparison of the results obtained in vitro with what is known about CTD phosphorylation in vivo gives some clues to the nature of the protein kinases involved in the in vivo phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase CTD. To determine which of the three serines is phosphorylated by the different CTD kinases, we synthesized a set of peptides containing one or two CTD motifs in which each serine was successively replaced by an alanine. We devised new electrophoretic conditions to be able to separate the phosphorylated peptides. Similar experiments were performed with another set of peptides to determine the influence of amino acids surrounding the phosphorylated site and to compare the specificity of the different CTD kinases. Using a similar method, we were recently able to distinguish the different CTD kinase activities that are induced by stress and heat-shock treatment (35Trigon S. Morange M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13091-13098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (24 μl) contained (final concentrations) 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, 7.5 mmMgCl2, 7.5 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, [γ32-P]ATP (0.2 mm, 1 μCi), 50 mm NaF, 1 mm orthovanadate, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and the following peptides: hepta-3 (SPTSPSY)3; 0.4 mg/ml), hepta-2 ((SPTSPSY)2) or modified hepta-2 (0.4 mg/ml), or hepta-1 (SPTSPSY) or modified hepta-1 (1.6 mg/ml) (unless otherwise mentioned in the figure legends). Phosphorylation reactions were performed with 4 μl of human ERK1 (agarose-conjugated ERK1; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 90 min at 30 °C, with 0.4 units/ml murine recombinant ERK2 (from Prof. P. Cohen, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom) for 30 min at 30 °C, with ∼40 ng of TFIIH kinase (TSK SP-5-PW fraction (36Conaway J.W. Bradsher J.N. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10142-10148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) for 2.5 h at 30 °C in the presence of 1.6 mg/ml polyvinyl alcohol and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, or with 2 μl of DNA-PK (from Dr. G. Smith, Wellcome/Cancer Research Campaign Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom) in the presence of 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 30 min at 30 °C. The times used for in vitro reactions were chosen to be in initial rate conditions. Peptides were synthesized by Dr. O. Siffert (Organic Chemistry Laboratory, Institut Pasteur). Reactions were stopped by adding 1 volume of Laemmli sample buffer (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Reaction samples were analyzed by 22% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed according to Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). Hepta-1 peptides were too small to be separated from the radiolabeled ATP front by the usual electrophoretic conditions. We acidified the buffer by replacing the Tris/glycine buffer with a phosphate buffer (38Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as we previously described (35Trigon S. Morange M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13091-13098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Reaction samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% denaturing phosphate buffer gels at pH 6.0. Gels were fixed in ethanol/acetic acid/trichloroacetic acid/water (3:1:1:5, v/v), dried, and submitted to autoradiography with an intensifying screen at 4 °C. Signals were quantified with a Fuji BAS reader, and measurements made with PC BAS. The SPTTPSY peptide was phosphorylated by TFIIH kinase and analyzed as described above. The radiolabeled spot was cut out of the gel and washed rapidly in 500 μl of water. The phosphorylated peptide was eluted in 0.5 m ammonium acetate at 37 °C with gentle agitation overnight. Peptide hydrolysis and phosphoamino acid analysis were performed as described previously (39Legagneux V. Morange M. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Serizawa et al. (40Serizawa H. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17300-17308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) previously showed that TFIIH kinase phosphorylates the RNA polymerase II CTD at serine residues. To determine which of the three serines was phosphorylated by TFIIH kinase, we assayed a set of peptides in which serines were replaced by alanines. Fig.1 A shows that phosphorylation was completely lost when serine 5 was replaced by an alanine, whereas the two other serine substitutions had no effect on phosphorylation. Thus, only serine 5 of the CTD motif appears to be phosphorylated by TFIIH kinase. These results are in agreement with those reported by Roy et al. (25Roy R. Adamczewski J.P. Seroz T. Vermeulen W. Tassan J.P. Schaeffer L. Nigg E.A. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1093-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Identical results were obtained with ERK1 (Fig.1 B) and ERK2 (data not shown). Within the entire CTD, all the repeats are contiguous, and all (but one) serines at positions 2 and 7 are close to the extremity of another repeat. Therefore, the absence of phosphorylation of these serines by TFIIH kinase (or MAP kinases) might be due to the absence of the amino acids surrounding these residues in the CTD. To rule out this possibility, we performed experiments with similar alanine replacements in hepta-2 peptides (Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7-Tyr8-Ser9-Pro10-Thr11-Ser12-Pro13-Ser14-Tyr1) (Fig. 2). These peptides were electrophoresed on a 22% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Phosphorylation of the hepta-2 peptide by ERK1 or ERK2 revealed two separated bands with similar intensities. Phosphorylation efficiency was very low, and the peptide concentration that we used did not allow the characterization of multiple phosphorylations. The two bands correspond to phosphorylation in the left or right part of the peptide. Indeed, when serine 5 of the right part was replaced by an alanine, the upper band disappeared, and when the same substitution was made in the left side, there was no longer a lower band. Replacement of serine 9 had no effect on the phosphorylation. Therefore, as for hepta-1 peptides, only serine 5 of the CTD motif is phosphorylated in hepta-2 peptides by ERK1 and ERK2. As far as TFIIH kinase is concerned, the two bands were also observed, and we obtained qualitatively the same effect for the substitutions (Fig. 2), although the relative intensities were different from those obtained by MAP kinase phosphorylation. The intensity of the upper band, which corresponds to phosphorylation of the serine present in the central position of the left motif, was very low compared with the other. This difference was still evident with substituted peptides. The two sites are not equivalent, suggesting that TFIIH kinase recognizes sequence or conformational information in the right side of the phosphorylated site. Fig. 3 shows the result of a comparison of the efficiency of the different protein kinases to use one, two, or three repeats of the CTD motif. To be able to compare the phosphorylation of the three different peptides in a single experiment, we used the electrophoretic conditions normally used for the hepta-1 peptides. Under these conditions, only one spot is obtained for the hepta-2 peptide. For this experiment, the same peptide concentration was used for all the peptides. ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylated the hepta-3 and hepta-2 peptides 3- and 2-fold better than the hepta-1 peptide, respectively, whereas TFIIH kinase phosphorylated the hepta-2 and hepta-3 peptides 13- and 20-fold better than the hepta-1 peptide, respectively. The hepta-3/hepta-2 ratio was therefore identical for the three kinases. This indicates that two repeats increase the phosphorylation efficiency of TFIIH kinase. Another set of hepta-1 peptides was used to determine the involvement of each amino acid in the recognition by TFIIH and MAP kinases. At first glance, the comparison shows that the specificity of these different kinases is very similar. The hepta-1 peptide without any substitution was considered as the reference (Fig.4 A). C-terminal proline replacement by an alanine (SPTSASY) led to the abolition of peptide phosphorylation, a feature of the proline-dependent protein kinase family. Likewise, no significant peptide phosphorylation was observed when the N-terminal proline was displaced or removed (PSTSPSY, STSPSY, and STPSPSY). In conclusion, the two prolines of the motif are absolutely essential for TFIIH and MAP kinases. Phosphorylation was decreased by half when the tyrosine was replaced by an alanine. Thus, the tyrosine is important, but not essential. Replacement of the threonine at position 4 by a leucine or an arginine significantly increased the phosphorylation of the peptide, whereas glutamic acid had an opposite effect. Confirming the positive effect of a leucine at position 4, the N-terminal proline became nonessential when threonine 4 was replaced by a leucine (SALSPSY) (see “Discussion”). Previous studies showed that serine is a better phosphate acceptor than threonine for ERK1 and ERK2 (41Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22159-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 A(upper panel) shows that threonine at position 5 is an even poorer phosphate acceptor for TFIIH kinase than for MAP kinases, revealing a significant difference between TFIIH and MAP kinases. The weak intensity of TFIIH kinase phosphorylation suggests another hypothesis. Due to the substitution of serine 5, serines 2 and/or 7 might become minor phosphate acceptors. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the phosphorylated peptide revealed only the presence of phosphothreonines, showing that serines 2 and 7 cannot be phosphorylated by TFIIH kinase and that limited phosphorylation of the SPTTPSY peptide is due to phosphorylation of threonine at position 5. The same set of peptides used for TFIIH and MAP kinases was assayed to characterize the sites phosphorylated by DNA-PK in the CTD motif (Fig. 1 C). None of the substitutions completely abolished the peptide phosphorylation. This suggested that more than one serine is phosphorylated by DNA-PK. However, serine 2 (APTSPSY) or serine 7 (SPTSPAY) replacement decreased peptide phosphorylation significantly. On the other hand, when serine 5 (SPTAPSY) was substituted, DNA-PK was even more efficient than with hepta-1. Another peptide was synthesized to determine the effect of the simultaneous substitution of serines 2 and 7 (peptide A2A7, APTSPAY). The introduction of these changes severely depressed phosphorylation by DNA-PK. We observed a residual phosphorylation after a long exposure that migrated like peptide A2A7 phosphorylated by ERK1, as if in the absence of its highest affinity sites, DNA-PK is able to weakly phosphorylate the serine located at position 5 (data not shown). In contrast, even after a long exposure, we never observed any phosphorylation of peptide A5 with the MAP kinases. Since the sites phosphorylated by DNA-PK were different from those phosphorylated by TFIIH and MAP kinases, two other modified hepta-2 peptides were synthesized. Four bands were observed by phosphorylating the hepta-2 peptide (Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7-Tyr8-Ser9-Pro10-Thr11-Ser12-Pro13-Ser14-Tyr1) with DNA-PK (Fig. 5). They may correspond to phosphorylation of serines 2, 7, 9, and 14, the four potential phosphorylation sites contained in the hepta-2 peptide. When serine at position 9 was replaced by an alanine (peptide A9), one of the bands disappeared, and when two serines were replaced (peptide A7A14), only two bands remained. These results support the hypothesis that each of the four bands corresponds to a dipeptide phosphorylated at only one site and that positions 2, 7, 9, and 14 are actually phosphorylated by DNA-PK. Peptides identical to those used Fig. 4 were assayed with DNA-PK. A striking observation is that no substitution led to a complete loss of phosphorylation (Fig.6). In half of the cases, the peptides were phosphorylated at least as well as the hepta-1 peptide. The replacement of the C-terminal proline (peptide A6) did not affect peptide phosphorylation. The same was true for the N-terminal proline with an increase in phosphorylation for peptide P4 (sequence STPSPSY); therefore, DNA-PK is not a proline-dependent protein kinase. Tyrosine replacement produced a decrease in phosphorylation; thus, this amino acid is important, but not essential. The peptide that contains arginine, a basic amino acid, at position 4 (SPRSPSY) was not a good substrate for DNA-PK. The two radiolabeled spots corresponding to this peptide that were separated on polyacrylamide gels may correspond to phosphorylation of either serine 2 or serine 7 (the amount of phosphorylated peptide reported on the histogram is the addition of the two values); the same is probably true for the other peptides, but they are not separated on the gel. In contrast, an acidic residue at position 4 (SPESPSY) led to very efficient peptide phosphorylation (Fig. 6, lower panel). No decrease in phosphorylation was observed when threonine 4 was substituted by a leucine, which is a neutral amino acid without a phosphate acceptor group, showing that this threonine is probably not phosphorylated by DNA-PK. Substitution of serine 5 by a threonine (SPTTPSY) decreased peptide phosphorylation. This result is surprising because this serine is not supposed to be phosphorylated by DNA-PK. Changes in charges or in the steric environment may explain the indirect effects on phosphorylation of serines 2 and 7. Despite all the studies on the CTD and its phosphorylation, the role of this domain of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II is still unclear. A model frequently evoked for RNA polymerase II transcription initiation is the recruitment of a hypophosphorylated RNA polymerase II to the preinitiation complex and phosphorylation during the transition from initiation to elongation (11Laybourn P.J. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6693-6698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Payne J.M. Laybourn P.J. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol.

Possible pausing at an early phase of transcription, dependent on proximal activating sequences (42Krumm A. Hickey L.B. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), might necessitate another phosphorylation for the release of RNA polymerase. Therefore, a first phosphorylation might be necessary for initiation and a second for relief of pausing. These two phosphorylations might be carried out by different Ser/Thr or Tyr protein kinases. By using immunofluorescence microscopy, Weeks et al. (43Weeks J.R. Hardin S.E. Shen J. Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2329-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) showed on polytene chromosomes that some specific genes are transcribed by hyperphosphorylated polymerases, whereas hsp70 mRNAs are elongated by a mixture of hypo- and hyperphosphorylated forms. Similar results were obtained by in vivo protein-DNA cross-linking assays (44O'Brien T. Hardin S. Greenleaf A. Lis J.T. Nature. 1994; 370: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The CTD phosphorylation state during transcription elongation may thus be different for the different types of gene. Experiments in yeast suggest the involvement of several protein kinases in CTD phosphorylation in vivo. Lee et al. (45Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 149-167PubMed Google Scholar) have characterized the CTK1 gene encoding a yeast nuclear CTD kinase, which presents some homologies to cdc2/CDC28. CTK1 gene disruption decreases in vivo phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II without abolishing it (45Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 149-167PubMed Google Scholar). The different sensitivity of CTD phosphorylation to protein kinase inhibitors suggests that it is the same in higher eukaryotes: CTD phosphorylation in quiescent cells is decreased by the protein kinase inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, whereas it is unaffected in serum-treated cells or heat-shocked cells (34Dubois M.-F. Nguyen V.-T. Dahmus M.E. Pagès G. Pouyssegur J. Bensaude O. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4787-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 46Dubois M.-F. Nguyen V.-T. Bellier S. Bensaude O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13331-13336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The number of protein kinases able to phosphorylate the CTD in vitro is still growing. A CTD kinase has been located in the yeast holoenzyme. This kinase is encoded by a new gene called SRB10, regulated by the cyclin SRB11 (47Liao S.M. Zhang J.H. Jeffrey D.A. Koleske A.J. Thompson C.M. Chao D.M. Viljoen M. Vanvuuren H.J.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Recently, another CTD kinase has been identified as a component of the positive transcription elongation factor of Drosophila. It has been suggested that this protein kinase could phosphorylate the CTD to release the RNA polymerase II from an abortive elongation state (48Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). In addition, McCracken et al. (69McCracken S. Fong N. Yankulov K. Ballantyne S. Pan G. Greenblatt J. Patterson S.D. Wickens M. Bentley D.L. Nature. 1996; 385: 357-361Crossref Scopus (740) Google Scholar) showed recently that the CTD is required for efficient RNA processing. CTD phosphorylation might also be implicated in mRNA splicing. All these observations suggest that depending on the signal that induces specific gene transcription, the step in the transcription cycle or mRNA splicing, different enzymes might be involved in CTD phosphorylation. These protein kinases may have different site specificities in the CTD motif. Little is known about the exact phosphorylation state of RN"

This gene is exclusively and constitutively expressed in endothelial cells. Previous data with transgenic mice revealed that the transcriptional regulatory elements present within a −2486/+24 DNA fragment of mouse VE cadherin gene mimic the tissue-specific activity of the endogenous promoter. In this study, we analyzed elements implicated in the function of the proximal regulatory region. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay identified a GT-rich sequence (positions −49/−39) interacting with factors related to the Sp1 family. Point mutations abolished the binding of nuclear proteins in vitro and drastically diminished the activity of the promoter in transient transfection assay. Supershift assays with antibodies against proteins of the Sp1 family revealed that Sp1 and Sp3 interact with this region of the VE cadherin promoter. Furthermore, two GGAA motifs, located at positions −93/−90 and −109/−106, were shown to interact with nuclear factors. Site-directed mutagenesis of these sequences demonstrated that these Ets binding sites are essential for promoter activity.

CD 144) is a member of the calcium-dependent cell adhesive protein family that is involved in the formation and maintenance of cell-cell contacts (1Lampugnani M.-G. Resnati M. Raiteri M. Pigott R.

Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2929) Google Scholar). Cadherins promote a homophilic type of binding through their extracellular domains. The cadherin cytoplasmic region interacts with proteins called catenins (α-catenin, β-catenin, plakoglobin, and p120), which mediate the linkage of the cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton (4Cowin P. Burke B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). VE cadherin is strictly specific to endothelial cells and is located at intercellular junctions (1Lampugnani M.-G. Resnati M. Raiteri M. Pigott R. Pisacane A. Houen G. Ruco L.P. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1511-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 5Breier G. Breviario F. Caveda L. Berthier R. Schnürch H. Gotsch U. Vestweber D. Risau W. Dejana E. Blood. 1996; 87: 630-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In embryonic stem cell-derived embryoid bodies, VE cadherin null mutation inhibited the assembly of vascular-like structures, thus indicating a crucial role for this protein in vascular morphogenesis (6Vittet D. Buchou T. Schweitzer A. Dejana E. Huber P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6273-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In mouse embryos, VE cadherin transcripts were detected at the time of endothelial cell differentiation from mesodermal derivatives (embryonic day 7.5) (5Breier G. Breviario F. Caveda L. Berthier R. Schnürch H. Gotsch U. Vestweber D. Risau W. Dejana E. Blood. 1996; 87: 630-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VE cadherin expression was detected in the developing vascular tree and in all vessel types in the adult, although a down-regulation of VE cadherin transcription level has been observed in brain capillaries (5Breier G. Breviario F. Caveda L. Berthier R. Schnürch H. Gotsch U. Vestweber D. Risau W. Dejana E. Blood. 1996; 87: 630-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The constitutive and exclusive expression of VE cadherin in endothelial cells is a unique feature among the proteins known to be expressed in this cell type. Despite much effort to determine the transcription factors interacting with endothelial promoters, the mechanisms that direct gene expression in the endothelium are still poorly understood. Accordingly, we decided to undertake a functional dissection of the VE cadherin promoter. VE cadherin locus (Cdh5) has been localized in the middle of mouse chromosome 8, in a region where other cadherin loci have been mapped (7Huber P. Dalmon J. Engiles J. Breviario F. Gory S. Siracusa L.D. Buchberg A.M. Dejana E. Genomics. 1996; 32: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The gene contains 12 exons spanning more than 36 kilobase pairs, and the first exon, which is entirely untranslated, starts at one transcriptional site. In another report, 2S. Gory, M. Vernet, M. Laurent, E. Dejana, J. Dalmon, and P. Huber, submitted for publication. we show that a DNA fragment containing nucleotides −2486 to +24 was sufficient to confer endothelial specific expression of a reporter gene in transgenic mice, indicating that most if not all the sequences regulating VE cadherin gene expression are present in this fragment. Furthermore, in cultured cells, a 5′-deletion strategy, used to map the functional domains located within the −2486/+24 sequence, indicated that the following three well defined regulatory regions were involved: a proximal −139/+24 region, which contains a ubiquitous promoter, and two fragments, −289/−140 and −2226/−1191, silencing the transcriptional activity of the proximal promoter in non-endothelial cells. These findings suggest that the combination of these three domains may form the basis for the tissue-specific expression of VE cadherin gene. In this report, we investigated the role of proximal cis-acting elements of VE cadherin promoter as well as the transcription factors that interact with these sequences. By means of gel shift assay and transient transfection of mutated forms of the −139/+24 fragment, we determined three motifs required for full promoter activity. These elements represent the positive cis-acting partners of VE cadherin gene transcriptional mechanisms. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Ohlson and Edlund (8Ohlson H. Edlund T. Cell. 1986; 45: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) with the exception that cells were treated 5 min with 0.4% Nonidet P-40 instead of Dounce homogenization. The oligonucleotides were obtained from Genome Express (Grenoble, France). For EMSA, 0.5–0.9 ng of 32P-labeled double strand oligonucleotide (2 × 104 cpm) was mixed with 20 μg of nuclear extracts in a final volume of 10 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The specific competitors and antisera, described in individual experiments, were added to the reaction mixture before the addition of the end-labeled probe and incubated 20 min at 20 °C. Finally, samples were incubated for 20 min at 20 °C and analyzed on 4% polyacrylamide, 2.5% glycerol gels that were run in 0.5× TBE buffer (1× TBE buffer = 0.089 m Tris-HCl, 0.089m boric acid, 0.002 m EDTA) at 150 V and then dried, prior to autoradiography in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).

All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (15% for BAEC) fetal calf serum (Seromed), 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml (Life Technologies, Inc.). The mutated −139CAT constructs were produced by site-directed mutagenesis as described by Mikaelian and Sergeant (10Mikaelian I. Sergeant A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 376Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Briefly, two simultaneous PCR reactions, using −139CAT2 as matrix, were performed. The first one used two primers homologous to the pBLCAT3 vector (11Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) in which the −139/+24 promoter fragment was inserted, 5′-AAGTTGGGTAACGCCAGGGT-3′ from position 321 (11Luckow B.

The second one used the mutated primer described in Fig. 2 (mutation M2) or in Fig. 4 C (mutations EBS2M, EBS4M, and EBS234M24), and a more external primer in the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, 5′-GGCATTTCAGTCAGTTGCTC-3′ from position 556 in pBLCAT3. Amplified fragments from each PCR reaction were purified, mixed, and subjected to a second round of PCR using the two most external primers (341 and 556). The amplified fragment was inserted into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. The −139/+24 fragment was liberated by digestion with PstI and XhoI endonucleases (see Fig. 1) and inserted into the PstI and XhoI sites of pBLCAT3.Figure 4EMSA of eEND nuclear proteins binding to the EBS2 or EBS4 sites.

Each transfection was performed with 10 μg of appropriate CAT construct and 5 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3-control, Promega) to correct variability in transfection efficiency. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase activity was determined on an aliquot with the luciferase assay system (Promega) on a luminometer (Pharmacia).

Moreover, the −139/+24 fragment promoted a high level of reporter gene expression in both bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) and the mouse fibroblastic cell line, NIH-3T3 (Fig. 3).2 This activity was comparable to that of the herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter in both cell types. To determine which elements within this fragment could support this activity, we searched for putative transcription factor binding sites. This analysis revealed six potential cis-acting elements as follows: a GT box between positions −49 and −39, which represents a recognition motif for Sp1 family members (20Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), although more classical Sp1 binding sites generally consist of GC boxes (21Gidoni D. Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Nature. 1984; 312: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar); and five consensus sites, GGAA or GGAT, for the Ets family of oncoproteins (22Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), localized at positions −72/−69, −93/−90, −102/−99, −109/−106, and −121/−118 and denoted EBS1 to EBS5, respectively. To determine whether the GT box could bind transcription factors, we analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) the interaction of a VE cadherin promoter oligonucleotide containing this motif, with nuclear proteins present in the murine endothelioma cell line eEND (23Williams R.L. Risau W. Zerwes H.-G. Drexler H. Aguzzi A. Wagner E.F. Cell. 1989; 57: 1053-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), which expresses high level of VE cadherin. Results showed that the DNA probe (Fig. 2 B, WT) formed four complexes, designated I to IV, that were competed by excess amounts of unlabeled wild type oligonucleotide (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3). Complexes I–IV were competed by unlabeled oligonucleotides containing mutations outside of the GT box (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 7); however, two oligonucleotides carrying mutations within the Sp1 site failed to prevent DNA-protein interactions (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 5), indicating that all four complexes involved the GT box. Moreover, complexes I–IV were competed by a consensus Sp1 binding site (GC box) but not by an irrelevant oligonucleotide (Fig. 2, lanes 8 and 9), further suggesting the identity of binding factors as Sp1-like proteins. Identical patterns were observed with nuclear extracts from various cell types, including BAEC and NIH-3T3 (data not shown), suggesting that these transcription factors are ubiquitous. EMSA in the presence of monospecific antibodies to different members of the Sp1 family revealed that complex I was formed by Sp1 and complexes II and III by Sp3, as indicated by the decrease of the respective signal intensity and the apparition of supershifted complexes (Fig. 2, lanes 11 and 12). Complex IV was not affected by the presence of these antibodies or by antibodies against Sp2 (data not shown) or Sp4 (Fig. 2, lane 13). The identity of proteins present in complex IV remains to be determined. We investigated the functional importance of the Sp1/Sp3 site by mutational analysis. Mutant M2 (Fig. 2 B), which could not support the formation of complexes with nuclear extracts in gel shift assay (data not shown), was introduced in the −139CAT construct containing the −139/+24 VE cadherin promoter fragment driving the expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Transient transfection analysis of BAEC and NIH-3T3 cells showed that this mutation caused approximately 80% reduction in reporter activity in both cell types (Fig. 3), indicating that the GT motif is a major determinant in promoter activity. The potential interaction of the five consensus Ets binding sites with endothelial nuclear proteins was evaluated by EMSA. EBS1, EBS3, and EBS5 did not form any specific complex, indicating an absence of binding with nuclear proteins (data not shown), whereas DNA-protein interactions were observed with EBS2 and EBS4 (Fig.4). With the EBS2 probe (Fig.4 A), a specific complex was formed and could be competed by unlabeled wild type EBS2 oligonucleotide (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and 3) as well as oligonucleotides containing EBS4, EBS234 (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5 and 8), and two functional Ets binding sites derived from other promoters (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5 and 10). Conversely, oligonucleotides bearing a mutated EBS2, EBS1, EBS5, or an irrelevant sequence (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4, 6, 7, and 11) were unable to compete with EBS2 for nuclear factor binding. Similar results were obtained with EBS4 (Fig.4 B), except that two specific complexes were observed, the slower migrating one (complex a) yielding a much stronger signal than the faster migrating band (complex b). These data establish the capacity of EBS2 and EBS4 to interact with Ets-related proteins. Cross-competition of EBS2 and EBS4 for complex formation (Fig. 4) as well as co-migration of complex a, generated by EBS4, with that obtained with EBS2 (Fig. 5), suggest that these complexes are formed by the same protein(s). EMSA, conducted with EBS2 or EBS4 and nuclear extracts from cells of endothelial (BAEC), fibroblastic (NIH-3T3), erythro-megakaryocytic (HEL), epithelial (HeLa), or hepatocytic (HepG2) origin, formed complexes co-migrating with those obtained with eEND extracts (Fig. 5). Of note, a weaker DNA binding activity was consistently observed with HeLa extracts. These data strongly suggest that the nuclear factors involved are not cell-specific. To characterize the contribution of these elements to the promoter activity, we mutated EBS2 and EBS4 individually or in combination within the −139CAT construct. The mutations were known to disrupt any binding activity (Fig. 4 B). When transfected in BAEC, mutations of EBS2 or EBS4 resulted in a 78% or an 88% decrease, respectively, in activity compared with the wild type construct; mutation of both sites reduced transcription to background level (Fig.6). In NIH-3T3, mutations of EBS2, EBS4, or both provoked a 60–70% decrease in promoter activity (Fig. 6). These data clearly demonstrate that both elements are important and equivalent for VE cadherin gene transcription. It is interesting to note that the loss of one site cannot be compensated by the other. Moreover, results with mutations in both sites show that transcriptional activity of the basal promoter in BAEC is completely dependent on EBS2 and EBS4, whereas these sites are less critical for gene expression in NIH-3T3. These variations in mutation susceptibility may indicate differential transcriptional mechanisms in BAEC and NIH-3T3. To identify the Ets family members that could potentially regulate the VE cadherin gene through EBS2 and EBS4, we analyzed by Northern blotting the expression of various ets genes in endothelial cells (eEND and BAEC). We chose either genes that had already been shown to be expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, such as ets-1, ets-2, and erg(24Khachigian L.M. Fries J.W.U. Benz M.W. Bonthron D.T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or genes that were known to be relatively ubiquitously expressed such as ERM (17Monté D. Baert J.-L. Defossez P.-A. de Launoit Y. Stehelin D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1397-1406PubMed Google Scholar) and ER81 (25Monté D. Coutte L. Baert J.-L. Angeli I. Stehelin D. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 771-779PubMed Google Scholar). The probes used in this study were derived from selected portions of the cDNAs (see “Experimental Procedures”) to be specific for each gene, and we verified that the probes cross-hybridized between species (data not shown). Hybridization profiles are shown Fig.7. All these genes were expressed in endothelial cells except ets-2, for which no signal could be detected even after a long exposure. Of note, low transcript levels of ets-2 were observed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by Khachigian et al. (24Khachigian L.M. Fries J.W.U. Benz M.W. Bonthron D.T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). erg and ERM transcripts were detected at high levels, whereas ets-1 and ER81 genes were weakly expressed. These data are in agreement with those from Khachigian et al. (24Khachigian L.M. Fries J.W.U. Benz M.W. Bonthron D.T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for ets-1 and erg expression in human endothelial cells; we extended this study to two other family members, ERM and ER81, that could also potentially be involved in endothelial genes expression. To test whether the Ets members defined above could interact with the VE cadherin promoter, antibodies against these proteins were used in EMSA in addition to eEND nuclear extracts using either EBS2 or EBS4 probe. As shown in Fig.8, two antibodies made against different parts of Erg blocked complex b formation with EBS4; the presence of anti-Erg antibodies did not affect the pattern observed with EBS2 probe (data not shown). These data suggest that Erg is one of the factors binding to VE cadherin promoter. None of the available antibodies against Ets-1, Ets-2, ERM, or ER81 was able to induce the formation of a supershifted complex or to disrupt DNA-protein binding in EMSA using EBS2 or EBS4 probe (data not shown), suggesting that another Ets-related protein, possibly uncharacterized, participates in the formation of the major complex. Promoting activity of the −139/+24 fragment is the basis for VE cadherin gene transcription. Within this region, three boxes have been shown to be essential for promoter activity as follows: a GT box (positions −48 to −40) and two Ets binding sites (positions −93 to −90 and −109 to −106). Furthermore, our data suggest that these sites act through binding with specific nuclear proteins. The GT box is a consensus binding site for the Sp1 family of transcription factors, which are expressed in various cell types and organs (20Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 26Hagen G. Muller S.M.B. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that the GT box present within VE cadherin promoter can interact with Sp1, Sp3, and possibly a third, yet unidentified, factor. In the case of TATA-less genes, Sp1 has been shown to be able to recruit TATA-binding protein and associated factors, thereby positioning the transcription initiation complex (27Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The lack of TATA box upstream from the VE cadherin transcriptional start site and the presence of the GT box at proximity support the notion that Sp1 could be involved in VE cadherin transcription initiation. It is well documented that Sp1 activates transcription while Sp3 acts as a repressor in most cell types studied (28Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The fact that both factors interact with VE cadherin basal promoter suggests that the GT box may be the target of a transcriptional regulation that would modulate VE cadherin expression. The relative concentration of Sp1 and Sp3 in endothelial cells may be a determining factor in the amount of VE cadherin gene expression. Sp1 family proteins are known to be DNA bending factors, and it has been hypothesized that the induced conformational change in the DNA structure could facilitate the recruitment of distal DNA-bound transcription factors and the assembly of the transcription initiation complex via protein-protein interactions (29Sjøttem E. Andersen C. Johansen T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 490-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The GT box, which occupies a key position in VE cadherin promoter, may play a role in the linkage of the upstream regulatory regions (−289/−140 and −2226/−1191) to the basic promoter. Sp1 has been shown to regulate the expression of other endothelial genes such as those coding for the platelet-derived growth factor B-chain (24Khachigian L.M. Fries J.W.U. Benz M.W. Bonthron D.T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the platelet-derived growth factor A-chain (30Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (31Zhang R. Min W. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15320-15326Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (32Neish A.S. Khachigian L.M. Park A. Baichwal V.R. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28903-28909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and KDR/flk-1 (33Patterson C. Wu Y. Lee M.-E. DeVault J.D. Runge M.S. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8410-8416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Together with our data, this indicates that Sp1 plays an important role in the acquisition of the endothelial phenotype. Our results provide evidence for the existence of two functional binding sites for the Ets family of transcription factors. Ets proteins are characterized by a unique DNA binding domain recognizing the core GGA(A/T) motif, although adjacent sequences may influence binding affinities. This extending family contains proteins involved in cell growth, differentiation, or transformation (22Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Some factors are relatively ubiquitous (Ets-2, ER81, ERM, or GABPα), and others are cell-specific such as those expressed in the hematopoietic lineage (Spi-1/PU.1, Spi-B, Elf-1, and Fli-1) or are developmentally regulated (Ets-1) (34Crepieux P. Coll J. Stehelin D. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1994; 5: 615-638PubMed Google Scholar). No endothelial specific Ets protein has been identified yet; however, expression of several ets genes has been detected by Northern blot analysis in cultured endothelial cells (ets-1, ets-2, erg, ERM, and ER81) (Ref. 24Khachigian L.M. Fries J.W.U. Benz M.W. Bonthron D.T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and this paper). EMSA with anti-Erg antibodies strongly suggest that Erg, which is abundantly expressed in endothelial cells, can bind EBS4 and therefore regulate VE cadherin transcription. However, Erg does not appear to be the major Ets regulator of VE cadherin expression for the following two reasons: 1) the signal intensity of complex a is much higher than that of complex b (Erg-dependent), and 2) Erg does not form a complex with EBS2, whereas individual mutations have shown that the contribution of EBS2 and EBS4 in VE cadherin promoter activity is comparable. GABPα is another abundant and ubiquitous Ets factor that could potentially bind to VE cadherin promoter. However, we did not retain this possibility as the electrophoretic profiles obtained with EBS2 and EBS4 are not consistent with the typical two-band pattern due to heterodimeric interaction of GABPα with GABPβ (35LaMarco K. Thompson C.C. Byers B.P. Walton E.M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Some other endothelial genes contain functional Ets binding sites in their promoter region (24Khachigian L.M. Fries J.W.U. Benz M.W. Bonthron D.T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Von der Ahe D. Nischan C. Kunz C. Otte J. Knies U. Oderwald H. Wasylyk B.

Bonthron D.T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Von der Ahe D. Nischan C. Kunz C. Otte J. Knies U. Oderwald H. Wasylyk B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30823-30828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Accordingly, characterization of the protein involved in complex a formation is underway, and its trans-acting ability on Ets-regulated endothelial genes will be evaluated. It is well established that Ets factors bind DNA as monomer (except for GABPα·GABPβ complex) but can also associate with other unrelated transcription factors bound to their cognate motifs in the vicinity of the Ets binding site (34Crepieux P. Coll J. Stehelin D. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1994; 5: 615-638PubMed Google Scholar). In this respect, Ets-1 and Sp1 were shown to synergize for promoter activity of the long terminal repeat of human lymphotropic virus type 1 (39Gégonne A. Bosselut R. Bailly R.-A. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and of the megakaryocytic αIIb integrin (40Block K.L. Shou Y. Poncz M. Blood. 1996; 88: 2071-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complete inhibition of CAT activity in transfected BAEC, observed when both Ets sites were mutated, supports the notion that a similar cooperation between the Ets-related factor and Sp1 may exist in the context of VE cadherin promoter. In conclusion, using a mutational analysis and nuclear factor DNA binding assays, we have identified three essential cis-acting elements in the proximal VE cadherin promoter. We showed that Sp1 and Sp3 interact with the GT box at positions −48/−40 and that a nuclear factor, possibly related to the Ets family, was involved in the major interaction with the two functional GGAA sites at positions −93/−90 and −109/−106. We thank J. Ghysdael for the generous gift of anti-Erg/Fli-1 antibody and J.-L. Baert for providing the ERM and ER81 antisera. We are grateful to F. Aubouy for artwork and Y. Senis and M.

https://openalex.org/W2112955530,"The clumping factor (ClfA) is a cell surface-associated protein of Staphylococcus aureus that promotes binding of fibrinogen or fibrin to the bacterial cell. Previous studies have shown that ClfA and the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 recognize the same domain at the extreme C terminus of the fibrinogen γ-chain. αIIbβ3 interaction with this domain is known to occur in close proximity to a Ca2+-binding EF-hand structure in the α-subunit. Analysis of the primary structure of ClfA indicated the presence of a potential Ca2+-binding EF-hand-like motif at residues 310–321 within the fibrinogen-binding domain. Deletion mutagenesis and site-directed mutagenesis of this EF-hand in recombinant truncated ClfA proteins (Clf40, residues 40–559; and Clf41, residues 221–559) resulted in a significant reduction of affinity for native fibrinogen and a fibrinogen γ-chain peptide. Furthermore, Ca2+ (or Mn2+) could inhibit the binding of the fibrinogen γ-chain peptide to Clf40-(40–559) and the adhesion of S. aureus cells to immobilized fibrinogen with an IC50 of 2–3 mm. In contrast, Mg2+ (or Na+) at similar concentrations had no effect on the ClfA-fibrinogen interaction. Far-UV CD analysis of Clf40-(40-559) and Clf41-(221-559) in the presence of metal ions indicated Ca2+- and Mn2+-induced differences in secondary structure. These data suggest that Ca2+ binds to an inhibitory site(s) within ClfA and induces a conformational change that is incompatible with binding to the C terminus of the γ-chain of fibrinogen.

Staphylococcus aureus causes a wide range of opportunistic infections that range from superficial skin infections to life-threatening diseases including endocarditis, pneumonia, and septicemia. Adherence of bacteria to host matrix components that is mediated by bacterial surface adhesins is the initial critical event in the pathogenesis of most infections. The extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. contains numerous glycoproteins and proteoglycans assembled into insoluble matrices that serve as substrata for the adhesion and migration of tissue cells. These processes involve integrins, a family of heterodimeric (αβ) cell-surface receptors that recognize specific ECM proteins. It has become increasingly evident that bacteria, including S. aureus, also utilize the ECM as substrata for their adhesion by way of a family of adhesins called MSCRAMM (microbialsurface components recognizingadhesive matrix molecules) (1Patti J.M. Allen B.L. McGavin M.J. Höök M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 585-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) that specifically recognize host matrix components. One important component of the ECM, also occurring in soluble form in blood plasma, is fibrinogen, a 340-kDa hexamer composed of 2α-, 2β-, and 2γ-chains linked by disulfide bonds. This protein is recognized by several integrins including the platelet integrin αIIbβ3. Activation of platelets and integrin αIIbβ3 results in fibrinogen-dependent aggregation in vitro and the formation of platelet-fibrin thrombi in vivo. S. aureus contains several fibrinogen-binding proteins, one of which (clumping factor, ClfA) is primarily responsible for the clumping of bacteria in fibrinogen solutions and bacterial adherence to fibrinogen substrata (2McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The gene encoding the fibrinogen-binding protein of S. aureus has been cloned, sequenced, and characterized in our laboratory (2McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The clfA gene encodes a 933-amino acid protein that contains structural features characteristic of many cell surface-associated proteins from Gram-positive bacteria including a typical cell wall attachment region comprising an LPDTG motif, a hydrophobic transmembrane sequence, and a positively charged C terminus (Fig. 1). In addition, the protein contains a repeat sequence (region R) of 308 alternating aspartate and serine residues located just outside the cell wall attachment region. Region R is required for the surface display of the 520-amino acid-long region A, which contains the fibrinogen-binding domain (3McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 4Hartford O. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Recombinant region A bound fibrinogen and strongly inhibited bacteria-fibrinogen interactions, as did anti-region A antibodies. Analysis of PCR-generated truncated proteins localized the binding domain to between residues 221 and 559 (3McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In earlier studies, Hawiger and co-workers (5Hawiger J. Timmons S. Strong D.D. Cottrell B.A. Riley M. Doolittle R.F. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Strong D.D. Laudano A.P. Hawiger J. Doolittle R.F. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) showed that a synthetic peptide mimicking the extreme C terminus of the fibrinogen γ-chain inhibited fibrinogen-induced clumping of S. aureuscells. Recently, it was shown that purified recombinant ClfA protein specifically recognized these amino acid residues and that a synthetic peptide corresponding to this domain effectively inhibited binding of fibrinogen to recombinant ClfA (7McDevitt D.

Interestingly, this same synthetic peptide also interacts with the α-subunit of the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (8Hawiger J. Timmons S. Kloczewiak M. Strong D.D. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2068-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 9Kloczewiak M. Timmons S. Lukas T. Hawiger J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The γ-chain-binding site has been mapped to a region of the αIIb polypeptide that contains a sequence motif resembling the Ca2+-binding EF-hand motif found in many eukaryotic Ca2+-binding proteins (10D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3440-3446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The EF-hand motif consists of 13 residues, with coordination typically supplied by oxygenated residues at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, and 12 and by a solvent molecule hydrogen-bonded to residue 9 (Fig. 2 A) (11Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2241-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). These residues form a coordination sphere for the cation and are flanked by α-helices. Cooperative binding of multiple Ca2+ ions is not unusual, and more than one Ca2+-binding motif often can be found within the same protein. Analysis of the α-subunit of αIIbβ3 revealed the presence of four functional motifs similar to EF-hands, although they lack an oxygenated residue at position 12 (Fig. 2 B) (31Cierniewski C.S. Haas T.A. Smith J.W. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12238-12246Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 39Gulino D. Boudignon C. Zhang L. Concord E. Rabiet M.-J. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking experiments provided direct evidence for the role of an αIIb EF-hand-like sequence in fibrinogen binding (10D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol.

In addition, a peptide corresponding to this EF-hand sequence bound to fibrinogen in a divalent cation-dependent manner (12D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Matseuda G.R. Plow E.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data provide evidence for the involvement of EF-hand-like sequences in the divalent cation-dependent binding of the fibrinogen C-terminal γ-chain peptide. Further biochemical characterization of integrin αIIbβ3 has demonstrated that Ca2+ binds to two distinct classes of sites: high affinity binding sites that promote ligand binding and low affinity binding sites that inhibit ligand binding (13Hu D.D. Barbas III, C.F. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21745-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this report, we propose a mode of interaction between ClfA and the fibrinogen γ-chain peptide that exhibits some similarities to αIIbβ3-ligand interactions. A potential divalent cation-binding EF-hand motif was identified in ClfA (Figs. 1and 2 C). It differs from the EF-hand consensus (Fig. 2, A and B) at only one residue, a non-cation-coordinating residue. We demonstrate that region A of ClfA can bind Ca2+ and that the interaction between region A and fibrinogen is inhibited by millimolar concentrations of Ca2+. In addition, we show using far-UV spectroscopy that Ca2+ ions affect the secondary structure of the fibrinogen-binding region of ClfA. Site-specific mutants of ClfA with a modified EF-hand were generated and shown to have a lower affinity for fibrinogen compared with the wild type. In addition, the effects of Ca2+ were reduced in these mutant proteins. Together, these studies indicate that Ca2+ plays a regulatory role in the interaction of fibrinogen and region A of ClfA. Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (14Bullock W.O. Fernandez J.M. Short J.M. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 376Google Scholar) was used as the bacterial host for plasmid cloning and protein expression. E. coli cells harboring plasmids were routinely grown in L-broth, Terrific broth, and L-agar (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was incorporated as appropriate. S. aureus strain Newman was grown in Trypticase soy broth or agar. Restriction and DNA modification enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. or Promega and were used according to the manufacturers' instructions. DNA manipulations were performed using standard procedures (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). PCR, with the oligonucleotides listed in TableI, was used to amplify specific clfA fragments from chromosomal DNA of S. aureusstrain Newman. Genomic DNA was isolated as described previously (16Bollet C. Gevaudan M.J. de Lamballerie X. Zandotti C. de Micco P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides contained restriction enzyme cleavage sites at their 5′-ends to facilitate directional cloning. PCR was performed with a Perkin-Elmer DNA thermocycler. Reaction mixtures contained 50 ng of target DNA, 100 pmol of forward and reverse primers, 10 mmKCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mmMgSO4, 250 μm each dNTP, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2 units of Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc.). The reaction mixtures were overlaid with 100 μl of mineral oil and amplified for 25 cycles consisting of 1 min of denaturation at 94 °C, a 1-min annealing period at a temperature depending on the primers used, and an extension of 1 min, 30 s at 72 °C. On completion of the 25 cycles, the reaction mixture was incubated at 72 °C for 10 min. After amplification, the PCR products were treated with the Wizard PCR-preps DNA purification system (Promega) and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.Table ISynthetic oligonucleotides used for amplifying clfA gene fragments from S. aureus Newman genomic DNA and site-directed mutagenesis and deletion mutagenesisExpression constructs (amino acids)SequenceTruncated proteins pCF40-(40–559)DOCF1CGCGGATCCAGTGAAAATAGTGTTACGCAATCTDOCR1CGCAAGCTTCTCTGGAATTGGTTCAATTTC pCF41-(221–559)F5TATGGATCCATGGTAGCTGCAGATGGCACCDOCR1CGCAAGCTTCTCTGGAATTGGTTCAATTTCDeletion mutagenesis pCF51-(40–309,322–559DOCF1CGCGGATCCAGTGAAAATAGTGTTACGCAATCTDOCR3GCTCTAGAGATTACACCATTTGCCAATACTTGDOCF2GCTCTAGATATGTAAATACTAAAGATGATGTADOCR1CGCAAGCTTCTCTGGAATTGGTTCAATTTC pCF64-(221–309,322–559) (as for pCF51, except F5 was used instead of DOCF1)Site-directed mutagenesis Flanking primersF5TATGGATCCATGGTAGCTGCAGATGGCACCDOCR1CGCAAGCTTCTCTGGAATTGGTTCAATTTC Internal primerspCF68 (D310A/D312A/T318A/D321A)DOCF7CGGGGCGTCATCGCTAGTGCTGGTAATGTTATTTATGCATTTACAGCCTATGTADOCR6GCCGACGCCATTTGCCAATACTTGATCTCCAGCpCF69 (D310A)DOCF3CGGGGCGTCATCGCTAGTGATGGTAATGTTATTTATDOCR6GCCGACGCCATTTGCCAATACTTGATCTCCAGCpCF94 (D310A/D312A)OCF12CGGGGCGTCATCGCTAGTGCTGGTAATGTTATTTATDOCR6GCCGACGCCATTTGCCAATACTTGATCTCCAGC Open table in a new tab Amplified fragments of the clfA gene were cloned into the expression plasmid pQE30 (QIAGEN Inc.) to generate the constructs pCF40-(40–559) and pCF41-(221–559). Recombinant protein expressed from this vector contains an N-terminal extension of six histidine residues (His tag). These fragments of the clfA gene were also cloned into the expression plasmid pGEX-KG such that an in-frame fusion was formed with glutathione S-transferase (17Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). Residues 310–321 of ClfA corresponding to a putative Ca2+-binding EF-hand were deleted in Clf40-(40–559) and Clf41-(221–559). The deletion mutant plasmids were designated pCF51 and pCF64, respectively. Construction of pCF51 involved two separate PCRs. The first reaction amplified DNA encoding residues 40–309 using a reverse primer (DOCR3) with an XbaI site incorporated at the 5′-end and a forward primer (DOCF1) incorporating a BamHI site. The second reaction amplified DNA encoding residues 332–559 using a forward primer (DOCF2) incorporating an XbaI site and a reverse primer (DOCR1) incorporating a HindIII site. Following cleavage by XbaI and either BamHI or HindIII (depending on the reaction), the two products were ligated together and cloned into the expression vector pQE30 as described above. Creation of the XbaI site introduced a serine and an arginine residue at the site of deletion. pCF64 was constructed in the same way using the appropriate forward primer (F5) in the first reaction. Plasmid DNA purified from E. coli XL1- Blue cells containing pCF40-(40–559) and pCF41-(221–559) served as the template in the mutagenesis studies. The residues were mutated to alanine as single, double, or quadruple mutations (Table I). A novel method of mutagenesis was developed that involved two separate PCRs. 2D. P. O'Connell, T. Nanavaty, M. Höök, and T. J. Foster, manuscript in preparation. The first reaction employed a flanking reverse primer (incorporating a HindIII site) and a forward primer that introduced the nucleotide mismatch required for the desired mutation and, in addition, incorporated a novel restriction site at the 5′-end of the oligonucleotide that would not affect the amino acid sequence of the final gene product. In the second reaction, a reverse primer incorporating the same silent restriction site mutation was used in conjunction with a flanking forward primer (with a BamHI site). Both gene fragments were digested at the common restriction site, ligated, digested with BamHI and HindIII, cloned into the expression vector pQE30, and transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue cells. Transformants were screened for the proper plasmid construction. The DNA sequence was verified by the dideoxy termination method (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using α-35S-dATP (Amersham Corp.) and Sequenase 4.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The oligonucleotides used to construct the site-directed mutants are listed in Table I. Recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coliXL1-Blue cells and expressed as described previously (3McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins containing the His tag were purified by immobilized metal chelate affinity chromatography. A iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose 6B Fast Flow column (10 × 1 cm; Sigma) was charged with 150 mm Ni2+ and equilibrated with binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9)). The cleared lysed cell supernatant was applied to the column and washed with binding buffer until the absorbance at 280 nm of the eluate was <0.001. Bound protein was eluted with a continuous linear gradient of imidazole (5–100 mm; total volume of 200 ml) in 0.5 m NaCl and 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9). Protein-containing fractions were dialyzed against 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) and applied to a Q-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. Bound protein was eluted with a continuous linear gradient of NaCl (50–500 mm; total volume of 200 ml) in 20 mm Tris-HCl and 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.9). Eluted fractions were monitored by absorbance at 280 nm, and peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblotting. The glutathione S-transferase-Clf41-(221–559) fusion protein was purified by glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) affinity chromatography and cleaved with bovine thrombin as described previously (3McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The recombinant MSCRAMM fragment was isolated after passing the digest through a glutathione-Sepharose column, followed by ion-exchange chromatography on a Q-sepharose column as described above. Fibrinogen-binding proteins fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane were detected using fibrinogen conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.) as described previously (3McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The adherence of S. aureus Newman cells expressing ClfA to microtiter wells coated with fibrinogen was assayed as described previously (6Strong D.D. Laudano A.P. Hawiger J. Doolittle R.F. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The ability of recombinant protein to bind to fibrinogen was analyzed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Microtiter wells (Sarstedt, Inc.) were coated with 5 μg/ml fibrinogen (Kabi Pharmacia/Chromogenix) in coating solution (0.02% sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.6)) for 18 h at room temperature. The plates were washed three times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (PBS-TB). A solution of 2.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS was added to the wells to block any remaining protein-binding sites. After 1 h at 37 °C, the wells were washed again three times with PBS-TB, and purified recombinant protein in PBS was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The wells were again washed with PBS-TB and incubated with polyclonal antiserum raised against Clf41-(221–559), diluted 1:800, for 1 h. After further washing, 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase-labeled protein A (1:1000; Sigma) was added. Following incubation for 1 h at 37 °C and washing with PBS-TB, 100 μl of chromogenic substrate (580 μg/ml tetramethylbenzidine and 0.0001% H2O2 in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0)) was added per well and developed for 10 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 2 mH2SO4. Plates were read at 450 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Labsystems Multiskan Plus). A fluorescence polarization assay was developed to determine the equilibrium constants for the interaction of the recombinant proteins with a synthetic peptide conjugated with a fluorescent probe. This peptide consisted of the 17 C-terminal residues of the γ-chain of fibrinogen (i.e.GEGQQHHLGGAKQAGDV) and was synthesized by a solid-phase method on a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol resin using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and a Model 396 multiple peptide synthesizer (Advanced ChemTech Inc.). The peptide was labeled with fluorescein as follows. The peptide (1 mg in H20) was incubated with fluorescein succinimidyl ester (1 mg dissolved in 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide) at 37 °C for 60 min in the presence of coupling buffer (100 mmKH2PO4 (pH 7.0)). The reaction was quenched by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), vortexed, and left at room temperature for 30 min. The fluoresceinated peptide was fractionated by reverse-phase chromatography on a Delta-Pak C18 Radial-Pak cartridge HPLC column connected to a Waters 486 multi-wavelength detector. The labeling procedure can yield three forms of fluoresceinated peptide with the probe attached to 1) the N-terminal amino group, 2) the amino group of the internal lysine residue, and 3) the amino groups in both positions. Fractionation by HPLC yielded two major and one minor fluorescein-containing peak. Substitutions at the internal lysine residue should yield a peptide resistant to trypsin digestion. The separated peptides were incubated with trypsin, followed by HPLC analysis. Only one of the original major peaks contained peptide susceptible to trypsin (data not shown). This peptide, which contains the fluorescein probe linked to the N-terminal amino group, was used in the fluorescence polarization studies. A scrambled peptide consisting of the 17 C-terminal residues of the γ-chain in a random sequence (i.e. GHEHGLQGQGAVKDGAQ) was used as a control. Recombinant protein in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) was incubated with 10 nm peptide in the dark at 20 °C for 3 h. Samples were then analyzed using a Beacon fluorescence polarization system. Binding curves were analyzed by nonlinear regression used to fit a binding function defined as in Equation 1, ΔP=ΔPmax·[protein]KD+[protein]Equation 1 where ΔP corresponds to the change in fluorescence polarization, ΔPmax is the maximum fluorescence polarization change, and KD is the dissociation constant of the interaction. A single ligand-binding site was assumed in this analysis. The average secondary structures of recombinant proteins, in the presence and absence of metal ions, were monitored by CD spectroscopy on a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter calibrated with 0.1% (w/v) 10-camphorsulfonic acid-d solution. CD spectra were measured at 25 °C in a 0.2-mm path length quartz cell, and six scans from 250 to 180 nm (far-UV) were generated and averaged. Protein concentrations, determined using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm (31,320m−1 cm−1), were typically 20 μm in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Molar ellipticity is expressed in degrees·cm2·mol−1. To examine a possible effect of divalent cations on the ClfA-fibrinogen interaction, a fluorescence polarization assay was developed using recombinant forms of ClfA encompassing full-length region A (Clf40, residues 40–559) or the smallest truncated protein that maintained fibrinogen-binding activity (Clf41, residues 221–559) and the fluorescently labeled C-terminal γ-chain peptide. Since fibrinogen is known to be a Ca2+-binding protein (23Marguerie G. Chagniel G. Suscillon M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 490: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we chose to use the γ-chain peptide as a ligand and assumed that the observed effects of metal ions would reflect interactions with ClfA. We have previously shown that the fibrinogen γ-chain peptide effectively inhibits interaction between ClfA and native fibrinogen (7McDevitt D. Nanavaty T. House-Pompeo K. Bell E.C. Turner T. McIntire L. Foster T. Höök M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In the absence of added metal ions, Clf40-(40–559) bound the γ-chain peptide with a dissociation constant of 20.8 ± 2.5 μm (Fig. 3). An unlabeled γ-chain peptide inhibited the binding of the fluorescent peptide to ClfA in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas a scrambled version of the peptide had no effect at similar concentrations (Fig. 3, inset). Inclusion of Ca2+ (5 mm) significantly reduced the binding affinity for the peptide (KD > 200 μm) (Fig. 3). Incubation of Clf40-(40–559) with 5 mm Mn2+ caused complete loss of γ-chain peptide-binding activity. On the other hand, Mg2+ or Na+ at similar concentrations had no effect on protein-peptide interaction (Fig.4 A). In addition, Mg2+ (5 mm) did not counteract the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ (data not shown). Incubation of Clf40-(40–559) with EDTA (5 mm) increased the affinity of MSCRAMM for the γ-chain peptide by 2-fold (KD = 11.5 ± 0.6 μm) compared with non-EDTA-treated protein (KD = 20.8 ± 2.5 μm). It is likely that contaminating Ca2+ and Mn2+ in the assay solutions and protein preparations contribute to inhibition of the protein-peptide interaction. Inclusion of EDTA removes these ions. Furthermore, these data show that divalent cations are not required to promote γ-chain peptide binding. Results similar to those described for Clf40-(40–559) were obtained when these experiments were repeated with the smaller construct, Clf41-(221–559). Thus, in the absence of added metal ions, Clf41-(221–559) bound the γ-chain peptide with a dissociation constant of 15.0 ± 1.1 μm (Fig. 3), and the addition of 5 mm EDTA slightly reduced the KD to 11.1 ± 0.4 μm. When these experiments were repeated with Clf41-(221–559) without an N-terminal extension of histidine residues, identical results were obtained, indicating that the effects of cations on region A function are independent of the purification tag (data not shown).Figure 4Effects of divalent cations on the interaction of Clf40(40–559) with the fibrinogen γ-chain peptide (A) and S. aureus cell adherence to native fibrinogen (B). Binding of the fluorescent γ-chain peptide to Clf40-(40–559) in A or bacterial adherence to fibrinogen in B was measured as a function of Ca2+ (•) or Mg2+ (□). These assays were performed at least three times, each yielding a similar result.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The interaction of Clf40-(40–559) with a set amount of fluoresceinated γ-chain peptide across a concentration range of Ca2+ and Mg2+ was also measured. With Mg2+, the binding of the γ-chain peptide to Clf40-(40–559) was unaffected across the entire concentration range tested. In contrast, concentrations of Ca2+ above 2 mm inhibited the interaction (Fig.4 A). At concentrations greater than 5 mm, very little binding of the γ-chain peptide to region A was observed. Very similar results were obtained when the effects of different cations on S. aureus cell adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen were measured (Fig. 4 B). Concentrations of Ca2+ above 2 mm inhibited bacterial adhesion to fibrinogen, whereas Mg2+ did not affect cell adhesion throughout the concentration range analyzed. These results indicate the existence of an inhibitory Ca2+-binding site in region A of ClfA with an apparent KD of 2.5 mm, a value similar to the physiological concentration of Ca2+ (∼2.5 mm) present in normal human sera. Thus, under some physiological conditions, this site may be occupied. Inclusion of Mg2+ had no effect on Ca2+-induced inhibition (data not shown), suggesting that Mg2+ is unable to compete with Ca2+ for binding to the inhibitory binding site and that there is a certain degree of specificity for Ca2+. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to investigate if the binding of Ca2+ ions affects the secondary structures of the Clf40-(40–559) and Clf41-(221–559) proteins. Cation binding by integrins has been shown to be associated with conformational changes. For example, expression of the epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody 24 on αLβ2 was dependent o"
https://openalex.org/W2084007849,"In the past, eukaryotic cell-derived complexes of the Myc/Max/Mad network of transcriptional regulators have largely been refractory to DNA binding studies. We have developed electrophoretic mobility shift assay conditions to measure specific DNA binding of Myc/Max/Mad network complexes using a COS7 cell-based overexpression system. With the established protocol, we have measured on- and off-rates of c-Myc/Max, Max/Max, and Mad1/Max complexes and determined relative affinities. All three complexes appeared to bind with comparable affinity to a Myc E-box sequence. Furthermore, our data derived from competition experiments suggested that the Mad3/Max and Mad4/Max complexes also possess comparable DNA binding affinities. The conditions established for COS7 cell-overexpressed proteins were then used to identify c-Myc/Max, Max/Max, and Mnt/Max complexes in HL-60 cells. However, no Mad1/Max could be detected, despite the induction of Mad1 expression during differentiation. Whereas the DNA binding activity of c-Myc/Max complexes was down-regulated, Max/Max binding increased, and Mnt/Max binding remained unchanged. In addition, we have also tested for upstream stimulatory factor (USF) binding and observed that, in agreement with published data, USF comprises a major Myc E-box-binding factor that is more abundant than any of the Myc/Max/Mad network complexes. Similar to the Mnt/Max complex, the binding activity of USF remained constant during HL-60 differentiation. Our findings establish conditions for the analysis of DNA binding of Myc/Max/Mad complexes and indicate posttranslational regulation of the Max/Max complex."

The small subunit of a caspase is derived from the carboxyl terminus of the precursor, while the large subunit originates from the region immediately upstream of the small subunit, leaving an amino-terminal prodomain of varying lengths in different caspases. On the basis of prodomain size, caspases can be divided into two groups, those with relatively long amino-terminal prodomains and those without. It is suggested that in caspases with long prodomains, the amino-terminal region is required for their recruitment to death receptor complexes (7Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

Caspase-2 activation occurs early during apoptosis mediated by factor withdrawal, γ-irradiation, etoposide treatment (20Harvey N.L. Butt A.J. Kumar S. J. Biol.

Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Since Nedd2 contains a long prodomain, it is possible that the Nedd2 precursor (pro-Nedd2) dimerizes prior to autoprocessing, in a manner similar to that suggested for interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (9Van Criekinge W. Beyaert R. Van de Craen M. Vandenabeele P. Schotte P. De Valck D. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27245-27248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we have analyzed the dimerization of pro-Nedd2 using the yeast two-hybrid assay. By mutation analysis, we have also studied the mechanism of activation of Nedd2 in vitro and in vivo and its functional implications in autocatalysis and cell killing.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we show that pro-Nedd2 is able to dimerize in S. cerevisiae. Dimerization of pro-Nedd2 only occurred in mutants that lacked the ability to autoprocess, and removal of either the prodomain or the C terminus abolished this interaction. This is consistent with the assumption that dimerization occurs prior to the processing of pro-Nedd2. Preceding this study, only interleukin-1β-converting enzyme had been shown to be able to form dimers in vivo (9Van Criekinge W. Beyaert R. Van de Craen M. Vandenabeele P. Schotte P. De Valck D. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27245-27248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but it is likely that all caspases containing long amino-terminal prodomains are capable of forming homodimers. This would be in keeping with the processing of many other enzymes unrelated to caspases, where the prodomain region is required for optimal folding and maturation of the active enzyme (29Baker D. Shiau A.K. Agarad D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the prodomain alone, devoid of the rest of the sequence, was able to homodimerize. However, the prodomain did not heterodimerize with the Cys320 pro-Nedd2, suggesting that the prodomain-prodomain interaction is important but not sufficient to stabilize the pro-Nedd2 dimer. No such studies have been carried out with interleukin-1β-converting enzyme, but a similar scenario can be envisaged with other caspases with long prodomain regions.Since wild-type Nedd2 was unable to form stable dimers in yeast, we analyzed various Asp mutants that are known to affect the processing of Nedd2. Mutations of Asp326, Asp330, or Asp333 restored the ability of pro-Nedd2 to form dimers in S. cerevisiae. None of these mutants showed appreciable processing when expressed in S. cerevisiae. When analyzed in transient cell killing experiments, Asp326 and Asp333 were unable to induce apoptosis in NIH-3T3 cells, while Asp330 showed reduced (∼45%) activity compared with wild-type Nedd2. In in vitro proteolysis assays, Asp326 was poorly cleaved by recombinant active Nedd2, while Asp330 and Asp333 showed partial processing. This partial cleavability of pro-Nedd2, both in vitro and in NIH-3T3 cells, is consistent with the relative dimerization potential of these mutants; mutants that do not undergo processing efficiently form dimers more effectively.Based on microsequencing of the active enzyme subunits resulting from expression of pro-Nedd2 in E. coli, previous work has defined the cleavage sites in pro-Nedd2 as DNKD169↓, DQQD333↓, and EESD347↓ (23Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that to generate the small subunit of the mature enzyme, the first cleavage probably occurs at Asp333 followed by further cleavage at Asp347. Although cleavage at Asp347 generates the mature p12 subunit, it is not crucial for catalytic activity of Nedd2, since the Asp347 mutant can undergo processing and retains proapoptotic activity similar to wild-type Nedd2. In immunoblot analysis of Nedd2 following Fas antibody and etoposide treatment of Jurkat cells, a product of about 14 kDa is always evident during early stages, which appears to be the precursor for p12 that becomes apparent during later stages of apoptosis.1 Mutation at Asp169, at which the cleavage is known to occur to generate the p18 subunit by removing the prodomain (23Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), also had no effect on cell killing, suggesting that removal of prodomain is not essential to generate active enzyme.Using a Semliki Forest virus expression system, Allet et al.(24Allet B. Hochmann A. Martinou I. Missotten M. Antonsson B. Sadoul R. Martinou J.-C. Bernasconi L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 480-486Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) showed that the Asp135 mutant is unable to be processed in infected Chinese hamster ovary cells. This mutant was also unable to induce cell death when microinjected into sympathetic neurons (24Allet B. Hochmann A. Martinou I. Missotten M. Antonsson B. Sadoul R. Martinou J.-C. Bernasconi L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 480-486Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with these earlier studies. Since the Asp135 mutant was not well cleaved by recombinant Nedd2, even at Asp residues in the C-terminal region of pro-Nedd2, it appears that the Asp135 residue is important in maintaining the overall structure of the precursor molecule, and in the mutant this structure is disrupted in such a way that other cleavage sites are no longer accessible to caspase cleavage. This is further supported by our data showing that despite the fact that Asp135 is not processed, unlike Cys320, it is unable to homodimerize or to heterodimerize with Cys320 in S. cerevisiae. As expected, the Asp135 mutant also failed to induce apoptosis when overexpressed in mammalian cells. Mutation of Asp326 also inhibited processing and cell killing activity of Nedd2, suggesting a situation similar to Asp135.Our results clearly suggest that pro-Nedd2 can homodimerize prior to processing. We propose that homodimerization of the precursor molecules is important for its autoprocessing and proapoptotic activity and is distinct from oligomerization of subunits that constitute the active enzyme. Our data also indicate that autoprocessing occurs in a concentration-dependent manner and that killing of cells by overexpression of pro-Nedd2 is mainly due to autoactivation. ProNedd2 is widely expressed in many cell types without having any adverse effect (11Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1613-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 12Wang L. Miura M. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Yuan J.

There is some evidence for transcriptional activation of Nedd2 preceding cell death in various systems (16Kinoshita M. Tomimoto H. Kinoshita A. Kumar S. Noda M. J. Cerebr. Blood Flow Metab. 1997; 17: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Asahi M. Hoshimura M. Uemura Y. Tokime T. Kojima M. Ohtsuka T. Matsuura N. Aoki T. Shibahara K. Kikuchi H. J. Cerebr.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5042-5053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, recruitment through adaptors, such as RAIDD (19Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), may also be important in achieving optimum precursor concentration in specific cellular compartments, promoting autocleavage. Since pro-Nedd2 can also be cleaved into active subunits by downstream caspases, such as caspase-3, once these caspases are activated, a cascade event would ensure that all precursor is rapidly processed in cells undergoing apoptosis, thus amplifying the apoptotic response. Caspases are a family of mammalian cysteine proteases that share structural and, in some cases, functional similarity with the Caenorhabditis elegans cell death protease CED-3 (1Alnemri E.S.

Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar). Caspases are produced as zymogens and require cleavage into two subunits, which constitute the active enzyme (reviewed in Refs. 3Kumar S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 198-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 4Kumar S. Lavin M.F. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 3: 255-267PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A.

The small subunit of a caspase is derived from the carboxyl terminus of the precursor, while the large subunit originates from the region immediately upstream of the small subunit, leaving an amino-terminal prodomain of varying lengths in different caspases. On the basis of prodomain size, caspases can be divided into two groups, those with relatively long amino-terminal prodomains and those without. It is suggested that in caspases with long prodomains, the amino-terminal region is required for their recruitment to death receptor complexes (7Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

The long prodomain is also likely to serve a function in dimerization and autoprocessing as suggested by a recent study with interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (caspase-1) (9Van Criekinge W. Beyaert R.

Nedd2 was initially identified as a developmentally regulated gene in the mouse central nervous system (10Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and later shown to encode a cysteine protease similar to interleukin-1β-converting enzyme and CED-3 (11Kumar S. Kinoshita M.

Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have implicated Nedd2 (ICH-1/caspase-2) directly or indirectly in apoptosis. Overexpression of Nedd2 induces apoptosis in various cell types (11Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A.

Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), while expression of antisense Nedd2 in FDC-P1 factor-dependent cells delays the onset of apoptosis induced by factor withdrawal (13Kumar S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Abrogation of Nedd2expression by antisense oligonucleotides rescues PC12 cells from apoptosis induced by nerve growth factor deprivation but not by superoxide dismutase down-regulation (14Troy C.M. Stefanis L. Greene L.A. Shelanski M.L. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1911-1918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, an alternatively spliced form of caspase-2, which encodes a truncated protein, has been shown to protect against cell death induced by serum withdrawal in Rat-1 and NIH-3T3 cells, but not in all cell types (12Wang L.

Since pro-Nedd2 can also be cleaved into active subunits by downstream caspases, such as caspase-3, once these caspases are activated, a cascade event would ensure that all precursor is rapidly processed in cells undergoing apoptosis, thus amplifying the apoptotic response. In this paper, we show that pro-Nedd2 is able to dimerize in S. cerevisiae. Dimerization of pro-Nedd2 only occurred in mutants that lacked the ability to autoprocess, and removal of either the prodomain or the C terminus abolished this interaction. This is consistent with the assumption that dimerization occurs prior to the processing of pro-Nedd2. Preceding this study, only interleukin-1β-converting enzyme had been shown to be able to form dimers in vivo (9Van Criekinge W. Beyaert R. Van de Craen M. Vandenabeele P. Schotte P. De Valck D. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27245-27248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but it is likely that all caspases containing long amino-terminal prodomains are capable of forming homodimers. This would be in keeping with the processing of many other enzymes unrelated to caspases, where the prodomain region is required for optimal folding and maturation of the active enzyme (29Baker D. Shiau A.K. Agarad D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the prodomain alone, devoid of the rest of the sequence, was able to homodimerize. However, the prodomain did not heterodimerize with the Cys320 pro-Nedd2, suggesting that the prodomain-prodomain interaction is important but not sufficient to stabilize the pro-Nedd2 dimer. No such studies have been carried out with interleukin-1β-converting enzyme, but a similar scenario can be envisaged with other caspases with long prodomain regions. Since wild-type Nedd2 was unable to form stable dimers in yeast, we analyzed various Asp mutants that are known to affect the processing of Nedd2. Mutations of Asp326, Asp330, or Asp333 restored the ability of pro-Nedd2 to form dimers in S. cerevisiae. None of these mutants showed appreciable processing when expressed in S. cerevisiae. When analyzed in transient cell killing experiments, Asp326 and Asp333 were unable to induce apoptosis in NIH-3T3 cells, while Asp330 showed reduced (∼45%) activity compared with wild-type Nedd2. In in vitro proteolysis assays, Asp326 was poorly cleaved by recombinant active Nedd2, while Asp330 and Asp333 showed partial processing. This partial cleavability of pro-Nedd2, both in vitro and in NIH-3T3 cells, is consistent with the relative dimerization potential of these mutants; mutants that do not undergo processing efficiently form dimers more effectively. Based on microsequencing of the active enzyme subunits resulting from expression of pro-Nedd2 in E. coli, previous work has defined the cleavage sites in pro-Nedd2 as DNKD169↓, DQQD333↓, and EESD347↓ (23Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that to generate the small subunit of the mature enzyme, the first cleavage probably occurs at Asp333 followed by further cleavage at Asp347. Although cleavage at Asp347 generates the mature p12 subunit, it is not crucial for catalytic activity of Nedd2, since the Asp347 mutant can undergo processing and retains proapoptotic activity similar to wild-type Nedd2. In immunoblot analysis of Nedd2 following Fas antibody and etoposide treatment of Jurkat cells, a product of about 14 kDa is always evident during early stages, which appears to be the precursor for p12 that becomes apparent during later stages of apoptosis.1 Mutation at Asp169, at which the cleavage is known to occur to generate the p18 subunit by removing the prodomain (23Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), also had no effect on cell killing, suggesting that removal of prodomain is not essential to generate active enzyme. Using a Semliki Forest virus expression system, Allet et al.(24Allet B. Hochmann A. Martinou I. Missotten M. Antonsson B. Sadoul R. Martinou J.-C. Bernasconi L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 480-486Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) showed that the Asp135 mutant is unable to be processed in infected Chinese hamster ovary cells. This mutant was also unable to induce cell death when microinjected into sympathetic neurons (24Allet B. Hochmann A. Martinou I. Missotten M. Antonsson B. Sadoul R. Martinou J.-C. Bernasconi L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 480-486Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with these earlier studies. Since the Asp135 mutant was not well cleaved by recombinant Nedd2, even at Asp residues in the C-terminal region of pro-Nedd2, it appears that the Asp135 residue is important in maintaining the overall structure of the precursor molecule, and in the mutant this structure is disrupted in such a way that other cleavage sites are no longer accessible to caspase cleavage. This is further supported by our data showing that despite the fact that Asp135 is not processed, unlike Cys320, it is unable to homodimerize or to heterodimerize with Cys320 in S. cerevisiae. As expected, the Asp135 mutant also failed to induce apoptosis when overexpressed in mammalian cells. Mutation of Asp326 also inhibited processing and cell killing activity of Nedd2, suggesting a situation similar to Asp135. Our results clearly suggest that pro-Nedd2 can homodimerize prior to processing. We propose that homodimerization of the precursor molecules is important for its autoprocessing and proapoptotic activity and is distinct from oligomerization of subunits that constitute the active enzyme. Our data also indicate that autoprocessing occurs in a concentration-dependent manner and that killing of cells by overexpression of pro-Nedd2 is mainly due to autoactivation. ProNedd2 is widely expressed in many cell types without having any adverse effect (11Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A.

It has the ability to alter endothelial functions and is regarded as a causal agent in atherogenesis. In this study, the modulation of arachidonate release by lyso-PC in human umbilical vein endothelial cells was examined. Incubation of endothelial cells with lyso-PC resulted in an enhanced release of arachidonate in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Maximum arachidonate release was observed at 10 min of incubation with 50 μmlyso-PC. Lyso-PC species containing palmitoyl (C16:0) or stearoyl (C18:0) groups elicited the enhancement of arachidonate release, while other lysolipids such as lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidylinositol, or lysophosphatidate were relatively ineffective. Lyso-PC-induced arachidonate release was decreased by treatment of cells with PLA2 inhibitors such as para-bromophenacyl bromide and arachidonoyl trifluoromethyl ketone. Furthermore, arachidonate release was attenuated in cells grown in the presence of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides that specifically bind cytosolic PLA2 mRNA. Treatment of cells with lyso-PC resulted in a translocation of PLA2 activity from the cytosolic to the membrane fractions of cells. Lyso-PC induced a rapid influx of Ca2+ from the medium into the cells, with a simultaneous enhancement of protein kinase C (PKC) activity in the membrane fractions. The lyso-PC-induced arachidonate release was attenuated when cells were preincubated with specific inhibitors of PKC (staurosporine and Ro31–8220) or a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular regulated kinase kinase (PD098059). Taken together, the results of this study show that lyso-PC caused the elevation of cellular Ca2+ and the activation of PKC, which stimulated cytosolic PLA2 in an indirect manner and resulted in an enhanced release of arachidonate.

The release of arachidonate from phospholipids is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of eicosanoids via the arachidonate cascade (1Smith W.L. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Arachidonate and its metabolites possess diverse biological properties, many of which are related to vascular homeostasis (1Smith W.L. Biochem.

Although different mechanisms have been proposed for the release of arachidonate in mammalian cells, the hydrolysis of the acyl chain at the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids by phospholipase A2(PLA2) 1The abbreviations used are: PLA2, phospholipase A2; sPLA2, secretory phospholipase A2; cPLA2, cytosolic phospholipase A2; pBPB, para-bromophenacyl bromide; AACOCF3, arachidonoyl trifluoromethyl ketone; PKC, protein kinase C; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; lyso-PC, lysophosphatidylcholine. is regarded as the primary pathway for this reaction (1Smith W.L.

Those that have been purified and well characterized include the “type II” 14-kDa secretory PLA2 (sPLA2) and the “type IV” 85-kDa cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) (for reviews, see Refs. 3Clark J.D.

These two isoforms are products of distinct genes (5Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) and have different properties. The cPLA2preferentially hydrolyzes phospholipid substrates containing arachidonate at the sn-2 position (6Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L.

The sPLA2 requires millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ for maximum activity, while cPLA2 contains a calcium-dependent lipid binding domain and requires submicromolar levels for translocation to cellular membranes (6Clark J.D.

Thus, given its many biological properties, lyso-PC has been postulated to be an important causal agent in inflammation and atherosclerosis (34Vadas P. Pruzanski W. Lab.

The interactions among phosphatidylcholine, fatty acids, lyso-PC, and sPLA2 have been examined in in vitro kinetic studies (36Bent E.D. Bell J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). An abrupt increase in PLA2 activity after an initial lag period was observed in these studies. This pattern of activity was attributed to the accumulation of fatty acid and lysophospholipids, which together altered the organization of substrate vesicles (36Bent E.D. Bell J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In light of the many biological effects of lyso-PC, we hypothesize that it can modulate PLA2 in intact cells. In the present study, the effects of lyso-PC on the release of arachidonate in endothelial cells was examined. The involvement of Ca2+, PKC, and MAPK in the modulation of PLA2activity was examined.

Endothelial cells were harvested from human umbilical veins using Type I collagenase as described previously (37Jaffe E.A. Jaffe E.A. Biology of Endothelial Cells.

The cells were grown in flasks or culture dishes pretreated with 0.2% gelatin, in medium 199 (pH 7.4) supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 30 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, 90 μg/ml heparin, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1.25 μg/ml Fungizone. The cells were subcultured at a 1:3 ratio using 0.05% trypsin to free the cells from the culture ware. Near-confluent cell monolayers from the third passage were used for all experiments. Cells were radiolabeled as described previously (39Tran K. Wong J.T. Lee E. Chan A.C. Choy P.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cell monolayers grown to near-confluence in 35-mm culture dishes were incubated for 20 h with 1 μCi/ml [3H]arachidonate in medium 199 containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were washed three times with HEPES-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 5.5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mmCaCl2, and 1.0 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) containing 0.025% (w/v) essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Aliquots of lysophospholipids were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The solvent was evaporated under N2, and the lysophospholipid samples were then resuspended in HEPES-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin. The arachidonate released from cells was determined as described previously (39Tran K. Wong J.T. Lee E. Chan A.C. Choy P.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lysophospholipid was added to the cell culture and incubated for the prescribed period. The buffer was then removed and acidified with 50 μl of glacial acetic acid. A 0.8-ml aliquot was used for lipid extraction in a solvent mixture consisting of chloroform/methanol/water (4:3:2, by volume). Oleic acid was added as an internal fatty acid standard. The free fatty acid fraction in the organic phase was resolved by thin layer chromatography in a solvent system consisting of hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v). The fatty acid fraction was visualized by iodine vapor, and its radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Endothelial cells were cultured on 60-mm plates and incubated with medium 199 containing 100 nm [14C]lyso-PC (57 nCi/nmol) for 15 min. The medium was removed, and the cells were incubated for 15 min with medium 199 (control) or medium 199 containing 10 μmlyso-PC (a 100-fold excess of nonradioactive lyso-PC). The media were subsequently removed, and the cells were dislodged from the culture dish in HEPES-buffered saline. Samples were taken for protein determination or scintillation counting. Immunoblotting analysis of cPLA2 or sPLA2 was performed as described previously (39Tran K. Wong J.T. Lee E. Chan A.C. Choy P.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cell lysates containing approximately 50 μg of protein were subjected to sodium dodecylsulfate, 7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein fractions from the gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and then allowed to react with a polyclonal anti-cPLA2 antibody or with an anti-sPLA2antibody. The nitrocellulose membranes were then exposed to a goat anti-rabbit antibody that was coupled to horseradish peroxidase. The cPLA2 or sPLA2 bands were detected on film using a Western blotting detection reagent kit (from Amersham), which yields a fluorescent compound via a reaction catalyzed by the peroxidase. The antisense oligonucleotides for group II PLA2 (ASsA2, 5′-GAT CCT CTG CCA CCC ACA CC-3′) (40Barbour S.E. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21875-21882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for cPLA2 (AScA2, 5′-GTA AGG ATC TAT AAA TGA CAT-3′) (11Roshak A. Sathe G. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25999-26005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with phosphorothioate linkages were synthesized by the University Core DNA Services, University of Calgary (Alberta, Canada). Complementary sense oligomers were used as controls. Seventy-two hours prior to challenge with lyso-PC, the cells were incubated with medium containing 10 μmoligonucleotides. The cells were supplied with fresh medium containing 10 μm oligonucleotides at 24-h intervals thereafter. The presence of oligonucleotides did not affect cell viability or arachidonate labeling. Cells were lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm aprotinin, 20 mm NaF, and 10 mmNa2HPO4. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was designated as the cytosolic fraction, while the pellet was designated as the membrane fraction and resuspended in the buffer described above. PLA2 activity in the subcellular fractions was determined by the hydrolysis of 1-stearoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine to yield free radiolabeled arachidonate. The assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.9 nmol of 1-stearoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (100,000 dpm/assay), and approximately 10 μg of protein in a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reactions were terminated by the addition of 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, by volume). Total lipid was extracted, and the radioactivity of the arachidonate released was determined as described above. The amounts of protein in the samples were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (41Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ were monitored using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2 as described previously (42Liu K. Massaeli H. Pierce G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4145-4151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, monolayers grown on microscope coverslips were incubated in medium with 5 μm fura-2/AM for 30 min. Fura-2/AM is permeable to cells, and once inside the cells the compound is hydrolyzed by endogenous esterases to yield the cell-impermeable fura-2. The cells on the coverslip were transferred into a cuvette, rinsed with HEPES-buffered saline containing 0.025% bovine serum albumin, and immersed in the same buffer. Fluorescent signals were monitored on a SPEX fluorescence spectrophotometer at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm, respectively. Cells were then challenged with lyso-PC or A23187 for 10 min, and the ratio of the fluorescence at the two wavelengths was monitored as an indicator of changes in cytosolic Ca2+ levels. The isosbestic (cross-over) point of fura-2 remained constant during lyso-PC treatment. Cells were sonicated in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 0.3% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm benzamidine, 1 mmPMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × gfor 60 min to obtain the soluble and membrane fractions. Approximately 15–30 μg of protein from these fractions were used to determine PKC activity using a PKC assay kit (Amersham), which is based on the incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP into a PKC-specific substrate peptide. The data were analyzed using a two-tailed independent Student's t test. The level of statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. To determine the effect of lyso-PC on arachidonate release, human umbilical vein endothelial cells were labeled with [3H]arachidonate in medium 199 containing 10% fetal calf serum for 20 h. The cells were rinsed, and then incubated with HEPES-buffered saline containing 0.025% bovine serum albumin and 0 or 50 μm lyso-PC for various time periods (Fig.1 A). Lyso-PC elicited a time-dependent arachidonate release, which reached a maximum at 10 min of incubation, after which arachidonate release was slightly diminished. A nominal amount of bovine serum albumin was required to bind the arachidonate that is released into the buffer. The optimal concentration of lyso-PC for the induction of arachidonate release was determined at bovine serum albumin concentrations ranging from 0.025 to 0.1% (w/v) (4–16 μm albumin). The effect of lyso-PC on arachidonate release was affected by the albumin concentration (Fig. 1 B). Higher concentrations of lyso-PC was required to elicit a stimulation of arachidonate release at higher albumin concentrations. For example, at 0.025% albumin, the maximal stimulation of arachidonate release was observed at 50 μmlyso-PC. Lyso-PC at this concentration has been found to be nonlethal to endothelial cells (43Su Z. Ling Q. Guo Z.G. Cardioscience. 1995; 6: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar), and we confirmed cell viability under the incubation conditions by the exclusion of trypan blue dye. Hence, these conditions were routinely used in subsequent experiments. Initial experiments on the effect of lyso-PC on arachidonate release were performed using lyso-PC derived from egg lecithin. Since egg lysolecithin contains mainly saturated acyl species, we tested the ability of palmitoyl (C16:0)- and stearoyl (C18:0)-lyso-PC to stimulate arachidonate release. Fig. 2 shows that lyso-PC containing palmitoyl and stearoyl chains induced a high release of arachidonate. To determine if the stimulation of arachidonate release is specific to lyso-PC or if it is a property common to all lysolipids, we tested the effect of other lysophospholipids such as lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidylinositol, and lysophosphatidate on arachidonate release. As shown in Fig. 2, lysolipids with head groups other than choline were minimally effective in the stimulation of arachidonate release. Based on these results, lyso-PC containing a palmitoyl (C16:0) chain was used in subsequent experiments. Lyso-PC is an amphiphilic molecule and can incorporate into lipid membranes. Thus, we performed binding studies as described under “Experimental Procedures” to determine the nature of the association of lyso-PC with the endothelial cells. Cells were labeled with [14C]lyso-PC (100 nm, 57 nCi/nmol), followed by incubation with control medium (without lyso-PC) or medium containing 10 μm nonradioactive lyso-PC. The majority of radioactivity remained associated with cells in the presence of excess lyso-PC (results not shown), indicating that the association of lyso-PC with cells is mainly nonspecific. To determine whether the release of arachidonate is mediated by PLA2, we examined the effects of the PLA2 inhibitors para-bromophenacyl bromide (pBPB) and arachidonoyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3), the latter of which specifically inhibits the cPLA2 (44Street I.P. Lin H.K. Laliberté F. Ghomashchi F. Wang Z. Perrier H. Tremblay N.M. Huang Z. Weech P.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5935-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). As shown in TableI, arachidonate release was significantly inhibited in those cells that were preincubated with these inhibitors prior to challenge with lyso-PC. The inhibition of arachidonate release by up to 62% by AACOCF3 indicates that the cPLA2 may be involved in the arachidonate release induced by lyso-PC. However, sPLA2 is also present in endothelial cells and may also participate in arachidonate release (10Murakami M. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 839-844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IInhibition of lyso-PC-induced arachidonate release by PLA 2inhibitorsTreatmentArachidonate releaseInhibitiondpm × 10−3/dish%Control5.98 ± 0.4050 μm lyso-PC31.08 ± 2.35AACOCF3 + lyso-PC 1 μm19.11 ± 0.601-ap < 0.05.39 25 μm11.93 ± 1.551-ap < 0.05.62pBPB + lyso-PC 5 μm22.09 ± 1.791-ap < 0.05.29 25 μm16.44 ± 2.611-ap < 0.05.471-a p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab To further delineate the type of PLA2 that was involved in the lyso-PC-induced arachidonate release, we used antisense oligonucleotides toward cPLA2 and sPLA2. These oligonucleotides were designed to bind specifically to the respective mRNAs and prevent the translation and synthesis of the enzyme protein (11Roshak A. Sathe G. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25999-26005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Barbour S.E. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21875-21882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complementary sense oligonucleotides were used as negative controls. Cells were grown in the presence of sense or antisense oligonucleotides to either PLA2 isoform for 3 days prior to challenge with lyso-PC. Treatment of the cells with either sense or antisense oligonucleotides did not alter the total incorporation of [3H]arachidonate. However, lyso-PC-induced arachidonate release was significantly attenuated in cells grown in the presence of antisense oligonucleotides for cPLA2, compared with cells grown without oligonucleotides or with sense oligonucleotides (Fig. 3). The level of cPLA2 protein after the treatment with antisense cPLA2 oligonucleotides was determined by immunoblotting analysis with a polyclonal antibody for cPLA2. The level of cPLA2 protein was decreased (40% reduction) by the antisense oligonucleotide treatment (Fig.4 A). In cells treated with antisense sPLA2 oligonucleotides, the lyso-PC-induced arachidonate release was not significantly affected (Fig. 3), despite a 35% decrease in the sPLA2 protein level in those cells (Fig. 4 B).Figure 4Immunoblots of cPLA2 and sPLA2 in cells grown in the presence of sense or antisense oligonucleotides to cPLA2.

Upon manganese stimulation, a β1 epitope defined by monoclonal antibody (mAb) 9EG7 was induced strongly (on α4β1), moderately (on α5β1), weakly (on α2β1), or was scarcely detectable (on α6β1 and α3β1). Comparable results were seen for the β1 epitope defined by mAb 15/7. Likewise, soluble ligands caused strong (α4β1), moderate (α5β1), weak (α2β1, α6β1), or minimal (α3β1) induction of the 9EG7 epitope. Exchange or deletion of α chain cytoplasmic tails did not alter Mn2+-induced 9EG7 epitope levels. Upon removal of calcium by EGTA or EDTA, the hierarchy of 9EG7 epitope induction was similar (α5β1 > α2β1 > α6β1 > α3β1), except that EGTA reduced rather than induced 9EG7 expression on α4β1. Thus in contrast to other β1 integrins, calcium uniquely supports constitutive expression of the 9EG7 epitope on α4β1. Likewise, calcium supported vascular cell adhesion molecule-stimulated 9EG7 appearance on α4β1, whereas calcium inhibited ligand-induced 9EG7 epitope on other integrins. Constitutive expression of 9EG7 on α4β1 was eliminated by a D698E mutation in α4, suggesting that Asp-698 may play a key role in maintaining atypical α4β1 response to calcium. In conclusion, our results (i) demonstrate that mAb such as 9EG7 and 15/7 have limited diagnostic utility as reporters of ligand or Mn2+ occupancy for β1 integrins, (ii) indicate pronounced differences in conformational flexibilities (α4β1 > α5β1> α2β1 > α6β1> α3β1), (iii) allow us to hypothesize that β1 integrins may differ markedly in conformation-dependent inside-out signaling, and (iv) have uncovered an atypical α4β1 response to calcium that requires α4 Asp-698.

Cell adhesion mediated by cell-surface receptors in the integrin family regulates a host of cellular events including cell migration, spreading, proliferation, apoptosis, and gene induction (1Hynes R.O.

By inside-out signaling, many cellular agonists “activate” integrins, i.e. they trigger increased ligand binding and cell adhesion capability. In some cases, “activation” of these integrins is accompanied by changes in their affinity for ligands and/or for ligand mimetic monoclonal antibodies (5Ginsberg M.H. Du X. Plow E.F. Curr. Opin.

Sci. 1997; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Because epitopes recognized by mAb 9EG7 and 15/7 are induced upon ligand occupancy of α4β1 and α5β1, it has been widely assumed that these epitopes would be diagnostic for ligand occupancy of all β1 integrins. Here we show a wide variation in CLIBS epitope induction on different β1integrins, indicating that CLIBS epitopes are not useful for determining the extent of Mn2+ or ligand binding for several β1 integrins. However, our CLIBS epitope results do suggest that β1 integrins differ widely in the extent to which α-β chain unfolding accompanies occupancy by ligand or Mn2+.

K562 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected by electroporation with α2, α3, or α4 cDNA in the pFneo vector or with α6cDNA in the pRc/CMV vector as described previously (36Mannion B.A. Berditchevski F.

Cells were sequentially washed with phosphate-buffered saline and Tris-buffered saline (24 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl) and resuspended with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% sodium azide. Cells were then incubated with agonists (MnCl2, ligands, EDTA, or EGTA) for 15–30 min at 37 °C. Aliquots of 2 × 105 cells were then incubated for 45 min on ice with 9EG7 or other primary antibodies (2 μg/ml). Cells were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% sodium azide and incubated for 45 min on ice with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rat IgG (Sigma). At least 3000 cells were then analyzed using a FACScan machine (Becton Dickinson, Oxnard, CA) to obtain mean fluorescence intensity values. To calculate percentages of α2β1, α3β1, α4β1, and α6β1bearing the 9EG7 epitope in K562 cells, we solved for 9EG7% of αz according to Equation 1. 9EG7total=(9EG7%ofαZ)(αZ)+(9EG7%ofα5)(α5)Equation 1 To obtain the percentage of α5β1expressing 9EG7 (9EG 7% of α5), we determined 9EG7 levels relative to total β1 (measured using mAb 13) in a cell line (K562) that only expresses α5β1. αZ represents the mean fluorescence intensity value for α2, α3, α4, or α6 in each K562 transfectant. Levels of 9EG7 were measured after the addition of MnCl2, ligands, EDTA, or EGTA. However, levels of each α chain and total β1 were determined using saturating amounts of the appropriate antibodies, added to cells untreated with any ligands, chelators, or divalent cations. In the transfectants, expression of αZ was typically 3–5-fold greater than α5 and was always at least 2-fold greater. Cloning of human α2 (38Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J.

Hemler M.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2039-2047PubMed Google Scholar), have been previously described. Construction of chimeric X2C3 was carried out by overlap extension (41Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). Two segments were generated in separate PCR reactions, each containing one set of outer and inner primers and either α2 or α3cDNA. For α2 cDNA we used the oligonucleotide primers 5′-CAG-TTG-TAA-TGC-AGA-TAT-CAA-TCC-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 3099–3122 of α2 and containing the underlined EcoRV restriction site) and 5′-GAA-GCC-GCA-CTT-CCA-TAA-AAT-TGC-AAC-3′ (corresponding to a cohesive end for nucleotides 3127–3119 of α3 and 3513–3496 of α2). For α3 cDNA we used the primers 5′-GCA-ATT-TTA-TGG-AAG-TGC-GGC-TTC-TTC-3′ (corresponding to a cohesive end for nucleotides 3499–3507 of α2 and 3113–3130 of α3) and 5′-GGT-CTA-GAA-GTC-ACA-CCA-GGT-GGG-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 3270–3252 of α3 and introducing an XbaI site). A second PCR reaction was performed using these two segments and the two outer primers. The resulting α2/α3 chimeric product was digested with EcoRV and XbaI, ligated to α2 cDNA, and finally cloned in pFneo (42Hahn W.C. Menzin E. Saito T. Germain R.N. Bierer B.E. Gene (Amst .). 1993; 127: 267-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The X2C6 was prepared similarly by overlap extension PCR, starting with an α2 cDNA clone (38Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and α6 cDNA from reverse transcriptase-PCR of mRNA from HT1080 cells. To make the X3C0 construct, the α3 subunit cytoplasmic domain was truncated just after the GFFKR sequence by creating a termination codon at position 3130 of α3 cDNA. The stop codon (underlined) was introduced into the antisense primer 5′-G-AGT-GCG-GGC-TCA-TCG-CTT-GAA-GAA-GCC-GC-3′ corresponding to nucleotides 3146–3120. The upstream primer (5′-GC-AGG-CGC-CGA-CAG-CTG-GAT-CCA-GGG-3′) corresponds to nucleotides 2688–2713. The resulting PCR product was inserted into full-length α3 cDNA in the pFneo vector. The construction of α4 mutants D408E, N283E, D346E, D489E, D698E, D811E, and the combined D489E/D698E/D811E mutant (LEV) have been detailed elsewhere (43Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 44Ma L. Conrad P.J. Webb D.L. Blue M.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18401-18407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In K562 cells, Mn2+ induces the 9EG7 epitope on the β1subunit of the α5β1 integrin (6Bazzoni G. Shih D.-T. Buck C.A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25570-25577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To evaluate 9EG7 epitope expression on other β1 integrins, we compared K562 cells (which express only α5β1) with K562-α2, K562-α3, and K562-α4 transfectants. In the absence of added divalent cations, relatively low levels of the 9EG7 epitope were detected in K562-α2, K562-α3, or K562 cells (Fig. 1 A, left panels), whereas moderate constitutive levels were seen in K562-α4 cells. However, in the presence of 5 mm Mn2+, the 9EG7 epitope was increased greatly on K562-α4 cells, moderately on K562 and K562-α2 cells, but hardly at all on K562-α3cells. A Mn2+-induced conformational change was also detected using mAb 15/7, and again it was most obvious for K562-α4 cells, less obvious for K562 and K562-α2 cells, and not at all obvious for K562-α3 cells (Fig. 1 B). For K562-α2, K562-α3, and K562-α4 transfectants analyzed in Fig. 1, induction of the 9EG7 and 15/7 epitopes is partly due to a small contribution of endogenous α5β1. Therefore, to obtain a more precise assessment of epitope induction on individual β1 integrins in transfected cells, we subtracted the contribution of endogenous α5β1 in subsequent experiments. A more detailed analysis revealed that stimulation of the 9EG7 epitope by Mn2+ (up to 10 mm) was dose-dependent, and at all concentrations tested, induction was highest for α4β1, intermediate for α5β1, low for α2β1, and essentially undetectable on α6β1 or α3β1(Fig. 2 A). A very similar hierarchy of Mn2+-dependent 9EG7 expression was found upon comparing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that constitutively express α5β1 with CHO-α2, -α3, and -α4transfectants (not shown). Although Mn2+ stimulated little or no 9EG7 epitope expression on α2β1, α6β1, and α3β1, the cation did efficiently stimulate cell adhesion mediated by these integrins. For example, adhesion of K562-α3 cells to a laminin-5 containing matrix (made by A431 cells) was dose-dependently induced by Mn2+, with maximal stimulation at ≥0.1 mm (Fig. 2 B). Also, Mn2+ (1 mm) strongly stimulated adhesion of K562-α3 cells, but not control K562 cells, to purified laminin-5 (Fig. 2 B). Elsewhere, 1 mmMn2+ stimulated a >22-fold increase in affinity of purified soluble α3β1 for laminin-5. 3J. A. Eble, K. W. Wucherpfennig, L. Gauthier, P. Dersch, E. Krukonis, R. R. Isberg, and M. E. Hemler, submitted for publication. In other experiments 0.1–1 mm Mn2+ stimulated to a similar extent K562-α2 cell adhesion to collagen, K562-α4 adhesion to VCAM-1, K562-α6adhesion to laminin-1, and untransfected K562 cell adhesion to fibronectin (not shown). Thus, failure to induce the 9EG7 epitope (Fig.2 A) is not due to lack of integrin responsiveness to Mn2+. Immunoprecipitation results also showed preferential recognition of specific Mn2+-treated αβ1 combinations by mAb 9EG7. Previously it was shown that 9EG7 immunoprecipitated a major fraction of α4β1 from a Mn2+-treated lysate (23Lenter M. Uhlig H. Hamann A. Jeno P. Imhof B. Vestweber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9051-9055Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In the presence of 1 mm Mn2+, the 9EG7 mAb precipitated a moderate amount (∼10% of total α5β1 available) of α5β1 from a lysate of125I-labeled K562 cells (not shown). In sharp contrast, the 9EG7 mAb precipitated little if any α3β1from K562-α3 cell lysate in 1 mmMn2+ (not shown). Exchange of integrin α chain cytoplasmic domains may alter integrin function and presumably also conformation (46O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R.N. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that variable induction of 9EG7 might be due to variations among α chain cytoplasmic domains. However, exchange of the integrin α2 cytoplasmic domain with the α3 or α6 tail did not cause 9EG7 expression to decrease (see K562-X2C3 and K562-X2C6 in TableI, top). Conversely, exchange with the α4 or α5 tails (K562-X2C4 and -X2C5) did not cause a marked increase in 9EG7 epitope expression. Similarly, deletion of the α3 tail (K562-X3C0) did not prevent the 9EG7 epitope on α3β1 from being largely unresponsive to Mn2+ (Table I, bottom).Table I9EG7 expression is not markedly influenced by α chain cytoplasmic domainsCell1-aX2C3, X2C4, X2C5, and X2C6 are chimeric molecules composed of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of α2(X2) and the cytoplasmic domains (C) of α3, α4, α5, and α6, respectively.

Shih D.-T. Buck C.A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25570-25577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), thus providing an opportunity for further comparisons among β1 integrins. In the presence of 5 mmMg2+, which by itself has no effect on 9EG7 expression, CS1 peptide (DELPQLVTLPHPNLHGPEILDVPST, not shown) or VCAM-1 (Fig.3) induced a high level of 9EG7 on α4β1. Similarly, fibronectin induced a moderate level of 9EG7 on α5β1, and collagen I induced a low 9EG7 level on α2β1. However, soluble laminin-1 and laminin-5 induced little, if any, 9EG7 epitope on α6β1 and α3β1, respectively (Fig. 3). Also, the GD6 laminin peptide (at 0.5 mg/ml) that was described as a ligand for α3β1(47Gehlsen K.R. Sriramarao P. Furcht L.T. Skubitz A.P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) induced no 9EG7 expression on K562-α3 cells (not shown). In control experiments, mock-transfected K562 cells showed no induction of 9EG7 in response to maximal doses of soluble VCAM-1, collagen I, laminin-1, or laminin-5 (not shown). Failure to induce 9EG7 on α6β1 or α3β1 was not due to inactivity of the respective integrins. Under experimental conditions similar to those used in Fig. 3 (i.e. 5 mm Mg2+, 2 μg/ml 9EG7), K562-α6 and K562-α3 cells displayed strong cell adhesion to laminin-1 and laminin-5, respectively (not shown). This adhesion was specifically mediated by α6β1 or α3β1since it was not seen in control K562 cells (not shown). Furthermore, we show elsewhere that α3β1 binds to laminin-5 in the presence of mAb 9EG7, with a Kd of ∼0.088 μm.3 Thus at 0.3 μmlaminin-5 (as used in Fig. 3), the majority of α3β1 should be occupied by ligand. As an extension of results showing 9EG7 induction by Mn2+(Fig. 2 A) or by ligand (Fig. 3), we next analyzed effects of Mn2+ and ligand (at 0.3 μm) added together. Stimulation of 9EG7 was already maximal (near 60%) when 0.3 μm VCAM-1 was added to K562-α4 cells in the presence of 0.05 mm Mn2+ (Fig.4). In comparison, a 20-fold greater level of Mn2+ (1.0 mm) was required to support comparable levels of 9EG7 (50–60%) on α5β1, α2β1, and α6β1 when stimulated with 0.3 μm fibronectin, collagen, or laminin-1, respectively. In contrast, α3β1 still showed minimal 9EG7 expression even in the presence of 1.0 mm Mn2+plus 0.3 μm laminin-5. To summarize, results of 9EG7 induction by Mn2+ (Fig. 2 A), ligand (Fig. 3), or both together (Fig. 4) show a generally consistent hierarchy among the different β1 integrins. Major differences in 9EG7 expression among β1 integrins were also observed upon incubation with EDTA or EGTA. Consistent with previous results (6Bazzoni G. Shih D.-T. Buck C.A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25570-25577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), 9EG7 expression was moderately induced on α5β1 by EDTA (Fig.5 A) or EGTA (Fig.5 B). In comparison, the 9EG7 epitope was induced to a lower extent on α2β1 and hardly at all on α6β1 and α3β1(Fig. 5, A and B). On α4β1, the 9EG7 epitope was diminished, rather than induced, upon the removal of divalent cations. For all integrins tested, similar effects were seen with EDTA and EGTA (Fig. 5, A and B), indicating that calcium, rather than magnesium or other divalent cations, is playing a key regulatory role. Consistent with results in Figs.2 and 5 B, α5β1 in K562 cells showed a moderate increase in the 9EG7 epitope upon Mn2+ or EGTA stimulation (Fig. 6 A). Also, α4β1 in Molt-4 cells showed a much stronger response to Mn2+ but showed a decrease rather than increase in response to EGTA (Fig. 6 C). These results confirm for α4β1 in Molt-4 cells (where it is the only integrin) the results seen for α4β1 in K562-α4 cells (Figs.2 and 5 B) where it is expressed together with α5β1. Shown in Fig. 6 B is the cumulative 9EG7 expression for both α5β1and α4β1 in K562-α4 cells. Notably, no net effect of EGTA is seen, presumably because positive effects on α5β1 are balanced by negative effects on α4β1. However, subtraction of the α5β1 contribution (Fig. 6 D), based on results seen with the K562 reference cells (Fig.6 A), reveals the specific contribution of α4β1 (Fig. 6 E). Notably, the results for α4βl in Fig. 6 E(after calculation) are very similar to the results in Fig.6 C (where no calculations are necessary). Together, these results not only confirm the unique sensitivity of α4β1 to EGTA but help to validate the method utilized for subtraction of background contributions due to α5β1 in the various K562 transfectants. To highlight further the unique properties of α4β1, we compared the effects of Ca2+ on ligand-induced 9EG7 expression for the various integrins. Calcium markedly inhibited the expression of 9E"
https://openalex.org/W1986578326,"The human estrogen receptor (ER) contains two major activation functions (AFs) responsible for its transcriptional activity. One of these, activation function 2 (AF-2), located within the hormone-binding domain (HBD), has been shown to mediate the ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of ER as well as other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Recently, proteins interacting with the HBD of several nuclear receptors have been cloned. One of these proteins, glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein (GRIP-1), has been shown to interact with ER and was originally hypothesized to mediate its transcriptional activity through AF-2. However, we find in this study that the transcriptional activity of ER, containing mutations in the AF-2 core sequence, can be enhanced by coexpression of the coactivator GRIP-1, suggesting that this protein may not rely solely on the AF-2 domain for interaction. We propose, therefore, that the HBD of ER either contains multiple binding sites that are necessary for association with GRIP-1 or, alternatively, that this coactivator contacts the receptor in an undetermined region within the HBD. Importantly, these studies demonstrate also that mutations or deletion of AF-2 alter the ligand pharmacology of the receptor such that ER loses the ability to discriminate between agonists and antagonists. Interestingly, on these mutant receptors GRIP-1 still functions as a coactivator independent of the nature of the bound ligand. It is likely, therefore, that the C-terminal AF-2 domain may function as a molecular switch allowing the wild-type receptor to discriminate between agonists and antagonists as well as providing a surface with which associated proteins can interact.

Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6276) Google Scholar). Among its members are the receptors for steroid hormones, retinoic acid, vitamin D, thyroid hormone (T3), and a group of orphan receptors for which ligands have yet to be identified (2Mangelsdorf D.J.

The classical models of the ER signal transduction pathway involves binding of the steroidal ligand estradiol to the receptor followed by a conformational change in receptor structure (4McDonnell D.P.

This event facilitates the dissociation of the receptor from an inhibitory multi-protein complex composed of HSP90, HSP70, p59, and possibly other factors (6Smith D.F. Toft D.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Once released from the inhibitory complex, the receptor forms homodimers (7Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) and subsequently binds DNA elements called estrogen response elements (EREs) located within the regulatory regions of target genes (8Klein-Hitpass L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 647-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which the DNA-bound receptor alters gene transcription has yet to be elucidated. In addition to this well characterized pathway, ER has also been shown to modulate transcription in an ERE-independent manner presumably through its association with other DNA bound factors (10Webb P.

Although the mechanism by which ER regulates gene transcription is unknown, the domains responsible for its transcriptional activity have been well characterized. The major activation functions, AF-1 and AF-2, are located within the N and C termini, respectively (14Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 15Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). A third activation function, AF2a, located within the receptor HBD has also recently been identified (16Pierrat B. Heery D.M. Chambon P. Losson R. Gene (Amst .). 1994; 143: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Norris J.D. Fan D. Kerner S.A. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It has been shown that in some cell contexts that AF-1 and AF-2 function independently of each other, whereas in others, full transcriptional activity requires both activation domains (15Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 18Tzukerman M.T. Esty A. Santiso-Mere D. Danielian P.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1043-1050PubMed Google Scholar). Functionally, these AFs differ in that AF-2 is located within the ligand-binding domain of ER and requires ligand to manifest its activity. ER antagonists are thought to function by inhibiting the activity of AF-2. Unlike AF-2, AF-1 is a constitutive activator, and in contexts where AF-1 alone is required for transcriptional activity, ER antagonists like tamoxifen manifest partial agonist activity (14Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 18Tzukerman M.T. Esty A. Santiso-Mere D. Danielian P. Parker M.G. Stein R.B. Pike J.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that cellular factors that interact with either AF-1 or AF-2 are important determinants of the pharmacology of ER ligands. Lately, considerable progress has been made in understanding how ligands influence the activity of the AF-2 domain within the nuclear receptors. Of particular importance in this regard was the resolution of the crystal structures of RXRα (20Bouguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), RARγ (21Renaud J. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D.

Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2900) Google Scholar). These studies reveal that the ligand-binding domain of the nuclear receptors share a common structural motif which is composed of 11 to 12 individual α helices with helix 2 being absent in some members of the superfamily (24Wurtz J. Bourguet W. Renaud J. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Of particular interest was the observation that the most carboxyl region, helix 12, containing the sequence thought to be responsible for AF-2 activity, was shown to realign over the ligand-binding pocket when associated with agonists. This observation confirmed previous biochemical studies that predicted major structural alterations within this region upon binding hormone (4McDonnell D.P. Clemm D.L. Hermann T. Goldman M.E.

Taken together, these studies suggest that these agonist-induced alterations in ER structure permit the formation of a surface with which ER interacts with the general transcription machinery. To date, several factors interacting with the HBD of the nuclear receptors have been identified. Among these are several isotypes of SRC-1 (27Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M. O'Malley B.W.

Interestingly, in vitro interaction studies determined that a region containing helix 12 appeared to be required for interaction with several of these proteins (30Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Zechel C.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2735-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The link between helix 12, AF-2, and the ability of coactivators to bind the nuclear receptors was established when it was demonstrated that mutations which were known to abolish AF-2 transcriptional activity were also shown to abolish the interaction of the nuclear receptors with several of their associated proteins (30Voegel J.J.

Since it was determined that antagonists differentially affect HBD structure, it was proposed that the resultant conformation was unable to engage the cofactors required for transcriptional activity. The inability of the coactivator proteins to engage the nuclear receptors in the presence of antagonists supports this hypothesis (27Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar, 31vom Baur E. Zechel C. Heery D. Heine M.J.S. Garnier J.M. Vivat V. Douarin B.L. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R.

In this study, we analyzed the relative contribution of the different transcriptional domains of ER in mediating the activities of the coactivator GRIP-1. We show in yeast and in mammalian cells that activation of the estrogen receptor by GRIP-1 can occur in the absence of a functional AF-2. This would suggest that GRIP-1 interacts with the receptor in an unidentified region of the HBD and that perhaps this domain contains several surfaces with which receptor-associated proteins can interact. We also find that unlike the wild-type receptor, which upon binding ER antagonists fails to engage GRIP-1, the transcriptional activity of the AF-2 mutant receptors in the presence of several different classes of ER ligands is enhanced by overexpression of this coactivator. This suggests that it is the contribution of the AF-2 region to receptor structure, rather than its ability to manifest independent transcriptional activity, that is important in determining the agonist/antagonist character of ER ligands.

Mammalian expression vectors for ER and ER mutants (ER-wt, ER179C, ER-TAF1, and ER-Null) were also described previously (18Tzukerman M.T. Esty A. Santiso-Mere D. Danielian P. Parker M.G. Stein R.B. Pike J.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). All products of polymerase chain reaction-based cloning were sequenced to ensure the fidelity of the resultant construct. The transcriptional activities of ER, and ER mutants, were assayed on the ERE-CYC1-β-galactosidase reporter gene as described previously (43Dana S.L. Hoener P.A. Wheeler D.A. Lawrence C.B. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1193-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast strain YPH500 (Mat a ura3-52, lys2-801, ade2-101, trp1Δ63, his3Δ200 leu2Δ1) was transformed with pGRIP1/fl (38Hong H. Kohli K. Garabedian M.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2735-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) or the empty expression vector pGAD424 along with the wtER or ER mutant expression plasmids. Resultant transformants were grown to OD 0.8 and incubated with media supplemented with copper and increasing concentrations of estradiol. After a 4-h incubation with hormone, the yeast cell wall was lysed using a buffer consisting of 0.1% SDS and the enzyme oxylyticase. Extracts were then analyzed for β-galactosidase activity using the substrate o-nitrophenyl-β-d-pyranoside. HepG2 and HeLa cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium (MEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were plated in 24-well plates (coated with gelatin for transfections of HepG2 cells) 24 h prior to transfection. DNA was introduced into the cells using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (44Norris J. Fan D. Aleman C. Marks J.R. Futreal P.A. Wiseman R.W. Iglehart J.D. Deininger P.L. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22777-22782Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Typically, 1500 ng of reporter, 1000 ng of receptor, 500 ng of coactivator, and 20 ng of normalization vector were used for each transfection performed in triplicate. Cells were incubated with the DNA/Lipofectin mixture either 2 or 3 h for transfections of HeLa and HepG2 cells, respectively. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with the indicated hormone diluted in phenol red-free modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) 24 h prior to harvesting. pCMV-βgal (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), containing the bacterial lacZ gene expressed from the SV40 early promoter, was also introduced into the cells and used as an internal control to account for transfection efficiency. After harvesting, cells were assayed for β-galactosidase and luciferase activity as described previously (44Norris J. Fan D. Aleman C. Marks J.R. Futreal P.A. Wiseman R.W. Iglehart J.D. Deininger P.L. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22777-22782Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-downs with GST-GRIP1 fusion protein and ER proteins were performed essentially as described (29Hong H. Kohli K. Trivedi A. Johnson D.L. Stallcup M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4948-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled ER or ER mutant were synthesized using in vitro transcription and translation from the cognate mammalian expression vectors described above. The resultant labeled proteins were incubated with Sepharose beads containing GST-GRIP-1 and eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blots were prepared from nuclear extracts isolated from HeLa cells transfected with wtER alone or in combination with GRIP-1. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (45Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffer W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). 15 μg of total protein was denatured in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with monoclonal antibody H222 (provided by Geoffrey Greene, Ben May Institute, Chicago). Complexes were detected using ECL following the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Corp.). GRIP-1 was originally cloned using the yeast two-hybrid system as a factor that associates with the HBD of the glucocorticoid receptor. This protein was subsequently shown to interact with and enhance the transcriptional activity of a DBDGAL4-mouse ER HBD fusion protein in yeast (38Hong H. Kohli K. Garabedian M.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2735-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). We previously developed a set of human ER mutants that contained functional AF-1 or AF-2 disruptions, and in this study investigated the transcriptional activity of these AF-selective mutants when coexpressed with the coactivator GRIP-1 in a reconstituted ER-responsive transcription assay in yeast. Yeast were chosen for this initial set of experiments because they do not appear to have any homologues of the recently identified receptor coactivators. Description of the specific ER-AF mutants is detailed in Fig. 1. Yeast were transformed with expression vectors for either wild-type estrogen receptor (wtER), ER-AF-2 (YEPE28), or ER-AF-1 (YEP3X) and a reporter plasmid containing an estrogen response element inserted upstream of the CYC1 promoter expressing the bacterial lacZ gene (YRPE2). The results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 2. As expected, the transcriptional activity of wtER was induced by increasing concentrations of the cognate ligand estradiol, and this activity was potentiated further by the addition of GRIP-1 (Fig.2 A). The maximal relative increase in transcriptional activity occurred at 0.1 nm where the coexpression of GRIP-1 resulted in a 17-fold enhancement of ER-dependent transcriptional activity. The transcriptional activity of the AF-2 mutant which contains amino acids 179–595 of the receptor and thus lacks the N-terminal AF-1 domain was also potentiated by the coaddition of GRIP-1 with a maximal fold induction of approximately 18 observed (Fig. 2 B). Surprisingly, the transcriptional activity of a functional AF-2 knock-out, containing point mutations in helix 12, was also potentiated by the coactivator GRIP-1 (Fig. 2 C). This finding was unexpected due to the fact that several reports have shown previously that coactivator binding and transcriptional enhancement is dependent on a functional AF-2 (30Voegel J.J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2735-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the potency of estradiol-mediated transcription in the presence of GRIP-1 was increased in both the wild-type and mutant receptors as indicated by the leftward shift in the dose-response curve (Fig. 2, A–C). Compare the EC50 of wtER minus GRIP-1 at 0.5 nm with wtER plus GRIP-1 at 0.1 nm. Mutant receptors demonstrated a similar increase in potency when assayed in the presence of GRIP-1. These results suggest that the relative expression of receptor coactivators influences the efficacy of ER ligands and, in addition, indicate that a functional AF-2 is not required for coactivation by GRIP-1 in yeast.Figure 2GRIP-1 enhances the transcriptional activity of both the wild-type estrogen receptor and estrogen receptor mutants in yeast. A, the yeast strain YPH500 was transformed with an expression vector for the wild-type estrogen receptor along with a reporter construct containing two estrogen response elements inserted upstream of the CYC-1 promoter allowing inducible expression of the bacterial β-galactosidase gene (YRPE2). In addition, vectors expressing either full-length GRIP-1 (pGRIP1/fl) or no protein (pGAD424) were also transformed into yeast. Cells were induced with increasing concentrations of estradiol as indicated in the figure, and transcriptional activity was measured by assaying β-galactosidase activity. B, same as above except that the estrogen receptor AF-2 (YEPE28) was assessed. C, same as above except that the estrogen receptor AF-1 (YEP3X) was assessed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although yeast have proven to be a valuable tool in the dissection of the molecular mechanism of action of nuclear steroid receptors, they presumably contain no proteins homologous to the recently identified coactivators. Therefore, we felt it was necessary to extend our analysis to mammalian cells where these proteins are expressed in most if not all tissues (27Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar, 38Hong H. Kohli K. Garabedian M.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2735-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). We chose to perform this analysis in two distinct cell lines, the hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2 (Fig.3 A) and the human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa (Fig. 3 B). These cell lines were chosen because we have previously shown that the known AFs operate differently in these cell types (18Tzukerman M.T. Esty A. Santiso-Mere D. Danielian P. Parker M.G. Stein R.B. Pike J.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). AF-1 appears to be the dominant AF in HepG2 cells, whereas both AFs are required for full transcriptional activity in HeLa cells. Cells were transfected with expression vectors for either wtER, ER-AF-1 (ER TAF-1), ER-AF-2 (ER-179C), or ER-Null mutant receptors and the estrogen-responsive C3 promoter fused to the firefly luciferase reporter gene. As expected, the transcriptional activity of wtER was enhanced in the presence of estradiol in both cell lines. Further enhancement was observed when GRIP-1 was coexpressed in the cell (3-fold) although the enhancement was considerably lower than that found in yeast. Western immunoblot analysis revealed that there was no increase in ER protein levels when exogenous GRIP-1 was cotransfected (Fig. 3 C). This demonstrates that the enhancement of ER transcriptional activity is not simply due to increased receptor levels. Interestingly, in the absence of hormone, ER transcriptional activity was slightly increased by the coaddition of GRIP-1. This appears to be the result of enhancement of unliganded ER rather than a nonspecific elevation of transcription from the C3 promoter since this activity is totally blocked by ICI182,780, an antagonist which prevents both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent transcriptional activity.

KvLQT1 is also responsible for the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen cardioauditory syndrome in which prolonged cardiac repolarization is associated with bilateral congenital deafness (2Neyroud N. Tesson F. Denjoy I. Leibovici M. Donger C. Barhanin J. Fauré S. Gary F. Coumel P. Petit C. Schwartz K. Guicheney P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). In a recent study, the KvLQT1 gene was found to encompass chromosomal rearrangements associated with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome which causes prenatal overgrowth and cancer (3Lee M.P. Hu R.J. Johnson L.A. Feinberg A.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Thus, the same gene at locus 11p15.5 could be implicated in at least three distinct genetic disease entities. The KvLQT1 gene product is a six-transmembrane domain protein which, in association with a membranous regulator termed IsK (previously known as minK), produces a K+ current with physiological characteristics similar to those of the major component of the delayed rectifier sustained K+ current in cardiac myocytes (4Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar, 5Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Spector P.S. Zou A. Shen J. Atkinson D. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). KvLQT1 expression is not limited to the heart muscle but can also be observed in human pancreas, lung, kidney, inner ear, and placenta (4Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar, 5Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Spector P.S. Zou A. Shen J. Atkinson D. Keating M.T.

EMBO J. 1997; 17: 5472-5479Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In autosomal dominant long QT syndrome 1, mutations in KvLQT1 supposedly decrease the amount of K+ current available for repolarization, thereby prolonging the cardiac action potential and inducing arrhythmias. In the recessively inherited Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, bi-allelic mutations in KvLQT1 (2Neyroud N. Tesson F. Denjoy I. Leibovici M. Donger C. Barhanin J. Fauré S. Gary F. Coumel P. Petit C. Schwartz K. Guicheney P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar) not only alter cardiac electrophysiology but also inner ear endolymph homeostasis, leading to congenital deafness. In the present work, we have cloned an N-terminal truncated isoform of the KvLQT1 gene product corresponding to KvLQT1 isoform 2 simultaneously identified by Lee et al. (3Lee M.P. Hu R.J. Johnson L.A. Feinberg A.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and Yang et al. (7Yang W.P. Levesque P.C. Little W.A. Lee Conder M. Shalaby F.Y. Blanar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4017-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It was determined that KvLQT1 isoform 2, which is constitutively expressed in adult heart muscle, is a strong dominant negative of KvLQT1 isoform 1. Our results demonstrate that the cardiac K+ channel responsible for the long QT syndrome 1 is a complex protein assembly composed of isoform 1 (the channel pore), isoform 2 (a dominant negative), and IsK (the channel regulator). These findings could have important physiopathological implications. To obtain the 5′ sequence of KvLQT1, a rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) 1The abbreviations used are: RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; bp, base pair(s); RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. experiment was performed using a Marathon cDNA Amplification kit and Marathon ready cDNA from human adult heart (CLONTECH). Two nested primers (LQTN1, 5′ GAT GTA CAG GGT GGT TAT CAG C 3′; and LQTN2, 5′ TGA GGT CGA TGA TGG AAA TGG G 3′) were derived from the previously published partial KvLQT1 sequence (1Wang Q. Curran M.E. Splawski I. Burn T.C. Millholland J.M. VanRaay T.J. Shen J. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. De Jager T. Schwartz P.J. Towbin J.A. Moss A.J. Atkinson D.L. Landes G.M. Connors T.D. Keating M.T. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar), and RACE was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The fragment of 320 bp obtained was cloned in pUC 18 using the Sure Clone Ligation kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Sequencing reactions were subsequently performed on two independent clones using the dideoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing reaction products were analyzed on 4.0% polyacrylamide gels using an ABI-377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The sequence of both clones was identical, revealing a start codon 6 bp upstream from the previously published sequence (1Wang Q. Curran M.E. Splawski I. Burn T.C. Millholland J.M. VanRaay T.J. Shen J. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. De Jager T. Schwartz P.J. Towbin J.A. Moss A.J. Atkinson D.L. Landes G.M. Connors T.D. Keating M.T. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). Human heart RNA was prepared using left or right ventricular tissues from the explanted heart of a patient with cystic fibrosis. Right atrial appendage biopsies were also obtained during open heart surgery from six patients with coronary heart disease. Tissue samples were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and total RNA was then isolated separately from each sample using the classical guanidinium isothiocyanate method (8Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63231) Google Scholar). RNA samples were quantified by spectrophotometric analysis. The lack of degradation of RNA samples was monitored by the observation of appropriate 28 S to 18 S ribosomal RNA ratios as determined by ethidium bromide staining of the agarose gel. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) were performed on total RNA. cDNA was synthesized from approximately 1 μg of RNA. RT-PCR reactions contained 5 mmMgCl2, 1× PCR Buffer II, 1 mm dNTP, 1 unit/μl RNase inhibitor, 2.5 units/μl murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Perkin-Elmer), and 0.75 μm primers in a final volume of 20 μl. Controls without reverse transcriptase were performed to check that amplification did not proceed from residual genomic DNA. cDNA was used for PCR reactions with 2 mmMgCl2, 1× PCR Buffer II, 2.5 units/100 μl AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), and 0.5 μm primers (Genosys) in a final volume of 100 μl. PCR reactions were performed as follows with a Peltier Thermal Cycler (PTC-200; MJ Research). cDNA was heated to 95 °C for 105 s and then amplified by 40 cycles (95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s) before primer extension at 72 °C for 7 min. Ten microliters of each PCR product were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose NA (Pharmacia) gel, followed by ethidium bromide staining. Sequences of the sense (F1) and antisense (R) oligonucleotide primers for human KvLQT1 isoform 1 are shown in Fig. 1. The sense primer (F2) used for specific detection of human KvLQT1 isoform 2 is also shown in Fig. 1. Sense 5′-TCCTGTCTAACACCACAGCG-3′ and antisense 5′-TTCAACGACATAGCACGACC-3′ were used for IsK. Sense 5′-GGCATCGTGATGGACTCCG-3′ and antisense 5′-GCTGGAAGGTGGACAGCGA-3′ were used for human β-actin. The expected fragment lengths calculated from cDNA sequences were 274, 245, 326, and 615 bp for KvLQT1 isoform 1, isoform 2, IsK, and β-actin, respectively. Three different cDNAs were used as hybridization probes for RNase protection assays. The first was a human 274-bp KvLQT1 isoform 1 cDNA corresponding to the 5′ 37 nucleotides upstream and 237 nucleotides downstream from the start codon (Fig. 1). This cDNA contains 62 nucleotides specific for isoform 1, which in an RNase protection assay provides a 274-nucleotide isoform 1-specific protected fragment and a 212-nucleotide protected fragment that hybridizes non-isoform 1 transcripts. The probe was PCR-cloned from the expression vector pCI-KvLQT1 (see below) using tailed primers between the BamHI and HindIII sites of a pBluescript SK vector (Stratagene). The second probe was a human 347-bp KvLQT1 isoform 2 cDNA corresponding to the 5′ 27 nucleotides upstream and the 320 nucleotides downstream from the start codon. This cDNA contains 33 nucleotides specific for isoform 2, which in an RNase protection assay provides a 347-nucleotide isoform 2-specific protected fragment and a 314-nucleotide non-isoform 2 protected fragment. This probe was subcloned from the expression vector pECE-KvLQT1 between the HindIII and PstI sites of a pBluescript SK vector (Stratagene). The third probe was a human 393-bp cDNA corresponding to the full-length IsK sequence (clone pCMV/HIsK). Antisense RNA probes were produced using T7, T3, and SP6 polymerases (Ambion) on linearized KvLQT1 isoform 1, KvLQT1 isoform 2, and IsK templates, respectively, in the presence of [α-32P]rUTP (NEN Life Science Products). RNase protection assays were carried out as described previously (9Péréon Y. Navarro J. Sorrentino V. Louboutin J.P. Noireaud J. Palade P.T. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 433: 221-229PubMed Google Scholar) using the RPA II Kit (Ambion). For each tissue source, 15 μg of total RNA were hybridized to 0.5–1 × 105 cpm of the RNA probe. The RNA was run after RNase digestion on a 5% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel. Sense KvLQT1 isoform 1 RNA was also hybridized and was run on the same gel for use as a size marker (not illustrated), as well as undigested RNA probes. Negative controls were run using t-yeast RNA hybridized with the isoform 1 and isoform 2 probes. Gels were exposed for 48 h at −80 °C on x-ray films (Biomax-MS, Eastman Kodak Co.) with an intensifying screen. Autoradiograms of RNase protection assays were subjected to densitometric analysis using the ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics). The ratios of KvLQT1 isoform 1 and KvLQT1 isoform 2 mRNA levels were determined directly from specific signals since respective protected bands were hybridized with the same probe. The kidney-derived COS-7 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells grown on plastic Petri dishes were microinjected with plasmids at day 1 after plating. Our protocol to microinject cultured cells using the Eppendorf ECET microinjector 5246 system has been reported in detail elsewhere (10Mohammad-Panah R. Demolombe S. Riochet D. Loussouarn G. Leblais V. Baró I. Escande D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids were diluted at a final concentration of 1–5 μg/ml in a buffer composed (in mm): HEPES 50, NaOH 50, NaCl 40, pH 7.4, supplemented with fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 0.5%. Human cardiac KvLQT1 isoform 1 (Ref. 26; GenBankTMaccession number AF000571), KvLQT1 isoform 2, as well as IsK cDNAs were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCI (Promega, Madison, WI) under the control of a cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter. The KvLQT1 isoform 2 construct was derived from the isoform 1 pCI plasmid using polymerase chain reaction and tailed primers. A green fluorescence protein pCI plasmid (a kind gift from Dr. Rainer Waldmann, Sophia-Antipolis, France) was used as an inert plasmid to ensure that cells were always injected with a constant 15 μg/ml plasmid concentration. Whole cell currents were recorded as described previously (10Mohammad-Panah R. Demolombe S. Riochet D. Loussouarn G. Leblais V. Baró I. Escande D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). A Petri dish containing cells was placed on the stage of an inverted microscope and continuously superfused with the standard extracellular solution containing (in mm) NaCl 145, KCl 4, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 1, HEPES 5, glucose 5, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Patch pipettes with a tip resistance 2.5–5 mΩ were electrically connected to a patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments). The intracellular medium contained (in mm): potassium gluconate 145, HEPES 5, EGTA 2, ½ magnesium gluconate 2 (free Mg2+, 0.1), K2ATP 2, pH 7.2, with KOH, whereas the extracellular medium used to record pure K+ currents contained (in mm): sodium gluconate 145, potassium gluconate 4, 1/2 calcium gluconate 7 (free Ca2+, 1), 1/2 magnesium gluconate 4 (free Mg2+, 1), HEPES 5, glucose 5, pH 7.2 with NaOH. Stimulation, data recording, and analysis were performed through an A/D converter (Labmaster). A microperfusion system allowed local application and rapid change of the different experimental solutions warmed at 37 °C. Patch-clamp measurements are presented as the mean ± S.E. The statistical significance of the observed effects was assessed by means of the standard t test. The sequence encoding the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope YPYDVPDYA (11Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) was inserted in frame with the KvLQT1 isoform 1 coding sequence after nucleotide position 654 (see GenBankTM accession number AF000571). This position corresponds to the second external loop of the protein, between serine 218 and lysine 219. pCI-KvLQT1 isoform 1 plasmid was digested with EcoRI and AflIII, and the 716-bp fragment so produced was subcloned into pUC 19 and then digested with BanII and PstI. A sense oligonucleotide containing the tag sequence 5′-TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCT-3′ was annealed with its reverse oligonucleotide and inserted between BanII and PstI sites. The resulting product was digested with EcoRI and AflIII and subcloned into the pCI-KvLQT1 isoform 1 plasmid. To insert the HA tag into KvLQT1 isoform 2 coding sequence, a PCR reaction was performed using the epitope-tagged KvLQT1 isoform 1 plasmid as a template. Epitope-tagged KvLQT1 plasmids were checked by sequencing. Functional expression of the epitope-tagged plasmids was verified by patch-clamp analysis of transfected cells (data not shown). For immunoblotting experiments, COS-7 cells cultured in 25-cm2 flasks were transfected with tagged pCI-KvLQT1 plasmids using 22-kDa polyethyleneimine as a polycationic transfection vector. Twenty four hours post-transfection, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated with 200 μl of SDS gel-loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol), and scraped. The samples were placed in a boiling water bath for 10 min, and the chromosomal DNA was sheared by sonication for 2 min. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature, and the supernatant was used for immunoblotting. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (bovine serum albumin as a standard). Proteins (15 μg/well) were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels using the Laemmli system. The separated proteins were electrotransferred to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Sigma). Electroblotting was carried out in a Tris buffer containing 40.7 mm glycine and 20% (v/v) methanol, pH 8.3, at 100 V for 1.5 h. For immunodetection of the proteins, blots were blocked with PBS supplemented with 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk and 0.1% Tween for 1 h at 37 °C. The monoclonal anti-HA antibody (clone 12CA5, Boehringer Mannheim) was diluted 500-fold in PBS containing 2.5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and incubated with the blots for 1 h at room temperature. After primary antibody reaction, the filters were rinsed 5 times with quench buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a 1:1000 dilution of a biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma). The blots were then incubated for 30 min with conjugated extravidin peroxidase and finally developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting system. Biomax-MR Kodak films were used to detect protein in the blot. For immunocytochemistry, transfected COS-7 cells seeded on 12-mm collagen-coated coverslips were washed three times with PBS supplemented with 1 mm Ca2+ and 0.5 mm Mg2+ and incubated with the monoclonal anti-HA antibody diluted 1:10 in PBS, 0.5% ovalbumin for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) diluted at 1:25 in PBS, 0.5% ovalbumin. The cells were subsequently washed and then fixed using a 15-min incubation with 4% formaldehyde. The glass coverslips were further washed and then mounted in a mounting medium (Citifluor) to prevent photobleaching. Staining was observed using a standard epifluorescence oil-immersion microscope (Axioskop; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). 5′-RACE experiments performed on human heart cDNA identified a clone predicted to encode a truncated KvLQT1 protein lacking an intracytoplasmic N-terminal tail. The predicted N-terminal sequence (Fig. 1) was only 2 amino acids (Met and Asp) longer than the previously published partial sequence (1Wang Q. Curran M.E. Splawski I. Burn T.C. Millholland J.M. VanRaay T.J. Shen J. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. De Jager T. Schwartz P.J. Towbin J.A. Moss A.J. Atkinson D.L. Landes G.M. Connors T.D. Keating M.T. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar) and 131 amino acids shorter than the cardiac KvLQT1 isoform 1 (6Chouabe C. Neyroud N. Guicheney P. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 1997; 17: 5472-5479Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A 27-bp sequence identified 5′-upstream from the start codon matched the KvLQT1 exon 1b sequence recently published by Lee et al. (3Lee M.P. Hu R.J. Johnson L.A. Feinberg A.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). When RT-PCR primers specific for each isoform (Fig. 1) were used, both full-length and N-terminal truncated KvLQT1 isoform RNAs were detected in human ventricular tissues from an explanted heart (Fig. 2). Isoform 2 mRNA was also detected in six right atrial appendages sampled during open heart cardiac surgery (Fig. 2). KvLQT1expression was further quantified in adult human cardiac muscle using an RNase protection assay (Fig. 3). The probe used for isoform 2 mRNA detection spanned 347 bp and covered a portion of isoform 2-specific 5′-coding and non-coding sequences as well as a 314-bp sequence common to isoforms 1 and 2. Thus, with our isoform 2 probe, two RNA fragments were RNase-protected as follows: a 347-bp sequence specifically corresponding to isoform 2 and a 314-bp sequence corresponding to non-isoform 2 (Fig. 3). For isoform 1, the RNase protection hybridization probe covered a 274-bp segment which comprised a 62-bp fragment of isoform 1-specific 5′ sequence and a 212-bp segment common to isoform 1 and 2 sequences (Fig. 1). With this probe, the following two RNA fragments were RNase-protected: a 274-bp sequence corresponding to isoform 1 and a 212-bp sequence corresponding to non-isoform 1 (Fig. 3). This approach allowed direct comparison of the expression level of the different isoforms without the need for an internal marker. Densitometric analysis was used to compare isoform 1/non-isoform 1 bands and isoform 2/non-isoform 2 bands from cardiac tissues. This analysis revealed that isoform 1 and isoform 2 represented 71.9 ± 0.6 and 28.1 ± 0.6%, respectively, of the total KvLQT1 expression in the ventricle and 79.3 ± 2.1 and 20.7 ± 2.1% in the atrium (mean ± S.E., n = 6). Relative expression of isoform 2 in the auricle was significantly lower than in the ventricle (p < 0.05).Figure 3Expression of mRNA for KvLQT1 isoform 1 and isoform 2 in human ventricle and atrium. Representative RNase protection assays demonstrate the presence of the following: (i) a 393-bp protected fragment when ventricular or auricular RNA was hybridized with the IsK probe (lane A); (ii) 274- and 212-bp protected fragments when cardiac RNA was hybridized with the isoform 1 probe (lane B); (iii) 347- and 314-bp protected fragments when RNA was hybridized with the isoform 2 probe (lane C) (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We first investigated whether KvLQT1 isoform 2 is fully processed to the cell membrane. To this end, COS-7 cells were transfected with epitope-tagged plasmids encoding KvLQT1 isoform 1 or KvLQT1 isoform 2. In our tagged constructs, the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) flag was placed within the second extracellular loop of the channel protein so that immunodetection of the tag could be performed in non-permeabilized, non-fixed cells. Fig.4 A shows that specific immunostaining appeared as dots situated at the membrane surface of cells transfected with tagged isoform 1 and isoform 2 but not at the surface of cells transfected with an untagged plasmid. Western blot experiments performed in COS-7 cells transfected with HA-tagged plasmids confirmed that KvLQT1 isoform 1 and KvLQT1 isoform 2 encode proteins at the molecular mass (e.g. 75 and 61 kDa, respectively) predicted by their coding sequences. However, as shown in Fig. 4 B, two different bands for each isoform were visible on the immunoblot. We hypothesized that the lower band may correspond to the unglycosylated form of the protein, whereas the upper band may correspond to the glycosylated form (1Wang Q. Curran M.E. Splawski I. Burn T.C. Millholland J.M. VanRaay T.J. Shen J. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. De Jager T. Schwartz P.J. Towbin J.A. Moss A.J. Atkinson D.L. Landes G.M. Connors T.D. Keating M.T. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). Functional expression experiments were conducted using untagged plasmids. In these experiments, we used the intranuclear plasmid injection technique to ensure precise control of the relative expression of the different transgenes. COS-7 cells intranuclearly injected with 50 μg/ml KvLQT1 isoform 2 exhibited no detectable voltage-activated K+ current either in the absence (Fig.5 A) or presence (Fig.6 A) of the IsK regulator. To investigate a possible effect related to isoform 2 expression, isoform 2 was co-injected with isoform 1 in the absence or presence of IsK. In these experiments, a green fluorescence protein plasmid (pGFP) was used as an inert plasmid substitute to ensure that the total plasmid concentration injected was always 15 μg/ml. Cells injected with 5 μg/ml KvLQT1 isoform 1 (plus 10 μg/ml pCI-GFP) exhibited a voltage-activated K+ current characterized by fast activation kinetics and slow deactivation kinetics (Fig. 5 A and Table I). Cells co-injected with 5 μg/ml isoform 1 plus 5 μg/ml isoform 2 (plus pCI-GFP, 5 μg/ml) displayed no detectable K+ current (not illustrated). Cells co-injected with 5 μg/ml isoform 1 plus 1 μg/ml isoform 2 (plus pCI-GFP, 9 μg/ml) exhibited a K+ current with similar kinetics (Table I) but with markedly reduced amplitude (Fig. 5, A and B). Fig. 5 C shows that the activation curve for the isoform 1-related K+ current was not affected by the presence of isoform 2. In six different experiments during which current tail protocols were applied, the ionic selectivity of the KvLQT1 isoform 1 current was not modified by the presence of isoform 2 (not illustrated). A series of experiments was also performed in the presence of IsK (Fig. 6). Cells co-injected with 5 μg/ml isoform 1 and 5 μg/ml IsK (plus pCI-GFP, 5 μg/ml) exhibited a voltage-activated K+ current with a similar amplitude but slower activation kinetics than cells injected with isoform 1 alone (Table I). Again, co-injection of isoform 2 (1 μg/ml) together with isoform 1 (5 μg/ml) consistently reduced the K+ current amplitude in the presence of IsK (Fig. 6, A and B). As shown in Fig. 6 C, the presence of isoform 2 did not change the half-activation voltage but shifted the activation threshold by ≈20 mV to a more depolarized voltage. Again, in the presence of IsK, isoform 2 did not alter the activation and deactivation kinetics of the isoform 1-related K+ current (Table I). As summarized in Fig. 7, isoform 2 reduced average current tail amplitude dose-dependently. In the presence of 1, 2, and 5 μg/ml isoform 2 but without IsK, the current tail amplitude induced by 5 μg/ml isoform 1 was reduced to 12.6, 4.7, and 0%, respectively, of its control value. In the presence of 5 μg/ml IsK, the same concentrations of isoform 2 reduced current tail amplitude to 47, 33, and 1.8% of its control value, respectively. Thus, the current related to isoform 1 expression was more sensitive to the negative dominance of isoform 2 in the absence than in the presence of IsK. Fig. 7 also shows that the dominant negative effects produced by 1 μg/ml isoform 2 were partially reversed by increasing the IsK plasmid concentration in the injected mixture from 5 to 9 μg/ml.Figure 6Whole cell KvLQT1 K+ currents in COS-7 cells co-injected with 5 μg/ml pCI-IsK plasmid.

https://openalex.org/W2040316448,"We have previously shown that mutations in buried charged residues in the last two transmembrane helices of Vph1p (the 100-kDa subunit of the yeast V-ATPase) inhibit proton transport and ATPase activity (Leng, X. H., Manolson, M., Liu, Q., and Forgac, M. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 22487–22493). In this report we have further explored the function of this region of Vph1p (residues 721–840) using a combination of site-directed and random mutagenesis. Effects of mutations on stability of Vph1p, assembly of the V-ATPase complex, 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine quenching (as a measure of proton transport), and ATPase activity were assessed. Additional mutations were analyzed to test the importance of Glu-789 in TM7 and His-743 in TM6. Although substitution of Asp for Glu at position 789 led to a 50% decrease in 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine quenching, substitution of Ala at this position gave a mutant with 40% quenching relative to wild type, suggesting that a negative charge at this position is not absolutely essential for proton transport. Similarly, a positive charge is not essential at position His-743, since the H743Y and H743A mutants retain 20 and 60% of wild-type quenching, respectively. Interestingly, H743A approaches wild-type ATPase activity at elevated pH while the E789D mutant shows a slightly lower pH optimum than wild type, suggesting that these residues are in a location to influence V-ATPase activity. The low pumping activity of the double mutant (E789H/H743E) suggests that these residues do not form a simple ion pair. Random mutagenesis identified a number of additional mutations both inside the membrane (L739S and L746S) as well as external to the membrane (H729R and V803D) which also significantly inhibited proton pumping and ATPase activity. By contrast, a cluster of five mutations were identified between residues 800 and 814 in the soluble segment just COOH-terminal to TM7 which affected either assembly or stability of the V-ATPase complex. Two mutations (F809L and G814D) may also affect targeting of the 100-kDa subunit. These results suggest that this segment of Vph1p plays a crucial role in organization of the V-ATPase complex.

The V-ATPases also play an important role in such processes as receptor-mediated endocytosis, intracellular membrane traffic, and protein processing and degradation. V-ATPases in the plasma membrane of specialized cells function in renal acidification, pH homeostasis, bone resorption, and tumor metastasis (7Gluck S.L. J. Bioenerg.

The peripheral V1 domain is a 500-kDa complex with the structure A3B3C1D1E1F1G1H1which is responsible for ATP hydrolysis, while the integral V0 domain is a 250-kDa complex with the structure a1d1c“1(c, c′)6 which is responsible for proton translocation across the membrane. in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the V-ATPase subunits are encoded by at least 14 genes (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Acidification of the central vacuole by the V-ATPase is important both to maintain the activity of degradative enzymes and to drive uptake of solutes such as Ca2+ and amino acids (5Anraku Y. Umemoto N. Hirata R. Ohya Y. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Disruption of any of the V-ATPase subunit genes leads to a conditional lethal phenotype (Vma−) in which cells are unable to grow at neutral pH and in the presence of elevated Ca2+ but are able to grow at acidic pH (5Anraku Y. Umemoto N. Hirata R. Ohya Y. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 16Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cross R.L. Duncan T.M. J. Bioenerg.

Biomembr. 1996; 28: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), there is no obvious structural homolog for the 100-kDa subunit of the V-ATPases. In yeast, the 100-kDa subunit is encoded by two homologous genes, VPH1 and STV1(21Manolson M.F. Proteau D. Preston R.A. Stenbit A. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Preuss D. Mulholland J. Botstein D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both genes encode proteins containing an amino-terminal hydrophilic domain of about 45 kDa and a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain of about 55 kDa which contains six to seven putative transmembrane helices. Disruption of both VPH1 and STV1 gives a typical vma− phenotype, whereas disruption of VPH1 alone leads to only partial loss of vacuolar acidification and reduced growth at neutral pH. The incomplete vma− phenotype of the VPH1 knockout is due to the presence of Stv1p, which can partially compensate for the absence of Vph1p. Immunocytochemical studies indicate that Vph1p is targeted to the central vacuole whereas Stv1p is normally targeted to some other intracellular compartment, possibly endosomes (22Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of Vph1p, however, overexpression of STV1 results in mistargeting of sufficient Stv1p to the vacuole to give a nearly wild-type phenotype (22Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of STV1 alone has no obvious phenotypic consequences. Our previous mutagenesis studies of Vph1p suggested a possible role of the 100-kDa subunit in proton translocation (23Leng X.H. Manolson M.F. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of several charged residues in the last four transmembrane helices of Vph1p led to significant loss of ATP-dependent proton transport without discernable effects on either stability or assembly of the V-ATPase complex. In particular, mutation of Glu-789 in the last transmembrane helix to Gln led to almost complete loss of both proton transport and ATPase activity. These results are similar to those obtained for the Escherichia coli F0 a subunit (24Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10043-10050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6606-6612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Cain B.D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the 100-kDa subunit may function as the a subunit homolog in the V-ATPases. To further explore the function of this COOH-terminal region of Vph1p, particularly the last two transmembrane helices, we have carried out additional site-directed as well as random mutagenesis. Our results suggest that this segment of Vph1p plays a crucial role in organization as well as ATP-dependent proton transport by the V-ATPase complex.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) were used to generate and study VPH1 mutants. Yeast cells were grown in YPD medium (yeast extract-peptone-dextrose) or SD (synthetic dropout) medium (28Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 13-14Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on EcoRI-BamHI fragments of either the wild-type VPH1 cDNA or the E789Q mutant plasmid using Altered Sites II in vitro Mutagenesis Systems (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. The mutagenesis oligonucleotides were as follows with substitution sites underlined: E789A, 5′-GTTTTGATGCAGGTACATCTG-3′; E789D, 5′-GTTTTGATGGATGGTACATCTG-3′; Q789H, 5′-GTTTTGATGCATGGTACATCTG-3′; H743E, 5′-GCCTTATCATTGGCAGAGGCTCAATTGTCTAG-3′. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method (29Sanger F. Niklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar) (SequenaseTM Version 2.0 DNA Sequencing Kit, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Fragments containing the indicated mutations were then substituted back into the vector containing the wild-type VPH1 cDNA. No other mutations were detected in the final product. Random mutagenesis was carried out using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based strategy. Oligonucleotide primers corresponding to nucleotides close to both ends of the COOH-terminal segment (from amino acid residue 721 to 840) were used to amplify this region of the VPH1. The first cycle of PCR was carried out in the presence of 200 μm of each of three dNTPs and 0.5 μm of the fourth dNTP, with 200 μm of the fourth dNTP added in the subsequent 24 cycles. Four separate PCR reaction mixtures (with dA, dC, dG, and dT, each at low concentration in the first cycle) were combined, purified, and digested with EcoRI and BamHI. The purified EcoRI-BamHI PCR fragments were then cloned back into the wild-type VPH1 cDNA in the yeast expression shuttle vector pRS316. The ligation mixture was then used to transform E. coli XL-blue cells and the plasmids purified from the pooled transformants and used for transformation of yeast. Yeast cells (MM112) lacking functional endogenous 100-kDa subunit were transformed using the lithium acetate method (30Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar) with the wild-type VPH1 in pRS316 as a positive control and pRS316 vector alone as a negative control. The transformants were selected on uracil minus (Ura−) plates as described previously (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1992Google Scholar). Growth phenotypes of the mutants were assessed on YPD plates buffered with 50 mm KH2PO4 and 50 mmsuccinic acid to either pH 5.5 or 7.5. For testing calcium sensitivity, YPD plates buffered with 50 mm MES and 50 mmMOPS, pH 7.5, were supplemented with 50 mm calcium chloride. To screen the randomly mutated VPH1, the pooled plasmids were introduced into the yeast MM112 using the lithium acetate method and the yeast colonies grown on Ura− plates. Colonies were screened by replica plating on plates buffered to pH 5.5 and 7.5 since mutants lacking V-ATPase activity fail to grow on medium buffered to pH 7.5 (with or without Ca2+), but can grow on medium buffered to pH 5.5 (5Anraku Y. Umemoto N. Hirata R. Ohya Y. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mutants unable to grow at pH 7.5 were verified by retransforming the recovered plasmid into yeast and examining the growth phenotype. DNA sequencing (29Sanger F. Niklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar) of the recovered plasmid was used to identify the site of mutation and to confirm that no other mutations were present. Vacuolar membrane vesicles were isolated as described previously (23Leng X.H. Manolson M.F. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activities were measured using a coupled spectrophotometric assay (33Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) with the modification of using 0.35 mm NADH instead of 0.5 mm NADH. ATP-dependent proton transport was measured by fluorescence quenching using the fluorescence probe ACMA in transport buffer (25 mm MES/Tris, pH 7.2, 5 mmMgCl2) as described previously (34Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of 10 nm bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of the V-ATPase (35Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out as described by Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, whole cell lysates were prepared from overnight cultures grown in Ura− SD medium using glass bead homogenization as described previously (37Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates or vacuolar membrane vesicle were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blots were probed with the mouse monoclonal antibodies 8B1-F3 against the 69-kDa subunit or 10D7 against the 100-kDa subunit (Molecular Probes, Inc.), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Blots were developed using a chemiluminescent detection method obtained from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories. Quantitations were done using an IS-1000 Digital imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Metabolic labeling of cells and immunoprecipitations of the V-ATPase were carried out as described previously (23Leng X.H. Manolson M.F. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), except that the immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 15% acrylamide gels instead of 12% acrylamide gels. The pH profile of V-ATPase activity for individual mutants was measured using a buffer system containing 20 mm each of the following: MES, MOPS, Tris, and glycine. We have carried out mutagenesis of Vph1p in a yeast strain in which both the VPH1 and STV1 genes encoding the 100-kDa subunit of the V-ATPase have been disrupted, leading to typical Vma− growth phenotype. These cells are unable to grow at neutral pH (pH 7.5) but are able to grow at acidic pH (pH 5.5). Mutations were introduced into the VPH1 gene using either site-directed or random mutagenesis and the mutant forms of VPH1 expressed in the double deletion strain using the shuttle vector pRS316. We have previously shown that mutation of Glu-789 in transmembrane helix seven of Vph1p to Gln results in significant loss of proton transport and ATPase activity while having no measurable effect on stability or assembly of the V-ATPase complex (23Leng X.H. Manolson M.F. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of this buried charged residue, additional site-directed mutations were constructed. Both ATP-dependent ACMA quencing (as a measure of proton transport) and bafilomycin-sensitive ATPase activity were measured in vacuoles isolated from wild-type and mutant strains. As can be seen in Fig. 1, ACMA quenching of the Glu-789 mutants varied from 20 to 50% relative to wild-type, with the highest activity observed for the E789D mutant. To assess the effects of these mutations on assembly of the V-ATPase complex, cells were metabolically labeled with 35S and the V-ATPase solubilized with detergent and immunoprecipitated using an antibody directed against the A subunit. As can be seen in Fig. 2, none of the mutations tested had a detectable effect on assembly of the V-ATPase complex.Figure 2Effect of Vph1p Glu-789 mutations on V-ATPase assembly. Yeast cells (the Δvph1Δstv1 strain) expressing the wild-type VPH1 gene, the indicated mutations, or the vector alone were grown overnight in methionine-free media followed by conversion to spheroplasts and incubation with Trans35S-label (50 μCi per 5 × 106spheroplasts) for 60 min at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were then pelleted, lysed in phosphate-buffered saline with polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether and the V-ATPase immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 directed against the 69-kDa A subunit and protein A-Sepharose followed by SDS-PAGE on a 15% acrylamide gel and autoradiography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The positions of the V-ATPase subunits are indicated and were confirmed by comparison with the migration of 14C-labeled molecular weight standards.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Interestingly, substitution of Ala at position Glu-789 resulted in a mutant which retains 40% wild-type ACMA quenching, suggesting that a charged residue at this position is not absolutely essential for proton transport. Because we had also previously observed an approximately 40% decrease in pumping activity on substitution of Ala for His-743 in TM6 (23Leng X.H. Manolson M.F. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we constructed a double mutant in which Glu-789 and His-743 were interchanged. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the ACMA quenching activity of the E789H/H743E double mutant remained low relative to wild type. Because ACMA quenching is not linearly related to proton transport, the apparent differences between ACMA quenching and ATPase activity observed for some of the mutants may not be meaningful. To further explore the function of the COOH-terminal domain (residues 721 to 840), PCR-based random mutagenesis was performed on this region. Following mutagenesis and transformation, transformants were selected for their inability to grow at pH 7.5. Mutants that failed to grow at neutral pH were then screened for stability of the 100-kDa subunit by Western blot analysis on whole cell lysates using monoclonal antibody 10D7 which is specific for Vph1p. Mutants which showed reduced levels of Vph1p were not subjected to further study. Plasmids from mutants showing normal levels of Vph1p in the whole cell lysate were rescued, purified, and reintroduced into the double deletion strain. Plasmids which continued to confer a mutant phenotype were sequenced and Western blots performed on cells transformed with the purified plasmids. As can be seen in Fig. 3, panel A, all of the mutants isolated showed nearly wild-type levels of Vph1p in whole cell lysates. It should be noted that some of the mutants which were discarded in the initial screening may have failed to show normal Western blotting by 10D7 because the mutations resulted in disruption of the epitope recognized by this antibody rather than because they resulted in destabilization of the protein. To assess whether the mutant 100-kDa proteins were targeted correctly to the vacuole, Western blot analysis was performed using antibody 10D7 against Vph1p on isolated vacuolar membranes. As can be seen in Fig. 3, panel B, two of the mutants (F809L and G814D) showed significantly lower levels of Vph1p in the vacuolar membrane, while several other mutants showed smaller reductions. Because disruption of VPH1 leads to the loss of assembly of V1 onto the vacuolar membrane (21Manolson M.F. Proteau D. Preston R.A. Stenbit A. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Preuss D. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14294-14303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we also carried out Western blot analysis on vacuolar membranes using monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 against the A subunit as a measure of assembly of the V-ATPase complex. As can be seen in Fig. 3, panel C, several of the mutants show significant reductions in the level of A subunit associated with the vacuolar membrane, including L780S, L800S, W802R, F809L, and G814D. These mutants would therefore appear to be defective in assembly of the V-ATPase complex. Alternatively, mutations in the 100-kDa subunit may lead to changes in accessibility or stability of the epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 unrelated to assembly of the V-ATPase complex. Both ATP-dependent ACMA quenching and bafilomycin-sensitive ATPase activity were measured in vacuoles isolated from wild-type and mutant cells (Fig. 4). Also shown in Fig.4 is quantitation of the levels of the 100-kDa subunit in cell lysates and vacuoles and levels of the A subunit in vacuoles derived from Western blot analysis (Fig. 3) using an Alpha Innotech digital imaging system. As can be seen, ACMA quenching of the mutants ranged from 0 to 30% of wild type. The reduced proton transport activity of the mutants is consistent with their growth phenotype. Those mutants showing significantly lower ACMA quenching than predicted on the basis of the observed levels of A subunit present on the vacuolar membrane include H729R, L739S, H743R, H743Y, L746S, W802R, V803D, and V803F. The G814D mutant showed higher levels of ACMA quenching and ATPase activity than predicted on the basis of the level of vacuole-associated A subunit. It is possible that in this case, mutation of the 100-kDa subunit has resulted in increased protease sensitivity of the A subunit at a site that does not effect activity but does alter its recognition by the monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3. To further assess the effects of the mutations on assembly of the V-ATPase complex, cells were metabolically labeled with 35S and the V-ATPase solubilized with detergent and immunoprecipitated using antibody 8B1-F3 against the A subunit. As shown in Fig.5, the immunoprecipitation pattern observed for the H743Y, H743R, L746S, and V803D mutants is virtually indistinguishable from that observed for wild type. The H729R and L739S mutants both show nearly normal assembly, although a reduction in intensity of a band at 14 kDa can be observed. The remaining mutants all show varying degrees of defective assembly, as indicated by reductions in the intensity of the V0 bands (molecular mass 100, 36, and 17 kDa) immunoprecipitated using an antibody against a V1 subunit. Interestingly, although Western blot analysis would suggest relatively good assembly of the V803F mutant (Figs. 3 and4), immunoprecipitation indicates a significant dissociation of the V1 and V0 complexes, suggesting that the V803F mutation may lead to destabilization of the V-ATPase complex such that dissociation occurs during detergent solubilization and immunoprecipitation. To further characterize the activity properties of the mutants derived by both site-directed and random mutagenesis, the pH dependence of V-ATPase activity was measured over the range 5.5 to 10.5 for vacuoles isolated from both wild-type and mut"

The cells phenotypically resemble HTLV-immortalized lymphocytes and contain episomally persisting recombinant rhadinoviral sequences, which stably express functional Tax protein.

In contrast to normal T-cells, HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes can proliferate permanently without antigen stimulation (for review see Ref. 6Grassmann R. Fleckenstein B. Desrosiers R.C. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 63: 211-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells freshly immortalized by HTLV-1 initially require exogenous interleukin (IL)-2 for proliferation (7Koga Y. Oh Hori N. Sato H.

The IL-2 independent growth can be caused by a constitutive stimulation of the IL-2 receptor-associated Jak-Stat pathway (10Migone T.S. Lin J.X. Cereseto A. Mulloy J.C. O'Shea J.J. Franchini G.

Biol. 1990; 10: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar); in addition it transforms established rat fibroblast lines (13Tanaka A. Takahashi C. Yamaoka S. Nosaka T. Maki M. Hatanaka M.

(iii) It has a potential for immortalizing primary human T-lymphocytes (17Grassmann R. Berchtold S. Radant I. Alt M. Fleckenstein B. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Ramstedt U. J.

Blood. 1995; 86: 4243-4249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tax potently stimulates viral transcription and acts on an array of cellular promoters. Mechanistically, Tax can stimulate transcription either directly through an intrinsic activation domain (21Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1827-1833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or through activation of signal transducing pathways such as NF-κB. Despite much investigation, it currently still remains unclear whether NF-κB activation by Tax is linked with its property to transform human lymphocytes. To define the Tax-stimulated pathway, which mediates the immortalization of human T-cells, we expressed two types of Tax mutants in primary lymphocytes. One mutant activates CREB/ATF but not NF-κB. The second mutant activates neither CREB nor NF-κB. Here we report that the transduction of a Tax mutant that is active for CREB/ATF but inactive for NF-κB resulted in permanent growth of human primary T-lymphocytes. These results, although not directly addressing the role of NF-κB activation in lymphocyte growth, show that the NF-κB activating function of Tax is dispensable for the immortalization of primary human T-cells. The T-cell lines Kati-40, TRI-1, and TAXI-1 (17Grassmann R. Berchtold S. Radant I. Alt M. Fleckenstein B. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Ramstedt U. J.

Mondi, an interleukin (IL)-2-dependent HTLV-1-infected T-cell line, was derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes of a South African tropical spastic paraparesis patient (kindly provided by Dr. Walter B. Becker, University of Stellenbosch). Mondi, Kati-40, TRI-1, TAXI-1, and NATI-1–5 were grown in 40% RPMI 1640 and 40% CG medium (Vitromex, Vilshofen, Germany) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and 20 units/ml IL-2 (Boehringer Mannheim). The same medium was used for the HTLV-1-negative human IL-2-dependent T-cell line SS8BPT (22Weber F. Meinl E. Drexler K. Czlonkowska A. Huber S. Fickenscher H. Müller-Fleckenstein I. Fleckenstein B. Wekerle H. Hohlfeld R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11049-11053Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The HTLV-1-negative T-cell lines Jurkat, Molt-4, and HuT-78 and the HTLV-1-infected lines HuT-102, C91PL, and MT-2 were cultured with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. To determine Tax activity, lymphoid cultures were transfected with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) indicator plasmids containing the HTLV-1-LTR (17Grassmann R. Berchtold S. Radant I. Alt M. Fleckenstein B. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Ramstedt U. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4570-4575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or four NF-κB binding sites fused to a minimal promoter (23Moch H. Lang D. Stamminger T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7346-7354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To discriminate between NF-κB and IL-2 effects on the IL-2Rα promoter, CAT indicator plasmids pmIL2RαPrCAT1 and pmIL2RαPrTKCAT8 (24Plaetinck G. Combe M.C. Corthesy P. Sperisen P. Kanamori H. Honjo T. Nabholz M. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3340-3347PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Markus Nabholz (Epalinges, Switzerland). Plasmid pmIL2RαPrCAT1 contains a complete IL-2Rα promoter (−2470 to +162). The plasmid pmIL2RαPrTKCAT8 contains the thymidine kinase of herpes simplex virus basal promoter fused to a segment of the IL2-Rα promoter containing the IL-2 response elements. Plasmid DNA (10 μg) was electroporated, and CAT reactions were performed as described (25Schmitt I. Rosin O. Rohwer P. Gossen M. Grassmann R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 633-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,26Gröne M. Hoffmann E. Berchtold S. Cullen B.R. Grassmann R. Virology. 1994; 204: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Results were quantified by phosphorimaging (BAS2000, Fuji-X). As an internal standard, luciferase activity from a co-transfected plasmid pRSVluc (5 μg) was determined. Flow cytometric analyses were done as described (25Schmitt I. Rosin O. Rohwer P. Gossen M. Grassmann R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 633-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies recognizing CD2 (Leu5-b), CD3 (LeuTM-4), CD4 (LeuTM-3a), CD8 (LeuTM-2), CD19 (LeuTM-12), CD25 (Anti-IL-2Rα), CD45 (Anti-HLe-1), CD69(LeuTM-23), CD95, HLA-DR (HLA-DR), and B7-1 (BB1) were purchased from Becton Dickinson (Heidelberg). The CD28 (9.3) and CD58 (AICD58) antibodies were obtained from Squibb (Seattle) and Dianova (Hamburg), respectively. Recombinant viruses were generated as described previously (17Grassmann R. Berchtold S. Radant I. Alt M. Fleckenstein B. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Ramstedt U. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4570-4575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Grassmann R. Dengler C. Müller-Fleckenstein I.

The DNAs of the Tax mutants M7 (27Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and S258A (28Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. Virology. 1992; 188: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were assembled into the same expression cassette (pHISL) used previously for the construction of Taxwt-expressing rhadinoviruses (17Grassmann R. Berchtold S. Radant I. Alt M. Fleckenstein B. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Ramstedt U. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4570-4575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Grassmann R. Dengler C. Müller-Fleckenstein I.

Upon transfection these open reading frames yielded the same amount of protein as wild type, if they were expressed under the control of the same promoter (data not shown and Ref. 27Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This indicated similar stabilities of wild type and mutant Tax proteins. The phenotypes of the Tax mutants were verified in co-transfection experiments using LTR-CAT and NF-κB CAT indicator plasmids. The expression cassettes were inserted into a recombination plasmid containing a neor selection marker and flanking rhadinoviral sequences. These sequences permitted recombination with the rhadinovirus Herpesvirus saimiri A11S4 (29Desrosiers R.C. Silva D.P. Waldron L.M. Letvin N.L. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 701-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and directed the Tax expression cassettes into the right junction of unique and repetitive sequences of its genome. The recombinant rhadinoviruses were purified by geneticin selection and subsequently by two plaque isolations. The presence of the mutations was verified in the purified recombinant viral stocks by Southern blot analysis and sequencing of PCR products. For immortalization assays, primary lymphocytes were isolated from cord blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation, stimulated by phytohemagglutinin and infected as described (18Grassmann R. Dengler C. Müller-Fleckenstein I. Fleckenstein B. McGuire K. Dokhelar M.C. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3351-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). To detect episomally persisting recombinant rhadinovirus DNA, cells were lysed in situ on top of an agarose gel; the DNA was separated by electrophoresis into chromosomal, episomal, and linear fractions (18Grassmann R. Dengler C. Müller-Fleckenstein I. Fleckenstein B. McGuire K. Dokhelar M.C. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3351-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The Southern blot was analyzed with a Tax-specific probe. To verify unrearranged tax sequences, total cellular DNA was subjected to PCR analyses using tax-specific primers (sense 5′-CAGCCCACTTCCCAGGGTTTGGAC-3′ or 5′-CCAATCACTCATACAACCCCCA-3′ and antisense 5′-GTGTGAGAGTAGAAATGAGGGGT-3′). These primers resulted in PCR products of 627 and 880 nucleotides. To confirm the presence of the mutation within tax, purified PCR products were sequenced. Cytokine RNAs were detected by standard reverse transcriptase-PCR using primers described in Platzer et al. (30Platzer C. Ode Hakim S. Reinke P. Docke W.D. Ewert R. Volk H.D. Transplantation. 1994; 58: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Tax-, IκB-α-, IL-1α-, and IL-2Rα-RNA expression was detected by Northern blot analyses as described previously (18Grassmann R. Dengler C. Müller-Fleckenstein I. Fleckenstein B. McGuire K. Dokhelar M.C. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3351-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Hybridization signals were quantified by phosphorimaging. Tax was detected on Western blots with monoclonal mouse antibodies using the ECL system (Amersham Corp., Braunschweig, Germany). The Tax-specific hybridomas 168B17-46-34/50 (contributor, Beatrice Langton) and the polyclonal anti-rabbit antiserum (contributor, Bryan Cullen) were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. To determine the IκB-α protein half-life, lymphocytes were cultured in the presence of 150 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris (pH 800), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet p-40, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 1 mmNa3OV4, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and 5 mm NaF. The protein extract (50 μg/lane) was subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-IκB-α/MAD-3 antibodies (C15, Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany). To investigate whether the Tax-mediated activation of CREB/ATF or NF-κB transcription is important for the immortalizing phenotype, we tested two distinctive Tax mutants using rhadinovirus transduction. The capacity of Tax to activate NF-κB can be selectively abolished by point mutagenesis, without affecting its activation of the CREB/ATF path (27Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 31Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7183-7192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This selectivity has been described for the TaxS258A mutant, which contains a single amino acid change at position 258 from serine to alanine. The S258A mutation within Tax abolishes NF-κB activation. However, it leaves the protein activity on CREB/ATF-dependent transcription unaltered. TaxS258A was incapable of stimulating NF-κB site-dependent transcription using indicator plasmids (23Moch H. Lang D. Stamminger T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7346-7354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown) but retains its stimulatory effect on the HTLV-1 LTR. The NF-κB phenotype of TaxS258A has also been extensively characterized in a previous study; no NF-κB activation above basal levels could be detected (31Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7183-7192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second Tax mutant M7 (27Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) is negative for both NF-κB and CREB-dependent transcriptional stimulation. A rhadinovirus vector derived from the A11 strain of the New World primate agent H. saimiri, which has been clearly shown not to transform human lymphocytes (6Grassmann R. Fleckenstein B. Desrosiers R.C. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 63: 211-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Meinl E. Hohlfeld R. Wekerle H. Fleckenstein B. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 55-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), was used for the transduction of the tax mutants. This vector is a non-transforming apathogenic deletion variant of the A11 strain (17Grassmann R. Berchtold S. Radant I. Alt M. Fleckenstein B. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Ramstedt U. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4570-4575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,18Grassmann R. Dengler C. Müller-Fleckenstein I. Fleckenstein B. McGuire K. Dokhelar M.C. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3351-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 29Desrosiers R.C. Silva D.P. Waldron L.M. Letvin N.L. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 701-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); it persists in human T-cells without detectable expression of herpesvirus genes (33Simmer B. Alt M. Buckreus I. Berthold S. Fleckenstein B. Platzer E. Grassmann R. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 1953-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This ensures that biological effects elicited from this approach are a consequence of Tax expression. The mutant Tax cDNA sequences were assembled into the same expression cassette used previously for the construction of Taxwt-expressing rhadinovirus recombinants and introduced into the viral genome by homologous recombination. The transforming potential of the recombinants was assessed in primary human lymphocytes. In five independent experiments using cord blood samples from four different individuals, TaxS258A resulted in immortalized lymphoid cultures (NATI). NATI cells were found to duplicate every 28–59 h under optimal growth conditions. This does not significantly differ from TAXI-1/TRI-1 cells immortalized with wtTax (t2 = 26–71 h). All of these cultures have been propagated for at least 16 months and some for more than 2 years. Although these show IL-2 growth dependence, control cells died within 10–12 weeks even in the presence of IL-2. We also noted that in five out of five tries cultures infected with the vector or with recombinants carrying the TaxM7 failed to produce any immortalized cells. This finding suggests that TaxS258A but not TaxM7 was competent for the immortalization of primary human lymphocytes. To verify if immortalization by Tax transduction may be a biologically important model for HTLV-1 transformation/ATLL, the immortalized cells were characterized in detail. First the cells were checked for an absence of infectious H. saimiri. None of the human CBL-derived cell lines (NATI) produced infectious rhadinovirus, which was concluded from co-cultivation experiments with permissive OMK-637 cells. Futhermore it was confirmed that each human CBL line contained the expected tax mutant as a part of episomally persisting recombinant rhadinoviral DNA and not as linear DNA, which would be characteristic for virus particles. Additionally, PCR with two tax-specific primer pairs detected intact configuration of tax sequences. The preservation of the taxmutations 8–12 months after transduction was verified by direct sequencing of PCR products. The expression of Tax could be quantitated by detection of specific transcripts in Northern blots (Fig.1 A) and of Tax protein in Western blots (Fig. 1 B). The amounts of Tax protein in the cells immortalized by the mutant taxS258A were roughly equal to the amounts observed in cell lines immortalized previously by the transduction of the taxwt gene (not shown). The human lymphocytes immortalized by tax were further characterized for surface expression of marker proteins (TableI). Four cell lines expressing the taxS258A gene were phenotypically analyzed in detail. NATI-1-4 cells were compared with cells immortalized with taxwt (TAXI-1, Kati 40, and TRI-1) and with established HTLV-1-immortalized lymphocytes (MT-2, C91-PL, HuT-102, and Mondi). We found that all the cell lines transduced with taxS258A were T-cell lines expressing CD45 and CD2 but not CD19, a B-cell marker (Table I). These cells, like HTLV-immortalized cells, had no or diminished (compared with normal T-cells) CD3 surface expression (data not shown). All cell lines expressed either CD4 and/or CD8. The same subtypes of T-cells have been shown to be immortalized by HTLV-1 (9Persaud D. Munoz J.L. Tarsis S.L. Parks E.S. Parks W.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6297-6303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with HTLV-1-transformed cells, all Tax-transduced cell lines had an activated phenotype. Qualitative reverse transcriptase-PCR demonstrated that the cells expressed RNAs coding for the inflammatory cytokines IL-1α, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and leukemia inhibitory factor but not IL-2 RNA (data not shown). In addition the cells expressed a series of activation-specific markers (CD25, CD69, CD95, and B7-1). No major quantitative alteration among the surface markers was detectable with the exception of CD25. The surface expression of this protein, the α chain of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2Rα), was found significantly reduced in cells transduced by the mutant Tax protein compared with cells containing the wild type Tax (Fig.2 A). Taken together surface markers and cytokine expression profiles reveal significant phenotypic similarities between HTLV-1-immortalized cells and lymphocytes transduced by either Taxwt or its NF-κB activation-deficient S258A derivative.Table IPhenotype of the immortalized cellsCellsSurface markersCD2CD3CD4CD8CD19CD25CD28CD45CD58CD69CD95B7–1HLA-DRTaxS258ANati-1+1-a+ indicates positive.++−−1-b− indicates negative.++++++++Nati-2+−−+−+−++++++Nati-3++++−+NT1-cNT indicates not tested.++++++Nati-4++−+−++++++++TaxwtTAXI-1+−+−−+−++NTNT+NTTRI-1+++−−+−++NT++NTHTLV-1Mondi+++−−+−++NTNT+NTMT-2−−+−−+−++NT++NTC91PL−−+−−+−++NTNT+NTHuT-102+++−−+−++NT++NT1-a + indicates positive.1-b − indicates negative.1-c NT indicates not tested. Open table in a new tab Tax stimulates the IL-2Rα promoter via NF-κB (34Leung K. Nabel G.J. Nature. 1988; 333: 776-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To determine whether the reduced surface expression of IL-2Rα could be due to a loss of promoter transactivation by Tax, we investigated the IL-2Rα transcription in cells without Tax, with Taxwt, and with mutant Tax. The mRNAs were detected by Northern blots and normalized to an internal standard mRNA (GAPDH). Fig. 2 B shows the average from three independent experiments. As a result the content of IL-2Rα transcripts was clearly reduced in cells containing the Tax mutant thus accounting for the diminished surface expression of CD25. These data suggested that the TaxS258A-expressing cells have lower NF-κB activity compared with the wild type counterpart. The remaining IL-2Rα mRNA expression detected in the cells could be due to a recently identified upstream element of the human IL-2Rα promoter (IL-2rE), which is not activated by NF-κB (35John S. Robbins C.M. Leonard W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5627-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This element strongly responds to IL-2, which is a component of the growth medium used. To determine whether the IL-2rE contributes to the activity of the IL-2Rα promoter CAT indicator plasmids were transfected. An IL-2rE containing promoter segment, which is not activated by NF-κB, was found at least as active as the complete promoter in the TaxS258A-expressing NATI cells; in contrast the complete promoter was clearly more active in cells expressing Taxwt. This suggests that the IL2-Rα promoter in TaxS258A-immortalized cells is stimulated by transcription factors different from NF-κB and that in these cells the IL-2rE element accounts for most of the activity of the promoter. Taken together, these data suggested that lower NF-κB activity in the TaxS258A-expressing cells caused reduced expression of IL2-Rα/CD25. To check whether autocrine activation of NF-κB exists in Tax-immortalized CBLs, the state of NF-κB activation was analyzed. This was measured using the expression level of RNAs initiated from NF-κB site-dependent IL-1α promoter (36Mori N. Prager D. Blood. 1996; 87: 3410-3417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mRNA content of cells without Tax, with Taxwt, and with mutant Tax was quantitated by Northern blots, which were normalized to an internal standard mRNA (GAPDH). Fig. 3 shows the average from three independent experiments. A clear difference was seen between those cells expressing wild type and mutant Tax. IL-1α transcripts were strongly reduced in the lymphocytes transduced with mutant TaxS258A. These data suggest that the TaxS258A-expressing cells have lower NF-κB activity compared with its wild type counterpart. This finding likely reflects an intrinsic property of TaxS258A since four out of four independently immortalized cell lines show the same phenotype. As a further parameter of NF-κB activity, the amount of IκB-α mRNA was determined. This is a more direct measure of NF-κB activity, since IκB-α is directly involved in the feedback control of NF-κB (37Le Bail O. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5043-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 38Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) and because the IκB-α promoter is strongly induced by active NF-κB. Fig.4 A shows that IκB-α mRNA is highly expressed in the cells expressing Taxwt. By contrast, low levels of IκB-α RNA are present in cell lines expressing the TaxS258A and in Tax-negative T-lymphocytic cell lines, consistent with low endogenous NF-κB activity. We also determined the half-life time of the IκB-α protein in cells expressing TaxS258A (NATI-2) and Taxwt. Cycloheximide was added to block protein synthesis, and the amounts of IκB-α after different time intervals were measured. Fig.4 B shows that IκB-α protein is stable, with a half-life of 2–4 h in TaxS258A cells. The same stability (half-life, 2–4 h) was observed in an uninfected human T-cell line SS8-BPT (data not shown). In contrast, the IκB-α protein has a shorter half-life in the presence of Taxwt (Fig. 3 B). These data additionally corroborate that NF-κB activity is not inappropriately elevated in cells expressing the TaxS258A. As a third measure of the NF-κB activation status, we analyzed the expression of transfected reporter genes. One indicator plasmid used contained four copies of an NF-κB response element positioned upstream of a minimal promoter, and the second contained the promoter from the HTLV-1 LTR. The CAT assays were normalized by co-transfecting a constitutively active luciferase gene. We found that the activity of the HTLV promoter was higher compared with that of the NF-κB test promoter in all cells immortalized by the taxwtand taxS258A genes and in the HTLV-1-transformed controls (Fig. 5 A). Consistent with Tax-mediated activation of its own promoter, the activity of the HTLV promoter was much higher in these cells than in the Tax-negative control T-cells (Jurkat). Jurkat cells show even higher NF-κB responses than HTLV-1 promoter-responsive expression (Fig.5 A). This confirms that the Taxwt and TaxS258A proteins were similarly functional in transactivating the HTLV-1 LTR. By contrast, whereas the NF-κB indicator construct was strongly expressed in all cells containing Taxwt (23%, 35% of HTLV promoter activity) (Fig.5 B), its activity was low compared with the HTLV-1 CAT construct in TaxS258A cells (3–5% of HTLV promoter activity). This provides further support to the hypothesis that NF-κB is not aberrantly activated in Tax S258A-immortalized cells and suggests that growth stimulation of these cells is more likely a consequence of NF-κB independent activation. How HTLV-1 Tax transforms cells is controversial. Although it is agreed that Tax can activate CREB/ATF and NF-κB, there is disagreement about the pathway correlating with transformation (14Yamaoka S. Inoue H. Sakurai M. Sugiyama T. Hazama M. Yamada A. Hatanaka M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 873-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,39Smith M.R. Greene W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus when immortalized rodent cells were used each of these pathways have been linked to transformation. Because immortalized rodent cells are an artificial model for the development of adult T-cell leukemia, we asked what is required of Tax in the first step of transformation (i.e. immortalization) of primary human lymphocytes. The experiments described here indicate that a Tax mutant which activates CREB/ATF but cannot activate NF-κB can immortalize human primary T-lymphocytes. We verified that the immortalizing phenotype was not due to fortuitous activation of NF-κB since these cells were found to contain greatly reduced levels of NF-κB activity. Our findings support an NF-κB-independent pathway for Tax immortalization of human T-lymphocytes. Although the NF-κB phenotype of the mutant S258A was thoroughly established by two groups, it is formally not possible to exclude that some unmeasurable low effect on NF-κB could have contributed to the T-cell immortalization. The residual IL-2Rα transcription in the mutant immortalized cells does not indicate residual NF-κB activity, since the promoter is activated by its IL-2 response elements. By using many independent criteria, we found that cells immortalized by the rhadinovirus tax hybrids resemble HTLV-1-immortalized lymphocytes. These cells express virtually identical cytokine patterns and have similar patterns of surface markers. Like HTLV-1-transformed lymphocytes, Tax-immortalized lymphocytes can lose the CD-3 surface marker expression (8Inatsuki A. Yasukawa M. Kobayashi Y. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1327-1333PubMed Google Scholar). This finding is unique to HTLV-1-associated immortalization since this does not occur with H. saimiriimmortalized lymphocytes (32Meinl E. Hohlfeld R. Wekerle H. Fleckenstein B. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 55-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Three facts support that Tax induced the immortalization of the primary T-cells and that rhadinovirus genes did not contribute to the immortalized phenotype. 1) The only transcription found in human T-cells originated from the genomic region, which is deleted in the vector strain used (40Fickenscher H. Biesinger B. Knappe A. Wittmann S. Fleckenstein B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6012-6019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2) No herpes viral transcripts were found in T-cells infected and immortalized by the recombinants expressing the Taxwt gene (41Alt M. Grassmann R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1421-1427PubMed Google Scholar). 3) The cells infected with vector expressing TaxS258A did not synthesize infectious herpesvirus particles. These findings, besides the observation that the transduction with the H. saimiri vector produces no immortalization, indicate that the cellular growth changes are a direct consequence of HTLV-Tax expression. The human primary lymphocytes transduced by the Tax mutant S258A are immortalized since they have an extended life span, and they proliferate in the absence of antigen presenting cells. The cells resemble HTLV-1-infected cell cultures derived from patients both in surface marker expression and growth factor requirements. These findings underline the proximity of this model system to ATL lymphocytes. We are not persuaded that rodent fibroblast models for Tax transformation have similar physiological relevance. In this regard we note that in other systems Tax proteins of HTLV-1 and BLV have been shown to exert an immortalizing effect on primary rat fibroblasts (12Pozzatti R. Vogel J. Jay G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar,42Willems L. Heremans H. Chen G. Portetelle D. Billiau A. Burny A. Kettmann R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1577-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and transforming activity in established rat fibroblast cell lines. Thus Yamaoka and colleagues (14Yamaoka S. Inoue H. Sakurai M. Sugiyama T. Hazama M. Yamada A. Hatanaka M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 873-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) showed that Tax, which is deficient in NF-κB activation, does not transform the Rat-1 fibroblast line. Surprisingly, a different group showed that the Rat-2 cell line could be morphologically transformed by a Tax mutant, which was deficient for NF-κB activation (39Smith M.R. Greene W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Confusion about the impact of Tax mutations on fibroblast transformation probably stems from system to system variations (i.e. Tax mutants used) and cell type differences. These differences suggest cautiousness in extrapolating results about the role of Tax in transformation from rodent fibroblast cell line systems to human primary lymphocytes. We believe that our current findings contribute toward the development of a relevant human primary T-cell system for studying HTLV-1-induced ATL. Unlike the findings in rodent cell lines, in primary human T-cells, NF-κB activation by Tax is evidently not a critical component of immortalization. This observation agrees with the finding from Smith and Greene (39Smith M.R. Greene W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, our results do not exclude that in other settings activation of NF-κB can be a potent modulator/inductor of cellular proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2026333608,"Regulated proteolysis has been postulated to be critical for proper control of cell functions. Muscle development, in particular, involves a great deal of structural adaptation and remodeling mediated by proteases. The transcription factor YY1 represses muscle-restricted expression of the sarcomeric α-actin genes. Consistent with this repressor function of YY1, the nuclear regulator is down-regulated at the protein level during skeletal as well as cardiac muscle cell differentiation. However, the YY1 message remains relatively unaltered throughout the myoblast-myotube transition, implicating a post-translational regulatory mechanism. We show that YY1 can be a substrate for cleavage by the calcium-activated neutral protease calpain II (m-calpain) and the 26 S proteasome. The calcium ionophore A23187 destabilized YY1 in cultured myoblasts, and the decrease in YY1 protein levels could be prevented by calpain inhibitor II and calpeptin. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin resulted in the stabilization of YY1 protein, which is consistent with the finding that YY1 is readily polyubiquitinated in reticulocyte lysates. We further show that proteolytic targeting by calpain II and the proteasome involves different structural elements of YY1. This study thus illustrates two proteolytic pathways through which the transcriptional regulator can be differentially targeted under different cell growth conditions.

This study thus illustrates two proteolytic pathways through which the transcriptional regulator can be differentially targeted under different cell growth conditions. Many cellular processes are known to be controlled by short-lived proteins, including products of the proto-oncogenes, cell cycle regulators, and developmentally regulated transcription factors (1Carillo S. Pariat M. Steff A.M. Roux P. Etienne-Julan M. Lorca T. Piechaczyk M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1679-1689PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Biol. 1995; 15: 731-741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fast turnover of these regulatory proteins reflects a metabolic requirement for rapidly changing their concentrations and is presumably mediated by a complex interplay among various proteases and protease inhibitors. Selective degradation of transcriptional activators and repressors, in particular, may provide efficient regulatory mechanisms contributing to the rapid shut-off and turn-on of gene activity, respectively. The recent study of the pleiotropic transcription factor NF-κB has revealed that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway can function not only in the complete degradation of proteins but also in the regulated processing of precursors into active transcription factors (4Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar, 5Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). Calpains represent the other major class of nonlysosomal proteases functioning in a calcium-dependent fashion (6Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Taylor R.G. Christiansen J.A. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 7Suzuki K. Saido T.C. Hirai S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 674: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both the proteasome and calpains have been found to play a regulatory role in the function and/or stability of c-Fos and the tumor suppressor protein p53 (8Stancovski I. Gonen H. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7106-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 9Hirai S. Kawasaki H. Yaniv M. Suzuki K.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Thus, rapid degradation or processing of specific transcription factors can underlie a wide range of dynamic cellular and developmental processes. Muscle development involves a great deal of structural adaptation and remodeling mediated by induced protein synthesis and degradation (12Dayton W.R. Schollmeyer J.V. Lepley R.A. Cortes L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 659: 48-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 13Couch C.B. Strittmatter W.J. Cell. 1983; 32: 257-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 14Kumar A. Shafiq S. Wadgaonkar R. Stracher A. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1992; 38: 687-691PubMed Google Scholar). Although protein turnover must be highly selective if it is to be developmentally useful, little is known concerning the regulatory mechanisms responsible for protein targeting and subsequent degradation during development. The expression of a lysosomal cysteine protease family, cathepsins, was found to increase during muscle differentiation (15Jane D.T. Dufresne M.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Myoblast fusions in chick and rats were both shown to require metalloendoprotease activity (16Hayward L.J. Schwartz R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1485-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Consistent with the observed calcium influx during myoblast membrane fusion (17David J.D. See W.M. Higginbotham C. Dev. Biol. 1981; 82: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the activity of the calcium-activated neutral protease (calpain) is up-regulated during and required for myogenesis (14Kumar A. Shafiq S. Wadgaonkar R. Stracher A. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1992; 38: 687-691PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kwak K.B. Chung S.S. Kim O.M. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1175: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that temporal regulation of proteolytic events plays an important role in muscle development. In most cases, however, the endogenous protein substrates proteolyzed during differentiation have not been characterized, and the physiological relevance remains to be examined. We have previously shown that YY1, a C2H2-type zinc finger DNA-binding protein (19Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar), is capable of simultaneously activating and repressing the expression of the c-mycproto-oncogene and the sarcomeric α-actin gene, respectively (20Lee T.C. Zhang Y. Schwartz R.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1047-1052PubMed Google Scholar). In chick embryonic myoblast culture, YY1 inhibits muscle-restricted transcription of the skeletal α-actin gene by excluding SRF, a positive MADS-box myogenic transcription factor, from the most proximal serum response element of the actin gene promoter (20Lee T.C. Zhang Y. Schwartz R.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1047-1052PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lee T.C. Chow K.L. Fang P. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5090-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies, myoblasts rendered incapable of differentiation were found to contain higher levels of YY1 and c-Myc proteins compared with the differentiated myotubes. Given the established inhibitory effect of c-myc on myogenic differentiation (22Miner J.H. Wold B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and the activating effect of YY1 on c-myc (20Lee T.C. Zhang Y. Schwartz R.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1047-1052PubMed Google Scholar, 23Riggs K. Saleque S. Wong K.K. Merrell K.T. Lee J.S. Shi Y. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the down-regulation of YY1 was postulated to be essential for the expression of the sarcomeric α-actin genes. However, the YY1 down-regulation mechanism during myogenesis remains unclear. Here we report that YY1 is similarly down-regulated during the in vitro differentiation of cultured rat skeletal myoblasts and ventricular cardiomyocytes. In contrast to the down-regulation of YY1 protein, the YY1 message remains unaltered throughout the myoblast-myotube transition. We present both in vivo and in vitro evidence that calpains and the 26 S proteasome are involved in the in vivo stability of YY1. This finding illustrates a post-translational mechanism through which the repressor of myogenic transcription may be selectively inactivated by developmentally regulated proteolysis to facilitate muscle development. Primary skeletal and cardiac muscle cell cultures were prepared as described (24Kalenik J.L. Chen D. Bradley M.E. Chen S.J. Lee T.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 25Chen S.J. Bradley M.E. Lee T.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). In brief, minced tissues were gently agitated in 15 ml of 0.05% trypsin + 1 mm EDTA at 4 °C overnight. Excessive trypsin solution was removed following overnight agitation, and tissue fragments further incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, after which 10 ml of minimal essential medium (MEM) 1The abbreviations used are: MEM, minimal essential medium; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TLCK, tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone. containing 10% horse serum was added to inactivate trypsin. Collagenase (Worthington) and DNase I (Sigma) were then added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and 0.1 mg/ml, respectively, for another 20 min of incubation. Tissue fragments were then triturated three to four cycles with the addition of 10 ml of medium for each cycle. Skeletal myoblasts were plated in MEM + 10% fetal bovine serum on Primaria culture dishes (Falcon) at a density of 3,120 cells/mm2. Cardiac myocytes were plated in MEM + 10% horse serum at a density of 1,040 cells/mm2. Cultured mouse C2 and Sol8 myoblasts were maintained in MEM + 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Calpain inhibitor II and calpeptin were purchased from Calbiochem. MG132 was provided by Cecile Pickart (Johns Hopkin University). Lactacystin was purchased from E. J. Corey (Harvard University). Approximately 10 million Sol8 cells were harvested by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were spun down and freeze-thawed once. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.3 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Cells were homogenized at 4 °C by 100 strokes in a period of 20 min. The cell lysate was briefly clarified (5 s), and the supernatant was collected and frozen in aliquots at −75 °C. This crude protein extract was used as the source of endogenous calpain. The in vitro cleavage assay was done in a total volume of 20 μl. In each reaction, 2.5 μg of purified bacterially expressed YY1 was used as substrate. Either Sol8 myoblast lysate (3.3 μg) or purified calpain II (1–2 μg; from Calbiochem or Sigma) was used as the source of protease. Proteins were first assembled on ice, and CaCl2 was added to initiate the cleavage reaction. Cleavage reactions were continued at 37 °C for 5 min for lysate or 20 min for purified calpain II. Reactions were terminated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer supplemented with β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were boiled for 5 min, electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE, and then probed by Western blot. To assess the specificity of protease inhibitors, a modified nonradioactive caseinolysis assay was used (26Buroker-Kilgore M. Wang K.K.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Reactions were set up in 15 μl containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 60 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 5 mm CaCl2, and 60 μg of α-casein. An individual control reaction lacking CaCl2 was also set up for each protease inhibitor. Reactions were initiated by adding various protease inhibitors and 1 μg of calpain II and allowed to proceed at room temperature for 60 min. 5 μl of 0.25 m EGTA was added to stop the reaction, and 5 μl of sample was mixed with 0.2 ml of diluted Bio-Rad protein assay dye. A595 was measured by a Labsystem Multiscan microplate reader. Calpain activity was expressed as decrease in A595 in the presence of calcium. In vitroubiquitination of YY1 was carried out using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (a source of ubiquitination enzymes) purchased from Promega. Reactions were set up in 30 μl containing 22.5 μl of reticulocyte lysates and 0.1 μg of purified recombinant YY1 and incubated at 37 °C for 2 min. Samples were then processed for 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blot using an anti-YY1 antibody as described below. Total RNA was isolated using the guanidinium thiocyanate method. Isolated RNA was dissolved in formamide, mixed with ethidium bromide (final concentration 0.1 μg/ml), and separated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 37% formaldehyde. RNA was transferred to nylon membrane (Bio-Rad) and immobilized by UV cross-linking. Membrane was blocked in prehybridization solution (1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% dextran sulfate, and 1 m NaCl) for 5 h and then incubated with a random-primed YY1 cDNA probe at 55 °C overnight. Probed membrane was washed twice with 2× SSC at 55 °C followed by one wash with 0.2× SSC. Membrane was air dried and processed for autoradiography. Cells were harvested by scraping at the time points indicated and lysed in TNT (0.2 m Tris, pH 8, 0.2m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, and lysates were processed for SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to Immobilon-P membrane. The YY1 and SRF antibodies were described previously (24Kalenik J.L. Chen D. Bradley M.E. Chen S.J. Lee T.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to detect transferred proteins. Our previous studies using an avian embryonic muscle system showed that cycling myoblasts contain higher levels of YY1 protein but lower levels of SRF protein than post-mitotic, differentiated myotubes. To determine whether YY1 and SRF are also differentially regulated in mammalian cells, we set up primary muscle cell cultures prepared from newborn rats. Western blots shown in Fig.1 (top) illustrated that the YY1 protein levels were the highest in replicating rat myoblasts (24 h) and were reduced between 24 and 48 h when myoblasts were progressing through cell fusion. It is possible that the residual YY1 protein detected after 24 h was derived from contaminating fibroblasts since we found that fibroblasts contain higher levels of YY1 (21Lee T.C. Chow K.L. Fang P. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5090-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 (middle) shows that SRF protein levels were increased during myogenesis and were the highest in fully differentiated myotubes (96 h). The developmental pattern of YY1 protein was further examined in cultured rat ventricular cardiac myocytes (Fig. 2, top). The study indicated that YY1 was similarly down-regulated during in vitro cardiac differentiation. Cardiac fibroblasts maintained under the same differentiation medium (Fig. 2, bottom) exhibited similar YY1 protein contents throughout, suggesting a down-regulation mechanism unique to muscle cell differentiation.Figure 2Down-regulation of YY1 protein during ventricular cardiac myocyte differentiation. Cardiac ventricles were isolated from 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Cells were preplated to deplete fibroblasts and plated in MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 μm araC. Cells were maintained in the growth medium for 3 days in the presence of araC, after which culture medium was changed to the differentiation medium (see text) without araC (0 h). Myocytes were harvested at the time points indicated, and lysates were processed for Western analysis. Top panel, cardiac myocyte proteins probed with YY1 antibody (CA); middle panel, cardiac myocyte proteins stained with Coomassie Blue;bottom panel, cardiac fibroblast proteins probed with YY1 antibody (FB). Fibroblasts were maintained in differentiation medium as control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although YY1 is presumed to be expressed in many tissues where it may assume a constitutive rather than a regulatory role, our studies clearly show that YY1 protein is down-regulated during skeletal as well as ventricular cardiac muscle cell differentiation. Since changes in YY1 protein content could be effected at multiple levels, we sought to examine the kinetics of YY1 mRNA synthesis. The temporal pattern of YY1 expression during skeletal muscle cell differentiation was analyzed by Northern hybridization in Fig. 3, which shows that YY1 mRNA levels did not significantly change from cycling myoblasts (24 h) to post-mitotic myotubes (72 h). Consistent with our finding, the YY1 mRNA levels were found to remain relatively constant during retinoic acid-induced F9 EC cell differentiation (27Flanagan J.R. Becker K.G. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Driggers P.H. Levi B.Z. Appella E. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Thus, the down-regulation of YY1 during muscle cell differentiation is most likely effected at the protein level. The findings demonstrated above prompted us to examine whether YY1 might be down-regulated by a protease-mediated mechanism during myogenesis. Calpains were first demonstrated in skeletal muscle homogenates (28Huston R.B. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 2116-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and its activity was found to be up-regulated and essential during myogenic differentiation. Of particular note is the down-regulation of YY1 protein during myoblast fusion (24–48 h; Fig.1, top), which has long been known to be mediated by extracellular calcium influx (17David J.D. See W.M. Higginbotham C. Dev. Biol. 1981; 82: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To examine the potential involvement of the Ca2+-calpain system in the degradation of YY1, we set up an in vitro calcium-dependent proteolysis assay using crude myoblast extracts as the source of endogenous calpain. YY1 and its degradation derivatives were detected by YY1 antibody. Fig. 4 shows that no degradation of YY1 was evident upon incubation of YY1 with the crude extract or with the addition of 10–100 μmCa2+ (Fig. 4, left panel). Addition of 1 mm Ca2+, on the other hand, resulted in the appearance of a 40-kDa cleavage product recognized by the YY1 antibody. This finding indicates that YY1 may be a substrate of endogenous calpain II (or m-calpain), which requires millimolar levels of calcium ions for catalytic activity as opposed to calpain I (or μ-calpain), which requires micromolar levels of calcium ions. We further performed the assay using purified calpain II. Fig. 4 (right panel) again shows the appearance of the 40-kDa YY1 cleavage product triggered by the purified calpain II in the presence of 1 mmCa2+. As predicted, calpain II caused no cleavage of YY1 in the absence of Ca2+ or at lower Ca2+concentrations. We went on to determine whether YY1 protein might be stabilized in cells treated with specific calpain inhibitors. Primary myoblasts were used initially to examine the effect of two specific calpain inhibitors, calpeptin and calpain inhibitor II (29Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Banik N. Wilk S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1989-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), on the intracellular level of YY1. However, the primary myoblasts were found to be exquisitely sensitive to the inhibitors, and the treatment resulted in a population consisting largely of fibroblasts (data not shown). This finding presumably indicates a vital role for calpains in maintaining the viability of cultured primary myoblasts. Sol8 myoblasts (30Pinset C. Mulle C. Benoit P. Changeux J. Chelly J. Gros F. Montarras D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2411-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were thus used in the subsequent inhibitor experiments. A panel of cell-permeable protease inhibitors, calpain inhibitor II (29Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Banik N. Wilk S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1989-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), TLCK (inhibitor of trypsin-like serine proteases) (31Tudela J. Garcia-Canovas F. Garcia-Carmona F. Iborra J.L. Lozano J.A. Int. J. Biochem. 1986; 18: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and MG132 (inhibitor of the 26 S proteasome) (32Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27280-27284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) were first examined for their inhibitory effects on calpain II activity using a quantitative in vitroassay described previously (26Buroker-Kilgore M. Wang K.K.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Fig. 5shows that whereas TLCK did not appreciably affect calpain II activity as expected, calpain inhibitor II and MG132, which are similar tripeptide aldehydes consisting of leucine-leucine-methioninal and leucine-leucine-leucinal, respectively, each exhibited a comparable potent dose-dependent inhibition of the caseinolytic activity of calpain II. Thus, MG132 appears to be capable of blocking the activities of both calpains and the proteasome. We went on to determine whether the inhibitors might stabilize YY1 protein in the cell. Sol8 myoblasts were treated with the inhibitors, and Western blots were performed to examine the effect on YY1 protein levels. Inhibitor concentrations for the treatment were optimized such that minimal loss of cell viability was observed after treatment. Fig.6 A shows that whereas YY1 protein levels were not significantly altered by TLCK (54 μm) or calpain inhibitor II (40 μm), incubation of Sol8 myoblasts with 8 μm MG132 consistently increased YY1 protein content at least 2-fold. Prolonged treatment or treatment with higher doses of MG132 led to a rapid loss of myoblast viability (data not shown). Since autoproteolytic activation and catalytic activity of calpains require elevated calcium levels in myoblasts, an event typically associated with myoblast fusion during myogenesis (17David J.D. See W.M. Higginbotham C. Dev. Biol. 1981; 82: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), an effect of the calpain inhibitor on YY1 protein stability may require elevated calcium levels in the cell. To provide evidence along this line, intracellular calpains were stimulated by treating myoblasts with the calcium ionophore A23187, which has been shown to promote myogenesis (14Kumar A. Shafiq S. Wadgaonkar R. Stracher A. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1992; 38: 687-691PubMed Google Scholar) and activate calpains (33Deshpande R.V. Goust J. Chakrabarti A.K. Barbosa E. Hogan E.L. Banik N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2497-2505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Fig.6 B shows that YY1 protein levels were clearly reduced by A23187 in treated Sol8 myoblasts. Calpain inhibitor II as well as MG132 were both able to stabilize YY1 in A23187-treated Sol8 myoblasts. Together, these in vitro and in vivo results strongly suggest the involvement of the Ca2+-calpain circuit in signal-mediated intracellular proteolysis of YY1. That MG132, a well known inhibitor of the 26 S proteasome, was able to stabilize YY1 in myoblasts suggests that YY1 is likely to be a substrate of the proteasome as well. However, the results shown here together with those of others (29Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Banik N. Wilk S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1989-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 34Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark D. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar) indicate that MG132 can inhibit both calpains and the proteasome. To resolve this issue, we further examined the effect of lactacystin, which is highly specific for the proteasome (35Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Reichard G.A. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3358-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that a putative polyubiquitinated YY1 species, which could not be demonstrated in actively growing myoblasts, could be detected in myoblasts deprived of serum (36Mampuru L.J. Chen S.J. Kalenik J.L. Bradley M.E. Lee T.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, myoblasts maintained in growth medium as well as serum-free medium were treated with lactacystin for 30 h, and YY1 protein levels were examined by Western analysis. Fig. 7 shows that whereas lactacystin did not have a significant effect on the stability of YY1 in growing myoblasts (panel A), it increased YY1 protein levels severalfold in serum-starved myoblasts (panel B). To further provide biochemical evidence that YY1 is indeed a ubiquitination substrate, we carried out an in vitroexperiment using rabbit reticulocyte lysates as an established source of ubiquitination enzymes (5Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). In the experiment presented in Fig.8, purified YY1 was first incubated with reticulocyte lysates, and ubiquitination products were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with YY1 antibody. A ladder of protein bands exhibiting slower mobilities relative to the free YY1 protein could be detected, which should correspond to YY1 proteins ligated to one or more ubiquitin moieties. The YY1 C-terminal truncation mutant N200, on the other hand, was not appreciably tagged by ubiquitin as indicated by the absence of ubiquitin conjugate ladders (Fig. 8). We thus conclude that amino acid sequences located within the zinc finger domains of YY1 contain recognition/degradation signals for the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway.Figure 8YY1 is readily ubiquitinated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. 0.1 μg of YY1 (WT) and the C-terminal deletion mutant (N200) were each incubated with reticulocyte lysates as described in the text. Samples were processed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western analysis using YY1 antibody. The position of the free YY1 protein is denoted by ✼.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) That the C-terminal half of YY1, which is rich in PEST residues (Pro, Glu, Ser, and Thr), is required for protein ubiquitination is consistent with the notion that short lived proteins may be proteolytically targeted through these sequences (37Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). However, there is some controversy as to whether the PEST domain of PEST-containing proteins may be required for the action of calpains (1Carillo S. Pariat M. Steff A.M. Roux P. Etienne-Julan M. Lorca T. Piechaczyk M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1679-1689PubMed Google Scholar,38Molinari M. Anagli J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2032-2035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 39Shoshan-Barmatz V. Weil S. Meyer H. Varsanyi M. Heilmeyer L.M.G. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 142: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Inspection of cleavage sites among the substrates of calpains reveals no obvious consensus sequence motif. It is also of interest to determine whether YY1 may be differentially targeted by the proteasome and calpains. Using various YY1 deletion mutants constructed previously (24Kalenik J.L. Chen D. Bradley M.E. Chen S.J. Lee T.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we found that neither the zinc finger nor the PEST domain, both located at the C-terminal half of YY1, was required for calpain action (Fig. 9). Notably, the deletion mutant N152 but not N170 exhibited resistance to calpain cleavage, suggesting that the 20-amino acid domain missing in N170 might play a signaling role in calpain susceptibility of YY1. Our findings indicate that different structural determinants are involved in calpain- and proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Several lines of evidence suggest that calpain II plays an important regulatory role in myogenic differentiation. The increase in calpain II activity coincides with the onset of myoblast differentiation, which is marked by cell membrane fusion and calcium influx (18Kwak K.B. Chung S.S. Kim O.M. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1175: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Exogenously added calpain II was found to promote myoblast fusion (40Brustis J. Elamrani N. Balcerzak D. Safwate A. Soriano M. Poussard S. Cottin P. Ducastaing A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 320-327PubMed Google Scholar). Studies using calpain inhibitors also showed that inhibition of the endogenous calpain can suppress myogenesis (14Kumar A. Shafiq S. Wadgaonkar R. Stracher A. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1992; 38: 687-691PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kwak K.B. Kambayashi J. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although possible roles of calpain II in muscle growth and differentiation have been postulated (6Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Taylor R.G. Christiansen J.A. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 42Schollmeyer J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 163: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the biochemical mechanism underlying its myogenic function is still unclear. The work presented here offers a regulatory mechanism for calpain II through proteolytic cleavage of the multifunctional transcription factor YY1, which is capable of repressing myogenic transcription via its DNA-binding activity (43Gaulberto A. LePage D. Pons G. Mader S. Park K. Atchison M. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4209-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 44Lee T.C. Shi Y. Schwartz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9814-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). A direct in vivo evidence that YY1 can be proteolyzed by calpains is illustrated here by the A23187 experiment, showing stabilization of YY1 protein by calpain inhibitor II in A23187-treated myoblasts. Consistent with this “proteolytic” effect of A23187, this calcium ionophore was found to activate calpains (33Deshpande R.V. Goust J. Chakrabarti A.K. Barbosa E. Hogan E.L. Banik N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2497-2505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and promote myogenesis (17David J.D. See W.M. Higginbotham C. Dev. Biol. 1981; 82: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome system has been extensively studied and found to be involved in the degradation of several transcriptional regulators such as NF-κB (4Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar), c-Jun (45Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar), c-Fos (8Stancovski I. Gonen H. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7106-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), p53 (46Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3410) Google Scholar), and the yeast MATα2 repressor (2Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Our current and previous studies (36Mampuru L.J. Chen S.J. Kalenik J.L. Bradley M.E. Lee T.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) together indicate that YY1 turnover is mediated by calpains as well as the proteasome. We found that MG132, which is generally used as an inhibitor of the proteasome (32Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27280-27284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), is able to stabilize YY1 in treated myoblasts. MG132 and calpain inhibitor II are both tripeptide aldehydes consisting of leucine-leucine-leucinal and leucine-leucine-methioninal, respectively. Thus, the ability of MG132 to inhibit calpains as shown here may not be unexpected. Since MG132 appears to be an inhibitor of both calpains and the proteasome, it is possible that stabilization of YY1 in vivo can be best observed under the condition where both proteolytic pathways are blocked concurrently. This notion is consistent with the findings here that the stabilization of YY1 in vivo by lactacystin can only be observed in serum-starved myoblasts that exhibit elevated proteasome activities (36Mampuru L.J. Chen S.J. Kalenik J.L. Bradley M.E. Lee T.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In cellular processes associated with signal-induced calcium influx (as mimicked by A23187 treatment), calcium-mediated calpain activation may become a major proteolytic driving force. This may explain why stabilization of YY1 by calpain inhibitors can only be observed in A23187-treated myoblasts. The majority of short lived proteins are found to possess one or more domains rich in Pro, Glu, Ser, and Thr residues (PEST domain) (37Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism that PEST regions confer susceptibility to rapid proteolysis remains unclear. The structural features or signals of transcription factors that cause them to be rapidly degraded in vivo remain to be further characterized. We present evidence that calpains and the proteasome utilize different structural elements for substrate targeting. Our finding supports the previous notion that PEST sequences do not influence substrate susceptibility to calpain proteolysis (38Molinari M. Anagli J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2032-2035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Proteolytic targeting by the proteasome on the other hand involves the participation of PEST residues. These differential targeting mechanisms of calpains and the proteasome presumably provide elements of specificity necessary for cellular regulation and allow for a more versatile developmental control module. Whereas the ubiquitin-dependent pathway is well known for its housekeeping function, we propose that the proteasome and calpains may differentially regulate the stability of a protein under different growth conditions and signaling pathways, as demonstrated by the use of A23187 and serum starvation here. Like YY1, the stability of c-Fos and p53 has previously been found to be co-regulated by calpains and the proteasome (8Stancovski I. Gonen H. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7106-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 9Hirai S. Kawasaki H. Yaniv M. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 10Maki C.G.

Aside from the involvement of various proteases in controlling the level of transcription factors, the eukaryotic DNA-binding factor AEBP1 has been found to possess a protease activity (47He G. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, targeting proteases to a transcriptional machinery may represent a unique feature in gene regulation. We thank Cecile Pickart for providing MG132 and helpful comments."

PTPs activity is carefully regulated and appears to be, in most cases, highly specific. The PTPs consist of a family of over 40 enzymes often classified into three groups: 1) receptor-like PTPs; 2) intracellular PTPs; and 3) dual specificity PTPs (2Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the LMW-PTP crystal structure (6Su X.D. Taddei N. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Nordlund P. Nature. 1994; 370: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) revealed a tridimensionally folded phosphate binding loop that is structurally identical to that contained in the human placenta PTP1B and Yersinia PTP (7Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 8Stuckey J.A. Shubert H.L. Fauman E.B. Zhang Z.Y. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar).We have previously demonstrated that the mutation of the cysteine residue in the signature motif to serine (C12S), causes the complete loss of catalytic activity (9Chiarugi P. Marzocchini R. Raugei G. Pazzagli C. Berti A. Camici G. Manao G. Cappugi G. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this dominant negative mutant (dnLMW-PTP) is still able to bind to specific substrates (10Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Camici G. Manao G. Pazzagli L. Caselli A. Barghini I. Cappugi G. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1161: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the active phosphatase (wtLMW-PTP) causes a reduction of cell proliferation (11Berti A. Rigacci S. Raugei G. Degl'Innocenti D. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas dnLMW-PTP induces a remarkable increase in DNA synthesis, indicating that this latter molecule behaves as a dominant negative in vivo (12Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition we have demonstrated that this phenotype is associated with a specific and direct interaction between the active site of dnLMW-PTP and the activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) (13Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Manao G. Taddei L. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the PDGF-R is a specific substrate of the LMW-PTP and that this phosphatase may be involved in the control of one or more signaling pathways triggered by PDGF-R activation.Binding of PDGF induces receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the PDGF-R function as high affinity binding sites for several molecules involved in downstream signal transduction (14Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins bind the phosphorylated receptor through their Src homology domain 2 or phosphotyrosine binding domains, and in many cases are themselves substrates of the receptor kinase activity. These proteins include enzymes such as phospholipase C-γ1 (PLCγ1), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Src, or molecular adapters such as Shc, Grb2, and Nck, leading to different routes that mediate the biological effects of PDGF. One of the main routes leading to cell proliferation is the so-called Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Upon stimulation with growth factors, Ras activation can be achieved through a variety of signal transducers like Shc, Grb2, and Sos (15Bonfini L. Migliaccio E. Pellicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pellicci P.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 258-261Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Syp phosphatase may function as an adapter molecule for Grb2 and therefore activate Ras (16Li W. Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activated Ras triggers a kinase cascade with sequential activation of Raf-1, MAP/ERK, and ERK. Upon activation, ERK translocates to the nucleus where it induces fostranscriptional activation (17Mulcahy L.S. Smith M.R. Stacey D.W. Nature. 1985; 313: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 18Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). An alternative route leading to fos transcription independent of Ras/ERK, is the activation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway, leading to formation of three transcription factors that bind to the fos promoter. These transcription factors, known as sis-inducible factor (SIF) A, B, and C, are STAT-3 homodimers, STAT1/3 heterodimers, and STAT1 homodimers, respectively. In addition, another Ras-independent pathway relevant for mitogenesis is the activation of the cytosolic tyrosine kinase Src. Recently, Barone and Courtneidge (19Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the kinases of the Src family regulate myc activation, and that myc is necessary for PDGF-dependent DNA synthesis in NIH 3T3 cells. In fact, myc but not fos rescue the PDGF-signaling block caused by dominant negative Src. Both the Ras/ERK and the Src pathways are necessary for DNA synthesis in response to PDGF, epidermal growth factor, and colony-stimulating factor-1 (19Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In addition, the Src and STAT pathways seems to be linked (20Yu C.L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 21Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), although it remains to be established if this connection is directly mediated by Src kinase. Finally, other pathways relevant for PDGF mitogenic signaling are PLCγ1 and PI3K. PLCγ1 catalyzes the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate, triggering a cytosolic calcium increase and protein kinase C activation. PI3K is a protein and lipid kinase that activates the product of the proto-oncogene akt, protein kinase Cζ, and other targets, which have been only partially elucidated.In this study, we examine the role of the LMW-PTP in signaling pathways originated by PDGF-R activation. We report that LMW-PTP is involved in the regulation of Myc expression through Src activation, and of Fos through an ERK independent pathway mediated by the STAT proteins.DISCUSSIONRecent data from our laboratory have provided evidence for a role of LMW-PTP in the regulation of PDGF-dependent mitogenesis. In addition, we have reported that the PDGF receptor is a specific in vivo substrate of the LMW-PTP in NIH 3T3 cells and that this phosphatase physically associates with the activated receptor (12Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, no data were available regarding the molecular mechanisms by which the LMW-PTP can shut off the mitogenic signals initiated by PDGF. In this report, we first established that the overexpression of dnLMW-PTP induces a significant shortening of G1 cell cycle phase whereas S and G2/M remain almost unchanged, indicating that the LMW-PTP acts specifically in G1 phase. This is in agreement with the hypothesis that LMW-PTP acts on the activated PDGF receptor (11Berti A. Rigacci S. Raugei G. Degl'Innocenti D. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which is a specific effector of G1 progression. We have also observed that overexpression of the wtLMW-PTP markedly prolongs the doubling time although the changes are not uniquely restricted to the G1 phase. It is possible that overexpression of the active enzyme can artifactually interact with other cellular districts and/or functions, whereas the dnLMW-PTP would cause fewer and more specific perturbations of the physiology of the cells. However, actions on phases of the cell cycle other than G1 cannot be completely ruled out by the present data.The main finding of this study is that in cells transfected with the LMW-PTP not all the pathways originating from the activated PDGF receptor are affected. Rather, this phosphatase appears to be highly specific in modulating the Src and the STATs pathways without interacting with other important routes such as Ras/ERK, PI3K, and PLCγ1. The effects on ERK activation are particularly striking since many extracellular and intracellular effectors may converge at this level. Along these lines, the lack of changes in ERK activity further confirms that neither PI3K nor PLCγ1 are involved in mediating the effects of the LMW-PTP. In fact, PI3K has been shown to signal through routes that are at least in part dependent on Ras (35Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), and activation of PLCγ1 results in the generation of signals that ultimately lead to ERK activation via Ras-dependent and -independent pathways (36L'Allemain G. Sturgill T.W. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. J. Cell. Biol. 1988; 106: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the active and inactive forms of the LMW-PTP determine a reduced or increased activation of both Src and STATs pathways. Furthermore, LMW-PTP prevents the direct association of Src with the tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF receptor. These modifications are associated with similar changes in the nuclear targets of these signaling pathways, namely myc and fos. Therefore, not only LMW-PTP modulate post-receptor signaling, but the resulting modifications are sufficient to affect activation of specific transcription factors.Src kinase transduces PDGF signaling in a ERK-independent manner (19Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Recent results indicate that Src is the starting point of a route that leads to Myc expression, whereas it is not necessary for Ras activation. This so called “Src pathway” is in turn independent of Ras and appears to be required for PDGF-induced DNA synthesis. In fact, microinjection of a dominant negative Myc (Myc In 373) completely inhibits the mitogenic response to PDGF (19Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Furthermore, microinjection of antibodies directed against all three Src kinase family proteins blocks both PDGF-induced Myc expression and entry of NIH 3T3 cells into S phase (38Twamley-Stein G. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7696-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Hence, these data strongly support the hypothesis that myc transcription is under the control of Src family kinases and is required for mitogenesis. Data presented herein indicate that the LMW-PTP is involved in the modulation of the Src pathway activated by the PDGF-R since Src recruitment by the phosphorylated PDGF-R is modified by LMW-PTP overexpression. Src kinase receptor association directly up-regulates its tyrosine kinase activity. It is likely that the modulation in the Src kinase activity observed in LMW-PTP-overexpressing cells is mediated by the LMW-PTP prevention of binding of Src to the receptor. Recent data reported by our group indicate that LMW-PTP is a target of v-Src in vitro (39Rigacci S. Degl'Innocenti D. Bucciantini M. Cirri P. Berti A. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1278-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, we failed to observe a physical interaction between c-Src and either dnLMW-PTP or wtLMW-PTP in vivo. A recent paper reports that the recruitment of the Src tyrosine kinase by PDGF-R leads to decreased PDGF-stimulated chemotaxis directly mediated by PDGF-R Tyr-934 phosphorylation by Src kinase (31Hansen K. Johnell M. Siegbahn A. Rorsman C. Engstrom U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.H. Ronnstrand L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5299-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our data on the modulation of the PDGF chemotactic response by LMW-PTP are in agreement with a specific action of LMW-PTP on the Src-mediated pathways leading to increased mitogenicity through Myc activation and to decreased PDGF-stimulated chemotaxis.Fos activation appears to be strongly implicated in PDGF mitogenic signaling (17Mulcahy L.S. Smith M.R. Stacey D.W. Nature. 1985; 313: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 18Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). Activation of fos transcription by PDGF is mediated by the serum response element (SRE) and the sis-inducible element (SIE) of the promoter. The SRE interacts with the ternary complex factor, whose components Elk-1 and SAP-1 are direct targets of ERK (18Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). Conversely, SIE interacts with proteins of the STAT family, STAT1 and STAT3, which form three transcription factors, namely SIF-A, -B, or -C (30Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). We find that the LMW-PTP modulates Fos expression, which is greater in cells transfected with the dnLMW-PTP and reduced in those expressing wtLMW-PTP. These changes are associated with a modulation of both tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of STAT1 and STAT3. On the other hand, ERK activity, measured by three independent methods, is unaffected by the overexpression of the LMW-PTP. The SRE and the SIE are both able to drive fos transcription in studies using deletion mutants of the promoter and a reporter gene (30Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). However, the relative contribution of the SIE to fos transcription is controversial (40Leaman D.W. Pisharody S. Flickinger T.W. Commane M.A. Schlessinger J. Kerr I.M. Levy D.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Data from the present study provide evidence that Fos expression can be modulated by the STATs pathway in vivoin the absence of any changes in the ERK/SRE pathway, even though the possible contribution of other factors cannot be completely ruled out. Therefore, the effects of the LMW-PTP suggest that both the SRE and the SIE are necessary to achieve optimal fos transcription.The mechanisms involved in the reduced activation of STAT proteins by the LMW-PTP remain to be clarified. Three different Jak kinases, Jak-1, Jak-2, and Tyk-2 have been shown to interact with the PDGF receptor (36L'Allemain G. Sturgill T.W. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of these enzymes is necessary per se to obtain STATs phosphorylation. Recent data indicate that v-Src transformed cells show greater activation of STAT3 (20Yu C.L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 21Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), indicating a possible cross-talk between the Src and the STATs pathways. In addition, we have observed that in PDGF-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells c-Src overexpression leads to an up-regulation of both STAT1 and STAT3 (41Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Marra F. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).In this study we present evidences showing that the activation of both STAT1 and STAT3 are clearly affected by the LMW-PTP, a finding that could be explained by the concomitant action of LMW-PTP on Src activity, thus suggesting that the STATs and Src pathways could be related. However, the direct LMW-PTP action on a Src-independent STATs pathway cannot be excluded.In summary, the results of this study indicate that LMW-PTP decreases PDGF mitogenic signaling by selectively interacting with the Src and the STATs pathway, resulting in modulated expression of myc and fos, two proto-oncogenes crucial for G1progression. Whether the LMW-PTP affects PDGF receptor signal transduction pathways through the dephosphorylation of different receptor tyrosines remains to be established. On the other hand, this phosphatase may directly and specifically interact with only one phosphorylated tyrosine, leading to pleiotropic effects. The available data indicate that LMW-PTP may act as a physiological modulator of the effects of PDGF on cell growth. Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation plays a key role in the regulation of many cellular processes in eukaryotes such as cellular metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, and oncogenic transformation (1van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that the contribution of phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatases (PTPs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTP, phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase; LMW-PTP, low molecular weight PTP; dnLMW-PTP, dominant negative LMW-PTP; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAP-2, microtubule-associated protein 2; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGF-R, PDGF receptor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PLCγ1, phospholipase C γ1; SIE, sis-inducible element; SIF, sis-inducible factor; SRE, serum response element; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; wtLMW-PTP, wild-type LMW-PTP. 1The abbreviations used are: PTP, phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase; LMW-PTP, low molecular weight PTP; dnLMW-PTP, dominant negative LMW-PTP; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAP-2, microtubule-associated protein 2; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGF-R, PDGF receptor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PLCγ1, phospholipase C γ1; SIE, sis-inducible element; SIF, sis-inducible factor; SRE, serum response element; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; wtLMW-PTP, wild-type LMW-PTP. to the control of phosphorylation state is as relevant as that of phosphotyrosine-protein kinases. PTPs activity is carefully regulated and appears to be, in most cases, highly specific. The PTPs consist of a family of over 40 enzymes often classified into three groups: 1) receptor-like PTPs; 2) intracellular PTPs; and 3) dual specificity PTPs (2Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31323-31326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All PTPs share the signature active site motif CXXXXXR, in which the catalytic cysteine residue is involved in formation of a phosphoenzyme reaction intermediate (3Guan H.L. Dixon J.E. Science. 1990; 249: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The low molecular weight phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase (LMW-PTP) is a cytosolic enzyme without extensive sequence homology with other PTPs family members, but it contains the CXXXXXR motif and shares the same catalytic mechanism of classical PTPs (4Cirri P.

Furthermore, the LMW-PTP crystal structure (6Su X.D. Taddei N. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Nordlund P. Nature. 1994; 370: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) revealed a tridimensionally folded phosphate binding loop that is structurally identical to that contained in the human placenta PTP1B and Yersinia PTP (7Barford D.

Saper M.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the mutation of the cysteine residue in the signature motif to serine (C12S), causes the complete loss of catalytic activity (9Chiarugi P. Marzocchini R.

Nevertheless, this dominant negative mutant (dnLMW-PTP) is still able to bind to specific substrates (10Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Camici G. Manao G. Pazzagli L. Caselli A. Barghini I. Cappugi G. Raugei G.

Overexpression of the active phosphatase (wtLMW-PTP) causes a reduction of cell proliferation (11Berti A. Rigacci S. Raugei G. Degl'Innocenti D. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas dnLMW-PTP induces a remarkable increase in DNA synthesis, indicating that this latter molecule behaves as a dominant negative in vivo (12Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition we have demonstrated that this phenotype is associated with a specific and direct interaction between the active site of dnLMW-PTP and the activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) (13Chiarugi P.

Upon activation, ERK translocates to the nucleus where it induces fostranscriptional activation (17Mulcahy L.S. Smith M.R. Stacey D.W.

It is possible that overexpression of the active enzyme can artifactually interact with other cellular districts and/or functions, whereas the dnLMW-PTP would cause fewer and more specific perturbations of the physiology of the cells. However, actions on phases of the cell cycle other than G1 cannot be completely ruled out by the present data.The main finding of this study is that in cells transfected with the LMW-PTP not all the pathways originating from the activated PDGF receptor are affected. Rather, this phosphatase appears to be highly specific in modulating the Src and the STATs pathways without interacting with other important routes such as Ras/ERK, PI3K, and PLCγ1. The effects on ERK activation are particularly striking since many extracellular and intracellular effectors may converge at this level. Along these lines, the lack of changes in ERK activity further confirms that neither PI3K nor PLCγ1 are involved in mediating the effects of the LMW-PTP. In fact, PI3K has been shown to signal through routes that are at least in part dependent on Ras (35Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), and activation of PLCγ1 results in the generation of signals that ultimately lead to ERK activation via Ras-dependent and -independent pathways (36L'Allemain G. Sturgill T.W. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. J. Cell. Biol. 1988; 106: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the active and inactive forms of the LMW-PTP determine a reduced or increased activation of both Src and STATs pathways. Furthermore, LMW-PTP prevents the direct association of Src with the tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF receptor. These modifications are associated with similar changes in the nuclear targets of these signaling pathways, namely myc and fos. Therefore, not only LMW-PTP modulate post-receptor signaling, but the resulting modifications are sufficient to affect activation of specific transcription factors.Src kinase transduces PDGF signaling in a ERK-independent manner (19Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Recent results indicate that Src is the starting point of a route that leads to Myc expression, whereas it is not necessary for Ras activation. This so called “Src pathway” is in turn independent of Ras and appears to be required for PDGF-induced DNA synthesis. In fact, microinjection of a dominant negative Myc (Myc In 373) completely inhibits the mitogenic response to PDGF (19Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Furthermore, microinjection of antibodies directed against all three Src kinase family proteins blocks both PDGF-induced Myc expression and entry of NIH 3T3 cells into S phase (38Twamley-Stein G. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7696-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Hence, these data strongly support the hypothesis that myc transcription is under the control of Src family kinases and is required for mitogenesis. Data presented herein indicate that the LMW-PTP is involved in the modulation of the Src pathway activated by the PDGF-R since Src recruitment by the phosphorylated PDGF-R is modified by LMW-PTP overexpression. Src kinase receptor association directly up-regulates its tyrosine kinase activity. It is likely that the modulation in the Src kinase activity observed in LMW-PTP-overexpressing cells is mediated by the LMW-PTP prevention of binding of Src to the receptor. Recent data reported by our group indicate that LMW-PTP is a target of v-Src in vitro (39Rigacci S. Degl'Innocenti D. Bucciantini M. Cirri P. Berti A. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1278-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, we failed to observe a physical interaction between c-Src and either dnLMW-PTP or wtLMW-PTP in vivo. A recent paper reports that the recruitment of the Src tyrosine kinase by PDGF-R leads to decreased PDGF-stimulated chemotaxis directly mediated by PDGF-R Tyr-934 phosphorylation by Src kinase (31Hansen K. Johnell M. Siegbahn A. Rorsman C. Engstrom U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.H. Ronnstrand L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5299-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our data on the modulation of the PDGF chemotactic response by LMW-PTP are in agreement with a specific action of LMW-PTP on the Src-mediated pathways leading to increased mitogenicity through Myc activation and to decreased PDGF-stimulated chemotaxis.Fos activation appears to be strongly implicated in PDGF mitogenic signaling (17Mulcahy L.S. Smith M.R. Stacey D.W. Nature. 1985; 313: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 18Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). Activation of fos transcription by PDGF is mediated by the serum response element (SRE) and the sis-inducible element (SIE) of the promoter. The SRE interacts with the ternary complex factor, whose components Elk-1 and SAP-1 are direct targets of ERK (18Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). Conversely, SIE interacts with proteins of the STAT family, STAT1 and STAT3, which form three transcription factors, namely SIF-A, -B, or -C (30Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). We find that the LMW-PTP modulates Fos expression, which is greater in cells transfected with the dnLMW-PTP and reduced in those expressing wtLMW-PTP. These changes are associated with a modulation of both tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of STAT1 and STAT3. On the other hand, ERK activity, measured by three independent methods, is unaffected by the overexpression of the LMW-PTP. The SRE and the SIE are both able to drive fos transcription in studies using deletion mutants of the promoter and a reporter gene (30Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). However, the relative contribution of the SIE to fos transcription is controversial (40Leaman D.W. Pisharody S. Flickinger T.W. Commane M.A. Schlessinger J. Kerr I.M. Levy D.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Data from the present study provide evidence that Fos expression can be modulated by the STATs pathway in vivoin the absence of any changes in the ERK/SRE pathway, even though the possible contribution of other factors cannot be completely ruled out. Therefore, the effects of the LMW-PTP suggest that both the SRE and the SIE are necessary to achieve optimal fos transcription.The mechanisms involved in the reduced activation of STAT proteins by the LMW-PTP remain to be clarified. Three different Jak kinases, Jak-1, Jak-2, and Tyk-2 have been shown to interact with the PDGF receptor (36L'Allemain G. Sturgill T.W. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of these enzymes is necessary per se to obtain STATs phosphorylation. Recent data indicate that v-Src transformed cells show greater activation of STAT3 (20Yu C.L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 21Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), indicating a possible cross-talk between the Src and the STATs pathways. In addition, we have observed that in PDGF-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells c-Src overexpression leads to an up-regulation of both STAT1 and STAT3 (41Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Marra F. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).In this study we present evidences showing that the activation of both STAT1 and STAT3 are clearly affected by the LMW-PTP, a finding that could be explained by the concomitant action of LMW-PTP on Src activity, thus suggesting that the STATs and Src pathways could be related. However, the direct LMW-PTP action on a Src-independent STATs pathway cannot be excluded.In summary, the results of this study indicate that LMW-PTP decreases PDGF mitogenic signaling by selectively interacting with the Src and the STATs pathway, resulting in modulated expression of myc and fos, two proto-oncogenes crucial for G1progression. Whether the LMW-PTP affects PDGF receptor signal transduction pathways through the dephosphorylation of different receptor tyrosines remains to be established. On the other hand, this phosphatase may directly and specifically interact with only one phosphorylated tyrosine, leading to pleiotropic effects. The available data indicate that LMW-PTP may act as a physiological modulator of the effects of PDGF on cell growth. Recent data from our laboratory have provided evidence for a role of LMW-PTP in the regulation of PDGF-dependent mitogenesis. In addition, we have reported that the PDGF receptor is a specific in vivo substrate of the LMW-PTP in NIH 3T3 cells and that this phosphatase physically associates with the activated receptor (12Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, no data were available regarding the molecular mechanisms by which the LMW-PTP can shut off the mitogenic signals initiated by PDGF. In this report, we first established that the overexpression of dnLMW-PTP induces a significant shortening of G1 cell cycle phase whereas S and G2/M remain almost unchanged, indicating that the LMW-PTP acts specifically in G1 phase. This is in agreement with the hypothesis that LMW-PTP acts on the activated PDGF receptor (11Berti A. Rigacci S. Raugei G. Degl'Innocenti D. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G.

https://openalex.org/W2020496041,"The polypeptide binding and release cycle of the molecular chaperone DnaK (Hsp70) of Escherichia coli is regulated by the two co-chaperones DnaJ and GrpE. Here, we show that the DnaJ-triggered conversion of DnaK·ATP (T state) to DnaK·ADP·Pi (R state), as monitored by intrinsic protein fluorescence, is monophasic and occurs simultaneously with ATP hydrolysis. This is in contrast with the T→R conversion in the absence of DnaJ which is biphasic, the first phase occurring simultaneously with the hydrolysis of ATP (Theyssen, H., Schuster, H.-P., Packschies, L., Bukau, B., and Reinstein, J. (1996) J. Mol. Biol. 263, 657–670). Apparently, DnaJ not only stimulates ATP hydrolysis but also couples it with conformational changes of DnaK. In the absence of GrpE, DnaJ forms a tight ternary complex with peptide·DnaK·ADP·Pi (Kd = 0.14 μm). However, by monitoring complex formation between DnaK (1 μm) and a fluorophore-labeled peptide in the presence of ATP (1 mm), DnaJ (1 μm), and varying concentrations of the ADP/ATP exchange factor GrpE (0.1–3 μm), substoichiometric concentrations of GrpE were found to shift the equilibrium from the slowly binding and releasing, high-affinity R state of DnaK completely to the fast binding and releasing, low-affinity T state and thus to prevent the formation of a long lived ternary DnaJ· substrate·DnaK·ADP·Pi complex. Under in vivo conditions with an estimated chaperone ratio of DnaK:DnaJ:GrpE = 10:1:3, both DnaJ and GrpE appear to control the chaperone cycle by transient interactions with DnaK.

Heat shock proteins of the Hsp70 family are involved in essential cellular processes such as protein folding (1Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar), the translocation of proteins through biological membranes (2Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar), the oligomeric assembly of proteins (3Knarr G. Gething M.-J. Modrow S. Buchner J. J. Biol.

Hsp70s exert their function in conjunction with cycles of binding and hydrolysis of ATP which for their part are regulated by proteinaceous cofactors. DnaK, the Hsp70 homolog of Escherichia coli, is controlled by the two co-chaperones DnaJ (41 kDa) and GrpE (22 kDa), which if acting together increase the weak ATPase activity of DnaK by 2 orders of magnitude (5Liberek K.

A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Several model cycles for the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE molecular chaperone machinery and their interaction with target polypeptides have been proposed. In two of those models (8Szabo A. Langer T. Schröder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 9Gamer J. Multhaup G. Tomoyasu T. McCarty J.S. Rüdiger S. Schönfeld H.-J. Schirra C. Bujard H. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), DnaJ rather than DnaK interacts first with the substrate polypeptide and targets it for DnaK. Following DnaJ-induced hydrolysis of DnaK·ATP to DnaK· ADP·Pi, a ternary DnaJ·substrate·DnaK·ADP·Pi complex is formed. The ternary complex is thought to be responsible for the chaperone effect by sequestering the substrate protein and thereby preventing it from aggregation (8Szabo A. Langer T. Schröder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). This mechanism requires equimolar concentrations of DnaK and DnaJ for every turn of the chaperone cycle. In another model (6McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), the role of DnaJ is to convert the low-affinity DnaK·ATP form to the high-affinity DnaK·ADP·Pi form, thereby locking the chaperone onto the target polypeptide. In this model, DnaJ may act in a catalytic manner and fulfill its action without forming a stable ternary complex with peptide·DnaK·ATP. Such a catalytic effect of DnaJ has been directly shown in the binding of the ς32heat shock transcription factor to DnaK; DnaJ promotes the binding without becoming itself part of the DnaK·ς32 complex (10Liberek K. Wall D. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6224-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). By measuring the kinetics of the individual steps of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone cycle, we have recently shown that at intracellular concentrations of chaperone and co-chaperones, the rate-limiting step of the cycle is the DnaJ-triggered conversion of the ATP form of DnaK (T state) with low affinity for target peptides to its ADP form (R state) with high affinity for target peptides. The ratio of the rates of the T→R and R→T conversions indicates, that the R state is only a minor form of DnaK (7Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Baici A. Schönfeld H.-J. Gisler S. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Since DnaK in the presence of ATP and the absence of the co-chaperones has no or only a minor chaperone effect (11Schröder H. Langer T. Hartl F.-U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) and since the peptide segment bound to the R state of DnaK is in an extended conformation (12Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar) and thus represents the result of any disaggregating and disentangling action, the power stroke, i.e. the step which underlies the chaperone effect of DnaK, must be the slow ATP-driven T→R conversion. ATP hydrolysis might provide energy for performing conformational work on the peptide during the T→R conversion. In this hypothetical chaperone cycle both the ternary DnaJ·polypeptide· DnaK·ADP·Picomplex and the polypeptide·DnaK·ADP·Pi complex are only short-lived intermediates that are not directly responsible for the chaperone effect (7Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Baici A. Schönfeld H.-J. Gisler S. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The present study investigates the dependence of the chaperone cycle on the concentrations of the co-chaperones. The results support the notion that substoichiometric amounts of DnaJ and GrpE suffice to control the DnaK chaperone cycle. DnaK was purified and prepared for experimentation as described (7Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Baici A. Schönfeld H.-J. Gisler S. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined photometrically with a molar absorption coefficient of ε280 = 14500 m−1cm−1 (14Helleburst H. Uhlén M. Enfors S.O. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5030-5034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified DnaK contained < 0.1 mol of ADP per mol of DnaK (15Feifel B. Sandmeier E. Schönfeld H.-J. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 318-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The concentrations of DnaK stock solutions were in the range of 60 to 115 μm. All concentrations of DnaK and the co-chaperones refer to their protomers. GrpE and DnaJ were prepared as described previously (16Schönfeld H.-J. Schmidt D. Schröder H. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2183-2189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 17Schönfeld H.-J. Schmidt D. Zulauf M. Colloid Polym. Sci. 1995; 99: 7-10Crossref Google Scholar). Their concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. The stock solution of DnaJ was 120 μm in 50 mm Tris chloride, pH 7.7, 100 mm NaCl, and that of GrpE was 240 μmin 50 mm Tris chloride, pH 7.7. The preparations of DnaK and both co-chaperones were more than 95% pure as estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All three proteins were stored at −80 °C. Peptide p5 (CLLLSAPRR) was labeled with the fluorescent reporter group 6-acryloyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (acrylodan) 1The abbreviations used are: acrylodan, 6-acryloyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene; *ATP, [2,5′,8-3H]ATP. (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at the sulfhydryl group of the NH2-terminal cysteine residue to give a-p5 and purified as described (7Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Baici A. Schönfeld H.-J. Gisler S. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the stock solutions of a-p5 were 24–34 μm. All experiments were performed in assay buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.0), if not indicated otherwise, at 25 °C. Fluorescence spectra of the acrylodan-labeled peptide were recorded with a Spex Fluorolog spectrofluorimeter in a 0.2-cm cuvette using excitation slits of 4.6/4.6 nm and emission slits of 18.5/9.2 nm. The excitation wavelength was set at 370 nm. Spectra of the intrinsic fluorescence of DnaK were either recorded with the SPEX spectrofluorimeter with excitation slits of 0.9/0.9 nm and emission slits of 18.5/9.2 nm (experiment of Fig. 1) or a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B spectrofluorimeter in a 1-cm cuvette using excitation and emission slits of 5 nm (experiment of Fig. 2). Excitation wavelength was set in both cases at 290 nm.Figure 2Titration of DnaK with DnaJ in the presence of ATP. 1 μm DnaK in assay buffer containing 1 mm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2 (—, spectrum at bottom) was titrated with increasing concentrations of DnaJ. After each addition and reaching the steady state, the spectrum was recorded. For comparison with Fig. 1, the spectrum of nucleotide-free DnaK is indicated (- - -). The excitation wavelength was 290 nm. Inset, the differences in fluorescence at 340 nm of (DnaK + DnaJ) − DnaK were plotted against the total concentration of DnaJ. Part of the increase in relative fluorescence at high concentrations of DnaJ appears to be due to tyrosine fluorescence of DnaJ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For measuring changes in the fluorescence of acrylodan-labeled peptides, emission was recorded at 500 nm; for following changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of DnaK, emission was recorded at 340 nm. Single-turnover experiments were measured with the SPEX fluorimeter with excitation slits of 0.9/0.9 nm and emission slits of 18.5/9.2 nm (experiment of Fig. 3 B) or the Perkin-Elmer spectrofluorimeter, with excitation and emission slits of both 5 nm (experiment of Fig. 3 A) using a 0.4-cm cuvette with a magnetic stirrer. To ensure rapid mixing, the reactant by which the reaction was started was injected with a syringe. The dead time was thus reduced to approximately 2 s. The experiments of Figs. Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8were performed with a SF-61 stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter (Hi-Tech Scientific, Salisbury, UK) with a dead time of 1 ms. For measuring the fluorescence of labeled target peptides, the excitation wavelength was set at 370 nm and the emission light passed through a GG455 cut-off filter. The kinetic data obtained with the spectrofluorimeters were fitted with the program Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific), which provides the asymptotic standard deviation of the calculated parameters for each evaluation. In the case of the stopped-flow experiments, the average of 3–10 measurements was fitted to a single or double exponential decay or rise function. To preform DnaK·ATP complexes, DnaK was incubated with [2,5′,8-3H]ATP (*ATP; Amersham) for 10 min at 25 °C. The complex was separated from excess *ATP by rapid size-exclusion chromatography with NICK columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at 4 °C in assay buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2 according to McCarty et al.(6McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To determine the rate of γ-phosphate cleavage, 50 μl of complex were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C, and at the indicated times, the reaction was stopped by mixing 5-μl samples with 5 μl of 26 m formic acid. Samples were spotted onto poly(ethyleneimine)-cellulose thin-layer plates, and *ADP was separated from *ATP in 1 m HCOOH/0.7 m LiCl. *ATP and *ADP were quantified by liquid-scintillation counting (5Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). By monitoring changes in the tryptic digestion pattern, three different conformational states of DnaK can be detected, the nucleotide-free state of DnaK and the ADP- and ATP-liganded states (18Buchberger A. Theyssen H. Schröder H. McCarty J.S. Virgallita G. Milkereit P. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16903-16910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Another possibility to discern the different conformational states of DnaK is by following the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of DnaK upon addition of nucleotides. DnaK contains a single tryptophan residue (Trp-102) in its ATPase domain. By this technique, Theyssen et al. (19Theyssen H. Schuster H.-P. Packschies L. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) recently confirmed the existence of three different conformational states of DnaK. We obtained virtually the same results, which among others are reproduced in Fig.1 to facilitate understanding of the experiments below. While addition of ATP to nucleotide-free DnaK (Fig.1, spectrum a) caused a blue shift from 349 to 345 nm and led to a 18% decrease of the relative fluorescence at 349 nm (spectrum b), hydrolysis of DnaK-bound ATP to ADP and Pi reversed the blue shift and increased the fluorescence again to a value 4% higher than that of the nucleotide-free state (spectrum c). In this experiment, a slight excess of ATP over DnaK was used (DnaK, 1 μm; ATP, 1.4 μm). Since both DnaJ and GrpE are devoid of tryptophan (20Bardwell J.C.A. Tilly K. Craig E. King J. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1782-1785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,21Lipinska B. King J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7545-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), effects of the co-chaperones on the tryptophan fluorescence of DnaK can easily be observed. Addition of DnaJ to DnaK in the presence of excess ATP (1 mm) increased the fluorescence at 349 nm from 82% of that of the nucleotide-free state to 90% and reversed the ATP-induced blue shift, resulting in a fluorescence spectrum (Fig. 1, spectrum d) intermediary to the spectra of nucleotide-free and ATP-liganded DnaK (spectra a and b). In a recently published report suggesting a model of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE reaction cycle, DnaJ was also found to increase the fluorescence of DnaK in the presence of ATP. The increase was interpreted as being due to formation of a DnaK·DnaJ complex (22Banecki B. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6137-6143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To further characterize the mode of interaction between DnaK and DnaJ in the presence of ATP, we titrated DnaK with increasing concentrations of DnaJ in the presence of 1 mm ATP (Fig. 2). The increase in fluorescence followed an approximately hyperbolic saturation curve and reached a maximum at about 2 μmDnaJ. On first sight, this increase in fluorescence might indeed be attributed to formation of a DnaK·DnaJ complex. However, another possible explanation is that the increase in fluorescence upon addition of DnaJ is due to an increase in the steady-state concentration of DnaK·ADP·Pi. Raising the concentration of DnaJ increases the rate of DnaJ-stimulated hydrolysis of DnaK·ATP to DnaK·ADP·Pi 2ADP and Pi bind to DnaK with Kd values of 0.13 and 0.45 μm, respectively (19Theyssen H. Schuster H.-P. Packschies L. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). They are thus assumed to be exchanged together against ATP. , whereas the rate of exchange of DnaK-liganded ADP and Piagainst ATP remains unchanged. To test this interpretation, we measured the DnaJ-induced spectral alterations of DnaK at different concentrations of ATP (1 mm, 36 μm, and 1.4 μm; spectra d, e, and f, respectively, in Fig. 1). Lowering the concentration of ATP was expected to slow down ADP/ATP exchange and thus to increase the steady-state concentration of DnaK·ADP·Pi. The increase in fluorescence upon addition of DnaJ indeed depended inversely on the concentration of ATP and reached a maximum under single-turnover conditions when approximately equimolar concentrations of DnaK and ATP prevented ADP/ATP exchange. Under single-turnover conditions, DnaK adopted the same conformation as DnaK which was allowed to hydrolyze bound ATP completely to ADP·Pi in the absence of DnaJ (Fig. 1, spectra f and c). If the T→R conversion was initiated with a substoichiometric concentration of DnaJ (0.2 μm instead of 1 μm), the same result was obtained after 20 min (not shown). Clearly, the DnaJ-induced spectral alterations of DnaK·ATP have to be attributed to hydrolysis of DnaK·ATP to DnaK·ADP·Pi and not to formation of a DnaK·DnaJ complex; in the case of complex formation in the presence of 0.2 μm instead of 1 μm DnaJ, a correspondingly smaller increase in fluorescence of DnaK (1 μm) would ensue. Under single-turnover conditions, substoichiometric concentrations of DnaJ suffice to convert DnaK completely from the ATP- to the ADP-liganded state. This finding implies that DnaJ forms a short-lived complex with DnaK with presumably high on and off rates and low affinity (see below). Thus, the action of DnaJ is that of a catalytic trigger switching on the ATPase activity of one DnaK molecule after the other. In accordance with this notion, the isolation of DnaK·DnaJ complexes has proven most difficult (23Schönfeld, H.-J., and Behlke, J. (1997) in Protein Folding: Catalysts, Accesssory Proteins, and Chaperones (Lorimer, G. H., and Baldwin, T. O., eds), 290, 269–296.Google Scholar). Recently, the change in intrinsic fluorescence accompanying the spontaneous conversion of DnaK·ATP to DnaK·ADP·Pi in the absence of DnaJ was shown to be a two-step process with k1 = 0.0018 s−1 and k2 = 0.007 s−1(19Theyssen H. Schuster H.-P. Packschies L. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Since the rate k1 was virtually identical to the rate of ATP hydrolysis (khyd = 0.0015 s−1), the first step was ascribed to the hydrolysis of ATP and the second step to a subsequent structural change. We have shown previously that the T→R conversion of DnaK (1 μm), triggered by DnaJ (1 μm) and measured under single-turnover conditions, is a monophasic process with kobs = 0.044 s−1 (7Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Baici A. Schönfeld H.-J. Gisler S. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The tryptophan spectrum of the isolated ATPase domain (DnaK1–385) shows only minor changes upon binding of ATP and does not undergo the characteristic ATP-induced blue shift. Therefore, it was concluded that the ATP-induced changes in intrinsic fluorescence of the complete DnaK molecule derive from interaction of the exposed Trp residue (Trp-102) in the ATPase domain with the peptide-binding domain (18Buchberger A. Theyssen H. Schröder H. McCarty J.S. Virgallita G. Milkereit P. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16903-16910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). According to this notion, the DnaJ-triggered changes in fluorescence of DnaK reflect the T→R conversion of DnaK. Because the affinity for peptide ligands is low in T-state DnaK and is enhanced in the R state, the slow T→R transition ought to be observable also by following the binding of a target peptide. We followed the T→R transition under single-turnover conditions by intrinsic fluorescence and compared its rate with that of complex formation between DnaK and the fluorescence-labeled peptide a-p5 in the course of the T→R conversion (Fig.3 A). The nonapeptide p5 (for its sequence, see “Materials and Methods”) corresponds to the main binding site for DnaK of the 23-residue prepiece of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase 3S. Gisler, E. V. Pierpaoli, and P. Christen, manuscript in preparation. ; a-p5 is a high-affinity ligand for DnaK with Kdvalues of 5.1 μm and 0.07 μm in the presence of ATP and ADP plus Pi, respectively (7Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Baici A. Schönfeld H.-J. Gisler S. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The change in intrinsic fluorescence and the binding of the peptide proceeded with virtually the same rate of 0.003 s−1. Under the conditions used, 16 and 93% of a-p5 are expected to be bound to T- and R-state DnaK, respectively. Indeed, during the T→R transition, the overall reaction amplitude was 5.3-fold expanded as compared with the amplitude for the reaction a-p5 + DnaK·ATP before the addition of DnaJ. To explore the temporal relationship between ATP hydrolysis and the T→R conversion, we followed the DnaJ-stimulated single-turnover ATP hydrolysis under the same experimental conditions as for measuring the DnaJ-induced conformational change T→R (Fig. 3 B). Under these conditions, ATP was hydrolyzed with a turnover number of 0.05 (± 0.01) s−1. Thus, ATP hydrolysis occurred with virtually the same rate as the conformational switch T→R (kobs = 0.044 s−1; Ref. 7Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Baici A. Schönfeld H.-J. Gisler S. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Apparently, in the presence of DnaJ unlike in its absence (see above), the conformational changes of DnaK are tightly coupled with ATP hydrolysis. Binding of DnaJ to DnaK has been proposed to stabilize the α-helical lid of the peptide-binding domain of DnaK, thereby favoring the ADP state over the ATP state and promoting hydrolysis (12Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). A low concentration of DnaJ (DnaK, 1.2 μm; DnaJ, 22 nm) was reported previously to shorten the half-life of DnaK-bound ATP from 9.1 to 1.8 min, indicating that DnaJ stimulates the ATPase activity of DnaK in a catalytic manner (10Liberek K. Wall D. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6224-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We measured the DnaJ-induced acceleration of the single-turnover rate of ATP hydrolysis as a function of the concentration of DnaJ (Fig.4). The stimulation depended linearly on the concentration of DnaJ. At concentrations of DnaK and DnaJ of 1 and 0.1 μm, respectively, DnaJ stimulated the ATPase approximately 20-fold. This degree of acceleration is of physiological relevance since the concentrations of DnaK and DnaJ in E. coli are in the micromolar range (20Bardwell J.C.A. Tilly K. Craig E. King J. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1782-1785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Goodsell D.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 203-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), and their ratio is approximately 10:1 (20Bardwell J.C.A. Tilly K. Craig E. King J. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1782-1785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At a concentration of DnaJ of 2 μm, a >900-fold acceleration was reached. The plot of the rate of single-turnover ATP hydrolysis as a function of the concentration of DnaJ indicates the Kd value for DnaJ in the DnaK·ATP·DnaJ complex to be considerably higher than 2 μm (Fig. 4 B), which agrees with the notion of a relatively weak DnaK·ATP-DnaJ interaction. DnaJ is known to form ternary complexes with peptide·DnaK in the presence of ATP (8Szabo A. Langer T. Schröder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 9Gamer J. Multhaup G. Tomoyasu T. McCarty J.S. Rüdiger S. Schönfeld H.-J. Schirra C. Bujard H. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 25Liberek K. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11019-11023Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar,26Wawrzynów A. Banecki B. Wall D. Liberek K. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19307-19311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To examine whether DnaJ also forms a ternary complex with peptide a-p5 and DnaK in the presence of ADP and Pi, a-p5·DnaK·ADP·Pi complex was preformed under conditions such that all peptide was bound. Addition of DnaJ to the preformed complex indeed led to a further increase in fluorescence in the region from 440 to 500 nm and was accompanied by a blue shift from 500 to 484 nm, indicating an additional interaction between the label of DnaK-bound peptide and DnaJ (Fig. 5). From the titration of a-p5·DnaK·ADP·Pi with DnaJ, a Kd value of 0.14 μm was calculated. The Kd value in the presence of a target peptide is at least 15-fold lower than the estimated Kd value of the DnaK·ATP·DnaJ complex (Kd > 2 μm; see Fig. 4 B). The latter high Kd value apparently reflects the low affinity between DnaJ and T-state DnaK, whereas the Kd value of 0.14 μm corresponds to the affinity of DnaJ for the peptide-liganded R state. Since peptide a-p5 is short (9 residues), a large portion of the peptide chain (5 to 7 residues; Ref. 12Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar) can be assumed to interact with the peptide binding domain of R-state DnaK and to be inaccessible for direct binding of DnaJ. DnaJ has been shown to trigger the conversion of DnaK from the fast one-step-binding, low-affinity T state to the slow two-step-binding, high-affinity R state by stimulating hydrolysis of DnaK-bound ATP to ADP·Pi (6McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 7Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Baici A. Schönfeld H.-J. Gisler S. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To test the effect of varying concentrations of DnaJ on peptide binding of DnaK, we measured the rate of complex formation between a-p5 (50 nm) and DnaK (1 μm) in the presence of excess ATP (1 mm) and varying concentrations of DnaJ (0–3 μm). The fast one-step reaction for the a-p5·DnaK complex formation in the absence of DnaJ was transformed to a slow two-step process already at 0.1 μm DnaJ, indicative of conversion of DnaK from the T to the R state (Fig. 6). At all concentrations of DnaJ from 0.2 to 3 μm, the rate kobs1 of the faster first phase was reduced 20-fold compared with that of complex formation in the absence of DnaJ. As expected from previous experiments (see above), substoichiometric concentrations of DnaJ suffice to convert DnaK to the slow binding- and releasing-, high-affinity R state. The data should not be taken to indicate that, under the conditions used (1 mm ATP), all DnaK is converted to the R state; particularly at low DnaJ concentrations, the rate of spontaneous ADP/ATP exchange will suffice to maintain a fraction of the chaperone in the T state (see above). At equimolar concentrations of DnaK and the two co-chaperones, GrpE reverses the DnaJ-induced conformational switch of DnaK from the T to the R state, indicating that the GrpE-mediated ADP/ATP exchange is faster than the DnaJ-triggered hydrolysis of DnaK-bound ATP (7Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Baici A. Schönfeld H.-J. Gisler S. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To titrate this effect of GrpE, the formation of the a-p5·DnaK complex in the presence of ATP was followed at constant concentrations of DnaK and DnaJ (1 μm each) and varying concentrations of GrpE (Fig. 7 A). The rate kobs, in the case of a single-step process, or kobs1, in the case of a double-step process, and the total reaction amplitudes were determined. The rate for the first phase increased at least 110-fold at 0.5 μm GrpE compared with the reaction without GrpE (Fig. 7 B). Apparently, catalytic concentrations of GrpE maintain DnaK in its fast-binding-and-releasing T state. A further increase in the concentration of GrpE decelerated the binding reaction. This observation was supported by analysis of the amplitudes of the reaction curves. The reaction amplitudes correspond to the concentration of a-peptide·DnaK complex and therefore correlate with the affinity of DnaK to a-p5 (7Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Baici A. Schönfeld H.-J. Gisler S. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). At 0.1 μm GrpE, the amplitude decreased approximately 4.5-fold as compared with the reaction in the absence of GrpE and remained on this level also at higher GrpE-concentrations. Obviously, already substoichiometric concentrations of GrpE completely converted DnaK to its T state and prevented the formation of the ternary DnaJ·a-p5·DnaK·ADP·Pi complex. To test what concentrations of DnaJ were required to overcome the effect of GrpE, we measured the formation of the a-p5·DnaK complex in the presence of ATP, constant concentrations of DnaK and GrpE (both 1 μm) and varying concentrations of DnaJ (Fig.8). As shown in Fig. 7 A, curve e, at 1-μm concentrations of all chaperones, DnaK is in the fast binding and fast releasing T state. By increasing the concentration of DnaJ, DnaK should increasingly be converted to the R state. A concentration of 3 μm DnaJ was needed at 1 μm GrpE to approximate the rate kobs of the first phase of complex formation between a-p5 and DnaK to that in the absence of GrpE. The DnaJ-overriding effect of GrpE can also be observed by the tryptophan fluorescence of DnaK (7Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Baici A. Schönfeld H.-J. Gisler S. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Addition of stoichiometric concentrations of GrpE to DnaK·ADP·Pi, produced by DnaJ-triggered hydrolysis of DnaK·ATP in the presence of 1 mm ATP decreased the fluorescence exactly to that of DnaK in the presence of ATP alone, 4E. V. Pierpaoli, E. Sandmeier, and P. Christen, unpublished data. indicating that GrpE converted DnaK from the R state back to the T state. Almost the same effect was obtained using substoichiometric concentrations of GrpE, confirming the notion of GrpE acting in a catalytic manner. The aim of this study was to gain more detailed insight into the regulation of the DnaK chaperone cycle by the co-chaperones DnaJ and GrpE. In particular, the question was addressed whether the co-chaperones participate in a stoichiometric manner in the chaperone cycle as proposed in several hypothetical models or whether they rather serve as regulatory catalysts."
https://openalex.org/W2074449593,"Numerous macrophage-restricted promoters lack TATA boxes or other conventional initiation motifs but contain high affinity binding sites (PU boxes) for the macrophage-restricted Ets family transcription factor PU.1. In RAW264 murine macrophages, multimerized PU boxes were not active as enhancers when placed upstream of a minimal promoter. To model their role in basal promoters, we inserted PU boxes into a promoterless luciferase reporter plasmid. Two sites, regardless of orientation, were necessary and sufficient to direct reporter gene expression in transient transfections of the RAW264 macrophage-like cell line. This activity was absent in transfected 3T3 fibroblasts but could be induced by PU.1 coexpression. Both the model promoter and the macrophage-specific mouse and human c-<i>fms</i> promoters were activated in RAW264 cells by other Ets family transcription factors, Ets-2 and Elf-1. In fibroblasts, the effects of PU.1 and Ets-2 were multiplicative, whereas overexpression of PU.1 in RAW264 cells reduced activation of c-<i>fms</i> or model promoters by the other Ets factors. The PU.1 and Ets-2 binding sites of the mouse c-<i>fms</i> promoter have been located by DNase footprinting. A conserved Ets-like motif at the transcription site, CAGGAAC, that bound only weakly to PU.1, was identified as an additional critical basal c-<i>fms</i> promoter element. Comparison of studies on the model promoter, c-<i>fms</i> and other myeloid promoters provides evidence for a conserved mechanism that involves three separate and functionally distinct Ets-like motifs."

SMAP is a human counterpart of mouse KAP3 (kinesin superfamily-associated protein) that forms a complex with mouse KIF3A/B (a kinesin superfamily protein) (2Yamazaki H. Nakata T. Okada Y. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8443-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).

Smg GDS is a regulator that stimulates the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of a group of small G proteins, including the Rho and Rap1 family members and Ki-Ras (4Kaibuchi K. Mizuno T. Fujioka H.

The interaction of SMAP with Smg GDS is regulated by the phosphorylation of SMAP by v-Src kinase (1Shimizu K. Kawabe H. Minami S. Honda T. Takaishi K. Shirataki H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27013-27017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is suggested that SMAP/KAP3 binds to the cargo and regulates the binding of KIF3A/B to its cargo and that SMAP/KAP3 links KIF3A/B to the Smg GDS-regulated small G proteins and Src kinase signalings. However, the precise function of SMAP/KAP3 remains unknown. One way to further clarify the mode of action of SMAP/KAP3 is to isolate a SMAP/KAP3-interacting protein(s).We attempted here to isolate a SMAP-interacting protein from a human B-cell cDNA library by use of the yeast two-hybrid method, identified it to be a human homolog of Xenopus XCAP-E (Xenopus chromosome-associated polypeptide), and named it HCAP (Humanchromosome-associated polypeptide). XCAP-E is an SMC (stability ofminichromosomes) family member (6Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The SMC family members are found in a range of organisms from yeast to mammal and required for the chromosome dynamics, including chromosome condensation, chromosome segregation, and X chromosome dosage compensation (for reviews, see Refs. 7Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Swedlow J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and 8Koshland D. Strunnikov A.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 305-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). For instance, Xenopus XCAP-C and -E are required for both the assembly and structural maintenance of mitotic chromosomes (6Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), and mutants of SMC1 and SMC2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are defective in proper segregation of mitotic chromosomes (9Strunnikov A.V. Hogan E. Koshland D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 597-599Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that SMAP/KAP3 plays a role in the interaction of chromosomes with an ATPase motor protein.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe first attempted to isolate a SMAP-interacting protein from a human B-cell cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid method with SMAP as bait. Among 4 × 105 total transformants, nine clones were positive for the screening. DNA sequencing of the insert DNAs of these clones revealed that three clones (1.4 kilobase pairs) were identical and encoded a novel amino acid sequence, which was homologous to Xenopus XCAP-E, an SMC family member (6Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Since all the isolated clones were truncated forms, we next isolated the full-length cDNA clone from a human brain cDNA library using the positive clone as a probe and determined its nucleotide sequence. The encoded protein consisted of 1,217 aa with a calculated Mr of 141,540 and was named HCAP (accession number AF020043) (Fig. 1 A). The neighboring sequence of the first ATG was consistent with the translation initiation start site proposed by Kozak (14Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar), and in-frame stop codons were present upstream of the first ATG. Moreover, the position of the in vitro translated product of full-length HCAP was similar to that of endogenous HCAP on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). We have concluded from these results that the isolated clone contains the open reading frame of HCAP. An initial data base search demonstrated that HCAP shared 53, 41, and 22% overall amino acid sequence identities with Drosophila DCAP (15Hong C.S. Ganetzky B. Genetics. 1996; 142: 879-892PubMed Google Scholar), Aspergillus SUDA (16Holt C.L. May G.S. Genetics. 1996; 142: 777-787PubMed Google Scholar), and Xenopus XCAP-E, respectively. DCAP and SUDA are also SMC family members (15Hong C.S. Ganetzky B. Genetics. 1996; 142: 879-892PubMed Google Scholar, 16Holt C.L. May G.S. Genetics. 1996; 142: 777-787PubMed Google Scholar). HCAP had a head-rod-tail structural organization, which the SMC family members commonly have (Fig. 1 B) (7Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Swedlow J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 8Koshland D. Strunnikov A.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 305-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The head contained an NTP-binding motif and the tail contained a DA-box. These results indicate that HCAP is an SMC family member. Recently, the full sequence of the rat basement membrane-chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan was directly submitted to GenBank™ (accession number U82626). The cDNA of this protein was isolated by screening the cDNA expression library with polyclonal antiserum raised against basement membrane proteoglycans, and the properties of this protein were not reported (17Couchman J.R. Kapoor R. Sthanam M. Wu R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9595-9602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), but this protein shared 98% amino acid sequence identity with HCAP.We confirmed using the yeast two-hybrid method that the isolated HCAP indeed interacted with SMAP (Fig.2 A). In these experiments, the N-terminal two-thirds of SMAP (1–562 aa) and the C-terminal one-third of HCAP (865–1217 aa) were used. Ras(G12V) and Raf, known to interact in the yeast two-hybrid method (18Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar), were used as positive controls. Moreover, we examined using the recombinant samples whether HCAP directly interacts with SMAP in a cell-free system. MBP-SMAP bound to GST-HCAP, but not to GST (Fig. 2 B). MBP did not bind to GST-HCAP (data not shown). These results indicate that SMAP directly interacts with HCAP.Figure 2Interaction of SMAP with HCAP. A,interaction of SMAP with HCAP in the yeast two-hybrid method. The yeast reporter strain L40 containing pLexA-SMAP or pLexA-Ras(G12V) was transformed with pACTII-HK-HCAP (865–1217 aa), pACTII-HK, or pVP16-Raf. The resultant transformants were stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-d-galactopyranoside for β-galactosidase activity (1Shimizu K. Kawabe H. Minami S. Honda T. Takaishi K. Shirataki H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27013-27017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). B, direct interaction of SMAP with HCAP in a cell-free system. MBP-SMAP was incubated with GST-HCAP or GST and the mixture was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose column. Equal amounts of the eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by protein staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Lane 1, with GST; lane 2, with GST-HCAP. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Western blot analysis using the anti-HCAP antibody detected only an ∼140-kDa protein in all the rat tissues examined and the molecular mass was similar to a Mr value calculated from the open reading frame (Fig.3 A). The subcellular distribution of HCAP in intact COS-7 cells indicated that HCAP was highly concentrated in the nuclear fraction and hardly detected in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 3 B). Both SMAP and KIF3B were detected in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Immunostaining of COS-7 cells with the anti-HCAP antibody showed that HCAP was localized on mitotic chromosomes (Fig. 3 C). Chromosomes were not stained with preimmune rabbit IgG (data not shown). These results suggest that SMAP forms a complex with HCAP and/or KIF3A/B in the nucleus.Figure 3Tissue and subcellular distributions of HCAP. A, tissue distribution. The homogenates (60 μg of protein) of various rat tissues were Western blotted using the anti-HCAP antibody. Lanes 1–6, brain, testis, lung, spleen, liver, and kidney, respectively. The arrow indicates the position of HCAP. B, subcellular distribution in COS-7 cells. Forty μg of protein per each lane was Western blotted with each indicated antibody. Adaptin and lamin were used as cytoplasmic and nuclear markers, respectively (26Neufeld K.L. White R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The results shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We, therefore, examined whether SMAP interacts with HCAP and/or KIF3A/B in the nuclear fraction. It has been shown that hydrolysis of ATP disrupts the interaction of an ATPase protein(s) with other protein(s): myosin I ATPase is extracted from an actin filament in the presence of Mg-ATP (19Howe C.L. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 974-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); and NSF ATPase is extracted from a complex of SNAPs and SNAP receptors in the presence of Mg-ATP (20Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has recently been reported that 13 S condensin, a complex containing XCAP-C and -E, has a DNA-stimulated ATPase activity and that the XCAP-C and -E subunits are indispensable for this activity (21Kimura K. Hirano T. Cell. 1997; 90: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that HCAP and/or KIF3A/B should be extracted with SMAP from the nuclear fraction in the presence of Mg-ATP. When the nuclear fraction of COS-7 cells was incubated in the presence of Mg-ATP, SMAP, HCAP, and KIF3B were extracted (Fig.4 A). None of these proteins was extracted in the absence of Mg-ATP. Most of SMAP and KIF3B, but only a small amount of HCAP, were extracted. Furthermore, SMAP and KIF3B were coimmunoprecipitated with HCAP with the anti-HCAP antibody from the Mg-ATP extract (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that SMAP forms a ternary complex with HCAP and KIF3A/B in the nucleus and that hydrolysis of ATP by HCAP and/or KIF3A/B disrupts their interactions with other proteins. The reason why only a small amount of HCAP was extracted is not known, but since it was estimated by Western blotting that in the nuclear fraction, the amount of HCAP was about 10-fold more than that of SMAP, only the SMAP·HCAP·KIF3A/B complex might be extracted.Figure 4Ternary complex formation of SMAP with HCAP and KIF3B.

The Mg-ATP extract was subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-HCAP antibody or a preimmune rabbit IgG and Western blotted with each indicated antibody. Lane 1, with the preimmune rabbit IgG; lane 2, with the anti-HCAP antibody. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Our present results indicate that SMAP forms a ternary complex with KIF3B and HCAP, a human SMC family member, and suggest that this ternary complex is associated with unknown proteins in the nucleus. XCAP-E forms at least two major complexes, 8 and 13 S condensins, and 8 S condensin contains two SMC family members, XCAP-C and -E, whereas 13 S condensin contains three subunits, XCAP-D2, -G, and -H, in addition to XCAP-C and -E (22Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). 13 S condensin is required for chromosome condensation, but the function of 8 S condensin remains unknown (22Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recombination protein complex (RC-1) purified from calf thymus contains two SMC family members, the 160- and 130-kDa polypeptides, and two additional subunits, DNA polymerase ε and DNA ligase III (23Jessberger R. Riwar B. Baechtold H. Akhmedov A.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4061-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The 160- and 130-kDa polypeptides alone exhibit a DNA reannealing activity, whereas RC-1 has the activity to catalyze recombinational repair of double strand gaps and deletions in DNA in addition to the DNA reannealing activity (23Jessberger R. Riwar B. Baechtold H. Akhmedov A.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4061-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is likely that an SMC family member interacts with different sets of subunits, thereby modifying and acquiring its unique functions. The SMAP·HCAP·KIF3A/B complex might have a novel function, different from those thus far reported in the SMC family members.We have shown here that HCAP is associated with mitotic chromosomes as described for XCAP-E (6Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 22Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Sea urchin kinesin II is associated with pericentriolar and intranuclear regions during prophase, with kinetochore-to-pole microtubules near the kinetochores during metaphase (24Henson J.H. Cole D.G. Terasaki M. Rashid D. Scholey J.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting that a mammalian counterpart, KIF3A/B, also binds to the spindle and plays a role in mitosis. Taken together, it is likely that HCAP forms a complex with SMAP and KIF3A/B in the interphase nucleus and that during mitosis the complex tethers chromosomes to the spindle and plays a role in chromosome movement, like the microtubule-dependent motor CENP-E (25Yao X. Anderson K.L. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Further study is necessary to clarify the function of the SMAP·HCAP·KIF3A/B complex in the nucleus. We have isolated SMAP (Smg GDS-associatedprotein; Smg GDS: small G proteinGDP dissociation stimulator) as a novel Smg GDS-associated protein, which has Armadillo repeats and is tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src tyrosine kinase (1Shimizu K. Kawabe H. Minami S. Honda T. Takaishi K. Shirataki H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27013-27017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). SMAP is a human counterpart of mouse KAP3 (kinesin superfamily-associated protein) that forms a complex with mouse KIF3A/B (a kinesin superfamily protein) (2Yamazaki H. Nakata T. Okada Y. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8443-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). KIF3A and KIF3B form a heterodimer that functions as a microtubule-based fast anterograde translocator of membranous organelles (3Yamazaki H. Nakata T. Okada Y. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1387-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The head domain of KIF3A/B, containing the ATPase activity, binds to a microtubule and the tail domain binds to KAP3 (2Yamazaki H. Nakata T. Okada Y. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8443-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 3Yamazaki H. Nakata T. Okada Y. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1387-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Smg GDS is a regulator that stimulates the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of a group of small G proteins, including the Rho and Rap1 family members and Ki-Ras (4Kaibuchi K. Mizuno T. Fujioka H. Yamamoto T. Kishi K. Fukumoto Y. Hori Y. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2873-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 5Mizuno T. Kaibuchi K. Yamamoto T. Kawamura M. Sakoda T. Fujioka H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6442-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The interaction of SMAP with Smg GDS is regulated by the phosphorylation of SMAP by v-Src kinase (1Shimizu K. Kawabe H. Minami S. Honda T. Takaishi K. Shirataki H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27013-27017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is suggested that SMAP/KAP3 binds to the cargo and regulates the binding of KIF3A/B to its cargo and that SMAP/KAP3 links KIF3A/B to the Smg GDS-regulated small G proteins and Src kinase signalings. However, the precise function of SMAP/KAP3 remains unknown. One way to further clarify the mode of action of SMAP/KAP3 is to isolate a SMAP/KAP3-interacting protein(s). We attempted here to isolate a SMAP-interacting protein from a human B-cell cDNA library by use of the yeast two-hybrid method, identified it to be a human homolog of Xenopus XCAP-E (Xenopus chromosome-associated polypeptide), and named it HCAP (Humanchromosome-associated polypeptide). XCAP-E is an SMC (stability ofminichromosomes) family member (6Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The SMC family members are found in a range of organisms from yeast to mammal and required for the chromosome dynamics, including chromosome condensation, chromosome segregation, and X chromosome dosage compensation (for reviews, see Refs. 7Hirano T.

Biol. 1996; 12: 305-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). For instance, Xenopus XCAP-C and -E are required for both the assembly and structural maintenance of mitotic chromosomes (6Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), and mutants of SMC1 and SMC2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are defective in proper segregation of mitotic chromosomes (9Strunnikov A.V. Hogan E. Koshland D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 597-599Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that SMAP/KAP3 plays a role in the interaction of chromosomes with an ATPase motor protein. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe first attempted to isolate a SMAP-interacting protein from a human B-cell cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid method with SMAP as bait. Among 4 × 105 total transformants, nine clones were positive for the screening. DNA sequencing of the insert DNAs of these clones revealed that three clones (1.4 kilobase pairs) were identical and encoded a novel amino acid sequence, which was homologous to Xenopus XCAP-E, an SMC family member (6Hirano T.

Since all the isolated clones were truncated forms, we next isolated the full-length cDNA clone from a human brain cDNA library using the positive clone as a probe and determined its nucleotide sequence. The encoded protein consisted of 1,217 aa with a calculated Mr of 141,540 and was named HCAP (accession number AF020043) (Fig. 1 A). The neighboring sequence of the first ATG was consistent with the translation initiation start site proposed by Kozak (14Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar), and in-frame stop codons were present upstream of the first ATG. Moreover, the position of the in vitro translated product of full-length HCAP was similar to that of endogenous HCAP on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). We have concluded from these results that the isolated clone contains the open reading frame of HCAP. An initial data base search demonstrated that HCAP shared 53, 41, and 22% overall amino acid sequence identities with Drosophila DCAP (15Hong C.S. Ganetzky B.

DCAP and SUDA are also SMC family members (15Hong C.S. Ganetzky B. Genetics. 1996; 142: 879-892PubMed Google Scholar, 16Holt C.L. May G.S. Genetics. 1996; 142: 777-787PubMed Google Scholar). HCAP had a head-rod-tail structural organization, which the SMC family members commonly have (Fig. 1 B) (7Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Swedlow J.R. Curr. Opin.

The head contained an NTP-binding motif and the tail contained a DA-box. These results indicate that HCAP is an SMC family member. Recently, the full sequence of the rat basement membrane-chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan was directly submitted to GenBank™ (accession number U82626). The cDNA of this protein was isolated by screening the cDNA expression library with polyclonal antiserum raised against basement membrane proteoglycans, and the properties of this protein were not reported (17Couchman J.R. Kapoor R. Sthanam M. Wu R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9595-9602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), but this protein shared 98% amino acid sequence identity with HCAP.We confirmed using the yeast two-hybrid method that the isolated HCAP indeed interacted with SMAP (Fig.2 A). In these experiments, the N-terminal two-thirds of SMAP (1–562 aa) and the C-terminal one-third of HCAP (865–1217 aa) were used. Ras(G12V) and Raf, known to interact in the yeast two-hybrid method (18Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar), were used as positive controls. Moreover, we examined using the recombinant samples whether HCAP directly interacts with SMAP in a cell-free system. MBP-SMAP bound to GST-HCAP, but not to GST (Fig. 2 B). MBP did not bind to GST-HCAP (data not shown). These results indicate that SMAP directly interacts with HCAP.Western blot analysis using the anti-HCAP antibody detected only an ∼140-kDa protein in all the rat tissues examined and the molecular mass was similar to a Mr value calculated from the open reading frame (Fig.3 A). The subcellular distribution of HCAP in intact COS-7 cells indicated that HCAP was highly concentrated in the nuclear fraction and hardly detected in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 3 B). Both SMAP and KIF3B were detected in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Immunostaining of COS-7 cells with the anti-HCAP antibody showed that HCAP was localized on mitotic chromosomes (Fig. 3 C). Chromosomes were not stained with preimmune rabbit IgG (data not shown). These results suggest that SMAP forms a complex with HCAP and/or KIF3A/B in the nucleus.Figure 3Tissue and subcellular distributions of HCAP. A, tissue distribution. The homogenates (60 μg of protein) of various rat tissues were Western blotted using the anti-HCAP antibody. Lanes 1–6, brain, testis, lung, spleen, liver, and kidney, respectively. The arrow indicates the position of HCAP. B, subcellular distribution in COS-7 cells. Forty μg of protein per each lane was Western blotted with each indicated antibody. Adaptin and lamin were used as cytoplasmic and nuclear markers, respectively (26Neufeld K.L. White R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been shown that hydrolysis of ATP disrupts the interaction of an ATPase protein(s) with other protein(s): myosin I ATPase is extracted from an actin filament in the presence of Mg-ATP (19Howe C.L. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 974-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); and NSF ATPase is extracted from a complex of SNAPs and SNAP receptors in the presence of Mg-ATP (20Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has recently been reported that 13 S condensin, a complex containing XCAP-C and -E, has a DNA-stimulated ATPase activity and that the XCAP-C and -E subunits are indispensable for this activity (21Kimura K. Hirano T. Cell. 1997; 90: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that HCAP and/or KIF3A/B should be extracted with SMAP from the nuclear fraction in the presence of Mg-ATP. When the nuclear fraction of COS-7 cells was incubated in the presence of Mg-ATP, SMAP, HCAP, and KIF3B were extracted (Fig.4 A). None of these proteins was extracted in the absence of Mg-ATP. Most of SMAP and KIF3B, but only a small amount of HCAP, were extracted. Furthermore, SMAP and KIF3B were coimmunoprecipitated with HCAP with the anti-HCAP antibody from the Mg-ATP extract (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that SMAP forms a ternary complex with HCAP and KIF3A/B in the nucleus and that hydrolysis of ATP by HCAP and/or KIF3A/B disrupts their interactions with other proteins. The reason why only a small amount of HCAP was extracted is not known, but since it was estimated by Western blotting that in the nuclear fraction, the amount of HCAP was about 10-fold more than that of SMAP, only the SMAP·HCAP·KIF3A/B complex might be extracted.Figure 4Ternary complex formation of SMAP with HCAP and KIF3B.

XCAP-E forms at least two major complexes, 8 and 13 S condensins, and 8 S condensin contains two SMC family members, XCAP-C and -E, whereas 13 S condensin contains three subunits, XCAP-D2, -G, and -H, in addition to XCAP-C and -E (22Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). 13 S condensin is required for chromosome condensation, but the function of 8 S condensin remains unknown (22Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recombination protein complex (RC-1) purified from calf thymus contains two SMC family members, the 160- and 130-kDa polypeptides, and two additional subunits, DNA polymerase ε and DNA ligase III (23Jessberger R. Riwar B. Baechtold H. Akhmedov A.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4061-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The 160- and 130-kDa polypeptides alone exhibit a DNA reannealing activity, whereas RC-1 has the activity to catalyze recombinational repair of double strand gaps and deletions in DNA in addition to the DNA reannealing activity (23Jessberger R. Riwar B. Baechtold H. Akhmedov A.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4061-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is likely that an SMC family member interacts with different sets of subunits, thereby modifying and acquiring its unique functions. The SMAP·HCAP·KIF3A/B complex might have a novel function, different from those thus far reported in the SMC family members.We have shown here that HCAP is associated with mitotic chromosomes as described for XCAP-E (6Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 22Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Sea urchin kinesin II is associated with pericentriolar and intranuclear regions during prophase, with kinetochore-to-pole microtubules near the kinetochores during metaphase (24Henson J.H. Cole D.G. Terasaki M. Rashid D. Scholey J.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting that a mammalian counterpart, KIF3A/B, also binds to the spindle and plays a role in mitosis. Taken together, it is likely that HCAP forms a complex with SMAP and KIF3A/B in the interphase nucleus and that during mitosis the complex tethers chromosomes to the spindle and plays a role in chromosome movement, like the microtubule-dependent motor CENP-E (25Yao X. Anderson K.L. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Further study is necessary to clarify the function of the SMAP·HCAP·KIF3A/B complex in the nucleus. We first attempted to isolate a SMAP-interacting protein from a human B-cell cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid method with SMAP as bait. Among 4 × 105 total transformants, nine clones were positive for the screening. DNA sequencing of the insert DNAs of these clones revealed that three clones (1.4 kilobase pairs) were identical and encoded a novel amino acid sequence, which was homologous to Xenopus XCAP-E, an SMC family member (6Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Since all the isolated clones were truncated forms, we next isolated the full-length cDNA clone from a human brain cDNA library using the positive clone as a probe and determined its nucleotide sequence. The encoded protein consisted of 1,217 aa with a calculated Mr of 141,540 and was named HCAP (accession number AF020043) (Fig. 1 A). The neighboring sequence of the first ATG was consistent with the translation initiation start site proposed by Kozak (14Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar), and in-frame stop codons were present upstream of the first ATG. Moreover, the position of the in vitro translated product of full-length HCAP was similar to that of endogenous HCAP on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). We have concluded from these results that the isolated clone contains the open reading frame of HCAP. An initial data base search demonstrated that HCAP shared 53, 41, and 22% overall amino acid sequence identities with Drosophila DCAP (15Hong C.S. Ganetzky B. Genetics. 1996; 142: 879-892PubMed Google Scholar), Aspergillus SUDA (16Holt C.L. May G.S. Genetics. 1996; 142: 777-787PubMed Google Scholar), and Xenopus XCAP-E, respectively. DCAP and SUDA are also SMC family members (15Hong C.S. Ganetzky B. Genetics. 1996; 142: 879-892PubMed Google Scholar, 16Holt C.L. May G.S. Genetics. 1996; 142: 777-787PubMed Google Scholar). HCAP had a head-rod-tail structural organization, which the SMC family members commonly have (Fig. 1 B) (7Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Swedlow J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 8Koshland D. Strunnikov A.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 305-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar).

Here, we report the molecular cloning and the functional characterization of the human ortholog of the hamster doc-1 gene. Human doc-1 cDNA is 1.6 kilobase pairs in length and encodes for a 115-amino acid polypeptide (12.4 kDa, pI 9.53). Sequence analysis showed 98% identity between human and hamster doc-1protein sequences. DOC-1 is expressed in all normal human tissues examined. In oral keratinocytes, expression of DOC-1 is restricted to normal oral keratinocytes. By immunostaining of normal human mucosa, DOC-1 is detected in both the cytoplasm and nuclei of basal oral keratinocytes; while in suprabasilar cells, it is primarily found in the nuclei. Human oral cancers in vivo did not exhibit immunostaining for DOC-1. Like murine DOC-1, human DOC-1 associates with DNA polymerase α/primase and mediates the phosphorylation of the large p180 catalytic subunit, suggesting it may be a potential regulator of DNA replication in the S phase of the cell cycle. Using a human doc-1 cosmid as a probe, human doc-1 is mapped to chromosome 12q24. We identified four exons in the entire human doc-1 gene and determined the intron-exon boundaries.

Survival curves of oral cancer patients have plateaued over the past 2 decades and remained among the worst of all cancer sites.The hamster oral cancer model is an excellent model to study the molecular event during oral carcinogenesis (4Shklar G.

DOC-1 is predicted to be a 114-amino acid peptide with a molecular mass of 12.4 kDa. Transfection of doc-1 into malignant oral keratinocytes led to the reversion of transformation phenotypes including anchorage independence, doubling time, and morphology. The genetic sequence of doc-1 matched to a tumor necrosis factor-α-induced early-response murine transcript, TU-166 (9Gordon H.M. Kucera G. Salvo R. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 4021-4027PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that doc-1 may be a downstream event in the tumor necrosis factor-α signaling pathway. We have recently cloned the full-length mouse doc-1 cDNA (GenBankTM numberAF011644); its DNA sequence in the open reading frame is 94% identical to that of the hamster. The predicted amino acid peptides encoded by the mouse and hamster doc-1 open reading frames are identical. Each open reading frame encodes for a 114-amino acid peptide that has a predicted molecular mass of 12.4 kDa and a pI of 9.53.The highly conserved nature of the rodent doc-1 genes prompted us to clone and examine the role of doc-1 in human oral and other cancers. This paper describes the cDNA and genomic DNA cloning of the human doc-1 gene, its chromosome localization, and its expression in normal and transformed human tissues. In addition, we examined for intragenic mutation of the human doc-1 gene. To obtain an insight into the biology of DOC-1, we made use of our recent finding that murine DOC-1 associates with DNA polymerase α/primase (DNA-PP) and regulates DNA replication in the S phase of the cell cycle. The potential interaction of human DOC-1 with DNA-PP was therefore examined.DISCUSSIONThis paper presents the cDNA and genomic cloning as well as partial characterizations of the human doc-1 gene. doc-1 is a highly conserved gene present in the genomes of all mammalian species examined. doc-1 mapped to human chromosome 12q24. Expression of DOC-1 can be detected in all normal human tissues examined. Interestingly, expression of doc-1 is not detectable in malignant oral keratinocytes, in cell lines, and in primary tumor tissues. Intragenic mutation analysis of the doc-1 in premalignant and malignant oral keratinocytes did not reveal any mutations. Like the hamster DOC-1, human DOC-1 associates with DNA-PP and mediates the phosphorylation of the p180 subunit.The existence of a human homolog and the highly conserved nature of the doc-1 gene prompted us to examine the role of the doc-1 gene in human oral and other forms of cancers. the doc-1 gene was initially identified and cloned from the hamster oral cancer model. In this chemically induced oral cancer model, expression of doc-1 is consistently reduced and/or lost. Loss of heterozygosity was observed in two out of three malignant oral keratinocyte cell lines (8Todd R. McBride J. Tsuji T. Donoff R.B. Nagai M. Chou M.Y. Chiang T. Wong D.T.W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Transfection of doc-1 into malignant hamster oral keratinocytes altered a number of phenotypes in culture including anchorage dependent growth, doubling time, and morphology. 83% of the doc-1 transfectants lost the ability to grow in soft agar (p < 0.05).The human doc-1 gene was mapped to chromosome 12q24. While this site has not been noted to be altered in oral/head and neck cancers, 12q24 is a recurrent break point in high grade B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (23Zani V.J. Asou N. Jadayel D. Heward J.M. Shipley J. Nacheva E. Takasuki K. Catovsky D. Dyer M.J. Blood. 1996; 87: 3124-3134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cytogenetic abnormalities included both translocations and interstitial deletions (22Van de Ven W. Hagemeijer A. Kucherlapati R. Marynen P. Cytogenet.

Neither doc-1 mRNA nor protein could be detected in the malignant human keratinocyte cell lines or in freshly resected oral cancers. While no intragenic mutations could be detected in the three tumor cell lines examined, a much larger sample size of human oral and nonoral tumor cell lines needs to be examined to evaluate the potential involvement of the doc-1 gene in carcinogenesis. In addition, cis-regulatory modifications of the doc-1 promoter such as CpG methylation can alter expression of the gene, which has been demonstrated to be of importance in the inactivation of p16ink4A/CDKN2A (24Foulkes W.D. Flanders T.Y. Pollock P.M. Hayward N.K. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 5-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The association of human DOC-1 with DNA-PP is of importance and sheds some light on the biochemical function of the doc-1 gene. DNA-PP is the only eukaryotic enzyme that can initiate DNA replication de novo. Based on data from our murine DOC-1 studies, we propose that DOC-1 is a negative regulator of DNA replication through the phosphorylation of the p180 subunit of DNA-PP.2 In tumor cells, where DOC-1 expression is absent or reduced, these DOC-1-mediated DNA-PP regulatory mechanisms might be compromised.We are beginning to understand the biochemical function of doc-1. DOC-1 is likely to be a regulator of DNA replication in the S phase of the cell cycle, of importance in normal cells as well as in carcinogenesis. Gordon et al. (9Gordon H.M. Kucera G. Salvo R. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 4021-4027PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that doc-1 is a tumor necrosis factor-α-inducible gene, suggesting that doc-1 is a downstream event in the tumor necrosis factor-α signaling pathway. Recently, Hatakeyama et al. (25Hatakeyama S. Jensen J.P. Taki J. Weissman A. Biology of Proteolysis. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 48Google Scholar) have shown that DOC-1 is constitutively ubiquinated in vivo and is a substrate of the mammalian ubiquitin ligase Nedd-4 (neural precursor cells expressed developmentally down-regulated) (25Hatakeyama S. Jensen J.P. Taki J. Weissman A. Biology of Proteolysis. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 48Google Scholar), thus providing a mechanism whereby intracellular DOC-1 activity is tightly regulated by the ubiquitin-mediated proteosomal degradation pathway (26King R.W.

The interconnections of DOC-1 and these various signaling pathways are of importance in carcinogenesis and are now being addressed in our ongoing investigations.

Approximately half of the patients afflicted die within 5 years of diagnosis, while surviving patients may be left with severe cosmetic and/or functional compromise (1Vokes E.E. Weichselbaum R.R.

Survival curves of oral cancer patients have plateaued over the past 2 decades and remained among the worst of all cancer sites. The hamster oral cancer model is an excellent model to study the molecular event during oral carcinogenesis (4Shklar G. Shklar G. Oral Cancer. W. B.

DOC-1 is predicted to be a 114-amino acid peptide with a molecular mass of 12.4 kDa. Transfection of doc-1 into malignant oral keratinocytes led to the reversion of transformation phenotypes including anchorage independence, doubling time, and morphology. The genetic sequence of doc-1 matched to a tumor necrosis factor-α-induced early-response murine transcript, TU-166 (9Gordon H.M. Kucera G. Salvo R. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 4021-4027PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that doc-1 may be a downstream event in the tumor necrosis factor-α signaling pathway. We have recently cloned the full-length mouse doc-1 cDNA (GenBankTM numberAF011644); its DNA sequence in the open reading frame is 94% identical to that of the hamster. The predicted amino acid peptides encoded by the mouse and hamster doc-1 open reading frames are identical. Each open reading frame encodes for a 114-amino acid peptide that has a predicted molecular mass of 12.4 kDa and a pI of 9.53. The highly conserved nature of the rodent doc-1 genes prompted us to clone and examine the role of doc-1 in human oral and other cancers. This paper describes the cDNA and genomic DNA cloning of the human doc-1 gene, its chromosome localization, and its expression in normal and transformed human tissues. In addition, we examined for intragenic mutation of the human doc-1 gene. To obtain an insight into the biology of DOC-1, we made use of our recent finding that murine DOC-1 associates with DNA polymerase α/primase (DNA-PP) and regulates DNA replication in the S phase of the cell cycle. The potential interaction of human DOC-1 with DNA-PP was therefore examined. DISCUSSIONThis paper presents the cDNA and genomic cloning as well as partial characterizations of the human doc-1 gene. doc-1 is a highly conserved gene present in the genomes of all mammalian species examined. doc-1 mapped to human chromosome 12q24. Expression of DOC-1 can be detected in all normal human tissues examined. Interestingly, expression of doc-1 is not detectable in malignant oral keratinocytes, in cell lines, and in primary tumor tissues. Intragenic mutation analysis of the doc-1 in premalignant and malignant oral keratinocytes did not reveal any mutations. Like the hamster DOC-1, human DOC-1 associates with DNA-PP and mediates the phosphorylation of the p180 subunit.The existence of a human homolog and the highly conserved nature of the doc-1 gene prompted us to examine the role of the doc-1 gene in human oral and other forms of cancers. the doc-1 gene was initially identified and cloned from the hamster oral cancer model. In this chemically induced oral cancer model, expression of doc-1 is consistently reduced and/or lost. Loss of heterozygosity was observed in two out of three malignant oral keratinocyte cell lines (8Todd R. McBride J. Tsuji T. Donoff R.B. Nagai M. Chou M.Y. Chiang T. Wong D.T.W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Transfection of doc-1 into malignant hamster oral keratinocytes altered a number of phenotypes in culture including anchorage dependent growth, doubling time, and morphology. 83% of the doc-1 transfectants lost the ability to grow in soft agar (p < 0.05).The human doc-1 gene was mapped to chromosome 12q24. While this site has not been noted to be altered in oral/head and neck cancers, 12q24 is a recurrent break point in high grade B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (23Zani V.J. Asou N. Jadayel D. Heward J.M.

This selective targeting of BSAP activities was shown to be regulated by a concentration-dependent mechanism whereby activator motifs for BSAP had a 20-fold higher binding affinity than repressor motifs. An exchange of activator and repressor motifs, however, showed that the context of the motif, rather than the affinity, determined whether BSAP operated as an activator or repressor."
https://openalex.org/W2046699979,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, choline kinase (ATP:choline phosphotransferase, EC2.7.1.32) is the product of the CKI gene. Choline kinase catalyzes the committed step in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine by the CDP-choline pathway. The yeast enzyme was overexpressed 106-fold in Sf-9 insect cells and purified 71.2-fold to homogeneity from the cytosolic fraction by chromatography with concanavalin A, Affi-Gel Blue, and Mono Q. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified choline kinase matched perfectly with the deduced sequence of the CKI gene. The minimum subunit molecular mass (73 kDa) of purified choline kinase was in good agreement with the predicted size (66.3 kDa) of the CKI gene product. Native choline kinase existed in oligomeric structures of dimers, tetramers, and octomers. The amounts of the tetrameric and octomeric forms increased in the presence of the substrate ATP. Antibodies were raised against the purified enzyme and were used to identify choline kinase in insect cells and in S. cerevisiae. Maximum choline kinase activity was dependent on Mg2+ ions (10 mm) at pH 9.5 and at 30 °C. The equilibrium constant (0.2) for the reaction indicated that the reverse reaction was favored in vitro. The activation energy for the reaction was 6.26 kcal/mol, and the enzyme was labile above 30 °C. Choline kinase exhibited saturation kinetics with respect to choline and positive cooperative kinetics with respect to ATP (n = 1.4–2.3). Results of the kinetic experiments indicated that the enzyme catalyzes a sequential Bi Bi reaction. The Vmax for the reaction was 138.7 μmol/min/mg, and the Km values for choline and ATP were 0.27 mm and 90 μm, respectively. The turnover number per choline kinase subunit was 153 s−1. Ethanolamine was a poor substrate for the purified choline kinase, and it was also poor inhibitor of choline kinase activity. ADP inhibited choline kinase activity (IC50 = 0.32 mm) in a positive cooperative manner (n = 1.5), and the mechanism of inhibition with respect to ATP and choline was complex.

The repression of these enzymes is absolutely dependent on inositol, a phosphatidylinositol precursor that plays a major role in the coordinate regulation of phospholipid synthesis in S. cerevisiae (3Carman G.M.

Under these growth conditions, the exogenous choline is used to synthesize PC via the CDP-choline pathway (3Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Annu. Rev.

An apparent paradox in phospholipid synthesis is the repression of the CDP-choline pathway enzymes by inositol and choline (30Hosaka K. Murakami T. Kodaki T. Nikawa J. Yamashita S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2005-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14776-14783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Morash S.C. McMaster C.R. Hjelmstad R.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28769-28776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for this paradox is unclear but may be attributed to other mechanisms of regulation that have yet to be discovered (33Henry S.A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Recent data indicate that the CDP-choline pathway contributes to PC synthesis even when wild-type cells are grown in the absence of choline (34McGee T.P. Skinner H.B. Whitters E.A. Henry S.A. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 35McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

The choline required is derived from the turnover of PC synthesized by the CDP-DG pathway (34McGee T.P. Skinner H.B. Whitters E.A. Henry S.A. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 35McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

In fact, mutants (e.g. cki) defective in the CDP-choline pathway enzymes excrete choline into the growth medium as a result of PC turnover and their inability to reutilize choline for PC synthesis by the CDP-choline pathway (37Patton-Vogt J.L.

The importance of the CDP-choline pathway is further underscored by the fact that the phosphatidylinositol/PC transfer protein (Sec14p) is essential in cells with a functional CDP-choline pathway (34McGee T.P. Skinner H.B. Whitters E.A. Henry S.A. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 38Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Whitters E.A. Champion K.M. Aitkin J.R. Dowhan W. Goebl M. Bankaitis V.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Overall, these observations suggest that the PC synthesized by each pathway has distinct as well as overlapping functions in cell physiology (1Carman G.M. Zeimetz G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13293-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Choline kinase (ATP:choline phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.32)is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the committed step in the synthesis of PC by the CDP-choline pathway (1Carman G.M. Zeimetz G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13293-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 39Wittenberg J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 431-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of choline with ATP to form phosphocholine and ADP (39Wittenberg J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 431-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of this enzyme should play an important role in PC synthesis in S. cerevisiae cells supplemented with free choline and in cells that reutilize choline derived from PC turnover. As indicated above, the expression of yeast choline kinase and other CDP-choline pathway enzymes is regulated by inositol and choline (30Hosaka K. Murakami T. Kodaki T. Nikawa J. Yamashita S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2005-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14776-14783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Morash S.C. McMaster C.R. Hjelmstad R.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28769-28776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data also indicate that choline kinase activity is regulated by biochemical mechanisms (31McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14776-14783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the biochemical regulation of choline kinase due to the difficulties in obtaining a highly purified preparation of the enzyme (40Yamashita S. Hosaka K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; : 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As an initial step toward understanding the regulation of choline kinase activity from S. cerevisiae, we report the purification of the enzyme to homogeneity. Our studies were facilitated by the overexpression of the yeast choline kinase (CKI) gene in Sf-9 insect cells. We also report on the enzymological and kinetic properties of the enzyme. These studies revealed that choline kinase is allosterically regulated by ATP and ADP and that this regulation may be physiologically relevant. All chemicals were reagent grade. Yeast growth medium supplies were purchased from Difco. The pCRII plasmid and the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 were obtained from Invitrogen. Nucleotides, choline, phosphocholine, ethanolamine, phosphoethanolamine, ammonium reinecke, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, benzamide, aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, nitrocellulose paper, and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. Radiochemicals were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Scintillation counting supplies were purchased from National Diagnostics. Protein assay reagent, Affi-Gel Blue, DEAE-Affi-Gel Blue, molecular mass standards for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrophoresis reagents, and immunochemical reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. ConA-Sepharose, Mono Q, and Superose 6 were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Polyvinylidene difluoride paper was purchased from Millipore Corp. Silica gel G thin layer plates were purchased from Analtech. The structural gene (CKI) encoding for S. cerevisiae choline kinase present in the multiple cloning site of pUC19 (41Hosaka K. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2053-2059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was excised as a blunt-ended fragment using the restriction enzyme BsaA1. The CKI gene was gel-purified and A-tailed (42Clark J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9677-9686Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) with 1 unit of Taq polymerase and 200 μm deoxyribonucleotides at 72 °C for 10 min. The A-tailed DNA was then TA-cloned into the pCRII vector. A partial digest of the pCRII-CKI construct using EcoRI yielded a 1.8-kilobase pair DNA fragment containing the entire coding region of the gene. The gene was next inserted into the EcoRI site of the baculovirus vector PVL1392. The PVL1392-CKI plasmid was subsequently co-transfected with BaculoGoldTM Autographa californica DNA (Pharmingen) into a monolayer of Sf-9 cells using the CaCl2 method. The Sf-9 cells were routinely grown in TMNFH medium (43O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 109-215Google Scholar) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. General procedures for the growth, maintenance, and infection of Sf-9 cells followed the methods described by O'Reilly et al. (43O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 109-215Google Scholar). Routine infection of Sf-9 cells for choline kinase purification used 1–2 × 109 cells grown in 30 150-mm dishes. The cells were infected at a viral multiplicity of 10 and grown in TMNFH medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum for 69 h. The infected cells were collected by gentle trituration with medium, harvested by centrifugation, and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The final cell pellet was snap-frozen over dry ice and stored at −80 °C. Choline kinase was overexpressed in wild-type S. cerevisiae strain W303–1A (MAT a ade2–1, his3–11, 15, leu2–3, 112, trp1–1, ura3–1, can1–100) (44Thomas B. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar) by transformation (45Ito H. Yasuki F. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the multicopy plasmid pCK1D (41Hosaka K. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2053-2059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid contains the CKI gene and directs the overexpression of choline kinase (41Hosaka K. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2053-2059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in complete synthetic medium (46Culbertson M.R. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1975; 80: 23-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) without leucine to the exponential phase of growth (1–2 × 107 cells/ml) at 30 °C. Cell numbers were detected by microscopic examination with a hemacytometer. Cells were disrupted with glass beads with a Mini-Bead-Beater (Biospec Products) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm Na2EDTA, 0.3 msucrose, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (19Klig L.S. Homann M.J. Carman G.M. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glass beads and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 1500 × gfor 5 min. The supernatant (cell extract) was used for enzyme assays and immunoblotting of choline kinase. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (47Davis B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15957) Google Scholar) was performed at 5 °C using 9% slab gels. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) was performed with 9% slab gels. Proteins on polyacrylamide gels were visualized with Coomassie Blue and by the silver stain procedure (49Merril C.R. Dunau M.L. Goldman D. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Choline kinase on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride paper and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis (50Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Beckman LF-3400 sequencer. Antibodies to choline kinase excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gel slices were raised in New Zealand White rabbits by standard procedures (51Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) at the Pocono Rabbit Farm (Canadensis, PA). The IgG fraction was isolated from antisera by DEAE-Affi-Gel Blue chromatography as described by the manufacturer. The IgG antibodies were precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate and resuspended and dialyzed against 20 mm K2HPO4 (pH 8.0) buffer. Immunoblot assays were performed with anti-choline kinase antibodies as described previously (52Haid A. Suissa M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The density of the choline kinase bands on immunoblots was quantified by scanning densitometry. Immunoblot signals were in the linear range of detectability. Choline kinase activity was measured for 10 min at 30 °C by following the formation of 3H-labeled phosphocholine from [methyl-3H]choline (500 cpm/nmol) as described by Porter and Kent (53Porter T.J. Kent C. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 67 mm glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 9.5), 5 mm choline, 0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgSO4, 1.3 mm dithiothreitol, and enzyme protein in a final volume of 60 μl. Radiolabeled phosphocholine was separated from the radiolabeled substrate by the precipitation of the substrate as choline reineckate (53Porter T.J. Kent C. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The amount of labeled product in the supernatant was determined by scintillation counting. The product phosphocholine was identified by thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates using the solvent system methanol, 0.5% sodium chloride, ammonia hydroxide (50:50:1) (54Teegarden D. Taparowsky E.J. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6042-6047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The position of the labeled phosphocholine on chromatograms was determined by fluorography and compared with a standard. Ethanolamine kinase activity was measured for 20 min at 30 °C by following the phosphorylation of ethanolamine with [γ-32P]ATP (100,000 cpm/nmol) (41Hosaka K. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2053-2059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 9.5), 5 mm ethanolamine, 0.5 mm ATP, 10 mmMgSO4, 1.3 mm dithiothreitol, and enzyme protein in a final volume of 25 μl. The product phosphoethanolamine was identified by thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates using the solvent system methanol, 0.6% sodium chloride, ammonium hydroxide (10:10:1). The position of the labeled phosphoethanolamine on chromatograms was determined by autoradiography and compared with a standard. The amount of labeled product was determined by scintillation counting. All assays were performed in triplicate with an average S.D. of ±5%. All assays were linear with time and protein concentration. A unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of product/min. Specific activity was defined as units/mg of protein. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (55Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Kinetic data were analyzed according to the Michaelis-Menten and Hill equations using the EZ-FIT enzyme kinetic model fitting program (56Perrella F. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). EZ-FIT uses the Nelder-Mead Simplex and Marquardt/Nash nonlinear regression algorithms sequentially and tests for the best fit of the data among different kinetic models. All steps were performed at 5 °C. The cell extract was prepared from 2.5 g (wet weight) of Sf-9 cells infected with baculovirus containing the yeast CKI gene. Cells were washed once in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3m sucrose, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamide, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin) and suspended (0.3 g, wet weight, of cells/ml) in buffer A. Cells were disrupted by sonic oscillation for seven 30-s bursts, with a 1.5-min pause between bursts. The disrupted cell suspension was then centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min to remove unbroken cells and cell debris. The cell extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1.5 h to remove the total membrane fraction. The supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was used for the next step in the purification. A ConA-Sepharose column (2 × 7 cm) was equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamide, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin). The cytosolic fraction was applied to the column at a flow rate of 60 ml/h. The column was then wash"

In this study, we present evidence suggesting a direct interaction between the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and the platelet-derived growth factor β (PDGFβ) receptor (PDGFβR), members of different receptor tyrosine kinase subfamilies. We find that the addition of EGF to COS-7 cells and to human foreskin Hs27 fibroblasts results in a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβR and results in the recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the PDGFβR. In R1hER cells, which overexpress the EGFR, we find ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβR and the constitutive binding of a substantial amount of PI-3 kinase activity to it, mimicking the effect of ligand in untransfected cells. In support of the possibility that this may be a direct interaction, we show that the two receptors can be coimmunoprecipitated from untransfected Hs27 fibroblasts and from COS-7 cells. This association can be reconstituted by introducing the two receptors into 293 EBNA cells. The EGFR/PDGFβR association is ligand-independent in all cell lines tested. We also demonstrate that the fraction of PDGFβR bound to the EGFR in R1hER cells undergoes an EGF-induced mobility shift on Western blots indicative of phosphorylation. Our findings indicate that direct interactions between receptor tyrosine kinases classified under different subfamilies may be more widespread than previously believed.

Receptor tyrosine kinases have been divided into subfamilies based on common structural features (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J.

Hunter T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). The PDGF receptor subfamily includes the PDGFαR, PDGFβR, stem cell factor receptor (Kit), colony-stimulating factor receptor (Fms), and Flk2 receptors and is characterized by the presence of five extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains. Members of this subfamily contain a kinase insert in which a regulatory region has been inserted into the conserved kinase domain. It is established that growth factors bind to specific receptors. Binding of the growth factor to its receptor may result in homodimerization or heterodimerization between members of a receptor subfamily (3Heldin C-H.

EGF can induce dimerization of EGF receptors and ErbB2 in transfected NR6 and NIH3T3 cells (10Qian X.C. LeVea M. Freeman J.K. Dougall W.C. Greene M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1500-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 11Wada T. Qian X. Greene M.I. Cell. 1990; 61: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and also in SKBR-3 cells, which overexpress the ErbB2 receptor (12Goldman R.B. Levy N. Peles E. Yarden Y. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11024-11028Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Similarly, heregulin may induce heterodimeric complexes between ErbB2 and ErbB3 or ErbB4 (13Plowman G.D. Green J.M. Culouscou J.M. Carlton G.W. Rothwell V.M. Buckley S. Nature. 1993; 366: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 14Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D.

A number of heterodimeric combinations of these receptors have been described, and some combinations are favored over others (15Tzahar E. Waterman H. Chen X. Levkovitz G. Karunagaran D. Lavi S. Ratzkin B.J. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5276-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). It is important to note that heterodimerization between the EGFR and ErbB2 proteins can be detected even in the absence of ligand (10Qian X.C. LeVea M. Freeman J.K. Dougall W.C. Greene M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1500-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Qian X. Dougall W.C. Hellman M.E. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1507-1514PubMed Google Scholar). Heterodimerization may have important functional consequences. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase has been shown to bind directly to activated receptors at domains that are autophosphorylated on tyrosine and contain a Tyr-X-X-Met motif (17Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). The EGFR lacks the binding motifs for the SH2 domains of the PI 3′-kinase, while the ErbB3 receptor may have little or no kinase activity but has multiple copies of the binding motif for PI 3-kinase (18Fedi P. Pierce J.H. Di Fiore P.P. Kraus M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 492-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 20Soltoff S.P. Carraway III, K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Stimulation of cells with EGF is known to increase the activity of PI 3-kinase. Although some studies have shown an increase in EGFR-associated PI 3-kinase activity upon ligand stimulation, this is considerably less than the increase associated with other activated receptors (20Soltoff S.P. Carraway III, K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 21Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This suggested that the mechanism of this increase may be a recruitment by the activated EGFR of other members of the EGFR subfamily, such as ErbB3. This has been demonstrated in A431 cells, where stimulation of cells with EGF increases ErbB3-associated PI 3-kinase activity (20Soltoff S.P. Carraway III, K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 22Carraway K.C. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), or by using chimeric receptors in fibroblasts (18Fedi P. Pierce J.H. Di Fiore P.P. Kraus M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 492-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that EGF does not bind to ErbB3. In addition, different receptor heterodimers may alter ligand binding kinetics, with resultant variations in signal characteristics (23Karunagaran D. Tzahar E. Beerli R.B. Chen X. Graus-Porta D. Ratzkin B.J. Seger R. Hynes N.E. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Recently, transactivation of the EGFR has also been described in response to stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors (24Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). In the PDGFR subfamily, the different isoforms of PDGF induce different dimeric forms of the receptors; e.g. PDGF-AA induces αα homodimers only while PDGF-BB induces all three combinations of receptors (i.e. αα, ββ, and αβ (25Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). However, for polypeptide growth factors, heterodimerization is generally believed to be limited to members of the same subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases. Thus, although receptors from different subfamilies may use common substrates, they are believed to function independently, without directly influencing each other and directly interacting only with members of the same subfamily. The engagement of a receptor tyrosine kinase by its ligand results in dimerization, activation of the kinase activity of the receptor, and autophosphorylation (26Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of an activated receptor results in the creation of docking sites for SH2 and phosphotyrosine-binding domain-containing proteins that associate with the receptor (27Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). These include proteins believed to have adaptor functions, such as Shc and Grb2. Another class of SH2 domain-containing proteins that bind to autophosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases have intrinsic catalytic activity. These include proteins such as phospholipase C-γ1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which associate with the activated receptor. PI 3-kinase is composed of two subunits, an 85-kDa regulatory or adaptor subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (28Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The p85 subunit has two SH2 domains in its carboxyl-terminal half. The enzyme is capable of phosphorylating the D-3 position on phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate. PI 3-kinase may be an important mediator of mitogenic signaling in certain cell types. Studies with mutant PDGF receptors lacking association sites for PI 3-kinase show a decrease in DNA synthesis upon PDGF stimulation (29Fantl W.J. Escobedo J.A. Martin G.A. Turck C.W. del Rosario M. McCormick F. Williams L.T. Cell. 1992; 69: 413-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 30Kazlauskas A. Kashishian A. Cooper J.A. Valius M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2534-2544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Restoring the PI 3-kinase binding site to a mutant PDGFR deficient in mitogenic signaling restores the ability of the receptor to initiate DNA synthesis (31Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Other functions of PI 3-kinase (reviewed in Ref. 32Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) include cellular trafficking and cytoskeletal alterations induced by growth factor stimulation and a role in cell survival. PDGF induces a heterologous down-regulation of EGF receptors (33Wrann M. Fox C.F. Science. 1980; 210: 1363-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Stimulation by PDGF or phorbol esters results in a decrease in the affinity of the EGF receptor for its ligand without influencing the number of receptors and results in a decrease in the kinase activity of the EGF receptor (34Bowen-Pope D.F. Dicorleto P.E. Ross R. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 35Friedman B.A. Frackelton R.A. Ross H.R. Connors J.M. Fujiki H. Sugimura T. Rosner M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3034-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 36Hunter T. Ling N. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1984; 311: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Stimulation of fibroblasts with PDGF or with phorbol esters leads to phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at threonine 654, which is a site of protein kinase C phosphorylation. This led to the suggestion that protein kinase C activation mediated by the PDGFR leads to phosphorylation of the EGFR at threonine 654, and this phosphorylation is responsible for transmodulation. However, subsequent studies have suggested that neither activation of protein kinase C nor phosphorylation at threonine 654 are required for the transmodulation induced by PDGF (37Countaway J.L. Girones N. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13642-13647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Davis R.J. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of PDGFR-mediated transmodulation remains unknown. An influence of the EGFR on PDGFR receptor signaling, to our knowledge, has not previously been described. In this study, we present evidence suggesting that the EGFR associates with and directly influences signaling through the PDGFβ receptor. Hs27, COS-7, Rat-1 R1hER, B82L, and 293 EBNA cells (Invitrogen) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. R1hER cells are Rat-1 fibroblasts transfected with a human EGFR construct. Human recombinant PDGF-BB and human recombinant EGF were used at a concentration of 50 and 100 ng/ml, respectively, for 5 min unless specified otherwise. A human PDGFβ receptor construct was cloned into pcDNA 3.1 (+) vector using standard molecular cloning techniques. A human EGFR construct was cloned into pcDNA 3.1 (−) vector. The empty vectors were purchased from Invitrogen. Transient transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate method (39Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). Expression of transfected genes was confirmed by Western blotting. For transient transfection experiments, cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. Standard protocols were used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting in different experiments (39Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). Quantitation of proteins was performed by using a Bio-Rad detergent-compatible protein assay kit and confirmed by Coomassie staining of aliquots subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For immunoprecipitation, cells were serum-starved and exposed to growth factor for the times indicated. Cells were subsequently lysed in a modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate), and equal amounts of protein were incubated with the primary antibody for 90 min. Protein A-Sepharose or Protein G-agarose beads were subsequently added to the lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were subsequently washed and solubilized in SDS sample buffer and then boiled and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose. Western blots were developed with ECL reagents (Amersham Corp.). In experiments where cell lysates were examined directly, cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting. The phosphotyrosine antibody used in all of the experiments described in this study was PY-20, obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Other antibodies used for the different experiments were as follows. For detecting tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβR in response to EGF in Hs27 and COS-7 cells, rabbit polyclonal PDGFβR antibodies raised against the carboxyl tail of the PDGFβR (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, catalog number 15746E; Ref. 31Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) or rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 1013–1025 of the human PDGFβR (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY, catalog number 06-498; Ref. 40Claesson-Welsh L. Eriksson A. Moren A. Severinsson L. Ek B. Ostman A. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3476-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) were used for immunoprecipitation. A peptide control for this antibody was also used (Upstate Biotechnology, 12-162). The same antibodies were used to demonstrate tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβR in R1hER cells and for immunoprecipitating the PDGFβR in other experiments. These two antibodies were also used for Western blotting of the PDGFβR. The EGFR was immunoprecipitated using either a mouse monoclonal antibody against the human EGFR, which does not recognize ErbB2 (Pharmingen, 14891A; Ref. 41Waterfield M.D. Mayes E.L. Stroobant P. Bennet P.L. Young S. Goodfellow P.N. Banting G.S. Ozanne B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 20: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), or sheep polyclonal EGFR antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, 06-128). For Western blotting of the EGFR sheep polyclonal antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology; 06-128) or rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised to residues 1005–1016 of the human EGFR (sc-03; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used. For studies of coimmunoprecipitation, PDGFβR immunoprecipitates were run on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal EGFR antibodies (sc-03; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or sheep polyclonal EGFR antibodies (UBI, 06–128), with identical results. The reverse experiment was done by immunoprecipitating the EGFR and immunoblotting with either the tail or the UBI PDGFβR antibodies. p85 antibodies directed against the N-SH2 domain (Upstate Biotechnology, 06-496) were used for both immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. For experiments examining the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ1, p120 GAP, and SHP-2, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the respective antibodies and immunoblotted with phosphotyrosine. Antibodies to these three proteins were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-426, sc-425, and sc-280). PI 3-kinase assays were done as follows (42Whitman M. Kaplan D.R. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L. Roberts T.M. Nature. 1985; 315: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Cells were serum-starved for 48 h prior to treatment with PDGF-BB or EGF as indicated. The cells were incubated with growth factors at 37 °C for 5 min and then washed with ice-cold buffer A (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2) and 100 μm NaVO4 and lysed with in 1 ml of buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μmNaVO4. 2 μl of anti-PDGF-R kinase insert antibody (Pharmingen, 15756E; Ref. 43Kazlauskas A. Durden D.L. Cooper J.A. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was added and incubated for 90 min on ice, after which protein A-Sepharose beads were added. Following a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times in buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40; twice in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm LiCl; and twice in TNE (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA), all containing 100 μm NaVO4. The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of TNE, 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2, and 10 μl of sonicated 1 mg/ml PI (Avanti Polar Lipids), dried under Argon, and resuspended in 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA (pH 7.0). The reaction volume was incubated with a 10-μl volume of ATP (10 μCi of γ-32P, 100 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 0.25 μm unlabeled ATP) at 37 °C for 10 min and was stopped by adding 20 μl of 6n HCl and 160 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). The aqueous and lipophilic phases were separated by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm, and 40 μl of the lower phase was spotted onto a silica gel 60 plate (Merck), previously immersed in 1% potassium oxalate and heat-activated. After developing the plate in chloroform/methanol/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11:1.8, v/v), the radioactive phosphate spots were detected by autoradiography, identified by comparison with phospholipid standards, and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. The Hs27 fibroblast cell line and COS-7 cells express receptors for both PDGF and EGF. In this study, we have examined signaling through the PDGFβR. Stimulation of quiescent cells with PDGF results in a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor (Fig. 2 B). We find that stimulation of cells with EGF also results in an increase in the phosphotyrosine content of the PDGFR (Figs. 1 and2). This increase can be seen within 5 min in COS-7 cells and can be detected by immunoprecipitating cell lysates with phosphotyrosine antibodies followed by immunoblotting with a PDGFβR antibody (Pharmingen, 15746E), as shown in Fig.1 B. Also, if PDGFβR antibodies are used for immunoprecipitation of denatured cell lysates and this is followed by immunoblotting with phosphotyrosine antibodies, an EGF-induced increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFR can be detected (Fig.1 A). Note that this antibody fails to immunoprecipitate the denatured EGFR from EGF-stimulated A431 cells (Fig. 1 A). Also, stripping this blot and reprobing it with EGFR antibodies showed no staining (not shown). EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβR is also noted when samples are not denatured prior to immunoprecipitation. The same results were obtained with Hs27 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). We estimate that about 5% of the PDGFβ receptors undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in these cells in response to EGF (Fig. 2 B). We are unable to detect any increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFR in response to EGF in B82L cells, which lack the EGFR. We do not detect tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR in response to PDGF (not shown).Figure 1A, tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβR in response to EGF stimulation in COS-7 cells. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h and exposed to EGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min. Lysates were denatured by boiling in 1% SDS for 5 min followed by immunoprecipitation with a PDGFβR tail antibody (Pharmingen, 15746E) and immunoblotting with a phosphotyrosine antibody (PY 20). Lanes 1 and 3 show unstimulated cells, while lanes 2 and 4 show cells stimulated with EGF. In lane 5, EGF-stimulated cells were denatured and immunoprecipitated with an isotype-matched control antibody. Lane 6 shows an EGF-stimulated denatured A431 cell lysate immunoprecipitated with the same PDGFβR antibodies. B, tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor in COS-7 cells. Cells were serum-starved and exposed to EGF (+) and denatured as in A, followed by immunoprecipitation with phosphotyrosine antibodies and Western blotting with the PDGFβR tail antibody described in the legend to panel A. Lanes 1 and 3 show unstimulated cells, while lanes 2 and 4 show EGF-stimulated cells. In lane 5, cells were stimulated with EGF and immunoprecipitated with an isotype-matched control antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next studied the effect of EGFR overexpression on tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβR. Rat-1 fibroblasts transfected with the human EGFR (R1hER) were used. These cells were obtained from Dr. Michael Weber (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA) and have been described elsewhere (44Wasilenko W.J. Payne D.M. Fitzgerald D.L. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These cells express about 7.5 × 105 EGF receptors/cell, which is about a 7-fold increase over the parental Rat-1 fibroblast cell line (11Wada T. Qian X. Greene M.I. Cell. 1990; 61: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In R1hER cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβR in response to PDGF is intact, suggesting that binding of the ligand to its receptor and homodimerization are unimpaired. In these cells, there is a constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR. Significantly, we also detect constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor (Fig. 2 C), mimicking the effect of EGF stimulation in untransfected cells. Since EGF does not bind to the PDGFR, and since the ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor seen in untransfected cells is seen constitutively in cells overexpressing the EGFR, we conclude that EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβR is mediated by the activated EGFR. This conclusion is supported by the observation that this EGF effect requires the presence of the EGFR. Since a physical association can be demonstrated between the two receptors (see below), we suggest that the PDGFβR may be a substrate of the EGFR and/or that these effects may result from dimerization or oligomerization between these two receptors. Activation of a number of receptor tyrosine kinases results in the association of PI 3-kinase with the receptor and an increase in receptor-associated PI 3-kinase activity. Although stimulation of cells with EGF leads to an increase in PI 3-kinase activity in phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates, there is little increase in EGFR-associated activity. The mechanism of this increase may be a recruitment by the activated EGFR of other members of the EGFR subfamily, such as ErbB3. To study whether the PDGFβR could play a similar role to ErbB3, we examined whether exposure of cells to EGF would lead to an increase in the PI 3-kinase activity associated with the PDGFβR. We find that in Hs27 cells EGF induces a 2-fold increase in the PI 3-kinase activity associated with the PDGFβR, which is similar to the increase seen in phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 A). Also, when cells are preincubated with a low concentration of PDGF (5 ng/ml) for 30 min and this is followed by stimulation with EGF, we can detect a significant further increase in the PI 3-kinase activity associated with the PDGFβR (Fig. 3 A), over PDGF alone. Treatment with 5 ng/ml PDGF alone for 30 min leads to about a 20-fold increase, while further stimulation with EGF increases the PI 3-kinase activity to about 30-fold compared with unstimulated cells. Similar results were seen with COS-7 cells (Fig. 3 B). In unstimulated R1hER cells, there is about an 8-fold increase in the PI 3-kinase activity in phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates compared with parental Rat-1 cells. As can be seen in Fig.4, the PI 3-kinase activity associated with the PDGFβR is also increased in unstimulated R1hER cells, and the magnitude of this increase is almost equal to that detected in phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. It is difficult to detect any PI 3-kinase activity associated with EGFR in either Rat-1 or R1hER cells. Adding EGF to R1hER cells results in a further increase in PDGFR-associated PI 3-kinase activity (not shown). We can also detect tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGFβR in p85 immunoprecipitates from Hs27 or COS-7 cells stimulated with EGF. This was observed by immunoprecipitating p85 from cells stimulated with EGF followed by immunoblotting with a PDGFβR antibody. A band was seen at 180 kDa, which comigrated with a more intense band seen in cells stimulated with PDGF (not shown). Stripping the blot and reprobing with phosphotyrosine antibodies confirmed that the PDGFβR was tyrosine-phosphorylated. A substantial amount of PDGFβR coimmunoprecipitates with p85 in R1hER cells in the absence of ligand (not shown). We next investigated if a similar constitutive recruitment to the PDGFR could be detected for other SH2 domain-containing proteins such as p120GAP, phospholipase C-γ1 or SHP-2. No such association was detected for these three proteins in R1hER cells even upon stimulation with EGF. Although the EGFR has been shown to heterodimerize with other members of the EGFR subfamily, heterodimerization with the PDGFR has not been described. To determine whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβR in response to EGF was mediated directly by the EGFR, we looked for a physical association between the two receptors. Surprisingly, we found that the two receptors can be coimmunoprecipitated from Hs27 and COS-7 cells in the absence of ligand. This association was detected by immunoprecipitating the EGFR and staining Western blots with the PDGFβR (Fig. 5 A). To confirm this association immunoprecipitation was then performed with PDGFβR antibodies followed by blotting with EGFR antibodies with the same result (Fig. 5 B). About 5% of the PDGF receptors exist in a complex with the EGFR in these cells (Fig. 5 C). These results were consistently obtained using a number of antibodies recognizing different epitopes on the receptors (described under “Experimental Procedures”), isotype-matched negative controls, and peptide inhibition of immunoprecipitation. To rule out cross-reactivity between the antibodies, the following experiments were undertaken. The antibodies used to immunoprecipitate the EGFR (Pharmingen, 14891A; Upstate Biotechnology, 06-128) were tested for their ability to immunoprecipitate the PDGFβR in B82L cells (which lack the EGFR but express PDGFR) in PDGFβR blots. No staining was observed. Next, antibodies used to immunoprecipitate the PDGFβR (Upstate Biotechnology, 06-498; Pharmingen, 15746E) were tested for their ability to immunoprecipitate the EGFR from A431 cells (which do not express the PDGFβR) in EGFR blots with negative results. The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation were also used for Western blotting of the PDGFR and were tested for their ability to recognize the EGFR immunoprecipitated from A431 cells in Western blots with negative results. The antibodies used for Western blotting of the EGFR (Pharmingen, 14891A; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-03) were tested for their ability to recognize the PDGFR immunoprecipitated from B82L cells in Western blots, also with negative results. There is no increase in the amount of coimmunoprecipitating receptor with the addition of either PDGF or EGF. In R1hER cells, we again detect the ligand-independent coimmunoprecipitation described above. In addition, upon the addition of EGF, we can detect a mobility shift of the fraction of the PDGFR that is bound to the EGFR (Fig. 5 D). This suggests that the fraction of PDGFβR that is bound to the EGFR in these cells undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to EGF. We do not detect EGF-induced increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of the total complement of PDGFβ receptors in R1hER cells, although as noted earlier there is a constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of these receptors in R1hER cells. We further explored the association between the two receptors in 293EBNA cells, which normally express little or no endogenous EGFR (45Chan C. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22619-22623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In addition, we were unable to detect the PDGFβR in these cells by immunoblotting. Both receptors were introduced into these cells by calcium phosphate transfection. A human PDGFβR cDNA construct was cloned into the PCDNA 3.1 vector. Expression in 293 cells was confirmed by immunoblotting with PDGFβR antibodies. A human EGFR construct was also cloned into a PCDNA 3.1 vector (Invitrogen). Expression in 293 cells was confirmed by immunoblotting with EGFR antibodies. We coexpressed the receptors using the empty vector as a control, and 24 h after transfection we immunoprecipitated cell lysates with PDGFβR antibodies, followed by Western blotting and staining with EGFR antibodies. The EGFR can be detected in cells where both receptors were introduced but not in cells where the the PDGFβR was transfected with a control vector (Fig.6 A). The reverse experiment was done by immunoprecipitating the EGFR and staining Western blots with PDGFβR antibodies. This again confirmed the association between the two receptors (Fig. 6 B). As is the case in untransfected cells, the addition of either PDGF or EGF did not result in any increase in the amount of coimmunoprecipitating receptor. In this study, we describe interactions between the EGF and the PDGFβ receptors, which are members of different receptor tyrosine kinase subfamilies. The interactions observed between the two receptors include a physical association between the two receptors and tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor by the activated EGFR and EGF-induced recruitment of PI 3-kinase to the PDGFR. These studies were done in Hs27 human foreskin fibroblasts and in R1hER fibroblasts cells, which overexpress the human EGFR. These effects are also seen in the COS-7 and in 293 cells, demonstrating that these interactions extend to other cell types. Stimulation of Hs27 and COS-7 cells with EGF results in tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFβ receptors. EGF has previously been demonstrated to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of other members of the EGFR subfamily. As discussed earlier, the addition of EGF to certain cell lines results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors, although EGF does not bind to ErbB2 or ErbB3. Similarly, EGF does not bind to the PDGFR, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβR in response to EGF seen in Hs27 and COS-7 cells is likely to result from activation of the EGFR; also, these effects are not seen in B82L cells, where the EGFR is not expressed. Furthermore, overexpression of the EGFR in Rat-1 fibroblasts causes a substantial ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβR. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR in response to PDGF, however, was not observed in any of the cell lines we tested. The EGFR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor could have a number of functional consequences. It could influence the kinase activity of the PDGF receptor, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream substrates and/or result in recruitment of SH2 domain-containing proteins to the receptor. At least one of these outcomes is seen in untransfected cells, namely the association of PI 3-kinase with the PDGFβR following EGF stimulation. This suggests the following order of events. Activation of the EGFR leads to tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the PDGFβR. This leads to the association of PI 3-kinase with the PDGFβR. Although the EGF-induced increase in PI 3-kinase activity associated with the PDGFβR is small (a 2-fold increase), even small increases in PI 3-kinase activity may be functionally significant. For example, PDGF-induced cytoskeletal changes such as membrane ruffling, which is dependent on PI 3-kinase activity, have been observed with concentrations of PDGF as low as 3 ng/ml (46Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3041) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the activation of PI 3-kinase by PDGF is dose-dependent over a certain range. If cells are preincubated with low doses of PDGF, EGF induces a substantial further increase in the PI 3-kinase activity associated with the PDGFβR. We looked for a similar association between the PDGFβR and other SH2 domain-containing proteins such as phospholipase C-γ1, p120GAP, and SHP-2 in cells exposed to EGF. No association was found. Overexpression of the EGFR in Rat-1 cells results in a constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβR, mimicking the effect of EGF stimulation in untransfected cells. In addition, there is a substantial constitutive association of the PDGFβR with PI 3-kinase in R1hER cells, again consistent with results seen in untransfected cells upon the addition of EGF. The PI 3-kinase activity in phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates is significantly increased in R1hER cells, in the absence of ligand. Almost all of this activity may be associated with the PDGFβR in these cells. It should also be noted that PI 3-kinase is the only SH2 domain-containing protein we can detect that binds constitutively to the PDGFβR in R1hER cells. These observations lead us to infer the following. First, that EGF-mediated increases in PI 3-kinase activity may involve the recruitment of the PDGFβR in certain cells. As noted before, the addition of EGF to A431 cells leads to an increase in PI 3-kinase activity associated with the ErbB3 receptor, another member of the EGFR subfamily. The PDGFβR may serve a similar function. Secondly, overexpression of the EGFR in R1hER cells mimics the effect of EGF stimulation on the PDGFβR in untransfected cells in a ligand-independent fashion. This suggests that although R1hER cells express high levels of the EGFR, observations made in these cells may provide clues to the interactions between the two receptors under physiologic conditions. R1hER cells may also serve as a model for interactions between the receptors in tumors that overexpress the EGFR and also express the PDGFβR. What is the mechanistic basis for this influence of the EGFR on PDGFR signaling? We have shown that ligand-dependent activation of the EGFR results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβR in untransfected cells, while overexpressing the EGFR leads to such an effect in the absence of ligand. This effect could be mediated directly by the EGFR or by intermediate kinases. Two observations suggest that this may be a direct interaction. First, the EGFR binds to the PDGFβR as detected by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Although this association is ligand-independent, there is precedent for this. It has previously been shown that heterodimerization may occur between EGFR and ErbB2 proteins even in the absence of ligand (10Qian X.C. LeVea M. Freeman J.K. Dougall W.C. Greene M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1500-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Qian X. Dougall W.C. Hellman M.E. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1507-1514PubMed Google Scholar). Secondly, in R1hER cells the fraction of PDGFβ receptors associated with the EGFR undergoes an EGF-induced mobility shift suggestive of phosphorylation. This again supports a direct interaction between the two receptors. From the studies presented here, we conclude that direct interactions between receptor tyrosine kinases classified under different subfamilies may be more widespread than previously believed. This may include heterodimerization or oligomerization and/or transphosphorylation with resultant recruitment of SH2 domain-containing proteins to the activated receptor. Such a scheme would alter the signaling repertoire of the receptor depending on other receptors expressed in the same cell and has obvious implications for specificity in cellular signaling. The ability of different receptor tyrosine kinases to directly influence each other is also relevant to a better understanding of coordination of signals generated by multiple cytokines acting on the same cell.

We have determined the minimal RNA-binding site size of the poliovirus polymerase using binding titration with oligonucleotides of increasing length. A dramatic increase in affinity was observed when the length of the oligo(U) increased from 8 to 10 nucleotides (nt), arguing that the minimal size of RNA for polymerase binding is 10 nt. Another increase in affinity seen as the oligo(U) reached 24 nt suggests that a 24-nucleotide RNA can be occupied by two polymerase molecules. Direct binding of wild-type polymerase to oligo(U)12 and oligo(U)24 RNAs showed differences in affinity and cooperativity consistent with this model. The increase in binding affinity seen for oligo(U)10 suggests either that the RNA-binding determinants are widely spaced on the polymerase structure or that a substantial conformational change in the polymerase occurs upon the filling of its RNA-binding site.

The poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is responsible for phosphodiester bond formation during templated RNA polymerization. A 52-kDa protein, the poliovirus polymerase is encoded by the 3′-most coding sequences of the poliovirus genome and is generated by cleavage from the viral polyprotein by virally encoded proteases. Studies of the mechanism of the poliovirus polymerase have been greatly facilitated by its cloning (1Racaniello V.R. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4887-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and expression both in Escherichia coli (2Morrow C.D. Warren B. Lentz M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 24212-24219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polymerase purified from these sources was identical in elongation rate, template specificity, and Km for nucleotides to polymerase purified from infected cells (6Neufeld K.L. Richards O.C. Ehrenfeld E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24212-24219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The poliovirus polymerase displays a low affinity for RNA, which has led to reports that highly purified polymerase is not an RNA-binding protein (7Paul A.V. Cao X. Harris K.S. Lama J. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29173-29181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Harris K.S. Xiang W. Alexander L. Lane W.S. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27004-27014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent in vitro studies using poliovirus polymerase purified from E. coli demonstrated that at high concentration, the polymerase is not only capable of binding RNA, but exhibits efficient template utilization (9Pata J.D. Schultz S.C. Kirkegaard K. RNA. 1995; 1: 466-477PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, interactions between poliovirus polymerase molecules themselves critically affect elongation activity in vitro. Both RNA elongation and RNA binding were shown to be cooperative with respect to polymerase concentration (9Pata J.D. Schultz S.C. Kirkegaard K. RNA. 1995; 1: 466-477PubMed Google Scholar). Data in support of polymerase-polymerase interactions have also come from observed interactions in the yeast two-hybrid system (10Hope D.A. Diamond S.E. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9490-9498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), from glutaraldehyde cross-linking (9Pata J.D. Schultz S.C. Kirkegaard K. RNA. 1995; 1: 466-477PubMed Google Scholar), and from the three-dimensional structure of the polymerase (11Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). An unusual feature of the poliovirus polymerase x-ray crystallographic structure is an extensive interface between polymerase molecules, termed Interface I (11Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). More than 23 amino acids are involved in salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions across Interface I. The packing of polymerase molecules at this interface is head-to-tail, such that long fibers of polymerase extend through the crystal lattice. To characterize further the RNA-binding properties of poliovirus polymerase, we used competition with homopolymeric RNAs of various lengths to determine the minimal site size for polymerase binding to RNA. Wild-type poliovirus Mahoney type 1 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D proteins were expressed from plasmids in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS under the control of a T7 promoter and purified as described elsewhere (11Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), except that immediately after elution from the final chromatography column, the polymerase preparation was brought to 62% glycerol. The polymerase stocks, in 12.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.01% NaN3, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.25% β-octyl glucopyranoside, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 120 mmNaCl, and 60% glycerol, were stored at −80 °C. Wild-type polymerase was expressed from the plasmid pT5T-3D constructed by Thale Jarvis (Ribozyme Products, Inc., Boulder, Colorado) and contained the 3D coding region preceded by an initiator methionine. Purified gene 32 protein, expressed in E. coli from a recombinant plasmid (12Shamoo Y. Adari H. Konigsberg W.H. Williams K.R. Chase J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8844-8848Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), was a generous gift from Dr. Y. Shamoo (Yale University). The gene 32 protein stock (89.4 μm) was supplied in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol and was stored at −80 °C. Full-length positive-strand poliovirus RNA was transcribed from T7pGEM-polio (13Sarnow P. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 467-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) digested with EcoRI. The 116-nt 1The abbreviations used are: nt, nucleotide(s); MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. RNA was transcribed from pG4Z-517/670 digested with BsaBI and encodes, from 5′ to 3′ of the T7-transcribed RNA, nt 1–29 derived from the vector followed by nt 517–604 of the poliovirus Mahoney type 1 genome. The plasmid pG4Z-517/670 was constructed by inserting the BstUI-BamHI fragment of T7pGEM-polio into pGEM4Z (Promega, Madison, WI) digested with HincII-BamHI. Transcription reactions were carried out as described previously (9Pata J.D. Schultz S.C. Kirkegaard K. RNA. 1995; 1: 466-477PubMed Google Scholar), except that UTP was included at 0.5 mm. Homopolymers were purchased from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden) and suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mmEDTA. Uridylyl oligonucleotides 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 nt in length, as well as the 46-nt deoxyoligonucleotide (ATAGTTCTGATCCACTCCGGGCCCTACAGGTCATACTGTAATTGCC), were synthesized by Macromolecular Resources (Fort Collins, CO). The sequence of the 46-nt DNA was derived from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaedouble-stranded RNA virus L-A, nt 4506–4551 (14Icho T. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6716-6723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus should represent a heteropolymeric DNA of irrelevant sequence. Thymidyl deoxyoligonucleotides 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 nt in length were synthesized by the Protein and Nucleic Acid facility at Stanford University. For the direct binding of oligo(U)12 and oligo(U)24 RNAs and the 46-nt DNA, the nucleic acids were end-labeled with 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) with 1 unit/μl T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.) in 70 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed by centrifugation through a Micro-spin G-25 column (Pharmacia) once for the DNA and twice for the RNA. Concentration was determined by UV absorption at 260 nm. Polymerase at concentrations ranging from 0.20 to 7.0 μm was incubated with the appropriate 32P-labeled nucleic acid in 50-μl reactions with final concentrations of 25 mm MES-NaOH (pH 5.5), 60 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnSO4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm ATP, 0.25 mm UTP, 0.25 mm GTP, 0.25 mm CTP, and 24% glycerol. Polymerase binding to RNA and enzymatic activity were previously found to be optimal at pH 5.5 under these conditions (9Pata J.D. Schultz S.C. Kirkegaard K. RNA. 1995; 1: 466-477PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated on ice for 30 min. Full-length poliovirus RNA and the 116-nt RNA were present at final concentrations of 0.01 and 1 nm strands, corresponding to 75 and 116 nm nt, respectively. Oligo(U)12 and oligo(U)24 were present at 12 and 6 nm strands, respectively, corresponding to 144 nm nt. For competition experiments, unlabeled competitor RNAs at various concentrations were mixed with the radioactively labeled RNA in binding reaction buffer as described above. Polymerase at either 1.5 μm for the full-length poliovirus RNA or 2.0 μm for the 116-nt RNA was added to a final volume of 50 μl, and the competition reactions were allowed to equilibrate on ice for 30 min. Gene 32 protein in concentrations ranging from 0.12 to 3.0 μm was incubated with the appropriate32P-labeled nucleic acid in a 25-μl solution containing 5 mm MES-NaOH (pH 6.5), 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaCl, and 0.35 mm MgCl2 and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The final pH of this solution was 7.5. The 116-nt RNA and the 46-nt DNA were present at final concentrations of 1 and 2 nm strands, corresponding to 116 and 92 nm nt, respectively. For competition experiments, unlabeled competitor oligo(dT) molecules at various concentrations were mixed with the radioactively labeled RNA or DNA in binding reaction buffer as described above. Gene 32 protein at either 0.60 μm for the 116-nt RNA or 0.22 μm for the 46-nt DNA was added to 25 μl, and the competition reactions were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at room temperature. Complexes present in aliquots of the polymerase-nucleic acid binding reactions were separated by a modified nitrocellulose binding assay described previously (9Pata J.D. Schultz S.C. Kirkegaard K. RNA. 1995; 1: 466-477PubMed Google Scholar). For the polymerase binding experiments, the filters were washed with 500 μl/well of a solution containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5) and 5 mm MgCl2. When measuring the direct binding of polymerase to 32P-labeled oligo(U)12and the 116-nt RNA in Fig. 5, the filters were washed with 2 ml/well of buffer containing 25 mm MES-NaOH (pH 5.5), 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnSO4, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Separation of gene 32 protein-nucleic acid complexes was performed using a similar binding assay with only the nitrocellulose filter, to capture the gene 32 protein-nucleic acid complexes, and the positively charged nylon filter, to capture the unbound nucleic acids. Complexes bound to the membranes were washed with 1 ml/well of a solution containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5) and 5 mmMgCl2. Detection and quantitation of the radiolabeled nucleic acids bound to the filters were performed using a Storm PhosphorImaging System with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). All graphing and curve fitting were performed using GraphPAD Prism software (GraphPAD Software for Science, San Diego, CA). Data points for direct binding of nucleic acids to proteins were collected in duplicate or triplicate at each protein concentration. The mean values are given in the figures, with error bars representing S.D. Direct binding curves that displayed cooperative binding behavior with respect to polymerase concentration were fit to Equation 1, based on the Hill equation. %RNA bound=100·([polymerase]n/(K+[polymerase]n))Equation 1 The exponential term (n) is the Hill coefficient, which can be used as a rough estimate of the extent of cooperativity (15Hill T.L. J. Polymer Sci. Part D Macromol. Rev. 1957; 23: 549-562Google Scholar). However, since gene 32 protein binding saturated with <100% of the input nucleic acid bound, the amount of nucleic acid bound at saturation was estimated, and Equation 1 was modified to reflect this (Equation 2). %RNA bound=29·([gene32protein]n/(K+[gene32protein]n))Equation 2 Direct binding curves that did not display cooperative binding behavior with respect to polymerase concentration were fit to a simple binding curve derived from the law of mass action, where Equation 3follows, %RNA bound=Bmax·([protein]/(Kd+[protein]))Equation 3 and Bmax is the maximum percent RNA bound, [protein] is the micromolar concentration of the protein, and Kd is the dissociation constant. To determine whether direct binding curves displayed simple or cooperative binding, all curves were fit to both types of equations, and the correlation coefficients (R 2 values) were compared. The binding curves that gave rise to the highest R 2values were chosen for presentation. Competition data were fit to Equation 4, which describes competition between bound ligand and competitor for binding to the same site. %Nucleic acid bound=nonspecific binding+(total−nonspecific binding)(1+[competitor]/IC50)Equation 4 Values of IC50, the concentration of competitor at which binding of labeled heteropolymeric RNA was reduced by 50%, were determined by nonlinear regression analysis. Error bars shown for the values of IC50 as a function of oligonucleotide competitor length show the 90% confidence interval for each IC50value, calculated from the standard error of the individual competition curves. These experiments were performed to determine the minimal size of RNA that could be bound by the poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. We tested the ability of small RNA oligonucleotides of different lengths to compete for binding of poliovirus polymerase to a 116-nt labeled RNA to which multiple polymerase molecules bind cooperatively (9Pata J.D. Schultz S.C. Kirkegaard K. RNA. 1995; 1: 466-477PubMed Google Scholar). The effectiveness of competition is measured as the IC50, the concentration of RNA oligonucleotide (in nucleotides) at which binding to the 116-nt RNA is inhibited by 50%. The IC50 values are linearly related to the Kd and therefore reflect the binding energy of the complex between the competing RNA oligonucleotide and polymerase. Two outcomes are possible, depending on the nature of the polymerase-RNA interaction. If a protein binds to RNA noncooperatively or binds to RNA cooperatively but without an appreciable change in binding energy when its entire RNA-binding site is filled, the outcome shown in Fig. 1 A will be observed. In this case, the affinity of RNA oligonucleotides smaller than a single binding site and those that can accommodate only one protein molecule will be approximately a function of the number of nucleotides, with each nucleotide contributing equal binding energy. Then, when the RNA oligonucleotide is long enough to accommodate two proteins, an increase in binding affinity that reflects the energy of the protein-protein interaction may or may not be observed. A second possible outcome would be observed if the energy/nucleotide of the protein-RNA interaction were to increase when the RNA-binding site was filled (Fig. 1 B). One possible reason for this effect would be a conformational change in the protein upon binding to a complete site. Large apparent conformational changes upon DNA binding have been reported for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase and RecA (16Patel P.H. Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Tantillo C. Clark A.D. Raag R. Nanni R.G. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5351-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 17Kumar K.A. Mahalakshmi S. Muniyappa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26162-26170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Stole E. Bryant F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20322-20328Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Another example of large increases in binding affinity with only small increases in oligonucleotide length was seen in the binding of E. coli cyclic AMP-binding protein to small DNA molecules (19Liu-Johnson H.N. Gartenberg M.R. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 995-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In this case, DNA-binding determinants are located on opposite sides of single cyclic AMP-binding proteins. Once a DNA molecule is large enough to contact both sites simultaneously, its binding affinity for cyclic AMP-binding protein increases dramatically (19Liu-Johnson H.N. Gartenberg M.R. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 995-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). If either of these effects were to contribute additional energy to the binding of small homopolymeric RNAs long enough to fill the binding site of poliovirus polymerase, comparing the effectiveness of competition of different length oligonucleotides would be a useful technique to measure the binding site size. This is the approach taken in the experiments described below. Poliovirus polymerase has been shown to bind to heteropolymeric RNA with little sequence specificity and relatively low affinity, but high cooperativity (Ref. 9Pata J.D. Schultz S.C. Kirkegaard K. RNA. 1995; 1: 466-477PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). Fig.2 A shows the highly cooperative binding of purified polymerase to full-length transcripts of poliovirus RNA. The lack of sequence specificity of polymerase binding makes it reasonable to use homopolymeric RNAs to compete with heteropolymeric RNAs for polymerase binding. Fig. 2 B shows that poly(C) and poly(U) proved to be good competitors, whereas neither poly(G) nor poly(A) competed effectively with heteropolymeric RNA for polymerase binding under these conditions, chosen to optimize the cooperativity of polymerase binding (9Pata J.D. Schultz S.C. Kirkegaard K. RNA. 1995; 1: 466-477PubMed Google Scholar). The poor competition observed with polypurines could be due to alternative structures formed by polypurines. Competition experiments with oligonucleotides of different lengths, described below, employed uridylyl oligonucleotides of varying size. To test the effect of oligonucleotide length on its affinity for poliovirus polymerase, oligo(U) molecules of varying lengths thought to span a range of sizes smaller than one polymerase-binding site, sufficient to bind one polymerase molecule, and perhaps long enough to bind two or multiple polymerase molecules were synthesized. The recently determined structure of poliovirus polymerase has revealed that the direct distance between corresponding residues in the active sites of adjacent polymerase molecules in the crystal is ∼46 Å (11Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). An observed correlation between cooperative RNA binding by polymerase and polymerase activity has led us to hypothesize that the template for poliovirus polymerase is single-stranded RNA complexed with cooperatively bound polymerase molecules (9Pata J.D. Schultz S.C. Kirkegaard K. RNA. 1995; 1: 466-477PubMed Google Scholar). If polymerase molecules can bind head-to-tail in a fiber along regions of an RNA molecule, the bound single-stranded RNA is expected to traverse the length of each polymerase molecule. Depending on the conformation of the bound RNA, the length of RNA bound to a site that is at least 46 Å in length could range from 16 or more nucleotides for an A-form conformation to as few as 8 nt for an extended single-stranded conformation. These values are based on observed internucleotide distances of ∼6.0 Å/nt for the highly extended single-stranded RNAs bound to U1A spliceosomal protein (20Oubridge C. Ito N. Evans P.R. Teo C.-H. Nahai K. Nature. 1994; 372: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), of ∼5.0 Å/nt for the single-stranded DNA bound to bacteriophage T4 gene 32 protein (21Shamoo Y. Friedman A.M. Parsons M.R. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and of 2.8 Å/base pairs for A-form RNA (22Arnott S. Hukins D.W. Dover S.D. Fuller W. Hodgson A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 81: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A shows the cooperative binding of poliovirus polymerase to a 116-nt RNA derived from the poliovirus genome. This RNA, considerably smaller than the full-length viral RNA used in Fig. 2, was used to avoid masking the effect of competitor oligonucleotides by the high degree of cooperativity seen with very long RNAs. Half-maximal binding of polymerase to the 116-nt RNA occurred at ∼3 μm polymerase 3D. Competition experiments were then performed using a lower concentration of polymerase (2 μm) to maximize sensitivity of the competition assay. Oligo(U) molecules 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 nt in length were tested for their affinities for poliovirus polymerase in competition experiments against the 116-nt RNA. Fig.3 B shows individual competition curves of oligo(U)6–24. The individual data points were fit to an equation that describes competition for binding to one site. The cross-hairs in each graph denote the IC50 in nanomolar nucleotides. A lower IC50 value indicates greater affinity for the polymerase. For lengths smaller than 8 nt, the RNAs did not compete effectively (Fig. 3 B). In fact, conditions under which competitor oligo(U)4 (data not shown) and oligo(U)6displayed any competition, and therefore any measurable binding to polymerase, were not achieved. When the length of the oligo(U) reached 10 nt, however, substantial competition for binding to the 116-nt labeled RNA was seen. Little further increase in the ability to compete was observed until the longest RNA oligonucleotide, oligo(U)24, was tested. When the IC50 values determined in Fig. 3 B are plotted as a function of oligonucleotide length, it is clear that appreciable binding to polymerase was not observed until the RNA reached a length of 10 nt (Fig. 4). The drop in IC50 at 10 nt is substantial: the addition of 2 nt to an RNA oligonucleotide of 8 nt decreased the IC50 by ∼20-fold, and the addition of 2 nt to an RNA oligonucleotide of 10 nt decreased the IC50by only 2-fold. It is not likely that the change in affinity for polymerase at 10 nt represents the length of RNA to which two polymerase molecules can be cooperatively bound, both because the site size of cooperative polymerase binding is likely to be at least 8 nt to span between polymerase active sites and because no appreciable binding affinity was observed for RNA oligonucleotides smaller than 10 nt in length. We consider it likely that the RNA-binding site is ∼10 nt and that a binding site that is fully occupied has much greater affinity for its RNA substrate than a binding site that is only partially filled by its RNA substrate. The IC50 values decrease somewhat linearly with the length of the oligo(U) from oligo(U)12 to oligo(U)22. Modest increases in affinity with increasing oligonucleotide lengths, even if only one polymerase can be bound to each oligonucleotide, are expected due to “lattice effects”: in a longer polymer, there are more ways to occupy a site of defined length than in a shorter one (24Jensen D.E. Kelly R.C. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7215-7228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 24 nt, a larger apparent increase in oligo(U) affinity was seen that is likely to correspond to the addition of a second polymerase molecule (Fig. 4). If the minimal binding site for a single polymerase is 10–12 nt in length, then polymerase binding to oligo(U) molecules that contain only a single binding site may reveal the intrinsic affinity of polymerase for RNA, separated from the protein-protein interactions that are likely to dominate the energetics of polymerase binding to longer RNAs. Direct binding of polymerase to oligo(U)24, predicted to contain two binding sites for polymerase, would then reflect the intrinsic affinity of two polymerase molecules for RNA as well as the protein-protein interactions between the polymerases. Fig. 5 compares the direct binding of wild-type polymerase to oligo(U)12 and oligo(U)24. The affinity of polymerase for oligo(U)12 was much less than half of that seen for oligo(U)24. Furthermore, the apparent cooperativity of binding to oligo(U)12 was less than binding to oligo(U)24 (Fig. 5). While these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that one polymerase molecule binds to oligo(U)12 and two polymerase molecules bind cooperatively to oligo(U)24, it is interesting that the binding of polymerase to oligo(U)12 still displayed some cooperativity. It may be that interactions between RNA-bound polymerase and free polymerase can increase the strength of RNA binding. To test the method of titration with oligonucleotides of increasing length on a well known cooperative single-stranded binding protein, we tested the effect of oligonucleotide competition on the binding of bacteriophage T4 gene 32 protein to both the 116-nt RNA and a 46-nt heteropolymeric single-stranded DNA. Site sizes of binding for gene 32 protein monomers from 5 to 10 nt have been reported (21Shamoo Y. Friedman A.M. Parsons M.R. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A.

Nature. 1995; 376: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The extent of cooperativity can be varied by changing the binding conditions: the use of RNA-binding substrates, for example, is known to disfavor cooperative binding under many conditions (26Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 75-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 27Newport J.W. Lonberg N. Kowalczykowski S.C. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A simple binding curve of gene 32 protein to the 116-nt RNA at relatively low salt concentrations is shown in Fig.6 A. The noncooperative nature of this binding (n = 1.0) is readily seen. The effect of competing the RNA-binding signal observed at 0.6 μmgene 32 protein with varying lengths of oligo(dT) (Fig. 6 B) and the derived IC50 values as a function of deoxyoligonucleotide length (Fig. 6 C) were determined. The IC50 values remained relatively constant over the range of deoxynucleotide lengths tested. To test whether DNA oligonucleotides could be bound cooperatively under these conditions, the binding of gene 32 protein to a 46-nt single-stranded DNA heteropolymer was performed (Fig.7 A). A simple binding curve proved to be highly cooperative with respect to gene 32 protein concentration (n = 2.7). When the DNA-binding signal observed at 0.22 μm gene 32 protein was competed using oligo(dT) molecules of increasing length (Fig. 7 B), very little effect of deoxyoligonucleotide length on the IC50values was again observed (Fig. 7 C). The IC50values plotted against deoxyoligonucleotide length resulted in the graph shown in Fig. 7 C. A small drop in IC50 was reproducibly observed between oligo(dT)8 and oligo(dT)9. The expression strategy of all picornaviruses, including poliovirus, dictates that approximately equimolar amounts of viral enzymes (such as proteases and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D) and capsid proteins are synthesized. Sixty molecules of each capsid proteins are required to encapsidate each RNA genome. Thus, given the proportionately large quantities of polymerase available, it is possible that the 3D polypeptide also functions as a single-stranded binding protein. Thus far, the poliovirus polymerase has not been reported to bind specifically to any RNA sequence. However, any specificity could easily have been masked by the high degree of cooperativity. Now it can be appreciated that fairly small RNAs must be screened for those that contain specific polymerase-binding sites that might nucleate RNA binding. The single-stranded RNA-binding activity could play numerous roles in the infectious cycle, as suggested by the functions served by other single-stranded RNA-bi"

The molecular mechanisms of secretin receptor signal termination are unknown. Using transiently transfected HEK 293 cells expressing the secretin receptor, we investigated its mechanisms of desensitization. Binding of [125I]-secretin to plasma membranes of receptor-expressing cells was specific, with a Kd of 2 nm. Secretin evoked an increase in cellular cAMP with an EC50 of 0.4 nm. The response was maximal by 20 min and desensitized rapidly and completely. Immunoprecipitation of a functional, N-terminal epitope-tagged secretin receptor was used to demonstrate agonist-dependent receptor phosphorylation, with an EC50 of 14 nm. Pretreatment with protein kinase A or C inhibitors failed to alter secretin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are known to be involved in the desensitization of Class I G protein-coupled receptors; therefore, the effect of cotransfection of GRKs on secretin-stimulated cAMP signaling and phosphorylation was evaluated. GRKs 2 and 5 were the most potent at augmenting desensitization, causing a 40% reduction in the maximal cAMP response to secretin. GRK 5 also caused a shift in the EC50 to the right (p < 0.05). GRK 4 and GRK 6 did not alter dose-dependent signaling, and GRK 3 was intermediate in effect. Receptor phosphorylation correlated with desensitization for each GRK studied, whereas second messenger-dependent kinase phosphorylation appeared to be less important in secretin receptor signal termination.We demonstrate agonist-dependent secretin receptor phosphorylation coincident with profound receptor desensitization of the signaling function in HEK 293 cells, suggesting a role for receptor phosphorylation in this paradigm. Although GRK activity appears important in secretin receptor desensitization in HEK 293 cells, protein kinases A and C appear to play only a minor role.

These results demonstrate that the GRK-arrestin system regulates Class II G protein-coupled receptors. The gastrointestinal hormone secretin stimulates pancreatic water and bicarbonate secretion, leading to neutralization of acidic chyme in the intestine. Secretin also plays a role in gastric acid release and intestinal motility. Secretin exerts these effects by binding to specific heptahelical membrane receptors and activating the heterotrimeric G protein, Gs, leading to elevation of cellular cAMP levels. Receptor sequence analysis has divided G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptors; GRK, GPCR kinase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; dATPαS, deoxyadenosine 5′-(α-thiol)triphosphate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PKA and PKC, protein kinase A and C, respectively. into subfamilies: I) rhodopsin/β-adrenergic, II) secretin/glucagon, and III) the metabotropic glutamate receptor families (1Birnbaumer M. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1995; 15: 131-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 2Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). The secretin/glucagon receptor subfamily comprises a structurally distinct class of receptors, designated Class II. This group consists of receptors for secretin, glucagon, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating peptide, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and others. These receptors lack many of the structural signature sequences present in the prototypic rhodopsin/β-adrenergic receptor family of GPCR (Class I) (1Birnbaumer M. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1995; 15: 131-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). GPCR signaling is dynamically regulated. The rapid process by which GPCR-mediated signals are attenuated is termed desensitization. Although the mechanisms of desensitization have been well characterized for the β-adrenergic receptor family, the mechanisms regulating Class II GPCR signal transduction are largely unknown. Typically, signal termination occurs via two distinct pathways (2Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Mechanisms that modulate only stimulated GPCRs are termed homologous desensitization. Receptor phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) is believed to be a major component of this rapid diminished responsiveness for Class I receptors (3Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 4Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-353PubMed Google Scholar). Other modes of signal attenuation that involve second messengerdependent protein kinases acting on both active and unstimulated receptors are termed heterologous desensitization (2Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 5Lohse M.J. Andexinger S. Pitcher J. Trukawinski S. Codina S. Faure J.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8558-8564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both protein kinase A and protein kinase C have been shown to play a role in this mode of desensitization (2Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). With the cloning of the secretin receptor (6Ishihara T. Nakamura S. Kaziro T. Takahashi T. Takahashi K. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), it is now possible to investigate the molecular basis of its desensitization. Previous work on the secretin receptor has been hampered by lack of appropriate biochemical tools to demonstrate specific receptor protein phosphorylation. Recently, Ozcelebi et al. (7Ozcelebi F. Holtmann M.H. Rentsch R.U. Rao R. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 818-824PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated a secretin-stimulated phosphorylated protein that migrated at 57,000–62,000 on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, consistent with the predicted molecular weight of the secretin receptor. This band was not present when a C-terminal-truncated mutant secretin receptor was stimulated with agonist. In contrast, Holtmann et al.(8Holtmann M.H. Roettger B.F. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23566-23571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) studied a mutant secretin receptor with the C-terminal putative phosphorylation sites removed and noted that desensitization was still present. This persistent desensitization suggested that phosphorylation at these sites might not be important in the signal termination of the secretin receptor. Many questions remain concerning the regulation of the secretin receptor. Is this receptor a substrate for GRK phosphorylation? Are specific GRK-dependent processes involved? Does receptor phosphorylation correlate with desensitization? What is the role of second messenger-dependent phosphorylation? In this paper we demonstrate agonist-dependent secretin receptor phosphorylation by immunoprecipitation of an N-terminal FLAG-tagged secretin receptor, coincident with profound functional receptor desensitization, suggesting a role for receptor phosphorylation in desensitization. Signaling, as determined by cAMP accumulation in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293 cells), appears to be unaffected by second messenger-dependent kinases, whereas agonist-activated G protein-coupled receptor kinases play a significant role. GRK-specific phosphorylation of the secretin receptor is shown to correlate with signal attenuation. Understanding the molecular basis for secretin receptor regulation may provide information relevant to an entire class of structurally distinct receptors and should aid in our understanding of the processes they regulate.

HEK 293 cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium (10% fetal bovine serum, 50 mg/liter gentamicin) at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. One day after transfection, cells were split into appropriate plates after trypsin dissociation. Experiments were performed 24–36 h after transfection. Transient transfections were performed with calcium phosphate co-precipitation. 1–10 μg of vector DNA was transferred into a 6-ml Falcon tube with 450 μl of sterile water and 50 μl of 2.5 m CaCl2. Then 500 μl of 2× HEPES-buffered saline (0.28 m NaCl, 0.05 mHEPES, 1.5 mm Na3PO4, pH 7.1) was added to the tube and mixed well. This mixture was added dropwise to the 100-mm dish of cells. Cells were plated to a density of approximately 2–3 × 105 cells to each well for cAMP accumulation experiments and 1–1.5 × 106 cells/well for phosphorylation. All steps were performed at 4 °C. Plates were placed on ice, media was aspirated, and the cells were washed with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. 5–10 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors: 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were added to each plate. With a cell lifter, cells were scraped off the plate and placed in 15-ml conical tubes on ice. Cell fragments were homogenized with a Polytron PT 3000 for 20–30 s at 14,000-16,000 cps. Material was centrifuged at 300–400 × g for 10 min to remove unlysed cells and nuclei. Supernatant was transferred to 13 × 100-mm tubes on ice and centrifuged at 18,000 rpm (40,000 × g) (Sorval SM24 rotor) for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was discarded, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in binding buffer for immediate assay or lysis buffer and stored at −80 °C. Membrane binding was performed as published (9Farouk M. Vigna S.R. McVey D.C. Meyers W.C. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: 963-968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, using a constant amount of HEK 293 membrane protein, cold displacement (porcine secretin; Peninsula Labs) of 125I-porcine secretin binding was performed in duplicate tubes. Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled porcine secretin. Data was analyzed using Graph Pad-Prism and LIGAND software as described (9Farouk M. Vigna S.R. McVey D.C.

The accumulation of cAMP in intact cells was quantitated chromatographically by the method Salomon (15Salomon Y. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 150: 22-29Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with [3H]adenine (1 μCi/ml) in modified Eagle's medium, 5% fetal bovine serum, 50 mg/liter gentamicin (1 ml/well) 12–16 h before experimentation. To assay the accumulation of cAMP, labeling media was aspirated, and cells were washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and preincubated in 1 ml of media/well (modified Eagle's medium, 0% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine; assay medium) for 15–30 min. Cells were stimulated with appropriate agonist, and at the end of the experimental duration, media was aspirated, and 1 ml of ice-cold stop solution (0.1 mm cAMP, 4 nCi/ml [14C]cAMP, 2.5% perchloric acid) was placed in each well. Plates remained on ice at 4 °C for 20–30 min, after which solution was transferred to 12 × 75 tubes containing 100 μl of 4.2 m KOH. Tubes were vortexed and stored at 4 °C for cAMP determination by column chromatography (15Salomon Y. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 150: 22-29Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For experiments requiring pretreatment with protein kinase inhibitors, transfected cells were incubated in 30 μm H89 or staurosporine for 20 min and then stimulated with secretin in the presence of H89 or staurosporine at doses noted for 10 min. Control experiments were performed in parallel to ensure activity of the inhibitors. Data is normalized for total cellular uptake using [14C]cAMP as described previously (15Salomon Y.

Cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (66 μCi/well) for 1 h in phosphate-free modified Eagle's medium, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. Agonist was applied as indicated in figure legends. Treatment was stopped by placing the cells at 4 °C and washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (3 ml/well) twice and then adding 400 μl/well of radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mmNaF, 10 mm disodium pyrophosphate, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml benzamidine). Lysed cells from 2 wells (800 μl) were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes on ice and rotated on an inversion wheel for 1 h. Solubilized material was transferred to Beckman TLA 100.2 tubes for centrifugation at 200,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to 1.5-ml tubes on ice with 100-μl protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in 3% bovine serum albumin and radioimmune precipitation buffer. An aliquot of supernatant was removed for protein determination (Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit). After a 1-h preclearing, beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was transferred to 1.5-ml tubes with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads and 16 μg of monoclonal IgG-M2-FLAG (Eastman Kodak Co.). Samples were placed on an inversion wheel at 4 °C. After 2 h, beads were pelleted, and supernatant was discarded. Beads were washed three times with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer was added to each sample to provide the same membrane protein/volume of sample for gel loading. Immune complexes were dissociated by heating to 65 °C for 10 min and resolved on a 1-mm thick, 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. Dried gels were analyzed quantitatively with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. In plasmid co-transfection experiments, receptor expression was determined by flow cytometry analysis of a sample from each transfection group. The fluorescence was determined by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with monoclonal IgG-M2-FLAG (1:500 dilution, Kodak), three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, and detection with Fc-specific, fluorescein-labeled goat anti-mouse (1:200 dilution, Sigma). Cells were then washed, removed from the plate with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, and fixed with 3.6% formaldehyde. Samples were analyzed within 1 h on a Becton-Dickinson flow cytometer. Base-line fluorescence was determined from a sample of HEK 293 cells untransfected and/or a sample of HEK 293 cells transfected with the secretin receptor not exposed to primary antibody (IgG-M2-FLAG). Base-line fluorescence was subtracted from each sample. Receptor fluorescence was normalized to total cellular protein determined from an aliquot of each transfection sample before immunoprecipitation. Gel lanes were loaded with the same amount of receptor protein. Binding studies with cell membranes prepared from HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with the native rat secretin receptor and the N-terminal FLAG secretin receptor cDNA demonstrated an identical KD for secretin binding (2.3 nm) with a Vmax of 0.5–1.0 pmol/mg of protein (data not shown). Ligand binding was specific and not significantly competed for by either excess glucagon or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (data not shown). Secretin elicited dose-dependent whole cell cAMP accumulation, with an EC50 of 0.4 nm and 0.07 nm for the native and N-terminal FLAG-tagged rat secretin receptor, respectively, with identical Vmax values (Fig.1 A). The rat secretin receptor demonstrated rapid and complete desensitization in response to agonist occupancy (Fig. 1 B). The rate of cAMP accumulation decreased with a half-time of 7 min, and no further cAMP accumulation occurred after 20 min (Fig. 1 B). Cross-desensitization experiments using either vasoactive intestinal polypeptide or glucagon as the stimulus in cells coexpressing these receptors indicate that this desensitization is homologous (data not shown). Given the rapid nature of secretin receptor desensitization, receptor phosphorylation was examined as a likely mechanism for signal attenuation. Studies of desensitization of the rhodopsin and adrenergic receptors have demonstrated the importance of receptor phosphorylation (2Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 3Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 4Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-353PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of the FLAG epitope to the N terminus of the rat secretin receptor provides the opportunity to demonstrate unequivocal secretin receptor protein phosphorylation by immunoprecipitation (Fig.2, A and B). The major phosphorylated protein in receptor-expressing cells runs as a broad band of 55–65 kDa and is not present in immunoprecipitates from cells not expressing FLAG-secretin receptor. Agonist-dependent phosphorylation occurs with an EC50 of 14 nm (Fig. 2 B). There is a small component of basal (agonist-independent) phosphorylation; however, agonist stimulation increased this signal 4–10-fold (Fig.2 A). The functional N-terminal FLAG-tagged receptor represents a suitable tool for studying specific secretin receptor protein phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Class I GPCRs can occur by second messenger-dependent mechanisms or by G protein-coupled receptor kinase activity (2Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 4Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-353PubMed Google Scholar). In HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with the secretin receptor and pretreated with 30 μm H89, a PKA inhibitor, no significant enhancement in cAMP generation was observed. Similarly, 1 μmstaurosporine, a PKC inhibitor, had no significant effect on cAMP accumulation (Fig. 3). Dose-response curves were generated to investigate the potential effects of these kinases over the full range of agonist concentrations. The EC50 for cAMP accumulation was 0.3 nm for secretin alone, or in the presence of H89 or staurosporine and only a minor increase in the maximal cAMP, accumulation was evident at high agonist concentrations (Fig. 3). Under these conditions, H89 and staurosporine can effectively inhibit protein kinase A and C. Despite the lack of effect of PKA and PKC inhibition on secretin receptor signaling, the effect of the kinase inhibitors on receptor phosphorylation was examined. Interestingly, preincubation with 30 μm H89 and 1 μm staurosporine produced a 50% decrease in secretin receptor phosphorylation (Fig.4, A and B). This effect was present whether cells were stimulated with high (0.1 μm) or low (1 nm) secretin concentrations for 2 min. These results suggest that in HEK cells, phosphorylation of the secretin receptor by PKA or PKC occurs but does not appreciably modulate its signaling efficiency. However, in COS 7 cells similarly transfected with the rat secretin receptor, preincubation with these protein kinase inhibitors significantly augmented secretin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, indicating that the second messenger-regulated protein kinases may be involved in receptor regulation in other cell types (data not shown). The ability of PKA and PKC to regulate secretin receptor signaling in COS 7, but not in HEK 293 cells, is likely due to the relatively low content of GRKs in COS 7 cells as compared with HEK 293 cells (18Menard L. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Lin F.-T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).Figure 4Secretin receptor phosphorylation by immunoprecipitation. HEK 293 cells overexpressing secretin receptor with preincubation of 30 μm H89 or 1 μm staurosporine (Stauro) or media (vehicle) receptor phosphorylation was determined as under “Experimental Procedures.” Preincubation was for 18 min, and stimulation with secretin (0.1 μm) was performed for 2 min. A, representative gel of receptor protein demonstrating basal (−) and agonist-stimulated (+) receptor phosphorylation.

Similar data were generated with 1 nm agonist stimulation (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The lack of effect of PKA and PKC inhibitors on cAMP signaling in HEK 293 cells transfected with the secretin receptor suggests that GRKs might play the predominant role in receptor phosphorylation in these cells. This is supported by the short time course of desensitization and the fact that receptor phosphorylation occurred within 1 min of agonist stimulation (data not shown) (19Lohse M. Benovic J.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3202-3209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the potential involvement of G protein-coupled receptor kinases on both phosphorylation and signaling by co-transfecting HEK 293 cells with each of five different GRKs (GRK 2–6). Since GRK-mediated phosphorylation has been shown to occur within seconds to minutes, phosphorylation was examined at 2 min after agonist exposure. As shown in Fig. 5, secretin receptor phosphorylation varied by GRK subtype. GRKs 2, 3, and 5 significantly enhanced agonist-stimulated receptor protein phosphorylation. Expression of GRKs 3 and 5 increased phosphorylation up to -15 fold compared with the level apparent with endogenous cellular GRKs. However, overexpression of GRKs 4 and 6 did not significantly increase basal or agonist-stimulated secretin receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 5, A and B). GRK 5 was the only GRK to have an effect on basal phosphorylation (Fig. 5 B). In the absense of agonist, overexpressed GRK 5 doubled basal secretin receptor phosphorylation. Coexpression of members of the GRK 2 subfamily (GRK 2 and 3) with the secretin receptor caused significant signal attenuation, reducing maximal cAMP accumulation by 39 and 26%, respectively (Fig. 6 and TableI). These GRKs also caused a shift in the secretin EC50 to the right (Fig. 6). The EC50shifted from 0.48 nm for the native receptor to 0.69 and 1.28 nm with cotransfection of GRK 2 and 3, respectively (Fig. 6 A, Table I). This is in contrast to GRKs 4 and 6, which had no significant effect on signal generation. the Vmax was 89 and 92% with EC50 0.78 and 0.85 nm for GRK 4 and 6, respectively (Table I). GRK 5 was the most potent of the GRKs evaluated, in reducing both Vmax (40% reduction) and shifting the EC50 (to 1.37 nm) (Fig. 6 B, TableI).Figure 6cAMP accumulation in HEK 293 cells cotransfected with empty vector or with GRKs. cAMP accumulation was measured as under “Experimental Procedures.” Whole cell stimulation with secretin was performed at doses indicated for 2 min.

The recently resolved crystal structure of RGS4 bound to Giα1 suggests two potential mechanisms for the GAP activity of RGS proteins as follows: stabilization of the Giα1 switch regions by RGS4 and the catalytic action of RGS4 residue Asn128. To elucidate a role of the Asn residue for RGS GAP function, we have investigated effects of the synthetic peptide corresponding to the Gα binding domain of human retinal RGS (hRGSr) containing the key Asn at position 131, and we have carried out mutational analysis of Asn131. Synthetic peptide hRGSr-(123–140) retained its ability to bind the AlF4−-complexed transducin α-subunit, Gtα·AlF4−, but failed to elicit stimulation of Gtα GTPase activity. Wild-type hRGSr stimulated Gtα GTPase activity by ∼10-fold with an EC50 value of 100 nm. Mutant hRGSr proteins with substitutions of Asn131 by Ser and Gln had a significantly reduced affinity for Gtα but were capable of substantial stimulation of Gtα GTPase activity, 80 and 60% of Vmax, respectively. Mutants hRGSr-Leu131, hRGSr-Ala131, and hRGSr-Asp131 were able to accelerate Gtα GTPase activity only at very high concentrations (>10 μm) which appears to correlate with a further decrease of their affinity for transducin. Two mutants, hRGSr-His131and hRGSr-Δ131, had no detectable binding to transducin. Mutational analysis of Asn131 suggests that the stabilization of the G-protein switch regions rather than catalytic action of the Asn residue is a key component for the RGS GAP action.

Mutational analysis of Asn131 suggests that the stabilization of the G-protein switch regions rather than catalytic action of the Asn residue is a key component for the RGS GAP action. The intensity and duration of signaling via heterotrimeric G-proteins is regulated at multiple levels. The key reaction in termination of G-protein-mediated signaling is the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα subunits that convert the active GTP-bound conformation of G-protein α subunits (Gα·GTP) to the inactive Gα·GDP conformation. The GTPase activity of two G-proteins, Gq and transducin, is stimulated by their effectors, phospholipase Cβ and cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE), 1The abbreviations used are: PDE, cGMP phosphodiesterase; RGS proteins, regulators of G-protein signaling; hRGSr, human retinal RGS protein; ROS, rod outer segment(s); dROS, hypotonically washed ROS membranes; Gtα, rod G-protein (transducin) α-subunit; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); PCR, polymerase chain reaction. respectively (1Arshavsky V.Y.

Strong evidence suggests that members of this family, GAIP, RGS4, RGS1, RGS10 and others, negatively regulate G-protein signaling by stimulating GTPase activity of G-proteins, particularly those from Gi and Gq families (7Berman D.M.

RGS proteins from yeast to mammals share a highly conserved RGS domain that provides relatively broad specificity of different RGS proteins toward members of the two G-protein classes in vitro. Tissue expression patterns and diverse domains outside the RGS segment may play an important role in determining specificity of RGS proteins in vivo (10Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 11Chen C. Zheng B. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol.

Precise mechanisms of RGS GAP activity are not yet clear. The transition state during GTP hydrolysis is thought to be mimicked by the AlF4−-bound conformation of Gα subunits (13Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 14Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that many RGS proteins interact preferentially with the AlF4−-bound conformation of Gα subunits and thus may accelerate GTP hydrolysis through stabilization of the transitional state of G-proteins (8Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 15Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 12885-12889Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of RGS4 bound to Giα1·AlF4−has been solved at a resolution of 2.8 Å (17Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). This structure provides the first structural insights into the mechanism of RGS protein action. The conserved RGS core forms three distinct sites of interaction with the three switch regions of Giα1 suggesting that stabilization of the switch regions and Gα residues directly involved in GTP hydrolysis may be a major component of RGS GAP activity (17Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RGS proteins could also contribute catalytic residues to the active site and thus enhance the GTPase rate constant. The conserved residue Asn128 of RGS4 makes a contact with the side chain of Gln204 of Giα1 which stabilizes and orients the hydrolytic water molecule in the transitional state of Giα1 (17Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Asn128 also may be localized within hydrogen-bonding distance of the hydrolytic water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the GTP γ-phosphate (17Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). In this study we evaluate a potential catalytic role of the Asn residue for Gα GTPase acceleration by RGS proteins using the interaction between human retinal RGS (hRGSr) protein and transducin as a model system and mutational analysis of Asn131 of hRGSr which is equivalent to Asn128 of RGS4.

Mutagenesis of Asn131 residue of hRGSr was performed using PCR amplifications from the pGEX-KG-hRGSr template (22Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol.

XXX indicates nucleotides that generate substitutions of Asn131 (AAC) in hRGSr cDNA by the following amino acid residues: Ala (GCG), Asp (GAT), His (CAT), Leu (CTG), Gln (CAG), Ser (AGC), and deletion mutant (—). PCR reactions were performed in 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 1 ng of the pGEX-KG-hRGSr plasmid, 3 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), 25 mmTris-(hydroxymethyl)-methylaminopropane sulfonic acid, pH 9.3, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 200 μm of dNTPs, and 0.5 μm primers. Conditions for PCR were as follows: 94 °C for 3 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 64 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 3 min. The PCR products (∼220 base pairs) were blunt-ended with Klenow fragment and digested with XhoI. Wild-type hRGSr cDNA was subcloned into XbaI/XhoI sites of pBluescript polylinker. The resulting construct was digested with HincII and XhoI and ligated with the XhoI-digested PCR products carrying mutations. The mutant sequences were verified by automated DNA sequencing at the University of Iowa DNA Core Facility using the T7 primer and subcloned into the XbaI/XhoI sites of pGEX-KG vector for protein expression. Mutant GST-hRGSr proteins were expressed in DH5αEscherichia coli cells, and the GST portion was removed as described earlier (22Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol.

Typical yields of purified hRGSr and hRGSr mutants, except for a mutant with deletion of Asn131, were 5–6 mg/liter of culture. Deletion of Asn131 led to an ∼4–5-fold reduction in expression of soluble recombinant protein suggesting that the residue at position 131 may be important to the stability and proper folding of RGS proteins. Gtα·GTPγS or Gtα·GDP (10 μg) were incubated with hRGSr or its mutants (50 μg) immobilized on glutathione-agarose in 100 μl of 20 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol (buffer A). Where indicated, the buffer contained 30 μm AlCl3 and 10 mm NaF. After incubation for 20 min at 25 °C, the agarose beads were spun and washed twice with 1 ml of buffer A, and the bound proteins were eluted with a sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Single turnover GTPase activity measurements were carried out in suspensions of dROS membranes containing 5 μm rhodopsin and 0.4 μmtransducin essentially as described in Refs. 22Natochin M.

Bleached dROS membranes were mixed with different concentrations of the tested peptides, hRGSr or hRGSr mutants, and preincubated for 5 min at 25 °C. The GTPase reaction was initiated by addition of 100 nm [γ-32P]GTP (∼5 × 104dpm/pmol) in a total volume of 20 μl. At 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 s aliquots of the reaction mixture were withdrawn and quenched with 7% perchloric acid. Nucleotides were then precipitated using activated Norit A charcoal (10% w/v) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and 32Pi formation was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The GTPase rate constants were calculated by fitting the experimental data to an exponential function: % GTP hydrolyzed = 100 (1 −e −kt), where k is a rate constant for GTP hydrolysis. A peptide, CSEAPKEVNIDHETRELT, corresponding to residues 123–140 of hRGSr was custom made by Genosys Biotechnologies Inc. The N and C termini of the peptide were acetylated and amidated, respectively. The peptide was purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a preparative Dynamax-300A column (Rainin). The purity and chemical formula of the peptide were confirmed by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry and analytical high pressure liquid chromatography. Preparation of synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 21–31, 461–491, 492–516, and 517–541 of rod PDE α-subunit was described previously (24Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol.

Rhodopsin concentrations were measured using the difference in absorbance at 500 nm between “dark” and bleached ROS preparations. Fitting of the experimental data was performed with nonlinear least squares criteria using GraphPad Prizm (version 2) software. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate measurements. The Giα binding region of RGS4 containing Asn128resides in the loop α5–α6 of RGS4 and contains 7 amino acid residues making contacts with all three switch regions of G-protein (17Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The number of interactions is sufficient to ensure a relatively high affinity between the corresponding synthetic peptide and Gα, provided that the peptide is able to adopt a functional conformation. For the preliminary testing of the catalytic role of Asn131of hRGSr, the hRGSr-(123–140)-peptide was synthesized. The length of the peptide was chosen to allow the Gα contact residues to be flanked by at least 3 terminal residues. hRGSr-(123–140) was first examined for its ability to stimulate GTPase activity of transducin in suspensions of dROS membranes containing 5 μm rhodopsin and 0.4 μm transducin. dROS membranes lacked intrinsic catalytic PDEαβ and inhibitory PDEγ subunits. Use of such ROS avoided interference of PDEγ effects with effects of RGS protein or RGS peptide (22Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17444-17449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Wieland T. Chen C.-K. Simon M.I. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7638-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The peptide at concentrations of up to 2 mm had no effect on GTPase activity of transducin (not shown). To determine if hRGSr-(123–140) is capable of binding to transducin, we investigated effects of the hRGSr peptide on the stimulation of GTPase activity of transducin by hRGSr. Fig.1 shows that hRGSr-(123–140) was able to compete with hRGSr for binding to Gtα resulting in a dose-dependent (IC50 = 1.6 ± 0.3 mm) decrease of the stimulated GTPase activity of transducin. hRGSr-(123–140) in the same range of concentrations had no notable effect on the basal transducin GTPase activity (Fig. 1). Because the competition experiments were carried out at a concentration of hRGSr causing half-maximal stimulation of the GTPase activity, the affinity of hRGSr-(123–140) for Gtα can be estimated as 0.8 mm. In control experiments, four unrelated peptides (24Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19964-19969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) corresponding to residues 21–31, 461–553, 492–516, and 517–541 of the rod PDE α-subunit (at concentrations of 8 mm) had no effect on hRGSr-stimulated GTPase activity of transducin (not shown). Recently, we have shown that similar to other characterized RGS proteins, hRGSr binds with high affinity to the AlF4−conformations of transducin and very weakly to the GTPγS and GDP-bound conformations (22Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17444-17449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We evaluated the interaction between hRGSr mutants with substitutions of Asn131 by Ser, Gln, Ala, Leu, His, Asp as well as the mutant with deletion of Asn131 and transducin using precipitation of Gtα with the GST-hRGSr mutant proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. Mutations hRGSr-Ser131 and hRGSr-Gln131 led to a reduction in affinity of the corresponding GST fusion proteins for Gtα·AlF4− (Fig.2 A). Mutants hRGSr-Leu131, hRGSr-Asp131, and hRGSr-Ala131 showed a more significant decrease in their affinity for the Gtα conformation (Fig. 2 A). hRGSr-His131 and hRGSr-Δ131 failed to co-precipitate Gtα·AlF4−. Mutations of Asn131 could potentially alter hRGSr interaction with Gtα·GTPγS and Gtα·GDP since the RGS4 Asn residue makes contact with the switch I and II regions of Giα1 (17Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). We have tested this possibility by preincubating mutant GST-hRGSr containing beads with both conformations of Gtα. None of the seven hRGSr mutants has demonstrated enhanced affinity for either conformation of Gtα compared with the native GST-hRGSr (Fig. 2, B and C). Effects of hRGSr mutants with substitutions of Asn131 were tested in dROS membranes containing 5 μm rhodopsin and 0.4 μm transducin. Under these conditions, the calculated rate of GTP hydrolysis by transducin was 0.025 ± 0.004 s−1 (Fig.3). The rates of transducin GTPase activity were then determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of hRGSr or individual hRGSr mutants and plotted as a function of their concentration. Wild-type hRGSr purified after cleavage of GST-hRGSr with thrombin stimulated GTPase activity of transducin by ∼10-fold to a maximal rate k = 0.27 ± 0.01 s−1 with an EC50 value of 101 ± 14 nm (Fig. 3). All hRGSr mutants had substantially reduced ability to stimulate the GTPase activity of transducin. The tested mutants can be arbitrarily separated into three groups. Two of the mutants, hRGSr-Ser131 and hRGSr-Gln131, were relatively potent, and saturation of their GAP effect could be achieved at 10–40 μmconcentration of mutant. hRGSr-Ser131 mutant was the most effective and stimulated Gtα GTPase activity with an EC50 value of 1.34 ± 0.17 μm and Vmax ∼80% (k = 0.22 ± 0.01 s−1). The mutant hRGSr-Gln131 was capable of accelerating the Gtα GTPase activity to Vmax of 60% (k = 0.16 ± 0.01 s−1) with an EC50 value of 3.9 ± 1.1 μm (Fig. 3). Three mutants, hRGSr-Leu131, hRGSr-Ala131, and hRGSr-Asp131, began to cause acceleration of Gtα GTPase activity only at very high concentrations (>10 μm) (Fig. 3). We were unable to practically achieve saturation of the GAP activity by these mutants due to the very high protein concentrations required. Two mutants, hRGSr-His131 and hRGSr-Δ131, did not show GAP activity at the concentration tested (40 μm). Interestingly, the potency of hRGSr mutants in stimulating Gtα GTPase activity (Fig. 3) appears to correlate well with their ability to bind and precipitate Gtα·AlF4− (Fig.2 A), Experiments in Fig. 2 have suggested that hRGSr mutants with substitutions of Asn131have impaired binding to Gtα·AlF4−. The binding assay may, however, not be sufficiently sensitive to detect relatively weak interactions. To determine if the drastically reduced ability of some RGS mutants to stimulate the GTPase activity of transducin correlates with the lack of mutant binding to transducin, we carried out competition experiments. The hRGSr mutants incapable of accelerating Gtα GTPase activity were examined for their ability to block stimulation of GTPase activity of transducin by hRGSR. Fig. 4 demonstrates that none of the tested mutants, hRGSr-Ala131, hRGSr-His131, and hRGSr-Δ131, at 5 μm concentration, had any effect on stimulation of GTPase activity of transducin by 50 nm hRGSr. These data suggest that the hRGSr mutants that produced no stimulation of Gtα GTPase activity lost their binding to Gtα. Molecular mechanisms of RGS protein action as GAP for heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins are not well understood. Studies on the Ras-specific p120GAP suggest that the Ras GAP donates conserved Arg789 residue to the RAS catalytic site (29Scheffzek K. Lautwein A. Kabsch W. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1996; 384: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 30Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Weismuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar) thus providing the catalytic mechanism for p120GAPactivity. The crystal structure of RGS4 bound to Giα1·AlF4−has suggested two mechanisms for RGS GAP activity toward heterotrimeric G-proteins (17Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Interaction of RGS protein with the G-protein switch regions indicates that the mechanism of the GTPase activation by RGS may primarily be a reduction in the free energy of the transitional state via stabilization of Gα switch regions and residues directly involved in GTP hydrolysis (17Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). An additional putative mechanism for the RGS GAP activity would be a donation of the catalytic residue to the active site of Gα. The only residue that RGS4 introduces into the active site of Giα1 is Asn128. Although Asn128, in contrast to the Ras GAP Arg789 or an intrinsic Arg in Gα subunits, does not directly interact with GDP and AlF4−(13Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G.

Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar), it makes a contact with the side chain of Gln204 of Giα1, which stabilizes and orients the hydrolytic water molecule in the transitional state of Giα1. Conceivably, Asn128 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the hydrolytic water molecule and may bind and orient it for nucleophilic attack of the γ-phosphate of GTP (17Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). To probe the role of Asn131 of hRGSr for the mechanism of RGS protein GAP activity, we initially synthesized a peptide of hRGSr corresponding to the region of interaction between Giα1·AlF4−and RGS4 containing Asn128. We reasoned that if the catalytic role of the Asn residue is a major component of RGS GAP activity, then perhaps a peptide containing the catalytic residue would alone be capable of eliciting the stimulation of GTPase activity. Our data demonstrated that hRGSr peptide-(123–140) containing catalytic Asn131 retained the ability to bind hRGSr but failed to accelerate the GTPase activity of transducin. This indicates that the interaction of at least two and likely all three Gα binding regions of RGS protein is required to stimulate Gα GTPase activity. Consistent with this conclusion is the recent finding that even short deletions within the RGS domain of RGS4 destroyed its GAP activity (31Popov S. Yu K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the role of Asn131 of hRGSr was carried out using mutational substitutions of this residue. The major result from testing all hRGSr mutants is that replacement of Asn131 with other residues dramatically decreases the affinity of mutant hRGSr binding to Gtα. Substitution of Asn131 by Ser was intriguing because the Asn residue is not absolutely conserved in RGS proteins, and some RGS proteins, including GAIP, have a Ser at this position (5De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 17Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 31Popov S. Yu K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Serine has proven to be the best substitution for Asn with respect of retaining the GAP activity of hRGSr protein. The hRGSr-Ser131 mutant had more than 10-fold lower affinity for Gtα but can stimulate its GTPase activity nearly as well as native hRGSr (Vmax ∼80%). Therefore, it is not surprising that this residue was evolutionary selected instead of Asn for some RGS proteins. Interestingly, the reported concentrations of the Ser containing RGS domain of retina-specific RET-RGS1 (1 μm) and GAIP (5 μm) required for the half-maximal GTPase stimulation of transducin are comparable to the EC50 value for hRGSr-Ser131 (28Nekrasova E.R. Berman D.M. Rustandi R.R. Hamm H.E. Gilman A.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7638-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32Faurobert E. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 93: 2945-2950Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). An indication that the Asn residue may indeed serve to some extent as a catalytic residue was provided by the hRGSr-Gln131 mutant. The effects of this mutant on GTPase activity of transducin nearly reached a plateau at only ∼60%Vmax of that observed with hRGSr. However, effects of other hRGSr mutants argue against a catalytic role of the Asn residue as the key component of the RGS GAP activity. The hRGSr-Leu131 and hRGSr-Ala131 mutants at very high concentrations started to have a stimulatory effect on Gtα GTPase activity even though these residues are not expected to form hydrogen bonds which are made by the Asn residue. Our mutational analysis suggests that although Asn131 of hRGSr may play a catalytic role in the RGS GAP activity, stabilization of the switch regions of G-protein and reduction of the energy of the transition state appear to be the major components of the RGS GAP function. The Asn residue is absolutely essential for the stabilization of the transition state for GTP hydrolysis because its replacement or deletion leads to a drastic reduction in hRGSr affinity for Gtα. In addition to their role as GAPs, RGS proteins may act as antagonists for some G-protein effectors, particularly for phospholipase Cβ. RGS4 has been shown to block activation of phospholipase Cβ by GqαGTPγS (33Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In another study, RGS4 inhibited inositol phosphate synthesis activated by AlF4− in COS-7 cells overexpressing Gq (34Yan Y. Chi P.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11924-11927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Tesmer et al. (17Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) have suggested that the RGS proteins lacking the Asn residue may better serve as inhibitors of effector binding than as GAPs. This would appear to be a likely scenario if replacements of the Asn residue resulted in a loss of GAP activity without a concurrent reduction of the RGS protein affinity for activated Gα subunits. The results of this work suggest that the main consequence of Asn replacement is an impairment of binding between mutated hRGSr protein and Gtα. Furthermore, none of the hRGSr mutants have shown enhanced affinity to the active Gtα·GTPγS conformation which could be indicative of the potential of such a mutant to serve as an antagonist for the G-protein effector. This study only begins to address the questions, introduced by the first crystal structure between G-protein and RGS protein, about the mechanism of RGS protein GAP activity (17Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Further biochemical analysis coupled with resolution of other crystal structures between activated Gα subunits and RGS proteins would ultimately define a role of the critical Asn residue."

In eukaryotic cells, most RNA molecules are extensively processed during and following transcription from their corresponding genes. Modifications in RNAs include 5′ capping, 3′ polyadenylation, splicing, and editing as well as modifications on the base, sugar, and/or phosphate residues. The CCA addition on the 3′-end of transfer RNAs and polyadenylation on the 3′-end of eukaryotic mRNAs are two important 3′-end modifications that have been extensively studied. Addition of CCA on the 3′-end of tRNAs is ubiquitous, occurring in many evolutionarily distant species including bacteria, yeast, plants, and animals (1Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA (N.Y.). 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar). The terminal adenylic acid residue in tRNAs serves as an attachment site for amino acids, and the CCA sequence also participates in the aminoacyl reaction on the ribosome (reviewed in Ref. 1Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In some cases the CCA sequence is encoded within the gene; however, in most cases the CCA sequence is not encoded in the corresponding tRNA genes. The CCA sequence turns over rapidly in all tRNAs, and in most cases, tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for CCA addition/turnover, is an essential enzyme (1Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition to tRNAs, RNAs synthesized by Qβ (phage Qβ RNA polymerase) replicase possess a 3′-terminal adenylic acid that is not encoded in the gene (3Bausch J.N. Kramer F.R. Miele E.A. Dobkin C. Mills D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1978-1984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The function of this 3′-terminal adenylic acid in the case of Qβ is not known.

Nature. 1975; 256: 144-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic pre-mRNAs are cleaved 10–30 nucleotides downstream of a conserved sequence AAUAAA, which also serves as a binding site for cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor. The polyadenylation is a complex reaction requiring at least five factors, several of which have multiple protein subunits (5Sachs A. Wahle E. J. Biol.

The poly(A) tail has important functions in translation, mRNA degradation, and possibly in transport across the nuclear membrane and in intracellular localization (5Sachs A. Wahle E. J. Biol.

Many of the recently identified small nucleolar RNAs are derived from intervening sequences of pre-mRNAs, which are synthesized by RNA polymerase II (22Leverette R.D. Andrews M.T. Maxwell E.S.

In this study, we characterized the 3′-terminal nucleotide of several small RNA species and found that in every case examined, a fraction of the RNA contained a post-transcriptionally added adenylic acid residue that is not present in the corresponding gene. In the case of 7SL and 7SK RNA, this post-transcriptional adenylation was found in 70% of the RNA molecules. These data indicate that in many human small RNA molecules, a deletion of one or more 3′-end nucleotides that had been incorporated during transcription is followed by the addition of one adenylic acid residue. In addition, an in vitro system capable of efficient and accurate adenylation has been developed. All radioisotopic nucleotides [α-32P]ATP, [α-32P]CTP, [α-32P]GTP, [α-32P]UTP, and [5′-32P]pCp were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. RNA ligase was obtained from New England Biolabs. All other fine chemicals were from Sigma. Nuclease P1, T1 RNase, T2 RNase, and monoclonal anti-trimethylguanosine antibodies were obtained from Calbiochem. Preparation of HeLa cell nuclear extract from cultured HeLa cells was carried out by the procedure of Dignam et al. (25Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar); the whole HeLa cell extract was prepared by the method of Weil et al. (26Weil P.A. Segall J. Harris B. Ng S.-Y. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6163-6173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final protein concentration of the extract was 4 mg/ml. For in vitro labeling of RNAs, 5 μl of 10× in vitrotranscription buffer (6 mm each GTP, UTP, and CTP, 250 μm ATP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm KCl, 60 mm creatine phosphate, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), 40 μl of nuclear extract, and 50 μCi of [α-32P]ATP were mixed in a total reaction volume of 50 μl and incubated at 30 °C for various time periods. Labeled RNA was extracted using the phenol-chloroform procedure, purified, and fractionated on a 12% polyacrylamide, 7 murea gel. Whenever necessary, the labeled RNAs were excised from the gel, and the RNA was eluted and purified. These RNAs were then digested with various enzymes and analyzed by chromatography and/or size fractionation on 20% polyacrylamide gels. HeLa cell 4–8S RNA was isolated as described earlier (27Reddy R. Li W-Y. Henning D. Choi Y.C. Nohga K. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8452-8457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used for ligation with [5′-32P]pCp and RNA ligase according to England et al. (28England T.E. Bruce A.G. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). DNA dot hybridizations were carried out as described by Kafatos et al. (29Kafatos F.C. Jones C.W. Efstratiadis A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1541-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of RNA was carried out as described by Lerner and Steitz (30Lerner M. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5495-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The hybrid-selected RNAs or the RNAs from the immunoprecipitates were further purified by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel, and individual RNAs were subjected to further analyses. The RNAs were digested with nuclease P1 at a 1:1500 (w/w) enzyme to substrate ratio at 37 °C for 30 min. Complete digestion with T1 or T2 RNase were carried out as described by Brownlee et al.(31Brownlee G.G. Sanger F. Barrell G.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 34: 379-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoresis of T2 RNase digestion products was carried out on Whatman 3MM paper in a Savant voltage electrophoresis unit using 5% acetic acid, ammonium hydroxide buffer, pH 3.5). Chromatography on cellulose plates was performed in a solvent isobutyric acid/water/ammonium hydroxide (66:33:1, v/v/v) as described by Silberklang et al. (32Silberklang M. Gillum A.M. RajBhandary U.L. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 59: 58-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The radioactivity in each nucleotide was quantitated on a Betagen scanner. The 3′-terminal sequences of 7SL and 7SK RNAs were determined by a novel T4 RNA ligase/PCR-based approach (33Kiss T. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2913-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). HeLa cell 4–8S RNA was fractionated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. 7SL RNA and 7SK RNAs were recovered and ligated to a 5′-phosphorylated deoxyoligonucleotide that was blocked at its 3′-end with cordecypin (oligo 1, 5′-pGATAGTGTCACCTAAATGAATTCC(3′-dA)-3′) with T4 RNA ligase. The ligation product was then used as a template for synthesis of cDNA and subsequent PCR amplification using the TitanTMOne Tube reverse transcription-PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim). The two primers used for reverse transcription-PCR were an oligonucleotide complementary to oligo 1 (oligo 2, 5′-GGAATTCATTTAGGTGACACTATC-3′) and an internal primer corresponding to positions 220–239 of 7SL RNA (oligo 3, 5′-ACTCCCGTGCTGATCAGTAG-3′) or an internal primer (oligo 4, 5′-TGCTAGAACCTCCAAACAAGC-3′) corresponding to positions 211–232 of human 7SK RNA. PCR amplification products were gel-purified, ligated into the TA cloning vector PCRTM 2.1 (Invitrogen), and transformed into DH5α cells. Colonies were randomly picked and sequenced using oligo 3 or oligo 4 as primers. HeLa whole cell extract prepared by the method of Weil et al. (26Weil P.A. Segall J. Harris B. Ng S.-Y. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6163-6173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was incubated with [α-32P]ATP, and the RNAs were fractionated on a polyacrylamide gel. Since tRNAs are known to undergo terminal CCA turnover (1Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the tRNAs were the predominant labeled RNAs (Fig. 1, lane 1). Instead of whole cell extract, HeLa nuclear extract prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (25Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) was used, and when [α-32P]ATP was used as the precursor in addition to tRNA, several RNAs were labeled; two of these labeled RNAs were prominent, and their mobility corresponded to 7SL RNA (Fig. 1, lane 5). There was no detectable labeling in 7SL RNA when [α-32P]UTP, [α-32P]GTP, or [α-32P]CTP was used as the labeled precursor (Fig. 1, lanes 6–8). To obtain evidence that these labeled RNAs are 7SL RNAs, hybrid selection was carried out, and nitrocellulose filters containing immobilized 7SL DNA hybrid-selected both of the 7SL RNA bands (Fig. 1, lane 11). DNAs corresponding to abundant RNAs in the 300 nucleotide size range were also used for hybrid selection, and none of these DNAs hybrid-selected any labeled RNAs (Fig. 1, lanes 10 and 12–13). These data show that the two RNA bands labeled with [α-32P]ATP correspond to 7SL RNA; in addition, there was no detectable incorporation of labeled ATP into 7SK, mitochondrial RNA processing, or RNase P RNAs. When the RNAs from the nuclear extract were stained with methylene blue, 7SL and 7SK as well as mitochondrial RNA processing RNAs were clearly visible (data not shown). These data show that although the nuclear extract contained many ribonucleoproteins, 7SL RNA in human signal recognition particles was preferentially labeled under the in vitro conditions employed. In addition, there was also significant labeling observed in other small RNAs such as 5S RNA and U2 and U6 snRNAs (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 9; also see Fig.2 A). The kinetics of labeling was also carried out with labeled UTP and CTP. There was no significant labeling of 7SL RNA, even after 5 h of incubation. However, U6 snRNA was labeled when labeled UTP was used as a precursor, and its kinetics of labeling was significantly different (Fig. 2 B) from the kinetics of adenylation of 7SL RNA or tRNA (Fig.2 A). The kinetics of labeling with [α-32P]CTP into tRNA was identical to that observed with [α-32P]ATP (data not shown). The time course of adenylation of tRNAs and 7SL RNA was studied. The labeling of transfer RNA reached a plateau within 1 h of incubation and remained nearly constant for up to 10 h (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the adenylation of 7SL RNA was continuing even after 10 h of incubation, the longest time period tested. In addition, there appears to be a lag period of 2 h before significant labeling in 7SL RNA was detectable (Fig. 2 A, bottom panel). These data indicate that the kinetics of adenylation of tRNAs and 7SL RNA are distinct. In addition to the adenylation of 7SL RNA, there was also labeling of 5S RNA (Fig. 2 A), and the kinetics of labeling of 5S RNA was similar to that observed for 7SL RNA. However, the kinetics of 5.8S RNA labeling was different. There was rapid labeling within 1 h, and there was no radioactivity detectable after 3 h of incubation (Fig. 2 A, top panel). The turnover of terminal adenylic acid residues in small RNAs was studied by initially labeling for 2 h and then diluting the labeled ATP with a 200-fold excess of unlabeled ATP. The tRNA turned over rapidly with a half-life of about 2 h, whereas the turnover of 7SL RNA was very slow (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, there was continued labeling of 7SL RNA for 2 h after the addition of unlabeled ATP, indicating that labeled ATP is first being transferred to an intermediate and then to the 3′-end of 7SL RNA. This intermediate may be the adenylating enzyme itself or other cofactors. The slow labeling of 7SL RNA and slow turnover of 7SL RNA suggest that the transfer of ATP to the intermediate may be the rate-limiting step in this adenylation reaction. The kinetics of 7SL RNA labeling was also studied after preincubation of the nuclear extract with and without the addition of 10 μm unlabeled ATP. Preincubation in the presence of unlabeled ATP is expected to saturate the putative intermediate, and the subsequent addition of labeled ATP will result in marked reduction in the incorporation of labeled ATP. Fig. 2 D shows the results obtained when this experiment was carried out. The top panel shows the labeling of 7SL RNA when labeled ATP was added to nuclear extract preincubated for 2 h without or with the addition of unlabeled ATP. At every time point, there was significantly less incorporation of ATP into 7SL RNA when the extract was preincubated with unlabeled ATP (Fig. 2 D, bottom panel). For example, after 5 h of labeling, there was 2.5 times less radioactivity incorporated into 7SL RNA in sample preincubated with unlabeled ATP. These data are consistent with the formation of an intermediate with slow turnover. To determine the number of adenylic acid residues added to the 3′-end of 7SL RNA, the labeled 7SL RNAs (see Fig. 1, lane 5) were isolated and digested with various enzymes, and the products were analyzed. The human 7SL RNA from HeLa cells fractionated into two distinct bands, designated 7SL-1 and 7SL-2 RNAs. The 3′-end sequences of both 7SL-1 and 7SL-2 RNAs are identical (34Ullu E. Murphy S. Melli M. Cell. 1982; 29: 195-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 35Labuda D. Zietkiewicz E. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 39: 506-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and therefore, in many instances data obtained with only 7SL-1 RNA are presented; identical results were obtained when 7SL-2 RNA was analyzed. Digestion of in vitro adenylated 7SL RNA with nuclease P1 yielded pA in the case of both tRNA (Fig.3, lane 1) and 7SL RNA (Fig.3, lane 2). Digestion of tRNA with T2 RNase yielded only Cp (Fig. 3, lane 3), whereas digestion of labeled 7SL RNA with T2 RNase resulted in Up, Ap, and Cp in the ratio of 96:3:1 (Fig. 3, lane 4). Although, the resolution between Gp and Up is not adequate in the one-dimensional chromatography used in Fig. 3, there was no detectable radioactivity in Gp when the T2 RNase digest of 7SL RNA was fractionated on a two-dimensional chromatography system (data not shown). These data show that most of the labeled adenylic acid residues were ligated to U-OH on the 3′-end of the 7SL RNA through phosphodiester bond. Digestion of 7SL RNA with T1 RNase and fractionation on a 20% polyacrylamide gel resulted in a major RNA band UCUCUp*A-OH and a minor band UCUCUAp*A-OH (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3). It is worth noting that approximately 70% of the 7SL RNA contains 3′ A-OH and only 30% of the 7SL RNA 3′-ends contain U-OH (Ref. 36Li W. Reddy R. Henning D. Epstein P. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5136-5142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; also see Fig. 5). Therefore, these data show that 7SL RNA with UCUCU-OH is a preferred substrate for adenylation, and 7SL RNA with UCUCUA-OH is adenylated at a very low frequency.Figure 5Identification of post-transcriptionally added A residue in 7SL and 7SK cDNA preparations. The 7SL (Fig. 5 A) and 7SK cDNA (Fig. 5 B) clones prepared as described under “Materials and Methods” were subjected to sequencing by the method of Sanger et al. (49Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52671) Google Scholar) and subjected to autoradiography. The post-transcriptionally added adenylic acid is shown with an asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The small RNAs isolated from HeLa cells were ligated to [5′-32P]pCp using RNA ligase, and the 7SL RNAs were hybrid-selected and then purified by fractionation on a polyacrylamide gel. The 3′-end-labeled 7SL-1 and 7SL-2 RNAs were isolated, digested with T1 RNase, and fractionated on a 20% polyacrylamide gel. Two major bands were obtained in the case of 7SL-1 RNA (Fig. 4, lane 5) and 7SL-2 RNA (Fig. 4, lane 6). These two fragments, designated A and B, were isolated, and the 3′-end nucleotide was determined by digesting these fragments with T2 RNase and analyzing the products. Fragment A yielded only Up (Fig. 4, lane 8), indicating that this fragment corresponds to UCUCU-OH in the 7SL RNA. Fragment B yielded mostly Ap (88%) and some Up (12%), (Fig. 4, lane 9), showing that these fragments correspond to UCUCUA-OH (88%) and UCUCUU-OH (12%) of 7SL RNA. These data also show that adenylic acid residues are present on the 3′-end of 7SL RNA isolated from cells, and the adenylation observed in vitro does reflect adenylation that is occurring in HeLa cells. These results are also consistent with our earlier observation (36Li W. Reddy R. Henning D. Epstein P. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5136-5142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) where rat 7SL RNA was shown to contain both A-OH and U-OH on its 3′-end. A similar analysis was also carried out with 7SK RNA labeled with pCp. 7SK RNA digested with T1 RNase yielded three fragments designated C, D, and E (Fig. 4, lane 7). These three fragments were analyzed for 3′-end nucleotide, and both Ap and Up were observed in different ratios (Fig. 4, lanes 10–12). These data along with similar analyses of 3′-end sequences of ribosomal 5S RNA and nuclear U2 and U6 RNAs are summarized in Table I. These data show that in each of these small RNAs, there is a deletion of one or more 3′-end nucleotides incorporated during transcription followed by the addition of one adenylic acid residue on the 3′-end of 7SL, 7SK, U2, U6, and ribosomal 5S RNAs.Table IPost-transcriptional adenylation of human small RNAs in vivoRNAGene sequencePrimary transcriptPost-transcriptional adenylationTrimming%Adenylation%7SL RNAGTCTCTTTT/GCCCCCCCTCCCGUCUCUUUU-OHGUCUCUU-OH30GUCUCUUA-OH70GUCUCU-OHGUCUCUA-OH5S RNAGGCTTTT/TCTTTGGGGCUUUU-OHGGCUUU-OHGGCUUUA-OHGGCUU-OH90GGCUUA-OH10GGCU-OHGGCUA-OH7SK RNAGCCTTTCTTTT/GACCCATTACCCGCCUUUCUUUU-OHGCCUUUCUUU-OHGCCUUUCUUUA-OHGCCUUUCUU-OH40GCCUUUCUUA-OH60GCCUUUCU-OHGCCUUUCUA-OHU2 snRNAGGTGCACCCCCTCCGGGGA/GGUGCACCCCCGGUGCACC-OH30GGUGCACCA-OH70UCCGGGGA-OHU6 snRNAGTTCCATATTTT/TACATCAGGGUUCCAUAUUUU-OHGUUCCAUAUUU-OHGUUCCAUAUUUA-OHGUUCCAUAUU-OH90GUUCCAUAUUA-OH10GUUCCAUAUGUUCCAUAUA-OH Open table in a new tab In addition to ligation of pCp to determine the 3′-end sequence, a deoxyoligonucleotide with a 5′-phosphate was ligated to 7SL RNA, and cDNA clones were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” Eighteen independent cDNA clones were sequenced, and 10 out of 18 clones contained adenylic acid corresponding to position 300 of 7SL RNA; five of the clones contained U at this position. Two representative sequences corresponding to A at position 300 (Fig. 5 A, left panel) and U at position 300 (Fig. 5 A, right panel) are shown. These data provide additional evidence for the presence of post-transcriptional addition of adenylic acid residue on the 3′-end of 7SL RNA in HeLa cells. A similar strategy was used to characterize cDNA preparations prepared from 7SK RNA, and clones containing U as well as A on the 3′-end were obtained. Two cDNA representative clones are shown in Fig. 5 B. These data are consistent and support the notion that in many small RNAs, 3′-trimming of these RNAs is followed by adenylation. To investigate the possibility that addition of adenylic acid residue is a common phenomenon, several small RNAs were isolated, and their 3′-end nucleotides were determined. In every case that was analyzed, there was some proportion of each RNA that contained adenylic acid residue on the 3′-end (Fig.6). In the case of U6 snRNA, it is clear that adenylic acid present on the 3′-end is due to the post-transcriptional addition, since there is no adenylic acid in the corresponding position in U6 snRNA gene. However, since the U1, U4, and U5 snRNA genes contain A in the corresponding position, one cannot conclude that post-transcriptional adenylation is occurring in these three snRNAs. The main observations made in this study are that human 7SL RNA as well as human 5S, U1, U2, U6, and 7SK RNAs have a post-transcriptionally added adenylic acid residue on their 3′-ends in a subpopulation of these RNAs. In addition, we developed a cell-free system where post-transcriptional adenylation is occurring accurately. Data obtained in this study indicate that adenylation may be a common event occurring in many cellular RNAs. The adenylation of 7SL RNA observed in vitro was also found to be occurring in the HeLa cells. Adenylic acid residue was reported on the 3′-end of rat (36Li W. Reddy R. Henning D. Epstein P. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5136-5142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human 7SL RNA (37Walter P. Blobel G. Nature. 1982; 299: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Ullu and Weiner (38Ullu E. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 3303-3310Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) characterized the human 7SL RNA and the corresponding genes and concluded that adenylic acid on the 3′-end is post-transcriptionally added. Since the 7SL RNA adenylated in vitro contained UCUCUA-OH (Fig. 4), which corresponds to the 3′-end sequence in 70% of the 7SL RNA molecules isolated from HeLa cells (Table I and 36–38), the adenylation occurring in the nuclear extracts faithfully reflects the in vivo situation. It is interesting to note that only a single adenylic acid residue is added to the 3′-end of 7SL RNA. Although 70% of the 7SL RNA 3′-ends contain A-OH, only 30% of the 7SL RNA molecules contain U-OH as the 3′-end. However, virtually all of the adenylation occurs on the U-OH containing 7SL RNAs. Only 3% of the molecules have two adenylic acid residues (see Fig. 3). Consistent with these data, all 10 3′ A-containing clones (Fig. 5 A) contained only one adenylic acid residue. Therefore, in logarithmically growing HeLa cells, in vitro adenylation of 7SL RNA is limited to the addition of one adenylic acid residue. The 7SL RNA molecules that are already adenylated are poor substrates for further adenylation. Analysis of the 3′-ends of 5S RNA, 7SK RNA, and U2 snRNA also showed that only one adenylic acid residue to be present on their 3′-ends. However, these data do not rule out a small percentage of 7SL, 7SK, 5S, or U2 snRNAs that contain multiple adenylic acid residues. O'Brien and Wolin (39O'Brien C.A. Wolin S.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2891-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) characterized 66 Xenopus 5S RNA clones and found that 13 of the sequenced clones contain a single adenylic acid residue on their 3′-end. These data show that only a single A residue is being added to the 3′-end of 5S RNA, and adenylation of small RNAs is also occurring in amphibians. Although adenylation was found to be the major post-transcriptional addition found in these small RNAs, small RNAs also contained a small percentage of C and G on their 3′-ends (see Fig. 6). A fraction of the ribosomal 5S RNA stored in the oocyte was found to contain post-transcriptionally added C, G, A, or U on its 3′-end (15Denis H. Wegnez M. Biochimie (Paris). 1973; 55: 1137-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These results indicate that 3′-ends of small RNAs are extended in many different ways. The kinetics of adenylation of 7SL RNA were very different from the adenylation of tRNAs (Fig. 2). Although adenylation of tRNA reached steady state within 1 h, the adenylation of 7SL RNA continued even at 10 h, the longest time period tested. The kinetics of adenylation of 5S RNA was very similar to that of 7SL RNA (Fig. 2) in that there was continued labeling at 10 h. In addition, the turnover of terminal adenylic acid in 7SL RNA was very slow when compared with the turnover of tRNA. The slow labeling and slow turnover of 7SL RNA indicates that the enzyme(s) involved in the adenylation of 7SL and other RNAs may be a complex, and transfer of the labeled ATP to these enzyme(s)/cofactors may be the rate-limiting step in this adenylation reaction. Most of the RNAs synthesized by RNA polymerase III, including 7SL, 7SK, 5S, and U6 RNAs, terminate with the UUUU-OH sequence on their 3′-ends. Four small RNAs investigated in this study, namely human 7SL RNA, 7SK RNA, 5S RNA, and U6 snRNA, are synthesized by RNA polymerase III and terminated with UUUU-OH. Therefore, identification of adenylic acid residues corresponding to these uridylic acid residues provides evidence for deletion of uridylic acid residues and for post-transcriptional adenylation. The observation that U2 snRNA synthesized by RNA polymerase II also undergoes adenylation indicates that this adenylation reaction is not confined to RNAs synthesized by one type of RNA polymerase. It is surprising that in some small RNAs like ribosomal 5S and U6 snRNA, both uridylation and adenylation are occurring on the 3′-end. It is possible that uridylation and adenylation are two competing events, and the variability in the percentage of adenylation on the 3′-end of small RNAs may reflect the product of these two competing events (see Table I). In the case of 5S and U6 snRNA, the uridylation seems to be a dominant event resulting in >80% of uridylic acid on their 3′-ends. In contrast, adenylation appears to be a dominant event in the case of U2, 7SL, and 7SK RNAs, resulting in about 70% adenylic acid on their 3′-ends. Where does adenylation of RNAs occur in the cells? We do not have data to conclude that adenylation of small RNAs is occurring in any one subcellular compartment. The fact that U6 snRNA, which does not leave the nucleus (40Vankan P. McGiugan C. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3397-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) does contain post-transcriptionally added adenylic acid residues, indicates that the necessary enzymatic machinery must be present in the nucleus. In addition, nuclear extracts adenylated better than whole cell extracts (Fig. 1), suggesting that enzyme/substrate combination is more optimal for adenylation in the nuclear extract. In addition, results from Dahlberg and co-workers (41Yang H. Moss M.L. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) previously showed that deletion of the terminal nucleotides in U1 snRNA occurred in the nucleus after its return from the cytoplasm. If U2 snRNA follows the same maturation pathway, it is likely that the adenylation of U2 snRNA is occurring in the nucleus. Further studies are needed to determine where in the cell and at what stage in the maturation of RNAs adenylation of small RNAs occurs. Finally, the most important question is what is the function of this adenylation? It is unlikely that cells will be carrying out this adenylation reaction unless there is a need for this adenylation. The fact that this adenylation reaction is occurring in RNAs of diverse origin, subcellular localization, and functions indicates that this adenylation may have function(s) related to synthesis and/or turnover of cellular RNAs. In this context it is interesting to note that Piper et al. (42Piper P.W. Bellatin J.A. Lockheart A. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and Kempers-Veenstra et al. (43Kempers-Veenstra A.E. Oliemans J. Offenberg H. Dekker A.F. Piper P.W. Planta R.J. Klootwijk J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2703-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) observed that yeast cells deficient in an exonuclease accumulate 5S RNA molecules that have multiple adenylic acid residues on the 3′-end. Xu and Cohen (44Xu F. Cohen S.N. Nature. 1995; 374: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) provided evidence for adenylation-mediated degradation of RNAs in bacteria. Following this analogy, it is possible that human small RNAs are also degraded through an intermediate where small RNAs are first polyadenylated. The results on RNA degradation in the yeast system showed that deadenylation of poly(A) tail is a requirement. Both stable and unstable yeast mRNAs were shown to follow a decay pathway in which deadenylation leads to either internal cleavage or decapping followed by 5′ → 3′ exonucleolytic degradation of the mRNA (45Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). There are no data on the post-transcriptional adenylation of corresponding small RNAs in the yeast cells. The small RNAs, such as human U2 snRNA, with one adenylic acid residue on the 3′-end, are known to be very stable in the cell (46Weinberg R.A. Penman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 38: 289-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is unlikely that the adenylation characterized in this study makes these human small RNAs less stable. However, it is possible that these small RNAs containing a single adenylic acid residue on their 3′-ends are polyadenylated and then targeted for degradation. If true, small RNAs with longer poly(A) tail on the 3′-end should be less stable. This possibility needs to be tested experimentally. In this context, it is interesting to note that two distinct populations of RNAs exist for both mouse B2 RNA and human telomerase RNA; one population contains a poly(A) tail, and another population contains no poly(A) tail on the 3′-end (47Kramerov D.A. Tillib S.V. Ryskov A.P. Georgiev G.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 6423-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 48Chapon C. Cech T.R Zaug A.J. RNA (N.Y.). 1997; 3: 1337-1351PubMed Google Scholar). These data show that some small RNAs go through a polyadenylation phase during their metabolic cycle.

Regarding functional properties, these fragments retain the ability to bind nucleotides, although with reduced affinity compared with intact Ca2+-ATPase.

The p29/30 soluble domain, like similar proteolytic fragments that can be obtained from other P-type ATPases, may be useful for obtaining three-dimensional structural information on the cytosolic portion of these ATPases, with or without bound nucleotides. From our findings we infer that a real hinge region with conformational flexibility is located at the C-terminal boundary of p29/30 (rather than in the conserved region of residues 670–760); we also propose that the ATP-binding cleft is mainly located within the p29/30 domain, with the phosphorylation site strategically located at the N-terminal border of this domain.

From our findings we infer that a real hinge region with conformational flexibility is located at the C-terminal boundary of p29/30 (rather than in the conserved region of residues 670–760); we also propose that the ATP-binding cleft is mainly located within the p29/30 domain, with the phosphorylation site strategically located at the N-terminal border of this domain. The detailed structure of membrane proteins is only known in a few cases. Among P-type ATPases, which are responsible for active cation transport, the best structure to date is only known to about 14 Å resolution, from cryo-electron microscopy; this is for Ca2+-ATPase, which catalyzes uptake of Ca2+from the cytosol to the endoplasmic or sarcoplasmic Ca2+-storing compartment (1MacLennan D.H.

However, large three-dimensional crystals of the protein are not available as yet, and the ATPase structure has been mainly deduced from electron microscopy studies of two-dimensional crystals (3Toyoshima C.

By comparing structures of Ca2+-ATPase with and without bound nucleotide, suggestions have been made concerning the likely location of the ATP-binding site in the cytoplasmic portion of this pump (10Yonekura K. Stokes D. Sasabe H. Toyoshima C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 997-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but the actual structure of the ATP-binding site and the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis are still largely unknown. Nevertheless, it has been hypothesized that this region of the Ca2+-ATPase might be organized like water-soluble phosphokinases, with a hinge transiently bringing an ATP-binding and a phosphate-accepting region in close apposition during the ATPase enzymatic cycle (Ref. 11Taylor W.R. Green N.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar and reviewed in Refs. 8Møller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell Biol. 1998; 23: 33-99Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar).As a first step toward determining the structure of the entire ATPase, it would be useful to determine the structure of smaller fragments, provided that such fragments reflect the structure of the corresponding region in the intact protein. A few studies have paved the way in this direction, by trying to express in bacterial systems soluble fragments of ATPase with anticipated autonomous functional properties (13Capieaux E. Rapin C. Thines D. Dupont Y. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21895-21900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Moutin M.J. Cuillel M. Rapin C. Miras R. Anger M. Lompré A.M. Dupont Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11147-11154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolysis experiments can contribute to the success of such studies, since protease-resistant fragments probably constitute domains whose structural properties can be investigated with minimal risk of instability. Following our previous analysis of Ca2+-ATPase proteolysis by proteinase K (15Juul B. Turc H. Durand M.L. Gomez de Gracia A. Denoroy L. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20123-20134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we now report on the properties of closely related proteolytic fragments with molecular masses of 29/30 kDa, derived from the large cytosolic loop, which we show retain many of the properties of the corresponding region in intact Ca2+-ATPase. In view of the stability and functional properties of these fragments, we suggest that such a soluble 30-kDa fragment of Ca2+-ATPase could be a reasonable candidate for future three-dimensional structure determination. From our results we also infer possible implications for the organization of the cytosolic portion of P-type ATPases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMost of the methods used in this report have been described in detail previously, including the isolation of SR 1The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; Asp-N, endoproteinase Asp-N; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; FITC, fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Tes, N-tris[hydroxymethyl]methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; Bis-Tris, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)iminotris(hydroxymethyl)methane; Tricine, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; ; C12E8, octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether; TNP-nucleotides, 2′,3′-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)nucleotides; λex, excitation wavelength; λem, emission wavelength; bw, spectral bandwidth; inner filter effect, fluorescence reduction due to absorbance by the sample of excitation or emission wavelength. vesicles (16Champeil P.

Bahr U. Ingendoh A. Nordhoff E. Stahl B. Strupat K. Hillenkamp F. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1990; 241: 175-185Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF spectra of proteolytic peptides were obtained with a Voyager-Elite Biospectrometry Workstation mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA). Each sample was first desalted and then loaded on the target by the dried droplet method; the matrix was 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid, Aldrich). Spectra were calibrated externally with a two-point calibration using the [M + H+] and the [M + 2H+] ions from a protein standard, horse apomyoglobin (m/z = 16952.5 and 8476.8, respectively). The analysis was performed in the positive and linear modes, with an accelerating voltage of 25,000 V. Different extraction delays were used (150, 275, or 400 ns), and around 120 scans were averaged. Typically, the amount of peptide analyzed was 5–10 pmol.MALDI-TOF spectra were run to determine the C termini of the soluble fragments produced by proteolysis (see Fig. 1) with various proteolytic enzymes. After proteolysis, samples were processed in one of two ways. In the case of Asp-N, the supernatant of Asp-N-treated SR was simply desalted by passing through a Sephadex G25M column equilibrated with a 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer at pH 8.1 and examined directly by mass spectrometry. Since the N terminus of the 30-kDa proteolytic peptide was already known from N-terminal sequencing, determination of its total mass by MALDI-TOF (to within 10 Da) allowed us to determine its C-terminal residue without ambiguity. In the case of elastase and proteinase K, which are proteolytic enzymes with relatively poor specificity (and also after use of Asp-N, for control), the peptides found in the supernatants of treated SR were further cleaved with trypsin (as shown for proteinase K in Fig. 5), and the smaller peptides generated in this way were then desalted by binding to a C18 reversed phase resin (Sep-Pak, Waters Corp., Milford, MA) and elution with 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) in deionized water (24Rusconi F. Potier M.C. Le Caer J.P. Schmitter J.M. Rossier J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11021-11026Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this case, mass spectrometry revealed two groups of peaks (see Fig. 6) in the 16–17-kDa range and in the 11–12-kDa range, respectively, corresponding to the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of the original peptides, respectively, and confirmed that these peptides had been cut by trypsin at a single site, Arg505-Ala506 (as shown for proteinase K in detail, see “Results”). The masses measured for the 16–17-kDa peptides confirmed the results of the previous N-terminal sequencing experiments. The masses measured for the 11–12-kDa peptides, which corresponded to peptides starting at the trypsin cleavage site (Arg505-Ala506) and ending at the C termini of the original peptides, allowed to identify the latter unambiguously in all cases (again to within 10 Da).Figure 5Sensitivity to trypsin of the Arg505-Ala506 bond in p29/30 fragments, and reactivity of Lys515 toward FITC in these fragments.In this experiment, the same medium was used both for proteolysis with proteinase K and/or trypsin and for labeling with FITC; it contained 0.3 m sucrose, 1 mm Mg2+, 10 μm Ca2+, and 10 mm Tricine-Tris at pH 8 and 20 °C. After samples were run on a SDS-PAGE/Tricine gel, the gel was examined immediately for fluorescence (panel B) and subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue (Coom. blue) (panel A). Lane 7, molecular mass markers (see panel A); the large spot in lane 7 of panel B corresponds to the tracking dye in the migration front. Lane 3, FITC-labeled SR vesicles. Labeling was partial and corresponded to 1 nmol FITC/mg of protein. Lanes 4–6, the same labeled vesicles (2 mg/ml) were submitted to proteolysis, either (i) for 2 min with 125 μg/ml trypsin (lane 4; in panel A, fragments A and B are apparent, as well as A1, A2 superimposed with trypsin (Tr), and the trypsin inhibitor (Tr Inh)), or (ii) for 30 min with 30 μg/ml proteinase K (lane 5, p29/30 peptides are indicated), or again (iii) with proteinase K first, followed by trypsin (lane 6). Lanes 1 and 2, a sample similar to the one for lane 5, but prepared from unlabeled SR vesicles, was centrifuged. The supernatant was then incubated with 2 μmFITC for 30 min and subsequently either (i) loaded onto lane 1, or (ii) submitted to trypsin treatment and then loaded onto lane 2, in the latter case, trypsin (Tr), trypsin inhibitor (Tr Inh), and three smaller peptides (designated as p17/18 and p12) are apparent (panel A). For fluorescence examination, the gel was deposited in a transparent box before acid fixation and Coomassie Blue staining and illuminated with UV light (302 nm). Fluorescence (panel B) was detected with a Kodak Wratten 55 green filter; the white dots are due to fluorescent defects in the plastic box. Panel C, the N termini of p12 peptides derived from trypsin cleavage of either nonlabeled or heavily FITC-labeled p29/30 fragments (see text) were sequenced. PTH-amino acids found after each cycle of Edman degradation were compared for the labeled “p12-FITC” peptide and the unlabeled “p12” peptide (the ratio is plotted). The second alanine residue was not determined quantitatively, hence the ×.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 6MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of proteolytic fragments, after further cleavage by trypsin.

Samples for ultrafiltration (2 ml) were transferred to Centricon 10 tubes and centrifuged for 150 min at 5000 rpm in a Beckman JA-12 rotor. After centrifugation, the various samples were concentrated to about the same extent (about 30-fold), as indicated by measurements of protein concentrations. Protein-bound ATP versus free ATP was determined from the excess ATP in the concentrated sample over that present in the ultrafiltrate, after correction for the small “blank” value (a few %) found in experiments performed with protein-free samples. Control measurements with intact SR vesicles were included. Experiments were performed on samples containing various concentrations of ATP, to which a constant concentration of [γ-32P]ATP tracer was added, to measure competition between nonlabeled and labeled ligand (e.g. Ref. 65Hannaert-Merah Z. Coquil J.F. Combettes L. Claret M. Mauger J.P. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29642-29649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]Glucose was also added as an inert tracer, and the concentrations of ATP were deduced from the ratios of 32P and 3H counts. The data were analyzed in terms of Michaelian binding, according to Equation 1. [EL]/[L]={[Etot]/(Kd+[L])}+αEquation 1 where [EL] and [L] are the concentrations of bound and free ligand (ATP), respectively; [Etot] and Kd are the concentration of binding sites and the binding affinity, and α corresponds to a small fraction of nonspecific binding. Plotting the fraction of ATP bound (i.e. [EL]/[L]) as a function of free ATP ([L]), as in Fig. 4, thus permits us to directly estimate Kd from the concentration of free ATP for which this fraction is reduced to half of its maximal value, obtained at low ligand concentration; in turn, this maximal value, which is equal to {[Etot]/Kd} + α, permits estimation of the concentration of the ATP-binding sites in the sample (Etot). A full description of the method will be given elsewhere. 3T. Menguy, S. Chenevois, F. Guillain, M. le Maire, P. Falson, and P. Champeil, manuscript in preparation. Figure 4Comparison of binding of [γ-32P]ATP to p29/30 fragments and to SR ATPase, as measured in the absence of Mg2+. Ultrafiltration experiments were performed with either intact SR (initially at a concentration of 0.2 mg protein/ml; these experiments are illustrated by circles) or p29/30 fragments (obtained after 30 min proteolysis of SR vesicles at 2 mg protein/ml and centrifugation, essentially as described in the legend to Fig. 3 except that in addition, the supernatant was loaded onto a Centricon 100 device and the ultrafiltrate was collected, to eliminate contamination of soluble peptides by non-pelleted membranes; these experiments are illustrated by triangles). To 1.6-ml aliquots of these protein samples (in 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm Mg2+, 0.01 mm Ca2+, and 10 mm Tricine-Tris at pH 8 and 20 °C), we added 0.2 ml of a concentrated solution containing radioactive ATP and glucose, KCl, Mops-Tris, and EDTA, as well as 0.2 ml of another solution of nonradioactive ATP at various concentrations; final concentrations were 100 mm KCl, 50 mm Mops-Tris (final pH was 7.0, at 20 °C), 240 mm sucrose, 0.8 mm Mg2+, and 1.5 mm EDTA; in the various samples, [3H]glucose was present at an activity of 2 μCi/ml and a total concentration of 1 mm, whereas [γ-32P]ATP was present at a constant activity of 0.4 μCi/ml but at various total concentrations, ranging from 10 μm to 3 mm. These 2-ml samples were loaded onto Centricon 10 devices, and after centrifugation 10-μl aliquots were taken out of the concentrate for double labeling counting (i.e. estimation of total [γ-32P]ATP concentrations) and measurement of the protein concentrations. After taking into account blank experiments performed in the absence of any added protein, the protein-dependent increase in [γ-32P]ATP concentration in the concentrate, for a given total ATP concentrations, was corrected for slight variations in protein concentration. On average, the concentration of protein rose from 0.16 to about 4.8 mg/ml in SR samples. In the experiments with proteinase K-treated SR, we estimated a similar 30-fold increase in peptide concentration. Since 90% of the 29/30 domains was recovered after the proteolysis and Centricon 100 recentrifugation steps, and since the initial SR protein concentration was 10-fold higher in the experiment with proteinase K-treated SR than in that with intact SR (2 mg/ml instead of 0.2 mg/ml), this resulted in a molar concentration of ATP-binding sites 9-fold higher for p29/30 fragments (triangles) than for intact SR ATPase (circles). The data were fitted to Michaelian binding (see “Experimental Procedures”) with Kd = 34 μm, Etot = 15.3 μm (i.e. 3.2 nmol/mg protein), and α = 0.02 for intact SR ATPase, and K′d = 680 μm, E′tot = 138 μm, and α′ = 0.06 for p29/30 fragments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In the case of p29/30 peptides, a special problem arises because these peptides are prepared as the high speed supernatant of protease-treated SR membranes; in such a protocol, a small fraction (possibly a few percent) of the original membranes may escape pelleting, and these non-pelleted membranes may contain a small fraction of either residual intact ATPase or only partially cleaved ATPase (e.g. the membranous p83C peptide, which is able to bind ATP and be phosphorylated, see Ref. 15Juul B. Turc H. Durand M.L. Gomez de Gracia A. Denoroy L. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20123-20134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, for estimation of a binding affinity, contamination of a sample (with an anticipated relatively poor affinity for its ligand) by a component of higher affinity is a real complication (e.g. see Ref. 66Swillens S. Waelbroeck M. Champeil P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 16: 151-155Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To eliminate such contamination, we submitted the p29/30-containing supernatant to a preliminary step of centrifugation on an ultrafiltration membrane with a 100,000-dalton cut-off (2-ml samples were loaded onto Centricon 100 devices and centrifuged for 135 min at 2400 rpm in a Beckman JA-12 rotor); SDS-PAGE showed that contaminating SR membranes were retained by the Centricon membrane but that p29/30 peptides were recovered in the filtrate. These peptides were subsequently used for the ultrafiltration experiments with Centricon 10.Metal-binding Properties of Bis-Tris BufferIn some cases, for treatment of SR vesicles with proteinase K at pH 6.5, we replaced the Bis-Tris buffer of our original standard medium (15Juul B. Turc H. Durand M.L. Gomez de Gracia A. Denoroy L. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20123-20134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) by a Mops/NaOH buffer at the same pH. This is because we found that Bis-Tris buffer (but not Mops/NaOH buffer) binds Ca2+ with an apparent dissociation constant around 25 mm at this pH, so that in the presence of 100 mm Bis-Tris and a certain amount of total Ca2+, the free [Ca2+] is about 5-fold lower than the total [Ca2+]. Although this has no implication for the present results, it explains why, in our previous work (15Juul B. Turc H. Durand M.L. Gomez de Gracia A. Denoroy L. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20123-20134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), unexpectedly high concentrations of Ca2+ were required to protect the ATPase transmembrane bundle from denaturation during proteinase K treatment.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we show that by using various proteolytic enzymes (Fig. 1), it is possible to prepare fragments of Ca2+-ATPase closely related to each other and all originating from the cytosolic portion of this membranous enzyme (TableI). According to hydrodynamic and circular dichroism analysis, these “p29/30” fragments have a compact globular shape with a relatively high content of secondary (α/β) structure (Figs. 7 and 8). They have a significant affinity toward nucleotides (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) and also retain reactivity toward trypsin and FITC, like intact Ca2+-ATPase, and at the same sites (Figs. 5 and 6). All this suggests that these proteolytic fragments, which contain a major fraction of the ATPase cytosolic head, are released without loss of basic structural features from a region which, in the native tertiary structure, constitutes an autonomous structural domain.The reasons why the properties of p29/30 fragments have not been recognized earlier are probably related to the fact that most previous proteolytic investigations on Ca2+-ATPase have been performed with trypsin. Studies with this enzyme have never resulted in production of fragments comparable to those described in the present work because trypsin has an extraordinary potency for cleavage of Ca2+-ATPase in the middle of the molecule, at Arg505-Ala506. We found no evidence for a particular sensitivity of the Arg505-Ala506peptidic bond to proteases other than trypsin; thus, the high sensitivity to trypsin of this bond is probably due to a particular conformation of the Arg505-Ala506 peptidic bond, favorable for trypsinolysis, rather than to a strategic location of this bond at the boundary between two distinct domains of Ca2+-ATPase. It is remarkable that proteolysis fragments similar to our p29/30 fragments have in fact been already described for Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase, after treatment with either trypsin (42Tai M.M.

N-terminal cleavage sites are consistent with a rather superficial localization of the phosphorylatable Asp351 residue, to which phosphorylating substrates must of course have access, in the region delimited by the CSD35"
https://openalex.org/W2079743245,"Treatment of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor leads to a decrease in the number of epidermal growth factor receptors on the cell membrane. The mRNA for the epidermal growth factor receptor decreases in a comparable fashion. This decrease appears due to a decrease in the transcription of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene because first, there is no difference in the stability of the epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA, second, newly transcribed epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA is decreased in nerve growth factor-differentiated cells, and third, constructs containing the promoter region of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene are transcribed much less readily in nerve growth factor-differentiated cells than in untreated cells. The decreases in mRNA are not seen in the p140trk-deficient variant PC12nnr5 cells nor in cells containing either dominant-negative Ras or dominant-negative Src. Treatment with nerve growth factor also increases the cellular content of GCF2, a putative transcription factor inhibitory for the transcription of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene. The increase in GCF2, like the decrease in the epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA, is not seen in PC12nnr5 cells nor in cells expressing either dominant-negative Ras or dominant-negative Src. The results suggest that nerve growth factor-induced down-regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor is under transcriptional control, is p140trk-, Ras-, and Src-dependent, and may involve transcriptional repression by GCF2. Treatment of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor leads to a decrease in the number of epidermal growth factor receptors on the cell membrane. The mRNA for the epidermal growth factor receptor decreases in a comparable fashion. This decrease appears due to a decrease in the transcription of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene because first, there is no difference in the stability of the epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA, second, newly transcribed epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA is decreased in nerve growth factor-differentiated cells, and third, constructs containing the promoter region of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene are transcribed much less readily in nerve growth factor-differentiated cells than in untreated cells. The decreases in mRNA are not seen in the p140trk-deficient variant PC12nnr5 cells nor in cells containing either dominant-negative Ras or dominant-negative Src. Treatment with nerve growth factor also increases the cellular content of GCF2, a putative transcription factor inhibitory for the transcription of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene. The increase in GCF2, like the decrease in the epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA, is not seen in PC12nnr5 cells nor in cells expressing either dominant-negative Ras or dominant-negative Src. The results suggest that nerve growth factor-induced down-regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor is under transcriptional control, is p140trk-, Ras-, and Src-dependent, and may involve transcriptional repression by GCF2. PC12, a cell line isolated from a rat pheochromocytoma (1Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar, 2Dichter M.A. Tischler A.S. Greene L.A. Nature. 1977; 268: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), has been an extremely informative tool for the study of the mechanism of nerve growth factor (NGF) 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; kb, kilobase(s); RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair. action. Under standard culture conditions, these cells are small round and fluorescent and divide about every 48 h. Upon the addition of NGF, they elaborate neurites, become electrically excitable, stop dividing, and will synapse with appropriate muscle cells in culture (3Schubert D. Heinemann S. Kidokoro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2579-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Overall, the cells change from a chromaffin-like phenotype to one very similar to that of a mature sympathetic neuron. A great deal of attention has been directed toward the mechanism by which NGF instructs the cells to undergo this global change in character. One interesting property of PC12 cells is the appearance of both NGF receptors and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) on their surface (4Huff K. End D. Guroff G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Because NGF inhibits PC12 cell division and epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates PC12 cell division (4Huff K. End D. Guroff G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), this observation has motivated a number of studies on comparative signal transduction in these cells. These experiments have led to the conclusion that the temporal aspects of cellular signaling, as well as the exact nature of the signaling components, are important in determining the eventual changes caused by a ligand on its target cell (5Qui M.S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 6Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Another question posed by this observation had to do with the consequences of treating the cells simultaneously with an agent that stops their growth and one that stimulates it (4Huff K. End D. Guroff G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The result of such dual treatment was that the differentiating agent, NGF, caused a decrease in the receptors for the mitogen, EGF (4Huff K. End D. Guroff G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of this down-regulation was not known, it was suggested that the decrease was, at least in part, the way in which NGF instructed the cells to stop dividing and differentiate, by blinding them to the mitogens that normally control their growth. Recently it has been shown (7Lazarovici P. Oshima M. Shavit D. Shibutani M. Jiang H. Monshipouri M. Fink D. Movsesyan V. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11026-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that the down-regulation of the EGFR by NGF is dependent on the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathway. That is, the down-regulation does not occur in PC12 variants that cannot signal by this pathway. It was also shown that the down-regulation is mediated by the p140trk receptor. Finally, it was demonstrated that although the down-regulation accompanies NGF-induced morphological differentiation in these cells, it occurs whether or not the cells are allowed to differentiate morphologically. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling NGF-induced EGFR down-regulation remained unknown. In the present work, we have shown that the down-regulation has a transcriptional basis. Further, we have demonstrated that this decreased transcription is mediated by the p140trk receptor and the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathway. Finally, we have found that increases in the transcription inhibitor GCF2 (transcriptional repressor of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene) accompany the decrease in the EGFR and that these increases are also mediated by p140trk and the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathway. Mouse NGF and rat type I collagen were purchased from Becton Dickinson (Bedford, MA). Monoclonal antibody against the EGFR (6F1) was obtained from Medical and Biological Laboratories, Co., Ltd. (Nagoya, Japan). LipofectAMINE was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Actinomycin D was a product of Sigma). Stable dominant-negative Src PC12 variant cells (SrcDN2) were the kind gift of Dr. Simon Halegoua, stable dominant-negative Ras PC12 variant cells (M-M17–26) were generously provided by Dr. Geoffrey Cooper, and PC12nnr5 (a pheochromocytoma clone unresponsive to nerve growth factor) cells were graciously contributed by Dr. Lloyd Greene. A DNA fragment of human GCF2 (GenBank™ accession number U69609) corresponding to amino acids 51–705 that had been ligated with BamHI linker was ligated into the BamHI site of pGEX1λT (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The direction was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The human GCF2 glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (GST-GCF2) was purified on a glutathione-Sepharose affinity column from isopropylthiogalactoside-induced E. coliaccording to the manufacturer's protocol. The polyclonal antibody was the protein A-Sepharose-purified IgG fraction from antiserum raised in rabbits against GST-GCF2. PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 100 units of penicillin/ml. For NGF treatment, 100 ng of NGF/ml were added to the culture medium. In all experiments involving extended treatment with NGF, the medium was changed and fresh NGF was added every other day. PC12nnr5 cells (8Green S.H. Rydel R.E. Connolly J.L. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 830-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum. The PC12 cell variants M-M17–26 expressing the Ha-ras Asn-17 gene under the transcriptional control of the mouse metallothionein-I promoter (9Szeberenyi J. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and the srcDN2 expressing the K295R mutant (kinase-dead) form of chicken Src under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (10Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Halegoua S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1415-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) were grown, as were PC12 cells, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum. In all experiments, cells were cultured on collagen. Collagen coating of culture dishes and flasks was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (5 μg/cm2). For mRNA stability experiments, cells treated for 5 days with NGF were incubated with actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) in Me2SO for 2, 4, or 6 h. Untreated control cultures contained the same concentration of Me2SO. The cells were harvested with 5 mm EDTA/phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and washed twice with saline. To prepare whole cell extracts, 1 × 107washed cells were treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 20 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was solubilized in 100 μl of 2× SDS sample loading buffer and sonicated. The pH of the sonicated lysate was adjusted to neutral by adding 1 m Tris. Protein concentration was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay system. Samples were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking with nonfat dry milk, the blot was incubated with either 6F1 anti-EGFR antibody (0.6 μg/ml) or anti-GFC2 antibody (1:5,000 dilution). Bound antibodies were detected by sheep anti-mouse Ig or donkey anti-rabbit Ig antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.) and analyzed with the Supersignal Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Poly(A+) RNA was isolated from untreated control PC12 cells and NGF-treated PC12 cells using FastTrack (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The RNA was analyzed on 0.8% formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes, and probed with a 32P random-primed 0.85-kb PstI-XbaI fragment of the rat EGFR (nucleotides 463–1311; the kind gift of Dr. H. Shelton Earp), followed by autoradiography. After stripping with a boiled 0.1% SDS solution, the membrane was reprobed with a 0.68-kb fragment of rat GAPDH (nucleotides 379–1060). Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from untreated control PC12 cells and NGF-treated PC12 cells by RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test “B”, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Single strand DNA was generated from 1 μg of total RNA with Superscriptase Preamplification System (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR MIMIC for competitive RT-PCR was made utilizing a construction kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH; Palo Alto, CA). The target fragment (nucleotides 154–843) derived from EGFR was amplified using an upstream primer, 5′-ATGCGACCCT CAGGGACTGC GAGAAC-3′, and a downstream primer, 5′-GTCGCTAGGG GACCTGCCAC GACAAC-3′. The size of the PCR products of the EGFR target and the PCR MIMIC was 690 and 538 bp, respectively. The GAPDH sequence (nucleotides 379–1060) was amplified using an upstream primer, 5′-TGGAGAAGGC TGGGGCTCAC CTGAAG-3′, and a downstream primer, 5′-GCCATGTAGG CCATGAGGTC CACCAC-3′, and PCR products of the GAPDH target and the PCR MIMIC were 682 and 488 bp, respectively. Six tubes of 2-fold serial dilutions of PCR MIMIC were prepared for each competitive PCR sample. The cycle parameters for PCR were 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, and the cycle numbers for EGFR and GAPDH were 24 and 20, respectively. The double strand cDNA clones for rat EGFR, rat NGFI-B, and rat GAPDH were used as templates for hybridization. The 1.35-kb NsiI-PstI fragment of the rat EGFR (nucleotides 462–1815) and the 1.46-kb NarI-NheI fragment of rat NGFI-B were each ligated into pBluescript II KS(+) utilizing its PstI site and ClaI-XbaI sites, respectively. The GAPDH fragment, which is identical to the target fragment used for competitive RT-PCR, was also ligated into pBluescript II KS(+). 2 μg of linearized template DNA was immobilized on GeneScreen nylon membrane (NEN Life Science Products) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using a slot blot apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell). Nuclei from untreated PC12 cells or PC12 cells treated with NGF (100 ng/ml) or with actinomycin D (10 μm) were prepared using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) according to standard methodology (11Greenberg M.E. Bender T.P. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 4.10.1-4.10.11Google Scholar). Isolated nuclei were resuspended in glycerol storage buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 40% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA), and samples of 2 × 107 nuclei in 40 μl were flash-frozen in ethanol and dry ice and stored at −70 °C. Nuclear run-off transcription assays were carried out at 24 °C for 20 min by the addition of 70 μl of 2× reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.3 m KCl, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm CTP), 27 μl of [α-32P]UTP (270 μCi, 3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.), and 3 μl of RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (120 units, Promega). The reaction was stopped by DNA digestion at 24 °C with 20 μl of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (20 units, Promega) and 18 μl of 10 mmCaCl2 for 5 min, followed by digestion with proteinase K (1 μl containing 14.4 μg, Boehringer Mannheim) at 42 °C for 30 min, and then the addition of 20 μl of 10× SDS/Tris buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5% SDS, 50 mm EDTA) and 10 μl containing 100 μg of yeast tRNA at 37 °C for 30 min. The labeled nascent RNAs were isolated by RNA STAT-60 and ProbeQuant™ G-50 Micro Columns (Pharmacia) and were partially hydrolyzed by incubation with 0.1 n NaOH on ice for 10 min. The mixture was neutralized with Tris-HCl and precipitated with ethanol. The labeled RNA was resuspended in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS and denatured at 95 °C for 10 min before hybridization. Labeled RNA (6 × 106cpm) was hybridized to the immobilized template DNAs at 52 °C in hybridization solution (6× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 50 μg/ml yeast tRNA, pH 7.6) for 60 h. Because the total radioactivity in the labeled RNAs from actinomycin D-treated PC12 cells was only 125th of that from the other cells, all the labeled RNA was used for hybridization. The filters were washed for 20 min once in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C, twice in 2× SSC, twice in 2× SSC containing RNase A (0.25 μg/ml) at room temperature, once in 0.2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 60 °C, and once in 0.2× SCC containing 1.0% SDS at 60 °C. Filters were processed for PhosphorImager analysis using STORM860 (Molecular Dynamics) and analyzed by autoradiography. The plasmids pER6-luc, pER9-luc, and pER10-luc (12Johnson A.C. Ishii S. Jinno Y. Pastan I. Merlino G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5693-5699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained by inserting the promoter regions from pERCAT6, pERCAT9, and pERCAT10 into the HindIII site of the pGL3-basic plasmid (Promega). PC12 cells cultured in collagen-coated 6-well plates (Nunc, Naperville, IL) were transfected using LipofectAMINE with 1 μg of pER-luc plasmid and 0.1 μg of the internal control pRL-TK (Promega), which contains Renillaluciferase downstream of the Herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter. After NGF treatment (100 ng/ml) for various periods of time, cells were transfected for 1 h. 9 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega), and both firefly and Renilla luciferase activity were measured in an LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). The transfection efficiency was normalized by the Renillaluciferase activity. The data are expressed as the means ± S.D. In some experiments, RNA template-specific PCR of the luciferase gene from PC12 cells transfected with pER6-luc was used (13Shuldiner A.R. Perfetti R. Roth J. Current Methods and Applications. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1993: 169-176Google Scholar). Total cytoplasmic RNA from transfected cells was reverse transcribed using a chimeric primer (5′-CCGCGCGGCC GCTCTAGAAC TAGTGGCGCG GTTGTTACTT GACTGGCG-3′), where its 3′-region is complementary to a region of the target luc gene (nucleotides 1614–1593 of pGL3-Basic) and its 5′-region is a tagged sequence. PCR was performed with the sequence-specific first strand cDNA as a template, an upstream primer, 5′-ACCTGCAGCT TCTGGTGGCG CTCCCCTC-3′ (nucleotides 1024–1046 of pGL3-Basic), and the tagged primer, 5′-GCGCGGCCGC TCTAGAACTA GTGGC-3′. The level of EGFR during NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells was examined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1). A reduction in the level of the EGFR protein in whole cells became apparent after 1 day of NGF treatment, and this reduction was gradual and progressive. A 67% decrease was seen after 5 days of treatment. This reduction was consistent with the reduction in [125I]EGF binding during NGF-induced differentiation observed in previous reports from this laboratory (7Lazarovici P. Oshima M. Shavit D. Shibutani M. Jiang H. Monshipouri M. Fink D. Movsesyan V. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11026-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows the levels of EGFR mRNA during NGF-induced differentiation determined both by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2 A) and by competitive RT-PCR (Fig. 2, B and C). The time points are the same as those in Fig. 1. Both methods show a progressive reduction in EGFR mRNA levels during NGF treatment. Three species, one major (9.6 kb) and two minor (6.5 and 5.0 kb), of EGFR mRNA have been reported (14Petch L.A. Harris J. Raymond V.W. Blasband A. Lee D.C. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2973-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), along with a 2.7-kb species considered to be a truncated variant, the protein product of which lacks both transmembrane and intracellular domains. Northern blot data show that all three species decrease in the course of NGF treatment, and this decrease precedes the reduction in the protein. Competitive RT-PCR, a quantitative procedure for analyzing mRNA levels that is also more sensitive than RNA blot techniques, such as Northern blotting, which provide only semi-quantitative results (15Souaze F. Ntodou-Thom A. Tran C.Y. Rostene W. Forgez P. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), shows a very similar decrease in EGFR mRNA. Fig.2 B depicts the actual PCR products visualized on gels obtained from untreated control cells and from cells treated for 5 days with NGF. The arrows in Fig. 2 B indicate the cross-over points as determined visually. Even by visual estimation, a shift in the cross-over point could be clearly seen. The relative level of EGFR mRNA at each time point was estimated by the quantitation of ethidium bromide-stained gel bands (Fig. 2 C). The region selected as a target fragment for PCR amplification was almost identical to the sequence of the EGFR DNA fragment used as a probe for Northern blot analysis. The decrease in EGFR mRNA measured by competitive RT-PCR began after 6 h of NGF treatment (Fig.2 C), and an 85% reduction was seen after 5 days of NGF treatment, a result very similar to that obtained by Northern blot analysis. The reduction became statistically significant after 1 day of treatment. GAPDH mRNA, the internal control, was constant during NGF treatment. The decay of EGFR mRNA in untreated control cells and in cells treated for 5 days with NGF was measured in the presence of actinomycin D by competitive RT-PCR (Fig.3). The decay of EGFR mRNA was faster than that of GAPDH mRNA. Neither EGFR mRNA nor GAPDH mRNA showed any significant changes in their decay due to NGF treatment. The same result was obtained by Northern blot analysis of samples from cells treated for 3 or 5 days with NGF (data not shown). The nascent transcript levels of EGFR were measured in untreated control cells and in cells treated with NGF for 45 min or 5 days (Fig.4). Two different experiments were performed, and the data obtained from these two experiments were almost identical. The transcription of EGFR was decreased by 55% in PC12 cells treated with NGF for 5 days. By way of control, a 2-fold increase in NGFI-B transcription was observed after 45 min of NGF treatment. NGF treatment had no effect on the transcription of the housekeeping gene, GAPDH, and there were no transcripts from any of these genes in cells treated with actinomycin D. To study the EGFR promoter activity and to confirm the decrease in the transcriptional activity in NGF-treated cells, three luciferase gene plasmids with different lengths of promoter were used for reporter gene assay of PC12 cells. Compared with the promoter activities from the longer promoter plasmids (pER6-luc and pER9-luc), the activity of the shortest promoter plasmid (pER10-luc) was very low (Fig.5 A). After NGF treatment, the normalized EGFR promoter activity of pER6-luc and pER9-luc transfectants was almost completely repressed (Fig. 5 B). The decrease in the promoter activity of pER10-luc was not as strongly inhibited. To evaluate the time course of the reduction in the promoter activity, PC12 cells were treated with NGF for different periods of time before transfection. Even 12 h after NGF treatment, a significant reduction in promoter activity was observed, and this activity decreased with time (Fig. 5 C). The slow but progressive decrease in the promoter activity was consistent with the changes in EGFR mRNA seen during NGF treatment (Fig. 2). TableI shows the effect of introducing different amounts of promoter plasmid DNA into the cells on the extent of NGF-induced down-regulation of EGFR promoter activity. Untreated PC12 cells and cells treated with NGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 days were transfected with either 1 μg or 0.1 μg of pER9-luc EGFR promoter DNA, and luciferase assays were performed. The down-regulation of EGFR promoter activity was seen for up to 15 h after transfection with 1 μg of DNA but disappeared after 24 h. On the other hand, transfection with 0.1 μg of DNA showed the down-regulation even 24 h after the transfection.Table IEffect of the amount of transfected promoter DNA on the NGF-induced down-regulation of EGFR promoter activityTime after transfectionRelative promoter activity1 μg of promoter DNA0.1 μg of promoter DNAh 913.8 ± 2.723.0 ± 13.61543.7 ± 5.926.0 ± 13.524106.0 ± 11.567.7 ± 14.61-ap < 0.05.1-a p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Because the NGF-induced decrease in luciferase activity could occur at either the transcriptional or the translational level, the levels of luciferase mRNA were measured by RNA template-specific PCR. Fig. 6 Ashows an experiment validating the PCR measurement. With the combination of the upstream and tagging primers, sequences derived from luciferase mRNA that had been tagged with unique sequence during reverse transcription are amplified preferentially, whereas contaminating DNA derived from the transfected plasmid that lacks the unique tag is not amplified. Lane 1 of Fig. 6 Ashows the result of PCR reaction of pGL3-Basic as a template with the combination of the upstream primer and the tagging primer. Lane 2 of Fig. 6 A shows the product (597 bp) amplified by the PCR reaction of pGL3-Basic as a template with the combination of the upstream primer and the downstream chimeric primer. Lane 3 of Fig. 6 A shows the product (622 bp) amplified by the reaction of single strand DNA derived from pER6 transfectant as a template with the combination of the upstream primer and tagging primer. From these results, PCR with the combination of upstream primer and tagging primer selectively amplifies luciferase mRNA. Fig.6 B shows the RNA template-specific PCR products from the pER6-luc transfected PC12 cells after 5 days of culture in the presence or the absence of NGF. Compared with untreated control cells (Fig.6 B, lane 1), NGF-treated cells showed much lower amplification of the PCR product (Fig. 6 B, lane 2), demonstrating that the regulation of the expression of this plasmid is at the transcriptional level. PC12nnr5 cells are a variant of PC12 cells that express little or no p140trk, the high affinity site for NGF (8Green S.H. Rydel R.E. Connolly J.L. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 830-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). 5 days of NGF treatment did not induce the down-regulation of EGFR in these cells (Fig. 7 A), nor did it change the level of receptor mRNA (Fig. 7 B). PC12nnr5 cells also did not show a significant reduction in EGFR promoter activity after 5-day treatment with NGF (Fig. 7 C). GCF2 is a recently identified transcriptional repressor of the EGFR gene, 2A. L. Reed, H. Yamazaki, J. Kaufman, Y. Rubinstein, and A. C. Johnson, submitted for publication. which migrates as a 160-kDa protein on polyacrylamide gels. To examine the expression level of this protein in PC12 cells during NGF treatment, Western blot analysis was performed. As shown in Fig.8, GST fusion protein expressed in a bacterial system was recognized by an antibody raised against GCF2. In PC12 cells, a 160-kDa major protein band and a minor protein band at about 150 kDa were detected. The level of these proteins was clearly increased by NGF treatment in a time-dependent manner. NGF-induced changes in EGFR levels in PC12 cells are dependent upon both Ras and Src (7Lazarovici P. Oshima M. Shavit D. Shibutani M. Jiang H. Monshipouri M. Fink D. Movsesyan V. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11026-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To begin to explore the relationship between the increase in GCF2 and the decrease in the EGFR, the NGF-induced increase in GCF2 was inspected for its dependency on Ras or Src. Two PC12 cell variants, one stably overexpressing the dominant-negative mutant RasN17 (M-M17–26), the other stably overexpressing a kinase-inactive, dominant-negative Src (SrcDN2) were treated with NGF for 5 days, and Western blot analyses of GCF2 and EGFR were performed. Fig. 9 shows the data from these variants and from PC12nnr5 cells as well. Unlike in the wild-type, there was neither an up-regulation of GCF2 levels nor a decrease in EGFR levels in these variant cell lines upon NGF treatment. It is interesting to note the very high basal levels of GCF2 in the Src dominant-negative cells and the absence of the 160-kDa GCF2 band in PC12nnr5 cells, even after NGF treatment. The observation that both mitogenic and anti-mitogenic receptors occur on the same cell and the further finding that the presence of the ligand for the anti-mitogenic receptor, NGF, cause a profound decrease in the levels of the receptor for the mitogen, EGF, permitted the suggestion that this down-regulation could be one way in which NGF instructs its target cells to stop dividing and differentiate (4Huff K. End D. Guroff G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which this down-regulation occurs has not been described. There have been two studies (17Brown A.B. Carpenter G. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 18Mothe I. Ballotti R. Tartare S. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) dealing with rather short term NGF-induced changes in EGFR levels on PC12 cells, but these clearly deal with a different phenomenon than the one described here. The evidence that this regulation is exerted at the transcriptional level seems quite persuasive. There is a decrease in EGFR mRNA levels comparable with the decrease seen in the receptor itself. This decrease is clearly not caused by any difference in mRNA stability. Direct proof was obtained by nuclear run-off assay in which about 55% reduction of the nascent mRNA for the EGFR was observed as a result of long term treatment of the cells with NGF. Furthermore, evidence to support the transcriptional regulation was provided by transfecting EGFR promoter constructs linked to luciferase into untreated control and NGF-treated cells. The decreased luciferase activity in the treated cells, together with the direct measurement of luciferase mRNA to confirm that the decrease was at the transcriptional level, provides conclusive proof of the transcriptional regulation of this expression. It should be noted that this decrease in expression was evident only for short times after the transfection. By 24 h after transfection there was no difference between the NGF-treated cells and the controls. That this was not due to differences in transfection speed or efficiency was clear from the Renilla controls, which were expressed equally at every time point in untreated control and NGF-treated cells. A possible explanation for these data is that the large amounts of EGFR promoter region that are produced in the cells simply exhaust the inhibitory transcription factors available; such depletion has been suggested by observations with the transfected chromogranin A promoter in PC12 cells (19Tang K. Wu H. Mahata S.K. Taupenot L. Rozansky D.J. Parmer R.J. O'Connor D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28382-28390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), in which the high dose of the transfected promoter DNA may saturate and deplete the trans-acting factor. Data consistent with such a possibility are presented in TableI in which transfection with a low dose of EGFR promoter DNA resulted in down-regulation even 24 h after transfection. The regulation of EGFR expression is complex, involving at least five stimulatory transcription factors, Sp1 (20Kageyama R. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. J. Biol.

NGF has been shown to induce a subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (30Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5936-5942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and the gene for the light neurofilament protein (31Reeben M. Neuman T. Palgi J. Palm K. Paalme V. Saarma M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), at least in part, through an Sp1 site and the apoptotic death of PC12 cells after NGF withdrawal appears to lower Sp1 levels (32Wang S. Pittman R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10385-10389Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). NGF also appears to interact with p53 in that PC12 cells overexpressing p140trk show an association between the receptor and p53, and p53 can induce an NGF-like response in these cells in the absence of NGF (33Montano X. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Further, 3T3 cells show a Raf-dependent phosphorylation of p53 and a potentiation of the transactivation potential of p53 (16Jamal S. Ziff E.B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2095-2101PubMed Google Scholar), and Raf is part of the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathway activated by NGF. But this is the first report of an NGF-induced alteration in one of the inhibitory factors. GCF2 was identified by differential hybridization and library screening2 using a cDNA for GCF1 (27Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Contransfection assays show that GCF2 acts to repress transcription from the EGFR promoter as well as from those for SV40 and Rous sarcoma virus. Gel shift assays using His-tagged GCF2 protein have revealed two binding sites in the human EGFR promoter: one is a strong binding site (−384 to −164 relative to the AUG translation initiation codon) and the other is a weaker binding site (−154 to −15).2 Both pER6-luc and pER9-luc constructs have the promoter region that includes both binding sites, but pER10-luc contains only the weak binding site. These observations could explain the much weaker effect of NGF treatment on the transcription of pER10-luc. Clearly, the data presented here do not prove that GCF2 is involved in the decreased expression of the EGFR in NGF-treated PC12 cells, but the coincidence of the increased expression of GCF2 with the decreased expression of the EGFR and the fact that both events are dependent on p140trk, Ras, and Src are consistent with that possibility. Further experiments testing that possibility are underway. In any case, the decreased expression of the EGFR in PC12 cells caused by NGF differentiation is clearly transcriptional in nature. The increasing number of factors that appear to control that transcription indicate that the regulation is quite complex. But because the expression of EGFR and its homologs, the ErbB family, appear to be involved in the control of the growth of a number of tumors, the details of the control of that expression would seem to be worth pursuing."
https://openalex.org/W2006715676,"Stage-specific activator protein (SSAP) is the transcription factor responsible for the activation of the sea urchin late H1 gene at the mid-blastula stage of embryogenesis. SSAP contains an extremely potent transcription activation domain that functions 4–5-fold better than VP16 in a variety of mammalian cell lines. We used the two-hybrid screening technique to identify human cDNAs from an HL60 cell-derived cDNA library that encode proteins that interact with the transcription activation domain of SSAP. One of these cDNAs encodes ZFM1, a protein previously identified at the locus linked to multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) and as presplicing factor SF1. Functional assays establish the ZFM1 protein as a transcriptional repressor. ZFM1 protein represses Gal4-GQC-mediated transcription, and this activity requires both a repression domain found in the N-terminal 137 amino acids of the protein, as well as a GQC interaction region. The physiological significance of repression mediated by ZFM1 comes from the ability of its specific repression domain to function when fused to Gal4 and tethered to promoters containing Gal4 binding sites. The activity is unique in that activated but not basal transcription levels are affected.

The activity is unique in that activated but not basal transcription levels are affected. Different families of histone genes in sea urchins are expressed with distinct temporal patterns during early embryogenesis, making this system ideal for studying mechanisms of temporal gene expression. In recent years, much progress has been made in studying the expression of late H1 histone subtype genes (1Lai Z.C. DeAngelo D.J. DiLiberto M. Childs G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2315-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 2DeAngelo D.J. DeFalco J. Childs G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1746-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3DeAngelo D.J. DeFalco J. Rybacki L. Childs G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1254-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4DeFalco J. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The late H1-β gene is transcribed at low levels until it is transcriptionally activated at the mid-blastula stage, and reaches its peak level of expression in 24-h late-blastula stage embryos. The correct temporal activation of late H1 gene expression is determined by an enhancer element located 220–280 base pairs upstream in its promoter region (1Lai Z.C. DeAngelo D.J. DiLiberto M. Childs G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2315-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Stage-specific activator protein (SSAP) 1The abbreviations used are: SSAP, stage-specific activator protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; 3-AT, 3-aminotriazole; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TK, thymidine kinase; TBP, TATA-binding protein; TF, transcription factor; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein. is a 43-kDa polypeptide that can specifically bind to this enhancer (2DeAngelo D.J. DeFalco J. Childs G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1746-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Early in development, SSAP is present as a monomer; however, it undergoes a posttranslational modification at about 12 h after fertilization, and dimerization coincides with the activation of late H1 gene (2DeAngelo D.J. DeFalco J. Childs G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1746-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic SSAP mRNA injected into zygotes transactivates reporter genes containing SSAP binding sites (3DeAngelo D.J. DeFalco J. Rybacki L. Childs G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1254-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly, this transactivation also occurs in a temporal-specific manner. The DNA binding activity of SSAP maps to its N-terminal 180 amino acids (3DeAngelo D.J. DeFalco J. Rybacki L. Childs G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1254-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This domain contains two RNA recognition motifs, which recognize both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA in a sequence-specific manner (3DeAngelo D.J. DeFalco J. Rybacki L. Childs G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1254-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to this novel DNA binding domain, SSAP contains an extremely potent transcription activation domain consisting of amino acids 181–404 (4DeFalco J. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This activation domain consists of a central glycine/glutamine-rich sequence and a C-terminal region rich in serine/threonine and basic amino acids (referred to as the GQC domain). In a variety of mammalian cell lines, Gal4-GQC fusion protein can transactivate the expression of Gal4-responsive reporter genes as much as 4–5-fold better than Gal4-VP16 (4DeFalco J. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This activity requires the presence of both the central G/Q-rich domain as well as the C-terminal domain. The GQ region alone cannot activate transcription, whereas the C-terminal region has minimal activity (4DeFalco J. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The activation domain of a transcription factor may promote transcription at several different steps during the formation of a preinitiation complex by recruiting basal transcription factors or during promoter clearance and elongation (5Choy B. Green M.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 6Narayan S. Widen S.G. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12755-12763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Yankulov K. Blau J. Purton T. Roberts S. Bentley D.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 749-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To do this, the activators must interact with multiple targets in the transcriptional apparatus. These targets include not only basal factors in the transcription machinery, but also various co-activators or adaptors, which facilitate interactions between activator and basal transcription factors or RNA polymerase II (8Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 9Triezenberg S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In vitrobinding assays have shown that the GQC domain can physically interact with several basal transcription factors of RNA polymerase II, including TBP, TFIIB, TFIIF74, and dTAFII110 (4DeFalco J. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the GQC domain has self-squelching activity and the ability to squelch VP16- and E1A-driven reporter genes. This suggests that the activation domains of SSAP, VP16, and E1a share some common targets necessary for maximal transcription. It is believed that these targets may not be basal transcription factors, instead, they may be specific adaptors or coactivator proteins (4DeFalco J. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although the ability of the activation domain of SSAP to drive such high levels of transcription may be explained by stronger association with common targets, it is also possible that it may interact with unique protein targets not shared by VP16 or E1a. It has been well documented that different classes of activation domains may interact with distinct coactivators or adaptors to stimulate transcription (8Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). For example, the glutamine-rich activation domain of SP1 binds specifically to TAFII110 (10Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O. Gill G. Chen J.L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 11Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), whereas the acidic activation domain of VP16 cannot stimulate transcription without interaction with TAFII40 (12Goodrich J.A. Hoey T. Thut C.J. Admon A. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 75: 519-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Similarly, a group of transcription factors require p300/CBP coactivator family members for maximal activity, whereas other transcription factors act independently of this regulatory network (13Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 14Janknecht R. Hunter T. Curr.

Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2407) Google Scholar). In this paper, a two-hybrid screening technique is employed to identify human protein(s) that can interact with the activation domain of SSAP. The rationale for this screen comes from the extremely potent activation domain used as a “bait” in this study. We believed that the GQC activation domain would interact with interesting transcriptional mediators. This paper describes the properties of one SSAP-interacting protein, ZFM1. ZFM1 was previously cloned as a nuclear protein at a locus linked to multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (16Toda T. Iida A. Miwa T. Nakamura Y. Imai T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It was also identified as a presplicing factor SF1 (17Arning S. Gruter P. Bilbe G. Kramer A. RNA. 1996; 2: 794-810PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we show that ZFM1 functions as a transcription repressor. To generate pBTM116-GQC as bait for two-hybrid screening, an EcoRI fragment derived from pSG424-GQC (4DeFalco J. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which contains the entire GQC domain (amino acids 181–404), was ligated into pBTM116 vector cut with EcoRI. The resulting construct was sequenced to verify that the GQC domain was cloned in the correct orientation and in frame with the LexA DNA binding domain. To create pGAD424-ZFM1-E for yeast two-hybrid assays, two primers (5′-GGG GTC GAC CAG ACC ACA TGG CGA CCG GAG CGA AC-3′) and (5′-CCC GTC GAC TCA CTT GTC ATC GTC GTC CTT GTA GTC CCA ATG GGC GCG GAA AGT-3′) were used in a PCR reaction to amplify ZFM1-E from pBluescript SK phagemid DNA. This PCR product was cut by SalI and ligated into the SalI site of pGAD424 to fuse ZFM1-E in frame with the Gal4 activation domain. To generate pCR3.1-ZFM1-A expression construct for functional assays, two PCR fragments that correspond to N-terminal (between nucleotide 383–1607) and C-terminal (between nucleotide 836 and 2251) regions of ZFM1-A, respectively, were created. The N-terminal piece was amplified using template ZFM1-E in pBluescript SK and two primers (5′-GGG GTC GAC CCG CCA CCA TGG CGA CCG GAG CGA AC-3′ and 5′-CAT GCC CAC CTG TCA GGC-3′), and the C-terminal piece was amplified using template CE9 and two primers (5′-TTT GTG GGG CTG CTC ATC-3′ and 5′-GTC GAC TCA CTT GTC ATC GTC GTC CTT GTA GTC TGG CTC GGG CCA TCG C-3′). A unique EcoRI site at nucleotide position 1489 of ZFM1-A was utilized to join these fragments in the correct reading frame. The two non-overlapping portions were joined together and ligated to pCR3.1 vector (Invitrogen) in a three-piece ligation reaction. In the resulting plasmid, pCR3.1-ZFM1-A, the expression of full-length ZFM1-A in mammalian cells is under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter, and there is a FLAG-tag in frame with the C-terminal amino acid of ZFM1-A. To make pGAD424-ZFM1-A and pSG424-ZFM1-A, ZFM1-A fragment was released from pCR3.1-ZFM1-A by SalI digestion and then cloned into the SalI site of pGAD424 and pSG424, respectively. To create pCR3.1-ZFM1-(1–320), this region of ZFM1-A was amplified by PCR using two primers (5′-GGG GTC GAC CCG CCA CCA TGG CGA CCG GAG CGA AC-3′ and 5′-GAC GCG TCG ACT CAC TTG TCA TCG TCG TCC TTG TAG TCC AGT TCA GCC ATG AGG GA-3′). This PCR fragment is cloned in pCR3.1 and the expression of ZFM1-(1–320) with a C-terminal FLAG-tag is under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter in the resulting plasmid. pGAD424-ZFM1-(1–320) and pSG424-ZFM1-(1–320) were created in a manner similar to that for ZFM1-A on these vectors by utilizing the same SalI site. To clone pGEX-KG-ZFM1-(321–478) for bacterial expression of GST fusion protein, ZFM1-(321–478) was amplified from template pCR3.1-ZFM1-A using primer 5′-GCG GGA TCC GTC TAG AGG GTG AAG CAC CTG TC-3′ and primer 5′-GCG GGA TCC AAG CTT ACA TCA TGC CCA TAG GTG-3′. The resulting DNA fragment was digested with XbaI and HindIII and ligated into XbaI/HindIII-digested pGEX-KG. To generate various deletion constructs of ZFM1 for repression domain mapping, PCR product corresponding to defined region of ZFM1 was amplified using pCR3.1-ZFM1-A DNA as template and two primers, which span this region and contain appropriate cloning sites at the ends. Resulting PCR fragments were digested and ligated into pSG424 to make fusion proteins with Gal4-(1–147). The regions of ZFM1 contained in each of these constructs are designated by the amino acids given in parentheses. The HL60 library, a generous gift from Dr. G. Kalpana, was divided into six different pools with a total of 1.12 × 106 individual clones (18Luban J. Bossolt K.L. Franke E.K. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). To screen this library, pBTM116-GQC plasmid was first transformed into the yeast L40 strain (19Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Then the DNA from either an individual library pool or combinations of several pools was transformed using the lithium-acetate method (20Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar, 21Hill J. Donald K.A. Griffiths D.E. Donald K.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), followed by 16 h of incubation in selective medium lacking Ura, Trp, and Leu at 30 °C to allow the expression of the HIS3 reporter gene. A fraction of the transformants were then plated on selective medium lacking Ura, Trp, Leu, Lys, and His but with 50 mm 3-aminotriazole (3-AT). A total of 2.85 × 107 transformants were screened from these six pools of HL60 library in three sets of experiments. After the plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days, 38 His+ colonies were chosen for further study. All of them quickly turned dark blue when they were tested for β-galactosidase activity using a filter assay (22Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was recovered from most of these His+lacZ+ colonies and electrotransformed into Escherichia coli XL1 blue for propogation. The false positives were then eliminated using genetic tests, in which each positive plasmid is retransformed into L40 either alone, with pBTM116, with pBTM116-GQC, with pBTM116-Lamin or with another irrelevant bait. A plasmid was considered as true positive if it could activate the expression of LacZ reporter in L40 only when it was cotransformed with pBTM116-GQC but not in other combinations. Of the 38 His+lacZ+ colonies, 18 were true positives. The cDNA inserts from most of these plasmids were sequenced and used in GenBank™ BLAST searches. ZFM1-(321–484) fragment was amplified from its parental yeast clone by PCR and labeled as a probe by random primer labeling (Amersham Life Science). This probe was used to screen a λ-ZAP HeLa cell cDNA library. The phage from positive clones were then converted to pBluescript SK phagemid by in vivo excision. The cDNA inserts on the phagemid were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequenced. All GST fusion proteins, GST-ZFM1-(321–478), GST-GQC, and GST alone were expressed in E. coli BL(21) by inducing with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions and Ref. 4DeFalco J. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar. In vitro translated GQC domain and ZFM1-E were synthesized using a coupled transcription-translation system (TNT lysate, Promega). GST pull-down experiments were conducted according to Defalco and Childs (4DeFalco J. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells are maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were transfected using Lipofectin method as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). In a typical transfection experiment, DNA mixtures contain 2 μg of CAT reporter plasmid and 1–2 μg of pGK-β-gal control plasmid. pCL-neo (Promega) is used as carrier to make sure that each transfection mixture contained the same amount of total DNA. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed by the freeze-thaw method (4DeFalco J. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiencies were normalized among all the samples according to β-galactosidase activity expressed from control plasmid. Normalized extracts were used in CAT assays (23La Teana A. Brandi A. Falconi M. Spurio R. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10907-10911Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The expression of CAT activity in a given sample was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Each transfection for a given experiment was repeated at least three times. To check the expression of transfected ZFM1 in HepG2 cells, normalized extract from freeze-thaw transfected cells used for CAT assays were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. The expression of transfected ZFM1 protein was detected using M2 antibody, which recognizes the FLAG-tag on its C terminus. To identify protein(s) that interact with the GQC activation domain, we employed a modified version of the yeast two-hybrid system. The GQC transcription activation domain of SSAP from amino acids 181 to 404 (4DeFalco J. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was fused in frame with the LexA DNA binding domain in pBTM116, and the resulting fusion protein was used as bait. When LexA-GQC was transformed into the yeast L40 strain, the resulting transformants can grow on plates lacking histidine. β-Galactosidase filter assays yield light blue colonies due to the GQC-mediated activation of His3 and LacZ reporters containing upstream LexA-binding sites. Therefore, this bait alone can function as a weak transcriptional activator in yeast (TableI). The GQC domain functions as an extremely potent activation domain in mammalian cells (4DeFalco J. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and in sea urchins (3DeAngelo D.J. DeFalco J. Rybacki L. Childs G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1254-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it was questionable if it would function in yeast due to its amino acid content. Yeast do not support “standard” glutamine-rich activators (24Ponticelli A.S. Pardee T.S. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and most yeast activation domains are acidic (25Struhl K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 651-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The GQC activation domain has a region rich in glycine and glutamine (GQ) and a C-terminal region (C) rich in serine, threonine, and basic amino acids (4DeFalco J. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We also made two constructs that individually express LexA fusions to either the GQ or the C regions. As expected from the result in mammalian cells, neither LexA-GQ nor LexA-C can produce β-Galactosidase activity by driving LacZ gene expression in yeast. For this reason, we decided to use the intact activation domain as bait and to inhibit growth of the parent strain used for our screen by addition of the competitive inhibitor of the histidine synthetase 3-AT to the medium. The background growth of LexA-GQC transformants can be eliminated by adding as little as 5 mm 3-AT in the medium. Therefore, we modified the original two-hybrid selection technique by screening library on plates containing 50 or 100 mm of 3-AT to suppress growth of cells not containing true interacting proteins.Table IQuantitation of ZFM1-GQC interactions in the yeast two-hybrid systemLexA-DB fusionGal4-AC fusionβ-Galactosidase activityunitsLexA-GQCAC-ZFM1-(321–484)301 ± 85LexA-GQCAC-ZFM1-A324 ± 124LexA-GQCAC-ZFM1-E185 ± 78LexA-GQCAC-ZFM1-(1–320)46 ± 24LexA-GQC40 ± 8LexA-GQCAC31 ± 10LexAAC-ZFM1-(321–484)2.2 ± 0.7LexAAC-ZFM1-A4.9 ± 1.8LexAAC-ZFM1-E3.7 ± 0.9LexAAC-ZFM1-(1–320)12 ± 1.7 Open table in a new tab A human cDNA library derived from an undifferentiated leukemia cell line (HL60) was screened using this LexA-GQC bait. From 2.85 × 107 yeast transformants, 38 colonies grew on His− plates with 50 mm 3-AT. These colonies quickly turn dark blue using the β-galactosidase filter assay. Twenty of the 38 turned out to be false positives in genetic tests. The remaining 18 are true positives because their ability to activate LacZ and HIS3 genes depends solely on the presence of LexA-GQC. We also tested the interaction between these 18 fusion proteins and GAL4-GQC fusion protein in a different yeast strain, HF7c, which possesses a upstream activating sequence with Gal4 binding sites upstream of the LacZ gene. All 18 positives still interact with the GQC bait but not with plasmids encoding either Gal4 DNA binding domain alone or irrelevant Gal4 fusion proteins. Each fusion protein was also tested for interaction with LexA-GQ and LexA-C alone. There is detectable but weak interaction between the positives with the C domain, but none of them interacts with the GQ domain alone (data not shown). The plasmids from most of these positives were successfully isolated and sequenced. Nine of the 18 positives have identical inserts that encode a fragment corresponding to part of the ZFM1-A protein (GenBank™ accession no. D26120) (16Toda T. Iida A. Miwa T. Nakamura Y. Imai T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), between amino acids 321 and 484 (ZFM1-(321–484)), which is the subject of this paper. ZFM1 was first described by Toda et al. (16Toda T. Iida A. Miwa T. Nakamura Y. Imai T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) as a nuclear protein at the locus tightly linked to a putative tumor suppressor gene for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. ZFM1 was subsequently isolated by Kramer and colleagues (17Arning S. Gruter P. Bilbe G. Kramer A. RNA. 1996; 2: 794-810PubMed Google Scholar) as splicing factor SF1 potentially functioning in pre-spliceosome assembly. Both groups reported that there are multiple splicing variants of ZFM1 in different tissues or cell types. At the same time, we tried to obtain cDNAs of ZFM1 for functional studies by screening a HeLa cell cDNA library using ZFM1-(321–484) as a probe. A number of overlapping cDNA clones were isolated. Interestingly, we isolated a new splicing variant not reported previously. This ZFM1 variant, designated as ZFM1-E, lacks 434 nucleotides between nucleotide position 1785 and 2218 of ZFM1-A and contains an open reading frame that differs from other reported ZFM1 isoforms by deleting part of the proline-rich domain but retaining the same C-terminal tail as ZFM1-B (Fig. 1). The exon-intron junction sites at positions of both 1785 and 2218 show a good match to the consensus splice site sequence. We constructed a clone encoding the full-length ZFM1-A variant by joining an N-terminal fragment amplified from ZFM1-E and a C-terminal fragment amplified from CE9 (Fig. 1). Like ZFM1-(321–484), both ZFM1-E and ZFM1-A can interact with the GQC domain in a yeast two-hybrid assay (Table I). We used GST pull-down assays to confirm the direct association of ZFM1 and GQC. ZFM1-(321–478), which covers most of the region of ZFM1-A that binds to GQC in yeast was fused in frame with glutathione S-transferase to express the GST-ZFM1-(321–478) chimeric protein in bacteria. Radiolabeled in vitro translated GQC was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads coupled with either GST-ZFM1-(321–478) or GST alone. After extensive washing, proteins retained on the beads are eluted and separated by SDS-PAGE. The GQC domain specifically associated with GST-ZFM1-(321–478) but not with GST alone (Fig. 2 A). In parallel, we did the reverse experiment. In vitro translated radiolabeled ZFM1-E was incubated with GST-GQC protein. As in the previous experiment, ZFM1-E can bind to GST-GQC but not to GST alone (Fig. 2 B). The GQC domain can function as a potent transcriptional activation domain in a variety of mammalian cell lines (4DeFalco J. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To assess the consequences of an interaction between GQC and ZFM1, we asked whether overexpression of ZFM1 can modulate the transcriptional activity of the GQC domain. When pCR3.1-ZFM1-A is transfected into HepG2 cells, we detected a 70–80-kDa protein band that corresponds to the size predicted as ZFM1-A in Western blots using M2 antibody. Moreover, the level of expression of tagged ZFM1-A correlates well with the amount of DNA transfected (Fig.3 C). The open reading frame of ZFM1 contains a potential nuclear localization signal near its N terminus (16Toda T. Iida A. Miwa T. Nakamura Y. Imai T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We confirmed the nuclear localization of ZFM1 protein by immunostaining and Western blot analysis of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of HepG2 cell extract (data not shown). When increasing amounts of pCR3.1-ZFM1-A are cotransfected into HepG2 cells along with pSG424-GQC and G5E1BCAT (a CAT reporter with five Gal4 DNA binding sites upstream in its promoter), we observed that the reporter expression is repressed by expression of ZFM1-A in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 A). At the highest levels of ZFM1-A, transcription driven by Gal4-GQC is repressed by 4–5-fold compared with cells containing endogenous levels of ZFM1 variants. In Fig. 3, we used a level of Gal4-GQC that is within the linear range of a titration curve of Gal4-GQC activator (4DeFalco J. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Higher levels of Gal4-GQC exhibit self-squelching, whereas lower levels give linear decreases in activation levels (4DeFalco J. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We observe very similar 4–5-fold repression when different amount of Gal4-GQC (from 10 ng to 5 μg) are cotransfected with increasing amounts of pCR3.1-ZFM1-A (data not shown). The reporter gene used in this experiment, G5E1BCAT, has a minimal TATA-containing promoter. Without GAL4-GQC-activated transcription, we asked if the minimal activity of the reporter alone could be repressed by overexpression of ZFM1-A. The observation that the expression of the reporter alone cannot be repressed similarly indicates that repression of transcription from this reporter requires the presence of the Gal4-GQC protein (Fig. 3 B). The GQC activation domain represents a class of transcriptional activation domain rich in glycine, glutamine, serine, and threonine (4DeFalco J. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5802-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). EWS, which is frequently involved in translocations in Ewing's Sarcoma tumors, also contains a potent transcriptional activation domain with similar amino acid composition (26Crozat A. Aman P. Mandahl N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). We observed that ZFM1-A can also interact directly with this domain of EWS. Similarly, overexpression of ZFM1-A can repress transactivation of reporter genes driven by Gal4-EWS in transient transfection experiments. 2D. Zhang and G. Childs, manuscript in preparation.

Human lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH) 1The abbreviations used are: LPH, lactase-phlorizin hydrolase; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; LPHST, LPH tagged with a VSV epitope tag in its α region; wtLPH, wild type LPH; endo H, endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase H; endo F/GF, endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase F/glycopeptidase F; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is a disaccharidase that is localized at the microvillar membrane of epithelial cells in the small intestine. It is responsible for the hydrolysis of lactose, the main carbohydrate in mammalian milk. LPH is synthesized as a 1927 amino acid precursor, prepro-LPH. The first 19 amino acids of this precursor form the signal sequence that is cleaved off in the endoplasmic reticulum. The remaining 1908 amino acids form the pro-LPH, which is complex glycosylated on its way through the Golgi apparatus. A subsequent cleavage between Arg-734 and Leu-735 (1Wuthrich M. Grunberg J. Hahn D. Jacob R. Radebach I. Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) takes place after export from the trans-Golgi and results in the 160-kDa LPHβ and a stretch that is called the profragment or LPHα (2Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPHβ is expressed at the apical membrane, where it is trimmed by luminal trypsin in the small intestine to the intestinal form of LPHβ. In contrast to LPHβ, the fate of LPHα after cleavage is not clear. In Fig. 1, the processing of LPH is illustrated. Prepro-LPH consists of four homologous regions between the signal peptide and the hydrophobic stretch at the C terminus. In Fig.2, prepro-LPH is schematically drawn. The first two regions, I and II, are localized in LPHα. None of them possess the Glu residue that was shown to be essential for the active sites (3Wacker H. Keller P. Falchetto R. Legler G. Semenza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18744-18752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, LPHα is enzymatically not active toward lactose when expressed separately in COS cells or isolated after trypsin cleavage of the pro-LPH expressed in COS cells (4Naim H.Y. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 255-258PubMed Google Scholar). Regions III and IV both contain the Glu residue and are responsible for the disaccharidase activity of LPHβ (3Wacker H. Keller P. Falchetto R. Legler G. Semenza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18744-18752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the homology between LPHα and LPHβ, and because LPHα comprises 40% of the primary translation product, various functions have been suggested for LPHα (2Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Oberholzer T. Mantei N. Semenza G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). LPHα has previously been isolated from intestinal biopsy samples using an antibody directed against the 12 amino acids directly after the signal peptide (Ser-20-Thr-31) (2Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the immunoprecipitated profragment in these experiments was ∼100 kDa (2Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because none of the used glucosaminidases (endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) and endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase F/glycopeptidase F (endo F/GF)) influenced the apparent molecular weight, it was concluded that the 5 consensus N-glycosylation sites were not glycosylated (2Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although some conflicting data exist (1Wuthrich M. Grunberg J. Hahn D. Jacob R. Radebach I. Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition it was shown that LPHα does not form a stable complex with LPHβ after cleavage in intestinal biopsy specimens (2Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations and further expression studies of the intestinal form of LPHβ (from Ala-869 to the C terminus) in COS-1 cells lead to the hypothesis that LPHα functions as an intramolecular chaperone. Where exactly in the cell the cleavage takes places as well as what happens to LPHα after cleavage is still uncertain despite extensive published data (2Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Oberholzer T. Mantei N. Semenza G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To track down LPHα after cleavage, we decided to express and analyze LPH in Caco-2 cells. These cells are able to express LPH endogenously, and to perform the cleavage between the α and β domain of pro-LPH (6Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we introduced a VSV tag into LPHα to generate additional recognition possibilities. Immunoprecipitation and localization studies were performed in Caco-2 cells that were stably transfected with wild type and VSV-tagged LPH cDNA. The results strongly suggest that the LPHα profragment is immediately degraded after cleavage in Caco-2 cells and therefore argue in favor of the intramolecular chaperone function. HBB1/909 is an epitope-specific monoclonal antibody directed against LPH (6Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). This product of the hybridoma HBB1/909/34/74 was provided by Hans-Peter Hauri, Biozentrum der Universität Basel, Switzerland. V496 is a polyclonal antiserum directed against the first 12 amino acids following the signal sequence of prepro-LPH (2Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P5D4 is a monoclonal antibody against a specific epitope in VSV-G-protein (7Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), the hybridoma was provided by Thomas Kreis, Dept. of Cell Biology, University of Geneva, Switzerland. To insert a VSV epitope tag into the LPH cDNA, the LPH cDNA (8Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into a pBluescript KS+ vector in which the SstI site was removed. This construct was digested with SstI, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and treated with calf intestinal phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim BV, Almere, The Netherlands). For the construction of a 43-base pair VSV-tag insert, coding for 11 amino acids of the epitope, two oligonucleotides (5′-GGAGATCTTATACAGACATAGAGATGAA-3′ and 5′-GGGGGATCCCTTTCCAAGTCGGTTCATCTCTATGTCTGTA-3′) were annealed and treated with Klenow (Boehringer Mannheim BV) in the presence of dNTPs to fill in the 5′ overhangs. The double-stranded product was digested with BamHI and BglII, and the 5′ overhangs were filled in by Klenow treatment. This blunted BamHI/BglII insert was ligated into the blunted SstI-digested LPH cDNA so that the reading frame remained intact. The orientation of the insert was determined by sequencing. Fig. 3 depicts the sequence of the insert and the flanking LPH sequences, as well as the amino acid sequence of the wild type LPH and the tag insert in this region. This construct, denoted LPHST, was cloned into a modified pSG5 (9Green S. Isseman I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) expression vector containing a puromycin resistance cassette (pSGpuro), which resulted in the pLPHST plasmid. Wild type LPH cDNA was cloned into pSGpuro as well (pLPHwt). To generate the pSGpuro vector the SalI fragment of the pKSpuro vector, which was kindly provided by Peter Laird (University of Southern California School of Medicine, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, CA) (10Tucker K.L. Beard C. Dausmann J. Jackson Grusby L. Laird P.W. Lei H. Li E. Jaenisch R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) was inserted into the partially SalI digested pSG8 (a pSG5 vector (9Green S. Isseman I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) with a multiple cloning site). Monkey kidney COS cells (ATCC CRL-1650) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Caco-2 TC7 and PD10 cells (a gift from Dr. Monique Rousset, Ref. 11Chantret I. Rodolosse A. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Brot Laroche E. Zweibaum A. Rousset M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 213-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1% nonessential amino acids and antibiotics (all from Life Technologies, Inc.). All cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. COS-1 cells were transfected via electroporation as described before (12Ouwendijk J. Moolenaar C.E. Peters W.J. Hollenberg C.P. Ginsel L.A. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Caco-2 cells were transfected by LipofectAMINE treatment. One or two days prior to transfection, 0.2 × 106 Caco-2 TC7 cells were seeded per 35-mm culture dish, so that on the day of transfection the culture was 60–80% confluent but not polarized. During the whole transfection procedure, no antibiotics were used. On the day of transfection, cells were washed twice with OptiMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Solution A, consisting of 2 μg of linearized DNA in 200 μl of OptiMEM, was gently mixed with solution B, consisting of 6 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 200 μl of OptiMEM. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and 1600 μl of OptiMEM was added. The resulting 2 ml. was added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 6 h. Cells were washed with normal Caco-2 medium and incubated in this medium for 24 h, refreshed, and incubated for another 24 h. Cells were trypsinized and seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 103 cells per well. After 24 h, selection medium was added, which consisted of normal Caco-2 medium with an (empirically determined) puromycin concentration of 13 μg/ml. After 1 week, wells with only one colony were selected. After another week, these colonies were trypsinized and cultured further in selection medium. Caco-2 cells or transiently transfected COS-1 cells were metabolically labeled with 100 μCi Tran35S-label (ICN Biomedicals) as described by Naim et al. (8Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the labeling period, the cells were scraped in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 tablet of complete protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim BV) per 25 ml) and lysed at 4 °C for 1 h. For COS cells usually 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer was used for each 100-mm culture dish (about 2–4 × 106 cells). For Caco-2 cells, 0.5 ml was used per filter. Lysates were stored at −135 °C until use. Detergent extracts of cells were centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated as described by Schweizer et al. (13Schweizer A. Fransen J.A. Bachi T. Ginsel L. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar), and the apparent molecular weights were assessed by comparison with high molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) run on the same gel. In some experiments, deglycosylation of the immunoprecipitates with endo H and endo F/GF (also known as PNGase F) (both from New England Biolabs) was performed prior to SDS-PAGE analysis as described before (15Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The sensitivity for proteatic digestion of LPH and LPHST was compared using a trypsin sensitivity assay. Transfected COS-1 cells were metabolically labeled and lysed. LPH and LPHST were immunoprecipitated (see above) using the HBB1/909 antibody. Precipitates were divided into several fractions and treated with 50 μg/ml trypsin at 37 °C for the indicated incubation times. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 8% gel that was analyzed by fluorography. Disaccharidase activities of immunoprecipitated LPHs were measured according to Dahlqvist (16Dahlqvist A. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 22: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar) using lactose as a substrate. The method was essentially the same as described by Naim et al. (8Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPH was immunoprecipitated using the HBB1/909 antibody from lysates of 165-cm2 culture flasks of (transfected) Caco-2 cells. The precipitates were dissolved in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Triton X-100 of which 25-μl aliquots were used for the enzyme activity assay. The amount of precipitated LPH was estimated in 500-, 300-, 200-, and 100-μl aliquots on an SDS-PAGE gel with a bovine serum albumin concentration standard series run on the same gel; the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Cellular localization of expressed proteins in COS-1 cells and Caco-2 cells was studied with cells grown on coverslips. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Immunolabeling was carried out using (as primary antibodies) monoclonal antibodies HBB1/909 against human LPH, P5D4 against the VSV epitope tag, and the polyclonal antibody V496 against the 12 amino acids directly after the signal sequence of pro-LPH. The secondary antibodies employed fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse or swine anti-rabbit IgG, Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (all were from Boehringer Mannheim BV). Surface localization of proteins was assessed in transfected cells that were not fixed nor permeabilized. Labeling was carried out at 4 °C. Label was visualized using a Bio-Rad MRC1000 confocal scanning laser microscope using a double channel for fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red or on a routine fluorescence microscope. Ultrastructural localization studies were performed on transfected Caco-2 TC7 clones grown on a filter that had been confluent for 5 days. They were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) for 1 h and stored until use in 1% paraformaldehyde. Filters were stacked in 10% gelatin and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 24 h. Ultrathin cryosectioning was performed as described before (13Schweizer A. Fransen J.A. Bachi T. Ginsel L. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 17Fransen J.A. Ginsel L.A. Hauri H.P. Sterchi E. Blok J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 6-15PubMed Google Scholar). Sections were incubated with the monoclonal antibodies HBB1/909 against human LPH or P5D4 against the VSV epitope tag, followed by a rabbit polyclonal serum against mouse IgG (Dako A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) and protein A complexed with 10 nm gold (17Fransen J.A. Ginsel L.A. Hauri H.P. Sterchi E. Blok J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 6-15PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopy was performed with a JEOL 1010 electron microscope. To examine the influence of the introduction of the VSV tag into LPH, the processing, localization, and protease sensitivity of both wtLPH and LPHST were compared in COS-1 cells. Immunoprecipitations using the HBB1/909 antibody directed against pro-LPH and mature LPH resulted in precipitation of high mannose (∼215 kDa) and complex glycosylated (∼230 kDa) LPH (Fig. 4, first four lanes). No mature form (∼160 kDa) could be observed, due to the absence in these cells of the protease that is responsible for the α/β cleavage (1Wuthrich M. Grunberg J. Hahn D. Jacob R. Radebach I.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, both LPHST and wtLPH were present at the cell surface as shown by immunofluorescence labeling (see below). The results clearly show that introduction of the VSV tag did not affect the transport competence of the mutant. P5D4, the antibody against the VSV epitope tag, did not recognize wild type pro-LPH but did precipitate the tagged LPH construct LPHST (Fig.4, middle lanes). The V496 antibody directed against an epitope of LPHα precipitated both constructs (Fig. 4, last four lanes). The pro-LPH species precipitated by the V496 antibody corresponds to the mannose-rich precursor as was determined by endo H treatment of the precipitates (not shown). To compare sensitivities toward protease treatment of both LPH and LPHST proteins, they were precipitated from transfected COS-1 cells by the HBB1/909 antibody against LPH. The precipitates were treated for several time intervals with trypsin. In Fig. 5 is shown that insertion of the tag did not alter the sensitivity toward trypsin since both proteins show exactly the same pattern. Trypsin treatment results already after 75 s in a complete cleavage of the high mannose and complex forms of wtLPH and LPHST into two bands of around 140 kDa that remain trypsin insensitive for at least 1 h. After 75 s, a band of about 100 kDa can be observed that gradually disappears after 15 min. In the same time, a band of about 69 kDa appears. Most likely these bands comprise LPHα as proposed earlier (1Wuthrich M. Grunberg J. Hahn D. Jacob R. Radebach I. Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 2Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since differently folded molecules are expected to behave differently toward the same protease, in this case trypsin, the results lend strong support to the notion that the folding of LPH and LPHST in COS-1 cells is similar. A Caco-2 clone with an undetectable endogenous LPH expression (TC7) (11Chantret I. Rodolosse A. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Brot Laroche E. Zweibaum A. Rousset M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 213-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transfected with the pLPHST and pLPHwt constructs. Stable transfectants were selected with puromycin and screened using immunofluorescence microscopy with antibodies directed against LPHβ. From each transfection, the clone with the highest expression was chosen for further studies. For the LPHST construct, this clone is called ST54, the wtLPH clone is WT2. As a control, a clone with an endogenous LPH expression (PD10) (11Chantret I. Rodolosse A. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Brot Laroche E. Zweibaum A. Rousset M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 213-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Immunoprecipitation of pro-LPH and mature LPH from pulse-chased WT2 cells shows that LPH is synthesized as a 215-kDa single-chain polypeptide (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2), which becomes complex glycosylated to 230 kDa and therefore endo H insensitive after 4 h of chase (lanes 3 and 4). At this point, LPHβ appears as a faint band of 160 kDa. This band is more intense after 24 h of chase when the high mannose form has disappeared (lanes 5 and 6). This processing pattern matches the pattern observed in PD10 cells (lanes 13–18). In intestinal explants, the processing appears to be somewhat faster (2Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but is essentially the same. Introduction of a VSV tag in LPH did not influence the processing since LPHST was processed in ST54 cells (Fig. 6, lanes 7–12) in a comparable fashion to wild type LPH in both WT2 and PD10 cells. Sometimes a band of about 180 kDa is observed in Fig. 6 (lanes 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, and 13). This is a nonspecific background band that can be observed in other immunoprecipitations as well, like with anti-sucrase-isomaltase antibodies from not only ST54 but from other Caco-2 cells as well (data not shown). The enzymatic activity of immunoprecipitated lactase from a 165-cm2 culture flask wtLPH or LPHST transfected Caco-2 cells was determined. The lactase precipitated from both cell lines was capable of cleaving 59 and 61 nmol of lactose per minute, respectively. The protein quantities as determined by Coomassie staining of an SDS-PAGE gel with the immunoprecipitates were essentially the same. Therefore we conclude that both constructs display comparable lactase activities and that the introduction of the tag has no influence on this activity. V496 is an antibody directed against the 12 amino acids following the signal sequence of pro-LPH (2Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies, a 100-kDa band could be observed after immunoprecipitations from intestinal explants using this antibody, which was suspected to be LPHα (2Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A band of this size was never observed in immunoprecipitation studies from Caco-2 clones in this study. Only the high mannose pro-LPH could be precipitated by the V496 antibody from both Caco-2 WT2 and ST54 cells. No complex glycosylated bands were observed even after a chase period of 24 h (not shown). Apart from this high mannose band, no other specific band was visible. This lower affinity of V496 for complex glycosylated LPH was found in COS-1 cells as well. P5D4 did not precipitate any specific protein from WT2 cells but precipitated both high-mannose and complex glycosylated form from ST54 cells (not shown). No other specific band could be found. Overall no specific LPHα band could be precipitated by the different antibodies and from the different cellular models. HBB1/909 is a monoclonal antibody that recognizes pro-LPH and mature LPH (6Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In immunofluorescence studies on permeabilized wtLPH and LPHST-transfected COS-1 cells, this antibody labeled the cell surface and an intracellular network, probably the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 7, panel A and D). On nonpermeabilized cells, only the surface was labeled (not shown). The V496 antibody labeled an intracellular network, probably the endoplasmic reticulum and the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (Fig. 7, panel B and E). On nonpermeabilized cells, no labeling could be observed (not shown), indicating that V496 was not able to label LPH at the cell surface. By contrast, P5D4 did not only show labeling of an intracellular network but also surface labeling on permeabilized cells that were transfected with LPHST (Fig. 7, panel F). P5D4 was also able to label the cell surface of nonpermeabilized LPHST cells (not shown). P5D4 but not V496 recognizes complex glycosylated pro-LPHST, indicating that only complex glycosylated LPHST reaches the cell surface, as was already shown by Sterchi et al. (1Wuthrich M. Grunberg J. Hahn D. Jacob R. Radebach I. Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with wtLPH were not labeled by P5D4 (Fig. 7, panel C). In immunofluorescence studies using HBB1/909 on permeabilized 5 day confluent Caco-2 WT2 and ST54 cells, a patchy labeling pattern was visible on some clusters of cells, whereas others did not show label (Fig. 7, panel G and J). After subcloning using a limiting dilution protocol, the same distribution was observed (not shown). A comparable mosaic expression has been described for in vivo expression of LPH and for other transfections in Caco-2 cells before (11Chantret I. Rodolosse A. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Brot Laroche E. Zweibaum A. Rousset M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 213-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Vachon P.H. Perreault N. Magny P. Beaulieu J.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Labeling of nonpermeabilized cells also showed a patchy labeling pattern, indicating that mainly the cell surface was labeled (Fig. 8, panel A and D). This surface was shown to be the apical membrane by confocal microscopy (Fig. 9).Figure 9Confocal microscopy on permeabilized Caco-2 LPHST cells showed that only the apical surface of the cells was labeled. LPH was labeled with HBB1/909 and rabbit anti-mouse-fluorescein isothiocyanate, and the nuclei were stained using propidium iodide. On the line across panel A, a vertical section was made that is represented in panel B. Bar, 25 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Immunoelectron microscopy studies on WT2 and ST54 cells confirmed the immunofluorescence data. Some cells did not have any label, whereas others were clearly labeled the brush border (Fig.10). At the basolateral membrane (Fig.10, arrow), no labeling was observed. Some gold particles could be found in the endoplasmic reticulum. The labeling pattern of WT2 (Fig. 10, panel A) and ST54 (panel B) was essentially the same. Despite the fact that V496 labeled some intracellular structures in transfected COS-1 cells in immunolocalization studies, no labeling could be found under the same conditions in transfected Caco-2 cells (Fig. 7, panels H and K). This is a consequence of the differences in the steady state in COS-1 and Caco-2 cells. In transiently transfected COS-1 cells, the protein synthesis level is much higher then in stably transfected Caco-2. Therefore relatively more LPH in COS-1 cells is present in its high mannose glycosylated form, and recognized by V496. P5D4 against the VSV tag was able to show a faint label at the surface of a few (less then 0.1%) Caco-2 cells expressing tagged LPH (Fig. 7, panel L; Fig. 8, panel D). This surface staining is most likely labeling of complex glycosylated pro-LPH, which could be precipitated in surface immunoprecipitation experiments on Caco-2 ST54 and WT2 cells using the HBB1/909 antibody (Fig. 11). From the apical membrane, LPHβ and complex glycosylated pro-LPHST could be precipitated (lane 1). From the basolateral membrane, some pro-LPHST but not LPHβ could be precipitated (lane 2). Expression of pro-LPH at the cell surface has been found before in biopsy samples (20Mantei N. Villa M. Enzler T. Wacker H. Boll W. James P. Hunziker W. Semenza G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, it was found at both membrane domains as well (21Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Grunberg J. Luginbuhl U. Sterchi E.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The ultimate fate of pro-LPH on the basolateral membrane, degradation, or transport to the brush border needs further analysis. Many proteins undergo proteolytic processing after translation. Among these proteins are lysosomal (23Hasilik A. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 130-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), secretory (24Thorens B. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1995; 21: 311-318Google Scholar, 25Rouille Y. Duguay S.J. Lund K. Furuta M. Gong Q. Lipkind G. Oliva Jr., A.A. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 322-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and some plasma membrane proteins. Most disaccharidases are plasma membrane proteins that are cleaved into their subunits (26Semenza G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 255-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPH is an example of a disaccharidase that undergoes proteolytic cleavage. Unlike other examples LPH has a C-terminal instead of a N-terminal transmembrane region, and both its active sites are located on one cleavage product. Furthermore, it consists of four homologous regions instead of two, which are probably derived from a double gene duplication (20Mantei N. Villa M. Enzler T. Wacker H. Boll W. James P. Hunziker W. Semenza G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Two of these regions, III and IV, contain the active sites and are both localized on the same cleavage product, LPHβ, which is expressed on the brush-border membrane. The second cleavage product, LPHα, possesses the other two homologous regions, I and II, but does not show any activity toward disaccharides (2Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Naim H.Y. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 255-258PubMed Google Scholar). Two separate studies have reported a role for LPHα as an intramolecular chaperone (2Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Oberholzer T. Mantei N. Semenza G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). An additional function could be hypothesized because of the internal homologies and because LPHα is relatively large (714 residues). Therefore we developed a model in which we could study LPHα in more detail. This model consists of Caco-2 cells expressing wild type or modified LPH containing a VSV epitope tag in its LPHα domain for additional recognition possibilities. Immunoprecipitation studies from these cells using both an antibody against LPHα and an antibody against the LPHα-inserted tag did not result in a specific profragment band. Furthermore, localization studies in Caco-2 cells did not result in specific labeling in any LPH-positive cell. We suggest that in Caco-2 cells LPHα is degraded soon after cleavage since no intra- or extracellular accumulation could be observed. Our results do not ascertain whether degradation of LPHα occurs on its way to the brush border or at the brush border itself."
https://openalex.org/W2092636597,"ArsA, the catalytic subunit of an anion-translocating ATPase, has two consensus nucleotide binding sites, one N-terminal and one C-terminal. A mutation producing a G15C substitution in the N-terminal domain resulted in substantial reductions in arsenite resistance, transport, and ATPase activity. A second site revertant (A344V) adjacent to the C-terminal nucleotide binding site was previously shown to restore arsenite resistance, suggesting the interaction of the nucleotide binding sites in ArsA (Li, J., Liu, S., and Rosen, B. P. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 25247–25252). In this study, it is shown that alteration of Ala-344 to bulkier residues, including Cys, Thr, Pro, Asp, Leu, Phe, Tyr, or Arg, also suppressed the G15C substitution. However, A344G or A344S substitutions only marginally suppressed the primary mutation. Alteration of Gly-15 to Ala, Cys, Asp, Tyr, or Arg each resulted in decreased arsenite resistance. The larger the residue volume of the substitution, the lower the resistance, with a G15R substitution producing the least resistance. Resistance in a strain expressing an arsA gene encoding the G15R substitution could be rescued by A344S, A344T, A344D, A344R, or A344V second site suppressors. The larger the residue is then the greater the suppression is. The in vitro ArsA ATPase activities from purified wild type, G15A, G15C, and G15R exhibits an inverse relationship between activity and residue volume. Purified G15A and G15C exhibited both an increase in the Km for ATP and a decrease in Vmax. The results are consistent with a physical interaction of the two nucleotide binding domains and indicate that the geometry at the interface between the N- and C-terminal nucleotide binding sites places spatial constraints on allowable residues in that interface.

Bhattacharjee H. Shi W.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This ATP-coupled oxyanion transporter consists of two types of subunits. The 63-kDa ArsA subunit is the catalytic component, with As(III)/Sb(III)-stimulated ATPase activity, and is allosterically activated by binding of As(III) or Sb(III) to a triad of cysteine thiols (4Bhattacharjee H.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12570-12576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and functions as both the membrane anchor for ArsA and the anion-translocating sector of the pump (7Tsai K.-J. Hsu C.-M. Rosen B.P. Zool. Studies. 1997; 36: 1-16Google Scholar). ArsA has two homologous halves, A1 and A2, most likely the result of an ancestral gene duplication and fusion (1Chen C.-M. Misra T.K. Silver S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15030-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each half has a consensus glycine-rich sequence similar to a Walker A motif or P-loop (8Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar, 9Bossemeyer D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 201-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 10Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Clark B.F.C. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1347-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In ArsA, the P-loop sequences are G15KGGVGKT and G334KGGVGKT, respectively. P-loops are usually flanked by a hydrophobic β-sheet and an α-helix (11Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The results of genetic complementation (12Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and biochemical reconstitution (13Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9698-9704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that an A1 and A2 domain interacted to form a catalytic unit. The isolation of intragenic suppressors supported the concept that a single catalytic site was formed at the interface of the A1 and A2 ATP binding sites (14Li J. Liu S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25247-25252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study, amino acid residues 15 and 344 of ArsA were substituted with a variety of other residues. In single mutants, the smaller the residue at position 15, the greater the phenotypic resistance, with a G15R substitution producing the least resistance. In contrast, the larger the residue at position 344, the greater the phenotypic suppression of arsAG15C and arsAG15R mutations. Wild type, G15A, and G15C ArsAs were purified and characterized. There was an inverse relationship between ATPase activity and residue volume at position 15, consistent with the resistance phenotype of the mutants. Enzymes with larger residues at position 15 had an increased Km for ATP and a decrease in Vmax. These results suggest that there are spatial constraints in allowable residues at the interface of the A1 and A2 nucleotide binding sites.

Restriction enzymes and nucleic acid modifying enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. WizardTM Plus minipreps DNA purification system and WizardTM DNA clean-up system (Promega) were used to prepare plasmid DNA for restriction enzyme digestion and recovering DNA fragments from low melting agarose gels, respectively. Mutations in the arsA gene were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered SitesTM in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega). Plasmid pALTER-AB (4Bhattacharjee H. Li J. Ksenzenko M.Yu.

Oligonucleotides synthesized with a degeneracy have the bases present in the mixture indicated in parentheses. Substitutions that resulted in mutation are underlined. The identity of each mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the entire mutated gene. Double-stranded plasmid DNA was prepared using the QIAGEN DNA Purification System. Sequencing was performed using the Pharmacia Cy5 labeled autosequence kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and ALF express apparatus by the method of Sanger et al. (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52749) Google Scholar). Other single or double mutants were constructed by molecular subcloning using a combination of two restriction endonucleases, either HindIII and SphI or SphI and KpnI (Table I). Inhibition by arsenite was tested on solid Luria-Bertani media. The minimal inhibitory concentration is the concentration at which no growth was detected. Cells were grown overnight and streaked to single colonies on agar plates containing varying concentrations of sodium arsenite. Growth was monitored after 24 h at 37 °C. Proteins were purified from the cytosol of 2.5 liters of induced cultures as described previously (4Bhattacharjee H. Li J. Ksenzenko M.Yu. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11245-11250Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Li J. Liu S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol.

Each ArsA was judged to be greater than 95% homogeneous by Coomassie Blue staining of samples separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar). The concentrations of purified ArsAs were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) or from the absorption at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 33,480 (19Rosen B.P. Weigel U. Karkaria C. Gangola P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3067-3070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured using a coupled assay (20Vogel G. Steinhart R. Biochemistry. 1976; 16: 208-216Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar), as described previously (21Hsu C.-M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the effect of residue volume at position 15 on arsenite resistance, Gly-15 was altered to Ala, Asp, Cys, Tyr, and Arg. An inverse relationship was observed (Fig. 1). The larger the residue then the resistance was less, with the phenotype of cells expressing an arsAG15R mutation similar to cells with vector alone. By random mutagenesis, an A344V alteration was found to suppress the arsenite-sensitive phenotype of an arsAG15C mutant (14Li J. Liu S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25247-25252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The effect of single mutations at residue 344 on arsenite resistance was examined. Cells expressing six single arsAA344X genes (X = G, S, T, D, R and V) each exhibited an arsenite-resistant phenotype, with only slight differences in resistances at higher concentrations of arsenite (Fig. 2). To examine the relationship of residues 15 and 344 in more detail, the codon for Ala-344 in the arsAG15C gene was changed to 11 different codons by site-directed mutagenesis with mixtures of oligonucleotides, producing ArsA derivatives G15C/A344X, where X = G, S, C, T, V, P, D, L, F, Y, or R. Cells harboring the mutated arsA genes and wild-type arsB gene were phenotypically characterized for arsenite resistance (Fig.3). Cells expressing the wild-type arsAB genes could tolerate up to 10 mmNaAsO2; cells containing only vector were unable to grow when the concentration of arsenite was more than 1 mm. Alteration of Ala-344 to bulkier residues, including Cys, Thr, Pro, Asp, Leu, Phe, Tyr, or Arg each suppressed the G15C substitution. Moreover, the larger the residue at position 344, the higher the concentration of arsenite required to inhibit growth. However, the smaller A344G did not suppress, and a substitution of serine, which has a volume near that of alanine, only marginally suppressed the primary mutation. Similarly, when the G15R substitution was combined with substitutions at residue 344, the larger the residue at position 344, then the higher was the resistance of the double mutant (Fig.4). While the A344R substitution suppressed both G15C or G15R, the level of suppression was somewhat less than expected from a simple steric effect, suggesting a slight negative effect of a basic residue at position 344. Overall, however, these results suggest that the primary effect of the side chain at residue 344 is a steric one, rather than that of charge or polarity.Figure 4Suppression of an arsAG15R mutation by arsAA344X mutations.Phenotypes of cells expressing arsAG15R/A344Xdouble mutations were determined as described in the legend to Fig.1. Cells had the following plasmids: •, pALTER-AB (arsAB); □, pG15R/ A344V (arsAG15R/A344V B); ▴, pG15R/ A344R (arsAG15R/A344R B); ▪, pG15R/ A344D (arsAG15R/A344D B); ⋄, pG15R/ A344T (arsAG15R/A344T B); ▵, pG15R/ A344S (arsAG15R/A344S B); ♦, pG15R (arsAG15R B); and ○, vector plasmid pALTERTM-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It was of interest to examine the effect of single and double mutations on the catalytic activity of the ArsA ATPase. None of the mutations reported here resulted in reduced synthesis of ArsA (data not shown). However, just as was reported by the A344V substitution (14Li J. Liu S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25247-25252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), most A344X derivatives formed inclusion bodies, with very little enzyme found in the cytosol. Attempts to purify the residual soluble portions were unsuccessful; the altered proteins appeared to degrade to smaller polypeptides during chromatography. The formation of inclusion bodies and increased degradation may result from defective folding of the abnormal proteins. However, the G15A, G15C, and G15R singly substituted derivatives could be purified. Consistent with the phenotypic effect of arsAG15R, the G15R enzyme was catalytically inactive. When the catalytic parameters of G15C and G15R were compared with wild-type enzyme, their affinity for ATP was decreased from 0.05 to 0.7 mm, and the Vmax for G15A and G15C was decreased 60 and 90%, respectively. The glycine-rich P-loop is conserved in purine binding enzymes from prokaryotes to eukaryotes (8Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J.

Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar) imply that the function of the P-loop is conserved in each enzyme, even though the primary sequence of the P-loop for each specific purine NTPase is variant, and each enzyme has different biological activity (26Shen H. Yao B. Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9424-9428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using cassette mutagenesis, Shen et al. (26Shen H. Yao B. Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9424-9428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) substituted each residue of the primary sequence of the yeast mitochondrial F1-ATPase β-subunit P-loop and found that there were constraints imposed by only four residues in the P-loop (G190XXXXGKT197). Furthermore, stereochemical constraints were observed in the P-loops of the E. coli ATP synthase β-subunit (27Wilke-Mounts S. Pagan J. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and dinucleotide binding proteins (28Wierenga R.K. Maeyer M.C.H.D. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1346-1357Crossref Scopus (465) Google Scholar). An inverse relationship was observed between the volume of β-subunit residue 174 of the E. coli ATP synthase and ATPase activity, suggesting that residue 174 was spatially near the ATP binding site (29Omote H. Park M.-Y. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10265-10269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a prediction that was subsequently verified in the crystal structure (25Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar). ArsA, the catalytic subunit of the Ars pump, has two P-loops (1Chen C.-M. Misra T.K. Silver S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15030-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an allosteric effector binding site (4Bhattacharjee H. Li J. Ksenzenko M.Yu. Rosen B.P. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 19272-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the A1 P-loop (G15KGGVGKT22). Substitutions of residues Gly-334 (14Li J. Liu S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25247-25252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and Lys-340 (31Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19272-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the A2 nucleotide binding domain (G334KGGVGKT341) were better tolerated than the equivalent substitutions in the A1 P-loop. From a combination of results from genetic complementation (12Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), biochemical reconstitution (13Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9698-9704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and intragenic suppression (14Li J. Liu S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25247-25252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), a model has been proposed in which the A1 and A2 nucleotide binding domains of ArsA must physically interact for catalysis to occur, requiring the two domains to be located near each other in the quaternary structure of the enzyme. In the absence of structural information on ArsA, this hypothesis was tested genetically. An intragenic suppressor of a G15C substitution in the A1 P-loop was found to be in the codon for Ala-344 (14Li J. Liu S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25247-25252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In nucleotide binding sites, the P-loop is usually preceded by a β-sheet and followed by an α-helix (11Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Ala-344 is at the beginning of a putative α-helix which follows the A2 P-loop. In this study, the effect of mutation of the codon for Ala-344 to the codons for eleven different residues was examined. The substitutions include residues representing each type of side group: nonpolar (Gly, Ala, Val, Pro, and Leu), polar (Ser, Thr, and Cys), aromatic (Phe and Tyr), negatively charged (Asp), and positively charged (Arg). The ability to suppress the phenotype of the primary mutation correlated only with size and not charge or polarity, with bulkier residues at position 344 providing better suppression of the change at position 15 (Figs. 3 and 4). The effect of side group substitution at position 15 was examined. A series of single mutants were created by changing the codon for Gly15 in the A1 P-loop to codons for nonpolar (Ala), polar (Cys), aromatic (Tyr), negatively charged (Asp), and positively charged (Arg). Again, the effects correlated primarily with side chain volume and not charge or polarity (Fig. 1). In contrast to the effect of residue size at position 344, there was an inverse effect of residue 15 side group size on arsenite resistance. However, considering that the volumes of arginine (197 Å3) and tyrosine (191 Å3) are similar, an arginine substitution produced less resistance than anticipated. Nevertheless, the G15R phenotype could be effectively rescued by introduction of a larger residue at position 344 (Fig. 4). Thus the primary effect is one of size. These results demonstrate that the interaction of the two nucleotide binding domains can be spatially constrained by the steric effects of residue side chain volume, presumably at an interface between the two domains. Many transport ATPases have multiple nucleotide binding domains, including ArsA (1Chen C.-M. Misra T.K. Silver S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15030-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the F1-ATPase (25Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar) and ABC transporters such as the P-glycoprotein (32Dey S. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Ambudkar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10594-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The existence of multiple sites may provide control of catalysis. For example, multisite catalysis of F1 results from positive cooperativity between nucleotide binding sites (25Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein has two drug binding sites and an allosteric site for modulators of drug transport (32Dey S. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Ambudkar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10594-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Moreover, conformational communication between a drug binding site and the nucleotide binding domains of the P-glycoprotein has also been reported (33Liu R. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11865-11873Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Information flow between metal or drug binding sites and catalytic sites in transport ATPases is both expected and necessary for function, both in P-glycoprotein and ArsA. We postulate that this transduction of information is most likely communicated by conformational changes in the enzymes that bring the nucleotide binding sites together, with catalysis accelerated at the interface of the two domains."

Three conserved LDV motifs (LDV-1 to 3) occur in the ectodomain of the human and mouse α4-subunit, the functions of which are unknown. We demonstrate here that α4-transfected fibroblasts with mutation in LDV-1 (D489N) behaved like α4-wild type but that LDV-2 (D698N) and LDV-3 (D811N) mutants were impaired in binding and spreading on α4-specific substrates. On the RGD-containing fibronectin fragment FN-120 there was an inverse behavior; now the α4-wild type and the LDV-1 mutant could not adhere whereas the two other mutants could. The β1 chain was critical for the differential integrin response. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the LDV-2 and -3 mutations reduced the strength of the α4β1 association, favored the formation of α5β1, and prevented the expression of α4β7 on the cell surface. Our results indicate that LDV-2 and LDV-3 are critical for the formation of a functional heterodimer. The presence of similar amino acid motifs in ligands and the α4-subunit suggest that metal coordination plays an important role in integrin-ligand binding as well as for heterodimer formation.

The presence of similar amino acid motifs in ligands and the α4-subunit suggest that metal coordination plays an important role in integrin-ligand binding as well as for heterodimer formation. Integrins are a class of heterodimeric cell-surface molecules that are important mediators of cell function. In addition to providing the necessary mechanical stability for cell-cell or cell-matrix contact, integrins can transduce signals out of cells and into the cell from the microenvironment. The cytoplasmic portion of integrin chains can interact with signal- and cytoskeleton-associated proteins and thereby influence cellular properties like shape, adhesion, motility, growth, and differentiation (for review see Refs. 1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar and 2Juliano R. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).An essential feature of integrins is their complex regulation of function which despite their biological importance as adhesive structures is not fully understood. Both subunits form a non-covalently linked heterodimer that appears to be important for transport to the cell surface as well as for ligand binding. It is believed that integrins contain multiple ligand contact sites, and several regions and residues have been identified in both α and β chains. All of the identified contact sites carry amino acid sequences with oxygenated side chains that can potentially bind divalent cations. It has been estimated that integrin heterodimers can bind up to five divalent cations. The observation that all integrin ligands possess a critical aspartate or glutamate residue in their contact site to the integrin has led to the proposal that a metal ion provides a bridge between ligand and receptor. In addition to ligand binding, divalent cations are believed to contribute to the regulation of receptor conformation (for review see Refs. 3Sanchez-Mateos P. Cabanas C. Sanchez-Madrid F. Semin.

A dominant binding site in fibronectin involves the LDV motif in the HepII/IIICS region, and the peptide surrounding and encompassing these residues has been termed CS-1 peptide (23Komoriya A.

A homologous sequence IDS, present in domains 1 and 4 of VCAM-1, is essential for the binding to α4 integrins under static conditions (25Osborn L. Vassallo C. Griffiths Browning B. Tizard R.

Immunol. 1996; 157: 5061-5069PubMed Google Scholar), and an LDT sequence in the first domain of MAdCAM-1 is important for α4β7binding (29Briskin M.J. Rott L. Butcher E.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 719-726PubMed Google Scholar). Three conserved LDV motifs occur in the extracellular sequence of the α4-subunit in mouse and man which have been termed LDV-1–3 (30Altevogt P. Hubbe M. Ruppert M. Lohr J. vonHoegen P. Sammar M. Andrew D.P. McEvoy L. Humphries M.J. Butcher E.C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).We previously reported that the purified α4-subunit as well as an LDV-containing peptide derived from the 80-kDa N-terminal portion could support the binding of lymphocytes via α4β1 or α4β7(30Altevogt P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18401-18407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have suggested that the LDV sites, in particular LDV sites 1 and 2, may serve as additional cation binding motifs that are required for cell adhesion. To understand further the functional role of the LDV motifs in the α4-subunit, we have mutated the central aspartic acid to asparagine in each site in a consecutive fashion and have examined the effect on cell adhesion and spreading. Our results suggest a role for LDV-2 and -3 but not LDV-1 in the formation of a functional αβ heterodimer. It is therefore possible that both ligand binding and the dimerization of α- and β-subunits follow the same principal rule of metal ion coordination.DISCUSSIONThe goal of the present study was to assess the functional role of the three LDV sites in the mouse α4-subunit by site-directed mutagenesis. We find that Asp → Asn substitution in LDV-2 and -3 but not in LDV-1 affects adhesion and spreading of transfected fibroblasts on α4-specific substrates. The α4 mutant cells were differentially affected in adhesion and spreading on FN-40. Whereas the mut 12 cells were mainly compromised in spreading, the mut 123 cells were affected in both adhesion and spreading suggesting that the mutation of the LDV-3 site was giving an additional effect. In the presence of Mn2+ions the defects of mut 12 and mut 123 cells could be largely restored, and the lack of spreading on FN-40 was overcome by prolonged assay times. This suggested that the receptor was not completely non-functional and that LDV-2 and -3 were probably the most important in events early after α4β1 receptor engagement. Ma et al. (33Ma L. Conrad P.J. Webb D.L. Blue M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18401-18407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have performed similar mutagenesis studies using K562 cells transfected with human α4-subunits in which the LDV sites were mutated to LEV. These authors demonstrated impaired adhesion of D489E and D698E mutants (equivalent to LDV-1 and -2) on FN-40 and a 1–3 domain form of VCAM-1. There was, however, no effect in D811E mutants (33Ma L. Conrad P.J. Webb D.L. Blue M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18401-18407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The reasons for the discrepancies between the previous study and our data are not entirely clear but could be due, at least in part, to the choice of amino acid exchanges. Whereas Asp → Glu mutations retain the negative charge in the amino acid side chain, our Asp → Asn mutations abolished it. Also the type of mutagenesis (single versusaccumulating mutations) is different, and cell spreading was not analyzed by Ma et al. (33Ma L. Conrad P.J. Webb D.L. Blue M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18401-18407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Based on sequence comparison it was proposed that Asp-698 and possibly -489 (identical with LDV-2 and -1) may be putative metal-binding sites that might be required to stabilize a protein-protein interaction. The reason why these sites might be important for α4 integrin function remained unclear.Our results provide suggestive evidence that the LDV-2 and -3 sites are important for a functional interaction with the β chain. We postulate that in the presence of a transfected α4-subunit the formation of a functional α4β1 heterodimer is dominant. The formation of other heterodimers, i.e.α5β1, is suppressed presumably due to the lack of available β1 chains, and these α-subunits reach the cell surface by other means. The mutations of LDV-2 and -3 impair the ability of α4 to interact with β1 and favor again the formation of α5β1 at the cell surface.Evidence for this hypothesis came from several independent approaches. First we studied the binding of α4-transfectants to FN-120. We found that in the presence of a transfected α4-wt or mut 1 subunit the fibroblasts were unable to adhere and spread via α5β1 on FN-120. In contrast, mut 12 and mut 123 cells could again spread and adhere and behaved similar to the parental 3T3 cells. We could exclude the possibility that the observed differences in the binding were the results of phenotypic changes in the transfectants since the expression levels of α5, αv, α4, and β1 were comparable. Furthermore, back selection of transfectants for α4 loss or low expressing variants fully restored the ability to spread on FN-120, supporting the view that the suppression was due to the presence of the α4-subunit and not an intrinsic failure of the cells. Importantly, the dependence of the phenomenon on amino acid substitutions in the extracellular part of the molecule argued against an involvement of cytoplasmic proteins that may be required for integrin function. It rather appeared that cis-type of interactions with other proteins at the membrane surface was the reason.An important observation was that in the binding of cells both to FN-40 and to FN-120 the β1 chain was involved. In particular, the inverse behavior of the transfectants on both types of substrates was striking. This led us to consider that the β1 chain might be a decisive factor in regulating the integrin response in the mutants. That indeed the β1 chain was crucial was supported by studies on the 9EG7 epitope that has been characterized as a ligand-induced binding site of the β1 chain (43Bazzoni G. Shih D.-T. Buch C.A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25570-25577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the epitope for this mAb was located in the cysteine-rich site of the β1-subunit (43Bazzoni G. Shih D.-T. Buch C.A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25570-25577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) which is juxtaposed to the site on the α4-subunit where Asp-698 and Asp-811 are located. The level of staining for this epitope in the absence of any ligand was consistently higher on mut 12 and mut 123 cells than on α4-wt or mut 1 cells. Thus, the LDV-2 and -3 mutations in the α4 chain induced a change in the accessibility of this particular β1 chain epitope that is usually up-regulated in the presence of bound ligand or activating divalent cations but also by the addition of EDTA (41Ebeling O. Duczmal A. Aigner S. Geiger C. Schöllhammer S. Kemshead J.T. Möller P. Schwarz-Albiez R. Altevogt P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2508-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To study the effect of ligand binding on the 9EG7 epitope, we exposed the α4β1 heterodimer to CS-1 peptide in solution. A clear-cut up-regulation was seen in α4-wt cells. In contrast, there was only little change in mut 123 cells indicating that the epitope was already fully exposed in the first place and could not be up-regulated much further. These data demonstrated that the phenotype of the α4-subunit, either mutated or not, was mirrored in the 9EG7 epitope presumably indicating a conformational change of the β1-subunits imposed by the respective α4 chain. Thus, the 9EG7 epitope acted as an indicator of a change in the αβ conformation.More direct proof that the LDV-2 and -3 mutation affected the conformation of the αβ heterodimer came from biochemical studies. By using different detergents for the solubilization of the cells, we noticed a much decreased stability of the α4β1 heterodimer in mut 12 and mut 123 cells. In the absence of divalent cations the heterodimer could not resist the detergent milieu as evidenced by the reduced presence of β1 chains in the α4-specific precipitates and the failure to detect the α4 80 and α470-kDa fragments in anti-β1-specific precipitates of mut 12 and mut 123 cells. This could mean that the complex was only very poorly associated or even free α4 chain was present at the surface of these cells. Due to the lack of heterodimer-specific mAbs in the mouse, at the present we cannot distinguish between these two possibilities. Precipitation analysis of β1-associated integrin subunits also revealed that the α5 chain was detectable only in mut 12 and mut 123 cells and not present or only weakly present in α4-wt and mut 1 cells. Thus, the precipitation analysis reflected the results from the functional analysis of mutant cells.Further evidence for a role of LDV-2 and -3 in heterodimer formation came from studies on the expression of α4β7in mutant cells. At the cell surface a α4β7heterodimer was only seen in α4-wt and mut 1 cells, whereas in mut 12 and mut 123 cells it was not detectable. Despite this the β7-subunit was available in all mutant cells as detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR and cytoplasmic staining. It is likely that the mutant α4-subunits had a decreased ability to interact with the β7 chain thus preventing the assembly of the heterodimer or its transport to the cell surface.The α4 and other integrins can physically interact with transmembrane-4 superfamily proteins like CD81 (TAPA-1) and others in the cell membrane of different cell lines (44Mannion B.A. Berditchevski F. Kraeft S.-K. Chen L.B. Hemler M.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2039-2047PubMed Google Scholar). The binding site for TAPA-1 in the α4 chain is not entirely clear but has been mapped outside the α4 cytoplasmic tail (44Mannion B.A. Berditchevski F. Kraeft S.-K. Chen L.B. Hemler M.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2039-2047PubMed Google Scholar). Transmembrane-4 superfamily proteins can associate with several integrins, but a direct role in the regulation of α4integrin function has so far not convincingly been demonstrated. Although a possible interaction of these molecules with α4 in our transfected fibroblasts has to be considered, we do not regard this as a reasonable mechanism to explain our results.Sanchez-Aparicio et al. (45Sanchez-Aparicio P. Dominguez-Jimenez C. Garcia-Pardo A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have reported that stimulation of human cells with the β1-specific mAb TS2/16 could not only activate α4β1 but also led to recognition of the RGDS sequence in fibronectin. Thus, the conformational change induced in α4β1 by the mAb resulted in the ability to recognize the RGD sequence. Could the mutated α4-subunit in our transfectants induce a similar change? The data presented in Fig. 9 argue against this possibility. It is evident that the adhesion of mut 12 and mut 123 cells to FN-120 was dependent on α5β1 since it was blocked by the respective mAb but not by the mAb against the α4 integrin.Divalent cations regulate integrins in a complex way. All integrin-ligand interactions are divalent cation-dependent, and putative metal ion-binding sites have been identified in α- and β-subunits (see Refs. 3Sanchez-Mateos P. Cabanas C. Sanchez-Madrid F. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Humphries M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 5Loftus J.C. Liddington R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α-subunit of all integrins contain 3–4 divalent cation binding modules with homology to the EF-hand Ca2+-binding motifs (46Tuckwell D.S. Brass A. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the I domain which is present in many but not all α-subunits a metal ion-dependent adhesion site is present that coordinates Mg2+ (47Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), and a metal ion-dependent adhesion site-like motif is also present in the most conserved region of β integrin subunits (47Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). All these regions are involved in ligand binding implying that the ligand-binding pocket is complex and involves both subunits. Since the ligand epitopes recognized by integrins are often short acidic peptide motifs with central oxygenated amino acids, it has been suggested that receptor-bound cation might act as an integrin-ligand bridge. Recently a model was proposed for the α chain 7-fold repeats that represent about 40% of the extracellular portion of the α chains (48Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). This model predicts a β-propeller domain composed of seven blades made out of β-sheets around a central axis (48Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The I domain is inserted into the β-propeller between the second and the third blade and is predicted to sit on the upper rim ot the β-propeller domain (49Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The β-propeller model and the crystal structure of the α-subunit I domain from CD11a and CD11b (47Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 49Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) have allowed for the first time to propose a dynamic quaternary structure model of integrin-ligand interaction sites (5Loftus J.C. Liddington R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Outside the region of ligand contact the structure and conformation of integrin subunits is less well defined. It is known that the α- and β-subunits form a heterodimer also in the absence of ligand and that withdrawal of divalent cations by chelating agents destabilizes the αβ heterodimer (50Smyth S.S. Joneckis C.C. Parise L.V. Blood. 1993; 81: 2827-2843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Holzmann B. McIntyre B.W. Weissman I.L. Cell. 1989; 56: 37-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 52Loftus J.C. Smith J.W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25235-25238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is quite possible that the conformation of the αβ heterodimer also depends on multiple interactions that, at least to some part, uses metal ion bridging for stabilization. The metal ion-dependent adhesion site-like domain of several integrin β-subunits was suggested to be important for the association with the α-subunit (53Wardlaw A.J. Hibbs M.L. Stacker S.A. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 54Bajt M.L. Ginsberg M.H. Frelinger A.L. Berndt M.C. Loftus J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3789-3794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Tidswell M. Pachynski R. Wu S.W. Qiu S.-Q. Dunham E. Cochran N. Briskin M.J. Kilshaw P.J. Lazarovits A.I. Andrew D.P. Butcher E.C. Yednock T.A. Erle D.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1497-1505PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the β-propeller model predicts that the EF-hand Ca2+-binding motifs are located near one another on the lower surface of the β-propeller domain and might be involved in interactions with the β-subunit rather than in ligand binding (49Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The LDV-2 and -3 sites are located on the stalk region of the α4-subunit. Due to this localization they are probably not directly involved in ligand binding but may be necessary to establish a proper association with the β chain. The lack of this putative association affects the affinity of the receptor and leads to defects that seem to be important in the early phase of ligand binding. These defects in receptor function of mutant cells were restored, although not completely, in the presence of Mn2+ions and by prolonged assay times. It is possible that the presence of Mn2+ enforced additional binding sites. Collectively, our data suggest that LDV-2 and -3 sites represent important contact sites between α4 and its β-subunits. The presence of similar amino acid motifs in ligands and the α4-subunit suggests that metal coordination plays an important role in integrin-ligand binding as well as for heterodimer formation. Integrins are a class of heterodimeric cell-surface molecules that are important mediators of cell function. In addition to providing the necessary mechanical stability for cell-cell or cell-matrix contact, integrins can transduce signals out of cells and into the cell from the microenvironment. The cytoplasmic portion of integrin chains can interact with signal- and cytoskeleton-associated proteins and thereby influence cellular properties like shape, adhesion, motility, growth, and differentiation (for review see Refs. 1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar and 2Juliano R. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). An essential feature of integrins is their complex regulation of function which despite their biological importance as adhesive structures is not fully understood. Both subunits form a non-covalently linked heterodimer that appears to be important for transport to the cell surface as well as for ligand binding. It is believed that integrins contain multiple ligand contact sites, and several regions and residues have been identified in both α and β chains. All of the identified contact sites carry amino acid sequences with oxygenated side chains that can potentially bind divalent cations. It has been estimated that integrin heterodimers can bind up to five divalent cations. The observation that all integrin ligands possess a critical aspartate or glutamate residue in their contact site to the integrin has led to the proposal that a metal ion provides a bridge between ligand and receptor. In addition to ligand binding, divalent cations are believed to contribute to the regulation of receptor conformation (for review see Refs. 3Sanchez-Mateos P. Cabanas C. Sanchez-Madrid F. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Humphries M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 5Loftus J.C.
