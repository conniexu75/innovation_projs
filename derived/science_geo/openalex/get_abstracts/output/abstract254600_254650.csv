Regulation of expression and activity of its inducible subunit, HIF-1α, involves several post-translational modifications. To study HIF-1α phosphorylation, we have used human full-length recombinant HIF-1α as a substrate in kinase assays. We show that at least two different nuclear protein kinases, one of them identified as p42/p44 MAPK, can modify HIF-1α. Analysis of in vitro phosphorylated HIF-1α by mass spectroscopy revealed residues Ser-641 and Ser-643 as possible MAPK phosphorylation sites. Site-directed mutagenesis of these residues reduced significantly the phosphorylation of HIF-1α. When these mutant forms of HIF-1α were expressed in HeLa cells, they exhibited much lower transcriptional activity than the wild-type form. However, expression of the same mutants in yeast revealed that their capacity to stimulate transcription was not significantly compromised. Localization of the green fluorescent protein-tagged HIF-1α mutants in HeLa cells showed their exclusion from the nucleus in contrast to wild-type HIF-1α. Treatment of the cells with leptomycin B, an inhibitor of the major exportin CRM1, reversed this exclusion and led to nuclear accumulation and partial recovery of the activity of the HIF-1α mutants. Moreover, inhibition of the MAPK pathway by PD98059 impaired the phosphorylation, nuclear accumulation, and activity of wild-type GFP-HIF-1α. Overall, these data suggest that phosphorylation of Ser-641/643 by MAPK promotes the nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of HIF-1α by blocking its CRM1-dependent nuclear export.

HIF-1 controls the expression of many genes that are involved in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, glucose uptake, cell metabolism, apoptosis, invasion, or metastasis and are, therefore, critical for adaptation to low oxygen and also tumor progression. HIF-1 consists of two subunits: HIF-1α and HIF-1β (or ARNT). Both contain basic helix loop helix and PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS) domains in their NH2-terminal parts that mediate heterodimerization and binding to DNA regulatory sequences. These sequences, called hypoxia response elements (HRE), are present in the promoter or enhancer regions of HIF-1 target genes. HIF-1α contains, in addition, an oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain and two transactivation domains, N-TAD and C-TAD. These two latter domains are separated by the inhibitory domain, a protein part that when removed increases the transcriptional activity of both TADs. Whereas ARNT is constitutively expressed, also serving as the partner of Aryl hydrocarbon receptor, HIF-1α is unique to HIF-1 and is regulated at multiple levels by hypoxia or other cell signaling pathways (1Semenza G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Under normoxic conditions, the protein levels of HIF-1α are kept very low by von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-mediated polyubiquitination and subsequent targeting to the proteasome (2Ohh M. Park C.W. Ivan M.

Interaction of HIF-1α with VHL, a tumor suppressor protein and part of a E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, is regulated by hydroxylation of two proline residues in the ODD domain of HIF-1α (4Epstein A.C.

Science. 2002; 295: 807-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The proline hydroxylases that modify HIF-1α (members of the EGLN family, termed PHDs or HPHs) are Fe2+ dependent and require molecular oxygen as a substrate (7Semenza G.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Thus normally HIF-1α is hydroxylated, bound by VHL, and rapidly degraded. When oxygen becomes sparse, inhibition of hydroxylation leads to HIF-1α protein stabilization and its rapid accumulation (8Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 9Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). Stabilized HIF-1α can then enter the cell nucleus, heterodimerize with ARNT, bind to DNA, and induce expression of its target genes by recruiting transcriptional coactivators such as CBP/p300. Some of these steps may also be regulated by oxygen tension. It has been suggested that nuclear import of HIF-1α is enhanced under hypoxic conditions (10Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the interaction of HIF-1α with CBP/p300 is also controlled by hydroxylation. An asparaginyl-hydroxylase, called factor inhibiting HIF-1, modifies the C-TAD of HIF-1α and inhibits its association with the transcriptional co-activator CBP/p300 when oxygen is available (6Bruick R.K. McKnight S.L. Science. 2002; 295: 807-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 11Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Thus, hypoxia, apart from stabilizing HIF-1α can also lead to activation of its transcriptional activity. In addition to oxygen-dependent control, expression and activity of HIF-1α under normoxic conditions can be regulated by major signal transduction pathways including those involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK), both of which can be induced by growth factors, cytokines, oncogenes, or hypoxia-mimetic chemicals (1Semenza G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 12Dery M.A. Michaud M.D. Richard D.E. Int. J. Biochem.

However, the exact mechanisms underlying HIF-1α stabilization and subsequent activation by these pathways are not completely understood. A number of reports concerning HIF-1α activation by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway imply that AKT activation causes increased translation of HIF-1α mRNA leading to an enhanced rate of HIF-1α protein synthesis. On the other hand, the MAPK pathway is implicated both in regulation of HIF-1α protein synthesis (14Fukuda R. Hirota K. Fan F. Jung Y.D. Ellis L.M. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38205-38211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) as well as potentiation of its transcriptional activity (15Bardos J.I. Ashcroft M. Bioessays. 2004; 26: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 16Brahimi-Horn C. Mazure N. Pouyssegur J. Cell.

Furthermore, HIF-1α can be directly phosphorylated by p44/p42 MAPK (ERK1/2) both in vitro and in vivo (18Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 19Minet E. Arnould T. Michel G. Roland I. Mottet D. Raes M. Remacle J. Michiels C.

Commun. 2001; 287: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, the exact position of the phosphorylation sites as well as their effect on HIF-1α activity have remained so far unknown (21Sang N. Stiehl D.P. Bohensky J. Leshchinsky I. Srinivas V. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14013-14019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of HIF-1α by other, as yet unidentified, kinases has also been suggested (22Gradin K. Takasaki C. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Sogawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To clarify the issue of HIF-1α phosphorylation we have tried in this work to identify the responsible kinases and map their in vitro phosphorylation sites. Using purified bacterially expressed recombinant HIF-1α as a phosphorylation substrate, we provide evidence that at least two distinct nuclear protein kinases from HeLa cells target the amino- and carboxyl-terminal parts of HIF-1α, respectively. Furthermore, we show that one of these kinases, p42 MAPK, modifies two distinct serine residues at positions 641 and 643, inside the inhibitory domain of HIF-1α. Introduction of mutations in these two sites does not influence the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α in a yeast reconstitution system but strongly inhibits both its activity and nuclear accumulation in HeLa cells. However, this inhibition can be reversed when nuclear export is inhibited by leptomycin B (LMB). Based on these findings, we suggest that phosphorylation of Ser-641/643 by MAPK enhances the nuclear accumulation and activity of HIF-1α by blocking its CRM1-mediated nuclear export. Plasmid Constructions—Construction of NH2- and COOH-terminal deletions of HIF-1α cloned into pBS-SK(+) was described previously (23Braliou G.G. Venieris E. Kalousi A. Simos G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 346: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The corresponding cDNA inserts were subcloned as BamHI fragments into pGEX-4T-1 bacterial expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) yielding pGEX-HIF-1α-1–251, -1–530, -1–652, -348–826, and -652–826. Single point HIF-1α mutants HS641A, HS643A, and the double mutant HSDMA were constructed using as template pGEX-HIF-1α (24Chachami G. Paraskeva E. Georgatsou E. Bonanou S. Simos G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), containing the full-length cDNA of HIF-1α, with the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the primers HS641A sense, 5′-GTGGGTAGGAGATGGAGCTGCAATCAATATTTTAATGTC-3′; HS641A antisense, 5′-GACATTAAAATATTGATTGCAGCTCCATCTCCTACCCAC-3′; HS643A sense, 5′-GATTGCATCTCCAGCTCCTACCCACATACATAAAG-3′; HS643A antisense, 5′-CTTTATGTATGTGGGTAGGAGCTGGAGATGCAATC-3′; HSDMA sense, 5′-GATTGCAGCTCCAGCTCCTACCCACATACATAAAG-3′; and HSDMA antisense, 5′-CTTTATGTATGTGGGTAGGAGCTGGAGCTGCAATC-3′. The DNA sequence of the point mutants was confirmed by sequencing performed by Lark Technologies Inc. (Hope End, Essex, UK). All forms of HIF-1α were then subcloned as BamHI fragments into the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) and in the yeast expression vector pBEVY-GU (25Miller 3rd, C.A. Martinat M.A. Hyman L.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3577-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To construct GAL4-DBD fusions, the cDNA fragment corresponding to HIF-1α-(348–826) (HΔN) was obtained by PCR using as template pGEX-HIF-1α (wild-type and point mutant forms) and the primers H348F (5′-TTTTTGGATCCATGCACGACTTGATTTTCTCCCTTC-3′) and HIF-C-B (5′-TTTTTGGATCCTCAGTTAACTTGATCCAAAGC-3′). The derived fragments were subcloned as BamHI inserts into the pBXGI mammalian expression vector, a gift by Dr. A. Kretsovali (IMBB, FORTH, Heraklion, Greece), in-frame with the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the yeast transactivator GAL4 (amino acids 1–147) yielding GAL4-HΔN, -HΔN-S641A, -HΔN-S643A, and -HΔN-SDMA. Cell Lines, Transfection, and Luciferase Assays—Human HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections were carried out in 10-cm dishes or 12-well plates by using the TransPass™ D2 Transfection Reagent (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). In each experiment the total amount of DNA was adjusted to 1–2 μg/well or to 10 μg/dish. When required, 19 h after transfection cells were treated for 5 h with 50 μm PD98059, 10 μm MG132, or 20 ng/ml LMB, purchased from Sigma. Fractionation of HeLa cells was performed as previously described (26Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were performed in cells transiently co-transfected with equal amounts of plasmids expressing different forms of HIF-1α (or the empty parental vectors pEGFP-C1 and pBXGI as controls), the firefly luciferase reporter plasmids pGL3–5HRE-VEGF, kindly provided by Dr. A. J. Giacia (Stanford University) or gal4-tk-luc, a gift by Dr. G. U. Ryffel (Institut fur Zellbiologie Tumorforschung, Germany), and as controls the β-galactosidase expressing plasmid CMV-lacZ, a gift by Dr. A. Kretsovali (IMBB, FORTH, Heraklion, Greece) or the Renilla luciferase expressing plasmid pCI-Renilla, generously provided by Dr. M. U. Muckenthaler (University of Heidelberg, Germany). 24 h post-transfection, cells were washed with PBS, lysed, and luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase assay kit or Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity values from cells expressing GFP-HIF-1α were normalized to their β-galactosidase or Renilla luciferase activities and are expressed as -fold increase in relation to cells expressing GFP or GAL4 alone and as relative luciferase units. Protein Purification and Phosphorylation Assays—GST-HIF-1α, GST-HS641A, GST-HS643A, GST-HSDMA, and the GST-HIF-1α deletion mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously reported for GST-HIF-1α (24Chachami G. Paraskeva E. Georgatsou E. Bonanou S. Simos G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 or 60 min, in a total volume of 25 μl with phosphorylation buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 50 μm ATP), 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) when required, 1–3 μg of the appropriate substrate, and an aliquot of cell extract or recombinant active p42 MAPK (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) as indicated in the figure legends. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 3 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and autoradiography. To quantify the relative phosphorylation levels of the different substrates, bands corresponding to the substrates were excised from the gels and their radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Phosphorylation assays in gels (in situ assays) were performed essentially as previously described (27Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) by adding 0.1 mg/ml GST-HIF-1α or GST (as control) into the separating gel prior to its polymerization and using 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for the kinase assay. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot—Proteins were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Coomassie Blue or Western blotting using an anti-HIF-1α mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories), a rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP serum generously provided by Dr. H. Boleti (Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece), or antibodies against p44/42 MAP kinase and phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) or goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling) followed by ECL or by detection with color reaction using chloronapthol and H2O2 as substrates. Mass Spectrometry—Proteins were visualized by staining SDS-PAGE gels with silver nitrate, the gel bands were excised and cut into small pieces. The gel particles were reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated with iodoacetamide before being subjected to in-gel digestion with mass spectroscopy grade gold trypsin (Promega) in 40 mm ammonium carbonate overnight. The resulting peptides were eluted from gel particles with successive washes with 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid and then concentrated by SpeedVac to near dryness. The volume of the sample was adjusted to 10 μl with 0.1% formic acid and injected in a nano-high performance liquid chromatography system (Ultimate, LC Packings, Sunnyvale, CA). Tryptic peptides were separated on a PepMap reversed phase C18 column (75 μm × 15 cm, LC Packings). The injected samples were eluted at 180 nl/min with a 2–80% (v/v) acetonitrile/water gradient containing 0.1% formic acid over 55 min. The separated tryptic fragments were visualized by detection of the absorbance at 214 nm and were introduced online into a LCQ Deca ion-trap mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-electrospray source (ThermoFinnigan, Waltham, MA). For the analysis of peptides, data-dependent MS/MS experiments were performed. The method consisted of an MS scan (scan event 1) with subsequent MS/MS scans (scan events 2, 3, and 4) of the three most intense ions from the MS scan. The data were collected using Xcalibur software (ThermoFinnigan) and peptide analysis was performed with TurboSequest software. Differentially modified serine and threonine molecular mass values were used to identify phosphorylated peptides. Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells transfected with GFP-HIF-1α or its point mutants were washed with cold PBS 24 h after transfection and lysed (20 min, 4 °C) in buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), 50 mm β-glycerolphosphate, and 10 mm Na3VO4. After centrifugation, the sample volume was adjusted to 800 μl with lysis buffer and samples were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 1 μl of anti-GFP serum. 20 μl of Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) bead slurry was added and incubation continued for 16 h at 4 °C under gentle shaking. Beads were collected by centrifugation, washed 3 times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by SDS sample buffer. Yeast Transformation and β-Galactosidase Assay—A yeast strain expressing human ARNT and carrying the reporter gene plasmid pHRE-lacZ (23Braliou G.G. Venieris E. Kalousi A. Simos G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 346: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) was transformed with pBEVY-GU-derived plasmids expressing the wild-type or point mutant forms of HIF-1α. Independent transformants were selected, cultured, and assayed for β-galactosidase assay as previously described (23Braliou G.G. Venieris E. Kalousi A. Simos G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 346: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells grown on coverslips were transiently transfected with GFP-tagged versions of HIF-1α and 24 h post-transfection were washed once with PBS and fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. After washing twice with PBS, cells were counter-stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride for 2 min and mounted on slides. Images were collected on a Optiphot-2 Nikon microscope. p42/44 MAPK and a Second Protein Kinase Target Distinct Domains of HIF-1α—To study the phosphorylation of HIF-1α, we have used as kinase substrate recombinant full-length GST-HIF-1α, the production of which in bacteria was recently reported (24Chachami G. Paraskeva E. Georgatsou E. Bonanou S. Simos G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A incubation of GST-HIF-1α with HeLa cell cytosolic or nuclear extracts in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP resulted in its phosphorylation (lanes 6 and 8). The phosphorylation level was higher in the case of nuclear extract (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 6 and 8) and was specific for the HIF-1α moiety of the fusion protein as GST alone was not detectably phosphorylated (lanes 5 and 7). When extracts from primary rabbit tracheal smooth muscle cells were used, a similar pattern of phosphorylation was observed but the overall level of phosphorylation of GST-HIF-1α was lower (data not shown). Therefore, HeLa cell nuclear extracts were chosen as the kinase source for subsequent experiments. Incubation of GST-HIF-1α with nuclear extract followed by isolation of the fusion protein on GSH-Sepharose beads and incubation with [γ-32P]ATP also resulted in its specific phosphorylation confirming the direct association of HIF-1α with the kinase(s) responsible for its modification (data not shown). To characterize the kinase activity targeting HIF-1α, nuclear extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using gels containing GST-HIF-1α (or GST as control), which was added into the gel mixture prior to its polymerization. After the end of the electrophoresis, the nuclear proteins separated in the gel were subjected to in situ kinase assay, i.e. they were renatured and the gel was incubated in kinase buffer with [γ-32P]ATP, washed, and subjected to autoradiography. Under these conditions, the appearance of a radioactive band in the gel would signify the position of a kinase that can phosphorylate the recombinant protein inside the gel. As shown in Fig. 1B, three bands were detected in the gel containing GST-HIF-1α (but not in the gel with GST only), suggesting that the HIF-1α kinase activity in the HeLa nuclear extracts can be attributed to at least three kinases, with apparent molecular masses of ∼100, 44, and 42 kDa. The two lower Mr bands are reminiscent of the electrophoretic mobility of the p42/44 MAPK, which has been previously shown to be implicated in HIF-1α phosphorylation (18Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). To verify this, we used pure recombinant p42 MAPK. As shown in Fig. 2A, lane 4, p42 MAPK could indeed phosphorylate GST-HIF-1α, whereas no phosphorylation of the GST moiety by p42 MAPK could be detected (data not shown). Furthermore, incubation of GST-HIF-1α with p42 MAPK in the presence of ATP caused the appearance of a slower migrating form of GST-HIF-1α that apparently corresponds to the phosphorylated species (Fig. 2A, lane 2). The shift in the SDS gel mobility, better shown by immunoblotting after analysis on a lower acrylamide percentage gel (Fig. 2B, lane 2), has also been previously demonstrated after phosphorylation of endogenous or in vitro translated HIF-1α (18Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) suggesting that modification of bacterially produced HIF-1α by p42 MAPK reproduces a physiologically relevant event. To further compare the HIF-1α kinase activity present in HeLa nuclear extracts and p42 MAPK, a set of HIF-1α deletion mutants was constructed (Fig. 3A). These mutants were expressed in bacteria as GST fusion proteins, purified (Fig. 3B), and used in parallel with full-length GST-HIF-1α as substrates for phosphorylation by either p42 MAPK or HeLa nuclear extract. As shown in Fig. 3, A and C, the amino- and carboxyl-terminal fragments of HIF-1α (i.e. fragments 1–251 and 652–826) were very poor substrates for p42 MAPK compared with full-length HIF-1α. Fragment 1–530 was also a relatively poor substrate, whereas fragments 1–652 and 348–826 retained most of the capacity of the full-length form to be modified by p42 MAPK. The same fragments were also the best substrates for the kinase activity in the nuclear extract (Fig. 3, A and D). However, in this case also the other fragments, and especially the amino-terminal one, 1–251, exhibited significant phosphorylation levels compared with full-length HIF-1α. Taking all the data into account, the major modification sites by MAPK appear to lie between residues 530 and 652 of HIF-1α, an area containing the TAD-N and part of the ODD and inhibitory domains. On the other hand and assuming that the kinase activity of the nuclear extract toward HIF-1α is roughly the sum of the activities of the p42/44 MAPK and a second unidentified kinase (probably the 100 kDa protein), the latter targets the amino-terminal part of HIF-1α (residues 1–251) comprising the basic helix loop helix and most part of the PAS domain (Fig. 3A). Serine Residues 641 and 643 in the Inhibitory Domain of HIF-1α Are Targeted by p42 MAPK—To map precisely the MAPK phosphorylation sites, recombinant GST-HIF-1α was phosphorylated by recombinant p42 MAPK, subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and the band corresponding to the lower gel mobility modified form of HIF-1α (see Fig. 2) was excised, digested by trypsin, and subjected to analysis with mass spectrometry. Phosphorylation of a protein normally results in a net mass addition of 80 Da to a modified serine, threonine, or tyrosine residue. During fragmentation of a phosphorylated peptide, the loss of the phosphate group as phosphoric acid (H3PO4, 98 Da), is characteristic for peptides containing a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine (28Carr S.A. Annan R.S. Huddleston M.J. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 405: 82-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Phosphoserine becomes converted to dehydroalanine after the loss of H3PO4 (69 Da). Using the procedure outlined under “Experimental Procedures,” we identified a double-charged ion (M + 2H)2+ with a m/z (mass/charge ratio) of 747.4, which corresponded to the peptide ILIASPSPTHIHK, containing a phosphate residue (707.4 + 40). The MS/MS spectrum obtained from that ion was dominated by a double-charged fragment of m/z 698.4, characteristic of a loss of H3PO4 (Fig. 4A). The peptide contains two serine and one threonine residue and any one of them could be phosphorylated. Analysis of MS/MS b′ and y′ fragments or further fragmentation was inconclusive regarding the exact site of phosphorylation, although some evidence was found for both serine sites. For example, the ion with m/z 916.4 (Fig. 4A) represents the y+18 fragment PSPTHIHK, suggesting phosphorylation of Ser-641. On the other hand, the presence of b+15 (m/z 498.6) indicated that Ser-643 could also be phosphorylated. No evidence was found for Thr-645 phosphorylation. These results identified a candidate region for HIF-1α phosphorylation, although it was not possible to determine the relative stoichiometry o"

The complex structure reveals the basis of the broad neutralizing ability of 80R and will facilitate the design of immunotherapeutics in the case of a future SARS outbreak. We further show that the S1-RBD forms dimers by means of an unexpected reorganization of the region distal to the receptor-binding surface. The dimers are disrupted by complex formation, and we discuss the possibility that receptor binding plays an active role in the initial steps of viral uncoating. Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—The gene encoding single chain (VH-linker-VL) antibody 80R (scFv) was cloned into pET22b (Novagen) containing an N-terminal periplasmic secretion signal pelB, and a thrombin-removable C-terminal His6 tag. 80R was overexpressed in BL21(DE3) cells at 30 °C for 15 h with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Protein was purified by HisBind nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Novagen) column and Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) after thrombin digestion. The gene encoding S1-RBD (residues 318-510) was cloned into vector pAcGP67A (Pharmingen) containing an N-terminal gp67 secretion signal and a thrombin-cleavable C-terminal His6 tag. It was expressed in Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) with a multiplicity of infection = 5 for 72 h. Similar to 80R, S1-RBD was purified from the media with HisBind nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid and Superdex 200 columns, with thrombin digestion. N-Linked glycosylation was removed by incubation with peptide:N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) at 23 °C, as monitored by SDS-PAGE. S1 RBD-80R complexes were formed by mixing the two purified components and isolated by gel filtration with Superdex 200 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to ∼7 mg/ml. For S1-RBD crystal growth, the protein was also concentrated to ∼7 mg/ml. Crystals grew by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 17 °C over ∼21 days. For S1-RBD, 2 μl of S1-RBD was mixed with an equal volume of well solution containing 4% w/v polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6. For the S1-RBD-80R complex, 2 μl of the complex was mixed with an equal volume of well solution containing 12.5% w/v polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, pH 4.6. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement— X-ray diffraction data were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X6A and X29A for S1-RBD crystals, the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory beamline 11.1, and at the Advanced Light Source beamlines 5.0.3 and 12.3.1 for crystals of the S1-RBD-80R complex.

The crystals display a lattice-translocation defect in which a fraction of the layers have a translational offset, resulting in periodic sharp and diffuse rows of reflections (Fig. 1). Similar defects were first described by Bragg and Howells (9Bragg W.L. Howells E.R. Acta Crystallogr. 1954; 7: 409-411Crossref Google Scholar). Different crystals displayed different degrees of lattice defects, and data merged poorly between crystals. By using a single crystal we were able to collect a data set of good quality with a final RMERGE = 0.145 and completeness of 93.8% to 2.3 Å resolution. Processing the data required careful optimization of integration profiles and the imposition of a fixed mosaicity (0.45°). Correlation between the offset layers caused the appearance of a strong off-origin peak (65% of the origin) in the native Patterson map at (1/3, 0, 0), indicating that the dislocation occurred along the a* direction. Additional features of the Patterson map were visible at ∼1/10 of the origin peak and provided a measure of the severity of the defect among different crystals. The averaged intensity for the layers of reflections showed a periodic variation that corresponded to the sharp and diffuse layers, and we used the procedure developed by Wang et al. (10Wang J. Kamtekar S. Berman A.J. Steitz T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) to correct for the intensity modulation (Fig. 2). We calculated average intensities for individual h layers, and applied a correction to the intensities using Equation 1, ICOR=IMEAS/(A+B cos(2πhΔx))(Eq. 1) where A and B were obtained by least square fitting of the averaged measured intensities. The ratio of the parameters B and A (B/A = 0.65) coincided with the height ratio of the Patterson peak at (1/3, 0, 0), as required by the lattice-translocation theory presented by Wang. The corrected intensity distribution (Fig. 2b) was used for the structure solution and the refinement.FIGURE 2h layer intensities before and after correction. a, the lattice defect results in a strong-weak-weak pattern of intensities along h, which were corrected (b) according to the procedure of Wang et al.

The asymmetric unit contains two molecules of S1 RBD-80R. The final model includes residues 318-505 (molecule 1) and 319-509 (molecule 2) of S1 RBD and residues 1-245 (molecule 1) and 1-244 (molecule 2) of 80R, and 470 water molecules. No electron density was observed for the artificial poly(Gly/Ser) inter-domain linker. Initial solutions from molecular replacement were subjected to several rounds of refinement with the program REFMAC5 (14Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol.

The structure of uncomplexed S1-RBD (which showed no lattice defects) was determined by molecular replacement with PHASER (13McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) using S1-RBD from the structure of the S1-RBD-ACE2 complex (Protein Data Bank code 2AJF) as the search model. The asymmetric unit contains two molecules of S1-RBD arranged as a symmetric dimer. The final model includes residues 320-503 of both monomers and 152 water molecules. Geometric parameters are excellent as assessed with PRO-CHECK (18Laskowski R.J. MacArthur N.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-290Crossref Google Scholar) (Table 1). Final RWORK/RFREE values are 18.2/21.3 and 24.8/29.5 for the uncomplexed S1-RBD and the S1-RBD-80R complex, respectively. The higher R values for the S1 RBD-80R complex can likely be explained by the limitations of the lattice defect model and the integration of weak, elongated spots, as discussed previously (10Wang J. Kamtekar S. Berman A.J. Steitz T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding, the final electron density map for the S1 RBD-80R complex is of excellent quality (Fig. 3), and the model-to-map correlation is above 0.9 for most of the residues at 2.3 Å resolution. Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with codes 2GHV (S1-RBD) and 2GHW (S1-RBD-80R complex). Structure of the S1-RBD-80R Complex—We determined the crystal structure of the S1-RBD-80R complex at 2.3 Å resolution (Figs. 3 and 4 and Table 1). The S1 RBD has a very similar structure to that in the ACE2 complex (Fig. 4b). The complex interface involves all six antibody complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops, which protrude into the concave surface on the S1 receptor-binding motif. Chothia et al. (19Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Gherardi E. Tomlinson I.M. Walter G. Marks J.D. Llewelyn M.B. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 799-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 20Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Tramontano A.

Nature. 1989; 342: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) showed that there exists only a small repertoire of main chain conformations for 5 of the 6 CDR loops (excluding H3, which is often long and highly variable in structure) and that these structures can be predicted from their amino acid sequences. For the CDR loops of 80R, loops L2, L3, H1, and H2 adopt main chain conformations close to those predicted by Chothia. However, the L1 loop is atypical, although similar to that of the anti-human immunodeficiency virus-gp41 antibody (Protein Data Bank code 1DFB). The H3 loop is short and well ordered. A loop that is classically considered part of the framework (between β-strands D and E) (Fig. 4c and Table 2) also plays a major role in the interface; the “extended loop” (5Li F. Li W. Farzan M. Harrison S.C. Science. 2005; 309: 1864-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar) of S1 wraps around this framework loop making multiple contacts.TABLE 2Contact residues between 80R and S1 RBD 80R residues are listed on the top line and grouped under CDR or framework region (FR). S1 residues in contact with 80R residues are listed in subsequent lines. S1-ACE2 and S1-80R interfaces share many common S1 residues, except for 5 residues (404, 443, 460, 462, and 463) which are found only at the S1-ACE2 interface, while 12 residues (433, 437, 439, 469, 470, 471, 474, 476, 478, 480, 485, and 492) are found only at the S1-80R interface. Open table in a new tab Although ACE2 employs a different recognition mode (dominated by a helix that lines the concave surface of S1), the 80R epitope on S1 overlaps very closely with the ACE2-binding surface (Fig. 4b). Thus, of the 29 residues (between 426 and 492) on S1 that contact 80R, 17 of these also make interactions in the S1-ACE2 interface. The S1-80R interface buries ∼2200 Å2 of protein surface, compared with ∼1700 Å2 for S1-ACE2. The “gap volume,” a measure of shape complementarity (21Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar), is ∼4000 Å3 for the S1-80R interface, about half that of S1-ACE2 (∼7000 Å3). The larger buried surface and smaller gap volume provide a rationale for the stronger binding and neutralizing activity of the antibody. The structure provides a rationale for previous mutagenesis studies. Thus, residue Asn479 is involved in both interfaces, and accordingly, mutations decrease both 80R binding and ACE2 binding (2-10-fold (7Sui J. Li W. Roberts A. Matthews L.J. Murakami A. Vogel L. Wong S.K. Subbarao K. Farzan M. Marasco W.A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 5900-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 22Li W. Zhang C. Sui J. Kuhn J.H. Moore M.J. Luo S. Wong S.K. Huang I.C. Xu K. Vasilieva N. Murakami A. He Y. Marasco W.A. Guan Y. Choe H. Farzan M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1634-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar)). Two further mutational sites that reduce antibody binding, at Asp454 and Glu452, are not directly involved in the interface; their effect can be explained by the participation of these acidic residues in a salt bridge network that anchors the receptor/antibody binding interface to the S1 RBD core and the extended loop that wraps around the frame-work hairpin (Fig. 4c). One key difference between the two interfaces lies in the role of S1 residue Asp480; thus, D480A or D480G mutations completely abolish binding to 80R but have no effect on ACE2 binding (7Sui J. Li W. Roberts A. Matthews L.J. Murakami A. Vogel L. Wong S.K. Subbarao K. Farzan M. Marasco W.A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 5900-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Consistently, Asp480 lies at the heart of the S1-80R interface, making an intermolecular salt bridge to Arg162 (see supplemental Fig. 1) and an H-bond to Asn164 of 80R, where as Asp480 makes no contacts in the S1-ACE2 complex. Binding of S1 RBD to either ACE2 or 80R is independent of glycosylation (6Sui J. Li W. Murakami A. Tamin A. Matthews L.J. Wong S.K. Moore M.J. Tallarico A.S. Olurinde M. Choe H. Anderson L.J.

Structure of the Uncomplexed S1-RBD—We also determined the crystal structure of the uncomplexed S1-RBD (residues 318-510) at 2.2 Å resolution (Figs. 5 and 6 and Table 1). Compared with its structure in complex with either 80R or ACE2, the receptor-binding surface, including the extended loop, is essentially identical to its structure in the complexes. However, there are extensive rearrangements and increased ordering of the region distal to the 80R/ACE2-binding surface (Fig. 5), which lead to the formation of an extensive dimer interface with a buried surface area of ∼2200 Å2 (Fig. 6). The major reorganization occurs in three structural elements (secondary structure nomenclature as in Ref. 5Li F. Li W. Farzan M. Harrison S.C. Science. 2005; 309: 1864-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar) as follows: (i) the loop between strands 2 and 3 containing helix B reorganizes such that the new helix B is one turn longer and lies orthogonal to its position in the complexed structures; (ii) helix B from the neighboring monomer packs tightly across the dimer interface, causing helix A to shift by 10-12 Å to a new position adjacent to the C terminus; and (iii) the C terminus also undergoes a small concerted shift (∼4 Å). The dimer is formed by the pairing of the β-sheets (via their β2-strands) and B-helices from each monomer and is largely hydrophobic in nature.FIGURE 6Structure of the S1-RBD dimer. a, S1 monomers are in red and blue, related by a vertical 2-fold axis. The receptor binding surfaces and C termini are indicated. b, same as in a but rotated by 90° about a horizontal axis to show the molecular dyad. c, hypothetical model of the S1-RBD dimer with two molecules of ACE2 bound, showing steric overlap (circled). The view is rotated about a vertical axis compared with a in order to minimize the overlap in projection. Two Fab fragments can bind the dimer without steric hindrance (not shown). A full-length dimeric antibody could presumably cross-link neighboring dimers on the viral surface, but the geometry is inappropriate for binding both sites on a single dimer simultaneously.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This dimer is predicted by the DCOMPLEX server to be physiologically relevant and to have a binding energy comparable with the S1-80R and S1-ACE2 binary complexes. In agreement with the structural data, gel filtration studies of S1 RBD indicate a monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution at micromolar concentrations (data not shown). Of note, it has been reported that the murine hepatitis corona-virus S1 domain also exists as a stable dimer (25Lewicki D.N. Gallagher T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19727-19734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The C termini of S1 RBD lie on the “lower” surface of the dimers (Fig. 6a), topologically consistent with their connection to the membrane-spanning S2 domain. At the lower surface of the dimer interface, two cysteine residues, from apposing B-helices (Cys378), come into close proximity (Sγ-Sγ distance = 3.2 Å) but do not form a disulfide bond. We propose a model in which the S1 dimers present two preformed receptor-binding motifs pointing outward from the viral membrane surface. A plausible role for the S1 dimers is to cross-link S protein trimers (which trimerize via their S2 domains) on the viral surface (26Lin Y. Yan X. Cao W. Wang C. Feng J. Duan J. Xie S. Antivir. Ther. 2004; 9: 287-289PubMed Google Scholar), thus contributing to the structural integrity of the virion. Modeling two ACE2 receptors onto the S1 dimer leads to steric clashes between the receptors (Fig. 6c), which could explain why S1 is monomeric in crystals of the S1-ACE2 complex. Interestingly, in the S1-80R complex, S1 dimers still form, and in this case the two Cys378 residues remain in close apposition. However, the monomers are twisted with respect to their positions in the uncomplexed S1 dimers, and the hydrophobic interface is largely disrupted. In silico modeling of two 80R fragments onto the uncomplexed S1 dimer does not lead to steric clashes, and in this case the dimer rearrangement is presumably driven by competing lattice forces. These observations raise the intriguing hypothesis that binding of multiple receptors in vivo promotes disruption of S protein dimers, perhaps in a redox-dependent fashion, thus priming S for subsequent membrane fusion events mediated by the S2 domains. A role for receptor-promoted viral uncoating is well established in the (nonenveloped) picornaviruses (27Nurani G. Lindqvist B. Casasnovas J.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11985-11991Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and has also been described for the Env protein of avian leukosis virus (28Mothes W. Boerger A.L. Narayan S. Cunningham J.M. Young J.A. Cell. 2000; 103: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Clearly, further experiments are required to explore this hypothesis. Prospects for Immune Therapy—Marasco and co-workers (22Li W. Zhang C. Sui J. Kuhn J.H. Moore M.J. Luo S. Wong S.K. Huang I.C. Xu K. Vasilieva N. Murakami A. He Y. Marasco W.A. Guan Y. Choe H.

Because the 80R epitope on S1 overlaps so closely with the ACE2-binding site, we suggest that, for most residues on S1 at the binding site, antigenic drift on S that makes 80R ineffective is likely to abolish binding to ACE2 as well. A notable exception is the D480G mutation, which was found in the SARS-like CoVs from civet cats during the 2003-2004 winter season. These CoVs were likely responsible for an independent interspecies transmission that resulted in the infection of four patients in a mini 2003-2004 outbreak (23Song H.D. Tu C.C. Zhang G.W. Wang S.Y. Zheng K. Lei L.C. Chen Q.X. Gao Y.W. Zhou H.Q. Xiang H. Zheng H.J. Chern S.W. Cheng F. Pan C.M. Xuan H. Chen S.J. Luo H.M. Zhou D.H. Liu Y.F. He J.F. Qin P.Z. Li L.H. Ren Y.Q. Liang W.J. Yu Y.D.

A. 2005; 102: 2430-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The 80R antibody does not bind these mutants, as noted above; however, these viruses were also less pathogenic, and no cases of human-to-human transmission were reported. By establishing the susceptibility and resistance profiles of newly emerging SARS-CoVs through early S1 genotyping of the neutralizing epitope of 80R, which we have now mapped in atomic detail, an effective immunotherapeutic strategy with 80R should be possible in a future SARS outbreak. In this setting, administration of 80R IgG would provide immediate protection for individuals; subsequently, the innate immune response would take effect, resulting in reduced virus titers and “superspreader” events, crucial for effective containment of the disease.

https://openalex.org/W1974069439,"In sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC), KRAS are alternative to BRAF mutations and occur, respectively, in 30 and 10% of cases. Few reports addressed the association between KRAS-BRAF mutations and tumour progression specifically in sporadic microsatellite-stable (MSS) CRC. We screened KRAS and BRAF in 250 MSS primary CRC and 45 lymph node (LN) metastases and analysed the pathological features of the cases to understand the involvement of KRAS-BRAF activation in progression and metastasis. Forty-five per cent of primary MSS CRCs carried mutations in at least one of these genes and mutations were associated with wall invasion (P=0.02), presence and number of LN metastases (P=0.02 and P=0.03, respectively), distant metastases (P=0.004) and advanced stage (P=0.01). We demonstrated that KRAS and BRAF are alternative events in Tis and T1 MSS CRC and, KRAS rather than BRAF mutations, contributed to the progression of MSS CRC. The frequency of KRAS and/or BRAF mutations was higher in LN metastases than in primary carcinomas (P=0.0002). Mutated LN metastases displayed KRAS associated or not with BRAF mutations. BRAF mutations were never present as a single event. Concomitant KRAS and BRAF mutations increased along progression of MSS CRCs, suggesting that activation of both genes is likely to harbour a synergistic effect."
https://openalex.org/W2059699662,"A complex involving Derlin-1 and p97 mediates the retrotranslocation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation of misfolded proteins in yeast and is used by certain viruses to promote host cell protein degradation (Romisch, K. (2005) <i>Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol.</i> 21, 435-456; Lilley, B. N., and Ploegh, H. L. (2004) <i>Nature</i> 429, 834-840; Ye, Y., Shibata, Y., Yun, C., Ron, D., and Rapoport, T. A. (2004) <i>Nature</i> 429, 841-847). We asked whether the components of this pathway are involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of the mammalian integral membrane protein, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a substrate for the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We report that Derlin-1 and p97 formed complexes with CFTR in human airway epithelial cells. Derlin-1 interacted with nonubiquitylated CFTR, whereas p97 associated with ubiquitylated CFTR. Exogenous expression of Derlin-1 led to its co-localization with CFTR in the ER where it reduced wild type (WT) CFTR expression and efficiently degraded the disease-associated CFTR folding mutants, ΔF508 and G85E (>90%). Consistent with this, Derlin-1 also reduced the amount of WT or ΔF508 CFTR appearing in detergent-in-soluble aggregates. An ∼70% knockdown of endogenous Derlin-1 by RNA interference increased the steady-state levels of WT and ΔF508 CFTR by 10-15-fold, reflecting its significant role in CFTR degradation. Derlin-1 mediated the degradation of N-terminal CFTR fragments corresponding to the first transmembrane domain of CFTR, but CFTR fragments that incorporated additional domains were degraded less efficiently. These findings suggest that Derlin-1 recognizes misfolded, nonubiquitylated CFTR to initiate its dislocation and degradation early in the course of CFTR biogenesis, perhaps by detecting structural instability within the first transmembrane domain."

However, the peripheral mechanism(s) by which this phenomenon occurs remains an issue that has yet to be resolved. Because phosphorylation of TRPV1 (transient receptor potential subtype V1) plays a key role in the induction of thermal hyperalgesia in inflammatory pain models, we evaluated whether the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) regulates the phosphorylation state of TRPV1. Here, we show that treatment of primary rat trigeminal ganglion cultures with WIN led to dephosphorylation of TRPV1, specifically at threonine residues. Utilizing Chinese hamster ovary cell lines, we demonstrate that Thr144 and Thr370 were dephosphorylated, leading to desensitization of the TRPV1 receptor. This post-translational modification occurred through activation of the phosphatase calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B) following WIN treatment. Furthermore, knockdown of TRPA1 (transient receptor potential subtype A1) expression in sensory neurons by specific small interfering RNA abolished the WIN effect on TRPV1 dephosphorylation, suggesting that WIN acts through TRPA1. We also confirm the importance of TRPA1 in WIN-induced dephosphorylation of TRPV1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells through targeted expression of one or both receptor channels. These results imply that the cannabinoid WIN modulates the sensitivity of sensory neurons to TRPV1 activation by altering receptor phosphorylation.

Coincidently, calcium-dependent sensitization of the receptor can also occur through activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (28Jung J. Shin J.S. Lee S.Y. Hwang S.W. Koo J. Cho H. Oh U. J.

The balance between calcium-stimulated kinase and phosphatase activities results in a tightly regulated system responsible for modulating TRPV1 activity.In this study, we examined whether certain cannabinoids can regulate the phosphorylation state of TRPV1, resulting in modulation of receptor activities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that treatment with the cannabinoid WIN results not only in calcineurin activation and dephosphorylation of the TRPV1 receptor at Thr144 and Thr370, but does so in a manner dependent upon TRPA1 coexpression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection of cDNA—Trigeminal ganglia were removed bilaterally from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) and dissociated by treatment with collagenase (Worthington) for 30 min, followed by treatment with trypsin (Sigma) for 15 min and DNase I (Roche Applied Science) for 5 min.

To create rat TRPV1(T370A), the forward primer used was 5′-CCAGGAAGTTCGCCGAATGGGCCTATGGG. To create rat TRPV1(T704A), the forward primer used was 5′-GCAGAGAGCCATCGCCATCCTGGATACAG. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing at the Advanced Nucleic Acids Core Facility of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—For each experimental condition, cells were treated with the appropriate compounds and harvested as described previously (31Jeske N.A. Glucksman M.J. Roberts J.L. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Protein determination was completed using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) as recommended by the manufacturer. For radioactivity experiments, 10-cm plates of trigeminal ganglia were incubated with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 6-cm plates of CHO cells were incubated with 125 μCi for 4 h at 37°C in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Following harvesting, cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-TRPV1 antiserum (Ab-2, Calbiochem), resolved on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to polyvinyl difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Western blots were either exposed overnight to film at -80 °C for autoradiography or blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 and visualized using anti-TRPV1 (Ab-1, Calbiochem), anti-phosphoserine (Calbiochem), or anti-phosphothreonine (Calbiochem) antibody, followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antisera and enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer's instructions.Other antibodies used in these experiments included rabbit anti-TRPA1 polyclonal antibody, which recognizes an N-terminal epitope (COOH-KRSLRRVLRPEERKE), and anti-FKBP12 antibody (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO). Fig. 1 (A-G) illustrates the specificities of the anti-TRPV1 and anti-TRPA1 antibodies used.Autoradiography and Western blot results were scanned and quantified using NIH Image Version 1.62. Background optical densities were subtracted from band densities to calculate accurate optical measurements of band intensity. All autoradiographic and phospho-specific bands were normalized to values obtained from total immunoprecipitated TRPV1. Results are representative of three to five independent experiments, and statistical significance was determined using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or a paired t test as appropriate.Electrophysiology—All recordings were made in a perforated patch voltage-clamp configuration at a holding potential of -60 mV. Recordings were carried out at 22-24 °C from transiently transfected CHO cells (48 h post-transfection) using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pCLAMP 9.0 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Cells were transfected with the indicated cDNAs along with the pEGFP-N1 vector for identification of channel-expressing cells. Data were filtered at 0.5 kHz, and samples were filtered at 2 kHz. Borosilicate pipettes (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) were polished to resistances of 4-7 megaohms in perforated patch pipette solution. If necessary, access resistance was compensated by 40-80% to 10-15 megaohms.All recordings are made in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+ in external solution. Standard external solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The pipette solution for the perforated patch consisted of 110 mm potassium methanesulfonate, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), and 250 μg/ml amphotericin B (Sigma). Drugs were applied using a computer-controlled pressure-driven eight-channel system (ValveLink8, AutoMate Scientific, Inc, San Francisco, CA).Ca2+ and Fluorescence Imaging in TG Neurons—To measure intracellular Ca2+ levels, the dye Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (2 μm; Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) was loaded for 30 min at 37 °C into cells in the presence of 0.05% PLURONIC F-127 (Calbiochem). Fluorescence was detected with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope fitted with a ×40/1.30 numerical aperture Fluor objective. Fluorescence images from excitation wavelengths were collected and analyzed with MetaFluor software (MetaMorph imaging system, Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). The net change in Ca2+ was calculated by subtracting the basal Ca2+ level (mean value collected for 60 s prior to agonist addition) from the peak Ca2+ level achieved after exposure to the agonists. Ratiometric data were converted to [Ca2+]i (in micromolar) using the following equation: [Ca2+]i = K*(R - Rmin)/(Rmax - R), where R is the 340/380 nm fluorescence ratio. Rmin, Rmax, and K* (0.1, 1.6, and 0.65 μm, respectively) were measured according to a previously described method (32Gamper N. Shapiro M.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).Calcineurin Activity Assay—Cultured TG neurons (BIOMOL International, L.P., Plymouth Meeting, PA) were grown for 5 days and harvested following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were rinsed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C and harvested in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were gently triturated via 10 passes through a 20-gauge needle and lysed via three freeze/thaw cycles (45 s of liquid N2 and 45 s of a 30 °C water bath). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × g to remove nuclei and unlysed cells. The ensuing supernatant was retained, and protein determination was completed using the Bradford assay. Lysates were purged of free phosphates by gel filtration, and calcineurin dephosphorylation of RII phosphopeptide substrate (BIOMOL International, L.P.) was monitored colorimetrically (A620 nm) on a Versa Max microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection—siRNAs directed against rat TRPA1 (A-1, GGAACUGCAUACCAACUUdTdT, sense) and Drosophila TRPA1 (Adr-1, GCAAUGUCATCGAUAUUCAdTdT, sense) were custom-synthesized by Dharmacon RNA Technologies (Chicago, IL). Silencer negative control 1 siRNA (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) was used as the scrambled negative control. For transfection, 20 μl of HiPer-Fect transfection reagent (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and 625 ng of siRNA were combined in nutrient mixture F12 (Invitrogen) and incubated at 25 °C for 15 min. TG neurons were cleared of all cell debris and incubated overnight with siRNA/HiPerFect/nutrient mixture F-12 at 37 °C. Post-transfection, TG neurons were moved to normal medium (see above) and incubated as described above. This procedure was conducted twice (on days 2 and 4, with cells collected on day 6 for experimental procedures).Immunocytochemistry—Cultured TG cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips for 5-7 days in normal medium. Coverslips were rinsed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 25 °C. Following fixation, coverslips were rinsed twice with PBS and incubated with 5% normal goat serum and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at 25 °C. Coverslips were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with antisera directed specifically toward FKBP12 (1:500 dilution) and guinea pig TRPV1 (1:500 dilution; Neuromics, Edina, MN). Coverslips were then rinsed three times and incubated for 1 h at 25°C with the appropriate secondary antibodies (TRITC-labeled, 1:250 dilution; fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled, 1:250 dilution). Following rinsing three times with PBS, coverslips were attached to microscope slides and dried overnight. For double-label immunofluorescence, coverslipped images were acquired using a ×40 objective lens mated to a Nikon E600 microscope equipped with a Photometrics SenSys digital CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Inc., Tucson, AZ) connected to a computer equipped with Metamorph Version 4.1 image analysis software.Mass Spectrometry—Immunoprecipitated TRPV1 was resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were stained with Coomassie Blue. The band of interest was excised and digested in situ with trypsin (modified; Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The resulting digests were subjected to capillary HPLC/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry on a Thermo Electron LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer used with an Eksigent NanoLC-2D micro-HPLC system. On-line capillary HPLC separation of the tryptic peptides was accomplished under the following conditions: PicoFrit™ column (75-μm inner diameter; New Objective, Inc.) packed to 10 cm with C18 adsorbent (218MSB5, 5 μm, 300 Å; Vydac); mobile phase A, 0.5% acetic acid and 0.005% trifluoroacetic acid; mobile phase B, 90% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid, and 0.005% trifluoroacetic acid; linear gradient of 2-72% mobile phase B over 30 min; and flow rate of 0.4 μl/min. A data-dependent acquisition protocol was employed in which the seven most intense ions in a survey scan were sequentially fragmented in the ion trap by collision-induced dissociation using an isolation width of 3.0 and a relative collision energy of 35%. Uninterpreted tandem mass spectra were analyzed by Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK). Further assessment of probabilities of protein identification was performed using Scaffold (Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR). The probability of identification of rat TRPV1 (GenBank™ accession number AF029310) by cross-correlation of the search results from Mascot and X! Tandem was 100% (13 unique peptides, 55% sequence coverage), as shown in Fig. 1H. Mass spectrometric analyses were carried out in the Mass Spectrometry Laboratory of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.RESULTSCannabinoids Dephosphorylate Threonine Residues of TRPV1 in TG Neurons—The cannabinoids ACEA, anandamide, and WIN were evaluated in this individual study because all have been shown to result in significant peripheral anti-hyperalgesia and/or antinociception (3Li J.

Nature. 2000; 405: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar), it is hypothesized that certain cannabinoids may affect TRPV1 phosphorylation, which is known to regulate channel activity (22Cesare P.

To test this hypothesis, we examined the phosphorylation status of the TRPV1 receptor immunoprecipitated from TG neurons following cannabinoid treatments.Cultured TG neurons were loaded with [32P]orthophosphate and then treated with cannabinoids for 10 min to analyze receptor incorporation of phosphate groups. Fig. 2A illustrates a significant reduction in [32P]phospho labeling of the immunoprecipitated TRPV1 receptor following treatment with ACEA (25 μm), anandamide (25 μm), or WIN (25 μm) in comparison with treatment with vehicle. ACEA, anandamide, and WIN treatment led to 20.1 ± 3.8, 30.1 ± 7.6, and 27.2 ± 6.5% reductions (p < 0.05; n = 3) in TRPV1 phosphorylation, respectively, compared with vehicle treatment. It is important to note that the concentrations of cannabinoids used in these experiments were between 1000- and 10,000-fold higher than those concentrations initially characterized to activate the cannabinoid G-protein-coupled receptors CB1 and CB2 (37Kuster J.E.

Both serine and threonine residues have been reported as potential phosphorylation sites for various kinases that serve to regulate channel activity via post-translational modifications of the TRPV1 receptor channel (25Mohapatra D.P.

https://openalex.org/W2031269596,"A growing body of evidence indicates that phytooxylipins play important roles in plant defense responses. However, many enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of these metabolites are still elusive. We have purified one of these enzymes, the peroxygenase (PX4450), from oat microsomes and lipid droplets. It is an integral membrane protein requiring detergent for its solubilization. Proteinase K digestion showed that PXG is probably deeply buried in lipid droplets or microsomes with only about 2 kDa at the C-terminal region accessible to proteolytic digestion. Sequencing of the N terminus of the purified protein showed that PXG had no sequence similarity with either a peroxidase or a cytochrome P450 but, rather, with caleosins, i.e. calcium-binding proteins. In agreement with this finding, we demonstrated that recombinant thale cress and rice caleosins, expressed in yeast, catalyze hydroperoxide-dependent mono-oxygenation reactions that are characteristic of PXG. Calcium was also found to be crucial for peroxygenase activity, whereas phosphorylation of the protein had no impact on catalysis. Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that PXG catalytic activity is dependent on two highly conserved histidines, the 9 GHz EPR spectrum being consistent with a high spin pentacoordinated ferric heme.

Plant peroxygenase (PXG) 3The abbreviations used are: PXG, peroxygenase; LD, lipid droplet; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; 13-HPOD, 13-hydroperoxyoctadeca-9,11-dienoic acid; AIF-1, allographt inflammatory factor-1. is a versatile oxygenase that is strictly hydroperoxide-dependent for its activity. First discovered as an hydroxylase (1Ishimaru A. Yamazaki I. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6118-6124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been subsequently identified as a sulfoxidase (2Blée E. Durst F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 254: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and an epoxidase (3Blée E. Schuber F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12887-12894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hamberg M. Hamberg G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). But detailed studies have revealed that only a single mechanism accounted for these different activities. In brief, peroxygenase catalyzes the direct transfer of one oxygen atom from a hydroperoxide, which is reduced into its corresponding alcohol to a substrate which will be oxidized (5Blée E. Wilcox A.L. Marnett L.J. Schuber F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1708-1715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, peroxygenase catalyzes hydroxylation reactions of aromatics, sulfoxidations of xenobiotics, or epoxidations of unsaturated fatty acids (Fig. 1). In mammals, most of these reactions are performed by cytochrome P450 monoxygenases. But it was shown that in contrast to such enzymes, PXG activity does not require any cofactor such as NAD(P)H and does not use molecular oxygen, excluding that PXG is encoded by a classical P450 monooxygenase (1Ishimaru A. Yamazaki I. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6118-6124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Blée E. Schuber F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12887-12894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Presently, the function of PXG is not fully established. Associated with epoxide hydrolase, it composes “the peroxygenase pathway,” which is involved in the oleic acid cascade leading to the synthesis of the C18 cutin monomers (6Blée E. Schuber F. Plant J. 1993; 4: 113-123Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 7Lequeu J. Fauconnier M.-L. Chammaï A. Bronner R. Blée E. Plant J. 2003; 36: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, PXG was also found to be very active in microsomes of plants such as soybean that possess cuticles poor in these C18 cutin precursors, therefore suggesting additional physiological role(s) for this enzyme (7Lequeu J. Fauconnier M.-L. Chammaï A. Bronner R. Blée E. Plant J. 2003; 36: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been suggested that the peroxygenase pathway also leads to the formation of epoxy- and trihydroxy derivatives of linoleic acid (8Hamberg M. Hamberg G. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 807-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Blée E. Piazza G.J. Lipoxygenase and Lipoxygenase Pathway Enzymes. AOCS Press, Champaign, IL1996: 138-161Crossref Google Scholar), which are involved in defense responses against fungal infection in rice or tomato (10Ohta H. Shida K. Peng Y.-L. Furusawa I. Shishiyama J. Aibara S. Morita Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1990; 31: 1117-1122Google Scholar, 11Kato T. Yamaguchi Y. Namai T. Hirukawa T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1993; 57: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12Namai T. Kato T. Yamaguchi Y. Hirukawa T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1993; 57: 611-613Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The peroxygenase pathway also constitutes one branch of the so-called “lipoxygenase pathway,” where, as the first step, lipoxygenase catalyzes oxygenation of unsaturated fatty acids (C18:2, C18:3, or C16:3), yielding the corresponding fatty acids hydroperoxides. These very reactive compounds are then transformed to a series of oxylipins involved in plant defense by several enzymes, among which allene oxide synthase and fatty acid hydroperoxide lyase have been best characterized (13Blée E. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 315-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The cloning of genes encoding some of these hydroperoxide-transforming enzymes has revealed that they so far all belong to a new family of unusual cytochromes P450s referred to as CYP74. They differ from the classical P450s by their exclusive reaction with fatty acid hydroperoxides instead of using molecular oxygen and reductants. To date, research in the oxylipins field has largely focused on two specific branches of the lipoxygenase pathway, namely those involving CYP74A (allene oxide synthase) and CYP74B (hydroperoxide lyase), which result in the production of jasmonates and volatile aldehydes, respectively. In contrast, little is known at the molecular level on the enzymes involved in the other branches of the lipoxygenase pathway. Although the molecular mechanism of the peroxygenase is now better defined, the gene encoding this protein and the nature of the gene product are still unknown. Thus, one primary goal of the present investigation was to identify the PXG gene and to compare the encoded protein with other oxygenases such as cytochromes P450 and peroxidases. Although PXG activities have been detected in a wide variety of plants, previous efforts to purify this enzyme to homogeneity or to clone its encoding gene were unsuccessful. PXG shares some features with CYP74s, i.e. they are both membrane-bound hemoproteins that accept fatty acid hydroperoxides as substrates. Therefore, we have first assumed that PXG was a new member of the CYP74 family. But all of our attempts to clone the gene encoding the peroxygenase by sequence similarity with CYP74 members failed. Therefore, we purified the peroxygenase from oat seeds, sequenced the N terminus, identified Arabidopsis homologues by data base screening, expressed the corresponding genes in yeast, and demonstrated that PXG was a distinct and atypical oxygenase. In contrast to all other oxygenases involved in the oxylipin pathway, it belongs to a small family of proteins, known as “caleosins” (14Chen E.C. Tai S.S. Peng C.C. Tzen J.T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These proteins contain a Ca2+ binding motif and several phosphorylation sites that could be important for activity and regulation of PXG. This enzyme was present in the endoplasmic reticulum but also in lipid bodies that we will here refer to as lipid droplets (LDs) in accordance with a recently suggested nomenclature (15Martin S. Parton R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). They are small vesicles composed of a core of lipids surrounded by a half-unit membrane of phospholipids and some proteins embedded therein (16Murphy D.J. Vence J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The apparent dual localization of PXG raised the question of the mode of integration of intrinsic membrane proteins into bi- or monolayer phospholipid structures. Importantly, the identification of PXG as a caleosin also opens new perspectives for possible physiological roles of this type of proteins, which had no function identified to date. Materials—Commonly used chemicals and reagents were of the highest purity available. Purified oligonucleotides were provided either by Invitrogen, Eurogentec, or by Sigma Genosys. [1-14C]Oleic acid (52 Ci/mol) and [1-14C]linoleic acid (55 Ci/mol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Rice seeds (Oryza sativa, var. indica, cv. IR64) soaked for 2 h in water were germinated on two layers of cloth saturated with water under a photoperiod of 16 h. Plants were harvested 7 days later, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at –80 °C until use. Preparation of Oat Subcellular Fractions—Isolation of microsomal fraction from oat seeds soaked overnight in water was performed essentially as described previously for soybean seedlings (3Blée E. Schuber F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12887-12894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During this procedure (after the second centrifugation step at 100,000 × g) a floating layer consisting of lipid droplets was collected from the top of the tubes with a pipette. The crude lipid droplet fraction was carefully washed with 100 mm potassium pyrophosphate buffer that contained 0.1 m sucrose (pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min, the lipid droplet fraction was then resuspended in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 0.1 m sucrose (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. LDs were finally resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 10% glycerol (pH 8). Purification of Oat Peroxygenase—All the subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Washed microsomes or LDs (30 mg protein) resuspended in 5 ml of a 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 10% glycerol (buffer A) were treated with emulphogene (polyoxyethylene 10 tridecyl ether from Sigma, final concentration 0.2% v/v) for 45 min. The mixture was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was applied to a 1 × 2-cm column of DEAE-Trisacryl M (BioSepra) equilibrated with buffer B (buffer A containing 0.2% emulphogene (v/v)). After the column was washed with buffer B to eliminate the first protein peak, peroxygenase activity was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0→ 1 m) in buffer B (2 × 30 ml). The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and 5 ml fractions were collected. The fractions containing the peak of peroxygenase were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 2 × 2 liters of 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) containing 10% glycerol and 0.2% (v/v) emulphogene (buffer C). The dialyzed fraction was applied on a 1 × 10-cm column of CM-Sepharose CL-6B (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer C. After the column was washed with buffer C, peroxygenase activity was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0 → 1 m) in buffer C (2 × 30 ml). The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and 5 ml fractions were collected. This purification protocol was repeated three times to isolate sufficient amounts of protein. The fractions containing the peak of peroxygenase activity were pooled and dialyzed overnight against buffer C and applied on a column of CM-Sepharose CL-6B. Peroxygenase activity was eluted as described above. The total amount of proteins was measured after each purification step by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Subcloning of AtPXG1, AtPXG2, and OsPXG—Full-length AtPXG1 (At4g26740) and AtPXG2 (At5g55240) were amplified from an Arabidopsis cDNA library by PCR using primers AtPXG1F and AtPXG1R and primers AtPXG2F and AtPXG2R, respectively (Table 1). To facilitated cloning, BamHI or XbaI restriction sites were attached to the primers. For the further purification of AtPXG1, PCR was performed using primers AtPXG1NHis and AtPXG1CHis to add a His tag at either the N- or C-terminal ends of the PXG gene. We used also PCR for adding the FLAG epitope at the C terminus of AtPXG1. The amplified products were first cloned into the pCR®2.1-TOPO vector (TOPO TA cloning® kit, Invitrogen) and, after sequencing, subcloned into the yeast constitutive expression vector pVT102U (17Verner T.

First strand cDNA was synthesized by incubation of mRNA (3 μg) with 5 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and oligo(dT)24 at 37°C for 2 h in a 50-μl reaction volume. The cDNA (5 μl) was subsequently amplified by PCR in a 50-μl reaction volume using 25 μl of HIFI PCR Master (Roche Applied Science) and 400 nm gene-specific primers OsPXGF and OsPXGR. The amplicon was subcloned as described above. Expression and Purification of Recombinant PXGs—The addition of His or FLAG tags either at the N or C terminus did not modify the catalytic activity of the resulting enzyme. Therefore, we used recombinant enzymes with tags added to their C terminus. His-tagged or Flag-tagged AtPXG1, AtPXG2, and OsPXG were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Wa6 (ade, his7-2 leu2-3 leu2-112 ura3-52) (18Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). Expression of the recombinant PXGs in transformed yeast cells was carried out as follows. 6 ml of S medium (7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base, 1 g/liter casamino acids, 20 g/liter glucose supplemented with 50 μg/ml histidine, 200 μg/ml adenine, and 50 μg/ml leucine) was inoculated with recombinant yeast and grown for 2 days with shaking at 30 °C. Then 1-ml portions were used to inoculate six 250-ml cultures of S medium. After 2 days, the resulting cultures were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g, and the cells were washed with 200 ml of buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)). The pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of buffer D containing 0.6 m sorbitol, and the yeast cells were disrupted with glass beads. The resulting lysate was centrifuged once at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was recovered and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The pellet was finally resuspended in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8) containing 10% glycerol (v/v) and treated with emulphogene (final concentration, 0.2%) for 45 min at 4 °C. The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h. His-tagged PXG or FLAG-tagged PXGs present in the supernatant were purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen) or on a FLAG affinity gel (Sigma), respectively, using procedures recommended by the manufacturer. Such purifications were carried out at 4 °C in the presence of 10% glycerol and 0.2% emulphogene (v/v). The purity of the samples was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Enzymatic Activities—Peroxygenase activity was routinely measured (e.g. during the purification procedure) with aniline as substrate (2Blée E. Durst F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 254: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Sulfoxidase activity was assayed by using either methyl p-tolyl sulfoxide or thiobenzamide as substrates, as previously described (19Blée E. Durst F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 922-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 20Blée E. Schuber F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4962-4967Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Epoxidation of [1-14C]oleic and linoleic acids was performed according to Blée and Schuber (3Blée E. Schuber F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12887-12894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The metabolism of 13-hydroperoxy-[1-14C]octadecadienoic acid was studied as described before (5Blée E. Wilcox A.L. Marnett L.J. Schuber F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1708-1715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit of Stratagene with the sense mutations primers described in the PCR primers sections (modified codons are underlined, and the nucleotide changes are indicated in bold in Table 1). Heme Content Determination—The heme staining procedure was carried according to Noordermeer et al. (21Noordermeer M.A. van Dijken A.J.H. Smeekens S.C.M. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2473-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Hemin (from Sigma) was used as standard for the quantification of heme at 370 nm. Oat Antibodies and Western Blot Analysis—The production of rabbit polyclonal antibodies was performed using standard immunization protocols. Proteins were fractionated by 15% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using a mini-transblot transfer cell apparatus (Bio-Rad). High precision Protein™ Standards (Bio-Rad) were used as molecular weight markers. For detection of AtPXG:His, a mouse monoclonal anti-His antibody and an anti-mouse antibody conjugated to peroxidase were used at 1:500 and 1:5000 dilutions, respectively. Blots were developed using the ECL kit from Pierce. N-terminal Sequencing of PXGs—After separation by SDS-PAGE using a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Edman degradation was performed with an automated sequenator (Applied Biosystems 492 Procise). Proteolysis—Microsomes were washed in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 10 mm CaCl2 and resuspended in an equal volume of this buffer. Aliquots of microsomes (100 μl containing 1.5 mg proteins) were incubated with increased quantities of proteinase K (from 15 to 750 μg) in a total volume of 175 μl at 37 °C overnight. Aliquots of 50 μl were removed for immediate measure of PXG residual activity. The proteinase was then inhibited by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. A similar protocol was used for proteinase K treatment of LDs. Phosphorylation Experiments—Proteinase-treated microsomes were incubated in the presence of 0.1 unit of casein kinase II and 4 μCi of [γ-35S]ATP in 100 mm KH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.5) containing 8 mm MgCl2 for 4 h at 27 °C. Proteins and peptides separated by SDS/PAGE were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immuno- and radio-detections. Similar protocol was used for the phosphorylation of purified AtPXG1 except that this fraction was incubated for 1 h at 4°C to preserve enzymatic activity. Synthesis of Radiolabeled Substrates—Racemic 9,10-[1-14C]epoxystearic acid (1.9 GBq/mmol) and 13(S)-[1-14C]hydroperoxyoctadeca-9(Z),11(E)-dienoic acid were synthesized as previously described (3Blée E. Schuber F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12887-12894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectroscopy—Conventional 9-GHz EPR measurements were performed using a Bruker ER 300 spectrometer with a standard TE102 cavity equipped with a liquid helium cryostat (Oxford Instrument) and a microwave frequency counter (Hewlett Packard 5350B). The spectra of frozen samples of oat peroxygenase (0.1 mm concentration, 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0) and horseradish peroxidase (0.5 mm concentration, 100 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0) were recorded at 4 K. Analytical Procedures—Radioactivity was measured on TLC plates with a Berthold TLC linear detector LB 2821, and peak integration was obtained by using the program CHROMA 1D (Packard Instrument Co.). Radioactivity was also determined in a liquid scintillation spectrometer (LS 9000, Beckman). Chiralphase HPLC was performed under isocratic conditions on a Shimadzu instrument coupled with a radiomatic 500TR analyzer (Packard Instrument Co.). Peak integration was obtained using Flo-one software. The resolution of the enantiomers of 14C-labeled methyl cis-9,10-epoxystearate was performed on a Chiralcel OB column (4.6 × 250 mm; Baker Chemical Co.) with a solvent mixture of n-hexane/isopropanol (98.5:1.5 at 0.3 ml/min). The separation of the R and S enantiomers of methyl p-toluyl sulfoxide was achieved on the same chiral column eluted with a solvent mixture of n-hexane-isopropanol (80:20 at 0.6 ml/min). Products obtained after the reaction of 13-hydroperoxy-octadeca-9,11-dienoic acid (13-[1-14C]HPOD) with recombinant AtPXG1 were separated by reverse phase (RP)-HPLC on a Lichrospher (Agilent Technologies) 100 RP-18 (5-μm) column with a solvent mixture of acetonitrile:water:acetic acid (50:50: 0.1, v/v/v) at 0.6 ml/min. Identification of the trihydroxy derivative of linoleic acid was achieved by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis after methylation of the acid function with ethereal diazomethane and silylation of the hydroxyl groups with N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamine (Pierce). Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis was performed on an Agilent 5973 N apparatus with ionizing energy of 70 eV. The sample was injected directly into a DB-5-coated fused capillary column (30 m; 0.25-mm internal diameter; J. W. Scientific) with a temperature program of 10 °C/min from 100 to 280 °C followed by 10 min at 280 °C. Purification of PXG from Oat Seed Microsomes—Peroxygenase activity was purified from oat seeds and was found to be localized to microsomal fractions. The membrane-bound peroxygenase could not be released by treatment with 3 m KCl, confirming that the enzyme is an integral membrane protein (19Blée E. Durst F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 922-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We, therefore, tested various detergents (CHAPS, BIG-CHAP, octylglucoside, Triton X-100, emulphogene) for their ability to solubilize the enzyme. Emulphogene (0.2%) was among the most effective. The solubilized membrane extract was purified according to the protocol described under “Experimental Procedures.” The instability of the peroxygenase caused severe problems especially during dialysis and concentration of the pooled fractions, but the addition of glycerol (10%) contributed to some extent to stabilize PXG (Table 2). Further purification using strong cationic exchanger (Mono S) or hydrophobic column (alkyl-Superose) resulted in a loss of enzyme activity. It is unclear whether this loss of activity is the result of inactivation or irreversible binding of the enzyme to the columns. Analysis on SDS-PAGE of the final fractions containing PXG activity showed a bulk of proteins of low molecular weight near the migration front but also a band around 27 kDa, whose intensity was correlated with peroxygenase activity (Fig. 2). The N terminus sequence of this protein (AVVVSDAMSSVAKGAPVTAQ) exhibited similarity with ATS1 (39% identity), encoding an embryo-specific gene in Arabidopsis (22Nuccio M.L. Thomas T.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and with abscisic acid-induced EFA 27 in rice (35%), a membrane-bound protein having a mass of 27 kDa (23Frandsen G.I. Müller-Uri F. Nielsen M. Mundy J. Skriver K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 343-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These proteins belong to a small family called caleosin (24Chen J.C.F. Tsai C.C.Y. Tzen J.T.C. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) because they contain a calcium binding domain and seem to possess similar structural features with oleosins, which are found in lipid droplets. This apparent localization of caleosin prompted us to examine if lipid droplets display PXG activity.TABLE 2Representative purification of membrane-bound peroxygenase from oat seedlingsPurification stageTotal activitySpecific activityPurification factornmol/min%nmol/min/mgMicrosomes46410015.41Solubilization29162.763.74.2DEAE-Trisacryl30064.7150.19.8Dialysis27358.8147.99.6CM-Sepharose25655.1365.524.7 Open table in a new tab Purification of PXG from Oat Seed Lipid Droplets—Purified lipid droplets isolated from oat seeds were able to perform co-oxidation reactions known to be catalyzed by peroxygenases. For example, they actively oxidized thiobenzamide to its sulfoxide (65.8 nmol/min/mg of protein) and oleic acid into 9,10-epoxy-stearate (51.4 nmol/min/mg of protein). It should be noted that these activities were about four times higher than those determined in microsomal fractions. Consequently, we performed the purification of PXG from lipid droplets following the same protocol used for the microsomal fraction. Detergent was required to solubilize the peroxygenase activity from lipid droplets, suggesting that the protein was buried into the phospholipids monolayer or lipid core of these organelles. Silver nitrate staining of the purified enzyme fraction separated by SDS-PAGE showed two major bands at about 40 and 27 kDa. But only the intensity of the latter was correlated with the activity of the peroxygenase. The N terminus sequence of this 27-kDa protein (AVVVSDAMSSVAKGAPVTAQRPVXXD) was identical to that of the protein isolated from oat seeds microsomes (but extended the sequence by some amino acids) and, thus, also showed homologies with caleosins (48 and 43% with ATS1 and EF27, respectively). Considering that most of caleosins identified so far have a molecular mass around 25–29 kDa, we hypothesized that the purified 27-kDa protein might be a caleosin supporting peroxygenase activity. Expression of Caleosins in Yeast and Identification as Plant Peroxygenases—To validate that PXG was indeed a caleosin, we have expressed in yeast the first caleosin identified in Arabidopsis (At4g26740, also named ATS1 or AtClo1 (22Nuccio M.L. Thomas T.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Naested H. Frandsen G.I. Jauh G.-Y. Hernadez-Pinzon I. Nielsen H.B. Murphy D.J. Rogers J.C. Mundy J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 463-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar)). Crude extracts of yeast expressing the recombinant protein catalyzed co-oxidation reactions typical of peroxygenase such as sulfoxidation of thiobenzamide (5.8 nmol/min/mg of protein), hydroxylation of aniline (4.5 nmol/min/mg of protein), or epoxidation of oleic acid (1.5 nmol/min/mg of protein). Importantly, all these activities were strictly hydroperoxide-dependent. Yeast crude extracts were then subfractionated by differential centrifugations into 100,000 × g supernatant, microsomes, and lipid droplets. Whereas microsomes and lipid droplets actively catalyzed co-oxidation reactions (for example, 62 and 124 nmol/min/mg of protein of thiobenzamide sulfoxide formed, respectively), the soluble fraction was found inactive. Neither extract from wild type WA6 nor yeast transformed with an empty vector showed any catalytic activity. Based on these experiments we annotate At4g26740 encoding peroxygenase as AtPXG1. To evaluate if such oxidative capacities of AtPXG1 are common to other caleosins, we have studied two other members of this family of proteins; Atclo2, recently renamed ATS2, which is believed to be associated with dormancy or germination of Arabidopsis seeds (26Toorop P.E. Barroco R.M. Engler G. Groot S.P.C. Hilhorst H.W.M."
https://openalex.org/W2016946930,"Abnormal production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines is a key feature of bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation, and cytotoxicity; however, the mechanisms regulating production of inflammatory markers remain unclear. Herein, we show that inhibition of the aldehyde-metabolizing enzyme aldose reductase (AR; AKR1B3) modulates NF-κB-dependent activation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in mouse serum, liver, heart, and spleen. Pharmacological inhibition or small interfering RNA ablation of AR prevented the biosynthesis of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 1β, interleukin-6, macrophage-chemoattractant protein-1, and cyclooxygenase-2 and prostaglandin E2 in LPS-activated RAW264.7 murine macrophages. The AR inhibition or ablation significantly attenuated LPS-induced activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and phospholipase C (PLC), nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of IκBα in macrophages. Furthermore, treatment of macrophages with 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (HNE), and cell-permeable esters of glutathionyl-4-hydroxynonanal (GS-HNE) and glutathionyl-1,4-dihydroxynonane (GS-DHN) activated NF-κB and PLC/PKC. Pharmacological inhibition or antisense ablation of AR that catalyzes the reduction of GS-HNE to GS-DHN prevented PLC, PKC, IKKα/β, and NF-κB activation caused by HNE and GS-HNE, but not by GS-DHN, suggesting that reduced GS-lipid aldehydes catalyzed by AR propagate LPS-induced production of inflammatory markers. Collectively, these data provide evidence that inhibition of AR may be a significant therapeutic approach in preventing bacterial endotoxin-induced sepsis and tissue damage.

Triantafilou K.J. Endotoxin Res. 2005; 11: 5-11PubMed Google Scholar). When Gram-negative bacteria multiply in the host, LPS is released into the circulation, where it is recognized by a variety of circulating cell types, triggering the induction of NF-κB-dependent proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1, prostaglandins, and nitric oxide (1Triantafilou M.

Acting in an autocrine and paracrine manner, cytokines and chemokines induce and amplify the host response to bacterial infection (4Jacobs A.T. Ignarro L.J. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2006; 63: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, excessive cytokine release can have deleterious consequences. For example, septic shock triggered by LPS causes production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and multiorgan dysfunction (2Karima R. Matsumoto S. Higashi H. Matsushima K. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 123-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), with myocardial dysfunction being the major cause of morbidity and mortality (6Cohen J. Nature. 2002; 420: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar). It has been shown that TNF-α is the earliest cytokine produced in large amounts in response to LPS and that it is the major cause of most of the effects of LPS (7Beutler B. Kruys V. J. Cardiovasc.

Recent studies have shown that the heart produces large amounts of cytokines, especially TNF-α, IL-1β, interferon-γ, macrophage-chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) during septic shock and related pathologies (11Kobayashi M.

Furthermore, antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine and butylated hydroxytoluene have been shown to attenuate LPS-induced activation of NF-κB expression of inflammatory cytokines and endotoxemia, indicating that ROS are the obligatory mediators of LPS signaling (14Antonicelli F.

Inhibition of AR significantly decreases neointima formation in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries, and also diminishes the in situ activation of NF-κB during restenosis (23Ramana K.V. Friedrich B. Srivastava S. Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S.K. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2910-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Our recent observations show that AR mediates the mitogenic and cytotoxic signals of cytokines and growth factors (17Ramana K.V. Chandra D. Srivastava S. Bhatnagar A. Aggarwal B.B. Srivastava S.K. J.

Inhibition or ablation of AR attenuates TNF-α- and growth factor-induced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, activation of NF-κB and PKC, proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, and also apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells and human lens epithelial cells (17Ramana K.V.

Similarly, ablation of AR attenuated the TNF-α-induced expression of adhesion molecules, intercellular adhesion molecule and vascular cell adhesion molecule, and monocyte adhesion to vascular endothelial cells (18Ramana K.V. Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S.K. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of AR in inflammatory signals induced by LPS is not known. Therefore, we have investigated the effect of pharmacological inhibition or RNA interference ablation of AR on LPS-induced expression of various cytokines and chemokines and other inflammatory markers such as Cox-2 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and examined the possible mechanism of AR mediation in LPS toxicity. Our studies indicate possible therapeutic application of AR inhibitors as anti-inflammatory drugs to treat septic shock induced by Gram-negative bacterial infections.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, phosphate-buffered saline, penicillin/streptomycin solution, trypsin, and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen.

After 15 min of incubation at 25 °C, the medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum. The cells were cultured for 48 h at 37 °C, and AR expression was determined by measuring AR protein by Western blot analysis using anti-AR antibodies and by measuring AR activity in the total cell lysates (24Ramana K.V. Friedrich B. Tammali R. West M.B. Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S.K. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 818-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Determination of Cytokine Levels—The mice were preinjected with sorbinil (25 mg/kg body weight, via the intraperitoneal route) or carrier for 24 h followed by LPS (4 μg/kg body weight) injection. At different time intervals the animals were killed and blood and heart tissues were collected. The RAW264.7 cells were preincubated with 10 μm sorbinil, tolrestat, or zopolrestat for 24 h followed by incubation with 1 μg/ml LPS. The cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12, and interferon-γ) and chemokine (MCP-1) levels were measured in mice serum and homogenates of heart, liver, and spleen and also in the culture medium of RAW264.7 cells using BD Biosciences Mouse Inflammation Cytometric Bead Array Kits according to the manufacturer's instructions by fluorescence-activated cell sorter automation.Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis of Cytokines—Macrophages were grown in 6-well plates at a density of ∼3.0 × 105 cells/well. The macrophages were serum starved in the presence or absence of sorbinil, tolrestat, or zopolrestat (10 μm) for 24 h and then stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS. Total RNA from RAW cells was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) as per supplier's instructions. Equal aliquots of RNA (1.0 μg) isolated from each sample were reverse transcribed with Omniscript and Sensiscript reverse transcriptase One-Step Reverse Transcriptase-PCR system with HotStar Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) at 55 °C for 30 min followed by PCR amplification. The oligonucleotide primer sequences were as follows: 5′-GGCAGGTCTACTTTGGAGTCATTGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACATTCGAGGCTCCAGTGAATTCGG-3′ (antisense) for TNF-α; 5′-AAGCTCTCACCTCAATGGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGCTTGAGAGGTGCTGATGT-3′ (antisense) for IL-1β; 5′-TTCCATCCAGTTGCCTTCTTGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTCATGTACTCCAGGTAG-3′ (antisense) for IL-6; 5′-AGCGGCTGACTGAACTCAGATTGTAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTCACAGTTTTCAGCTGTATAGGG-3′ (antisense) for MCP-1; and 5′-AGATCCACAACGGATACATT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCCCTCAAGATTGTCAGCAA-3′ (antisense) for GAPDH. PCR was carried out in a GeneAmp 2700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 15 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 47–64 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and then 72 °C for 5 min for final extension. Equal amounts of PCR products were electrophoresed with 2% agarose, 1 × TAE gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide.PGE2 Assay—Macrophages (2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates) were growth arrested in the serum-free medium without or with AR inhibitors for 24 h followed by incubation with 1 μg/ml LPS for another 24 h. Similarly AR siRNA or control siRNA-transfected macrophages were serum-starved for 24 h followed by incubation with 1 μg/ml LPS for another 24 h. The medium was collected from each well and analyzed for PGE2 using an Enzyme Immuno Assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cayman Chemical Co.). Briefly, 50 μl of diluted standard/sample was pipetted into a pre-coated goat polyclonal anti-mouse IgG 96-well plate. Aliquots (50 μl) of PGE2 monoclonal antibody and PGE2 acetylcholine esterase (AChE) conjugate (PGE2 tracer) were added to each well and allowed to incubate at 4 °C for 24 h. After incubation the wells were washed and 200 μl of Ellmans reagent containing acetylthiocholine and 5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) was added. Samples were read after 60 min at 412 nm with an ELISA reader (Packard).Cox Activity Assay—Macrophages (2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates) were growth arrested in serum-free medium with or without AR inhibitors for 24 h followed by incubation with 1 μg/ml LPS for another 24 h. Similarly AR siRNA or control siRNA-transfected macrophages were serum-starved for 24 h followed by incubation with 1 μg/ml LPS for another 24 h. The macrophages were homogenized in cold buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 1 mm EDTA and Cox activity was measured in 96-well plates according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cayman Chemical Co.). Briefly, 10 μl of standard/sample were incubated in the presence of arachidonic acid and colorimetric substrate, N,N,N,N-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, in a total reaction volume of 210 μl. The Cox peroxidase activity was measured colorimetrically by monitoring the appearance of oxidized N,N,N,N-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine at 590 nm using an ELISA reader (Packard).Determination of NF-κB Activation—The cytosolic as well as nuclear extracts were prepared as described before (17Ramana K.V. Chandra D. Srivastava S. Bhatnagar A. Aggarwal B.B. Srivastava S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32063-32070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The NF-κB activity was determined using the calorimetric non-radioactive NF-κB p65 Transcription Factor Assay kit (Chemicon Internationals) as per the supplier's instructions. Briefly, a double-stranded biotinylated oligonucleotide containing the consensus sequence for NF-κB binding (5′-GGGACTTTCC-3′) was mixed with the nuclear extract assay buffer provided. After incubation, the mixture (probe + extract + buffer) was transferred to the streptavidin-coated ELISA plate. The ELISA reactions were developed, stopped, and read at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader. For each experiment, triplicate samples were measured for statistical significance.NF-κB-dependent Reporter Gene Assay—The effect of AR inhibition/ablation on NF-κB-dependent reporter gene transcription induced by LPS was analyzed by secretary alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) assay. Briefly, macrophage (5 × 105 cells/well) were plated in 6-well plates and transiently transfected with pNF-κB-SEAP plasmid (250 ng) or control plasmid pTAL-SEAP for 6 h using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent. Subsequently, macrophages were treated with AR inhibitors and then stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS. Similarly, in other experiments simultaneous transfections were carried out with both AR siRNA as well as pNF-κB-SEAP plasmid followed by incubation with 1 μg/ml LPS. The cell culture medium was harvested after 48 h of LPS treatment and analyzed for SEAP activity according to the protocol essentially as described by the manufacturer (Clontech Labs) using a Packard microplate reader.Determination of PKC Activity—The membrane-bound total PKC activity was measured by using the Promega SignaTECT™ PKC assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described earlier (17Ramana K.V. Chandra D. Srivastava S. Bhatnagar A. Aggarwal B.B. Srivastava S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32063-32070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of the reaction mixture (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.6 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.16 mg/ml diacylglycerol, and 50 mm MgCl2) were mixed with [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, 10 μCi/μl) and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The extent of phosphorylation was detected by measuring radioactivity retained on the filter paper by using a scintillation counter.Western Blot Analysis—An equal amount of macrophage cell extracts were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted on nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with specific antibodies against AR, Cox-1, Cox-2, PLCβ3, PLCγ1, IκB-α, IKK α, β, γ, and HNE. Antibody binding was detected by enhanced picochemiluminescence (Pierce). Immunopositive bands were quantified using Kodak Image station 2000R loaded with Kodak one-dimensional image analysis software and the average changes in -fold intensities were calculated.Determination of ROS—The serum-starved macrophages (1.5 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate) without or with 10 μm sorbinil or tolrestat were treated with the ROS-sensitive fluorophore 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate for 30 min. Subsequently, macrophage were exposed to LPS (1 μg/ml) for 60 min and fluorescence was measured with a CytoFluorII fluorescence plate reader (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA) at excitation of 485 nm and emission of 528 nm.Determination of Intracellular Lipid Peroxidation—The lipid peroxidation was determined by measuring total α,β-unsaturated aldehyde (26Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5849) Google Scholar) levels in RAW264.7 cells (1 × 107 cells/well) treated without or with LPS in the absence and presence of sorbinil. The aldehydes were quantified colorimetrically using a lipid peroxidation kit (Bioxytech LPO-586™) obtained from Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI, as per the supplier's instructions. Briefly, the determination is based on the reaction of the chromogenic reagent, methanesulfonic acid, with α,β-unsaturated aldehydes such as HNE at 45 °C. One molecule of aldehyde reacts with two molecules of reagent to yield a stable chromophore with maximal absorbance at 586 nm.Preparation of GS-aldehyde Esters—HNE was synthesized as described previously (20Srivastava S. Watowich S.J. Petrash J.M. Srivastava S.K. Bhatnagar A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The conjugate of glutathione ethyl ester with HNE (GS-HNE-ester) was prepared as described (25Ramana K.V. Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S. Yadav U.C. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. Srivastava S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17652-17660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μmol of [4-3H]HNE (55,000 cpm/nmol) was incubated with 5 μmol of GSH ethyl ester in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was monitored by following the decrease in absorbance at 224 nm. The GS-HNE-ester was purified by reverse phase HPLC. The reduced form of the esterified glutathione-HNE conjugate (GS-DHN-ester) was prepared by incubating 100 nmol of GS-HNE-ester with 300 nmol of NADPH and 100 μg of AR in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, for 3 h at 37°C. The reaction was monitored by following the consumption of NADPH at 340 nm. The GS-DHN-ester was separated from GS-HNE-ester by reverse phase HPLC using a Varian reverse phase ODS C18 column pre-equilibrated with 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. The compounds were eluted using a gradient consisting of solvent A (0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid) and solvent B (100% acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The gradient was established such that solvent B reached 24% in 20 min, 26% in 30 min, and was held at this value for 10 min. In the next 10 min solvent B reached 60%, and in an additional 5 min it reached 100% where it was held for 10 min. Chemical identities of the GS-HNE and GS-DHN-esters were established by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI/MS) as described before (25Ramana K.V. Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S. Yadav U.C. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. Srivastava S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17652-17660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). ESI+/MS of GS-HNE-ester and GS-DHN-ester show m/z values of 492.2 and 494.2 (data not shown), respectively.Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. and the p values were determined using the unpaired Student's t test.RESULTSEffect of AR Inhibition on LPS-induced Cytokine Production in Mice Serum, Spleen, Heart, and Liver Tissues—A single intraperitoneal injection of LPS in mice caused 3-, 4-, 7.5-, and 1.5-fold increases in serum IL-12, TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 levels, respectively, on day 1, which gradually decreased to basal levels on day 7 (Table 1). In sorbinil + LPS-treated mice the serum levels of IL-12, TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 were only slightly higher compared with basal levels on day 1 and returned to basal levels on day 7. Similarly, as shown in Table 2, LPS caused 2-, 2.5-, 1.5-, and 2-fold induction of heart IL-12, TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1, respectively, on day 1, which gradually decreased but remained higher than basal levels on day 7. In spleen, LPS caused 2-, 4-, 5-, and 1.5-fold induction of IL-12, TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1, respectively, on day 1, which significantly decreased on day 7. In liver, LPS caused 2-, 2.5-, 3-, and 2-fold induction of IL-12, TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1, respectively, on day 1, which gradually decreased to basal levels on day 7. However, in sorbinil + LPS-treated animals the heart, spleen, and liver levels of IL-12, TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 were only slightly higher than basal levels on day 1 and on day 7 these levels were at or below the basal levels, suggesting that inhibition of AR could prevent LPS-induced production of cytokines and chemokines in mice.TABLE 1Effect of AR inhibitor on LPS-induced cytokine and chemokine production in mice serumSerumIL-12TNFIL-6MCP-11 Day3 Days7 Days1 Day3 Days7 Days1 Day3 Days7 Days1 Day3 Days7 Dayspg/mg proteinpg/mg proteinpg/mg proteinpg/mg proteinControl27.34 ± 3.626.72 ± 4.626.09 ± 5.324.2 ± 5.722.9 ± 4.925.78 ± 3.328.92 ± 1.169.16 ± 3.29.89 ± 2.6533.37 ± 9.5438.37 ± 5.7649.11 ± 8.15Sorbinil29.37 ± 5.826.97 ± 6.225.43 ± 3.2428.3 ± 9.223.32 ± 4.825.9 ± 4.810.2 ± 2.349.3 ± 2.78.96 ± 3.7629.54 ± 6.7632.29 ± 7.632.21 ± 2.5LPS107.55 ± 23.56ap value < 0.001 as control group is compared with the LPS group.57.9 ± 10.67bp value < 0.05 as control group is compared with the LPS group.31.34 ± 5.89145.4 ± 32.7ap value < 0.001 as control group is compared with the LPS group.63.74 ± 10.67ap value < 0.001 as control group is compared with the LPS group.34.89 ± 8.7bp value < 0.05 as control group is compared with the LPS group.57.76 ± 10.2ap value < 0.001 as control group is compared with the LPS group.49.36 ± 5.89ap value < 0.001 as control group is compared with the LPS group.45.67 ± 8.67ap value < 0.001 as control group is compared with the LPS group.57.14 ± 8.32bp value < 0.05 as control group is compared with the LPS group.87.52 ± 11.24bp value < 0.05 as control group is compared with the LPS group.189.33 ± 15.84ap value < 0.001 as control group is compared with the LPS group.LPS + sorbinil43.4 ± 12.02cp value < 0.001 LPS + sorbinil compared with the LPS group.23.23 ± 6.3cp value < 0.001 LPS + sorbinil compared with the LPS group.18.0 ± 8.18dp value < 0.05 LPS + sorbinil compared with the LPS group.43.4 ± 12.2cp value < 0.001 LPS + sorbinil compared with the LPS group.27.9 ± 3.67dp value < 0.05 LPS + sorbinil compared with the LPS group.17.95 ± 4.67dp value < 0.05 LPS + sorbinil compared with the LPS group.15.81 ± 6.21cp value < 0.001 LPS + sorbinil compared with the LPS group.11.31 ± 3.76cp value < 0.001 LPS + sorbinil compared with the LPS group.10.62 ± 3.93cp value < 0.001 LPS + sorbinil compared with the LPS group.29.32 ± 3.67dp value < 0.05 LPS + sorbinil compared with the LPS group.25.5 ± 6.5cp value < 0.001 LPS + sorbinil compa"
https://openalex.org/W1976613690,"Gap junctions in AII amacrine cells of mammalian retina participate in the coordination of the rod and cone signaling pathway involved in visual adaptation. Upon stimulation by light, released dopamine binds to D(1) receptors on AII amacrine cells leading to increased intracellular cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) levels. AII amacrine cells express the gap junctional protein connexin36 (Cx36). Phosphorylation of Cx36 has been hypothesized to regulate gap junctional activity of AII amacrine cells. However, until now in vivo phosphorylation of Cx36 has not been reported. Indeed, it had been concluded that Cx36 in bovine retina is not phosphorylated, but in vitro phosphorylation for Cx35, the bass ortholog of Cx36, had been shown. To clarify this experimental discrepancy, we examined protein kinase A (PKA)-induced phosphorylation of Cx36 in mouse retina as a possible mechanism to modulate the extent of gap junctional coupling. The cytoplasmic domains of Cx36 and the total Cx36 protein were phosphorylated in vitro by PKA. Mass spectroscopy revealed that all four possible PKA consensus motifs were phosphorylated; however, domains point mutated at the sites in question showed a prevalent usage of Ser-110 and Ser-293. Additionally, we demonstrated that Cx36 was phosphorylated in cultured mouse retina. Furthermore, activation of PKA increased the level of phosphorylation of Cx36. cAMP-stimulated, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Cx36 protein was accompanied by a decrease of tracer coupling between AII amacrine cells. Our results link increased phosphorylation of Cx36 to down-regulation of permeability through gap junction channels mediating light adaptation in the retina."
https://openalex.org/W1969877322,"Helicobacter pylori cagA-positive strains are associated with gastric adenocarcinoma. The cagA gene product CagA is delivered into gastric epithelial cells where it localizes to the plasma membrane and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at the EPIYA-repeat region, which contains the EPIYA-A segment, EPIYA-B segment, and Western CagA-specific EPIYA-C or East Asian CagA-specific EPIYA-D segment. In host cells, CagA specifically binds to and deregulates SHP-2 phosphatase via the tyrosine-phosphorylated EPIYA-C or EPIYA-D segment, thereby inducing an elongated cell shape known as the hummingbird phenotype. In this study, we found that CagA multimerizes in cells in a manner independent of its tyrosine phosphorylation. Using a series of CagA mutants, we identified a conserved amino acid sequence motif (FPLXRXXVXDLSKVG), which mediates CagA multimerization, within the EPIYA-C segment as well as in a sequence that located immediately downstream of the EPIYA-C or EPIYA-D segment. We also found that a phosphorylation-resistant CagA, which multimerizes but cannot bind SHP-2, inhibits the wild-type CagA-SHP-2 complex formation and abolishes induction of the hummingbird phenotype. Thus, SHP-2 binds to a preformed and tyrosinephosphorylated CagA multimer via its two Src homology 2 domains. These results, in turn, indicate that CagA multimerization is a prerequisite for CagA-SHP-2 interaction and subsequent deregulation of SHP-2. The present work raises the possibility that inhibition of CagA multimerization abolishes pathophysiological activities of CagA that promote gastric carcinogenesis.

Helicobacter pylori is a micro-aerophilic spiral-shaped bacterium. It colonizes the human stomach and is estimated to inhabit at least half of the world's human population. Chronic infection in the stomach with H. pylori causes gastric diseases such as chronic gastritis and peptic ulceration later in life. Epidemiological and pathological studies have further indicated that infection with cagA-positive H. pylori strains is associated with a high risk of gastric cancer (1Blaser M.J. Perez-Perez G.I.

The EPIYA-repeat region of the CagA protein of H. pylori isolated in Western countries contains the EPIYA-A, EPIYA-B, and Western CagA-specific EPIYA-C segments. The EPIYA-C segment variably multiplies among distinct Western CagA proteins, mostly ranging from 1 to 3. On the other hand, the EPIYA-repeat region of the CagA protein of H. pylori isolated in East Asian countries contains the EPIYA-A, EPIYA-B, and East Asian CagA-specific EPIYA-D segments. EPIYA motifs present in the EPIYA-C and EPIYA-D segments are major sites of CagA tyrosine phosphorylation, to which SHP-2 protein tyrosine phosphatase specifically binds in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (14Higashi H.

Upon complex formation, CagA deregulates SHP-2 phosphatase activity, which, in turn, dephosphorylates and inactivates focal adhesion kinase, thereby inducing an elongated cell shape with elevated cell motility (17Tsutsumi R.

The CagA-SHP-2 interaction requires both the N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains of SHP-2 (14Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Fujita A. Yamazaki S. Asaka M. Azuma T. Hatakeyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, a single EPIYA-C or EPIYA-D segment is sufficient for CagA to form a physical complex with SHP-2. These observations indicate that a SHP-2 protein simultaneously interacts with two tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA proteins via the SH2 domains. Consistent with this idea, we previously reported that CagA multimerizes in mammalian cells (14Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Fujita A. Yamazaki S. Asaka M. Azuma T. Hatakeyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14428-14433Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). In this work, we examined the structural basis of CagA multimerization and identified the multimerization motif that is highly conserved between Western and East Asian CagA proteins. We also investigated the biological role of the CagA multimerization and found that SHP-2 specifically binds to a preformed CagA multimer in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner, and we discuss the pathophysiological relevance of CagA multimerization in cells.

COS-7 cells (1.5 × 106 cells) were transfected with 30 μg of plasmids by using the calcium phosphate method as previously described (19Tsutsumi R. Higashi H. Higuchi M. Okada M. Hatakeyama M. J.

Total cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filters (Millipore) were incubated in primary antibodies and then visualized by using Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Intensities of chemiluminescence on the immunoblotted filter were quantitated using a luminescence image analyzer (LAS-1000, FUJIFILM). Phosphorylation-independent Multimerization of CagA—In a previous study, we demonstrated that ABCCC-type Western CagA (CagA-ABCCC) can multimerize and thus exist as a dimer, oligomer, or a higher order of protein complex in cells (14Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Fujita A. Yamazaki S. Asaka M. Azuma T. Hatakeyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14428-14433Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). However, we also noticed that the recombinant CagA-ABCCC protein produced in Escherichia coli does not spontaneously multimerize in vitro, indicating that CagA multimerization occurs only in mammalian host cells. 3H. Higashi, T. Hayashi, M. Horio, and M. Hatakeyama, unpublished observation. To understand the biological role of CagA multimerization, we first investigated whether East Asian CagA, another major type of CagA, can also multimerize in cells. Because Western CagA and East Asian CagA are primarily characterized by the difference in the structure of the EPIYA-repeat region, we employed a CagA-ABD mutant that was made from CagA-ABCCC by replacing the entire EPIYA-repeat region with that derived from F32 East Asian CagA (Fig. 1A) (14Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Fujita A. Yamazaki S. Asaka M. Azuma T. Hatakeyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14428-14433Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). CagA-ABD was tagged with a FLAG or HA epitope, and the resulting FLAG- and HA-tagged CagA-ABD molecules were co-expressed in COS-7 cells. Sequential immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of the cell lysates with anti-HA and -FLAG antibodies revealed that CagA-ABD, which possesses the EPIYA-repeat region from East Asian CagA, multimerizes in cells (Fig. 1B). Quantitation of each of the CagA bands indicated that only a small fraction (<5%) of FLAG-tagged CagA-ABD proteins expressed in COS-7 cells were associated with HA-tagged CagA-ABD proteins. Thus, the CagA multimers may be labile and easily dissociate into monomers during protein extraction and immunoprecipitation in our experimental conditions. Alternatively, predominant CagA proteins may exist as monomers, with a small amount of CagA existing as multimers, in cells. In this case, the formation of CagA multimer may require an additional cellular component whose expression level determines the amount of CagA multimers. Next, to address the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in CagA multimerization, we made a phosphorylation-resistant form of CagA-ABD, CagA-abd, by replacing tyrosine residues that are present in the EPIYA-A, -B, and -D segments with alanine residues. The CagA-abd mutant was HA-tagged and was co-expressed together with FLAG-tagged CagA-ABD in COS-7 cells. As was the case for CagA-ABD, CagA-abd, which did not undergo tyrosine phosphorylation, was capable of interacting with CagA-ABD (Fig. 1C). Based on this result, we concluded that CagA multimerizes independently of tyrosine phosphorylation. This result also excluded the possibility that CagA multimerization requires cellular proteins (such as SHP-2 and Csk) that interact with CagA in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner (11Selbach M. Moese S. Hauck C.R. Meyer T.F. Backert S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6775-6778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 19Tsutsumi R. Higashi H. Higuchi M. Okada M. Hatakeyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3664-3670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Delineation of the CagA Region Involved in Multimerization—To investigate the mechanism of CagA multimerization in more detail, we narrowed down the CagA region that is involved in multimerization by using a series of CagA deletion mutants. When CagA-ABD was co-expressed with CagA-ΔABCCC, which lacks the entire EPIYA-repeat region in COS-7 cells, the two CagA derivatives failed to interact with each other (Fig. 2A). This result revealed a critical role of the EPIYA-repeat region in CagA multimerization. Restoration of a single EPIYA motif or triple EPIYA motifs in the CagA-ΔABCCC mutant did not confer CagA multimerization, arguing against an active role of the EPIYA motif in the multimerization process (Fig. 2A). We then generated two CagA-ABD derivatives, CagA-ABD-ΔD and CagA-ABD-ΔAB. CagA-ABD-ΔD contains EPIYA-A and EPIYA-B segments but lacks the EPIYA-D segment. Conversely, CagA-ABD-ΔAB lacks the EPIYA-A and EPIYA-B segments (Fig. 2B). Studies on co-expression in COS-7 cells show that CagA-ABD-ΔAB is capable of interacting with CagA-ABD, whereas CagA-ABD-ΔD failed to do so (Fig. 2B). Accordingly, the 91-amino-acid sequence (residues 922–1012) in the EPIYA-repeat region of CagA-ABD is responsible for CagA multimerization. To further delineate the CagA sequence that is required for CagA multimerization, the above-identified 91-amino-acid residues were subdivided into D1 and D2 sequences (Fig. 3A), and a CagA-ABD-ΔAB mutant that also lacks the D1 or D2 sequence was generated. When co-expressed in COS-7 cells, FLAG-tagged CagA-ABD-ΔAB was capable of interacting with HA-tagged CagA-ABD-ΔABD1 but not HA-tagged CagA-ABD-ΔABD2 (Fig. 3B). Again, deletion of the EPIYA sequence from CagA-ABD-ΔAB did not influence CagA multimerization. A reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiment confirmed the interaction between CagA-ABD-ΔABD1 and CagA-ABD-ΔAB (Fig. 3C). These observations indicated that the D2 sequence is responsible for CagA multimerization in ABD-type East Asian CagA species. Identification of the CagA Multimerization Motif That Is Conserved between East Asian and Western CagA Species—We have previously shown that Western CagA multimerizes in mammalian cells (14Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Fujita A. Yamazaki S. Asaka M. Azuma T. Hatakeyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14428-14433Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Identification of the D2 sequence in East Asian CagA therefore prompted us to investigate the sequence that is utilized for Western CagA multimerization. The observation that the EPIYA-A and EPIYA-B segments, which are highly conserved between Western and East Asian CagA species, are not involved in CagA multimerization suggested that the EPIYA-C segment is involved in the multimerization of Western CagA. Accordingly, we expressed a Western CagA mutant (CagA-ΔABCC-s) that lacks the amino acid sequence between 869 and 1008 together with CagA-ABCCC and found that they interact with each other (Fig. 4A). Taken together with the previous finding that CagA-ΔABCCC (which was made from CagA-ABCCC by deleting the entire EPIYA-repeat region) lost the ability to multimerize, we concluded that the sequence between residues 1009 and 1086, which contains a single repeat of the EPIYA-C segment, is responsible for Western CagA multimerization. Assuming that CagA multimerization is mediated by the homophilic interaction of an integrated CagA structure, we wondered whether such a structure is conserved between Western CagA and East Asian CagA proteins. Accordingly, we expressed CagA-ABD-ΔAB together with CagA-ΔABCC, which was made from CagA-ΔABCC-s by deleting a 44-amino-acid stretch located immediately after the last repeat of the EPIYA-C segment in the EPIYA-repeat region of CagA-ABCCC, in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4B). The co-expression study revealed that the two CagA derivatives mutually interact with each other in cells, indicating that the mechanism of CagA multimerization is conserved between Western and East Asian CagA proteins. Furthermore, the result indicated that the sequence responsible for multimerization of Western CagA is present within the EPIYA-C segment. However, as we reported previously, the EPIYA-C and EPIYA-D segments exhibit only a limited homology around the EPIYA motif (Fig. 4C, upper panel) (14Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Fujita A. Yamazaki S. Asaka M. Azuma T. Hatakeyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14428-14433Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). As noted, the EPIYA motif itself does not seem to play a role in CagA multimerization (see Figs. 2A and 3B). Consistent with this notion, deletion of the EPIYA motif from CagA-ΔABCC did not abolish CagA multimerization (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, deletion or substitution of the TID sequence, which is also conserved between the EPIYA-C and EPIYA-D segments, did not affect CagA multimerization (Fig. 4C). Meanwhile, we noticed that the first 16-amino-acid residues of the EPIYA-C segment are closely related to the residues that located immediately downstream of the EPIYA-D segment in the D2 sequence of East Asian CagA (Fig. 4D, upper panel, gray boxes). This observation raised the idea that the conserved 16-amino-acid sequence mediates CagA multimerization. To investigate this possibility, we deleted the 16-amino-acid stretch from CagA-ABD-ΔABD1 to make CagA-ABD-ΔABD1–16AA. When co-expressed in COS-7 cells, CagA-ABD-ΔABD1–16AA lost the ability to interact with CagA-ABD-ΔAB (Fig. 4D, lower panel). Thus, the conserved 16-amino-acid sequence is responsible for East Asian CagA multimerization. The identified sequences between the EPIYA-C segment of Western CagA and the D2 sequence of East Asian CagA are characterized by the presence of a conserved FPLXRXXVXDLSKVG motif, which we designated as the CagA multimerization (CM) motif. It should also be noted that the sequences that immediately follow the EPIYA-C and EPIYA-D segments are well conserved between Western and East Asian CagA species. Accordingly, Western CagA has an additional CM motif that follows the last repeat of the EPIYA-C segment (Fig. 4D, upper panel) (see also “Discussion”). Role of CagA Multimerization in CagA-SHP-2 Complex Formation—We previously reported that both the N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains of SHP-2 are indispensable for the complex formation of SHP-2 with Western CagA (14Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Fujita A. Yamazaki S. Asaka M. Azuma T. Hatakeyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14428-14433Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). We wished to know whether this is also the case with East Asian CagA. To this end, we co-expressed SHP-2 and a series of EPIYA mutants for CagA-ABD in COS-7 cells and confirmed that the CagA-SHP-2 interaction is strictly dependent on the phosphorylation of the EPIYA-D site in the case of East Asian CagA (Fig. 5A). We also co-expressed East Asian CagA and a series of SHP-2 mutants and confirmed that the CagA-SHP-2 interaction requires both of the SH2 domains of SHP-2 (Fig. 5B). Notably, each of the SH2 domains of SHP-2 independently binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides with similar specificity (20De Souza D. Fabri L.J. Nash A. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Baca M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9229-9236Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, major CagA species, such as ABD-type CagA and ABC-type CagA, possess only a single SHP-2-binding site, the EPIYA-C or EPIYA-D segment. These findings collectively indicated that a single SHP-2 molecule binds to a preformed CagA dimer or multimer. If this is the case, then the phosphorylation-resistant CagA-abd, which multimerizes but cannot bind SHP-2, should act as a dominant-negative CagA that inhibits CagA-SHP-2 complex formation as a component of the CagA dimer (or multimer). To this end, we co-transfected CagA-ABD and CagA-abd in COS-7 cells and compared the levels of endogenous SHP-2 that formed complexes with CagA-ABD. The results of the experiment showed that CagA-SHP-2 complex formation was abolished by co-expression of CagA-abd. Thus, the phosphorylation-resistant CagA-abd acted as a dominant-negative mutant in the CagA-SHP-2 complex formation (Fig. 6A). The result, in turn, indicated that CagA multimerization is a prerequisite for the interaction of SHP-2 with ABC- or ABD-type CagA. Furthermore, efficient inhibition of CagA-SHP-2 complex formation by phosphorylation-resistant CagA suggested that the molecular nature of the CagA multimer is an oligomer such as a dimer. Finally, to consolidate the role of CagA multimerization in the pathophysiological activity of CagA, we examined the effect of the dominant-negative CagA-abd mutant on the induction of cell elongation known as the hummingbird phenotype by CagA-ABD (6Segal E.D. Cha J. Lo J. Falkow S. Tompkins L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14559-14564Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The morphological change has been shown to be induced by the complex formation between CagA and SHP-2 in AGS cells (13Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 18Higashi H. Nakaya A. Tsutsumi R. Yokoyama K. Fujii Y. Higuchi M. Takahashi A. Kurashima Y. Ishikawa S. Tanaka S. Azuma T.

As shown in Fig. 6B, expression of CagA-ABD together with CagA-abd significantly inhibited induction of the hummingbird phenotype by CagA-ABD in AGS cells. The result indicated that CagA multimerization plays an important role in the morphogenetic activity of CagA in gastric epithelial cells.FIGURE 6The role of CagA multimerization in CagA-SHP-2 signaling.

We also identified a CM motif that is conserved between Western and East Asian CagA species. Finally, we showed that CagA multimerization is critically involved in the formation of the CagA-SHP-2 signaling complex, which plays an important role in cagA-positive H. pylori-mediated gastric pathogenesis. Upon delivery into gastric epithelial cells, CagA functionally mimics mammalian scaffolding adaptor proteins, such as Gab family proteins, through its interaction with multiple cellular proteins by both tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent and -independent mechanisms (21Hatakeyama M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 688-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). As a result, CagA perturbs intracellular signaling that regulates cell growth, cell motility, and cell polarity and thereby predisposes CagA-injected gastric epithelial cells to transformation. The best-characterized cellular target of CagA is the SH2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 (13Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 21Hatakeyama M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 688-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). CagA specifically interacts with SHP-2 in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner and deregulates the phosphatase activity. The results of our previous and present works provide compelling evidence that both the N- and C-SH2 domains of SHP-2 are required for the CagA-SHP-2 interaction. This finding, in turn, indicates that two phosphotyrosine-containing CagA sequences must interact with the two SH2 domains of a single SHP-2 molecule. In this regard, prevalent Western or East Asian CagA proteins possess only a single SHP-2-binding site, EPIYA-C in the case of the ABC-type Western CagA and EPIYA-D in the case of the ABD-type East Asian CagA. Given this notion, there are two possible mechanisms that explain the interaction of SHP-2 with CagA carrying a single SHP-2-binding site. One possible mechanism is that CagA multimerizes, or dimerizes, at the host cell plasma membrane, and the preformed CagA multimer (dimer) interacts with a single SHP-2 molecule. The other possible mechanism is that translocated CagA exists as a monomer and a single SHP-2 molecule bridges two tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA monomers to make a stable tripartite complex. The latter possibility is excluded by the results of our present work showing that CagA multimerizes regardless of its tyrosine phosphorylation status and that a phosphorylation-resistant CagA, which multimerizes but cannot bind SHP-2, inhibits the interaction between wild-type CagA and SHP-2. Hence, CagA-SHP-2 complex formation is impaired when the phosphorylation-resistant CagA is incorporated into the CagA multimer, such as the dimer. It should be also noted that there are a few CagA species that possess multiple EPIYA-C or EPIYA-D segments (4Covacci A. Censini S. Bugnoli M. Petracca R. Burroni D. Macchia G. Massone A. Papini E.

Our present work does not exclude the possibility that such CagA proteins bind to SHP-2 via the multiple SHP-2-binding sites regardless of CagA multimerization. Our study, employing a series of CagA mutants, uncovered a critical role of the 16-amino-acid sequence motif in CagA multimerization, which we termed as the CM motif. It is possible that two CagA proteins dimerize via the homophilic interaction of the structure that is created by the CM motif. Given that CagA multimerization occurs only in mammalian cells, however, it is also possible that the multimerization process requires additional cellular proteins. Such proteins, if they exist, may exist as a multimer (dimer) to which CagA binds via the CM motif. The CM motif is present in the N-terminal sequence of the 34-amino-acid EPIYA-C segment, which variably duplicates among distinct Western CagA species. The motif is also present in the EPIYA-repeat region that is located immediately downstream of the EPIYA-C or EPIYA-D segment (Figs. 4D and 7). This finding provides additional insights into the structural composition of the EPIYA-repeat region, which was made via homologous recombination within the cagA gene (14Higashi H. Tsutsumi R.

In East Asian CagA, the EPIYA-D segment is immediately followed by an incomplete EPIYA-C-like sequence, which contains the CM motif but lacks the EPIYA motif. Similarly, the last repeat of the EPIYA-C segment of Western CagA is followed by an incomplete EPIYA-C-like sequence (Fig. 7). Accordingly, Western CagA possesses multiple CM motifs, whereas East Asian CagA possesses a single CM motif. The difference in the number of CM motifs might influence the potential of individual CagAs to multimerize in host cells. SHP-2 is a cytoplasmic signal transducer that physiologically functions as a positive regulator of cell growth and cell movement (22Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Furthermore, gain-of-function mutations in the PTPN11 gene, which encodes SHP-2, have been found in a variety of human malignancies (23Bentires-Alj M. Paez J.G. David F.S. Keilhack H. Halmos B.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8816-8820Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that deregulated activation of SHP-2 by CagA plays a key role in the development of gastric carcinogenesis (21Hatakeyama M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 688-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). A critical role for CagA-SHP-2 interaction in the development of gastric cancer has also been implicated from the studies of cagA-positive H. pylori strains isolated in gastric cancer patients (24Azuma T. Yamazaki S. Yamakawa A. Ohtani M. Muramatsu A. Suto H. Ito Y. Dojo M. Yamazaki Y. Kuriyama M. Keida Y. Higashi H. Hatakeyama M. J. Infect.

The present work revealed that CagA multimerization plays an important role in the pathophysiological activity of CagA in disturbing host cell function via SHP-2 deregulation. This, in turn, indicates that inhibition of CagA multimerization, which abolishes CagA activity as a potential oncoprotein, in gastric epithelial cells is an effective way to prevent gastric cancer development in individuals infected with cagA-positive H. pylori. Obviously, the identified CM motif is an excellent structural target for the development of a specific inhibitor of CagA multimerization.

These thiol disulfide oxidoreductases catalyze disulfide reductions, preferring GSH-mixed disulfides as substrates. We have developed a new real-time fluorescence-based method for measuring the deglutathionylation activity of glutaredoxins using a glutathionylated peptide as a substrate. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that the only intermediate in the reaction is the glutaredoxin-GSH mixed disulfide. This specificity was solely dependent on the unusual γ-linkage present in glutathione. The deglutathionylation activity of both wild-type Escherichia coli glutaredoxin and the C14S mutant was competitively inhibited by oxidized glutathione, with Ki values similar to the Km values for the glutathionylated peptide substrate, implying that glutaredoxin primarily recognizes the substrate via the glutathione moiety. In addition, wild-type glutaredoxin showed a sigmoidal dependence on GSH concentrations, the activity being significantly decreased at low GSH concentrations. Thus, under oxidative stress conditions, where the ratio of GSH/GSSG is decreased, the activity of glutaredoxin is dramatically reduced, and it will only have significant deglutathionylation activity once the oxidative stress has been removed. Different members of the protein disulfide isomerases (PDI) family showed lower activity levels when compared with glutaredoxins; however, their deglutathionylation activities were comparable with their oxidase activities.

Berends W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 399: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and from 1 to 8 mm in mammalian cells (20Griffith O.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 922-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Glutathione may also be found in oxidative cellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum as a disulfide linked dipeptide, GSSG, or as protein-GSH mixed disulfides (21Bass R. Ruddock L.W.

Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). Protein-GSH mixed disulfides have also been observed to accumulate in other cellular compartments, e.g. the cytoplasm, during oxidative stress (23Cotgreave I.A. Gerdes R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The primary function of glutaredoxins is thought to be the reduction of protein-GSH mixed disulfides, liberating the native functional protein (24Shelton M.D. Chock P.B. Mieyal J.J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar).Glutaredoxins exist in monothiol (CXXS) and dithiol (CXXC) active site variants. The N-terminal active site cysteine is essential and sufficient for the reduction of GSH-mixed disulfides (25Bushweller J.H. Åslund F. Wüthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 26Yang y. Wells W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12759-12765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monothiol mechanism has been suggested to proceed via a pathway where the thiolate of Grx 2The abbreviations used are: Grx, glutaredoxin; HED, β-hydroxyethyl disulfide; PDI, protein disulfide isomerases. 2The abbreviations used are: Grx, glutaredoxin; HED, β-hydroxyethyl disulfide; PDI, protein disulfide isomerases. initiates a nucleophilic attack on the mixed disulfide between protein thiol and GSH, leading to a formation of a new disulfide between Grx and GSH and the release of a protein substrate in the reduced form (Fig. 1, reaction 1) (24Shelton M.D. Chock P.B.

The mixed disulfide between Grx and GSH can be reduced by GSH through a nucleophilic attack on the disulfide to form GSSG and reduced Grx as the final products (Fig. 1, reaction 2) (25Bushweller J.H. Åslund F. Wüthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 27Fernandes A.P. Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox.

The dithiol mechanism proceeds via the same pathway except that there is partitioning at the Grx-GSH mixed disulfide state to form oxidized Grx (Fig. 1, reaction 3). This can be retrieved to the functional pathway by reduction by GSH (Fig. 1, reaction 4) (31Yang Y. Jao S. Nanduri S. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. Qin J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17145-17156Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).Grx activity is often measured using an artificial nonspecific substrate β-hydroxyethyl disulfide (HED) in a spectrophotometric coupled assay (1Holmgren A.

Mieyal J.J. Qin J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17145-17156Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or glutathionylated protein substrates are used (28Srinivasan U. Mieyal P.A. Mieyal J.J.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here we report the development of a new real-time method for measuring the deglutathionylation activity of glutaredoxins. The assay is based on a homogeneous glutathionylated peptide and measures the actual formation of deglutathionylated product rather than indirectly the consumption of NADPH as in the traditional HED assay. This method offers new insights into the mechanism of action of the glutaredoxins and allows the glutaredoxin-like activity of other thioredoxin superfamily members, such as protein disulfide isomerases (PDI), to be determined. We also demonstrate that the reaction intermediate in the deglutathionylation reaction is exclusively Grx-GSH mixed, disulfide confirming a previous report (31Yang Y. Jao S. Nanduri S. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. Qin J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17145-17156Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and that it is dependent on the unusual γ-linkage present in GSH.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—All constructs used in the experiments were cloned into an expression vector generated previously (32Alanen H.I. Salo K.E. Pekkala M. Siekkinen H.M. Pirneskoski A. Ruddock L.W. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2003; 5: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which incorporates an N-terminal His tag to the cloned gene. E. coli Grx1 was cloned from E. coli strain XL1-Blue, and yeast Grx1 was cloned from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain W303. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the instructions of the QuikChange™ kit (Strategene, La Jolla, CA). All plasmids were checked for correctness by sequencing. Proteins were expressed in E. coli strains BL21 (DE3) pLysS or Rosetta-gami and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and ion exchange chromatography as described for the a domain of PDI (33Lappi A.-K. Lensink M.F. Alanen H.I. Salo K.E.H. Lobell M. Juffer A.H. Ruddock L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Pure fractions, as determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-PAGE, were combined and buffer-exchanged into 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, and stored frozen. The concentration of each protein was determined spectrophotometrically using a calculated molar absorption coefficient. All purified proteins were analyzed for authenticity by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.Assay for Determining the Deglutathionylation Activity—The glutathionylated substrate peptide SQLWC(glutathione)LSN was ordered from The Biomolecular Science Facility, Department of Biosciences, University of Kent (Canterbury, Kent, UK). Fluorescence measurements were performed with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrometer using a 315-μl cuvette. Assays were carried out in McIlvaine buffer (0.2 m disodium hydrogen phosphate, 0.1 m citric acid) at pH 4.5–7.5, including appropriate amounts of GSH (0–4 mm), NADPH (50 μm), glutathione reductase (0 or 20 nm) (all from Sigma), EDTA (1 mm), substrate peptide (0–20 μm), and the enzyme of interest (0–200 nm). To prevent loss of Grx due to adsorption on the walls of plastic tubes and the cuvette, dilutions of Grx and glutathione reductase were made into solutions containing bovine serum albumin, the final concentration of bovine serum albumin in the assay being 1 μg/ml. All measurements were done at 25 °C, excitation 280 nm, emission 356 nm, and slit widths 5 nm.Analysis of Fluorescence Data—The fluorescence data were analyzed with Igor Pro 3.14 (Wavemetrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). Initial rates of reaction were determined from linear fits over 20 units of change in fluorescence signal or other applicable linear part of the curve and correlating it to the total change in fluorescence observed during the reaction. The first few data points were ignored due to extra noise being observed during the first few seconds. The corresponding non-catalyzed background reaction rates (i.e. in the absence of Grx) were subtracted from the catalyzed rates. The change in fluorescence during the deglutathionylation reaction was proportional to the substrate concentration and otherwise independent of the reaction conditions except when glutathione reductase was omitted. In the absence of glutathione reductase, the overall change in fluorescence was up to 25% smaller, presumably due to the presence of an equilibrium between the deglutathionylation and glutathionylation reactions.Assay for Determining the Glutathionylation Activity—The reduced substrate peptide SQLWCLSN was ordered from The Biomolecular Science Facility, Department of Biosciences, University of Kent. Fluorescence measurements were performed in McIlvaine buffer (0.2 m disodium hydrogen phosphate, 0.1 m citric acid) at pH 7.0, including GSSG (5 mm), bovine serum albumin (1 μg/ml), EDTA (1 mm), reduced substrate peptide (5 μm), and the enzyme of interest (0–200 nm). Measurements were done at 25 °C, excitation 280 nm, emission 356 nm, and slit widths 5 nm.Synthesis of Alternative Substrate—The reduced substrate peptide (100 μm) was incubated with ECG, QCG, or paraECG (1 mm) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer at pH 8 for 1 h. Peptide-ECG, -QCG, and -paraECG mixed disulfides were purified by reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography using SOURCE 5RPC ST 4.6/150 column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). The peptides were eluted from the column with a linear gradient from buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) to 100% buffer B (90% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) over 10 column volumes. The peptides were dried by speed vacuum and resuspended into 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.3.Analysis of Reaction Intermediates by Mass Spectrometry—E. coli Grx1 wild type and C14S mutant and PDI a C39S mutant were used in trapping experiments. The protein was reduced with 1 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at room temperature. Excess of dithiothreitol was removed by gel filtration (NAP™ 10 columns, Amersham Biosciences), and the sample was further concentrated with Biomax Ultrafree centrifugal filter device (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The reduced protein (40 μm) was reacted with either substrate peptide (50 μm) or buffer alone in a total volume of 100 μl in McIlvaine buffer at pH 7.0. The reaction was quenched with 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide or 1.1 m iodoacetamide (both from Sigma). The excess of N-ethylmaleimide/iodoacetamide was removed with pepClean™ C-18 spin columns (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were eluted with 50%, acetonitrile and CH3COOH to a final concentration of 0.1% was added to samples. Molecular masses were measured with an electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (Micromass LCT, Manchester, UK) using positive ionization. Additional time-dependent trapping experiments were carried out using an RQF3 quenched-flow apparatus (KinTek, Austin, TX). The reduced protein (80 μm) was reacted with either substrate peptide (100 μm) or buffer alone in a total volume of 30 μl in McIlvaine buffer at pH 7.0. After the desired reaction time (0.01–1 s), the reaction was quenched with 0.5 m HCl, to ensure that the pH of the quenched product remained below pH 2.0 and was treated as previously.Stopped-flow Measurements—Stopped-flow experiments were performed with a SF2004 stopped-flow apparatus (Kin-Tek) with 20 μm E. coli C14S Grx1 and 0.14 mg/ml (357 μm) Ellman's reagent in McIlvaine buffer at the desired pH (4.5–7.5). The absorbance at 412 nm was measured for 0.2 s after mixing the two reagents, and the pseudo first-order rate constants were calculated using KinTek StopFlow v9.06 software.RESULTSDetermination of the Deglutathionylation Activity—To directly monitor the deglutathionylation activity of Grx, a glutathionylated substrate peptide was designed. The criteria for the design were that the peptide should contain a single glutathionylated cysteine residue with an adjacent fluorescent group. The peptide would also need to be small (for ease of synthesis) and water-soluble and contain no residues with charged side chains to eliminate any pH dependence of reaction rates from effects on the peptide. A similar strategy has previously been utilized to generate peptide substrates to monitor disulfide oxidation (34Ruddock L.W. Hirst T.R. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The peptide synthesized here, SQL-WC(glutathione)LSN, had an emission maximum at 356 nm (Fig. 2A), consistent with an aqueous exposed tryptophan. Upon removal of the glutathione, i.e. the reduction of the cysteine moiety, a 38% increase in total fluorescence was observed with no shift in the emission maximum. This change is consistent with quenching of the fluorescence of tryptophan residues by adjacent disulfide bonds (35Neves-Petersen M.T. Grycynski Z. Lakowicz J. Fojan P. Pedersen S. Petersen E. Petersen S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 588-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, deglutathionylation of the peptide could be measured directly in real time by monitoring the change in fluorescence at 356 nm in the presence of reducing agents such as GSH. At pH 7.0 in McIlvaine buffer, the non-catalyzed reaction was very slow, just 3% of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction with 20 nm E. coli Grx1 and 1 mm GSH (Fig. 2B). Since one of the products of the reaction, GSSG, may reglutathionylate the deglutathionylated peptide substrate, glutathione reductase and NADPH were added to the reaction to remove the GSSG formed.FIGURE 2Fluorescence analysis of peptide deglutathionylation.

As expected, E. coli Grx1 showed a linear dependence of the initial rate of reaction on the enzyme concentration (Fig. 3A). In addition, the initial rate of reaction increased with increasing substrate concentrations and fitted well to the Michaelis-Menten equation with Km = 7.8 μm and kcat = 4.4 s–1 ([GSH] = 1 mm; Fig. 3B). In contrast, although an increase in the initial rate with increasing GSH concentration was observed, with a plateau at the highest GSH concentrations measured, the plot could not be fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation and instead showed a sigmoidal shape ([substrate peptide] = 5 μm; Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Analysis of the reaction kinetics of glutaredoxin-catalyzed deglutathionylation.

Biol. 1999; 286: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Instead, the sigmoidal shape for the GSH dependence of E. coli Grx1 activity probably represents the net effect of the partitioning of the Grx-GSH mixed disulfide intermediate between the formation of reduced or oxidized Grx and the re-reduction of oxidized Grx1 by GSH (Fig. 1). To test this hypothesis, the C-terminal active site C14S mutant of E. coli Grx1 was made since this mutant cannot proceed to the oxidized state, and thus, there should be no partitioning. Under standard conditions ([GSH] = 1 mm, [substrate] = 5 μm), the initial rate of the C14S mutant-catalyzed reaction was only 23% of that catalyzed by the wild-type enzyme. Similar to wild type, the C14S mutant showed a linear dependence of the initial rate of reaction on the enzyme concentration (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the data with increasing substrate concentrations fitted well to the Michaelis-Menten equation with Km = 44 μm and kcat = 4.0 s–1 ([GSH] = 1 mm; Fig. 4B), although no plateau was observed due to the narrow range of possible substrate concentrations that could be used. In contrast to wild type, the increase observed in the initial rate with increasing GSH concentrations could be fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, giving Km = 48 μm and kcat = 0.36 s–1 ([substrate peptide] = 5 μm; Fig. 4C). A lower mid-point for glutathione dependence for the mutant (here Km = 48 μm) when compared with the wild-type enzyme (here mid-point ∼0.5 mm) has previously been reported for human Grx and assigned to the effects of the partitioning reaction to the oxidized state for the wild-type enzyme (31Yang Y.

Biol. 1994; 235: 1585-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) that the major intermediate in the deglutathionylation reaction catalyzed by Grx is the Grx-GSH mixed disulfide. To try to confirm this, experiments for trapping the reaction intermediate in equilibrium as well as quenched-flow reactions were undertaken with Grx1 and substrate peptide in the absence of GSH. However, analysis of the reaction products indicated only the presence of oxidized Grx1 (mass = 10637 Da), indicating that the nucleophilic attack by the C-terminal active site Cys residue on the Grx-GSH mixed disulfide was significantly faster than the nucleophilic attack by Grx1 on the glutathionylated substrate (Fig. 1). Since the C14S Grx1 mutant cannot undergo the same partitioning reaction, similar equilibrium and quenched-flow reactions were undertaken with this mutant. The results indicated that no Grx-peptide mixed disulfide (mass = 11572 Da) was observed, with only the Grx-GSH (mass = 10928 Da) mixed disulfide being formed. Under the test conditions used ([Grx1] = 80 μm, [substrate] = 100 μm), the half-time for this reaction was around 100 ms.Effects of Oxidized Glutathione—Since Grx forms mixed disulfides with GSH and not with peptide and since the Km for the C14S for GSH (48 μm) and glutathionylated-substrate (44 μm) are similar, it is likely that oxidized glutathione (GSSG) will act as a competitive substrate (i.e. glutathionylated glutathione) for the deglutathionylation reaction catalyzed by Grx. However, since the product of the reaction using GSSG as a substrate is GSSG, the net effect of this is that GSSG would act like a competitive inhibitor of the peptide deglutathionylation reaction. To test this, the deglutathionylation reactions were performed in the presence of varying amounts of GSSG and in the absence of glutathione reductase. Using changes in the absorbance of NADPH and glutathione reductase-catalyzed reduction of GSSG, the amount of GSSG in the GSH stock was calculate"

Remarkably, in vitro and in vivo observations revealed both inhibitory and stimulatory effects of SOCS2 on growth hormone signaling, suggesting an additional regulatory level. In this study, we examined the possibility of direct cross-modulation between SOCS proteins and found that SOCS2 could interfere with the inhibitory actions of other SOCS proteins in growth hormone, interferon, and leptin signaling. This SOCS2 effect was SOCS box-dependent, required recruitment of the elongin BC complex, and coincided with degradation of target SOCS proteins. Detailed mammalian protein-protein interaction trap (MAPPIT) analysis indicated that SOCS2 can interact with all members of the SOCS family. SOCS2 may thus function as a molecular bridge between a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase complex and SOCS proteins, targeting them for proteasomal turnover. We furthermore extended these observations to SOCS6 and SOCS7. Our findings point to a unique regulatory role for SOCS2, SOCS6, and SOCS7 within the SOCS family and provide an explanation for the unexpected phenotypes observed in SOCS2 and SOCS6 transgenic mice.

Subsequent phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the receptor tails enables recruitment of downstream signaling molecules whereby STATs play a prominent role. Activated STATs translocate to the nucleus, where they control cytokine-regulated gene transcription. Negative control occurs at many levels and involves receptor down-regulation, protein-tyrosine phosphatases, protein inhibitors of activated STATs, and members of the SOCS (suppressors of cytokine signaling) protein family. The SOCS family consists of eight different members (SOCS1–7 and CIS (cytokine-inducible SH2 domain-containing protein)) characterized by conserved structural features. All SOCS proteins consist of a central SH2 domain flanked by a variable N-terminal region and a conserved C-terminal SOCS box (1Kile B.T. Schulman B.A. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Martin H.M.

The role of SOCS2 in regulating cytokine-induced signals is obviously complex because increasing SOCS2 levels can overcome the negative effect of SOCS1 on GH receptor (GHR) and PRL signaling and can partially restore the SOCS3 down-regulated PRL function (26Favre H.

Unlike SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression, which is typically induced in a rapid and transient manner, SOCS2 expression usually occurs later after cytokine stimulation and is more prolonged (28Pezet A.

Consequently, it is tempting to speculate that SOCS2 may be involved in restoring cellular sensitivity by overcoming the inhibitory effect of other SOCS proteins. However, to date, no report concerning the precise molecular mechanism of action of SOCS2 in signal enhancement of GH response has been published. This study was conducted to clarify the stimulatory effect of SOCS2 observed in GH signaling. We demonstrate that SOCS2 can interfere with the negative regulatory effects of SOCS1 and SOCS3 via direct interaction. This effect requires the C-terminal SOCS box of the targeted SOCS protein as well as the elongin BC-binding motif in the SOCS2 SOCS box, supporting proteasomal degradation of the targeted SOCS proteins. We also show that this inter-SOCS cross-modulation can be extended to other cytokine receptor systems and to other members of the SOCS protein family.

Open table in a new tab Cell Culture, Transfection Procedures, and Reagents—HEK293-T, 3T3-F442A, and N38 cells were cultured in a 10% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum (Cambrex Corp.). For transfection experiments, cells were freshly seeded in 6-well plates. HEK293-T cells were transfected overnight with ∼2.5 μg of plasmid DNA using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation procedure. The pMET7-SVT construct was used to normalize for the amount of transfected DNA and load of the transcriptional and translational machinery. N38 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's guidelines. One day after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffed saline without calcium, magnesium, and sodium bicarbonate and cultured until used. Recombinant mouse leptin and human erythropoietin were purchased from R&D Systems. Human GH was purchased from ImmunoTools, and human IFN-β was generated in the laboratory. Luciferase and Secreted Alkaline Phosphatase (SEAP) Assays—For a typical luciferase experiment, HEK293-T or N38 cells were transfected with the desired constructs together with a luciferase reporter gene. For STAT5-dependent luciferase assays, we used a STAT5-responsive β-casein-derived luciferase reporter plasmid (38van de Geijn G.J. Gits J. Aarts L.H. Heijmans-Antonissen C. Touw I.P. Blood. 2004; 104: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For STAT3-dependent luciferase experiments, we used the pXP2d2-rPAP1-luciferase reporter, originating from the rat pancreatitis-associated protein 1 promoter, as described previously (36Eyckerman S. Verhee A. van der Heyden J. Lemmens I. Van Ostade X. Vandekerckhove J. Tavernier J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1114-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, cells were left untreated or were stimulated with ligand. After another 24 h, luciferase activity from triplicate samples was measured by chemiluminescence in a TopCount luminometer (Canberra Packard). For IFN-stimulated gene factor 3-dependent SEAP assays, we used the 6-16 SEAP reporter construct, which was constructed as described previously (39Pattyn E. Van Ostade X. Schauvliege L. Verhee A. Kalai M. Vandekerckhove J. Tavernier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34838-34845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The amount of SEAP was determined with a Phospha-Light kit (Tropix, Inc., Bedford, MA) using disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro-(1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro)tricycloneo[3.3.1.1]decan)-4-yl)phenyl phosphate as the luminogen substrate. Assays were performed in a 96-well microtiter plate following the manufacturer's guidelines. Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 and 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and alkaline phosphatase activity in triplicate samples was measured by chemiluminescence in the TopCount luminometer. Western Blot Analysis and Co-immunoprecipitation—Transfected HEK293-T or N38 cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.05% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). 5× loading buffer (156 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue sodium salt, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol) was added to the cell lysates, which were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Blotting efficiency was checked by Ponceau S staining (Sigma). Blocking, washing, and incubation with antibodies were carried out in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 5% dried skimmed milk and 0.1% Tween 20. FLAG-tagged (corresponding to the peptide tag DYKDDDDK) and E-tagged (corresponding to the peptide tag GAPVPYPDPLEPR) proteins were revealed using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma) and anti-E tag monoclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. Rabbit anti-SOCS2 polyclonal antibody was a gift from Dr. J. Johnston, and anti-mouse β-actin antibody was supplied by Sigma. Immunoblots were then revealed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, ∼2 × 106 HEK293-T cells were transfected with FLAG- or E-tagged pMET7-SOCS expression vectors. Cleared lysates (modified radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer) were incubated with 4.0 μg/ml mouse anti-FLAG or anti-E tag monoclonal antibody and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting, interactions were detected using anti-FLAG or anti-E tag antibody as described above. Essential Role for the SOCS2 SOCS Box in Antagonizing SOCS1 and SOCS3 Inhibition of Cytokine Signaling—SOCS2 exerts a dual action on GH and PRL signaling and impairs the inhibitory effect of other SOCS proteins (26Favre H. Benhamou A. Finidori J. Kelly P.A. Edery M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 30Dif F. Saunier E. Demeneix B. Kelly P.A. Edery M. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 5286-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To gain more detailed insight in the underlying mechanism, we first analyzed the role of the different SOCS protein subdomains. The effect of constitutive expression of SOCS proteins on GH signaling was investigated in HEK293-T cells using the STAT5-responsive β-casein-derived luciferase reporter. Fig. 1A shows dose-response curves demonstrating complete inhibition of GH signaling by SOCS1 and SOCS3. GH-inducible activity was fully inhibited by low concentrations of either SOCS1 or SOCS3, i.e. concentrations below the level of antibody detection as judged by Western blot analysis of the FLAG-tagged SOCS constructs using anti-FLAG antibody. After removal of the SOCS boxes of SOCS1 (SOCS1Δbox) and SOCS3 (SOCS3Δbox), inhibition was slightly reduced but not abolished in this assay system. Coexpression of SOCS2 completely suppressed the SOCS1- and SOCS3-dependent inhibition of GH signaling (Fig. 1, B and C), whereby SOCS1 inhibition appeared to be more sensitive to the counteracting effect of SOCS2 compared with SOCS3. Of note, the amounts of SOCS1 used in this experiment could not be visualized by Western blot analysis, indicating that the working concentrations were approaching the physiological concentrations of this SOCS protein. The SOCS2 amounts were also not supraphysiological, as the SOCS2 concentration at which a cross-regulatory effect was observed was comparable with the endogenous level of SOCS2 in the GH-responsive mouse 3T3-F442A preadipocyte cell line (Fig. 1D). This suppressive effect on SOCS molecules was specific for SOCS2, as coexpression of CIS did not interfere with SOCS1- or SOCS3-mediated inhibition (data not shown). Strikingly, this effect of SOCS2 depended strictly on the presence of its SOCS box. Of note, the deletion of the SOCS box led to enhanced expression in the case of SOCS2. This effect was also observed, albeit to a lesser extent, with SOCS1, but was not observed for SOCS3. We next evaluated whether we could extrapolate this SOCS2 regulation to other receptor systems. SOCS1 and SOCS3 have been implicated as potent inhibitors of IFN type I receptor signaling (40Sakamoto H. Yasukawa H. Masuhara M. Tanimura S. Sasaki A. Yuge K. Ohtsubo M. Ohtsuka A. Fujita T. Oht"
https://openalex.org/W1973450282,"Puzzlingly, the parent bodies of ordinary chondrites (the most abundant type of meteorites) do not seem to be abundant among asteroids. One possible explanation is that surfaces of the parent bodies become optically altered, to become the S-type asteroids which are abundant in the main asteroid belt. The process is called 'space weathering'-it makes the visible and near-infrared reflectance spectrum of a body darker and redder. A recent survey of small, near-Earth asteroids suggests that the surfaces of small S asteroids may have developing stages of space weathering. Here we report that a dark region on a small (550-metre) asteroid-25143 Itokawa-is significantly more space-weathered than a nearby bright region. Spectra of both regions are consistent with those of LL5-6 chondrites after continuum removal. A simple calculation suggests that the dark area has a shorter mean optical path length and about 0.04 per cent by volume more nanophase metallic iron particles than the bright area. This clearly shows that space-weathered materials accumulate on small asteroids, which are likely to be the parent bodies of LL chondrites. We conclude that, because LL meteorites are the least abundant of ordinary (H, L, and LL) chondrites, there must be many asteroids with ordinary-chondrite compositions in near-Earth orbits."

The latter generates a C-terminal intracellular fragment that harbors the nuclear localization signal KRKVSRLAVTGERTATPAPKIPRIT and translocates to the nucleus. Proteolytic cleavage of fibrocystin occurs constitutively in long term cultures of polarized inner medullary collecting duct cells (mIMCD-3).

ARPKD affects 1 in 20,000 individuals and is characterized by aberrant epithelial cell proliferation, which causes cystic dilation of the renal collecting ducts, and abnormal development of intrahepatic bile ducts (1Lieberman E. Salinas-Madrigal L. Gwinn J.L. Brennan L.P. Fine R.N. Landing B.H. Medicine (Baltimore). 1971; 50: 277-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Affected individuals present with bilateral kidney enlargement, intrauterine kidney failure, and oligohydramnios; the latter causes pulmonary hypoplasia and limb and facial abnormalities. Children who survive the perinatal period or develop ARPKD later in life develop chronic kidney disease and portal hypertension due to congenital hepatic fibrosis. ARPKD is caused by mutations of the polycystic kidney and hepatic disease gene 1 (PKHD1) located on chromosome 6 (2Zerres K. Mucher G. Bachner L. Deschennes G. Eggermann T. Kaariainen H. Knapp M.

Fibrocystin is an ∼500,000 dalton type I membrane protein comprised of a large N-terminal ectodomain, a single transmembrane segment, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The ectodomain contains arrays of IPT (Ig-like, plexins, transcription factors) domains and PbH1 (parallel β-helix repeats) domains. The structure of fibrocystin suggests that it may function as a receptor for an as yet unidentified ligand. However, the authentic function of fibrocystin and the mechanism of signal transduction remain unknown. Recent studies suggest that the molecular pathogenesis of PKD may involve primary cilia and associated Ca2+-dependent signaling (6Nauli S.M. Alenghat F.J. Luo Y. Williams E. Vassilev P. Li X. Elia A.E. Lu W. Brown E.M. Quinn S.J. Ingber D.E. Zhou J. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). Primary cilia are present on the apical membrane of renal tubular epithelial cells, and bending of the cilia in response to fluid flow shear stress elicits an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]). Polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, which are affected in the autosomal dominant form of PKD, are located in primary cilia and are required for an initial Ca2+ influx that is triggered by fluid flow shear stress (6Nauli S.M. Alenghat F.J. Luo Y. Williams E. Vassilev P. Li X. Elia A.E. Lu W. Brown E.M. Quinn S.J. Ingber D.E. Zhou J. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the increase in [Ca2+]i is amplified by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. Inhibitors of intracellular Ca2+ release abolish the primary cilia-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i, which suggests that Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release is an obligatory step in the primary cilia signaling cascade (6Nauli S.M. Alenghat F.J. Luo Y. Williams E. Vassilev P. Li X. Elia A.E. Lu W. Brown E.M. Quinn S.J. Ingber D.E. Zhou J. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). Fibrocystin is located in the primary cilium as well as the basal body, which anchors the primary cilium in the cell body (7Masyuk T.V. Huang B.Q. Ward C.J. Masyuk A.I. Yuan D. Splinter P.L.

Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2703-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Together with some similarities in disease manifestations, the overlapping subcellular localization of fibrocystin and polycystins suggests that they may be involved in a common pathway. However, so far, no such pathway has been described. Recent studies suggest that ciliary signaling may involve the regulated proteolysis of polycystin-1. Polycystin-1 undergoes regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP), which releases a C-terminal fragment that translocates to the nucleus. Disruption of primary cilia formation causes the accumulation of the fragment in the nucleus, where it affects AP-1 activity. The C-terminal fragment of polycystin-1 has also been shown to interact with STAT6 and the coactivator p100 in the nucleus. Here we show that fibrocystin undergoes regulated proteolytic cleavage releasing a cytoplasmic fragment that translocates to the nucleus. We identify factors that are necessary and sufficient to trigger proteolytic cleavage, and we define a nuclear translocation signal located within the cytoplasmic portion of fibrocystin. Reagents and Antibodies—Dantrolene, caffeine, ruthenium red, calphostin, thapsigargin, carbachol, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were from Sigma. Mifepristone and anti-V5 antibody were from Invitrogen. Monoclonal mouse anti-fibrocystin antibody was described previously (10Ward C.J. Yuan D. Masyuk T.V. Wang X. Punyashthiti R. Whelan S. Bacallao R. Torra R. LaRusso N.F. Torres V.E. Harris P.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2703-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). To generate rabbit anti-fibrocystin serum (IgG8739), rabbits were immunized with a polyacrylamide gel-purified glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of mouse fibrocystin (amino acids 3869-4060). Plasmids—cDNA encoding full-length (12,225 bp) human fibrocystin was assembled from 12 PCR fragments that were synthesized using human kidney cDNA as template and verified by sequencing. A V5 epitope tag was attached in-frame to the C terminus by removing the stop codon and inserting the DNA fragment into pcDNA3.1-V5/His (Invitrogen). The resultant plasmid was termed pFC-V5. The plasmid pGeneFC was created by inserting the fibrocystin coding region into pGene/V5 (Invitrogen). Inserting a cDNA encoding EGFP into pGene generated the plasmid pGeneEGFP. The plasmid pSwitch was from Invitrogen. To construct the plasmid pFCA-EGFP, a PCR fragment encoding the C terminus of mouse fibrocystin (amino acids 3876-4059) was inserted 5′ to the EGFP coding region of pEGFP. Subsequently, the DNA fragment encoding FCA-EGFP was excised and inserted into pcDNA3.1. To construct the plasmid pFCA-DsRed, the EGFP coding region in pFCA-EGFP was replaced with a DNA fragment encoding DsRed2 (Clontech). The plasmids pEGFP-FC(3876-4059), pEGFP-FC(3876-3970), pEGFP-FC(3973-4031), pEGFP-FC(4043-4059), pEGFP-FC(3876-3940) pEGFP-FC3941-3970), pEGFP-FC(3946-3951), pEGFP-FC(3946-3954), pEGFP-FC(3941-3951), pEGFP-FC(3952-3970), pEGFP-FC(3949-3970), pEGFP-FC(3946-3970), and pEGFP-FC(3941-3963) were generated by inserting DNA encoding the corresponding regions of mouse fibrocystin into pEGFP-C3. To construct the plasmids pFC(3973-4031)-V5 and pFC(3875-3970)-V5, PCR fragments encoding the corresponding regions of mouse fibrocystin were cloned into pcDNA3.1-V5/His. The plasmid pLDLR-GV encoding the human low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) fused at its C terminus to Gal4-VP16 was a generous gift from Dr. Thomas Südhof (University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, TX). The plasmid pFC-GV was generated by inserting the Gal4-VP16 coding sequence into the ApaI site of human fibrocystin (at codon 3918). The pG5-luc reporter plasmid was a generous gift from Richard Baer (Columbia University, New York, NY) (11Yu X. Wu L.C. Bowcock A.M. Aronheim A. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25388-25392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The plasmids pEF-neo and pEF-PKCαA/E were generous gifts from Gottfried Baier (Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—mIMCD-3 cells were plated at a density of 500,000 cells/100-mm dish, and 24 and 48 h later, the cells were transfected with 2 μg of pFC-V5 using Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Cells were incubated for an additional 72 h and lysed in 100 μl of buffer containing Tris-buffered saline, 0.5% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture (Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.). Twenty μl of the lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot analysis was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-V5 as described previously (12Hiesberger T. Shao X. Gourley E. Reimann A. Pontoglio M. Igarashi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10578-10586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). mIMCD3/FC and mIMCD3/EGFP cell lines with inducible expression of fibrocystin and EGFP, respectively, were produced by transfecting mIMCD-3 cells with 1.5 μg of pSwitch and either 1.5 μg of pGeneFC or 1.5 μg of pGeneEGFP. Stable transfectants were isolated after 14 days of growth in medium containing hygromycin (350 μg/ml) and zeocin (300 μg/ml). To test for inducible expression, cells derived from individual clones were treated with mifepristone (10 nm) for 48 h or left untreated, and proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG. HEK-293 cells stably transfected with the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 were a generous gift from Trevor Shuttleworth (University of Rochester Medical Center) (13Yang J. Williams J.A. Yule D.I. Logsdon C.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 477-485PubMed Google Scholar). Reporter Gene Assays—mIMCD-3 cells, HEK-293 cells, or HeLa cells were plated in 6-well dishes (3 × 105 cells/well) and cotransfected with 0.05 μg of phRL-TK(Int-) encoding Renilla luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI), 0.1 μg of Photinus luciferase reporter plasmids, and 0.01-0.3 μg of effector plasmids. Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (14Hiesberger T. Bai Y. Shao X. McNally B.T. Sinclair A.M. Tian X. Somlo S. Igarashi P. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 814-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Relative luciferase activity was calculated as the ratio of Photinus and Renilla luciferase. Subcellular Fractionation—Fractions containing nuclear proteins, cell membrane proteins, or soluble proteins were generated essentially as described previously (15DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Li W.P. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 1999; 99: 703-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Successful fractionation was confirmed by the distribution of the membrane protein polycystin-2 and the nuclear protein proliferating cell nuclear antigen. To concentrate nuclear proteins, nuclear extract was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Immunofluorescence and Microscopy—MDCK cells were grown in 6-well dishes and transfected with plasmids using Effectene. Twenty-four or 48 h later, cells were fixed with acetone/methanol (1:1) and subjected to fluorescence microscopy. Paraffin-embedded kidney sections were deparaffinated and rehydrated. Immunofluorescence was performed using anti-fibrocystin (2B) and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Images were obtained by deconvolution microscopy (Zeiss Axioplane-2, Openlab). Proteolysis of Fibrocystin Produces a C-terminal Nuclear Fragment—A 12,225-bp DNA fragment encoding human fibrocystin was assembled from 12 PCR fragments, cloned into the mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA3.1, and verified by sequencing. To facilitate detection of the recombinant protein, a C-terminal V5 epitope tag was added, and the resultant plasmid was termed pFC-V5. Mouse inner medullary collecting duct cells (mIMCD-3), which endogenously express native fibrocystin (14Hiesberger T. Bai Y. Shao X. McNally B.T. Sinclair A.M. Tian X. Somlo S. Igarashi P. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 814-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), were transfected with pFC-V5 or empty pcDNA3.1, and cellular proteins were analyzed after 3 days. Immunoblotting utilizing an antibody directed against the C-terminal V5 epitope tag revealed a high molecular weight band corresponding to full-length fibrocystin as well as a series of proteolytic fragments (Fig. 1A). To further investigate the proteolytic cleavage of fibrocystin, we generated mIMCD3/FC cells in which the expression of recombinant human fibrocystin can be induced by treatment with mifepristone. Immunoblot analysis of cells expressing recombinant fibrocystin revealed the presence of proteolytic fragments similar to those seen in transient transfection experiments (Fig. 1B). The approximate sites of proteolytic cleavage of fibrocystin were estimated from the molecular weights of the proteolytic fragments. Since the cytoplasmic domain of human fibrocystin including the epitope tag has a calculated molecular mass of 25 kDa, the 21-kDa fragment (Fig. 1B, FCA) is likely produced by cleavage in the cytoplasmic domain close to the transmembrane region. Proteolytic fragments of fibrocystin that retain the membrane-spanning segment as well as the C-terminal V5 epitope tag have a minimal molecular mass of 27.5 kDa, suggesting that fragments named FCC to FCF were generated by proteolytic cleavage in the ectodomain of fibrocystin. The site of cleavage producing the fragment named FCB may be within the transmembrane segment. To determine the subcellular localization of the proteolytic fragments, we prepared membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear extracts and analyzed the proteins by immunoblotting. Fragments that were calculated to contain the transmembrane domain (FCC to FCF) were found in the membrane fraction, as expected (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the 21-kDa fragment containing the C terminus of fibrocystin was detected in the nuclear fraction. This result suggests that the cytoplasmic domain of fibrocystin undergoes proteolytic cleavage, releasing a 21-kDa fragment that translocates to the nucleus. In some experiments, FCA appeared as well as doublet, suggesting that it may undergo additional cleavage or posttranslational modification (Fig. 1B, FCA and FCA*). The fragment FCB was found in the nuclear fraction and the membrane fraction but only after very long exposure of the fluorograms, suggesting that FCB is unstable or is lost during subcellular fractionation (data not shown). To test whether endogenous fibrocystin undergoes proteolytic processing producing a nuclear fragment, nuclear extracts of mIMCD-3 cells were analyzed by immunoblotting. A polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal domain of fibrocystin recognized a protein corresponding in size to FCA (Fig. 1C). The 21-kDa fragment was detected using two different antibodies raised against the C-terminal domain of fibrocystin (not shown). Minor, smaller peptides were also detected, raising the possibility that endogenous FCA is subjected to further endoproteolytic processing (Fig. 1C, asterisk). Cytoplasmic Domain of Fibrocystin Contains a Nuclear Localization Signal—To determine the localization of the cytoplasmic domain of fibrocystin in vivo, kidney sections of 21-day old mice were stained with an antibody specific for the cytoplasmic region of the protein. Antibody staining confirmed that the cytoplasmic domain of fibrocystin was located in the nuclei of renal tubular epithelial cells (Fig. 2A). The cytoplasmic domain was also found in the cytosol as well as the primary cilia when the cells were observed in a different focal plane (data not shown). Interestingly, the fibrocystin staining in the nucleus exhibited a speckled pattern. To define the mechanism of nuclear localization, the cytoplasmic domain of fibrocystin was linked to EGFP or DsRed and expressed in MDCK cells. The subcellular localization of the fusion proteins was determined by fluorescence microscopy. A recombinant protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of fibrocystin (amino acids 3876-4059) and EGFP was located exclusively in the nucleus, whereas EGFP by itself was predominantly in the cytosol (Fig. 2B). Similarly, a fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of fibrocystin and DsRed was located in the nucleus. Like endogenous fibrocystin, the fusion proteins were not diffusely distributed in the nucleus but were concentrated in structures that had a speckled subnuclear distribution. To identity the nuclear structures, cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the cytoplasmic domain fused to DsRed, and the nucleoli were counter-stained with an RNA-specific stain. Co-staining demonstrated that the fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic domain were located in nucleoli (Fig. 2C). To identify the region within the cytoplasmic domain of fibrocystin that is required for nuclear localization, plasmids encoding EGFP fused to the N-terminal portion (amino acids 3876-3970), the central portion (amino acids 3973-4031), and the C-terminal portion (amino acids 4043-4059) of the cytoplasmic domain were transfected into MDCK cells. Only an EGFP fusion protein containing the N-terminal portion was located in the nucleus, whereas fusion proteins containing the central or C-terminal portions remained in the cytosol (Fig. 3A). To verify these findings using a different cell type and method, plasmids encoding the V5 epitope-tagged N-terminal portion and central portion of the cytoplasmic domain were transfected into HEK-293 cells. Immunoblot analysis of nuclear and cytosolic fractions revealed that the N-terminal portion but not the central portion was present in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 3B). To further define the sequence mediating nuclear localization, plasmids encoding various regions of the cytoplasmic domain of fibrocystin fused to EGFP were generated, and the subcellular localizations of the fusion proteins were evaluated. These experiments defined the minimal nuclear localization signal (NLS) to be KRKVSRLAVTGERTATPAPKIPRIT (Fig. 3C). Further deletions within this sequence abolished nuclear localization. Intracellular Ca2+ Release Is Necessary and Sufficient to Trigger Fibrocystin Proteolysis—To determine whether the proteolytic cleavage of fibrocystin is affected by changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, mIMCD3/FC cells were pretreated with thapsigargin prior to induction of fibrocystin expression. Pretreatment with 0.1 μm thapsigargin to deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores (16Young H.S. Stokes D.L. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 198: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) abolished the generation of the FCA fragment (Fig. 4A). Similarly, depletion of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores by pretreatment with 5 mm caffeine also prevented the generation of FCA (Fig. 4A). Pretreatment with 200 μm ruthenium red, a nonspecific Ca2+ channel inhibitor, or treatment with 75 μm dantrolene, which interferes with ryanodine receptor (RyR)-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release, abolished the formation of FCA (Fig. 4A). To quantitatively measure fibrocystin cleavage, we developed a luciferase assay similar to the ones employed to quantify the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) (17Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 18May P. Bock H.H. Nimpf J. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37386-37392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A plasmid (FC-GV) encoding the synthetic transcription factor Gal4-VP16 fused to the C terminus of fibrocystin was generated. Proteolytic cleavage of the fibrocystin fusion protein releases Gal4-VP16, which translocates to the nucleus and activates a Gal4-responsive luciferase reporter gene (pG5-luc). Therefore, luciferase expression correlates with fibrocystin cleavage. Transfection of mIMCD-3 cells with a plasmid encoding FC-GV stimulated luciferase activity 2.6-fold when compared with cells expressing LDLR-GV (low density lipoprotein receptor fused to Gal4-VP16), which is not subjected to proteolysis. The increase in luciferase activity was abolished in the presence of dantrolene, verifying that RyR activity was required for fibrocystin cleavage (Fig. 4B). To test whether intracellular Ca2+ release is not only required but is also sufficient to induce fibrocystin proteolysis, we employed a short term cell culture system of human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293). These cells express RyR and exhibit an RyR-mediated increase of intracellular Ca2+ upon treatment with caffeine (19Querfurth H.W. Haughey N.J. Greenway S.C. Yacono P.W. Golan D.E. Geiger J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, no proteolytic fragments of transiently transfected fibrocystin were detected. However, the addition of caffeine induced dose-dependent proteolysis of fibrocystin (Fig. 4C). Caffeine-induced fibrocystin proteolysis was prevented by treatment with the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor calphostin C. This latter result indicated a possible role of PKC in the Ca2+-induced cleavage of fibrocystin. To quantify fibrocystin proteolysis in response to intracellular Ca2+ release, the luciferase reporter assay was employed. HEK-293 cells were cotransfected with the plasmids pFC-GV and pG5-luc and incubated with either 5 mm caffeine or vehicle (as a control). Treatment with caffeine increased luciferase activity 10-fold, confirming that pharmacological stimulation of intracellular Ca2+ release was sufficient to induce fibrocystin cleavage (Fig. 3D). Next, we tested whether fibrocystin cleavage could be induced by activation of a cell surface receptor that stimulates intracellular Ca2+ release. These experiments utilized HEK-293 cells stably expressing the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor m3 (HEK-293(m3)), which respond to treatment with the agonist carbachol with activation of phospholipase C and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated Ca2+ release (20Schmidt M. Huwe S.M. Fasselt B. Homann D. Rumenapp U. Sandmann J. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Exposure to 5 mm caffeine triggered fibrocystin proteolysis in both HEK-293 cells and HEK-293(m3) cells, whereas treatment with 100 μm carbachol induced fibrocystin cleavage only in HEK-293(m3) cells (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these results demonstrate that stimulation of intracellular Ca2+ release is sufficient to trigger fibrocystin cleavage. Activation of PKC Is Necessary and Sufficient for the Generation of FCA—The inhibition of fibrocystin proteolysis in the presence of the PKC inhibitor calphostin C suggested an involvement of members of the group of conventional PKC (PKCα, PKCβ1, PKCβ2, or PKCγ). To test whether activation of PKC is sufficient to induce fibrocystin cleavage, HEK-293 cells were transfected with pFC-V5 and exposed to activators of protein kinases. Treatment with PMA, an activator of PKC, produced a marked increase of proteolytic cleavage, which was prevented by pretreatment with calphostin C (Fig. 5A). In contrast, no cleavage was observed when cells were left untreated or treated with the protein kinase A activator 8-bromo-cAMP. However, besides inducing proteolysis, PMA also increased the total expression of fibrocystin, controlled by the cytomegalovirus promoter, which made it difficult to unequivocally correlate PKC activation with fibrocystin cleavage. To address this issue, we used two additional approaches: (i) replacement of the PKC-responsive cytomegalovirus promoter and (ii) genetic activation of PKC. mIMCD3/FC cells, in which fibrocystin is expressed under the control of a mifepristone-responsive promoter, were treated with calphostin C 24 h after induction, and cleavage was analyzed 30 h later. Treatment with calphostin C did not alter expression levels of fibrocystin but produced a dose-dependent inhibition of fibrocystin proteolysis (Fig. 5B). Next, we employed a constitutively active pseudosubstrate mutant of PKCα (PKCαA/E) (21Baier-Bitterlich G. Uberall F. Bauer B. Fresser F. Wachter H. Grunicke H. Utermann G. Altman A. Baier G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1842-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cotransfection of a plasmid encoding PKCαA/E resulted in fibrocystin proteolysis and generation of FCA, whereas cotransfection of empty expression plasmid did not affect processing (Fig. 5C). The presence or absence of fetal calf serum did not markedly affect cleavage. To quantify the cleavage of fibrocystin stimulated by PKC activation, luciferase reporter assays were performed. HEK-293 cells were cotransfected with pFC-GV and pG5-luc, and PKC activity was stimulated by treatment with PMA or expression of the PKCαA/E mutant. Fibrocystin proteolysis was evaluated by measuring luciferase activity. Treatment with PMA increased luciferase activity 27-fold, whereas the addition of 8-bromo-cAMP did not significantly affect luciferase activity. Co-expression of PKCαA/E stimulated luciferase activity 19-fold but had no effect on cells expressing the negative control LDLR-GV (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that fibrocystin-specific proteolysis is PKC-dependent. The data presented here indicate that fibrocystin is subjected to site-specific proteolytic cleavage. At least six different fragments that contain the C terminus of fibrocystin are generated. Although the abundance of the larger proteolytic fragments varied under different experimental conditions, a 21-kDa fragment (FCA) was consistently observed. The 21-kDa fragment contains most of the cytoplasmic domain of fibrocystin and was primarily observed in the nucleus. In contrast, full-length fibrocystin has been localized primarily in the primary cilium, basal body region, and apical plasma membrane, and to a lesser degree, in the cytoplasm. These findings suggest that fibrocystin undergoes regulated proteolysis releasing a cytoplasmic C-terminal fragment that translocates from the cilium, apical membrane, or cytoplasm to the nucleus. The protease that mediates fibrocystin cleavage remains unidentified, but inhibitor studies suggest that it is not γ-secretase or calpain (data not shown). Similar to other proteins that are subjected to regulated proteolysis, only a small fraction of fibrocystin appears to be cleaved. In particular, the pattern of proteolytic cleavage (close proximity to the transmembrane domain, nuclear translocation of the resulting cytoplasmic fragment) resembles RIP of other type I membrane proteins. Nuclear signaling of cytoplasmic fragments generated by RIP is most extensively described for Notch but also found in the case of APP, ErbB4, NRG-1, CD44, N-cadherin, and lipoprotein receptor-related protein (22Landman N. Kim T.W. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). RIP controls vital signaling mechanisms that are crucial for regulatory processes and disease pathogenesis. Often, the cleavage releasing the nuclear fragment is preceded by an obligatory proteolytic event in the ectodomain of the protein. It is conceivable that the proteolytic cleavage occurring in the ectodomain of fibrocystin is also required for a subsequent step that releases the cytoplasmic fragment. Polycystin-1, a protein affected in the autosomal dominant form of PKD, was found to be subjected to proteolysis in a manner consistent with RIP. Proteolysis of polycystin-1, similar to proteolysis of fibrocystin, generates a C-terminal cytoplasmic fragment that translocates to the nucleus upon release. The C-terminal cytoplasmic fragment of polycystin-1 has been shown to regulate AP-1 activation, Na,K-ATPase activity, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, the latter via direct interaction with tuberin. In addition, the polycystin-1 C-terminal cytoplasmic fragment interacts with STAT6 and the coactivator p100 and stimulates STAT6-dependent transcription. However, overexpression of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of fibrocystin had no effect on AP-1- or STAT-dependent reporter genes (data not shown), which suggests that at least some of the functions of the cytoplasmic domains of polycystin-1 and fibrocystin are distinct. We identified the minimal nuclear localization sequence within the FCA fragment of fibrocystin to be KRKVSRLAVTGERTATPAPKIPRIT. This sequence mildly resembles a bipartite NLS, which is characterized by two stretches of basic amino acids that are usually separated by a 10-12-amino-acid-long cluster (23Jans D.A. Xiao C.Y. Lam M.H. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Interestingly, FCA appears not to be uniformly distributed in the nucleus but accumulates specifically in the nucleolus. Nucleoli are the site of rDNA transcription, assembly of ribosomes, and biogenesis of small ribonucleoprotein particles and influence cell cycle progression and transcription by sequestering specific trans-acting factors (24Leung A.K. Lamond A.I. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 2003; 13: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The nucleolar localization of FCA suggests that fibrocystin may play an important role in regulating these processes. Several lines of evidence indicate that the release of intracellular Ca2+ is a prerequisite for fibrocystin proteolysis. Constitutive cleavage of fibrocystin observed in a long term cell culture system could be prevented by pharmacological inhibition of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. No cleavage of fibrocystin was observed under basal conditions in a short term cell culture system, but cleavage and nuclear translocation could be induced by pharmacological or receptor-mediated stimulation of intracellular Ca2+ release. These findings suggest that signaling cascades that affect [Ca2+]i might act as central regulators or mediators of fibrocystin cleavage. One Ca2+-dependent signaling cascade that is considered to be central in the development of polycystic kidney disease involves primary cilia. Primary cilia located on the apical surface of renal tubular epithelial cells are involved in sensing luminal fluid flow. Shear stress, caused by the flow of fluid across the epithelial cell layer, bends the cilium and triggers an increase in [Ca2+]i. Proteolytic cleavage of polycystin-1 appears to involve primary cilia. The loss of primary cilia or obstruction of fluid flow results in the accumulation of the polycystin-1 C-terminal cytoplasmic fragment in the nucleus. It is possible that primary cilia are also involved in the regulation of fibrocystin proteolysis. Fibrocystin proteolysis was observed in long term cultures of mIMCD-3 cells, which form primary cilia, and no cleavage was observed in short term HEK-293 cell cultures, which lack primary cilia. However, no effect of fluid flow on fibrocystin cleavage has been detected (data not shown). Therefore, further experimentation will be required to clarify the role of primary cilia and the flow-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i on fibrocystin cleavage. Cleavage of fibrocystin is stimulated by activation of PKC. Studies using PKC activators, the PKC-specific inhibitor calphostin C, and a constitutively active PKC mutant indicate that activation of PKC is necessary and sufficient to cause fibrocystin proteolysis. Activation of PKC can circumvent the requirement for release of intracellular Ca2+, indicating that PKC activation is likely to be downstream to Ca2+ release. Conventional PKCs are activated by intracellular Ca2+ release and represent potential downstream effectors of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. Although it is not clear how activation of PKC triggers fibrocystin cleavage, one possibility is that PKC regulates the trafficking of intracellular vesicles, allowing fibrocystin to interact with the protease. Interestingly, PKC activation is also involved in the processing of APP. Modulators of PKC activity have been shown to alter APP processing and reduce the levels of β-amyloid in animal models (25Etcheberrigaray R. Tan M. Dewachter I. Kuiperi C. van der Auwera I. Wera S. Qiao L. Bank B. Nelson T.J. Kozikowski A.P. Van Leuven F. Alkon D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11141-11146Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Similarly, alteration of fibrocystin proteolysis achieved by pharmacological modulation of PKC activation or intracellular Ca2+ release might represent a possible therapeutic strategy to treat PKD. In summary, we propose a model in which cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and activation of PKC control a proteolytic process that leads to the release of the cytoplasmic C-terminal fragment of fibrocystin. Because of the presence of a NLS, the C-terminal fragment (FCA) is translocated to the nucleus. A role of fibrocystin in a signaling cascade is suggested by mechanistic similarities with other proteins subjected to RIP.

The similarity to the phenotypes of the Col2A1 knock-out and the disproportionate micromelia mutation suggests perlecan involvement in cartilage collagen matrix assembly. We now present a mechanism for the defect in collagen type II fibril assembly by perlecan-null chondrocytes. Cartilage perlecan is a heparin sulfate or a mixed heparan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. The latter form binds collagen and accelerates fibril formation in vitro, with more defined fibril morphology and increased fibril diameters produced in the presence of perlecan. Interestingly, the enhancement of collagen fibril formation is independent on the core protein and is mimicked by chondroitin sulfate E but neither by chondroitin sulfate D nor dextran sulfate. Furthermore, perlecan chondroitin sulfate contains the 4,6-disulfated disaccharides typical for chondroitin sulfate E. Indeed, purified glycosaminoglycans from perlecan-enriched fractions of cartilage extracts contain elevated levels of 4,6-disulfated chondroitin sulfate disaccharides and enhance collagen fibril formation. The effect on collagen assembly is proportional to the content of the 4,6-disulfated disaccharide in the different cartilage extracts, with growth plate cartilage glycosaminoglycan being the most efficient enhancer. These findings demonstrate a role for perlecan chondroitin sulfate side chains in cartilage extracellular matrix assembly and provide an explanation for the perlecan-null chondrodysplasia.

Although identified as an HS proteoglycan, perlecan can also be partially substituted with chondroitin sulfate (CS) (9Govindraj P. West L. Koob T.J. Neame P. Doege K. Hassell J.R. J. Biol.

Watanabe H. Takami H. Hassell J.R. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 354-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 12Costell M. Gustafsson E. Aszódi A. Mörgelin M. Bloch W. Hunziker E. Addicks K. Timpl R. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1109-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Although mice lacking perlecan did develop grave disorders caused by compromised basement membrane strength or integrity (e.g. rupture of the pericardial sac), the initial assembly of basement membranes seemed to be without complication. Later studies have shown additional defects in the neuromuscular junctions (13Arikawa-Hirasawa E. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Yamada Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), hyperplasia of the conotruncal endocardial cushions, and transposition of the great arteries (14Costell M. Carmona R. Gustafsson E. Gonzalez-Iriarte M. Fassler R. Munoz-Chapuli R. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) in the perlecan-null mice. A most striking finding was the severe skeletal defects exhibited, apparently caused by the lack of perlecan in developing cartilage. Following the publication of these results, at least two human hereditary diseases with skeletal abnormalities have been ascribed to an underlying scarcity or complete lack of perlecan, underscoring the relevance of this finding in the mouse model (15Nicole S. Davoine C.S. Topaloglu H. Cattolico L. Barral D. Beighton P. Hamida C.B. Hammouda H. Cruaud C. White P.S. Samson D. Urtizberea J.A. Lehmann-Horn F. Weissenbach J. Hentati F. Fontaine B. Nat.

Genet. 2001; 27: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar).In skeletal development, the deposition of a cartilaginous template precedes the formation of bones through endochondral ossification. The integrity of this template is a prerequisite for proper development of the skeleton. In the perlecan-null mice, the growth plate of the bone anlagen is disorganized, and the whole templates appear bent and distorted. In addition, the cartilage shows fewer and less organized collagen type II fibrils as well as decreased levels of proteoglycan staining, indicating a failure to organize the extracellular matrix (12Costell M. Gustafsson E. Aszódi A. Mörgelin M. Bloch W. Hunziker E. Addicks K. Timpl R. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1109-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 17Gustafsson E. Aszodi A. Ortega N. Hunziker E.B. Denker H.W. Werb Z. Fassler R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 995: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).It has been suggested that this is due to impaired growth factor presentation and signaling in the absence of perlecan (11Arikawa-Hirasawa E. Watanabe H. Takami H. Hassell J.R. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 354-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). An alternative hypothesis is that the balance between collagen type II production and breakdown had shifted toward degradation in the perlecan-null mice (12Costell M. Gustafsson E. Aszódi A. Mörgelin M. Bloch W. Hunziker E. Addicks K. Timpl R. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1109-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Perlecan could, for example, protect the cartilage extracellular matrix from degradation by binding and regulating the activities of matrix metalloproteases (17Gustafsson E. Aszodi A. Ortega N. Hunziker E.B. Denker H.W. Werb Z. Fassler R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 995: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the similarity of the perlecan-null skeletal phenotype to those of the Col2A1 null mice and the disproportionate micromelia mice (that carry a mutation in the collagen type II C-propeptide) suggested that perlecan, rather than protecting against collagen degradation, could be involved in collagen type II matrix assembly.Mature collagen fibers may contain several different types of bound accessory proteins. They take part in the organization of these fibers and regulate links to other molecules, thereby contributing to the architecture of the fibrillar collagen network. Interestingly, some accessory molecules function as modulators that regulate the early steps in the assembly of collagen monomers to fibrils. For example, it has been found that extracellular matrix proteins, such as the tyrosine-rich acidic matrix protein (18MacBeath J.R. Shackleton D.R. Hulmes D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19826-19832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, 6K. Halász, M. Mörgelin, and D. Heinegård, unpublished data. 6K. Halász, M. Mörgelin, and D. Heinegård, unpublished data. accelerate the formation of collagen fibrils from monomers in vitro. Other molecules have the opposite effect and slow down fibril formation in vitro (e.g. decorin (19Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) and fibromodulin (20Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6898-6905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Apart from these accessory proteins, it is clear from several studies that other extracellular macromolecules, notably glycosaminoglycans, also may participate in regulating collagen fibril assembly (19Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 21Gavriel P. Kagan H.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2811-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Mathews M.B. Decker L. Biochem. J. 1968; 109: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Öbrink B. Eur. J.

The results from these investigations were, however, in some aspects contradictory, leaving some questions regarding the exact effects of these molecules.Gene targeting of decorin, fibromodulin, and other members of the small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan family leads to abnormal collagen fibrils and disturbed mechanical properties of the tissues (25Ameye L. Young M.F. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 107R-116RCrossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Thus, a picture is emerging where macromolecules in the vicinity of the cell regulate the early stages of collagen fibril formation.We now show that perlecan is involved in cartilage matrix assembly by enhancing collagen fibril formation. We found that chondrocytes from perlecan-null mice have an impaired ability to organize collagen to fibrils compared with wild-type chondrocytes. We also confirm that perlecan in growth plate cartilage is a CS/HS proteoglycan and that the CS chains on perlecan show a higher degree of sulfation than those of aggrecan. Furthermore, the CS/HS-substituted perlecan binds collagen and greatly enhances the rate of fibril formation of collagen types I and II in vitro, whereas neither the HS-substituted form nor the core protein had any effect. We also show that CS-E, unlike other glycosaminoglycans tested, mimics the effect of perlecan. Finally, we confirm that CS purified from perlecan-containing fractions of cartilage extracts is enriched in 4,6-sulfated disaccharides and enhances collagen fibril formation. This suggests a mechanism for some of the skeletal defects seen in perlecan-null mice and human chondrodysplasias resulting from mutation of the perlecan gene (HSPG2).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of Chondrocytes—Perlecan-deficient mice (12Costell M. Gustafsson E. Aszódi A. Mörgelin M. Bloch W. Hunziker E. Addicks K. Timpl R. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1109-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) were kept in accordance with local regulations. Null embryos and wild-type littermates (embryonic day 18.5) were dissected into ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and decapitated. Thereafter, the rib cages were isolated, and individual ribs were dissected. After a 20–30-min initial collagenase digestion at 37 °C (Worthington grade 2; 2 mg/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax-1, penicillin, and streptomycin), the ribs were dissected free from remaining muscle tissue, perichondrium, and bone, transferred to fresh collagenase, and digested for 4 h at 37 °C. The digested tissue was pipetted into a single cell suspension, sieved through a 70-μm mesh, and diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal calf serum. After washing away the collagenase by centrifugation, the cells were seeded (30,000 cells/cm2) and expanded in monolayer culture for a period shorter than 2 weeks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum before transferring to alginate culture (see below).Alginate Bead Culture—Chondrocytes were taken into suspension by trypsin/EDTA digestion of the monolayer culture and embedded in alginate beads (26Guo J.F. Jourdian G.W. MacCallum D.K. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 19: 277-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were resuspended (105 cells/ml) in Ham's F-12 medium and mixed with an equal volume 2% alginate in 0.15 m NaCl prewarmed to 37 °C. Alginate beads were formed through dropping the cell suspension into 102 mm CaCl2 in 0.15 m NaCl through a 23-gauge needle. After 10 min, the beads were washed twice in Ham's F-12 medium and finally cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 containing 5% fetal calf serum with penicillin and streptomycin.Immunofluorescence Staining—Alginate bead cultures were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 95% ethanol with 1% acetic acid, dehydrated in 99.5% ethanol and xylene, and embedded in low melting temperature paraffin. Sections (5 μm) were deparaffinated and rehydrated in alcohols, and nonspecific antibody binding was blocked with 1% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The sections were stained with mouse monoclonal antibody M2 139 against rat collagen type II (27Mo J.A. Holmdahl R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2440-2448PubMed Google Scholar) in 1% donkey normal serum followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies preadsorbed against immunoglobulins from other species than the primary target antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). The fluorescence was documented through a ×100 Plan-Neofluar (numerical aperture 1.30) oil immersion objective in an Axioplan 2 imaging microscope equipped with an Axiocam HR digital camera using the Axiovision 4.2 software (Carl Zeiss). The TIFF files were identically adjusted using the Level tool in Photoshop 7.0.Transmission Electron Microscopy—Alginate cultures were sequentially washed in serum-free Ham's F-12 medium and twice in cacodylate-Ca buffer (0.15 m sodium cacodylate, 25 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) and fixed overnight at room temperature in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 1.5% paraformaldehyde in cacodylate-Ca buffer. After washing four times in cacodylate-Ca buffer, the beads were postfixed for 2 h at room temperature in 1% OsO4, 25 mm CaCl2, dehydrated through 50, 70, 96%, and 99.5% ethanol (2 × 15 min each) and acetone (2 × 5 min), and embedded in Epon resin. Sections (50 nm) were cut using an ultramicrotome with a diamond knife, and structures were visualized in a Jeol JEM 1230 transmission electron microscope and captured with a Gatan Multiscan 791 digital camera.Extraction and Partial Purification of Cartilage Perlecan—Calf legs were obtained from the local abattoir, and the articular cartilage and distal growth plate of the metacarpal bone were dissected and immediately frozen on dry ice. After pulverization in liquid nitrogen, the cartilage from 20 calf bones was extracted with 12 ml of extraction buffer (4 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8, containing 5 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 0.1 m 6-aminohexanoic acid, and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide) per g of tissue powder at 4 °C for 24 h. After removing the remaining insoluble material by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, the proteins and proteoglycans in the extracts were fractionated by CsCl density gradient centrifugation with a starting density of 1.5 g/ml under dissociative conditions in 4 m guanidine hydrochloride as described elsewhere (28Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 319-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The gradient tube was divided into four equal fractions using a Beckman tube slicer, and aliquots of the fractions were analyzed for the presence of perlecan by Western blotting. The top fraction (D4) was found to contain perlecan and subjected to another dissociative CsCl density gradient centrifugation with a starting density of 1.35 g/ml and fractionated by slicing, and the resulting D4.D4 and D4.D3 fractions were found to contain perlecan by Western blotting.Analysis of Cartilage Perlecan Glycosaminoglycans—Aliquots of the top fraction from the sequential CsCl density gradient centrifugation of calf growth plate and calf articular cartilage extracts were dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm calcium acetate, 0.1% Triton X-100 and digested with chondroitinase ABC (protease-free; Seikagaku), heparitinase type III (Seikagaku), or a combination of both enzymes for 4 h at 37°C in the presence of 100 μg/ml ovomucoid and 100 μg/ml CS-6 carrier. The digested samples were separated by 3–10% gradient SDS-PAGE and stained by colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-perlecan antibodies.Extraction of Glycosaminoglycans from Bovine Cartilages—Guanidinium hydrochloride extraction of cow and calf articular cartilage and calf growth plate cartilage was performed as described above. Proteoglycans were subjected to a single dissociative CsCl centrifugation step (starting density 1.5 g/ml) and divided into four fractions. The fractions were extensively dialyzed against papain digestion buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.01 m EDTA, pH 6.5). After adding l-cysteine to a concentration of 0.01 m, papain was added (25 mg/ml), and the samples were incubated at 65 °C for 24 h. Glycosaminoglycans were isolated by anion exchange chromatography on a 1-ml bed volume HiTrap DEAE FF column (Amersham Biosciences) using a step gradient elution. Samples were loaded in Buffer A (0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.01 m EDTA, pH 6.5), after which papain and the majority of peptides were washed out with 5 column volumes of 0.57 m NaCl in buffer A. Glycosaminoglycans were subsequently eluted with 7 column volumes of 2 m NaCl in buffer A. The glycosaminoglycans were then precipitated with 10 volumes of 96% ethanol with 50 mm sodium acetate at 4 °C for 18 h followed by centrifugation and removal of residual solvent in a vacuum centrifuge. After resuspension in chondroitinase digestion buffer (100 mm Tris, 30 mm sodium acetate, pH 8.0), the samples were assayed for glycosaminoglycan content by the dimethylene blue assay as described by Farndale et al. (29Farndale R.W. Sayers C.A. Barrett A.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1982; 9: 247-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar).Recombinant Proteins—The recombinant perlecan domains and fragments were all expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 or 293-EBNA cells, as previously described (3Brown J.C. Sasaki T. Göhring W. Yamada Y. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 30Costell M. Mann K. Yamada Y. Timpl R. Eur. J.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and are shown schematically in Fig. 3. It became apparent during purification of the recombinant perlecan domain I that the cells produced two species of perlecan differing in their glycosaminoglycan (GAG) substitution. The perlecan domains synthesized were either substituted exclusively with HS or with both CS and HS (30Costell M. Mann K. Yamada Y. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Both these variants of perlecan are found in vivo.Surface Plasmon Resonance Studies—Type I collagen was immobilized to a level of 1000 resonance units on a C1 sensor-chip (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden) using amine coupling. A control surface was prepared in parallel by activating and deactivating the surface in an adjacent flow cell without adding protein. Recombinant perlecan domain I variants with HS (IA), CS/HS (IB), or no GAG substitution (Imut) at concentrations ranging from 17 to 68 nm in running buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Surfactant P20, pH 7.5) were injected over the surface at 20 μl/min for 180 s, and the association and dissociation were followed in a BIAcore 2000 instrument. The surface was regenerated by injecting 20 μl of 10 mm HEPES, 1 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.05% P20, pH 7.5.In Vitro Collagen Fibril Formation Assay—Bovine skin pepsin-extracted collagen type I (Vitrogen 100; Nutacon BV, Leimuiden, The Netherlands) and bovine pepsin-extracted tracheal cartilage collagen type II (19Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) were used in fibril formation assays (20Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6898-6905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a solution of collagen monomers (330 nm) was brought to neutral pH by the addition of an appropriate volume of 0.012 m NaOH and buffered by 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Perlecan fragments were added at concentrations equimolar to that of collagen or at one-tenth the molar concentration of collagen. After mixing vigorously and briefly, the samples were transferred to cuvettes and incubated at 37 °C (collagen type I) or 35 °C (collagen type II) in a water-jacketed cuvette holder in the spectrophotometer, and the absorbance due to light scattering at 400 nm (collagen type I) or 313 nm (collagen type II) was monitored over a duration of 5–18 h.In experiments with purified GAGs, the concentration of added carbohydrate was 0.78 μg/ml, equivalent to the amount of CS (measured as hexosamine) (30Costell M. Mann K. Yamada Y. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) on 33 nm perlecan domain IB. Bovine lung heparan sulfate was from Akzo-Nobel. Keratan-2-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, CS-4, and CS-6 were from the NIH Standard (33Rodén L. Baker J. Cifonelli A. Mathews M. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 73-140Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar), whereas CS-D and CS-E were from Seikagaku. An additional CS-D preparation was a kind gift from Dr. Nikos Karamanos. Dextran sulfate (∼4 sulfates/disaccharide eq) was from Amersham Biosciences.Hydroxyproline Assay—Collagen type I fibril formation reactions were performed as described above. Duplicate samples were incubated at 37 °C in screw cap 1.5-ml microtubes (Sarstedt). At each time point (0, 60, 120, and 180 min), samples were centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 30 min at room temperature, and the supernatants were transferred to fresh screw cap Eppendorf tubes. After hydrolysis in 6 m HCl (110 °C, 16 h), hydroxyproline was assayed as described (34Stegemann H. Stalder K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1967; 18: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar), and the concentration of collagen was calculated assuming a collagen type I hydroxyproline content of 13.4% (35Jackson D.S. Cleary E.G. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1967; 15: 25-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Negative Staining Electron Microscopy—Negative staining electron microscopy of collagen fibrils and data evaluation were performed as previously described (36Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Collagen fibril diameter measurements were performed using the interactive measurement tool of Axiovision 4.2 (Carl Zeiss). Raw data were obtained as width counted in number of pixels and was transformed to metric measurements.Chondroitin Sulfate Composition—Characterization of CS with regard to sulfation was performed according to Lauder et al. (37Lauder R.M. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were digested with 1 units/mg chondroitinase ABC (protease-free; Seikagaku) at 37 °C for 15 h. For disaccharide composition analysis of cartilage CS, purified glycosaminoglycans were digested with 1.7 units/mg each of chondroitinase ABC and chondroitinase ACII (protease-free; Seikagaku) at 37 °C for 24 h with a second addition of enzyme after 18 h. After inactivation of the enzyme (100 °C, 2 min) and reduction by sodium borohydride (final concentration 25 mm), the oligosaccharides were desalted on a Biogel P2 column equilibrated in 25 mm ammonium acetate, lyophilized, and dissolved in H2O. The oligosaccharides were separated at 1 ml/min on a 250 × 4-mm CarboPac PA-1 (Dionex) with a 50 × 4-mm precolumn maintained at 30 °C. The eluents used were 0.1 m NaOH (A) and 1.3 m NaCl (B) in 0.1 m NaOH, and the oligosaccharides were eluted with a gradient of 0 min/2% B to 12 min/2% B to 62 min/46% B to 70 min/87% B to 76 min/100% B to 80 min/100% B and detected by their absorbance at 232 nm. The elution position of reduced disaccharides was determined using standards (Seikagaku), and the relative abundance of different oligosaccharides was calculated by automatic integration of the peak area under curves.β-Elimination of CS-substituted Perlecan Domain I—Chondroitin sulfate-substituted perlecan domains I and V (IB and VB, respectively) in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4 (HBS), were incubated at 4 °C for 16 h with equal volumes of 0.5 m sodium hydroxide (final concentration 0.25 m NaOH). After removal of the sodium hydroxide by dialysis against the HBS buffer (Microdialyzer 100; Pierce), the samples were used in collagen fibril formation experiments.To confirm β-elimination, the GAG chains released from perlecan fragment IB were biotinylated on their reducing end and visualized by Western blotting. The GAGs were suspended in HBS, the sample pH was adjusted to 5.5 by the addition of 0.27 μl of 1.74 m acetic acid, and GAGs were biotinylated with EZ-Link LC biotin hydrazide (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Non-β-eliminated fragment IB in HBS was included as a control and subjected to pH correction and all subsequent steps in the biotinylation protocol. The biotinylated samples were precipitated at 4 °C for 16 h in 10 volumes of 96% ethanol with sodium acetate (50 mm) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and any remaining solvent was evaporated in a SpeedVac. After separation by SDS-PAGE (4–16%) and electrotransfer onto a 0.2-μm Fluorotrans polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PALL), the membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (DAKO) or with an anti-perlecan domain I antibody using chemiluminiscent detection.RESULTSPerlecan-null Chondrocytes Have Defective Collagen Networks—We were interested in determining whether perlecan-null chondrocytes"
https://openalex.org/W2049778382,"Neisseria gonorrhoeae survives anaerobically by reducing nitrite to nitrous oxide catalyzed by the nitrite and nitric oxide reductases, AniA and NorB. PaniA is activated by FNR (regulator of fumarate and nitrate reduction), the two-component regulatory system NarQ-NarP, and induced by nitrite; PnorB is induced by NO independently of FNR by an uncharacterized mechanism. We report the results of microarray analysis, bioinformatic analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation, which revealed that only five genes with readily identified NarP-binding sites are differentially expressed in narP+ and narP strains. These include three genes implicated in the truncated gonococcal denitrification pathway: aniA, norB, and narQ. We also report that (i) nitrite induces aniA transcription in a narP mutant; (ii) nitrite induction involves indirect inactivation by nitric oxide of a gonococcal repressor, NsrR, identified from a multigenome bioinformatic study; (iii) in an nsrR mutant, aniA, norB, and dnrN (encoding a putative reactive nitrogen species response protein) were expressed constitutively in the absence of nitrite, suggesting that NsrR is the only NO-sensing transcription factor in N. gonorrhoeae; and (iv) NO rather than nitrite is the ligand to which NsrR responds. When expressed in Escherichia coli, gonococcal NarQ and chimaeras of E. coli and gonococcal NarQ are ligand-insensitive and constitutively active: a “locked-on” phenotype. We conclude that genes involved in the truncated denitrification pathway of N. gonorrhoeae are key components of the small NarQP regulon, that NarP indirectly regulates PnorB by stimulating NO production by AniA, and that NsrR plays a critical role in enabling gonococci to evade NO generated as a host defense mechanism.

When expressed in Escherichia coli, gonococcal NarQ and chimaeras of E. coli and gonococcal NarQ are ligand-insensitive and constitutively active: a “locked-on” phenotype. We conclude that genes involved in the truncated denitrification pathway of N. gonorrhoeae are key components of the small NarQP regulon, that NarP indirectly regulates PnorB by stimulating NO production by AniA, and that NsrR plays a critical role in enabling gonococci to evade NO generated as a host defense mechanism. In contrast to Escherichia coli that can inhabit a variety of environments and utilize numerous carbon sources and electron acceptors, some niche dwellers such as the obligate human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae are far less versatile. The gonococcus can grow aerobically using glucose, lactate, or pyruvate as carbon sources and electron donors, and for many years it was thought to be an obligate aerobe. However, following the isolation of gonococci from patients alongside obligate anaerobes, it became clear that they could survive in the absence of oxygen in vivo using nitrite as an alternative electron acceptor (1Knapp J.S. Clark V.L. Infect. Immun. 1984; 46: 176-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Boulanger M.J. Murphy M.E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1111-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although gonococci express both a copper-containing nitrite reductase, AniA (NGO1276), and a single subunit nitric oxide reductase, NorB (NGO1275), which reduce nitrite via nitric oxide to nitrous oxide (2Boulanger M.J.

During oxygen-limited or anaerobic growth, AniA is the major anaerobically induced outer membrane protein (6Clark V.L. Campbell L.A. Palermo D.A. Evans T.M. Klimpel K.W. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is expressed by bacteria infecting patients, confirming that oxygen-limited conditions are encountered during pathogenesis (7Clark V.L. Knapp J.S. Thompson S. Klimpel K.W. Microb. Pathog. 1988; 5: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 8Cardinale J.A. Clark V.L. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4368-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because the gonococcus is capable of surviving oxygen limitation during colonization of the host, study of the gonococcal response to oxygen limitation is physiologically relevant to the pathogenesis of gonorrhea. Nitrite reduction via nitric oxide to nitrous oxide is clearly the critical biochemical pathway for this mode of survival.We previously reported that expression of aniA is activated by the oxygen-sensitive transcription regulator FNR 2The abbreviations used are: FNR, regulator of fumarate and nitrate reduction; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; NsrR, nitrosative stress response regulator; HAMP, histidine kinase, adenylate cyclase, methyl-accepting protein, and phosphotransferase domain; TMII, second transmembrane region; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; pON, probability that the probe-signal in that channel is genuine. 2The abbreviations used are: FNR, regulator of fumarate and nitrate reduction; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; NsrR, nitrosative stress response regulator; HAMP, histidine kinase, adenylate cyclase, methyl-accepting protein, and phosphotransferase domain; TMII, second transmembrane region; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; pON, probability that the probe-signal in that channel is genuine. (NGO1579) and by a two-component regulatory system that we designated NarQ-NarP (5Lissenden S. Mohan S. Overton T. Regan T. Crooke H. Cardinale J.A. Householder T.C. Adams P. O'Connor C.D. Clark V.L.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 541-551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although aniA transcription is further activated during growth in the presence of nitrite, but not nitrate (5Lissenden S. Mohan S. Overton T. Regan T. Crooke H. Cardinale J.A. Householder T.C. Adams P. O'Connor C.D. Clark V.L. Smith H. Cole J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 839-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it is unknown whether nitrite is sensed directly by NarQ or indirectly by another transcription factor. In contrast to aniA, expression of norB encoding the nitric oxide reductase is independent of FNR but is induced by nitric oxide by an unknown mechanism (4Householder T.C. Fozo E.M. Cardinale J.A. Clark V.L. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5241-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified members of the Rrf2 family of transcription factors that, in response to the availability of reactive nitrogen species, regulate expression of genes involved in denitrification and reactive nitrogen species metabolism (10Beaumont H.J. van Schooten B. Lens S.I. Westerhoff H.V. van Spanning R.J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Bodenmiller D.M. Spiro S. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A multigenome bioinformatic study identified a putative Rrf2 family member similar in sequence to the NsrR proteins of E. coli and Nitrosomonas europea in N. gonorrhoeae (12Rodionov D.A. Dubchak I.L. Arkin A.P. Alm E.J. Gelfand M.S. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1: e55Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The same study identified putative NsrR binding sites in the aniA promoter region (Fig. 1B) and in the regulatory regions of three other genes that include norB and dnrN (NGO0653), which is predicted to encode a reactive nitrogen species-responsive protein. We have therefore investigated the roles of NarQ-NarP and NsrR (NGO1519) in the regulation of the truncated denitrification pathway of the gonococcus. Evidence is presented that NO rather than nitrite is the signal to which NsrR responds and that, in the absence of NO, NsrR represses both aniA and norB transcription. Finally, we show that the gonococcal NarQ is insensitive to nitrite and apparently locked on in its sensor kinase mode.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains, Plasmids, Oligonucleotide Primers, and Gene Identification Numbers Used in This Study—Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1.

Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Primers NsrRA plus NsrRB and NsrRC plus NsrRD were used to generate DNA fragments upstream and downstream of the nsrR gene (NGO1519). The flanking fragments were cleaned and combined in a crossover PCR reaction with primers NsrRA and NsrRD, yielding a single fragment with an AgeI restriction site between the upstream and downstream sequences. The crossover PCR product was cloned into pGEM T-Easy, yielding pGEMNsrR. A kanamycin resistance cassette was amplified from pSUB11 by PCR using primers KanAgeIFwd and KanAgeIRev, which introduced AgeI sites at each end of the resultant fragment and was ligated into AgeI-digested pGEMNsrR, yielding pGEMNsrR-KO. The nsrR::kanR fragment was generated by digestion of pGEMNsrR-KO with EcoRI and was transformed, as previously described (5Lissenden S. Mohan S. Overton T. Regan T. Crooke H. Cardinale J.A. Householder T.C. Adams P. O'Connor C.D. Clark V.L. Smith H. Cole J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 839-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), into piliated N. gonorrhoeae strain F62, yielding strain JCGC751 and into strain RUG7036 (paniA::lacZ narP), yielding strain JCGC702. An aniA mutant was also generated. Primers AniAA plus AniAB and AniAC plus AniAD were used to amplify PCR products upstream and downstream of the aniA gene, which were cloned into pGEM T-Easy yielding pGEMAniAUP and pGEMAniADN. Candidate plasmids were screened for inserts in the correct orientation by double digestion with BamHI, engineered into the PCR products by primers AniAB and AniAC, and PstI, carried on pGEM T-Easy, such that pGEMA-niAUP contained BamHI and PstI sites at the 3′-end of the aniA upstream fragment, and pGEMAniADN contained a BamHI site at the 5′-end and a PstI site at the 3′-end of the aniA downstream fragment. The downstream fragment was ligated into BamHI- and PstI-digested pGEMAniAUP yielding pGEMAniA, containing the sequences upstream and downstream if the aniA gene separated by a BamHI site. A kanamycin resistance cassette was amplified from pSUB11 by PCR using primers KanBamHIFwd and KanBamHIRev, which introduced BamHI sites at each end, and was ligated into BamHI-digested pGEMAniA, forming pGEMAniA-KO. The resultant aniA::kanR construct generated by digesting pGEMAniA-KO with EcoRI was transformed into piliated N. gonorrhoeae strain F62, yielding strain JCGC703. Strain JCGC701 was generated by transforming strain F62 with an fnr::eryR cassette amplified from N. gonorrhoeae strain RUG7022 using primers FnrA and FnrB.Construction of a frdA::lacZ Reporter Strain—To construct the NarL-repressed frdA::lacZ reporter strain, the Lac– E. coli strain RV was first transduced with bacteriophage P1 that had been propagated on a strain carrying an frdA::lacZ fusion. Because strain RV cannot metabolize lactose, only Lac+ transductants were able to express β-galactosidase activity. Transductants were enriched during overnight growth in LB supplemented with lactose, streaked onto MacConkey-lactose agar and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Areas of growth showing a red, lactose-positive phenotype were streaked for purification by single colony isolation. Lac+ transductants were checked for repression of transcription from the frdA promoter during anaerobic growth in the presence, but not in the absence, of nitrate (17Stewart V. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The narX and narQ mutations were then introduced by successive rounds of transduction with bacteriophage P1 that had been propagated on insertion-deletion mutants that had been generated by the method of Datsenko and Wanner (18Datsenko K. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10966) Google Scholar), followed by curing of the antibiotic resistance determinant to leave unmarked deletions in narQ and narX as described previously (18Datsenko K. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10966) Google Scholar).Construction of Plasmids Expressing Gonococcal and E. coli narQP—To construct plasmid pBADgcQ, the gonococcal narQ gene was cloned into the arabinose-inducible pBAD myc-hisA overexpression vector using primers NgNarQNcoI and NgNarQHindIII to generate an NcoI-HindIII narQ fragment, which was ligated into NcoI/HindIII-digested pBAD myc-hisA (Invitrogen). Similarly, pBADecQ contained the E. coli narQ gene cloned into pBAD myc-hisA. Primers EcNarQHindIII and EcNarQ HindIII were used to generate an NcoI-BamHI E. coli narQ fragment, which was cloned into pBAD myc-hisA. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene) was used to generate specific mutations in narQ genes using primers listed in supplemental Table S1.Chimeric NarQ proteins were generated by introducing restriction sites into pBADgcQ and pBADecQ, restriction digestion, and ligation of resultant fragments. For P′-box hybrids, BamHI sites were introduced at codons 143–144 of E. coli narQ (introducing substitutions A143G and E144S in plasmid pRNW202) and the corresponding codons 155 and 156 of gonococcal narQ (introducing substitution E156S in pRNW203). The resultant plasmids were digested with BamHI: the gonococcal narQ gene (from the P′-box to the stop codon) was ligated into the vector fragment containing the E. coli narQ N-terminal fragment, yielding the E. coli-gonococcal P′-box fusion encoded by pRNW200. The E. coli narQ gene fragment was likewise ligated into the vector fragment containing the gonococcal narQ N-terminal, yielding the gonococcal-E. coli P′-box fusion (pRNW201). Similarly, the TMII chimaeras were created by introducing BamHI restriction sites into E. coli narQ at codons 167 and 168 (resulting in substitutions F167W and T168I: pRNW302) and gonococcal narQ codons 179–180 (substitutions L179R M180I: pRNW303). The HAMP linker chimaeras were created by introducing NdeI sites into E. coli narQ at codon 217 (resulting in substitution E217H: pRNW402) and into gonococcal narQ at codon 228 (generating substitution E228H: pRNW403). The Y-box chimaeras were created by introducing BstBI sites into E. coli narQ at codon 229 (resulting in substitution L229F: pRNW502) and into gonococcal narQ at codon 240 (generating substitution L240F: pRNW503).Growth of N. gonorrhoeae—N. gonorrhoeae was grown on gonococcal agar plates and in gonococcal broth (Beckton Dickinson UK Ltd.). Solid and liquid media were supplemented with 1% (v/v) Kellogg's Supplement (19Kellogg Jr., D.S. Peacock Jr., W.L. Deacon W.E. Brown L. Pirkle C.I. J. Bacteriol. 1963; 85: 1274-1279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For liquid cultures, 2 μl of a stock of N. gonorrhoeae was plated onto a gonococcal agar plate and incubated in a candle jar at 37 °C for 24 h. Bacteria from this plate were swabbed onto a second plate and incubated in the same way for a further 16 h. The entire bacterial growth from this second plate was swabbed into 10 ml of gonococcal broth and incubated at 37 °C in an orbital shaker at 100 rpm for 1 h. This 10-ml pre-culture was then tipped into 50 ml of gonococcal broth in a 100-ml conical flask and incubated in the same way. For growth with nitrite, the flasks were supplemented with 1 mm NaNO2 after 1 h and a further 4 mm NaNO2 after 2 h.Preparation of RNA for Microarray Experiments—RNA was extracted from five independent cultures of each strain during exponential growth. Samples (10 ml) of bacterial culture were mixed with an equal volume of RNAlater (Ambion), and the bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.5 ml of RNAlater, and stored at 4 °C overnight. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in TRIzol (Invitrogen) by vortexing for 10 min. Chloroform was added, the phases were separated, and the aqueous phase was transferred to a clean tube. Crude RNA in the aqueous phase was precipitated with isopropanol and cleaned using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Purified RNA was eluted in RNase-free water with 2% (v/v) SuperaseIN RNase inhibitor (Ambion). RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Labtech), and integrity was checked using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA Nano Chips, according to manufacturer's instructions.cDNA Generation, Labeling, and Microarray Hybridization—Reagents and enzymes for the preparation of materials for microarray hybridizations were sourced from the 3DNA Array 900-MPX kit (Genisphere, Hatfield, PA) unless otherwise stated. One microgram of RNA was reverse-transcribed into unlabeled cDNA using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 °C for 2 h. The cDNA was cleaned using a Clean & Concentrate-5 column (Zymo Research) and poly-T tailed with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Dye-specific capture sequences were ligated to the poly-T tails, and the tagged cDNAs were cleaned using a Clean & Concentrate-5 column. The pan-Neisseria microarray version 2 (14Snyder L.A. Jarvis S.A. Saunders N.J. Microbiol. 2005; 151: 4005-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), containing probes to N. gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis genes, was used for these experiments. Microarray slides were prehybridized in 3.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 10 mg ml–1 bovine serum albumin for 65 °C for 20 min, washed with water and isopropanol, dried with an airbrush, and pre-scanned to check for array defects. The capture sequence-tagged cDNAs were hybridized onto the microarray slide for 16 h at 60 °C in a SlideBooster (Advalytix) with the power setting at 25 and a pulse/pause ratio of 3:7. Following the first hybridization, the slides were washed in 2× SSC, 0.2% SDS for 10 min at 60 °C, followed by washes at 2× SSC and 0.2× SSC for 10 min, each at room temperature. The slides were dried with an airbrush and hybridized with the Cy3 and Cy5 capture reagents at 55 °C for 4 h in a SlideBooster. The slides were again washed in 2× SSC, 0.2% SDS (10 min at 60 °C) followed by 10-min room temperature washes in 2× SSC and 0.2× SSC (10 min at room temperature) and dried with an airbrush. Dried slides were scanned using a ScanArray ExpressHT (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using autocalibration to obtain optimized non-saturating images for each fluorophore.Microarray Data Analysis—Scanned microarray images were straightened, if necessary, with ImageViewer (BlueGnome) and analyzed using BlueFuse for Microarrays (BlueGnome). Spot data were extracted from images and manually flagged to remove artifacts before fusion. Fused data were filtered according to the pON value (20Snyder L.A.S. Saunders N.J. BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 128Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Spots with pON values <0.5 in both channels were excluded to eliminate the bias generated by the inclusion of unhybridized spots in the statistical interpretation of the data, and the data were globally adjusted such that the mean rRNA ratio was 1.0. The data were then analyzed using BASE. For each pairwise comparison, gene expression median -fold changes were calculated from the biological replicates using the MGH fold-change algorithm, and the Student's t test was used to assess statistical significance. For the NarP microarray experiment, a cutoff p value of 0.05 was used. Genes whose transcript levels did not change consistently (i.e. with an expression ratio greater than or less than one in all five replicate experiments) in all the biological replicates for each experiment were discarded. Data were also analyzed using a locally prepared implementation of the Cyber-T algorithm within BASE; the results from this analysis are available online (gbrowse.molbiol.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/gbrowse/NarPQ/; username: NarPQ; password: reviewOnly). Total microarray data have been deposited in the ArrayExpress data base (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) with the accession number “E-MEXP-726” (hybridizations were PNA8_36 to PNA8_41).Generation of a Chromosomal 3×FLAG Fusion in N. gonorrhoeae—Codons for a 3×FLAG tag, (DYKDDDDK)3, were linked in-frame to the 3′-end of the narP gene on the chromosome of N. gonorrhoeae strain F62 using crossover PCR (16Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Three fragments corresponding to the 3′-end of the gonococcal narP gene, the region immediately downstream of the narP gene, and the FLAG tag and kanamycin resistance cassette carried on pSUB11 were generated by PCR using primer pairs NarPXO1 plus NarPXO2, NarPXO3 plus NarPXO4, and pSUBXO1 plus pSUBXO2, respectively. The three PCR products were cleaned and combined in a second PCR using primers NarPXO1 and NarPXO4. This reaction generated a 3-kb product containing the narP gene fused to a 3×FLAG tag, a kanamycin resistance cassette, and the region downstream of the narP gene. This fragment was transformed into piliated N. gonorrhoeae strain F62 generating strain JCGC501, carrying a chromosomal narP::FLAG fusion.Western Blotting—Gonococcal proteins separated by Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE using a 15% polyacrylamide gel were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and FLAG-tagged NarP protein was detected using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) and the ECL-Plus chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Interactions between NarP and promoter DNA were studied in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) as described in ref. 21Grainger D.C. Overton T.W. Reppas N. Wade J.T. Tamai E. Hobman J.L. Constantinidou C. Struhl K. Church G. Busby S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6938-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar. Oxygen-limited cultures of N. gonorrhoeae strain JCGC501 were grown in the presence of 5 mm NaNO2 to late exponential phase. Protein-DNA cross-linking, DNA-protein complex preparations, and immunoprecipitations were as described previously except that the tagged protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) for 16 h at 4 °C. The concentration of immunoprecipitated promoter fragments was measured using quantitative real-time PCR (22Aparicio O. Geisberg J.V. Sekinger E. Yang A. Moqtaderi Z. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2005: 21.3.1-21.3.33Google Scholar). Primers for each promoter were designed using PrimerExpress (Applied Biosystems) and are listed in supplemental Table S1. The promoter of the hpt (NG2035) gene, which is not regulated by NarP and is not preceded by a NarP binding site, was a negative control used to normalize the data. Promoter fragments enriched by 50% or more in at least two independent ChIP experiments, relative to the hpt promoter fragment, were scored positive.Quantitative Real-time PCR Analysis of Gene Expression—RNA was stabilized by mixing 500 μl of bacterial culture with 900 μl of RNAlater (Ambion). After 5-min incubation at room temperature, the bacteria were harves"
https://openalex.org/W2021788634,"Growth factors, hormones, and neurotransmitters have been implicated in the regulation of stem cell fate. Since various neural precursors express functional neurotransmitter receptors, which include G protein-coupled receptors, it is anticipated that they are involved in cell fate decisions. We detected μ-opioid receptor (MOR-1) and κ-opioid receptor (KOR-1) expression and immunoreactivity in embryonic stem (ES) cells and in retinoic acid-induced ES cell-derived, nestin-positive, neural progenitors. Moreover, these G protein-coupled receptors are functional, since [d-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin, a MOR-selective agonist, and U69,593, a KOR-selective agonist, induce a sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling throughout a 24-h treatment period in undifferentiated, self-renewing ES cells. Both opioids promote limited proliferation of undifferentiated ES cells via the ERK/MAP kinase signaling pathway. Importantly, biochemical and immunofluorescence data suggest that [d-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin and U69,593 divert ES cells from self-renewal and coax the cells to differentiate. In retinoic acid-differentiated ES cells, opioid-induced signaling features a biphasic ERK activation profile and an opioid-induced, ERK-independent inhibition of proliferation in these neural progenitors. Collectively, the data suggest that opioids may have opposite effects on ES cell self-renewal and ES cell differentiation and that ERK activation is only required by the latter. Finally, opioid modulation of ERK activity may play an important role in ES cell fate decisions by directing the cells to specific lineages. Growth factors, hormones, and neurotransmitters have been implicated in the regulation of stem cell fate. Since various neural precursors express functional neurotransmitter receptors, which include G protein-coupled receptors, it is anticipated that they are involved in cell fate decisions.

The maintenance of ES cells in an undifferentiated state in vitro is dependent on self-renewing cell division in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), 2The abbreviations used are: LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor; Ab, antibody; DAMGO, [d-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin; ES, embryonic stem; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; KOR, κ-opioid receptor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ME, 2-mercaptoethanol; MOR, μ-opioid receptor; nor-BNI, norbinaltorphimine; NP, neural progenitor; OR, opioid receptor; PA, paraformaldehyde; RA, retinoic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; qRT, real time quantitative reverse transcription; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; CTAP, d-Phe-Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2. which signals through various receptor complexes (reviewed in Refs. 1Stavridis M.P.

During this induction, ES cells undergo a series of steps that resemble key stages in the early mouse embryo, supporting the hypothesis that the in vitro pathway represents the normal developmental pathway (8Bain G.

Cells Tissues Organs. 1999; 165: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Considerable effort has been recently devoted to characterizing intrinsic factors, extrinsic factors, and signaling pathways regulating proliferation and differentiation of stem cells. The ERK/MAP kinase signaling pathway has been implicated in both proliferation and differentiation of many cell types, including stem cells (10Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y.

In several studies, ERK activation had a negative influence on self-renewal/proliferation in murine ES cells (4Matsuda T. Nakamura T. Nakao K. Arai T. Katsuki M. Heike T. Yokota T.

However, a dual role for the Ras/ERK pathway was proposed for ES cells, affecting both their division and differentiation (16Ernst M. Oates A. Dunn A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30136-30143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Ras activation down-regulated levels of Nanog, a protein that is normally expressed in high amounts in self-renewing ES cells (17Yoshida-Koide U. Matsuda T. Saikawa K. Nakanuma Y. Yokota T. Asashima M. Koide H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A functional role for ERK was proposed in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent regulation of ES cell self-renewal (18Paling N.R.D. Wheadon H. Bone H.K. Welham M.J. J. Biol.

Some evidence suggests that RA-induced inhibition of LIF signaling in ES cells is ERK-independent (23Tighe A.P. Gudas L.J. J. Cell Physiol. 2004; 198: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, a specific requirement of the ERK pathway was reported for RA-dependent commitment of murine ES cells (24Bost F. Caron L. Marchetti I. Dani C. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Binetruy B. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Cross-talk may occur by noncanonical actions of RA with the MAP kinase phosphorylation cascade. RA-induced differentiation of ES cells may be achieved by restricting nuclear entry of activated ERK (25Smith E.R. Smedberg J.L. Rula M. Xu X.-X. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). ERK activation is required for regulation of cyclin D1 levels, the increase of which parallels ES cell differentiation (26Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5515-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Neurotransmitters as well as growth factors and hormones can influence cell division and differentiation of self-renewing stem cells and neural progenitors (NPs) via ERK in some cases (28Cameron H.A.

Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 187-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). For example, stimulation of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, induces DNA synthesis in rat cortical neuroepithelium progenitors via stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and ERK (30Li B.-H. Ma W. Zhang L. Barker J.L. Stenger D. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activated CB1 receptor inhibits neuronal progenitor differentiation via attenuation of ERK signaling in E17 cortical cultures and in adult dentate gyrus (31Rueda D. Navarro B. Martinez-Serrano A. Guzman M. Galve-Roperh I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46645-46650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This endocannabinoid system was also found to promote astroglial differentiation by acting on neural progenitor cells (32Aguado T. Palazuelos J. Monory K. Stella N. Cravatt B. Lutz B. Marsicano G. Kokaia Z. Guzmán M. Galve-Roperh I. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1551-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Glutamate activates N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and promotes proliferation of E15 precursors derived from the germinal zone of the ventral telencephalon in vivo and in vitro (33Luk K.C. Kennedy T.E. Sadikot A.F. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2239-2250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Haloperidol acting via dopamine D2 receptors increases the number of NPs, neurons, and glia in the adult rat brain (34Kippin T.E. Kapur S. van der Kooy D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5815-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). G protein βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins are required for proper mitotic-spindle orientation and asymmetric cell fate decisions of cerebral cortical progenitors (35Sanada K. Tsai L.-H. Cell. 2005; 122: 119-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). These studies were performed with brain-derived stem cells or NPs, but little is known about the consequences of G protein-coupled receptor-ERK cross-talk in blastocyst-derived ES cells or their NPs. Since the plasticity of uncommitted stem cells has opened new perspectives in tissue regeneration, recent research has been directed to understanding the signaling mechanisms that control proliferation and/or differentiation of ES cells. Here, we detected μ- and κ-ORs in ES cells and in ES cell-derived NPs. More importantly, we found that both opioids induced ES cell differentiation via ERK and an ERK-independent attenuation of proliferation in RA-driven NPs. Mouse ES Cells and Their Growth Conditions—D3 (ATCC) and PRX-129/S6#7ES cells (Primogenix, Inc.) were used. PRX-129/S6#7ES cells were isolated from the inner cell mass of a day 3.5 129/S6/SvEv mouse blastocyst. Cells have a normal male karyotype and are specific pathogen-free. They were injected into blastocysts and produced chimeras at a high rate (first injection: 10/15 pups, no perinatal death). PRX-129/S6 # 7 cells were grown on mouse embryonic fibroblasts in the presence of LIF, passage 10 cells were propagated 2-3 times on gelatin-coated flasks, and these cells are currently used in the laboratory. Quality control and characterization of the D3 ES cells are documented by their depositor (36Doetschman T.C. Eistetter H. Katz M. Schmidt W. Kemler R. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1985; 87: 27-45PubMed Google Scholar). D3 ES cells were propagated on irradiated STO cell feeders (ATCC) for several passages before they were transferred to gelatin-coated flasks. D3 and PRX-129/S6#7ES cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, LIF (100 ng/ml), and 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (ME) on gelatin-coated dishes. These growth conditions are known to prevent ES cells from differentiating (6Gottlieb D.I. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 381-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 37Williams R.L. Hilton D.J. Pease S. Willson T.A. Stewart C.L. Gearing D.P. Wagner E.F. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Gough N.M. Nature. 1988; 336: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar, 38Smith A.G. Heath J.K. Donaldson D.D. Wong G.G. Moreau J. Stahl M. Rogers D. Nature. 1988; 336: 688-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). Here, cells grown under these conditions will be described as “undifferentiated, self-renewing ES cells.” The neural induction of ES cells entails the “4-/4+ protocol,” which has two phases (8Bain G. Kitchens D. Yao M. Huettner J.E. Gottlieb D.I. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 342-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 39Finley M.F. Devata S. Huettner J.E. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 40: 271-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the first phase, cells are cultured in nonadhesive, bacterial grade Petri dishes in serum-containing media (without LIF and ME) in the absence of RA for 4 days. During this phase, embryoid bodies of different sizes appear. In the second phase, cells are grown in RA (1 μm) and serum-containing media for an additional 4 days. Differentiation of these cells is also a two-phase process: 1) early differentiation, during which nestin-positive cells develop, and 2) their terminal differentiation, the final step in ES cell growth. For this purpose, embryoid bodies are dissociated and cultured on tissue culture plates in serum containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for an additional 2-5 days (short term differentiation) or for 5-12 days (long term differentiation). The RA-induced, short term differentiated cells are referred to as NPs. Opioid Treatments—ES cells or ES cell-derived progenitors are maintained in their corresponding growth media. Opioid agonists (0.1-1 μm; DAMGO, a MOR-selective agonist, or U69,593, a KOR-selective agonist) were added for various times (up to 24 h). In some experiments, cells were preincubated with opioid antagonists (1 μm, 60 min; CTAP (MOR-selective) or nor-BNI (KOR-selective)) and then treated with the corresponding opioid agonist (0.1 μm) for a given time. Measurement of ERK Activity—For these experiments, cells were grown in 6-well plates. In most cases, ES cells were maintained in serum-containing media upon opioid treatment. In contrast, ES cell-derived NPs were grown in media deprived of serum for 24 h before treatment with opioids. ERK phosphorylation was measured by performing immunoblotting experiments with a phospho-ERK Ab that recognizes the active form of ERK (40Belcheva M.M. Szücs M. Wang D.X. Sadee W. Coscia C.J. J.

Cells were washed with PBS and lysed with buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 1% Nonidet-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin) and spun at 14,000 × g, and protein concentration of the supernatants was determined. Cell lysates (10-20 μg of protein/lane) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were blotted on Immobilon membranes. Nonspecific sites were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.2% Tween 20. Blots were incubated with monoclonal phospho-ERK Ab (1:2000; Cell Signaling) for at least 15 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (1:2000; Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were visualized with an ECL chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare) and exposure to Classic Blue sensitive x-ray film. Band intensities were determined by densitometry with an Eastman Kodak Co. DC120 digital camera, Kodak ds 1D version 3.0.2 (Scientific Imaging Systems), and NIH Image ImageJ version 1.32 software. ERK stimulation in opioid-treated cells was expressed as -fold change over basal levels in control cells. OR and Nestin Immunofluorescence Microscopy—ES cells or ES cell-derived NPs were grown in glass chamber slides (Nunc). The cells were fixed in 4% PA for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton/PBS for 5 min. Cells were then incubated in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 for 30 min to reduce nonspecific binding, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with the following rabbit polyclonal OR Abs: MOR-1 raised against C terminus (1:2500; Neuromics); MOR-1 raised against N terminus (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); KOR-1 (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In some cases, a mouse monoclonal nestin Ab (1:1000; Chemicon) was added together with the OR Abs. After washing, Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated (red) and/or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated (green) secondary Abs (1:1000) were applied for 1 h at room temperature. DAPI (1:200) was added together with the secondary Abs. The slides were treated with anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and examined for immunofluorescence with NIKON-OPTIPHOT-2 or OLYMPUS AH3 microscopes with simultaneous recording of dual fluorescence label images. Real Time Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase (qRT)-PCR—Total RNA from ES cells and RA-induced NPs was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was generated from 1 μg of total RNA using the High Capacity cDNA archive kit from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) with random primers as described by the manufacturer. qRT-PCR was performed with SYBR green chemistry on an Applied Biosystems 7500 instrument. The primers were designed using Primer Express (Applied Biosystems) and supplied by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Primer sequences for MOR-1 were as follows: forward, 5′-CCACTAGCACGCTGCCCTT-3′; reverse, 5′-GCCACGTTCCCATCAGGTAG-3′. Primer sequences for KOR-1 were as follows: forward, 5′-AGAGAGAGAAGCGGCAAGCA-3′; reverse, 5′-GCCAAGGCTCACTAACTCCAA-3′. The cDNA templates for qRT-PCR were diluted 1:10, and the 50 μl SYBR-green reaction consisted of 1× SYBR-green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 300 nm forward and reverse primers, and 5 μl of diluted cDNA. Four replicates of each qRT-PCR reaction were run on 96-well plates. The amplification efficiencies of MOR-1 and KOR-1 were consistent with those of the endogenous control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Relative quantification measurements were made as described (43Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar) by using the comparative CT method (ΔΔCT method) in which the gene CT values are normalized by subtracting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase CT. Immunoblotting with MOR-1- and KOR-1-specific Abs—For detection of receptor protein levels in ES cells or ES cell-derived NPs, immunoblotting with MOR-1- and KOR-1-specific Abs was adopted. For this purpose, cells were lysed in a modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF), and samples containing 20-50 μg of protein were loaded on 10% SDS gels. Receptor band(s) were detected using two rabbit polyclonal MOR-1 Abs: C terminus MOR-1 Ab (1:2000; Neuromics) and N terminus MOR-1 Ab (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). KOR-1 immunoreactivity was detected with a rabbit polyclonal KOR-1-specific Ab (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Horseradish peroxidase-linked IgGs were applied as secondary Abs. Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence detection as described for ERK. SOX-1 Immunostaining and Counting—D3 ES cells were grown in chamber slides, in serum/LIF/ME-containing media, and were treated with 1 μm DAMGO or U69,593 for 24 h. In some cases, cells were pretreated for 1 h either with MOR antagonist (CTAP, 1 μm) or KOR antagonist (nor-BNI, 1 μm) before the addition of opioid agonists for 24 h. Control and opioid-treated ES cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 2% PA for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.4% Triton/PBS for 5 min and incubated in PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum and 0.4% Triton X-100 for 30 min to reduce nonspecific binding, followed by incubation with chicken polyclonal SOX-1 Ab (1:500; Chemicon) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, Alexa Fluor 594 (red)-conjugated antichicken secondary Ab (1:1000; Molecular Probes) was applied for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were counterstained with DAPI (1:200) to visualize nuclei for cell counts. Chamber slides were treated with anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes) and examined for immunofluorescence as described above. NIH Image J version 1.32 software was used to count cells. The percentage of SOX-1-positive cells was estimated from the ratio between the total number of cells (DAPI-stained) and the number of SOX-1-stained cells. Cells from 3-5 fields/slide were counted, and 3-4 slides/treatment group were used for the counting. The total number of counted cells was 500-800/treatment group. Cell Proliferation Assays—For these studies, equal numbers of cells were seeded per well in 12-well dishes. Cell numbers were estimated by serial dilutions and counting cells (volume of 10 μl) in several visual fields using a bright line hemacytometer and light microscopy. Basal levels or opioid-induced changes in DNA synthesis were assessed by measuring the rate of [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation into cells. Cells were grown in media with or without opioids for 24 h. In some experiments, the MEK-selective inhibitor U0126 (1 μm) was present for 28 h, whereas opioid agonists were added for 24 h, and [methyl-3H]thymidine (0.02 μCi/ml) was present for the last 4 h. [methyl-3H]Thymidine incorporation was measured as described in our previous studies with some modifications (44Bohn L.M. Belcheva M.M. Coscia C.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS, followed by incubation with 5% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 30 min. Then cells were collected in 2% NaHCO3/0.1 n NaOH, and [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. BrdUrd Labeling of Cells—D3 ES cells or RA-induced NPs were grown until they reached about 50% confluence. They were then treated with either 1 μm DAMGO or U69,593 for 24 h. In some cases, cells were pretreated with inhibitors or opioid antagonists as described in the figure legends. At the end of the treatment, medium was replaced with BrdUrd labeling medium (10 μm; BrdUrd detection kit I; Molecular Probes), and cells were incubated for 20-30 min. After several washes, cultures were fixed with ethanol fixative for 20 min at -20 °C. For nestin co-labeling, cells were incubated together with a monoclonal BrdUrd Ab (1:10; Roche Applied Science kit) and polyclonal nestin Ab (1:1000; Covance) at 37 °C for 30 min. For Sox-1 co-labeling, cells were first incubated with a monoclonal BrdUrd Ab (1:10; Roche Applied Science kit) at 37 °C for 30 min and then incubated in PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum and 0.4% Triton X-100 for 30 min to reduce nonspecific binding, followed by counterstaining with a chicken Sox-1 polyclonal Ab (1:500; Chemicon) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, cells were treated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (green, 1:10; Roche Applied Science kit) together with Alexa Fluor 594 (red)-conjugated anti-chicken or anti-rabbit secondary Abs (1:1000; Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were examined for immunofluorescence as described above. Characterization of ES Cells and ES Cell-derived NPs—The state of differentiation of D3 or PRX ES cells and RA-induced ES cell-derived NPs was characterized by immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting. For this purpose, D3 and PRX ES cells were maintained under serum/LIF/ME-induced self-renewal conditions, or they were differentiated in the presence of RA. For the immunocytochemistry experiments, cultures were stained with nestin (a neural progenitor marker) Ab and DAPI (a nuclear marker). As seen in double DAPI/nestin images (Fig. 1, D3 and PRX), there were no nestin (red)-stained cells among the undifferentiated ES cells, whereas RA-induced NPs show heavy staining with nestin (Fig. 1, dD3 and dPRX). Since the transcription factor Oct4 has been demonstrated to be vital for the formation of self-renewing pluripotent ES cells, cell lysates from undifferentiated D3 ES cells or RA-induced NPs were probed with an Oct4 Ab (1:100; Chemicon) as presented in Fig. 1B. The densitometry data from the Oct4 immunoblots suggest that there is about a 50% reduction in Oct4 protein levels in D3 ES cell-derived NPs (3767 ± 85; n = 3) in comparison with the levels of this transcription factor in undifferentiated ES cells (6954 ± 463; n = 4). MOR-1 and KOR-1 Gene Expression and Immunoreactivity Was Detected in ES Cells and in ES Cell-derived NPs—Three independent approaches were taken to determine the presence of MOR-1 and KOR-1 in undifferentiated D3 ES cells and RA-induced ES cell-derived NPs: qRT-PCR, immunoblot analysis of cell lysates, and immunofluorescence microscopy of cells at different stages of development. In qRT-PCR experiments, we found that in comparison with ES cells, NPs have 1.37- and 2-fold increases in MOR-1 and KOR-1 gene expression, respectively (n = 3). As shown in Fig. 2, immunoblotting performed with polyclonal MOR-1 (C terminus; Neuromics)-, MOR-1 (N terminus; Santa Cruz Biotechnology)-, and KOR-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)-specific Abs shows the presence of major 50 and 55 kDa bands that correspond to the expected molecular masses for MOR-1 and KOR-1, respectively. In addition to the 50 kDa band, the N terminus MOR-1 Ab reveals the existence of higher molecular mass bands (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 7), which were suggested to correspond to the glycosylated form(s) of the receptor by several groups (45Garzon J. Juarros J.L. Castro M.A. Sanchez-Blazquez P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 738-744PubMed Google Scholar, 46Liu-Chen L.Y. Chen C. Phillips C.A. Mol.

Both MOR-1 and KOR-1 bands were detected in cell lysates, obtained from D3 ES cells maintained under self-renewal conditions (serum/LIF/ME). RA treatment does not appear to induce significant changes in MOR-1 or KOR-1 gene expression or protein levels (Fig. 2) in D3 NPs. Brain homogenate was used as a positive control, and lysates from late passage immortalized rat astrocytes were used as negative controls, because these cells lose detectable amounts of ORs with passaging (42Belcheva M.M.

Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis further supports the occurrence of MOR-1 and KOR-1 in D3 ES cells and NPs (Fig. 3). Once again, the undifferentiated state of D3 ES cells is confirmed by the absence of nestin (green)-stained cells (D3; Fig. 3, E and G). In contrast, D3 ES cell-derived NPs (dD3) show heavy nestin staining (Fig. 3, F and H). The presence of MOR-1 (red) immunoreactive cells was confirmed"
https://openalex.org/W2030176763,"Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that exports enterotoxins to alter host cells and to elicit diarrheal disease. Among the secreted toxins is the multifunctional RTX toxin, which causes cell rounding and actin depolymerization by covalently cross-linking actin monomers into dimers, trimers, and higher multimers. The region of the toxin responsible for cross-linking activity is the actin cross-linking domain (ACD). In this study, we further investigated the role of the ACD in the actin cross-linking reaction. We show that the RTX toxin cross-links actin independently of tissue transglutaminase, thus eliminating an indirect model of ACD activity. We demonstrate that a fusion protein of the ACD and the N-terminal portion of lethal factor from Bacillus anthracis (LFNACD) has cross-linking activity in vivo and in crude cell extracts. Furthermore, we determined that LFNACD directly catalyzes the formation of covalent linkages between actin molecules in vitro and that Mg2+ and ATP are essential cofactors for the cross-linking reaction. In addition, G-actin is proposed as a cytoskeletal substrate of the RTX toxin in vivo. Future studies of the in vitro cross-linking reaction will facilitate characterization of the enzymatic properties of the ACD and contribute to our knowledge of the novel mechanism of covalent actin cross-linking.

The causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera is the Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Vibrio cholerae, which is transmitted to the human host following consumption of contaminated food or water. Upon colonization of the upper intestine, V. cholerae produces the major virulence factor cholera toxin, which ADP-ribosylates the α-subunit of the Gs GTP-binding protein and constitutively activates the adenylate cyclase complex. The subsequent increase in the cAMP levels in intestinal epithelial cells leads to the opening of Cl– ion channels, resulting in the profuse diarrhea that is the hallmark of cholera. If untreated, the disease can progress to severe dehydration, and case-fatality rates can reach as high as 50% (1Kaper J.B. Morris Jr., J.G. Levine M.M. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 8: 48-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The V. cholerae RTX 4The abbreviations used are: RTX, repeats in toxin; ACD, actin cross-linking domain; LFN, lethal factor N-terminal portion; PA, protective antigen; TGase, transglutaminase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; AMP-PNP, adenyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate; LatB, latrunculin B; Dol11, dolastatin 11. toxin, which is encoded by rtxA, was discovered through a combination of genomic sequence analysis, genetic mapping, and representational difference analysis (2Lin W. Fullner K.J. Clayton R. Sexton J.A. Rogers M.B. Calia K.E. Calderwood S.B. Fraser C. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1071-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The rtxA gene, which is tightly linked to the cholera toxin-encoding ctx genes, is deleted in the classical V. cholerae O1 isolates, but is expressed by both the El Tor O1 and O139 strains, which are responsible for the current cholera pandemic (2Lin W. Fullner K.J. Clayton R. Sexton J.A. Rogers M.B. Calia K.E. Calderwood S.B. Fraser C. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The RTX toxin is also produced by non-O1/non-O139 strains, and it has been suggested that the toxin may contribute to the emergence of pathogenic non-O1/non-O139 strains (4Dalsgaard A. Serichantalergs O. Forslund A. Lin W. Mekalanos J. Mintz E. Shimada T. Wells J.G. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 4086-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The full-length 4545-amino acid RTX toxin is predicted to be 484,000 Da in size and is secreted from the bacterium by an atypical type I secretion system that requires two transport ATPases (5Boardman B.K. Satchell K.J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8137-8143Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although related to the RTX family of pore-forming toxins, the V. cholerae RTX toxin seems to be the founding member of a new family of RTX exoproteins. These proteins, encoded by V. cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus, Photorhabdus luminescens, and Xenorhabdus sp., are all larger than 3500 amino acids and share consensus 20-residue N-terminal glycine-rich repeats in addition to 18-residue C-terminal repeats that include the nonapeptide motif GGXGXDXX common to all RTX exoproteins. However, the central regions of these proteins vary dramatically, and it has been predicted that each toxin will have a distinct repertoire of cellular activities (5Boardman B.K. Satchell K.J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8137-8143Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Sheahan K.-L. Cordero C.L. Satchell K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9798-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The V. cholerae RTX toxin is multifunctional and has two distinct mechanisms for cell rounding (7Sheahan K.-L. Cordero C.L. Satchell K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9798-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The first mechanism identified involves the covalent cross-linking of cellular actin, resulting in the depolymerization of actin stress fibers and an increase in paracellular permeability (8Fullner K.J. Lencer W.I. Mekalanos J.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6310-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Fullner K.J. Mekalanos J.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5315-5323Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A region of the toxin located between residues 1963 and 2375, denoted as the actin cross-linking domain (ACD), has been identified recently as the portion of the toxin responsible for cross-linking activity. Transient expression of this domain in both transformed African green monkey kidney fibroblast (COS-7) and human laryngeal epithelial (HEp-2) cells leads to the formation of cross-linked actin species, demonstrating that expression of 412 amino acids of the toxin in the cytosol is sufficient to initiate actin cross-linking in the target cell (7Sheahan K.-L. Cordero C.L. Satchell K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9798-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether the ACD can bind actin and catalyze the covalent linkage directly or whether the toxin activity stimulates a host cell cross-linking enzyme. A truncated form of the Bacillus anthracis lethal factor (LFN) has been shown previously to mediate cytosolic delivery of heterologous fusion proteins through the entry mechanism used by the anthrax toxin (10Milne J.C. Blanke S.R. Hanna P.C. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, protective antigen (PA) binds to the anthrax toxin receptor; PA is processed to its active 63-kDa form (PA63); and the PA63 fragment oligomerizes into a stable heptamer (11Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Young J.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 12Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol.

The LFN fusion protein binds to (PA63)7; the complex enters the host cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis; and acidification of the vacuole results in PA pore formation and translocation of the LFN fusion protein to the cytosol (14Elliott J.L. Mogridge J. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6706-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15Gordon V.M. Leppla S.H. Hewlett E.L. Infect.

This system has been used to study the mechanism of action of other bacterial toxins, including Corynebacterium diphtheriae diphtheria toxin and Clostridium difficile toxin B (10Milne J.C. Blanke S.R. Hanna P.C. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 17Spyres L.M. Qa'Dan M. Meader A. Tomasek J.J. Howard E.W. Ballard J.D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this study, we have further defined the novel mechanism of covalent actin cross-linking by the V. cholerae RTX toxin. We found that cross-linking by the RTX toxin does not involve tissue transglutaminase (TGase), as suggested previously (9Fullner K.J. Mekalanos J.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5315-5323Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We established that a fusion protein of LFN and ACD (LFNACD) has cross-linking activity in vivo and in crude cell extracts. LFNACD directly catalyzes the actin cross-linking reaction in the absence of host proteins, and Mg2+ and ATP are required cofactors in vitro. Finally, we identified G-actin or actin oligomers as potential cytoskeletal substrates of the cross-linking reaction in vivo. These results contribute to our overall understanding of the mechanism of action of the V. cholerae RTX toxin and demonstrate that the ACD cross-links actin by directly catalyzing the formation of a covalent linkage between actin monomers in the absence of eukaryotic protein intermediates. Strains, Cell Lines, and Reagents—Bah1P (expressing the RTX toxin) and Bah2P (harboring a deletion in rtxA) are strains derived from V. cholerae El Tor Ogawa strain E7946 (9Fullner K.J. Mekalanos J.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5315-5323Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). KFV119 is a ΔhapAΔhlyA derivative of V. cholerae El Tor O1 Inaba strain N16961 that contains an intact rtxA gene (7Sheahan K.-L. Cordero C.L. Satchell K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9798-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Bacterial cultures were grown for 18 h at 30 °C in Luria broth containing streptomycin (100 μg/ml). TSA201 and HEp-2 cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 units/ml streptomycin. All restriction enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Tissue TGase Assay—Cells treated with bacteria for 70 min were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), released in PBS with 0.1 mm EDTA, scraped and collected in RPMI 1640 medium, and pelleted at 6000 × g. The cell pellets were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Tissue TGase expression was detected with a 1:400 dilution of mouse anti-TGase monoclonal antibody (Lab Vision Corp., Fremont, CA) followed by a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). Actin cross-linking was monitored by immunoblotting as described previously (9Fullner K.J. Mekalanos J.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5315-5323Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Construction, Expression, and Purification of Proteins—The pABII plasmid is a derivative of the pET15b plasmid (Novagen, Madison, WI) containing the DNA sequence for LFN with an N-terminal His6 tag. To create a fusion to the ACD, the ACD sequence was amplified from the V. cholerae chromosome using primers LFACD-F (5′-GAAAGATCTCTAAGTGCGGTACAGG-3′) and LFNACD-R (5′-AGAGATCTTAAGGAGCGGTAATTTTCGC-3′). The ∼1.3-kb PCR product was cloned into the pCR-BluntII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and then subcloned as a BglII fragment into the BamHI site of the pABII expression vector (17Spyres L.M. Qa'Dan M. Meader A. Tomasek J.J. Howard E.W. Ballard J.D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pTCO24, expresses the ACD protein fused to the C terminus of LFN. DNA sequencing of the insert in pTCO24 was performed at the Northwestern University Biotechnology Laboratory to confirm the accuracy of both the coding region and the junction between the LFN and ACD sequences. LFN and the LFNACD fusion protein were expressed and purified as described by Milne et al. (10Milne J.C. Blanke S.R. Hanna P.C. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 18Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor2001Google Scholar) following standard molecular biology protocols. Briefly, pABII or pTCO24 was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen), and bacterial cultures were grown in Luria broth supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) to A600 = 0.6–1.0. Protein expression was induced for 2 h after the addition of 1.0 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C, and bacterial cells were pelleted at 5000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 0.5 m NaCl) with 5.0 mm imidazole. Following the addition of lysozyme (1 mg/ml), the cell suspension was incubated for 30 min on ice and sonicated in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 with a Branson Sonifier 450 digital cell disruptor at 35% amplitude (15-s pulses for a total of 4 min). The cell lysate was incubated with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 5.0 μg/ml DNase I, and 5.0 μg/ml RNase I and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was passed through a 0.45-μm pore syringe filter, loaded onto a 1-ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in Buffer A, and purified on anÄKTA purifier FPLC system (GE Healthcare). The fusion protein was eluted at 107 mm imidazole using a linear gradient of 5–250 mm imidazole in Buffer A. All fractions containing the His6-tagged protein were pooled, analyzed by SDS-PAGE for purity, and concentrated on a Centricon YM-30 microconcentrator (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The proteins were loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare) and exchanged into Buffer A. Fractions containing the desalted protein were pooled, concentrated, and stored in 10% glycerol at –80 °C. PA was purified using plasmid PA-pET15b as described by Voth et al. (19Voth D.E. Hamm E.E. Nguyen L.G. Tucker A.E. Salles I.I. Ortiz-Leduc W. Ballard J.D. Cell. Microbiol. 2005; 7: 1139-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis of Purified Proteins—Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). The proteins were immunoblotted either with a 1:20,000 dilution of mouse anti-His6 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) followed by a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or with a 1:5000 dilution of rabbit anti-ACD polyclonal antibody followed by a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). The anti-ACD antibody was generated by immunization of a New Zealand White rabbit with the synthetic peptide 1VESRKEAMLWLAKEFTDHCOOH, which corresponds to amino acids 2066–2083 of the RTX protein sequence (2Lin W. Fullner K.J. Clayton R. Sexton J.A. Rogers M.B. Calia K.E. Calderwood S.B. Fraser C. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1071-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), using standard procedures (Proteintech Group, Inc., Chicago, IL). In Vivo Actin Cross-linking Assay—Approximately 2.5 × 105 HEp-2 cells seeded in a 12-well dish were incubated with PA and either LFN or LFNACD or treated with PBS-washed KFV119 bacteria at a multiplicity of infection of ∼200. Cell rounding was monitored with a Nikon Eclipse TS100 inverted microscope. Phase-contrast images were acquired at ×200 magnification with an inverted Leica DMIRE2 microscope equipped with a C4742-95–12ERG digital charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Tokyo, Japan) and the Openlab software program (Improvision, Coventry, UK). For some experiments, cells were washed and scraped in PBS, centrifuged at 4500 × g for 5 min, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled for 10 min in preparation for the detection of actin cross-linking by immunoblotting as described previously (9Fullner K.J. Mekalanos J.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5315-5323Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In Vitro Actin Cross-linking Assay—For the preparation of cell extracts, ∼4 × 106 HEp-2 cells were plated onto two 100-mm dishes, washed and scraped in PBS, and sonicated with a Conoco Sonicel disruptor (5-s pulses for 1 min). Cell lysates were pelleted at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and 120 μg of cleared lysates were added to 5.0 μg of either purified LFN or LFNACD protein. Each reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 90 min and then boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min. Actin cross-linking was detected by immunoblotting as described previously (9Fullner K.J. Mekalanos J.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5315-5323Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Rabbit skeletal actin was purified from rabbit back muscle as described by Spudich and Watt (20Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin was added at a concentration of 10 μm to either purified LFN or LFNACD at 0.018 μm, and the reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in Buffer B (5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.2 mm CaCl2). Samples were boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and cross-linked actin bands were detected on gels by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The in vitro experiments were also performed at 22 °C, and the results were identical. Actin Polymerization and Light Scattering—Actin polymerization was initiated following the addition of 2.0 mm CaCl2, 2.0 mm MgCl2, or 50 mm KCl. Light scattering measurements were performed in a Photon Technology International spectrofluorometer with the emission and excitation wavelengths set at 325 nm. The RTX Toxin Cross-links Actin Independently of Tissue TGase Activity—The formation of covalent linkages between actin monomers following the treatment of eukaryotic cells with V. cholerae strains expressing the RTX toxin may be attributed either to the activity of the ACD directly or to an ACD-mediated modification of a eukaryotic cellular enzyme. Tissue TGase, a member of the family of Ca2+-dependent enzymes that introduce ϵ-(γ-glutamyl)lysine side chain linkages between proteins, is the only known host enzyme that catalyzes the covalent cross-linking of cellular actin (21Chen J.S. Mehta K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 817-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 22Nemes Z.J. Adány R. Balázs M. Boross P. Fésüs L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20577-20583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To address a model in which the ACD functions by activating tissue TGase, actin cross-linking was monitored in TSA201 cells, a human embryonic kidney cell line with undetectable tissue TGase production (23Murthy S.N. Lomasney J.W. Mak E.C. Lorand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11815-11819Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). When cells were incubated with a V. cholerae strain producing the RTX toxin, cross-linked actin species were detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that actin is cross-linked in the absence of tissue TGase, showing that tissue TGase is not required for the actin cross-linking reaction. The site of TGase cross-linking on the actin molecule is located at the glutamine residue at position 41 of the protein sequence (24Takashi R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 938-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The involvement of this residue in the RTX-dependent cross-linking reaction was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis of the β-actin sequence from pEGFP-actin (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). An asparagine substitution (Q41N) had no effect on the cross-linking of green fluorescent protein-actin in the presence of an RTX-expressing V. cholerae strain (data not shown). In addition, the TGase-specific cross-link was not detected by immunoblotting with an anti-N-ϵ-(γ-glutamyl)lysine antibody (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) in lysates from V. cholerae-treated cells (data not shown). These data provide further evidence that the actin cross-linking reaction is tissue TGase-independent. As there are no other enzymes known to covalently cross-link actin, an alternative model that favors a direct interaction between the ACD of the RTX toxin and cellular actin monomers was investigated. Construction and Purification of LFN ACD—An in vitro assay was developed to assess whether the ACD is sufficient to cross-link actin in the absence of other cellular proteins. Previous attempts to catalyze the cross-linking reaction with partially purified holotoxin or recombinant ACD proteins were unsuccessful, and inactivation of the ACD may have been due to decreased stability or improper protein folding (9Fullner K.J. Mekalanos J.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5315-5323Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, it was essential to first establish that the purified ACD protein has actin cross-linking activity in vivo before monitoring actin cross-linking in vitro. A fusion protein was constructed to take advantage of the entry mechanism of B. anthracis anthrax toxin, which has been used to translocate the catalytic domains of various bacterial toxins into eukaryotic cells (17Spyres L.M. Qa'Dan M. Meader A. Tomasek J.J. Howard E.W. Ballard J.D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The ACD sequence was amplified from the V. cholerae chromosome by PCR and cloned into a bacterial LFN expression vector (17Spyres L.M. Qa'Dan M. Meader A. Tomasek J.J. Howard E.W. Ballard J.D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The resulting fusion protein, LFNACD, was purified on a nickel-chelating column and further desalted by gel filtration chromatography. The protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A), and the observed mobility of the LFNACD fusion protein corresponded to an expected molecular mass of 81 kDa. This protein reacted with both the anti-His6 tag antibody and a peptide antibody raised against the ACD (Fig. 2, B and C). The molecular mass of the purified LFNACD protein was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry to be 81,407 Da, which is accurate to 0.09% of the predicted mass. The protein containing the LFN portion alone (purified under similar conditions) reacted only with the anti-His6 tag antibody and not with the ACD-specific antibody. Purified LFN ACD Cross-links Actin in Vivo—Fusion of the ACD sequence to LFN allows for the cytosolic delivery of purified LFNACD proteins into target cells. To monitor the activity of LFNACD in vivo, HEp-2 cells were incubated with purified PA and either LFN or LFNACD at a molar ratio of 7:3 (25Mogridge J. Cunningham K. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Cell rounding was observed in LFNACD-intoxicated cells, and the rounding was markedly similar to that of cells incubated with KFV119, a V. cholerae strain expressing the full-length RTX toxin (Fig. 3A). Actin dimers, trimers, and higher order multimers were detected in cells treated with LFNACD or KFV119 by immunoblotting (Fig. 3B). These data demonstrate that the purified LFNACD protein has covalent actin cross-linking activity in vivo and is suitable for the development of an in vitro actin cross-linking assay. The results from this purified protein assay confirm previous findings based on transient transfection that actin cross-linking activity is carried by the ACD region of the RTX toxin and that the ACD functions within the cell (7Sheahan K.-L. Cordero C.L. Satchell K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9798-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, these data show that the LFNACD protein must be translocated to the cytosol through the activity of PA and that LFNACD alone is incapable of functioning extracellularly. These data indicate that ACD activity does not lead to actin cross-linking by stimulating an endogenous signal transduction pathway that ultimately results in the formation of cross-linked actin proteins and that the ACD does not gain access to the target cell through a receptor interaction independent of PA. It can be further extrapolated that the ACD in the holotoxin is likely transported to the cell cytoplasm via the entry mechanism of the full-length RTX toxin and not by an ACD-specific pathway. LFN ACD Has Actin Cross-linking Activity in Crude Cell Extracts—To further investigate the role of the ACD in the actin cross-linking reaction, purified LFN or LFNACD proteins were added to crude HEp-2 cell extracts. Cross-linked actin species were detected by immunoblotting in the LFNACD-treated extracts, but not in extracts incubated with LFN (Fig. 4). To determine whether the reaction requires divalent cations, cell extracts were preincubated with either 5.0 mm EDTA or EGTA for 5 min before the addition of LFNACD. The formation of cross-linked actin was inhibited in the presence of EDTA, suggesting that Mg2+ is needed for the reaction, although it is possible that the addition of EDTA caused actin denaturation. The detection of actin cross-linking was inconsistent in EGTA-treated samples, a result that may be attributed either to a requirement for Ca2+ in the reaction or to a low or variable concentration of Mg2+ in different extract preparations. Taken together, these data show that the ACD can cross-link actin in vitro and that divalent cations are needed for the reaction either as a cofactor or to stabilize actin. LFN ACD-catalyzed Cross-linking of Purified Actin Is Dependent upon Mg2+—To determine whether the ACD directly catalyzes the formation of covalent linkages between actin proteins, purified actin was tested as a substrate in the actin cross-linking reaction. Purified rabbit skeletal actin was incubated with LFN or LFNACD in the presence of 2.0 mm CaCl2, MgCl2, MnCl2, or ZnCl2 as the divalent cation cofactor. Upon the addition of Mg2+, covalently cross-linked actin dimers, trimers, and higher multimers were detected on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 5A). Reduced ACD activity was observed in the presence of Mn2+, and there was no actin cross-linking following the addition of Ca2+ or Zn2+ ions. To further characterize the in vitro cross-linking reaction, LFNACD, actin, and Mg2+ were co-incubated, and actin cross-linking was monitored at various time points. Covalently cross-linked actin dimer proteins were detected after an incubation period of 0.5 min (Fig. 5B). The distribution of actin laddering remained unchanged after 10 min, and we concluded that the cross-linking reaction had reached completion. These data indicate that, in the presence of Mg2+ as a cofactor, LFNACD catalyzes the actin cross-linking reaction in a time-dependent manner. Actin is present in the cell as either globular monomers (G-actin) or polymeric filaments (F-actin), with polymerization occurring under physiological salt conditions (26Kabsch W. Vandekerckhove J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 49-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, Mg2+ alone causes efficient polymerization of actin in vitro, and the requirement for Mg2+ in the actin cross-linking reaction suggests that actin polymerization needs to be initiated prior to the formation of covalent linkages by the ACD. To investigate the contribution of Mg2+, G-actin was polymerized into F-actin following the addition of 2.0 mm CaCl2, 2.0 mm MgCl2, or 50 mm KCl. As shown in Fig. 6A, all conditions resulted in actin polymerization as detected by light scattering. In parallel experiments, actin polymerization was initiated in the presence of LFNACD, and actin cross-linking was detected only in the reaction supplemented with Mg2+ (Fig. 6B). These data suggest that the initiation of actin polymerization is not sufficient to cause actin cross-linking by LFNACD and that the ACD-catalyzed cross-linking reaction is dependent upon Mg2+ as a cofactor, not simply to stabilize actin or to promote polymerization.

https://openalex.org/W2114065979,"Obesity is an independent risk factor for cardiac failure. Obesity promotes excessive deposition of fat in adipose and nonadipose tissues. Intramyocardial lipid overload is a relatively common finding in nonischemic heart failure, especially in obese and diabetic patients, and promotes lipoapoptosis that contributes to the alteration of cardiac function. Lipoprotein production has been proposed as a heart-protective mechanism through the unloading of surplus cellular lipids. We previously analyzed the heart transcriptome in a dog nutritional model of obesity, and we identified a new apolipoprotein, regulated by obesity in heart, which is the subject of this study. We detected this new protein in the following lipoproteins: high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, and very low density lipoprotein. We designated it apolipoprotein O. Apolipoprotein O is a 198-amino acid protein that contains a 23-amino acidlong signal peptide. The apolipoprotein O gene is expressed in a set of human tissues. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy colocalized apolipoprotein O and perilipins, a cellular marker of the lipid droplet. Chondroitinase ABC deglycosylation analysis or cell incubation with p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xyloside indicated that apolipoprotein O belongs to the proteoglycan family. Naringenin or CP-346086 treatments indicated that apolipoprotein O secretion requires microsomal triglyceride transfer protein activity. Apolipoprotein O gene expression is up-regulated in the human diabetic heart. Apolipoprotein O promoted cholesterol efflux from macrophage cells. To our knowledge, apolipoprotein O is the first chondroitin sulfate chain containing apolipoprotein. Apolipoprotein O may be involved in myocardium-protective mechanisms against lipid accumulation, or it may have specific properties mediated by its unique glycosylation pattern.

Obesity prevalence is reaching around 10-30% of the population in industrialized countries, and this rate is doubling every 10 years (1Basdevant A. Ann. Endocrinol. 2000; 61: 6-11PubMed Google Scholar). Obesity is leading to enhanced mortality (2Contaldo F. Pasanisi F. Finelli C. de Simone G. Nutr. Metab. Cardiovasc. Dis. 2002; 12: 190-197PubMed Google Scholar) and cardiovascular morbidity because of arterial hypertension and endocrino-metabolic abnormalities, such as type II diabetes or dyslipidemia, which are frequently seen in the X metabolic syndrome (3Mykkanen L. Kuusisto J. Pyorala K. Laakso M. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Moreover, obesity was shown to be an independent factor for cardiovascular risk (4Hubert H.B. Feinleib M. McNamara P.M. Castelli W.P. Circulation. 1983; 67: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (3179) Google Scholar). A positive correlation was noticed between being overweight and cardiovascular mortality, even after adjusting for the other risk factors. Clearly, obesity is an independent risk factor for cardiac failure. It was shown that obese subjects of both genders had a doubled risk for cardiac failure (5Kenchaiah S. Evans J.C. Levy D. Wilson P.W. Benjamin E.J. Larson M.G. Kannel W.B. Vasan R.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms involved in the development of heart failure in obese persons are far from being elucidated because few studies have looked specifically at the cardiac abnormalities associated with obesity. Obesity is characterized at a late stage by left ventricular hypertrophy, which leads to a metabolic change (6Kagaya Y. Kanno Y. Takeyama D. Ishide N. Maruyama Y. Takahashi T. Ido T. Takishima T. Circulation. 1990; 81: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A well known feature of obesity is the excessive deposition of fat in both adipose and nonadipose tissues. Excessive lipid accumulation in nonadipose tissue has been observed in pancreatic β-cells and in hearts from obese rats (7Unger R.H. Zhou Y.T. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2327-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 8Zhou Y.T. Grayburn P. Karim A. Shimabukuro M. Higa M. Baetens D. Orci L. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1784-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). In humans, fatty infiltration of the heart has been identified in ventricular and atrial myocardium (9Saphir O. Corrigan M. Arch. Intern. Med. 1933; 52: 410-428Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10Smith H.L. Willius F.A. Arch. Intern. Med. 1933; 52: 929-931Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 11Carpenter H.M. Am. Heart J. 1962; 63: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently, myocardial triglyceride accumulation has been positively correlated with body mass index and left ventricular mass (12Szczepaniak L.S. Dobbins R.L. Metzger G.J. Sartoni-D'Ambrosia G. Arbique D. Vongpatanasin W. Unger R. Victor R.G. Magn. Reson. Med. 2003; 49: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In addition, intramyocardial lipid overload was shown to be relatively common in nonischemic heart failure, especially in obese and diabetic patients (13Sharma S. Adrogue J.V. Golfman L. Uray I. Lemm J. Youker K. Noon G.P. Frazier O.H. Taegtmeyer H. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1692-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Lipotoxicity and induction of lipoapoptosis have been described as a consequence of the accumulation of excessive lipids in nonadipose tissues (14Unger R.H. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 15Schaffer J.E. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2003; 14: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). These lipotoxic phenomena are responsible, at least in part, for the alterations of cardiac function (16Christoffersen C. Bollano E. Lindegaard M.L. Bartels E.D. Goetze J.P. Andersen C.B. Nielsen L.B. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 3483-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Thus, the heart has to be protected from excessive lipid accumulation when lipid influx overflows the energy needs and the oxidative abilities of the heart. Expression of apolipoprotein B was shown to protect the heart from triglyceride accumulation in transgenic mice (17Nielsen L.B. Bartels E.D. Bollano E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27014-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, lipoprotein production by the heart has been proposed as a protective mechanism to unload surplus cellular lipids (18Veniant M.M. Nielsen L.B. Boren J. Young S.G. Trends Cardiovasc.

We and others developed a dog nutritional model of obesity using a hypercaloric high fat diet (21Hall J.E. Brands M.W. Dixon W.N. Smith Jr., M.J.

Differentially expressed genes, when compared with regular fed animals, were categorized into groups involved in metabolism, cell signaling, ionic regulation, cell proliferation, protein synthesis, and tissue remodeling. In addition, we found a set of cDNAs encoding proteins with unknown functions. Analysis of the coding sequences identified a putative new apolipoprotein, regulated by obesity in the heart, which is the subject of this study. Indeed, we found this protein in lipoproteins, thus we propose to name it apo 4The abbreviations used are: apo, apolipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; MTP, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; RTS, rapid translation system; CMM, canine pancreatic microsomal membrane; DMPC, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NBD, 22-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl)).4The abbreviations used are: apo, apolipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; MTP, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; RTS, rapid translation system; CMM, canine pancreatic microsomal membrane; DMPC, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NBD, 22-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl)).O because the last discovered apolipoprotein had been named apoN (25O'Bryan M.K.

Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5231-5242Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). cDNA sequences of differentially expressed genes were searched against the GenBank™ nonredundant data base using NCBI Blast. Open reading frames were translated into polypeptide sequences and analyzed for potential subcellular localization using Psort (26Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar) and SMART (27Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar), which predict signal peptide and transmembrane sequences. Conserved domains and protein family homologies were tested by scanning against PROSITE and PHOSPHO_SITES with PrositeScan (Swiss Institute for Bioinformatics) and ProDom motif data base (28Corpet F. Servant F. Gouzy J. Kahn D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In addition, peptide sequences were submitted to Mitoprot (29Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar) for ascertaining the potential for targeting to mitochondria and to NCBI Conserved Domain Search for identification of homology with the apolipoprotein A1/A4/E protein family. Homology of apoO cDNA nucleotide sequence among different species was performed using HomoloGene. The cloned dog cDNA fragment was highly homologous to the My025 brain cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF061264; 85% homologous to nucleotides 173-389). Because My025 cDNA is shorter but 100% homologous to the putative protein MGC4825, gene card information for this protein was collected. Peptide mass was calculated using the Peptide Mass program available on line. Multiple sequence alignments were done after the BLAST search of protein homology using the Protein Sequence Multiple Alignment program available on line. The predicted secondary structure of apoO was determined by computerized structure analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence from apoO using the nnpredict program (30Kneller D.G. Cohen F.E. Langridge R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). All animal procedures were performed according to the French Ministry of Agriculture guidelines. After ethical committee approval, all patients included in the study gave their written consent for sample collection and molecular analysis prior to their inclusion. Patients were carefully selected by the physicians from the Department of Cardiology, Toulouse University Hospital, prior to cardiac surgery for coronary by-pass resulting from coronary disease. Six diabetic patients out of 17 (35%) were on insulin. A similar proportion of dyslipidemic patients was observed in diabetic (35%) and nondiabetic (31%) patients groups. Despite the same proportion (6/17), the insulin-treated patients group was not identical to the dyslipidemic group. RNA was extracted by disrupting cells with an Utra Turrax (IKA) in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and prepared according to recommended procedures. Lipoproteins were isolated as described previously (31Collet X. Perret B.P. Simard G. Vieu C. Douste-Blazy L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty μg of total RNA were loaded per lane, and Northern blot analysis was performed using standard procedures. For human tissue expression analysis, the human endocrine system multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech) that contains 2 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA per lane was used. A 246-bp dog apoO cDNA fragment (85% homologous to the nucleotides 173-389 of the human apoO cDNA, GenBank™ accession number AF061264 with an E value of <1e-41) was used as a probe and labeled with α-[32P]dATP accordingly to the blot kit manual (New England Biolabs). Quickhyb solution (Stratagene) was used for overnight hybridization, and washes were done as recommended. Membranes were exposed 6-24 h in a PhosphorImager cassette, and exposure was analyzed in an SI445 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Band intensity was determined using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Proligo and designed with Primer Express software. The sequences are as follows: MTP forward, 5′-TGTTCAAGACATCCTACGTTTGGA-3′, and reverse, 5′-CATAATTGTGAGCGACCATTTCC-3′; apoB forward, 5′-ATATGAACTGGACCTGCACCAA-3′, and reverse, 5′-AACTTGCAAAAAATGCCATCCT-3′; apoO, forward, 5′-GGTGTCAGGAAACGTACTCCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-AACCCCCATTGAACCAAACTT-3′; and 18 S, forward, 5′-CGCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTC-3′ and reverse, 5′-TCCGACTTTCGTTCTTGATTA-3′. Real time PCR was performed with the SybrGreen master mix reagent in a GeneAmp 5700 apparatus (Applied Biosystems). Standard curve method was used for relative quantification of the PCR products, and gene expressions were normalized to 18 S RNA quantification. Real time PCR was statistically analyzed with SigmaStat software (SPSS). According to the human apoO cDNA sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence, two peptides were synthesized as follows: PR-16CK1, CYAAPKKDSPPKNSVK; PR-16CK2, CNFQPGNVKNSPGTK. The peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin according to standard procedures. After checking for the absence of autoimmune antibodies, two rabbits were intradermally injected with antigen every 2 weeks for 6 weeks. The rabbit immune response was checked by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and strong immunoreactivity against the peptides used for immunization was seen (data not shown). Human tissues were disrupted in mammalian cell lysis kit solution (Sigma) in the presence of mammalian protease inhibitors mix (Sigma), procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sixty micrograms of protein were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane BA85 (Schleicher & Schuell). Multi-Mark multicolored standard (Invitrogen) was used to determine the size of the proteins. For Western blot, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for 2 h in TBS (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk. Antisera incubation (1/3000 dilution) was performed in TBS/Tween 0.1% for 2 h. After three washes in TBS/Tween 0.1%, an anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (10-4 dilution) (Bio-Rad) was incubated for 2 h with the membrane in TBS/Tween 0.1%, 5% nonfat dry milk. Blots were washed three times in Tween/TBS, once with TBS, and then developed using Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), and signal detection was made using BioMax light film (Eastman Kodak). ApoO cDNA generated from reverse transcription of mRNA from human subcutaneous adipocytes was PCR-amplified using Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and the following primers: forward, 5′-CAT GCC ATG GTC AAG GTA ATT CAG AGG TCC GTG GGG C-3′, and reverse, 5′-CC GCT CGA GCT TAG TTC CAG GTG AAT TCT TCA CAT TTC CTG G-3′. PCR products were then purified on Nucleospin columns (Macherey & Nagel), digested by the NcoI and XhoI enzymes, and ligated by T4 ligase (Invitrogen) to the NcoI and XhoI sites in the pQETrisystem plasmid expression vector (Qiagen) that harbors two promoters, which allowed for production of the recombinant protein in bacterial and mammalian cells. To generate pIVEX-apoO plasmid, apoO cDNA was amplified using the forward primers 5′-CAT GCC ATG GTC AAG GTA ATT CAG AGG TCC GTG GGG C-3′ and reverse 5′-TCC CCC GGG CTT AGT TCC AGG TGA ATT CTT CAC ATT TCC TGG-3′ and was further cloned in the NcoI/SmaI sites of pIVEX2.3 (Roche Applied Science) for cell-free coupled in vitro transcription/translation large scale protein production in a proteomaster instrument (Roche Applied Science) using the RTS 500 proteomaster kit (Roche Applied Science). The cloned cDNAs were verified by DNA sequencing using ABI PRISM®BigDye™ Terminator version 3.1 Ready reaction cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and loaded on an ABI 3100 capillary electrophoresis DNA sequencing instrument (Applied Biosystems). 3T3-F442A, COS-1, and HepG2 cells were cultured under conditions as described previously (32Smih F. Rouet P. Lucas S. Mairal A. Sengenes C. Lafontan M. Vaulont S. Casado M. Langin D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 33Rouet P. Raguenez G. Tronche F. Yaniv M. N′Guyen C. Salier J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20765-20773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because HepG2 cells produced large amounts of apoO as well as other apolipoproteins like apoB and because this cell line was already used in studies dealing with MTP inhibitor effects on apolipoprotein secretions (34Wilcox L.J. Borradaile N.M. de Dreu L.E. Huff M.W. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chandler C.E. Wilder D.E. Pettini J.L. Savoy Y.E. Petras S.F. Chang G. Vincent J. Harwood Jr., H.J. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1887-1901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), we used this cell line to evaluate the effect of drugs on apoO secretion and glycosylation. For transfection experiments, COS cells were transfected with expression pQETrisystem plasmids encoding human apoO (15 μg of DNA) using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique, essentially as described (36Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4816) Google Scholar), and 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed, and total protein was assayed by Western blot. Plasmids pQETri were electrotransformed into Escherichia coli DH5α. Anti-ApoO Antibody Fluorescent Labeling—IgGs of anti-apoO serum were purified by Biologic LP low pressure liquid chromatography system (Bio-Rad) with protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences). Binding buffer was 50 mm Tris, pH 7, and elution buffer was 0.1 m glycine, pH 3, flow rate was 1.5 ml/min. Elution fractions containing IgG were concentrated using a Centricon filter device with YM-3 membrane (Millipore) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. These IgG were labeled with FluoroLink-Antibody Cy5 labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences), following the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence Immunodetection—H9c2 cells were seeded onto Falcon culture slides (BD Biosciences). Subconfluent cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in PBS containing 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature followed by 5 min at -20 °C. Cells were then washed five times in PBS and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in protein block serum-free buffer before being incubated for 90 min at 37 °C with a guinea pig anti-perilipin serum (Tebu-bio) diluted to 1/200 in protein block serum-free buffer. Cells were then washed once with PBS and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-guinea pig immunoglobulin secondary antibody (1/200) in protein block serum-free buffer. For apoO detection, secondary incubation was unnecessary because it was labeled with Cy5 (see above). Cells were washed five times with PBS and covered with a few drops of fluorescent mounting medium and coverslips before being analyzed on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). MTP Inhibitor Treatment—HepG2 cells were grown, in 6-well plates, to 80% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Medium was renewed every 2 days. Cells were incubated in a gassed, humidified incubator (5% CO2 at 37 °C). HepG2 cells were treated with several dilutions of MTP inhibitors, naringenin (Sigma) or CP-346086 (Pfizer) or vehicle as a control and further diluted in culture media for 24 h. Conditioned media proteins were precipitated with cold acetone. One volume of media with 4 volumes of cold acetone were kept overnight at -20 °C. This mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 11,000 × g and at 4 °C, and the pellet was air-dried and resuspended in denaturing buffer for Western blot analysis. ApoO and apoB in media were detected by immunoblotting in 10% SDS-PAGE with rabbit anti-apoO antisera and goat anti-apoB (Chemicon), diluted 1/3000E each. Secondary antibody were goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) and donkey antigoat IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), respectively; 1/10,000E dilutions were used for each antibody. ApoO and apoB bands were quantified by densitometry with Image J software. Naringenin Treatment—Naringenin was first dissolved in Me2SO (Me2SO concentration in cell culture media was under 0.2%). HepG2 cells were treated with 0, 10, 50, 100, or 200 μm naringenin. CP-346086 Treatment—CP-346086 was first dissolved in Me2SO (Me2SO concentration in cell culture media was under 0.1%). HepG2 cells were treated by 0, 5, 10, 50, or 100 nm CP-346086; Me2SO was added in control dishes at maximal concentrations. Deglycosylation of ApoO by Chondroitinase ABC—Chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4) (Sigma C-2905) digestions were performed according to Sigma protocol. Briefly, 60 μg of total serum proteins were incubated at 37 °C for at least 2 h in 50 mm Tris, 60 mm sodium acetate, 0.02% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 unit/ml chondroitinase ABC. p-Nitrophenyl-β-d-xyloside Treatment—HepG2 cells were treated for 24 h by 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 mm p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xyloside (Sigma) diluted in culture media. p-Nitrophenyl-β-d-xyloside was solubilized in methanol (methanol concentration in cell culture media was under 0.3%). Cells were scraped and lysed in mammalian cell lysis kit reagent (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. Protein quantities were measured by Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad). 30 μg of HepG2 proteins were immunoblotted in 10% SDS-PAGE with rabbit anti-apoO antibody (1/3000 dilution), and then goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1/10,000 dilution) was incubated with the membrane for 2 h. ApoO signal was quantified by densitometry with Image J software. ApoO was produced by in vitro transcription/translation using rabbit reticulocytes lysate systems (Promega), and pIVEX-apoO plasmid, combined with several doses of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. [35S]Methionine was incorporated into apoO during the translation. 6 μl of each sample were applied to a 10% SDS-PAGE, and digital imaging of the detected radioactive apoO was performed using a Typhoon 9400 (Amersham Biosciences). J774 mouse macrophages (ECACC) were grown in 6-well plates up to 80% confluence, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Medium was renewed every 2 days. Cells were incubated in a gassed, humidified incubator (5% CO2 at 37 °C). J774 cells were incubated for 24 h with 5 μg/ml NBD-cholesterol (Invitrogen), a fluorescent analogue of cholesterol, diluted in culture media. NBD-Cholesterol was first dissolved in pure ethanol (ethanol concentration in cell culture media was under 0.2%). Then cells were washed with culture medium and incubated for 12 h in culture medium with 0.2% bovine serum albumin fatty acidfree (Sigma) and 0.3 mm cAMP (Roche Applied Science). Cells were washed with culture medium. Reference wells were extracted with mammalian cell lysis kit (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. These wells provided base-line (time 0) values for total NBD-cholesterol content. Others wells were incubated for 4 h without or with recombinant apoA1 or recombinant apoO (see below) diluted at 10 μg/ml in culture media. Cellular cholesterol efflux was quantified by measuring the release of cellular NBD-cholesterol into the medium as a function of time. 50-μl aliquots of the incubation medium were centrifuged for 2 min at 100 × g to pellet any floating cells. Fluorescence was read with Fluoroskan ascent FL (Labsystems), set at excitation 470 nm and emission 530 nm. The percentage of cholesterol efflux was calculated by dividing the amount of fluorescence released into the medium by the total fluorescence in the cells at time 0 (37Sakr S.W. Williams D.L.

Cells were grown on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium with 30 μg/ml kanamycin (Euromedex) and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol (Sigma) at 37 °C with shaking at 300 rpm. A 200-ml culture was grown until A600 nm reached 0.6. This culture was induced by 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside final (Invitrogen) and was grown for 4 h. Cells were pelleted at 5,500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 5mm imidazole, pH 8). Cells were lysed on ice by sonication, and insoluble proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatant contained soluble apoA1 His-tagged. Recombinant apoA1 was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) under native conditions following the manufacturer's recommendations with a Biologic LP low pressure liquid chromatography system (Bio-Rad). Wash buffer was binding buffer with 20 mm imidazole (Sigma) and elution buffer was the same buffer with 250 mm imidazole, flow rate was 1 ml/min. Elution fractions containing apoA1 were dialyzed in PBS at 4 °C overnight. Production and Purification of Recombinant ApoO—ApoO was produced by cell-free coupled in vitro transcription/translation system in a proteomaster instrument (Roche Applied Science) using the RTS 500 proteomaster kit (Roche Applied Science) and pIVEX2.3-apoO vector. Recombinant apoO Histagged was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose in batch upon an artificial chaperone-assisted refolding method (39Daugherty D.L. Rozema D. Hanson P.E. Gellman S.H.

Reduced KATP channel expression caused by mutations in the channel proteins: sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) and Kir6.2, results in loss of channel function as seen in congenital hyperinsulinism. Previously, we reported that sulfonylureas, oral hypoglycemic drugs widely used to treat type II diabetes, correct the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane trafficking defect caused by two SUR1 mutations, A116P and V187D. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which sulfonylureas rescue these mutants. We found that glinides, another class of SUR-binding hypoglycemic drugs, also markedly increased surface expression of the trafficking mutants. Attenuating or abolishing the ability of mutant SUR1 to bind sulfonylureas or glinides by the following mutations: Y230A, S1238Y, or both, accordingly diminished the rescuing effects of the drugs. Interestingly, rescue of the trafficking defects requires mutant SUR1 to be co-expressed with Kir6.2, suggesting that the channel complex, rather than SUR1 alone, is the drug target. Observations that sulfonylureas also reverse trafficking defects caused by neonatal diabetes-associated Kir6.2 mutations in a way that is dependent on intact sulfonylurea binding sites in SUR1 further support this notion. Our results provide insight into the mechanistic and structural basis on which sulfonylureas rescue KATP channel surface expression defects caused by channel mutations.

Our results provide insight into the mechanistic and structural basis on which sulfonylureas rescue KATP channel surface expression defects caused by channel mutations. Regulation of insulin secretion by blood glucose relies on expression of functional ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels at the β-cell membrane. The β-cell KATP channel is an octameric protein complex comprising four pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) 2The abbreviations used are: SUR1, sulfonylurea receptor 1; CHI, congenital hyperinsulinism; PNDM, permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; WT, wild type. 2The abbreviations used are: SUR1, sulfonylurea receptor 1; CHI, congenital hyperinsulinism; PNDM, permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; WT, wild type. subunits (1Clement IV, J.P.

Channel activity is determined by the interplay between both channel subunits and intracellular ATP and ADP: binding of ATP to the Kir6.2 subunit inhibits channel activity, whereas binding of Mg2+-complexed ATP or ADP to the SUR1 subunit stimulates channel activity (4Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 5Ashcroft F.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6Nichols C.G. Nature. 2006; 440: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). In this way, channel activity serves as a reporter of intracellular ATP and ADP concentrations during glucose metabolism to control β-cell excitability, hence insulin secretion. Dysfunction of β-cell KATP channels because of mutations in the channel subunits Kir6.2 or SUR1 underlies congenital insulin secretion disorders (4Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 5Ashcroft F.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Whereas mutations causing loss of channel function lead to excessive insulin secretion and hypoglycemia as seen in patients with congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), those causing gain of channel function lead to insufficient insulin secretion and permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM). In congenital hyperinsulinism, two prominent mechanisms accounting for loss of channel function are loss of channel expression at the cell surface and loss of channel sensitivity to stimulation by MgADP (7Huopio H. Shyng S.L. Otonkoski T. Nichols C.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E207-E216Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In contrast, gain of channel function associated with heterozygous mutations in Kir6.2 or SUR1 in neonatal diabetes is thought to result from reduced channel inhibition at physiological concentrations of MgATP (8Hattersley A.T. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2503-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 9Proks P. Arnold A.L. Bruining J. Girard C. Flanagan S.E. Larkin B. Colclough K. Hattersley A.T. Ashcroft F.M. Ellard S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we recently showed that some PNDM-causing Kir6.2 mutations also reduce the efficiency of channel expression at the cell surface, although the loss of expression effect is masked by the ATP gating defect, resulting in a net gain of channel function, thereby the diabetes phenotype (10Lin C.W. Lin Y.W. Yan F.F. Casey J. Kochhar M. Pratt E.B. Shyng S.L. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 1738-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Sulfonylureas such as tolbutamide and glibenclamide are oral hypoglycemic drugs commonly used for treating type II diabetes; they do so by binding to the channel, primarily to the SUR1 subunit, and inhibiting channel activity (4Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 11Gribble F.M. Reimann F. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 875-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 12Melander A. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S151-S155Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Glibenclamide differs from tolbutamide in that it has an additional benzamido moiety attached to the sulfonylurea moiety. Glibenclamide binds to SUR1 with ∼1,000-fold higher affinity than tolbutamide, and blocks channel activity at a much lower concentration with the block being irreversible (11Gribble F.M. Reimann F. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 875-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Another class of compounds known as glinides, for example, meglitinide and repaglinide, which are structurally more related to the nonsulfonylurea half of glibenclamide, also bind SUR1 to inhibit channel activity (11Gribble F.M. Reimann F. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 875-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 13Quast U. Stephan D. Bieger S. Russ U. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 156-S164Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Bryan J. Vila-Carriles W.H. Zhao G. Babenko A.P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S104-S112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The binding pocket of glibenclamide is therefore proposed to comprise two sites: site A, which binds ligands with the short chain sulfonylurea moiety like tolbutamide and site B, which binds the non-sulfonylurea half of glibenclamide, as well as glinides such as repaglinide, as shown in Fig. 1 (13Quast U. Stephan D. Bieger S. Russ U. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 156-S164Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Brown G.R. Foubister A.J. J. Med. Chem. 1984; 27: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Sites A and B are thought to overlap to accommodate the negative charge and the central phenyl ring present in both sulfonylureas and glinides (Fig. 1) (15Brown G.R. Foubister A.J. J. Med. Chem. 1984; 27: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). SUR1 belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein family (16Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement IV, J.P. Boyd 3rd, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar); it has three transmembrane domains, TMD0, TMD1, and TMD2 each containing 5, 6, and 6 transmembrane segments, and two intracellular nucleotide-binding domains (Fig. 1) (17Conti L.R.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Structure-function and binding studies using recombinant channel proteins reveal two SUR1 regions that are critical for binding (14Bryan J. Vila-Carriles W.H. Zhao G. Babenko A.P. Aguilar-Bryan L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3360-3364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The first region, likely representing the A site, involves loop linking transmembrane segments 15 and 16 of TMD2. Mutation of a single serine residue (Ser1237 of rat SUR1) in this region abolishes [3H]glibenclamide binding to SUR1 and in electrophysiological experiments, the same mutation abolishes channel inhibition by tolbutamide and renders channel inhibition by glibenclamide readily reversible (20Ashfield R. Gribble F.M. Ashcroft S.J. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The second region involves the cytoplasmic loop between TMD0 and TMD1 (referred to as L0 by Bryan et al. (14Bryan J. Vila-Carriles W.H. Zhao G. Babenko A.P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S104-S112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)) where the B site may be located. Deletion of this cytoplasmic loop leads to loss of [3H]glibenclamide binding in recombinant SUR1 expressed in insect cells (21Mikhailov M.V. Mikhailova E.A. Ashcroft S.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and mutation of tyrosine 230 in L0 to alanine (Y230A) abolishes photoaffinity labeling of SUR1 by [125I]azidoglibenclamide (14Bryan J. Vila-Carriles W.H. Zhao G. Babenko A.P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S104-S112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although the effect of sulfonylureas on KATP channel activity has been known for a long time, their effect on KATP channel expression/trafficking was only recently appreciated. We have previously reported that sulfonylureas rescue surface expression defects of KATP channels caused by two CHI-associated SUR1 mutations, A116P and V187D (23Yan F. Lin C.W. Weisiger E. Cartier E.A. Taschenberger G. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11096-11105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). More recently, we found that several Kir6.2 mutations identified in PNDM also reduce channel surface expression and that the reduced surface expression is improved upon sulfonylurea treatment (10Lin C.W. Lin Y.W. Yan F.F. Casey J. Kochhar M. Pratt E.B. Shyng S.L. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 1738-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this work, we investigated the mechanism by which sulfonylureas correct the channel surface expression defects caused by the A116P or V187D mutations and by the PNDM-associated Kir6.2 mutations. Our results indicate that both the sulfonylurea and the glinide moieties contribute to the rescue effect and show that SUR1 mutations known to interfere with drug binding also interfere with the ability of these drugs to rescue the mutant channel surface expression defect. Interestingly and somewhat unexpectedly, we found that Kir6.2 is required for sulfonylureas to rescue the A116P and V187D mutant SUR1 at the cell surface. Conversely, sulfonylurea binding at SUR1 is necessary for the drug to improve surface expression of PNDM mutant channels harboring Kir6.2 mutations. These results suggest that sulfonylureas exert chaperoning effects on the SUR1·Kir6.2 complex rather than mutant SUR1 or Kir6.2 alone to correct KATP channel surface expression defects. Molecular Biology—FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was inserted at the N terminus of the hamster SUR1 cDNA by sequential overlap extension PCR (referred to as fSUR1), as described previously (24Cartier E.A. Conti L.R. Vandenberg C.A. Shyng S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Point mutations of SUR1 were introduced into hamster SUR1 cDNA in the pECE plasmid using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The FLAG epitope tag and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Rat Kir6.2 cDNA is in the pcDNAI vector. Mutant clones from multiple PCR were analyzed in all experiments to avoid false results caused by undesired mutations introduced by PCR. Immunofluorescence Staining—COSm6 cells were plated in 6-well tissue culture plates, transfected with 0.6 μg of fSUR1 and 0.4 μg of Kir6.2 per well using FuGENE 6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's directions. Transfected cells in each well were equally split and replated onto three coverslips 24 h post-transfection. Two coverslips were used for surface staining and one was used for total staining of fSUR1. For surface staining, cells were pretreated with or without 5 μm glibenclamide (diluted in culture medium from 10 mm stock dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)) 24 h prior to the staining. Staining was carried out as described previously (23Yan F. Lin C.W. Weisiger E. Cartier E.A. Taschenberger G. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11096-11105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma, diluted to 10 μg/ml in Opti-MEM containing 0.1% BSA) for 1 h at 4°C, washed with ice-cold PBS, then incubated with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson) for 30 min at 4 °C. After three 5-min washes in ice-cold PBS, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and viewed using an Olympus Fluoview confocal microscope. For total cellular staining of fSUR1, cells were fixed with cold (-20 °C) methanol for 5 min. Fixed cells were incubated with the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml PBS containing 0.1% BSA) at room temperature for 1 h, washed in PBS, incubated with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature, and washed again in PBS before imaging. Immunoblotting—COSm6 cells were plated in 35-mm dishes and transfected with KATP channel subunits using FuGENE 6 as previously described (23Yan F. Lin C.W. Weisiger E. Cartier E.A. Taschenberger G. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11096-11105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed 48-72 h post-transfection in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and Complete™ protease inhibitors (Roche). Proteins in cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE (8%), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with the M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), and visualized by chemiluminescence (Super Signal West Femto; Pierce). Chemiluminescence Assay—Transfection of COSm6 cells was carried out as described above. Drug treatment was initiated 32-40 h post-transfection and lasted for 24 h. Cells were then processed for chemiluminescence assays as described previously (25Taschenberger G. Mougey A. Shen S. Lester L.B. LaFranchi S. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17139-17146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C, preblocked in PBS, 0.1% BSA for 30 min, incubated in M2 anti-FLAG antibody (10 μg/ml) for 1 h, washed four times for 30 min in PBS, 0.1% BSA, incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson, 1:1000 dilution) for 20 min, and washed again four times for 30 min in PBS, 0.1% BSA. Chemiluminescence of each dish was quantified in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs) following a 5-s incubation in Power Signal Elisa Femto luminol solution (Pierce). All steps after fixation were carried out at room temperature. Electrophysiology—COSm6 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 and plated onto coverslips. The cDNA for the green fluorescent protein was cotransfected with SUR1 and Kir6.2 to facilitate identification of positively transfected cells. Patch clamp recordings were made 36-72 h post-transfection. All experiments were performed at room temperature as previously described (24Cartier E.A. Conti L.R. Vandenberg C.A. Shyng S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Micropipettes were pulled from non-heparinized Kimble glass (Fisher Scientific) on a horizontal puller (Sutter Instrument, Co., Novato, CA). Electrode resistance was typically 1.4-1.6 MΩ when filled with K-INT solution (below). Inside-out patches were voltage-clamped with an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Inc., Foster City, CA). The standard bath (intracellular) and pipette (extracellular) solutions (K-INT) had the following composition: 140 mm KCl, 10 mm K-HEPES, 1 mm K-EGTA (pH 7.3). ATP was added as the potassium salt. Tolbutamide and glibenclamide were dissolved in Me2SO at 300 or 10 mm, respectively, and diluted further in K-INT. Control experiments (see supplemental Fig. S1) confirm that Me2SO at the final concentrations used does not affect KATP channel activity (26Cartier E.A. Shen S. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7081-7090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All currents were measured at a membrane potential of -50 mV (pipette voltage = +50 mV), and inward currents shown as upward deflections. Data were analyzed using pCLAMP8 software (Axon Instrument). Off-line analysis was performed using Origin 6.1 and Microsoft Excel programs. Data Analysis—Data were presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using independent two-population two-tailed Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. TMD0 of SUR1 Does Not Confer the Rescue Effect of Sulfonylureas on Mutant Expression—Many CHI-causing SUR1 mutations have been reported to reduce surface expression of KATP channels by causing ER retention of the mutant channel (they are referred to as trafficking mutations hereafter for their inability to traffic normally to the plasma membrane) (23Yan F.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3833-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Of these, two mutations, A116P and V187D, were rescued by the pharmacological agent sulfonylurea (23Yan F. Lin C.W. Weisiger E. Cartier E.A. Taschenberger G. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11096-11105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that sulfonylurea may rescue these mutants by binding to the mutant protein and acting as chemical chaperones to facilitate channel biogenesis and trafficking. Because both A116P and V187D are located in TMD0, we first tested if sulfonylureas bind directly to TMD0 to facilitate mutant protein biogenesis and trafficking, even though TMD0 has not been implicated in sulfonylurea binding in prior studies (21Mikhailov M.V. Mikhailova E.A. Ashcroft S.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We compared surface expression of recombinant SUR1-TMD0 (amino acids 1-197) containing either the A116P or the V187D mutation in the presence or absence of 5 μm glibenclamide. Studies by others have shown that co-expression of SUR1-TMD0 with Kir6.2 C-terminal deletion mutant Kir6.2ΔC25, which lacks the -RKR-ER retention motif, reconstitutes “mini” KATP channels at the cell surface (27Chan K.W. Zhang H. Logothetis D.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3833-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 28Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41577-41580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Consistently, we observed cell surface expression of SUR1-TMD0 (with a FLAG epitope tag placed at the N terminus; referred to as fSUR1-TMD0) in COSm6 cells transiently transfected with the construct and Kir6.2ΔC25 using chemiluminescence assays (Fig. 2). By contrast, when the A116P or V187D mutations were introduced into fSUR1-TMD0, surface expression was greatly reduced (by >70%), even though the total mutant recombinant proteins were abundantly expressed as assessed by Western blots and immunofluorescent staining of permeabilized cells (not shown). Treating cells with 5 μm glibenclamide did not improve surface expression of the mutant fSUR1-TMD0. These results demonstrate that the TMD0 domain of SUR1 alone is insufficient to confer the sulfonylurea rescue effect. Restoration of A116P- and V187D-mutant Channel Expression by Sulfonylureas Is Dependent on Intact Sulfonylurea Binding Sites in SUR1—Several studies indicate that the high affinity tolbutamide binding site in SUR1 resides in transmembrane segments 13-16 (19Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Ashfield R. Gribble F.M. Ashcroft S.J. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Specifically, mutation of a serine residue in this region (Ser1237 of rat SUR1) to tyrosine abolishes the high affinity block of channel activity by tolbutamide (20Ashfield R. Gribble F.M. Ashcroft S.J. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The same mutation also reduces [3H]glibenclamide binding to SUR1 and renders channel inhibition by glibenclamide readily reversible (20Ashfield R. Gribble F.M. Ashcroft S.J. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). If sulfonylureas rescue the A116P and V187D trafficking mutants by binding to the channel protein, then introducing the S1237Y mutation should also reduce or abolish the ability of sulfonylureas to correct the trafficking defect. We made the equivalent sulfonylurea binding site mutation (S1238Y) in hamster SUR1 (16Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement IV, J.P. Boyd 3rd, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar) and examined how it affects the response of the A116P- or V187D-mutant channels to sulfonylureas. Initial assessment by immunofluorescent staining indicates that the S1238Y mutation by itself does not affect fSUR1 surface expression when coexpressed with Kir6.2; however, when combined with the A116P or V187D mutation, it indeed reduced or prevented the ability of glibenclamide to rescue the surface expression defect caused by the A116P and V187D mutations (Fig. 3). Staining of permeabilized cells transfected with the various mutants revealed similar total mutant protein expression levels. Consistent results were obtained using Western blot analysis. A representative blot of A116P fSUR1 in the WT or S1238Y background from cells treated with or without 5 μm glibenclamide for 24 h is shown in Fig. 4A. We next sought to quantify mutant channel expression at the cell surface in the presence or absence of sulfonylurea treatment. Although KATP current density provides a measure for surface expression of the SUR1-Kir6.2 octameric channel complex, it is not suitable for assessing the effect of glibenclamide on surface channel expression because glibenclamide, even after extensive washes, remains bound to channels rescued to the cell surface and inhibits channel activity (see supplemental Figs. S2 and S3) (23Yan F. Lin C.W. Weisiger E. Cartier E.A. Taschenberger G. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11096-11105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The inhibition by prebound glibenclamide in electrophysiological experiments causes underestimation of channel expression. We therefore resorted to chemiluminescence assays that have been used extensively in prior studies to quantify surface channel expression (23Yan F. Lin C.W. Weisiger E. Cartier E.A. Taschenberger G.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, channels containing the S1238Y-SUR1 mutation alone had surface expression levels comparable with that of the WT channels (see also Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S3A). However, when combined with the A116P- or V187D-SUR1 trafficking mutations, S1238Y completely abolished the rescue effect of tolbutamide at 300 (Fig. 4B) and 600 μm (not shown). The S1238Y mutation also significantly reduced the potency of glibenclamide rescue (Fig. 4C). In the WT background (no sulfonylurea binding mutation), 24-h treatment with 1 μm glibenclamide increased surface expression of the A116P mutant from 3.1 ± 0.7 to 34.5 ± 7.2% and the V187D mutant from 12.8 ± 1.6 to 49.2 ± 6.8% of WT channels. But in the S1238Y background, the same treatment only slightly increased surface expression of the A116P and V187D mutants, from 0.7 ± 1.0 to 6.6 ± 2.1% and 9.8 ± 1.4 to 15.6 ± 2.3% of WT, respectively. Increasing the concentration of glibenclamide to 5 μm led to a much greater effect on surface expression of the mutants (to 21.8 and 23.9% of WT for A116P and V187D, respectively; Fig. 4C). Thus, whereas tolbutamide response was abolished by the S1238Y mutation, the glibenclamide response appears to be only partially affected. Note that the Me2SO present in the sulfonylurea stock solutions had no effect on surface expression of the channel (data not shown).FIGURE 4Effect of the S1238Y mutation on the ability of sulfonylureas to rescue KATP channel trafficking defects in the presence of Kir6.2, analysis by immunoblotting and chemiluminescence assays. A, Western blot analysis of fSUR1. In cells expressing Kir6.2 and WT-fSUR1, two bands were observed: the lower core glycosylated band, or the immature band (open arrow) and the upper complex glycosylated band, or the mature band (solid arrow). For the A116P-fSUR1, however, only the immature band was detected in untreated cells (A116P); upon treatment with 1 μm glibenclamide for 24 h (A116P+Glib), the upper A116P-fSUR1 band became apparent, indicating rescue of the mutant protein out of the ER. When the S1238Y mutation was introduced into A116P-fSUR1 (A116P/S1238Y), the same glibenclamide treatment was less effective in promoting expression of the upper band (A116P/S1238Y+Glib). B, quantification of channel expression at the cell surface by chemiluminescence assays. COSm6 cells were co-transfected with Kir6.2 and one of the fSUR1 constructs indicated below the x-axis, and treated with or without 300 μm tolbutamide (Tolb) for 24 h prior to the assay. Surface expression of tolbutamide-treated cells was significantly higher than untr"

This genetic recoding process is known to play essential roles in the brain, due in part to changes in functional activities of edited neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels. Little is known, however, about the physiological regulation and function of A to I RNA editing in peripheral tissues and other biological processes. Here, we report that both ADAR1 and ADAR2 are expressed in the murine pancreatic islets, and ADAR2 is primarily localized in the islet endocrine cells. In contrast to ADAR1, ADAR2 transcripts in the pancreatic islets exhibit a nearly 2-fold increase in insulin-resistant mice chronically fed a high fat diet. Concurrent with this diet-induced metabolic stress, RNA editing in the islets is dramatically enhanced for the RNA transcripts encoding the ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit B. Moreover, ADAR2 protein expression is repressed in the islets under fuel deficiency condition during fasting, and this repression can be completely reversed by refeeding. We also show that, specifically in pancreatic β-cell lines, not only the expression of ADAR2 but also the glutamate receptor subunit B editing and ADAR2 self-editing are markedly augmented in response to glucose at the physiological concentration for insulin secretion stimulation. Thus, RNA editing by ADAR2 in pancreatic islets and β-cells is metabolically regulated by nutritional and energy status, suggesting that A to I RNA editing is most likely involved in the modulation of pancreatic islet and β-cell function.

RNA editing through the conversion of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) within pre-mRNAs is a genetic recoding process found in a variety of organisms, including mammals (1Bass B.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 817-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). The search for the RNA substrates targeted for this hydrolytic deamination modification has recently revealed abundant A to I editing sites in the human transcriptome, predominantly occurring in non-coding regions of the RNA, such as Alu repeats (2Levanon E.Y.

Neuron. 2002; 35: 17-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Previously reported studies indicate that A to I RNA editing plays critical roles in the function and development of the central nervous system, due in a large part to the regulation via editing of the activities of neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels, including the ionotropic glutamate receptors (GluRs), G-protein-coupled serotonin-2C subtype receptor, and Kv1.1 potassium channel (5Higuchi M.

Because inosine can be recognized as guanosine by the cellular protein translation apparatus, site-selective editing at crucial sites within the coding regions of RNA transcripts results in codon changes, and subsequently, altered functional behaviors of the encoded protein products. There are two major edit sites for the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) glutamate receptor subunit B (GluR-B), the Q/R and R/G sites, which have been most extensively studied. Editing at the Q/R site, which generates an arginine codon (CIG) via selective targeting of a glutamine codon (CAG) specifically by ADAR2 (11Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Higuchi M. Nature. 1996; 379: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), leads to dramatic reduction in the calcium permeability of the receptor channels (12Sommer B. Kohler M. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). Editing at the R/G site, targeted by both ADAR1 and ADAR2, converts an arginine (AGA) residue to glycine (IGA) and results in altered kinetic properties of the receptor channels characterized by faster recovery rates from desensitization (13Lomeli H. Mosbacher J. Melcher T. Hoger T. Geiger J.R. Kuner T. Monyer H. Higuchi M. Bach A. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1994; 266: 1709-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Recently reported lines of evidence also indicate that A to I RNA editing can modulate another RNA-mediated regulation pathway of gene expression, the biogenesis and maturation of microRNAs (14Yang W. Chendrimada T.P. Wang Q. Higuchi M. Seeburg P.H. Shiekhattar R. Nishikura K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Both ADAR1 and ADAR2 exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing (15Liu Y. George C.X. Patterson J.B. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4419-4428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16Kawahara Y. Ito K. Ito M. Tsuji S. Kwak S. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 363: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and two ADAR1 enzymes have been found in mammals as a result of the presence of multiple promoters: an interferon-inducible protein enzyme of ∼150 kDa (p150) and a constitutively expressed N-terminally truncated protein of about 110 kDa (p110) (17George C.X. Samuel C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4621-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 18George C.X. Wagner M.V. Samuel C.E. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5376-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Although little is known about the transcriptional regulation of ADAR2, the RNA transcripts encoding ADAR2 have been shown to undergo self-editing, which creates a 3′ splice site (AA to AI) in intron 4 responsible for subsequent alternative splicing (20Rueter S.M. Dawson T.R. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). This self-editing-mediated splicing event generates a 47-nucleotide insertion near the N-terminal portion and thus causes a frameshift in the coding region that is predicted to produce a 9-kDa inactive protein due to premature termination. Furthermore, studies in mice engineered to be incapable of self-editing indicate that this self-editing event represents a negative feedback mechanism in the modulation of ADAR2 expression (21Feng Y. Sansam C.L. Singh M. Emeson R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). RNA editing by ADARs has been shown to be progressively modulated during brain development (13Lomeli H. Mosbacher J. Melcher T. Hoger T. Geiger J.R. Kuner T. Monyer H. Higuchi M. Bach A. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1994; 266: 1709-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), and it is speculated that the extent of editing may be modulated by the “metabolic” state of the cell (4Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 2002; 35: 17-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Aberrantly high editing activity due to dysregulated ADAR enzyme in Drosophila leads to lethality at embryonic or larval stage (22Keegan L.P. Brindle J. Gallo A. Leroy A. Reenan R.A. O'Connell M.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2183-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although the precise regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood, dysfunction of RNA editing has been implicated in a number of disease states, such as epilepsy (9Brusa R. Zimmermann F. Koh D.S. Feldmeyer D. Gass P. Seeburg P.H. Sprengel R. Science. 1995; 270: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), chronic depression in suicide victims (23Gurevich I. Tamir H. Arango V. Dwork A.J. Mann J.J. Schmauss C. Neuron. 2002; 34: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (24Kawahara Y. Ito K. Sun H. Aizawa H. Kanazawa I. Kwak S. Nature. 2004; 427: 801Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), and malignant gliomas (25Maas S. Patt S. Schrey M. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Very little is known, however, about the physiological regulation and function of A to I RNA editing in tissues other than the brain, e.g. the peripheral tissues in energy metabolism and homeostasis, largely due to the severe phenotypes exhibited by the ADAR1-/- and ADAR2-/- mice (5Higuchi M. Maas S. Single F.N. Hartner J. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Feldmeyer D. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 26Wang Q. Khillan J. Gadue P. Nishikura K. Science. 2000; 290: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells play a central role in glucose metabolism and homeostasis, and β-cell malfunction is a critical component underlying the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (27Porte Jr., D. Kahn S.E. Diabetes. 2001; 50: S160-S163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Unger R.H. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundamental and Clinical Text. 3rd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2004: 141-149Google Scholar). The key function of the pancreatic β-cells is the regulated biosynthesis and adequate secretion of insulin in response to fluctuations of blood glucose level, which is tightly regulated both by nutrients and by hormonal modulators. Complex regulatory pathways exist for maintenance of normal glucose-responsive insulin secretion, including the glucose-sensing and insulin-signaling pathways (29Kulkarni R.N. Bruning J.C. Winnay J.N. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Normal insulin secretion characteristically displays a rapid response to glucose and a complex pulsatile profile, and any loss of the tight coupling between pulses of insulin secretion and pulses in glucose level manifests disordered β-cell function (30Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S. Nature. 2001; 414: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In the presence of insulin resistance arising from dysregulation of the homeostatic balance between energy storage in response to fuel nutrient intake and energy expenditure, failure of the pancreatic β-cells to compensate for decreased insulin sensitivity in muscle, fat, and liver causes hyperglycemia and diabetes (31Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3935) Google Scholar, 32Kahn B.B. Cell. 1998; 92: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Many genes involved in secretory functions are expressed similarly in both pancreas and brain, and murine adult pancreatic precursor cells seem to be able to differentiate toward both pancreatic and neural lineages (33Weir G.C. Bonner-Weir S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), including β-cells and neurons. This supports the notion that pancreatic islets and neurons share high similarity in cellular development. Moreover, functional ionotropic glutamate receptors are found to be expressed in pancreatic islets and pancreatic cell lines (34Gonoi T. Mizuno N. Inagaki N. Kuromi H. Seino Y. Miyazaki J. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16989-16992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Weaver C.D. Yao T.L. Powers A.C. Verdoorn T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12977-12984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and l-glutamate has been shown to stimulate insulin secretion in rat pancreas by acting on an excitatory amino acid receptor of the AMPA subtype (36Bertrand G. Gross R. Puech R. Loubatieres-Mariani M.M. Bockaert J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 106: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Given the fact that some ADAR-edited sites recode conserved and functionally important amino acid residues within genes involved in rapid electrical and chemical neurotransmission (37Hoopengardner B. Bhalla T. Staber C. Reenan R. Science. 2003; 301: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) in the central nervous system, we considered that A to I RNA editing by ADARs may play as yet unknown roles in the regulation of pancreatic β-cell function and systemic glucose metabolism. Here, we report that in murine pancreatic islets, both ADAR1 and ADAR2 deaminases are expressed and, similar to the findings reported for the brain, the Q/R site of GluR-B RNA is nearly completely edited (5Higuchi M. Maas S. Single F.N. Hartner J. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Feldmeyer D. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Moreover, ADAR2, but not ADAR1, expression in the pancreatic islets, as well as the ADAR2-targeted editing of GluR-B RNA, is regulated in vivo in response to metabolic stress conditions induced by high fat diet feeding or fasting. We have also observed that, specifically in pancreatic β-cell lines, glucose is able to stimulate not only the expression of ADAR2 but also the GluR-B editing and ADAR2 self-editing. These observations suggest that A to I RNA editing by ADAR2 is metabolically regulated and conceivably may serve previously unrecognized roles in the exquisite and intricate modulations of pancreatic islet and β-cell function. Mice and Cell Lines—C57BL/6N male mice and Sprague-Dawley rats (Shanghai Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd.) were housed in laboratory cages at a temperature of 23 ± 3 °C and a humidity of 35 ± 5% under a 12-h dark/light cycle (lights on at 6 a.m.). For diet-induced obesity mouse model (n = 20-30 per group), mice were randomly assigned with free access to one of the three experimental diets with 10 kcal%, 45 kcal%, and 60 kcal% fat (Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ). Mice were sacrificed at 20 weeks of age after 16 weeks on the indicated diets. For the fasting-refeeding model, 8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 6 per group) were either allowed free access to food or subjected to a 24-h fasting before sacrifice. A third group was fasted for 24 h and then allowed access to food ad libitum for another 24 h before being killed. All rats were fed normal chow (Shanghai Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd.), and all animals were sacrificed under anesthetic conditions. The experimental procedures and protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Institute for Nutritional Sciences. Rat INS-1 cell lines (a generous gift from Dr. Christopher B. Newgard, Duke University Medical Center) that possess robust glucose-stimulated insulin secretion properties were maintained under conditions as described (38Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Rat glioma C6 cells and mouse MIN6 cells (a generous gift from Dr. Dong Xie, Institute for Nutritional Sciences) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Rat pheochromocytoma PC-12 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). At 18 h before glucose stimulation assays, the medium was switched to fresh medium containing 2.8 mm glucose followed by culturing at 16.7 mm glucose for indicated period of time. Antibodies, Western Immunoblot, and Immunohistochemistry—Goat polyclonal ADAR2 (C-15) and ADAR1 (L-15) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal antibodies against β-actin, insulin, and glucagon were from Sigma, and α-tubulin was from Biomeda. Rabbit anti-somatostatin polyclonal antibody was from Chemicon. Guinea pig anti-pancreatic polypeptide antiserum was purchased from Linco Research. Fluorescein isothiocyanate AffiniPure donkey anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, and anti-guinea pig IgG, Texas Red AffiniPure donkey anti-goat IgG, and normal donkey serum were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. For Western immunoblot analysis, whole-cell extracts were prepared by lysis with CelLytic™ M (Sigma), and the lysate was sonicated for 30 s and centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g to remove the cellular debris. Tissue extracts were prepared by homogenization in the lysis buffer using a Polytron homogenizer followed by centrifugation. Proteins (∼40 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filter membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After incubation with the desired antibodies, the blots were developed using the Amersham Biosciences ECL Plus detection system. Immunolabeled protein bands of interest were quantified using a ChemiDoc imaging system and the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). For double immunostaining, pancreas slices were blocked for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with Triton and donkey serum (0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 2% normal donkey serum). The sections were then incubated for 4 h at room temperature with anti-ADAR2 antibody and antibodies against α-tubulin, insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide, respectively. For negative control, the staining was done without the anti-ADAR2 antibody. Following the incubation and washing with 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline, the sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with Texas Red or fluorescein isothiocyanate AffiniPure antibodies. Immunofluorescence images were obtained on a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope. Insulin Tolerance Test, Blood Glucose, and Serum Insulin Concentrations—After an 8-h fasting, animals were injected intraperitoneally with human insulin (Eli Lilly, 0.5 milliunits/g of body weight), and blood glucose concentrations were measured at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 min after insulin injection using a glucometer (FreeStyle). Serum insulin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay kit or mouse serum adipokine LINCOplex kit (Linco Research) with the Bio-Plex system (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pancreatic Islet Isolation—Pancreatic islets from mice and rats were isolated by the stationary digestion method (39Cui Y. Huang L. Elefteriou F. Yang G. Shelton J.M. Giles J.E. Oz O.K. Pourbahrami T. Lu C.Y. Richardson J.A. Karsenty G. Li C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 258-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, minced pancreas were digested with Liberase enzyme solution, and the digest was fractionated by centrifugation in preformed 13, 21, 23, and 25% Ficoll gradient solutions. The islet fractions were harvested between the 13-21% gradients into Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma), and individual mouse islets were handpicked with a pipette under a microscope. For rat islets, fractions were collected at the 13% Ficoll gradient from the second gradient centrifugation before preparation of the crude islet extract. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA from islets was isolated with a mirVana™ miRNA isolation kit (Ambion). Total RNA from mouse tissues and cultured β-cells was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by digestion with RNase-free DNase I (Roche Diagnostics) to eliminate possible DNA contamination. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers (Invitrogen). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using the SYBR Green PCR system (Bio-Rad), with actin serving as an internal control for normalization. Specific oligonucleotide primers for target gene sequences were listed in supplemental Table S1. Analysis of RNA Editing—For quantitative analysis of the Q/R site editing of GluR-B, PCR products targeting the pre-mRNA were amplified using a 5′-digoxigenin-labeled primer and digested by TauI (Fermentas), which can cleave the DNA fragments derived only from the edited RNA. After analysis by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, the digoxigenin-labeled DNA fragments were transferred onto a nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by a digoxigenin luminescent detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Editing efficiency was quantified using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). For assessment of the GluR-B R/G site editing, gel-purified PCR products were either directly sequenced to analyze the A/G electropherograms at the editing site or subcloned into pGEM®-T Easy Vector (Promega) for subsequent sequencing of individual clones. Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was performed for two groups, and one-way analysis of variance was performed for more than two groups, with p values of <0.05 considered statistically significant. Up-regulation of ADAR2, but Not ADAR1, Expression Levels in Pancreatic Islets of Obese Mice Fed High Fat Diet—To investigate the possible physiological function of A to I RNA editing in metabolic homeostasis, we first examined the tissue expression patterns of ADAR1 and ADAR2 genes in the diet-induced obesity (DIO) mouse model. The mice were fed for 16 weeks on one of the three experimental diets with 10% (LFD), 45% (HFD), and 60% fat (VHFD) in calories. In comparison with those on LFD, mice fed HFD and VHFD exhibited more dramatic body weight increases (Fig. 1A) with significant differences starting to be observed at 4 and 2 weeks, respectively. This could largely be attributed to the increases in body fat (data not shown). An insulin tolerance test showed that chronic feeding of HFD or VHFD resulted in apparently lowered insulin sensitivity, i.e. impaired hypoglycemic response to insulin, when compared with feeding of LFD (Fig. 1B). Concomitantly with the onset of severe insulin resistance in mice fed VHFD, overt hyperinsulinemia occurred progressively after 8 weeks (data not shown), and significantly higher blood insulin levels were observed in mice fed VHFD than those fed LFD at 16 weeks (8.66 ± 0.58 versus 0.84 ± 0.14 ng/ml, n = 17, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that in high fat diet-induced obesity, systemic insulin resistance developed in mice. Under these conditions, the pancreatic β-cells were presumably under metabolic stress, primarily because of the compensatory actions to meet the demand for excessive insulin production and secretion to maintain normal blood glucose level. In the DIO mice chronically fed HFD for 16 weeks, we then analyzed, by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), the levels and tissue distribution patterns of ADAR1 and ADAR2 mRNA. As expected, ADAR2 was most abundantly expressed in the brain (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, the pancreatic islets of mice fed HFD or VHFD showed a nearly 2-fold increase in the level of ADAR2 transcripts when compared with the control mice fed LFD (Fig. 1D, p < 0.05). On the other hand, no significant alterations in the ADAR2 mRNA level were evident in the other tissues examined, including brain, lung, liver, epididymal fat, and muscle of the DIO mice (Fig. 1D, p > 0.05). Among all the tissues examined, ADAR1 displayed prominent expression level in the pancreatic islets, with its relative abundance almost comparable with that detected in the brain. In contrast to ADAR2, ADAR1 transcript level showed little change in any tissue analyzed in the DIO mice (Fig. 1E, p > 0.05). Therefore, expression level of ADAR2 is up-regulated selectively in the pancreatic islets in the metabolically stressed DIO mice, indicating that ADAR2 and ADAR2-mediated RNA editing may be regulated in a manner that is unique to pancreatic islets. Cellular Localization of ADAR2 in Mouse Pancreatic Islets— We next examined the cellular localization of ADAR2 enzyme in mouse pancreatic islets by immunofluorescent histochemistry staining. Co-staining with dual antibodies against ADAR2 and tubulin demonstrated robust positive ADAR2 signals primarily in the islets, consistent with the tissue profile results for ADAR2 expression (Fig. 1D), whereas ADAR2 protein was nearly undetectable in the non-islet areas harboring other cell types, e.g. the pancreatic acinar cells (Fig. 2A). Whether the pancreatic islets were from the DIO or lean control mice, similar expression patterns of ADAR2 were observed in all four major endocrine cell types of the islets, as shown by co-localized signals from the double immunostaining using anti-ADAR2 antibody together with antibodies against insulin (β-cells; Fig. 2B), glucagon (α-cells; Fig. 2C), somatostatin (δ-cells; Fig. 2D), and pancreatic polypeptide (F- or pp-cells; Fig. 2E), respectively. Immunohistochemistry analysis was unable to reveal apparent differences in the relative abundance of ADAR2 protein in different endocrine cells. Nonetheless, the observation that ADAR2 appears to be expressed in an islet-specific fashion suggests a likely role for ADAR2 in the endocrine function of the pancreatic islets. Enhanced GluR-B RNA Editing in Pancreatic Islets under HFD-induced Metabolic Stress—To determine whether the enhanced expression level of ADAR2 in pancreatic islets leads to enhanced editing activity, we attempted to examine the site-selective A to I editing of the three best characterized coding RNA substrates, the RNA transcripts encoding GluR-B, serotonin 2C receptor, and Kv1.1 potassium channel. Although the serotonin 2C receptor mRNA and Kv1.1 potassium channel mRNA were undetectable, the GluR-B RNA was considerably expressed in the pancreatic islets when analyzed by RT-PCR. We measured the editing efficiency of the two known editing sites targeted by ADAR2 of the GluR-B RNA, the Q/R and R/G sites, using a TauI restriction digestion-based editing assay or by direct sequencing electropherogram analysis using the RT-PCR products. The editing at the Q/R site of the mature GluR-B mRNA was nearly 100% in the islets (data not shown) in both the DIO mice and the lean control mice, supporting the notion that edited GluR-B pre-mRNA might be spliced preferentially (5Higuchi M. Maas S. Single F.N. Hartner J. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Feldmeyer D. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Then we performed the analysis of the Q/R site editing at the pre-mRNA level. The Q/R site editing of the GluR-B pre-mRNA exhibited an increase by ∼2-fold in the islets from the obese mice fed HFD or VHFD when compared with that from the lean control mice fed LFD (45.9 or 47.9 versus 28.5%, n = 17, p < 0.01) (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, direct sequencing of the RT-PCR products demonstrated that editing at the R/G site of GluR-B mRNA also increased considerably in the DIO mice (Fig. 3C). Subsequent sequence analysis of 108 individual GluR-B cDNA subclones (54 clones each, respectively, for the LFD-fed control mice and for the VHFD-fed DIO mice) also ind"

We have shown previously that endogenously produced or exogenously added NO induces expression of BNIP3 (Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19kDa-interacting protein 3), leading to death of macrophages (Yook, Y.-H., Kang, K.-H., Maeng, O., Kim, T.-R., Lee, J.-O., Kang, K.-i., Kim, Y.-S., Paik, S.-G., and Lee, H. (2004) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 321, 298–305). We now provide evidence that Ras mediates NO-induced BNIP3 expression via the MEK/ERK/hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 pathway. (a) ras-Q61L, a constitutively active form of Ras, up-regulated BNIP3 protein expression by enhancing Bnip3 promoter activity, and ras-S17N, a dominant-negative form, and ras-C118S, an S-nitrosylation mutant, blocked NO-induced BNIP3 expression, suggesting that Ras acts downstream of NO and that NO activates Ras by nitrosylation. (b) U0126, a specific MEK inhibitor, completely abolished BNIP3 expression and the stimulation of promoter activity by NO and Ras, whereas 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one, SB203580, and wortmannin, specific inhibitors of soluble guanylyl cyclase, p38 MAPK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, respectively, had no effect. Ras, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 were sequentially activated by NO treatment of macrophages. (c) Mutation of the HIF-1-binding site (hypoxia-response element) in the Bnip3 promoter abolished BNIP3 induction, and HIF-1α was strongly induced by NO. (d) Transient expression of activated Ras promoted macrophage death, as did NO, and this Ras-mediated cell death was inhibited by silencing BNIP3 expression. These results suggest that NO-induced death of macrophages is mediated, at least in part, by BNIP3 induction. Nitric oxide (NO) produced by NO synthases causes nitration and nitrosylation of cellular factors. We have shown previously that endogenously produced or exogenously added NO induces expression of BNIP3 (Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19kDa-interacting protein 3), leading to death of macrophages (Yook, Y.-H., Kang, K.-H., Maeng, O., Kim, T.-R., Lee, J.-O., Kang, K.-i., Kim, Y.-S., Paik, S.-G., and Lee, H.

These results suggest that NO-induced death of macrophages is mediated, at least in part, by BNIP3 induction. Macrophages play an indispensable role in protecting organisms from invading pathogens. When activated by pathogenic microorganisms, they produce various immune mediators, including a burst of nitric oxide (NO) via inducible NO synthase (1MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar). The released NO is cytotoxic and essential for destroying bacteria. It is also toxic to host cells, including the macrophages themselves (2Albina J.E. Cui S. Mateo R.B. Reichner J.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5080-5085PubMed Google Scholar, 3Messmer U.K. Ankarcrona M. Nicotera P. Brune B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and macrophages have been used as models of NO-induced apoptosis. NO-induced apoptosis is accompanied by cytochrome c release, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and extensive cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (4Brockhaus F. Brune B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6403-6410Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Hortelano S. Alvarez A.M. Bosca L.

There is also evidence for caspase-independent NO-induced cell death pathways (7Kim S.O. Han J. J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Ras was first identified as the product of an oncogene promoting cell cycle progression (8Coleman M.L. Marshall C.J. Olson M.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Mutations in the ras gene have been identified in numerous human cancers (9Adjei A.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1062-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar), but ras, like other oncogenes, can also induce apoptosis or cell cycle arrest (10Cox A.D. Der C.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8999-9006Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 11Chang F. Steelman L.S. Shelton J.G. Lee J.T. Navolanic P.M. Blalock W.L. Franklin R. McCubrey J.A. Int. J.

Ras activation and inactivation are catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating protein. Ras can also be activated by S-nitrosylation at Cys118, which promotes GDP/GTP exchange (12Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol.

The NO modification of Ras has the same effect as the binding of guanine nucleotide exchange factors to Ras and can lead to stimulation of downstream signaling pathways. Ras is a physiological target of endogenously produced NO through NO synthase (16Yun H.-Y. Gonzalez-Zulueta M. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5773-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), but the physiological role of NO-activated Ras remains to be identified. BNIP3 (Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19kDa-interacting protein 3) was first discovered in a yeast two-hybrid screen as interacting with the adenovirus E1B 19-kDa protein, a homolog of Bcl-2 (17Boyd J.M.

BNIP3 is a pro-apoptotic transmembrane protein that is inserted in the outer mitochondrial membrane and belongs to the BH3 (Bcl-2 homology 3) domain-only subfamily (18Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 19Yasuda M. Theodorakis P. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. J.

A mutant form lacking its transmembrane domain and C-terminal region is not localized to mitochondria and loses its proapoptotic activity (18Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C.

Therefore, the transmembrane domain of BNIP3, but not the BH3 domain, is required for mitochondrial targeting and pro-apoptotic function. Overexpression of BNIP3 leads to opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, thereby abolishing the proton electrochemical gradient, and this is followed by chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation (22Vande Velde C. Cizeau J. Dubik D. Alimonti J. Brown T. Israels S. Hakem R. Greenberg A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5454-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 23Kim J.Y. Cho J.J. Ha J. Park J.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 398: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). BNIP3 can be induced by hypoxia and plays a role in hypoxic cell death in many cell lines derived from carcinomas, macrophages, and endothelial cells (24Bruick R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9082-9087Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 25Sowter H.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Watson P. Greenberg A.H. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6669-6673PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of BNIP3 in hypoxic cells is regulated mainly at the level of transcription and is under the control of the transcription factor HIF-1. In addition, BNIP3 is overexpressed even in some well vascularized tumors and non-hypoxic cells (25Sowter H.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Watson P. Greenberg A.H. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6669-6673PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that there may be BNIP3-inducing stimuli other than hypoxia. Several candidate factors that can increase BNIP3 expression have been reported recently. Pleomorphic adenomas gene-like 2 (PLAGL2) protein induces death of Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts and neuroblastoma cells and promotes the accumulation of BNIP3 (26Mizutani A. Furukawa T. Adachi Y. Ikehara S. Taketani S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15851-15858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). BNIP3 has also been shown to be involved in CD47-induced apoptosis of Jurkat T cells and in activation-induced death of effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes (27Lamy L. Ticchioni M.

We showed recently by microarray analysis that endogenously produced or exogenously added NO activates the Bnip3 promoter and induces expression of BNIP3 protein in RAW264.7 macrophages under normoxic conditions (29Yook Y.-H. Kang K.-H. Maeng O. Kim T.-R. Lee J.-O. Kang K.-i. Kim Y.-S. Paik S.-G. Lee H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Peritoneal macrophages from NO synthase-null mice fail to produce BNIP3 in response to lipopolysaccharide, and overexpression of BNIP3 leads to apoptosis of the macrophages. These data led to the conclusion that BNIP3 is involved in NO-induced macrophage death. In this study, we report that BNIP3 induction by NO is mediated by Ras, followed by MEK, ERK, and HIF-1. Ras activation also induces death of macrophages, and antisense silencing of BNIP3 expression greatly reduces death, suggesting that it results from up-regulation of BNIP3. Cell Culture—Mouse RAW264.7 macrophages and human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and antibiotics/antimycotics (Invitrogen). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Construction of Expression Plasmids—Human and mouse Bnip3 cDNAs were prepared from total RNAs of HEK293T cells and RAW264.7 macrophages, respectively. The total RNAs were reverse-transcribed, and BNIP3 was amplified by PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) as described previously (29Yook Y.-H. Kang K.-H. Maeng O. Kim T.-R. Lee J.-O. Kang K.-i. Kim Y.-S. Paik S.-G. Lee H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of the primers were based on BC046603 (mouse; GenBank™ Data Bank) and AL162274 (human; GenBank™ Data Bank). The pcDNA3.1(–) vector was used to clone an antisense Bnip3 cDNA. The putative mouse Bnip3 promoter region was searched with NT_039435 (mouse chromosome 7; GenBank™ Data Bank). A promoter fragment (bp –636 to –1; +1 indicates the translation start site) was amplified with primers 5′-ACTACAGATCTCGTGCATAGAGACAGCGAGACCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATCCACCATGGTGGCTCGGCAAAGGAGCC-3′ (reverse) and mouse genomic DNA as a template, and the product was cloned upstream of luc+ in the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). 5′-Serial deletion constructs were generated by PCR using appropriate primers and the 636-bp Bnip3 promoter as template, followed by subcloning into the pGL3-Basic vector. Analysis of the putative Bnip3 promoter sequences for transcription factor-binding sites was done with the MatInspector program (Genomatix Software GmbH). To mutate the HIF-1-binding site (hypoxia-response element), Egr-1-binding site, and p53-binding site in the region from bp –249 to –214 of the Bnip3 promoter, point mutations were introduced into the pGL3/281-bp Bnip3 promoter by overlap PCR. Mutations of the binding sites were prepared (underlined and in boldface): wild-type HIF-1, CGCGCCGCACGTGCC; mutant HIF-1, CGCGCCGCACCACCC; wild-type Egr-1, GCCCCGCCCATGCCG; mutant Egr-1, GCCCGTGCCATGCCG; wild-type p53, GCCCATGCCGGCGCACGCGCC; and mutant p53, GCCAATTCCGGCGAACTCGCC. Vectors expressing pTRE-ras-Q61L, pTRE-ras-S17N, and pcDNA3.1(+)-ras-C118S were kind gifts of Dr. Hye-Young Yun (Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea) (30Jeong H.S. Kim S.W. Baek K.J. Lee H.S. Kwon N.S. Kim Y.M. Yun H.-Y. J. Neurooncol. 2002; 60: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The pcDNA3.1(+)-ras-Q61L and pcDNA3.1(+)-ras-S17N vectors were constructed by cloning the corresponding inserts into the BamHI site of the pcDNA3.1(+) vector. To clone Pro-GFP-BNIP3, the PCR-amplified product obtained using GFP-BNIP3 and primers 5′-ACCGGTCGCCACCATGGTGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTTATCTAGATCCGGTGGATCC-3′ (reverse) was subcloned into the vector for the pGL3/281-bp Bnip3 promoter after digestion with NcoI/XbaI. In this way, the luciferase reporter gene was replaced with GFP-BNIP3, as depicted in Fig. 5A. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega Corp.), and semiquantitative PCR was performed with the following primer pairs: mouse BNIP3, 5′-AGAACCTGCAGGGATGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAAGTTGTCAGACGCCCC-3′ (reverse); human BNIP3, 5′-CCCGGGATGCAGGAGGAGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGTGCGCTTCGGGTGTTTA-3′ (reverse); and β-actin, 5′-GTGGGGCGCCCCAGGCACCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3′ (reverse). PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and ethidium bromide staining. All reactions were performed in duplicate. Assay of Cell Viability—Cells were plated in triplicate at 1 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates, treated as desired, and incubated for 12, 24, 36, and 48 h at 37 °C. For the last 4 h of incubation, 50 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT (Sigma) was added to each well. The plates were centrifuged; the supernatants were carefully aspirated; and 100 μl of 0.04 n HCl/isopropyl alcohol was incubated in each well for 10 min. Absorbances were recorded with a microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at 540 nm. For propidium iodide staining of apoptosis, cells were gently harvested using 0.05% trypsin, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with 100 μg/ml propidium iodide. The percentage of cell death was measured by counting propidium iodide-stained cells with a FACScan (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed with ModFitLT Version 3.0 software. Western Blot Analyses—Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (29Yook Y.-H. Kang K.-H. Maeng O. Kim T.-R. Lee J.-O. Kang K.-i. Kim Y.-S. Paik S.-G. Lee H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured cells (5 × 106 cells/100-mm culture dish) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 7.5), and freshly added protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). The cells were incubated on ice for 20 min and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. To prepare nuclear extracts, the cells were incubated on ice for 15 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was incubated in lysis buffer on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation, the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Samples containing 20 μg of protein were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in a Mighty Small Transphor unit (Amersham Biosciences). For Western blotting of BNIP3 protein, equivalent numbers of cells were lysed in SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 0.2 m MgCl2. Equal loading was verified by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-human HIF-1α (catalog no. NB 100-123) from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO); anti-Ras (clone RAS10) from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY); anti-ERK1/2 (catalog no. 9102), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (catalog no. 9101), anti-MEK1/2 (catalog no. 9122), and anti-phospho-MEK1/2 (catalog no. 9121) from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA); anti-BNIP3 (catalog number ab10433) from Abcam (Cambridge, UK); and rabbit anti-human p53 (catalog no. sc-6243), anti-cyclin D1 (catalog no. sc-753), anti-Bad (catalog no. sc-7869), and anti-Bax (catalog no. sc-493) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (catalog number T5168) was from Sigma. Ras Activity Assay—Ras activity was measured with a Ras activation assay kit (Upstate) detecting Ras bound to the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1, which specifically binds GTP-bound Ras. Briefly, RAW264.7 cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 30 min in the kit lysis buffer with freshly added protease inhibitor mixture. Active Ras was precipitated using a glutathione S-transferase fusion of the Raf-1 Ras-binding domain bound to glutathione-agarose beads by incubation for 45 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Western blotting with anti-Ras antibody (clone RAS10) was used to detect bead-bound activated Ras. Positive and negative controls were prepared by in vitro labeling of samples with either GTPγS or GDP, respectively, prior to affinity precipitation (data not shown). Transient Transfections—Transfection was performed with Transfectin™ lipid reagent (Bio-Rad). For reporter assays, 1.5 × 105 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at least 12 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of reporter plasmids and 0.3 μg of pRL-TK (an internal control plasmid expressing the Renilla luciferase gene; Promega Corp.). For cotransfection in reporter assays, 0.5 μg of reporter plasmids and 1.5 μg of expression vectors were used along with 0.3 μgof pRL-TK. In the case of transfection for Western blotting, 2 × 106 cells were seeded in 100-mm plates and incubated with 10–30 μg of ras-Q61L or mock vectors in the presence or absence of 20 μg of antisense Bnip3 plasmid for 20–30 h. Dual-luciferase Assays—Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured sequentially with a VICTOR3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Corp.). Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to Renilla luciferase activities. Fluorescence Microscopy—RAW264.7 macrophages were seeded on coverslips in 12-well plates and transiently transfected with Pro-GFP-BNIP3 vectors and ras-Q61L or mock expression vectors in the presence or absence of 100 μm SNAP (Sigma). After 24 h, they were washed with phosphate-buffered saline; fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5–10 min followed by 50 mm NH4Cl for 1–2 min; and permeabilized in 5% bovine serum, 0.1% saponin, and 0.1% NaN3 with phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature. After staining with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) for 5 min, the cells were mounted on slide glasses. Fluorescent images were acquired with a Zeiss confocal microscope. NO Induces BNIP3 Expression—Induction versus suppression of apoptosis by NO is largely concentration- and cell type-dependent. We determined previously the concentration of SNAP (an NO donor) equivalent to the concentration of endogenous NO released by activated RAW264.7 macrophages (29Yook Y.-H. Kang K.-H. Maeng O. Kim T.-R. Lee J.-O. Kang K.-i. Kim Y.-S. Paik S.-G. Lee H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We used lipopolysaccharide/interferon-γ as an endogenous NO inducer because lipopolysaccharide/interferon-γ increased the expression of inducible NO synthase and caused the release of endogenous NO; ∼20 μm nitrite accumulated in the culture medium after exposure to 500 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide for 24 h, and a similar amount of nitrite was generated by 100 μm SNAP under the same conditions. In this study, we used 100 μm SNAP to treat the RAW264.7 cells unless indicated otherwise. Cells were exposed to SNAP for 3–24 h, harvested, and subjected to RT-PCR (Fig. 1A). Induction of Bnip3 mRNA reached a maximum after 9 h of SNAP treatment. BNIP3 protein increased in a dose-dependent manner between 100 and 500 μm and reached a maximum at 12 h (Fig. 1B). We have shown previously that NO stimulates Bnip3 promoter activity and that the NO-responsive sites of the mouse Bnip3 promoter are located within the 281-bp region upstream of the translation initiation site. The activity of this 281-bp Bnip3 promoter region was also induced in a dose-dependent manner by SNAP (Fig. 1C). Evidently NO-induced BNIP3 protein expression is accompanied by increased transcript levels and promoter activity, suggesting that NO regulates BNIP3 expression at the level of transcription. BNIP3 Induction Is Not Controlled by Guanylyl Cyclase but by the MEK Signaling Pathway—We examined whether NO induces BNIP3 expression via cGMP because NO activates soluble guanylyl cyclase (31Bogdan C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 66-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). When the cells were pretreated with various concentrations of 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one, a specific soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, NO-induced Bnip3 expression was not affected (Fig. 2A), suggesting that it is not controlled by the soluble guanylyl cyclase/cGMP pathway. Next, we tested the roles of the MAPK and PI3K pathways, which are among the major signal transduction pathways induced by growth factors, cytokines, or stress. Cells were pretreated with U0126, SB203580, or wortmannin (or LY294002), inhibitors of MEK, p38 MAPK, and PI3K, respectively. Only U0126 inhibited Bnip3 induction (Fig. 2B). Pretreatment with U0126 also blocked luciferase expression from the 281-bp Bnip3 promoter, whereas SB203580 and wortmannin had barely any inhibitory effect (Fig. 2C). To investigate whether the MEK pathway is activated by SNAP, we performed Western blotting with anti-phospho-MEK1/2 and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies. Phosphorylation of both MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 was detected within 30 min (Fig. 3, A and B), with a peak between 1 and 2 h. The effect of U0126 treatment on NO-induced BNIP3 protein expression was also examined. U0126 treatment completely inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and reduced expression of BNIP3 protein to its basal level (Fig. 3C). Because Ras is an upstream regulator of the MEK/ERK pathways (8Coleman M.L. Marshall C.J. Olson M.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 9Adjei A.A.

Gonzalez-Zulueta M. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5773-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), we analyzed Ras activity in the NO-treated cells. Pulldown assays using the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 revealed a marked increase in activated GTP-bound Ras within 30 min of SNAP treatment, whereas total Ras expression was not changed (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that NO-induced BNIP3 expression is controlled by the MEK/ERK pathway and suggest that Ras is an upstream regulator. Ras Induces BNIP3 Expression via the MEK Pathway—The involvement of Ras in NO-induced BNIP3 expression was confirmed using plasmids bearing constitutively active ras (Q61L mutant), dominant-negative ras (S17N mutant), and mutant ras with the major S-nitrosylation site changed to serine (C118S mutant). The expression levels of the mutant Ras proteins in the transfected HEK293T cells were comparable (Fig. 4A). When we measured the promoter activity of Bnip3 in cells transfected with the ras mutant vectors and the Bnip3-luciferase reporter plasmid, the ras-Q61L mutant activated the Bnip3 promoter, whereas the ras-S17N and ras-C118S mutants had no effect (Fig. 4B). Next, we tested whether Ras activation is on the same pathway as NO activation. As expected, U0126, which inhibits NO-induced Bnip3 expression, also blocked Ras-induced Bnip3-luciferase reporter activity, whereas SB203580 and wortmannin have hardly any inhibitory effect (Fig. 4C). We also found that mutants ras-S17N and ras-C118S inhibited Bnip3 induction by NO when they were transfected into the cells followed by treatment with SNAP. Although ras-C118S is not a dominant-negative mutant, its ectopic expression at high levels seems to prevent endogenous Ras from signaling, as shown previously (13Lander H.M. Hajjar D.P.

Schwartz G.D. Lander H.M. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37315-37320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As expected, ras-Q61L was not inhibitory but rather had an additive effect on NO-dependent induction of Bnip3 promoter activity (Fig. 4D). In the ras-Q61L-transfected cells, high concentrations of SNAP did not have a clear-cut concentration-dependent effect on the induction of Bnip3 promoter activity, probably because some of the ras-Q61L-transfected cells died at those high doses of SNAP, as discussed below. Collectively, these results suggest that activation of Bnip3 promoter activity by Ras probably occurs by the same signaling pathway as that by NO. Ras seems to act downstream of NO to induce BNIP3 expression, and NO may act by nitrosylating Ras. We next examined whether BNIP3 protein is induced by Ras activation. We have shown previously that a GFP-BNIP3 fusion protein has the same effect as BNIP3 in inducing apoptosis of macrophages (29Yook Y.-H. Kang K.-H. Maeng O. Kim T.-R. Lee J.-O. Kang K.-i. Kim Y.-S. Paik S.-G. Lee H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We constructed a plasmid (Pro-GFP-BNIP3) in which GFP-BNIP3 is under the control of the 281-bp Bnip3 promoter, as depicted in Fig. 5A. RAW264.7 cells were transfected with Pro-GFP-BNIP3 and ras-Q61L with or without SNAP treatment, and GFP-positive cells were counted. GFP-BNIP3 was completely absent from nuclei (Fig. 5A), in accord with the previous results. In mock-transfected cells not exposed to SNAP, the number of GFP-positive cells was very low. As expected, this number increased (∼8-fold) in response to 100 μm SNAP (Fig. 5B), and cotransfection with ras-Q61L also enhanced GFP-BNIP3 expression. When"
https://openalex.org/W2019546125,"The EBER genes of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are transcribed by RNA polymerase (pol) III to produce untranslated RNAs that are implicated in oncogenesis.

Although BDP1 is the only TFIIIB subunit induced by EBV, its induction is sufficient to stimulate EBER expression in vivo, implying a limiting function.

Rickinson A.B. Nature Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). The EBV genome contains two small, well conserved adjacent genes that are transcribed by RNA polymerase (pol) III, called EBER1 and EBER2 (2Rosa M.D. Gottlieb E. Lerner M. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 3Arrand J.R. Young L.S. Tugwood J.D. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 983-986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their transcripts are the most highly expressed viral products during latent infection and immortalization of human B lymphocytes by EBV, accumulating in ∼107 copies/cell (4Arrand J.R. Rymo L. J. Virol. 1982; 41: 376-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As such, EBERs are used diagnostically to establish the EBV status of tumors by in situ hybridization (5Khan G. Coates P.J. Kangro H.O. Slavin G. J. Clin. Pathol. 1992; 45: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6Arrand J.R. Epstein-Barr Virus Rep. 2000; 7: 145-149Google Scholar). Deletion of the EBER genes does not prevent EBV from infecting or immortalizing B lymphocytes in culture (7Swaminathan S. Tomkinson B. Kieff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1546-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), but this may reflect a redundancy of function within the large viral genome. Indeed, EBERs can stimulate DNA and protein synthesis when transfected into normal cord blood lymphocytes in the absence of other viral genes (8Zeuthen J. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1983; 106: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 9Zeuthen J. Adv. Viral Oncol. 1983; 3: 183-200Google Scholar). Transfection of EBER genes into NIH3T3 cells or EBV-negative BL lines can allow them to form colonies in soft agar (10Laing K.G. Matys V. Clemens M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 311Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 11Laing K.G. Elia A. Jeffrey I. Matys V. Tilleray V.J. Souberbielle B. Clemens M.J. Virology. 2002; 297: 253-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the EBER-transfected BL cells can produce tumors in mice (12Komano J. Maruo S. Kurozumi K. Oda T. Takada K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9827-9831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ruf I.K. Rhyne P.W. Yang C. Cleveland J.L. Sample J.T. J.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because EBER transcripts are not translated, these remarkable discoveries provided the first evidence of oncogenic RNA. The massive expression of EBER genes is a striking feature of EBV-transformed cells, yet little is known about how it is achieved. Several observations suggest that it is not simply due to inherent strength of the EBER promoters but instead requires EBV-induced changes to the cellular environment. For example, stable transfection of EBER1 alone allowed maximal expression of ∼105 transcripts/cell, whereas latent infection with the EBV genome can result in ∼107 EBER1 transcripts/cell (11Laing K.G. Elia A. Jeffrey I. Matys V. Tilleray V.J. Souberbielle B. Clemens M.J. Virology. 2002; 297: 253-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Lerner M.R. Andrews M.C. Miller G. Steitz J.A. Science. 1981; 211: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). However, significant EBER expression only becomes apparent 36 h after infection, following the appearance of other EBV latent gene products (16Rooney C. Howe J.G. Speck S.H. Miller G. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1531-1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, when latently infected cells switch to lytic viral replication, EBER gene transcription decreases dramatically (17Greifenegger N. Jager M. Kunz-Schughart L.A. Wolf H. Schwarzmann F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data point to a strong influence of trans-acting factors in controlling the EBERs. We present evidence that the high levels of EBER expression in latently infected tumor cells reflect changes to the host transcription machinery. Thus, the pol III-specific transcription factors TFIIIC and BDP1 are both overexpressed in EBV-positive cells of lymphoid or epithelial origin. This is associated with a specific increase in levels of some pol III products. We show that induction of TFIIIC may be mediated, in part, by ATF-2, which undergoes an activating phosphorylation in response to EBV. ATF-2 also interacts with the EBER genes, which may further enhance their transcription. These combined effects can explain the high levels of EBER RNA that are diagnostic of EBV-associated tumors (5Khan G. Coates P.J. Kangro H.O. Slavin G. J. Clin. Pathol. 1992; 45: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6Arrand J.R. Epstein-Barr Virus Rep. 2000; 7: 145-149Google Scholar).

Primers 5′-GTTTGCAGTTCCCCTGGTTAC-3′ and 5′-CTTCGTCCAACAACGACTCC-3′ were used for the amplification of the TFIIIC220 promoter region, and the primer pair 5′-TCTCCCCTTTTTGACACTGC-3′ and 5′-AGGGGGAGGAGTAATTGTGG-3′ was used for amplification of the TFIIIC110 promoter region. For both TFIIIC220 and TFIIIC110, amplification conditions were 94 °C for the initial denaturation, followed by 27 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s and finally 4 min at 72 °C. Promoter Constructs and Mutagenesis—The TFIIIC220 primers above were used to amplify from HeLa genomic DNA a fragment that was cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) to give pGEM-220. Reporter construct pGL-220 was then made by digesting pGEM-220 with SpeI and NcoI and subcloning the resultant fragment into pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) treated with NcoI and NheI. pGL-220 contains a 261-bp fragment extending from 167 bp upstream of the predicted TFIIIC220 transcription start site to 94 bp downstream. PCR mutagenesis (28Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) was used to introduce substitutions into the CRE of the TFIIIC220 promoter in pGEM-220, with 5′-CGGGGAGTGTGGTCATGCCGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCGGCATGACCACACTCCCCG-3′ overlapping oligonucleotides and SP6 and 5′-GGGCGTATCTCTTCATAGCC-3′ flanking primers. The fragment was then treated with SpeI and NcoI restriction endonucleases and cloned into NheI- and NcoI-digested pGL3-Basic vector to give pGL220mt.

PCR product containing the mutated CRE was treated with BamHI and EcoRI and then cloned back into the original plasmid digested with the same restriction enzymes. The full-length BDP1 cDNA was PCR subcloned from a modified pSBET construct generously provided by Nouria Hernandez (30Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y. Hernandez N.

Transfection Assays—HeLa cells were transfected in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) transfection reagent. Cells were incubated for 6 h in transfection mixture and then in fresh medium for an additional 40 h before harvesting. For luciferase assays, extracts were made in passive lysis buffer (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase levels were then quantified using a Luminoskan Ascent Luminometer (Labsystems) using the dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized against Renilla luciferase activity from cotransfected plasmid Ubi-Renilla (31Kassel O. Schneider S. Heilbock C. Litfin M. Gottlicher M. Herrlich P.

Transcription and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays used gel-purified oligonucleotide probes that were 5′ end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase and nuclear “mini-extracts” prepared as described (32Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Mini-extract (6 μg) was preincubated for 15 min at room temperature with 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) and unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides, as specified, in 12.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 15% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.025% Nonidet P-40. Probe (1 ng) was added and the incubation continued for a further 15 min before loading onto a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, which was run in 0.5× TBE (Tris borate-EDTA) at 4 °C. In vitro transcription assays were carried out as previously described (18White R.J. Gottlieb T.M. Downes C.S. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell.

EBV Can Stimulate Expression of Cellular pol III Transcripts and TFIIIC in HeLa Cells—Several DNA tumor viruses have been found to stimulate transcription of cellular pol III templates (reviewed by Ref. 33White R.J. Landes Bioscience, Austin. 2002; www.eurekah.comGoogle Scholar). To test whether this is also the case for EBV, we used RT-PCR to assay expression of pol III transcripts. Representatives were examined of each of the three types of promoter arrangement that are used by pol III (Fig. 1A). 5S rRNA genes have type 1 promoters comprising A- and C-blocks embedded within the transcribed region; tRNA genes have type 2 promoters composed of A- and B-blocks that are also located within the transcribed region; 7SK, MRP, and U6 snRNA genes have type 3 promoters that involve TATA boxes and proximal sequence elements that are located upstream of the transcription start site (33White R.J. Landes Bioscience, Austin. 2002; www.eurekah.comGoogle Scholar, 34Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 35Schramm L. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2593-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). EBER gene promoters can be considered a hybrid, with internal A- and B-blocks that are typical of type 2 promoters, as well as upstream motifs, including a TATA box, that contribute to transcription (29Howe J.G. Shu M.-D. Cell. 1989; 57: 825-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 36Howe J.G. Shu M.-D. Mol. Cell.

Monit. 2003; 9: 1-9Google Scholar). The cellular 7SL genes have an upstream promoter arrangement similar to the EBER genes, as well as important internal promoter sequences (36Howe J.G. Shu M.-D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2655-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 38Ullu E. Weiner A.M. Nature. 1985; 318: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 39Kleinert H. Gladen A.

Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Levels of 5S rRNA, tRNA, and 7SL RNA were found to be significantly elevated in EBV-positive HeLa cells when normalized to the control mRNA encoding acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (ARPP P0), a pol II product (Fig. 1B). This suggests that EBV, like several other DNA tumor viruses, may stimulate pol III transcription. However, none of the type 3 promoter products examined (U6, 7SK, and MRP RNA) showed evidence of induction. Thus, the stimulatory effect of EBV on cellular class III gene expression shows clear selectivity. TFIIIC is a pol III-specific transcription factor that is required by type 1 and 2 promoters, but not by type 3 (33White R.J. Landes Bioscience, Austin. 2002; www.eurekah.comGoogle Scholar, 34Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 35Schramm L. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2593-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Because EBV induces types 1 and 2, but not type 3, we examined whether it is regulating TFIIIC. Western blotting demonstrated that all five subunits of TFIIIC are expressed at elevated levels in HeLa cells infected with EBV, whereas actin appears unchanged (Fig. 1C). The mRNA encoding the TFIIIC220 subunit is overexpressed in the EBV-positive HeLa cells (Fig. 1D), but there is little consistent change in levels of the mRNAs for the other four subunits of TFIIIC (two distinct transcripts are detected from the TFIIIC102 gene, probably due to alternative splicing). We conclude that EBV can induce TFIIIC and that this may, under some circumstances, involve a level of post-transcriptional control that has not been reported previously. EBV Induces TFIIIC Expression in Several Cell Types—In addition to HeLa, we examined whether EBV can activate the pol III machinery in other cell types. Two models of EBV-induced carcinomas were tested, the Hone1 cell line, which was isolated from an NPC, and the Ad/AH line, which is derived from an adenocarcinoma of the nasopharynx (41Takimoto T. Ogura H. Ohno S. Umeda R. Hatano M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1984; 73: 711-715PubMed Google Scholar). As in HeLa cells, EBV infection of Ad/AH and Hone1 cells stimulates expression of 5S rRNA, tRNA, and 7SL RNA, but not 7SK or MRP RNA (Fig. 2A). U6 RNA levels increase slightly in Ad/AH cells, but not in Hone1. Viral induction of pol III transcription therefore shows specificity. In both these cell lines, it is accompanied by a clear increase in the mRNAs encoding all five subunits of TFIIIC (Fig. 2B). Elevated TFIIIC expression may therefore be a common feature of EBV-infected carcinoma cells. As a model of Burkitt lymphoma, we used the Japanese BL-derived Akata line alongside a matched EBV-negative subclone that was isolated from parental Akata cells by limiting dilution (42Shimizu N. Tanabe-Tochikura A. Kuroiwa Y. Takada K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6069-6073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As in the carcinoma models, expression of 5S rRNA, 7SL RNA, and tRNA is elevated specifically in EBV-positive Akata cells when compared with the EBV-negative derivative, whereas type III promoters show no evidence of activation (Fig. 2C). Similarly, the virally infected Akata cells overexpress mRNAs encoding the five TFIIIC subunits (Fig. 2D). EBV can therefore induce TFIIIC expression and endogenous pol III products in cells of disparate origin, representing virally induced lymphomas and carcinomas. TFIIIC Binds to EBER Genes in Vivo—The DNA sequences recognized by TFIIIC are the A- and B-block internal promoter elements found in most pol III-transcribed genes, including tRNA and EBER genes (33White R.J. Landes Bioscience, Austin. 2002; www.eurekah.comGoogle Scholar, 35Schramm L. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2593-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). However, as mentioned above, EBER promoters also have upstream elements that are important for transcription (29Howe J.G. Shu M.-D. Cell. 1989; 57: 825-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 43Wensing B. Stuhler A. Jenkins P. Hollyoake M. Karstegl C.E. Farrell P.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6235-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Deletion of the EBER2 B-block was found to ablate expression both in vitro and in vivo (29Howe J.G. Shu M.-D. Cell. 1989; 57: 825-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), but interpretation of this result is complicated by its location within the transcribed region, as loss of expression might reflect destabilization of the mutated transcript. Indeed, genomic footprinting revealed little evidence for TFIIIC occupancy at EBER1 or EBER2 (37Niller H.H. Salamon D. Ilg K. Koroknai A. Banati F. Bauml G. Rucker O.L. Schwarzmann F. Wolf H. Minarovits J. Med. Sci. Monit. 2003; 9: 1-9Google Scholar). We therefore considered it important to establish whether EBER genes utilize TFIIIC in vivo. To this end, we carried out ChIPs to assay occupancy in EBV-infected HeLa cells (Fig. 3A). As positive control, we confirmed that the viral EBNA1 protein is bound in the vicinity of the EBER locus, as expected due to the proximity of its oriP recognition site within the viral genome (43Wensing B. Stuhler A. Jenkins P. Hollyoake M. Karstegl C.E. Farrell P.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6235-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Clear evidence for the presence of TFIIIC was obtained using antibodies against TFIIIC220 and TFIIIC102. An antibody against the pol I factor TAFI48 provided a negative control. Additional evidence of specificity was provided by the use of EBV-negative HeLa cells, which lack EBER genes and therefore give no signal. These data provide evidence that TFIIIC does indeed interact with the EBER genes in vivo. In contrast, TFIIIC was not detected at the pol II-transcribed acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 gene (Fig. 3B). The ChIP assay was also used to assess whether EBV infection changes the amount of TFIIIC that is bound to endogenous class III genes. This revealed that TFIIIC occupancy of chromosomal tRNA genes is significantly elevated in the EBV-positive cells (Fig. 3A). As expected, neither EBNA1 nor TAFI48 were detected at these genes. We conclude that the elevated expression of TFIIIC following EBV infection can increase its occupancy of cellular target genes. ATF2 Activation May Increase Transcription of the EBER and TFIIIC220 Genes—In addition to the internal promoter that provides a binding site for TFIIIC, both the EBER genes also have a consensus ATF recognition site (CRE) located ∼50 bp upstream of the transcription start site (Fig. 4A). Deletion or point mutation of these sequences compromises expression of EBER1 and EBER2 in HeLa and BL cells (29Howe J.G. Shu M.-D. Cell. 1989; 57: 825-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 43Wensing B. Stuhler A. Jenkins P. Hollyoake M. Karstegl C.E. Farrell P.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6235-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We observed a similar effect in extracts of the Hone1 NPC line. Thus, point mutation of the CRE caused a marked reduction in EBER2 transcription relative to the wild type (Fig. 4B). This was the case for both EBV-positive and EBV-negative Hone1 cell extracts. Fig. 4B also shows that extracts from EBV-positive cells give elevated pol III transcription relative to matched extracts from EBV-negative cells. This difference is not restricted to the EBER2 gene but is also seen with other pol III templates, including the adenoviral VA1 gene, which has a TFIIIC-dependent type 2 promoter (Fig. 4C). The relative weakness of the EBER2 promoter is apparent, giving much less transcription than the powerful VA1 template (Fig. 4C). The occupancy of the EBER CRE motifs has been confirmed in vivo by genomic footprinting (37Niller H.H. Salamon D. Ilg K. Koroknai A. Banati F. Bauml G. Rucker O.L. Schwarzmann F. Wolf H. Minarovits J. Med. Sci. Monit. 2003; 9: 1-9Google Scholar). However, the footprint did not show which CRE-binding protein(s) occupies these motifs. Several members of the AP-1 and ATF families have been shown to interact with CRE sequences (44Eferl R. Wagner E.F. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). We found by ChIP that ATF2 associates with the EBER genes, but not with 5S rRNA genes (Fig. 4D). Only background amplification was observed with negative control antibody against TAFI48. Our data do not address the full constellation of factors that may bind the CRE in EBER promoters but do provide evidence for the presence of ATF2 in vivo. ATF2 can be activated by mitogen-activated protein kinases that phosphorylate residue Thr-71 within its transactivation domain (45Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.L. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar, 46van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P.

We previously reported that gene rearrangements resulting in a hybrid MDR-1 transcript represent a common mechanism for acquired activation of MDR-1/P-glycoprotein. We have identified hybrid MDR-1 transcripts in nine MDR-1-overexpressing cell lines and two patients with relapsed ALL. We characterize these rearrangements as follows. 1) Non-MDR-1 sequences in the hybrid MDR-1 transcripts are expressed in unselected cell lines, showing that these sequences are constitutively expressed. 2) The rearrangements occur randomly and involve partner genes (sequences) on chromosome 7 and on chromosomes other than 7. Breakpoints have been characterized in six cell lines. In one, the rearrangement occurred within intron 2 of MDR-1; in the other five, the rearrangement occurred 24 to >96 kb 5′ of the normal start of transcription of MDR-1. In one cell line, homologous recombination involving an Alu repeat was observed. However, in the remaining five cell lines, nonhomologous recombination was observed. 3) The rearrangements arise during drug selection. The acquired rearrangements are not detected in parental cells. 4) Five of the six active promoters that captured MDR-1 controlled MDR-1 from a distance of 29 to more than 110 kb 5′ to MDR-1. Transcription was initiated in an antegrade or retrograde direction. We conclude that drug selection with natural products targeting DNA or microtubules leads to DNA damage, nonhomologous recombination, and acquired drug resistance, wherein MDR-1 expression is driven by a random but constitutively active promoter.

Overcoming clinical drug resistance, both intrinsic and acquired, remains a challenge for the oncologist in the treatment of human malignancy, even in the current era of novel therapies (1Mahadevan D.

The hallmark of clinical drug resistance is cross-resistance to multiple structurally unrelated compounds used in the treatment of cancer, such as the vinca alkaloids, the anthracyclines, the epipodophyllotoxins, the taxanes, and actinomycin D. The ABC transporters are the most extensively studied mechanisms of drug resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Of the 48 members of this super family of proteins, four (MDR-1/ABCB1, MRP1/ABCC1, MRP2/ABCC2, and BCRP/MXR/ABCG2) have been shown to confer drug resistance in human malignancy (3Borst P.

Invest. 1997; 99: 1947-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) have all been shown to affect MDR-1 gene expression.Previously, we reported that when screening for point mutations in the MDR-1 gene, a mismatch was detected by RNase protection analysis in a series of adriamycin-selected human colon carcinoma cell lines, designated S48-3s/ADR. Further studies demonstrated a deletion of the first 68 residues of the coding sequence and 23 residues from the 5′-UTR in the first step of the selection. Using 5′-RACE, the MDR-1 mRNA of S48-3s/ADR cells was shown to be a hybrid message of non-MDR-1 and MDR-1 sequences. Somatic cell hybrids localized these 5′ partner gene sequences to chromosome 4, and fluorescence in situ hybridization provided clear evidence of a translocation between chromosomes 4 and 7 (12Mickley L.A. Spengler B.A. Knutsen T.A. Biedler J.L. Fojo T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1947-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Additional observations established that this translocation was an acquired phenotype that occurred in the first step of the selection and led to the overexpression of MDR-1. Activation occurred because endogenous expression of the chromosome 4 gene was higher than MDR-1, and co-amplification of the chromosome 4 sequences and MDR-1 was shown in cell lines selected for higher levels of resistance. With the sequencing of the human genome, these chromosome 4 sequences were identified as arising from the 5′-UTR of the SET 7 gene, a histone 3 lysine 4 methyl transferase, located on 4q28 (13Wang H. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Borchers C. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1207-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). This translocation provided a model for activation of MDR-1.We thus sought additional examples in other drug-selected cell lines. We recognized such rearrangements would preferentially occur in the 5′-UTR, since this would avoid significant disruption of protein structure. Previous studies had concluded the MDR-1 gene had both a “downstream” promoter responsible for transcription from the normal start site and an “upstream” promoter (14Ueda K. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17432-17436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We proposed that transcripts arising from an “upstream” promoter might in some cases be hybrid mRNAs composed of 5′ partner gene sequences fused to MDR-1 at residue –194. We have identified gene rearrangements in nine drug-resistant cell lines and two patient samples, one with acute lymphocytic leukemia who failed induction chemotherapy and one with drug-refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia (Table 1) (12Mickley L.A.

The result presented herein establish the changes as an acquired phenotype that occurs primarily following nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and that are very diverse, reflecting the pliability available to cancer cells needing to become drug-resistant.TABLE 1Cell lines and refractory leukemia samples with hybrid MDR-1 transcriptsCell line/PatientTissue of originDrug selectionNon-MDR-1 gene/chromosomeLength of non-MDR-1 sequence clonedBreakpoint location (nucleotide)bpS48-3s ADR10ColonAdriamycin (10 μg/ml)SET 7/4q282504,941 of AC112236 (SET 7); 35,422 of AC002457 (MDR)S48-3s ACT 0.2ColonActinomycin D (200 ng/ml)HSCARG/16p13.3 HMOX-2/16p13.367MCF-7 TX400BreastPaclitaxel (400 ng/ml)CASP/7q2297148,476 of AC005096 (CASP); 120,304 of AC002457 (MDR)MCF-7 ADInt500BreastAdriamycin (500 ng/ml)MLL5/7q2235223,394 of AC005065 (MLL5); 85,826 of AC002457 (MDR)ZR-75B TX320BreastPaclitaxel (320 ng/ml)Chromosome 7259ZR-75B AD600BreastAdriamycin (600 ng/ml)Chromosome 7259MDA-MB-231 VB100BreastVinblastine (100 ng/ml)MCFP/7q21.13198130,288 of AC003083 (MCFP); 60,784 of AC002457 (MDR)EW36 VCR120LymphomaVincristine (120 ng/ml)MCFP/7q21.13252122,806 of AC003083 (MCFP); 58,972 of AC002457 (MDR)8226 DOX40MyelomaDoxorubicin (400 nm)Chromosome 132214,840 of AL354815 (Chr 13); 127,038 of AC002457 (MDR)ALL no. 1Relapsed ALLInduction failureaPatient never achieved remission during induction therapy.

The drug-resistant sublines were grown in the following concentration of MDR-1 substrate: S48-3s ADR10 (10 μg/ml adriamycin), S48-3s ACT 0.2 (200 ng/ml actinomycin-D), MCF-7 TX400 (400 ng/ml paclitaxel), MCF-7 ADInt500 (500 ng/ml adriamycin), ZR-75B TX320 (320 ng/ml paclitaxel), ZR-75B AD600 (600 ng/ml adriamycin), MDA-MB-231 VB100 (100 ng/ml vinblastine), EW36 VCR120 (120 ng/ml vincristine), and 8226 DOX40 (400 nm doxorubicin). The colon cancer cell line, S48-3s, and its drug resistant sublines, S48-3s ADR 10 and S48-3s ACT 0.2 (12Mickley L.A. Spengler B.A. Knutsen T.A. Biedler J.L. Fojo T. J. Clin.

All other cell lines were grown in Iscove's modified Eagle's medium supplemented as described above.RNA Probe Synthesis and RNase Protection Analysis—Hybrid RNA probes used in the RNase protection assays were derived by reverse transcription-PCR as previously described (12Mickley L.A. Spengler B.A. Knutsen T.A. Biedler J.L. Fojo T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1947-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). RNA from each drug-resistant cell line was used as the template in the reverse transcription reaction to generate a hybrid RNA probe unique to each drug-resistant cell line. A 3′ primer specific for MDR-1 exon 1 (–127ATTCCTCAGAAACTGCGAA–146) was used to generate a cDNA from each drug-resistant cell line using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as previously described (12Mickley L.A. Spengler B.A. Knutsen T.A. Biedler J.L. Fojo T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1947-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A PCR product representing the hybrid RNA transcript was then generated using a 5′ primer specific for each 5′ partner sequence in the hybrid MDR-1 transcript and the MDR-1-specific 3′ primer used in the reverse transcription reaction. The resulting PCR product was thus unique to each drug-resistant cell line and was cloned into the pCRII cloning vector (Invitrogen) by TA cloning (18Mead D. Pey N.K. Harrnstadt C. Marcil R.A. Smith L.M. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Radioactive hybrid RNA probes were then synthesized from these plasmids containing hybrid sequences by transcribing 1 μg of plasmid DNA with either T7 or SP6 polymerase and [32P]rUTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (15Mickley L.A. Lee J.S. Weng Z. Zhan Z. Alvarez M. Wilson W. Bates S.E. Fojo T. Blood. 1998; 91: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rothenberg M.L. Mickley L.A. Cole D.E. Balis F.M. Tsuruo T. Poplack D.G. Fojo A.T. Blood. 1989; 74: 1388-1395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Solution hybridization was then performed using 20 μg of mRNA from parental and drug-resistant cells and 1.5 × 105 cpm of the radiolabeled hybrid RNA probe unique to that drug-resistant cell line. Hybridization conditions and gel electrophoresis were carried out as previously described (20Melton D. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4048) Google Scholar).DNA Probe Synthesis and Southern Analysis—DNA probes used in Southern blot analysis were generated by PCR using genomic KB 3-1 DNA as a template and the primer sequences listed in supplemental Table 1. The Expand Long PCR kit (Roche Applied Science) was used to generate long PCR probes (P1, P2, and P4). All other DNA probes (1A–1D and 2A–2E) were generated by standard PCR technology using TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) All probes were synthesized by TA cloning into the pCRII cloning vector (Invitrogen) as described above. The plasmid was then cut with restriction enzymes and electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel to isolate the insert DNA. The insert was excised from the gel and purified by Spin-X columns (Costar Inc., Corning, NY). Radioactive DNA probes were then synthesized using the Rediprime RmT labeling kit and [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ).Genomic DNA was isolated from parental and drug-resistant cell lines using the Wizard Genomic DNA purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and digested with HindIII. Then 10 μgof digested DNA was loaded per lane on a 1% agarose gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was then transferred to nitrocellulose and hybridized with the radiolabeled DNA probe at a final concentration of 1.0 × 106 cpm/ml Hybridsol (Intergen, Purchase, NY) (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 931-940Google Scholar).Probes P-2, 2A, and P-4 have internal HindIII sites. Fragments protected by probe P-2 yielded 11.5, 6.5, and 1.9 kb bands. Probe 2A yielded 1.4 and 1.1 kb bands, and probe P-4 yielded 4.9 and 4.7 kb bands, which appear as one band on autoradiography.Luciferase Constructs, Cloning, and Transfections—Initial searches in GenBank™ mapped identical partner sequences in the EW 36 VCR120 and MDA-MB-231 VB100 cell lines 275 kb 5′ to the MDR-1 start site near several expressed sequence tags subsequently identified as the 5′-UTR of the MCFP gene. Before they were identified as the MCFP gene, we thought that these partner sequences might be the 5′-UTR of some unknown gene and took advantage of the promoter data base, Proscan, to search a 1-kb region surrounding these sequences to look for promoter activity (22Prestridge D.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Results from the search allowed us to design the following primers to construct luciferase plasmids. Restriction enzyme sites (HindIII and XhoI sites are highlighted in boldface type) were introduced into the primers to control the direction of each fragment: 1F 5′ (134951gatcctcgagccccgccccgtc134930), 1F 3′ (134684actaaagcttggtcaacacagagccg134708), 2F 5′ (134839tcgcctcgagctctggccctgc134818), 2F 3′ (136567ggaaaagcttcatacctggggcag134590), 3F 5′ (134422gtttctcgagcgtcactgccgac134390), 3F 3′ (134142tgttaagcttcactccttcattgttg134167), 1R 5′ (134684actactcgaggtcaacacagagccg134708), 1R 3′ (134951gatcaagcttccccgccccgtc134930), 2R 5′ (136567ggaactcgagcatacctgggggcag134590), 2R 3′ (134839tcgcaagcttctctggccctgc134818), 3R 5′ (134142tgttctcgagcactccttcattgttg134167), 3R 3′ (134422gtttaagcttcgtcactgccgac134389). Numbers designate the sequence location in the GenBank™ accession number AC003083. PCR was performed with each primer pair on genomic DNA. The resulting PCR product was digested with the appropriate enzymes and cloned into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI).Transient transfections were performed using TransFast TM (Promega, Madison, WI) as previously described (23Huff L.M. Wang Z. Iglesias A. Fojo T. Lee J.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 11694-11703Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 24Blagosklonny M.V. Giannakakou P. Romanova L.Y. Ryan K.M. Vousden K.H. Fojo T. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For each construct and cell line, transfections were performed in triplicate and repeated twice to confirm the reproducibility. Relative luciferase units/mg of protein of each construct were reported for all cell lines examined. Control transfections were performed simultaneously with either vector alone (pGLB) or with the thymidine kinase promoter vector (pGLBTK) containing the thymidine kinase promoter 5′ to the luciferase gene or the cytomegalovirus promoter vector (pGLBCMV) juxtaposed 5′ to the luciferase gene.RESULTSWe had previously reported that in four drug-resistant cell lines and two patient samples, a hybrid MDR-1 mRNA could be detected using 5′-RACE. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the hybrid message identified in a given drug-resistant cell was detected exclusively in that cell line or patient sample. These findings were consistent with the existence of rearrangements that were unique to each resistant cell line or patient sample (12Mickley L.A. Spengler B.A. Knutsen T.A. Biedler J.L. Fojo T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1947-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Mickley L.A. Lee J.S. Weng Z. Zhan Z. Alvarez M. Wilson W. Bates S.E. Fojo T. Blood. 1998; 91: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our present study extends our original reports with five additional drug-resistant cell lines in which hybrid MDR-1 transcripts were identified. All cell lines and patient samples in which these hybrid MDR-1 mRNAs were identified are summarized in Table 1. Also summarized in Table 1 is the concentration of Pgp substrate in which the cells were grown and the name or chromosome location of the 5′ partner gene identified in each hybrid MDR-1 mRNA. The partner sequences cloned from the 5′-RACE products of 11 hybrid transcripts vary in length from 67 to 352 base pairs. To establish that the hybrid MDR-1 mRNAs were the predominant or exclusive MDR-1 transcripts, the RNase protection experiments shown in Fig. 1 were performed (20Melton D. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4048) Google Scholar). Results are shown for four cell lines. In each instance, the sequence comprising the junction of the hybrid message has been subcloned and utilized as the template for the RNA probe. We had previously shown that the 5′ partner sequences in the hybrid mRNAs were expressed in the unselected parental cells and, in a majority of cases, could be detected in many different cells, consistent with a housekeeping function (12Mickley L.A. Spengler B.A. Knutsen T.A. Biedler J.L. Fojo T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1947-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These observations were confirmed by RNase protection. As shown in the figure, in a majority of cases, RNA isolated from the parental cells was able to protect the non-MDR-1 portion of the probe (252, 198, 221, or 223 bp; for the probe hybridized with mRNA from the MDA-MB231 cells and its resistant subline, the 198-bp fragment detected on the original autoradiogram is not reproduced in the figure). In no case was the full-length probe representing the hybrid MDR-1 mRNA protected by parental cell RNA, consistent with the results of the more sensitive PCR assay (discussed below) that suggested these hybrid transcripts were acquired during the process of drug selection. In contrast, RNA isolated from the resistant cells protects the full-length probe (319, 265, 288, or 290 bp), indicating that hybrid MDR-1 mRNAs (67 bp of MDR-1 exon 1) are present therein. In addition, protection of the non-MDR-1 portion of the probe is also seen, and in every case the level appears higher than in the parental cells. Possible explanations for this observation are discussed below.As a next step, we set out to determine in a subset of the drug-resistant cell lines the site and nature of the rearrangement. This portion of the work was confined to the cell lines, because sufficient quantities of RNA and DNA were not available from the patient samples. Instead of constructing a genomic library for each resistant cell line and probing with MDR-1 probes and then with probes containing the 5′ partner sequences, we adopted an alternate strategy (see Fig. 2). We knew the cell lines had amplified MDR-1 to varying degrees, and by extension the area of the rearrangement. We had also previously shown that with the exception of the S48-3s ADR cell line, in every other case, the partner sequence in the hybrid message was “fused” to MDR-1 at a residue that is 194 base pairs 5′ of the normal start site of MDR-1. The result of this is that in all cases, except for the S48-3s ADR cell line, the sequence is a hybrid MDR-1 transcript but not a hybrid protein. In all cases, this results in a P-glycoprotein this is expressed at high levels and is fully functional (see supplemental Fig. 1).FIGURE 2Southern blot analysis localized the site of the breakpoint relative to MDR-1. The schematic shows that the locations of the DNA probes (P1, P2, P4, 1A-1D, and 2A-2E) used in the analysis were chosen to avoid repetitive sequences 5′ to the normal start of MDR-1 transcription. A 140-kb region 5′ to MDR-1 exon 1 contained 46 Alu repeats and is indicated by vertical tick marks. Probes were hybridized against HindIII-digested genomic DNA from both parental and drug-resistant cells. In the 8226 DOX40 cell line, the initial screen showed that fragment P2 was amplified, whereas fragment P4 was single copy. Fragment 2E was also shown to be amplified, narrowing the site of the breakpoint to the region between 2E and P4. In addition, a 7.0 kb band was detected in the DOX40 DNA hybridized with P4, indicating that the rearrangement introduced a new HindIII site. In MCF-7 AdInt500, fragment 1D was amplified, whereas P2 was single copy, localizing the breakpoint in this cell line between these two fragments. An additional 3.2 kb band was detected in the AdInt500 DNA hybridized with P2 also indicating a new HindIII fragment due to the rearrangement.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Therefore, as a first step, we concentrated on narrowing down the site of rearrangement on the “MDR-1 side” of the breakpoint. In order to do this, we began by subcloning three segments of DNA (designated P1, P2, and P4 in Fig. 2) located in the proximal 15–95 kb 5′ of the normal MDR-1 start site. These three fragments, as well as all other fragments subsequently used to examine for amplification, were chosen to be free of repetitive sequences, which, as discussed below, are very prevalent in the 5′ region of MDR-1. By using these fragments as probes in a Southern blot analysis of HindIII-digested DNA, we were able to narrow the site of the breakpoint relative to these probes. We then performed additional Southern analyses using probes (1A–1D and 2A–2E) located between the initial three probes (P-1, P-2, and P-4) to identify fragments that were amplified and fragments that were present at “single copy level.” These fragments used as probes in the second screen were in closer proximity to each other. In some cases, HindIII fragments of unexpected length were detected, indicating that a rearrangement had occurred in close proximity to or within the genome sequences encompassed by the fragment used as the probe. Two examples of this strategy and the results obtained are shown in Fig. 2. In the 8226 DOX40 cell line, the initial screen showed that fragment P2 was amplified, whereas fragment P4 was single copy. On subsequent blots, amplification of fragment 2E was also shown, and with the knowledge that P4 was single copy and the appearance of an additional 6.2 kb band, we narrowed the site of the breakpoint to the region between 2E and P4. Similarly, for MCF-7 AdInt500, fragment 1D was amplified, whereas P2 had been found in the initial screen to be single copy, localizing the breakpoint in this cell line between these two fragments. In addition, a new 3.7 kb band was present in the drug-resistant lane of the P-2 blot, suggesting as in the previous example that the rearrangement occurred within or near the genomic sequences homologous to P-2 probe sequences.We obtained the sequence for the breakpoints by isolating a PCR product spanning the breakpoint. An example of this strategy for the MCF-7 AdInt500 cell line is shown in supplemental Fig. 2. Fig. 3 summarizes the site of the breakpoints between the “capturing genes” and MDR-1 in six of the cell lines, including two that have been previously published (25Harada T. Nagayama J. Kohno K. Mickley L.A. Fojo T. Kuwano M. Wada M. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 506-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). With the exception of one cell line, S48-ADR10, all breakpoints occurred 5′ of the start of transcription of the MDR-1 gene. In the S48-ADR10 cell line, the breakpoint occurred between exons 2 and 3 of the MDR-1 gene (12Mickley L.A. Spengler B.A. Knutsen T.A. Biedler J.L. Fojo T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1947-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the S48-ADR10 cell line, the distance from the breakpoint in intron 2 to exon 3 was 3.9 kb. In the six cell lines with breakpoints 5′ of the start of transcription, the distance to the breakpoint ranged from 22 to 91 kb. On the non-MDR-1 side of the breakpoint, the distances between the sequences in the hybrid mRNA and the breakpoint in the genomic sequence were smaller, ranging from 1.9 to 26 kb.FIGURE 3Schematic depicting the sites of the breakpoints in six drug-resistant cell lines, including two that have been previously published (25Harada T.

The structures of these active forms have been solved. Recent structures of thrombin obtained in the absence of Na+ have also documented inactive conformations that presumably exist in equilibrium with the active slow form. The validity of these inactive slow form structures, however, is called into question by the presence of packing interactions involving the Na+ site and the active site regions. Here, we report a 1.87Å resolution structure of thrombin in the absence of inhibitors and salts with a single molecule in the asymmetric unit and devoid of significant packing interactions in regions involved in the allosteric slow → fast transition. The structure shows an unprecedented self-inhibited conformation where Trp-215 and Arg-221a relocate >10Å to occlude the active site and the primary specificity pocket, and the guanidinium group of Arg-187 penetrates the protein core to fill the empty Na+-binding site. The extreme mobility of Trp-215 was investigated further with the W215P mutation. Remarkably, the mutation significantly compromises cleavage of the anticoagulant protein C but has no effect on the hydrolysis of fibrinogen and PAR1.

Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Na+ increases both kcat and kcat/Km and acts as a “modifier” (7Botts J. Morales M. Trans.

Crystal structures of the active slow and fast forms have been solved recently (9Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol.

Significant changes have been detected between the two forms that explain how Na+ binding causes faster diffusion of substrate into the active site and faster acylation. A highly organized network of water molecules connects the coordination shell of Na+ to the hydroxyl group of the catalytic Ser-195 located 16 Å away, using the side chains of Asp-189 and Glu-192 as relays (9Pineda A.O.

The correct orientation of Asp-189 in the primary specificity pocket and Ser-195 in the active site are controlled long range by Na+ binding and result into an optimal environment for substrate diffusion and catalysis. Earlier stopped-flow kinetic measurements of Na+ binding to thrombin (10Lai M.T. Di Cera E. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30275-30282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have suggested that the mechanism of conversion of the slow to the fast form must involve a third component. The kinetics of Na+ association with thrombin was found to be biphasic, with a “fast” phase caused by the interaction of Na+ with the slow form S to generate the fast form F and a “slow” phase caused by the interconversion between the inactive S* and active S slow forms. The inactive S* form was found incapable of binding Na+ and substrate at the active site (10Lai M.T. Di Cera E. Shafer J.A. J. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar). Current structural evidence of the existence of an inactive slow form is interesting and potentially relevant to thrombin allostery. However, close inspection of the structures portraying thrombin into inactive conformations in the absence of Na+ reveals that they all contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit engaged in substantial packing interactions at the active site and the Na+ site regions that call into question the structural assignments attributed to the lack of Na+. The precise nature of the inactive slow form of thrombin remains to be established with new structures where packing interactions do not bias the conformation of the enzyme around the Na+ site and the active site. Here, we report a high resolution (1.87 Å) crystal structure of thrombin, in the absence of inhibitors and salts, with the enzyme in an unprecedented self-inhibited conformation that is not the result of crystal packing interactions. We engineered a new mutant carrying the isosteric substitution Asp → Asn of the catalytic Asp-102 to inactivate thrombin with the most conservative replacement of the catalytic triad His-57/Asp-102/Ser-195, and to produce a useful reagent for crystallization in the absence of inhibitors or in complex with physiologic substrates. Our choice was motivated by the available x-ray crystal structure of the rat trypsin mutant D102N in the presence of benzamidine (19Sprang S. Standing T. Fletterick R.J. Stroud R.M. Finer-Moore J. Xuong N.H. Hamlin R. Rutter W.J. Craik C.S.

The thrombin mutant D102N was expressed, purified, and tested for activity as described previously (9Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol.

The kcat/Km for the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide is reduced 16,000-fold relative to wild type at pH 8.0, mostly because of a 450-fold decrease in kcat (data not shown). Stopped-flow measurements of Na+ binding to thrombin wild type and D102N were carried out with an Applied Photophysics SX20 spectrometer, using an excitation of 280 nm and emission of 320 nm. Samples of thrombin at a final concentration of 50 nm were mixed 1:1 with 60-μl solutions of the same buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.1% polyethylene glycol, pH 8.0, at 15 °C) containing variable amounts of NaCl (up to 400 mm) kept at a constant ionic strength of 400 mm with ChCl. The base line was measured with 400 mm ChCl in the mixing syringe. The fluorescence increase observed upon Na+ binding has an initial rapid phase that cannot be resolved within the dead time (0.5 ms) of the spectrometer followed by a single exponential slow phase with a kobs that decreases as [Na+] increases (see Fig. 4). The biphasic mechanism of Na+ binding obeys the following kinetic scheme (10Lai M.T. Di Cera E. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30275-30282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 16Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. Biophys.

In both cases the mechanism of binding is biphasic, with a fast phase followed by a single-exponential slow phase of fluorescence increase with kobs = 109 ± 2s-1 (black circles) or 92 ± 2s-1 (gray circles). The flat time course refers to the control [Na+] = 0. B, effect of [Na+]on the kobs for the slow phase of fluorescence increase observed by stopped-flow measurements of Na+ binding to thrombin wild type (black circles) and D102N (gray circles). The value of kobs decreases with increasing [Na+], proving that the slow phase precedes Na+ binding and pertains to the conformational transition between S and S* (see kinetic scheme under “Materials and Methods”). The continuous lines were drawn according to Equation 1 in the text, with best fit parameter values: k1 = 103 ± 2s-1, k-1 = 31 ± 3s-1, KA = 65 ± 9 m-1 (black circles); k1 = 57 ± 5s-1, k-1 = 64 ± 5s-1, KA = 21 ± 6 m-1 (gray circles). The fraction of slow forms in the inactive form, k-1/(k1 + k-1), is 23% for wild type and 53% for the D102N mutant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The rapid phase is due to Na+ binding to S to generate F, with an equilibrium association constant KA.

For crystallization studies, the D102N mutant was concentrated to 5 mg/ml in 50 mm ChCl and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Crystallization was achieved using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 2 μl of protein solution and 2 μl of reservoir solution containing 18% polyethylene glycol 20000, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, and left to equilibrate at 23 °C. Diffraction quality crystals (0.40 × 0.15 × 0.10 mm) were grown after 2 weeks. The crystals were tetragonal, with space group P43 and unit cell parameters a = b = 57.9 Å and c = 119.9 Å, and contained one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The crystal was cryoprotected in 18% polyethylene glycol 20000, 0.1 m HEPES, and 15% glycerol prior to flash-freezing.

An initial round of rigid body refinement was carried out at 2.5 Å resolution, followed by positional, slow cooling annealing, and B factor refinement. A few cycles of minimization, including bulk solvent correction, B factor refinement, and model rebuilding gave Rcryst = 0.238 and Rfree = 0.252 at 2.5 Å resolution. The resolution for refinement was gradually extended to 1.87 Å, and water molecules were added interactively at the end of each refinement cycle using Fo - Fc peaks over 3 σ. The final Rcryst and Rfree were 0.195 and 0.218, respectively, with root mean square deviation from ideal values of 0.006 Å for bond lengths and 1.6° for bond angles. The final model includes 279 residues, 1 HEPES, and 150 water molecules. The autolysis loop could not be resolved because of weak electron density and was omitted.

Open table in a new tab The recently solved structure of free wild type thrombin in an inactive conformation attributed to the lack of Na+ (17Johnson D.J. Adams T.E. Li W. Huntington J.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) has two molecules in the asymmetric unit defining an intermolecular surface of interaction of ∼900 Å2 (Table 2). The surface involves residues of the 60, 99, 170, 186, and 220 loops (Fig. 1) and is the size of the interface of the complex between thrombin and the N-terminal domain of hirudin (26Ayala Y.M. Vindigni A. Nayal M. Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Di Cera E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Practically, this is a structure of thrombin “inhibited” by another thrombin molecule in the asymmetric unit, with the entire Na+ site and active site regions under the influence of significant crystal packing. Much importance was attributed to a 3.0 Å shift in the position of Glu-192, that occludes access to the active site (17Johnson D.J. Adams T.E. Li W. Huntington J.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, Glu-192 is at the interface of the two thrombin molecules in the asymmetric unit, with the Cγ only 3.5 Å away from the Nϵ of Arg-221a of the second molecule. The contact pushes the side chain of Glu-192 into the active site, where it is further stabilized by two water-mediated H-bonds with a glycerol molecule at the interface. The artifactual conformation of Glu-192 may have facilitated a flip of the N atom of Gly-193, defining the oxyanion hole together with the N atom of the catalytic Ser-195. However, the flip cannot be considered a signature of the inactive slow form because it is also observed in the structure of thrombin bound to K+ (16Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 2006; 121: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Other significant packing interactions across the interface involve Asp-221 with Arg-221a, Asp-222 with Lys-60f, and Lys-224 with Asp-60e, all residues assumed to be involved in the allosteric transition from the inactive slow form to the active fast form (17Johnson D.J. Adams T.E. Li W. Huntington J.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, Oϵ1 of Glu-217 makes a H-bond with Nϵ1 of Trp-60d, and the catalytic His-57 forms a 3.2Å H-bond with a glycerol molecule at the interface. Hence, the inactive conformation reported in this structure is largely the result of crystal packing. Similar considerations apply to the structure of the thrombin mutant E217K (13Carter W.J. Myles T. Gibbs C.S. Leung L.L. Huntington J.A. J. Biol.

In this case, packing interactions are even more substantial and cover a surface area >1,000 Å (Table 2) in the Na+ site and active site regions (Fig. 1). The 3.4 Å contact between Oϵ 1 of Glu-192 and NH1 of Arg-221a of the second molecule in the asymmetric unit positions Glu-192 toward the active site. Importantly, Nζ of the mutated residue Lys-217 forms a 2.9 Å salt bridge with Oδ2 of Asp-222 in the second molecule of the asymmetric unit, contrary to the claim that this Lys side chain did not make a significant stabilizing contact in the structure (13Carter W.J.

The inactive conformation reported in this structure is largely the result of the drastic charge reversal introduced near the Na+ site and significant crystal packing. The recent structure of the thrombin mutant R77aA in the presence of KCl contains two molecules in the asymmetric unit, one with K+ bound to the Na+ site (molecule 1) and the other (molecule 2) in an inactive conformation with the Na+ site free (15Papaconstantinou M.E.

The 220-loop region of molecule 2 is at the interface, and its partial disorder exposes the RGD sequence. Likewise, the autolysis loop of molecule 2 is repositioned toward exosite I by its contacts with molecule 1 at the interface. Cys-220 is in contact with Arg-221a of molecule 1, which could explain perturbation of the 190 strand through the Cys-191:Cys-220 disulfide bond and closure of the access to the primary specificity pocket. Perturbation of Cys-220 could have also caused the collapse of residues 216-219 into the primary specificity pocket, as seen in the structure of the inactive W215A/E217A mutant (14Pineda A.O.

Res. 2003; 36: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The second active site of Qns1 is an NAD+ synthetase domain that reacts nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD+) with ATP to form an activated, adenylylated intermediate (NaAD-AMP), releasing pyrophosphate. In turn, NaAD-AMP is attacked by ammonia to produce NAD+ plus AMP. Ideally, the enzyme would produce one equivalent of NAD+ and AMP for every glutamine hydrolyzed to glutamate. This ideal stoichiometry, depicted in Fig. 1, has been attributed to glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetase since the first description of the enzyme by Preiss and Handler (5Preiss J. Handler P. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 493-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The simplicity of Fig. 1 notwithstanding, characterization of the native (6Yu C.K. Dietrich L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4794-4802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and recombinant (1Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33049-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) purified enzyme has never been entirely consistent with ideality. Whether the enzyme is, in fact, capable of perfect stoichiometry, potentially at a “sweet spot” of substrate concentrations, has not been investigated.Though eukaryotic and some prokaryotic NAD+ synthetases have long been understood to be glutamine-dependent enzymes (5Preiss J. Handler P. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 493-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Cantoni R. Branzoni M. Labo M. Rizzi M. Riccardi G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3218-3221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the GAT domain of these enzymes initially escaped recognition as a glutaminase because it is neither a triad-type GAT, an N-terminal nucleophile-type GAT (2Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar), nor one related to aminoacyl-tRNA transamidases (8Curnow A.W. Kw H. Yuan R. Si K. Martins O. Winkler W. Henkin T.M. Soll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In the course of characterizing the domain structure of members of the nitrilase superfamily, we observed that the glutamine dependence of all eukaryotic and particular prokaryotic NAD+ synthetases could be accounted for by the presence of a putative GAT domain related to nitrilase (9Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 0001.0001-0001.0009Crossref Google Scholar, 10Brenner C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of yeast Qns1 coupled to biochemical and physiological experiments established that the nitrilase-related domain functions as a GAT and consists of a Glu-Lys-Cys catalytic triad (1Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33049-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Experiments indicated that the synthetase and the glutaminase active sites must reside in the same polypeptide for Qns1 to function in vivo even though glutaminase mutants retained ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase activity, synthetase mutants retained basal glutaminase activity, and the two mutants assembled into a stable multimer in vivo (1Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33049-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We interpreted these experiments to indicate that there is a specific intramolecular ammonia channel from the GAT active site to the synthetase active site. Modeling and structure-based sequence analysis suggested that the ammonia channel in Qns1 is ∼46 Å long and lined with residues conserved among glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetases (1Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33049-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).In the earlier study, we determined that saturating NaAD+ increases glutaminase activity by at least 30-fold (1Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33049-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the present study we have shown that NaAD+ accelerates the kcat/Km of the Qns1 glutaminase active site by ∼50-fold with a reversible substrate dissociation constant (Ks) that is 24-fold lower than the Km of Qns1 for NaAD+ to NAD+ product formation. Whereas this mode of regulation reduces the glutamine to NAD+ efficiency at low NaAD+ levels, it effectively reduces the waste of glutamine on an absolute basis in the absence of NaAD+. Moreover, at high NaAD+ levels, Qns1 achieves maximal glutamine to NAD+ efficiency and becomes strictly limited by glutamine levels to produce NAD+. The communication between NaAD+ binding and glutaminase stimulation is reminiscent of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, which has a molecular tunnel for transport of ammonia and carbamate. In the case of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, glutaminase activity is accelerated 1000-fold by bicarbonate phosphorylation at a site 45 Å away (3Bera A.K. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7975-7979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 4Raushel F.M. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Acc. Chem.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16773-16779Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Precedent for stimulation of one active site by binding a substrate at another active site is found in several classic studies. In analysis of luciferase, McElroy et al. (12McElroy W.D. DeLuca M. Travis J. Science. 1967; 157: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) termed the phenomenon homosterism, in contradistinction to allosterism, to indicate that a substrate binding event could position a multisubstrate enzyme to react more efficiently with subsequently bound substrates at the normal engagement sites of all substrates. Analyzing succinyl coenzyme A synthetase, Boyer and coworkers (13Bridger W.A. Millen W.A. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3608-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) made similar observations, which were termed substrate synergism. According, we refer to the ability of NaAD+ binding to accelerate the glutaminase active site as homosteric stimulation and as an example of substrate synergism.To further dissect the efficiency of Qns1 and the communication between the two active sites, we targeted ten amino acids in the predicted ammonia channel of Qns1 for site-directed mutagenesis and characterized purified mutant enzymes physiologically and biochemically, identifying six different classes of mutant enzymes. This set of mutants produced richly distinct phenotypes: glutaminase mutants with poor synthetase activity but retaining good substrate synergism; glutaminase mutants totally dependent on substrate synergism; glutaminase mutants with poor synthetase activity that inhibit substrate synergism; synthetase mutants that depress all activities; synthetase mutants with poor synthetase activity but retaining good substrate synergism; and synthetase mutants with no synthetase activity and no substrate synergism. The combined kinetic and molecular genetic analyses of Qns1 establish a homosteric function for NaAD+ binding in the coordination of glutamine consumption with NaAD+ availability.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis—Plasmid pB337 and derivatives were used for expression of yeast QNS1 in Escherichia coli (1Bieganowski P.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4544) Google Scholar) of plasmid pB337 was used to create plasmids to express QNS1 alleles I111A, R112S, R112L, E177A, D593A, Y601A, L604A, L604N, M621A, and F622A using primers listed in supplemental Table S1. Double mutants (L529A,L604A; Y601A,M621A; Y532A,Y601A; D593A,F622A) were constructed by subjecting particular single mutants to a second round of site-directed mutagenesis. Plasmid pB177, carrying QNS1 with the native promoter on a single copy HIS3 plasmid (1Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33049-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), was the reference for complementation testing of QNS1 alleles. Mutations were introduced into plasmid pB177 as indicated in supplemental Table S1. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.In Vivo Assays—Mutant derivatives of plasmid pB177, carrying QNS1 with the native promoter on a single copy HIS3 plasmid, were transformed into yeast strain BY165-1d (genotype MATa qns1Δ::kanMX4 ura3 trp1 his3 leu2 met15) carrying pB175, which encodes wild-type QNS1 on a URA3 plasmid. Transforming in a functional allele of QNS1 linked to HIS3 allowed curing of pB175, scored by 5-fluoroorotic acid resistance. Conversely, nonfunctional alleles were scored by 5-flouroorotic acid sensitivity (1Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol.

Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33049-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Protein was measured by the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard.Enzymatic Assays—Assays were based on those described earlier (1Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33049-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Specific activities of Qns1 were determined in reaction buffer (2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 56 mm KCl, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) with 1 mm NaAD+,20mm glutamine, and 0.1 μg of enzyme, incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by heating in a boiling water bath for 3 min, chilled on ice, and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm. Supernatants were used for NAD+ or glutamate product determination. The assay for the NAD+ product contained supernatant, 0.1% ethanol, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 6.4 units of alcohol dehydrogenase (Sigma) incubated for 60 min at 25 °C. NAD+ standards (0-150 μm) were measured under the same reaction conditions. The glutamate product was determined by incubating reaction supernatant with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm NAD+, and 2.4 units of glutamate dehydrogenase (Sigma). Reactions were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C and clarified by a 5-min centrifugation at 12,000 rpm. Glutamate standards (0-70 μm) underwent both incubations in parallel with assayed samples and contained all of the ingredients other than Qns1. NADH, the final product of both assays, was detected at 340 nm and converted to molar using the extinction coefficient, 6,220 m-1 cm-1. Specific activity of glutaminase without NaAD+ was determined with 20 mm glutamine and 0.9 μg of Qns1. The ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase assay was performed with 1 mm NaAD+ and 2 mm NH4Cl as an amide donor in the presence of 0.3 μg of Qns1.Kinetic analyses of the glutaminase activity of Qns1 were completed as described above for specific activity but with varied concentrations of glutamine (0-80 mm) and either a saturating amount of NaAD+ (1 mm) or no NaAD+. NAD+ synthetase activity of Qns1 was measured by assaying varied concentrations of NaAD+ (0-400 μm) in the presence of saturating glutamine (20 mm). Effects of NaAD+ on glutaminase and NAD+ synthetase activities were determined using glutamine concentrations from 0 to 10 mm in NaAD+ varying from 0 to 600 μm. ATP dependence assays were completed in the same manner but with 0-80 mm glutamine and either 0 or 2 mm ATP in the reaction buffer. Kinetic assays utilized 0.5 μg of Qns1 and were incubated from 60 to 180 min at 37 °C. ATP and NaAD+ concentrations were calculated using their extinction coefficient at 259 nm (15,400 m-1 cm-1). In all cases, initial rates were calculated from reactions in which no more than 10% of substrates were converted to products.RESULTSMore Than One Glutamine Is Consumed per NAD+ FormedThe Qns1 enzyme was presumed to have perfect stoichiometry until proven otherwise. To establish the exact stoichiometry of the Qns1 reaction under a variety of conditions and avoid errors associated with measuring two different products, we wished to convert the glutamate product and the NAD+ product to a common molecule that could be placed on an absolute scale. The solution to this problem was to link glutaminase assays to production of NADH using nonlimiting amounts of glutamate dehydrogenase and NAD+ and to link NAD+ synthetase assays to production of NADH using nonlimiting amounts of ethanol and alcohol dehydrogenase. This experimental solution placed glutamate and NAD+ assays on a common and absolute scale.Under conditions of saturating ATP, glutamine, and NaAD+, the rate of glutaminase activity was shown to exceed the rate of NAD+ formation by two different criteria. First, we measured the specific activity of wild-type Qns1 in the four assays schematized in Fig. 2. Second, we determined the initial rates of NAD+ and glutamate formation to determine the kcat for NaAD+ to NAD+ formation (under conditions of saturating glutamine) and the kcat for glutamine to glutamate formation (under conditions of saturating NaAD+). As shown in Table 1, in specific activity terms and under condition of near saturation of both active sites, wild-type Qns1 consumes 3300 nmol/min/mg glutamine while producing only 2300 nmol/min/mg of NAD+. This represents a 40% excess of glutamine to NAD. In kcat terms, as shown in Table 2, wild-type Qns1 turns over 6.4 glutamine molecules/s/active site when provided with 1 mm NaAD+ (∼7-fold over the 0.15 mm Km of NaAD+ for NAD+ formation). However, wild-type Qns1 produces only 5.4 NAD+ products/s/active site when provided with 20 mm glutamine (∼4-fold over the 5.3 mm Km of Gln for Glu formation). The kcat comparison, representing the conceivable maximal rates of each active site, still indicates that Qns1 wastes a 20% excess of glutamine in production of NAD+ when both active sites are saturated.FIGURE 2Assays utilized for analysis of Qns1 glutaminase and NAD+ synthetase activities. Assay I measures glutamate produced by the glutaminase domain in the presence of both glutamine and NaAD+ and typically ATP. Assay II measures glutamine-dependent NAD+ formation in the presence of glutamine, NaAD+, and ATP. Assay III measures glutaminase activity in the absence of NaAD+. Assay IV measures ammonia-dependent NAD+ formation. Qns1 is depicted as a channel from the glutaminase active site to the synthetase active site. Conserved residues are depicted in their predicted relative locations along the ammonia channel (1Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol.

Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33049-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, although all of these mutants severely inhibited the formation of NAD+ from glutamine and NaAD+, the glutaminase domain mutants did not inhibit formation of NAD+ from ammonia and NaAD+, and the synthetase domain mutants did not inhibit the basal glutaminase activity (1Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33049-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As further illustrated in Table 1, wild-type Qns1 exhibits a nearly 30-fold increase in glutaminase-specific activity when provided with 1 mm NaAD+. Because the E527A active site mutant did not accelerate glutaminase activity in the presence of NaAD+ (1Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33049-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we wished to examine the kinetic and physical basis for stimulation of glutaminase activity by NaAD+. As seen in Table 2, NaAD+ increases glutaminase activity >50-fold in the kcat term, from 0.12 to 6.4 s-1 with little effect on the Km of Gln. Thus, the NaAD+-bound form of Qns1 has a higher glutaminase activity rather than a higher affinity for glutamine binding.The Ks-NaAD+ for Glutaminase Stimulation Is Lower than the Km-NaAD+ for NAD+ FormationA simple hypothesis to explain the synthetase active site-dependent (1Bieganowski P.

Chem. 2003; 278: 33049-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) acceleration of glutaminase kcat requires invoking a pseudo-active site or reactant role for NaAD+ “pulling” the ammonia product from the glutamine substrate. According to this view, the NaAD-AMP intermediate produced by NaAD+ binding to the synthetase active site might catalyze glutaminase activity by functioning as an ammonia acceptor. Failure of the synthetase-dead E527A mutant to accelerate glutaminase activity in the presence of NaAD+ (1Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33049-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) is consistent with this view. Moreover, we reasoned that glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetase might be tuned to function with maximal efficiency at some ideal concentration of substrates. For example, if the glutaminase kcat is 20% too high for the synthetase kcat then, potentially, the enzyme might have evolved to function lower on the glutamine rate curve than on the NaAD+ rate curve in order to match the active sites.As shown in Fig. 3, we titrated NaAD+ above and below the 150 μm Km for NaAD+ to NAD+ formation and measured both NAD+ formation and glutaminase activity as a function of glutamine concentration. At 600 μm NaAD+ (4 times the Km-NaAD+ for NAD+ formation), the enzyme produces 0.6 equivalents of NAD+ for every glutamine consumed over the whole range of glutamine concentrations. In this manner, when NaAD+ is saturating, NAD+ production is limited simply by glutamine availability and efficiency cannot be improved by dialing down the glutamine concentration (Fig. 3, A and D).FIGURE 3Effect of NaAD+ concentration on reaction efficiency. Rate curves for glutaminase (▪) and NAD+ synthetase (▴) at different concentrations of NaAD+. A, 600 mm NaAD+. B, 150 mm NaAD+. C, 50 mm NaAD+. D, a plot of NAD+ per glutamine efficiency as a function of concentrations of NaAD+ and glutamine substrates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast to the simple behavior at saturating NaAD+, the enzyme exhibited strikingly wasteful behavior at lower concentrations of NaAD+. For example, at 150 μm NaAD+ (Fig. 3B), at which the enzyme is half-maximal for NAD+ production with saturating glutamine, and at 50 μm NaAD+ (Fig. 3C), at which the enzyme has a very poor rate of NAD+ formation at saturating glutamine, the glutaminase was greatly stimulated in excess of NAD+ production. The poorest efficiencies measured for NAD+ production per glutamine are at high glutamine and low NaAD+ (Fig. 3D). Thus, at 50 μm NaAD+ and 10 mm glutamine, the synthetase active site is so slow with respect to the glutaminase active site that 88% of the glutamine is wasted.The rate curves in Fig. 3 clearly indicate that ammonia consumption by the NaAD+ reactant is not required for NaAD+ binding to stimulate glutaminase activity. To calculate the reversible substrate dissociation constant Ks for the ability of NaAD+ to stimulate the rate of glutaminase from the basal rate of 0.12 s-1 to the fully accelerated rate of 6.4 s-1, we assayed glutaminase activity in the presence of 0-80 μm NaAD+ over a range of glutamine concentrations (1-10 mm) (Fig. 4A). We determined the kcat and Km values at each NaAD+ concentration and plotted the glutaminase kcat/Km(apparent) as a function of the log of NaAD+ concentration. As shown in Fig. 4B, half-maximal stimulation of glutaminase in kcat/Km(apparent) terms occurs at 6.3 μm NaAD+. Therefore, NaAD+ binding to Qns1 with a Ks of 6.3 μm converts it from the glutaminase slow form to the glutaminase fast form. Remarkably, the Ks-NaAD+ is 24-fold lower than the Km of NaAD+ for NAD+ formation. This indicates that NaAD+ is bound by Qns1 in a manner that does not result in ammonia consumption by the NaAD-AMP reactant that, nonetheless, stimulates glutaminase activity. Moreover, this unanticipated homosteric regulation of the Qns1 glutaminase active site suggests that Qns1 evolved to function with highest efficiency at high levels of the NaAD+ substrate.FIGURE 4NaAD+ stimulation of the glutaminase active site occurs well below the Km-NaAD+ for NAD+ formation. Glutaminase activity was measured without NaAD+ and at seven concentrations of NaAD+ from 1 to 80 mm. Initial rate data are plotted in panel A. To calculate a Ks-NaAD+ for stimulation of the glutaminase active site, the kcat/Km(apparent) of the glutaminase activity was determined at each concentration of NaAD+ and plotted against NaAD+ concentration. As shown in panel B, Ks-NaAD+ for stimulation of the glutaminase active site (midpoint of the sigmoidal activation plot) is at 6.3 mm, 24-fold lower than the Km-NaAD+ for NAD+ formation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Stimulation of the Glutaminase Active Site by NaAD+ Depends, in Part, on ATPThe fact that NaAD+ binding to Qns1 accelerates glutamine consumption well below the Km for NAD+ formation suggested the possibility that NaAD+ binding without the formation of an NaAD-AMP intermediate might stimulate glutaminase. We tested this hypothesis by titrating NaAD+ and glutamine in reactions not including ATP. Inspection of the rate curves in Fig. 5A revealed that NaAD+ in the absence of ATP binding increases both the Km and kcat of the glutaminase. As shown in Fig. 5B, although there is a kcat stimulation of glutaminase by NaAD+ in the absence of ATP, the kcat stimulation is offset by impaired glutaminase-Km such that the kcat/Km(apparent) is static over the whole range of NaAD+ concentrations. The results indicate that Qns1-NaAD+ binds glutamine poorly, although Qns1-NaAD+-Gln is a faster glutaminase than Qns1-Gln. The Ks-NaAD+ for stimulation of kcat glutaminase is 3.6 μM.FIGURE 5NaAD+ stimulation of the glutaminase active without ATP is offset by elevated Km-Gln. Glutaminase activity was measured without NaAD+ and at seven concentrations of NaAD+ from 1 to 80 mm in assays performed without ATP. Initial rate data are plotted in panel A.

These signaling molecules typically act downstream of tyrosine kinase receptors and often facilitate nucleotide exchange on more than one member of the Rho GTPase superfamily. Three unique GEFs, i.e. p115, PDZ-RhoGEF, and LARG, are activated by the G-protein coupled receptors via the Gα12/13, and exhibit very selective activation of RhoA, although the mechanism by which this is accomplished is not fully understood. Based on the recently solved crystal structure of the DH-PH tandem of PDZ-RhoGEF in complex with RhoA (Derewenda, U., Oleksy, A., Stevenson, A. S., Korczynska, J., Dauter, Z., Somlyo, A.

We show that while Trp58 of RhoA is intimately involved in the interaction with the DH domain, it is not a selectivity determinant, and its interaction with PDZ-RhoGEF is unfavorable. The key selectivity determinants are dominated by polar contacts involving residues unique to RhoA. We find that selectivity for RhoA versus Cdc42 is defined by a small number of interactions.

The Rho family GTPases, comprised of 22 distinct, yet homologous proteins encoded in the human genome, act as molecular switches that regulate a plethora of cellular functions including regulation of actin cytoskeleton, cell cycle progression, gene transcription, neurite growth, cell adhesion, cell migration, and others (1Jaffe A.B.

Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). The most ubiquitous and the best studied of these are RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 (1Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar, 3Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar, 5Hall A.

The upstream stimuli activating Rho-mediated processes typically involve both tyrosine kinase receptors and G-protein-coupled receptors. The signals are then transmitted either directly or through cascades of protein-protein interactions, to guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), 2The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PRG, PDZ-RhoGEF; DH, Dbl homology domain; PH, pleckstrin homology domain; Mant, N-methylanthraniloyl; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ITSN, intersectin. i.e. large, multidomain cytosolic proteins that are capable of catalyzing the exchange of the GDP nucleotide on the GTPase for GTP and therefore activate the respective signaling pathway (8Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). The GEFs can either activate specific Rho-GTPases or several of them. A vast majority of Rho-specific GEFs physically act on the respective GTPase through two intimately linked domains, i.e. a 200-residue-long Dbl homology (DH) domain and an adjacent, 100 residue long PH domain (9Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Genomic analyses reveal around 70 such GEFs in the human genome, several of which are products of oncogenes linked to various forms of cancer (8Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that the isolated DH-PH tandem is constitutively active and that in their nascent, inactive form in the cytosol the GEFs inhibit that activity through supramodular interdomain interactions (10Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Because of its biological importance, the mechanism by which the DH-PH fragment exerts its function has been under considerable scrutiny. It has been shown early on, that the DH-domain specifically binds to and stabilizes nucleotide-free form of its cognate Rho-GTPase (11Cherfils J. Chardin P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 306-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). This alone could tip the equilibrium toward a GTP-containing complex, because cells contain about 10 times as much GTP as GDP, and upon release from the complex with GEF, the GTPase, which binds both nucleotides with approximately the same affinity, is much more likely to bind the more abundant GTP. Two questions are particularly intriguing about the activation mechanism of the Rho-GTPase: 1) why are some GEFs specific for one GTPase while others activate indiscriminately two or more targets; and 2) what exactly is the role of the PH domain which invariably accompanies the DH domain at the C terminus. In the past few years our understanding of the mechanistic aspects of DH-PH interactions with Rho-GTPases has been significantly expanded because of a number of crystallographic investigations which revealed atomic models of several complexes. These studies included the DH-PH tandem of Tiam1 in complex with Rac1 (12Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), Dbs in complexes with Cdc42 (13Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and RhoA (14Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and ITSN (intersectin) in complex with Cdc42 (14Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The studies revealed that the DH domain is primarily responsible for the nucleotide exchange function and GTPase recognition and that it interacts with the respective GTPase in a conserved fashion. In general terms, there are three distinct surface patches on the GTPase, which come into contact with any DH domain. The first two involve residues within switch I and switch II of RhoA. These generic contacts pry the nucleotide binding site open and are responsible for the stabilization of the nucleotide free GTPase. However, these highly conserved interactions of both switch regions do not include structural determinants required for specific recognition of GTPase by a given member of Dbl family and so in the absence of additional interactions they could conceivably allow for the binding of any DH domain to any Rho-GTPase. The actual specificity-defining epitope on the GTPase includes the solvent-exposed residues from the β1, β2, and β3 strands. On the basis of the characterized crystal structures of complexes of GTPases with respective DH-PH tandems, it has been possible to formulate some general schemes by which selectivity is achieved (8Rossman K.L.

However, these results do not explain all the aspects of GTPase selectivity by various highly specific GEFs. One such family, acting downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors, includes p115 (18Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). All three proteins contain an RGSL (RGS-like) domain, which is believed to mediate interactions with Gα12/13 (22Chen Z.

These three GEFs almost exclusively activate RhoA, showing either marginal or no activity on Rac1 or Cdc42. Although two recently determined crystal structures reveal how the DH-PH tandems of PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG interact with nucleotide free RhoA (26Kristelly R. Gao G. Tesmer J.J. J. Biol.

In this paper, we present a detailed mutational and functional analysis of how the isolated DH-PH tandem of PDZ-RhoGEF (denoted from here on DH-PHPRG) interacts with RhoA. These results complement and expand on earlier studies and allow a reassessment of the molecular basis of selectivity. We show that the Trp58 residue in RhoA is not a selectivity determinant, and its interaction with PDZ-RhoGEF is in fact unfavorable. The cohesive interactions are dominated by polar contacts involving residues unique to RhoA. We find that selectivity for RhoA versus Cdc42 is critically defined by a relatively small number of interactions. Site-directed Mutagenesis of RhoA, Cdc42, Rac1, and DH-PH—The recombinant DH-PHPRG fragment (residues 712-1081) and the isolated DH domain were cloned into pDEST15 vector in fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST) as described in previous study (27Derewenda U. Oleksy A. Stevenson A.S. Korczynska J. Dauter Z. Somlyo A.P. Otlewski J. Somlyo A.V. Derewenda Z.S.

The clone used in this study contained an accidental mutation, N715T, which was a result of a cloning artifact. This mutation was propagated in all derivative clones obtained by mutagenesis. We determined that this mutation fractionally increases the catalytic activity of the DH-PH tandem variants but does not impact on the comparative results presented in this study. Human RhoA (residues 1-193), Cdc42 (residues 1-191), and Rac1 (residues 1-192) were individually cloned into a modified pET vector (28Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) in fusion with a His6 tag. The Quikchange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene, Inc. was used to generate all mutants described in this paper, according to manufacturer's instructions. Expression and Purification of Mutant Proteins—The wild type form and mutants of DH-PHPRG were expressed as GST fusion proteins in the BL21(DE3)-RIL E. coli cells. Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicilin to an A600 of 0.8-1.0 and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 21 °C overnight. Purification protocol was based on the procedure described for the wild type DH-PHPRG (29Oleksy A. Barton H. Devedjiev Y. Purdy M. Derewenda U. Otlewski J. Derewenda Z.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) except for the ion-exchange chromatography (HiTrap Q-Sepahrose, Amersham Biosciences), which replaced size exclusion as the final purification step. Briefly, the N-terminal-tagged mutants were purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography, subsequently digested with recombinant tobacco etch virus (30Kapust R.B. Tozser J. Fox J.D. Anderson D.E. Cherry S. Copeland T.D. Waugh D.S. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), and passed over the second glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove the GST moiety. Following the ion-exchange chromatography, the samples were estimated to be at least 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. The protein concentration was determined using UV absorption at λ = 280 nm. RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1 mutants were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography according to the protocol described previously for wild type RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1 GTPases (27Derewenda U. Oleksy A. Stevenson A.S. Korczynska J. Dauter Z. Somlyo A.P. Otlewski J. Somlyo A.V. Derewenda Z.S.

Prior to nucleotide exchange, assays purified GTPases were incubated with excess GDP (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) in the presence of EDTA. After 1 h, excess MgCl2 was added, and the unbound nucleotide was removed using a HiPrep desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Assay—The rate of guanine nucleotide exchange was monitored by the increase in the N-methylanthraniloyl-GTP (Mant-GTP) fluorescence intensity as a result of its binding by the GTPase. Mant-GTP analog was synthesized according to the published protocol (31Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). GDP, GTP, N-methylisatoic anhydride, and triethylamine were purchased from Sigma. The exchange reaction was monitored using a Jasco FP-750 spectrofluorimeter at 21 °C, in a 1-cm stirred quartz cuvette in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol. Briefly, the exchange reaction mixture containing 1 μm GDP-preloaded GTPase and 500 nm Mant-GTP was allowed to equilibrate, while stirred, and the relative fluorescence increase of the Mant-GTP (λex = 356 nm, λem = 445 nm, slits = 5 nm/5 nm) was monitored simultaneously. After ∼200 s equilibration time, the DH/PH tandem, or the isolated DH domain, was added at 100 nm and the stimulated exchange reaction was continued for 600 s. The initial rates of guanine nucleotide exchange were determined by linear regression analysis of data corresponding to 10-100 s after DH/PH stimulation, depending on the mutant's activity. Parallel, intrinsic exchange activity in the absence of the DH/PH tandem was measured for each mutant after equivalent equilibration time and used as control. Each nucleotide exchange assay was carried out three times, and the presented data constitute an average. The average variation among measured rate did not exceed 15%. Fold stimulation values were calculated as the ratio of the initial exchange rate of DH or DH-PH-stimulated reaction to the intrinsic rate of exchange for the wild type or mutant GTPase. Selectivity of Wild Type DH-PHPRG and Choice of Mutants—We reported previously (27Derewenda U. Oleksy A. Stevenson A.S. Korczynska J. Dauter Z. Somlyo A.P. Otlewski J. Somlyo A.V. Derewenda Z.S. Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 1955-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that the isolated DH-PHPRG tandem retains the high specificity for RhoA, consistent with the specificity reported for full-length PDZ-RhoGEF (20Fukuhara S.

Re-measurements of the nucleotide exchange rate enhancement by the wild type DH-PHPRG under the same conditions as those used for all mutant proteins described below, yielded values close to those reported previously, i.e. 124-fold for RhoA and weak, but measurable 3-fold for Cdc42.

The crystal structure of the DH-PHPRG-RhoA complex (27Derewenda U. Oleksy A. Stevenson A.S. Korczynska J. Dauter Z. Somlyo A.P. Otlewski J. Somlyo A.V. Derewenda Z.S. Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 1955-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) shows that the contact between the PH domain and RhoA is limited to only two H-bonds: one involving Asn1068 within the PH domain and Glu97 of RhoA and another between Ser1065 and the main chain amide of Glu97. Mutations of either of the two residues on PH to Ala have no significant impact on the nucleotide exchange enhancement (data not shown). However, there is also an indirect contact, involving the carbonyl of Met966, which is H-bonded to Asn929 within the C-terminal fragment of the α6 helix of the DH domain, which in turn is H-bonded to Arg68 within the switch II of RhoA. When Asn929 is mutated to Ala, the stimulation is significantly reduced (data not shown). This is most likely due to the stabilizing effect that the PH domain exerts on the long helix, which connects it with the DH domain (α6 helix of the DH domain) and to a much lesser extent on the direct interaction of the PH domain with the GTPase. Thus, we conclude that for all practical purposes the functionally important DH-PH/RhoA contacts defining the GTPase specificity exclusively involve the DH module. We asked, therefore, if an isolated DH domain was capable of mediating nucleotide exchange on RhoA. We designed three DH-domain constructs, i.e. 712-943, 729-939, and 712-932. Of these, the last one was expressed at high levels in E. coli and had the ability to stimulate nucleotide exchange on RhoA ∼48-fold but not at a level of the DH-PH tandem. The 729-939 variant of DH domain has marginal activity, as reported previously (27Derewenda U. Oleksy A. Stevenson A.S. Korczynska J. Dauter Z. Somlyo A.P. Otlewski J. Somlyo A.V. Derewenda Z.S. Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 1955-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), but this appears to be primarily a result of poor stability (data not shown). Thus, although the PH domain does not seem to play a direct role in defining the GEF's specificity, its presence is required for the expression of full activity and therefore we used the full DH-PHPRG tandem in all subsequent experiments. The crystal structure of the DH-PHPRG tandem in complex with RhoA (Fig. 2A) shows that the specificity-defining epitope on the target RhoA GTPase involves residues from the β1, β2, and β3 strands, i.e. Arg5, Glu40, Val43, Asp45, Glu54, Trp58, and Asp76 from switch 2 loop (Fig. 1A). Except for Trp58, which is also found in the homologous position in Rac1 (Trp56), all these residues are unique to RhoA (Fig. 1B), and they interact primarily with the cluster of amino acids located on the α5 helix of the DH domain, specifically Arg867, Arg868, Leu869, Arg872, Asp873, and Ile876 (Fig. 2, B and C). To better understand the functional aspects of this interface we prepared a series of single and multiple site mutants of both RhoA and DH-PHPRG. The functional properties of these mutants are shown in Tables 1 and 2.FIGURE 1A, a molecular surface representation of RhoA.

In GEFs other than PDZ-RhoGEF, the amino acids corresponding to Leu869 and Ile876 have been shown to be critical for RhoA/Rac1 recognition and also for recognition of Cdc42 through interaction with Phe56 in the latter GTPase (14Snyder J.T.

A leucine, with its bulky side chain (equivalent to Ile876 in DH-PHPRG), is preferred in all Cdc42-specific GEFs, which accommodate the smaller Phe56 of Cdc42. In contrast, an isoleucine is found at this position in those GEFs that recognize the indole moiety of Trp in RhoA and Rac1. Thus, mutations Leu1376 → IleITSN (Cdc42-specific GEF) and Leu766 → IleDbs (Cdc42/RhoA-specific GEF) allowed both GEFs to catalyze exchange in Rac1 (14Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L.

Moreover, a Trp56 → Phe substitution in Rac1 resulted in the complete loss of its sensitivity to Tiam1 (Rac-specific GEF) and allowed for recognition by ITSN (Cdc42-specific GEF) (16Karnoub A.E. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Pruitt W.M. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. Der C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 32Gao Y. Xing J. Streuli M. Leto T.L. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47530-47541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, Trp56 of Rac1 (equivalent to Trp58 in RhoA) was proposed as a necessary and sufficient specificity determinant for recognition by Rac-specific GEFs (32Gao Y. Xing J. Streuli M. Leto T.L. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47530-47541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of Trp58 for specific recognition of RhoA by DH-PHPRG we mutated this residue to Phe. Surprisingly, the Trp58 → Phe mutant of RhoA shows significantly enhanced sensitivity to DH-PHPRG with 198-fold stimulation in contrast to the 124-fold stimulation observed for wild type GTPase (Table 2 and Fig. 3A). In addition to Trp58, Val43 is also an important component of the hydrophobic “knob” on RhoA. Its side chain is in van der Waals contacts with Leu869 and Arg868 of DH-PHPRG. In Cdc42 and Rac1, the equivalent position is occupied by Ala and Ser, respectively. When Val43 is replaced in RhoA with a Ser, the exchange activity is reduced ∼25-fold, the most critical impairment among all tested mutants of RhoA (Table 2 and Fig. 3A). We then asked how changes in the Trp58-Val43 cradle of the DH domain affect its functionality. We noted that the position equivalent to Ile876 in PDZ-RhoGEF and other Rho-specific GEFs is not restricted to an isoleucine and that other hydrophobic residues are found in this position, e.g. Pro in p115 and LARG, Leu in Lfc and Lbc, Met in Vav, and Val in Vav2. In contrast, Cdc42-specific GEFs prefer leucine and Rac1-specific GEFs isoleucine at the equivalent position. We made four single-site mutants at position 876, replacing the wild type Ile with the four above listed amino acids. The activity of these mutants correlates inversely with the size of the substituted side chain. Methionine, the largest of the four, reduces the activity 4-fold, while, in contrast, a Pro results in a nearly 2-fold increase in activation (Table 1 and Fig. 3B). This trend is consistent with the behavior of the Trp58 → Phe mutant of RhoA (Table 2 and Fig. 3A). Thus, either reducing the size of the residue in position 58 of RhoA, or increasing the size of the corresponding pocket on the DH domain, increases significantly the activity of DH-PHPRG. Clearly, Trp is not an optimal residue on the RhoA GTPase for activation by PDZ-RhoGEF. In accordance with this observation, a substitution of Trp for Phe56 in Cdc42 completely abolishes the already weak activity of DH/PHPRG toward Cdc42 (data not shown). However, the Ile876 → Leu variant of DH/PHPRG is not sufficient to rescue the exchange rate on Cdc42 (Table 1). The second residue, which is critical for the functionality of the cradle, is Leu869. Its replacement with alanine in DH-PHPRG significantly reduces exchange activity on RhoA, from 124- to 20-fold (Table 1 and Fig. 3B). The majority of known RhoA-specific GEFs retain a Leu at the position equivalent to Leu869, whereas Cdc42-specific GEF-ITSN has a slightly larger Met in this position, allowed by the presence of alanine in position 41 of Cdc42 (Val in RhoA). The Leu869 → Met mutation did not, however, increase the sensitivity of DH-PHPRG toward Cdc42 (Table 1). The results of our experiments differ from those reported for the equivalent Leu759 and Leu766 in Dbs (15Cheng L. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Worthylake D.K. Korus M. Sondek J. Whitehead I.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6895-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which in vitro acts on both RhoA and, to lesser extent, Cdc42. Mutation of Leu759Dbs (equivalent to Leu869 in PDZ-RhoGEF) to both Met and Ile, crippled GDP exchange on RhoA as well as Cdc42. In contrast, substitutions of Met or Ile for Leu766Dbs (equivalent of Ile876 in PDZ-RhoGEF), both significantly enhanced nucleotide exchange on RhoA but did not affect the Cdc42 exchange. Both mutations resulted in a gain of function, which conferred on Dbs the ability to catalyze nucleotide exchange on Rac1. This was particularly evident for the L766IDbs mutant, which showed 57-fold activation of Rac1. The Cdc42 F56W mutant is also a good substrate for Dbs (L766I), with 81-fold stimulation of nucleotide exchange. Interestingly, a double mutant of both Leu759 and Leu766 to Met abolishes exchange on Cdc42 while maintaining exchange on RhoA. The Salt Bridge “Zipper”—Considering that Trp58 does not constitute a sufficiently cohesive interaction favoring RhoA, we set out to determine the specific role played by the cluster of charged residues, previously implicated as specificity determinants in the DH domain and involving residues Arg867, Arg868, Arg872, and Asp873 (Fig. 2C). We mutated Arg867, Arg868, Arg872, and Asp873 individually to amino acids that occur at these locations in other exchange factors with distinctly different specificities. All mutants show lower activity on RhoA, with mutants in position 868 showing the most dramatic effects. Even a conservative substitution to a Lys reduced nucleotide exchange stimulation from 124- to 28-fold, while mutation to Gly, a residue found at this position in intersectin, reduces it to mere 5-fold (Table 1 and Fig. 3C). A key role for a positively charged residue at this site in GEFs active on RhoA has been noted before based on the structure of the Dbs DH-PH tandem in complex with RhoA (14Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), in which a Lys in this position interacts with Asp45 and Glu54 of RhoA. A Lys→ Ala mutant of Dbs shows a half the rate enhancement of nucleotide exchange on RhoA (14Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), a significantly smaller difference than that caused by the removal of Arg868 on DH-PHPRG. Crystal structures of DH-PHLARG (26Kristelly R. Gao G. Tesmer J.J. J. Biol.

Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 1955-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) in complexes with RhoA both show that the Arg in question is involved in a multiple H-bond network with both Glu54 and Asp45 of RhoA. The higher resolution structure of DH-PHPRG/RhoA (27Derewenda U. Oleksy A. Stevenson A.S. Korczynska J. Dauter Z. Somlyo A.P. Otlewski J. Somlyo A.V. Derewenda Z.S. Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 1955-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) allows for a more reliable visualization of specific hydrogen bonds, although both models indicate that Arg868 forms two strong H-bonds to Asp45 and interacts via a single bond with Glu54 (Fig. 2C). Accordingly, the replacement of Asp45 with Asn in RhoA has more dramatic consequences than replacement of Glu54. Moreover, a double mutant of RhoA (D45N/E54Q) allows for only 9-fold enhancement of nucleotide stimulation (Table 2 and Fig. 3A). Thus, considering how Asp45 and Glu54 are both important for recognition, it is not surprising that Arg868, which engages both these amino acids, is critically important. While lysine retains the electrostatic attraction between the proteins, it is unable to form the three H-bonds, which seem to constitute the key structural determinant for the recognition of RhoA. Interestingly, previously published mutational studies of Rac1 (32Gao Y. Xing J. Streuli M. Leto T.L. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47530-47541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) show that Rac1 residues corresponding in RhoA to Val43, Asp45, and Glu54, i.e. Ser41, Asn43, and Asn52, do not play a role in recognition by either Trio, GEF-H1, or Tiam1. Thus, this epitope is associated with a new functionality for RhoA, rather than one with variable functionality, as is the case with Trp58. The crystal structure of the DH-PHPRG in complex with RhoA also reveals yet another unique electrostatic interaction, involving Arg5 of RhoA and Asp873 of DH-PHPRG (Fig. 2C). No such contact is possible for either Cdc42 or Rac1, which have Thr and Ala, respectively, at the position of Arg5 in RhoA. To verify the importance of this salt bridge we mutated both Arg5 of RhoA and Asp873 of DH-PHPRG. The R5ARhoA mutant shows ∼10-fold reduced response to DH-PHPRG as compared with the wild type (Table 2 and Fig. 3A). A replacement of Asp873 with a neutral Asn results in a similar (∼6-fold) reduction of the exchange activity of DH-PHPRG (Table 1 and Fig. 3C). Finally, two more salt bridges Asp867PRG-Glu40RhoA and Asp872PRG-Asp76RhoA exert moderate effects on the recognition of RhoA by PDZ-RhoGEF (Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 3, A and C). Conversion of Cdc42 and Rac1 into Substrates for DH-PHPRG—The critical changes in nucleotide exchange due to specific amino acid replacements suggest that susceptibility to PDZ-RhoGEF may be defined by the synergistic action of just a few residues on RhoA. To test whether such a limited surface epitope could effectively mimic RhoA, we engineered several mutants of Cdc42 and Rac1, in which positions 3, 41, 43, and 52, which correspond to Arg5, Val43, Asp45, and Glu54 in RhoA, are mutated to their RhoA counterparts (Table 3). Just a double substitution T3R/A41V in Cdc42 significantly elevated the susceptibility of GTPase to PDZ-RhoGEF, from 3- to 39-fold with additional increase of up to 64-fold for the quadruple variant T3R/A41V/T43D/T52E (Table 3 and Fig. 3D). Thus, only four mutations result in 20-fold higher sensitivity of Cdc42 to the catalytic activity of DH-PHPRG, converting GTPase to a substrate that is half as good kinetically as RhoA. In contrast, analogous variants of Rac1 behaved differently. The double mutant A3R/S41V has no impact on susceptibility to nucleotide exchange, and only moderate enhancement of sensitivity (up to 14-fold stimulation) was observed for the quadruple mutant A3R/S41V/N43D/N52E (Table 3 and Fig. 3D).TABLE 3Initial rates and fold stimulation values of nucleotide exchange reactions catalyzed by the wild-type DH-PHPRG on Cdc42 and Rac1 mutantsRFFSIntrinsic+DH-PH wild types−1 × 10−2Cdc42T3R0.323.210A41V0.2713.7T3R/A41V0.2710.539T3R/A41V/T43D/T52E0.2717.464Rac1A3R0.050.051S41V0.040.051A3R/S41V0.060.142.3A3R/S41V/N43D/N52E0.050.7214 Open table in a new tab The specificity of Dbl homology nucleotide exchange factors determines the interplay of numerous signaling and regulatory pathways in the cell. The GEFs of the p115 family show a unique pattern of acting downstream of Gα12/13-coupled receptors and activating selectively RhoA. The mechanisms by which these GEFs accomplish this selectivity have not been well studied to date. We show that in the case of PDZ-RhoGEF, this selectivity is due primarily to the synergistic functionality of several charged residues in the DH domain, namely Arg867, Arg868 and Arg872, and Asp873. These residues interact intimately with a unique cluster of amino acids on the solvent accessible face of RhoA, i.e. Arg5, Asp45, Glu54, and Asp76. No more than four mutations can dramatically alter the susceptibility of a GTPase to the catalytic activity of GEF. For example, the T3R/A41V/T43D/T52E mutant of Cdc42 is half as good a substrate as RhoA for DH-PHPRG."

Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. Vol. 1. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 887-901Google Scholar). In the first step, an amino acid is condensed with a single molecule of ATP to form an aminoacyladenylate intermediate. The activated amino acid is then transferred to the 3′-terminal adenosine of its cognate isoacceptor tRNA (2Carter Jr., C.W. Annu. Rev.

Inaccurate aminoacylation could yield infidelities during protein synthesis that would be expected to be detrimental for cell viability and survival (4Hendrickson T.L. de Crecy-Lagard V. Schimmel P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 147-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Linus Pauling had originally predicted that the rate of misactivation of isosteric substrates that differed by one methyl group (for example, alanine and glycine or isoleucine and valine) would be as high as 1 in 5 (5Pauling L. Festschrift fur Prof. Dr. Arthur Stoll. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1958: 597-602Google Scholar). However, the in vivo rate of valine misincorporation for isoleucine into cellular proteins was measured to be as low as 1 in 3000 (6Loftfield R.B. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 82-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This increased fidelity has been attributed to a double sieve mechanism that enhances discrimination and accurate selection of the correct amino acids (7Fersht A.R.

The canonical aminoacylation core acts as a coarse sieve where activation of the cognate amino acid as well as smaller non-cognate amino acids occurs.

Significantly, a key specificity discriminator at a conserved threonine in the editing active site blocks cognate leucine from binding (15Mursinna R.S. Lincecum Jr., T.L. Martinis S.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5376-5381Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) while allowing this wide array of amino acids to bind for hydrolytic editing. LeuRS shares a universally conserved aspartic acid that is also found in the CP1 domains of IleRS and ValRS. The aspartate forms a hydrogen bond with the amino moiety of the bound amino acid and is essential for hydrolytic editing. Mutations of this conserved aspartate abolish the editing activity of LeuRS, IleRS, and ValRS in vitro (13Lincecum Jr., T.L. Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Mursinna R.S. Williams A.M.

We hypothesized that cell viability and growth would be significantly affected by editing-defective LeuRS enzymes. Statistical protein mutations that are introduced via mischarged tRNALeu would be expected to alter or abolish the function of critical proteins. Our results show that amino acid editing is critical to bacterial survival. In contrast, the yeast mitochondrion appears to tolerate LeuRS infidelities. Thus, different organisms have varied thresholds for fidelity. It is also possible that these organisms have evolved alternate mechanisms to enhance fidelity that extend beyond the LeuRS CP1 domain. Materials—Oligonucleotides were obtained from MWG Biotech (High Point, NC). All 3H-labeled amino acids were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction endonucleases were acquired from Promega (Madison, WI), except BstNI, which was from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverley, MA). Cloned Pfu DNA polymerase and commercially mixed dNTPs were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The E. coli temperature-sensitive strain KL231 (F–, thy-35, str-120, leuS31) was obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center (Yale University, New Haven, CT) (37Low B. Gates F. Goldstein T. Söll D. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 742-750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pGP1-2 (38Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar) encoding the T7 RNA polymerase was a gift from Dr. Tracy Palmer (University of East Anglia). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The plasmid pYM3–17 (39Rho S.B. Martinis S.A. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2000; 6: 1882-1894Google Scholar) expressing the wild-type yeast mitochondrial LeuRS was used as a template to introduce mutations including T263V/T264V (TT/VV; pVK081), R265A (pVK064), and D357A (pVK078) for overexpression and purification of each protein for in vitro studies. Likewise, the plasmid ymLEURST (40Houman F. Rho S.B. Zhang J. Shen X. Wang C.C. Schimmel P. Martinis S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13743-13748Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), encoding the wild-type yeast mitochondrial LeuRS, was used as a template to generate the same set of mutations, T263V/T264V (TT/VV; pVK042), R265A (pVK100), and D357A (pVK102), and the plasmid pKIRAN, which also encoded wild-type E. coli LeuRS, was used as a template for generating homologous mutations T247V/T248V (TT/VV; pVK105), R249A (pVK106), or D345A (pVK108) for complementation assays in yeast null strains. The LeuRS mutations were made via PCR-based mutagenesis. A 50-μl PCR reaction mixture containing 50 ng of plasmid DNA template, 100 ng of each forward and reverse primer, 200 μm dNTPs, and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase in commercial buffer was heated at 95 °C for 1 min. The DNA was then amplified by PCR for 16 cycles under the following conditions: 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 20 min. The reaction was then restriction-digested with 20 units of DpnI for 3 h at 37 °Cand used for transformation of E. coli DH5α (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The DNA sequence of the mutant LeuRS genes were confirmed by SeqWright Laboratories (Houston, TX). Expression and Purification of Yeast Mitochondrial LeuRS—For protein overexpression, wild-type or mutant plasmids were used to transform the E. coli BL21 (DE3) codon PLUS (Stratagene). A single colony was used to inoculate 3 ml of Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol (LB-Amp/Cm) and grown overnight at 37 °C. The overnight culture was transferred to 500 ml of LB-Amp/Cm and grown at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.6–0.8. Expression of LeuRS was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 revolutions/min (JLA-10.500 rotor) for 15 min in a Beckman J2-HS centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of HA-1 (20 mm NaPi, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 5% glycerol) and sonicated at 60 A for 2 min using a Sonics Vibra Cell sonicator (Sonics, Newtown, CT). The lysate was separated from the cell debris by low speed centrifugation at 7500 revolutions/min (JA-17) for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was gently mixed for 1 h with HIS-Select HF nickel affinity resin (Sigma) that was pre-equilibrated with HA-1. The lysate was separated from the resin by low speed centrifugation in a clinical centrifuge. The resin was then washed with HA-2 (20 mm NaPi, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 5% glycerol) six times for 10 min each. The N-terminal His6-tagged LeuRS was eluted using 1 ml of HA-1 that contained 200 mm imidazole. Protein was concentrated using a centricon-50 (Amicon, Bedford, MA) and its concentration measured via the Bio-Rad protein assay according to the commercial protocol. Preparation of tRNALeu—The plasmid pymtDNAleu1 containing the gene for yeast mitochondrial tRNALeu was digested for 6 h at 60°C with 25 units of BstNI and then used as the template for in vitro transcription (41Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar, 42Sampson J.R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). A 1-ml reaction contained 450 μg of plasmid template, 40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 30 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, each dNTP at 4 mm, 80 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.02 units/μl RNase inhibitor (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), 2 mm spermidine, 0.01 mg/ml E. coli pyrophosphatase (Sigma), and 500 nm T7 RNA polymerase. The reaction mixture was incubated for 3 h at42 °C followed by a second addition of 500 nm T7 RNA polymerase and then incubated for an additional 3 h at 42°C. The RNA product was purified on a 10% polyacrylamide (19:1) 8 m urea gel. The tRNA band was detected via UV shadowing, excised from the gel, and extracted overnight in 0.5 m NH4OAC and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, at 37 °C. The supernatant was collected and the extraction repeated two more times. The tRNA was concentrated by butanol extraction, and a total of 1 μg/μl glycogen was added to the concentrated tRNA followed by ethanol precipitation. The tRNA pellet was washed twice in 70% ethanol, dried, and then resuspended in 100 μl of nuclease-free water (Ambion, Austin, TX). Purified tRNALeu was denatured at 80 °C for 1 min followed by the addition of 1 mm MgCl2 and quick cooling on ice. The concentration of the tRNA was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm using a calculated extinction coefficient of 878,500 L·mol–1 cm–1 (43Puglisi J.D. Tinoco Jr., I. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 304-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Plateau values for fully charged tRNALeu transcript indicated that ∼55% of the tRNA pool was competent for leucylation by yeast mitochondrial LeuRS. Aminoacylation Assays—Aminoacylation reactions contained 60 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μm yeast mitochondrial tRNALeu, 22 μm [3H]leucine (152 Ci/mmol), and 50 nm enzyme. The addition of KCl stimulates the enzymatic activity of yeast mitochondrial LeuRS. 2J. L. Hsu and S. A. Martinis, unpublished data. Misaminoacylation assays were carried out similarly, except 22 μm [3H]isoleucine (92 Ci/mmol) and 1 μm enzyme were used. The reactions were initiated with 4 mm ATP and carried out at room temperature. At specific time points, 5 μlof the reaction were quenched on Whatman grade 3 filter pads that were presoaked in 5% trichloroacetic acid. The pads were washed three times with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, once with 70% ethanol, and then finally anhydrous ether. The pads were dried and quantified in a Beckman LS 6000IC scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Post-transfer Editing Assays—Yeast mitochondrial tRNALeu was aminoacylated with [3H]isoleucine (92 Ci/mmol) by an editing-defective E. coli LeuRS mutant at 1μm in a reaction containing 60 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP, and 8 μm yeast mitochondrial tRNALeu. The reaction was incubated for 3 h at room temperature and quenched with 0.18% acetic acid. Protein was removed by extraction with 1 volume of phenol: chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (125:24:1), pH 5.2 (Fisher Biotech, Fair Lawn, NJ). A half-volume of 4.6 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.0, was added, and the mischarged tRNA was ethanol-precipitated. The dried pellet was resuspended in 50 mm KPi buffer, pH 5.0. A total of 140 pmol of mischarged tRNA was obtained. Hydrolysis assays were carried out using 60 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, and 300 nm mischarged yeast mitochondrial tRNALeu. As indicated above, including KCl increases the post-transfer editing activity of yeast mitochondrial LeuRS.2 The reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 nm enzyme and carried out at room temperature (15Mursinna R.S. Lincecum Jr., T.L. Martinis S.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5376-5381Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). At specific time points, 5 μl of the reaction were quenched on filter pads that were presoaked in 5% trichloroacetic acid and then washed and dried as described above. Yeast Complementation Assays—The yeast null strain HM402 (MATα ade2-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ura3-1 can1-100 nam2Δ::LEU2 (Δ introns)) carrying an allelic disruption in the nam2 gene encoding yeast mitochondrial LeuRS (44Li G.Y.

The HM402 strain contains an ade2 mutation, which enables the cells to develop a red pigment when the mitochondria are functional. Strains were transformed with plasmids encoding wild-type (ymLEURST) or TT/VV (pVK042), R265A (pVK100) or D357A (pVK102) editing-defective mutant yeast mitochondrial LeuRSs, wild-type (pKIRAN) or TT/VV (pVK105), R249A (pVK106) or D345A (pVK108) E. coli LeuRSs (TRP1 marker), as well as an empty vector (pQB153T) for a negative control. The upstream region of each E. coli LeuRS gene encoded a mitochondrial target sequence to allow import of the heterologous protein into the yeast mitochondria. Transformants were selected on synthetic complete medium containing 2% glucose and lacking leucine, tryptophan, and uracil (40Houman F. Rho S.B. Zhang J. Shen X. Wang C.C. Schimmel P. Martinis S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13743-13748Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Subsequently, transformants were grown on 5-fluoroorotic acid medium to allow the loss of the maintenance plasmid YEpGMC063. Selected transformants were grown on synthetic complete medium containing either 2% glucose or glycerol medium (Trp–, Leu–) to test for complementation activity (40Houman F. Rho S.B. Zhang J. Shen X.

Transformants were selected on LB medium containing antibiotics, including kanamycin (30 μg/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and ampicillin (100 μg/ml) as well as 200 μg/ml thymine and 100 μg/ml thiamine (LB-Amp/Kan/Str). Selected E. coli KL231 transformants were grown in 3 ml of minimal standard (MS) 3The abbreviation used is: MS, minimal standard. medium (37Low B. Gates F. Goldstein T. Söll D. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 742-750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 100 μg/ml of each of the following amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, valine, arginine, histidine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. It also included 40 μg/ml uracil, 40 μg/ml adenine, 200 μg/ml thymine, 100 μg/ml thiamine, and 2% glucose. Antibiotics including kanamycin (30 μg/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and ampicillin (100 μg/ml) were also added to generate MS-Amp/Kan/Str. Overnight cultures were transferred to 50 ml of MS-Amp/Kan/Str medium and grown until A600 = 0.8. The cells were shifted to 42 °C for 30 min followed by a 120-min incubation at 40 °C to allow the induction of the T7 RNA polymerase for expression of LeuRSs. The cells were then harvested and resuspended in 5 ml of MS-Amp/Kan/Str medium. A 500-μl aliquot of the cell suspension was mixed with 3 ml of 0.7% soft agar and spread evenly on the MS-Amp/Kan/Str medium plates. An aliquot of 100 μlof100 mm isoleucine was incorporated into a bored out well in the center of the plate. The isoleucine diffused to generate a concentration gradient of isoleucine around the well. Plates were incubated at 30 or 42 °C for 48–72 h. The diameter of the halo was measured, and the diameter of the well (1 cm) was subtracted from the halo diameter. Cell Growth Curves—The yeast null strain HM402 harboring either the wild-type or editing-defective D357A mutant yeast mitochondrial LeuRS was grown in 100 ml of synthetic complete Leu– Trp– medium containing 2% glycerol, 0.1% fluoroorotic acid in the presence or absence of 50 mm excess isoleucine. Cells were grown at 30 °C with constant shaking at 200 revolutions/min for a period of 48 h. Absorbance was measured at specific time points at 600 nm. For E. coli growth curves, 3-ml cultures of E. coli KL231 harboring either wild-type or the editing-defective D345A mutant E. coli LeuRS were grown at 30 °C in MS-Amp/Kan/Str medium. Cells were induced as described above to allow the expression of the enzymes. The cells were transferred to 100 ml MS-Amp/Kan/Str medium that either lacked or contained 10 mm excess isoleucine. The cells were grown at 200 revolutions/min for a period of 48 h at 42 °C. Absorbance measurements were taken at specific time points at 600 nm.

https://openalex.org/W1975375033,"Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 3 (eEF3) is a fungal-specific ATPase proposed to catalyze the release of deacylated-tRNA from the ribosomal E-site. In addition, it has been shown to interact with the aminoacyl-tRNA binding GTPase elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), perhaps linking the E and A sites. Domain mapping demonstrates that amino acids 775–980 contain the eEF1A binding sites. Domain III of eEF1A, which is also involved in actin-related functions, is the site of eEF3 binding. The binding of eEF3 to eEF1A is enhanced by ADP, indicating the interaction is favored post-ATP hydrolysis but is not dependent on the eEF1A-bound nucleotide. A temperature-sensitive P915L mutant in the eEF1A binding site of eEF3 has reduced ATPase activity and affinity for eEF1A. These results support the model that upon ATP hydrolysis, eEF3 interacts with eEF1A to help catalyze the delivery of aminoacyl-tRNA at the A-site of the ribosome. The dynamics of when eEF3 interacts with eEF1A may be part of the signal for transition of the post to pre-translocational ribosomal state in yeast.

The protein synthetic machinery is characterized by the interplay of different soluble factors in conjunction with ribosomes to translate the mRNA into the correct sequence of amino acids. The three phases of translation, initiation, elongation, and termination, are driven by factors that are highly conserved between yeast and metazoans (1Merrick W.C. Nyborg J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M. B Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 98-125Google Scholar). However, a major difference in elongation is the indispensability of eukaryotic elongation factor 3 (eEF3) 3The abbreviations used are: eEF, eukaryotic elongation factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Ni2+-NTA, nickel nitrilotriacetic acid; aa-tRNA, aminoacyl-tRNA; E-site, exit site; A-site, aminoacyl site; ABC, ATP binding cassette; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. with yeast ribosomes (2Skogerson L.

It has been proposed to act as an Exit-site (E-site) factor, facilitating the release of deacylated-tRNA and simultaneously impacting on the delivery of aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) at the aminoacyl site (A-site) (4Triana-Alonso F.J.

Metazoan ribosomes have been reported to possess a compensatory intrinsic ATPase activity, although they differ kinetically from the fungal eEF3 (5EL'skaya A.V. Ovcharenko G.V. Palchevskii S.S.

Escherichia coli, on the other hand, expresses the 911 amino acid RbbA protein that exhibits ATPase activity and is tightly associated with ribosomes (6Kiel M.C. Akoi H. Ganoza M.C.

Both pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi have been reported to contain eEF3 (8DiDomenico B. Lupisella J. Sandbaken M.G. Chakraburtty K.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, eEF3 is encoded by a single copy essential YEF3 gene. A paralog of the YEF3 gene, designated HEF3 or YEF3B, encodes an 84% identical protein but is not expressed during vegetative growth (11Sarthy A.V. McGonigal T. Capobianco J.O. Schmidt M. Green S.R. Moehle C.M. Goldman R.C. Yeast. 1998; 14: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, expression of the HEF3 coding sequence under the YEF3 promoter produces a protein that has similar ATPase activity and ribosome binding properties to YEF3-encoded eEF3. eEF3 is a class 1 member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins. eEF3 possesses distinct motifs including the HEAT repeats on the N terminus, two nucleotide binding domains with tandemly arranged bipartite (ABC) cassettes in the middle, a conserved insertion in the intervening region of the Walker A and B motifs of ABC2, and a highly basic C terminus. HEAT (Huntington elongation factor 3, A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A and TOR1) repeats correspond to a tandem α-helical structure that appears to serve as flexible scaffolding on which other proteins can assemble. Amino acids 98–388 within the eEF3 N-terminal HEAT domain have also been shown to interact with the 18 S rRNA (12Gontarek R.R. Li H. Nurse K. Prescott C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10249-10252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Within the Walker A and B motifs, the nucleotide binding stretch of seven amino acids in ABC1 and -2 are 100% conserved among the ATP-binding proteins (13Chakraburtty K. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The Walker C motif is the conserved LSGGQ sequence, the presence of which distinguishes the ABC proteins from other ATPases (14Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3382) Google Scholar). Alterations of the conserved glycine and lysine residues within the Walker A of either ABC1 or -2 abolish the ATP hydrolytic activity of eEF3 in vitro and are lethal for growth in vivo (15Yang H. Hamada K. Terashima H. Izuta M. Yamaguchi-Shita E. Kondoh O. Satoh H. Miyazaki M. Arisawa M. Miyamoto C. Kitada K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1310: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a temperature-sensitive (Ts–) F650S point mutant in the intervening region of the two ABC cassettes also affects the catalytic ATPase activity of the protein, indicating that the linker region affects either ATP binding or its hydrolysis (16Anand M.

Each monomer harbors a single ABC cassette and forms a homodimer in the presence of ATP to carry out hydrolysis, although there is variation in the manner by which each nucleotide binding domains from the two monomers collaborate to bind ATP molecules (21Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9609-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The lysine-rich C terminus of eEF3 (amino acids 980–1044) has previously been implicated as required for binding to the ribosome (22Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol.

During translation elongation, delivery of aa-tRNA to the A-site by eEF1A and the translocation of the ribosome by eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) require GTP hydrolysis (1Merrick W.C. Nyborg J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M. B Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 98-125Google Scholar). The unique role of eEF3 may be part of the transition of the post-translocational to the pre-translocational state via its ATP hydrolytic activity in yeast. The allosteric three-site model suggests that only two tRNAs can occupy the ribosome at one time, and thus, the exit of deacylated-tRNA is a prerequisite or corequisite for the delivery of aa-tRNA to the A-site (24Nierhaus K.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4997-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). eEF3 has been proposed to aid this removal and help promote the delivery of only cognate aa-tRNA by eEF1A to the A-site (4Triana-Alonso F.J. Chakraburtty K. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20473-20478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It remains unclear how and when eEF3 utilizes its ATP hydrolytic activity to carry out these functions. To address this question the present study analyzed the regions involved in, and the nucleotide-bound state that favors eEF3 binding to eEF1A. Our results point toward an enhanced eEF3 and eEF1A association in the presence of ADP, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis likely precedes eEF3 binding to eEF1A. The eEF1A binding region of eEF3 has been mapped to 2 regions near the C terminus. A genetic screen conducted in the current study resulted in a point mutation in one of the regions. A strain expressing the P915L eEF3 exhibits a temperature-sensitive (Ts–) growth defect and reduction in total translation. Additionally, the protein has negligible intrinsic and ribosome-stimulated ATPase activity and shows reduced affinity for eEF1A. Yeast and Bacterial Strains, Growth, Drug Sensitivity, and Translation Assays—S. cerevisiae strains and their genotypes are listed in Table 1. E. coli DH5α was used for plasmid preparation. Procedures for cell growth and genetic manipulations were according to standard protocols (27Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in either YEPD (1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) or in defined synthetic complete medium (C or C–) supplemented with 2% dextrose as the carbon source unless noted. Yeast were transformed by the lithium acetate method (28Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Temperature sensitivity was assayed by growing strains to an A600 of 1.0. Serial 10-fold dilutions (5 μl each) were spotted on appropriate medium followed by incubation at 13, 24, 30, and 37 °C for 3–7 days. Phenotypic suppression of a non-programmed +1 frameshift allele (met2-1 and his4-713) was determined by spotting 10 μl of the same dilutions onto complete medium lacking methionine or histidine, respectively, and incubating for 5 days at 30 °C. Halo assays for sensitivity to cycloheximide, paromomycin, and hygromycin B were performed as previously described (29Dinman J.D. Kinzy T.G. RNA. 1997; 3: 870-881PubMed Google Scholar).

The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 20 h and stopped by adding 100 mm NaCl and 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin. DNA was ethanol-precipitated, transformed into TKY554, and plated on C-Trp to select for the mutated yef3 TRP1 plasmid at a density of ∼150–300 cells/plate. Cells able to lose the wild type YEF3 URA3 plasmid were identified by growth on 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing media. The resulting strains expressing the yef3 TRP1 plasmid as the only form were analyzed for growth at 13, 30, or 37 °C. A colony unable to grow at 37 °C was recovered from the 30 °C plate, and the plasmid was extracted, transformed in E. coli, recovered, and retransformed into TKY554. Loss of the wild type YEF3 plasmid was repeated to confirm the phenotype. The P915L eEF3 mutant plasmid pTKB753 isolated in this screen was also constructed with a His6 tag on the N terminus by site-directed mutagenesis of pTKB602 by the QuikChange method (Stratagene), producing pTKB777. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of GST and His6-tagged eEF3, eEF1A, and Truncations—Full-length eEF3 and fragments containing amino acids 1–775 (85NT), 100–367 (HEAT), 775–910 (I), 910–1044 (15CT), and 775–1044 (30CT) were PCR-amplified using pTKB594 as the template. Fragments were cloned into pTKB544 for expression with a galactose-inducible promoter (GAL1-10) and an N-terminal GST tag, resulting in plasmids pTKB705, pTKB706, pTKB707, pTKB708, pTKB709, and pTKB710, respectively. The plasmids expressing the GST-tagged eEF3 fragments were transformed in TKY555 and maintained on C-Ura-His+galactose media for protein expression. Yeast cultures expressing the GSTeEF3 fusions were harvested at an A600 of 1.0–2.0, and total yeast extracts were clarified and loaded on the GST Trap column (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.2 mm PMSF). The protein was eluted with buffer A plus 20 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma). The protein peak was dialyzed into buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 100 mm KCl). To facilitate eEF3 purification from yeast, a His6 tag was added to the N terminus of S. cerevisiae eEF3 under the control of its own promoter on a CEN TRP1 plasmid producing pTKB602 (31Andersen C.F. Anand M. Boesen T. Van L.B. Kinzy T.G. Andersen G.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 1304-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A yeast plasmid expressing His6980 eEF3 was produced by introduction of a stop codon at amino acid 981 by QuikChange, producing pTKB724 (31Andersen C.F. Anand M. Boesen T. Van L.B. Kinzy T.G. Andersen G.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 1304-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The plasmids were introduced into S. cerevisiae strain TKY554, and loss of the wild type eEF3 on a URA3 plasmid was monitored by growth on 5-fluoroorotic acid, producing TKY702 and TKY805, respectively. His6-tagged wild type eEF1A, eEF3, 980eEF3, and P915L eEF3 proteins were purified from strains TKY616, TKY702, TKY805, and TKY819, respectively, on a Ni2+ Hi Trap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences). Total yeast extracts were clarified and loaded on the column in buffer C (50 mm KPO4, pH 7.6, 300 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.2 mm PMSF) with 20 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with buffer C plus 400 mm imidazole. The protein peak was dialyzed into buffer B. BspEI restriction sites were introduced upstream of the ATG initiation codon and downstream of the TAA stop codon using the QuikChange protocol in TEF1 on pTKB731 as template, producing pTKB740. His6-tagged eEF1A with BspEI restriction sites upstream and downstream of the open reading frame was constructed by PCR and cloning into pTKB740, resulting in plasmid pTKB779. Domain I (amino acids 1–221) was constructed by QuikChange mutagenesis of the Lys-222 and Lys-224 codons to TAA using pTKB779, producing pTKB852. His6-tagged domain III (amino acids 333–458) was obtained by looping out domains I and II using site-directed mutagenesis protocol of template pTKB779, producing pTKB785. Plasmids pTKB852 and pTKB785 were used as templates for PCR amplification of His6-domain I and His6-domain III fragments to clone into the pET11a vector, resulting in plasmids pTKB863 and pTKB851, respectively. His6-tagged domain II (amino acids 222–316) in pET11a was constructed by QuikChange mutagenesis of the Glu-316 and Arg-318 codons to TAA and TGA, respectively, using pTKB864 as the template to produce pTKB920. A 1-liter culture of E. coli BL21 with each plasmid was grown to an A600 of 0.6 in LB with 100 μg/ml ampicillin medium. Protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3–4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication, and the recombinant protein was purified in accordance with the QIAexpressionist protocol for His6-tagged proteins under native conditions. Protein-containing fractions were dialyzed into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, and 20% glycerol. ATP Hydrolysis—ATP hydrolysis was performed using purified proteins as previously described (32Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay mixture contained 24 pm protein, 50 pm yeast ribosomes, and 150 μm [γ-32P]ATP. Hydrolysis was allowed to proceed for 5 min at 30 °C, and 32Pi release was determined. ATP hydrolysis levels were calculated after subtracting the background for buffer alone. GST and His6 Pulldowns of eEF1A and eEF3—Yeast extracts for in vivo binding assays were prepared by glass bead lysis in TEDG buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm PMSF) from TKY555 with the empty plasmid pTKB544, GSTeEF3 (pTKB705), or the GST-eEF3 fragments (pTKB706, pTKB707, pTKB708, pTKB709, pTKB710). For GST and Ni2+-NTA pulldown assays, 200-μl reactions containing 50 μg of total protein (determined by Bradford reagent; Bio-Rad) and 40 μl of either 50% glutathione-Sepharose 4B slurry (Sigma) in KETN 150 buffer (150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet, and 1 mm PMSF) or Ni2+-NTA slurry (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare) in buffer C were mixed at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed 3 times with either KETN buffer with 150 or 300 mm KCl for GST pulldown or buffer C with 100 mm imidazole for Ni2+-NTA pulldown. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and were proteins were detected with a polyclonal antibody to yeast eEF1A and ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and quantitated with the ImageQuant program (GE Healthcare). Ni2+-NTA pulldown of purified untagged eEF1A with His6-tagged eEF3 or untagged eEF3 with His6-tagged eEF1A were performed with 2 μg of eEF3 and 3 μg of eEF1A as previously described (33Andersen G.R. Valente L. Pedersen L. Kinzy T.G. Nyborg J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Ribosome Binding Assay—The ribosome binding assay was performed as described previously (34Shin B.S. Maag D. Roll-Mecak A. Arefin B.S. Burley S.K. Lorsch J.R. Dever T.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 1015-1025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Fifty-μl reactions containing 24 pm purified proteins and 24 pm 80 S ribosomes in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm ammonium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 2 mm DTT) were incubated for 5 min at room temperature, layered on top of a 200-μl sucrose cushion (10% sucrose in binding buffer), and centrifuged at 74,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C in S80-AT2 (Sorvall) rotor. The pellet (bound fraction) was resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays—In vitro binding was measured by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Purified GSTeEF3 (0.25 μg) in 50 μl of PBST (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 2 mm KH2PO4)/well was coated overnight at room temperature in a 96-well ultrahigh binding polystyrene microtiter plate (Thermo-Labsystem). After blocking with 300 μl of 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBST for 1 h at room temperature and washing 3 times with 300 μl of PBST, 50 μl of 5000-fold-diluted affinity-purified polyclonal anti-eEF3 antibody was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Varying amounts of eEF1A along with varying amounts of ATP, ADP, GTP, or GDP were added to the eEF3 antibody. After washing 3 times with 300 μl with PBST, 50 μl of 2500-fold-diluted secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase was added per well (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Unbound antibody was removed by three washes of 300 μl of PBST followed by the addition of 50 μl of 3 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) in 50 mm Na2CO3 and 50 μm MgCl2/well. The extent of p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis represents the antigen-antibody binding measured by A415. eEF3 Interacts with eEF1A through Its C-terminal Region—Prior studies have demonstrated that eEF3 and eEF1A interact, as monitored by both genetic and physical assays in vivo and in vitro (16Anand M. Chakraburtty K. Marton M.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Kinzy T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6985-6991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To map the site of interaction, five fragments of eEF3 corresponding approximately to natural proteolytic sites were cloned into a GAL1-10-inducible expression vector with a GST tag at the N terminus (Fig. 1A). These include full-length eEF3 (amino acids 1–1044), 85NT, (1–775), HEAT (100–367), 15CT (910–1044), I (775–910), and 30CT (775–1044). All the fragments are expressed in yeast although at different levels, as monitored by Western blot with anti-GST antibody (Fig. 1B). The GST-tagged fusion proteins migrate at 140 (eEF3), 105 (85NT), 57 (HEAT), 42 (15CT), 58 (30CT), and 42 (I) kDa, with 29 kDa contributed by the GST tag. The same gel is also probed with anti-eEF1A antibody as the internal loading control. Because none of the eEF3 fragments can replace wild type eEF3 in vivo (data not shown), all were co-expressed with an untagged wild type copy of eEF3 to support growth. A GST pulldown assay was performed to determine the binding of eEF3 to eEF1A in total cell extracts. The 15CT, I, and 30CT GST fusion fragments co-purified eEF1A at levels similar to or above that of full-length eEF3. The 85NT, GST alone, and HEAT fragments co-purified less eEF1A, although some background level of binding was observed (Fig. 1C). The same experiment was also probed for co-elution of ribosomes with the eEF3·eEF1A complex. As shown in Fig. 1C, bottom panel, RPL10e, a ribosomal protein, is absent in the bound fractions. The middle panel, Fig. 1C, shows probing for phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1) as the internal loading control. Because the fusion truncations are expressed at different levels in vivo, the 85NT, 30CT, and 15CT GST-tagged fragments were purified from yeast, and GST pulldown experiments were performed with purified untagged yeast eEF1A. The GST-HEAT and GST-I fusion were not stably expressed at sufficient levels for purification. GST-15CT and GST-30CT co-purified with eEF1A at levels comparable with wild type GSTeEF3, whereas the GST-85NT was at background levels (GST, Fig. 1D). The results in Fig. 1, C and D, demonstrate that the eEF3·eEF1A interaction occurs in the absence of any cellular factors via the C-terminal region of eEF3. Dominant growth phenotypes conferred by the truncations were monitored on C-Ura-His+galactose medium at different temperatures. The 30CT and 15CT fragments confer a dominant slow growth phenotype at 13 °C, whereas no effects were seen at 30 or 37 °C (Fig. 1E and data not shown). Because there appear to be two eEF1A binding sites, one within amino acids 775–910 and one within 910–1044, fragments of eEF3 containing these amino acids may exhibit a dominant slow growth phenotype due to the formation of inactive complexes with eEF1A. The I fragment (775–910) does not show this growth phenotype, indicating the site from 910 to 1044 may have a larger effect in vivo. His6980eEF3 Is Functional in Vivo and Retains Binding to Ribosomes and eEF1A—Prior work proposed that the C-terminal 64 amino acids (980–1044), containing 40% basic residues, is the primary ribosome binding region of eEF3 (22Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6377-6381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Other work suggests the N-terminal 98–388 amino acids binds to 18 S rRNA in vitro and inhibit the ribosome-dependent ATPase activity of eEF3 (12Gontarek R.R. Li H. Nurse K. Prescott C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10249-10252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To determine the function of the basic C terminus of eEF3, His6-tagged eEF3 1–980 was expressed from a2μ TRP1 plasmid. This construct was able to function as the only form of eEF3 (Fig. 2A). Cells expressing His6980eEF3 as the only form of eEF3 have a slight slow growth phenotype (Fig. 2A). This effect is most noticeable at 13 °C. Western blot analysis of His6eEF3, wild type eEF3, and His6980eEF3 from strains TKY702, TKY554, and TKY805 with anti-eEF3 antibody (Fig. 2B) shows that His6980eEF3 protein is expressed at similar levels as full-length-tagged and untagged eEF3. The same gel was also probed with anti-eEF1A antibody as internal loading control. Therefore, although His6980eEF3 is stably expressed, its function in vivo is likely partially compromised. The role of amino acids 981–1044 in binding eEF1A was determined by Ni2+-NTA pulldown of extracts from strains expressing His6980eEF3, His6eEF3, or untagged eEF3. Supernatant and pellet fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the Western blot was probed with anti-eEF1A and anti-eEF3 antibodies. eEF1A associates with His6980eEF3 at levels comparable with full-length His6eEF3 (Fig. 2C). In the negative control with untagged eEF3, minimal background eEF1A was present in the pellet. The Ni2+-NTA pulldown was also performed with purified proteins, confirming that eEF1A binds to both His6eEF3 and His6980eEF3 directly (Fig. 2D). This indicates that residues 981–1044 are not required for eEF1A binding. Taken together with the truncation data (Fig. 1, C and D), it appears one eEF1A binding site is located within the 205-amino acid stretch from 775 to 910 and a second within amino acids 910–980. To determine whether the C terminus of eEF3 is dispensable for ribosome binding, purified His6eEF3 and His6980eEF3 were assayed for co-association with ribosomes through a sucrose cushion (Fig. 2E).

STAT3 appears to be fundamentally important for vertebrate organisms, being required for the self-renewal of embryonal stem cells in response to leukemia inhibitory factor signaling and for proliferation of some somatic cell types. Moreover, STAT3 is up-regulated in a range of tumors, and a modified version of STAT3 (STAT3C) has been shown to function as an oncogene, whereas inhibition of STAT3 can suppress tumor cell growth. The constitutive activity of oncogenic STAT3C was reported to depend on spontaneous dimerization directed by disulfide bonds in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation. In fact, tyrosine phosphorylation consequent upon cytokine or mitogen-induced signaling events remains obligatory for STAT3C activation. Instead, the DNA-binding affinity of phospho-STAT3C is elevated resulting in a faster on-rate and slower off-rate. The faster on-rate sensitizes STAT3C to cytokine stimulation, and the slower off-rate protects it from inactivation by nuclear phosphatases. These changes account for the ability of STAT3C to up-regulate persistently the expression of STAT3 target genes and promote cell cycle progression.

Darnell J.E.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2468-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar, 2Bowman T. Garcia R. Turkson J. Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2474-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). As well as sharing structural attributes with Rel/nuclear factor κB (NFκB) family members (3Becker S. Groner B. Muller C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), STATs also partly mirror their mode of activation by being resident in the cytoplasm as latent factors and translocating to the nucleus upon activation. According to the established model of activation, STAT monomers interact with tyrosine-phosphorylated cytokine or growth factor receptors through their SH2 domains, and they are themselves phosphorylated on a single tyrosine residue, whereupon they dimerize through reciprocal phospho-tyrosine-SH2 interactions, migrate to the nucleus, and bind to elements in the promoters of target genes (4Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar).Emerging details have expanded our knowledge of these processes. For example, Jove and colleagues (5Bild A.H. Turkson J. Jove R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3255-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that activated STAT3 moved from cell membrane to perinuclear structures along the endocytotic pathway. In addition, Vinkemeier and colleagues (6Meyer T. Begitt A. Lodige I. van Rossum M. Vinkemeyer U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 7Meyer T. Marg A. Lemke P. Wiesner B. Vinkemeier U. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1992-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) were able to show that nuclear entry was a continuous event involving both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated STAT1, but that, while unphosphorylated STAT1 was immediately exported, phosphorylated STAT1 remained in the nucleus and was protected from dephosphorylation by high affinity, sequence-specific binding to DNA.Other aspects of the established model, however, have been difficult to substantiate. For example, the existence of STAT monomers has been questioned by numerous reports of latent cytoplasmic STAT dimers and larger cytoplasmic STAT complexes (8Braunstein J. Brutsaert S. Olson R.

Furthermore, a molecular rationale for latent cytoplasmic STAT dimers has been provided by the crystal structures of unphosphorylated STAT1 and STAT5α (13Mao X. Ren Z. Parker G.N. Sondermann H.

In mice, deletion of the STAT3 gene results in early embryonal lethality (15Takeda K. Noguchi K. Shi W. Tanaka T. Matsumoto M. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3801-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). In addition, STAT3 is required for ES cell renewal (16Matsuda T. Nakamura T. Nakao K. Arai T. Katsuki M. Heike T. Yokota T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4261-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 17Niwa H. Burdon T. Chambers I. Smith A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar), and STAT3 inactivation is necessary for differentiation in the PC12 cell model (18Ihara S. Nakajima K. Fukada T. Hibi M. Nagata S. Hirano T. Fukui Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5345-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Conversely, cell transformation by oncogenic Src alleles requires the function of STAT3 (19Yu C.-L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 20Turkson J. Bowman T. Garcia R. Caldenhoven E. De Groot R.P. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), and indeed, a constitutively active version of STAT3 has been generated that functions as an oncogene (21Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell J.E.J. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar). The prediction that cysteines introduced at residues 662 and 664 in a loop of the SH2 domain in STAT3 would create a constitutively active protein (STAT3C) was supported experimentally, but a propensity for dimer formation through inter-chain disulfide bridges in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation was not formally demonstrated. This proposed mechanism made a number of assumptions, most important of which was that STAT3C activated target gene expression independently of mitogen or cytokine signaling. In addition it assumed that that STAT3C experienced an intracellular environment allowing stable, inter-chain disulfide bond formation.Our studies of STAT3 function led us to question the mechanism proposed for the behavior of STAT3C. We found that constitutive activity is only apparent and that cytokine or mitogen-induced signaling events and consequent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3C are obligatory for its activation. Our data show that the DNA binding affinity of phospho-STAT3C is elevated with respect to that of phospho-STAT3, resulting in a faster on-rate and slower off-rate. The faster on-rate sensitizes STAT3C to cytokine stimulation, and the slow off-rate protects it from inactivation by phosphatases. This increase in affinity underlies the ability of STAT3C to persistently up-regulate STAT3 target genes, including those that promote cell cycle progression.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Extract Preparation—HEK293 and COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected by DNA-calcium phosphate co-precipitations as described previously (22Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated cells were stimulated, respectively, with 10 ng ml–1 IL-6 or 50 ng ml–1 EGF.For immunoblotting experiments, lysates were prepared in TNEN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm Na4P207, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min and used directly for immunoprecipitations or stored at –20 °C for further use.For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, cells were maintained in medium containing 0.5% FCS overnight before application of appropriate stimuli. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (23Li L. Shaw P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17397-17405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) in hypertonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3V04, 1 mm Na4P207, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, and 1 μgml–1 each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin). Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from cells lysed in hypotonic buffer containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40, adjusted to 120 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol and cleared by centrifugation.Plasmids and Oligonucleotides—The expression vectors for FLAG-tagged STAT1, STAT3, STAT3-Y/F, STAT3C, and the pM67/SIE4-luc reporter were from Drs. Curt Horvath (Northwestern) and James Darnell (Rockefeller). The expression vectors for HA-tagged STAT1 and STAT3 were from Dr. Toshio Hirano (Tokyo, Japan).The expression vectors for FLAG-tagged STAT3C-Y/F, STAT3(C712A), and STAT3C(C712A) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Further details are available upon request.The oligonucleotides used to generate the m67SIE electrophoretic mobility shift assay probe, derived from the vSis-inducible element (SIE) of the human c-fos promoter, were as follows: upper, 5′-CTAGCATTTCCCGTAAAT; lower, 5′-CTAATTTACGGGAAATG.Antibodies—The anti-STAT1 and anti-STAT3 monoclonal antibodies were from BD Transduction Laboratories, the antiphospho-STAT1 and anti-phospho-STAT3 monoclonal antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, the rabbit polyclonal anti-STAT3 antiserum was generated in our laboratory, the anti-FLAG monoclonal was from Sigma, and the anti-HA monoclonal was from Roche Applied Science.Immunoblotting—Equal amounts of lysates were separated by electrophoresis through 8% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, washed, and stained with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. The membranes were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—DNA binding assays were carried out as previously described (23Li L. Shaw P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17397-17405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Extracts were incubated with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide duplex (m67SIE) in buffer containing 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 82 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.43 mm EDTA, 60 μg ml–1 poly(dI/dC), and 10% glycerol. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 2.5% glycerol in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer. Gels were fixed, dried, and analyzed with a FLA2000 phosphorimaging device (Fuji) and Aida software. For supershift analyses of SIE·STAT3 complexes, extracts were preincubated with anti-STAT3 antiserum in binding buffer containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 at room temperature for 1 h. Kinetic studies were performed according to established protocols (24Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar, 25Garner M.M. Revzin A.

Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 745-756Google Scholar). For on-rate experiments, binding reactions were applied directly to gels under current. For off-rates, complexes were allowed to form for 15 (wt and 3C) or 30 min (C712A) before addition of a 20-fold excess of unlabeled homologous competitor. Binding analyses were performed with GraphPad version 4.0. The Kon and Koff values were obtained separately from one-phase exponential association and decay.RESULTSPhosphorylation of Tyrosine 705 Is Essential for STAT3C Function—If STAT3C were able to form constitutive dimers, bind DNA, and activate transcription in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation, substitution of tyrosine 705 with phenylalanine should have no effect on STAT3C-dependent gene expression. However, as shown in Fig. 1A, Y705F substitution in STAT3C (STAT3C-Y/F) ablates the activation of a STAT3-dependent reporter gene, as it does in native STAT3 (STAT3Y/F), regardless of cytokine stimulation.In line with the failure of STAT3Y/F and STAT3C-Y/F to activate transcription, neither mutant bound to the optimized c-fos serum-inducible element (m67SIE) (Fig. 1B, lanes 7, 8, 15, and 16). However, although STAT3 binding to the SIE in the absence of IL-6 was almost undetectable (lanes 1 and 2), binding by STAT3C in unstimulated cells was clearly present (lanes 9 and 10), which correlates with the constitutive activity ascribed to STAT3C (Fig. 1A). Immunoblotting revealed no difference between the overall levels of STAT3, STAT3C, and the corresponding mutants in these experiments (Fig. 1C, lower panel), although IL-6-induced phospho-STAT3C was reproducibly lower (upper panel, compare lane 6 with lane 2). The weak phospho-STAT3 signals seen with the Y/F mutants can be attributed to low levels of endogenous STAT3 in HEK293 cells.Detection of Latent STAT3 Dimers by Co-immunoprecipitation—Several independent experimental approaches have indicated that latent STATs are present in cells as dimers or multimeric complexes (8Braunstein J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25499-25509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To assess dimerization by STAT3, we first performed co-immunoprecipitation assays with epitope-tagged STAT proteins. Although complexes with differentially tagged STAT1 proteins or containing STAT1 and STAT3 were barely detected in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 4), their formation was stimulated by co-expression of v-Eyk (lanes 3 and 5), which induces phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT3 as shown (28Besser D. Bromberg J.F. Darnell J.E.J. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast, STAT3-STAT3 complexes were readily detectable in the absence of either v-Eyk expression or cytokine stimulation (Fig. 2A, lane 6). HA-STAT3 formed complexes with FLAG-STAT3Y/F as readily as with FLAG-STAT3 (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 5) or indeed with FLAG-STAT3C (lane 7), implying that STAT3C is not restricted to constitutive dimers. FLAG-STAT3Y/F also co-precipitated HA-STAT3 and HA-STAT3Y/F with equal efficiency, confirming that STAT3 proteins interact in the complete absence of tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown).FIGURE 2STAT3 interactions in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation or disulfide bond formation. A, HEK293 cells were transfected with vectors for HA-STAT1 (lanes 1–5), FLAG-STAT3 (lanes 2, 3, and 6), FLAG-STAT1 (lanes 4 and 5), HA-STAT3 (lane 6), and vEyk (lanes 3 and 5) and serum-starved for 24 h. FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and potential dimerization was monitored by immunoblotting with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (upper panel). Protein expression and tyrosine phosphorylation were monitored in 5% (vol) of cell lysates (lower panels). B, cells were transfected with vectors for HA-STAT3 (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7), FLAG-STAT3 (lanes 2 and 3), FLAG-STAT3Y/F (lanes 4 and 5), or FLAG-STAT3C (lanes 6 and 7), serum-starved for 24 h, and processed as described above. C, cells were transfected with vectors for FLAG-STAT3 (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6) or FLAG-STAT3C (lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8), serum-starved for 24 h or starved and treated with IL-6 for 30 min, as indicated. Lysates were prepared and resolved on a non-reducing polyacrylamide gel. Monomeric STAT3 detected by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In an attempt to detect STAT3C dimers directed by disulfide bond formation we used non-reducing SDS-PAGE. However, no species potentially corresponding to STAT3C dimers was detected that was not also present with STAT3, either in nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts from starved or cytokine-stimulated cells (Fig. 2C). In summary, our data are consistent with the existence of latent STAT3 dimers, and we find no evidence for disulfide bond formation that could contribute to dimer formation by STAT3C.DNA Binding by STAT3C Is Refractory to Reducing Agents—It has been argued that DNA binding by STAT3C dimers is susceptible to agents that reduce inter-chain disulfide bonds (21Bromberg J.F.

We compared the susceptibility of STAT3 and STAT3C to several reducing agents and obtained conflicting results. STAT3C bound to the m67SIE in the presence of 0.5–50 mm DTT (Fig. 3A, lanes 1, 3, 4, 9, 11, and 12), 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol (lanes 2 and 10) or 5 mm tributylphosphine (lane 15), whether in nuclear extracts from unstimulated or cytokine-stimulated cells. Similar results were obtained when DTT was also included in gels (data not shown). Indeed, the presence of 10–50 mm DTT noticeably enhanced DNA binding by STAT3C (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1 and 2 with 3 and 4) and, like STAT3, STAT3C failed to bind to the m67SIE in the absence of DTT (supplemental Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. 3B, there was also no detectable difference in the susceptibility of STAT3 and STAT3C DNA binding to N-ethylmaleimide, indicating that the two proteins possess an equal complement of reactive cysteines that interfere with DNA binding when modified by N-ethylmaleimide.FIGURE 3Insensitivity of STAT3C DNA binding to various reducing agents. A, nuclear extracts from HEK293 cells, transfected with expression plasmids for STAT3 or STAT3C, and serum-starved for 24 h (lanes 1–4) or starved and stimulated with IL-6 for 30 min (lanes 5–15), were incubated with the m67SIE in the presence of 0.5 mm to 50 mm DTT, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, or 5 mm tributylphosphine as indicated. B, nuclear extracts from HEK293 cells transfected with expression plasmids for STAT3 (upper panel) or STAT3C (lower), starved and stimulated with IL-6 for 30 min, were incubated with the m67SIE in the presence of increasing amounts of N-ethylmaleimide, as indicated. C, STAT3C·m67SIE DNA complexes were formed and incubated for up to 2 h in the presence of 20-fold molar excess of cold competitor and 1 mm (left panel) or 10 mm DTT (right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To detect a potentially more subtle contribution of inter-chain disulfide bond formation to DNA binding, the dissociation of radiolabeled m67SIE·STAT3C complexes in the presence of cold competitor DNA, and different concentrations of DTT was followed. As shown in Fig. 3C, the stability of m67SIE·STAT3C complexes was not decreased in the presence of 10 mm DTT; in fact the presence of 10 mm DTT allowed more efficient initial binding (compare lanes 1 and 2 with 7 and 8). In summary, we found no evidence for a contribution of disulfide bond formation to DNA binding by STAT3C.Mutations in STAT3C Confer an Elevated DNA Binding Affinity—Despite the lack of evidence for inter-chain disulfide bond formation by STAT3C, it remained possible that the mutations introduced into STAT3C might affect DNA binding in another way. Thus we compared the DNA-binding properties of STAT3, STAT3C, and another mutant, STAT3(C712A). Cysteine 712 lies on the C-terminal arm of the phosphorylation loop in STAT3, where intercalation of alternate side chains in the dimer contributes to the dimerization interface (3Becker S. Groner B. Muller C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that a C712A mutation would impair DNA binding by STAT3.In the experiments shown in Fig. 4, nuclear extracts were prepared from IL-6-stimulated HEK293 cells expressing the proteins, and DNA-binding reactions were set up under optimized binding conditions (see “Materials and Methods”). In Fig. 4A, equivalent levels of phospho-STAT3 for each protein were used, as determined by immunoblotting (data not shown). On-rates determined for the three proteins varied considerably: STAT3C reached saturation within 5 min, STAT3 within 15 min, and STAT3(C712A) took at least 30 min. The on-rate constants estimated from one-phase exponential association were as follows: STAT3C = 1.532, STAT3 = 0.532, and STAT3(C712A) = 0.129 (min–1).FIGURE 4Elevated DNA binding affinity STAT3C. Nuclear extracts from HEK293 cells, transfected with expression plasmids for STAT3, STAT3(C712A), or STAT3C, serum-starved and stimulated with IL-6 for 30 min, were incubated with the m67SIE as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, DNA binding reactions containing STAT3 (lanes 1–6), STAT3(C712A) (lanes 7–12), or STAT3C (lanes 13–18) were incubated for the times indicated before loading onto non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels. B, preformed STAT3 (lanes 1–6), STAT3(C712A) (lanes 7–12), or STAT3C (lanes 13–18) complexes with radiolabeled m67SIE were incubated with a 20-fold excess of cold competitor m67SIE for the times indicated before loading onto non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels. C, increasing amounts of STAT3 (upper panel) or STAT3C (lower panel) were incubated with the m67SIE for 30 min. Signals were quantified by phosphorimaging with a Fuji FLA-2000 imager and Aida software. Each graph represents data from the experiment shown. Each experiment was performed twice with different protein samples giving near identical results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similar experiments were performed to establish off-rates for the three proteins. With amounts of nuclear extract that gave equal levels of m67SIE binding, we followed dissociation in the presence of excess cold competitor over 2 h (Fig. 4B). A similar pattern emerged: STAT3(C712A) dissociated more rapidly from the SIE than STAT3, and the SIE·STAT3C complex was the most stable. The off-rates obtained from these experiments were: STAT3(C712A) = 0.0138, STAT3 = 0.0116, and STAT3C = 0.0082 (min–1). In repeat experiments with different protein samples almost identical on- and off-rates were obtained (data not shown). From these data, KD values for STAT3 and STAT3C could be obtained. For STAT3 Koff/Kon = 0.0218 and for STAT3C Koff/Kon = 0.00532, indicating that STAT3C has a 4-fold lower KD than STAT3.In a third series of experiments we attempted to measure the difference between the dissociation constants for STAT3 and STAT3C. Again it was not possible to determine precise values for each protein, because the concentrations of phospho-proteins could not be determined. Nonetheless, the graph in Fig. 4C shows that the binding curve for STAT3C lies to the left of the one for STAT3 and that half-maximal binding by phospho-STAT3C is achieved with 35% of the protein required for the same level of binding by phospho-STAT3. Taken together these data indicate that STAT3C binds to the SIE with a 3-fold higher affinity than STAT3.Inactivation of STAT3C in Cells Is Delayed—The faster on-rate, lower dissociation constant, and slower off-rate for STAT3C offer an explanation for its increased transcriptional activity and associated transformation potential. First, from these data STAT3C would be predicted to achieve a greater degree of promoter occupation than STAT3 in response to low level stimulation. Second, once activated STAT3C would remain bound to promoter sequences for longer than STAT3. Because DNA binding has been shown to counteract the inactivation of STAT proteins by nuclear phosphatases (7Meyer T. Marg A. Lemke P. Wiesner B. Vinkemeier U. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1992-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), STAT3C would be more resistant to inactivation. The data presented in Fig. 1 above arguably support the first prediction (see “Discussion”), so the experiments described below first focused on the second prediction.Cells expressing STAT3, STAT3C, STAT3(C712A), or STAT3C(C712A), which contains the cysteines present in STAT3C as well as the alanine substitution of cysteine 712, were treated with IL-6 and harvested at various time points for analysis of STAT3 phosphorylation and DNA binding. Maximal DNA binding was observed 30 min after IL-6 stimulation for all proteins and decayed subsequently over an 8-h period (Fig. 5A). As anticipated, DNA binding by STAT3(C712A) decreased most rapidly and was undetectable after 4 h (Fig. 5A, second panel, lane 5, and B). DNA-binding activity by STAT3C(C712A) decreased less rapidly than STAT3(C712A), consistent with the notion that the additional cysteines in STAT3C complement for the defect in STAT3(C712A), but more rapidly than either STAT3 or STAT3C. Unexpectedly, DNA binding by STAT3 and STAT3C decreased with almost identical kinetics over the 8-h time course, and this effect was consistent in several independent experiments.FIGURE 5Duration of cytokine-induced STAT3 DNA binding and tyrosine phosphorylation. A, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for STAT3, STAT3(C712A), STAT3C, or STAT3C/C712A, serum-starved and stimulated with IL-6 for the times indicated before preparation of nuclear extracts and analysis of DNA binding (left panels) and tyrosine phosphorylation (right panels).

https://openalex.org/W2063937784,"Heat shock proteins play important roles in regulating signal transduction in cells by associating with, and stabilizing, diverse signaling molecules, including protein kinases. Previously, we have shown that heat shock protein Hsp70 associates with protein kinase C (PKC) via an interaction that is triggered by dephosphorylation at the turn phosphorylation motif. Here we have identified an invariant residue in the carboxyl terminus of PKC that mediates the binding to Hsp70. Specifically, we show that Hsp70 binds to Leu (Leu-640) immediately preceding the conserved turn motif autophosphorylation site (Thr-641) in PKC βII. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that mutation of Leu-640 to Gly decreases the interaction of Hsp70 with PKC βII. This weakened interaction between Hsp70 and the mutant PKCs results in accumulation of dephosphorylated PKC in the detergent-insoluble fraction of cells. In addition, the Hsp70-binding mutant is considerably more sensitive to down-regulation compared with WT PKC: disruption of Hsp70 binding leads to accelerated dephosphorylation and enhanced ubiquitination of mutant PKC upon phorbol ester treatment. Last, pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that Hsp70 preferentially binds the species of mature PKC that has become dephosphorylated compared with the newly synthesized protein that has yet to be phosphorylated. Thus, Hsp70 binds a hydrophobic residue preceding the turn motif, protecting PKC from down-regulation and sustaining the signaling lifetime of the kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2012620853,"The pluripotency of embryonic stem and embryonic carcinoma cells is maintained by the expression of a set of “stemness” genes. Whereas these genes are down-regulated upon induction of differentiation, the germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF) is transiently up-regulated and represses several pluripotency genes. CRIPTO-1, a co-receptor for the morphogen nodal, is strongly expressed in undifferentiated cells and is rapidly down-regulated during retinoic acid-induced differentiation. Although CRIPTO-1 is expressed at very low levels in adult tissues under normal conditions, it is found highly expressed in a broad range of tumors, where it acts as a potent oncogene. We show that expression of CRIPTO-1 is directly repressed by GCNF during differentiation of the human teratocarcinoma cell line, NT2. GCNF bound to a DR0 element of the CRIPTO-1 promoter in vitro, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and in vivo, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Reporter gene assays demonstrated that GCNF-mediated repression of the CRIPTO-1 promoter is dependent upon the DR0 site. Overexpression of GCNF in NT2 cells resulted in repression of CRIPTO-1 transcription, whereas expression of the transcription-activating fusion construct GCNF-VP16 led to an induction of the CRIPTO-1 gene and prevented its retinoic acid-induced down-regulation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CRIPTO-3, a processed pseudogene of CRIPTO-1 on the X chromosome, is expressed in undifferentiated NT2 cells and is regulated by GCNF in parallel to CRIPTO-1.

GCNF is expressed in ectodermal structures and the primitive streak of the embryo at embryonic day (E) 6.5 (10Susens U. Aguiluz J.B. Evans R.M. Borgmeyer U. Dev. Neurosci. 1997; 19: 410-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). At E9.5 expression becomes more restricted to the developing nervous system and is drastically down-regulated at day E10.5. In the adult animal, GCNF is mainly expressed in germ cells (8Chen F. Cooney A.J. Wang Y. Law S.W. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1434-1444PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of GCNF in mice resulted in embryonic lethality around E10.5 (11Chung A.C. Katz D. Pereira F.A. Jackson K.J. DeMayo F.J. Cooney A.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Likewise, knockdown of GCNF in Xenopus embryos caused severe developmental defects (12Barreto G. Reintsch W. Kaufmann C. Dreyer C. Dev. Biol. 2003; 257: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Conditional ablation of GCNF in the ovaries revealed an important function for fertility in adult animals (13Lan Z.J. Gu P.

GCNF is also expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells and in teratocarcinoma cell lines such as NT2 cells and P19 cells. It shows a peculiar expression pattern during retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation with an initial up-regulation followed by a gradual shutdown (14Heinzer C. Susens U. Schmitz T.P. Borgmeyer U.

The repression of pluripotency genes like NANOG and OCT4 by GCNF suggests that GCNF may have a central role in initiating differentiation of stem cells. CRIPTO-1 was initially cloned from NT2 cells as a RA-down-regulated gene (20Ciccodicola A. Dono R. Obici S. Simeone A. Zollo M. Persico M.G. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1987-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It is a member of the EGF-CFC gene family and was later shown to be a co-receptor for nodal (21Gritsman K. Zhang J. Cheng S.

Although CRIPTO-1 is widely expressed during early developmental stages in a complex expression pattern, it becomes restricted to the heart, forming structures around E8.0 (25Ding J. Yang L. Yan Y.T. Chen A. Desai N. Wynshaw-Boris A. Shen M.M. Nature. 1998; 395: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). It is indispensable for heart development and the specification of the anterior-posterior and left-right axis (25Ding J. Yang L. Yan Y.T. Chen A. Desai N. Wynshaw-Boris A. Shen M.M.

CRIPTO-1 is highly expressed in ES cells (27Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2003; 113: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar), where it is involved in cardiomyocytic differentiation and acts as a negative regulator of neurogenesis (28Xu C. Liguori G. Adamson E.D. Persico M.G. Dev. Biol. 1998; 196: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 29Parisi S. D'Andrea D. Lago C.T. Adamson E.D. Persico M.G. Minchiotti G. J.

In addition to its expression during early development and in stem cells, CRIPTO-1 is a potent oncogene, which is reactivated in a broad range of tumors (for review see Ref. 24Strizzi L. Bianco C. Normanno N. Salomon D. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5731-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Several pseudogenes of CRIPTO-1 reside in the human genome (31Scognamiglio B. Baldassarre G. Cassano C. Tucci M. Montuori N. Dono R. Lembo G. Barra A. Lago C.T. Viglietto G. Rocchi M. Persico M.G. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1999; 84: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). One of these, CRIPTO-3 is located on the X chromosome and retains an open reading frame as well as a portion of the promoter region of CRIPTO-1 (32Dono R. Montuori N. Rocchi M. De Ponti-Zilli L. Ciccodicola A. Persico M.G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 49: 555-565PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that GCNF binds directly to the CRIPTO-1 promoter and thus represses its transcription during RA-induced differentiation of NT2 cells. We further show that CRIPTO-3 is expressed and regulated in a similar manner. Our work strengthens the concept of GCNF as a regulator of stem cell differentiation by repressing genes specifically expressed in undifferentiated cells. Plasmids—The pSPUTK plasmid used for in vitro translation of HA-tagged GCNF has been described previously (15Schmitz T.P. Susens U. Borgmeyer U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For expression of GCNF in mammalian cells, the cDNA of HA-GCNF was cloned into the pCMX vector (33Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar) via HindIII/BamHI. The GCNF-VP16 cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Austin Cooney and has been described before (3Cooney A.J. Hummelke G.C. Herman T. Chen F. Jackson K.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The CRIPTO-1 promoter was amplified by PCR from human genomic DNA using the primers AGGTACCCCTGCAAGCGGCACATCAGAG (CRIPTO-1 forward) and AACTCGAGGCGTTAGCATCGCTTTAATCAGA (CRIPTO-1 reverse). The PCR product was ligated via KpnI and XhoI into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by PCR using the mut-Cripto oligonucleotides described below. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Single-stranded oligonucleotides (purchased from MWG Biotech) were annealed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm NaCl and stored at -20 °C. Double-stranded oligonucleotides had 5′ overhangs of four nucleotides on both strands. For EMSAs, double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled using Klenow polymerase (New England Biolabs) with [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G25 spin columns (Roche Applied Science). Labeled oligonucleotides were stored at 4 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 60 mm NaCl. Binding reactions were performed in a total volume of 12 μl consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 80 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of Cot-1 DNA (Roche Applied Science), 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 1 μl of reticulocyte lysate or cellular extract, if not stated otherwise. A 30-min preincubation was followed by the addition and binding of 1 μl of the labeled oligonucleotides for 30 min at room temperature. For supershift experiments, 1 μl of polyclonal anti-GCNF serum (14Heinzer C. Susens U. Schmitz T.P. Borgmeyer U. Biol.

Acta. 1999; 1446: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or 1 μl of anti-HA antibody (Chemicon) was added for an additional 30 min. Complexes were resolved by nondenaturing PAGE in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C at 20 V/cm for 4 h. The gels were dried and exposed to BioMax MS film (Kodak).

Quantitative real-time Reverse Transcription PCR—Total RNA was extracted from uninduced and induced NT2 cells using the RNeasy Midi and Mini kits (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was carried out using the Superscript II system (Invitrogen) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Total RNA was incubated with bovine pancreatic DNase I (Roche Applied Science) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding EDTA up to 8 mm and by heat inactivation at 75 °C for 10 min. For tissue expression analysis, commercially available human cDNA panels were used (Clontech). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with the SYBR Green Jump-start TaqReady Mix (Sigma) following the instructions of the manufacturer but in a total volume of 20 μl. The quantitative real-time PCR was run on a Rotor Gene RG 3000 cycler (Corbett Research) using the standard PCR protocol (95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 20 s; 40 cycles). The following primers were used: CRIPTO-1 for: GTGATTTGGATCATGGCCATTTCTAAAGT; CRIPTO-1 rev: GCTGTCATCTCTGAAGGCCAGGTA; CRIPTO-3 for: GTGATTTGGATCATGGCCATTTCTAAAGC; CRIPTO-3 rev: GCTGTCATCTCTGAAGGCCAGGTC; GAPDH for: CATCTTCTTTTGCGTCGCCA; GAPDH rev: TTAAAAGCAGCCCTGGTGACC. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were grown on 35-mm tissue culture dishes at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) containing 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells grown to ∼80% confluence were co-transfected with the indicated amounts of pCMX-HA-GCNF and 1 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmids using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Empty expression vector was used to keep the transfected amounts of DNA constant. Cells were harvested 24-36 h later. Ntera2/D1 (NT2) cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in OptiMEM (Invitrogen) with 5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) containing 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Differentiation of NT2 cells was induced by adding all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) to a final concentration of 1 μm. Transfection of NT2 cells was done using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), following the instructions of the supplier, with the recommended amounts of DNA. To minimize cellular toxicity, cells were transfected when they were about 90% confluent, and the transfection medium was replaced after 5 h with fresh antibiotic-free OptiMEM. RA was added where indicated. Cells were harvested and processed 48 h later. Cell Lysate and in Vitro Translations—Cell lysates were prepared essentially as described previously (14Heinzer C. Susens U. Schmitz T.P. Borgmeyer U. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) in extraction buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 80 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× Complete protease mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant was stored at -80 °C. In vitro translation was performed using the SP6-polymerase TnT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions and stored at -70 °C. Luciferase Assay—The luciferase activity of transfected cells was determined using the high sensitivity luciferase reporter gene assay (Roche Applied Science). Transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, dissolved in 170 μl of the lysis buffer supplied with the kit, and transferred into 1.5-ml reaction tubes. Cell debris was pelleted at 17,000 × g.50 μl of the supernatant was transferred into individual wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. Light emission was measured for 15 s in a luminometer (Microlumat LB96 P, EG&G Berthold). After the injection of 100 μl of luciferase reagent, light emission was integrated over time. Each experiment was performed in triplicates and repeated at least three times. Northern Blot—Total RNA was isolated from NT2 cells at the indicated time points with or without RA treatment using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5 μg of total RNA was separated by electrophoresis, blotted, hybridized, and washed following standard protocols. The Northern blot filters were hybridized with random primed [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes (Megaprime labeling kit, Amersham Biosciences) corresponding to full-length human CRIPTO-1 (GenBank™ accession number gi: 45709269) and a commercially available human β-actin probe (Clontech). After hybridization and exposure, filters were stripped in distilled boiling water containing 0.1% SDS and rehybridized after controlling the stripping efficiency. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—1 × 107 NT2 cells were induced with 1 μm RA for 20 h. Then cross-linking was accomplished by the addition of 37% formaldehyde to the medium to a final concentration of 1%. After 10 min at 37 °C cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and transferred into 1.5-ml tubes. After brief centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) containing Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). After rotation for 20 min at 4 °C, the lysate was sonicated on ice (UP50H, Dr. Hielscher GmbH) with a micro-tip probe (36 cycles, 30% max, 50% cycle) and pelleted (10 min, 13,000 × g, 4 °C). The supernatant (500 μl) was collected. One hundred μl was kept as an input control. Two 200-μl aliquots were diluted with 1800 μl of dilution buffer each (17 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 1.2 ml EDTA, 0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100). For precipitation 30 μl of rabbit polyclonal GCNF anti-serum was added. The preimmune serum served as a negative control. Incubation was performed on a rotating wheel overnight at 4 °C. Twenty μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and 10 μl of Cot-1 DNA (Roche Applied Science) were added and incubated for at least 2 h at 4 °C. Protein complexes were washed six times with salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100). Elution was performed twice by adding 150 μl of elution buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3, 1% SDS) for 15 min at 20 °C. Twelve μl of 5 m NaCl were added to the eluate, and protein-DNA complexes were de-cross-linked at 65 °C for 4 h. Six μl of 0.5 m EDTA, 12 μl of Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, and 2 μl of proteinase K solution (Roche Applied Science, 10 mg/ml) were added, and the reaction mix was incubated for 60 min at 45 °C. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction. DNA from the input fraction and from precipitates served as templates in a PCR using primers binding to the OCT4 and the CRIPTO promoters. Exon 6 of the arylsulfatase B (ARSB) gene served as negative control. The primers used were: CRIPTO for: TTTGTTGTTGAAGAAGGAGAATCC; CRIPTO rev: GGTCGTAGCAGAAGCAGGAGCAAGG; CRIPTO-1 for: GTGATTTGGATCATGGCCATTTCTAAAGT; CRIPTO-1 rev: GCTGTCATCTCTGAAGGCCAGGTA; CRIPTO-3 for: GTGATTTGGATCATGGCCATTTCTAAAGC; CRIPTO-3 rev: GCTGTCATCTCTGAAGGCCAGGTC; OCT4 for: ACACCATTGCCACCACCATTAGGC; OCT4 rev: TGAGGGCTTGCGAAGGGACTACTC; ARSB-6 for: TTCATGCCCATTAGAGAGAG; ARSB-6 rev: AGACACACTAGGTAATCAAAC. GCNF Binds to the CRIPTO-1 Promoter in Vitro—GCNF directly represses the genes OCT4 and NANOG, which play a role in keeping stem cells in an undifferentiated state (5Fuhrmann G. Chung A.C.

To explore, whether GCNF has a more general role for cell differentiation, we screened promoter sequences of genes down-regulated during RA-induced NT2 cell differentiation for GCNF binding sites. We identified a nearly perfect DR0 motif directly upstream, at positions -219 to -207 relative to the initiation codon ATG of the human CRIPTO-1 gene (Ensembl transcript ID: ENST00000296145) (Fig. 4C). First, we tested whether the DR0 motif is a binding site for recombinant as well as endogenous GCNF in vitro in EMSAs. In vitro translated HA-GCNF bound to the CRIPTO-1 probe as efficiently as probes containing motifs from established binding sites for GCNF, namely from OCT4 and a motif from the platelet-derived growth factor-β (SIS) promoter (Fig. 1A). The presence of HA-tagged GCNF in protein-DNA complexes was confirmed by a supershift of the complex either with a polyclonal anti-GCNF serum or with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody. In contrast, an oligonucleotide containing the DR0 motif from the CRIPTO-1 promoter, in which the central AGG had been replaced by CCC, was not bound by GCNF. The specificity of the GCNF/CRIPTO-1 promoter interaction was further assessed by competition of the labeled probe with an excess of unlabeled elements. 10-Fold excess of the unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotide but not of the unlabeled mutated probe nearly abolished the binding of GCNF to the labeled probe, confirming specificity (Fig. 1B). The CRIPTO-1 probe also bound a high molecular weight complex from cellular extracts from induced but not from uninduced NT2 cells (Fig. 2A). The addition of polyclonal anti-GCNF serum supershifted this slowly migrating complex (Fig. 2B). This identifies the complex as the previously described transiently retinoid-induced factor (TRIF), which is either a multimer of GCNF or contains additional, not yet identified components (34Gu P.

The OCT4 probe served as a positive control.FIGURE 1GCNF binds to a DR0 element of the CRIPTO-1 promoter. A, in vitro translated HA-tagged GCNF binds to different DR0 elements. The DR0 element from the platelet-derived growth factor-β promoter (SIS) and from the OCT4 promoter served as positive controls. The GCNF-DNA complexes were supershifted either by a polyclonal α-GCNF serum or by a monoclonal α-HA antibody. GCNF did not bind to a mutated probe (mut-CRIPTO: AGCTCAcccTCA).

The CRIPTO-1 promoter fragment activated transcription of a luciferase reporter gene about 7-fold. Its transcription could be repressed in a dose-dependent manner by co-transfection with increasing amounts of GCNF (Fig. 3A). The respective promoter construct with the mutant DR0 element was not repressed by GCNF (Fig. 3B). Notably, the basal activity of the mutated CRIPTO-1 promoter was significantly reduced to almost 50% (p < 0.05). In Vivo Binding of GCNF to the CRIPTO-1 Promoter—To confirm the in vitro binding of GCNF to the CRIPTO-1 promoter in vivo, we analyzed the GCNF/CRIPTO-1 promoter interaction by using ChIP. The binding of GCNF to the OCT4 promoter was used as a positive control, whereas exon 6 of the distantly located ARSB gene served as a negative control. After induction of NT2 cells by RA for 20 h and precipitation with a polyclonal anti-GCNF antibody, the genomic region surrounding the DR0 motif in the CRIPTO promoter and in the OCT4 promoter, but not the ARSB locus, could be amplified by PCR (Fig. 4A). Precipitation with preimmune serum did not result in an enrichment of the CRIPTO-1 or the OCT4 promoter. Thus, we have not only confirmed binding of GCNF to the human OCT4 promoter in vivo but also established CRIPTO-1 as a GCNF target. In Vivo Binding of GCNF to the CRIPTO-3 Promoter—Sequence analysis of the PCR product from the ChIP precipitate revealed a double peak G/A at position -168 relative to the start ATG in the 5′ untranslated region of CRIPTO-1 (Fig. 4B). The autosomal gene CRIPTO-1 has a highly homologous sequence on the X chromosome termed CRIPTO-3, which is currently believed to be a processed pseudogene (31Scognamiglio B. Baldassarre G. Cassano C. Tucci M. Montuori N. Dono R. Lembo G. Barra A. Lago C.T. Viglietto G. Rocchi M. Persico M.G. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1999; 84: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in addition to the CRIPTO-3 open reading frame, 0.7 kb of the upstream region is highly homologous to the CRIPTO-1 promoter. Compared with CRIPTO-1, only five nucleotides are exchanged, and a poly(T) stretch is shortened by two thymidines. Additionally, three nucleotide changes are found between the 5′-untranslated regions of CRIPTO-1 and CRIPTO-3. The predicted transcript of CRIPTO-3 with a continuous open reading frame has seven nucleotide changes, four of them coding, in comparison with CRIPTO-1. As the DR0 binding site and the surrounding sequences are 100% conserved in the CRIPTO-3 upstream region, we reasoned that GCNF might also bind to the CRIPTO-3 promoter. Comparison of the sequence of the ChIP precipitate with the sequences of CRIPTO-1 and CRIPTO-3 revealed that the guanidine at position -168 corresponds to CRIPTO-1, whereas the adenine corresponds to the CRIPTO-3 sequence (Fig. 4C). As amplicons from both genomic templates were detectable in the ChIP precipitate, GCNF obviously binds to the DR0 element not only in the CRIPTO-1 but also in the CRIPTO-3 promoter in vivo. RA-induced Recruitment of GCNF to the Promoters of CRIPTO-1 and CRIPTO-3—Next, we analyzed the binding of GCNF to the CRIPTO-1 and CRIPTO-3 promoters separately using gene-specific primers in response to RA treatment. Both the CRIPTO-1 and the CRIPTO-3 promoter could be amplified from the precipitate, confirming that GCNF binds to both"
https://openalex.org/W1968915099,"We previously reported the association between the activating enhancer-binding protein-2β (AP-2β) transcription factor gene and type 2 diabetes. This gene is preferentially expressed in adipose tissue, and subjects with the disease-susceptible allele of AP-2β showed stronger expression in adipose tissue than those without the susceptible allele. Furthermore, overexpression of AP-2β leads to lipid accumulation by enhancing glucose transport and inducing insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In this study we demonstrated that overexpression of AP-2β in 3T3-L1 adipocytes decreased the expression and secretion of adiponectin and increased those of interleukin-6 (IL-6). Interestingly, the effects of AP-2β on the expressions of adiponectin and IL-6 and the mechanisms by which AP-2β modulated their expressions were different. We found that the promoter activity of adiponectin gene was inhibited by AP-2β overexpression and enhanced by knockdown of endogenous AP-2β, whereas IL-6 was unaffected. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed the existence of putative responsive elements for AP-2β and NF-YA in human and mouse adiponectin promoter regions, and mutation of this AP-2β binding site abolished the inhibitory effect of AP-2β. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that AP-2β and NF-YA competitively bind to the same region of the adiponectin promoter. Our results clearly demonstrated that AP-2β directly inhibits adiponectin gene expression by displacing NF-YA and binding to its promoter. We conclude that AP-2β might modulate the expression of adiponectin by directly inhibiting its transcriptional activity."

Chem. 279, 1994-2004), we demonstrated that βPak-interacting exchange factor (βPIX) guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) mediates basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-stimulated Rac1 activation through phosphorylation of Ser-525 and Thr-526 at the GIT-binding domain (GBD). However, the mechanism by which this phosphorylation event regulates the Rac1-GEF activity remained elusive. We show here that βPIX binds to Rac1 via the GBD and also activates the GTPase via an associated GEF, smgGDS, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Notably, the Rac1-GEF activity of βPIX persisted for an extended period of time following bFGF stimulation, unlike other Rho GEFs containing the Dbl homology domain. We demonstrate that C-PIX, containing proline-rich, GBD, and leucine zipper domains can interact with Rac1 via the GBD in vitro and in vivo and also mediated bFGF-stimulated Rac1 activation, as determined by a modified GEF assay and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis. However, nonphosphorylatable C-PIX (S525A/T526A) failed to generate Rac1-GTP. Finally, βPIX is shown to form a trimeric complex with smgGDS and Rac1; down-regulation of smgGDS expression by short interfering RNA causing significant inhibition of βPIX-mediated Rac1 activation and neurite outgrowth. These results provide evidence for a new and unexpected mechanism whereby βPIX can regulate Rac1 activity.

Once Rho GTPase is activated by a DH domain, their interaction becomes weak and is followed by dissociation. Several laboratories have reported results consistent with the presence of a Rac/Cdc42-directed DH domain of βPIX (12Lee S.H. Eom M. Lee S.J. Kim S. Park H.J. Park D. J. Biol.

Rac1 activation occurred in a transient manner, reaching a peak 15 min after epidermal growth factor stimulation.

Taken together, DH-mediated activation of Rac1/Cdc42 appears to reach a peak and proceed to completion within 30 min after agonist stimulation. By contrast, we observed that βPIX stably interacts with Rac1, and more surprisingly, it exhibits prolonged activity toward Rac1 for up to 4 h following growth factor stimulation (15Shin E.Y.

The Vav family of GEFs has a cysteine-rich domain (CRD), which is located C-terminal to the DH-PH bidomain and allows binding to GTPases (20Heo J. Thapar R. Campbell S.L.

This interaction between Rac1/Rho (involving Ser-83 and Lys-116 of Rac1) may facilitate conformational changes and enhancement of Vav DH-mediated GEF activity toward Rac1. Interestingly, Vav-3 has a zinc finger domain, which can interact with RhoA in vitro and stimulate this GTPase (21Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). αPIX also has an extra Rac1-binding domain (RSID), which makes its dimeric form function as a unique Rac-specific GEF (22Feng Q. Baird D. Cerione R.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3492-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that βPIX might interact and activate Rac1 via a non-DH domain interaction and consequently promote Rac1 activation in a novel DH-independent mechanism. In this study, we identified GBD as a new stable Rac1-binding site. More importantly, this domain mediates Rac1 activation in collaboration with an associated GEF, smgGDS, in a phosphorylation (Ser-525 and Thr-526)-dependent manner.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human recombinant bFGF, Lipofectamine 2000, G418, and hygromycin B were purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-Rac1 and anti-GFP antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-smgGDS antibody and smgGDS cDNA (FLJ30470) were purchased from BD Biosciences and the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (Chiba, Japan), respectively. pEGFP-C2 and pCMV-myc were purchased from Clontech. Nonspecific siRNAs and specific siRNAs for smgGDS were purchased from Invitrogen. Raichu-Rac1 probe for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis was kindly provided by Dr. Matsuda Michiyuki (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan).Cell Culture and Differentiation—PC12 cells overexpressing FGF receptor-1 in a tetracycline-dependent manner were cultured as described previously (23Shin E.Y. Shin K.S. Lee C.S. Woo K.N. Quan S.H. Soung N.K. Kim Y.G. Cha C.I. Kim S.R. Park D. Bokoch G.M. Kim E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44417-44430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% Tet system approved fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm glutamine, 1× antibiotics (Invitrogen), 50 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 100 μg/ml G418 at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Prior to differentiation, PC12 cells were induced to overexpress FGF receptor-1 in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1.5 μg/ml doxycycline for 24 h and replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml bFGF, 2% FBS and 1.5 μg/ml doxycycline for 24-48 h.Transient Transfection and siRNA Treatment—PC12 cells were seeded on 60-mm culture dishes or 20 μg/ml poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. A mixture of 5 μg of DNA and 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 was added to culture dishes according to the manufacturer's instructions. For siRNA treatment, nonspecific siRNA and specific siRNA for smgGDS (5′-GAAGATGAATCCATGCAGAAAATTT-3′) at the indicated concentrations were transfected into cells with Lipofectamine 2000. After 3 days, expression of smgGDS was assessed by immunoblotting with anti-smgGDS antibody. The band intensity after exposure and development was digitized and analyzed by Quantity One software version 4.2.1 (Bio-Rad).Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 200 μm orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 1 h at 4°C. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with an appropriate antibody for 3 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by adding protein G-Sepharose and washed five times with lysis buffer and twice with PBS. Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in a Tris-glycine/methanol buffer (25 mm Tris base, 200 mm glycine, 20% methanol). Membranes were blocked with 3% skimmed milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h, incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, and washed three times (10 min each) with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were blotted with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After five washes with PBS and 0.1% Tween 20, signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). In some cases, membranes were stripped and reprobed with different antibodies.In Vitro Binding Assay—GST, GST-Rac1, and GST-smgGDS proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (DH5α) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. C-PIXHis, GBD-His, and p21-binding domain (PBD)-His proteins were expressed in M15 and purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. Equal amounts of GST (GST-Rac1) glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with His-tagged proteins or lysates from cells expressing various domains of GFP-βPIX. Beads were washed five times with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin), resolved on 9% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were immunoblotted with anti-His, GFP, or GST antibody.Modified GST-PBD Binding Assay—GEF activities of βPIX/truncated βPIX were measured as described previously (15Shin E.Y. Woo K.N. Lee C.S. Koo S.H. Kim Y.G. Kim W.J. Bae C.D. Chang S.I. Kim E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1994-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-PBD was expressed in E. coli (DH5α) and purified with glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Cells were stimulated with or without 30 ng/ml bFGF for 1 h, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-βPIX or anti-GFP antibody. Immunoprecipitates were further incubated with purified soluble GST-PBD (1 μg) at 4 °C for 2 h in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and washed five times with lysis buffer. Beads were boiled for 5 min, resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were immunoblotted with anti-GST antibody and then reprobed with anti-GFP, βPIX, Pak2, or Rac1 as described under “Transient Transfection and siRNA Treatment.”FRET Analysis—PC12 cells were plated on 40-mm dishes containing poly-l-lysine-coated 18-mm glass coverslips. One day after plating, Myc-tagged PIX constructs were co-transfected with Raichu-Rac1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Thirty six hours after transfection, cells were starved for 16 h and then treated with 30 ng/ml bFGF for 1 h. For Myc-tagged PIX staining, cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 15 min, and then blocked with 10% FBS for 1 h. Cells were incubated with anti-Myc antibody in 2% FBS/PBS for1hat37 °C, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, OR) for 1 h at 37°C. After staining, coverslips were mounted onto a glass slide with mounting medium (DakoCytomation). FRET was analyzed using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope system with HCX PL APO ×63 objective (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Excitation was provided by 20-milliwatt multimode argon ion laser lines. Donor (CFP) was excited at 458 nm, and fluorescence was detected in a bandwidth of 470-500 nm (CFP channel), whereas for acceptor (YFP), excitation was at 514 nm and emission at a bandwidth of 535-565 nm (YFP channel). For FRET, the excitation was at 458 nm and emission at a bandwidth 535-565 nm (FRET channel). Donor and FRET images were acquired from the respective CFP and FRET channels under the similar conditions. After background subtraction, FRET: CFP ratio images were generated by dividing the FRET image by the CFP image using MetaMorph software version 6.01 (Universal Imaging), and these ratios were used to represent FRET efficiency.Statistical Analysis—Paired t test was applied for statistical analysis of neurite outgrowth assay and FRET using SPSS version 10.0 for windows and the statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.RESULTSPIX Binds to Rac1 via GIT-binding Domain—To assess which domain of βPIX might be involved in a non-DH domain interaction, we generated two truncated βPIX constructs as follows: the first contains the N-terminal half of βPIX (N-PIX), including the SH3-DH-PH domains in sequence, and the second contains the C-terminal half of βPIX (C-PIX) (as illustrated in Fig. 1A). These constructs were introduced into PC12 cells and assessed for GST-Rac1 binding. As expected, both DH-containing full-length βPIX (FL-PIX) and N-PIX interacted with GST-Rac1 but not with GST or SH3 domain of βPIX (Fig. 1B, left). Interestingly, GST-Rac1 also bound C-PIX to the same extent as the N-terminal domain, although there did not appear to be any cooperativity of binding in the case FL-PIX. These results, however, did not exclude the possibility that the C-PIX: Rac1 association occurs indirectly through heterodimerization of C-PIX with endogenous FL-PIX, via the LZ dimerization (7Kim S. Lee S.H. Park D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10581-10584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Koh C.G. Manser E. Zhao Z.S. Ng C.P. Lim L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4239-4251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested the ability of bacterially expressed His-tagged C-PIX to bind GST-Rac1 in vitro. C-PIX interacted specifically with GST-Rac1 (Fig. 1B, right, lane 2), but not with GST alone (lane 1). These results indicate that βPIX binds Rac1 through a region independent of the DH domain. To further determine which part of C-PIX is involved in this binding, C-PIX was divided into three parts, namely a proline-rich region (PXXP), the GBD, and the LZ domains (Fig. 1A). Each domain was expressed in PC12 cells as GFP fusion proteins, and lysates were incubated with GST (control) or GST-Rac1 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Fig. 1C, left). C-PIX consistently showed a specific interaction with GST-Rac1, and thus was employed as a positive control (Fig. 1C, left, lanes 1 and 5). Only GBD exhibited a strong interaction comparable with that of the parental C-PIX (Fig. 1C, left, lanes 3 and 7). Further binding study with bacterially expressed His-tagged GBD revealed that direct interaction occurs between Rac1 and GBD (Fig. 1C, right). These results indicate that GBD plays a role in binding Rac1, independent of classical DH interactions. The related region (amino acid 546-779) derived from αPIX, which has 56% homology to βC-PIX (amino acids 401-646), also bound to GST-Rac1 (but not GST) (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 5). We thus determined whether the GBD of αPIX plays a similar role in binding Rac1. It also interacted with wild-type Rac1 and Cdc42 (Fig. 1E, lanes 1-6). Finally, we tested whether interaction between the C-PIX (GBD) and Rac1 is altered depending on the activation status of Rac1. It is well known that the p21-binding domain (PBD) of p21-activated kinase (Pak) specifically binds to Rac1-GTP but not Rac1-GDP. This interaction was therefore presented as a positive control (Fig. 1F, lanes 1 and 2). Unlike PBD-Rac1 interaction, GDP or GTP loading did not affect interaction of both C-PIX-Rac1 and GBD-Rac1 (Fig. 1F, lanes 3-6). This unexpected interaction between C-PIX (GBD) and Rac1 would make it clear how the modified GSTPBD assay as described under “Experimental Procedures” works (15Shin E.Y. Woo K.N. Lee C.S. Koo S.H.

More importantly, these results suggest that active Rac1-GTP can remain stably bound to βPIX via the GBD, providing a rationale to persistent βPIX-mediated Rac1 activity.C-PIX Mediates Activation of Rac1 but Not Cdc42 in Response to bFGF—Given that C-PIX stably interacts with Rac1, we wished to test whether this binding influences the regulation of Rac1. We conducted two different assays to measure Rac1 activation. One uses the ability of active GTP-bound, but not inactive GDP-bound Rac1/Cdc42, to bind GST-PBD (the modified GST-PBD binding assay) (15Shin E.Y. Woo K.N. Lee C.S. Koo S.H. Kim Y.G. Kim W.J. Bae C.D. Chang S.I. Kim E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1994-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The conventional GST-PBD binding assay has been used to detect active forms of Rac1/Cdc42 bound, but this method can not identify the GEF responsible for their activation. To overcome this handicap, the modified protocol we have been using involves immunoprecipitation of PIX constructs followed by the addition of soluble GST-PBD to bind βPIX-associated GTP-Rac1 or Cdc42. Active Rac1/Cdc42 in the immunoprecipitates of βPIX is able to bind added GST-PBD as detected by anti-GST. An underlying principle of this assay is that βPIX can stably hold the active GTP-bound form of Rac1/Cdc42 via a non-DH domain, GBD interaction (Fig. 1F). The other assay analyzes fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) images using a Raichu-probe for Rac1 in PC12 cells (24Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 25Aoki K. Nakamura T. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 713-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).As shown in Fig. 2A, left, in both FL-PIX- and C-PIX-expressing cells, bFGF increased levels of associated active Rac1/Cdc42, as determined by the appearance of a GST-PBD band (lanes 4 and 8). Only Rac1 (not Cdc42) was detectable in the immunoprecipitates retrieved by anti-GFP. Note C-PIX but not N-PIX had a stimulatory effect on associated Rac1-GTP levels that is comparable with that of FL-PIX (Fig. 2A, left, lanes 7 and 8). Surprisingly, neither GFP nor N-PIX activated Rac1 by these criteria, indicating that the DH domain in N-PIX by itself is not sufficient to mediate GEF activity (Fig. 2A, left, lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6); the N-PIX is likely compromised by a failure to undergo dimerization. Shin et al. (23Shin E.Y. Shin K.S. Lee C.S. Woo K.N. Quan S.H. Soung N.K. Kim Y.G. Cha C.I. Kim S.R. Park D. Bokoch G.M. Kim E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44417-44430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) previously showed that bFGF treatment resulted in phosphorylation of Ser-525 and Thr-526 within the GBD of βPIX, and this phosphorylation is critical for βPIX-mediated Rac1 activation (15Shin E.Y. Woo K.N. Lee C.S. Koo S.H. Kim Y.G. Kim W.J. Bae C.D. Chang S.I. Kim E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1994-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the new Rac1-binding domain falls within the same GBD region; such phosphorylation may therefore affect Rac1 binding/activation. To test this, cells were transfected with plasmids encoding C-PIX or mutant C-PIX (S525A/T526A), and their activity was measured by the modified GST-PBD binding assay (Fig. 2A, right). Wild-type C-PIX mediated the expected bFGF-stimulated Rac1 activation (Fig. 2A, right, lanes 1 and 2). However, cells expressing the nonphosphorylatable C-PIX did not generate Rac1-GTP (Fig. 2A, right lanes 3 and 4). Inability of mutant C-PIX to activate Rac1 was not because of disruption of its interaction with Rac1. Similarly, FL-PIX- and C-PIX-mediated Rac1 activation were dependent on phosphorylation of Ser-525/Thr-526 (15Shin E.Y. Woo K.N. Lee C.S. Koo S.H. Kim Y.G. Kim W.J. Bae C.D. Chang S.I. Kim E.G. J.

The C-PIX GBD-mediated Rac1 activation in response to bFGF suggested that this domain might associate with another GEF.FIGURE 2C-PIX activates Rac1 in response to bFGF stimulation. A, modified GST-PBD binding assay for Rac1/Cdc42 activation. Left panel, PC12 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-tagged FL-PIX, N-PIX, or C-PIX and maintained for 24 h. They were then stimulated with 30 ng/ml bFGF for 1 h. Equal amounts of protein from each lysate were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-GFP and incubated with soluble GST-PBD to trace active GTP-bound Rac1/Cdc42 in the immunoprecipitate. Bound GST-PBD was probed by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody (top panel). Expression of each construct as GFP fusion proteins was evaluated by probing with anti-GFP (middle panel) and anti-Cdc42 and Rac1 (bottom panel), respectively. In the right panels, cells were transfected with pEGFP plasmids encoding wild-type C-PIX (lanes 1 and 2) or mutant C-PIX (S525A/T526A) (lanes 3 and 4), and then the above procedure was applied. B, FRET analysis was performed to investigate Rac1 activation using a Raichu-Rac1 probe. Various Myc-tagged βPIX constructs were co-transfected with a Raichu-Rac1 probe into PC12 cells. Cells were starved for 16 h and then treated with bFGF or left untreated. Confocal images were obtained 1 h following bFGF stimulation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Representative ratio images of FRET:CFP after bFGF stimulation are shown in the intensity-modulated display mode. In the intensity-modulated display mode, eight colors from red to blue were used to represent the FRET:CFP ratio, with the intensity of each color indicating the mean intensity of FRET and CFP image. The upper and lower limits of the ratio image are shown on the right. Bar graphs represent the relative emission ratio (FRET:CFP) of the whole cell area.

https://openalex.org/W2005180502,"The procyclic stage of Trypanosoma brucei in the insect vector expresses a surface-bound trans-sialidase (TbTS) that transfers sialic acid from glycoconjugates in the environment to glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins on its surface membrane. RNA interference against TbTS abolished trans-sialidase activity in procyclic cells but did not diminish sialidase activity, suggesting the presence of a separate sialidase enzyme for hydrolyzing sialic acid. A search of the T. brucei genome sequence revealed seven other putative genes encoding proteins with varying similarity to TbTS. RNA interference directed against one of these proteins, TbSA C, greatly decreased the sialidase activity but had no effect on trans-sialidase activity. The deduced amino acid sequence of TbSA C shares only 40% identity with TbTS but conserves most of the relevant residues required for catalysis. However, the sialidase has a tryptophan substitution for a tyrosine at position 170 that is crucial in binding the terminal galactose that accepts the transferred sialic acid. When this same tryptophan substitution in the sialidase was placed into the recombinant trans-sialidase, the mutant enzyme lost almost all of its trans-sialidase activity and increased its sialidase activity, further confirming that the gene and protein identified correspond to the parasite sialidase. Thus, in contrast to all other trypanosomes analyzed to date that express either a trans-sialidase or a sialidase but not both, T. brucei expresses these two enzymatic activities in two separate proteins. These results suggest that African trypanosomes could regulate the amount of critical sialic acid residues on their surface by modulating differential expression of each of these enzymes.

African trypanosomes are protozoan parasites responsible for sleeping sickness in humans and a similar disease in domestic animals called nagana. Their life cycle alternates between the bloodstream of a mammalian host and the tsetse fly vector (Glossina sp.). The surface of the bloodstream form of the parasite is completely covered with 107 copies of a single variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) 3The abbreviations and trivial names used are: VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; TbTS, T. brucei trans-sialidase; TcTS, T. cruzi trans-sialidase; TrSA, T. rangeli sialidase; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; PLD, phospholipase D; IMAC, iminodiacetic acid metal affinity chromatography; MUNen5Ac, 2′-(4-methylumberifery)-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; Bistris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol. 3The abbreviations and trivial names used are: VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; TbTS, T. brucei trans-sialidase; TcTS, T. cruzi trans-sialidase; TrSA, T. rangeli sialidase; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; PLD, phospholipase D; IMAC, iminodiacetic acid metal affinity chromatography; MUNen5Ac, 2′-(4-methylumberifery)-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; Bistris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol. bearing a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. These bloodstream trypanosomes elude the immune response of the mammalian host by periodically switching from one VSG to another immunologically distinct VSG. The bloodstream form of the parasite differentiates into the procyclic form when ingested by the insect vector. This differentiation involves a remodeling of the surface in which the VSG coat is rapidly shed and replaced with a new set of invariant GPI-anchored glycoproteins known as procyclins (1Borst P. Cell. 2002; 109: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Procyclins have an unusual GPI anchor that, unlike the GPI anchor of VSGs, is decorated with branched poly-N-acetyllactosamine repeats capped by sialic acid residues (2Treumann A. Zitzman N. Prescott A.R. Almond A. Sheehan J. Ferguson M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 529-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Trypanosomes are unable to synthesize sialic acid, but the procyclic form of the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei expresses a specific enzyme, trans-sialidase (TbTS), that transfers sialic acid from sialylated glycoconjugates present in the tsetse fly midgut (such as in the blood meal or on the midgut cells) to acceptor molecules on its surface membrane (such as the side chain of GPI-anchored proteins and free GPIs) (3Vasella E. Butikofer P. Englster M. Jelk J. Roditi I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1308-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trypanosomes lacking sialic acids due to a defective GPI-anchored trans-sialidase do not survive in the midgut, indicating that sialic acid residues of the GPI are critical for the survival of the parasite in tsetse flies (4Nagamune K.

Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease in the Americas, has a different life cycle, and its developmental expression of trans-sialidase shows a different pattern. The noninvasive epimastigote form of T. cruzi in the midgut of its hemipterous blood-sucking insect vector expresses trans-sialidase (TcTS) late in this midgut stage. After transmission to the bloodstream of the mammalian host, T. cruzi parasites continue expressing trans-sialidase, although from a different set of genes, and rapidly acquire sialic acid from sialoconjugates in the host (5Schenkman S.

Alzari P.M. Frasch A.C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2941-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It should also be mentioned that the T. brucei and T. cruzi trans-sialidases have been found to be essentially trans-glycosidases. However, in the absence of acceptors of sialic acid in the milieu, they are able to release free sialic acid and thus are, to a much lower extent, hydrolytic enzymes.A comparison of the crystal structures of TcTS and TrSA (17Buschiazzo A. Tavares G.A. Campetella O. Spinelli S. Cremona M.L. Paris G. Amaya M.F. Frasch A.C.C. Alzari P.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and information derived from several mutagenesis approaches (16Montagna G. Cremona M.L. Paris G. Amaya M.F. Alzari P.M.

In the T. cruzi and T. rangeli enzymes, a conserved tryptophan residue (Trp-313) was shown to be implicated in the binding of substrate and to be necessary for the specificity of the enzyme for α-(2,3)-linkage sialic acid (18Paris G. Cremona M.L. Amaya M.F. Buschiazzo A. Giambiagi S. Frasch A.C.C. Alzari P.M. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Other residues surrounding the active site differ when the structures of sialidase and trans-sialidase are compared. In particular, Tyr-119 (replaced by serine in TrSA) was found to be essential for the transfer reaction and important in the structural environment of the catalytic nucleophile Tyr-342.T. cruzi trans-sialidases and T. rangeli sialidases are both encoded by a multigene family (7Schenckman S. Eichinger D. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 218-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). T. cruzi has ∼140 trans-sialidase genes, half of which encode proteins lacking activity due to a substitution of Tyr-342 by a histidine residue (20Cremona M.L. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. Campetella O. Gene. 1995; 160: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been postulated that T. brucei has a much lower number of trans-sialidase genes (16Montagna G. Cremona M.L. Paris G. Amaya M.F. Alzari P.M. Frasch A.C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2941-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently, two different partial sequences of putative trans-sialidase genes were identified in another African trypanosome species, Trypanosoma congolense (21Tiralongo E. Martensen I. Grotzinger J. Tiralongo J. Schauer R. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 1203-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis that the number of gene copies may be lower in African trypanosomes. In this work, we show that, in contrast to all other trypanosome species examined to date, T. brucei expresses on its surface different proteins bearing trans-sialidase and sialidase activities, an unusual situation that allows the parasite to regulate sialic acid content on its surface through independent enzymes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Transfections—Procyclic T. brucei 29-13 cells (T7RNAP NEO TETR HYG) or their derivatives were used for all studies. The T. brucei 29-13 cells were maintained in SDM-79 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and were transfected with EcoRV-linearized plasmid (5–10 μg) as described previously (22Hill K.L. Hutchings N.R. Russell D.G. Donelson J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3091-3101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Logarithmic phase cells (5 × 106 cells ml–1) were collected by centrifugation, washed with electroporation medium (a 3:1 mixture of Cytomix, 120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, KiHPO4, 25 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.6) and phosphate solution (277 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 7 mm KiPO4, pH 7.4) and suspended in electroporation medium at a concentration of 5 × 107 ml–1. 0.45 ml of cells were mixed with 0.1 ml of linearized DNA in a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette and subjected to two pulses with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser electroporator set at 1500 V and 25 microfarads. Stable transformants were selected in 15 μg of G418 ml–1, 50 μg of hygromycin ml–1, and 2.5 μg of phleomycin ml–1. After drug-resistant pooled lines were established, clonal lines were obtained by limiting dilution.RNA Interference (RNAi)—RNAi experiments were performed using the vector p2T7Ti (23LaCount D.J. Bruse S. Hill K.L. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), which allows for stable tetracycline-inducible expression of double-stranded RNA from T7 promoters in procyclic T. brucei 29-13 cells. 500- and 1000-bp fragments extending downstream from the initiator methionine codon of the TbTS open reading frame were PCR-amplified using the following primers: Tb oligonucleotide 14 (5′-ATGGAGCTCCAGCAACA-3′) and Tb oligonucleotide 15 (5′-TATTTAGCAACGGTGTCGGTG-3′) for the 500-bp fragment and Tb oligonucleotide 14 and Tb oligonucleotide 16 (5′-GCTCATCAGCAGTTTCCCATTCCAC-3′) for the 1000-bp fragment. The PCR-amplified fragments were cloned into pGEM-T easy (Promega), digested with XbaI, and subcloned into XbaI-digested p2T7Ti/GFP to give p2T7Ti/500 bp and p2T7Ti/1000 bp.The open reading frame of TbSA C was amplified using primers TbSA C NH (5′-ATAGCTAGCATGGCATCCTACATGT-3′) and TbSA C stop (5′-TATAGATCTCTATGCTGACAGTAAC-3′) and cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (pGEM-TbSA C). A fragment of 615 bp of the TbSA C open reading frame was excised with EcoRI and BamHI from pGEM-TbSA C and ligated into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pTrcHisC. The resulting plasmid was digested with HindIII and BamHI, and the fragment was subcloned into HindIII/BamHI-digested p2T7Ti, yielding p2T7Ti/TbSA C.The open reading frame of TbSA B was amplified using primers TbSA B 1 (5′-GCTAGCATGAAGCGCCTGCCTGTACG-3′) and TbSA B stop (5′-TATAGATCTTCAGATTATAGTAGAATC-3′) and cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (pGEM-TbSA B). A fragment of 850 bp of the TbSA B open reading frame was obtained by digestion of pGEM-TbSA B with BglII and PstI and was subcloned into pTrcHisC. The resulting plasmid was digested with BamHI and HindIII, and the fragment containing a partial sequence of TbSA B was ligated into the corresponding sites of p2T7Ti, yielding p2T7Ti/TbSA B.Plasmids p2T7Ti/GFPc, p2T7Ti/TbTSc, p2T7Ti/TbSA Bc, and p2T7Ti/TbSA Cc were generated by deleting the tetracycline operator regions from p2T7Ti/GFP and replacing the GFP gene by the XbaI-digested fragments of TbTS or HinDIII/BamHI-digested fragments of TbSA B and TbSA C, respectively. The tetracycline operator regions were excised with BglII, and the resulting DNA fragments were ligated back together.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from 2 to 20 × 107 cells (cultures non-induced or tetracycline-induced for 48 h) using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) method according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration was determined by UV spectrophotometry at 260 nm, and RNA quality was confirmed by gel analysis.For the Northern blots, 20 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on formaldehyde-agarose gels (1%) and transferred by capillary action onto Zeta Probe nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). After cross-linking, membranes were blocked in hybridization buffer (0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% bovine serum albumin) for 4 h at 60 °C and hybridized with radio-active probes for 18 h at 62 °C. DNA probes were synthesized by PCR in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. Membranes were washed once for 20 min in 1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 62 °C and twice for 15 min in 0.5× SSC containing 0.1% SDS.The TbTS probe was made with oligonucleotides 3endup3 (5′-ATGGTGTGAGTTGGCATTT-3′, forward) and STOP (5′-GTCAAATCGCCAACACATACAT-3′, reverse). The TbTS C probe was made with oligonucleotides TbSA C 2400 (5′-TGCCGTTTTTGAAATTCACACC-3′) and TbSA C 2600 (5′-TAAACGAAAATCGGGCCACACA-3′). The TbTSA B probe was made with oligonucleotides TbSA B primer NH (5′-GCTAGCATGAAGCGCCTGCCTGTACG-3′) and primer 270 (5′-TTTTCCAACTGCCCTTTTCC-3′). The TbSA B′ probe was made with oligonucleotides B3 UTR (5′-TTCAAAACCCCTATCGTACTGC-3′, forward) and B 3UTR (5′-ACAGCAGCGGATACACCAAC-3′, reverse). The tubulin probe was made with oligonucleotides tubulin (5′-CTCCATCATCCCATCCCCCAA-3′, forward) and tubulin (5′-GAGGACTTGATGTTGTTCGGG-3′, reverse).Cloning of the TbSA C 5′- and 3′-UTRs—RNA was purified using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. To obtain the 5′-UTR sequence, first-strand cDNA was prepared with the Superscript II system using an internal primer (5′-CACACTTAAGCATCCCCTCGT-3′) of TbSA C. Reverse transcription-PCR was carried out with Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and primers for the T. brucei 39-nucleotide 5′-spliced leader sequence as forward (5′-AACGCTATTATTAGAACAGTTTCTGTACT-3′) and the one used for first-strand synthesis as reverse. To obtain the 3′-UTR sequence, reverse transcription-PCR was performed with Superscript II (Invitrogen) using the oligonucleotide anchor-(dT)18 (5′-GCGACTCCGCGGCCGCG(T)18-3′). PCR was conducted on the first-strand product using the anchor-(dT)18 as the reverse primer. The forward primer was 5′-TACTTTACCTGTTGATGGGTCT-3′. All PCR products were cloned in pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and sequenced using the dideoxychain termination method with Sequenase (USB Corp.).Expression of Sialidase Genes in Bacteria and Protein Purification—In preparation for producing active recombinant proteins, we analyzed TbSA B, TbSA C, and TbTSsh using the iPSORT program (Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Tokyo) for predicting the existence of a signal peptide. We also examined the primary sequences of their C-terminal domains to predict the existence of trans-membrane regions. Inserts were designed to encode all of the predicted recombinant proteins for these genes.Plasmids containing the open reading frames of TbSA B and TbSA C (pGEM-TbSA B and pGEM-TbSA C, respectively; see above) were cut with BglII and NheI, and the DNA fragments corresponding to the genes were ligated into expression vector pTrcHis C (Invitrogen). TbSA B constructs starting at three alternative codons and ending at two alternative stop codons were obtained by PCR on the pGEM-TbSA B plasmid using the following primers: TbSA B NH (5′-GCTAGCATGAAGCGCCTGCCTGTACG-3′; NheI restriction site is underlined), TbSABMa(5′-CGCGCTAGCTACTGCTGTGACCTGGTGTCCT-3′), TbSA B 14 (5′-GGTGCTAGCCTTTCTCAGAGGAGCAAA-3′), TbSA B stop TM (5′-TATAGATCTCTAGTCCCCTTCACAATACATC-3′; BglII restriction site is underlined), and TbSA B STOP16 (5′-TATAGATCTTCAGATTATAGTAGAATC-3′).A TbSA C construct starting at the codon for lysine 24 was obtained by PCR on the pGEM-TbSA C plasmid using the primers TbSA C ma (5′-GAGGCTAGCAAAGAAGGTACTAC-3′; NheI restriction site is underlined) and TbSA C STOP (5′-TATAGATCTCTATGCTGACAGTAAC-3′; BglII restriction site is underlined).For the TbTS sh gene starting at the leucine 28 codon, the primers were LTSK (5′-TATGCTAGCTTGACTTCCAAGGCTGCGG-3′; NheI restriction site is underlined) and TbTS sh STOP (5′-AGATCTTTAGTACACCATCACGAGTTGC-3′; BglII restriction site is underlined).After digestion with the corresponding restriction enzymes, the fragments were ligated in the pTrcHisC vector. The His tag encoded in the plasmid vector was used to purify protein. The constructs were introduced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells by the calcium chloride method. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:50 in Terrific Broth and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8–1.0 with constant agitation at 250 revolutions/min. Bacteria were induced to overexpress recombinant proteins by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl thio-α-d-galactoside (Sigma), and induction was maintained at 18 °C for 12–16 h. Cells were harvested, washed with NaCl/Tris (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, and 50 mm NaCl), and frozen (–80 °C) until needed. After thawing, lysis was carried out in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 30 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg of DNase I ml–1.Supernatants were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 30 min and subjected to iminodiacetic metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) (Hitrap Chelating, Amersham Biosciences AB) via Ni2+-charged equilibration in 20 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, and 0.5 m NaCl (buffer IMAC). The column was washed with 30 mm imidazole in buffer IMAC. Elution was achieved using a linear gradient of 30–250 mm imidazole in buffer IMAC.Site-directed Mutagenesis and Mutant Protein Purification—Site-directed point mutagenesis was performed by amplifying the pTrcHisC vector containing the TbTS gene starting at the codon for leucine 28 (16Montagna G. Cremona M.L. Paris G. Amaya M.F. Alzari P.M. Frasch A.C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2941-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with primers YW forward (5′-CAATGTCACGAAGGGGTGGTGCACAACGAAAACAAGG-3′) and YW reverse (5′-CGTTGTTTTCGTTGTGCCACCACCCCTTCGTGACATTG-3′).The PCR product was digested with DpnI, purified, cloned, and introduced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Clones were sequenced to confirm the mutation of target sites.The mutant and the wild-type TbTS recombinant proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified by IMAC (see previous section). After IMAC purification, the activity peak was pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm Bistris, pH 7.4, and further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography anion exchange (Mono Q) equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein was eluted by applying a linear gradient of 0–250 mm trisodium citrate. Purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, stained with Coomassie Blue R250, and quantified with Kodak one-dimensional version 3.0 software using purified bovine serum albumin as the standard.GPI-PLD Treatment—For GPI-PLD digestion, 5 × 106 T. brucei procyclic cells were osmotically lysed and the membrane fractions were incubated with GPI-PLD (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) at a concentration of ∼5 units ml–1 for 4 h at 37 °Cin100 μl of buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, NaOH, pH 7) in the presence of 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (24Low M.G. Huang K.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).Enzyme Activity Assays—Neuraminidase activity was determined by measuring the fluorescence of 4-methylumbiliferone released by the hydrolysis of 0.2 mm 2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNen5Ac, Sigma). The assay was performed in 50 μl in 20 mm Pipes, pH 6.9. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by dilution in 0.2 m sodium carbonate, pH 10, and fluorescence was measured with a DYNAQuant TM 200 fluorometer (Hoefer Pharmacia, Inc). Trans-sialidase activity was measured in 20 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, using 1 mm Neu5Ac-α-(2–3)-lactose as the sialic acid donor and 12 μm [d-glucose-1-14C]lactose (55 mCi mol–1) (Amersham Biosciences) as the acceptor in a 30-μl final volume at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by dilution, and sialyl-[14C]lactose was quantified with a β-scintillation counter as previously described (25Buschiazzo A. Frasch A.C.C. Campetella O. Cell. Mol. Biol. (Noisy-Le-Grand). 1996; 42: 703-710PubMed Google Scholar).Sialic Acid Determination—The total amount of sialic acid in procyclic parasites was determined after hydrolysis in 0.1 m HCl for 1 h at 80 °C using the thiobarbituric acid method and high pressure liquid chromatography analysis (26Powell L.D. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).RESULTSIdentification of Genes Coding for Trypanosomal trans-Sialidase-like Proteins—BLAST searches were performed using sequences corresponding to the catalytic domain of TbTS (AF 310232.1, a T. brucei trans-sialidase) in the T. brucei Genome Data Base (Sanger Centre). The search identified seven T. brucei open reading frames with a blast E value between 1 × 10–167 and 0.20. These open reading frames (Fig. 1) were named TbTS for T. brucei trans-sialidase, TbTSsh for a truncated version of TbTS, TbSA B and C for putative T. brucei sialidases B and C, and genes D1, D2, and E (which have much less identity to TbTS, so their products were named TbTS-like proteins). Most of these genes are present as a single copy in the T. brucei Genome Data Base, except TbSA C, which is present in two tandem copies. The differences in these copies are localized in 38 positions. Various sialidase amino acid motifs, such as the FRIP and Asp box motifs, are conserved in the deduced primary structures of proteins encoded by these TbTS family genes (Fig. 1). The six putative non-TbTS proteins have different levels of identity to TbTS. The catalytic regions of TbSA B and TbSA C are 49 and 46% identical, respectively, to the catalytic domain of TbTS. These two proteins have most of the structurally relevant residues displayed in trypanosomal trans-sialidase, including the essential amino acid residues Pro-283 and Tyr-342 (amino acid positions are those of TcTS; see Fig. 2). Point mutations at these positions of TcTS and TbTS completely abolished both sialidase and trans-sialidase activities (16Montagna G. Cremona M.L. Paris G. Amaya M.F. Alzari P.M. Frasch A.C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2941-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Paris G. Ratier L. Amaya M.F. Nguyen T. Alzari P.M. Frasch A.C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 923-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, each of these two putative trans-sialidases has a natural mutation in different positions that is relevant for enzymatic activity (Fig. 2). TbSA B has a conserved tyrosine residue in position 224, which is a structural homolog of Tyr-119 of TcTS, whereas TbSA C has a tryptophan residue at this position (Trp-170). This tyrosine residue was found to have a crucial role in the transfer reaction in both T. cruzi and T. brucei trans-sialidases (16Montagna G. Cremona M.L. Paris G. Amaya M.F. Alzari P.M. Frasch A.C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2941-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Buschiazzo A. Tavares G.A. Campetella O. Spinelli S. Cremona M.L. Paris G. Amaya M.F. Frasch A.C.C.

Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). On the other hand, TbSA C has a conserved tryptophan residue in position 372, which is equivalent to Trp-312 of TcTS, whereas TbSA B has a phenylalanine residue in this position (Phe-421). The exposed aromatic side chain of this tryptophan favors, in the case of microbial sialidases and trans-sialidases, the high specificity for sialyl-α-(2, 3) substrates (11Buschiazzo A. Amaya M.F. Cremona M.L. Frasch A.A.C. Alzari P.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Critical amino acid residues are not present in the catalytic domains of deduced sequences coded by the D1, D2, and E genes. The TbTS family genes encode the partially conserved subterminal VTVXNVFLYNR motif (shown in Fig. 1) that, in the case of T. cruzi, defines the trypanosome trans-sialidase/sialidase superfamily of surface proteins. Finally, the deduced protein of the truncated TbTSsh gene has 93% identity to the catalytic domain of TbTS, but codon 428 is a stop codon; therefore, the lectin domain is missing. This protein might not be able to properly fold and may lack enzymatic activity (16Montagna G. Cremona M.L. Paris G. Amaya M.F. Alzari P.M. Frasch A.C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2941-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We tested TbSA B, TbSA C, and TbTSsh products for enzymatic activities (see “Experimental Procedures”). None of constructs displayed sialidase/trans-sialidase activity when expressed in bacteria (data not shown).FIGURE 2Conserved amino acids among trypanosomal sialidases and trans-sialidases.

https://openalex.org/W2042977438,"Platelet activation by collagen relies on the interaction of the receptor glycoprotein VI (GPV121313132) with collagen helices. We have previously generated two recombinant single chain human antibodies (scFvs) to human GPVI. The first, 10B12, binds to the collagen-binding site on the apical surface between the two immunoglobulin-like domains (D1D2) of the receptor and so directly inhibits GPVI function. The second, 1C3, binds D1D2 independently of 10B12 and has been shown to have a more subtle effect on platelet responses to collagen. Here we have shown that 1C3 potentiates the effect of 10B12 on platelet aggregation induced by collagen and cross-linked collagen-related peptide (CRP-XL). We investigated this by measuring the effect of both scFvs on the binding of D1D2 to immobilized collagen and CRP. As expected, 10B12 completely inhibited binding of GPVI to each ligand in a dose-dependent manner. However, 1C3 inhibited only a proportion of GPVI binding to its ligands, implying that it interferes with another aspect of ligand recognition by GPVI. To further understand the mode of inhibition, we used a unique set of CRPs in which the content of critical glycine-proline-hydroxyproline (GPO) triplets was varied in relation to an “inert” scaffold sequence of GPP motifs. We observed that a stepwise increase in D1D2 binding with (GPO)2 content was blocked by 1C3. Together these results indicate that 1C3 inhibits clustering of the immunoglobulin-like domains of GPVI on collagen/CRPs, a conclusion that is supported by mapping the 1C3 epitope to the region including isoleucine 148 in D2.

This interaction strengthens platelet adhesion through activation of integrins α2β1 and αIIbβ3 (1Kuijpers M.J. Schulte V. Bergmeier W. Lindhout T. Brakebusch C. Offermanns S. Fassler R.

Hence, elucidation of the mechanism of interaction of GPVI with collagen is valuable for developing effective platelet antagonists. We have identified the primary collagen binding surface of human GPVI on the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains (D1D2) of the receptor by comparing binding of human and mouse recombinant monomeric D1D2 to a synthetic collagen-related peptide (CRP) that contains ten glycine-proline-hydroxyproline (GPO) repeats in each strand of a triple helix (3O'Connor M.N.

Prolyl hydroxylation is necessary for recognition of collagen and such peptides by platelet GPVI (5Perret S. Eble J.A. Siljander P.R. Merle C. Farndale R.W. Theisen M. Ruggiero F. J. Biol.

Both mouse and human D1D2 showed specific, dose-dependent, and saturable binding to CRP, relative to peptide GPP10, a peptide of similar structure in which hydroxyproline is replaced by proline. Using such peptides, the minimum recognition motif for GPVI has recently been identified as a tandem GPO triplet or (GPO)2. 3P. A. Smethurst, D. J. Onley, G. E. Jarvis, M. N. O'Connor, C. G.

Using human recombinant D1D2 as bait, two scFvs were selected that bind to distinct epitopes on GPVI. 10B12 recognizes the primary collagen binding surface of human GPVI, and 1C3 does not (4Smethurst P.A. Joutsi-Korhonen L. O'Connor M.N. Wilson E. Jennings N.S. Garner S.F. Zhang Y. Knight C.G. Dafforn T.R. Buckle A. IJsseldijk M.J. De Groot P.G. Watkins N.A. Farndale R.W. Ouwehand W.H. Blood. 2004; 103: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The 1C3 epitope in GPVI is as yet unknown but is conserved between human and mouse GPVI. 10B12 has been shown to inhibit collagen-induced platelet aggregation and prevent thrombus formation in vitro on a collagen-coated surface in whole blood perfusion (4Smethurst P.A. Joutsi-Korhonen L. O'Connor M.N. Wilson E. Jennings N.S. Garner S.F. Zhang Y. Knight C.G. Dafforn T.R. Buckle A. IJsseldijk M.J. De Groot P.G. Watkins N.A. Farndale R.W. Ouwehand W.H. Blood. 2004; 103: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The effect of 1C3 on thrombus formation by human platelets under flow has also been investigated, where 1C3 was shown to alter neither the surface coverage nor the size and morphology of the thrombi formed on a collagen-coated surface. However, 1C3 halved the expression of phosphatidylserine on adherent platelets (7Siljander P.R. Munnix I.C. Smethurst P.A. Deckmyn H. Lindhout T. Ouwehand W.H. Farndale R.W. Heemskerk J.W. Blood. 2004; 103: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), leading us to conclude that 1C3 perturbs the function of GPVI indirectly, prompting the current investigation. In this study the scFvs 10B12 and 1C3 are shown to have an additive inhibitory effect on collagen-induced platelet aggregation. The mode of receptor blockade conferred by 1C3 was investigated by measuring its effect on the binding of D1D2 to collagen and to synthetic collagen-like peptides. Also, evidence is presented that locates the epitope of the antibody to a surface of the molecule distinct from the primary collagen-binding site, providing an explanation for the biological effects of the antibody. Materials—The anti-GPVI scFvs 10B12 and 1C3 were selected and characterized as described previously from human V gene phage display libraries (4Smethurst P.A. Joutsi-Korhonen L. O'Connor M.N.

Horm collagen is a preparation of fibrillar type I collagen from equine tendon (Nycomed, Munich, Germany).

To detect D1D2 binding to its ligands N9A was conjugated to peroxidase to give HRP-N9A. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE, and quantitation was performed using a BCA assay (Pierce). Platelet Aggregometry—Citrate-anticoagulated whole blood was obtained from normal blood donors (National Blood Service, Cambridge, England) homozygous for the common allele (SKTQH) of the GP6 gene (14Watkins N.A. O'Connor M.N. Rankin A. Jennings N. Wilson E. Harmer I.J. Davies L. Smethurst P.A. Dudbridge F. Farndale R.W. Ouwehand W.H. J. Thromb.

Preparation of Monomeric and Dimeric scFvs—scFvs were expressed with c-Myc and hexahistidine affinity tags as previously described (16Watkins N.A. Brown C. Hurd C. Navarrete C. Ouwehand W.H. Tissue Antigens. 2000; 55: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and purified using a Ni2+-charged HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions with 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6-7.9, as the base buffer, eluting with 275 mm imidazole. This eluate contained a mixture of monomeric and dimeric (≤5%) forms of each scFv. The latter species of 60 kDa likely represents a 1C3 diabody with two identical juxtaposed antigen-binding sites separated by 65 Å (17Perisic O. Webb P.A. Holliger P. Winter G. Williams R.L. Structure. 1994; 2: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). After concentration (Vivaspin 10kDa; Vivascience) the scFvs were subjected to gel filtration (Superose 12; Amersham Biosciences GE Healthcare) into 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, to desalt and separate the two forms. These were kept on ice and used without delay to minimize re-equilibration. Ligand Binding Assay for D1D2—Binding of D1D2 to collagen or collagen-related peptides was measured in a solid phase assay as previously described (4Smethurst P.A. Joutsi-Korhonen L. O'Connor M.N. Wilson E. Jennings N.S. Garner S.F. Zhang Y. Knight C.G. Dafforn T.R. Buckle A. IJsseldijk M.J. De Groot P.G. Watkins N.A. Farndale R.W. Ouwehand W.H. Blood. 2004; 103: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, collagen or peptides were immobilized on 96-well Maxisorp™ microplates (Invitrogen). Equal coating of each peptide (GPP10, GPO2-GPO6, monomeric CRP) was ensured by measuring, in a separate experiment, the fluorescent signal obtained after derivatization of free cysteines of the peptides with Alexa 488-maleimide (Molecular Probes). 4P. A. Smethurst, personal observations. Then, after appropriate blocking and washing, the binding of D1D2 was detected with HRP-N9A using a standard peroxidase substrate on a plate reader at 450 nm. Values for nonspecific binding to blocked wells (typically less than 0.06 absorbance units) were subtracted from other readings before analysis. Data were analyzed and graphs were produced in PRISM (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Inhibition Assay—The inhibition assay protocol is a modification of the standard ligand binding assay, with the addition of the following steps. A subsaturating concentration of D1D2 was preincubated in assay buffer either without any scFv or peptide (positive control of 100% binding) or in the presence of increasing concentrations of scFv or peptide for 2 h at room temperature before adding to the plate. Assay buffer was added to the remaining wells (negative control of 0% binding), and the plate was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Bound D1D2 was detected as for the standard ligand binding assay. Specific binding was obtained by subtracting nonspecific binding (to the plate and/or BSA) from total binding. Site-directed Mutagenesis of D1D2—Site-specific mutations were introduced into D1D2 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), essentially following the manufacturer's instructions and as described previously (4Smethurst P.A. Joutsi-Korhonen L. O'Connor M.N. Wilson E. Jennings N.S. Garner S.F. Zhang Y. Knight C.G. Dafforn T.R. Buckle A. IJsseldijk M.J. De Groot P.G. Watkins N.A. Farndale R.W. Ouwehand W.H. Blood. 2004; 103: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Residues Tyr-134 and Ile-148 were mutated individually to alanine using the following primer pairs: 5′-GAAGGGGACCCTGCGCCCGCCAAGAATCCCGAGAGATGG-3′ and 5′-CCATCTCTCGGGATTCTTGGCGGGCGCAGGGTCCCCTTC-3′ for Y134A, 5′-CGGGCTAGTTTCCCCATCGCCACGGTGACCGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCGGTCACCGTGGCGATGGGGAAACTAGCCCG-3′ for I148A. Capture ELISA—The effect of the single amino acid mutations on binding of D1D2 to the anti-GPVI scFvs 10B12 and 1C3 was investigated by ELISA. D1D2 mutants were captured via the calmodulin tag to BSA-N9A in the presence of Ca2+ and binding of the scFvs detected with an HRP-labeled mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc (clone 9E10; Roche Applied Science) as described previously (4Smethurst P.A. Joutsi-Korhonen L. O'Connor M.N. Wilson E. Jennings N.S. Garner S.F. Zhang Y. Knight C.G. Dafforn T.R. Buckle A. IJsseldijk M.J. De Groot P.G. Watkins N.A. Farndale R.W. Ouwehand W.H. Blood. 2004; 103: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Structural Analysis of GPVI—The locations of Ile-148 and Tyr-134 on the surface of GPVI were determined using the crystal structure of the collagen-binding domains of GPVI (18Horii K. Kahn M.L. Herr A.B. Blood. 2006; 108: 936-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Prediction of likely protein interaction interfaces on the surface of GPVI was carried out using the Sppider web server (sppider.cchmc.org), which classifies amino acid residues based on their probability of forming protein interaction sites. 5A. Porollo and J. Meller, submitted for publication. The SPPI-DER1 algorithm was used, with the threshold value corresponding to the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity set to either 0.5 (the default value) or 0.7 (higher specificity). At both settings, Sppider identified a prominent patch of residues on the side of D2 adjacent to Ile-148 as a probable interaction site. Images were generated using PyMOL (20DeLano W.L. The PyMOL User's Manual. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). scFv 1C3 Potentiates 10B12 Inhibition of Platelet Aggregation Evoked by Collagen and CRP-XL—After separating the two forms of each scFv, the monomeric forms were used in these aggregation assays. The dose-dependent inhibitory effect of 10B12 can clearly be seen, whereas preincubation with 1C3 at 20 μg/ml (a saturating dose as judged by flow cytometry, data not shown) had very little effect on the rate or extent of platelet aggregation induced by CRP-XL and fibrillar collagen (Fig. 1). However, when 1C3 was applied in combination with 10B12, the inhibitory effect was more pronounced than with 10B12 alone, particularly in response to fibrillar collagen (Fig. 1). scFv 1C3 Partially Inhibits Binding of D1D2 to Collagen and CRP-XL in a Plate Assay—The molecular basis for the above observation was investigated by measuring the effect of monomeric and dimeric 10B12 and 1C3 on binding of D1D2 to immobilized CRP-XL and fibrillar collagen by the ligand binding assay. In each experiment, a subsaturating concentration of D1D2 (3 μg/ml) was preincubated with increasing concentrations of scFv before addition to the coated plate. As expected, binding of D1D2 to CRP or collagen was completely abolished by 10B12 in monomeric or dimeric form (Fig. 2, B and D). In contrast, the effect of 1C3 was markedly different depending on its valency. The bivalent 1C3 dimer dramatically increased binding of D1D2 to both ligands (Fig. 2, A and C), whereas monomeric 1C3 partially inhibited binding (Fig. 2, B and D). The extent of inhibition was greater with CRP as the ligand (maximum effect ∼80%) than with collagen (∼50%). This partial inhibition was nevertheless dose dependent and consistent with the dose range observed previously for binding to D1D2 by ELISA (4Smethurst P.A. Joutsi-Korhonen L. O'Connor M.N. Wilson E. Jennings N.S. Garner S.F. Zhang Y. Knight C.G. Dafforn T.R. Buckle A. IJsseldijk M.J. De Groot P.G. Watkins N.A. Farndale R.W. Ouwehand W.H. Blood. 2004; 103: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The increase in binding produced by the 1C3 dimer most likely results from the increase in avidity of the bivalent scFv, which can link two D1D2 molecules together. It demonstrates that the epitope of this antibody is remote from the primary collagen-binding site, leading to the conclusion that 1C3 inhibits an interaction of D1D2 with CRP/collagen that is separate from the primary binding interaction. scFv 1C3 Inhibits Clustering of D1D2 on Collagen-like Peptides with Increasing GPO Content—Binding of D1D2 to immobilized collagen-related peptides, GPO6, GPO4, GPO2, or the control GPP10, was measured in the ligand binding assay. Binding of D1D2 to these peptides increased relative to the GPOGPO content of each peptide as we have recently described.3 The effect of monomeric 1C3 on binding of D1D2 to peptides GPO6, GPO4, and GPO2 was then measured. A subsaturating amount of D1D2 (10 μg/ml) was preincubated with increasing concentrations of monomeric 1C3, then incubated in the peptide-coated wells, and subsequently bound D1D2 was detected. 1C3 reduced the binding of D1D2 to peptides GPO4 and GPO6 to the same level as binding to GPO2 (Fig. 3). Binding to the latter peptide was not diminished and was significantly above that to GPP10 across the range of scFv concentrations (one-way analysis of variance, p < 0.001). Hence, the direct interaction of GPVI with its minimal binding motif GPOGPO is not inhibited by scFv 1C3, whereas additional lateral clustering to adjacent motifs such as those present in peptides GPO4 and GPO6 is. Isoleucine 148 on a Side Face of GPVI Is Contained within the 1C3 Epitope—To further understand the inhibitory action of 1C3, we undertook to locate its epitope on GPVI using site-directed mutagenesis of D1D2. ScFvs 10B12 and 1C3 have been shown to bind D1D2 concurrently (4Smethurst P.A. Joutsi-Korhonen L. O'Connor M.N. Wilson E. Jennings N.S. Garner S.F. Zhang Y. Knight C.G. Dafforn T.R. Buckle A. IJsseldijk M.J. De Groot P.G. Watkins N.A. Farndale R.W. Ouwehand W.H. Blood. 2004; 103: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), indicating that 1C3 does not bind to the primary collagen binding surface recognized by 10B12, a conclusion confirmed by the data in Fig. 2. Previously published work shows that 1C3 does not bind to either Ig-like domain of GPVI when it is expressed individually, showing that both Ig-like domains are required for 1C3 binding (4Smethurst P.A. Joutsi-Korhonen L. O'Connor M.N. Wilson E. Jennings N.S. Garner S.F. Zhang Y. Knight C.G. Dafforn T.R. Buckle A. IJsseldijk M.J. De Groot P.G. Watkins N.A. Farndale R.W. Ouwehand W.H. Blood. 2004; 103: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Also, biosensor experiments conducted in our laboratory show that the lectin derivative succinylated Concanavalin A binds to D1D2 concurrently with 1C3 and 10B12.4 Hence, the 1C3 epitope does not overlap with the N-glycosylation site on D1D2 at residue Asn-72 that occupies the surface of domain 1 distal to the interdomain apex. In addition, 1C3 binds both human and mouse GPVI (4Smethurst P.A. Joutsi-Korhonen L. O'Connor M.N. Wilson E. Jennings N.S. Garner S.F. Zhang Y. Knight C.G. Dafforn T.R. Buckle A. IJsseldijk M.J. De Groot P.G. Watkins N.A. Farndale R.W. Ouwehand W.H. Blood. 2004; 103: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); therefore residues in the epitope are likely to be conserved between species. Further information on the location of the 1C3 epitope came from a commercial peptide-based epitope-scanning screen of the Ig-like domains in which a series of overlapping 15-mer peptides covering the Ig-like domains of GPVI was synthesized and immobilized by a proprietary process (Pepscan Systems, Lelystad, Netherlands) and tested for reactivity with 1C3, 10B12, and irrelevant scFvs (acting as background controls). 10B12 reacted with peptides containing residues Lys-41 and Lys-59, consistent with previous work (3O'Connor M.N. Smethurst P.A. Farndale R.W. Ouwehand W.H. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2006; 4: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 4Smethurst P.A. Joutsi-Korhonen L. O'Connor M.N. Wilson E. Jennings N.S.

Three peptides were identified as likely to contain partial epitopes for 1C3, lying between residues Ser-144 and Ser-162 in the second Ig-like domain (data not shown). In the light of the above and information obtained from modeling, we designed and expressed two further single amino acid mutants of D1D2. Binding of 1C3 to wild-type and the two novel mutated forms of D1D2 was compared by ELISA. Each construct was immobilized via its calmodulin tag, ensuring equal loading and orientation of antigen. It was observed that, whereas binding of the scFv to Y134A and to wild-type D1D2 were of similar level, binding to I148A was completely abolished (Fig. 4A). When both mutants were tested for CRP binding activity, a slightly diminished binding was observed compared with that of wild-type D1D2 (Fig. 4B). However, binding was specific compared with the control peptide GPP10 (data not shown), indicating that the decrease in binding of 1C3 was not due to a general defect in D1D2 protein structure. Activation of platelets by collagen is an important initial step in hemostasis and its pathological expression, thrombosis. GPVI is the major activating receptor on platelets for collagen and is a promising target for therapeutic intervention in athero-thrombotic diseases (21Penz S. Reininger A.J. Brandl R. Goyal P. Rabie T. Bernlochner I. Rother E. Goetz C. Engelmann B. Smethurst P.A. Ouwehand W.H. Farndale R. Nieswandt B. Siess W. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 898-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To facilitate the informed development of antagonists, it is important to understand the molecular details of the GPVI-collagen interaction. As both GPVI and collagen are insoluble, a number of molecular tools have been devised to investigate the GPVI-collagen interaction: recombinant soluble Ig-like domains of GPVI, termed D1D2, recombinant single chain variable domain antibody fragments, 10B12 and 1C3, selected on D1D2, and a series of synthetic triple-helical peptides that are structurally well defined and recognized by GPVI. The primary collagen binding surface of human GPVI has been localized in this laboratory to the apical surface of the Ig-like domains, using mutagenesis and binding studies (3O'Connor M.N.

In an independent study, non-biased in silico docking of CRP onto a 2.4 Å crystal structure of D1D2 identified the same interaction site (18Horii K. Kahn M.L. Herr A.B. Blood. 2006; 108: 936-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), confirming our earlier studies. This collagen binding surface is also the epitope of the anti-GPVI scFv, 10B12 (4Smethurst P.A. Joutsi-Korhonen L. O'Connor M.N. Wilson E. Jennings N.S. Garner S.F. Zhang Y. Knight C.G. Dafforn T.R. Buckle A. IJsseldijk M.J. De Groot P.G. Watkins N.A. Farndale R.W. Ouwehand W.H.

In this study, 1C3 alone did not produce a significant functional effect on collagen and CRP-XL-induced platelet aggregation, in line with previous data (4Smethurst P.A. Joutsi-Korhonen L.

Treatment of platelet suspensions with polymeric ligands of GPVI, such as CRP-XL or convulxin, triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of the Fc receptor γ chain and results in irreversible platelet aggregation (22Gibbins J.

Clemetson J.M. Kehrel B.E. Wiedemann M. Magnenat E.M. Wells T.N. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13576-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 25Asselin J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), leading to the conclusion that clustering of GPVI is critical for activation of the receptor. A binding mechanism involving dimeric GPVI was first proposed by Miura et al. (6Miura Y. Takahashi T. Jung S.M. Moroi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46197-46204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) who used a dimeric Fc-GPVI construct. Very recently, the docking of multiple triple helices onto a dimeric GPVI has been proposed based on structural modeling (18Horii K. Kahn M.L. Herr A.B. Blood. 2006; 108: 936-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); however, the precise mode of interaction of GPVI with collagen helices has remained biochemically uncharacterized. To address this issue and to elucidate the functional behavior of scFv 1C3, we investigated the effect of the antibody on binding of D1D2 to CRP-XL, collagen, and a series of other GPO-containing peptides (Fig. 2, B and D). In sharp contrast to the partial inhibition observed for the 1C3 monomer, the 1C3 diabody greatly enhanced binding of D1D2 to both CRP-XL and collagen (Fig. 2, A and C). This may be explained by the dimeric 1C3-D1D2 complex having enhanced avidity for its ligands, which in turn demonstrates that 1C3 does not block the primary collagen-binding site. The inhibitory action of 1C3 must therefore depend upon a different feature of the GPVI-collagen interaction. Because collagen is a complex heterogeneous molecule, for further binding studies we chose to use a series of well defined, triple-helical peptides in which the number of GPO triplets varied. By using D1D2 binding and platelet activation as readouts, the minimum GPVI binding motif has been proposed to contain two GPO triplets.3 Here it was observed that, in the presence of monomeric 1C3, binding of D1D2 to the peptides GPO4 and GPO6 was reduced to the same level as binding to peptide GPO2 (Fig. 3), providing direct evidence that 1C3 interferes with the ability of GPVI to cluster closely on these peptides. This now elucidates the effect of the antibody on D1D2 binding to its polymeric ligands, CRP-XL and collagen. Binding to CRP-XL was reduced by ∼80% in the presence of monomeric 1C3 (Fig. 2B). This is consistent with the binding of several D1D2 molecules per helix to adjacent sites in the absence of the antibody and the blockade of binding to those adjacent sites (but not the first on each helix) by 1C3. Binding to collagen is reduced by a lower proportion, ∼50% (Fig. 2D), which is also consistent with the primary structure of collagen type I, which has a maximum run of two adjacent GPOGPO triplets in both α1 and α2 chains. We conclude that, in the presence of a saturating concentration of 1C3, GPVI receptors cannot cluster on adjacent binding motifs. Because platelet activation occurs even in the presence of 1C3 (4Smethurst P.A. Joutsi-Korhonen L. O'Connor M.N. Wilson E. Jennings N.S. Garner S.F. Zhang Y. Knight C.G. Dafforn T.R. Buckle A.

Lindhout T. Ouwehand W.H. Farndale R.W. Heemskerk J.W. Blood. 2004; 103: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), this implies that binding of GPVI to non-adjacent GPOGPO triplets on the same collagen chain, or to proximal GPOGPO triplets on other chains or collagen molecules, can induce signaling, although the magnitude of the response is reduced (7Siljander P.R. Munnix I.C. Smethurst P.A. Deckmyn H. Lindhout T. Ouwehand W.H. Farndale R.W. Heemskerk J.W. Blood. 2004; 103: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To visualize the effect of 1C3 on the receptor, its epitope was mapped by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutation of D1D2 I148A abolished the ability to bind 1C3 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, another hydrophobic mutation in the same Ig-like domain, Y134A, and numerous residues in the apical surface (3O'Connor M.N. Smethurst P.A. Farndale R.W. Ouwehand W.H. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2006; 4: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 4Smethurst P.A. Joutsi-Korhonen L. O'Connor M.N. Wilson E. Jennings N.S. Garner S.F. Zhang Y. Knight C.G. Dafforn T.R.

These new mutations do not profoundly affect the structure of the protein, as they still bind specifically to CRP in a binding assay (Fig. 4B). An inspection of the position of Ile-148 in the recent structure of D1D2 (18Horii K. Kahn M.L. Herr A.B. Blood. 2006; 108: 936-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) shows that the residue is present on a side face of domain 2 and is close to a putative protein interaction interface distal from the primary collagen-binding site (Fig. 5). From this, one can envisage how 1C3 may occupy an epitope separate from that of 10B12, straddling both domains and thus interfering with docking of GPVI to adjacent GPOGPO triplets in its ligands. The work we present here using purified components will complement and inform other approaches that could be applied to study GPVI clustering, such as advanced microscopy. In conclusion, scFv 1C3 appears to be a valuable tool for distinguishing the effects of receptor clustering from direct ligand recognition on platelet activation by collagen through GPVI."

The presence of the Man-6-P post-translational modification allows these proteins to be affinity-purified on immobilized Man-6-P receptors. This approach has formed the basis for a number of proteomic studies that identified multiple as yet uncharacterized Man-6-P glycoproteins that may represent new lysosomal proteins. Although the presence of Man-6-P is suggestive of lysosomal function, the subcellular localization of such candidates requires experimental verification. Here, we have investigated one such candidate, ependymin-related protein (EPDR). EPDR is a protein of unknown function with some sequence similarity to ependymin, a fish protein thought to play a role in memory consolidation and learning. Using classical subcellular fractionation on rat brain, EPDR co-distributes with lysosomal proteins, but there is significant overlap between lysosomal and mitochondrial markers. For more definitive localization, we have developed a novel approach based upon a selective buoyant density shift of the brain lysosomes in a mutant mouse lacking NPC2, a lysosomal protein involved in lipid transport. EPDR, in parallel with lysosomal markers, shows this density shift in gradient centrifugation experiments comparing mutant and wild type mice. This approach, combined with morphological analyses, demonstrates that EPDR resides in the lysosome.

In addition, the lipidosis-induced density shift approach represents a valuable tool for identification and validation of both luminal and membrane lysosomal proteins that should be applicable to high throughput proteomic studies. Recent genomic and proteomic studies have revealed the presence of numerous previously uncharacterized proteins encoded by the mammalian genome. Determining the biological role of such proteins poses a fundamental challenge. Although sequence and structural similarities to proteins of known function may provide useful information, knowledge of the site of function is essential in understanding uncharacterized proteins. In addition to providing insight into protein function, mapping of proteins to cellular organelles or structures involved in specific biological processes may provide valuable clues to how the organelles carry out these processes. One cellular compartment that contains protein constituents of characteristic function is the lysosome, an acidic, membrane-delimited organelle present in all eukaryotic cells (1Holtzman E. Lysosomes. Plenum Press, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar). The lysosome contains over 60 soluble proteins, most of which are hydrolases that function in concert to degrade macromolecules introduced via the endocytic and autophagic pathways into simple constituents that can be reutilized by the cell. A number of recent proteomic studies investigating soluble luminal lysosomal proteins have relied upon the fact that these proteins contain an unusual carbohydrate modification that allows for their specific affinity purification. Most luminal lysosomal proteins are targeted to this organelle by the mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) 2The abbreviations used are: Man-6-P, mannose 6-phosphate; MPR, Man-6-P receptor; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; EPDR, ependymin-related protein; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. pathway. Here, N-linked glycans on newly synthesized lysosomal proteins are phosphorylated on select mannose residues, allowing binding to intracellular Man-6-P receptors (MPRs) and targeting to the lysosome. These proteins can be affinity-purified on immobilized MPRs, and this has led to the subsequent identification of many known lysosomal proteins and Man-6-P-containing glycoproteins that may represent new lysosomal candidates (2Sleat D.E.

Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 3411-3419Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The identification of new lysosomal proteins is clearly of interest in terms of cell biology. Also, their discovery has considerable biomedical importance, since deficiencies in lysosomal proteins are responsible for over 40 inherited human diseases (11Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.(eds) The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw Hill, New York2001Google Scholar). However, purification by MPR affinity chromatography, although highly suggestive, does not definitively demonstrate lysosomal localization. For example, there are a number of nonlysosomal proteins that may also receive the Man-6-P modification (4Sleat D.E. Wang Y. Sohar I. Lackland H. Li Y. Li H. Zheng H. Lobel P. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). In addition, some proteins (e.g. protease inhibitors and lectins) that do not contain Man-6-P may specifically associate and co-purify with authentic Man-6-P glycoproteins (7Sleat D.E. Lackland H. Wang Y. Sohar I. Xiao G. Li H. Lobel P. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 1520-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Finally, as in any proteomic study, as the limits of detection decrease, so does the likelihood of detecting nonspecific contaminants. Thus, there is a clear requirement for the direct experimental verification of the intracellular location of lysosomal candidate proteins identified in MPR affinity purification studies. A number of approaches can be used to investigate the subcellular location of a protein. Double label immunomicroscopy can provide relatively high resolution information but is highly dependent on experimental conditions. Importantly, after fixation, retention of a protein as well as epitope access may vary in different organelles. Thus, it is impossible to be certain if the entire population of the protein of interest is visualized. Another approach that is frequently used is the direct visualization of expressed, tagged proteins. However, a significant drawback of this approach is that overexpression and/or tagging may perturb the normal distribution of the protein. In addition, the tag may be lost in a given cellular compartment, such as the lysosome, which contains a host of proteases. Many of the respective drawbacks of these methods can be overcome by the quantitative subcellular fractionation methods pioneered by de Duve and colleagues (12de Duve C. Pressman B.C. Gianetto R. Wattiaux R. Appelmans F. Biochem. J. 1955; 60: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (2573) Google Scholar). Even so, the resolution of such approaches is limited by the overlapping physical properties of some organelles (e.g. sedimentation coefficient and/or buoyant density). One method for increasing the resolution of subcellular fractionation is to elicit a selective and diagnostic shift in the density of a given organelle. Traditionally, this has been achieved for lysosomes by injecting Triton WR-1339 into the bloodstream of rodents several days prior to tissue harvest (13Wattiaux R. Wibo M. Baudhuin P. de Reuck A.V.S. Cameron M.P. Ciba Foundation. Symposium on Lysosomes. Little, Brown and Company, Boston1963: 176-196Google Scholar). The density shift observed when comparing treated and untreated animals is specific to the lysosome and thus, for any given protein, is a hallmark of lysosomal localization. This approach is generally used in characterization of liver organelles, but intravenous injection of Triton WR-1339 does not alter the equilibrium density of brain lysosomes. 3M. Jadot, unpublished data. One study has demonstrated a shift after intrathecal injection of Triton WR-1339, but only a limited proportion of the brain lysosome population was shifted (14Sellinger O.Z. Nordrum L.M. Idoyaga-Vargas V. Brain Res. 1971; 26: 361-373PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, this approach is unlikely to prove useful in terms of validating lysosomal localization for proteins preferentially expressed in brain. One glycoprotein that has been identified in a number of Man-6-P affinity purification proteomic studies (4Sleat D.E. Wang Y. Sohar I. Lackland H. Li Y. Li H. Zheng H. Lobel P. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar, 7Sleat D.E. Lackland H. Wang Y. Sohar I. Xiao G. Li H. Lobel P. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 1520-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 8Kollmann K.

Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19191-19198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) is ependymin-related protein (EPDR). (EPDR has also been referred to as MERP (mammalian ependymin-related protein) and UCC1 (up-regulated in colorectal cancer gene 1). The human and mouse orthologs are encoded by genes EPDR1 and Epdr2, respectively. We have chosen EPDR as a general reference to the mammalian protein and indicate appropriately where more specific reference is meant.) EPDR is of unknown function, is conserved among vertebrates, and has some sequence similarity to fish ependymin, a glycoprotein proposed to be a cell adhesion molecule involved in memory consolidation and learning (reviewed in Ref. 16Schmidt R. Behav. Brain Res. 1995; 66: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The localization of EPDR has not been established, although three lines of evidence suggest that it may be lysosomal. First, the presence of Man-6-P on EPDR has been directly demonstrated, precluding the possibility that this protein represents a contaminant in MPR affinity-purified samples (5Sleat D.E. Zheng H. Qian M. Lobel P. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2006; 5: 686-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Second, a purified, Man-6-P-containing epitope-tagged derivative of EPDR is endocytosed and delivered to the lysosome by MPRs (8Kollmann K. Mutenda K.E. Balleininger M. Eckermann E. von Figura K. Schmidt B. Lubke T. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 3966-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Third, EPDR was identified as a component of a neuromelanin granule preparation, an organelle related to the lysosome (17Tribl F. Gerlach M. Marcus K. Asan E. Tatschner T. Arzberger T. Meyer H.E. Bringmann G. Riederer P. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 945-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to use orthogonal approaches to investigate the subcellular localization of endogenous EPDR in a definitive manner. Although this protein is highly expressed in brain, it is undetectable in liver; thus, the classical triton density shift approach (13Wattiaux R. Wibo M. Baudhuin P. de Reuck A.V.S. Cameron M.P. Ciba Foundation. Symposium on Lysosomes. Little, Brown and Company, Boston1963: 176-196Google Scholar) to investigate lysosomal localization is not applicable. We have therefore developed a new strategy for the subcellular localization of brain lysosomal proteins that relies on a density shift of lysosomes due to an accumulation of lipids in mice lacking NPC2, a soluble glycoprotein involved in cholesterol transport (3Naureckiene S. Sleat D.E. Lackland H. Fensom A. Vanier M.T. Wattiaux R. Jadot M. Lobel P. Science. 2000; 290: 2298-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 18Okamura N. Kiuchi S. Tamba M. Kashima T.

Using this novel method, we demonstrate unambiguously that EPDR is a lysosomal protein. In addition, we propose the lipidosis-induced density shift approach as a general method that should be widely applicable for the identification and validation of lysosomal candidates. Cloning and Expression in Pichia pastoris—The coding sequence for the mature murine EPDR was PCR-amplified from an expressed sequence tag clone (IMAGE:4223134) and subcloned into the XhoI/XbaI sites of pGAPZα A (Invitrogen). Two constructs were generated. In the first, the α factor signal sequence was present in the vector immediately followed by the amino terminus of mature murine EPDR (forward primer 1, CCGGCTCGAGAAAAGAACCCCACAGCCATGCCAGGCA; reverse primer 1, CCGGTCTAGAAGGGAGCAGCCGTCACTCATCTT). In the second, an additional Glu-Ala-Glu-Ala sequence was inserted between the α factor signal sequence and the sequence of mature murine EPDR (forward primer 2, CGGCTCGAGAAAAGAGAGGCTGAAGCTACCCCACAGCCATGCCAGGCA; reverse primer as above). Constructs were linearized using AvrII and introduced into competent P. pastoris X-33 by electroporation. Transformation, selection, and growth of P. pastoris cells was essentially as described in the proprietary pGAPZα A manual (Invitrogen). In brief, cells were selected on plates containing 100 μg/ml Zeocin (Invivogen, San Diego, CA) in YPDS medium. Colonies (∼6/construct) were grown in small scale liquid cultures, and supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen) to determine relative levels of recombinant EPDR expression. Overnight cultures (1 ml) of the clones exhibiting the highest level of expression were used to inoculate 2-liter baffle flasks (Nalgene, Rochester, NY) containing 0.4 liters of YPD growth medium and cultured for 4-5 days on a shaking incubator (250 rpm, 30 °C). Purification of Recombinant EPDR—Typically, cleared supernatants were prepared from 1 liter of P. pastoris 4-5-day culture by centrifugation at 4 °C at 4000 × g for 15 min followed by a second centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants were filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane and concentrated 10-20-fold by ultrafiltration using an Amicon stirred cell apparatus with a YM10 membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The concentrated supernatant was buffered with the addition of one-tenth volume of 10× HisTrap binding buffer (0.2 m sodium phosphate, 5 m sodium chloride, 0.2 m imidazole, pH 7.4) and filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane. The supernatant was applied at a 1 ml/min flow rate to a 1-ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated with 1× HisTrap binding buffer. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a 20-ml linear gradient of 0.02-0.5 m imidazole in 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, monitoring protein absorbance at 280 nm, and collecting 0.5-ml fractions. Fractions with the highest absorbance were pooled, concentrated, and buffer-exchanged to 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, using an Amicon Ultra (Millipore Corp.) with a 10-kDa molecular weight cut-off. Purified protein was digested for 2 h at 37°C with Endo Hf (10 units/μg of protein) (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The deglycosylated sample was buffer-exchanged as above to column equilibration buffer (125 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.5) and filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane. The sample was loaded onto a 1-ml MonoS 5/5 (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) and eluted with a mixture of column equilibration buffer and buffer B (5 m ammonium acetate, pH 4.5) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min as follows: 150-ml linear gradient of 0-30% buffer B; 30-ml linear gradient of 30-60% buffer B; 10 ml of 60% buffer B. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing recombinant EPDR protein and lacking Endo Hf were pooled, concentrated, and freeze-dried using a vacuum centrifuge. Primary Antibodies—Rabbits were immunized using purified deglycosylated recombinant EPDR (lacking the Glu-Ala-Glu-Ala sequence), and anti-EPDR antibodies were affinity-purified using recombinant EPDR immobilized on Affi-Gel-15 (Bio-Rad). Hybridoma supernatant containing mouse monoclonal anti-SV2 antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-PMP70 antibody (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) were used at a 1:1000 dilution. Western Blotting—SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was conducted using precast 10% reducing Novex bis-Tris minigels or midigels (Invitrogen). After semidry transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose, membranes were baked at 80 °C for 1 h and blocked overnight at 4 °C with PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.2% Tween 20. Blocked membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for either 3 h at 20 °C or overnight at 4 °C and washed four times for 5 min each with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20. For chemiluminescent detection, blots were incubated for 1 h at 20 °C with a 1:1000 dilution of a goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and visualized using the Super-Signal West Pico chemiluminescent system (Pierce). For radioisotopic detection, blots were incubated for 1 h at 20°C with a 1:1000 dilution of a goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) iodinated using IODO-GEN (Pierce) and 125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), exposed to phosphor storage screens, and scanned using a Typhoon 9400 scanner (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.). Quantitation was conducted using ImageQuant 5.2 (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.). Enzyme Assays—Differential centrifugation and gradient fractions were diluted in cold 0.15 m sodium chloride with 0.1% Triton X-100, except for the catalase assay. Glycosidase and phosphatase measurements using 4-methylumbelliferyl substrates and protease assays using amino-4-methylcoumarin substrates were conducted essentially as described previously (15Sleat D.E. Sohar I. Lackland H. Majercak J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19191-19198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The catalase assay was carried out using modifications of described methods (19Cohen G. Dembiec D. Marcus J. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 20Patel C.C. Mohan M.S. Nature. 1960; 186: 803-804Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Samples were diluted 10-300-fold in ice-cold 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% ethanol, 0.009% sodium bicarbonate, pH 7.5. Diluted samples (15 μl) were mixed with 15 μl of peroxide-free Triton X-100 (Sigma) and incubated for 1 min, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 300 μl of 3.1 mm H2O2 in 20 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The reactions were incubated for 14 h at 0 °C, terminated by mixing an aliquot with an equal volume of 0.45% titanium oxysulfate in 1 m sulfuric acid (a generous gift from Millennium Inorganic Chemicals, MA), and incubated for 10 min at 25 °C, and the absorbance was measured at 415 nm to detect the decrease in H2O2. Dilutions exhibiting 0.2-0.8 fractional consumption of hydrogen peroxide were used to calculate the rate (-log fractional consumption/time), and the values from different dilutions were averaged after correcting for the dilution factor. Alkaline phosphodiesterase activity was measured using a modification of a published method (21Young J.D. Damiano A. Leong L.G. Cohn Z.A. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 158: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 mm p-nitrophenyl thymidine-5′-monophosphate sodium salt was used as substrate in 0.1 m Tris, pH 9.0, containing 2 mm zinc acetate reaction buffer, and reactions were terminated by 0.5 m glycine, pH 10.5, and absorbance was measured at 415 nm. Cytochrome c oxidase was measured with a kinetic method (22Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 23Leighton F. Poole B. Beaufay H.

The decrease in the logarithm of absorbance at 550 nm was monitored during the first 2 min and is proportional to the activity of cytochrome c oxidase. For all assays, substrates were prepared freshly in reaction buffer or stored in Me2SO and diluted in reaction buffer before use. Fluorescence was measured with a CytoFluor 4000 multiwell plate reader (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA), and absorbance was measured with Spectra Max250 microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Protein concentrations were measured with Advanced Protein Assay reagent (Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO). Detection of Man-6-P Glycoproteins—Proteins in subcellular fractions containing Man-6-P were detected as described previously (15Sleat D.E. Sohar I. Lackland H. Majercak J. Lobel P. J. Biol.

Preparation of Mouse Tissue Extracts for Immunoblotting—Tissues were obtained from 90-day-old 129/SvEv and Balb/c mice and were frozen on dry ice immediately after dissection and stored at -80 °C prior to use. Frozen tissues were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments, Inc., Westbury, NY) in 5 volumes of extraction buffer (1× PBS, 0.2% Tween 20, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Pefabloc (Pentapharm Ltd., Basel, Switzerland), 1 mm EDTA). Homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and stored at -80 °C before use. Analytical Purification of Man-6-P Glycoproteins—Affinity purification of Man-6-P glycoproteins in mouse brain extracts to determine the proportion of each protein that contains Man-6-P was conducted essentially as described previously except that 1% Triton X-100 (instead of 0.1%) was used in the homogenization buffer (15Sleat D.E.

EPDR levels were measured by immunoblotting using a radioactive secondary antibody. Subcellular Fractionation—All experiments and procedures involving live animals were conducted in compliance with approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols. Mice (8-9-week-old female wild type or NPC2 mutant 129/SvEv animals (25Sleat D.E. Wiseman J.A. El-Banna M. Price S.M. Verot L. Shen M.M. Tint G.S. Vanier M.T. Walkley S.U. Lobel P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Animals were anesthetized using a sodium pentobarbital/sodium phenytoin mixture (Euthasol, Delmarva Laboratories, Inc., Midlothian, VA) and perfused with saline. Brains were removed, immersed in 2-3 volumes of ice-cold 0.25 m sucrose, and homogenized by three passages through a motor-driven Potter apparatus (1500 rpm). Homogenates from adult male Wistar rats (250-300 g) were prepared as described previously (26Jadot M. Lin L. Sleat D.E. Sohar I. Hsu M.S. Pintar J. Dubois F. Coninck S.W. Wattiaux-De Coninck S.

Fractionation of subcellular organelles by differential centrifugation to obtain nuclear (N), heavy mitochondrial (M), light mitochondrial (L), microsomal (P), and cytosolic (S) fractions was as described (12de Duve C. Pressman B.C. Gianetto R. Wattiaux R. Appelmans F. Biochem. J. 1955; 60: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (2573) Google Scholar). Isopycnic centrifugation was essentially as described (27Beaufay H. Jacques P. Baudhuin P. Sellinger O.Z. Berthet J. de Duve C. Biochem. J. 1964; 92: 184-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. For density gradients on rat brain, an ML fraction (combined heavy and light mitochondrial fractions) obtained from 0.28 g of tissue was layered on top of linear gradients (density limits 1.05-1.26 g/cm3) made using either sucrose or Nycodenz medium and centrifuged for 150 min at 39,000 rpm in an SW55 Ti rotor. For bottom loaded linear sucrose density gradients on mouse brain, an L (light mitochondrial) fraction corresponding to 0.1 g (wild type) or 0.4 g (NPC2 mutant) of tissue was mixed with 1.32 g/cm3 sucrose to give a density higher than that of the gradient solutions (1.26 and 1.15 g/cm3, respectively). Density limits (wild type, 1.05-1.22 g/cm3; NPC2 mutant, 1.03-1.14 g/cm3) were chosen to allow estimation of the buoyant density of the compartment containing EPDR. The tubes were centrifuged for 150 min at 40,000 rpm in an SW 50.1 rotor. For all gradients, after centrifugation, 12 fractions were collected by slicing the tubes, and densities were measured by refractometry. The samples were stored at -80 °C prior to further analysis. Immunohistochemistry—C57BL/6 wild type mice were anesthetized with CO2, perfused with saline, and then fixed with Bouin's solution. The brain was dissected and embedded in paraffin, and 10-μm coronal sections were mounted on slides coated with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (Pierce). Samples were deparaffinized, hydrated, and blocked with PBS containing 2% dried milk and 0.2% Tween 20 for 2 h. Slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer. Slides were washed three times with PBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit biotinylated secondary antibody diluted 1:400 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 2 h at 20 °C. Slides were washed three times with PBS and stained with an HRP-AEC kit (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). Immunofluorescence—Brains were fixed as above and used to prepare 25-μm coronal cryostat sections. Histological sections were probed to detect EPDR and, as a neuronal lysosomal marker, Man-6-P glycoproteins (26Jadot M. Lin L. Sleat D.E. Sohar I. Hsu M.S. Pintar J. Dubois F. Coninck S.W.

https://openalex.org/W1977415873,"The single channel properties of recombinant γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA)αβγ receptors co-expressed with the trafficking protein GABARAP were investigated using membrane patches in the outside-out patch clamp configuration from transiently transfected L929 cells. In control cells expressing αβγ receptors alone, GABA activated single channels whose main conductance was 30 picosiemens (pS) with a subconductance state of 20 pS, and increasing the GABA concentration did not alter their conductance. In contrast, when GABAA receptors were co-expressed with GABARAP, the GABA-activated single channels displayed multiple, high conductances (≥40 pS), and GABA (≥10 μm) was able to increase their conductance, up to a maximum of 60 pS. The mean open time of GABA-activated channels in control cells expressing αβγ receptors alone was 2.3 ± 0.1 ms for the main 30-pS channel and shorter for the subconductance state (20 pS, 0.8 ± 0.1 ms). Similar values were measured for the 30- and 20-pS channels active in patches from cells co-expressing GABARAP. However higher conductance channels (≥40 pS) remained open longer, irrespective of whether GABA or GABA plus diazepam activated them. Plotting mean open times against mean conductances revealed a linear relationship between these two parameters. Since high GABA concentrations increase both the maximum single channel conductance and mean open time of GABAA channels co-expressed with GABARAP, trafficking processes must influence ion channel properties. This suggests that the organization of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors may provide a range of distinct inhibitory currents in the brain and, further, provide differential drug responses.

This suggests that the organization of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors may provide a range of distinct inhibitory currents in the brain and, further, provide differential drug responses. Inhibitory signals in human brains are mediated primarily by γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) 2The abbreviations used are: GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid type A; pS, picosiemens; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid type A; pS, picosiemens; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid. receptors. These ligandgated ion channels are composed of multimembrane-spanning subunits that assemble into pentamers and function by gating a pore selective for chloride ions. The targeting and organization of GABAA receptors at specific membrane locations are critical for their normal function. For example, GABAA receptors are clustered at inhibitory synapses but are also found both clustered and nonclustered at other sites on the neuronal cell surface (1Christie S.B. Li R.W. Miralles C.P. Yang B.Y. De Blas A.L. Carland J.E. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2006; 31: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Nusser Z. Sieghart W. Somogyi P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These synaptic and nonsynaptic (extrasynaptic) sites reflect GABAA receptor involvement in both phasic and tonic signaling, respectively. The functional behavior of native GABAA receptors is complex. Much of the receptor's functional complexity has been attributed to its extensive structural heterogeneity as indicated by the 19 different genes identified to date (α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, ρ1–3, ϵ, θ, and π).Recombinant GABAA receptors are different from native GABAA receptors in that they never display single channel conductances greater than 40 pS, nor do drugs modulate their conductance, properties we and others have described for native nonsynaptic (extrasynaptic) GABAA receptors (3Curmi J.P.

We have, however, been able to mimic the behavior exhibited by neuronal extrasynaptic GABAA receptors in a recombinant system and change the dispersion of receptors in the membrane simply by co-expressing the trafficking protein GABARAP with GABAA receptors (9Everitt A.B. Luu T. Cromer B. Tierney M.L. Birnir B. Olsen R.W. Gage P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21701-21706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). GABARAP (GABAA receptor-associated protein) was originally identified because of its physical association with GABAA receptors following their isolation by immunoprecipitation from solubilized rat brain (10Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Subsequent immunolocalization data and the biochemical identification of the GABARAP interaction partners has led to the suggestion that it participates in trafficking and membrane fusion events underlying organizational processes at GABAergic synapses but does not remain associated with receptors once they are inserted at the synapse (11Kneussel M. Haverkamp S. Fuhrmann J.C. Wang H. Wassle H. Olsen R.W. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8594-8599Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In heterologous expression systems, recombinant GABARAP has been shown to promote clustering of γ subunit-containing GABAA receptors in the plasma membrane (9Everitt A.B. Luu T. Cromer B.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11557-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). As a consequence of this ordered packing arrangement, the recombinant GABAA receptors function differently from receptors expressed in the absence of GABARAP. At the macroscopic level, changes in the rates of receptor desensitization and deactivation have been reported in addition to an increase in the GABA EC50 (concentration required to elicit a half-maximal response) (12Chen L. Wang H. Vicini S. Olsen R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11557-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). At the single channel level we have shown that increased single channel conductances (≥40 pS) are associated with GABAA receptors co-expressed with GABARAP and that drugs are able to increase the conductance of these channels (9Everitt A.B. Luu T. Cromer B. Tierney M.L. Birnir B. Olsen R.W. Gage P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21701-21706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to analyze the single channel properties of GABAA receptors co-expressed with GABARAP and to see if these newly acquired properties correlated with these receptors being organized at a higher density (i.e. clustered) in the membrane. By analyzing single channel currents activated by a range of GABA concentrations, we determined single channel conductances and mean open times and identified a correlation between these two parameters. Furthermore, at saturating GABA concentrations, our data indicate that co-expression with GABARAP does indeed increase the number of receptors in a patch.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRecombinant Expression SystemMouse L929 fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in minimum essential medium containing 200 IU ml–1 penicillin and 200 μg ml–1 streptomycin and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Trace Biosciences) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air. Cells were transfected using a lipid-mediated reagent (Lipofectin; Sigma) as described in detail previously (13Luu T. Cromer B. Gage P.W. Tierney M.L. J. Membr. Biol. 2005; 205: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For the identification of successfully transfected cells, the plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP-NI; Clontech) was used in every transfection. Human α1, β1, γ2S, GABARAP, and enhanced green fluorescent protein plasmids were combined and added to the cells in equal ratios of 1:1:1:1 (α/β/γ/green fluorescent protein) or 1:1:1:1:1 (α/β/γ/GABARAP/enhanced green fluorescent protein) using 5 μgof each DNA. Cells that had bright green fluorescence were used for electrophysiological recordings between 24 and 72 h later.ElectrophysiologyDrugs—GABA, (–)-bicuculline methiodide (both purchased from Sigma), and diazepam (gift from Hoffmann-La Roche) were diluted with bath solution to the final concentration on the day of the experiment. Concentrated stocks of drugs were made up in water, except for diazepam. Diazepam (2.8 mg) was first dissolved in Me2SO (50 μl) and then diluted to 1 mm with water. In the final diazepam solution, there was less than 0.001% Me2SO. It has been published that Me2SO, at concentrations as high as 0.1%, does not activate or modulate GABAA receptors (14Benson J.A. Low K. Keist R. Mohler H. Rudolph U. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 15Williams D.B. Akabas M.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and similarly, we observe no affect of the diluent on our patch clamp recordings.Recording Solutions and Techniques—Standard outside-out patching techniques (16Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15094) Google Scholar) were used to record currents. External recording medium (bath solution) contained the following 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-ethanesulfonic acid (pH 7.4). The intrapipette solution contained 50 mm NaCl, 80 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm TES (pH 7.3). This combination of bath and intrapipette solution produced a chloride equilibrium potential (17Oliveras J.L. Montagneclavel J. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 179: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) of approximately –1.8 mV, whereas the equilibrium potentials for sodium and potassium were +19 and –70 mV, respectively. Patch pipettes were made using borosilicate glass capillaries (1.5-mm OD × 0.86-mm ID) fabricated on a pipette puller (Sutter Instruments Co.) and subsequently fire-polished and coated with Sylgard (Dow Corning) before use. Patch pipette resistances ranged from 10 to 20 MΩ for single channel recordings when filled with the pipette solution and immersed in bath solution. Drugs were applied via gravity-fed flow tubes and placed directly in front of the patch by lateral movement of the flow tube using a hydraulic micromanipulator. Data from two or more separate transfections were pooled for analysis. All recordings were carried out at room temperature (20–22 °C). Currents were monitored with an Axopatch 200A amplifier, filtered at 5 kHz (3 dB, 4-pole Bessel; Axon Instruments) and directly recorded onto the computer (Axoscope7; ADC: digidata board 1200; Axon Instruments) sampling at either 10 or 20 kHz.Analysis of Currents—All single channel currents were analyzed using in-house software, CHANNEL 2 (written by M. Smith and P. W. Gage). Statistical analyses were performed using Excel (Microsoft). To compare sample means, paired or unpaired, a twotailed t test, not assuming equal variance, was used. A critical value of p < 0.05 was used to define statistical significance.Single Channel Analysis—All single channel recordings were performed at a holding potential of –60 mV using the outside-out patch clamp technique. Before analysis, the recordings were filtered at 2 kHz using the program CHANNEL 2, unless specified (e.g. mean open times). Single channel current amplitudes were measured directly and were only accepted as valid events if their open duration was at least 0.3 ms (i.e. 3 times the sampling rate). Amplitude histograms were then constructed using more than 500 openings in which the bin widths were 0.06 pA, and these were subsequently fitted to the sum of Gaussian components (Equation 1) using least-squares minimization. The number of Gaussian components required to fit the histogram was determined by the criteria set out by Horn (18Horn R. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 255-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The Gaussian function (g(I)) used to fit an amplitude frequency histogram was as follows.g(I)=A1e−0.5(I−m1s1)2+A2e−0.5(I−m2s2)2+…+Ane−0.5(I−mnsn)2(Eq. 1) Single Channel Peak Current—In outside-out patches, the rapid application of high GABA concentrations ([GABA]) invariably induced overlapping single channel openings whose maximum peak current was reached within 20 ms of the application. The single channel peak current for each [GABA] (1, 10, 100, and 1000 μm) was therefore determined as the peak amplitude of the current induced within the first 20 ms. The mean peak current was obtained by pooling data from three or more experiments.Single Channel Mean Open Time—Unfiltered segments of typical single channel data were used for analysis only if simultaneous openings were rare or accounted for less than 1% of the total number of channel openings sampled. Using a program available in CHANNEL 2, the single channel amplitudes and their corresponding open duration can be measured automatically, after an “open” and “closed” threshold has been set. To determine the open time of single channel events that were ≤40 pS, the open and closed thresholds were set at half the amplitude of the smallest single channel conductance, typically 20 pS; hence, the threshold was set at 10 pS. At a holding potential of –60 mV, this threshold was set at 0.6 pA. Using the same criteria to determine the open time of single channel events that had conductances greater than 40 pS, the open and closed thresholds were set at 1.2 pA. In single channel recordings that exhibited both high and low single channel conductance events, the open times of these channel events were sampled twice. The first round was to collect the open times of the low conducting channels (≤40 pS), and the second was for the high conducting channels (>40 pS). This procedure was done because it was found that a number of the high conducting channels had brief closures (it was considered a closed event when the channel closed more than half the amplitude of that channel opening). These closures, however, did not cross the “lower” closed threshold set at 0.6 pA and was therefore deemed to be a single open event by the analysis program. Under these conditions, the mean open time of the higher conducting channels was biased toward longer times.For each record, the single channel amplitude data set generated was used to construct an amplitude frequency histogram, and this was fitted with sum of Gaussians to determine the most frequently occurring single channel conductances. The resolved conductances determined from the histogram were confirmed by checking their presence in the single channel recordings. Subsequently, the open times were determined by taking the average of the open times of those amplitudes that were between two S.D. values below and above the mean of that Gaussian component. This was performed for each of the conductance levels that were resolved. The mean open time of each conductance state was derived from pooling three or more experiments that exhibited a particular conductance state.Probability of Simultaneous, Independent Channel Openings— To determine whether high conductance channels could be due to the random simultaneous openings of independent channels, the probability of observing rapid transitions between the closed level and Imax (maximum single channel current) were calculated. We calculated whether the 60-pS conductances were due to the simultaneous openings of two 30-pS independent channel openings, because the 30-pS channels account for more than 50% of all opening events (Table 1). Furthermore, the low frequencies of the 20- and 40-pS channels make their random participation in generating a 60-pS channel less likely.TABLE 1Observed fast transitions and predicted probability of two independent simultaneous channel openingsPatchConductanceTrx1x2Observed Pr of x2Predicted Pr (s = 2)S.D.ZppSpSpSpSpSP156 (16)37 (8)31 (27)25 (50)75,0004521350.00185 × 10-52 × 10-570.6<6 × 10-16P261 (22)49 (12)33 (24)22 (6)75,0001884840.00641 × 10-44 × 10-5159.2<6 × 10-16P357 (15)48 (26)31 (59)75,00010903950.00523 × 10-46 × 10-576.5<6 × 10-16P458 (9)51 (19)32 (50)23 (22)75,00017114210.00566 × 10-49 × 10-557.3<6 × 10-16P556 (6)46 (2)28 (68)19 (24)87,50015181090.00122 × 10-45 × 10-522.1<6 × 10-16When Z = 86 × 10-16 Open table in a new tab The probability of n independent channels opening simultaneously can be examined by a binomial distribution (Equation 2). Such methodology has been described by Sakmann and Neher (19Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-channel Recording. 1st Ed. Plenum Press, New York1983: 163Google Scholar).Pr(s)=n!s!(n−s)!po2(1−po)n−s(Eq. 2) The probability that two channels open simultaneously (s = 2) thus becomes the following.Pr(s=2)=n!2!(n−2)!po2(1−po)n−2=n(n−1)2po2(1−po)n−2 Since (1 – po)n–2 < 1, thenPr(s=2)<n(n−1)2po2 Since n2 – n < n2, then the following is truePr(s=2)<(npo)22(Eq. 5) From our single channel recordings, npo can be calculated as follows.nPo=x1+2x2Tr where x1 is the number of 30-pS channel openings, x2 is the number of 60-pS channel openings, and Tr is the number of rapid transition periods in that particular recording.Single channels go from the closed state to an open state in a very short space of time. With our current sampling resolution, one point per 100 μs (10 kHz), we have found that channels take less than four points to go from a closed state to an open state. Thus, this rapid transition from channel closed to channel open takes less than 400 μs and therefore is defined as our rapid transition period. In a 30-s recording, there are 75,000 rapid transition periods (Tr = 30 s/400 μs). A typical single channel recording is depicted in Fig. 1 from a cell co-expressing GABAA receptors and GABARAP. The figure illustrates the time resolution of these rapid transitions from closed to open for both the 30-pS channels (Fig. 1B) and the 60-pS channels (Fig. 1C), where each data point represents 100 μs.From our single channel analysis, we can now find the following.Pr(s=2)<(npo)22≈((x1+2x2)Tr2)2=μ^=sample mean probability forPr(s=2)σ=V(p2)=p2(1−p2)Tr≈p2Tr≈(npo)22Tr=μTr=σ^=sampleS.D.Since p2 follows approximately the normal distribution, the Z distribution can be used here as follows,Z=p2−μ^σ^ where Z ∼ N(0,1), and p2 is the observed probability of the 60-pS channels, measured from the raw data by x2/Tr.This is likely to overestimate the p value, so the final expression should be an inequality, as follows,p<12erfc(p2−μ^σ^2)p<12erfc(Z2) where p represents the statistical probability of observing p2 from our data. A p value of <0.01, for example, indicates that there is less than a 1% chance that our null hypothesis is true, which means there is less than a 1% chance of observing as many 60-pS single channel events as found in the data (i.e. p2) if they are indeed due to two independent 30-pS channels opening simultaneously. When the p value is close to zero, we can reject this null hypothesis.RESULTSThe outside-out patch configuration was used to examine the effects of GABA concentration on the single channel properties of recombinant GABAA receptors co-expressed with GABARAP and to compare these properties with GABAA receptors expressed alone in L929 cells.GABAA Receptors Co-expressed with Recombinant GABARAP Display Spontaneous Channel Openings—Outside-out patches excised from cells co-expressing recombinant GABARAP and α1β1γ2S receptors exhibited spontaneous single channel activity with openings being very brief in duration. These spontaneous single channel currents originated from GABAA receptors, because in all cases tested, bicuculline (100 μm, n = 7) reversibly inhibited their activity (Fig. 2A), and currents reversed close to the chloride equilibrium potential (∼0 mV), consistent with the current being carried by Cl– ions. What was distinct about these spontaneous single channels was that they were often high (≥40 pS) and they displayed a range of conductances (2–5 states), characteristics never seen in control cells expressing GABAA receptors alone (13Luu T. Cromer B. Gage P.W. Tierney M.L. J. Membr. Biol. 2005; 205: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To illustrate the variation in the single channel conductances of the spontaneous currents and the frequency of the amplitudes within a single patch, a typical example is shown in Fig. 2B. Here the spontaneous channels displayed conductances as high as ∼50 pS and as low as ∼20 pS with conductance states in between in integrals of ∼10 pS. In general, the maximum conductance of spontaneous channels ranged between 30 and 60 pS (n = 25), and the frequency of particular conductance states varied between patches but all patches expressing GABAA receptors and GABARAP displayed spontaneous GABAA channel activity, unlike those expressing just αβγ receptors. These later patches occasionally displayed spontaneous channel activity (n = 10/33), but current activity was short lived and always dissipated within 1 min.FIGURE 2GABAA receptors show spontaneous channel activity when co-expressed with GABARAP. L929 cells transfected with just αβγ receptors typically showed no spontaneous channel activity, as shown in A. By comparison, spontaneous channel activity was invariably observed in cells co-transfected with αβγ receptors and GABARAP. B shows the persistent nature of the spontaneous channel activity and its inhibition by bicuculline (100 μm). From the same experiment as depicted in B, C shows, on an expanded time scale, the spontaneous channel events and their different single channel amplitudes. The amplitude frequency histogram constructed for this experiment is shown below and was best fitted with the sum of four Gaussians, indicating four predominant single channel conductances were present. All experiments were performed at –60 mV, using the outside-out patch configuration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GABA Increases the Maximum Single Channel Conductance When Recombinant GABARAP Is Co-expressed—The effect of GABA concentration ([GABA]) on single channel conductance was examined by exposing outside-out patches to a range of GABA concentrations (1, 10, 100, and 1000 μm). In our hands and in all other published reports, GABA per se does not alter the single channel conductance of recombinant GABAA receptors (Fig. 3A). By contrast, GABA could increase the maximum single channel conductance in patches pulled from cells co-expressing αβγ and GABARAP. For example, in 16 patches, the application of 1 μm GABA generated low conductance channels, indistinguishable from control cells (∼30 and 20 pS). However, subsequent application of a higher [GABA], either 10, 100, or 1000 μm, always resulted in an increase in the maximum conductance when GABARAP was co-expressed. Fig. 3 illustrates the effect of [GABA] on single channel conductance. In the left-hand trace in A–C, 1 μm GABA activated channels with a maximum conductance of ∼30 pS. However, when a higher [GABA] was subsequently applied to the same patch, the maximum conductance increased but only in patches co-expressing GABAA receptors and GABARAP (B and C). The amplitude histograms below each trace show the distribution and frequency of conductances displayed in the patch over a longer time period. These amplitude histograms illustrate the quantal distribution of the mean conductance levels observed in this and in all patches in this group. In a limited subset of patches, an additional application of an even higher [GABA] (100 or 1000 μm) did not significantly further increase the maximum conductance of these high conductance channels (n = 5/18) (Fig. 4B, open symbols). In one of these experiments, the conductance actually decreased (Fig. 4B, open circle). The agonist GABA produced a range of maximum conductances between 40 and 60 pS that increased in elementary steps of ∼10 pS and appeared to be independent of concentrations ≥10 μm. Fig. 4A shows a scatter plot of these conductance values from 25 experiments. At 1 μm GABA, the maximum conductance centered around 30 pS (n = 18), whereas higher conductance channels were more likely with higher [GABA] (10 μm (n = 11 data points), 100 μm (n = 10), and 1000 μm (n = 11)).FIGURE 3GABA increases the single channel conductance of αβγ receptors co-expressed with GABARAP. A, single channel responses fromαβγ receptors in a patch that was exposed to 1μm GABA and then to 1 mm GABA. The maximum single channel conductance did not change with the increase in [GABA]. In cells co-expressing αβγ receptors and GABARAP, single channel conductance was increased by [GABA] as depicted in B and C. B shows an example of a 10 μm GABA application that increased the maximum single channel conductance to 53 pS from 31 pS activated by 1 μm GABA. C shows another experiment in which the patch was exposed to 1 μm GABA and then to 100 μm GABA. In this patch, the maximum single channel conductance increased from 32 to 58 pS. An amplitude frequency histogram was constructed for each GABA application and shows the predominant single channel conductances during the exposure to GABA. All data shown were recorded in the outside-out patch configuration and at a holding potential of –60 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4GABA modulation of conductance in outside-out patches co-expressing αβγ and GABARAP. The data represent individual experiments where the maximum single channel conductance is plotted against GABA concentration. GABA, at concentrations ≥10 μm, increased the conductance of low conductance channels activated by 1 μm. A illustrates this result with filled circles representing patches exposed to 1 μm GABA followed by a second, higher GABA concentration (n = 13). Application of a single high (100 μm) or saturating dose of GABA (1 mm) opened channels to the highest conductances (filled triangles) (n = 7). B shows five experiments in which the patch was exposed to three or four GABA concentrations (unfilled symbols), illustrating that [GABA] ≥10 μm did not significantly increase channel conductance. All patches were held at –60 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order to determine the highest conductance obtainable by the agonist GABA, outside-out patches excised from cells co-expressing αβγ receptors and GABARAP were initially exposed to a high [GABA] (100 and 1000 μm), and single channel conductances were measured. Under these conditions, the maximum conductance, determined from amplitude histograms, could be as high as ∼60 pS and sometimes ∼50 pS (n = 7) (Fig. 4A, filled triangles).Independent Versus Synchronized Gating Events—To determine if the high conductance openings (∼60 pS) could be due to random simultaneous opening of two independent 30-pS channels, we calculated the probability of rapid transition between the closed level and Imax (Imax = the maximum single channel current). If the observed number of rapid transitions from the closed level to 2*Imax is significantly greater than the predicted probability of two simultaneous independent channels opening, then this could no"

However, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying the role of NPAS1 during development. In this study we set out to characterize the different domains within NPAS1. We showed that the nuclear localization of NPAS1 is dependent on the presence of ARNT. In addition, the transcriptional potential of ARNT is not required for this localization. In the absence of ARNT, NPAS1 is excluded from the nucleus, and this exclusion is due to the presence of a nuclear export signal within the N terminus of NPAS1. The interaction between NPAS1 and ARNT is via their N termini. We found no transactivation domain within NPAS1; instead, we mapped out at least three repression domains within NPAS1, suggesting that NPAS1 acts as a repressor. Furthermore, our experiments showed that NPAS1 is able to repress the transactivation functions of ARNT and ARNT2. We suggest that NPAS1 is guided into the nucleus by ARNT via the ARNT nuclear localization signal, and NPAS1 can override the activation function of adjacent transcription factors, providing a mechanism by which NPAS1 may inhibit transcription.

Each member of this family consists of an N-terminal basic region that binds DNA, the HLH and PAS domains for dimerization and specificity of interacting partner, and a highly divergent C-terminal region (9Reisz-Porszasz S.

Besides ARNT, another protein ARNT2, which is highly similar to ARNT, is shown to be able to interact with the partners of ARNT (17Hirose K. Morita M. Ema M. Mimura J. Hamada H. Fujii H. Saijo Y. Gotoh O. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1706-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, Arnt2 expression is more restricted to the brain and kidneys, which differs from that of Arnt, suggesting that ARNT2 may play different roles from ARNT (18Drutel G. Kathmann M. Heron A. Schwartz J.C. Arrang J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Neuronal PAS domain protein 1 (NPAS1/MOP5) is a bHLH-PAS domain protein that is found to be expressed only in certain regions of the brain (19Zhou Y.D. Barnard M. Tian H. Li X. Ring H.Z. Francke U. Shelton J. Richardson J. Russell D.W. McKnight S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). NPAS1 mRNA expression is first detected at embryonic day 15 of mouse development, shortly after organogenesis of the brain. NPAS1 is found to be highly homologous to NPAS3, whose expression is also exclusively in the brain (20Brunskill E.W. Witte D.P. Shreiner A.B. Potter S.S. Mech. Dev. 1999; 88: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recent studies reveal that laboratory mice lacking NPAS1 and NPAS3 exhibit a spectrum of behavioral and neurochemical abnormalities. In addition, adult brain tissues from NPAS3- and NPAS1/NPAS3-deficient mice showed a distinct reduction in reelin (21Erbel-Sieler C. Dudley C. Zhou Y. Wu X. Estill S.J. Han T. Diaz-Arrastia R. Brunskill E.W. Potter S.S. McKnight S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13648-13653Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These results suggest that NPAS1 may play a role during neuronal differentiation. Although NPAS1 knock-out mice showed behavioral abnormalities that may be related to schizophrenia, relatively little is known about the mechanism of action by NPAS1, except that it forms a heterodimer with ARNT and negatively regulates the expression of erythropoietin (22Ohsawa S. Hamada S. Kakinuma Y. Yagi T. Miura M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), a factor that promotes production of neuronal progenitors in the central nervous system (23Studer L. Csete M. Lee S.H. Kabbani N.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9733-9743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To better understand the role of NPAS1, we set out to characterize the different domains of NPAS1. In this study we report that NPAS1 requires the presence of either ARNT or ARNT2 for translocation into the nucleus, and the N terminus prevents nuclear localization in the absence of ARNT or ARNT2. Similar to other bHLH-PAS domain proteins, NPAS1 interacts with the N terminus of ARNT via its N-terminal domain. Interestingly, we did not find any transactivation domain (TAD) in NPAS1; instead, we identified three non-overlapping repression domains. We also found that NPAS1 is able to suppress the transactivation function of ARNT and ARNT2, further supporting previous findings that NPAS1 plays a negative transcriptional regulatory role. Cloning of Mouse NPAS1 cDNA—Mouse NPAS1 cDNA was amplified from RNA isolated from MN9D cells. MN9D is a mouse dopaminergic neuronal cell line derived from the fusion of rostral mesencephalic neurons from embryonic C57BL/6J mice with the N18TG2 neuroblastoma cells (25Choi H.K. Won L.A. Kontur P.J. Hammond D.N. Fox A.P. Wainer B.H. Hoffmann P.C. Heller A. Brain Res. 1991; 552: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The full-length NPAS1 cDNA was first sequenced in pGEMTEasy vector and subcloned into an expression plasmid (pcDNA3.1(-)_fl NPAS1_GFP) to encode a GFP epitope-C-terminal tagged mouse NPAS1 protein. To generate the N terminus (aa 1-354) and C terminus (aa 348-594) deletion mutants of NPAS1 (pcDNA3.1(-)_NPAS1(N)_GFP and pcDNA3.1(-)_NPAS1(C) _GFP), cDNAs encoding the N terminus or C terminus region of NPAS1 were obtained using pcDNA3.1(-)_fl NPAS1_GFP as a template with the primers 5′-CGTCGATCTAGAACCATGGCGACCCCCTATCCC-3′ and 5′-GTCGACCTCGAGGCTTTGGCGGATCCTGGTTGC-3′ or 5′-CGTCGATCTAGAACCATGGCAACCAGGATCCGCCAAAGCCAT-3′ and 5′-CCCGGGCTCGAGGTCTCCCTTCCGCTGCA-3′, respectively. To generate NPAS1 with a mutated NES, a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used. Construction of Plasmids—pcDNA3.1(+) plasmids containing either full-length Arnt or Arnt2 cDNAs were kind gifts from Dr. Jacques Michaud (Research Center, Hopital Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada) and Dr. Chen-ming Fan (Department of Embryology, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Baltimore, MD), respectively. Mouse full-length ARNT, ARNT(N) (aa 1-354), or ARNT(C) (aa 348-594) were PCR-amplified and cloned into BamHI and XhoI of pXJ40_FLAG or pXJ40_HA. Murine ARNT2 protein was cloned into HindIII and SmaI of pXJ40_FLAG. To generate ARNTΔb, two rounds of PCR were carried out with the following sets of primers overlapping at the region to be deleted. The primers used were 5′-TACGCAGGATCCATGGCGGCGACTACAGCT-3′ with 5′-CATCTTGTTCCGTCGCAAAAATTTAGT-3′ and 5′-TTGCGACGGAACAAGATGGCTCGAAAACCAGACAAGCTA-3′ with 5′-GGTCGACTCGAGCTATTCGGAAAAGGGGGG-3′. The two PCR products were then used as template for a second round of PCR with the outlying primers to join the two fragments. The final amplicon ARNTΔb was then digested with restriction enzymes BamHI and XhoI and ligated into pXJ40_FLAG vector. The encoded murine ARNT and deletion mutants, ARNT2, or ARNTΔb have the FLAG or HA epitope linked to the N terminus. For yeast hybrid work expression plasmids encoding a LexA DNA binding domain (DBD) epitope-tagged version of full-length NPAS1, NPAS1 N terminus, and NPAS1 C terminus were constructed as follows. The pcDNA3.1(-)_fl NPAS1_GFP plasmid was used as template with the following sets of primers: 5′-CGTCGACCATGGATGGCGACCCCCTATCCC-3′ and 5′-CCCGGGCTCGAGGTCTCCCTTCCGCTGCA-3′ or 5′-CGTCGACCATGGATGGCGACCCCCTATCCC-3′ and 5′-GTCGACCTCGAGGCTTTGGCGGATCCTGGTTGC-3′ or 5′-CGTCGACCATGGGCAACCAGGATCCGCCAAAGCCAT-3′ and 5′-GTCGACCTCGAGTCAGTCTCCCTTCCGCTGCACCCT-3′ to generate the fl NPAS1, NPAS1(N), or NPAS1(C) inserts, respectively. The amplified DNA products were digested with the restriction enzymes NcoI and XhoI and ligated into pLexA vector (Clontech). Expression plasmids encoding a LexA DBD epitope-tagged version of full-length (pLexA_fl ARNT), N terminus (aa 1-579) (pLexA_ARNT(N)), or C terminus (aa 578-771) (pLexA_ARNT(C)) of the ARNT protein were constructed as follows. The pcDNA3.1(+)_fl ARNT plasmid was used as a template with the following sets of primers: 5′-TGGCTGGAATTCGCAGAGAATTTCAGGAAT-3′ and 5′-GGTCGACTCGAGCTATTCGGAAAAGGGGGG-3′ or 5′-TGGCTGGAATTCGCAGAGAATTTCAGGAAT-3′ and 5′-CCTGAACTCGAGTGCCGGCCGGGGGTTAGG-3′ or 5′-TGGCTGGAATTCGCAGAGAATTTCAGGAAT-3′ and 5′-GGTCGACTCGAGCTATTCGGAAAAGGGGGG-3′ to generate the fl ARNT, ARNT(N), and ARNT(C) inserts, respectively. The amplified DNA products were digested with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into pLexA vector. For mammalian hybrid work, expression plasmids encoding a GAL4 DBD epitope-tagged version of full-length NPAS1, NPAS1 N terminus, and NPAS1 C terminus were constructed as follows. The pcDNA3.1(-)_fl NPAS1_GFP plasmid was used as a template with the following sets of primers: 5′-CGTCGACCCGGGCATGGCGACCCCCTATCCC-3′ and 5′-GTCGACAAGCTTTCAGTCTCCCTTCCGCTG-3′ or 5′-CGTCGACCCGGGCATGGCGACCCCCTATCCC-3′ and 5′-GTCGACAAGCTTGCTTTGGCGGATCCTGGT-3′ or 5′-CGTCGACCCGGGGGCAACCAGGATCCGCCAA-3′ and 5′-GTCGACAAGCTTTCAGTCTCCCTTCCGCTG-3 to generate the fl ARNT, ARNT(N), and ARNT(C) inserts, respectively. The amplified DNA products were digested with the restriction enzymes SmaI and HindIII and ligated into pM vector (Clontech). Expression plasmids encoding a GAL4 DBD epitope-tagged version of full-length (pM_fl ARNT), N terminus (pM_ARNT(N)), or C terminus (pM_ARNT(C)) of the ARNT protein were constructed as follows. pLexA_fl ARNT, pLex-A_ARNT(N), and pLexA_ARNT(C) were digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and SalI, and the inserts were subcloned into pM vector. Culture and Transfection of Mammalian Cells—The murine clonal MN9D cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml) (26Chee J.L. Guan X.L. Lee J.Y. Dong B. Leong S.M. Ong E.H. Liou A.K. Lim T.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Zhou Z.D. Yap B.P. Gung A.Y. Leong S.M. Ang S.T. Lim T.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 156-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells, embryonic kidney cells of human origin, were grown in RPMI media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). Both cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For transient transfection, cells were grown to the appropriate confluency and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. After 48 h the cells were collected and processed for the respective experiments. Immunocytochemistry—Cells grown in chamber slides were fixed in ice-cold 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min followed by permeabilization with 2% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cells were then blocked in 5% goat serum in PBS for 1 h followed by incubation with the rabbit FLAG antibodies (Sigma) in dilution buffer (2% goat serum in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature at a dilution ratio 1:200. After this, three washes were carried out before incubating the cells with rhodamine-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Technologies) in dilution buffer (1:250) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were again washed three times and stained with Hoescht stain (Sigma) for 5 min before the images were acquired. Isolation of Proteins from Mammalian Cells—Transfected cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed with the lysis buffer (100 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100). Total cell lysates were collected and incubated overnight at -20 °C. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad). Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were probed with the respective primary antibodies (Santa Cruz Technologies) and the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Technologies). Proteins were visualized with an ECL detection kit (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation—Cells transfected with expression plasmids were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer as described above. Lysates were directly analyzed either as whole-cell lysates or used in affinity precipitation with M2 anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, the lysate and beads were incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The beads were then washed 5 times with 2% Triton X-100 in PBS (for HA_ARNT pulldown) or just PBS (for HA_NPAS1 pulldown). Samples were run in SDS-PAGE gels followed by Western blotting. Yeast Work—All yeast cultures were grown in the appropriate synthetic dropout media (BIO101) at 30 °C with shaking at 280 rpm. For transformation, 1 ml of overnight culture of strain EGY48 yeast cells was harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 1 min in a tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant was discarded, and the yeast pellet was resuspended in 95 μl of ONE-STEP buffer (0.2 n LiCl, 40% polyethylene glycol 3550, pH 5.0, and 100 mm dithiothreitol). The suspension was then transferred into an Eppendorf tube containing ∼300 ng of plasmid DNA and 50 μg of Herring sperm DNA. The whole mixture was then incubated at 45 °C for 30 min. The yeast suspension was then plated out on the appropriate synthetic dropout agar plates for 3-5 days at 30 °C. Five independent yeast clones were selected for each transformation set and grown overnight in selective medium. The yeast cultures were then used for β-galactosidase assay with yeast β-galactosidase assay kit (Pierce) according to the microplate assay protocol (stopped) in the instruction manual. CAT and β-Galactosidase Assay in Mammalian Cells— Cells were transfected with the respective pM and/or pcDNA3.1(-)_GFP effector plasmids together with a reporter plasmid, pG5CAT (Clontech), and an internal control plasmid pSV40_β-gal (Promega). After 48 h, the cells were processed and tested for CAT and β-galactosidase activities using the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and β-galactosidase ELISA kit, respectively (Roche Applied Science). Dual Luciferase Assay—Dual luciferase assay was carried out using the Promega kit. Transfected cells in 24-well format were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 100 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min to remove the cell debris. A luminometer was programmed to perform a reading every 5 s. In a luminometer tube, 100 μl of LAR II was added followed by 20 μl of cell lysate. The tube was then placed in the luminometer, and reading was initiated. Several readings (for firefly luciferase activity) were taken until the readings started to decrease before the tube was removed, and 100 μl of Stop & Glo reagent was added and mixed by shaking. The tube was then placed back into the luminometer for further readings until the readings started to decrease. It has been separately reported that NPAS1 is localized to the nucleus of interneurons in the mouse (21Erbel-Sieler C. Dudley C. Zhou Y. Wu X. Estill S.J. Han T. Diaz-Arrastia R. Brunskill E.W. Potter S.S. McKnight S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13648-13653Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and in SHSY5Y, a neuronal cell line (22Ohsawa S. Hamada S. Kakinuma Y. Yagi T. Miura M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, in both papers, there was no mention of the mechanism for this nuclear localization of NPAS1. We examined if NPAS1 is constitutively localized to the nucleus by overexpressing the protein in different cell lines. When NPAS1 was tagged to GFP (NPAS1_GFP) and expressed in MN9D cells, the fusion protein was found to be excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 1Ai). Similar results were observed in a non-neuronal cell line, HEK293 (Fig. 1Bi). These suggest that NPAS1 is not constitutively localized to the nucleus. A phylogenetic analysis reported previously revealed that NPAS1 is a mouse homolog of Drosophila Trachealess (28Hogenesch J.B. Gu Y.Z. Moran S.M. Shimomura K. Radcliffe L.A. Takahashi J.S. Bradfield C.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: RC83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and nuclear localization of Trachealess requires the presence of its interacting partner, Tango (the ortholog of mammalian Arnt) (29Ward M.P. Mosher J.T. Crews S.T. Development. 1998; 125: 1599-1608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We then went on to determine if NPAS1 also uses a partner for nuclear localization. When NPAS1_GFP was co-expressed with FLAG-tagged ARNT or ARNT2 (FLAG_ARNT or FLAG_ARNT2), NPAS1_GFP was found to be localized to the nucleus (Fig. 1, A, ii and iii). The same results were observed when HEK293 cells were used (Fig. 1, B, ii and iii), suggesting that nuclear translocation of NPAS1 by ARNT or ARNT2 is not cell type-specific. In the control experiment, the native GFP protein was evenly distributed between the cytoplasm and nucleus when co-expressed with FLAG_ARNT or FLAG_ARNT2 in both cell lines (results not shown), indicating that the nuclear translocation is specific to NPAS1 and not the GFP tag. Therefore, the localization of NPAS1 in the nucleus requires the presence of ARNT or ARNT2. We then proceeded to elucidate the mechanism underlying the nuclear localization of NPAS1 by ARNT. NPAS1 may be constitutively localized in the cytoplasm and requires ARNT for entry into the nucleus, or alternatively, NPAS1 may shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm but requires ARNT for it to be retained in the nucleus. To determine whether there is an active nuclear export of NPAS1 into the cytoplasm, leptomycin B was added to cells overexpressing NPAS1_GFP. Leptomycin B is an unsaturated, branched-chain fatty acid and has been found to be a specific inhibitor of proteins containing nuclear export signal. The suggested inhibition mechanism involves the direct binding of leptomycin B to CRM1, a protein involved in the nuclear export machinery, thereby blocking the binding of CRM1 to proteins containing the nuclear export signal (30Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 31Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, NPAS1_GFP was still localized to the cytoplasm upon the addition of leptomycin B. This suggests that NPAS1 is constitutively localized to the cytoplasm and does not shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. We then determined the region within NPAS1 that is important for the nuclear exclusion of NPAS1. The N terminus (aa 1-354), consisting of the bHLH and PAS domains, and the C-terminal (aa 348-594) domain of NPAS1 were individually fused upstream of GFP to generate NPAS1(N)_GFP and NPAS1(C)_GFP fusion protein, respectively (Fig. 3A). When co-expressed with FLAG, NPAS1(N)_GFP was found to be excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 3Bi). However, upon co-expression with FLAG_ARNT or FLAG_ARNT2, NPAS1(N)_GFP was found to be localized to the nucleus (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, NPAS1(C)_GFP was found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus when co-expressed with FLAG (Fig. 3Bii). These results suggest that the N terminus of NPAS1 excludes it from the nucleus in the absence of ARNT overexpression. Using a nuclear export signal prediction program, the N terminus of NPAS1 was found to contain a NES, LSLGLTIL, at aa 310-317. To determine whether this NES plays a role in excluding NPAS1 from the nucleus, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the NES. Because basic amino acids are known to be crucial for NES function, all the leucine and isoleucine residues within the NES of NPAS1 were mutated to alanine (Fig. 4A), and the subcellular localization of the mutated NPAS1 was determined. In transfected MN9D and HEK293 cells, the fusion protein was found to be localized to the nuclei, indicating that the nuclear exclusion of NPAS1 is due to this NES (Fig. 4B). It has been reported that NPAS1 and ARNT are able to interact with each other both in vitro and in vivo (22Ohsawa S. Hamada S. Kakinuma Y. Yagi T. Miura M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the exact domains where they interact have not been mapped out. Because it is known that bHLH-PAS domain proteins interact via their N termini, we decided to test if NPAS1 also interacts with ARNT via its N terminus. From our unpublished data we know that overexpression of NPAS1 is more efficient in HEK293 cells compared with other cell lines. Therefore, we decided to overexpress FLAG_fl NPAS1_GFP, FLAG_NPAS1(N), and FLAG_NPAS1(C) individually with HA_fl ARNT in HEK293 cells and use agarose conjugated to FLAG Ab for the pulldown assay. As shown in Fig. 5A, only fl NPAS1 and NPAS1(N), but not NPAS1(C), were able to pull down fl ARNT. This result suggests that NPAS1 interacts with ARNT via the N terminus. To determine the domain where ARNT interacts with NPAS1, FLAG_fl ARNT, FLAG_ARNT(N), and FLAG_ARNT(C) were individually overexpressed with HA_fl NPAS1 in HEK293 cells, and agarose conjugated to FLAG Ab was used for the pulldown assay. As shown in Fig. 5B, only fl ARNT and ARNT(N), but not ARNT(C), were able to pull down fl NPAS1. This shows that ARNT also interacts with NPAS1 via its N terminus. There are two ways in which ARNT can facilitate the nuclear translocation of NPAS1. ARNT can either directly interact with NPAS1, thereby guiding it into the nucleus via its own nuclear localization signal (NLS), or it can activate the transcription of some other genes, which in turn bring NPAS1 into the nucleus. To determine whether the latter mechanism is at work, we eliminated the transcriptional activation function of ARNT by deleting the basic region that binds DNA. This mutant ARNT, without the basic region, was designated ARNTΔb and found to have no transcriptional activation function but was still able to interact with NPAS1 (results not shown). From Fig. 6, it was shown that upon co-expression with FLAG_ARNTΔb, NPAS1_GFP was still able to localize to the nucleus, suggesting that the transcriptional regulation of ARNT is not essential for localizing NPAS1 to the nucleus. Many of the members of the bHLH-PAS domain protein family are known to contain at least one transactivation domain, which is responsible for transcriptional activation (10Jiang B.H. Rue E. Wang G.L.

We decided to investigate if NPAS1 contains any autonomous transactivation domain using a yeast one-hybrid system. In this case, a heterologous system involving the LexA and GAL4 DNA binding domain was used. Full-length NPAS1 cDNA as well as the N and C terminus of NPAS1 were individually fused downstream of the LexA DBD of the pLexA plasmid to generate NPAS1 fusion proteins that are able to bind to LexA operators. These constructs (Fig. 7A) were transformed into EGY48 yeast cells, which had previously been transformed with the lacZ reporter gene under the control of LexA operators. As shown in Fig. 7, B and C, there was no activation of lacZ by LexA_NPAS1 or LexA fused to different domains of NPAS1. In contrast, the LexA_ARNT and LexA_ARNT(C) fusion proteins were able to activate the lacZ reporter gene, confirming the presence of an activation domain in ARNT, which lies in the C terminus that has already been reported previously (34Li H. Dong L. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28098-28105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that the yeast cell does not contain all the post-translational modifications found in mammalian cell. To rule o"
https://openalex.org/W1994169392,"Many pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria secrete toxins and lytic enzymes via a multiprotein complex called the type II secretion system. This system, named Out in Erwinia chrysanthemi, consists of 14 proteins integrated or associated with the two bacterial membranes. OutC, a key player in this process, is probably implicated in the recognition of secreted proteins and signal transduction. OutC possesses a short cytoplasmic sequence, a single transmembrane segment (TMS), and a large periplasmic region carrying a putative PDZ domain. A hydrodynamic study revealed that OutC forms stable dimers of an elongated shape, whereas the PDZ domain adopts a globular shape. Bacterial two-hybrid, cross-linking, and pulldown assays revealed that the self-association of OutC is driven by the TMS, whereas the periplasmic region is dispensable for self-association. Site-directed mutagenesis of the TMS revealed that cooperative interactions between three polar residues located at the same helical face provide adequate stability for OutC self-assembly. An interhelical H-bonding mediated by Gln29 appears to be the main driving force, and two Arg residues located at the TMS boundaries are essential for the stabilization of OutC oligomers. Stepwise mutagenesis of these residues gradually diminished OutC functionality and self-association ability. The triple OutC mutant R15V/Q29L/R36A became monomeric and nonfunctional. Self-association and functionality of the triple mutant were partially restored by the introduction of a polar residue at an alternative position in the interhelical interface. Thus, the OutC TMS is more than just a membrane anchor; it drives the protein self-association that is essential for formation of a functional secretion system.

The type II secretion system (T2SS) 2The abbreviations used are: T2SS, type II secretion system; BTH, bacterial two-hybrid; GSP, general secretion pathway; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PDZ, post-synaptic density, Disc large and Zo-1 proteins; TMS, transmembrane (TM) segment; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; Stokes radius, RS; aa, aminoacids; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. is employed by a number of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria to secrete lytic enzymes and toxins (1Filloux A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 163-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Secretion via this pathway is a two-step process. The proteins first cross the cytoplasmic membrane either by the Sec system or by the twin-arginine transport system, Tat (2Voulhoux R. Ball G. Ize B. Vasil M.L. Lazdunski A. Wu L.F. Filloux A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6735-6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Once exported into the periplasm, the proteins are then secreted by the T2SS across the outer membrane into the medium. Depending on the species, the secretion machinery consists of 12–15 proteins whose exact function is still obscure for most of them. The majority of the components of T2SS are highly conserved, and most of the corresponding genes can be swapped between diverse bacterial species, except for gspC and gspD (3Lindeberg M. Salmond G.P.C. Collmer A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 4Possot O.M. Vignon G. Bomchil N. Ebel F. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2142-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (gsp for general secretory pathway (5Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The T2SS of the phytopathogenic enterobacteria Erwinia chrysanthemi, referred to as the Out system, secretes several pectinases and a cellulase (6Bouley J. Condemine G. Shevchik V.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Curiously, most of the proteins composing the T2SS are associated with or integrated in the inner membrane, except for OutD and OutS, which are located in the outer membrane (7Shevchik V.E. Robert-Baudouy J. Condemine G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3007-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 8Shevchik V.E. Condemine G. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3219-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This suggests that certain components of the T2SS ensure a permanent or transient junction between the two cellular membranes to allow for a functional integrity of the secretion machinery. The existence of two separate steps in the T2S pathway assumes that the secreted proteins, once they have been exported into the periplasm, should be recognized by a special element(s) of the T2S machinery. The inner membrane protein OutC has been suggested for the roles of signal transduction between the two cell membranes and recognition of secreted proteins (3Lindeberg M. Salmond G.P.C. Collmer A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6Bouley J. Condemine G. Shevchik V.E. J. Mol.

Gérard-Vincent M. Lazdunski A. Filloux A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4012-4019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). OutC consists of a short cytoplasmic sequence, a single transmembrane segment (TMS), and a large periplasmic region (10Thomas J.D. Reeves P.J. Salmond G.P.C. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A putative PDZ domain is located close to its C terminus (11Pallen M.J. Ponting C.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). GspC proteins from certain other bacteria presumably possess a coiled-coil domain instead of a PDZ domain (12Peabody C.R. Chung Y.J. Yen M.R. Vidal-Ingigliardi D. Pugsley A.P. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 3051-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Some algorithms also predict a coiled-coil structure for Erwinia OutC. Regardless of its structure, inter-species swapping indicated that this region of OutC directly participates in the specific recognition of the secreted proteins (6Bouley J. Condemine G. Shevchik V.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recently it was proposed that this region of GspC could be involved in the formation of homo-multimeric complexes (13Gérard-Vincent M. Robert V. Ball G. Bleves S. Michel G.P. Lazdunski A. Filloux A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1651-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies suggested that GspC could interact with the inner membrane proteins GspM and GspL (14Lee H.M. Chen J.R. Lee H.L. Leu W.M. Chen L.Y. Hu N.T. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2946-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15Possot O.M. Gérard-Vincent M. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4004-4011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Robert V. Hayes F. Lazdunski A. Michel G.P. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1779-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the current models of the T2SS imply that GspC interacts, at least transiently, with the outer membrane protein GspD (1Filloux A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 163-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 7Shevchik V.E. Robert-Baudouy J. Condemine G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3007-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Bleves S.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1549-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has been shown that some components of the T2SS are assembled into homomultimeric structures. The NTPase GspE located in the cytoplasm seems to take the shape of a hexameric ring-like structure (18Robien M.A. Krumm B.E. Sandkvist M. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 657-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, certain pseudopilins form long flexible pili comprising multiple pseudopilin subunits (19Sauvonnet N. Vignon G. Pugsley A.P. Gounon P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The secretin GspD forms dodecameric rings in a lipid bilayer that could correspond to the channels in the bacterial outer membranes (20Bitter W. Koster M. Latijnhouwers M. de Cock H. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 21Nouwen N. Stahlberg H. Pugsley A.P. Engel A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2229-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems plausible that OutC, which was presumed to interact with OutD and with the inner membrane platform formed by OutE, OutF, OutL, and OutM (22Py B. Loiseau L. Barras F. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), could also be assembled into multimeric structures. The mechanisms that govern the assembly of the T2SS components into a functional multiprotein complex are still poorly understood. Certain binary interactions between soluble protein regions have been detected by using yeast two-hybrid analysis and in vitro assays (22Py B. Loiseau L. Barras F. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 23Sandkvist M. Keith J.M. Bagdasarian M. Howard S.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 742-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although specific interactions between α-helical TMS are important for the folding and oligomerization of membrane proteins (24Gurran A.R. Engelman D.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), their role in the assemblage and function of the T2SS has not been thoroughly analyzed. Here we performed a detailed analysis of the oligomerization state of OutC. Bacterial two-hybrid, cross-linking and pull-down assays revealed that the self-association of OutC is driven by the TMS, whereas the periplasmic region is dispensable for self-association. Site-directed mutagenesis of the TMS revealed that cooperative interactions between three polar residues located at the same helical face, Gln29, Arg15, and Arg36, provide adequate stability for the OutC self-assembly necessary for the protein function. These results allowed us to revise the previous opinion that a single TMS of GspC plays a passive role assuming the anchoring of the protein into the inner membrane (15Possot O.M. Gérard-Vincent M. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4004-4011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we demonstrated instead that the TMS drives the self-association of OutC that is essential for the formation of a functional secretion system. Plasmids—The plasmids used in the study are listed in Table 1. The single and multiple mutations were introduced in the outC sequence of E. chrysanthemi 3937 by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The primers used are listed in supplemental Table S1. The nucleotide sequences of mutant genes were systematically checked (Genome Express).

Various combinations of constructs were co-transformed into the cya Escherichia coli strain DHP1 (F– cya glnV44(AS) recA1 endA1 gyrA96 (Nalr) thi1 hsdR17 spoT1 rfbD1) (25Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) and the transformants were plated on MacConkeymaltose agar supplemented with ampicillin and kanamycin. The color of the colonies was monitored during incubation at 30 °C for 36–48 h. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described (26Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar) in DHP1 liquid cultures grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and with antibiotics at 28 °C for 18 h. All assays were performed from triplicate cultures on three to four different bacterial transformants and on several different days. Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and proteins were either stained with Coomassie G-250 or transferred onto nitrocellulose. The membrane was then incubated with antibodies and developed with the ECL detection kit (GE Healthcare) as described previously (7Shevchik V.E. Robert-Baudouy J. Condemine G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3007-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were 1:10,000-diluted anti-BlaM (Chemicon), 1:4000-diluted anti-Cya (provided by G. Karimova), anti-OutC, anti-PelD, anti-PemA, and anti-Cel5 as described previously (6Bouley J. Condemine G. Shevchik V.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Ni-NTA (Qiagen) was diluted 1:3000. Complementation Test—To test the functionality of OutC mutant proteins, the E. chrysanthemi ΔoutC strain A3618 (6Bouley J. Condemine G. Shevchik V.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was transformed with a pTdB-OC derivative carrying a corresponding outC mutant gene. Exoprotein secretion was initially tested using the halo size on plate assays for pectinase and cellulase activities (6Bouley J. Condemine G. Shevchik V.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting assays, E. chrysanthemi were grown at 28 °C in LB for 14 h until early stationary phase. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min and resuspended at the same volume of LB. The culture supernatants and cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and revealed with antibodies against diverse exoproteins. Protease Accessibility Assay—E. coli MG1655 (F′ λ– rph-1) cells carrying a plasmid with one of the outC derivatives were grown in LB at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.6. Cells from 5 ml of cultures were pelleted and resuspended in 0.2 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA. Lysozyme (5 μl of 3 mg/ml) was added, and the cells were incubated on ice for 15 min. After the incubation, 0.2 ml of ice-cold 5 mm MgSO4 was added, and the spheroplast suspension was separated into 100-μl aliquots. Two aliquots were treated with trypsin (50 μg/ml) for 15 min on ice and, before the proteolysis, 0.05% Triton X-100 was added to one of them. Proteolysis was stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 2 mm, and the spheroplasts were harvested at 4000 × g for 4 min and resuspended in the same volume of Laemmli sample buffer. An untreated spheroplast aliquot was used for β-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase activity assays (26Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). Protein Purification—E. coli NM522 (New England Biolabs) cells carrying a plasmid coding for one of the His-tagged OutC proteins (Table 1) were grown in LB supplemented with ampicillin (150 μg/ml) at 30 °C. At an A600 of 0.7, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 1 mm, and the cultures were grown for an additional 3 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and frozen at –70 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 (pH 8.0) (buffer A), and broken by sonication. The recombinant proteins were purified on Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) at 15 °C as described by the manufacturer. Pefabloc (0.1 mg/ml) was used in all solutions. E. coli BL21(DE3) (Stratagene) cells carrying a plasmid coding for one of the GST-OutC derivatives were grown and stored as above. Purification was performed at 15 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.0) (buffer B), and sonicated. The lysate was centrifuged at 7000 × g for 5 min, mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in the same buffer, and then incubated with mixing for 1 h. Unbound proteins were removed by washing 3 times for 5 min with buffer B and an additional 3 times with buffer B containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The proteins were cleaved from GST by the addition of PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) to 35 units/ml for 2 h. Eluted proteins were separated from the resin by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 2 min and mixed with a new portion of the resin to eliminate any trace of uncleaved GST fusions and the PreScission protease. Pulldown Assay—GST-OutC derivatives were purified as above except that the PreScission protease was omitted, and the fusion proteins remained immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The quantities of immobilized GST fusions were checked by SDS-PAGE before the binding assays. An equal amount (about 50 μg) of purified His-tagged OutC or 0.6 ml of BL21 lysate containing OutC mutant proteins were added to immobilized GST or GST-OutC fusions in buffer B containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After a 1-h incubation with mixing at 8 rpm and at 15 °C, the mixtures were spun for 2 min at 1000 × g, and the pelleted beads were washed 3 times with the same buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with Ni-NTA-peroxidase or anti-OutC. Gel Filtration Chromatography—A Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) was equilibrated with buffer B containing 0.1% Triton X-100 at 15 °C. The flow rate was 0.4 ml/min, and 0.2-ml fractions were collected. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-OutC. Blue dextran and NaCl were used for the determination of the void volume (Vo) and the total volume (Vt), respectively. The elution volumes (Ve) of proteins of known molecular mass and Stokes radius (RS) were used as the standards. The standard curve was plotted with the logarithm of RS against the KD of the standard protein (KD = Ve – Vo/Vt – Vo). Determination of Sedimentation Coefficient—Linear 3.8-ml sucrose gradients of 2.5–20% sucrose (w/v) in buffer B containing 0.1% Triton X-100 were prepared in either H2O or D2O. The sample of 60 μl, containing OutC or one of its derivatives, together with the standard proteins was loaded onto the gradients and centrifuged for 14 h (H2O) or 20 h (D2O) at 55,000 rpm in a Beckman SW-60 rotor at 4 °C. Then forty fractions were collected from the bottom of each gradient and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The positions of the proteins were determined by quantitative scanning of stained gels and immunoblots. Refractive indices were determined with a Carl Zeiss refractometer. The partial specific volumes (ν) of proteins were calculated from the amino acid composition using Sednterp software. The ν of Triton X-100 was considered to be 0.908 ml/g (28Tanford C. Nozaki Y. Reynolds J.A. Makino S. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), whereas ν of the protein-detergent complex was determined from data obtained by H2O and D2O gradient sedimentation as described (28Tanford C. Nozaki Y. Reynolds J.A. Makino S. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular mass, the frictional ratio (f/f0) of the protein-detergent complex, and the amount of detergent bound to the protein were calculated as described (29Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar, 30Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The axial ratio (a/b) was estimated from f/f0 using the Perrin's function (P) as described (31Harding S.E. Cölfen H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), with the apparent hydration (δ) values calculated using Sednterp. Bacterial Two-hybrid Assays Detect OutC Homodimers—To determine whether OutC is able to self-interact in vivo, we used the bacterial two-hybrid (BTH) system (25Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). In BTH the physical association of the two interacting proteins is spatially separated from the transcriptional events (via cAMP synthesis) so it is possible to analyze protein interactions that occur either in the bacterial cytoplasm or in the inner membrane. Full-length OutC fused to the C termini of T18 and T25 fragments were protease-sensitive in a spheroplast assay (Fig. 2 and not shown), indicating that the OutC moiety takes a correct Nin, Cout topology in the inner membrane, as does intact OutC. The E. coli DHP1 cells expressing these two fusions formed red colonies on MacConkey plates, whereas the negative controls (one of the fusions combined with an empty vector) appeared white (Table 2). A positive control (pUT18-zip and pKT25-zip) formed dark red colonies. The level of β-galactosidase activity measured with the two OutC fusions was 5–7-fold higher than that of the negative control and was comparable with the positive control (Table 2). This clearly indicates OutC self-interaction in vivo. Because the OutC moiety in the fusion acquired the correct membrane topology, the OutC homodimerization detected by BTH could be results of interactions in the cytoplasmic membrane, the periplasm, or both.TABLE 2OutC self-interaction detected by the bacterial two-hybrid systemFused proteinPhenotype on MacConkey maltoseβ-Galactosidase activityT25T18units/ml ± S.D.White5,800 ± 500Leucine-ZipLeucine-ZipDark red46,500 ± 5,400OutCWhite5,700 ± 400OutCWhite6,900 ± 600OutCOutCRed38,000 ± 4,000OutCΔCΔ1-13OutCRed37,000 ± 3,300OutCΔRΔ173-256OutCΔRΔ173-256Red23,100 ± 2,700OutCΔHΔ61-72OutCRed35,300 ± 3,800OutCΔNΔ103-172OutCΔAΔ100-123Red36,000 ± 3,000OutCΔNΔ103-172OutCΔNΔ103-172Red40,500 ± 3,800OutCΔUΔ41-72OutCΔUΔ41-72Red22,800 ± 3,300OutC-TMSOutC-TMSRed35,400 ± 3,600OutCΔSΔ1-39OutCΔSΔ1-39White/center red7,500 ± 1,200OutCΔLΔ1-160OutCΔLΔ1-160White/center red7,800 ± 1,000 Open table in a new tab The TMS Is Essential for the OutC Homodimerization in BTH—To define the regions involved in homodimerization, a series of OutC deletion mutants fused to the C termini of T18 and T25 fragments was constructed (Fig. 1A and Tables 1 and 2). Immunoblotting tests with anti-OutC and anti-Cya were systematically performed throughout the BTH assays to check the amounts of truncated hybrids (not shown). When the short cytoplasmic region was deleted (OutCΔC), the β-galactosidase activity was equivalent to that with the full-length fusions (Table 2), indicating that this region is not involved in OutC dimerization. The fusions carrying deletions in the periplasmic region (OutCΔA, OutCΔH, OutCΔN, OutCΔR, and OutCΔU) were sensitive to trypsin in a spheroplast assay, and thus, they were exposed in the periplasm as is full-length OutC (Fig. 2 and not shown). When these truncated fusions were co-expressed pair-wise, red colonies were formed on MacConkey plates (Table 2"

However, this effect of adaphostin in adherent cells/solid tumor models has not been examined. In this study, we investigated the anti-proliferative effects of adaphostin in the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3. Specifically, we explored the potential molecular mechanism(s) by which adaphostin elicits its anti-proliferative effect(s). We demonstrate that adaphostin inhibits the proliferation of PC-3 cells by inducing a G1 phase cell cycle arrest. This adaphostin-induced G1 arrest was associated with an increase in the expression of p21 and p27 and a decrease in the expression of G1-specific cyclins (cyclin A, D1, and D3) and cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6. Consequently, a dramatic decrease in the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein was also observed. Additionally, we found that adaphostin treatment induced a decrease in the phosphorylation of nucleophosmin, a major nuclear phosphoprotein, and that this decreased phosphorylation was a result of the p21- and p27-mediated inactivation of cyclin E-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 complex kinase activity. Furthermore, we have determined that the adaphostin-mediated cell cycle arrest of PC-3 cells is dependent upon activation of the p38 MAPK. We also demonstrate that the hepatocyte growth factor receptor-c-Met is involved in the adaphostin-mediated signaling events that regulate p38 MAPK. Taken together, these results identify for the first time a signaling cascade of adaphostin-mediated G1 phase-specific cell cycle arrest in PC-3 cells. These findings suggest that the tyrphostin member has a broader spectrum of activity than originally predicted.

These findings suggest that the tyrphostin member has a broader spectrum of activity than originally predicted. One hallmark of cancer is the deregulation of cell cycle progression. A large number of proteins are involved in the processes by which a cell chooses between growth arrest and proliferation. The mechanisms through which the epigenetic alterations in human cancers affect these decisions are not well understood. This lack of understanding impedes the development of new, more efficient anti-cancer therapies that rely on the identification of new therapeutic targets and the exploration of the mechanisms of resistance to existing therapies (1Blagden S. de Bono J. Curr. Drug Targets. 2005; 6: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Protein-tyrosine kinases mediate the transduction and processing of many extra- and intracellular signals. The critical role of protein-tyrosine kinases in regulating cell proliferation and their involvement in cancer development is widely accepted (2Krause D.S. Van Etten R.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar, 3Corso S. Comoglio P.M. Giordano S. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 284-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In fact, the design of specific protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors is considered to be an emerging new paradigm in the development of cancer therapies. Consequently, over the last 2 decades, many receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases have emerged as clinically useful drug targets for the treatment of certain types of cancer (4Vlahovic G. Crawford J. Oncologist. 2003; 8: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Tyrosine kinases play a central role in signal transduction pathways by relaying the signals of a complicated network of interdependent signaling molecules. These pathways ultimately affect nuclear processes, such as gene replication and transcription. Often, key tyrosine kinases in tumor cells are no longer properly regulated, resulting in excessive phosphorylation that maintains signal transduction pathways in an activated state. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to the establishment and progression of cancer will allow not only for the re-assessment of existing cancer therapies but also the development of new cancer treatments involving tyrosine kinase inhibitors (4Vlahovic G. Crawford J. Oncologist. 2003; 8: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met has been shown to be overexpressed in prostate cancer (5Hurle R.A. Davies G. Parr C. Mason M.D. Jenkins S.A. Kynaston H.G. Jiang W.G. Histol. Histopathol. 2005; 20: 1339-1349PubMed Google Scholar).

The c-Met receptor, a disulfide-linked heterodimeric glycoprotein, is composed of a transmembrane β-chain that contains the kinase domain and a unique multifunctional docking site. Ligand HGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor c-Met recruits various signal transducers and adaptor molecules such as GAB1, SHC, and GRB2 (7Furge K.A. Zhang Y.W. Vande Woude G.F.

Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar). Ultimately, this leads to the activation of several MAPK pathways that elicit various biological responses (7Furge K.A.

Adaphostin (NSC680410), an adamantyl ester of AG957, is a recently identified and novel member of the tyrphostin family of protein-tyrosine kinase signaling inhibitors. These molecules function by interfering with the peptide substrate-binding site of the tyrosine kinases rather than the ATP-binding site of the respective tyrosine kinases. They have been shown to possess significant anti-proliferative activity, both in vivo and in vitro (11George J. Barshack I. Keren P. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Keren G. Roth A. Exp. Mol.

Because of its low potency in vivo, adaphostin, which is considered to be an improved version of the original compound AG957, is currently under preclinical evaluations, including preclinical toxicology studies for potential human clinical trials (12Yu C. Rahmani M. Almenara J. Sausville E.A. Dent P. Grant S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1364-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Kaur G. Narayanan V.L. Risbood P.A. Hollingshead M.G. Stinson S.F.

Originally, adaphostin was identified as an inhibitor of p210 BCR/ABL kinase and a potent inducer of myeloid cell death in p210 BCR/ABL-positive K562 cells. Subsequently, adaphostin was also shown to efficiently induce apoptosis in p210 BCR/ABL-negative cell lines (16Chandra J. Hackbarth J. Le S. Loegering D. Bone N. Bruzek L.M. Narayanan V.L. Adjei A.A.

Tefferi A. Kottke T.J. Kaur G. Narayanan V.L. Sausville E.A. Kaufmann S.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 237-249PubMed Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the various effects of adaphostin on signaling pathways in adherent as well as suspension cell lines. Because adaphostin has recently shown promise as an anti-cancer compound in several leukemia model systems (14Dasmahapatra G. Nguyen T.K. Dent P. Grant S. Leuk. Res. 2006; 30: 1263-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Chandra J. Hackbarth J. Le S. Loegering D. Bone N. Bruzek L.M. Narayanan V.L. Adjei A.A. Kay N.E. Tefferi A. Karp J.E. Sausville E.A. Kaufmann S.H. Blood. 2003; 102: 4512-4519Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), it would therefore be intriguing to explore the effects of this compound in adherent cell lines. The study presented here was designed to examine the effects of adaphostin on various tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling and cell cycle regulatory pathways in human prostate cancer-derived PC-3 cell lines. Our results demonstrate that adaphostin induces a G1 phase-specific cell cycle arrest by altering HGF/c-Met associated cell survival signaling events that require activation of p38 MAPK. Additionally, we show that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway is involved in adaphostin-mediated reduced phosphorylation of NPM leading to the inhibition of G1 phase-specific cell cycle arrest in PC-3 cells. Drug—Adaphostin (NSC680410) was derived and obtained through the Developmental Therapeutics Program, NCI, National Institutes of Health. Cell Culture—All cell lines used for IC50 determination were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in their respective growth media as suggested by ATCC. Further experiments were performed in the human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line (PC-3) and maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. Cells were then treated with different concentrations of adaphostin for various time points, depending upon experimental design. The treated cells were then trypsinized and washed with PBS, and the experiments were performed. Establishment of Adaphostin-resistant Cell Line—Resistant cell lines were selected in vitro for resistance to adaphostin by continuous exposure of the parental cell line (PC-3) to medium supplemented with adaphostin. The drug-resistant lines were established by exposing the PC-3 cells to stepwise increments of adaphostin at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 μm, yielding the following two variant cell lines displaying a significant degree of resistance to the cytotoxic action of adaphostin: PC-3-ADP-R5, resistant to 5 μm, and PC-3-ADP-R10, resistant to 10 μm adaphostin. The cell lines were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and an antibiotic solution of penicillin and streptomycin (50 units per ml) and gentamicin (25 μg per ml) and were stored at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Various experiments were performed to discern molecular aberrations between the parental and resistant cell line. Growth Inhibition Assay—PC-3 cells and two adaphostin-resistant PC-3 cell lines (PC-3-ADP-R5 and PC-3-ADP-R10) were seeded in 60-mm plastic tissue culture plates (Falcon Labware) in a concentration such that 30–40% confluency would be achieved after 24 h. Different concentrations of adaphostin were then added to these exponentially growing cells, and IC50 value was determined after 48 h following methods described previously (19Dasmahapatra G.P. Didolkar P. Alley M.C. Ghosh S. Sausville E.A. Roy K.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 5242-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cell Cycle Analysis—A single cell suspension of PC-3 cells was obtained with trypsin-EDTA after which the cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS and fixed in chilled 70% ethanol for 4 h. The cells were then washed once in ice-cold PBS and resuspended in propidium iodide staining solution (propidium iodide 10 μg/ml; RNase 50 μg/ml in PBS) for 45 min at room temperature in the dark (20Darzynkiewicz Z. Juan G. Li X. Gorczyca W. Murakami T. Traganos F. Cytometry. 1997; 27: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed for cell cycle distribution by Flo Jo software (TreeStar, San Carlos, CA). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Assay—S phase determination of cells was obtained using the fluorescein isothiocyanate-BrdUrd kit (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, plated cells were harvested in 25 μm BrdUrd for 3 h; subsequently, cells were washed, trypsinized, and resuspended in Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer followed by incubation with DNase, fluorescein isothiocyanate-BrdUrd antibody, and 7-amino-actinimycin D as recommended by the manufacturer. Fluorescence was acquired and analyzed in a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Assessment of Cell Morphology—PC-3 cells were plated onto chambered slides for 24 h followed by treatment with adaphostin for the desired time. They were then washed twice in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and then washed 2–3 times in PBS and mounted on a clean slide over mounting media. The cells were examined in an inverted microscope (Olympus) under a ×40 magnification objective. Phase contrast images of the cells were captured under the same magnification. Protein Extraction and Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates for immunoblotting were prepared as described previously (19Dasmahapatra G.P. Didolkar P. Alley M.C. Ghosh S. Sausville E.A. Roy K.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 5242-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, total cell extracts were obtained using ice-cold cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride). After 20 min of incubation of the cell extracts on ice, they were centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Proteins were quantified with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Lysates containing equal amounts of total protein were resolved by 4–20% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred overnight onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membrane was incubated for 1 h in blocking solution containing 5% nonfat dry milk to inhibit nonspecific binding. The membrane was then incubated with primary antibodies at optimal concentrations for 3 h followed by incubation in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated specific secondary antibodies for 45 min.

Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay—For immunoprecipitation, cells were washed in PBS, lysed using cold lysis buffer as mentioned above, and centrifuged. Protein estimation was performed with the supernatant, and 1000 μg of protein was taken per 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the respective antibodies (see figure legends). The immunocomplexes were absorbed onto protein G-Sepharose beads, washed five times with lysis buffer, denatured, and subjected to electrophoresis on a 4–20% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For kinase assay, immunoprecipitates with CDK2 were resuspended in kinase buffer, and kinase assays were performed as previously described (21Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A.

PC-3 cells were transfected with 0.5 μgof p21 or p27 promoter-luciferase plasmid along with β-galactosidase (for normalizing luciferase activity) using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h of transfection, media were replaced with fresh warm media and PC-3 cells were further incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of 2.5 μm adaphostin. The cells were then collected, extracted, and analyzed for luciferase activity using dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Adaphostin Treatment Affects Tumor Cell Proliferation—The structure of adaphostin, an adamantyl congener of tyrphostin AG957, is depicted in Fig. 1A. To examine the ability of adaphostin to alter the growth of tumor cells, its IC50 concentration (the concentration that inhibits growth by 50%) in various tumor cell lines was determined using a cell-based trypan blue dye exclusion assay. The results (Table 1) demonstrate that adaphostin inhibits the growth of many of the adherent and suspension cell lines tested. The IC50 values ranged from 50 to 200 nm (for CCRF-CEM and Jurkat E6-1 cells), to 2–6 μm (for PC-3, DU-145, MCF-7, BxPC-3, SW620, KM-12, K-562, HT, and Carpus cells), and 7–10 μm (for HT-29 and CLL-B cells). The human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 was used to further examine the effects of adaphostin on tumor cell growth. As shown in Fig. 1B, adaphostin treatment results in a dose-dependent inhibition PC-3 cell growth. After 48 h of treatment, the IC50 concentration of adaphostin in these cells was determined to be 2.5 ± 0.04 μm. Continued treatment with this concentration of adaphostin causes a 50% growth inhibition in these cells relative to control untreated PC-3 cells (Fig. 1C).TABLE 1IC50 of adaphostin in different cancer cell linesCell lineCell typeNature of cellIC50 in 48 hPC-3AdherentProstate adenocarcinoma2.5 ± 0.04 μmDU-145AdherentProstate carcinoma4.7 ± 0.1 μmMCF-7AdherentBreast adenocarcinoma5.1 ± 0.08 μmBxPC3AdherentPancreas adenocarcinoma2.6 ± 0.03 μmSW620AdherentColorectal adenocarcinoma3.6 ± 0.02 μmKM-12AdherentColorectal adenocarcinoma3.6 ± 0.05 μmHT-29AdherentColorectal adenocarcinoma9.2 ± 0.2 μmK-562SuspensionChronic myelogenous leukemia4.4 ± 0.08 μmCCRF-CEMSuspensionAcute lymphoblastic leukemia127 ± 2.2 nmJurkat E6-1SuspensionAcute T-cell leukemia79 ± 1.8 nmCLL-BSuspensionChronic lymphocytic leukemia8.8 ± 0.2 μmHTSuspensionDiffuse mixed lymphoma2.5 ± 0.03 μmKarpusSuspensionNon-Hodgkin lymphoma2.6 ± 0.01 μm Open table in a new tab Adaphostin Induces a Strong G1 Phase Cell Cycle Arrest in PC-3 Cells—To explore the potential mechanisms through which adaphostin mediates its growth inhibitory effect(s), we examined whether it altered the cell cycle progression of PC-3 cells before and after adaphostin treatment. For these experiments, PC-3 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of adaphostin for 0, 24, and 48 h. Following this treatment, the cells were stained with propidium iodide (which stains total cellular DNA) and evaluated by flow cytometry. This analysis allowed for the identification of the percentage of cells in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases. A dose-dependent increase in the percentage of cells in G1 phase was observed after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 2A). For example, in the absence of treatment, 39% of the cells were in G0/G1 phase, but following treatment with 0.5, 1.0, or 2.5 μm adaphostin, the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase increased to 44, 63, and 79%, respectively. This increase in G1 phase cells corresponded to a significant decrease in S phase cells (Fig. 2B) and a minimal decrease in G2-M cells (data not shown). The percentage of cells in G1 increased even further after 48 h of treatment at lower concentrations. Interestingly, at the highest concentration of adaphostin (5.0 μm), the percentage of cells in G1 actually decreased after 24 and 48 h of exposure to adaphostin relative to the percentage of G1 phase cells treated with 2.5 μm adaphostin. This result may be due to increased cell death. A more pronounced G1 phase cell cycle arrest was observed in PC-3 cells treated with 2.5 μm adaphostin for 24 h if the cells were first synchronized in G1 using aphidicolin (data not shown). In other experiments, the percentage of PC-3 cells in S phase following treatment with adaphostin for 24 h was determined by BrdUrd incorporation. Consistently, a significant (p < 0.05) dose-dependent decrease in the S phase population of these cells was observed (Fig. 2B). Therefore, adaphostin induces a G1 phase cell cycle arrest in PC-3 cells. Effects of Adaphostin on Cell Cycle Regulatory Proteins—To investigate the mechanisms by which adaphostin induces a G1 phase cell cycle arrest, we examined the expression profile of a number of cell cycle regulatory proteins (Fig. 3, A–D). For this analysis, PC-3 cells were treated with different concentrations of adaphostin (0, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 μm) for 24 h (left panels) or with 2.5 μm adaphostin for different lengths of time (0, 24, and 48 h) (right panels). Total cellular lysates were prepared from the cells, and Western blot analysis was performed on these lysates. The results demonstrate that after 24 h of treatment with 1.0 μm adaphostin, there is a decrease in the levels of cyclins A, D1, and D3 relative to control cells (Fig. 3A, left panel). This decrease was even greater in cells treated with higher concentrations (2.5 and 5.0 μm) of adaphostin. Furthermore, a time-dependent decrease in the levels of these proteins was also observed (Fig. 3A, right panel). No significant changes in the levels of cyclin B1 or cyclin E were observed (Fig. 3A). Adaphostin treatment also caused a moderate dose- and time-dependent decrease in the expression levels of CDK4 and CDK6 proteins. No significant reduction in the levels of CDK1 and CDK2 was observed (Fig. 3B). Next, we analyzed the effect of adaphostin on protein expression levels of CDKI. Western blot analysis demonstrated a strong dose- and time-dependent increase in the expression levels of p21 and p27 (Fig. 3C). No change was observed in the protein levels of p15 and p18 (Fig. 3C). Additionally, although the expression level of Rb did not change in response to adaphostin treatment, a dramatic dose- and time-dependent decrease in the Rb phosphorylation level was observed (Fig. 3D). In all of the Western blots, the membranes were also independently probed for β-actin as a loading control. Mechanistic Basis of Adaphostin Action on Cell Cycle Regulatory Proteins—We next examined whether the above-described decrease"
https://openalex.org/W2050830070,"We recently demonstrated that the reuptake of full-length amelogenin protein results in increased levels of amelogenin mRNA through enhanced mRNA stabilization (Xu, L., Harada, H., Tamaki, T. Y., Matsumoto, S., Tanaka, J., and Taniguchi, A. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 2257–2262). Here, we examined the molecular mechanism of enhanced amelogenin mRNA stabilization. To identify the cis-regulatory region within amelogenin mRNA, we tested various reporter systems using a deletion series of reporter plasmids. A deletion at exon 6ABC of amelogenin mRNA resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in the amelogenin mRNA expression level when compared with that of full-length mRNA, indicating that a cis-element exists in exon 6ABC of amelogenin mRNA. Furthermore, Northwestern analysis demonstrated that amelogenin protein binds directly to its mRNA in vitro, suggesting that amelogenin protein acts as a trans-acting protein that specifically binds to this cis-element. Moreover, recombinant mouse amelogenin protein extended the half-life of full-length amelogenin mRNA but did not significantly alter the half-life of exon 6ABC-deletion mutant mRNA. The splice products produced by deletion of exon 6ABC are known as leucine-rich amelogenin peptides and have signaling effects on cells.

The larger forms, those that contain the intact proline-rich, hydrophobic exon 6 domains, are important for enamel mineralization (for review, see Ref. 17Moradian-Oldak J. Simmer J.P. Lau E.C.

Thus, the mRNA products of short and full-length amelogenin have different functions, and the regulation of full-length amelogenin protein expression appears to differ from the regulation of LRAP expression.CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α plays a key role in the developmentally regulated expression of the amelogenin gene at the transcription level (18Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas Msx2 mediates interference with the binding of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α to its cognate site on the mouse amelogenin minimal promoter by protein-protein interaction (19Zhou Y.L. Lei Y. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29066-29075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our previous study indicated that the reuptake of full-length amelogenin protein results in increased levels of amelogenin mRNA through enhanced mRNA stabilization (20Xu L. Harada H. Tamaki T.Y. Matsumoto S. Tanaka J. Taniguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2257-2262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, amelogenin gene expression is regulated at both the transcription and the post-transcription level. However, still unclear is the difference between the molecular mechanisms of short and full-length amelogenin expression regulation.The regulation of mRNA stability plays an important role in controlling gene expression in a broad range of contexts in eukaryotic cells. Differential mRNA turnover is determined by specific cis-acting elements within the mRNA and the trans-acting factors that bind them. The cis-elements are found in the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) (21Dibbens J.A. Miller D.L. Damert A. Risau W. Vadas M.A. Goodall G.J. Mol. Biol.

Trans-acting proteins that specifically bind to certain of these elements have been identified, and most are mRNA-binding proteins (28Sachs, A. B. Cell 74, 413–421Google Scholar, 29Wang X.

Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 5879-5888Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).In the present study, we examined the molecular mechanism of the increased levels of amelogenin mRNA through enhanced mRNA stabilization. We found that the exon 6ABC region of amelogenin mRNA is involved in amelogenin mRNA instability and amelogenin protein-mediated stability and that full-length amelogenin mRNA specifically binds to amelogenin protein in vitro. These results suggest that the mRNA expression of LRAP, which results from the deletion of exon 6ABC, is not affected by amelogenin protein-mediated post-transcriptional regulation, which is different to full-length amelogenin mRNA. Furthermore, the regulation of full-length amelogenin protein expression differs from the regulation of LRAP expression.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of Reporter Plasmids—Reporter plasmid constructs were designed as described previously (31Koga T. Sardina E. Tidwell R.M. Pelletier M. Look D.C. Holtzman M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 5680-5685Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The rat amelogenin sequence encoding the complete mRNA, comprising the 5′-UTR, coding region, and 3′-UTR (accession number U51195) or the alternative splicing product (exons 1, 2, 3, 5, 6D, and 8) were cloned into the pUC vector. The luciferase fragment taken from pGL3-Basic (1341–1649 nucleotides, Invitrogen) was inserted into the amelogenin sequence between the 5′-UTR and the coding region to serve as a reporter gene for real-time PCR determination using the fusion PCR method. In this step, one point mutation in the amelogenin translation start codon (ATG mutated to CTG) was made. These amelogenin/luciferase fragments were then inserted into an expression vector (pCR3.1, Invitrogen) driven by the CMV promoter using the BamHI/ApaI restriction enzyme sites. The constructs containing the heterologous promoter/reporter plasmids were designated pL-FL (full-length amelogenin cDNA) and pL-d6ABC (with deletion of exon 6ABC). Using these constructs as templates, the following deletion mutants were produced: pL-d5′-UTR, pL-dORF, pL-d3′-UTR, pL-d(5′-UTR+ORF), pL-d(5′-UTR+3′-UTR), pL-d(ORF+3′-UTR), pL and pL-d2356ABC (with deletion of exons 2, 3, 5, and 6ABC of the ORF), and pL-d6D8 (with deletion of exon 6D and 8 of the ORF). Each construct contained the same endogenous amelogenin polyadenylation signal.Cell Culture and Transfection—HAT-7 cells, a dental epithelial cell line originating from the apical bud of a rat incisor (32Kawano S. Morotomi T. Toyono T. Nakamura N. Uchida T. Ohishi M. Toyoshima K. Harada H. Connect. Tissue Res. 2002; 43: 409-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml). All cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C.All transfection experiments were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the supplier's protocol (Invitrogen). In the case of the quantitative analysis of mRNA expression levels, Renilla luciferase (pRL) plasmids were co-transfected to verify transfection/expression efficiency. The reaction consisted of 1.6 μg of test plasmid DNA, 1.0 μgofpRL plasmid, and 7 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent being transiently transfected into 6-well HAT-7 cell culture plates at 70–80% confluency. In the case of half-life analysis, 4.0 μg of plasmid DNA and 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent were transiently transfected into 6-well HAT-7 cell culture plates and actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) treatment, and then analysis was performed at 24 h after transfection for various periods, ranging from 0 to 120 min. At 6 h after transfection, recombinant mouse amelogenin protein induction was performed at 18 h followed by actinomycin D treatment (see below).Determination of mRNA Expression Level and Half-life Analysis—Total RNA was extracted at each time point using the RV total RNA isolation system, which includes DNase I treatment (Promega, Madison, WI). A 4-μg amount of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's protocol. The expression levels of mRNA or remaining mRNA after actinomycin D treatment were determined using the real-time PCR SYBR Green method, as described previously (33Taguchi T. Xu L. Kobayashi H. Taniguchi A. Kataoka K. Tanaka J. Biomaterials. 2005; 26: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34Ishibashi Y. Inouye Y. Okano T. Taniguchi A. Glycoconj.

In the case of quantitative analysis of mRNA expression levels, similar transfection/expression efficiency was produced by normalizing the levels obtained against the pRL expression level. The analysis of mRNA half-life determined from actinomycin D treatment was as described in our previous study (20Xu L. Harada H. Tamaki T.Y. Matsumoto S. Tanaka J. Taniguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2257-2262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The primers used for real-time PCR were designed by PrimerExpress software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and are as follows: luciferase reporter gene, forward, 5′-TGGGACGAAGACGAACACTTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCCACCTGATAGCCTTTGTACTTAA-3′, and Renilla luciferase gene, forward, 5′-GAATTTGCAGCATATCTTGAACCA-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGATTTCACGAGGCCATGAT-3′.RNA Synthesis and Northwestern Blot Analysis—The DNA template used for amelogenin RNA synthesis was linearized by cutting the pCMV-amelogenin plasmid containing the T7 promoter at the ApaI site downstream from the amelogenin sequence. This was followed by purification of the DNA by phenol/chloroform extraction and subsequent ethanol precipitation. Antisense neomycine cDNA was used as a control RNA. In vitro RNA transcription and DIG RNA labeling were performed using the DIG RNA labeling kit (SP6/T7) (Roche Applied Science, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) as follows: 1 μg of purified template DNA was added to diethyl pyrocarbonate-water to a volume of 13 μl and then added 2 μl of 10× NTP labeling mixture, 2 μlof10× transcription buffer, 1 μl of protector RNase inhibitor, and 2 μl of RNA polymerase T7 with subsequent incubation for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 0.2 m EDTA (pH 8.0). The DIG-labeled amelogenin RNA was then purified using the High Pure PCR product purification kit (Roche Applied Science).Northwestern analysis was carried out as reported previously (29Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Yu J. Russell J.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 5879-5888Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, proteins were separated on 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, and 20% methanol) at 100 mA for 1 h. The membrane was rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and then gently shaken for 2 h at room temperature in Northwestern buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1× Denhardt's solution, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), after which it was incubated with the DIG-labeled RNA solution (5 μg/ml heparin, 5 μg/ml tRNA, and 60 ng/ml in vitro-transcribed DIG-labeled RNA) overnight at 4 °C with shaking. The membrane was washed in Northwestern buffer, endogenous signals were blocked by incubating for 2 h in 1% bovine serum albumin-Tris-buffered saline, and signals were then detected by incubating with anti-DIG-peroxidase antibody (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature followed by visualization with 3-3′-diaminobenzidine.Transferrin and human IgG were used as the control proteins (WAKO, Osaka, Japan), as was cell lysate protein extracted from HAT-7 or NIH 3T3 cells using M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce).Statistical Analysis—Data is presented as means ± S.D. Single group comparisons were evaluated by Student's t test. Statistical significance was set at * p < 0.01, ** p < 0.001.RESULTSPresence of a Cis-acting Element in Exon 6ABC of Amelogenin mRNA—We used HAT-7 cells, a dental epithelial cell line originating from the apical bud of a rat incisor (32Kawano S. Morotomi T. Toyono T. Nakamura N. Uchida T. Ohishi M. Toyoshima K. Harada H. Connect. Tissue Res. 2002; 43: 409-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HAT-7 cells constitutively express amelogenin when cultured at high confluency (32Kawano S. Morotomi T. Toyono T. Nakamura N. Uchida T. Ohishi M. Toyoshima K. Harada H. Connect. Tissue Res. 2002; 43: 409-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression levels of amelogenin protein in HAT-7 cells were very low when compared with exogenous amelogenin concentration. Thus, we expect that the effect of endogenous amelogenin on mRNA stabilization is very low.Differential mRNA turnover is determined by specific cis-acting elements within the mRNA. These cis-elements are found in the 5′-UTR, the protein coding region, and the 3′-UTR. To identify the cis-regulatory region within amelogenin mRNA, we constructed and tested reporter plasmids using partial luciferase sequences (Fig. 1A). In the case of rat amelogenin cDNA, R1 isoforms, which have a deletion exon 7 and encode exon 8, are major transcripts (10Li R. Li W. DenBesten P.K. J. Dent. Res. 1995; 74: 1880-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, we used R1 from amelogenin cDNA in this study. To avoid exogenous translated amelogenin proteins directly feeding back to stabilize its mRNA after transient transfection, the translation start codon was mutated. HAT-7 cells were transiently transfected separately with each reporter plasmid, and the levels of luciferase mRNA were then determined by real-time PCR (Fig. 1B). Deletion of the ORF region (pL-dORF) resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in the mRNA level when compared with the full-length amelogenin (pL-FL) level (Fig. 1B). Deletion of the ORF and 5′-UTR (pL-d(5′-UTR+ORF)), the ORF and 3′-UTR (pL-d(ORF+3′-UTR)), or the 5′-UTR, ORF, and 3′-UTR (pL) also resulted in increased mRNA levels when compared with the full-length amelogenin (pL-FL) level (Fig. 1B). However, deletion of the 5′-UTR (pL-d5′-UTR), the 3′-UTR (pL-d3′-UTR), or the 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR (pL-d(5′-UTR+3′-UTR)) did not increase the mRNA level when compared with the full-length amelogenin (pL-FL) level. These results indicated that a cis-element was present in the ORF of amelogenin mRNA.To further characterize the cis-region of destabilizing sequence in the ORF, we constructed a deletion series of reporter plasmids with deletion of the ORF (Fig. 2A). HAT-7 cells were transiently transfected separately with each reporter plasmid, and the levels of luciferase mRNA were then determined by real-time PCR. Deletion of the ORF region (pL-dORF), exons 2, 3, 5, and 6ABC (pL-d2356ABC), and exon 6ABC (pL-d6ABC) resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in the mRNA level when compared with the full-length amelogenin (pL-FL) level (Fig. 2B). However, deletion of exons 6D and 8 (pL-d6D8) did not increase the mRNA level when compared with the full-length amelogenin (pL-FL) level. These results indicate that the cis-acting element is present in the exon 6ABC sequence of amelogenin mRNA.FIGURE 2The destabilizing sequence located in exon 6ABC. A, schematic representation of reporter plasmids. ORF (pL-dORF), exons 2, 3, 5, and 6ABC (pL-d2356ABC), exon 6ABC (pL-d6ABC), or exons 6D and 8 (pL-d6D8) were deleted. All plasmids included the amelogenin polyadenylation signal (788–825 bp) and point mutation in the amelogenin translation start codon (ATG to CTG). Transcription was driven by the constitutive CMV promoter upstream of the amelogenin cDNA. The upper panel shows the schematic representation of rat amelogenin full-length cDNA. Luc, Partial luciferase sequence. B, luciferase reporter mRNA levels in each reporter plasmid. HAT-7 cells were transiently transfected with each reporter plasmid separately, co-transfected with the Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (pRL-CMV), and cultured for 24 h. The levels of luciferase reporter mRNAs were determined by quantitative real-time PCR and normalized against the pRL-CMV level. Results are representative of six experiments.

Recombinant amelogenin protein extended the half-life of pL-FL-driven mRNA in transient transfected cells when compared with cells without amelogenin protein (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the half-life of pL-d6ABC-driven chimeric mRNA was 2-fold longer than that of pL-FL (Fig. 3B), and no changes were observed in pL-d6ABC-driven mRNA in transient transfected cells with or without amelogenin protein (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that amelogenin protein extends the life span of amelogenin mRNA via the exon 6ABC region. The splice products produced by deletion of exon 6ABC are known as LRAP and have signaling effects on cells. These findings suggest that the full-length amelogenin protein do not regulate the LRAP mRNA level through mRNA stabilization.FIGURE 3The half-lives of chimeric mRNA with or without amelogenin protein.

Chem. 2006; 281: 2257-2262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting that amelogenin protein is a trans-acting protein. In the present study, Northwestern analysis was performed to determine whether amelogenin protein binds to amelogenin mRNA directly. As shown in Fig. 4, in vitro transcribed full-length amelogenin mRNA specifically bound to recombinant mouse amelogenin protein (Fig. 4B, lane 2) but did not bind to transferrin (lane 1) or IgG (lane 5) (controls), despite nonspecific binding to cell lysate protein (extracted from HAT-7 or NIH3T3 cells) (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4). The result of reverse transcription-PCR showed that amelogenin mRNA was not detected in non-dental NIH3T3 cells (data not shown), indicating that the bands in Fig. 4B (lanes 3 and 4) were non-specific bands. Moreover, control RNA did not bind to recombinant mouse amelogenin protein (Fig. 4C, lane 2), transferrin, or IgG, despite nonspecific binding with cell lysate (Fig. 4C, lanes 3 and 4). These results indicate that amelogenin mRNA specifically binds to amelogenin protein in vitro.FIGURE 4Amelogenin mRNA binds to recombinant amelogenin protein in vitro.

Harada H. Tamaki T.Y. Matsumoto S. Tanaka J. Taniguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2257-2262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting that in vivo, ameloblasts are able to dramatically increase the production of amelogenin in an autocrine fashion. Indeed, ameloblasts secrete a large amount of amelogenin for enamel formation during the short periods of tooth development. When dentin matrix is formed between the inner enamel epithelium and mesenchymal cells, amelogenin accumulates at the proximal side of the inner enamel epithelium. The deposition of amelogenin helps the inner enamel epithelium cells reuptake amelogenin into the cytoplasm. It could be speculated that amelogenin proteins, which are incorporated into enamel matrix or proteolytic degraded amelogenin, could not be reuptaken by cells. We speculate that the shutdown of amelogenin production in the maturing ameloblast occurs because of its transition from secretory to maturation phase by the shutdown of reuptaken. Taken together, we propose a unique biological function of amelogenin in regulating the expression of amelogenin through stabilizing amelogenin mRNA.The regulation of mRNA stability is an important process in controlling gene expression. Differential mRNA stability is determined by the specific cis-acting elements within mRNA and the trans-acting factors that bind to them. Here, we have demonstrated that a cis-acting element is present in exon 6ABC of amelogenin mRNA. We have also demonstrated that amelogenin protein binds to amelogenin mRNA in vitro, suggesting that amelogenin protein acts as a trans-acting factor that binds to the exon 6ABC region of amelogenin mRNA.Multitype alternative splicing mRNAs generated by the amelogenin gene have been identified in various species. In mice, nine gene products of amelogenin have been identified and detected as protein, all of which contain exon 7 (5Lau E.C. Simmer J.P. Bringas P. Hsu D.D. Hu C.-C. Zeichner-David M. Thiemann F.

In rat, the amelogenin mRNAs that have been identified, with the exception of the exon 7 types, are R195 (contains exons 2, 3, 4, 5, 6ABCD, and 7), R181 (exons 2, 3, 5, 6ABCD, and 7), R73 (exons 2, 3, 4, 5, 6D, and 7), R59 (exons 2, 3, 5, 6D, and 7) (13Veis A.

This CSPG is a major receptor for the adherence of Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells (IRBCs) in placentas, causing pregnancy-specific malaria. However, it is not known whether such low sulfated CSPGs occur in placentas of other animals and, if so, whether IRBCs bind to those CSPGs. In this study, we show that rat placenta contains a uniquely low sulfated extracellular CSPG bearing chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains, which comprise only ∼2% 4-sulfated and the remainder nonsulfated disaccharides. Surprisingly, the core protein of the rat placental CSPG, unlike that of the human placental CSPG, is a spongiotrophoblast-specific protein (SSP), which is expressed in a pregnancy stage-dependent manner. The majority of rat placental SSP is present in the CSPG form, and only ∼10% occurs without CS chain substitution. Of the total SSP-CSPG in rat placenta, ∼57% is modified with a single CS chain, and ∼43% carries two CS chains. These data together with the previous finding on human placental CSPG suggest that the expression of low sulfated CSPG is a common feature of animal placentas. Our data also show that the unique species-specific difference in the biology of the rat and human placentas is reflected in the occurrence of completely different CSPG core protein types. Furthermore, the rat SSP-CSPG binds P. falciparum IRBCs in a CS chain-dependent manner. Since IRBCs have been reported to accumulate in the placentas of malaria parasite-infected rodents, our results have important implications for exploiting pregnant rats as a model for studying chondroitin 4-sulfate-based therapeutics for human placental malaria.

The CSPGs of cartilage and those from a wide variety of tissues and cell types of different animals have been extensively characterized with respect to their core proteins and the structural characteristics of the constituent CS chains (1Kjellen L.

Previously, we have shown that human placenta contains a major extracellular, unusually low sulfated aggrecan family CSPG, localized predominantly in the intervillous space (7Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Alkhalil A. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40344-40356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 8Muthusamy A. Achur R.N.

The CS chains of the placental CSPG consist of, on average, ∼8% 4-sulfated and ∼92% nonsulfated disaccharide residues (7Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Alkhalil A. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40344-40356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The human placental CSPG is a mixture of two major distinctively sulfated aggrecan species, one with 2–3% and the other with 9–14% sulfated disaccharide moieties (9Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11705-11713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although the biological function of the low sulfated aggrecan CSPG in human placenta is not known, it is possible that the placental low sulfated CS chains are involved in mobilizing nutrients, cytokines, hormones, and growth factors required for placental function and for the development of the fetus. The low sulfated CS chains are ideally suited for this function, since they are likely to reversibly and readily release the bound factors for their function. We have previously shown that the low sulfated CSPG is the receptor for the adherence of Plasmodium falciparum IRBCs in the placentas of pregnant women and that the sulfate groupclustered regions of the C4S chains are the IRBC-binding sites (7Achur R.N.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11705-11713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Previous studies have also shown that P. falciparum IRBC binding to C4S involves the participation of both sulfated and nonsulfated disaccharide residues, and a dodecasaccharide motif with two 4-sulfated disaccharides is the minimal structural motif for optimal binding of IRBCs (9Achur R.N.

Recently, we have defined the role of the key functional groups, including the acetamido and carboxyl groups of C4S for IRBC binding. 3A. S. Prakasha Gowda, S. V. Madhunapantula, R. N. Achur, M. Valiyaveettil, V. P. Bhavanandan, and D. C. Gowda, unpublished results. Although the data from these studies offer strategies for developing C4S oligosaccharide-based therapy for placental malaria, animal models for studying the therapeutic potentials of such compounds have not been defined. In pregnant rats infected with P. berghei, as in the case of human placental malaria, IRBCs and monocytes accumulate in high density in the placenta, causing severe placental pathology (12Tegoshi T. Desowitz R.S. Pirl K.G. Maeno Y. Aikawa M. Am. J. Top. Med. Hyg. 1992; 47: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Oduola A.M.J. Phillips J.H. Spicer S.S. Galbraith R.M. Exp.

However, the molecular interactions involved in the observed IRBC sequestration in the rat placenta are not known. As a part of our effort to determine whether pregnant rats can be useful as a model for studying pregnancy-specific malaria, we studied, in detail, the extracellular CSPG of the rat placenta. Interestingly, we found that although the rat placenta synthesizes very low sulfated CSPG, this proteoglycan is totally unrelated to aggrecan, and the sulfate content of the CS chains of rat placental CSPG is much more lower than that of the low sulfated human placental CSPG. The core protein of the rat placental CSPG is SSP, which is expressed in a pregnancy stage-specific manner (15Iwatsuki K. Shinozaki M. Sun W. Yagi S. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 1352-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The expression of similarly low sulfated CS chains both in humans and rats, although the core proteins of CSPGs from these species are entirely different, points to important biological functions for the unusually low sulfated CS chains of placentas. Here, we report the structural characterization and IRBC-binding properties of the rat placental SSP-CSPG. Materials—Proteus vulgaris chondroitinase ABC, protease-free P. vulgaris chondroitinase ABC (120 units/mg), Arthrobacter aurescens chondroitinase AC II (87 units/mg), and super special grade C6S (shark cartilage) were purchased from Seikagaku America (Falmouth, MA). Bovine tracheal chondroitin sulfate A and Streptococcus species hyaluronic acid were from Calbiochem. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, N-ethylmaleimide, and benzamidine were from Sigma. TLCK and TPCK were from Roche Applied Science. Sepharose CL-6B, DEAE-Sephacel, and blue dextran were from Amersham Biosciences. Bio-Gel P-6, 4–15% gradient and 15% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide minigels, and protein molecular weight standards for SDS-PAGE were from Bio-Rad. HPLC grade 6 m HCl, trifluoroacetic acid, and micro-BCA protein assay kit were from Pierce. Polystyrene Petri dishes (Falcon 1058) were from BD Biosciences. The rabbit antiserum against SSP was generously provided by Dr. Kunio Shiota (Laboratory of Cellular Biochemistry, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) (15Iwatsuki K. Shinozaki M. Sun W. Yagi S. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 1352-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were from KPL (Gaithersburg, MD). Isolation of Extracellular Proteoglycans from Rat Placenta—The procedures used were similar to those previously described for the isolation of CSPGs from the human term placentas (7Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Alkhalil A. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40344-40356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 9Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11705-11713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All procedures were performed on ice or in a cold room at 4 °C. Placentas (each weighing 0.6–0.7 g) from 20- or 21-day pregnant Wistar rats were collected by surgical dissection after anesthetizing the animals. Placentas from several rats were cut into small pieces, and the combined tissue (28 g) was extracted with 50 ml of PBS, pH 7.2, containing 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm TLCK, 0.25 mm TPCK, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.1 mm N-ethylmaleimide by stirring with a magnetic stirrer for 4 h. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min in a RC2-B Sorvall centrifuge using SS-34 rotor. The clear supernatant was collected, and the tissue pellet was extracted two more times with 40 ml each time. The combined extract (∼120 ml) was passed through a DEAE-Sephacel column (1.5 × 25 cm) equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.2, and the column was washed successively with 25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 20 mm NaOAc, 150 mm NaCl, pH 5.5, until absorption of the effluent at 280 nm was at background level. The bound proteoglycan was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.15–0.75 m NaCl in 50 mm NaOAc, 4 m urea, pH 5.5. Fractions (2 ml) were collected, absorption at 260 and 280 nm was measured, and aliquots analyzed for uronic acid content (16Dische Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The uronic acid-containing fractions were combined, dialyzed, and lyophilized. The yield of crude proteoglycan was 16 mg. Purification of the CSPG by Cesium Bromide Density Gradient Centrifugation—The proteoglycan preparation from the DEAE-Sephacel chromatography of the placental extract was dissolved (2 mg/ml) in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 50 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3,4 m GdnHCl, and 42% (w/w) CsBr. The solutions were centrifuged (8 ml/tube) in a Beckman 50 TI rotor at 44,000 rpm for 65 h at 14 °C (17Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). Gradients were fractionated from the bottom of the tubes into 15 equal portions, absorption at 260 and 280 nm was measured, and uronic acid contents were determined (16Dische Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The uronic acid-positive fractions were pooled, dialyzed, and lyophilized; yield was 7.5 mg. Purification of the CSPG by Size Exclusion Chromatography—The proteoglycan partially purified by CsBr density centrifugation was chromatographed on a column of Sepharose CL-6B (2 × 65 cm) in 50 mm NaOAc, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.0, containing 4 m GdnHCl. Fractions (2 ml) were collected and monitored for proteins by measuring absorption at 280 nm, and aliquots were analyzed for uronic acid contents (16Dische Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); yield was 4.9 mg. Isolation of the CS Chains of Rat Placental CSPG—The purified CSPG (0.6 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m NaOH, 1 m NaBH4 and incubated at 45 °C for 24 h under nitrogen (18Carlson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 616-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The solution was cooled in an ice bath, neutralized with 1 m HOAc, and dried in a rotary evaporator. Boric acid was removed by repeated evaporation with 0.1% acetic acid in methanol. The residue was dissolved in 0.2 m NaCl and chromatographed on a Sepharose CL-6B column (1 × 49 cm) in 0.2 m NaCl. Fractions (0.67 ml) were collected, and aliquots were assayed for uronic acid content (16Dische Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions containing the CS chains were combined, dialyzed (molecular weight cut-off 3,500) against distilled water, and lyophilized. Carbohydrate Composition Analysis—The purified proteoglycan or the CS chains (5–10 μg each) released by alkaline β-elimination of the CSPG were hydrolyzed with 400 μl of 4 m HCl at 100 °C for 4 h, and the hydrolysates were dried in a SpeedVac and analyzed for hexosamines. For analysis of neutral sugar in the core proteins, the purified CSPG was treated with protease-free chondroitinase ABC (see below) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 15% gels, and the protein bands in the gels were transferred onto PVDF membranes, stained for 30 s with 0.1% Coomassie Blue in 40% MeOH and 1% AcOH, and destained with 50% MeOH. The membrane portions corresponding to the protein bands were cut into pieces, suspended in 400 μl of 2.5 m trifluoroacetic acid and hydrolyzed at 100 °C for 5 h, and the hydrolysates were dried as above. The hydrolysates from both procedures were analyzed on a CarboPac PA1 high pH anion exchange column (4 × 250 mm) using a Dionex BioLC HPLC system with a pulsed amperometric detector (19Hardy M.R. Townsend R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The elution was performed with 20 mm sodium hydroxide, and the response factors for the monosaccharides were determined using standard sugar solutions. Treatment with Chondroitinases—For GAG chain analysis, the purified CSPG or GAG chains obtained by alkaline β-elimination (100 μg) were treated with chondroitinase ABC (20 milliunits) in 50 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 30 mm NaOAc and 0.01% BSA at 37 °C for 5 h (20Oike Y. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Nakazawa K. Suzuki S. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The CSPG (50 μg) was also treated with chondroitinase AC II (200 milliunits) in 50 μl of 100 mm NaOAc, pH 6.0, containing 0.01% BSA at 37 °C for 30 min (21Saito H. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1536-1542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disaccharide Compositional Analysis of GAGs—The GAGs (10–15 μg), obtained by the treatment of the purified proteoglycan with 0.1 m NaOH, 1 m NaBH4, followed by Sepharose CL-6B chromatography, were digested with chondroitinase ABC (5 milliunits) as above. The released unsaturated disaccharides were analyzed on a 4.6 × 250-mm amine-bonded silica PA03 column (YMC Inc., Milford, MA), using a Waters 600E HPLC system (Milford, MA), and eluted with a linear gradient of 16–530 mm NaH2PO4 over 70 min at room temperature at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (22Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The elution of disaccharides was measured by recording the absorption at 232 nm with a Waters 484 variable wavelength UV detector. The data were processed with the Millennium 2010 chromatography manager using NEC PowerMate 433 data processing system. Analysis of the CSPG Core Protein by SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—The purified CSPG (100 μg) was treated with protease-free chondroitinase ABC (20 milliunits; protease inhibitors were also added to the incubation mixture as a precaution) in 100 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, 30 mm NaOAc, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 6 h (20Oike Y. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Nakazawa K. Suzuki S. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The enzyme digest corresponding to 20 μg of CSPG and 30 μg of untreated CSPG was electrophoresed on 4–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels under reducing conditions using 2-mercaptoethanol. The gels were stained sequentially with Coomassie Blue followed by Alcian Blue. For Western blot analysis, the protein bands (corresponding to 6 μg of CSPG) on gels were transferred onto PVDF membranes, and the membranes blocked with 1% BSA in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% Tween 20. The membranes were incubated with 1:1000 diluted rabbit anti-SSP antiserum, and the bound antibodies were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate color-developing reagent. NH2-terminal Sequencing of the CSPG Core Proteins—The core proteins released from the purified CSPG (100 μg) by protease-free chondroitinase ABC (20 milliunits) were electrophoresed (20 μg CSPG/well) on 15% gels under reducing conditions. The protein bands on gels were transferred onto PVDF membranes using 10 mm 3-(cyclohexylamino)propane sulfonic acid buffer, pH 11.0, containing 10% methanol. The membranes were stained with Ponceau S, and the protein bands were cut out and sequenced by the Edman degradation method at the protein sequencing facility of the Penn State University College of Medicine using Applied Biosystems Procise 491 peptide sequencer. Analysis of Nonglycosylated and CSPG Form of SSP in Rat Placenta—The isotonic buffer extracts of rat placentas were analyzed on 15% polyacrylamide minigels before and after treatment with protease-free chondroitinase ABC, and the protein bands in the gels were transferred onto PVDF membranes. The membranes were treated with 1:1000-diluted rabbit anti-SSP antiserum followed by 1:2000 diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The bound secondary antibody was detected using chemiluminescence substrate. Other Analytical Procedures—The uronic acid contents were determined by the Dische method (16Dische Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein contents were estimated by using the micro-BCA protein estimation kit from Pierce (23Redinbaugh M.G. Turley R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 153: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). P. falciparum Culture—The C4S adherent P. falciparum were panselected from a 3D7 parasite clone as described earlier (24Alkhalil A. Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40357-40364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Parasites were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 29 mm sodium bicarbonate, 0.005% hypoxanthine, p-aminobenzoic acid (2 mg/liter), gentamycin sulfate (50 mg/liter), and 10% O+ human serum using type O+ human red blood cells at 3% hematocrit (24Alkhalil A.

The cultures were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 90% nitrogen, 5% oxygen, and 5% carbon dioxide. Parasites with 20–30% parasitemia at the early trophozoite stage were used for the IRBC binding and inhibition assays. IRBC Adherence Assay—The assay was performed as described previously (24Alkhalil A. Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40357-40364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified rat placental CSPGs at various concentrations were coated onto plastic Petri dishes as 0.4-cm circular spots, blocked with 2% BSA in PBS, pH 7.2, and then overlaid with a 2% suspension of parasite culture in PBS, pH 7.2. The unbound IRBCs and RBCs were washed with PBS, and the bound IRBCs were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde. The bound IRBCs were stained with Giemsa and examined under the light microscope. IRBC Adherence Inhibition Assay—Solutions (1 μg/ml) of the purified rat placental CSPG were coated onto plastic plates as 4-mm circular spots, and the spots were blocked with 2% BSA. The IRBC suspensions in PBS, pH 7.2, were preincubated with the indicated amounts of partially sulfated C4S (40% 4-sulfate, 59% nonsulfated, and 1% 6-sulfate), C6S, chondroitin, or hyaluronic acid at room temperature for 30 min with occasional mixing. The cell suspensions were overlaid onto the CSPG-coated spots and allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min. After washing the unbound cells, the bound cells were fixed, stained, and counted by light microscopy. Isolation and Purification of the Extracellular Proteoglycan of Rat Placenta—DEAE-Sephacel chromatography of the isotonic buffer extracts of the placentas from 20- or 21-day-old pregnant rats using a 0.15–0.75 m NaCl gradient eluted the uronic acid-containing material (proteoglycan) as a single homogeneous peak at 0.35 m NaCl (Fig. 1). Final elution of the column with 1.2 m NaCl did not elute any uronic acid-containing material (not shown). Upon CsBr gradient centrifugation, the proteoglycan was fractionated as a broad peak to the middle of the density gradient, separating from most of the associated proteins, which remained at the top of the gradient (Fig. 2). Upon further purification by size exclusion chromatography on Sepharose CL-6B column, the proteoglycan was eluted as a single but somewhat asymmetrical peak (Kav = 0.67) with an estimated average molecular weight of ∼120,000 (Fig. 3). The yield and composition of the proteoglycan is given in Table 1. The presence of protein, uronic acid, and hexosamine in high amounts is consistent with the proteoglycan nature of the purified material from rat placentas.FIGURE 2Purification of rat placental CSPG by CsBr density gradient centrifugation. The rat placental CSPG, isolated by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography (Fig. 1), was dissolved in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 4 m GdnHCl, 0.02% sodium azide, and 42% CsBr. The solutions were centrifuged in a Beckman 50 TI rotor at 44,000 rpm for 65 h at 14 °C. The gradients were collected into 15 equal fractions from the bottom of the tube, and the aliquots were monitored for uronic acid (•) and protein (○).

Open table in a new tab Characterization of the GAG Chains of Rat Placental Blood Space Proteoglycan—The carbohydrate compositional analysis revealed that the purified proteoglycan contains >99% GalN and a trace amount of GlcN (Table 1). Upon treatment with chondroitinase ABC or chondroitinase AC II, the GAG chains were quantitatively converted into disaccharides (not shown). These results indicated that the proteoglycan is a CSPG. The CSPG was subjected to alkaline β-elimination using NaOH/NaBH4, and the released CS chains were purified by gel filtration on a Sepharose CL-6B column calibrated with chondroitin sulfates of known molecular weight (Fig. 4). The CS chains of the CSPG were eluted as a single symmetrical peak with an estimated molecular weight of ∼40,000. Digestion of the CSPG with chondroitinase ABC and HPLC analysis of the disaccharides formed showed that the CS chains consist of 2% 4-sulfated and 98% nonsulfated disaccharides, demonstrating that the CS chains of the CSPG are extremely low sulfated, resembling nonsulfated chondroitin chains (Table 1). Characterization of Core Proteins of the Rat Placental CSPG—Upon SDS-PAGE analysis, the purified CSPG was electrophoresed as two partially separated broad bands with mobility corresponding to molecular weights of 60,000–80,000 (average ∼70,000) and 80,000–180,000 (∼130,000) (Fig. 5A). The core proteins released by the treatment of the purified CSPG with chondroitinase ABC were electrophoresed as a doublet corresponding to molecular mass of ∼17 and ∼18 kDa (Fig. 5A). The relative abundance of the 17- and 18-kDa core protein bands in gels, as assessed by the densitometric scan, was ∼57 and ∼43%, respectively (Fig. 5B). The NH"
