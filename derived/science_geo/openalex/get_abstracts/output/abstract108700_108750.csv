https://openalex.org/W2042978244,"S.B. Prusiner proposed that the infectious agent of scraple, the prion, is PrPSc, a modified form of the normal host protein PrPC. Prn-p0/0 mice devoid of PrPC showed normal development and behavior. When inoculated with mouse scrapie prions, they remained free of scrapie symptoms for at least 13 months while wild-type controls all died within 6 months. Surprisingly, heterozygous Prn-p0/+ mice also showed enhanced resistance to scrapie. After introduction of Syrian hamster PrP transgenes, Prn-p0/0 mice became highly susceptible to hamster but not to mouse prions. These experiments show that PrPC, possibly at close to normal levels, is required for the usual susceptibility to scrapie and that lack of homology between incoming prions and the host's PrP genes retards disease."
https://openalex.org/W2021569785,"Nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) may act as retrograde messages for long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. Zinc protoporphyrin IX, an inhibitor of the enzyme that produces CO, blocked induction of LTP in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices. Application of either NO or CO to slices produced a rapid and long-lasting increase in the size of evoked synaptic potentials if, and only if, the application occurred at the same time as weak tetanic stimulation. This long-term enhancement was spatially restricted to synapses from active presynaptic fibers and appeared to involve mechanisms utilized by LTP, occluding the subsequent induction of LTP by strong tetanic stimulation. The enhancement by NO and CO was not blocked by an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker, suggesting that NO and CO act downstream from the NMDA receptor. Also, CO produced long-term enhancement when paired with low-frequency stimulation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that NO and CO, either alone or in combination, serve as retrograde messages that produce activity-dependent presynaptic enhancement during LTP."
https://openalex.org/W2091638124,"CD26, the T cell activation molecule dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), associates with a 43-kilodalton protein. Amino acid sequence analysis and immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that this 43-kilodalton protein was adenosine deaminase (ADA). ADA was coexpressed with CD26 on the Jurkat T cell lines, and an in vitro binding assay showed that the binding was through the extracellular domain of CD26. ADA deficiency causes severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) in humans. Thus, ADA and CD26 (DPPIV) interact on the T cell surface, and this interaction may provide a clue to the pathophysiology of SCID caused by ADA deficiency."

By adoptive transfer of cloned T cell lines, direct evidence is provided that both TH1 and TH2 subsets of CD4+ T cells can protect mice against Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi infection. TH1 cells protect by a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism, whereas TH2 cells protect by the enhancement and accelerated production of specific immunoglobulin G1 antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1512720139,"A cDNA was isolated from human brain that encodes an amino acid sequence 34-39% identical to previously published glutamate transporter sequences. Injection of RNA transcribed from this cDNA into Xenopus oocytes resulted in expression of a transport activity with the properties of the neutral amino acid uptake system ASC. Superfusion of alanine, serine, and cysteine evoked sodium-dependent inward currents in voltage-clamped oocytes expressing the transporter. These currents were dose-dependent, stereospecific, and saturable, with Km values ranging from 29 to 88 microM. Northern blot analyses revealed ubiquitous expression of this gene, termed ASCT1, consistent with the general metabolic role ascribed to system ASC."
https://openalex.org/W2127518311,"The T(X, Y)V7 rearrangement in Drosophila has originally been recognized as a Shaker-like mutant because of its behavioral and electrophysiological phenotype. The gene whose expression is altered by the V7 rearrangement has been characterized. It encodes a novel Ca2+-binding protein named frequenin, which is related to recoverin and visinin. In vitro, the frequenin protein functions like recoverin as a Ca2+-sensitive guanylyl cyclase activator. Anti-frequenin antibodies stain the central and peripheral nervous system in Drosophila embryos and in larval and adult tissue sections. Frequenin appears to be particularly enriched in synapses, such as the motor nerve endings at neuromuscular junctions. Neuromuscular junctions of transgenic flies, which overexpress frequenin upon heat shock, exhibit an extraordinarily enhanced, frequency-dependent facilitation of neurotransmitter release, with properties identical to those observed in V7 junctions. We propose that frequenin represents a new element for the Ca2+-dependent modulation of synaptic efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W1628890212,"The functional expression of P-glycoprotein has been studied in confluent epithelial layers of human Caco-2 cells, a polarized, highly differentiated cell line demonstrating an intestinal absorptive cell phenotype. Expression of P-glycoprotein was localized, by indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibody MRK16, to the apical brush-border, approximately 20 microns above the base of the cells. Functional, high capacity expression of P-glycoprotein in Caco-2 cell layers was demonstrated by the saturable secretion of vinblastine, a typical substrate, from basolateral to apical surfaces: Km 18.99 +/- 5.55 microM, Vmax 1285.9 +/- 281.2 pmol.cm-2 h-1. The direct correlation of apical P-glycoprotein expression with vinblastine net secretory flux was demonstrated by the reduction of this flux after treatment with MRK16 antibodies. Vinblastine secretory flux was also reduced by treatment with verapamil (R- and S-isomers with equal affinity), nifedipine, taxotere, and 1,9-dideoxyforskolin. Kinetic analyses suggest that the inhibition of vinblastine secretory flux by verapamil and nifedipine was competitive, while that by dideoxyforskolin was non-competitive, in nature. The polarized expression and activity of P-glycoprotein in Caco-2 cells is direct evidence for its secretory detoxifying function in the intestine, subserving at least one role of the gastrointestinal epithelial barrier."

https://openalex.org/W2042432241,"In insects and vertebrates, clusters of Antennapedia class homeobox (HOM-C) genes specify anteroposterior body pattern. The nematode C. elegans also contains a small cluster of HOM-C genes, one of which has been shown to specify positional identity. Here we show that two additional C. elegans HOM-C genes also specify positional identity and that together these three HOM-C genes function along the anteroposterior axis in the same order as their homologs in other organisms. Thus, HOM-C-based pattern formation has been conserved in nematodes despite the many differences in morphology and embryology that distinguish them from other phyla. Each C. elegans HOM-C gene is responsible for a distinct body region; however, where their domains overlap, two HOM-C genes can act together to specify the fates of individual cells."
https://openalex.org/W1518703223,"The prion protein (PrPC) is a glycolipid-anchored, cell surface protein of unknown function, a posttranslationally modified isoform of which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of spongiform encephalopathies in man and animals. We report here the novel observation that chPrP, the chicken homologue of mammalian PrPC, constitutively cycles between the cell surface and an endocytic compartment with a transit time of approximately 60 min, as demonstrated by surface iodination and immunofluorescence microscopy. Most (> 95%) of the internalized protein is returned to the cell surface intact, and the remainder is proteolytically cleaved within a highly conserved region in the NH2-terminal half of the molecule. Pulse-chase labeling experiments indicate that while this cleavage is slow, with a rate of approximately 1%/h, the COOH-terminal fragment produced is stable and accumulates on the cell surface for as long as 24 h. The cleavage is likely to take place in an acidified endocytic compartment, since it is reduced by lysosomotropic amines and inhibitors of lysosomal proteases. Our results raise the possibility that chPrP, and perhaps other PrPCs, function as cell surface receptors, and they suggest cellular pathways that might be involved in the generation of the pathogenic isoform."
https://openalex.org/W2053274278,"Type I diabetes is an autoimmune disease involving an interaction between an epigenetic event (possibly a viral infection), the pancreatic beta cells, and the immune system in a genetically susceptible host. The possibility that the type I interferons could mediate this interaction was tested with transgenic mice in which the insulin-producing beta cells expressed an interferon-alpha. These mice developed a hypoinsulinemic diabetes associated with a mixed inflammation centered on the islets. The inflammation and the diabetes were prevented with a neutralizing antibody to the interferon-alpha. Thus, the expression of interferon-alpha by the beta cells could be causal in the development of type I diabetes, which suggests a therapeutic approach to this disease."

The gene lin-39 is required for mid-body region-specific development. In lin-39 mutants, mid-body cells express fates characteristic of more anterior or posterior homologs, and the migration of a neuroblast through the mid-body is defective. lin-39 acts cell autonomously in these mid-body cells and in the migrating neuroblast. lin-39 encodes a protein with an Antennapedia class homeodomain, most similar to those of the Drosophila homeotic genes Deformed and Sex combs reduced, and is located in a homeotic gene cluster with two other regional homeotic genes, mab-5 and egl-5. lin-39 and mab-5 function combinatorially in 2 ectodermal cells and have redundant functions in gonad development."

https://openalex.org/W1573563376,"The overall fatty compositions of leaf and root lipids from a mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana were characterized by reduced levels of linolenate (18:3) and correspondingly elevated levels of linoleate (18:2) as a consequence of a single nuclear mutation at the fad3 locus. Comparison of the fatty acid compositions of individual lipids from wild type and mutant plants showed that chloroplast lipids were largely unaffected by the mutation, whereas each of the phospholipids synthesized on the endoplasmic reticulum in the mutant exhibited a marked reduction in the proportion of 18:3 relative to wild type. These and other results indicate that the fad3 mutants are deficient in the activity of an endoplasmic reticulum 18:2 desaturase. In root tissues, this enzyme appears to account for over 80% of the 18:3 present. However, in young leaves of the mutant, phosphatidylcholine (the major phospholipid) contains 16% 18:3 compared with 29% in the wild type, and the proportion of 18:3 in this lipid increases with plant age in both wild type and mutant plants. These results reflect an exchange of lipid between the chloroplast and endoplasmic reticulum that allows the chloroplast desaturases to provide highly unsaturated lipids to the extrachloroplast membranes of leaf cells."

Chem. 263, 9063-9066). The tyrosine hydroxylase gene (TH) contains a single copy of a consensus CRE at -45 to -38 base pair (bp) upstream of the transcription initiation site. Deletional and mutational analyses of the upstream 2400-base pair region of the rat TH gene using transient transfection assay demonstrated that the CRE was essential for both cAMP-mediated induction and basal transcription of the TH gene. Another domain between -365 and -151 bp, containing the AP1 site, contributed to transcription to a smaller degree. Thus, the CRE appears to play an important dual role as a basal promoter element and an inducible enhancer for TH transcription. Interactions between the DNA binding factors in nuclear extract and CRE-containing oligonucleotides were investigated by gel retardation and competition assays. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the CRE regions of the TH or somatostatin gene gave rise to a pair of distinct protein-DNA complexes with identical mobilities in the gel retardation assay, suggesting that similar nuclear factor(s) might bind to the CREs of the TH and somatostatin genes. This study emphasizes a fundamental role of the CRE in transcriptional activation of the TH gene in catecholaminergic cells."

The identity of the polypeptide at each end of the microtubule is unknown, but structural models predict that the beta-tubulin end contains an exchangeable guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding site. When GTP-coated fluorescent beads were incubated with microtubules, they bound specifically to plus ends, suggesting that tubulin is oriented in microtubules with beta-tubulin toward the plus end."

https://openalex.org/W1569290580,"The ability of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) to transport naturally occurring and synthetic opiate analgesics was investigated. Multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells (B30) were found to accumulate significantly lower amounts of morphine than their drug-sensitive counterparts (B1). This decreased accumulation was reversed upon depletion of cellular stores of ATP. In addition, morphine bound to plasma membranes from B30 cells in a specific, saturable fashion. Verapamil and vinblastine, compounds transported by P-gp, were able to increase accumulation and displace the binding of morphine in B30 cells. In turn, the synthetic opiates meperidine, pentazocine, and methadone were able to increase the accumulation of vinblastine in resistant cells. These compounds were also able to displace the specific binding of vinblastine and the photoaffinity labeling of P-gp in plasma membranes by the radioiodinated anthracycline, iodomycin. The implications of these findings in relation to the distribution, tolerance, and gastrointestinal side effects of opiates are discussed."

The cytotoxic factor is recognized by antibodies to interleukin-2 (IL-2) and has the apparent molecular size of a dimer of IL-2. An enzyme, identified as a nerve transglutaminase, was purified from regenerating optic nerves of fish and was found to catalyze dimerization of human IL-2. The dimerized IL-2, unlike monomeric IL-2, is cytotoxic to oligodendrocytes from rat brain in culture. The results suggest that posttranslational modification of a cytokine can alter its activity. Under conditions in which oligodendrocytes inhibit neuronal regeneration, dimerization of IL-2 might provide a mechanism to permit nerve growth."

As in solution, in the complex the single-stranded DNA folds into a structure with two G-quartets. The DNA is sandwiched between two different positively charged regions of two symmetry-related thrombin molecules in the crystal structure making ionic and hydrophobic interactions. One region is the fibrinogen recognition exosite and the other, the putative heparin binding site. The lack of inhibition of fibrinogen clotting and platelet activation by the DNA 15-mer with the Arg75–>Glu mutant of thrombin is consistent with the several salt bridges of the DNA in the fibrinogen exosite. The association of DNA with the heparin site of a neighboring molecule appears to simply compensate residual charge. Differences in the 15-mer loop conformations between the complex and NMR solution structures can be attributed to conformational changes upon thrombin binding. Although G-quadruplexes are favored in the presence of monovalent cations, there is no evidence of the latter in the thrombin complex."
https://openalex.org/W1598432003,"To investigate the regulation of expression of the human mdr1 gene, the response of the mdr1 promoter to signals involved in cell proliferation was examined. The activity of the mdr1 promoter was measured in transiently transfected NIH 3T3 cells, which were stimulated to enter the cell cycle by addition of serum, platelet-derived growth factor, or transforming growth factor alpha. Addition of serum to quiescent NIH 3T3 cells resulted in a 6-8-fold activation of mdr1 promoter activity, which peaked at 10 h, just prior to S-phase. Treatment of serum-starved cells with the serum mitogens platelet-derived growth factor and transforming growth factor alpha also activated the mdr1 promoter. To define components of the signal cascade resulting in mdr1 promoter activation, the role of c-Raf kinase, a serine/threonine kinase important in mitogen-activated signal transduction, was examined. We measured the effects of a constitutively activated Raf kinase, v-raf, and a dominant negative Raf mutant, c-Raf-C4, on mdr1 promoter activity in NIH 3T3 and HepG2 cells. In serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells, v-raf increased mdr1 promoter activity approximately 10-fold compared to a v-raf frame-shift control. Raf responsiveness of the mdr1 promoter was localized to sequences between -69 and -41, relative to the initiation site. Serum stimulation of the mdr1 promoter was blocked by co-transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with the dominant negative Raf mutant c-Raf-C4. In the human hepatoma cell line HepG2, which has high endogenous Raf kinase activity (Bruder, J. T., Heidecker, G., and Rapp, U. R. (1992) Genes & Dev. 6, 545-556), co-transfection with c-Raf-C4 decreased mdr1 promoter activity 20-fold. Taken together, these data suggest that the mdr1 gene is transcriptionally regulated by normal cellular signaling events involving activation of c-Raf kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2059020778,"The role of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in T cell differentiation was investigated by comparison of thymocyte subpopulations in wild-type mice and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) mutant mice deficient in MHC class I expression and mature CD8+ cells. On the basis of surface markers, glucocorticoid resistance, in vitro differentiation capacity, and absence in beta 2 M-l- mice, CD4intermediateCD8hi cells with high expression of alpha beta T cell receptor (TCR alpha beta) were identified as having been positively selected by MHC class I for development into mature CD8+ T cells. Activated CD4intCD8hi cells bearing intermediate rather than high amounts of TCR were present in both wild-type and beta 2M-l- animals. These data suggest that recognition of MHC class I molecules is required for full maturation to CD8+ T cells, but not for receptor-initiated commitment to the CD8+ lineage, consistent with a stochastic (selection) model of thymocyte development."

https://openalex.org/W1495123229,"P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is a tandemly duplicated plasma membrane protein containing 12 predicted transmembrane (TM) segments and two cytoplasmic ATP-binding domains. Pgp appears to be responsible for multi-drug resistance in cancer cells. A detailed knowledge of the topological structure of Pgp will be required for understanding its mechanism of action. Previously, we have investigated the membrane orientation of Pgp using a cell free translation/translocation system supplemented with canine pancreatic microsomal membranes. We observed unexpectedly that the C-terminal half of the Pgp molecules was present in two different topological orientations (Zhang, J.-T., and Ling, V. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 18224-18232). In the present study, using a similar approach, we have investigated in detail the topological structure of the N-terminal half of the Pgp molecule. Again, two orientations were observed. One has all six predicted TM segments in the membrane bilayer, the other has only four TM segments in the bilayer with predicted TM3 and TM5 in a cytoplasmic and extracellular location, respectively. Although the primary sequence of Pgp appears to be a tandem duplication, the new topological structure of N-terminal half is not a simple tandem duplication of that in the C-terminal half. Thus it appears that the insertion and orientation of Pgp TM segments are dictated by specific localized sequences. These results, together with our previous findings, raise the possibility that Pgp in the native membrane may be present in different topological orientations and this feature may be important for its function."
https://openalex.org/W1528744681,"The transport of L-glutamate into Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing the cloned L-glutamate/L-aspartate transporter (GLAST-1) from rat brain was studied using the voltage clamp technique. At a holding potential of -90 mV, a bath application of 100 microM L-glutamate induced an inward current (IGLAST) with an amplitude ranging from -5 to -30 nA. IGLAST did not require extracellular Ca2+, Mg2+, or Cl-, was larger at negative potentials, and did not reverse up to +80 mV. The current was dependent on external L-glutamate and Na+ with half-maximal amplitudes at 11 microM L-glutamate and 41 mM Na+. IGLAST saturated at 100 microM L-glutamate and 80 mM Na+. The Hill coefficient for Na+ and L-glutamate was 3.3 and 1.3, respectively, suggesting that 3 Na+ accompany the transport of 1 L-glutamate molecule. At low [Na+]o, IGLAST was enhanced by reducing [K+]o, an indication for the countertransport of K+. Reducing external pH from 7.4 to 6.0 did not change the amplitude of IGLAST. This argues against a glutamate/proton cotransport. The results provide evidence for GLAST-1 carrying out a high affinity, sodium-dependent L-glutamate transport with a proposed stoichiometry of 3 Na+, 1 L-glutamate-/1 K+."
https://openalex.org/W2041588129,"l-Glutamate inhibits the K+ conductance that dominates the electrical behavior of a Miller glial cell. The effect of glutamate is enhanced by simultaneous exposure to dopamine. l-Glutamate acts at a metabotropic receptor that controls the K+ conductance through two pathways. A rapid pathway produces a partial inhibition in less than 2 s. Thereafter, a slow pathway progressively inhibits the conductance with a half-time of minutes. Pathways initiated by l-glutamate and dopamine appear to converge on and stimulate adenylyl cyclase. A subsequent step is the activation of a CAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA. The local overflow of l-glutamate from active synapses may functionally remove K+ channels from nearby glial membranes. A uniform rise in extracellular l-glutamate concentration, as might occur during pathological conditions, should suppress a glial cell's K+ conductance and allow other voltage-dependent processes to be influenced by depolarization."
https://openalex.org/W2169004092,"Dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP IV, CD26, EC 3.4.14.5), a multifunctional ectoenzyme, is involved not only in the proteolytic cleavage of X-Pro from the NH2 terminus of a variety of biologically active peptides, but also in activation signal transduction and cell matrix adherence processes. We recently characterized mouse DPP IV cDNA and identified the serine protease Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly consensus motif in its extracellular domain. Mouse DPP IV does not exhibit sequence similarity with any of the classical members of this enzyme family (e.g. chymotrypsin and subtilisin) but shares a conserved structural domain of approximately 200 amino acids with several nonclassical serine hydrolases. In this study, analysis of the similarity of secondary structures and amino acid sequences between these enzymes led us to identify several conserved residues likely to be involved in the catalytic site of these DPP IV-related enzymes. These amino acids (Ser624, Asp702, and His734) were found to be arranged in a novel sequential order as compared with that of archetypal serine proteases (e.g. nucleophile (Ser)-acid-His versus His-acid-nucleophile (Ser), respectively). To directly explore the involvement of these residues in the catalytic function of these enzymes, we performed in vitro site-directed mutagenesis on mouse DPP IV cDNA. Our results indicate that although conservative or non-conservative permutations at these positions do not significantly alter the surface expression and biochemical properties of the mutant molecules, they completely impair their DPP IV enzymatic function. In contrast, mutagenesis of two other aspartic residues (Asp599 and Asp657), also conserved between these DPP IV-related enzymes, did not affect the enzymatic properties of the mouse enzyme. These data provide evidence that DPP IV and its related enzymes belong to a novel family that displays a catalytic triad distinct from that of the classical serine proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1545393999,"An alteration in signal transduction systems in Alzheimer's disease would likely be of pathophysiological significance, because these steps are critical to normal brain function. Since dynamic processes are difficult to study in autopsied brain, the current studies utilized cultured skin fibroblasts. The beta-adrenergic-stimulated increase in cAMP was reduced approximately 80% in fibroblasts from Alzheimer's disease compared with age-matched controls. The deficit in Alzheimer fibroblasts in response to various adrenergic agonists paralleled their beta-adrenergic potency, and enhancement of cAMP accumulation by a non-adrenergic agonist, such as prostaglandin E1, was similar in Alzheimer and control fibroblasts. Diminished adenylate cyclase activity did not underlie these abnormalities, since direct stimulation of adenylate cyclase by forskolin elevated cAMP production equally in Alzheimer and control fibroblasts. Cholera toxin equally stimulated cAMP formation in Alzheimer and control fibroblasts. Moreover, cholera toxin partially reduced isoproterenol-induced cAMP deficit in Alzheimer fibroblasts. Pertussis toxin, on the other hand, did not alter the Alzheimer deficits. The results suggest either that the coupling of the GTP-binding protein(s) to the beta-adrenergic receptor is abnormal or that the sensitivity of receptor is altered with Alzheimer's disease. Further, any hypothesis about Alzheimer's disease must explain why a reduced beta-adrenergic-stimulated cAMP formation persists in tissue culture."
https://openalex.org/W1548701780,"Nonspecific cross-reacting antigen (NCA), a CD66 cluster antigen, is a well characterized glycoprotein on granulocytes, macrophages, and lung epithelium. Structural studies at the protein and genomic levels have revealed that NCA is a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) supergene family and contains a domain structure similar to Ig with an amino-terminal variable-like domain followed by disulfide loop-containing constant-like domains. Previous work by this laboratory and others has demonstrated that NCA is a receptor for binding of bacteria expressing type 1 fimbriae (pili). This binding is mediated by interaction between lectins on the bacteria fimbriae and carbohydrate chains on NCA. In the present work we further characterize the specificity for bacterial binding by NCA using endoglycosidases and site-directed mutagenesis. Results of these studies demonstrate that Escherichia coli expressing type 1 fimbriae binds to high mannose oligosaccharide structures on NCA and that the functionally relevant sites are located in the variable-like domain of NCA."
https://openalex.org/W1538239244,"Sf9 cells infected with a baculovirus vector containing SERCA1 cDNA expressed immunoreactive rabbit fast-twitch muscle Ca(2+)-ATPase at levels up to 3 mg/liter. The microsomal fraction isolated from infected Sf9 cells catalyzed Ca2+ transport at rates 6-fold above control values. To obtain direct evidence for the postulate (Clarke, D. M., Loo, T. W., Inesi, G., and MacLennan, D. H., et al. (1989) Nature 339, 476-478) that Glu309 contributes to a Ca(2+)-binding site in the transmembrane sector of the Ca(2+)-ATPase, Ca2+ binding to wild type and mutant (Glu309 to Gln) Ca(2+)-ATPases was measured. The wild type Ca(2+)-ATPase, expressed in Sf9 cells and purified using a monoclonal antibody bound to Sepharose beads, bound approximately 1.6-1.7 mol Ca2+/mol of enzyme at 2 microM Ca2+ in a buffer favoring the E1 conformation of the enzyme and at 10 microM Ca2+ in a buffer favoring the E2 conformation. Under identical conditions, the mutant Ca(2+)-ATPase bound less than 0.1 mol of Ca2+/mol of enzyme in E1 buffer, but 0.8 mol Ca2+/mol in the E2 buffer. In spite of the ability of the Glu309 to Gln mutant enzyme to bind about 1 mol of Ca2+/mol of enzyme, E2P formation was not inhibited by up to 100 microM Ca2+, and E1P formation from ATP and Ca2+ was not observed with up to 100 microM Ca2+ in intact microsomal vesicles from Sf9 cells. Nevertheless, with detergent-solubilized and purified mutant Ca(2+)-ATPases, E2P formation was inhibited with a K0.5 of 2 microM Ca2+. These observations are consistent with the view that a single intact Ca(2+)-binding site is present in the mutant Ca(2+)-ATPase, which is accessible to Ca2+ only from the lumenal side and only in the E2 conformation. Transition from E2 to E1-Ca2+ may occur during or following Ca2+ binding, accounting for the relatively high Ca2+ affinity and inhibition by Ca2+ of phosphorylation from Pi."

https://openalex.org/W1919508155,"Insulin induction of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and differentiation of 30A5 preadipocytes into adipocytes requires a brief exposure of the cells to cAMP. Using the techniques of DNase I footprinting, DNA band shift, and analysis of the point and deletion mutations, a region from -113 to -95 has been identified as the site through which cAMP sensitizes the cell for the response to insulin. One sequence-specific DNA-protein complex, b3, is formed in the DNA-mobility shift assay when nuclear extract from 30A5 cells is mixed with the oligonucleotide representing this region. Purified human AP-2 also generates the complex corresponding to b3 with the same ACC PII probe or with the AP-2 consensus sequence probe from SV40 promoter. Substitution of A for G in the sequence GGGGCTGGG abolishes the formation of b3 sequence-specific complex. Stably transfected 30A5 cells with the same mutations in the plasmid no longer respond to insulin in spite of their exposure to cAMP. These results establish that the 21 base pair region in ACC promoter II and the binding of AP-2 protein to this sequence are required for cAMP action. cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates AP-2 both in vitro and in vivo and the phosphorylation of AP-2 does not affect its binding activity."

Repetitive stimulation of cultured hippocampal neurons loaded with D-glutamate caused a dramatic shortening of both the rising and decaying phases of NMDA receptor excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked by autaptic stimulation. The EPSC time course was mimicked by NMDA receptor currents evoked in outside-out patches by 1-4 ms applications of D-glutamate. Thus, D-glutamate can be released as a false transmitter. The results show that both the rise and fall of the NMDA receptor EPSCs are normally controlled by the slow unbinding rate of the natural neurotransmitter and that the concentration of free transmitter is elevated in the cleft for only a few milliseconds after release."

The 90% DCCD-inhibited enzyme bound [14C]NADPH with undiminished capacity and [14C]NADH with 10% capacity as compared with unmodified enzyme. The Kd values were unaltered. The N-terminal fragment bound [14C]NADH at 0.76 mol/dimer with unaltered Kd but did not bind [14C]NADPH. The C-terminal fragment bound 0.32 mol of [14C]NADPH/dimer with unaltered Kd but did not bind [14C]NADH. These results are consistent with our previous assignment of the NAD(H) and the NADP(H) binding sites to the N- and the C-terminal hydrophilic domains, respectively. The binding stoichiometries of 1 mol each of [14C]NADH and [14C]NADPH/dimeric transhydrogenase suggest half-of-the-sites reactivity, which is consistent with our previous findings that 100% inhibition by either p-[3H]fluorosulfonylbenzoyl-5'-adenosine or [14C]DCCD involved the incorporation of 1 mol of inhibitor/dimeric enzyme. We had shown earlier that N-(ethoxycarbonyl)2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) inhibits the transhydrogenase, apparently at the NAD binding site, but differently from DCCD. The enzyme was protected by 5'-AMP strongly against DCCD and weakly against EEDQ, whereas it was protected by NMNH strongly against EEDQ and not at all against DCCD. We have now determined the EEDQ binding sites to be Glu232 and Glu880. The different mononucleotide protections against DCCD and EEDQ suggest that the AMP moiety of NAD binds near Glu257 and its NMN portion near Glu232. They also suggest that the NMN moiety of NADP may bind near Glu880."
https://openalex.org/W1519038691,"The mechanism of binding of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) to taxol-stabilized microtubules (MTs) was examined through Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding and by immunoelectron microscopy. We demonstrate the following. 1) Binding is a cooperative process as indicated by sigmoidal binding curves, prominent humps in Scatchard plots, and an all-or-none response in binding during ligand titrations. At high tubulin/MAP2 ratios, the Kd for noncontiguous binding (5-25 microM) is estimated to be 100-1500 times greater than that predicted for contiguous binding, suggesting a high degree of cooperativity. 2) Cooperativity is indicated independently by a highly clustered or patchy distribution of MAP2 on MTs as revealed by immunoelectron microscopy. 3) The binding of truncated constructs of mouse MAP2 protein suggests that a domain of MAP2 conferring cooperativity is located in or near the MT binding site near the carboxyl terminus. We speculate that in the cell, cooperativity may generate MTs with uniform biochemical properties and contribute to the segregation of MAPs in neuronal cell processes."
https://openalex.org/W1486496086,"Oil bodies of plant seeds contain a triacylglycerol matrix surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids embedded with alkaline proteins termed oleosins. Although oleosins are amphipathic proteins, they are unlike bilayer membrane proteins since they are associated with a single lipid:water interface at the oil body surface. Oleosins are unusual proteins because they contain a 70-80-residue uninterrupted nonpolar domain, flanked by relative polar C- and N-terminal domains. In the present study, we report the expression of the N-terminal domain of the 18-kDa oleosin isoform from sunflower as a recombinant fusion protein in Escherichia coli and the determination of its secondary structure using CD and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy either as a purified but partially denatured peptide or reconstituted into liposomes. The structure derived from physical studies was then compared and assigned with those predicted from analysis of the primary sequence of the N-terminal domain. Based on data derived from CD spectroscopy analysis of purified and partially renatured N-terminal polypeptide, it contains about 10% alpha-helical structure, 20-30% beta-strand structure, approximately 8% beta-turn structure, and 60% random coil structure. However, analysis of the polypeptide reconstituted into liposomes showed an increased content of alpha-helical structure to about 20% and an increased beta-strand structure content to about 30-40%. Data derived from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies and compared with the data predicted from the primary sequence showed the peptide is well structured with some antiparallel beta-strand structure from residues 2-9, parallel beta-strand structure from residues 30-37 and/or 42-49, and alpha-helical structure from residues 10-23 and/or 43-49. There is potential amphipathic alpha-helix from residues 10-23. Based on these results, the following model for the secondary structure of the N-terminal domain of sunflower oleosin can be proposed. Residues 2-9 would produce amphipathic antiparallel beta-strand structure. Residues 10-23 would produce an amphipathic alpha-helical structure. Residues 30-37 and/or 42-49 would give parallel beta-strand structure, or residues 42-49 could form a nonpolar alpha-helical structure that would insert into the oil matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1494915472,"Pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase (EC 1.6.1.1) from Escherichia coli was investigated with respect to the role of glutamic and aspartic acid residues reactive to N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) and potentially involved in the proton-pumping mechanism of the enzyme. The E. coli transhydrogenase consists of an alpha (510 residues) and a beta (462 residues) subunit. DCCD reacts with the enzyme to inhibit catalytic activity and proton pumping. This reagent modifies Asp alpha 232, Glu alpha 238, and Glu alpha 240 as well as amino acid residue(s) in the beta subunit. Using the cloned and overexpressed E. coli transhydrogenase genes (Clarke, D. M., and Bragg, P. D. (1985) J. Bacteriol. 162, 367-373), Asp alpha 232 and Glu alpha 238 were replaced independently by site-specific mutagenesis. In addition, Asp alpha 232, Glu alpha 238, and Glu alpha 240 were replaced to generate triple mutants. The specific catalytic activities of the mutant transhydrogenases alpha D232N, alpha D232E, alpha D232K, alpha D232H, alpha E238K, and alpha E238Q as well as of the triple mutants alpha D232N, alpha E238Q, alpha E240Q and alpha D232H, alpha E238Q, alpha E240Q were in the range of 40-90% of the wild-type activity. Proton-pumping activity was present in all mutants. Examination of the extent of subunit modification by [14C]DCCD revealed that the label was still incorporated into both alpha and beta subunits in the Asp alpha 232 mutants, but that the alpha subunit was not labeled in the triple mutants. Catalytic and proton-pumping activities were nearly insensitive to DCCD in the triple mutants. This suggests that loss of catalytic and proton-pumping activities is associated with modification of the aspartic and glutamic acid residues of the alpha subunit. In the presence of the substrate NADPH, the rate of modification of the beta subunit by [14C]DCCD was increased, and there was a greater extent of enzyme inactivation. By contrast, NADH and 3-acetylpyridine-NAD+ protected the catalytic activity of the transhydrogenase from inhibition by DCCD. The protection was particularly marked in the E238Q and E238K mutants. It is concluded that the Asp alpha 232, Glu alpha 238, and Glu alpha 240 residues are not essential for catalytic activity or proton pumping. The inactivation by DCCD is likely due to the introduction of a sterically hindering group that reacts with the identified acidic residues close to the NAD(H)-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1525982503,"Tobacco mosaic virus-infected tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var. Samsun NN) leaves produce a serine proteinase inhibitor that has evolved a specificity for microbial proteinases. We have isolated two closely related cDNAs that were shown to encode two active inhibitors. Southern analysis of genomic DNA, comparison of deduced amino acid sequences, and characterization of the two separated proteins suggest that the two genes of tobacco are homologous originating from each parent. Amino acid sequences deduced from the cDNAs exhibit a glutamic residue at the P1 position of the active site, known to determine the specificity of this type of inhibitors. Nevertheless, the V8 proteinase from Staphylococcus aureus, an enzyme that cleaves polypeptides after glutamic acid residues, was found to be unaffected by the tobacco inhibitor. We demonstrate strong accumulation of the two mRNAs and proteins during the hypersensitive reaction of tobacco to tobacco mosaic virus. Messengers and products of the two genes are present in a 3:2 ratio, in infected leaves as well as in upper uninfected leaves, the induction being markedly lower at distance from the infection site. The transcripts were also found in sepals and petals of healthy plants, indicating that these genes are also developmentally regulated. Unlike the tomato and potato I inhibitors, the tobacco inhibitor was only weakly induced by wounding, but was expressed upon salicylic acid or ethephon treatment, as many pathogenesis-related proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1590325990,"Cys-1 mutants of recombinant human asparagine synthetase were constructed and their ability to catalyze the glutamine-dependent nitrogen transfer reaction required for asparagine biosynthesis was determined. In agreement with previous work, altering Cys-1 to either Ala or Ser eliminated the glutamine-dependent activity while only minimally affecting the kinetic properties of the ammonia-dependent reaction. A lack of glutaminase activity in these mutants also allowed examination of glutamine binding in studies of the ability of glutamine to inhibit the ammonia-dependent production of asparagine. In both mutants, analysis of the observed kinetics indicated that glutamine inhibited ammonia-dependent asparagine synthesis through the formation of an abortive complex. This unanticipated observation suggests that the commonly accepted mechanism for nitrogen transfer from the primary amide of glutamine to aspartic acid in asparagine synthetase may have to be re-examined. A novel mechanistic proposal which is consistent with the formation of an abortive complex in the two Cys-1 mutants is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1578896704,"For many in vitro protein-folding reactions, the fraction of correctly folded product declines as the initial protein concentration increases due primarily to misfolding and aggregation reactions. Under optimal conditions and in the presence of ATP, chaperonins (groEL and groES) enhanced the renaturation of dodecameric glutamine synthetase (GS) with yields of active enzyme between 75 and 85% of the original activity (Fisher, M.T. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 3955-3963). In spite of this enhancement, a concentration-dependent decline in recoverable activity was observed when increasing concentrations of unfolded GS were rapidly mixed with renaturation buffer containing a 2-fold molar excess (GS subunits:groEL oligomer) of chaperonins. When a stable groEL-GS complex, formed under optimal conditions, was concentrated 4-fold by centrifugal ultrafiltration prior to ATP addition, the amount of total active GS (percent of the original activity) recovered remained at optimal levels and no longer showed a concentration-dependent decline. The GS subunits that are initially bound and then released from groEL by ATP are assembly-competent. It is proposed that the subunits are no longer able to kinetically equilibrate with folding intermediates that misfold or aggregate. If a stable groEL-protein substrate complex can be amassed without loss of activity, this will facilitate studies on molecular aspects of chaperonin release mechanisms and oligomeric protein assembly."

https://openalex.org/W1555183220,"The reciliation of Tetrahymena pyriformis cells is accompanied in the first minutes by a transient induction of stress mRNAs, i.e. hsp70 and ubiquitin. At the same time an accentuated and coordinate reduction in the amount of alpha- and beta-tubulin mRNAs is observed as analyzed by Northern blot hybridization using the homologous genomic tubulin probes. Between 60 and 120 min after the onset of reciliation, tubulin transcripts in the cytoplasm reach higher values than in exponentially growing cells. Run-on transcription assays reveal that the decrease in tubulin mRNA levels is not caused by a decrease in transcription of tubulin genes. The results obtained show that the apparent tubulin gene transcription rate is increased in reciliating cells from 15 min up to 90 min. The block of transcription using actinomycin D shows that hsps are not implicated in the destabilization of tubulin mRNA during the first minutes of reciliation. The effects of the inhibitors of protein synthesis, cycloheximide and pactamycin, on tubulin mRNA levels suggest that the translational apparatus plays a role in the stability of tubulin mRNA in cells reciliating for 15 and 30 min. Experiments using the microtubule-polymerizing drug taxol also show that tubulin mRNA destabilization is not a simple consequence of a temporary increase in free tubulin subunit pools resulting from cilia resorption."
https://openalex.org/W1526917323,"Abstract The silk gland of Bombyx mori, an endomitotically replicative tissue shows high levels of DNA polymerases alpha, delta, and epsilon activities. The ratio of polymerase alpha to that of delta plus epsilon is maintained at 1.1 to 1.3 in both the posterior and middle silk glands for the entire duration of late larval development. The three activities copurify in the initial stages of fractionation through phosphocellulose and DE52 but polymerase alpha gets resolved from the others on hydroxylapatite column. Separation between polymerase delta and epsilon is achieved by chromatography on QAE-Sephadex. DNA polymerase epsilon is a heterodimer comprising of 215- and 42-kDa subunits. The activity is maximum at pH 6.5 and the Km values for dNTPs vary between 3-9 microM. The enzyme possesses an intrinsically associated exonuclease activity which functions in the mismatch repair during DNA synthesis. Both polymerase and 3'-->5' exonuclease activities are associated with the 215-kDa subunit. By itself, DNA polymerase epsilon is processive and the catalytic activity is not enhanced by externally added bPCNA (Bombyx-proliferating cell nuclear antigen, an auxiliary protein for DNA polymerase delta). The enzyme resembles polymerase delta in having the exonuclease activity and in its response to aphidicolin or substrate analogs, but could be distinguished from the latter by its lack of response to the bPCNA and sensitivity to dimethyl sulfoxide. The two enzymes show partial immunological cross-reactivity with each other but no immunological relatedness to polymerase alpha. The absence of the repair enzyme DNA polymerase beta and the presence of substantial levels of polymerase epsilon in the silk glands suggest a possible role for the latter in DNA repair in that tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1495428213,"Purified Gs is a substrate for ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by cholera toxin (CTx). In S49 cyc- membranes complemented with in vitro translated Gs alpha, the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol enhanced the ADP-ribosylation rate. This effect was maximal if all guanyl nucleotides were suppressed but was blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist alprenolol. Enhancement was partially diminished if addition of GDP followed that of isoproterenol. When added in the absence of agonist, the GTP analogues guanosine 5‘-O-(gamma-thiotriphosphate) and guanosine 5‘-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate potentiated CTx-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gs alpha consistent with their activating ADP-ribosylation factors. However, this effect was lessened when the same nucleotides were tested in the presence of agonist. Taken altogether, these results indicate that like Gt and Gi, Gs is an optimal substrate for CTx when coupled to an agonist-activated receptor and depleted of nucleotide. Therefore, coupling to the receptor and subsequent departure of the GDP turn out to be the common features underlying the sensitivity of all GTP-binding proteins to CTx-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1596036934,"Various protein isoforms have been identified for human apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV). However, investigations of their physiological effects have been limited because of low frequencies for many of the apoA-IV variants. Recent discovery of extensive variation in baboon apoA-IV using isoelectric focusing (IEF) makes this primate species an excellent model for genetic studies of apoA-IV. In this study, the molecular basis for net charge differences between two common apoA-IV isoforms (I and E) was determined by cloning and sequencing of intestinal cDNAs from homozygous baboons. An A-->G substitution was found in the third amphipathic repeat of the E isoform. This substitution causes a Lys-->Glu substitution at amino acid position 76 (Lys76-->Glu), adding two negative charges to the E isoform compared to the I isoform, consistent with their relative mobilities on IEF gels. Restriction isotyping was used to identify the substitution in leukocyte DNA from 15 baboons that had been typed by IEF, thus verifying Lys76-->Glu as the basis for the charge differences between the I and E isoforms. Physiological effects of the Lys76-->Glu substitution on high density lipoprotein-C levels were investigated in 431 baboons carrying the E and I isoforms. These studies revealed that the I isoform was associated with higher levels of high density lipoprotein-C on a high cholesterol, saturated fat diet (p = 0.04). The cDNA sequences showed that the carboxyl terminus of baboon apoA-IV contains a region of hydrophilic repeats (Glu-Gln-X-Gln) that is the largest yet found in any species (nine repeats compared to three to five repeats in human, mouse, and rat). A common length polymorphism was identified that inserts a single amino acid to form a five amino acid repeat. This is the first report of this type of length variation (insertion of a single amino acid rather than insertion of an entire repeat) in this region. In addition, a rare variant was found that inserts an entire four-amino-acid repeat, similar to the human apoA-IV-0 isoform."
