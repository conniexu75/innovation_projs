https://openalex.org/W2953641512,"The overwhelming majority of scientific knowledge is published as text, which is difficult to analyse by either traditional statistical analysis or modern machine learning methods. By contrast, the main source of machine-interpretable data for the materials research community has come from structured property databases1,2, which encompass only a small fraction of the knowledge present in the research literature. Beyond property values, publications contain valuable knowledge regarding the connections and relationships between data items as interpreted by the authors. To improve the identification and use of this knowledge, several studies have focused on the retrieval of information from scientific literature using supervised natural language processing3–10, which requires large hand-labelled datasets for training. Here we show that materials science knowledge present in the published literature can be efficiently encoded as information-dense word embeddings11–13 (vector representations of words) without human labelling or supervision. Without any explicit insertion of chemical knowledge, these embeddings capture complex materials science concepts such as the underlying structure of the periodic table and structure–property relationships in materials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an unsupervised method can recommend materials for functional applications several years before their discovery. This suggests that latent knowledge regarding future discoveries is to a large extent embedded in past publications. Our findings highlight the possibility of extracting knowledge and relationships from the massive body of scientific literature in a collective manner, and point towards a generalized approach to the mining of scientific literature. Natural language processing algorithms applied to three million materials science abstracts uncover relationships between words, material compositions and properties, and predict potential new thermoelectric materials."
https://openalex.org/W2954434934,"The mammalian brain contains neurogenic niches that comprise neural stem cells and other cell types. Neurogenic niches become less functional with age, but how they change during ageing remains unclear. Here we perform single-cell RNA sequencing of young and old neurogenic niches in mice. The analysis of 14,685 single-cell transcriptomes reveals a decrease in activated neural stem cells, changes in endothelial cells and microglia, and an infiltration of T cells in old neurogenic niches. T cells in old brains are clonally expanded and are generally distinct from those in old blood, which suggests that they may experience specific antigens. T cells in old brains also express interferon-γ, and the subset of neural stem cells that has a high interferon response shows decreased proliferation in vivo. We find that T cells can inhibit the proliferation of neural stem cells in co-cultures and in vivo, in part by secreting interferon-γ. Our study reveals an interaction between T cells and neural stem cells in old brains, opening potential avenues through which to counteract age-related decline in brain function."
https://openalex.org/W2955245896,"Synthetic biology is driving a new era of medicine through the genetic programming of living cells1,2. This transformative approach allows for the creation of engineered systems that intelligently sense and respond to diverse environments, ultimately adding specificity and efficacy that extends beyond the capabilities of molecular-based therapeutics3-6. One particular area of focus has been the engineering of bacteria as therapeutic delivery systems to selectively release therapeutic payloads in vivo7-11. Here we engineered a non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain to specifically lyse within the tumor microenvironment and release an encoded nanobody antagonist of CD47 (CD47nb)12, an anti-phagocytic receptor that is commonly overexpressed in several human cancer types13,14. We show that delivery of CD47nb by tumor-colonizing bacteria increases activation of tumor-infiltrating T cells, stimulates rapid tumor regression, prevents metastasis and leads to long-term survival in a syngeneic tumor model in mice. Moreover, we report that local injection of CD47nb-expressing bacteria stimulates systemic tumor-antigen-specific immune responses that reduce the growth of untreated tumors, providing proof-of-concept for an abscopal effect induced by an engineered bacterial immunotherapy. Thus, engineered bacteria may be used for safe and local delivery of immunotherapeutic payloads leading to systemic antitumor immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2955088726,"Silicon dominates contemporary solar cell technologies1. But when absorbing photons, silicon (like other semiconductors) wastes energy in excess of its bandgap2. Reducing these thermalization losses and enabling better sensitivity to light is possible by sensitizing the silicon solar cell using singlet exciton fission, in which two excited states with triplet spin character (triplet excitons) are generated from a photoexcited state of higher energy with singlet spin character (a singlet exciton)3-5. Singlet exciton fission in the molecular semiconductor tetracene is known to generate triplet excitons that are energetically matched to the silicon bandgap6-8. When the triplet excitons are transferred to silicon they create additional electron-hole pairs, promising to increase cell efficiencies from the single-junction limit of 29 per cent to as high as 35 per cent9. Here we reduce the thickness of the protective hafnium oxynitride layer at the surface of a silicon solar cell to just eight angstroms, using electric-field-effect passivation to enable the efficient energy transfer of the triplet excitons formed in the tetracene. The maximum combined yield of the fission in tetracene and the energy transfer to silicon is around 133 per cent, establishing the potential of singlet exciton fission to increase the efficiencies of silicon solar cells and reduce the cost of the energy that they generate."
https://openalex.org/W2954384525,"Defining the transcriptomic identity of malignant cells is challenging in the absence of surface markers that distinguish cancer clones from one another, or from admixed non-neoplastic cells. To address this challenge, here we developed Genotyping of Transcriptomes (GoT), a method to integrate genotyping with high-throughput droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing. We apply GoT to profile 38,290 CD34+ cells from patients with CALR-mutated myeloproliferative neoplasms to study how somatic mutations corrupt the complex process of human haematopoiesis. High-resolution mapping of malignant versus normal haematopoietic progenitors revealed an increasing fitness advantage with myeloid differentiation of cells with mutated CALR. We identified the unfolded protein response as a predominant outcome of CALR mutations, with a considerable dependency on cell identity, as well as upregulation of the NF-κB pathway specifically in uncommitted stem cells. We further extended the GoT toolkit to genotype multiple targets and loci that are distant from transcript ends. Together, these findings reveal that the transcriptional output of somatic mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms is dependent on the native cell identity. Profiling of over 38,000 CD34+ cells from patients with CALR-mutated myeloproliferative neoplasms, using the ‘Genotyping of Transcriptomes’ procedure, reveals that the transcriptional output of these mutations depends upon native cell identity."
https://openalex.org/W3099440104,"After close to two decades of research and development, superconducting circuits have emerged as a rich platform for both quantum computation and quantum simulation. Lattices of superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators have been shown to produce artificial materials for microwave photons, where weak interactions can be introduced either via non-linear resonator materials or strong interactions via qubit-resonator coupling. Here, we highlight the previously-overlooked property that these lattice sites are deformable and allow the realization of tight-binding lattices which are unattainable, even in conventional solid-state systems. In particular, we show that networks of CPW resonators can create a new class of materials which constitute regular lattices in an effective hyperbolic space with constant negative curvature. We present numerical simulations of a series of hyperbolic analogs of the kagome lattice which show unusual densities of states with a spectrally-isolated degenerate flat band. We also present a proof-of-principle experimental realization of one of these lattices. This paper represents the first step towards on-chip quantum simulation of materials science and interacting particles in curved space."
https://openalex.org/W2953587283,"Since most dominant human mutations are single nucleotide substitutions1,2, we explored gene editing strategies to disrupt dominant mutations efficiently and selectively without affecting wild-type alleles. However, single nucleotide discrimination can be difficult to achieve3 because commonly used endonucleases, such as Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), can tolerate up to seven mismatches between guide RNA (gRNA) and target DNA. Furthermore, the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) in some Cas9 enzymes can tolerate mismatches with the target DNA3,4. To circumvent these limitations, we screened 14 Cas9/gRNA combinations for specific and efficient disruption of a nucleotide substitution that causes the dominant progressive hearing loss, DFNA36. As a model for DFNA36, we used Beethoven mice5, which harbor a point mutation in Tmc1, a gene required for hearing that encodes a pore-forming subunit of mechanosensory transduction channels in inner-ear hair cells6. We identified a PAM variant of Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9-KKH) that selectively and efficiently disrupted the mutant allele, but not the wild-type Tmc1/TMC1 allele, in Beethoven mice and in a DFNA36 human cell line. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated SaCas9-KKH delivery prevented deafness in Beethoven mice up to one year post injection. Analysis of current ClinVar entries revealed that ~21% of dominant human mutations could be targeted using a similar approach. Screening of Cas9 and gRNA combinations identifies the variant SaCas9-KKH that selectively disrupts the mutant Tmc1/TMC1 allele that causes hearing loss, prevents deafness and preserves inner-ear hair cell function in Tmc1 mutant Beethoven mice."

https://openalex.org/W2954987929,"Skin aging is a complex process, and alterations in human skin due to aging have distinct characteristic as compared to other organs. The aging of dermal cells and the biological mechanisms involved in this process are key areas to understand skin aging. A large number of biological mechanisms, such as decreasing of protein synthesis of extracellular matrix or increasing of degradation, are known to be altered through skin aging. However, environmental influence can accelerate this characteristic phenotype. In this study, we analyzed primary human dermal fibroblasts in three different in-vitro aging models-UVB irradiation and accelerated proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts from young donors as well as from elderly donors-for the gene expression of COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL4A1, COL7A1, MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP7, MMP8, MMP9, MMP10, MMP12, MMP13, MMP14, TIMP1, TIMP2, TIMP3, TIMP4, IL1B, IL1A, IL6, IL8, IL10, PTGS2, TP53, CASP3, LMNA, SIRT1. We compared the gene expression levels with young control. Furthermore, the behavior of skin fibroblasts was also evaluated using cell growth rate. The findings reveal that the gene expression levels in skin fibroblasts was altered in the process of aging in all three in-vitro aging models, and the cell growth rate was reduced, suggesting that these methods can be employed to understand skin aging mechanisms as well as drug discovery screening method."

Cardiac reprogramming factors, like other reprogramming factors, are typically tissue enriched rather than tissue specific, yet somehow still induce a unique fate switch. Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 each have essential functions in a wide range of tissues during embryonic development, and their deletion individually leads to embryonic lethality and gross malformation of various organ systems, including the developing cardiovascular system (Bruneau et al., 2001Bruneau B.G.

Gata4 interacts with Nkx2-5 and Tbx5 to promote cardiovascular development, but it also cooperates with Foxa2 during endoderm development to promote expression of a transcriptional network required for foregut development (Holtzinger and Evans, 2005Holtzinger A. Evans T. Gata4 regulates the formation of multiple organs.Development. 2005; 132: 4005-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Similarly, beyond cardiogenesis, Tbx5 is also required for limb development (Agarwal et al., 2003Agarwal P. Wylie J.N. Galceran J. Arkhitko O. Li C. Deng C. Grosschedl R. Bruneau B.G.

Thus, transcription factor combinations such as GMT likely provide specificity to genome-wide epigenomic remodeling, but how they achieve tissue-specific transcriptional regulation remains unknown. Gata4 is a zinc finger transcription factor capable of interacting with heterochromatin, but its ability to interact with regions containing DNA methylation is limited (Cirillo et al., 2002Cirillo L.A. Lin F.R. Cuesta I. Friedman D. Jarnik M. Zaret K.S. Opening of compacted chromatin by early developmental transcription factors HNF3 (FoxA) and GATA-4.Mol.

DNA methylation restricts lineage-specific functions of transcription factor Gata4 during embryonic stem cell differentiation.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003574Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Little is known regarding the ability of Tbx5 and Mef2c to bind to compact chromatin. One screen identified TBX5 as a factor capable of inducing DNA demethylation when expressed ectopically (Suzuki et al., 2017Suzuki T. Maeda S. Furuhata E. Shimizu Y. Nishimura H. Kishima M. Suzuki H. A screening system to identify transcription factors that induce binding site-directed DNA demethylation.Epigenetics Chromatin. 2017; 10: 60Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). While the function of Mef2c in this regard remains unclear, a study of the closely related factor Mef2d in photoreceptor cells found that it requires additional co-factors to access regions that do not encode strong consensus Mef-response motifs (Andzelm et al., 2015Andzelm M.M. Cherry T.J. Harmin D.A. Boeke A.C. Lee C. Hemberg M. Pawlyk B. Malik A.N. Flavell S.W. Sandberg M.A. et al.MEF2D drives photoreceptor development through a genome-wide competition for tissue-specific enhancers.Neuron. 2015; 86: 247-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Which of these factors, if any, functions to open closed chromatin in the context of direct reprogramming, and whether they require combinatorial interaction to do so, remains unknown. Here, we investigated the genome-wide consequences of Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 expression, alone and in combination, in cardiac fibroblasts as the cells underwent reprogramming toward a cardiomyocyte-like state. By combining single-cell RNA-sequencing, ChIP-seq of GMT, and ATAC-seq analyses, we found that epigenomic and transcriptional changes occurred rapidly within the first 24-48 h of reprogramming. Cells that adopted a trajectory toward the cardiac fate could largely be predicted by virtue of early gene expression changes and reprogramming factor expression. A machine learning model of gene expression changes as a function of transcription factor binding motifs in dynamic open chromatin regions identified new candidate factors involved in reprogramming. Although GMT are each capable of promoting chromatin remodeling when expressed individually, we found that accessibility changes during direct reprogramming were primarily associated with Mef2c and Tbx5 binding only. Cooperative activity between Gata4, Tbx5, and Mef2c was evident as combinatorial expression resulted in refinement and facilitation of DNA binding by these factors compared to single factor expression, and combinatorial binding correlated with opening of chromatin particularly at cardiac loci. To determine the discrete temporal transcriptional response to reprogramming with GMT in the context of TGFβ and Wnt inhibition, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing during cardiac reprogramming of Thy1-positive (Thy1+) cells, largely representing fibroblasts, isolated from neonatal mouse hearts that encode an αMHC-GFP reporter activated during reprogramming (Ieda et al., 2010Ieda M. Fu J.-D. Delgado-Olguin P. Vedantham V. Hayashi Y. Bruneau B.G. Srivastava D.

We collected and analyzed 29,718 cells representing five time points after transduction with retroviruses encoding Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (days −1, 1, 2, 3, 7). We additionally collected cells sorted at day 14 using the aforementioned reporter. Transcript information from all samples was aggregated and 14 distinct transcriptional signatures were identified (Figure 1B, Table S1) (Becht et al., 2018Becht E. Dutertre C.-A. Kwok I.W.H. Ng L.G.

Excluding the clusters that exclusively represent day −1 (clusters 6 and 11), all clusters included cells collected at each time point, highlighting the limited technical variability between our time points and the heterogeneous response to GMT (Figures 1C and 1D). To understand the biological significance of the six main groups of cells identified through hierarchical clustering of our populations, we identified representative gene signatures for each cluster (Figure 1E). 7,395 genes were differentially expressed (p < 0.01, average log fold change > 0.3) across the time course (Table S1). Three populations represented non-fibroblast cell types present in the starting population: epicardium-derived (clusters 11 and 12, Lrrn4 and Mgp), endocardium (cluster 13, Emcn and Egfl7), and macrophages (clusters 8 and 9, Lyz2 and Spp1) (Figures 1D, 1E, and S1B) (Cavallero et al., 2015Cavallero S.

Notably, the expression of genes such as Lrrn4 and Emcn exclusively within endocardial and epicardial cells throughout our time course contradicts a previous report that suggested that these genes are expressed at early stages in reprogramming cells but are subsequently repressed by GMT expression (Figures 1C and 1D) (Liu et al., 2017Liu Z. Wang L. Welch J.D. Ma H. Zhou Y. Vaseghi H.R. Yu S. Wall J.B. Alimohamadi S. Zheng M. et al.Single-cell transcriptomics reconstructs fate conversion from fibroblast to cardiomyocyte.Nature. 2017; 551: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Instead, our analysis suggests that these distinct cell types persist in the population in low numbers and likely were not detected in the previous study due to a limitation in the number of cells captured. Four signatures putatively represented various stages or outcomes of cardiac reprogramming. The initial stages (early iCMs) were identified by activation of genes such as Nid2 and Tnnt2 and incomplete repression of fibroblast-associated genes such as Lmcd1 and Ptgs2 (clusters 0 and 5; Figures 1E and S1B). This signature was present within 48 h of GMT transduction, in agreement with previous reports (Liu et al., 2017Liu Z. Wang L. Welch J.D. Ma H. Zhou Y. Vaseghi H.R. Yu S. Wall J.B. Alimohamadi S.

Initiating Events in Direct Cardiomyocyte Reprogramming.Cell Rep. 2018; 22: 1913-1922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The late stages (late iCMs) were marked by expression of cardiomyocyte-related genes such as Tnni3 and Myl7, and downregulation of fibroblast genes such as Ptgs2 (cluster 2; Figure 1E). Unexpectedly, this cluster contained cells collected from days 3 (5% of day 3 cells) and 7 (26% of day 7 cells), as well as reporter-positive cells collected on day 14 (“+14r;” Figures 1C and 1D), suggesting that a reprogrammed state can be acquired rapidly. The two additional signatures appear to contain alternative reprogramming outcomes. The first exhibits expression of various genes associated with the cell cycle such as Cdk1 and Ccnb1 (clusters 4 and 10; Figure 1E). The second activates genes that become more robustly expressed in cluster 7, such as Mmp3 and Figf (Figures 1E and S1B). Cluster 7 is similar to clusters 11 and 12, which are found in the starting population, suggesting that cluster 7 represents cells that do not acquire a cardiac fate nor enter the cell cycle (Figures 1D and 1E). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of genes activated in cluster 7 (compared to cluster 11, n = 488 genes, average log fold change > 0.3, p < 1e−10) revealed biological processes associated with vasculature and blood vessel development (p = 1.76e−13 and 5.32e−13, respectively). These cells uniquely activate genes associated with vascular developmental processes such as Epas1, Figf, and Sox9 (Figure 1E, Table S1) (Achen et al., 1998Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Mäkinen T.

They also continue to express genes associated with the starting fibroblast state, such as Dcn and Tbx20 (Table S1). To better understand the associations between identified clusters and establish a transcriptional trajectory of the reprogramming process, we next ordered clusters in pseudotime using Monocle (Cao et al., 2019Cao J. Spielmann M. Qiu X. Huang X. Ibrahim D.M. Hill A.J. Zhang F. Mundlos S. Christiansen L. Steemers F.J. et al.The single-cell transcriptional landscape of mammalian organogenesis.Nature. 2019; 566: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Clusters containing fibroblasts (cluster 6) and non-fibroblast cell types identified in the starting population (clusters 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13) were eliminated as they do not reflect the outcome of reprogramming. This analysis revealed a tree structure with distinct branches indicating three possible outcomes that originate from Slc1a6-positive cells (Figure 1F): one characterized by progressive activation of Mmp3, another by activation of cardiac genes such as Tnni3, and the third by markers of cell cycle progression (e.g., Ccnb1) (Figure 1G). The inhibitory effect imposed by proliferation during cardiac reprogramming is consistent with the prior observation that continued proliferation prevents fibroblast reprogramming to a pluripotent state (Xu et al., 2013Xu Y. Wei X. Wang M. Zhang R. Fu Y. Xing M. Hua Q. Xie X. Proliferation rate of somatic cells affects reprogramming efficiency.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 9767-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that a reprogramming trajectory can be acquired within 48 h of GMT transduction but that reprogramming progresses at variable rates in individual cells. To understand how ectopic GMT expression may dictate the observed transcriptional trajectories, we assayed expression of Gata4, Mef2c, or Tbx5 in each cell by generating 5′ single-cell RNA-sequencing data for 2,593 cells collected on day 1 of reprogramming. This approach circumvented the limitation of our initial analysis where the individual ectopic retroviral plasmids could not be distinguished because they each encode the same 3′ polyadenylation sequence. After eliminating the myeloid lineage, we identified 12 clusters within this population, confirming the prompt rate in which cells alter their transcriptional landscape in our system (Figure 2A). A pseudotime analysis again identified three main branches in the main trajectory as well as a separate group of clusters (clusters 6, 7, 11, and 12) that were unlinked from the main trajectory (Figure 2B). The three branches identified in the main trajectory represent gene signatures analogous to those presented in Figure 1 based on a differential expression analysis: cells that are reprogramming (A, 33%), those that are likely proliferating (B, 22%), and fibroblast-like cells (C, 29%) (Figure 2C, Table S2). Evaluation of GMT expression revealed their collective expression in branch A (Figure 2D), which contains cells that have activated markers of a cardiomyocyte fate (e.g., Pdlim3 and Smpx; Figures 2C–2E) and downregulated genes associated with a fibroblast identity (e.g., Postn and Tbx20; Figure 2C, Table S2). Gata4 is expressed in cardiac fibroblasts and is therefore detected throughout the population; however, it is increased 1.6-fold in cluster 1 (branch A) compared to cluster 2 (branch C). GMT is also expressed in cluster 10, which lies within branch B and expresses Smpx and Pdlim3 at increased levels, suggesting that expression of GMT can initiate reprogramming even if the cells enter a proliferative state (Figures 2C and 2D). While this type of reprogramming may not produce more advanced iCMs, it suggests that proliferation does not prevent the initial stages of reprogramming (Liu et al., 2017Liu Z. Wang L. Welch J.D. Ma H. Zhou Y. Vaseghi H.R. Yu S. Wall J.B. Alimohamadi S. Zheng M. et al.Single-cell transcriptomics reconstructs fate conversion from fibroblast to cardiomyocyte.Nature. 2017; 551: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast to branches A and B, the fibroblast-like cells that populate branch C exhibited only baseline levels of all three factors (Figure 2D). This analysis indicates that branch C represents fibroblasts that do not express ectopic GMT, rather than representing a newly acquired state driven by transduction with one or two factors. Therefore, unlike observations made during direct neural reprogramming, we do not detect the emergence of an alternative cell type in our experiments (Treutlein et al., 2016Treutlein B. Lee Q.Y.

BRCA1, BRCA2 and a subset of Fanconi anaemia proteins protect stalled replication forks from degradation by nucleases, through pathways that involve RAD51. The contribution and regulation of BRCA1 in replication fork protection, and how this role relates to its role in homologous recombination, is unclear. Here we show that BRCA1 in complex with BARD1, and not the canonical BRCA1-PALB2 interaction, is required for fork protection. BRCA1-BARD1 is regulated by a conformational change mediated by the phosphorylation-directed prolyl isomerase PIN1. PIN1 activity enhances BRCA1-BARD1 interaction with RAD51, thereby increasing the presence of RAD51 at stalled replication structures. We identify genetic variants of BRCA1-BARD1 in patients with cancer that exhibit poor protection of nascent strands but retain homologous recombination proficiency, thus defining domains of BRCA1-BARD1 that are required for fork protection and associated with cancer development. Together, these findings reveal a BRCA1-mediated pathway that governs replication fork protection."

The intrinsic molecular basis underlying plasticity of differentiated cells remains largely unaddressed. Here we show that Arid1a, a key component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, controls liver regeneration and gene expression associated with emergence of injury-induced liver-progenitor-like cells (LPLCs). Hepatocyte-specific Arid1a ablation reduces LPLC gene expression in several models of periportal liver injury and impairs liver regeneration, leading to organ dysfunction. Arid1a establishes a permissive chromatin state at LPLC-enriched genes during homeostasis, suggesting it endows hepatocytes with competence to respond to injury-induced signals. Consistently, Arid1a facilitates binding of YAP, a critical regeneration signaling pathway, to LPLC-enriched genes, and Arid1a deletion prevents their YAP-associated induction following injury. Together, these findings provide a framework for studying the contributions of injury-induced LPLCs to periportal liver regeneration."

Children of age under five years and women of reproductive age are particularly vulnerable in this region. Although several studies have investigated the risk factors of anemia, only few have explored its association with malnutrition, despite its high prevalence in the same group. The objective of this paper is to investigate the association of malnutrition with anemia by conducting separate analyses for under-five children and women of reproductive age using data from the nationally representative 2011 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey. Methods Two binary outcome variables are considered separately: presence of anemia in children under five years of age (Hb<11.0 g/dl) and presence of anemia in women of childbearing age (Hb<12.0 g/dl). The exposures of interest corresponding to these two outcomes are stunting (low height-for-age) and low BMI (<18.5 kg/m2), respectively. Preliminary analysis involves estimating the association between exposure and outcome while controlling for a single confounder by computing adjusted odds ratios (adjOR) using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel approach in stratified analysis. Later, associations between the exposures and outcomes are estimated separately for under-five children and women of reproductive age by fitting multivariable regression models that adjust simultaneously for several confounders. Results The prevalence of anemia is found to be higher among both the stunted children and women with low BMI compared to their healthy counterparts (Children: 56% vs 48%; women: 50% vs 43%). Furthermore, stunted children and women with low BMI have significantly increased odds of developing anemia, as reflected by the adjusted ORs of 1.76 (95% CI:1.10–2.83) and 1.81 (95% CI: 1.11–3.48), respectively. The association of stunting with anemia in children was modified by their age and socio-economic condition, where risk of being anemic decreases with increasing age but with a lower rate for stunted children from richest family. In addition, stunted children of anemic mothers are at greater risk of being anemic compared to non-stunted children of anemic or non-anemic mothers. Again the association between BMI and anemia in women is modified by the level of education, with risk of anemia being lowest among women with low BMI and higher education. Conclusion Evidence–based policies targeting the vulnerable groups are required to combat anemia and nutritional deficiencies simultaneously under the same program."
https://openalex.org/W2955111331,"Cholesterol constitutes ∼30-40% of the mammalian plasma membrane, a larger fraction than of any other single component. It is a major player in numerous signaling processes as well as in shaping molecular membrane architecture. However, our knowledge of the dynamics of cholesterol in the plasma membrane is limited, restricting our understanding of the mechanisms regulating its involvement in cell signaling. Here, we applied advanced fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy approaches on in vitro (model membranes) and in vivo (live cells and embryos) membranes as well as in silico analysis to systematically study the nanoscale dynamics of cholesterol in biological membranes. Our results indicate that cholesterol diffuses faster than phospholipids in live membranes, but not in model membranes. Interestingly, a detailed statistical diffusion analysis suggested two-component diffusion for cholesterol in the plasma membrane of live cells. One of these components was similar to a freely diffusing phospholipid analogue, whereas the other one was significantly faster. When a cholesterol analogue was localized to the outer leaflet only, the fast diffusion of cholesterol disappeared, and it diffused similarly to phospholipids. Overall, our results suggest that cholesterol diffusion in the cell membrane is heterogeneous and that this diffusional heterogeneity is due to cholesterol's nanoscale interactions and localization in the membrane."

However, atoms can be used to mediate photonic interactions1,2, raising the prospect of forming synthetic materials3 and quantum information systems4-7 from photons. One promising approach combines highly excited Rydberg atoms8-12 with the enhanced light-matter coupling of an optical cavity to convert photons into strongly interacting polaritons13-15. However, quantum materials made of optical photons have not yet been realized, because the experimental challenge of coupling a suitable atomic sample with a degenerate cavity has constrained cavity polaritons to a single spatial mode that is resonant with an atomic transition. Here we use Floquet engineering16,17-the periodic modulation of a quantum system-to enable strongly interacting polaritons to access multiple spatial modes of an optical cavity. First, we show that periodically modulating an excited state of rubidium splits its spectral weight to generate new lines-beyond those that are ordinarily characteristic of the atom-separated by multiples of the modulation frequency. Second, we use this capability to simultaneously generate spectral lines that are resonant with two chosen spatial modes of a non-degenerate optical cavity, enabling what we name 'Floquet polaritons' to exist in both modes. Because both spectral lines correspond to the same Floquet-engineered atomic state, adding a single-frequency field is sufficient to couple both modes to a Rydberg excitation. We demonstrate that the resulting polaritons interact strongly in both cavity modes simultaneously. The production of Floquet polaritons provides a promising new route to the realization of ordered states of strongly correlated photons, including crystals and topological fluids, as well as quantum information technologies such as multimode photon-by-photon switching."

In the present study, in vivo experiments were conducted to determine the physiological responses of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) seedlings by inoculation with an endophytic actinobacterium, Streptomyces thermocarboxydus isolate BPSAC147 under greenhouse conditions. Further, photochemical quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) (Fv/Fm), photochemical quenching (qP) and non-photochemical (NPQ) were calculated in seedlings inoculated with S. thermocarboxydus (T1) and were compared with control (T0) plants. Furthermore, the electron transport rate (ETR) of PSII exhibited a significant increase in T1 plants, relative to T0 plants. These results indicate that inoculation of tomato seedlings with S. thermocarboxydus had a positive effect on the process of photosynthesis, resulting in enhanced chlorophyll fluorescence parameters due to increased ETR in the thylakoid membrane. GC-MS analysis showed significant differences in the volatile compounds in the different treatments performed under greenhouse conditions.

The risk factors included were: regular consumption of ultra-processed foods, irregular consumption of fruits and vegetables, insufficient physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Clustering was defined through the ratio between observed and expected prevalences of combination of risk factors greater than 1. Expected prevalence of the co-occurrence of risk factors was calculated from the joint probability of the behaviors. Additionally, we examined the presence of at least four risk factors according to socioeconomic characteristics.Of the 32 combinations of risk factors, 13 corresponded to clustering. We observed a strong correlation between alcohol consumption and smoking, which were found together in 8 of the 13 clusters identified. The most frequent combinations of risk factors involved unhealthy eating and insufficient physical activity. Only 2.9% of the adolescents did not present any risk behaviors, while 38.0%, 32.9%, 9.4% and 1.8% accumulated two, three, four and five risk factors, respectively. The accumulation of risk factors was higher in girls, older adolescents, those who did not live with both parents, children of less-educated mothers, students attending public school, and residents of cities in more developed urban areas of the country.The main risk factors for NCD are frequent and not randomly distributed among Brazilian adolescents.

In principle, a magnetic monopole can be detected by the quantized jump in magnetic flux that it generates upon passage through a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)4. Following the theoretical prediction that emergent magnetic monopoles should exist in several lanthanide pyrochlore magnetic insulators5,6, including Dy2Ti2O7, the SQUID technique has been proposed for their direct detection6. However, this approach has been hindered by the high number density and the generation-recombination fluctuations expected of such thermally generated monopoles. Recently, theoretical advances have enabled the prediction of the spectral density of magnetic-flux noise from monopole generation-recombination fluctuations in these materials7,8. Here we report the development of a SQUID-based flux noise spectrometer and measurements of the frequency and temperature dependence of magnetic-flux noise generated by Dy2Ti2O7 crystals. We detect almost all of the features of magnetic-flux noise predicted for magnetic monopole plasmas7,8, including the existence of intense magnetization noise and its characteristic frequency and temperature dependence. Moreover, comparisons of simulated and measured correlation functions of the magnetic-flux noise indicate that the motions of magnetic charges are strongly correlated. Intriguingly, because the generation-recombination time constant for Dy2Ti2O7 is in the millisecond range, magnetic monopole flux noise amplified by SQUID is audible to humans."

However, its precise role in typhoid disease in humans is not fully defined. We studied the role of typhoid toxin in acute infection using a randomized, double-blind S. Typhi human challenge model7. Forty healthy volunteers were randomized (1:1) to oral challenge with 104 colony-forming units of wild-type or an isogenic typhoid toxin deletion mutant (TN) of S. Typhi. We observed no significant difference in the rate of typhoid infection (fever ≥38 °C for ≥12 h and/or S. Typhi bacteremia) between participants challenged with wild-type or TN S. Typhi (15 out of 21 (71%) versus 15 out of 19 (79%); P = 0.58). The duration of bacteremia was significantly longer in participants challenged with the TN strain compared with wild-type (47.6 hours (28.9–97.0) versus 30.3(3.6–49.4); P ≤ 0.001). The clinical syndrome was otherwise indistinguishable between wild-type and TN groups. These data suggest that the typhoid toxin is not required for infection and the development of early typhoid fever symptoms within the context of a human challenge model. Further clinical data are required to assess the role of typhoid toxin in severe disease or the establishment of bacterial carriage. Typhoid toxin is not essential for the pathogenesis of typhoid fever in healthy humans challenged with Salmonella Typhi."

Crop improvement to mitigate biotic and abiotic stresses for realization of its potential yield and bridging yield gap is the need of the hour. Availability of limited genomic resources in the cultivated germplasm, however, is a serious bottleneck towards successful molecular breeding for the development of superior genotypes in pigeonpea. In view of this, improvement of pigeonpea can be attempted through transgenesis or by exploiting genetic resources from its wild relatives. Pigeonpea wild relatives are known to be bestowed with agronomic traits of importance; discovery and deployment of genes from them can provide a lucrative option for crop improvement. Understanding molecular signatures of wild relatives would not only provide information about the mechanism behind desired traits but also enable us to extrapolate the information to cultivated pigeonpea. The present study deals with the characterization of leaf transcriptomes of Cajanus cajan and one of its wild relatives, Cajanus platycarpus. Illumina sequencing revealed 0.11 million transcripts in both the species with an annotation of 0.09 million (82%) transcripts using BLASTX. Comparative transcriptome analyses on the whole, divulged cues about the wild relative being vigilant and agile. Gene ontology and Mapman analysis depicted higher number of transcripts in the wild relative pertaining to signaling, transcription factors and stress responsive genes. Further, networking between the differentially expressed MapMan bins demonstrated conspicuous interactions between different bins through 535 nodes (512 Genes and 23 Pathways) and 1857 edges. The authenticity of RNA-seq analysis was confirmed by qRT-PCR. The information emanating from this study can provide valuable information and resource for future translational research including genome editing to alleviate varied stresses. Further, this learning can be a platform for in-depth investigations to decipher molecular mechanisms for mitigation of various stresses in the wild relative."

It is also one of the least known biomes in Brazil due to a combination of inadequate investment, low regional research capacity and difficult working conditions. However, while the lack of scientific knowledge of the Caatinga is well known, the spatial and temporal distribution of knowledge production has not been investigated. This is important because such biases undermine the development of effective conservation policy and practice and increase the uncertainty associated with conservation actions. Here, we map the geography of conservation knowledge production in the Caatinga and use an innovative hurdle model to identify the presumptive factors driving these patterns. Our analysis revealed strong geographic patterns, with research sites concentrated in the east of the region and in areas close to roads and research centres. There was also a positive association between conservation knowledge production and risk of desertification, indicating that conservation scientists are responding to conservation challenges faced by Caatinga’s fauna and flora arising from climate change. Our results also highlight the pivotal role of pioneer scientists (those who develop research sites in previously unstudied/understudied areas) in determining the future geographic patterns of knowledge production. We conclude our article with a brief discussion of potential policies for increasing the spatial representativeness of conservation research in this remarkable ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2953488693,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive degenerative disease of the joints caused in part by a change in the phenotype of resident chondrocytes within affected joints. This altered phenotype, often termed proinflammatory or procatabolic, features enhanced production of endoproteinases and matrix metallo-proteinases (MMPs) as well as secretion of endogenous inflammatory mediators. Degradation and reduced retention of the proteoglycan aggrecan is an early event in OA. Enhanced turnover of hyaluronan (HA) is closely associated with changes in aggrecan. Here, to determine whether experimentally increased HA production promotes aggrecan retention and generates a positive feedback response, we overexpressed HA synthase-2 (HAS2) in chondrocytes via an inducible adenovirus construct (HA synthase-2 viral overexpression; HAS2-OE). HAS2-OE incrementally increased high-molecular-mass HA >100-fold within the cell-associated and growth medium pools. More importantly, our results indicated that the HAS2-OE expression system inhibits MMP3, MMP13, and other markers of the procatabolic phenotype (such as TNF-stimulated gene 6 protein (TSG6)) and also enhances aggrecan retention. These markers were inhibited in OA-associated chondrocytes and in chondrocytes activated by interleukin-1β (IL1β), but also chondrocytes activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), or HA oligosaccharides. However, the enhanced extracellular HA resulting from HAS2-OE did not reduce the procatabolic phenotype of neighboring nontransduced chondrocytes as we had expected. Rather, HA-mediated inhibition of the phenotype occurred only in transduced cells. In addition, high HA biosynthesis rates, especially in transduced procatabolic chondrocytes, resulted in marked changes in chondrocyte dependence on glycolysis versus oxidative phosphorylation for their metabolic energy needs."

Lipids are believed to be involved in salinity adaptation during migration. This study investigated the effects of different salinities (0, 6, 12, and 18‰) on the total lipids, neutral lipids, and polar lipids contents, and fatty acid profiles in the gonads, hepatopancreas, and muscles of adult E. sinensis after 40 days of salinity adaptation. The results showed that the males and females from 12‰ treatment had the highest contents of total lipids and neutral lipids in their hepatopancreas and total lipids in the muscles. Notably, salinity had a greater effect on the fatty acid profiles in the hepatopancreas compared to that in the gonads and muscles. The male hepatopancreas treated with 18‰ salinity had the highest percentage of total n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (∑n-6PUFA) in both neutral lipids and polar lipids, while the percentage of total n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (∑n-3PUFA) in neutral lipids and polar lipids decreased significantly with increasing salinity in males. In females, the 0‰ treatment had the highest percentages of total saturated fatty acids in neutral lipids and polar lipids in the hepatopancreas, while the highest ∑n-3PUFA and ∑n-6PUFA in neutral lipids and polar lipids were detected in the 12‰ treatment group. In conclusion, brackish water could promote the accumulations of total lipids and neutral lipids in the hepatopancreas and change the fatty acid profiles of adult E. sinensis, particularly in the hepatopancreas after long-term salinity adaptation."

Therefore this study investigated whether proliferation, migration, inflammatory cytokines expression and transcriptional profile would be affected by exposure to endotoxins from bacterial species found in the subgingival plaque. PDLSC were cultured with the following bacterial supernatants: S. mutans, S. anginosus, P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis and T. denticola. These supernatants were prepared in dilutions of 1:1000, 1:500, 1:300 and 1:50. Using quantitative RT-PCR, gene expression of selected inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1β) and cell-surface receptors (TLR2, TLR4) showed upregulation of ≈2.0- to 3.0-fold, when exposed to P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis and T. denticola. However, supernatants did not affect proliferation (MTT) and migration (wound scratch assays) of PDLSC. Next generation RNA sequencing confirmed modified lineage commitment of PDLSC by stimulating chondrogenesis, adipogenesis and inhibition of osteogenesis under P. gingivalis supernatant treatment compared to control. Taken together, this study shows stem cell immunomodulatory response to different periodontal bacteria supernatant and suggests that stem cell transcriptional capacity, migration/proliferation and osteogenesis may differ in the presence of those pathogens. These results bring into question stem cell contribution to periodontal tissue regeneration and onset of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2955821276,"Medicine-food homology is a long-standing concept in traditional Chinese medicine. YiNianKangBao (YNKB) tea is a medicine-food formulation based on Sichuan dark tea (Ya’an Tibetan tea), which is traditionally used for its lipid-lowering properties. In this study, we evaluated the effects of YNKB on dyslipidemia and investigated the mechanism underlying its correlation with gut microbiota and serum metabolite regulation. Wild-type mice were fed a normal diet as a control. Male ApoE-/- mice were randomly divided into three high-fat diet (HFD) groups, a model group, and two treated groups (100, 400 mg/kg/d for low, high-dose), and fed by gavage for 12 weeks. Serum lipid levels, composition of gut microbiota, and serum metabolites were then analyzed before treatment with YNKB. We extracted the ingredients of YNKB in boiled water for one hour. YNKB supplementation at a high dose of 400 mg/kg/day reduced bodyweight gains (relative epididymal fat pad and liver weight), and markedly attenuated serum lipid profiles and atherosclerosis index, with no significant differences present between the low-dose treatment and HFD groups. Gut microbiota and serum metabolic analysis indicated that significant differences were observed between normal, HFD, and YNKB treatment groups. These differences in gut microbiota exhibited strong correlations with dyslipidemia-related indexes and serum metabolite levels. Oral administration of high-dose YNKB also showed significant lipid-lowering activity against hyperlipidemia in apoE-deficient mice, which might be associated with composition alterations of the gut microbiota and changes in serum metabolite abundances. These findings highlight that YNKB as a medicine-food formulation derived from Sichuan dark tea could prevent dyslipidemia and improve the understanding of its mechanisms and the pharmacological rationale for preventive use."
https://openalex.org/W2954400078,"Introduction Discontinuation of a contraceptive method soon after its initiation is becoming a public health problem in Low middle income countries and may result in unintended pregnancy and related unwanted consequences. A better understanding of factors behind discontinuation of a modern method would help in designing interventions to continue its use till desired spacing goals are achieved. Objective To determine factors associated with the discontinuation of modern contraceptive methods within six months of its use compared to continued use of modern method for at least six months in low-income areas of Karachi, Pakistan. Methods A community-based case-control study was conducted in low-income areas of Karachi. Cases were 137 users who discontinued a modern contraceptive method within 6 months of initiation and were not using any method at the time of interview, while controls were 276 continuous users of modern method for at least last six months from the time of interview. Information was collected by using a structured questionnaire. Applied logistic regression was used to identify the associated factors for discontinuation. Results The mean ages of discontinued and continued users were 29.3±5.3 years and 29.2±5.4 years respectively. A larger proportion of the discontinued users had no formal education (43.8%) as compared to the continued users (27.9%). The factors associated with discontinuation of a modern method of contraception were belonging to Sindhi ethnicity [OR: 2.54, 95%CI 1.16–5.57], experiencing side effects [OR: 15.12; 95% CI 7.50–30.51], difficulty in accessing contraceptives by themselves [OR: 0.40, 95%CI 0.19–0.83] and difficulty in reaching clinics for management of the side effects [OR: 4.10, 95%CI 2.38–7.05]. Moreover, women having support from the husband for contraceptive use were less likely to discontinue the method [OR: 0.58, 95% CI 0.34–0.98]. Conclusions Sindhi ethnicity and side effects of modern methods of contraception were identified as major factors for discontinuation in low-income populations. Similarly, women who had difficulty in travelling to reach clinics for treatment also contributed to discontinuation. Furthermore, women using long acting methods and those supported by their husbands were less likely to discontinue the contraceptive methods. Findings emphasize a need to focus on Sindhi ethnicity and trainings of service providers on management of side effects and provision of high quality of services."
https://openalex.org/W2954559718,"Posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is the most leading cause of mortality following hepatectomy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Platelet count was reported to be a simple but useful indicator of liver cirrhosis and function of spleen. Spleen stiffness (SS) was used to evaluate the morphological change of spleen and was reported to be related to liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. However, the predictive value of platelet to spleen stiffness ratio (PSR) on PHLF remains unknown. A retrospective study was performed to analyze 158 patients with HCC following hepatectomy from August 2015 to February 2016. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the value of each risk factor for predicting PHLF. The predictive efficiency of the risk factors was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. PHLF occured in 23 (14.6%) patients. PSR (P<0.001, odds ratio (OR) = 0.622, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.493~0.784), hepatic inflow occlusion (HIO) (P = 0.003, OR = 1.044, 95% CI 1.015~1.075) and major hepatectomy (P = 0.019, OR = 5.967, 95% CI 1.346~26.443) were demonstrated to be the independent predictive factors for development of PHLF in a multivariate analysis. Results of the present study suggested PSR is a novel and non-invasive model for predicting PHLF in patients with HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2953470955,"Background Viral load testing is key to monitoring response to anti-retroviral therapy (ART). However, in lower and middle income countries with large epidemics, pre-analytical challenges threaten the quality of testing. It is unknown how much delayed processing and adverse storage affects the validity of results. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of delayed testing and warmer storage conditions on HIV RNA stability in diagnostic samples. Methods 1194 samples, collected in EDTA or plasma preparation (PPT) tubes, were studied. Immediately after initial testing, primary tubes were stored for 72, 96 or 168 hours at 4°C, 20°C or 30°C. The viral load was then repeated and the 2 results were compared. Results Viral loads were very stable, with <0.5 log copies/ml median difference noted between paired tests for all storage times and temperatures. The viral load in samples stored for up to a week reliably differentiated between ART-suppressed and failing patients in 98.83% of instances. However, re-centrifugation immediately prior to repeat testing was essential to avoid falsely elevated readings, probably due to contamination of plasma with cell-associated viral nucleic acids. Approximately 20% of samples with initially undetectable viral loads were weakly positive (<100 copies/mL) on repeat. This was not exacerbated by duration or temperature of storage. Conclusion Viral RNA in diagnostic samples is stable well beyond currently recommended limits. However, when testing stored primary samples, contamination of plasma with cellular material easily occurs. Low viral loads (<100copies/mL) in samples stored in this way should be interpreted with caution."
https://openalex.org/W2953865036,"The sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are a family of transcription factors best known for stimulating the expression of genes encoding key lipogenic enzymes. However, SREBP functions beyond lipid metabolism are less understood. Here, we show that hepcidin antimicrobial peptide (Hamp), encoding the hormone hepcidin essential for iron homeostasis and regulated by dietary iron and inflammation, is a target gene of the two SREBP isoforms SREBP-1a/c. We found that in tissue culture, mature, active, and nuclear forms of the SREBP-1a/c proteins induce endogenous Hamp gene expression and increase the Hamp promoter activity primarily via three regulatory sequences, including an E-box. Moreover, ChIP experiments revealed that SREBP-1a binds to the Hamp gene promoter. Overexpression of nuclear SREBP-1a under the control of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase-1 (Pck1) promoter in mice increased hepatic Hamp mRNA and blood hepcidin levels, and as expected, caused fatty liver. Consistent with the known effects of Hamp up-regulation, SREBP-1a–overexpressing mice displayed signs of dysregulation in iron metabolism, including reduced serum iron and increased hepatic and splenic iron storage. Conversely, liver-specific depletion of the nuclear forms of SREBPs, as in SREBP cleavage-activating protein knockout mice, impaired lipopolysaccharide-induced up-regulation of hepatic Hamp. Together, these results indicate that the SREBP-1a/c transcription regulators activate hepcidin expression and thereby contribute to the control of mammalian iron metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2954077434,"Introduction The neuroendocrine background of acute sleep fragmentation in obstructive sleep apnea and sleep fragmentation involvement in psychiatric comorbidities, common in these patients, are still largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of short-term experimental sleep fragmentation on anxiety -like behavior and hormonal status in rats. Methods Male rats were adapted to treadmill (ON and OFF mode with belt speed set on 0.02m/s and 0.00m/s) and randomized to: 1) treadmill control (TC, only OFF mode); 2) motion, activity control (AC, 10min ON and 30min OFF mode) and 3) sleep fragmentation (SF, 30s ON and 90s OFF mode) group. Six hours later, the animals were tested in the open field, elevated plus maze and light/dark test (n = 8/group). Testosterone, estradiol, progesterone and corticosterone were determined in separate animal cohort immediately upon sleep fragmentation (n = 6/group). Results SF rats showed decreased rearings number, decreased time spent in the central area and increased thigmotaxic index compared to TC and AC rats in the open field test. Similarly, increased anxiety upon sleep fragmentation was observed in the elevated plus maze and the light/dark test. Significantly lower testosterone, estradiol and progesterone levels were determined in SF in comparison to AC and TC groups, while there was no significant difference in the levels of corticosterone. Conclusion Short term sleep fragmentation enhances anxiety-related behavior in rats, which could be partly mediated by the observed hormonal changes presented in the current study in form of testosterone, estradiol and progesterone depletion."
https://openalex.org/W2953431996,"The lung clearance index (LCI), measured by multiple breath washout (MBW), reflects global ventilation inhomogeneity and is a sensitive marker of early obstructive airway disease. For the MBW test to accurately reflect a subject’s gas mixing within the lungs, the breathing pattern should represent physiologically appropriate tidal volumes (VT) and respiratory rate (RR). We aimed to assess whether changes in VT impact MBW outcome measures with a series of prospective and retrospective studies. MBW testing was performed using the Exhalyzer ® D (EcoMedics AG, Switzerland). Healthy adult subjects performed MBW with uninstructed tidal breathing and a series of instructed tidal breathing tests, designed to isolate specific features of the breathing pattern. In addition, we retrospectively analyzed MBW data from two pediatric multi-centre interventional studies of cystic fibrosis (CF) subjects to determine the range of VT observed during uninstructed breathing, and whether breathing outside this range impacted results. The LCI was lower, but not significantly different between deep breathing at 20 ml/kg body weight and uninstructed tidal breathing; whereas LCI was significantly higher during shallow breathing compared with normal tidal breathing. For the majority of subjects with CF (80%), VT ranged from 9-15mL/kg. Within the observed VT range, LCI was similar in trials with mean VT /kg below this range compared to trials with VT /kg within the range. If subjects breathe naturally and are not instructed to use specific targets, the range of VT is within physiologically appropriate limits and normal variations observed do not impact MBW outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2955132254,"Cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) is an important second messenger in bacteria, and its regulatory network has been extensively studied. However, information regarding the activation mechanisms of its receptors remains limited. In this study, we characterized the two-component regulator DevR as a new c-di-GMP receptor and further uncovered a novel co-activation mechanism for effective regulation of DevR in mycobacteria. We show that high c-di-GMP levels induce the expression of the devR operon in Mycobacterium smegmatis and increase mycobacterial survival under oxidative stress. The deletion of either DevR or its two-component kinase DevS significantly weakened the stimulating effect of c-di-GMP on oxidative-stress tolerance of mycobacteria. We also found that DevR senses the c-di-GMP signal through its C-terminal structure and that c-di-GMP alone does not directly affect the DNA-binding activity of DevR. Strikingly, c-di-GMP stimulated DevR phosphorylation by the kinase DevS, thereby activating DevR's DNA-binding affinity. In summary, our results indicated that c-di-GMP triggers a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism that co-activates DevR's transcriptional activity. Our findings suggest a novel paradigm for the cross-talk between c-di-GMP signaling and two-component regulatory systems that activates transcription of stress-response genes in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2955742566,"Nonsynonymous gene mutations can be beneficial, neutral, or detrimental to the stability, structure, and biological function of the encoded protein, but the effects of these mutations are often not readily predictable. For example, the β-propeller olfactomedin domain of myocilin (mOLF) exhibits a complex interrelationship among structure(s), stability, and aggregation. Numerous mutations within mOLF are linked to glaucoma; the resulting variants are less stable, aggregation-prone, and sequestered intracellularly, causing cytotoxicity. Here, we report the first stable mOLF variants carrying substitutions in the calcium-binding site that exhibit solution characteristics indistinguishable from those of glaucoma variants. Crystal structures of these stable variants at 1.8-2.0-Å resolution revealed features that we could not predict by molecular dynamics simulations, including loss of loop structure, helix unwinding, and a blade shift. Double mutants that combined a stabilizing substitution and a selected glaucoma-causing single-point mutant rescued in vitro folding and stability defects. In the context of full-length myocilin, secretion of stable single variants was indistinguishable from that of the WT protein, and the double mutants were secreted to varying extents. In summary, our finding that mOLF can tolerate particular substitutions that render the protein stable despite a conformational switch emphasizes the complexities in differentiating between benign and glaucoma-causing variants and provides new insight into the possible biological function of myocilin."

https://openalex.org/W2954713518,"In accordance with the Red Queen hypothesis, the lower genotypic diversity in clonally reproducing species should make them easier targets for pathogen infection, especially when closely related sexually reproducing species occur in close proximity. We analyzed two populations of clonal P. formosa and their sexual parental species P. mexicana by correlating individual parasite infection with overall and immune genotype. Our study revealed lower levels of overall genotypic diversity and marginally fewer MHC class I alleles in P. formosa individuals compared to sexually reproducing P. mexicana. Parasite load, however, differed only between field sites but not between species. We hypothesize that this might be due to slightly higher genotypic diversity in P. formosa at the innate immune system (toll like receptor 8) which is likely due to the species' hybrid origin. In consequence, it appears that clonal individuals do not necessarily suffer a disadvantage compared to sexual individuals when fighting parasite infection."

As a result, the cancer burden and death rates are highest in LMICs. In an effort to meet this need, our work presents the design and feasibility of a low-cost cryoablation system using widely-available carbon dioxide as the only consumable. This system uses an 8-gauge outer-diameter needle and Joule-Thomson expansion to percutaneously necrose tissue with cryoablation. Bench top experiments characterized temperature dynamics in ultrasound gel demonstrated that isotherms greater than 2 cm were formed. Further, this system was applied to mammary tumors in an in vivo rat model and necrosis was verified by histopathology. Finally, freezing capacity under a large heat load was assessed with an in vivo porcine study, where volumes of necrosis greater than 1.5 cm in diameter confirmed by histopathology were induced in a highly perfused liver after two 7-minute freeze cycles. These results demonstrate the feasibility of a carbon-dioxide based cryoablation system for improving solid tumor treatment options in resource-constrained environments."
https://openalex.org/W2956020134,"Durable gene silencing through the formation of compact heterochromatin domains plays a critical role during mammalian development in establishing defined tissues capable of retaining cellular identity. Hallmarks of heterochromatin gene repression are the binding of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3) and the methylation of cytosine residues of DNA. HP1 binds directly to the H3K9me3 histone modification, and while DNA methyltransferases have been found in complex with histone methyltransferases and HP1, there remains much to be known about the relationship between DNA sequence and HP1 in differentiated mammalian cells. To further explore this interplay in a controlled system, we designed a system to test the effect of promoter CpG content on the formation kinetics and memory of an HP1-mediated heterochromatin domain in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF)s. To do this, we have constructed a side-by-side comparison of wild-type (CpGFull) and CpG-depleted (CpGDep) promoter-driven reporter constructs in the context of the Chromatin in vivo Assay (CiA), which uses chemically-induced proximity (CIP) to tether the chromoshadow domain of HP1α (csHP1α) to a fluorescent reporter gene in a reversible, chemically-dependent manner. By comparing the response of CpGFull and CpGDep reporter constructs, we discovered that the heterochromatin formation by recruitment of csHP1α is unaffected by the underlying CpG dinucleotide content of the promoter, as measured by the velocity of gene silencing or enrichment of H3K9me3 at the silenced gene. However, recovery from long-term silencing is measurably faster in the CpG-depleted reporter lines. These data provide evidence that the stability of the HP1 heterochromatin domain is reliant on the underlying DNA sequence. Moreover, these cell lines represent a new modular system with which to study the effect of the underlying DNA sequences on the efficacy of epigenetic modifiers."
https://openalex.org/W2953704016,"Nutrition during pregnancy is one of the key elements to good maternal and child health, as well as to lifetime landmarks. However, many pregnant women go undernourished in less developed settings. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence and factors associated with gestational night blindness (GXN) and maternal anemia in a cross-sectional population-based study in Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre State, Western Brazilian Amazon. All women living in the municipality admitted at the only maternity-hospital in the city to delivery of a singleton infant were eligible to this study (n = 1,525). Recruitment of participants took place between July 2015 to June 2016. GXN was assessed in the postpartum period by WHO standardized interview. Maternal anemia was defined as hemoglobin at delivery < 110.0 g/L. We estimated prevalence rates and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR), alongside 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), of the factors associated with the outcomes through multiple Poisson regression models with robust variance. Alarming prevalence of GXN (11.5%; 95% CI, 9.97-13.25) and maternal anemia (39.4%; 95% CI, 36.84-41.95) were found. Factors associated with GXN were (aPR; 95% CI): ≥ 5 residents in the household (2.06; 1.24-3.41), smoking during pregnancy (1.78; 1.15-2.78), and attending < 6 antenatal care visits (1.61; 1.08-2.40). Factors associated with maternal anemia were (aPR; 95% CI): maternal age < 19 years (1.18; 1.01-1.38), gestational malaria (1.22; 1.01-1.49), not taking micronutrient supplements during pregnancy (1.27; 1.01-1.62), and attending < 6 antenatal care visits (1.40; 1.15-1.70). High prevalence rates of GXN and maternal anemia in these postpartum women may reflect poor assistance during antenatal care, underlying the importance of rethinking current protocols related to nutrition in pregnancy."

The aim of this study was to examine the longitudinal measurement invariance of the CPTI in a group of Chinese schoolchildren. Mothers of 585 children aged 8 to 12 years (50% girls) completed the CPTI twice with one-year interval. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the CPTI had strict invariance (i.e., equality of factor patterns, loadings, intercepts, and item uniqueness) across time. Furthermore, the internal consistencies for the CPTI subscales were good at both time points and the stability coefficients over time were moderate. Findings suggest that, in children aged 8 to 12 years old, changes in CPTI scores across time can be attributed to actual changes in the child's psychopathic personality."

The equations of motion of cylindrical shell in terms of stress and moment resultants are derived from the first order shear deformation theory. Irrotational of inviscid fluid are expressed as the wave equation. These two equations are coupled. Strain-displacement relations and stress-strain relations are adopted into the equations of motion to obtain the differential equations with displacements and rotational functions. A system of ordinary differential equation is obtained in one variable by assuming the functions in separable form. Spline of order three is applied to approximate the displacement and rotational functions, together with boundary conditions, to get a generalised eigenvalue problem. The eigenvalue problem is solved for eigen frequency parameter and associate eigenvectors of spline coefficients. The study of frequency parameters are analysed using the parameters the thickness ratio, length ratio, angle-ply, properties of material and number of layers under different boundary conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2954324876,"Adipose tissue is highly involved in whole-body metabolism and is the main site for lipid synthesis, storage and mobilization in ruminants. Therefore, knowledge about adipose tissue responses to different diets is important, especially in growing heifers as the feeding regimes of replacement heifers affect their future success as dairy cows. However, at gene expression level such knowledge is limited. As part of a larger feed trial, adipose tissue biopsies from 24 Norwegian Red heifers were collected at 12 months of age (12MO) and at month seven of gestation (PREG) and analyzed by next-generation mRNA sequencing. Between these two sampling points, all heifers had gone through a successful conception and a feed change from four dietary treatments of high or low energy (HE/LE) and protein (HP/LP) content (treatments LPHE, HPHE, LPLE and HPLE) to a low-energy, low-protein pregnancy feed given to all animals. Gene expression differences between different feed treatments at 12MO are described in an earlier publication from our group. The main objectives of this study were to investigate the long-term effects of diets differing in protein and energy density level on gene expression in adipose tissue of growing replacement dairy heifers. To achieve this, we examined the post-treatment effects between the treatment groups at month seven of gestation; 6 months after the termination of experimental feeding, and the long-term gene expression changes occurring in the adipose tissue between 12MO and PREG. Post-treatment group comparisons showed evidence of long-term effects of dietary treatment on adipose gene expression. Differences between protein treatments were smaller than between energy treatments. Adipose gene expression changes from 12MO to PREG were much larger for the HE than the LE treatments and seemed to mostly be explained by the characteristics of the diet change. 97 genes displayed a unidirectional expression change for all groups from 12MO to PREG, and are considered to be treatment-independent, possibly caused by pregnancy or increased age. This study provides candidate genes and key regulators for further studies on pregnancy preservation (TGFB1, CFD) and metabolic regulation and efficiency (PI3K, RICTOR, MAP4K4,) in dairy cattle."

This paper investigates if price evaluations occur automatically and to what extent these automatic processes can be used to implicitly estimate consumers’ WTP. An adapted version of the task-rule congruency (TRC) paradigm was used in two studies. Results of the first study provided evidence for the notion that prices are automatically evaluated. However, the used procedure had limitations that restricted its utility as an implicit WTP estimate. The procedure was adjusted, and an additional study was conducted. The results of the second study also indicated that prices were evaluated automatically. Additionally, the procedure used during the second study allowed to explore to what extent the observed TRC effects could be used to implicitly estimate consumers’ WTP. Taken together, these studies provided evidence for the notion that prices are evaluated automatically. Furthermore, the procedure has the potential to be further developed into an implicit estimate of consumers’ WTP."
https://openalex.org/W2955296282,"In this study, we compared ultrasound (US) features between normal parotid parenchyma (NPP) and incidental diffuse parotid disease (DPD). From January 2008 to December 2017, 180 patients underwent neck US before parotid surgery at our hospital. From these, 82 were excluded because of the lack of histopathological data concerning the parotid parenchyma or inadequate US images. A single radiologist blinded to the clinicoserological data and histopathological results, retrospectively investigated all US features and categorizations for the parotid glands using a picture archiving and communication system. Retrospective histopathological analysis of the parotid parenchyma was performed by a single pathologist. On the basis of the histopathological analyses, the 98 patients were divided into NPP (n = 70) and DPD (n = 28) groups. Among US features, parenchymal echogenicity and echotexture showed statistically significant differences between the two groups (p < 0.0001), whereas the gland size, margin, and vascularity showed no significant differences (p > 0.05). The US-based categorization significantly differentiated between NPP and DPD (p < 0.0001), and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that US categorization based on ≥2 abnormal US features showed the best diagnostic performance for detecting DPD. Thus, US can aid in differentiating DPD from NPP."
