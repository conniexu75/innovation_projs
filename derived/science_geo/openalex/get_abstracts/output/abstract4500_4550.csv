https://openalex.org/W2072319696,"SV40 infection or transformation of murine cells stimulated the production of a 54K dalton protein that was specifically immunoprecipitated, along with SV40 large T and small t antigens, with sera from mice or hamsters bearing SV40-induced tumors. The same SV40 anti-T sera immunoprecipitated a 54K dalton protein from two different, uninfected murine embryonal carcinoma cell lines. These 54K proteins from SV40-transformed mouse cells and the uninfected embryonal carcinomas cells had identical partial peptide maps which were completely different from the partial peptide map of SV40 large T antigen. An Ad2+ND4-transformed hamster cell line also expressed a 54K protein that was specifically immunoprecipitated by SV40 T sera. The partial peptide maps of the mouse and hamster 54K protein were different, showing the host cell species specificity of these proteins. The 54K hamster protein was also unrelated to the Ad2+ND4 SV40 T antigen. Analogous proteins immunoprecipitated by SV40 T sera, ranging in molecular weight from 44K to 60K, were detected in human and monkey SV40-infected or -transformed cells. A wide variety of sera from hamsters and mice bearing SV40-induced tumors immunoprecipitated the 54K protein of SV40-transformed cells and murine embryonal carcinoma cells. Antibody produced by somatic cell hybrids between a B cell and a myeloma cell (hybridoma) against SV40 large T antigen also immunoprecipitated the 54K protein in virus-infected and -transformed cells, but did not do so in the embryonal carcinoma cell lines. We conclude that SV40 infection or transformation of mouse cells stimulates the synthesis or enhances the stability of a 54K protein. This protein appears to be associated with SV40 T antigen in SV40-infected and -transformed cells, and is co-immunoprecipitated by hybridomas sera to SV40 large T antigen. The 54K protein either shares antigenic determinants with SV40 T antigen or is itself immunogenic when in association with SV40 large T antigen. The protein varies with host cell species, and analogous proteins were observed in hamster, monkey and human cells. The role of this protein in transformation is unclear at present."

The maximal density of supercoiling is obtained at a HU-DNA mass ratio of 1. Reconstituted DNA-HU complexes prefixed with glutaraldehyde appear as condensed circular structures having an average of 14 ""beads"" per circular SV40 DNA molecule, with a ""bead"" diameter of 180 +/- 23 A. The circular SV40 DNA is condensed by a ratio of 2.0-2.5 relative to naked DNA. This is similar to the ratio (2.4) measured for chromatin formed by reassociation of relaxed SV40 DNA with the four core histones."
https://openalex.org/W2125812425,"Fibronectin is a major surface protein of normal animal cells but is absent from many transformed cells. Addition of fibronectin to transformed cells causes increased cell substrate adhesion and changes in the morphology and cytoskeleton of the cells. We have coupled fibronectin to photoactivable chemical cross-linkers and have added it to cells to identify those molecules to which it binds. In this way, fibronectin can be cross-linked to sulfated proteoglycans at the cell surface. The cross-linking is specific for fibronectin. The fibronectin-proteoglycan complex is sensitive to chondroitinase ABC and AC and to trypsin. Addition of fibronectin also affects binding of hyaluronic acid to the cells. These results suggest that fibronectin interacts with proteoglycans at the cell surface. The existence of such interactions may have implications for the role of fibronectin and proteoglycans in cell adhesion."

https://openalex.org/W2087773999,"We have previously demonstrated that in vitro cell lines of mouse thymic lymphomas express surface receptors specific for the retrovirus that induced them. This study extends these observations to an analysis of receptor-bearing cells in the preleukemic and leukemic phases of spontaneous AKR thymic lymphomagenesis. AKR mice regularly begin expressing N-tropic retroviruses (as assayed on NIH fibroblasts by the XC plaque assay) in several tissues early in life; thymic lymphocytes also express these viruses, but are not autonomously transformed. Later thymic lymphomas emerge which are capable of metastasizing in the host of origin or transplanting leukemias into syngeneic hosts. Just prior to the appearance of thymic lymphomas, these mice also begin producing xenotropic retroviruses [as assayed in xenogeneic (For example, mink) fibroblasts], and concomitant with the appearance of the leukemias is the appearance of “recombinant” retroviruses which cause mink fibroblast foci (MCF); these viruses express elements of both N- and X-tropic virus envelopes and N-tropic viral gene products in their cores. Spontaneous AKR leukemias also produce other retroviruses which do not cause XC plaques or mink fibroblast foci; these are called SL viruses. The subject of this study was to test whether in vivo thymocytes in the preleukemic and leukemic periods also bear receptors specific for N-tropic, recombinant MCF and SL AKR retroviruses. We demonstrated that each spontaneous thymic lymphoma does bear receptors that bind viruses produced by the lymphomas and MCF-247 to a high degree and that bind N-ecotropic AKR retroviruses less well. Thymic lymphocytes predominating in the preleukemic period do not express detectable levels of receptors for either of the viruses. In some mice, receptor-positive cells co-exist with receptor-negative cells; only the receptor-positive cells are capable of transplanting leukemia to syngeneic hosts. We conclude that the presence of specific cell surface receptors for lymphoma cell-produced and recombinant AKR retroviruses is a marker for leukemia in these hosts."
https://openalex.org/W1556936132,"Angiotensin II, catecholamines, and vasopressin are thought to stimulate hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis via a cyclic AMP-independent mechanism that requires calcium ion. The present study explores the possibility that angiotensin II and vasopressin control the activity of regulatory enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism through Ca2+-dependent changes in their state of phosphorylation. Intact hepatocytes labeled with [32P]PO43- were stimulated with angiotensin II, glucagon, or vasopressin and 30 to 33 phosphorylated proteins resolved from the cytoplasmic fraction of the cell by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide slab gels. Treatment of the cells with angiotensin II or vasopressin increased the phosphorylation of 10 to 12 of these cytosolic proteins without causing measurable changes in cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity. Glucagon stimulated the phosphorylation of the same set of 11 to 12 proteins through a marked increase in cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity. The molecular weights of three of the protein bands whose phosphorylation was increased by these hormones correspond to the subunit molecular weights of phosphorylase (Mr = 93,000), glycogen synthase (Mr = 85,000), and pyruvate kinase (Mr = 61,000). Two of these phosphoprotein bands were positively identified as phosphorylase and pyruvate kinase by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation, respectively. Incubation of hepatocytes in a Ca2+-free medium completely abolished the effects of angiotensin II and vasopressin on protein phosphorylation but did not alter those of glucagon. Treatment of hepatocytes with angiotensin II, glucagon, or vasopressin stimulated phosphorylase activity by 250 to 260%, inhibited glycogen synthase activity by 50%, and inhibited pyruvate kinase activity by 30 to 35% (peptides) to 70% (glucagon). The effects of angiotensin II and vasopressin on the activity of all three enzymes were completely abolished if the cells were incubated in a Ca2+-free medium while those of glucagon were not altered. The results imply that angiotensin II, catecholamines, and vasopressin control hepatic carbohydrate metabolism through a Ca2+-requiring, cyclic AMP-independent pathway that leads to the phosphorylation of important regulatory enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2042786025,"The tumor promoter phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) induces the production of the serine protease plasminogen activator (PA) in cultures of normal chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) and synergistically enhances PA production in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chick embryo fibroblasts (RSVCEF). Following PMA treatment of serum-free RSVCEF cultures, PA induction is accompanied by distinct morphological changes, including enhanced cell clustering and the formation of dense cellular aggregates. These alterations in the morphology of the PMA-treated transformed cells are inhibited by several protease inhibitors, including leupeptin, NPGB, SBTI, benzamidine and DFP, the specific inhibitor of serine enzymes. A number of protease inhibitors are ineffective in preventing the PMA-induced morphological changes; these include inhibitors of trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, thrombin and, most importantly, plasmin. The use of a fluorescent substrate to assay PA directly demonstrated that the pattern of inhibiton of PA activity correlates exactly with the inhibition of morphological changes. The of 3H-DFP to label and characterize serine zymes in the culture fluid from PMA-treated cells further indicated that PA is the serine protease responsible for the morphological changes. Thus PA itself can catalytically alter cellular behavior in culture independent of plasminogen, until not its only known natural substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1497485906,"Abstract We have shown (Seybert, D., Lambeth, D., and Kamin, H. (1978), J. Biol. Chem. 253, 8355-8358) that, whereas the 1:1 complex between adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin is the active species for cytochrome c reduction, the complex is not sufficient to allow cytochrome P-45011 beta-mediated hydroxylations;adrenodoxin in excess of reductase is required. In the present studies, reduction by NADPH of excess adrenodoxin is shown to occur at a rate sufficient to support both cytochrome P-450 11 beta-mediated hydroxylation of deoxycorticosterone, and cytochrome P-450sec-mediated side chain cleavage of cholesterol. Oxidation-reduction potential and ion effect studies indicate that the mechanism of steroidogenic electron transport involves an adrenodoxin electron rather than a macromolecular complex of reductase, adrenodoxin, and cytochrome. The oxidation-reduction potential of adrenodoxin is shifted about -100 mV when bound to reductase, and reduction of the iron-sulfur protein thus promotes dissociation of the complex. The rate of adrenodoxin reduction is first stimulated, then inhibited by increasing salt; the effect is ion-specific, with Ca2+ approximately Mg2+ greater than Na+ greater than NH/+. Similar ion-specific rate effects are observed for both of the cytochrome P-450-mediated hydroxylations, indicating that the same reduction mechanism is required for these reactions. Increasing salt concentrations caused dissociation of the complex; dissociation of the form of the complex containing reduced adrenodoxin occurred at lower salt concentrations than that containing oxidized adrenodoxin. The order of effectiveness of ions in causing dissociation is the same as the order for stimulation of adrenodoxin reduction, suggesting a dissociation step in the mechanism. This proposed model, together with dissociation constants for the form of the complex containing either oxidized or reduced adrenodoxin, allows accurate prediction of the salt rate effects curve. For all ions, an activity maximum is seen at the ion concentration which produces the largest molar difference between associated-oxidized and dissociated-reduced states, and the model predicts the positions of the maxima for adrenodoxin reduction, 11 beta-hydroxylation, and side chain cleavage. Thus reduction-induced dissociation of adrenodoxin from adrenodoxin reductase appears to be a required step in steroidogenic electron transport by this system, and a role for adrenodoxin as a mobile electron shuttle is proposed."

https://openalex.org/W2087645446,"The sequence of about one third of the polyoma virus genome is presented. This sequence covers the origin of replication of two large plaque strains (A2 and A3) of polyoma virus. The two strains differ by 11 bp in the origin region. A model for replication is suggested. The sequence probably also covers the entire coding region of two of the polyoma virus early proteins--small and middle T antigens--as well as part of the coding region for large T antigen. Over a small region of the DNA, all three coding frames contain termination codons, which argues a need for spliced early messenger RNAs. In another region of the DNA, two coding frames can be used. Correlation with protein data suggests that one frame codes for part of middle T antigen and the other for part of large T antigen."

https://openalex.org/W2085303719,"Persistent light-induced depolarization results from Ca2+ influx across a photoreceptor membrane. The marked dependence on potential of this Ca2+ influx and a Ca2+-dependent K+ efflux accounts for enhancement of the light-induced depolarization when light is paired with rotation. A positive feedback cycle between light-induced depolarization and synaptic depolarization due to stimulus pairing can explain long-lasting behavioral changes produced by associative training but not control paradigms. The sensitivity of this Ca2+ influx to intracellular levels of adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate suggests biochemical steps for this model of associative learning."

https://openalex.org/W1969170917,"Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) composed of phosphatidylserine are capable of encapsulating poliovirus ribonucleic acid (RNA) and delivering it efficiently to cells in an infectious form. The biological activity of vesicle-entrapped poliovirus RNA was 1-2 x 10(4) plaque forming units/nanogram (pfu/ng) and appeared to be enhanced by ribonuclease treatment of the vesicle preparations (infectivity = 1-2 x 10(5) pfu/ng). Vesicle-mediated RNA infection produced equivalent titers in primate and nonprimate cells. Moreover, the data strongly suggest that the ratio of molecules per infectious unit is close to one when the RNA is properly delivered to the cell. A comparative study of LUV and multilamellar vesicles (MLV) indicates that LUV deliver their contents to the cell cytoplasm much more efficiently than MLV. LUV-entrapped poliovirus RNA produced infectious titer 10-100 fold higher than comparable RNA preparations delivered to cells by other techniques."

Only the diastereoisomer with the Rp configuration si a substrate for snake venom phosphodiesterase. The asymmetrically labeled [18O]adenosine 5'-O-phosphorothioate formed in this reaction was converted enzymatically to [18O]adenosine 5'-(1-thiodiphosphate) with the Sp configuration. The position of the 18O label, either bridging [1,2-mu-18O] or nonbridging [1-18O] was then determined. The results show that the reaction catalyzed by snake venom phosphodiesterase takes place with retention of configuration at phosphorus. This indicates that the hydrolysis proceeds via a covalent nucleotide enzyme intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W292784921,"Cytochrome c peroxidase, a cytoplasmically made enzyme located between the inner and outer membrane of yeast mitochondria, is synthesized as larger precursor in a reticulocyte cell-free lysate as well as in pulsed yeast spheroplasts. When the pulsed spheroplasts are chased, the precursor is converted to the mature apoprotein. When the in vitro synthesized precursor is incubated with isolated yeast mitochondria in the absence of protein synthesis, it is cleaved to the mature form; the mature form co-sediments with the mitochondria and is resistant to externally added proteases. These results, in conjunction with those reported earlier (Maccecchini, M.-L., Rudin, Y., Blobel, G., and Schatz, G. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 76, 343-347) suggest that the mechanism of protein transport into the mitochondrial intermembrane space is quite similar to that of protein transport into the matrix or the inner membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1965538122,"SV40-transformed mouse fibroblasts migrate upon, and spontaneously glycosylate, plastic substrates derivatized with chondroitin-6 sulfate and hyaluronic acid. Autoradiography of cultures prelabeled with 3H-glucose and 3H-galactose demonstrates the presence of silver grains near adherent cells. Silver grains are particularly dense near cells cultured on chondroitin sulfate. No significant grains are observed on control dishes or dishes derivatized with polygalacturonic acid. Radioactive material left by cells is not removed by boiling the dishes in 8 M urea and 10% sodium dodecylsulfate, suggesting that it is covalently linked to the derivatized plastic. Acid hydrolysis shows that the radioactive material consists of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine when the prelabeled cells are cultured on hyaluronic acid. When cells are cultured on chondroitin sulfate, the radioactive product consists only of glucuronic and and N-acetylgalactosamine sulfate. Sonicates of prelabeled cells or the supernatants from cultures of intact prelabeled cells add no SDS-urea-resistant radioactivity to dishes derivatized with these glycosaminoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W1594271424,"Incubation of 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine with the catalytic subunit of bovine cardiac muscle cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase led to the formation of an inactive enzyme irreversibly modified with approximately one mol of reagent per mol of subunit. The inactivation reaction followed pseudofirst order kinetics. The rate of inactivation at various reagent concentrations exhibited saturation kinetics implying that the reagent reversibly binds to the enzyme prior to inactivation. The addition of MgATP, MgADP, or MgAMP-PNP to the reaction mixture fully protected the enzyme from inactivation by 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine. The reagent was demonstrated to be a competitive inhibitor of MgATP with a Ki of 0.235 mM. Metal-free nucleotides were without effect upon the reaction rate while metal ions alone accelerated the inactivation rate up to 7-fold. The inclusion of casein or synthetic peptide substrate in the incubation mixture did not affect the reaction kinetics. Reaction of 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine with the kinase subunit exhibits all of the characteristics of affinity labeling of the MgATP-binding site."

The observed hyperfine structure appears consistent with hyperfine coupling to copper; although to account for all of the observed structure, an additional magnetic interaction is required as well. This work points out the utility of the 2 to 4 GHz EPR technique for resolving electronic hyperfine structural information from copper and possibly other paramagnetic sites in biomolecules when random variation in electronic g values is a cause of EPR line-broadening."

https://openalex.org/W1665686996,Abstract An enzyme fraction from the green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa that catalyzes the reversible epimerization of guanosine 5'-diphosphate D-mannose to guanosine 5'-diphosphate L-galactose brings about the incorporation of tritium from tritium-labeled water into the hexosyl moieties of those sugar nucleotides. The hexoses were degraded by periodate oxidation whereby the tritium was found to be equally distributed between carbon atoms 3 and 5. That observation was taken to imply that the epimerizations proceed via ene-diol intermediates.
https://openalex.org/W1519357067,"The Ca2+ content of glial tumor (C6) cells was reduced approximately 5-fold by repeated treatment with media containing ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) without loss of cellular viability. The ability of the cells to accumulate cAMP in response to beta-adrenergic agonists was reduced 60 to 70% following Ca2+ depletion. Ca2+ did not affect the apparent KACT for norepinephrine, nor did it change the concentration of propranolol required to produce 50% inhibition of the maximal norepinephrine response. Phentolamine did not alter the Ca2+ dependence of the response. The binding of dihydroalprenolol by intact C6 cells was not influenced by Ca2+. Furthermore, pretreatment with norepinephrine did not affect the Ca2+ dependence of cAMP accumulation. The effects of Ca2+, therefore, appeared to be exerted on components of the adenylate cyclase system other than the catecholamine receptor. Micromolar free Ca2+ concentration in the extracellular medium were sufficient to restore a maximal norepinephrine response to Ca2+-depeleted cells. The effect of Ca2+ on cAMP accumulation in response to hormone was immediate and was rapidly reversible upon the addition of EGTA in excess of the cation. Cells in media containing Ca2+ exhibited a characteristic biphasic time course of cAMP accumulation; with Ca2+-depleted cells cAMP was accumulated more slowly and the subsequent decline in cAMP content was also reduced. Verapamil, an inhibitor of plasmalemmal Ca2+ influx, decreased the Ca2+-dependent component of the cAMP accumulation when added prior to the cation. The effect of Ca2+ on cAMP accumulation was reduced more extensively by pretreatment of cells at 45 degrees C under Ca2+-depleted (80% loss) than under Ca2+-restored (30% loss) conditions. Trifluoperazine at micromolar concentrations decreased the Ca2+-dependent increment in accumulation of cAMP in Ca2+-restored cells. This inhibition was not overcome by increasing concentrations of norepinephrine or of extracellular Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W2031110815,A low molecular weight (LMW) protein phosphokinase enzyme that binds to actin has been isolated from murine sarcoma virions; this kinase activity is not present in nontransforming murine leukemia viruses. Sephadex G-75 gel filtration and affinity chromatography on actin-Sepharose conjugates allow a significant level of purification of this enzyme. The enzyme associates with microtubular proteins and inhibits the in vitro polymerization of microtubules. This study represents the first isolation of a sarcoma virus-associated protein that possesses the ability to interact directly with two major components of the cytoskeletal system.

The Km value for the reaction with this substrate was high (approximately 18 mM) compared to the Km values reported for the analogous threonine and serine-containing peptides, which were 0.59 mM and 0.016 mM, respectively (Kemp, B.E., Graves, D.J., Benjamini, E., and Krebs, E.G.

Phosphate esterified to hydroxyproline present in the peptide was relatively stable in hot alkali, only 10% being released as Pi within 30 min in 0.1 N NaOH at 100 degrees C, whereas all of the phosphate was released from the phosphoserine peptide analogue under these conditions. Phosphohydroxyproline in the peptide was also more stable to acid (5.7 N HCl, 110 degrees C) than phosphoserine, the time for 50% release as Pi being 15 h in contrast to 6 h for the latter."

https://openalex.org/W1605648388,"The cAMP receptor on the surface of aggregation competent Dictyostelium discoideum cells specifically binds [3H]cAMP in an oscillatory manner with a periodicity of 2 min. The oscillatory cAMP-binding component is developmentallly regulated and has the nucleotide specificity expected for recognition of chemotactic signals. The concentration dependence of the peak amplitudes of cAMP binding exhibit an apparent threshold at 10(-8) M cAMP. The threshold concentration for cAMP binding that we measure is consistent with the concentration dependence of signal relay (cAMP secretion) and the chemotactic response. The kinetic data of binding and dissociation are very rapid, consistent with the time course of oscillations in receptor capacity (affinity). Specific binding oscillations are destroyed by heat or chymotrypsin but are insensitive to trypsin or glycosidase. A plasma membrane localization of receptor is supported by enrichment of cAMP binding in a plasma membrane preparation from differentiated cells. Receptor oscillations with a 2-min period are preserved in the membrane preparations, and the peak amplitudes are increased about 10-fold consistent with the enrichment of other plasma membrane markers. The alternating change in the receptor's binding capacity for cAMP may be the basis of the relay refractory period as well as the primary oscillator involved in the generation of postreceptor events such as stimulation of adenylate cyclase, cAMP secretion, and cellular movement, all of which have been previously shown to oscillate."

https://openalex.org/W1517953287,"All the lysines of horse heart cytochrome c were maleylated yielding a low spin product. At room temperature and low salt concentration, this product lacked the 695 nm absorption band and showed tryptophan fluorescence and circular dichroic spectra typical of denatured cytochrome c. The 695 nm band and the native tryptophan fluorescence and circular dichroic spectra were restored by addition of salts, their effectiveness being dependent on the charge of the cation. On low salt concentration, the 695 nm band was also restored by lowering the temperature. Studies of the temperature dependence of the 695 nm band indicate that the thermal denaturation of maleylated cytochrome c occurs at temperatures 60-70 degrees C lower than in the native protein. This implies a destabilization of the native conformation by 5.6 kcal/mol; a similar value is evidenced by comparative urea denaturation studies on the native and modified proteins. The results confirm the assumption that the native conformation of cytochrome c is mostly determined by interactions involving internal residues."

https://openalex.org/W1523698767,"The susceptibility of the DNA in chromatin to single strand-specific nucleases was examined using nuclease P1, mung bean nuclease, and venom phosphodiesterase. A stage in the reaction exists where the size range of the solubilized products is similar for each of the three nucleases and is nearly independent of incubation time. During this stage, the chromatin fragments sediment in the range of 30 to 100 S and contain duplex DNA ranging from 1 to 10 million daltons. Starting with chromatin depleted of histones H1 and H5 similar fragments are generated. In both cases these nucleoprotein fragments are reduced to nucleosomes and their multimers by micrococcal nuclease. Thus, chromatin contains a limited number of DNA sites which are susceptible to single strand-specific nucleases. These sites occur at intervals of 8 to 80 nucleosomes and are distributed throughout the chromatin. Nucleosome monomers, dimers, or trimers were not observed at any stage of single strand-specific nuclease digestion of nuclei, H1- and H5-depleted chromatin, or micrococcal nuclease-generated oligonucleosomes. Each of the three nucleases converted mononucleosomes (approximately 160 base pairs) to nucleosome cores (approximately 140 base pairs) probably by exonucleolytic action that was facilitated by the prior removal of H1 and H5.

Removal of the protein synthesis inhibitor caused both transformed cells to revert to the transformed phenotype. The demonstration of cell-surface antigens, cross-reacted with antiserums induced by extracts of both types of transformed human cells, was dependent on the presence or absence of cycloheximide in the culture medium. The results show that protein synthesis is required to maintain the transformed state in virally or chemically transformed human cells."
