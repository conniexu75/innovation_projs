https://openalex.org/W2083462941,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be generated from differentiated human and mouse somatic cells using transcription factors such as Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. It is possible to augment the reprogramming process with chemical compounds, but issues related to low reprogramming efficiencies and, with a number of protocols, residual vector sequences, remain to be resolved. We show here that it is possible to reprogram mouse and human cells to pluripotency by direct transfection of mature double-stranded microRNAs (miRNAs). Our approaches use a combination of mir-200c plus mir-302 s and mir-369 s family miRNAs. Because this reprogramming method does not require vector-based gene transfer, it holds significant potential for biomedical research and regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2127783517,"Fernando Pardo-Manuel de Villena, Gary Churchill and colleagues provide a high-resolution phylogenetic map of mouse inbred strains based on comparisons to wild-caught mice. They show that the genomes of classical strains are overwhelmingly derived from Mus musculus domesticus whereas wild-derived laboratory strains include a broad sampling of diversity from multiple subspecies with pervasive introgression. The subspecific origin, haplotype diversity and identity-by-descent map of laboratory strains can be visualized at http://msub.csbio.unc.edu/PhylogenyTool.html . Here we provide a genome-wide, high-resolution map of the phylogenetic origin of the genome of most extant laboratory mouse inbred strains. Our analysis is based on the genotypes of wild-caught mice from three subspecies of Mus musculus. We show that classical laboratory strains are derived from a few fancy mice with limited haplotype diversity. Their genomes are overwhelmingly Mus musculus domesticus in origin, and the remainder is mostly of Japanese origin. We generated genome-wide haplotype maps based on identity by descent from fancy mice and show that classical inbred strains have limited and non-randomly distributed genetic diversity. In contrast, wild-derived laboratory strains represent a broad sampling of diversity within M. musculus. Intersubspecific introgression is pervasive in these strains, and contamination by laboratory stocks has played a role in this process. The subspecific origin, haplotype diversity and identity by descent maps can be visualized using the Mouse Phylogeny Viewer (see URLs)."
https://openalex.org/W2167034214,"Unlike most plants, date palms are either male or female. Assembly of a draft date palm genome, the first for a member of the order Arecales, reveals loci linked to gender and provides markers for improving traits such as fruit quality and ripening time. Date palm is one of the most economically important woody crops cultivated in the Middle East and North Africa and is a good candidate for improving agricultural yields in arid environments. Nonetheless, long generation times (5–8 years) and dioecy (separate male and female trees) have complicated its cultivation and genetic analysis. To address these issues, we assembled a draft genome for a Khalas variety female date palm, the first publicly available resource of its type for a member of the order Arecales. The ∼380 Mb sequence, spanning mainly gene-rich regions, includes >25,000 gene models and is predicted to cover ∼90% of genes and ∼60% of the genome. Sequencing of eight other cultivars, including females of the Deglet Noor and Medjool varieties and their backcrossed males, identified >3.5 million polymorphic sites, including >10,000 genic copy number variations. A small subset of these polymorphisms can distinguish multiple varieties. We identified a region of the genome linked to gender and found evidence that date palm employs an XY system of gender inheritance."
https://openalex.org/W2085063270,"The Rbfox family of RNA binding proteins mediate alternative splicing. Douglas Black and colleagues show that targeted deletion of the mouse Rbfox1 gene in the CNS alters splice isoforms of a subset of genes and is associated with neural hyperexcitability with spontaneous and drug-induced seizures. The Rbfox family of RNA binding proteins regulates alternative splicing of many important neuronal transcripts, but its role in neuronal physiology is not clear1. We show here that central nervous system–specific deletion of the gene encoding Rbfox1 results in heightened susceptibility to spontaneous and kainic acid–induced seizures. Electrophysiological recording revealed a corresponding increase in neuronal excitability in the dentate gyrus of the knockout mice. Whole-transcriptome analyses identified multiple splicing changes in the Rbfox1−/− brain with few changes in overall transcript abundance. These splicing changes alter proteins that mediate synaptic transmission and membrane excitation. Thus, Rbfox1 directs a genetic program required in the prevention of neuronal hyperexcitation and seizures. The Rbfox1 knockout mice provide a new model to study the post-transcriptional regulation of synaptic function."

https://openalex.org/W2163751790,"Richard Lang and colleagues identify a mechanism by which myeloid cells regulate the pattern of blood-vessel branching in the post-natal retina. They show that macrophages inhibit branching by secreting Wnt ligands that use a non-canonical pathway to induce secretion of the VEGF inhibitory receptor Flt1. Myeloid cells are a feature of most tissues. Here we show that during development, retinal myeloid cells (RMCs) produce Wnt ligands to regulate blood vessel branching. In the mouse retina, where angiogenesis occurs postnatally1, somatic deletion in RMCs of the Wnt ligand transporter Wntless2,3 results in increased angiogenesis in the deeper layers. We also show that mutation of Wnt5a and Wnt11 results in increased angiogenesis and that these ligands elicit RMC responses via a non-canonical Wnt pathway. Using cultured myeloid-like cells and RMC somatic deletion of Flt1, we show that an effector of Wnt-dependent suppression of angiogenesis by RMCs is Flt1, a naturally occurring inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)4,5,6. These findings indicate that resident myeloid cells can use a non-canonical, Wnt–Flt1 pathway to suppress angiogenic branching."
https://openalex.org/W2025855348,"The four-chambered mammalian heart develops from two fields of cardiac progenitor cells distinguished by their spatiotemporal patterns of differentiation and contributions to the definitive heart. The first heart field differentiates earlier in lateral plate mesoderm, generates the linear heart tube and ultimately gives rise to the left ventricle. The second heart field (SHF) differentiates later in pharyngeal mesoderm, elongates the heart tube, and gives rise to the outflow tract and much of the right ventricle. Because hearts in lower vertebrates contain a rudimentary outflow tract but not a right ventricle, the existence and function of SHF-like cells in these species has remained a topic of speculation. Here we provide direct evidence from Cre/Lox-mediated lineage tracing and loss-of-function studies in zebrafish, a lower vertebrate with a single ventricle, that latent TGF-β binding protein 3 (ltbp3) transcripts mark a field of cardiac progenitor cells with defining characteristics of the anterior SHF in mammals. Specifically, ltbp3(+) cells differentiate in pharyngeal mesoderm after formation of the heart tube, elongate the heart tube at the outflow pole, and give rise to three cardiovascular lineages in the outflow tract and myocardium in the distal ventricle. In addition to expressing Ltbp3, a protein that regulates the bioavailability of TGF-β ligands, zebrafish SHF cells co-express nkx2.5, an evolutionarily conserved marker of cardiac progenitor cells in both fields. Embryos devoid of ltbp3 lack the same cardiac structures derived from ltbp3(+) cells due to compromised progenitor proliferation. Furthermore, small-molecule inhibition of TGF-β signalling phenocopies the ltbp3-morphant phenotype whereas expression of a constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor rescues it. Taken together, our findings uncover a requirement for ltbp3-TGF-β signalling during zebrafish SHF development, a process that serves to enlarge the single ventricular chamber in this species."
https://openalex.org/W2124805860,"As embryos develop, cells differentiate and produce new repertoires of gene regulatory proteins. Conventional studies of one or a few genes at a time do not reveal which events drive such dynamic changes. Isabelle Peter and Eric Davidson now present a functional dissection of the large gene regulatory network involved in meso-endodermic specification in the sea urchin embryo. The resulting global view reveals unexpected mechanisms for the separation of these early cell lineages and for the regional specification of later derivatives such as the various segments of the gut. Specification of endoderm is the prerequisite for gut formation in the embryogenesis of bilaterian organisms. Modern lineage labelling studies1,2,3 have shown that in the sea urchin embryo model system, descendants of the veg1 and veg2 cell lineages produce the endoderm, and that the veg2 lineage also gives rise to mesodermal cell types. It is known that Wnt/β-catenin signalling is required for endoderm specification4,5,6 and Delta/Notch signalling is required for mesoderm specification7,8,9. Some direct cis-regulatory targets of these signals have been found10,11 and various phenomenological patterns of gene expression have been observed in the pre-gastrular endomesoderm. However, no comprehensive, causal explanation of endoderm specification has been conceived for sea urchins, nor for any other deuterostome. Here we propose a model, on the basis of the underlying genomic control system, that provides such an explanation, built at several levels of biological organization. The hardwired core of the control system consists of the cis-regulatory apparatus of endodermal regulatory genes, which determine the relationship between the inputs to which these genes are exposed and their outputs. The architecture of the network circuitry controlling the dynamic process of endoderm specification then explains, at the system level, a sequence of developmental logic operations, which generate the biological process. The control system initiates non-interacting endodermal and mesodermal gene regulatory networks in veg2-derived cells and extinguishes the endodermal gene regulatory network in mesodermal precursors. It also generates a cross-regulatory network that specifies future anterior endoderm in veg2 descendants and institutes a distinct network specifying posterior endoderm in veg1-derived cells. The network model provides an explanatory framework that relates endoderm specification to the genomic regulatory code."
https://openalex.org/W2071004446,"Carette et al. use a retroviral gene-trap vector to disrupt and tag >98% of all genes in a haploid human cancer cell line. Cells selected for a phenotype of interest are pooled and characterized by parallel DNA sequencing to circumvent time- and labor-intensive screening of individual clones. Insertional mutagenesis in a haploid background can disrupt gene function1. We extend our earlier work by using a retroviral gene-trap vector to generate insertions in >98% of the genes expressed in a human cancer cell line that is haploid for all but one of its chromosomes. We apply phenotypic interrogation via tag sequencing (PhITSeq) to examine millions of mutant alleles through selection and parallel sequencing. Analysis of pools of cells, rather than individual clones1 enables rapid assessment of the spectrum of genes involved in the phenotypes under study. This facilitates comparative screens as illustrated here for the family of cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs). CDTs are virulence factors secreted by a variety of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria responsible for tissue damage at distinct anatomical sites2. We identify 743 mutations distributed over 12 human genes important for intoxication by four different CDTs. Although related CDTs may share host factors, they also exploit unique host factors to yield a profile characteristic for each CDT."
https://openalex.org/W1991876528,"CPT1a (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a) in the liver mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) catalyzes the primary regulated step in overall mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. It has been suggested that the fundamental unit of CPT1a exists as a trimer, which, under native conditions, could form a dimer of the trimers, creating a hexamer channel for acylcarnitine translocation. To examine the state of CPT1a in the MOM, we employed a combined approach of sizing by mass and isolation using an immunological method. Blue native electrophoresis followed by detection with immunoblotting and mass spectrometry identified large molecular mass complexes that contained not only CPT1a but also long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL) and the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). Immunoprecipitation with antisera against the proteins revealed a strong interaction between the three proteins. Immobilized CPT1a-specific antibodies immunocaptured not only CPT1a but also ACSL and VDAC, further strengthening findings with blue native electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation. This study shows strong protein-protein interaction between CPT1a, ACSL, and VDAC. We propose that this complex transfers activated fatty acids through the MOM.

IntroductionLong chain fatty acids, an important energy source in mitochondria, are oxidized in the matrix via β-oxidation. Long chain fatty acids are activated on the cytosolic side of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) 2The abbreviations used are: MOMmitochondrial outer membraneACSLlong chain acyl-CoA synthetaseVDACvoltage-dependent anion channelBNEblue native electrophoresis. by long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL) (1Bhuiyan J. Pritchard P.H. Pande S.V. Seccombe D.W. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 1185-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To be metabolized, activated fatty acids, as well as other substrates, ions, and nucleotides, cross the MOM through the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), also called mitochondrial porin.Historically, the MOM was considered to be a sieve through which small compounds passed unimpeded. That view is no longer tenable. In Trypanosoma brucei, which expresses only one VDAC, knock-out of VDAC leads to mitochondria that no longer oxidize substrates (2Pusnik M. Charrière F. Mäser P. Waller R.F. Dagley M.J. Lithgow T. Schneider A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2009; 26: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, with disruption of the outer membrane, the mitoplasts are fully capable of oxidizing substrates. These studies highlight the essential role of VDAC in mitochondrial substrate oxidation in transportation of small anion substrates through the MOM.We studied PA22, a 22-kDa polyanion VDAC inhibitor (3Turkaly P. Kerner J. Hoppel C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), in mitochondrial substrate oxidation and observed that ADP-stimulated glutamate, succinate, (+rotenone), and palmitoylcarnitine (+malate) oxidation rates were unaffected. However, oxidation of palmitate (+ATP, Mg2+, CoA, carnitine, and malate) and palmitoyl-CoA (+carnitine and malate) was inhibited at 1–2 nmol of PA22/mg of mitochondrial protein. These data indicate that PA22 is selective for the first two steps in fatty acid oxidation without affecting other substrates. Additionally, we showed that PA22 interacts with VDAC by demonstrating that binding of hexokinase to rat liver mitochondria was inhibited by PA22 (3Turkaly P. Kerner J. Hoppel C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). VDAC was initially identified as the hexokinase-binding protein (4Felgner P.L. Messer J.L. Wilson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4946-4949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).PA10, a 10-kDa polyanion VDAC inhibitor (5König T. Stipani I. Horvàth I. Palmieri F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1982; 14: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), decreases ADP-stimulated oxidation of glutamate, malate, and succinate. The inhibition of glutamate oxidation is relieved by high ADP or an uncoupler. In our studies, we showed that PA10 inhibited palmitoyl-CoA (+carnitine and malate) oxidation but that this inhibition was not relieved by high ADP. PA10 binds to VDAC as shown in electrophysiological experiments (6Colombini M. Yeung C.L. Tung J. König T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 905: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In 1999, the reason for the specificity of the two polyanions was not apparent. However, we are now aware of three VDAC isoforms and that knock-outs of these produce different phenotypes (7Cesar Mde C. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 422: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mitochondria from VDAC1 knock-out mice, in particular, have a defect in ADP-stimulated oxidation (8Anflous K. Armstrong D.D. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1954-1960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which is relieved by an uncoupler, whereas mitochondria from VDAC3 knock-out mice do not have any oxidative defects (9Anflous-Pharayra K. Lee N. Armstrong D.L. Craigen W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1807: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). VDAC also exists at the same time in different substates (10Craigen W.J. Graham B.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2008; 40: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These data indicate that VDAC1 transports ADP, although this is not the case for VDAC3 and is consistent with differing substrate specificity for VDACs.The carnitine-dependent transport of activated fatty acids is catalyzed by CPT1a (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a), an integral outer membrane protein that converts activated fatty acids into acylcarnitines (11McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Using size exclusion chromatography and blue native electrophoresis (BNE) of extracts of mitochondria isolated from livers of fed rats or Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing CPT1a, Faye et al. (12Faye A. Esnous C. Price N.T. Onfray M.A. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26908-26916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) reported that CPT1a exists as a trimer, which, under native conditions, dimerizes to form hexamers. The authors proposed that trimeric CPT1a is arranged to form channels allowing acylcarnitines to enter the intermembrane space. Additionally, Jenei et al. (13Jenei Z.A. Borthwick K. Zammit V.A. Dixon A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6988-6997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) suggested that the interaction between the GXXXG and GXXXA motifs within transmembrane domain 2 of CPT1a leads to the hexamerization and stabilization of recombinant CPT1a. However, the conclusion that CPT1a exists as a homo-oligomer is based solely on the finding that the observed higher molecular mass species of CPT1a could be accounted for by multiples of the monomeric mass of CPT1a. The important question is whether the hexameric CPT1a channel acylcarnitines or CPT1a forms hetero-oligomeric complexes with other metabolically relevant enzymes and channel proteins such as ACSL and VDAC that are responsible for channeling activated fatty acids through the MOM into the mitochondrial intermembrane space.To examine the state of CPT1a in the MOM, we used an approach that combined sizing by mass and isolation using immunological methods. BNE of rat liver MOM extracts revealed the presence of several higher molecular mass bands that contained CPT1a, ACSL, and VDAC. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation with CPT1a-specific antibodies and antisera against ACSL and VDAC revealed a strong interaction between the proteins. These data strongly suggest that CPT1a forms hetero-oligomeric complexes with ACSL and VDAC and is part of an outer membrane fatty acid transfer complex.DISCUSSIONUsing a multifaceted approach, i.e. BNE and immunoprecipitation/immunocapture, we have demonstrated a strong physical interaction between the MOM proteins CPT1a, ACSL, and VDAC. Such interactions are expected if CPT1a, ACSL, and VDAC form a complex in the MOM, and the complex withstands detergent extraction from the membrane and isolation by BNE and immunocapture. All three proteins are highly hydrophobic integral membrane proteins with two (CPT1a and ACSL) or more (VDAC) transmembrane segments. Because the complex resists the high ionic strength encountered during immunoisolation, hydrophobic interactions between the individual proteins must form and stabilize the complex. The presence of CPT1a, ACSL, and VDAC in several bands with differing molecular masses suggests the presence of hetero-oligomeric complexes with differing stoichiometry of the individual components. Other proteins were identified by mass spectrometry, and because the Mascot scores were higher than the acceptance criteria as described under “Experimental Procedures,” we elected to list these proteins without discussing the data. The list of these other proteins, identified in each BNE band, is provided in supplemental Table S1.Using chemical cross-linking of rat liver mitochondria and yeast mitochondria expressing CPT1a followed by SDS-PAGE, Faye et al. (12Faye A. Esnous C. Price N.T. Onfray M.A. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26908-26916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) reported that CPT1a exists as a homo-oligomeric trimer. Upon BNE and size exclusion chromatography of rat liver mitochondrial extracts, CPT1a behaved as a hexamer. In these experiments, CPT1a was identified by Western blotting, and the assignment of the observed higher molecular mass species as oligomeric forms of CPT1a was based on the finding that these higher molecular masses could be accounted for by multiples of the monomeric mass of CPT1a. In subsequent studies, Jenei et al. (13Jenei Z.A. Borthwick K. Zammit V.A. Dixon A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6988-6997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) reported that CPT1a exists as a hexamer and that the oligomerization state is reduced to trimers during isolation and storage of the mitochondria. The presence of other proteins was not investigated in the respective bands or fractions in either of these two studies.The data from immunocapture, reverse immunoprecipitation of CPT1a with anti-ACSL and anti-VDAC1 antisera, and BNE experiments indicate that these three proteins associate in the MOM to form hetero-oligomeric complexes of different molecular masses. This raises a question about the function(s) of these complexes as well as questions about membrane topology and the stoichiometry of the individual component proteins.The migration of protein complexes on BNE depends on the amount of the negatively charged dye bound by the complexes. The size estimation of complexes is not accurate because dye-binding sites can be masked by protein-protein interactions between the individual proteins present in the complexes. Furthermore, the surface charge of the complex is affected by the hydrophilic or hydrophobic nature of the individual proteins that make up the complexes, especially with membrane proteins where lipids also may be present. The dimeric form of ACSL has been reported as the active form in rat and in S. cerevisiae (24Bar-Tana J. Rose G. Shapiro B. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 25Li H. Melton E.M. Quackenbush S. DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 1246-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and VDAC has been described as a dimer or tetramer (26Keinan N. Tyomkin D. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 5698-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 27Zalk R. Israelson A. Garty E.S. Azoulay-Zohar H. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). On the basis of these findings, we estimated the possible composition of the band at 280 kDa as consisting of a CPT1a monomer, an ACSL dimer, and a VDAC dimer that yield a sum of 296 kDa. The other bands require direct determination of the stoichiometry.Previously, we showed that in rat liver mitochondria, PA22 inhibits oxidation of palmitate and palmitoyl-CoA but does not inhibit palmitoylcarnitine oxidation or CPT1a activity (3Turkaly P. Kerner J. Hoppel C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The conundrum of PA22 inhibition of palmitoyl-CoA oxidation without affecting palmitoylcarnitine oxidation suggested to us that there was a step in palmitoyl-CoA oxidation that occurred before CPT1a but after ACSL that had not been identified. We then focused on the step for moving palmitoyl-CoA from its site of production, the outer surface of outer membrane, to CPT1a. We entertained VDAC as a candidate to explain the inhibition of palmitoyl-CoA oxidation without inhibition of palmitoylcarnitine oxidation. The data from these published studies showed that PA22 interacts with VDAC. Therefore, VDAC appears to be an appropriate target that moves anions into the intermembrane space. If that step is inhibited, the active site of CPT1a must face in, not out.On the basis of these data, we postulated a model in which long chain fatty acids are activated by ACSL on the cytosolic side of the MOM and the activated acyl-CoA esters gain access to the mitochondrial intermembrane space via VDAC. The acyl-CoAs are then converted to acylcarnitine by CPT1a on the intermembrane side of the MOM (28Kerner J. Hoppel C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). In this model, the catalytic site of ACSL faces the cytosol, and the catalytic site of CPT1a faces the intermembrane space, in agreement with the data from Murthy and Pande (29Murthy M.S. Pande S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, the approach of Zammit and co-workers (30Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), using agarose-coupled acyl-CoA in which the acyl-CoA was rendered incapable of crossing the MOM, suggested the opposite orientation for the catalytic site of CPT1a. Thus, there is evidence to support both the cytosolic and the intermembrane orientation of the catalytic site of CPT1a. Structural studies of the topology of CPT1a in the outer membrane are required to resolve this issue.Our data show that CPT1a was immunocaptured with ACSL and VDAC, consistent with the postulation that they compose an outer membrane fatty acid transfer complex (28Kerner J. Hoppel C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The catalytic advantage of physical association or interaction between ACSL, VDAC, and CPT1a is that it favors direct channeling of the intermediates from the outer surface of the MOM into the intermembrane space. A model that depicts the coordinated action of ACSL, VDAC, and CPT1a in channeling activated fatty acids through the MOM is presented in Fig. 4. In this model, long chain fatty acids are activated by ACSL on the cytosolic side of the MOM, and the activated fatty acids move into the intermembrane space through VDAC, where the acyl-CoAs are converted to the respective acylcarnitines by CPT1a.In an alternative topological model of CPT1a, the catalytic (and regulatory) site faces the cytosol (30Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 31Zammit V.A. Fraser F. Orstorphine C.G. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and the homo-oligomerization of CPT1a monomers to trimers or hexamers provides the structural basis for a channel allowing the acylcarnitine formed on the cytosolic side of the MOM to enter the intermembrane space (12Faye A. Esnous C. Price N.T. Onfray M.A. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26908-26916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Jenei Z.A. Borthwick K. Zammit V.A. Dixon A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6988-6997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Except for the formation of a channel for acylcarnitine translocation, it is difficult to envisage from the available experimental data the functional advantage of CPT1a homo-oligomerization. Based on target size analysis, the functional or catalytic unit of CPT1a is the monomeric form (32Zammit V.A. Corstorphine C.G. Kolodziej M.P. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, in the homo-oligomeric state, each monomer functions independently, with no cooperation between the individual monomers. Furthermore, the homo-oligomerization state of CPT1a is not altered by fasting or by streptozotocin-induced diabetes (12Faye A. Esnous C. Price N.T. Onfray M.A. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26908-26916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), conditions known to result in increased catalytic activity and decreased malonyl-CoA sensitivity. Thus, neither the catalytic activity nor the regulatory property of CPT1a is affected by homo-oligomerization.In addition to the above studies showing hetero- and homo-oligomerization of CPT1a, there also are reports on the association of CPT1b with the fatty acid transport proteins CD36/fatty acid translocase and FATP1 (33Campbell S.E.

This association of CPT1b with CD36 or FATP1 is reported to facilitate the mitochondrial oxidation of long chain fatty acids. We documented the presence of CD36/fatty acid translocase in highly purified rat liver MOMs (16Distler A.M. Kerner J. Peterman S.M. Hoppel C.L. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 356: 18-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); however, in the present study using mass spectrometry, we could not detect CD36 in either BNE or immunoisolation experiments. Also, the oxidation of palmitoyl-CoA and palmitoylcarnitine in heart and skeletal muscle mitochondria isolated from CD36 knock-out mice was identical to that in wild-type mice (36King K.L. Stanley W.C. Rosca M. Kerner J. Hoppel C.L. Febbraio M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 467: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).In addition to CPT1 and ACSL, VDAC has been shown to associate with other proteins, forming heteromeric complexes involved in mitochondrial energy exchange and in cholesterol transport into the mitochondrial matrix for steroid synthesis (37Brdiczka D.G. Zorov D.B. Sheu S.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1762: 148-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 38Gavish M. Bachman I. Shoukrun R. Katz Y. Veenman L. Weisinger G. Weizman A. Pharmacol.

In mitochondrial contact sites, VDAC can be associated with the adenine nucleotide translocator, an integral inner membrane protein, and with hexokinase in the cytosol or creatine kinase in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. These complexes play an important role in mitochondrial energy exchange as well as in apoptosis (37Brdiczka D.G. Zorov D.B. Sheu S.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1762: 148-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 39Vyssokikh M. Brdiczka D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 256–257: 117-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VDAC forms a hetero-oligomeric complex with the adenine nucleotide translocator and the 18-kDa benzodiazepine-binding protein, called the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. In steroidogenic tissues, the receptor complex represents the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis through regulation of cholesterol transport from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix (38Gavish M. Bachman I. Shoukrun R. Katz Y. Veenman L. Weisinger G. Weizman A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 629-650PubMed Google Scholar).The common denominator in the heteromeric complexes described above is the MOM protein VDAC. The question then arises as to how VDAC can perform different transport functions and what governs its association with proteins of the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes, cytosol, and mitochondrial intermembrane space. The answer possibly lies in the fact that 1) VDAC is the most abundant protein in the MOM, representing ∼5–10% of the total MOM protein; 2) VDAC is expressed in three isoforms (VDAC1–3), and all three isoforms are present in most tissues but in different amounts (40Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18966-18973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar); and 3) all three VDAC isoforms are post-translationally modified mainly by phosphorylation and acetylation (41Deng W.J.

The functional relevance of these different complexes is unknown at present. Further studies are needed to determine the stoichiometry of individual protein components as well as their functional relevance to these complexes in different nutritional and disease states such as feeding, starvation, and diabetes. IntroductionLong chain fatty acids, an important energy source in mitochondria, are oxidized in the matrix via β-oxidation. Long chain fatty acids are activated on the cytosolic side of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) 2The abbreviations used are: MOMmitochondrial outer membraneACSLlong chain acyl-CoA synthetaseVDACvoltage-dependent anion channelBNEblue native electrophoresis. by long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL) (1Bhuiyan J. Pritchard P.H. Pande S.V. Seccombe D.W. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 1185-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To be metabolized, activated fatty acids, as well as other substrates, ions, and nucleotides, cross the MOM through the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), also called mitochondrial porin.Historically, the MOM was considered to be a sieve through which small compounds passed unimpeded. That view is no longer tenable. In Trypanosoma brucei, which expresses only one VDAC, knock-out of VDAC leads to mitochondria that no longer oxidize substrates (2Pusnik M. Charrière F. Mäser P. Waller R.F. Dagley M.J. Lithgow T. Schneider A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2009; 26: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, with disruption of the outer membrane, the mitoplasts are fully capable of oxidizing substrates. These studies highlight the essential role of VDAC in mitochondrial substrate oxidation in transportation of small anion substrates through the MOM.We studied PA22, a 22-kDa polyanion VDAC inhibitor (3Turkaly P. Kerner J. Hoppel C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), in mitochondrial substrate oxidation and observed that ADP-stimulated glutamate, succinate, (+rotenone), and palmitoylcarnitine (+malate) oxidation rates were unaffected. However, oxidation of palmitate (+ATP, Mg2+, CoA, carnitine, and malate) and palmitoyl-CoA (+carnitine and malate) was inhibited at 1–2 nmol of PA22/mg of mitochondrial protein. These data indicate that PA22 is selective for the first two steps in fatty acid oxidation without affecting other substrates. Additionally, we showed that PA22 interacts with VDAC by demonstrating that binding of hexokinase to rat liver mitochondria was inhibited by PA22 (3Turkaly P. Kerner J. Hoppel C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). VDAC was initially identified as the hexokinase-binding protein (4Felgner P.L. Messer J.L. Wilson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4946-4949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).PA10, a 10-kDa polyanion VDAC inhibitor (5König T. Stipani I. Horvàth I. Palmieri F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1982; 14: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), decreases ADP-stimulated oxidation of glutamate, malate, and succinate. The inhibition of glutamate oxidation is relieved by high ADP or an uncoupler. In our studies, we showed that PA10 inhibited palmitoyl-CoA (+carnitine and malate) oxidation but that this inhibition was not relieved by high ADP. PA10 binds to VDAC as shown in electrophysiological experiments (6Colombini M. Yeung C.L. Tung J. König T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 905: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In 1999, the reason for the specificity of the two polyanions was not apparent. However, we are now aware of three VDAC isoforms and that knock-outs of these produce different phenotypes (7Cesar Mde C. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 422: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mitochondria from VDAC1 knock-out mice, in particular, have a defect in ADP-stimulated oxidation (8Anflous K. Armstrong D.D. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1954-1960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which is relieved by an uncoupler, whereas mitochondria from VDAC3 knock-out mice do not have any oxidative defects (9Anflous-Pharayra K. Lee N. Armstrong D.L. Craigen W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1807: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). VDAC also exists at the same time in different substates (10Craigen W.J. Graham B.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2008; 40: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These data indicate that VDAC1 transports ADP, although this is not the case for VDAC3 and is consistent with differing substrate specificity for VDACs.The carnitine-dependent transport of activated fatty acids is catalyzed by CPT1a (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a), an integral outer membrane protein that converts activated fatty acids into acylcarnitines (11McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Using size exclusion chromatography and blue native electrophoresis (BNE) of extracts of mitochondria isolated from livers of fed rats or Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing CPT1a, Faye et al. (12Faye A. Esnous C. Price N.T. Onfray M.A. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26908-26916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) reported that CPT1a exists as a trimer, which, under native conditions, dimerizes to form hexamers. The authors proposed that trimeric CPT1a is arranged to form channels allowing acylcarnitines to enter the intermembrane space. Additionally, Jenei et al. (13Jenei Z.A. Borthwick K. Zammit V.A. Dixon A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6988-6997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) suggested that the interaction between the GXXXG and GXXXA motifs within transmembrane domain 2 of CPT1a leads to the hexamerization and stabilization of recombinant CPT1a. However, the conclusion that CPT1a exists as a homo-oligomer is based solely on the finding that the observed higher molecular mass species of CPT1a could be accounted for by multiples of the monomeric mass of CPT1a. The important question is whether the hexameric CPT1a channel acylcarnitines or CPT1a forms hetero-oligomeric complexes with other metabolically relevant enzymes and channel proteins such as ACSL and VDAC that are responsible for channeling activated fatty acids through the MOM into the mitochondrial intermembrane space.To examine the state of CPT1a in the MOM, we used an approach that combined sizing by"

https://openalex.org/W2024971608,"We have identified a protein, Kif24, that shares homology with the kinesin-13 subfamily of motor proteins and specifically interacts with CP110 and Cep97, centrosomal proteins that play a role in regulating centriolar length and ciliogenesis. Kif24 preferentially localizes to mother centrioles. Loss of Kif24 from cycling cells resulted in aberrant cilia assembly but did not promote growth of abnormally long centrioles, unlike CP110 and Cep97 depletion. We found that loss of Kif24 leads to the disappearance of CP110 from mother centrioles, specifically in cycling cells able to form cilia. Kif24 is able to bind and depolymerize microtubules in vitro. Remarkably, ectopically expressed Kif24 specifically remodels centriolar microtubules without significantly altering cytoplasmic microtubules. Thus, our studies have identified a centriolar kinesin that specifically remodels a subset of microtubules, thereby regulating cilia assembly. These studies also suggest mechanistic differences between the regulation of microtubule elongation associated with centrioles and cilia."

https://openalex.org/W1971281089,"A large range of debilitating medical conditions is linked to protein misfolding, which may compete with productive folding particularly in proteins containing multiple domains. Seventy-five per cent of the eukaryotic proteome consists of multidomain proteins, yet it is not understood how interdomain misfolding is avoided. It has been proposed that maintaining low sequence identity between covalently linked domains is a mechanism to avoid misfolding. Here we use single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer to detect and quantify rare misfolding events in tandem immunoglobulin domains from the I band of titin under native conditions. About 5.5 per cent of molecules with identical domains misfold during refolding in vitro and form an unexpectedly stable state with an unfolding half-time of several days. Tandem arrays of immunoglobulin-like domains in humans show significantly lower sequence identity between neighbouring domains than between non-adjacent domains. In particular, the sequence identity of neighbouring domains has been found to be preferentially below 40 per cent. We observe no misfolding for a tandem of naturally neighbouring domains with low sequence identity (24 per cent), whereas misfolding occurs between domains that are 42 per cent identical. Coarse-grained molecular simulations predict the formation of domain-swapped structures that are in excellent agreement with the observed transfer efficiency of the misfolded species. We infer that the interactions underlying misfolding are very specific and result in a sequence-specific domain-swapping mechanism. Diversifying the sequence between neighbouring domains seems to be a successful evolutionary strategy to avoid misfolding in multidomain proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2015252454,"Immediate early genes are rapidly transcribed in response to neuronal activity, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. The authors show that this rapid transcription is mediated by a stalled RNA polymerase II, poised just downstream of the transcription start site. RNAi-depletion of negative elongation factor compromises the rapid transcription. Transcription of immediate early genes (IEGs) in neurons is highly sensitive to neuronal activity, but the mechanism underlying these early transcription events is largely unknown. We found that several IEGs, such as Arc (also known as Arg3.1), are poised for near-instantaneous transcription by the stalling of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) just downstream of the transcription start site in rat neurons. Depletion through RNA interference of negative elongation factor, a mediator of Pol II stalling, reduced the Pol II occupancy of the Arc promoter and compromised the rapid induction of Arc and other IEGs. In contrast, reduction of Pol II stalling did not prevent transcription of IEGs that were expressed later and largely lacked promoter-proximal Pol II stalling. Together, our data strongly indicate that the rapid induction of neuronal IEGs requires poised Pol II and suggest a role for this mechanism in a wide variety of transcription-dependent processes, including learning and memory."
https://openalex.org/W1989958893,"The ciliopathy Joubert syndrome is marked by cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, a phenotype for which the pathogenic mechanism is unclear. To investigate Joubert syndrome pathogenesis, we have examined mice with mutated Ahi1, the first identified Joubert syndrome-associated gene. These mice show cerebellar hypoplasia with a vermis-midline fusion defect early in development. This defect is concomitant with expansion of the roof plate and is also evident in a mouse mutant for another Joubert syndrome-associated gene, Cep290. Furthermore, fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of human subjects with Joubert syndrome reveals a similar midline cleft, suggesting parallel pathogenic mechanisms. Previous evidence has suggested a role for Jouberin (Jbn), the protein encoded by Ahi1, in canonical Wnt signaling. Consistent with this, we found decreased Wnt reporter activity at the site of hemisphere fusion in the developing cerebellum of Ahi1-mutant mice. This decrease was accompanied by reduced proliferation at the site of fusion. Finally, treatment with lithium, a Wnt pathway agonist, partially rescued this phenotype. Our findings implicate a defect in Wnt signaling in the cerebellar midline phenotype seen in Joubert syndrome that can be overcome with Wnt stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2059584584,"This paper demonstrates that orientation maps, as found in the cortex of higher mammals, are likely to arise from the spatial layout of retinal ganglion cell receptive fields in the retina. The predictions of this model are borne out in four different species. The orientation map is a hallmark of primary visual cortex in higher mammals. It is not yet known how orientation maps develop, what function they have in visual processing and why some species lack them. Here we advance the notion that quasi-periodic orientation maps are established by moiré interference of regularly spaced ON- and OFF-center retinal ganglion cell mosaics. A key prediction of the theory is that the centers of iso-orientation domains must be arranged in a hexagonal lattice on the cortical surface. Here we show that such a pattern is observed in individuals of four different species: monkeys, cats, tree shrews and ferrets. The proposed mechanism explains how orientation maps can develop without requiring precise patterns of spontaneous activity or molecular guidance. Further, it offers a possible account for the emergence of orientation tuning in single neurons despite the absence of orderly orientation maps in rodents species."

Among the three classes of ionotropic glutamate receptors, kainate receptors (KARs) have a unique brain distribution, which has been historically defined by (3)H-radiolabeled kainate binding. Compared with recombinant KARs expressed in heterologous cells, synaptic KARs exhibit characteristically slow rise-time and decay kinetics. However, the mechanisms responsible for these distinct KAR properties remain unclear. We found that both the high-affinity binding pattern in the mouse brain and the channel properties of native KARs are determined by the KAR auxiliary subunit Neto1. Through modulation of agonist binding affinity and off-kinetics of KARs, but not trafficking of KARs, Neto1 determined both the KAR high-affinity binding pattern and the distinctively slow kinetics of postsynaptic KARs. By regulating KAR excitatory postsynaptic current kinetics, Neto1 can control synaptic temporal summation, spike generation and fidelity."
https://openalex.org/W2036461308,"Activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway represents a major mechanism for breast cancer regression resulting from anti-estrogen therapy. The BH3-only protein BIK is inducible by estrogen-starvation and anti-estrogen treatment and plays an important role in anti-estrogen induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells. BIK is predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum where it regulates BAX/BAK-dependent release of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum stores and cooperates with other BH3-only proteins such as NOXA to cause rapid release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and activate apoptosis. BIK is also known to inactivate BCL-2 through complex formation. Previously, we demonstrated that apoptosis triggered by BIK in estrogen-starved human breast cancer cells is suppressed by GRP78, a major endoplasmic reticulum chaperone. Here we described the isolation of a novel clonal human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7/BUS-10) resistant to long-term estrogen deprivation. These cells exhibit elevated level of GRP78, which protects them from estrogen starvation-induced apoptosis. Our studies revealed that overexpression of GRP78 suppresses apoptosis induced by BIK and NOXA, either alone or in combination. Surprisingly, the interaction of GRP78 with BIK does not require its BH3 domain, which has been implicated in all previous BIK protein interactions. We further showed GRP78 and BCL-2 form independent complex with BIK and that increased expression of GRP78 decreases BIK binding to BCL-2. Our findings provide the first evidence that GRP78 can decrease BCL-2 sequestration by BIK at the endoplasmic reticulum, thus uncovering a potential new mechanism whereby GRP78 confers endocrine resistance in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2093670875,"The IκB kinase (IKK) complex acts as a gatekeeper of canonical NF-κB signaling in response to upstream stimulation. IKK activation requires sensing of ubiquitin chains by the essential IKK regulatory subunit IKKγ/NEMO. However, it has remained enigmatic whether NEMO binding to Lys-63-linked or linear ubiquitin chains is critical for triggering IKK activation. We show here that the NEMO C terminus, comprising the ubiquitin binding region and a zinc finger, has a high preference for binding to linear ubiquitin chains. However, immobilization of NEMO, which may be reminiscent of cellular oligomerization, facilitates the interaction with Lys-63 ubiquitin chains. Moreover, selective mutations in NEMO that abolish association with linear ubiquitin but do not affect binding to Lys-63 ubiquitin are only partially compromising NF-κB signaling in response to TNFα stimulation in fibroblasts and T cells. In line with this, TNFα-triggered expression of NF-κB target genes and induction of apoptosis was partially compromised by NEMO mutations that selectively impair the binding to linear ubiquitin chains. Thus, in vivo NEMO interaction with linear and Lys-63 ubiquitin chains is required for optimal IKK activation, suggesting that both type of chains are cooperating in triggering canonical NF-κB signaling."

PLD1 generates the lipid second messenger phosphatidic acid (PA), which is required for the activity of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 (15Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 16Chen Y. Zheng Y. Foster D.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3937-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 17Toschi A. Lee E. Xu L. Garcia A. Gadir N. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 1411-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Although RalA does not activate PLD1 directly, it stimulates the association of PLD1 with ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family GTPases, which do increase the activity of PLD1 (18Luo J.Q. Liu X. Frankel P. Rotunda T. Ramos M. Flom J. Jiang H. Feig L.A. Morris A.J. Kahn R.A. Foster D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 3632-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Significantly, ARF6 has been implicated in the response of mTORC1 to glucose (19Ma W.N. Park S.Y. Han J.S. Exp. Mol. Med. 2010; 42: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). An important recent study also linked Rheb and PLD1. Chen and colleagues (20Sun Y. Fang Y. Yoon M.S. Zhang C. Roccio M. Zwartkruis F.J. Armstrong M. Brown H.A. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8286-8291Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) reported that Rheb, like ARF and Rho family GTPases, interacts with and activates PLD1. This study suggested the possibility that the activation of Rheb in response to growth factors can induce PLD activity and the generation of the PA critical for mTORC1 activation. Tamanoi and colleagues (21Sato T. Nakashima A. Guo L. Coffman K. Tamanoi F. Oncogene. 2010; 29: 2746-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) recently identified two mTOR mutants from human cancers with point mutations that made mTOR constitutively active in the absence of nutrients. Significantly, one of these nutrient-insensitive mTOR mutants was resistant to inhibition by 1-BtOH while retaining sensitivity to rapamycin. 1-Butanol (1-BtOH) suppresses the production of PA by PLD and is used to implicate PLD activity (17Toschi A. Lee E. Xu L. Garcia A. Gadir N. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 1411-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This finding indicated that a nutrient-insensitive mTOR mutant has lost its PA requirement. The insensitivity of this mutant to both nutrients and PA is consistent with the hypothesis that nutritional input into mTORC1 is mediated by PLD. Another link between amino acids and mTOR is the class III PI3K, hVps34 (22Byfield M.P. Murray J.T. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33076-33082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 23Nobukuni T. Joaquin M. Roccio M. Dann S.G. Kim S.Y. Gulati P. Byfield M.P. Backer J.M. Natt F.

Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 456-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). hVps34 generates PI 3-phosphate (PI-3-P) instead of the PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate generated by type I PI3Ks (26Backer J.M. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). It is not known how hVps34 contributes to the activation of mTORC1, but PI-3-P serves to recruit proteins with PX domains (26Backer J.M. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is of interest that both PLD1 and PLD2 have PX domains (27Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 28Morris A.J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2007; 74: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that could be influenced by hVps34 activity. Thus, a common denominator for several factors previously implicated in the regulation of nutrient-dependent mTORC1 activity is PLD. In addition to being a central regulator of the cell response to nutrients and energy, mTOR has emerged as a central player in cancer (29Guertin D.A. Sabatini D.M. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 9-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar). mTOR signaling is dysregulated in what may be virtually all human cancers and has been widely implicated in cancer cell survival signals (29Guertin D.A. Sabatini D.M. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 9-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar, 30Foster D.A. Expert. Rev. Anticancer Ther. 2004; 4: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). There are many mutations in the signals that mediate growth factor signaling to mTOR, such as PI3K, Akt, and the TSC (31Hay N. Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 179-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). However, these growth factor-signaling intermediates that lead to elevated mTORC1 activity are not affected by nutrients (4Wang X. Proud C.G. Trends. Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 260-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). PLD, like mTORC1, has also been implicated in cancer cell survival signals (32Foster D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We report here that elevated PLD activity in human cancer cells is dependent on the presence of nutrients that stimulate mTORC1. The study suggests that PLD-generated PA represents a critical signal for nutrient sensing by mTORC1. The MDA-MB-231, T24, and Calu-1 cells used in this study were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum. Reagents were obtained from the following sources. Antibodies against ARF1, ARF6, Rheb, and hVps15 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); antibodies against S6 kinase, phosphorylated S6 kinase (Thr389), hVps34, RalA, and actin were obtained from Cell Signaling. siRNAs targeting RalA (M-009235-00-0005), Rheb (M-009692-02-0005), ARF1 (M-011580-01-0005), ARF6 (M-004008-01-0005), hVps34 (M-005250-00-0005), and hVps15 (M-005025-02-0005) were obtained from Dharmacon. Insulin, 1-BtOH, and t-BtOH were from Sigma; wortmannin was from Calbiochem. DMEM (D5796) and DMEM lacking Arg, Leu, and Lys (D9443) were obtained from Sigma. 50× minimum essential medium amino acid solution without l-Gln (Sigma M5550) was used for stimulation by amino acids. For stimulation, the amino acid solution was added to a 2× concentration. Glucose-free DMEM was from Invitrogen (11966-025). PLD inhibitors for PLD1 (Compound 14, VU0379595) ((1R,2R)-N-([S]-1-{4-[5-bromo-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo(d)imidazol-1-yl]piperidin-1-yl}propan-2-yl)-2-phenylcyclopropanecarboxamide) and PLD2 (Compound 22a, VU0364739) (N-(2-(1-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-oxo-1,3,8-triazaspiro[4.5]decan-8-yl)ethyl)-2-naphthamide) were provided by Dr. H. Alex Brown (Vanderbilt University) and have been described elsewhere (33Lewis J.A. Scott S.A. Lavieri R. Buck J.R. Selvy P.E. Stoops S.L. Armstrong M.D. Brown H.A. Lindsley C.W. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Chem. 2010; 53: 6706-6719Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on 6-well plates at 30% confluence in medium containing 10% serum. After 1 day, cells were transfected with siRNA at 80 nm concentration using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, the medium was changed to fresh medium containing 10% serum, and 2 days later, cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blot. Extraction of proteins from cultured cells and Western blot analysis of extracted proteins was performed using the ECL system (Thermo Scientific) as described previously (17Toschi A. Lee E. Xu L. Garcia A. Gadir N. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 1411-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Relative levels of p70S6K phosphorylation were determined by measuring the intensity of the appropriate band in the autoradiograph with ImageJ software. PLD activity was determined by the transphosphatidylation reaction in the presence of 0.8% 1-BtOH as described previously (17Toschi A. Lee E. Xu L. Garcia A. Gadir N. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 1411-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Cells in 60-mm culture dishes were labeled with [3H]myristic acid (3.0 μCi) for 4–6 h, and 1-BtOH (0.8%) was added 20 min before lipids were collected. Lipids were extracted and characterized by thin layer chromatography as described previously (17Toschi A. Lee E. Xu L. Garcia A. Gadir N. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 1411-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Relative levels of PLD activity were then determined by measuring the intensity of the corresponding phosphatidyl-BtOH band in the autoradiograph with ImageJ software or by scraping the thin layer chromatography plates and scintillation counting of the phosphatidyl-BtOH band. We reported previously that the PLD activity is elevated in several human cancer cell lines, especially those harboring Ras mutations (35Zheng Y. Rodrik V. Toschi A. Shi M. Hui L. Shen Y. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15862-15868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 36Shi M. Zheng Y. Garcia A. Xu L. Foster D.A.

Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 4267-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The PA generated by PLD is required for the activation of mTORC1 (32Foster D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). mTORC1 is a sensor of nutritional sufficiency and is active in the presence of amino acids and glucose (1Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3151-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 2Avruch J. Hara K. Lin Y. Liu M. Long X. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K.

We therefore examined whether the elevated PLD activity observed in human cancer cell lines was dependent on the presence of essential amino acids and glucose. MDA-MB-231 breast, T24 bladder, and Calu-1 lung cancer cells all display elevated PLD activity, especially when deprived of serum (35Zheng Y. Rodrik V. Toschi A. Shi M. Hui L. Shen Y. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15862-15868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 36Shi M. Zheng Y. Garcia A. Xu L. Foster D.A. Cancer Lett. 2007; 258: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All three of these cell lines harbor Ras mutations, which contribute to the elevated PLD activity (36Shi M. Zheng Y. Garcia A. Xu L. Foster D.A. Cancer Lett. 2007; 258: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 37Garcia A. Zheng Y. Zhao C. Toschi A. Fan J. Shraibman N. Brown H.A. Bar-Sagi D. Foster D.A. Arbiser J.L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 4267-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The PLD activity in the MDA-MB-231, T24, and Calu-1 cells was evaluated in the presence and absence of essential amino acids (Fig. 1A) and glucose (Fig. 1B). As shown, the level of PLD activity in all three cell lines was substantially reduced when the medium lacked either amino acids or glucose. The nutrient-dependent PLD activity in all three cell lines was partially sensitive to selective inhibitors of both PLD1 (compound 14) and PLD2 (compound 22a), indicating that both PLD1 and PLD2 are likely to be involved. These data indicate that the elevated PLD activity in these cancer cell lines is dependent on both essential amino acids and glucose and that PLD may be critical for the response to nutritional sufficiency. The ability of amino acids to activate mTORC1 has been widely reported (3Avruch J. Long X. Ortiz-Vega S. Rapley J. Papageorgiou A. Dai N. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 296: E592-E602Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Chen and colleagues (20Sun Y. Fang Y. Yoon M.S. Zhang C. Roccio M. Zwartkruis F.J. Armstrong M. Brown H.A. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8286-8291Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) recently reported that serum-induced phosphorylation of the mTORC1 site on p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) (Thr389) was dependent on the presence of amino acids. Chen's group (20Sun Y. Fang Y. Yoon M.S. Zhang C. Roccio M. Zwartkruis F.J. Armstrong M. Brown H.A. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8286-8291Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that serum-induced PLD activity was dependent on amino acids. These data are consistent with an amino acid and PLD dependence for serum-induced mTORC1 activation. We therefore examined whether amino acid-stimulated p70S6K phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231, T24, and Calu-1 cells was dependent on PLD activity. Cells were shifted to medium lacking serum overnight, at which time the cells were then placed in medium lacking both serum and essential amino acids. Four hours later, amino acids were added in the presence of either 1-BtOH or t-BtOH, and p70S6K phosphorylation at Thr389 was examined 30 min later. Whereas 1-BtOH suppresses the production of PA by PLD via the transphosphatidylation reaction, t-BtOH cannot participate in this reaction and is used as a negative control (17Toschi A. Lee E. Xu L. Garcia A. Gadir N. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 1411-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). 1-BtOH, but not t-BtOH, suppressed the amino acid-induced increase in p70S6K phosphorylation in all three cell lines (Fig. 2A). These data indicate that the induction of mTORC1 by amino acids is dependent on PLD activity. We also examined the PLD dependence for the activation of mTORC1 by glucose. MDA-MB-231, T24, and Calu-1 cells were placed in medium lacking serum overnight and then shifted to medium lacking both serum and glucose. Four hours later, glucose was added along with either 1-BtOH or t-BtOH, and the phosphorylation of p70S6K was evaluated 30 min later. As shown in Fig. 2B, the induction of p70S6K phosphorylation was suppressed by 1-BtOH but not by t-BtOH. We also examined the effect of the PLD inhibitors on the amino acid- and glucose-induced increases in p70S6K phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 2C, the combination of Compounds 14 and 22a suppressed the induction of p70S6K phosphorylation by both amino acids and glucose in the T24 cells. Neither of the inhibitors alone had a significantly stronger impact of p70S6K phosphorylation (data not shown), making it likely that both PLD1 and PLD2 are involved. These data further implicate PLD activity for the induction of mTORC1 with either glucose or amino acids. Chen and colleagues (20Sun Y. Fang Y. Yoon M.S. Zhang C. Roccio M. Zwartkruis F.J. Armstrong M. Brown H.A. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8286-8291Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 38Sun Y. Chen J. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 3118-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) recently reported that serum-induced PLD activity was at least partially dependent on Rheb and that Rheb could be co-immunoprecipitated with PLD1. We therefore examined whether the amino acid-dependent PLD activity in human cancer cells was dependent on Rheb. As shown in Fig. 3A, suppression of Rheb expression with siRNA suppressed the amino acid-dependent PLD activity in MDA-MB-231, T24, and Calu-1 cells. Consistent with previous reports (2Avruch J. Hara K. Lin Y. Liu M. Long X. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6361-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), knockdown of Rheb also suppressed the amino acid-induced phosphorylation of p70S6K phosphorylation at the mTORC1 Thr389 site (Fig. 3B). We also examined the impact of suppressing Rheb expression on the stimulation of mTORC1 with glucose in the T24 cells. As shown in Fig. 3C, the glucose-induced increase in p70S6K phosphorylation was also dependent on Rheb. These data demonstrate that nutrient-dependent PLD activity is dependent on Rheb and that the nutrient induction of mTORC1 is also dependent on Rheb. The amino acid induction of mTORC1 is dependent on Rheb and therefore also dependent on the suppression of TSC1/2, which suppresses Rheb by stimulating the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP (4Wang X. Proud C.G. Trends. Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 260-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the impact of amino acids on the phosphorylation state of TSC2, which is both activated and suppressed by phosphorylation at different sites (39Kwiatkowski D.J. Manning B.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: R251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Akt phosphorylates TSC2 at Thr1462, which leads to the suppression of the GTPase activity of Rheb (39Kwiatkowski D.J. Manning B.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: R251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, amino acids had no effect on the phosphorylation state of TSC2 at Thr1462 in either the MDA-MB-231 or T24 cells. Suppression of PA generation by PLD with 1-BtOH also had no effect on the phosphorylation of TSC2 at this site (Fig. 4A). In contrast, insulin was able to increase phosphorylation at this site (Fig. 4B). TSC2 is phosphorylated by Akt, which is activated by PI3K (39Kwiatkowski D.J. Manning B.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: R251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Importantly, suppression of PI3K with wortmannin was able to suppress TSC2 phosphorylation at Thr1462, and this led to reduced phosphorylation of p70S6K at Thr389. Collectively, the data in FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4 indicate that although signaling through TSC and Rheb is required for the amino acid induction of PLD and mTORC1, this signaling pathway is not impacted by amino acids. These findings are consistent with previous reports indicating that nutrient signaling to mTOR does not up-regulate the TSC-Rheb pathway (4Wang X. Proud C.G. Trends. Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 260-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The lack of an impact of amino acids on TSC1/2 suggest that the amino acid-stimulated increase may be acting through the regulation of PLD and does not involve changes in the activity of Rheb. The amino acid-stimulated increase in mTORC1 activity was reported to be dependent on RalA (12Maehama T. Tanaka M. Nishina H. Murakami M. Kanaho Y. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35053-35059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The RalA dependence for the amino acid-dependent activation of mTORC1 is particularly intriguing in that RalA is constitutively associated with PLD1 (13Jiang H. Luo J.Q. Urano T. Frankel P. Lu Z. Foster D.A. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 14Luo J.Q. Liu X. Hammond S.M. Colley W.C. Feig L.A. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Foster D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and is required for the recruitment of activating ARF family GTPases to PLD1 (18Luo J.Q. Liu X. Frankel P. Rotunda T. Ramos M. Flom J. Jiang H. Feig L.A. Morris A.J. Kahn R.A. Foster D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 3632-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). RalA was knocked down with siRNA, and the impact on amino acid-dependent PLD activity was evaluated in the MDA-MB-231 and T24 cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, the amino acid-dependent PLD activity in both cell lines was dependent on RalA. We next examined the effect of RalA knockdown on the induction of p70S6K phosphorylation by amino acids. As shown in Fig. 5B, RalA knockdown suppressed the amino acid induction of p70S6K phosphorylation at the mTORC1 site at Thr389 in both the MDA-MB-231 and T24 cells. The induction of p70S6K phosphorylation by glucose was similarly suppressed by RalA knockdown in the T24 cells (Fig. 5C). In contrast, the serum induction of p70S6K phosphorylation was not impacted by RalA knockdown in these cells (Fig. 5C). These data are consistent with RalA being a key target of nutrients for the activation of mTORC1 and further implicate PLD1, which interacts directly with RalA as a conduit to mTORC1 activation. We previously reported that RalA promotes the activation of PLD1 by recruitment of ARF family GTPases into a RalA-PLD1 complex (14Luo J.Q. Liu X. Hammond S.M. Colley W.C. Feig L.A. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Foster D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Luo J.Q. Liu X. Frankel P. Rotunda T. Ramos M. Flom J. Jiang H. Feig L.A. Morris A.J. Kahn R.A. Foster D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 3632-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that H-Ras-induced PLD activity was dependent on ARF6 (40Xu L. Frankel P. Jackson D. Rotunda T. Boshans R.L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). ARF6 has also been implicated in the glucose stimulation of insulin secretion (19Ma W.N. Park S.Y. Han J.S. Exp. Mol. Med. 2010; 42: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), indicating that ARF6 is activated in response to nutrients. Thus, the involvement of RalA, in the amino acid- and glucose-dependent PLD activity shown in Fig. 5 suggests the possible involvement of ARF GTPases, which are direct activators of PLD1 (41Exton J.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 1-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As reported previously for the MDA-MB-231 cells (37Garcia A. Zheng Y. Zhao C. Toschi A. Fan J. Shraibman N. Brown H.A. Bar-Sagi D. Foster D.A. Arbiser J.L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 4267-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), knockdown of either ARF1 or ARF6 with siRNA suppressed the nutrient-dependent PLD activity in the T24 cells (Fig. 6A). As shown in Fig. 6B, ARF6 knockdown suppressed the induction of p70S6K phos"
https://openalex.org/W2019186980,"The ICP34.5 protein of herpes simplex virus type 1 is a neurovirulence factor that plays critical roles in viral replication and anti-host responses. One of its functions is to recruit protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that leads to the dephosphorylation of the α subunit of translation initiation factor eIF2 (eIF2α), which is inactivated by infection-induced phosphorylation. As PP1 is a protein phosphatase with a wide range of substrates, the question remains to be answered how ICP34.5 directs PP1 to specifically dephosphorylate eIF2α. Here we report that ICP34.5 not only binds PP1 but also associates with eIF2α by in vitro and in vivo assays. The binding site of eIF2α is identified at amino acids 233–248 of ICP34.5, which falls in the highly homologous region with human gene growth arrest and DNA damage 34. The interaction between ICP34.5 and eIF2α is independent of the phosphorylation status of eIF2α at serine 51. Deletion mutation of this region results in the failure of dephosphorylation of eIF2α by PP1 and, consequently, interrupts viral protein synthesis and replication. Our data illustrated that the binding between viral protein ICP34.5 and the host eIF2α is crucial for the specific dephosphorylation of eIF2α by PP1. We propose that herpes simplex virus protein ICP34.5 bridges PP1 and eIF2α via their binding motifs and thereby facilitates the protein synthesis and viral replication. The ICP34.5 protein of herpes simplex virus type 1 is a neurovirulence factor that plays critical roles in viral replication and anti-host responses. One of its functions is to recruit protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that leads to the dephosphorylation of the α subunit of translation initiation factor eIF2 (eIF2α), which is inactivated by infection-induced phosphorylation. As PP1 is a protein phosphatase with a wide range of substrates, the question remains to be answered how ICP34.5 directs PP1 to specifically dephosphorylate eIF2α. Here we report that ICP34.5 not only binds PP1 but also associates with eIF2α by in vitro and in vivo assays. The binding site of eIF2α is identified at amino acids 233–248 of ICP34.5, which falls in the highly homologous region with human gene growth arrest and DNA damage 34. The interaction between ICP34.5 and eIF2α is independent of the phosphorylation status of eIF2α at serine 51. Deletion mutation of this region results in the failure of dephosphorylation of eIF2α by PP1 and, consequently, interrupts viral protein synthesis and replication. Our data illustrated that the binding between viral protein ICP34.5 and the host eIF2α is crucial for the specific dephosphorylation of eIF2α by PP1. We propose that herpes simplex virus protein ICP34.5 bridges PP1 and eIF2α via their binding motifs and thereby facilitates the protein synthesis and viral replication. Viral infection can activate a series of host immune responses. One of the essential responses is the interruption of the viral protein synthesis, which is executed by double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) (1Clemens M.J. Elia A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar).

In addition to affecting PKR activation as mentioned above, HSV-1 adopted mechanisms not only inhibiting PKR by Us11 (8Khoo D. Perez C. Mohr I. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11971-11981Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) but also reversing the biochemical reaction catalyzed by PKR with its neurovirulent factor ICP34.5 (9He B. Gross M. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). ICP34.5 is encoded by the γ134.5 gene of HSV-1 and HSV-2. The HSV-1(F) ICP34.5 consists of 263 amino acids and can be divided into three domains: an amino-terminal domain, a linker region of ATP (Ala-Thr-Pro) repeats, and a carboxyl-terminal domain (9He B. Gross M. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 10Chou J. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of the amino-terminal domain is implicated in the control of TBK1-mediated signaling (11Verpooten D. Ma Y. Hou S. Yan Z. He B. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1097-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and also related to autophagy (12Orvedahl A. Alexander D. Tallóczy Z. Sun Q. Wei Y. Zhang W. Burns D.

The linker region, with a varying number of the Ala-Thr-Pro repeats, may affect the protein localization (13Mao H. Rosenthal K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11423-11431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain is a stretch of 84 amino acids containing a consensus binding motif (R/KVXF) for protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) followed by an Ala-Arg-rich motif and is highly homologous to the carboxyl-terminal region of mammalian growth arrest and DNA damage protein 34 (GADD34) (10Chou J.

Substitution of the C-terminal sequences from mouse GADD34 homologue MyD116 rescues ICP34.5 function in cells infected with mutant HSV-1 (18He B. Chou J. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 84-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating that the C-terminal regions of ICP34.5 and GADD34 are functionally interchangeable regarding the dephosphorylation of eIF2α. Previous studies illustrated that the carboxyl terminus of ICP34.5 is essential in the dephosphorylation of eIF2α (9He B. Gross M. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Mutation at PP1 binding motif of ICP34.5 completely abolished the dephosphorylation of eIF2α in vitro and rendered the reduced replication of virus (19He B. Gross M. Roizman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20737-20743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), whereas the truncation of 10 amino acid residues from the C-terminal of ICP34.5 or substitution of the conserved Arg residues to acidic residues also elicited the dephosphorylation and protein synthesis (20Zhang C. Tang J. Xie J. Zhang H. Li Y. Zhang J. Verpooten D. He B. Cao Y. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, the PP1 binding motif of ICP34.5 is prerequisite but not sufficient for the dephosphorylation of eIF2α. It remains to be investigated how the ICP34.5-mediated dephosphorylation is achieved. In this study, we demonstrated the association of ICP34.5 with cellular eIF2α in vitro and in vivo. With the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) approach, we showed that the complex formation of PP1 and eIF2α occurs only in the presence of ICP34.5. This interaction between ICP34.5 and eIF2α is independent of the phosphorylation status of eIF2α. Furthermore, we identified that the carboxyl terminus (233 to 248 aa) of ICP34.5 is responsible for the binding with eIF2α and that ICP34.5 with a deletion in the 233–248 aa region failed to rescue the eIF2α dephosphorylation and viral replication. Taken together, this study suggests that ICP34.5 bridges PP1 and eIF2α via their respective binding motifs, thereby facilitating the specific dephosphorylation of eIF2α and the protein synthesis. This study may lead to a common mechanism in controlling protein synthesis by dephosphorylation of eIF2α, which is inactivated by other PKR-like kinases. Vero, HeLa, and HEK293T cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were propagated in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for HeLa and HEK293T cells or 10% newborn calf serum for Vero cells. HSV-1(F) is a prototype HSV-1 strain, and R3616 is a mutation virus with a 1-kb fragment including the coding region of the γ134.5 gene deleted (21Chou J. Kern E.R. Whitley R.J. Roizman B. Science. 1990; 250: 1262-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Plasmids pcDNA3-YN, pcDNA3-YC, pcDNA3-YN-PP1, pcDNA3-YC-ICP34.5 (WT), pcDNA3-YC-ICP34.5 (V193E,F195L), pHIV-ICP34.5 (WT), and pHIV-ICP34.5 (V193E, F195L) have been described previously (20Zhang C. Tang J. Xie J. Zhang H. Li Y. Zhang J. Verpooten D. He B. Cao Y. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For the BiFC assay, the expression vectors of ICP34.5 variants WT-N, WT-C, ΔC15, ΔC30, and ΔC45 were obtained by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3, with the nucleotide encoding the carboxyl-terminal fragment containing residues 155–238 (YC) of YFP fused to these mutants, respectively. To construct pcDNA3-YN-eIF2α and pcDNA3-YC-eIF2α, the nucleotide encoding residues 1–154 (YN) of YFP or 155–238 (YC) of YFP was fused to the eIF2α coding region. To obtain pcDNA3-YN-pDlim2, the amino-terminal fragment containing residues 1–154 (YN) of YFP was fused to the pDlim2 coding region. The ICP34.5 (Δ233–248) or eIF2α mutants were obtained by overlap PCR and were cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3 with a YC or YN fragment. For the coimmunoprecipitation assay, YN-pDlim2, YN-eIF2α, and YN-PP1 in pcDNA3 were isolated by BamHI and XhoI digestion and then cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pCMVtag2B vector. GFP-PP1 and GFP-ICP34.5 (WT) were obtained by PCR and cloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites of the pEGFP-C1 vector. To construct pHIV-ICP34.5 (Δ233–248), ICP34.5 (Δ233–248) was cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pHIV-vFlip. Nucleotide sequences of the constructions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. BiFC analysis enables direct visualization of protein interactions in living cells (22Hu C.D. Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 23Kerppola T.K. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1278-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The YN-eIF2α and YC-ICP34.5 variants were cotransfected into HeLa cells using polyethyleneimine. At 36-hour post-transfection, cells were cultured at room temperature for 1–3 h for fluorophore maturation. The fluorescence was then examined by fluorescence microscopy, and the cells were subjected to FACS analysis. To detect the protein expression, cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF). After centrifugation, supernatants were subjected to electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membranes, blocked with 5% nonfat milk and then probed with antibodies against ICP34.5, eIF2α (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), phosphorylated eIF2α Ser-51 (Sigma), HSV-1 (Dako, Inc.), or α-tubulin (Sigma). To examine the protein interactions, HEK293T or HeLa cells were transfected with the FLAG-tagged eIF2α and ICP34.5 variants. At 24–36 h post-transfection, as indicated, HEK293T cells were harvested and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixtures. Lysates were incubated, respectively, with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) or anti-ICP34.5 antibody plus protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times with WASH buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixtures), and protein A/G-agarose beads were subjected to electrophoresis and immunoblotting analysis. Furthermore, to examine the interaction between ICP34.5 and endogenous eIF2α, HEK293T cells were transfected with GFP-tagged PP1 or ICP34.5. At 36 h post-transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixtures. Then lysates were incubated, respectively, with anti-GFP antibody (Abmart) or anti-eIF2α antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) plus protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 3 h at 4 °C. Then the beads were washed four times with WASH buffer, and protein A/G-agarose beads were subjected to electrophoresis and immunoblotting analysis. To detect the interaction between ICP34.5 encoded by virus and endogenous eIF2α, HeLa cells were infected with R3616 or HSV-1(F). At 18 h post-infection, cells were harvested and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Then lysates were incubated with anti-ICP34.5 antibody plus protein A/G-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times with WASH buffer, and the beads were subjected to electrophoresis and immunoblotting analysis. HeLa cells were transfected with pHIV-GFP, pHIV-ICP34.5 (WT), pHIV-ICP34.5 (V193E, F195L), and pHIV-ICP34.5 (Δ233–248). To detect the viral protein synthesis and eIF2α dephosphorylation, at 24 h post-transfection, cells were infected with R3616 at 10 pfu per cell. At 24 h post-infection, cells were harvested to determine the viral protein synthesis and eIF2α dephosphorylation by Western blot analysis. To detect the viral replication, at 24-hour post transfection, cells were infected with R3616 at 0.05 pfu/cell Also at 24 h post-infection, virus yields were determined on Vero cells. The substrate specificity of the PP1 catalytic subunit is normally determined by the regulatory subunit (24Depaoli-Roach A.A. Park I.K. Cerovsky V. Csortos C. Durbin S.D. Kuntz M.J. Sitikov A. Tang P.M. Verin A. Zolnierowicz S. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1994; 34: 199-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). ICP34.5 has been identified as a regulatory subunit of PP1 that contains a consensus PP1 binding motif (19He B. Gross M. Roizman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20737-20743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Mutation of this motif in ICP34.5 is functionally deleterious (25Cheng G. Gross M. Brett M.E. He B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3666-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, C-terminal mutations, although bearing an intact PP1 binding motif, failed to rescue the protein synthesis, suggesting that certain functional determinants exist in the C-terminal region (25Cheng G. Gross M. Brett M.E. He B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3666-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because HSV-1 ICP34.5 plays a role as a PP1 regulatory subunit to determine the specific dephosphorylation of eIF2α, we examined the association of PP1 and eIF2α in the presence or absence of ICP34.5. We first investigated the interaction of PP1 and eIF2α by BiFC assay, an approach that allows the visualization of protein interactions in living cells (26Hu C.D. Kerppola T.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). PP1 or eIF2α was fused to the YN or YC fragment of YFP, and an interaction between the two proteins facilitated association between the fragments to produce a bimolecular fluorescent complex (23Kerppola T.K. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1278-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Cells were cotransfected with the constructs YN-PP1 and YC-eIF2α, along with plasmids encoding the wild-type ICP34.5 (WT) or ICP34.5 mutation (V193E, F195L) that failed to bind PP1, respectively, or a control plasmid. Then the cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy and subjected to flow cytometry analysis. The mean fluorescence intensity reflects the binding efficiency of the associated YN and YC fragments (23Kerppola T.K. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1278-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, high fluorescence was detected in the cells cotransfected with ICP34.5 (WT) (center panel), with a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 479.61, reflecting a close contact between PP1 and eIF2α. In contrast, little fluorescence was seen in the presence of mutated ICP34.5 (V193E, F195L) (bottom panel) or the control plasmid, with much lower MFI scores, indicating a very rare interaction. The expression levels of the indicated proteins were monitored by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B), validating the proteins in the BiFC analysis. We confirmed the role of ICP34.5 in the interaction between PP1 and eIF2α by coimmunoprecipitation. Cells were cotransfected plasmids encoding Flag-tagged PP1 and eIF2α together with the control plasmid ICP34.5 (WT) or ICP34.5 (V193E, F195L), respectively, and PP1 were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 1C, eIF2α was coimmunoprecipitated with PP1 in cell lysates containing wild-type ICP34.5 but not PP1 binding-defect ICP34.5 (V193E, F195L), even though the three components were expressed evenly as analyzed by Western blot analysis (three bottom panels). Collectively, the above in vivo and in vitro results indicate that PP1 associates with eIF2α only when ICP34.5 presents, and PP1 binding capability of ICP34.5 is essential in this process. Because PP1 has a variety of substrates, its specificity for eIF2α is to be achieved by ICP34.5. We thus hypothesized that ICP34.5 may bind to eIF2α so as to bring the substrate to PP1 specifically. We next tested the association between ICP34.5 and eIF2α by BiFC assay. The nonspecific binding between the YN and YC fragments were excluded, as negative binding was observed in the combination of YN-eIF2α with YC or YC-ICP34.5 (WT) with YN (Fig. 2A, two top panels). The binding between ICP34.5 (WT) and eIF2α was positively indicated with an MFI score of 167.64 (Fig. 2A, third panel). Intriguingly, positive interaction was obtained in ICP34.5 (V193E, F195L) and eIF2α (Fig. 2A, lower panel), with MFI much higher than the two control groups, suggesting that the PP1 binding capability of ICP34.5 is not required for the interaction between eIF2α and ICP34.5. The expression level of YN-eIF2α is comparable with the endogenous eIF2α (Fig. 2B), thus the effect of endogenous protein in BiFC assay is negligible as reported (23Kerppola T.K. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1278-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The coimmunoprecipitation assay was also carried out to detect the interaction between ICP34.5 and eIF2α. The cells were cotransfected with combinations of plasmids encoding eIF2α and ICP34.5 or its variant (V193E, F195L) or ICP34.5 with an unrelated protein as a negative control (Fig. 2C, lane 1) or PP1 plus ICP34.5 as a positive control (lane 2). When PP1 or eIF2α was precipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies, although ICP34.5 (WT) was expectedly pulled down with PP1 (Fig. 2C, lane 2), ICP34.5 WT and the mutation (V193E, F195L) were both coprecipitated with eIF2α (lane 3 and 4). All proteins were expressed comparably in each transfectant, as shown in Fig. 2C (lysates panels). Alternatively, when ICP34.5 was used as an immobilized phase, the FLAG-tagged eIF2α was coimmunoprecipitated and detected in the pellet (Fig. 2D, lanes 3 and 4), with similar negative and positive controls in lanes 1 and 2. To exclude the effect of the ectopic expression of eIF2α as in the above assays, we confirmed the binding ICP34.5 with endogenous eIF2α by coimmunoprecipitation. In this experiment, we used plasmids encoding fusion proteins GFP-PP1 and GFP-ICP34.5 and then immunoprecipitated them with anti-GFP antibody. As show in Fig. 2E, the endogenous eIF2α was detected only in lane 3 with ICP34.5 but not in the GFP control (lane 1) or GFP-PP1 (lane 2) in the coimmunoprecipitation sample by anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 2E, two top panels). On the other hand, detectable ICP34.5 was coimmunoprecipitated with the endogenous eIF2α by anti-eIF2α antibody (Fig. 2E, two center rows, lane 3). We further attempted to detect this interaction in live virus-infected cells. As shown in Fig. 2F, coimmunoprecipitation with ICP34.5 antibody resolved a component of eIF2α in the HSV-infected cell lysate (right lane), whereas eIF2α from the infected HSV cell lysate was detected with the immobilized ICP34.5 (right lane) but not in the R3616-infected sample (left lane). All protein expression levels were shown to be comparable (Fig. 2F, lower panels). Together, the above coimmunoprecipitation data witnessed the interaction between eIF2α and ICP34.5 seen by BiFC assay (Fig. 2A) and demonstrated the molecular tangency of eIF2α with viral protein ICP34.5. It is further revealed that the PP1 binding motif of ICP34.5 is not mandatory to its association with eIF2α (Fig. 2, A, C, and D), suggesting that HSV ICP34.5 contains two independent motifs, one for binding PP1 (RVxF), and the other for eIF2α. As illustrated previously, eIF2α is phosphorylated upon viral infection by PKR, and ICP34.5 mediated the dephosphorylation of eIF2α. We then asked whether ICP34.5 is selective for the phosphorylated eIF2α. Serine 51 is the phosphorylation site of eIF2α by PKR or other PKR-like kinases to halt protein synthesis. We thus substituted Ser 51 with an aspartic acid (S51D) or an alanine (S51A) residue to mimic the phosphorylated eIF2α or dephosphorylated eIF2α. In the BiFC assay, except for the control sample (Fig. 3A, top panel), ICP34.5 exhibits similar binding features with wild-type eIF2α (Fig. 3A, second panel from top), S51A (third panel from top), and S51D (bottom panel). The protein expression of ICP34.5 and eIF2α variants was comparable, as shown in Fig. 3B. The FACS analyses and MFI scores of samples with the eIF2α wild type, S51A, and S51D (Fig. 3A, 94.51, 81.51, and 87.08, respectively) are much higher than the control (28.89), indicating that ICP34.5 associates with eIF2α regardless of the phosphorylation state of eIF2α at Ser-51. As described above, ICP34.5 associates eIF2α without compromising its PP1 binding motif. There must be such a region responsible for binding eIF2α. Indeed, the dephosphorylation of eIF2α is interrupted even when the PP1 binding feature is intact (20Zhang C. Tang J. Xie J. Zhang H. Li Y. Zhang J. Verpooten D. He B. Cao Y. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 25Cheng G. Gross M. Brett M.E. He B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3666-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We therefore set up to identify the region of ICP34.5 responsible for eIF2α interaction. As mentioned previously, ICP34.5 is divided into three domains: an amino-terminal domain, 10 repeats of three amino acids (Ala-Thr-Asp), and a carboxyl-terminal domain. We first constructed two truncation mutants: WT-N (a deletion of C-terminal amino acids 205–263) and WT-C (a deletion of N-terminal aa 1–180), as depicted in Fig. 4A. Then we detected the binding ability of mutants with eIF2α in a BiFC assay. As shown in Fig. 4B, we can see that there is little interaction between eIF2α and the ICP34.5WT-N mutant, with a score of 3.16. However, there is a distinct binding between eIF2α and the ICP34.5WT-C mutant, with a score of 53.82. This result clearly excludes the involvement of the N-terminal peptide and addressed that the C-terminal stretch of peptides contains the eIF2α binding domain. To investigate which region of carboxyl-terminal domain is required for eIF2α binding, we constructed a series of plasmids encoding YC-fused ICP34.5, as listed in Fig. 4A, ΔC45 (a deletion of amino acids 218–263), ΔC30 (a deletion of amino acids 233–263), and ΔC15 (a deletion of amino acids 248–263). The BiFC assay narrowed down the binding region, as shown in Fig. 4D. The fluorescence and the mean values of YFP intensity in the upper panel indicate the interaction between eIF2α and ICP34.5 (WT) or mutants. Valid interactions occurred between eIF2α and ICP34.5 WT, with a score of 83.53 (Fig. 4D, second row) and ICP34.5 (ΔC15), with a score of 76.61 (A, bottom row), whereas ICP34.5 (ΔC45) and ICP34.5 (ΔC30) (as indicated in A) exhibited no binding as that in the control (A, top row). The sharp contrast between ΔC30 and ΔC15 in the binding of eIF2α indicates that the region covering aa 233–248 may be responsible for the interaction with eIF2α. Thereafter, an ICP34.5 mutation Δ233–248 (a deletion of amino acids 233–248) was constructed, and the binding of eIF2α was analyzed by BiFC assay. As predicted, deletion of amino acids 233–248 completely abolished its interaction with eIF2α, with an MFI score of 10.56 (Fig. 4F, bottom row), the same as the negative control (top row), in comparison with the positive eIF2α binding by wild-type ICP34.5 with a score of 83.52. Taken together, these results indicate that the peptide stretch from 233–248 of ICP34.5 is responsible for eIF2α binding. Sequence alignment indicates the high homology with human and mouse GADD34, and secondary structure prediction implies a coil-to-helix structure along this region. It is likely that ICP34.5 binds to eIF2α via a helix structure. Further studies on the structure-function relationship of the conserved amino acids are ongoing. The crystal structure of the complex is also investigated to obtain detailed information of the interaction between ICP34.5 and eIF2α. The C-terminal region (233–248) of ICP34.5 is identified to bind to eIF2α. The next question is whether this region is relevant to viral replication. We therefore tested the rescue of viral protein synthesis and replication in HeLa cells infected with the ICP34.5-negative virus R3616 by GFP as a negative control or pretransfected ICP34.5 (WT), ICP34.5 (V193E, F195L), or ICP34.5 (Δ233–248), respectively. As shown in Fig. 5A, the infection-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α was obvious in the control group, with a ratio of phosphorylated to total eIF2α of 3.5. The expression of ICP34.5 (WT) significantly rescued the PP1 dephosphorylation of eIF2α to a ratio of 1.0, as we defined. However, no rescue of the dephosphorylation was seen in the presence of the ICP34.5 mutation with a PP1 binding defect (V193E, F195L) nor the mutation with the deletion of aa 233–248, which was designated to bind eIF2α. Correspondingly, the lack of the active form of eIF2α rendered a significant deficiency in viral protein synthesis (Fig. 5B). Viral protein synthesis in cells transfected with ICP34.5 (WT) was nearly 3-fold that of cells with ICP34.5 (Δ233–248). Collectively, the binding between eIF2α and ICP34.5 is essential for eIF2α dephosphorylation and viral protein synthesis. Deficient Protein synthesis results in compromised virus replication. Thereby, virus replication was examined in the presence of described ICP34.5 and its variants as described above. HeLa cells belong to an interferon competent cell line. Upon infection, HSV-1 exhibited nearly 1000 fold higher replication than its ICP34.5 deleted virus, R3616, as previously described. Here we pre-transfected cells with plasmids encoding GFP control, wild type ICP34.5, PP1 binding defective variant, and Δ233–248, respectively, as indicated in Fig. 5C, and challenged with R3616. At 24 h post infection, virus yields were determined. As shown in Fig. 5C, R3616 replicated to a titer of 6 × 104 pfu/ml, and the expression of ICP34.5 (WT) efficiently rescued viral replication to nearly 1 × 107pfu/ml, to the extent of a wild type HSV-1 (previous data, and data not shown). However, the protein deficient mutations of ICP34.5, V193E, F195L and Δ233–248 were hardly restore the virus replication (4.6 × 104pfu/ml) (Fig. 5C). Therefore, for the efficient replication of HSV-1, not only the PP1 binding motif is required for the determinant factor ICP34.5, but also the site 233–248 responsible for interaction with eIF2α is indispensable. These two components of ICP34.5 are interdependent to achieve the dephosphorylation of eIF2α, and thus protein synthesis and viral replication. ICP34.5 of herpes simplex viruses is a virulent factor with multiple cellular functions. As reported for GADD34, ICP34.5 contains a consensus binding site for PP1. The PP1 binding motif is required for the formation of a high-molecular-weight complex that contains the dephosphorylation activity toward eIF2α (27Cheng G. Yang K. He B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 10154-10161Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ICP34.5 truncation mutations or replacement of the conserved amino acids completely abolishes the dephosphorylation of eIF2α. Even the PP1 binding motif remains intact. We illustrated that the enzyme-substrate interaction, in this case the PP1-eIF2α interaction, occurs in the presence of ICP34.5 (Fig. 1) as well as GADD34 (data not shown) and suggested that ICP34.5 brings PP1 and eIF2α into the vicinity for dephosphorylation. The heterotrimer of PP1-ICP34.5-eIF2α may be part of the components in the high-molecular-weight complex, as mentioned earlier (25Cheng G. Gross M. Brett M.E. He B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3666-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of ICP34.5 was identified previously to contain a PP1 binding motif at aa 192–196 (19He B. Gross M. Roizman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20737-20743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Virus bearing a mutated ICP34.5 at this motif was rendered by reduced replication similar to that of the deletion mutation R3616 (25Cheng G. Gross M. Brett M.E. He B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3666-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the C-terminal truncation of ICP34.5 with an intact PP1 binding motif also displayed deficient replication. An alternative site that indirectly binds PP1 was suggested, using ICP34.5 human homologue GADD34, and it was proposed that GADD34 has another site for the binding of PP1 inhibitor-1 for function (28Brush M.H. Weiser D.C. Shenolikar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1292-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Here we addressed that the GADD34-homologous region of ICP34.5 contains a stretch of peptide that facilitates the recruitment of eIF2α to PP1. This binding is independent of the PP1 binding motif, as the mutation failed to bind PP1 does not affect the association of ICP34.5 and eIF2α (Fig. 2). Inversely, ICP34.5 lacking the eIF2α binding site still binds PP1 in in vivo and in vitro assays (data not shown). This work identified a region (aa 233–248) of ICP34.5 responsible for the association with eIF2α. This region is highly homologous to GADD34. Prediction of the secondary structure displayed a coil structure right next to the helix region made with the arginine-rich domain (20Zhang C. Tang J. Xie J. Zhang H. Li Y. Zhang J. Verpooten D. He B. Cao Y. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Further effort on crystal structure of ICP34.5 would provide molecular details in the dephosphorylation module, consisting of ICP34.5, PP1, and eIF2α. In HSV-infected cells, ICP34.5 counteracts PKR by mediating eIF2α activity (9He B. Gross M. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). ICP34.5 perhaps plays a scaffold role for PP1 and its substrate eIF2α that is of great importance to the dephosphorylation reaction. In this regard, aa 233–248 of ICP34.5 are considered to be another functional determinant in HSV infection in addition to its PP1 binding motif. The effect of this region on the physiological measures is 3-fold. 1) Viral protein synthesis in cells infected with R3616 can be rescued by wild-type ICP34.5, by the mutation with a deletion of aa 233–248, or by the mutated PP1 binding motif. 2) The dephosphorylation of eIF2α exhibits great correlation with the protein synthesis. 3) The above defect in protein synthesis is rendered by the deficient viral replication. In summary, we present the new finding that ICP34.5 associates with eIF2α and identify the corresponding region that locates apart from the PP1 binding motif at the C-terminal effector domain. We also addressed that the interaction of ICP34.5 with eIF2α is independent of the binding with PP1, leading to the hypothetic model of ICP34.5 as a scaffold to bridge PP1 and eIF2α. Amino acids 233–248 of ICP34.5 are essential for the function of ICP34.5 in viral replication. Further studies on resolving the three-dimensional structure of the complex will provide detailed information on the mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2035597871,"Although RhoA activity is necessary for promoting myogenic mesenchymal stem cell fates, recent studies in cultured cells suggest that down-regulation of RhoA activity in specified myoblasts is required for subsequent differentiation and myotube formation. However, whether this phenomenon occurs in vivo and which Rho modifiers control these later events remain unclear. We found that expression of the Rho-GTPase-activating protein, GRAF1, was transiently up-regulated during myogenesis, and studies in C2C12 cells revealed that GRAF1 is necessary and sufficient for mediating RhoA down-regulation and inducing muscle differentiation. Moreover, forced expression of GRAF1 in pre-differentiated myoblasts drives robust muscle fusion by a process that requires GTPase-activating protein-dependent actin remodeling and BAR-dependent membrane binding or sculpting. Moreover, morpholino-based knockdown studies in Xenopus laevis determined that GRAF1 expression is critical for muscle development. GRAF1-depleted embryos exhibited elevated RhoA activity and defective myofibrillogenesis that resulted in progressive muscle degeneration, defective motility, and embryonic lethality. Our results are the first to identify a GTPase-activating protein that regulates muscle maturation and to highlight the functional importance of BAR domains in myotube formation."
https://openalex.org/W2082936028,"We generated a transgenic mouse model expressing the apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-causing mutation ACTC E99K at 50% of total heart actin and compared it with actin from patients carrying the same mutation. The actin mutation caused a higher Ca(2+) sensitivity in reconstituted thin filaments measured by in vitro motility assay (2.3-fold for mice and 1.3-fold for humans) and in skinned papillary muscle. The mutation also abolished the change in Ca(2+) sensitivity normally linked to troponin I phosphorylation. MyBP-C and troponin I phosphorylation levels were the same as controls in transgenic mice and human carrier heart samples. ACTC E99K mice exhibited a high death rate between 28 and 45 days (48% females and 22% males). At 21 weeks, the hearts of the male survivors had enlarged atria, increased interstitial fibrosis, and sarcomere disarray. MRI showed hypertrophy, predominantly at the apex of the heart. End-diastolic volume and end-diastolic pressure were increased, and relaxation rates were reduced compared with nontransgenic littermates. End-systolic pressures and volumes were unaltered. ECG abnormalities were present, and the contractile response to β-adrenergic stimulation was much reduced. Older mice (29-week-old females and 38-week-old males) developed dilated cardiomyopathy with increased end-systolic volume and continuing increased end-diastolic pressure and slower contraction and relaxation rates. ECG showed atrial flutter and frequent atrial ectopic beats at rest in some ACTC E99K mice. We propose that the ACTC E99K mutation causes higher myofibrillar Ca(2+) sensitivity that is responsible for the sudden cardiac death, apical hypertrophy, and subsequent development of heart failure in humans and mice."
https://openalex.org/W1997584810,"Non-structural protein 1 from influenza A virus, NS1A, is a key multifunctional virulence factor composed of two domains: an N-terminal double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding domain and a C-terminal effector domain (ED). Isolated RNA-binding and effector domains of NS1A both exist as homodimers in solution. Despite recent crystal structures of isolated ED and full-length NS1A proteins from different influenza virus strains, controversy remains over the actual biologically relevant ED dimer interface. Here, we report the biophysical properties of the NS1A ED from H3N2 influenza A/Udorn/307/1972 (Ud) virus in solution. Several lines of evidence, including 15N NMR relaxation, NMR chemical shift perturbations, static light scattering, and analytical sedimentation equilibrium, demonstrate that Ud NS1A ED forms a relatively weak dimer in solution (Kd = 90 ± 2 μm), featuring a symmetric helix-helix dimer interface. Mutations within and near this interface completely abolish dimerization, whereas mutations consistent with other proposed ED dimer interfaces have no effect on dimer formation. In addition, the critical Trp-187 residue in this interface serves as a sensitive NMR spectroscopic marker for the concentration-dependent dimerization of NS1A ED in solution. Finally, dynamic light scattering and gel shift binding experiments demonstrate that the ED interface plays a role in both the oligomerization and the dsRNA binding properties of the full-length NS1A protein. In particular, mutation of the critical tryptophan in the ED interface substantially reduces the propensity of full-length NS1A from different strains to oligomerize and results in a reduction in dsRNA binding affinity for full-length NS1A.

Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness in humans caused by influenza A and B viruses that results in an annual average of 36,000 deaths in the United States alone (www.cdc.gov/Flu). Influenza A viruses, infecting birds and mammals, periodically cause widespread pandemics, the most deadly of which was the 1918 “Spanish Flu” pandemic that claimed an estimated 50 million lives (1Taubenberger J.K. Morens D.M. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2006; 12: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In recent years, the appearance of new H5N1 and H1N1 influenza A viruses, known as “avian flu” and “swine flu,” respectively, has fueled fears of an impending deadly influenza pandemic in the 21st century. Moreover, the rapid emergence of influenza virus strains resistant to current antiviral drugs directed against influenza A neuraminidase and M2 ion channel accentuate the need for the development of new classes of influenza antivirals. Toward this end, several recent structural and functional studies of influenza proteins have illuminated new potential drug targets in influenza (2Krug R.M. Aramini J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2009; 30: 269-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 3Das K. Aramini J.M. Ma L.C. Krug R.M. Arnold E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). One such target is the non-structural protein 1 of influenza A, NS1A, a key multifunctional virulence factor produced in the host infected cell that plays a critical role in evading the host antiviral response (4Hale B.G. Randall R.E. Ortín J. Jackson D. J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 2359-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). This highly conserved protein is composed of two domains, the 73-residue N-terminal double-stranded RNA-binding domain (RBD) 4The abbreviations used are: RBDRNA-binding domainEDeffector domainHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherenceTROSYtransverse relaxation optimized spectroscopySUMOsmall ubiquitin-like modifier. and the C-terminal (residues 86-end) effector domain (ED), joined by a flexible linker (Fig. 1).

However, there is some controversy concerning the exact nature of the dimer interface of NS1A ED. The ED of NS1A from H1N1 influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8 NS1A) was reported to feature an antiparallel strand-strand dimer interface mediated by short β-strands encompassing residues 88–91, located near the N terminus of the domain (20Bornholdt Z.A. Prasad B.V. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 559-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). On the other hand, EDs from H12N5 influenza A/Duck/Alberta/60/1976 (Alb NS1A) and H3N2 influenza A/Udorn/307/1972 (Ud NS1A) exhibit a helix-helix dimer interface involving the C-terminal portion of the long α-helix in each subunit (21Hale B.G.

Crystallogr. 2009; 65: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Mutation of a key tryptophan in this helix, Trp-187, was shown to cause monomer formation in solution by analytical gel filtration and static light scattering (21Hale B.G. Barclay W.S. Randall R.E.

This same region of the protein forms part of a conserved hydrophobic pocket that binds to the F2F3 fragment of CPSF30 (24Twu K.Y. Noah D.L. Rao P. Kuo R.L. Krug R.M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 3957-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) in the tetrameric complex formed between pairs of isolated Ud NS1A EDs and F2F3 domains (25Das K. Ma L.C. Xiao R. Radvansky B.

Yet a third intermolecular ED-ED interface was reported in a recent crystal structure of a R38A/K41A double mutant of the full-length NS1A protein from the highly virulent H5N1 influenza A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (VN NS1A). This structure showed a more twisted variation of the PR8 NS1A ED dimer and featured several electrostatic interactions between the two ED chains (26Bornholdt Z.A. Prasad B.V. Nature. 2008; 456: 985-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Here, we present extensive biophysical and mutational studies on Ud NS1A ED that conclusively demonstrate that the effector domain from this strain adopts a helix-helix dimer interface in solution. Moreover, we show that the tryptophan at this interface, Trp-187, is critical for dimerization and serves as an excellent spectroscopic marker for the dimerization of this domain. Furthermore, we examine the role of the ED dimerization interface in properties of the full-length NS1A protein in solution. We demonstrate that this ED interface is critical for the concentration-dependent oligomerization of the full-length protein. We also show that this ED interface plays a role in modulating dsRNA binding. The full-length NS1A protein exhibits higher affinity in dsRNA binding than the RBD domain alone, indicating that the ED enhances dsRNA binding. Elimination of the ED interface by mutation of Trp-187 reduces this enhancement. Constructs of wild type influenza A/Udorn/307/1972 NS1A(85–215), hereafter referred to as Ud NS1A ED, for NMR, static light scattering and sedimentation equilibrium studies were cloned with a C-terminal His6 affinity purification tag, expressed, and purified following the standard protocols of the Northeast Structural Genomics (NESG) consortium (27Acton T.B.

Single-residue mutations were cloned using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and expressed and purified in the same manner as the wild type proteins. Unless otherwise indicated, all protein samples for NMR spectroscopy, static and dynamic light scattering, and sedimentation equilibrium experiments were exchanged into a buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm arginine, 50 mm glutamic acid, 5 mm DTT, and 1% glycerol at pH 6.9. NMR samples of Ud NS1A ED and its mutants were prepared at protein concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 1.2 mm. Three concentrations (6, 12.5, and 25 μm) of wild type Ud NS1A ED were spun at four different speeds (18,000, 25,000, 32,000, and 40,000 rpm). Sedimentation profiles were monitored using the absorbance (280 nm) optical detection system on a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge. Samples were spun until the root mean square deviation between consecutive scans, spaced 2 h apart, was less than the inherent noise of the optical system (∼0.02 absorbance units). The analysis was conducted at 20 °C. The partial specific volume and extinction coefficient of the protein, as well as the density of the buffer, were determined using the program Sednterp (31Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S. Rowe A. Horton J. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). The data were processed using Sedfit and analyzed using Sedphat (32Vistica J. Dam J. Balbo A. Yikilmaz E. Mariuzza R.A. Rouault T.A. Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 234-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The meniscus position was first optimized for each scan and then fixed for subsequent analysis. Each profile (one concentration at one speed) was initially analyzed using both the monomer model and the monomer-dimer model. In the monomer model, the molecular weight was treated as a floating parameter, and in the monomer-dimer model the Kd was treated as a floating parameter and the molecular weight was fixed at the theoretical value for a monomer. The Kd was determined by globally analyzing all 12 scans simultaneously. Static light scattering data for wild type and [W187R]Ud 5Throughout this study, the designation [W187R]Ud indicates substitution where the mutation W187R is inserted in the Ud NS1A protein, and [W182A]VN indicates substitution where the mutation W182A is inserted in the VN NS1A protein. NS1A ED were collected on a miniDAWN (TREOS) light scattering instrument (Wyatt Technology) coupled with an analytical gel filtration column at λ = 690 nm. All measurements were performed at room temperature and with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Data were analyzed using the ASTRA software package (Wyatt Technology). NMR spectra of Ud NS1A ED and its mutants were acquired on Bruker AVANCE 800- and 600-MHz spectrometers equipped with 5-mm TXI and 1.7-mm TCI cryoprobes, respectively, at 300 K and referenced to internal 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid. All multidimensional NMR spectra were processed with NMRPipe (33Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar) and visualized using Sparky (34Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. Sparky 3. University of California, San Francisco, CA2006Google Scholar). The rotational correlation time, τc, is the time for a protein to rotate one radian. For an approximately spherical globular protein, the rotational correlation time, τc, is related to its effective hydrodynamic radius (a), and thus its oligomerization state, according to the Stokes-Einstein equation (Equation 1), where η is viscosity and T is temperature.τc≈4πηa33kTEq. 1 In the limit of slow molecular motion (τc ≫ 0.5 ns), the correlation time of a protein is related to the ratio of the longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) 15N relaxation times and nuclear frequency (νN) according to Equation 2 (35Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar, 36Fushman D. Weisemann R. Thüring H. Rüterjans H. J. Biomol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar) by fitting the integrated signal in the backbone amide 1H region of the spectrum as a function of delay time to an exponential decay. The correlation time is then estimated using Equation 2 and compared with a standard curve of τc versus protein molecular weight (Mr) obtained on a series of known monomeric proteins of varying size, taking into account isotopic enrichment and the presence of affinity purification tags, to assess the oligomerization state of the protein (38Rossi P. Swapna G.V. Huang Y.J. Aramini J.M. Anklin C. Conover K. Hamilton K. Xiao R. Acton T.B. Ertekin A. Everett J.K. Montelione G.T. J. Biomol. NMR. 2010; 46: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For wild type and mutant Ud NS1A ED samples, all one-dimensional 15N T1 and T2 relaxation measurements were acquired at 300 K on a Bruker AVANCE 800-MHz spectrometer with the following typical relaxation delays: T1 spectra, T = 100, 200, 300, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1500, 2500, 3500, and 5000 ms, and with a relaxation delay of 5 s; T2 spectra with CPMG delays, T = 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, and 160 ms, and with a relaxation delay of 1.5 s. All 15N T1 and T2 relaxation data for the standard set of known NESG monomeric proteins were obtained on Bruker AVANCE 600- and 800-MHz spectrometers at 298 K. In all cases, 15N T1 and T2 relaxation times were extracted from plots of the decay in integrated 1HN intensity between δ ∼8.4 and 9.8 ppm versus delay time by fitting the curves with standard exponential equations using the program t1guide within TopSpin 2.0 (Bruker BioSpin). Complete 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments for [W187R]Ud NS1A(85–215) were determined using conventional triple resonance NMR methods. Backbone assignments were made by AutoAssign 2.4.0 (39Moseley H.N. Monleon D. Montelione G.T. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 91-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) using peak lists from two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC and three-dimensional HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HN(CO)CA, HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH, and HNCACB spectra. Side chain assignment was completed manually using three-dimensional HBHA(CACO)NH, HCCH-COSY, HCCH-TOCSY and (H)CCH-TOCSY experiments on U-13C,15N-labeled [W187R]Ud NS1A(85–215). Stereospecific isopropyl methyl assignments for all Val and Leu residues were deduced from characteristic cross-peak fine structures in high resolution two-dimensional 1H-13C HSQC spectra of U-5%-13C,100%-15N-labeled [W187R]Ud NS1A(85–215) (40Neri D. Szyperski T. Otting G. Senn H. Wüthrich K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Histidine tautomeric states were elucidated by two-dimensional 1H-15N heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence (HMQC) spectroscopy (41Pelton J.G. Torchia D.A. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Resonance assignments were validated using the Assignment Validation Suite (AVS) software package (42Moseley H.N. Sahota G. Montelione G.T. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 28: 341-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB accession number 16376). Near complete backbone and Cβ assignments for wild type Ud NS1A ED were obtained by automated assignment (39Moseley H.N. Monleon D. Montelione G.T. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 91-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) of peak lists from two-dimensional 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC- and TROSY-based versions of three-dimensional HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HN(CO)CA, HNCA, HN(CO)CACB, and HNCACB spectra obtained on [U-2H,13C,15N]Ud NS1A(85–215); experiments featuring Cα/Cβ frequency labeling were performed with 2H decoupling. Isoleucine, leucine, and valine methyl assignments were confirmed by two-dimensional 1H-13C HSQC and three-dimensional 13C- and 15N-edited NOESY spectra of [U-2H,13C,15N; 1H-Ile-δ1,Leu-δ,Val-γ,Phe,Tyr]Ud NS1A(85–215). Composite changes in 1H and 15N backbone amide chemical shifts, Δδcomp, were computed from assigned 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC spectra of wild type and [W187R]Ud NS1A ED using Equation 3 (43Farmer 2nd, B.T.

One-bond N-HN residual dipolar couplings, 1DNH, were obtained on U-5%-13C,100%-15N-labeled [W187R]Ud NS1A(85–215) aligned in 4.2% C12E5 (PEG, Sigma-Aldrich) using standard protocols (44Rückert M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Crossref Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The residual dipolar couplings were determined from 1J(HN-N) scalar couplings measured from an interleaved pair of two-dimensional 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC acquisitions on isotropic and aligned samples (45Kontaxis G. Clore G.M. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 143: 184-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The solution NMR structure of [W187R]Ud NS1A(85–215) was calculated using CYANA 3.0 (46Güntert P.

Delaglio F. Cornilescu G. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2009; 44: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar) and 1DNH residual dipolar couplings for ordered residues. The 20 structures with the lowest target function out of 100 in the final cycle calculated were further refined by restrained molecular dynamics in explicit water with CNS 1.1 (50Brünger A.T.

Structural statistics and global structure quality factors were computed using the PSVS 1.3 software package (52Bhattacharya A. Tejero R. Montelione G.T.

The global goodness of fit of the final structure ensembles with the NOESY peak list data and residual dipolar couplings was determined using the RPF analysis (54Huang Y.J. Powers R. Montelione G.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 1665-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and PALES (55Zweckstetter M. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) programs, respectively. The final refined ensemble of 20 structures (excluding the C-terminal His6) was deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID 2KKZ). Three-dimensional protein structure comparison with structures in the Protein Data Bank was conducted using the DaliLite version 3 server (56Holm L. Kääriäinen S. Rosenström P. Schenkel A. Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 2780-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). All structure figures were made using PyMOL (59DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. Schrödinger, LLC, New York2010Google Scholar). All dynamic light scattering experiments were performed on a DynaPro99 series D instrument (Wyatt Technology) at 20 °C at a wavelength of 824.3 nm and a scattering angle of 90°. Each protein sample (15 μl) was centrifuged (10 min at 13,000 × g) and loaded into a 1.5-mm cuvette. Autocorrelations for 20 s were collected, and the data were averaged for three groups of 20 repeats. Points with an intensity fluctuating greater than 15% from the average were eliminated. The scattering data were analyzed with DYNAMICS C5.25.44 software (Wyatt Technology). Final molecular weight values were normalized to the expected molecular weight of the full-length NS1A dimer. Gel shift assays for dsRNA binding affinity of wild type Ud NS1A(1–215), [W187R]Ud NS1A(1–215), and Ud NS1A(1–73) were performed following previous protocols (57Wang W. Riedel K. Lynch P. Chien C.Y. Montelione G.T. Krug R.M. RNA. 1999; 5: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Briefly, 140-bp dsRNA was prepared by annealing the sense and antisense transcripts of a globin sequence inserted into the pGEM1 vector. Samples of 32P-labeled dsRNA (10,000 cpm, ∼0.36 nm) were incubated with varying concentrations of NS1A protein on ice for 30 min in 20 μl of binding buffer (43 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm DTT, 8% glycerol, 0.5 μg/μl tRNA, 0.5 units/μl RNase inhibitor, pH 8.0). All samples were run at 4 °C on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (60:1) for 2–3 h at 150 V using 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA as the running buffer. The equilibrium constant (Kd) for dimerization o"

SOCS1 has been shown to inhibit responses to IFN-γ and might thereby play a central role in the outcome of infection. We found that M. tuberculosis is a highly efficient stimulator of SOCS1 expression in murine and human macrophages and in tissues from infected mice. Surprisingly, SOCS1 reduced responses to IL-12, resulting in an impaired IFN-γ secretion by macrophages that in turn accounted for a deteriorated intracellular mycobacterial control. Despite SOCS1 expression, mycobacteria-infected macrophages responded to exogenously added IFN-γ. SOCS1 attenuated the expression of the majority of genes modulated by M. tuberculosis infection of macrophages. Using a conditional knockdown strategy in mice, we found that SOCS1 expression by macrophages hampered M. tuberculosis clearance early after infection in vivo in an IFN-γ-dependent manner. On the other hand, at later time points, SOCS1 expression by non-macrophage cells protected the host from infection-induced detrimental inflammation.

Tuberculosis, an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains a leading public health problem worldwide. The global incidence of tuberculosis is rising, with 8.8 million new cases and 2 million deaths each year (1World Health Organization Global Tuberculosis Control: Surveillance, Planning, Financing. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2006: 1Google Scholar). In most cases, the human immune system is able to control bacterial replication and prevent development of active disease. The rate of progression from colonization to disease is low, and ∼90% of infected individuals never develop clinical disease. However, M. tuberculosis is able to prevent the host immune response from totally eliminating the microorganism. Thus, the host becomes chronically infected. A host counters mycobacterial infections primarily via Th1 immune responses involving cellular effector mechanisms, such as macrophage activation. IFN-γ is known to be an important mediator of macrophage activation and intracellular control of pathogens, including mycobacteria (2Nathan C.F. Murray H.W. Wiebe M.E. Rubin B.Y. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 670-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). Disseminated M. tuberculosis is observed in IFN-γ-deficient mice (3Cooper A.M. Dalton D.K. Stewart T.A. Griffin J.P. Russell D.G.

Med. 1993; 178: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar). Individuals with defects in genes involved in the secretion or signaling of IFN-γ are even susceptible to weakly virulent mycobacteria (5Casanova J.L. Abel L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 581-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). However, the expression of selected IFN-γ-inducible genes is paradoxically decreased in macrophages infected with mycobacteria (6Hmama Z. Gabathuler R. Jefferies W.A. de Jong G. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4882-4893PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hussain S. Zwilling B.S. Lafuse W.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2041-2048PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wojciechowski W. DeSanctis J. Skamene E. Radzioch D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2688-2696PubMed Google Scholar). It remains unclear how mycobacteria-induced signaling contributes to macrophage dysfunction. Immune and inflammatory systems are controlled by multiple cytokines, including interleukins and interferons. Many cytokines exert their biological function through Janus kinases (JAK) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT). SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling) is a family of eight intracellular proteins. SOCS proteins function in a negative feedback loop to inhibit cytokine signaling by binding to either JAK or the cytokine receptor, either inhibiting JAK activity directly or targeting the receptor complex for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation (9Yoshimura A. Naka T. Kubo M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 454-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). SOCS1, one of the better described of the family members, has been reported to inhibit STAT1-mediated responses (10Kile B.T. Alexander W.S. Cell Mol.

The vital importance of SOCS1 is stressed by the fact that SOCS1−/− mice die within 3 weeks after birth with severe lymphopenia, necrosis of the liver, and mononuclear infiltration of several organs (12Alexander W.S.

We studied the regulation and role of SOCS1 during mycobacterial infection of human and mouse macrophages as well as during infection in vivo.

Animals were bred and kept under specific pathogen-free conditions. All mice were backcrossed to C57Bl/6 genetic background that was used as a control. RAG1−/−/SOCS1−/− mice were obtained by crossing RAG1−/− and SOCS1−/+ mice (33Yang T. Stark P. Janik K. Wigzell H. Rottenberg M.E. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 4040-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similarly, IFN-γ−/−/SOCS1−/− mice were generated by crossing of IFN-γ−/− and SOCS1+/− mice. Tissue-specific SOCS1-deficient mice were generated using the cre/loxP system by breeding SOCS1fl/fl mice, which carry a SOCS1 allele flanked by loxP sites (34Hashimoto M. Ayada T. Kinjyo I.

SOCS1fl/fl mice were generated on a C57BL/6 genetic background, whereas all other mice were 5th to 10th generation backcrosses to C57BL/6. SOCS1fl/fl littermates were used as controls in our experiments. The deletion of the SOCS1 gene in macrophages but not in T cells from SOCS1fl/fl LysM cre mice was confirmed by PCR analysis (data not shown). Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) and dendritic cells (BMDC) were differentiated as described previously (36Rothfuchs A.G. Gigliotti D. Palmblad K. Andersson U. Wigzell H. Rottenberg M.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6453-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). CD14+ cells were isolated from peripheral blood from healthy donors by Ficoll-Hypaque, selected with anti-CD14 MACS beads (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA), and cultured in presence of GM-CSF as described (37Davies J.Q. Gordon S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 290: 105-116PubMed Google Scholar). BCG Montreal and M. tuberculosis Harlingen and H37Rv were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 (Difco) supplemented with albumin, dextrose, catalase, and, for BCG cultures, 50 μg/ml hygromycin (Sigma). BMM and BMDC were infected at the indicated MOI, and after 2 h, cells were washed twice with PBS to remove extracellular bacteria. Mice were infected intravenously with 1 × 106 BCG bacteria. M. tuberculosis Harlingen strain was inoculated by the aerosol route using a nose-only exposure unit (Intox Products, Albuquerque, NM) as described previously (38Chackerian A.A. Alt J.M. Perera T.V. Dascher C.C. Behar S.M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4501-4509Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). A 15-ml suspension of 0.5 × 106 M. tuberculosis was loaded into a nebulizer, and animals were exposed to the bacterial aerosol for 20 min. Bacteria were quantified on Middlebrook 7H11 agar containing a 10% enrichment of oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, catalase, 5 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 8 μg/ml polymyxin B grown for 3 weeks at 37 °C. Transcripts were quantified by real-time PCR as described previously (39Rothfuchs A.G. Trumstedt C. Mattei F. Schiavoni G. Hidmark A. Wigzell H. Rottenberg M.E. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 6982-6990Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The primer sequences used are shown in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. Hprt was used as a control gene to calculate the ΔCt values for individual samples. The relative amount of cytokine/Hprt transcripts was calculated using the 2−(ΔΔCt) method as described. These values were then used to calculate the relative expression of cytokine mRNA in uninfected and infected cells and tissues. Formalin-fixed samples of left lungs of mice experimentally inoculated with M. tuberculosis were blocked on paraffin. From each lung sample, four sections were obtained, one longitudinal along the long axis of the lobe and three across/transversal of the remaining piece of lung. The blocks were processed, and sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. All sections were interpreted by the same pathologist and scored semiquantitatively, blinded to the variables of the experiment. The following features were scored: 1) lung area occupied with granulomas (percentage of the total area of the section); 2) lung area free of lesions or area of healthy lung (percentage of the total area of the section); 3) abundance of lymphocytes within the tuberculous lesions, ranging from 0 (not observed) to 4 (very large aggregates, often forming nodules); 4) abundance of lymphocytes in perivascular cuffs, ranging from 0 (not observed) to 4 (very thick lymphocytic cuffs); and 5) extension of necrosis, raging from 0 (no necrosis observed) to 4 (extensive necrosis and necrotic centers with mineralization). Uninfected and BCG or M. tuberculosis-infected BMM were lysed and separated on 10% separating, 5% stacking SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described (15Chong M.M. Cornish A.L. Darwiche R. Stanley E.G. Purton J.F. Godfrey D.I. Hilton D.J. Starr R. Alexander W.S. Kay T.W. Immunity. 2003; 18: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Samples were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) by electroblotting at 100 V, 250 mA for 80 min. Immunostaining was performed using polyclonal rabbit anti-phosphorylated (Tyr701) STAT1, total STAT1, or anti-actin (1:500 dilution; Sigma). Membranes were then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:2000 dilution; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) and developed using ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences) and photographed using a Fuji intelligent dark box II digital camera. The RNA was labeled using Quick-Amp labeling kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Cy3-labeled cRNA was hybridized to Whole Mouse Genome Microarrays (Agilent), and the Agilent “Feature Extraction” software was used to extract data. The analysis included four arrays on a chip per sample. The data array consisted of infected or uninfected WT and SOCS1−/− BMM. The data were normalized in GeneSpring GX by setting threshold raw signal to 1 for the median of control samples. Base line was set to the median of all the samples. Of 41,252 probes, 37,469 probes passed filtered on expression 20–100th percentile in the raw data, of which 30,127 were flagged by software as present or marginally present in at least one condition. The microarray data were deposited in the GEO data base, accession number GSE23508. For the IFN-γ ELISPOT assay, 105 BMDC were infected with BCG and plated in triplicates in 96-well nitrocellulose-bottomed plates previously coated with 5 μg/ml anti-mouse IFN-γ mAb AN18 (MabTech AB, Sweden). Plates were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C. Biotinylated detector antibody (R4-6A2, MabTech) was added for 2 h and incubated at room temperature. Afterward, plates were washed and incubated for 1 h in the dark with 100 μl of avidin-peroxidase complexes (ABC-elite kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The spots were developed by adding 20 mg of 3-amino-9-ethyl-carbozole (Sigma) dissolved in 2.5 ml of dimethylformamide in 47.5 ml of acetate buffer containing 0.015% H2O2. Lungs were perfused with PBS through the heart before removal from mice. Following digestion with collagenase D and DNase I, erythrocytes were lysed, and single-cell suspensions were prepared by filtering lung tissue through 40-μm nylon cell strainers. Single spleen cell suspensions were obtained, and red blood cells were lysed. 106 cells were stimulated with 20 μg/ml PPD (Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark) overnight, followed by a 6-h incubation with brefeldin A (5 μg/ml). To determine the percentages of IFN-γ-secreting T-cells, we first stained with anti-mouse CD4 eFluor®450 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and CD3∈ PerCP (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and then permeabilized the cells using leukocytic permeabilization reagent IntraPrepTM (Beckman Coulter) and stained them with anti-IFN-γ APC (eBioscience). Data were acquired in a CyAnTM ADP flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR). In a first set of experiments, regulation of SOCS1 gene expression in macrophages infected with mycobacteria was studied. SOCS1 mRNA accumulation increased in BMM infected with BCG (Fig. 1A). In order to determine whether phagocytosis was required for SOCS1 expression, macrophages were treated with cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization. Cytochalasin D-treated BMM showed lower SOCS1 mRNA levels than untreated controls (Fig. 1A). As a control, similar levels of SOCS1 mRNA after incubation with a TLR agonist binding to cell surface receptors were measured in cells treated or not with cytochalasin D (supplemental Fig. S1A). We then asked whether MyD88- and IRF3-mediated intracellular signaling pathways are involved in the augmented SOCS1 mRNA levels after infection with BCG. Similar SOCS1 mRNA levels were found in BCG-infected IRF3−/− and wild type (WT) BMM, whereas infected MyD88−/− BMM displayed significantly lower SOCS1 mRNA levels than controls (Fig. 1B). Because TLR2 and -4 have been shown to recognize mycobacterial components and mediate MyD88-dependent macrophage responses to infection (40Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Smith K.D. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 14459-14463Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 41Thoma-Uszynski S. Stenger S. Takeuchi O. Ochoa M.T. Engele M. Sieling P.A. Barnes P.F. Rollinghoff M.

Immunol. 2002; 169: 3155-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), the role of these TLR in SOCS1 regulation during mycobacterial infection was studied. SOCS1 mRNA levels were diminished in TLR2−/− BMM, albeit to a lower degree than in MyD88−/− BMM (Fig. 1C). In line with this, stimulation of BMM with the TLR2 agonist Pam3 was sufficient to induce SOCS1 mRNA (Fig. 1D). In contrast, TLR4 seemed to play a minor role if any in regulation of SOCS1 mRNA levels in BCG-infected macrophages (Fig. 1C). The NOD2 pathway is also involved in mycobacterial recognition (43Gandotra S. Jang S. Murray P.J. Salgame P. Ehrt S. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 5127-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Diminished levels of SOCS1 mRNA were observed in NOD2−/− BCG-infected BMM, compared with WT controls (Fig. 1E). Both TLR and NOD pathways will trigger activation of NF-κB. Co-incubation of BCG-infected BMM with BAY 11-7082, a pharmacological inhibitor of IκB-α phosphorylation, reduced the relative levels of SOCS1 mRNA (Fig. 1F). As expected, the NF-κB-dependent MCP-1 but not IFN-α mRNA levels were reduced in BAY 11-7082-treated BCG-infected BMM (supplemental Fig. S1B) (data not shown). IFN-α/β are also involved in SOCS1 mRNA expression during infection because IFN-α/βR−/− BMM showed lower levels of SOCS1 compared with WT controls (Fig. 1G). Induction of SOCS1 mRNA after infection with BCG and M. tuberculosis was then compared. Murine BMM and human monocyte-derived macrophages expressed higher titers of SOCS1 mRNA after infection with M. tuberculosis than BCG (Fig. 1, H and I). Next, we investigated whether SOCS1 plays a role in intracellular growth control of BCG. SOCS1−/− and WT BMM were infected with BCG. SOCS1−/− BMM infected at different MOI showed reduced bacterial load (Fig. 2, A–C) compared with WT controls. Accordingly, SOCS1−/− BMM showed lower levels of M. tuberculosis H37Rv or Harlingen than WT cells (Fig. 2, D and E). Similar levels of SOCS1−/− and WT BMM death were recorded during M. tuberculosis infection as measured by release of lactate dehydrogenase into the medium (Fig. 2F). The SOCS1 gene was deleted in macrophages and neutrophils by crossing SOCS1fl/fl mice with LysM-cre SOCS1fl/fl mice. Infected LysM-cre SOCS1fl/fl BMM also showed reduced M. tuberculosis levels compared with SOCS1fl/fl controls (Fig. 2G). SOCS1 mRNA levels in LysM-cre SOCS1fl/fl were 40–300-fold lower than the controls. The remnant expression is probably due to non-macrophage cells in the BMM cultures or to incomplete deletion of SOCS1 in LysM-cre SOCS1fl/fl BMM (supplemental Fig. S2A). Altogether, we confirm that SOCS1-silenced BMM show decreased M. tuberculosis levels. In agreement, increased bacterial growth was observed upon incubation of BCG or M. tuberculosis-infected BMM with Tkip, a 12-mer peptide that, similar to SOCS1, binds and inhibits autophosphorylation of the JAK2 kinase and phosphorylation of the intracellular IFN-γ receptor (44Flowers L.O. Johnson H.M. Mujtaba M.G. Ellis M.R. Haider S.M. Subramaniam P.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 7510-7518Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, H–J). BMM treated with a Tkip-related peptide (alanine substituted by phenylalanine at positions 8 and 11, abrogating thereby binding to JAK2 (45Ahmed C.M. Dabelic R. Waiboci L.W. Jager L.D. Heron L.L. Johnson H.M. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 1402-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)) showed lower bacterial levels than those treated with the native peptide (Fig. 2I). As shown previously (44Flowers L.O. Johnson H.M. Mujtaba M.G. Ellis M.R. Haider S.M. Subramaniam P.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 7510-7518Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), incubation of BMM with Tkip during stimulation with recombinant IFN-γ diminished pSTAT1 levels (data not shown). BCG-infected SOCS1−/− BMM (supplemental Fig. S2, B–D) and BMDC (supplemental Fig. S2, E–G) showed increased levels of IFN-β (supplemental Fig. S2, B and E), IFN-α (supplemental Fig. S2, C and F) and IFN-γ (supplemental Fig. S2, D and G) mRNA as compared with WT BMM. Also, the frequency of IFN-γ-secreting BCG-infected SOCS1−/− BMDC was higher than WT controls (supplemental Fig. S2H). Because IFN-γ controls macrophage activation and mycobacterial growth, we studied whether the improved mycobacterial growth control in SOCS1−/− BMM is IFN-γ-dependent. For this purpose, titers of M. tuberculosis and BCG in IFN-γ−/−/SOCS1−/− and IFN-γ−/− BMM were compared. IFN-γ−/−/SOCS1−/− and IFN-γ−/− BMM showed similar BCG loads (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S2I). Moreover, similar bacterial levels were measured in WT, IFN-γ−/−, and IFN-γ−/−/SOCS1−/− M. tuberculosis-infected BMM, whereas the bacterial load in SOCS1−/− BMM was lower compared with all other groups (Fig. 3B). Altogether, these results indicate that SOCS1 inhibits secretion of IFN-γ that otherwise would mediate a more effective clearance of mycobacteria in macrophages. Whether infection-stimulated SOCS1 expression is IFN-γ-dependent was next investigated. We found that IFN-γ was not required for SOCS1 expression because similar levels of SOCS1 mRNA were detected in BCG- or M. tuberculosis-infected WT and IFN-γR−/−-deficient BMM (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S2J). Infection of BMM with M. tuberculosis led to STAT1 activation as measured by phosphorylation of the transcription factor. Higher levels of pSTAT1 were observed in SOCS1−/− compared with WT BMM when measured 24 and 48 h after infection (Fig. 3D). In agreement with higher levels of STAT1 activation, the titer of the STAT1-regulated CXCL10 and iNOS transcripts were increased in M. tuberculosis-infected SOCS1−/− as compared with respective controls (Fig. 3, E and F). Moreover and similar to observations in BCG-infected BMM, the level of IFN-γ mRNA was augmented in M. tuberculosis-infected SOCS1−/− BMM (Fig. 3H). Both iNOS and IFN-γ mRNA levels were higher in LysM-cre SOCS1fl/fl BMM compared with controls (Fig. 3, G and I), confirming that SOCS1 expression in macrophages hampers IFN-γ expression. Because IL-12 is known to be a main stimulus for IFN-γ secretion, we next investigated whether an M. tuberculosis-induced SOCS1-diminished expression of IL-12 could account for the increased IFN-γ secretion in SOCS1−/− BMM. However, similar mRNA levels of IL-12 p35 and IL-12 p40, constituents of biologically active IL-12 dimers, were found in M. tuberculosis-infected SOCS1−/− and WT BMM (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that the response to but not the secretion of IL-12 could account for the increased IFN-γ release in SOCS1−/− BMM. In order to test this hypothesis, the concentration of IFN-γ mRNA and protein was measured in WT and SOCS1−/− BMM stimulated with recombinant IL-12. SOCS1−/− BMM stimulated with IL-12 contained enhanced IFN-γ mRNA and protein levels compared with WT controls (Fig. 4, C and D). The increased response to IL-12 of SOCS1−/− BMM was associated with higher levels of the IL-12Rβ1 (IL-12 receptor β1) but not IL-12Rβ2 mRNA in both M. tuberculosis-infected and uninfected SOCS1−/− compared with WT BMM (Fig. 4E) (data not shown). The effect of IL-12 neutralization in IFN-γ expression by M. tuberculosis-infected SOCS1−/− BMM was then studied. The addition of anti-IL-12 antibodies reduced IFN-γ mRNA levels in M. tuberculosis-infected SOCS1−/− and WT BMM (Fig. 4F), indicating that IL-12 is required for the enhanced IFN-γ secretion by the infected SOCS1−/− BMM. We then studied if the increased responses to IL-12 of SOCS1−/− BMM are due to uncontrolled IL-12 signaling and/or to increased IL-12R expression. We found that IL-12Rβ1 mRNA accumulation in M. tuberculosis-infected IFN-γ−/− and IFN-γ−/−/SOCS1−/− BMM was simil"

The tail-end cap and its attached tip are the critical components for host recognition and opening of the tail tube for genome exit. In the present work, we determined the cryo-electron microscopic (cryo-EM) structure of a complex formed by the cap protein gp19.1 (Dit) and the N terminus of the downstream protein of gp19.1 in the SPP1 genome, gp211–552 (Tal). This complex assembles two back-to-back stacked gp19.1 ring hexamers, interacting loosely, and two gp211–552 trimers interacting with gp19.1 at both ends of the stack. Remarkably, one gp211–552 trimer displays a “closed” conformation, whereas the second is “open” delineating a central channel. The two conformational states dock nicely into the EM map of the SPP1 cap domain, respectively, before and after DNA release. Moreover, the open/closed conformations of gp19.1-gp211–552 are consistent with the structures of the corresponding proteins in the siphophage p2 baseplate, where the Tal protein (ORF16) attached to the ring of Dit (ORF15) was also found to adopt these two conformations. Therefore, the present contribution allowed us to revisit the SPP1 tail distal-end architectural organization.

IntroductionBacteriophages represent the most abundant group of naturally occurring organisms in the biosphere (1Wommack K.E. Colwell R.R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 69-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). The vast majority of them, ∼96%, consists of an icosahedral capsid and a tail constituting the Caudovirales order (2Ackermann H.W. Arch. Virol. 2007; 152: 227-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Their tail morphology defines three different families (3Ackermann H.W. Res. Microbiol. 2003; 154: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar): Podoviridae, Myoviridae, and Siphoviridae. The tail is a multiprotein nanomachine responsible for specific host cell recognition and efficient phage DNA delivery. It is attached to the portal vertex of the phage icosahedral head, and its distal extremity carries the adsorption apparatus (4Casjens S. Henrix R. Control Mechanisms in dsDNA Bacteriophage Assembly. Plenum Press, New York1988Crossref Google Scholar). Following host cell attachment, a signal is transmitted along the tail to trigger opening of the connector followed by phage DNA ejection from the capsid, through the tail tube, to reach the bacterial cytoplasm (5Molineux I.J. Virology. 2006; 344: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).The combination of x-ray crystallography and EM has proven to be the method of choice to characterize locations and interactions of bacteriophage tail proteins, thus making it possible to determine the cascade of molecular events sustaining viral infection.

These two components, belonging to the adsorption apparatus, have been demonstrated to be essential both during tail morphogenesis and for the infection mechanism (17McGrath S. Neve H. Seegers J.F. Eijlander R. Vegge C.S. Brøndsted L. Heller K.J. Fitzgerald G.F. Vogensen F.K. van Sinderen D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3972-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Vegge C.S. Brøndsted L.

Biol. 1975; 91: 257-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The structures of Dit and Tal in phage p2 (ORF15 and ORF16, respectively) have been determined by x-ray crystallography (11Sciara G. Bebeacua C. Bron P. Tremblay D. Ortiz-Lombardia M. Lichière J. van Heel M. Campanacci V. Moineau S. Cambillau C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 6852-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). They form the inner part of the baseplate, and their structures reveal dramatic conformational changes probably involved in the infection mechanism (11Sciara G. Bebeacua C. Bron P. Tremblay D. Ortiz-Lombardia M. Lichière J. van Heel M. Campanacci V. Moineau S. Cambillau C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 6852-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Based on the EM three-dimensional reconstruction of the SPP1 tail, gp19.1 (Dit) and gp21 (Tal) have been attributed to the region of the tail tip proximal to the tail cap. The cap is localized at the tail tube end opposite to the viral capsid (10Plisson C. White H.E. Auzat I. Zafarani A. São-José C. Lhuillier S. Tavares P. Orlova E.V. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3720-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the recently reported crystal structure of gp19.1, and its docking into the EM maps, led to the reassignment of gp19.1 to the cap structure (22Veesler D. Robin G. Lichière J. Auzat I. Tavares P. Bron P. Campanacci V. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36666-36673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This finding highlighted the need for a precise localization and study of the interactions between the SPP1 tail proteins composing the adsorption apparatus. Enhancing our knowledge of the protein mapping along the tail is essential to get a comprehensive view of this model phage and to decipher the mechanisms underlying host infection and virion assembly. In the current work, we have investigated the complex formed by SPP1 gp19.1 and gp211–552 proteins using light scattering and mass spectrometry (MS) and determined its structure by cryo-EM. This study led to reassignment of the SPP1 tail cap architectural organization. It also suggests a closed to open conformational switch in Tal proteins acting as a trigger, common to Gram-positive-infecting siphophages, to initiate the domino-like cascade signaling pathway, thus culminating in viral DNA ejection (10Plisson C. White H.E. Auzat I. Zafarani A. São-José C. Lhuillier S. Tavares P. Orlova E.V. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3720-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONPresent knowledge of the SPP1 tail architecture relies to a large extent on a previous EM study and its structural model derived from volume interpretation of EM densities, structure prediction, and sequence analysis (10Plisson C. White H.E. Auzat I. Zafarani A. São-José C. Lhuillier S. Tavares P. Orlova E.V. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3720-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Comparison between tail structures before and after DNA ejection led to the hypothesis that a firing signal generated at the onset of infection is propagated from the distal to the capsid proximal tail extremity as a domino-like cascade along the tail tube (10Plisson C. White H.E. Auzat I. Zafarani A. São-José C. Lhuillier S. Tavares P. Orlova E.V. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3720-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The signal targets the head-to-tail connector whose opening leads to DNA release from the viral capsid through the tail tube to exit the phage particle (37Lhuillier S. Gallopin M. Gilquin B. Brasilès S. Lancelot N. Letellier G. Gilles M. Dethan G. Orlova E.V. Couprie J. Tavares P. Zinn-Justin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8507-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These events are triggered by interaction of the SPP1 tail extremity, composed cap that closes the tail tube and the tip, with the host receptor YueB. Following the recent re-positioning of gp19.1 to the cap structure (22Veesler D. Robin G. Lichière J. Auzat I. Tavares P. Bron P. Campanacci V. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36666-36673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we have investigated further the organization of this tail region, which appears critical for initiating signaling that is propagated along the MTP helical tube lattice. Bioinformatics showed that gp19.1 and the N terminus of gp21 share sequence homology and that their coding genes follow each other in the phage genome suggesting structural conservation and cross-talk between the two proteins (22Veesler D. Robin G. Lichière J. Auzat I. Tavares P. Bron P. Campanacci V. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36666-36673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Consequently, we decided to investigate the structural organization of the putative complex formed by gp19.1 and gp21. Considering the high level of sequence conservation observed for Tal N-terminal moieties among Siphoviridae, we recombinantly expressed and purified the N-terminal half of gp21, gp211–552, and demonstrated that it interacts with Dit.Our light scattering and non-covalent MS results established that one Dit dodecamer was associated with six gp211–552 subunits. Because gp19.1 associates as two back-to-back hexamers in solution, we expected that one gp211–552 trimer would associate with each Dit face. These results were subsequently corroborated by the EM structural study of the gp19.1-gp211–552 complex.Similarly to some other elongated complexes (38Chen S. Roseman A.M. Hunter A.S. Wood S.P. Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. Saibil H.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 39Harris J.R. Plückthun A. Zahn R. J. Struct. Biol. 1994; 112: 216-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), gp19.1-gp211–552 displays two preferential views (top and side views) that were processed separately. The structural analysis of frozen-hydrated gp19.1-gp211–552 complexes by EM and image processing yielded two major results. Firstly, gp19.1-gp211–552 complexes consist of two structurally independent sub-complexes composed of a gp19.1 hexamer and a gp211–552 trimer. Each sub-complex, which corresponds to the cap structure in SPP1 phage particles (Fig. 2), loosely associates to another sub-complex through interactions between the narrower rings of gp19.1 hexamers (Fig. 1, C and D). Secondly, the structure is asymmetric, a result of the gp211–552 trimers conformation that is open in one sub-complex and closed in the other. The alternating states of gp211–552 trimers in the same complex require a cross-talk mediated through the gp19.1 hexamers, but its structural basis cannot be established at the resolution of our reconstruction. The property of gp211–552 to adopt a closed and an open state are outstandingly reminiscent of the SPP1 tail cap before and after DNA ejection (10Plisson C. White H.E. Auzat I. Zafarani A. São-José C. Lhuillier S. Tavares P. Orlova E.V. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3720-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and the p2 ORF16 closed and open structures (11Sciara G. Bebeacua C. Bron P. Tremblay D. Ortiz-Lombardia M. Lichière J. van Heel M. Campanacci V. Moineau S. Cambillau C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 6852-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These data clearly show that the SPP1 tail cap is formed by a gp19.1-gp21 complex that accounts for the transition from 6- to 3-fold symmetry in the tail structure. It also argues for a common structural organization of the cap among Siphoviridae phages. Moreover, the size of the SPP1 full-length gp21 is twice as much as that of the recombinant gp211–552 protein. According to the fit presented in Fig. 4A, the gp21 C-terminal region predicted structure (β-helix) would account for the proximal part of the SPP1 tail tip. This topology of gp21 is consistent with immunoelectron microscopy experiments. 4I. Vinga, C. Baptista, I. Auzat, I. Petipas, R. Lurz, P. Tavares, M. A. Santos, and C. Sao-Jose, submitted for publication. Otherwise, the SPP1 tip distal EM density remains unassigned. This volume might result from the assembly of several small ORFs following the gp21 tail fiber coding sequence in the SPP1 genome (gp22, gp23, gp23.1, gp24, and gp24.1). However, we previously solved the crystal structures of two of these (gp23.1 and gp22) (41Veesler D. Blangy S. Lichière J. Ortiz-Lombardía M. Tavares P. Campanacci V. Cambillau C. Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 1812-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 42Veesler D. Blangy S. Spinelli S. Tavares P. Campanacci V. Cambillau C. Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and the poor quality of their fit in the tip reconstruction suggested that they are not located in this region of the virion.This structural organization raised the questions: 1) the possible fate of gp21 during DNA ejection, because the tip is not observed anymore upon interaction with YueB (10Plisson C. White H.E. Auzat I. Zafarani A. São-José C. Lhuillier S. Tavares P. Orlova E.V. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3720-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and 2) notably, why the SPP1 cap structure after DNA ejection (10Plisson C. White H.E. Auzat I. Zafarani A. São-José C. Lhuillier S. Tavares P. Orlova E.V. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3720-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) did not reveal the presence of additional densities corresponding to the second half of gp21 sequence. The two possible explanations are that either gp21 is cleaved in the virion and the C-terminal domain is released with the tail tip upon receptor binding, or the second domain of gp21 is linked to the N terminus domain by a flexible hinge and becomes disorganized upon SPP1 interaction with YueB, and consequently its density is averaged out in the map of SPP1 tail cap.To address the hypothesis of a putative gp21 cleavage, as is the case in Tuc2009 and TP901-1 Tal proteins (19Vegge C.S. Brøndsted L. Neve H. McGrath S. van Sinderen D. Vogensen F.K. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4187-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 43Kenny J.G. McGrath S. Fitzgerald G.F. van Sinderen D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3480-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 44Brøndsted L. Pedersen M. Hammer K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 5626-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we carried out Western blots of SPP1 particles before and after challenge with the receptor ectodomain YueB780. Detection with antibodies raised either against the gp21 N or C termini demonstrated that the full-length protein remains intact after DNA ejection. In addition, the cryo-EM images of SPP1 phages incubated with YueB780 show irregular SPP1 tail ends whose appearance varies between different viral particles. The extra densities observed are attributed to the disorganized gp21 C terminus, YueB780, and eventually to other tail tip components. The resulting model is that the gp21 N terminus forms the cap bottom structure that is connected by a gp21 flexible hinge to the C terminus that accounts for the tail tip proximal region.Therefore, interaction with YueB leads to opening of the gp21 N terminus region and concomitant disassembly of the C terminus organization. The challenge is now to understand how the sturdy β-helix fold proposed for the gp21 terminus is disassembled during this process.The conserved sequences of Tal-like proteins, including T4 gp27 (PDB ID 1K28), Mu gp44 (PDB ID 1WRU), p2 ORF16 (PDB ID 2WZP and 2X53), Shewanella oneidensis prophage MuSO2 Q8EDP4 (PDB ID 3CDD), L. monocytogenes prophage EGD-e gp18 (PDB entry 3GS9), and the Escherichia coli c3393 Type 6 secretion system protein (2P5Z) concern the first 400 residues. Among them, it was shown that ORF16, the Tal protein of phage p2, could adopt either a closed or open conformation (11Sciara G. Bebeacua C. Bron P. Tremblay D. Ortiz-Lombardia M. Lichière J. van Heel M. Campanacci V. Moineau S. Cambillau C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 6852-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The docking of the p2 ORF15-ORF16 complex into our cryo-EM map of the gp19.1-gp211–552 open and closed states showed that the opening of Tal proteins is a common feature in siphophages p2 and SPP1 leading to formation of a channel for DNA release. In the case of the p2 baseplate, the ORF16 open conformation was triggered by addition of Ca2+ ions that is also correlated with a 200° rotation downward of the six receptor-binding protein (RBP) that are anchored in ORF15. Interestingly, Ca2+ ions stabilize also the gp211–552 open conformation (supplemental Fig. S3). Millimolar amounts of Ca2+ favor SPP1 infection in vivo (45Santos M.A. De Lencastre H. Archer L.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1984; 65: 2067-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) but are not necessary to trigger DNA ejection in vitro (36São-José C. Lhuillier S. Lurz R. Melki R. Lepault J. Santos M.A. Tavares P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11464-11470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) rendering it difficult to assess their biological importance for gp21 biological function at present.In an evolutionary context, several SPP1 tail components show significant sequence and/or structural similarities to equivalent proteins from lactococcal phages Tuc2009, TP901-1, and p2. Hence, we recently showed that the central part of the TP901-1 baseplate is formed by Dit and Tal proteins (18Bebeacua C. Bron P. Lai L. Vegge C.S. Brøndsted L. Spinelli S. Campanacci V. Veesler D. van Heel M. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 39079-39086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It becomes now apparent that Siphoviridae phages share a common core at the tail distal extremity composed of MTP, Dit, and Tal proteins. However, Siphoviridae exhibit different types of distal tail architectures that seem to be related to the nature of the host recognition process and affinity between partners. Thus, phages TP901-1 or p2, which have a low avidity toward saccharidic receptors, have evolved by developing a strategy related to the presence of a high number of RBPs, 18 and 54 for phage p2 and TP901-1, respectively. On the contrary, SPP1 phage, which recognizes a proteinaceous receptor with a high affinity, displays an elongated tail tip (36São-José C. Lhuillier S. Lurz R. Melki R. Lepault J. Santos M.A. Tavares P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11464-11470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In phage p2, the large baseplate conformational changes observed might be transmitted to the first MTP ring, and, by a domino-like concerted effect, to all other MTP rings along the tail, finally resulting in connector opening and DNA release. However, in the case of TP901, RBPs are immediately available to bind to host receptors (18Bebeacua C. Bron P. Lai L. Vegge C.S. Brøndsted L. Spinelli S. Campanacci V. Veesler D. van Heel M. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 39079-39086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and large conformational changes do not appear to be involved for initiating infection. Similarly, the SPP1 elongated tail tips that do not possess RBPs do not seem to be subjected to large conformational changes induced by receptor binding. Thus, the initiation of signal transmission to the first MTP ring might be more subtle than the direct consequence of RBPs displacement.The emerging picture is that the Siphoviridae tail end is built around a conserved core of Dit and Tal that corresponds to the SPP1 cap structure. This platform serves to dock RBPs, which can be assembled in baseplate structures gathering multiple high avidity saccharidic receptor binders (e.g. p2 and TP901-1) and/or single tips that bind a proteinaceous receptor with high affinity (e.g. SPP1). The platform provides also the attachment site for the MTP and the tape measure protein that builds the tail tube. We propose that interaction of RBPs with host receptors triggers a signal converging to the Dit platform. The signal switches Tal to its open conformation and initiates the domino-like cascade in the first ring of MTP hexamers that propagates along the helical tail to cause DNA ejection (10Plisson C.

Rev. 2000; 64: 69-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). The vast majority of them, ∼96%, consists of an icosahedral capsid and a tail constituting the Caudovirales order (2Ackermann H.W. Arch. Virol. 2007; 152: 227-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Their tail morphology defines three different families (3Ackermann H.W. Res. Microbiol. 2003; 154: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar): Podoviridae, Myoviridae, and Siphoviridae. The tail is a multiprotein nanomachine responsible for specific host cell recognition and efficient phage DNA delivery. It is attached to the portal vertex of the phage icosahedral head, and its distal extremity carries the adsorption apparatus (4Casjens S. Henrix R. Control Mechanisms in dsDNA Bacteriophage Assembly. Plenum Press, New York1988Crossref Google Scholar). Following host cell attachment, a signal is transmitted along the tail to trigger opening of the connector followed by phage DNA ejection from the capsid, through the tail tube, to reach the bacterial cytoplasm (5Molineux I.J.

https://openalex.org/W2038363827,"One major signaling method employed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, is through reversible phosphorylation of proteins mediated by protein kinases and phosphatases. This study concerns one of these enzymes, the serine/threonine protein kinase PknF, that is encoded in an operon with Rv1747, an ABC transporter that is necessary for growth of M. tuberculosis in vivo and contains two forkhead-associated (FHA) domains. FHA domains are phosphopeptide recognition motifs that specifically recognize phosphothreonine-containing epitopes. Experiments to determine how PknF regulates the function of Rv1747 demonstrated that phosphorylation occurs on two specific threonine residues, Thr-150 and Thr-208. To determine the in vivo consequences of phosphorylation, infection experiments were performed in bone marrow-derived macrophages and in mice using threonine-to-alanine mutants of Rv1747 that prevent specific phosphorylation and revealed that phosphorylation positively modulates Rv1747 function in vivo. The role of the FHA domains in this regulation was further demonstrated by isothermal titration calorimetry, using peptides containing both phosphothreonine residues. FHA-1 domain mutation resulted in attenuation in macrophages highlighting the critical role of this domain in Rv1747 function. A mutant deleted for pknF did not, however, have a growth phenotype in an infection, suggesting that other kinases can fulfill its role when it is absent. This study provides the first information on the molecular mechanism(s) regulating Rv1747 through PknF-dependent phosphorylation but also indicates that phosphorylation activates Rv1747, which may have important consequences in regulating growth of M. tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W1994701211,"The visual process in the vertebrate eye requires high amounts of metabolic energy and thus oxygen. Oxygen supply of the avian retina is a challenging task because birds have large eyes, thick retinae, and high metabolic rates but neither deep retinal nor superficial capillaries. Respiratory proteins such as myoglobin may enhance oxygen supply to certain tissues, and thus the mammalian retina harbors high amounts of neuroglobin. Globin E (GbE) was recently identified as an eye-specific globin of chicken (Gallus gallus). Orthologous GbE genes were found in zebra finch and turkey genomes but appear to be absent in non-avian vertebrate classes. Analyses of globin phylogeny and gene synteny showed an ancient origin of GbE but did not help to assign it to any specific globin type. We show that the photoreceptor cells of the chicken retina have a high level of GbE protein, which accumulates to ∼10 μm in the total eye. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed an ∼50,000-fold higher level of GbE mRNA in the eye than in the brain. Spectroscopic analysis and ligand binding kinetics of recombinant chicken GbE reveal a penta-coordinated globin with an oxygen affinity of P50 = 5.8 torrs at 25 °C and 15 torrs at 41 °C.

Analyses of globin phylogeny and gene synteny showed an ancient origin of GbE but did not help to assign it to any specific globin type. We show that the photoreceptor cells of the chicken retina have a high level of GbE protein, which accumulates to ∼10 μm in the total eye. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed an ∼50,000-fold higher level of GbE mRNA in the eye than in the brain. Spectroscopic analysis and ligand binding kinetics of recombinant chicken GbE reveal a penta-coordinated globin with an oxygen affinity of P50 = 5.8 torrs at 25 °C and 15 torrs at 41 °C. Together these data suggest that GbE helps to sustain oxygen supply to the avian retina. IntroductionGlobins constitute a structurally conserved family of heme proteins with the ability to reversibly bind molecular oxygen (O2). A typical globin chain comprises about 140–150 amino acids and includes an iron porphyrin. Until recently, only two types of globins were known in vertebrates (i.e. fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals). Hemoglobin (Hb) 3The abbreviations used are: HbhemoglobinMbmyoglobinNgbneuroglobinCygbcytoglobinGbEeye-specific globinGbXglobin XdNnon-synonymous substitutiondSsynonymous substitution. is certainly the best known globin, which is present in the erythrocytes of the blood and serves for the transport of O2 (1Dickerson A.E. Greis I. Hemoglobin: Structure, Function, Evolution, and Pathology. Benjamin-Cummings Publishing Company, Inc., Menlo Park, CA1983Google Scholar). Hb is a heterotetrameric protein that is composed of two α- and two β-type chains. Myoglobin (Mb) is a monomeric protein located in the myocytes of the heart and the skeletal muscles, which enhances oxygen supply by facilitating diffusion of O2 to the mitochondria or O2 storage (2Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 2011-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Mb may also be instrumental for decomposition of nitric oxide (NO) (2Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 2011-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar).Within the past 10 years, additional globin types have been identified in jawed vertebrates (Gnathostomata). Neuroglobin (Ngb) essentially resides in the central and peripheral nervous system (3Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T.

Ebner B. Gerlach F. Fuchs C. Hankeln T. IUBMB Life. 2004; 56: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), other globins appear to be restricted to certain vertebrate taxa. Globin X (GbX) is only present in fishes and amphibians (13Fuchs C. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2006; 112: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Roesner A. Fuchs C. Hankeln T. Burmester T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). GbX is distantly related to Ngb but is bound to the cell membrane, where it may carry out a protective function. 4M. Blank, J. Wollberg, F. Gerlach, K. Reimann, A. Roesner, T. Hankeln, A. Fago, R. E. Weber, and T. Burmester, manuscript submitted. Globin Y shows a broad expression pattern in Xenopus tissues (13Fuchs C. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2006; 112: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but there is no information about its physiological role.In chicken, an additional globin type was identified. It appears to be preferentially expressed in the eye and therefore has been referred to as eye globin or GbE (15Kugelstadt D. Haberkamp M. Hankeln T. Burmester T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The presence of a putatively respiratory protein in the chicken eye is of particular interest because the function of the bird eye is constrained by two conflicting demands; on the one hand, the blood vessels should not obstruct the optical path, and on the other hand, a high metabolic rate of the retina requires high O2 supply and thus good vascular perfusion (16Pettigrew J.D. Wallman J. Wildsoet C.F. Nature. 1990; 343: 362-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Birds have a high metabolic rate, large eyes, and thick retinae but have an avascular retina without deep retinal and superficial capillaries. Therefore, additional O2 is supplied to the bird retina by the pecten oculi, a unique vascular structure extending into the vitreous chamber (16Pettigrew J.D. Wallman J. Wildsoet C.F. Nature. 1990; 343: 362-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).To evaluate the possible role of GbE in O2 supply to the avian retina, we carried out a detailed characterization of chicken GbE, which includes in silico analyses of the gene, molecular, and histological characterization of expression patterns, as well as biochemical analyses of recombinant GbE. Together these data suggest that GbE may actually have an Mb-like role in O2 supply of the bird photoreceptor cells.DISCUSSIONGbE is unique among vertebrates because it is specifically expressed in the eye (Fig. 2). The essentially eye-specific expression of GbE was further confirmed by five expressed sequence tags (DR425234, DR427888, DR430010, DR430941, CD527046) that derive from an eye-specific cDNA library of 15-day chicken embryos. A single additional GbE expressed sequence tag derives from a brain library (CN224774). An eye-specific globin was identified in the nematode Mermis nigrescens, which exhibits a shadowing function for phototaxis (31Burr A.H. Hunt P. Wagar D.R. Dewilde S. Blaxter M.L. Vanfleteren J.R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4810-4815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The anatomy and function of the avian eye render such function as highly unlikely for GbE, which may rather function as a typical Mb in O2 supply.Emergence and Evolution of Globin EThe evolution of a protein may provide clues to its function. GbE appears to be restricted to birds because no ortholog could be identified in the sequences from any other vertebrate class. Surprisingly, no GbE was detected in the genome of Anolis. However, currently we cannot decide whether this failure is due to the actual absence of GbE in reptiles or the fragmentary nature of the available genomic sequences from A. carolinensis. Therefore, GbE may have evolved in the avian, sauropsid, or an earlier lineage. Phylogenetic analyses tentatively suggest an association of GbE with either the Cygb (15Kugelstadt D. Haberkamp M. Hankeln T. Burmester T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or the Mb (32Hoffmann F.G. Opazo J.C. Storz J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 14274-14279Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) clades, but the support for either grouping was poor. A relationship of GbE and Cygb is tentatively supported by a unique insertion of three amino acids (FLG) at the EF corner (Fig. 1).The position in the genome and gene synteny may provide additional information about globin evolution (33Gillemans N. McMorrow T. Tewari R. Wai A.W. Burgtorf C. Drabek D. Ventress N. Langeveld A. Higgs D. Tan-Un K. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Blood. 2003; 101: 2842-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 34Wystub S. Ebner B. Fuchs C. Weich B. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2004; 105: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this context, LUC2L is the only informative gene (13Fuchs C. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2006; 112: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Patel V.S. Cooper S.J. Deakin J.E. Fulton B. Graves T. Warren W.C. Wilson R.K. Graves J.A. BMC Biol. 2008; 6: 34Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Paralogous LUC2L genes are located in head-to-head orientation adjacent to avian GbE, avian and human HbA, and fish Mb. Although this syntenic position does not support any particular relationship of GbE, it suggests an early origin of this gene. In any case, GbE emerged from the Mb/Cygb globin lineage before the radiation of Gnathostomata, at least ∼420 million years ago (28Benton M.J. Donoghue P.C. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 26-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Thus GbE must have been independently lost in fishes, amphibians, and mammals. This may be due to the emergence of vascularized retinae.The evolutionary rate of GbE protein (0.43 ± 0.15 × 10−9 amino acid substitutions per site per year) is somewhat faster than the rates of Ngb and Cygb (∼0.3 × 10−9) but slower than those of Hb and Mb (∼1 × 10−9) (12Burmester T. Haberkamp M. Mitz S. Roesner A. Schmidt M. Ebner B. Gerlach F. Fuchs C. Hankeln T. IUBMB Life. 2004; 56: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Wystub S. Ebner B. Fuchs C. Weich B. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2004; 105: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), suggesting a rather conserved gene. Levels of selective constraint may also be measured by dS/dN ratios, which are highly variable among vertebrate globins (34Wystub S. Ebner B. Fuchs C. Weich B. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2004; 105: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Strong selective pressure on a coding region favors synonymous substitutions (dS) over non-synonymous substitutions (dN). For GbE, we calculated a ds/dn ratio of 7.41–14.03, which was slightly higher than that of mammalian Mb (7.29) and indicates purifying selection (34Wystub S. Ebner B. Fuchs C. Weich B. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2004; 105: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Otherwise, only mammalian Ngb and Cygb have dS/dN ratios greater than 10. Thus GbE appears to be a conserved gene, suggesting an important function.A Respiratory Function of Globin EThe recently identified “novel” vertebrate globins Ngb, Cygb, and GbX share the common characteristics of being hexa-coordinated in the deoxygenated form, which is characterized by two peaks in the visible spectrum around 530 and 560 nm (Fig. 4B) (25Uzan J.

Dewilde S. Green B.N. Pesce A. Uzan J. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Bolognesi M. Moens L. Marden M.C. J. Biol.

Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). By contrast, the absorption spectrum and ligand binding kinetics show that GbE is a typical penta-coordinated globin, similar to Mb and Hb (Fig. 4B and Table 1). Although the function of vertebrate hexa-coordinated globins is still poorly understood, there is no doubt that Hb and Mb function in O2 delivery. Thus, by analogy, an Mb-like role may be inferred for GbE. The measured O2 affinity of chicken GbE (P50 = 5.8 torrs) is lower than that of chicken Mb (P50 = 3.6 torrs) (36Enoki Y. Ohga Y. Kawase M. Nakatani A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 789: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) but consistent with a function of GbE in O2 supply. The autoxidation rate is consistent with a respiratory function of GbE, too.The Possible Role of Globin E in the Avian RetinaTo support its visual function, the vertebrate retina consumes large amounts of O2. An adequate cellular oxygen environment is crucial for the appropriate function of retinal cells. The vascular retina of most mammals has a dual blood supply in which the outer retina is nourished by choroidal blood vessels that lie immediately behind the pigment epithelium. The inner retina is supported by the deep capillary network located in the outer plexiform layer and the superficial capillaries adjacent to the ganglion cell layer (37Osborne N.N. Casson R.J. Wood J.P. Chidlow G. Graham M. Melena J. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2004; 23: 91-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 38Yu D.Y. Cringle S.J. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 175-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). However, birds possess an avascular retina, in which the deep retinal and superficial capillaries are essentially absent. O2 is delivered by the choroidal vascular bed and the pecten, a vascular structure extending from the retina into the posterior chamber (16Pettigrew J.D. Wallman J. Wildsoet C.F. Nature. 1990; 343: 362-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 39Vasilescu J. Guo X. Kast J. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 3845-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).No GbE was detected in the pecten structure of the chicken eye (not shown). By contrast, a high concentration of GbE was found in the neuronal retina, which accumulates to 1.6 μg/mg of total eye protein (about 10 μm GbE). Given the fact that most of the protein resides in the vitreous chamber, local GbE concentration within the retina is certainly much higher and well within the range of a typical Mb (40Wittenberg J.B. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1992; 13: 60-85Google Scholar, 41Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 217-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).The high concentration of Ngb in the rodent retina led to the suggestion that this globin increases the availability of O2 for the respiratory chain (6Bentmann A. Schmidt M. Reuss S. Wolfrum U. Hankeln T. Burmester T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20660-20665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8Schmidt M. Giessl A. Laufs T. Hankeln T. Wolfrum U. Burmester T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1932-1935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In mouse, rat, and Guinea pig, Ngb is associated with the mitochondria and thus cellular respiration. Total concentration of Ngb in the mouse retina was estimated to be ∼100–200 μm. Because no antibody is available that specifically recognizes chicken Ngb, we could not determine Ngb protein concentration in chicken. However, in the chicken eye, Ngb mRNA levels are about 100-fold lower than that of GbE (Fig. 2A), suggesting that Ngb does not play a major role in O2 supply in this tissue.GbE is mainly localized in the photoreceptor cells, which are in charge for visual perception. High ATP amounts are consumed by the photoreceptor cells for the maintenance of the dark current, for the fast turnover of photosensitive membranes, or for the phototransduction process itself (42Pugh Jr., E.N. Lamb T. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh Jr., E.N. Molecular Mechanisms of Visual Transduction. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2000: 183-255Google Scholar). On the other hand, vascularization of the avian retina is poor. It is therefore tempting to assume that GbE enhances O2 supply to the photoreceptor cells, thereby supporting the visual process in the bird eye. However, we cannot formally exclude other functions of GbE, such as protection from reactive oxygen species or a redox reaction, which may be induced by light in the outer segments of the photoreceptor cells (43Organisciak D.T. Wang H.M. Xie A. Reeves D.S. Donoso L.A. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1989; 314: 493-512PubMed Google Scholar, 44Penn J.S. Naash M.I. Anderson R.E. Exp.

https://openalex.org/W2005550386,"The dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) plays a crucial role in the regulation of diverse key physiological functions, including motor control, reward, learning, and memory. This receptor is present in vivo in two isoforms, D2L and D2S, generated from the same gene by alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Each isoform has a specific role in vivo, underlining the importance of a strict control of its synthesis, yet the molecular mechanism modulating alternative D2R pre-mRNA splicing has not been completely elucidated. Here, we identify heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M (hnRNP M) as a key molecule controlling D2R splicing. We show that binding of hnRNP M to exon 6 inhibited the inclusion of this exon in the mRNA. Importantly, the splicing factor Nova-1 counteracted hnRNP M effects on D2R pre-mRNA splicing. Indeed, mutations of the putative Nova-1-binding site on exon 6 disrupted Nova-1 RNA assembly and diminished the inhibitory effect of Nova-1 on hnRNP M-dependent exon 6 exclusion. These results identify Nova-1 and hnRNP M as D2R pre-mRNA-binding proteins and show their antagonistic role in the alternative splicing of D2R pre-mRNA."

Genetic disruption of selenoprotein biosynthesis had no effect on lifespan and oxidative stress resistance of Drosophila melanogaster. In the current study, fruit flies with knock-out of the selenocysteine-specific elongation factor were metabolically labeled with 75Se; they did not incorporate selenium into proteins and had the same lifespan on a chemically defined diet with or without selenium supplementation. These flies were, however, more susceptible to starvation than controls, and this effect could be ascribed to the function of selenoprotein K. We further expressed mouse methionine sulfoxide reductase B1 (MsrB1), a selenoenzyme that catalyzes the reduction of oxidized methionine residues and has protein repair function, in the whole body or the nervous system of fruit flies. This exogenous selenoprotein could only be expressed when the Drosophila selenocysteine insertion sequence element was used, whereas the corresponding mouse element did not support selenoprotein synthesis. Ectopic expression of MsrB1 in the nervous system led to an increase in the resistance against oxidative stress and starvation, but did not affect lifespan and reproduction, whereas ubiquitous MsrB1 expression had no effect. Dietary selenium did not influence lifespan of MsrB1-expressing flies. Thus, in contrast to vertebrates, fruit flies preserve only three selenoproteins, which are not essential and play a role only under certain stress conditions, thereby limiting the use of the micronutrient selenium by these organisms.

The majority of selenoproteins with known type of catalytic activity act as oxidoreductases that use Sec directly for catalysis and maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis. The number of selenoproteins in eukaryotic organisms varies significantly. Higher plants and fungi lack selenoprotein genes, whereas there are many such genes in algae and vertebrates, e.g. 10–57 in algae, 30–37 in fish, and 23–25 in mammals (1Lobanov A.V. Hatfield D.L.

Remarkably, insects possess cysteine-containing homologs or lack all essential mammalian selenoproteins, e.g. thioredoxin reductases and glutathione peroxidases. Moreover, recent studies identified five species of selenoproteinless insects, including the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (5Lobanov A.V. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N.

The Sec incorporation machinery is conserved across eukaryotes. Sec is encoded by the UGA codon that usually serves as a termination signal.

The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has 3 selenoproteins: selenophosphate synthetase 2 (dSPS2), selenoprotein H (dSelH, also known as BthD), and selenoprotein K (dSelK, also known as G-rich) (15Hirosawa-Takamori M.

The SPS2 function (synthesis of monoselenophosphate from selenide) is essential for Sec biosynthesis and expression of selenoproteins (19Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Mix H. Zhang Y. Saira K. Glass R.S.

Mammalian SelH is a nuclear protein that has a thioredoxin-like fold and possesses glutathione peroxidase activity in vitro (21Novoselov S.V. Kryukov G.V. Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11960-11968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This protein up-regulates transcription of genes involved in glutathione synthesis and phase II detoxification (22Panee J. Stoytcheva Z.R. Liu W. Berry M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23759-23765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, knockdown of the dSelH gene using RNAi technology significantly reduced embryonic viability and caused a decrease in total antioxidant status in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells (23Morozova N. Forry E.P. Shahid E. Zavacki A.M. Harney J.W. Kraytsberg Y. Berry M.J. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, mutant fruit flies with knock-out of the Sec-specific translational elongation factor dEFsec (24Hirosawa-Takamori M. Chung H.R. Jäckle H. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which failed to decode the UGA codon as a codon for Sec insertion, were viable, fertile, and had the same mean lifespan and oxidative stress resistance as controls (24Hirosawa-Takamori M. Chung H.R. Jäckle H. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is possible that the phenotypes observed with RNAi against dSelH resulted from off-target effects of siRNA. Drosophila dSelK is a Golgi-resident membrane protein (25Chen C.L. Shim M.S. Chung J. Yoo H.S. Ha J.M. Kim J.Y. Choi J. Zang S.L. Hou X. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Lee B.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 1296-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, two recent studies indicate that mammalian SelK is an ER-resident transmembrane protein (26Du S. Zhou J. Jia Y. Huang K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 502: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27Verma S. Hoffmann F.W. Kumar M. Huang Z. Roe K. Nguyen-Wu E. Hashimoto A.S. Hoffmann P.R. J.

Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 502: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and in immune response (27Verma S. Hoffmann F.W. Kumar M. Huang Z. Roe K. Nguyen-Wu E. Hashimoto A.S. Hoffmann P.R. J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 2127-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To summarize, the specific biological functions of SelH and SelK are not known in Drosophila or in mammals. In this regard, fruit flies offer a useful system to study the functions of these selenoproteins. Many mammalian selenoproteins are involved in regulation of cell redox homeostasis and could, directly or indirectly, be involved in regulation of longevity. However, there are no published data on the link between overexpression of redox selenoproteins and aging in animals. The fruit fly is a very convenient model organism for such study. Here, we chose a mouse selenoprotein, methionine sulfoxide reductase B1 (MsrB1, also known as SelR or SelX), to characterize a possible connection between overexpression of a selenoenzyme, oxidative stress resistance, and longevity. MsrB1 is a member of an Msr class of proteins that are responsible for the reduction of methionine sulfoxides to methionine in proteins (for review, see Refs. 28Weissbach H. Resnick L. Brot N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 29Moskovitz J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 30Kim H.Y. Gladyshev V.N. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar and references therein). Proposed functions of Msrs include protection of cells from oxidative stress through reversible reduction of methionine sulfoxide and repair of oxidatively damaged proteins to preserve their functions (31Levine R.L. Mosoni L. Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 15036-15040Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 32Oien D.B. Moskovitz J. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2008; 80: 93-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Msrs that act on oxidized proteins are classified with respect to their substrate specificity into two types: MsrA that is specific for the reduction of methionine-S-sulfoxide, and MsrB that catalyzes the reduction of methionine-R-sulfoxide. Mammals have one MsrA and three MsrB isozymes, which are targeted to different cellular compartments. MsrB1 is located in the nucleus and cytosol. This protein is remarkable in that it contains an active site Sec in place of cysteine, a common catalytic group for all Msrs (28Weissbach H. Resnick L. Brot N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 29Moskovitz J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 30Kim H.Y. Gladyshev V.N. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Numerous studies provided evidence for an important role of Msrs in aging. It is generally agreed that knock-out of the msrA gene results in accumulation of oxidized and modified proteins (33Oien D. Moskovitz J. Amino Acids. 2007; 32: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), increased sensitivity to oxidative stress (34Minniti A.N. Cataldo R. Trigo C. Vasquez L. Mujica P. Leighton F.

FASEB J. 2009; 23: 3601-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast, MsrA overexpression led to protection against oxidative stress and increased longevity in yeast and fruit flies (38Moskovitz J. Flescher E. Berlett B.S. Azare J. Poston J.M.

The effect of MsrB knock-out/overexpression on aging in yeast and flies is less pronounced (37Koc A. Gasch A.P. Rutherford J.C. Kim H.Y. Gladyshev V.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 7999-8004Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 41Shchedrina V.A. Vorbrüggen G. Lee B.C. Kim H.Y. Kabil H. Harshman L.G. Gladyshev V.N. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2009; 130: 429-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For example, expression of host MsrA or GFP-fused bovine MsrA in the nervous system increased the median lifespan of Drosophila by ∼20 (39Chung H. Kim A.K. Jung S.A. Kim S.W. Yu K. Lee J.H. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 3609-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or 70% (40Ruan H. Tang X.D. Chen M.L. Joiner M.L. Sun G. Brot N. Weissbach H. Heinemann S.H. Iverson L. Wu C.F. Hoshi T. Chen M.L. Joiner M.A. Heinemann S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2748-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), respectively. However, overexpression of host MsrB or mouse MsrB2 in the nervous system had no substantial effect on Drosophila lifespan (41Shchedrina V.A. Vorbrüggen G. Lee B.C. Kim H.Y. Kabil H. Harshman L.G. Gladyshev V.N. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2009; 130: 429-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The different roles of MsrA and MsrB in lifespan regulation could reflect the different biological functions and/or regulatory pathways involving these enzymes. MsrA has broader substrate specificity than MsrB and effectively reduces the free form of methionine-S-sulfoxide to methionine. Thus, MsrA overexpression could change the metabolism of methionine that is important for sulfur and DNA methylation pathways involved in aging (42Lin M.J. Tang L.Y. Reddy M.N. Shen C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 861-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 43Richardson B. Ageing Res. Rev. 2003; 2: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In addition, a forkhead transcription factor, FOXO3a, directly activates the human MSRA gene (34Minniti A.N. Cataldo R. Trigo C. Vasquez L. Mujica P. Leighton F. Inestrosa N.C. Aldunate R. Aging Cell. 2009; 8: 690-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and its homologs (DAF16 in Caenorhabditis elegans and dFOXO in fruit fly) activate worm msrA (34Minniti A.N. Cataldo R. Trigo C. Vasquez L. Mujica P. Leighton F. Inestrosa N.C. Aldunate R. Aging Cell. 2009; 8: 690-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and Drosophila msrA genes (39Chung H. Kim A.K. Jung S.A. Kim S.W. Yu K. Lee J.H. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 3609-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). FOXO3a transcription factor is known to up-regulate the expression of genes involved in oxidative stress response and longevity and down-regulate life-shortening genes. FOXO3a target genes include genes involved in cell cycle, stress response, metabolism, and apoptosis. dFOXO overexpression in the adult fatbody of female fruit flies results in increased lifespan (44Giannakou M.E. Goss M. Jünger M.A. Hafen E. Leevers S.J. Partridge L. Science. 2004; 305: 361Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Drosophila MsrA caused dFOXO translocation to the nucleus (39Chung H. Kim A.K. Jung S.A. Kim S.W. Yu K. Lee J.H. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 3609-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), implying that the prolonged lifespan of MsrA-expressing flies may be due not only to the MsrA role in oxidative stress resistance, but also its role in up-regulation of dFOXO. No transcriptional activation of MSRB genes by FOXO3a or its homologs in different organisms was reported thus far. The fact that the components of Sec biosynthesis and incorporation machineries, as well as selenoproteins themselves, are found in 11 Drosophila species (except for D. willistoni) (6Chapple C.E. Guigó R. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) reflects importance of these proteins for fruit flies; on the other hand, the absence of the evident phenotype of dEFsec knock-out flies and the occurrence of selenoproteinless animals pose an important question. Why are selenoproteins preserved in Drosophila during evolution if these proteins are not important for cellular redox regulation and longevity? In our study, we used dEFsec knock-out flies (24Hirosawa-Takamori M. Chung H.R. Jäckle H. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) to address this question. We also used these flies to study the role of selenium as a micronutrient (i.e. not in the form of selenoproteins) in aging. In addition, we used Drosophila as a model organism to clarify the role of mouse MsrB1 in aging. We addressed the following questions. Is it possible to promote resistance to oxidative stress and/or extend lifespan by expressing an additional selenoenzyme with protein repair function? Is it possible to regulate lifespan of these animals by dietary selenium? The ORF of mouse MsrB1 gene was PCR amplified from the pCI-SelR-His construct (45Kim H.Y. Gladyshev V.N. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e375Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) with 5′-GACTGAATTCATGTCGTTCTGCAGCTTCTTCGGAG-3′ and 5′-GTATGCGGCCGCCTAGTGCCCCTGGGAGGCAGCAGCTTCTTTGC-3′ primers and cloned into the EcoRI/NotI restriction sites of the pUAST vector (46Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to yield the pUAST-mMsrB1 construct. The 3′-UTR of Drosophilia selK containing the SECIS element (236 bp after the stop codon) was amplified from total RNA of white mutant (w1118) flies with 5′-GTATGCGGCCGCTAGCGACATCCGGTTCCCAAGACTCTTGG-3′ and 5′-CTACTCTAGAGGAGCTAATAGTTGATAAATGGAACCGACG-3′ primers using the SuperScript™ II RT kit (Invitrogen) and cloned into NotI/XbaI restriction sites of pUAST-mMsrB1 to yield the pUAST-mMsrB1-SECIS construct. This construct was used for generation of UAS-mMsrB1 transgenic lines. Transgenic flies were obtained using standard techniques for germline transformation and balancing as described (41Shchedrina V.A. Vorbrüggen G. Lee B.C. Kim H.Y. Kabil H. Harshman L.G. Gladyshev V.N. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2009; 130: 429-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Five independent homozygous UAS-mMsrB1 responder lines were obtained and three of them were used in the study. These lines were designated as mMsrB12A, mMsrB13A, and mMsrB13B. The designations of transgenic lines indicate the transgene (i.e. the mouse MsrB1 gene, mMsrB1) followed by the chromosome of insertion (i.e. 2 or 3), followed by a letter (i.e. A or B) showing the independent insertion on that chromosome. None of these insertions influenced viability or development of homozygous UAS-mMsrB1 transgenic lines. Two GAL4-activator lines (drivers) used in this study, whole body da-GAL4 [w*;; P{w+mW.hs = GAL4-da.G32}UH1] (stock number 5460) and nervous system elav-GAL4 [w*, P{w+mW.hs = GawB}elavc155] (stock number 458), were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center at Indiana University. All transgenic lines, including the driver lines, were backcrossed six times to the same isoline of yellow body white eyes flies yw (kindly provided by Dr. R. S. Sohal, University of Southern California) to ensure that the genetic backgrounds were equivalent. dEFsec knock-out flies (KO#24 and KO#46) with impaired selenoproteins synthesis were previously described (24Hirosawa-Takamori M. Chung H.R. Jäckle H. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, these flies were generated by P-element transformation of mutant dEFsec gene and homologous recombination. The GAL4-UAS binary system (46Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to drive expression of mMsrB1 in fruit flies. To obtain experimental flies, homozygous mMsrB12A, mMsrB13A, or mMsrB13B males were crossed with virgin females of GAL4-driver. Progeny of crosses between the GAL4-activator line and yw flies (GAL4-activator/yw) or between yw flies and UAS-mMsrB1 lines (yw/UAS-mMsrB1) were used as controls. mMsrB1-expressing or dEFsec KO experimental flies and their controls were obtained and maintained on corn meal food as previously described (41Shchedrina V.A.

Three types of food were used in the lifespan experiments. The first type was corn meal food that is commonly used in our laboratory (41Shchedrina V.A. Vorbrüggen G. Lee B.C. Kim H.Y. Kabil H. Harshman L.G. Gladyshev V.N. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2009; 130: 429-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The second type was a chemically defined medium developed by Martin-Romero et al.

This diet contained Grace's insect medium (G-8142, Sigma), 0.01% p-hydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester (Sigma), 2% low melting point agarose (Sigma) and was supplemented with or without sodium selenite (Sigma) at a final concentration of 100 nm. This food was used to examine the role of selenium in aging of dEFsec KO flies. The third diet was another chemically defined medium based on a fruit fly basal mixture developed by Troen et al.

This diet contained 62.08 g of Diet TD.04310 (Harlan Teklad), 100 mg of lecitin from soybean (Sigma), 500 mg of ribonucleic acid from Torula yeast (Sigma), 100 g of dextrose, 1.35 g of methionine (Sigma), 20 g of low melting point agarose, 2.85 ml of propionic acid, and 0.255 ml of phosphoric acid (Sigma) per liter of water (47Troen A.M. French E.E. Roberts J.F. Selhub J. Ordovas J.M. Parnell L.D. Lai C.Q. Age. 2007; 29: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This food was used to study the effect of selenium during aging of flies expressing Sec-containing mMsrB1. Sodium selenite was added (or was not added) to the food at a final concentration of 10 or 200 nm. The concentration of selenium in the food was measured by the analytical service provided by Oscar E. Olson Biochemistry Laboratories, South Dakota State University. The concentration of selenium in the diets was 13.02 ± 0.05 nm (unsupplemented diet), 19.59 ± 0.03 nm (diet supplemented with 10 nm selenite), and 206.7 ± 2.83 nm (diet supplemented with 200 nm selenite). Thirty eight-day-old mated flies were maintained on a Sf-900 II SM serum-free insect medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 3% dextrose (Sigma), 0.01% p-hydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester, 2% low melting point agarose, and 35 μCi of freshly neutralized [75Se]selenious acid (specific activity 1,000 Ci/mmol, University of Missouri Research Reactor, Columbia, MO) at 25 °C in a 12-h light/dark cycle for 72 h. Whole body homogenates of 35 flies were prepared in 350 μl of PBS buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Protein extracts (100 μg) were applied to a NuPAGE® Novex 10% BisTris gel (Invitrogen), electrophoresed, and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Invitrogen). The 75Se radioactivity pattern on the membrane was visualized using a PhosphorImager system (GE Healthcare). Lifespan studies were performed as described previously (41Shchedrina V.A. Vorbrüggen G. Lee B.C. Kim H.Y. Kabil H. Harshman L.G. Gladyshev V.N. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2009; 130: 429-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, adult animals were collected within 24 h post-eclosion. In a typical lifespan trial, three-day-old flies were placed in cages (see description in Ref. 41Shchedrina V.A. Vorbrüggen G.

Three replica cages were used for flies with the same genotype and gender; survivorship curves present the average of those independent replicas. In total, ∼180 mated flies were used for each survivorship curve of dEFsec knock-out flies and 210 virgin flies were used for each survivorship curve of mMsrB1-expressing flies.

Although individual nerve terminals from the same neuron often differ in neurotransmitter release characteristics, the extent to which endocytic retrieval of synaptic vesicle components differs is unknown. We used high-fidelity optical recordings to undertake a large-scale analysis of endocytosis kinetics of individual boutons in hippocampal rat neurons. Our data indicate that endocytosis kinetics do not differ substantially across boutons from the same cell but instead appear to be controlled at a cell-wide level."

Recently we have found that D4 receptor exerts an activity-dependent bi-directional regulation of AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated synaptic currents in pyramidal neurons of prefrontal cortex (PFC) via the dual control of calcium/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) activity. In this study, we examined the signaling mechanisms downstream of CaMKII that govern the complex effects of D4 on glutamatergic transmission. We found that in PFC neurons at high activity state, D4 suppresses AMPAR responses by disrupting the kinesin motor-based transport of GluR2 along microtubules, which was accompanied by the D4 reduction of microtubule stability via a mechanism dependent on CaMKII inhibition. On the other hand, in PFC neurons at the low activity state, D4 potentiates AMPAR responses by facilitating synaptic targeting of GluR1 through the scaffold protein SAP97 via a mechanism dependent on CaMKII stimulation. Taken together, these results have identified distinct signaling mechanisms underlying the homeostatic regulation of glutamatergic transmission by D4 receptors, which may be important for cognitive and emotional processes in which dopamine is involved.

https://openalex.org/W2022097323,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are environmental and tobacco carcinogens. Metabolic activation of intermediate PAH trans-dihydrodiols by aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) leads to the formation of electrophilic and redox-active o-quinones. We investigated whether O-methylation by human recombinant soluble catechol-O-methyltransferase (S-COMT) is a feasible detoxication step for a panel of structurally diverse PAH-catechols produced during the redox-cycling process. Classes of PAH non-K-region o-quinones (bay region, methylated bay region, and fjord region o-quinones) produced by AKRs were employed in the studies. PAH o-quinones were reduced to the corresponding catechols by dithiothreitol under anaerobic conditions and then further O-methylated by human S-COMT in the presence of S-[³H]adenosyl-l-methionine as a methyl group donor. The formation of the O-methylated catechols was detected by HPLC-UV coupled with in-line radiometric detection, and unlabeled products were also characterized by LC-MS/MS. Human S-COMT was able to catalyze O-methylation of all of the PAH-catechols and generated two isomeric metabolites in different proportions. LC-MS/MS showed that each isomer was a mono-O-methylated metabolite. ¹H NMR was used to assign the predominant positional isomer of benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-catechol as the O-8-monomethylated catechol. The catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) varied among different classes of PAH-catechols by 500-fold. The ability of S-COMT to produce two isomeric products from PAH-catechols was rationalized using the crystal structure of the enzyme. We provide evidence that O-8-monomethylated benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-catechol is formed in three different human lung cell lines. It is concluded that human S-COMT may play a critical role in the detoxication of PAH o-quinones generated by AKRs."
https://openalex.org/W2062111372,"Alternative processing of parvovirus B19 (B19V) pre-mRNA is critical to generating appropriate levels of B19V mRNA transcripts encoding capsid proteins and small nonstructural proteins. Polyadenylation of the B19V pre-mRNA at the proximal polyadenylation site ((pA)p), which prevents generation of full-length capsid proteins encoding mRNA transcripts, has been suggested as a step that blocks B19V permissiveness. We report here that efficient splicing of the B19V pre-mRNA within the first intron (upstream of the (pA)p site) stimulated the polyadenylation; in contrast, splicing of the B19V pre-mRNA within the second intron (in which the (pA)p site resides) interfered with the polyadenylation, leading to the generation of a sufficient number of B19V mRNA transcripts polyadenylated at the distal polyadenylation site ((pA)d). We also found that splicing within the second intron and polyadenylation at the (pA)p site compete during processing of the B19V pre-mRNA. Furthermore, we discovered that the U1 RNA that binds to the 5′ splice donor site of the second intron is fully responsible for inhibiting polyadenylation at the (pA)p site, whereas actual splicing, and perhaps assembly of the functional spliceosome, is not required. Finally, we demonstrated that inhibition of B19V pre-mRNA splicing within the second intron by targeting an intronic splicing enhancer using a Morpholino antisense oligonucleotide prevented B19V mRNA transcripts polyadenylated at the (pA)d site during B19V infection of human erythroid progenitors. Thus, our study reveals the mechanism by which alternative splicing coordinates alternative polyadenylation to generate full-length B19V mRNA transcripts at levels sufficient to support productive B19V infection.

B19V causes several diseases in humans (1Young N.S. Brown K.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), the most common of which is erythema infectiosum or Fifth disease. Other diseases include acute and chronic arthropathy, transient aplastic crisis (infection of patients with a high rate of red blood cell turnover), pure red cell aplasia (infection of immunocompromised patients), and hydrops fetalis (infection of pregnant women). Like other parvoviruses, B19V contains a linear single-stranded DNA genome of approximately (∼)5.6 kb, which is encapsidated by an icosahedrally symmetric capsid without an envelope (2Fauquet C.M.

In addition to infecting only humans, B19V infection shows a remarkable tropism for human erythroid progenitor cells (4Ozawa K. Kurtzman G. Young N.

Ayub J. Hao Y.S. Kurtzman G. Shimada T. Young N. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2395-2406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Liu Z. Qiu J. Cheng F. Chu Y. Yoto Y. O'Sullivan M.G. Brown K.E. Pintel D.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12929-12939Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The only unspliced mRNA encoding the large nonstructural protein (NS1) is polyadenylated at the proximal poly(A) site ((pA)p) and retains the first intron. The B19V mRNA transcripts in which the first intron is spliced out, through the A1-1 site, and which are polyadenylated at the (pA)p site encode the small 7.5-kDa nonstructural protein, whose function remains unknown. The B19V mRNA transcripts in which the first intron is spliced out and in which read-through at the (pA)p site leads to polyadenylation at the (pA)d site (R4-R9) (see Fig. 1A) encode the structural proteins VP1 and VP2, as well as the small 11-kDa nonstructural protein, whose function is required for the induction of apoptosis during B19V infection (13Chen A.Y. Zhang E.Y. Guan W. Cheng F. Kleiboeker S. Yankee T.M. Qiu J. Blood. 2010; 115: 1070-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, read-through at the internal polyadenylation site is a key step in producing viable progeny virus. In B19V-permissive erythroid progenitor cells, production of VP1/VP2- and 11-kDa-encoding mRNA transcripts involves preventing polyadenylation of the B19V pre-mRNA at the (pA)p site (14Guan W. Cheng F. Yoto Y. Kleiboeker S. Wong S. Zhi N. Pintel D.J. Qiu J. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 9951-9963Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). More than half of the B19V mRNAs are spliced at the second intron, which leads to the generation of sufficient VP2-encoding transcripts to enable viruses to assemble, as well as the 11-kDa-encoding transcripts. However, in B19V-nonpermissive cells, and even early in permissive infection of erythroid progenitor cells, the majority of B19V mRNA transcripts are polyadenylated at the (pA)p site and thus produce only the nonstructural proteins NS1 and the 7.5 kDa protein (14Guan W.

Using this system, we have identified multiple cis-acting elements that facilitate inclusion of the second exon (from the A1-1/A1-2 acceptor site to the D2 donor site), which was confirmed by monitoring transcription profiles during B19V infection of human primary erythroid progenitor cells (18Guan W.

The parent polyadenylation reporter plasmid (pCI(pA)test) was constructed by inserting an internal ribosome entry site and a GFP expression cassette before the SV40 poly(A) signal, through the SalI and NotI sites of the pCI vector (Promega), after which a Renilla-encoding sequence was inserted between the intron and the internal ribosome entry site via the NheI and EcoRI sites (see Fig. 2A). The pCI(pA)p reporter plasmids, pCI(pA)p400, pCI(pA)p240, pCI(pA)p1248, pCI(pA)p3426, and pCI(pA)p4800 were constructed by inserting the B19V sequences of nt 2641–3040, nt 2721–2960, nt 1248–2960, nt 2641–3426, and nt 2641–4800, respectively, into the EcoRI and XbaI sites between the Renilla expression cassette and the internal ribosome entry site (see Fig. 2A). The pCI(pA)d reporter plasmids pCI(pA)d400 and pCI(pA)d240 were generated by inserting B19V nt 4961–5360 and nt 5041–5280, respectively, into the parent reporter within the EcoRI and XbaI sites. Replacing the SV40 poly(A) signal with the (pA)d signal in the construct pCI(pA)p400 generated pCI(pA)p(pA)d. All of the constructs used for this purpose were based on the C1NS1(−) and were diagrammed in Fig. 3A. Plasmids C1B19A1-1KOa and C1B19A1-2KO were constructed by mutating the A1-1 or the A1-2 sites from AG to AA. C1B19A1-1KOb was generated by mutating the A1-1 site from AG to AA and the purine-rich exonic splicing enhancer (ESE1) (nt 2158–2173) to a sequence of 5′-CCTTAGCCATATTGT-3′ between the A1-1 and A1-2 acceptor sites (18Guan W.

Further mutation of the A1-2 site from AG to AA on the plasmid C1B19A1-1KO generated C1B19A1-1/2KO. The plasmid C1B19A1-1U2AF was constructed by mutating the A1-2 site from AG to AA and further mutating the polypyrimidine tract of the A1-1 site to a consensus U2AF65 (U2 auxiliary factor 65)-binding sequence (5′-TTCCCTTTTTTTTC-3′) (see Fig. 3A) (22Valcárcel J. Gaur R.K. Singh R. Green M.R. Science. 1996; 273: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). All of the plasmids were based on C1NS1(−) and B19-N8, as shown in Fig. 4A. The acceptor 3′ splice site knock-out constructs C1B19A2-1KO, C1B19A2-2KO, and C1B19A2-1/2KO were made by mutating the A2-1, A2-2, and both A2-1 and A2-2 sites, respectively, from AG to AA. Plasmids C1B19A2-1U2AF and C1B19A2-2U2AF were generated by mutating the polypyrimidine tract of the A2-1 and A2-2 sites to an U2AF65-binding sequence as described above. Further knock-out of the A2-2 site on C1B19A2-1U2AF resulted in plasmid C1B19A2-1U2AF/A2-2KO. Donor mutants C1B19D2KO and C1B19D2Cons were constructed by mutating the D2 site to 5′-CCG/CGGAAC-3′ and 5′-CAG/GTATGT-3′, respectively. B19-N8-based plasmids B19-N8A2-1U2AF and B19-N8A2-1/2KO were constructed by mutating the A2-1 site to an U2AF65-binding sequence and by knocking out both the A2-1 and A2-2 sites, respectively, as described above. All of the (pA)p mutants were based on C1NS1(−) and diagrammed in Fig. 5A. C1B19(pA)pKO and pCIB19(pA)pCons were constructed by mutating the potential cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor-binding hexanucleotides from 5′-ATTAAA/AATAAC-3′ to 5′GATATC/AATAAC-3′, and from 5′ATTAAA/AATAAC-3′ to 5′-AATAAA/AATAAA-3′, respectively. Plasmid C1B19(pA)pmDSE was generated by mutating the 50-nt downstream element (DSE) (17Yoto Y. Qiu J. Pintel D.J. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1604-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Plasmid C1B19s(pA)p was made by replacing the B19V sequence nt 2819–2868 with a synthetic poly(A) signal (23Levitt N. Briggs D. Gil A. Proudfoot N.J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 5A. C1B19s(pA)pKO was generated by further mutating the synthetic poly(A) signal in the C1B19s(pA)p from 5′-AAUAAA-3′ to 5′-GAGCUC-3′ as described previously (18Guan W. Cheng F. Huang Q. Kleiboeker S. Qiu J. J. Virol. 2011; 85: 2463-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Plasmid C1B19ISE2A2-1KO was constructed from the parent plasmid C1NS1(−) by mutating the G-rich intronic splicing enhancer (ISE) (nt 2371–2400) to 5′-CCGCGGCACGAGATCATCACGATCGAACAG-3′ as described previously (18Guan W. Cheng F. Huang Q. Kleiboeker S. Qiu J. J. Virol. 2011; 85: 2463-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and the A2-1 site from AG to AA. The plasmid C1B19ISE2A2-1/2KO was generated by mutating the A2-2 site in the parent plasmid C1B19ISE2A2-1KO from AG to AA. Plasmid U1B19VD2 was made by mutating the donor site binding sequence in the U1 RNA sequence of the U1 RNA-expressing plasmid (24Zhuang Y. Weiner A.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 827-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) such that it is complementary to the B19V D2 donor site (5′-ACT/GTTAGT-3′). Probes 9 and 10 were constructed by inserting the B19V nt 3121–3383 or nt 4721–5040 sequences, respectively, into BamHI-HindIII-digested pGEM4Z (Promega). Probe 11 was constructed by cloning the corresponding B19V sequences of nt 2001–2560 into the C1NS1(−)-based constructs described above into BamHI-HindIII-digested pGEM3Z. Probe 8 has been described previously (14Guan W. Cheng F. Yoto Y. Kleiboeker S. Wong S. Zhi N. Pintel D.J. Qiu J. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 9951-9963Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All these probes and the bands they protect are shown in Fig. 1B. Probes p(pA)p + SV40 and p(pA)d+SV40 were generated by inserting the poly(A) signal of the SV40 virus of the pCI vector (nt 1114–1330) into pGEM4Z, through PstI and HindIII sites, and the B19V sequences of nt 2760–2940 and nt 5041–5280, respectively, were then inserted into EcoRI-KpnI-digested pGEM4Z. The probes and their protected bands are diagrammed in Fig. 2A. COS-7 cells (ATCC, CRL-1651) were maintained in DMEM with 10% FCS at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of DNA per 60-mm plate using LipofectamineTM and PLUSTM reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. UT7/Epo-S1 cells, which are permissive to B19V infection (20Guan W. Wong S. Zhi N. Qiu J. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 9541-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25Morita E. Tada K. Chisaka H.

Plasmids B19-N8, B19-N8A2-1U2AF, and B19-N8A2-1/2KO were digested with XhoI/EcoRI to recover the excised B19V DNA fragments that were used for electroporation. UT7/Epo-S1 cells were electroporated with 2 μg of linearized B19V DNA per 2 × 106 cells with an Amaxa Nucleofector device (Lonza) as described previously (20Guan W. Wong S. Zhi N. Qiu J. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 9541-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Primary human erythroid progenitor cells (CD36+ EPCs) were generated; large numbers of CD36+ EPCs, at day 8 of ex vivo expansion, were treated with Morpholino oligonucleotides M-ISE2 and M-ISE2 control (18Guan W. Cheng F. Huang Q. Kleiboeker S. Qiu J. J. Virol. 2011; 85: 2463-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) at 16 h prior to B19V infection, as described previously (13Chen A.Y. Zhang E.Y. Guan W. Cheng F. Kleiboeker S. Yankee T.M. Qiu J. Blood. 2010; 115: 1070-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The cells were infected with B19V (a gifted plasma sample from ViraCor-IBT, Lee's Summit, MO) at a multiplicity of infection of 1 (20Guan W. Wong S. Zhi N. Qiu J. J.

Virol. 2010; 84: 12385-12396Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Virus-containing cell lysates were digested with nuclease Benzonase® (2.5 units/μl) overnight, prior to viral DNA extraction using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen). Viral genomes were quantified by quantitative PCR, using a probe and a primer set targeting to the NS1 gene as described previously (20Guan W. Wong S. Zhi N. Qiu J. J.

Virol. 2010; 84: 12385-12396Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from transfected cells 2 days after transfection or virus infection using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and in some experiments, where indicated, mRNA was purified from total RNA using FastTrack MAG mRNA kit (Invitrogen), following the protocols provided by the manufacturer. RNase protection assays were performed essentially as described previously (14Guan W. Cheng F. Yoto Y. Kleiboeker S. Wong S. Zhi N. Pintel D.J. Qiu J. J.

Briefly, probes were generated by in vitro transcription with T7 or SP6 polymerase, using the MAXIscript® (Ambion) and following the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Ten μg of total RNA or mRNA purified from 100 μg of total RNA was hybridized with a substantial excess of probe, and RNase protection signals were quantified with the Storm 856 PhosphorImager and Image Quant TL software (version 2005, GE Healthcare). Relative molar ratios of individual species of RNAs were determined after adjustment for the number of 32P-labeled uridines (U) in each protected fragment, as described previously (28Naeger L.K.

Virology. 1991; 181: 22-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To study the regulation of B19V internal polyadenylation, we first examined the strength of the core poly(A) signals at the (pA)p and the (pA)d sites. We constructed and used a poly(A) reporter plasmid pCI(pA)test, comparing the strength at each site with that at the SV40 poly(A) site ((pA)SV40) (Fig. 2A). We found that >95% of the mRNA transcripts generated from the pCI(pA)p400 and pCI(pA)p240 read through the (pA)p site (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3). The ratio of (pA)SV40/(pA)p was ∼40, indicating that an efficient core poly(A) signal of the (pA)p requires extended sequences beyond this 400-nt B19V sequence. When the parallel experiment was carried out using probe p(pA)d+SV40, we found that nearly one-third of the pre-mRNAs were polyadenylated at the (pA)d site, indicating that the 240-nt core signal of the (pA)d (nt 5041–5280) is sufficient, and has a strength of a half of that at the SV40 poly(A) site (Fig. 2B, lane 9). Finally, analysis of the mRNA transcripts generated from transfection of the construct pCI(pA)p(pA)d showed that ∼95% of the mRNAs read through the core (pA)p site, and they were polyadenylated at the core (pA)d site (Fig. 2B, lane 10). The strength of polyadenylation at the 400-nt core (pA)d was found to be twenty times greater than that at the 400-nt core (pA)p. We next tested functions of the sequences outside of the 400-nt core (pA)p signal, including sequences from either the first intron (pCI(pA)p1248)) or the second intron (pCI(pA)p3426 and pCI(pA)p4800). We found that ∼25% of the pre-mRNAs generated from transfection of the pCI(pA)p1248 were polyadenylated at the (pA)p site (Fig. 2B, lane 4) but that polyadenylation was higher when the core signal sequence was extended toward the second intron (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6). Inclusion of the core poly(A) signal of B19V sequence nt 2641–4800 resulted in ∼50% of the pre-mRNAs being polyadenylated at the (pA)p site (Fig. 2B, lane 6). Taken together, these results show that efficient polyadenylation at the (pA)p site requires cis-acting signals located beyond the 400-nt core (pA)p signal within the first and second introns, whereas the 400-nt core (pA)d signal is sufficient for polyadenylation of B19V pre-mRNA at the (pA)d site. We next investigated whether splicing of the upstream intron of the site (pA)p affects polyadenylation at this site. First, we mutated the acceptor sites of the first intron to decrease splicing between the D1 site and the A1-1 or A1-2 site. Mutating the dinucleotide AG of the A1-1 acceptor to AA led to usage of a cryptic acceptor site at nt 2104, with splicing at the A1-1 site decreased ∼2-fold compared with that in wild type (Fig. 3B, lane 2). In this context, polyadenylation at the (pA)p site was slightly decreased compared with that in wild type, with ratio of (pA)p/(pA)d reduced from 0.9 to 0.7 (Fig. 3C, compare lane 2 with 1). Further mutation of ISE1 (an intronic splicing enhancer), which facilitates splicing at the A1-1 site (18Guan W. Cheng F. Huang Q. Kleiboeker S. Qiu J. J. Virol. 2011; 85: 2463-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), abrogated this splicing (Fig. 3B, lane 3) and reduced polyadenylation at the (pA)p site 3-fold compared with that in the wild type, with the (pA)p/(pA)d ratio decreasing from 0.9 to 0.3 (Fig. 3C, lane 3). Mutating the A1-2 acceptor site from AG to AA resulted in nearly complete loss of splicing from the D1 site to the A1-2 site (Fig. 3B, lane 4) and to a significant reduction of polyadenylation at the (pA)p site with the (pA)p/(pA)d reduced from 0.9 to 0.6 (Fig. 3C, lane 4). When all splicing from the D1 site (to both the A1-1 and A1-2 sites) was knocked out through combined mutations at the enhancer and both acceptor sites, polyadenylation at the (pA)p site was decreased ∼10-fold compared with that in wild type (Fig. 3C, lane 5) with the (pA)p/(pA)d ratio reduced from 0.9 to 0.1. Notably, when splicing of the first intron was enhanced by mutating the polypyrimidine tract of the A1-1 site to a consensus U2AF65-binding sequence (Fig. 3A, construct 6), polyadenylation at the (pA)p site was slightly increased compared with that seen in the wild type (Fig. 3C, lane 6). Splicing of B19V pre-mRNA at the A1-1 site was found to be increased significantly, but splicing at the A1-2 site was nearly abolished (Fig. 3B, lane 6). Taken together, these results suggest that efficient polyadenylation of the B19V pre-mRNA at the (pA)p site requires efficient splicing of the first intron upstream of the (pA)p site. Because the B19V internal (pA)p site lies in a functional intron, we investigated whether splicing of the second intron influences polyadenylation at the (pA)p site. To this end, we mutated the A2-1 or A2-2 acceptor site, abolishing splicing at the respective site (Fig. 4, B and C, lanes 2 and 3). In both of these contexts, polyadenylation at the (pA)p site remained the same as that in the wild type (Fig. 4D, lanes 2 and 3). When both of the A2-1 and A2-2 sites were mutated, splicing in the second intron was completely abrogated (Fig. 4, B and C, lane 4). In this context, ∼35% of the mRNA transcripts were polyadenylated at the (pA)p site, which represents a decrease of ∼30% relative to that of the wild type genome (Fig. 4D, lane 4). When the D2 donor site and the A2-1 and A1-2 acceptor sites were all mutated, splicing within the second intron was likewise abrogated (Fig. 4, B and C, lane 5); yet, to our surprise, more than 85% of the B19V mRNA transcripts were polyadenylated at the (pA)p site (Fig. 4D, lane 5). Similarly, while splicing in the second intron was abrogated by mutating ISE2, located 3′ of the D2 donor site (18Guan W. Cheng F. Huang Q. Kleiboeker S. Qiu J. J. Virol. 2011; 85: 2463-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), >95% of the mRNAs produced were polyadenylated at the (pA)p site (Fig. 4E, lane 2). Based on the findings presented above, we concluded that the presence of the D2 donor site and the ISE2 site, both of which are critical for U1 snRNP binding the D2 donor site (18Guan W. Cheng F. Huang Q. Kleiboeker S. Qiu J. J. Virol. 2011; 85: 2463-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), plays an important role in regulating polyadenylation of the B19V pre-mRNA at the (pA)p site. To test this possibility, we made a mutant affecting only the D2 donor site. Despite the fact that mutation of the D2 donor site resulted in splicing from a cryptic donor site and a decrease splicing in the second intron (as shown previously in Ref. 18Guan W. Cheng F. Huang Q. Kleiboeker S. Qiu J. J. Virol. 2011; 85: 2463-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar and confirmed in Fig. 4, B and C, lane 9), ∼85% of the B19V mRNA transcripts were polyadenylated at the (pA)p site (Fig. 4D, lane 9). Notably, when the D2 site was mutated to a consensus U1 RNA-binding sequence (5′-CAG/GTATGT-3′), splicing from the D2 to the A2-1 site was confirmed as being significantly increased (Fig. 4B, lane 10), and this resulted in nearly all B19V mRNAs being polyadenylated at the (pA)d site (Fig. 4D, lane 10). Accordingly, increasing splicing from the second intron as a consequence of conversion of the A2-1 site, A2-2 site, or both to consensus U2AF65-binding sequences (Fig. 4, B and C, lanes 6, 7, and 8, respectively) resulted in significantly decreased polyadenylation at the (pA)p site (Fig. 4D, lanes 6, 7, and 8, respectively). To ensure this competition between splicing and polyadenylation within the second intron occurs in B19V-permissive cells, we transfected UT7/Epo-S1 cells with linearized B19V DNA N8, which has been shown to replicate in these cells (20Guan W. Wong S. Zhi N. Qiu J. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 9541-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and its A2-1U2AF and A2-1/2KO mutants. Replication of these B19V DNAs in UT7/Epo-S1 cells was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Similar to what we observed from transfection of these mutants in the context of B19V replication-competent backbone in COS-7 cells, we found that an increase in splicing of the second intron at the A2-1 site improved B19V pre-mRNA read through the (pA)p site significantly (ratio of (pA)p/(pA)d was decreased from 1 to <0.1; Fig. 4D, lane 12) and that knock-out of splicing of the central intron prevented B19V pre-mRNA read through the (pA)p site.

Numerous studies have demonstrated increased flux through this pathway contributes to the development of β-cell dysfunction. The effect of decreased O-GlcNAc on the maintenance of normal β-cell function, however, is not well understood. We studied transgenic mice that over express β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase), an enzyme that catalyzes the removal of O-GlcNAc from proteins, in the pancreatic β-cell under control of the rat insulin promoter. 3–4-Month-old O-GlcNAcase transgenic mice have higher glucose excursions with a concomitant decrease in circulating insulin levels, insulin mRNA levels, and total islet insulin content. In older (8–9-month-old) O-GlcNAcase transgenic mice glucose tolerance is no longer impaired. This is associated with increased serum insulin, islet insulin content, and insulin mRNA in the O-GlcNAcase transgenic mice. These improvements in β-cell function with aging are associated with increased angiogenesis and increased VEGF expression, with parallel increases in activation of Akt and expression of PGC1α. The biphasic effects as a function of age are consistent with published observations of mice with increased O-GlcNAc in islets and demonstrate that O-GlcNAc signaling exerts multiple effects on both insulin secretion and islet survival.

Subsequent steps metabolize glucosamine-6-phosphate to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and other amino sugars used in the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids. One pathway using UDP-GlcNAc as a donor substrate is the O-linked glycosylation of nuclear and cytosolic proteins on serine and/or threonine residues by the enzyme uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine:polypeptide β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (O-glycosyltransferase). Deglycosylation of these proteins is catalyzed by β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase) (2Gao Y. Wells L. Comer F.I. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol.

Because O-glycosyl transferase is often limited by the availability of UDP-GlcNAc, and its levels are in turn rate-limited by hexose entry into the HBP, modification of proteins by O-GlcNAc serves a nutrient-sensing function. The HBP/O-GlcNAc pathway regulates metabolism in several tissues, exerting pleiotropic effects that are both acute (e.g. down-regulation of glucose uptake and glycogen synthase activity by direct modification of glycogen synthase and insulin signal transduction proteins) and long term (e.g. modification of transcription factors and epigenetic effects) (4Parker G.

Previous studies have demonstrated an important role for the HBP/O-GlcNAc pathway in regulating the function of the pancreatic β-cells. Acute increases in the levels of O-GlcNAc achieved by treating β-cells with inhibitors of O-GlcNAcase result in decreased glucose stimulated insulin secretion (11Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. Wells L. Vosseller K. Yamamoto K. Munetomo E. Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nishiwaki C. Nagamatsu S. Hirano H. Kawakami H. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Treatment of primary rat islets with glucosamine, which results in a large increase in O-GlcNAc by entering the HBP downstream of rate-limiting GFA, also decreases insulin secretion (12Kaneto H.

The effects of O-GlcNAc are, however, dose- and time-dependent. Transgenic overexpression of GFA in β-cells, resulting in a more modest increase in UDP-GlcNAc and O-GlcNAc modification than the treatments above, has the opposite effect and leads to hyperinsulinemia and increased total insulin content in the pancreas of younger C57BL/6J mice (13Tang J. Neidigh J.L. Cooksey R.C. McClain D.A. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1492-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The latter results are consistent with the relatively acute nutrient-sensing function of the HBP wherein an apparent increase in glucose flux is sensed through the increased HBP activity and insulin secretory capacity is increased accordingly. As the same mice age, however, they exhibit decreased glucose stimulated insulin secretion, demonstrating the distinct effects of subacute versus chronic modulation of the HBP/O-GlcNAc pathway (14Cooksey R.C. Pusuluri S. Hazel M. McClain D.A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 290: E334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Results such as these suggest that the pathway mediates aspects of both physiologic and adaptive nutrient-sensing in situations of normal glucose flux (15Soesanto Y.A. Luo B. Jones D. Taylor R.

Metab. 2008; 295: E974-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and pathophysiologic, deleterious changes in β-cell function seen with chronic nutrient excess or diabetes (7McClain D.A. Crook E.D. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 13Tang J.

The mechanisms of HBP/O-GlcNAc regulation of β-cell function are incompletely understood but have been shown to include regulation of the function, transcription, and translocation of transcription factors involved in β-cell development and insulin gene expression (16Andrali S.S. Qian Q. Ozcan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15589-15596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Andrali S.S. Sampley M.L. Vanderford N.L. Ozcan S. Biochem.

Another pathway through which the HBP may regulate β-cell function on a more chronic basis is by altering angiogenesis. We recently reported that the HBP/O-GlcNAc pathway regulates angiogenesis in vascular endothelial cells (19Luo B. Soesanto Y. McClain D.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and angiogenesis is also crucial to islet function. To facilitate blood glucose sensing, pancreatic islets are richly vascularized, and β-cells are known to secrete the angiogenic VEGF (20Kuroda M. Oka T. Oka Y. Yamochi T. Ohtsubo K. Mori S. Watanabe T. Machinami R. Ohnishi S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 3196-3200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of VEGF in β-cells leads to significant loss of islet vessel density and results in glucose intolerance, impaired insulin production, and defective insulin secretion (21Lammert E. Gu G. McLaughlin M. Brown D. Brekken R. Murtaugh L.C. Gerber H.P. Ferrara N. Melton D.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1070-1074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This process is thought to be particularly critical in supporting the expansion of the β-cell mass in response to insulin resistance induced by aging or obesity. The contribution of the HBP/O-GlcNAc pathway to overall β-cell function and insulin secretory capacity, particularly in situations of euglycemia and through the life of the organism and the full dynamic range of low to high O-GlcNAc, remains unclear. We therefore created transgenic mice overexpressing O-GlcNAcase in pancreatic β-cells under control of the rat insulin promoter. We report that these animals have decreased insulin synthesis and secretory capacity while young, but as they age, they compensate through a mechanism that involves increased angiogenesis. These studies demonstrate the multifaceted involvement of the HBP/O-GlcNAc pathway in supporting nutrient sensing functions through several mechanisms that result in changes that are both acute and chronic, adaptive and deleterious. A bluescript SK+/− phagemid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), modified with the rat insulin promoter, human GFA gene and SV40 polyadenosine tail, had been used previously to generate an islet-specific GFA transgenic C57/BL6 mouse line (13Tang J. Neidigh J.L. Cooksey R.C. McClain D.A. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1492-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This plasmid was modified by removal of the human GFA gene and insertion of the human O-GlcNAcase gene, a gift of Gerald Hart (The Johns Hopkins University). A consensus Kozak sequence was introduced immediately adjacent to the initiation codon by site-directed mutagensis (Stratagene). The resulting plasmid was cut with Sap1 and BsaA1 enzymes and the rat insulin promoter/O-GlcNAcase/SV40 polA fragment was isolated, purified, and submitted to the Transgenic Core Facility (Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University). Eight transgenic mouse lines were generated and selected based on combined human/mouse O-GlcNAcase mRNA levels in the islet. The mice were generated and maintained on the C57/BL6 background. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Utah approved all experimental procedures. Antibodies to Akt and phospho-Akt (Ser-473) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Anti-O-GlcNAc monoclonal IgM antibody (CTD 110.6) was a gift from Dr. Gerald Hart. GAPDH antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Islets were isolated using the intraductal Liberase RI digestion technique. Briefly, mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and 3 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.3 mg/ml Liberase RI Purified Enzyme Blend (Roche Applied Science) were injected into the pancreas through the bile duct. Pancreata were excised and incubated at 37 C for 12 min, briefly shaken, and filtered through a nylon mesh. The islets were further purified by handpicking under a dissecting microscope to eliminate any remaining exocrine tissue. Size-matched islets (5–10/determination) from each group were sonicated in 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution at setting 4 for 10 1-s bursts (Brinkmann Sonic Dismembrator 60, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Insulin was measured using the Sensitive Rat Insulin RIA Kit (Linco Research, Inc.). Experimental animals were fasted for 6 h, after which glucose (1 g/kg body weight) was administered intraperitoneally to nonsedated animals. Tail vein blood (3 ul) was sampled for glucose determination (Glucometer Elite, Bayer Corp., Tarrytown, NY) before and 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose administration. Tail vein blood (50 ul) was also collected for insulin determination before and 30 min after the start of the IPGTT. Values for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and β-cell function (HOMA-B) were calculated as described (22Matthews D.R. Hosker J.P. Rudenski A.S. Naylor B.A. Treacher D.F. Turner R.C. Diabetologia. 1985; 28: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (25482) Google Scholar). Human recombinant insulin (Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, IN; 0.75 units/kg body weight) was administered i.p. to random-fed conscious mice. Tail vein blood (3 ul) was sampled for glucose determination (Glucometer Elite, Bayer Corp.) before and 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after insulin administration. Mouse pancreata were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight. Cryosections were cut at 10 μm, collected on superfrost plus slides (Fisher), and stained with primary antibody CD31 (BD Biosciences), followed by Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-goat IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen). DAPI was used to stain nuclei. The percentage of CD31-immunopositive area in islets was quantified from at least 30 sections from four to five animals in each group using NIH ImageJ software. Endothelial cell sprouting from cultured pancreatic islets was quantified as described previously (23Kidszun A. Schneider D. Erb D. Hertl G. Schmidt V. Eckhard M. Preissner K.T. Breier G. Bretzel R.G. Linn T. Cell Transplant. 2006; 15: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse islets were isolated, embedded in Matrigel (BD Biosciences), and cultured in endothelial growth medium with 10% FBS. Vascular sprouting was monitored every 2 days under inverted microscopy and recorded at day 6. VEGF (10 ng/ml) was used to treat cultured WT islets as a positive control. INS-1 cells, a line derived from pancreatic β-cells, were maintained in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. INS-1 cells were infected with the adenovirus encoding O-GlcNAcase (a gift from Dr. Wolfgang Dillmann, University of California, San Diego) for 2 days. After removal of virus-containing medium, cells were maintained in RPMI with 10% FBS. A replication-defective vector expressing GFP was used as a control. Preliminary studies revealed that after 48 h of infection with control GFP, >90% of INS-1 cells expressed green fluorescent protein. Islets or cell pellets sonicated in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich)). 20–60 μg of denatured protein were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto Immobilon nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Blots were blocked with TBS-T (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, and 0.5% Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk for 1 h at room temperature. For detection with the CTD 110.6 antibody, blots were blocked with TBS-T containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. RNA was isolated from mouse islets and INS-1 cells using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH), purified using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. cDNA was purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) prior to RT-PCR studies. mRNA levels were normalized to β-actin 5′-gtgggaatgggtcagaagca-3′ (forward) and 5′-ccctcgtagatgggcacagt-3′ (reverse). Other primers used for the studies were as follows: O-GlcNAcase, 5′-ccctcagcctggattactgct-3′ (forward) and 5′-agacaggaggcaagccatca-3′ (reverse); insulin-1, 5′-agcaagcaggtcattgttcc-3′ (forward) and 5′-gtagagggagcagatgctgg-3′ (reverse); insulin-2, 5′-cctgctggccctgctctt-3′ (forward) and 5′-ggctgggtagtggtgggtcta-3′ (reverse); PDX-1, 5′-tggatgaaatccaccaaagc-3′ (forward) and 5′-ttcaacatcactgccagctc-3′ (reverse); NeuroD1, 5′-caaagccacggatcaatctt-3′ (forward) and 5′-cccgggaatagtgaaactga-3′ (reverse); Maf-A, 5′-aggaggaggtcatccgactg-3′ (forward) and 5′-cttctcgctctccagaatgtg-3′ (reverse); Glut-2, 5′-gcctgtgtatgcaaccattg-3′ (forward) and 5′-gaagatggcagtcatgctca-3′ (reverse); VEGF-A, 5′-aaggaggagggcagaatcat-3′ (forward) and 5′-atctgcatggtgatgttgga-3′ (reverse); ANG-1, 5′-cttcaaggcttggtttctcg-3′ (forward) and 5′-tctgcacagtctcgaaatgg (reverse); TNFα, 5′-agcccccagtctgtatcctt-3′ (forward) and 5′-ctccctttgcagaactcagg-3′ (reverse); FGF1, 5′-ggacctggtgatgcaaagtt-3′ (forward) and 5′-atttgtgcggttctggtagg-3′ (reverse); ANG-2, 5′-gcatgtggtccttccaactt-3′ (forward) and 5′-tggtgtctctcagtgccttg-3′ (reverse); and PGC1α, 5′-atcaaggtccccaggcagtag-3′ (forward) and 5′-cgtgctctttgcggtattca-3′ (reverse). Results are presented as mean ± S.E. The unpaired Student's t test (two-tailed) was used to assess differences between experimental groups and controls. Probability values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Transgenic mice exhibited a 6.4-fold increase (p < 0.01) in O-GlcNAcase expression in pancreatic islets (Fig. 1A). No increase was evident in liver, muscle, or fat (data not shown). O-GlcNAcase protein expression was also increased, and this resulted in a 130% decrease in overall protein O-linked glycosylation in islets, as demonstrated by Western blotting using a nonprotein-specific antibody to O-linked GlcNAc (Fig. 1B, p < 0.05). To limit variance in studies of these mice, all experiments were performed on female mice unless otherwise indicated, although selected critical results were replicated in males as indicated below. To determine the role of β-cell O-GlcNAcase in insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis, we performed an IPGTT on 3–4 month old mice fed normal chow and fasted for 6 h. O-GlcNAcase transgenic female mice displayed statistically significant (p < 0.01) increases in glucose levels at all time points compared with WT mice except at 120 min (Fig. 1C). Similar results were seen in male mice, with a 27 ± 3% increase in the area under the glucose curve after IPGTT in the transgenic compared with WT mice (p < 0.05, data not shown). The differences in glucose tolerance were not attributable to differences in weight between the groups (WT, 19.9 ± 0.2 g, O-GlcNAcase, 19.6 ± 0.2 g). Serum insulin levels of O-GlcNAcase mice were lower both in the fasted state and 30 min after glucose challenge (p < 0.05, Fig. 1D). To determine if the glucose intolerance might be related to decreased insulin responsiveness, we performed insulin tolerance testing. O-GlcNAcase transgenic and WT mice responded equally well to insulin, suggesting a primary defect in insulin secretion (Fig. 1E). Consistent with this, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (22Matthews D.R. Hosker J.P. Rudenski A.S. Naylor B.A. Treacher D.F. Turner R.C. Diabetologia. 1985; 28: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (25482) Google Scholar) did not reveal increased insulin resistance in O-GlcNAcase mice (Fig. 1F). HOMA assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-B), by contrast, revealed a 30% decrease in β-cell function in the O-GlcNAcase transgenic mice (p < 0.05, Fig. 1G). These results demonstrate that O-GlcNAc signaling plays a role in maintaining normal insulin levels, even in normoglycemic, young, otherwise physiologically unstressed mice. To investigate the mechanism of the decreased fasting insulin level in the O-GlcNAcase transgenic mice, we studied isolated islets from the pancreata of 3–4-month-old mice. Transgenic islets exhibited a significantly lower expression of insulin-1 mRNA (Fig. 2A, p < 0.05). Insulin-2 mRNA also trended lower by 56% (p = 0.055). The transcription factors PDX-1 (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox-1), NeuroD1 (neurogenic differentiation 1), and Maf-A (V-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homologue A) act in a coordinated and synergistic manner to regulate insulin gene transcription (24Matsuoka T.A.

The activities or expression levels of all of these proteins have previously been shown to be regulated by the HBP/O-GlcNAc pathway (11Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. Wells L. Vosseller K. Yamamoto K.

Andrali S.S. Ozcan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1577-1584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We observed no significant difference in the mRNA levels of these factors in the mice overexpressing O-GlcNAcase compared with WT (Fig. 2A). The mRNA level of the β-cell glucose transporter, GLUT-2, was also unaffected. Consistent with the changes in the mRNAs for insulin, insulin content per islet in 3–4-month-old transgenic mice, normalized to islet protein, was decreased by 44% (p < 0.05, Fig. 2B). To examine insulin secretion, isolated islets were exposed to different glucose concentrations and 30 mm KCl as a maximal pharmacologic stimulus. There were no differences in insulin secretion per islet between the two groups when treated with either 2.8 or 8 mm glucose (Fig. 2C). At 16 mm glucose, there was a trend toward decreased insulin secretion (27%) in islets from O-GlcNAcase transgenic mice but the result was not statistically significant (p = 0.16). Pharmacological treatment of islets with 30 mm KCl, however, resulted in a 46% decrease in insulin secretion in the O-GlcNAcase islets (p < 0.05, Fig. 2C). Thus, in islets of these younger mice, the decreased glucose tolerance seen with overexpression of O-GlcNAcase is associated with decreased insulin gene expression and decreased maximal insulin secretory capacity. We also investigated beta cell mass in the mice because of the reported effects of changes in O-GlcNAc on transcription factors that contribute to islet differentiation. There was no change in beta cell area per islet as determined by anti-insulin antibody staining in transgenic compared with WT islets, and the number of islets per pancreas actually trended to be higher in the transgenic mice (not shown). Thus, there is no evidence for an effect of O-GlcNAcase overexpression on the mass of beta cells, rather it is the case that the function and/or secretory capacity of the islets is the main determinant of the phenotype described in Fig. 1. Based on the observation that aging normally leads to increased O-GlcNAc levels (28Vosseller K. Aging. 2010; 2: 749-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 29Chatham J.C. Marchase R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1800: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and that elevated O-GlcNAc impairs β-cell function (11Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. Wells L. Vosseller K. Yamamoto K. Munetomo E.

Metab. 2006; 290: E334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we next examined the effect of O-GlcNAcase on β-cell function in aged mice. We performed IPGTT on 8–9 month old O-GlcNAcase mice, and in contrast to the younger mice, older O-GlcNAcase mice did not have impaired glucose tolerance compared with WT (Fig. 3A). In fact, O-GlcNAcase mice improved their glucose tolerance with aging, as assessed by a 17% decrease in the area under the glucose curve (AUCG) during IPGTT (p < 0.001, Table 1), whereas in the same age range, the WT mice did not change (5% decrease, p = 0.28). Older O-GlcNAcase transgenic mice exhibited 32% higher fasting insulin levels compared with WT controls (Fig. 3B, p < 0.05). There was a trend toward an increase in insulin levels 30 min post-glucose challenge (25%, Fig. 3B), but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.19).TABLE 1Areas under the glucose curve (AUCG) during glucose tolerance testing in younger and older wild type and O-GlcNAcase transgenic miceAUCG (wild type)AUCG (O-GlcNAcase)3–4 Months25.4 ± 0.7 (20)31.1 ± 1.2 (13)ap < 0.01 compared to all other groups.8–9 Months24.1 ± 1.0 (16)25.6 ± 0.8 (17)a p < 0.01 compared to all other groups. Open table in a new tab β-cell function of the O-GlcNAcase mice assessed by HOMA-B only trended toward an increase compared with WT (Fig. 3C, 58%, p = 0.26). When comparing the HOMA-B values from the 3–4-month-old mice (Fig. 1G) with those of the 8–9-month-old mice (Fig. 3C), however, the older WT mice increased their HOMA-B values 90% over that of younger WT (p = 0.01), whereas the older O-GlcNAcase mice increased their HOMA-B values 344% over that of the younger transgenics (p < 0.001). The larger increase in HOMA-B in response to aging in the O-GlcNAcase mice compared with WT was statistically significant (p = 0.01). These changes were accompanied by reversal of the decreases in INS-1 mRNA and insulin content per islet that had been observed in the younger O-GlcNAcase mice (Fig. 2). In the 8–9-month-old transgenic mice, INS-1 mRNA normalized to islet protein was increased ∼3-fold compared with WT of the same age (Fig. 3D, p < 0.01), and insulin content per islet was increased ∼2.6-fold compared with WT (Fig. 3E, p < 0.05). The changes in islet insulin content in the older mice demonstrate an increased ability of the O-GlcNAcase transgenic mice to increase islet insulin as they age: older WT mice (Fig. 3E) increased their islet insulin content <4-fold over the levels observed in the younger mice (Fig. 2B), whereas older O-GlcNAcase mice increased their islet insulin content ∼16-fold. Insulin secretion from isolated islets from the older O-GlcNAcase transgenic mice was also examined; there were no differences between the groups with glucose stimulation, but with KCl, there was no decrease in secretory capacity seen in the O-GlcNAcase mice as had been the case in the younger mice; in fact, the trend was now for higher response than in the WT (119% increase, p = 0.10, data not shown). HOMA-IR values did not differ between the groups (HOMA-IR = 1.5 ± 0.2 in WT, 1.9 ± 0.3 in the transgenics, p = 0.31). Thus, glucose tolerance in the O-GlcNAcase transgenic mice “catches up” with WT mice as they age, a change that is attributable to a reversal of the situation that had been observed in the younger mice, with the older transgenic mice now exhibiting increased fasting insulin levels, β-cell function, and islet insulin content. We next sought to determine possible mechanisms underlying the apparent protection afforded the O-GlcNAc transgenic mice from age-related changes in β-cell function. Islets express high levels of angiogenic factors and islet microvasculature network is essential for β-cell function of glucose sensing and insu"

https://openalex.org/W2018304850,"In the initial step of integration, retroviral integrase (IN) introduces precise nicks in the degenerate, short inverted repeats at the ends of linear viral DNA. The scissile phosphodiester bond is located immediately 3' of a highly conserved CA/GT dinucleotide, usually 2 bp from the ends. These nicks create new recessed 3'-OH viral DNA ends that are required for joining to host cell DNA. Previous studies have indicated that unpairing, ""fraying,"" of the viral DNA ends by IN contributes to end recognition or catalysis. Here, we report that end fraying can be detected independently of catalysis with both avian sarcoma virus (ASV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) IN proteins by use of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The results were indicative of an IN-induced intramolecular conformational change in the viral DNA ends (cis FRET). Fraying activity is tightly coupled to the DNA binding capabilities of these enzymes, as follows: an inhibitor effective against both IN proteins was shown to block ASV IN DNA binding and end fraying, with similar dose responses; ASV IN substitutions that reduced DNA binding also reduced end fraying activity; and HIV-1 IN DNA binding and end fraying were both undetectable in the absence of a metal cofactor. Consistent with our previous results, end fraying is sequence-independent, suggesting that the DNA terminus per se is a major structural determinant for recognition. We conclude that frayed ends represent a functional intermediate in which DNA termini can be sampled for suitability for endonucleolytic processing."

Here, we present a pre- steady-state kinetic analysis establishing that two distinct regions of H69 make critical contributions to substrate selection. The loop of H69 (A1913) forms contacts necessary for the efficient accommodation of a subset of natural tRNA species, whereas the base of the stem (G1922) is specifically critical for UGA codon recognition by the class 1 release factor RF2.

IntroductionThe ribosome is the ribonucleoprotein machine responsible for the faithful translation of the genetic material into the encoded polypeptide. The core RNA components of the ribosome (the 16 S and 23 S rRNA) that reflect its earliest evolution play a key role in interactions that specify the selection of tRNAs and release factors on recognition of sense and stop codons, respectively. During translation elongation, the selection of a cognate ternary complex (composed of aa-tRNA, EFTu, and GTP) from solution is specified primarily in the small ribosomal subunit where three nucleotides in 16 S rRNA directly evaluate the geometry of the codon-anticodon interaction (1Ogle J.M. Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Tarry M.J. Carter A.P. Ramakrishnan V. Science. 2001; 292: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Though different in molecular detail, the selection of class 1 release factors takes place in the same decoding center of the small ribosomal subunit where conserved protein features of the RF engage the stop codon. Thus, for both decoding events, molecular interactions in the small subunit “decoding center” are early and critical contributors to the selection of cognate substrates during the translational cycle.In addition to these interactions in the decoding center, it is believed that other molecular interactions between the ribosome and these substrates contribute to binding and specificity.

This universally conserved helix forms an intersubunit bridge that is proximal to the substrate binding cleft and directly contacts the functionally critical h44 of 16 S rRNA which contains two of the three nucleotides known to directly interact with the decoding helix (codon-anticodon) during tRNA selection (A1492 and A1493).What is the specific nature of these molecular interactions, and what do they suggest about the role of H69 in ribosome function? H69 contacts incoming tRNA in both the pre- and postaccommodation steps near positions 25/26 of the D stem and position 38, located near the anticodon stem; tRNA mutations at these positions are linked to miscoding phenotypes (11Cochella L. Green R. Science. 2005; 308: 1178-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 12Ledoux S. Olejniczak M. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Likewise, the class 1 RFs make extensive contacts with H69 during stop-codon recognition to extend the GGQ domain into the large ribosomal subunit to promote catalysis. A particular metastable helical element referred to as the “switch helix” appears to occupy a cavity in the ribosome that is normally occupied by H69 but that is displaced during stop codon recognition. H69 is heavily modified by the synthase RluD, which pseudouridylates positions 1911, 1915, and 1917 (13Ejby M. Sørensen M.A. Pedersen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19410-19415Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that ribosomes isolated from a strain lacking RluD show defects in the ability of RF2 (but not RF1) to catalyze the release of a peptide on UAA-programmed ribosome complexes (14Kipper K. Sild S. Hetényi C. Remme J. Liiv A. Biochimie. 2011; 93: 834-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Finally, other studies observed large conformational changes in H69 in ribosome structures where ribosome recycling factor is bound, consistent with the idea that movement of the helix plays a critical role in the dissociation reaction that ribosome recycling factor catalyzes (9Pai R.D. Zhang W. Schuwirth B.S. Hirokawa G. Kaji H. Kaji A. Cate J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 376: 1334-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Simple positioning makes H69 an excellent candidate for participation in substrate selection events and overall ribosome function.In an effort to define the contribution of H69 to ribosome function, the properties of ribosomes from which the helix had been deleted were characterized (15Ali I.K. Lancaster L. Feinberg J. Joseph S. Noller H.F. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 865-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although the ΔH69 ribosomes displayed substantial defects in subunit association (and even exhibit ribosome recycling factor-independent recycling) and RF1-mediated catalysis, the particles were surprisingly active in poly-Phe synthesis and displayed only modest defects in accuracy during tRNA selection (the variant ribosomes incorporated ∼2-fold less leucine on the poly-Uridine template). These results were somewhat at odds with the expectation that H69 would be critical to both tRNA and RF selection events mediated at the subunit interface.Genetic screens (16O'Connor M. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2009; 282: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17O'Connor M. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 838-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18Hirabayashi N. Sato N.S. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17203-17211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using in vivo-based reporters for stop codon read-through and frame-shifting had also previously identified several positions of interest in H69. In particular, these studies identified “restrictive” mutations in the terminal loop of the helix (C1914, Ψ1911) based on observed decreases in UGA read-through, and other “ribosomal ambiguity” mutations in the stem (G1922) based on observed increases in UGA read-through. Although these studies highlighted a potential role for H69 in substrate selection events, their genetic nature did not allow for direct evaluation of ribosome function, especially because the read-through assay cannot distinguish between defects in the tRNA and RF selection steps.Here, we examine the role of previously identified key residues in H69 using transient kinetic approaches to isolate and quantify defects in specific steps in the tRNA and RF selection processes. We conclude that although contacts between the loop of H69 (A1913) are not essential for tRNA selection for a majority of tRNA substrates, these contacts are nevertheless critical for acceptance of a subset of natural tRNAs (specifically, tRNAk2CAUIle on the AUA codon and tRNAICGArg on the CGA codon). These tRNAs depend on noncanonical pairings in the third codon position, and we argue that this inherent instability necessitates additional contacts with H69. In other experiments, we find that although contacts between the stem of H69 (G1922) and class 1 RFs are generally not critical to selection, these contacts are specifically essential for facilitating the recognition of UGA codons by RF2. These data argue for a critical role for H69 in the overall fidelity of translation.DISCUSSIONEarly cross-linking studies, structural work on the ribosome, and genetic screens have implicated H69 as playing an important role in tRNA selection during elongation by the ribosome. However, the details of the molecular mechanisms by which H69 influences this process remain poorly understood. Here, we establish a critical role for H69 in tRNA selection and termination by measuring the presteady-state kinetic parameters of several variant ribosomes carrying point mutations in this helix. In particular, the terminal loop of H69 appears to be critical for the recognition of certain tRNA species that depend on noncanonical third position pairing interactions, whereas the stem of H69 appears to be critical specifically for recognition of UGA stop codons by RF2. We suggest that the sensitivity of these particular decoding events (on typically rare codons in E. coli) results from nonoptimal interactions in the decoding center that are supplemented by additional more remote interactions between the ribosome and the substrate.Despite an abundance of structural data placing H69 in a functionally critical region of the ribosome and genetic studies implicating the helix in core ribosome function, the most thorough biochemical study to date found that although H69 contributed substantially to subunit association (and thus recycling) and to termination by RF1, it contributed only modestly to the fidelity of tRNA selection. In this earlier study, using a processive poly-Phe synthesis assay, the authors found that ribosomes lacking H69 are only modestly restrictive in decoding with ∼2-fold decreases in leucine misincorporation. Because this steady-state assay does not isolate the critical steps of tRNA selection, more substantial effects on individual steps in tRNA selection could have been masked by rate-limiting processes that are not affected by the selected ribosomal mutations. Another potential problem with the assay is that it only measures the encounter of the ribosome with two different tRNA substrates (tRNAPhe and tRNALeu) on a single codon (UUU) and, as such, ignores other tRNA-codon interactions that may have different requirements.Other key studies implicated H69 in tRNA selection, largely through genetic screens that identified mutations in the ribosome that affected UGA read-through or frame-shifting on mRNA transcripts that contain a stop codon in the middle of the gene (16O'Connor M. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2009; 282: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17O'Connor M. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 838-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18Hirabayashi N. Sato N.S. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17203-17211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). One class of mutations discovered in these studies clustered in the terminal loop of H69 (C1914, Ψ1911) and generally exhibited slightly decreased rates of UGA read-through; as a representative of this class of mutation, we mutated residue A1913 as it also appears to be located in a functionally critical location. Another class of H69 mutation uncovered by genetic screens was located in the stem of H69. Mutations in this region (G1922, G1921) exhibit very strong UGA read-through phenotypes; as a representative of this class of mutation, we mutated G1922 (Fig. 1). The importance of H69 as a critical component of ribosome function is hinted at in these studies as they find that a number of point mutations in the region exhibit lethal and severe slow growth phenotypes. By measuring rates of tRNA and RF selection under varied conditions with multiple substrates, we define the underlying ribosome defect that results in distinct differences in UGA read-through for the chosen simple base substitutions (A1913U, G1922A) in H69. In particular, we were interested in knowing whether a strong UGA read-through phenotype in reporter assays in vivo arises because of increases in the rate of incorporation of tRNATrp or because of decreases in the activity of RF2.Although our earlier studies had suggested that an intact H69 provided additional stabilization to certain near-cognate miscoding events during tRNA selection (21Ortiz-Meoz R.F. Green R. RNA. 2010; 16: 2002-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), our results here indicate that H69 plays a key role in facilitating “normal” codon-anticodon interactions during translation. It is well known that the first two mRNA codon positions are deciphered by the ribosome through strict Watson-Crick RNA base pairs. Decoding of the third position is known to be less stringent, allowing a certain breadth of noncanonical interactions. These noncanonical interactions principally include so called “wobble” pairing with G-U and U-G base pairs being the most common example (exemplified in this study by tRNAPhe on the UUC and UUU codons, respectively). Other wobble interactions include more heavily modified bases such as queosine (a modified G) (as in tRNATyr, which decodes UAU and UAC), or uridine-5-oxyacetic acid (as in tRNAcmo5UGCAla, which decodes GCA and GCG). The ribosome variants characterized in this study (A1913U and G1922A) did not distinguish between these particular noncanonical third position pairing interactions and other more canonical WC pairing interactions (Table 1 and supplemental Table S1).Other known third position pairing interactions, however, appear to rely more heavily on the identity of A1913 of H69, as indicated by the defects reported on in Fig. 3, A and B. The well characterized wobble interactions with the post-transcriptionally modified nucleotide inosine that decodes C, U, and A residues at the third codon position is one such example (25Curran J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although the third position C and U (CGC and CGU) are decoded through the purine-pyrimidine interactions I-C and I-U with tRNAICGArg, the third position A (CGA) is decoded through a purine-purine interaction, I-A, which results in a significantly wide base pair in the decoding helix (26Murphy 4th, F.V. Ramakrishnan V. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1251-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Another example is the AUA codon in E. coli, decoded by tRNAk2CAUIle, which contains a lysidine (k2C) residue in its anticodon (5′-k2CAU-3′). The addition of this lysine moiety to the cytidine residue in the first position of the anticodon changes the specificity of tRNAk2CAUIle from AUG to AUA (27Muramatsu T. Nishikawa K. Nemoto F. Kuchino Y. Nishimura S. Miyazawa T. Yokoyama S. Nature. 1988; 336: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Though little work has focused on this particular modification, a similar change also appears to be critical for the proper decoding of AUA in archaea (28Ikeuchi Y. Kimura S. Numata T. Nakamura D. Yokogawa T. Ogata T. Wada T. Suzuki T. Suzuki T. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For both of these examples, A1913U variant ribosomes are compromised in their ability to select these tRNA species for accommodation into the ribosome.The dependence of these two inherently weak codon-anticodon interactions on the terminal loop of H69 for efficient acceptance into the ribosome leads to interesting questions about the mechanism by which the ribosome achieves uniformity of tRNA selection (29Ledoux S. Uhlenbeck O.C. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 114-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). When a rare AUA or CGA codon (Table 1) is encountered by a translating ribosome, interactions other than those determined by decoding center residues (A1493, A1492, G530) are apparently necessary for efficient accommodation of the incoming tRNA. Indeed, even when the H69 interactions are intact (with a WT ribosome), we measure increased rates of rejection (k7) of tRNAICGArg on the CGA codon, an observation consistent with recent reports in Saccharomyces cerevisiae identifying the inherently weak nature of the CGA codon (30Letzring D.P. Dean K.M. Grayhack E.J. RNA. 2010; 16: 2516-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Overall, as the accommodation defects that we observe in A1913U ribosomes are of a magnitude comparable to those observed when the small subunit decoding residues (1493, 1492, 530) are themselves mutated (31Cochella L. Brunelle J.L. Green R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we propose that the terminal loop of H69 functions as a critical core component in tRNA selection on the ribosome.Another interesting observation emerging from our studies is that the variant H69 ribosomes appear to have no defects in GTPase activation, though it is generally thought that increased rates of GTPase activation and accommodation are triggered by common structural signals in the decoding center (22Gromadski K.B. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Although there are numerous examples in the literature where both GTPase activation and accommodation are similarly affected by a miscoding tRNA (11Cochella L. Green R. Science. 2005; 308: 1178-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 12Ledoux S. Olejniczak M. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we have recently shown that a mutation in the elbow region of tRNATrp-G59A stimulates accommodation, but not GTPase activation, on a near-cognate codon (21Ortiz-Meoz R.F. Green R. RNA. 2010; 16: 2002-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this variant tRNA also depends on H69 residue A1913 to stimulate this accommodation step. Recent structural work on tRNATrp miscoding variants in the A/T state has argued that miscoding depends on the formation of hydrogen bonding interactions in the tRNA core and not on altered contacts with the ribosome (32Schmeing T.M. Voorhees R.M. Kelley A.C. Ramakrishnan V. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These data argue for a H69-specific contribution to accommodation (but not to GTPase activation) with special sensitivity to the third position discrimination.RF selection is in many ways similar to tRNA selection wherein large scale conformational rearrangements triggered by interactions in the decoding center of the small subunit lead to optimal catalysis in the large subunit (19Youngman E.M. He S.L. Nikstad L.J. Green R. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 33He S.L. Green R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the signals that lead to these outcomes are clearly somewhat different because they depend on protein-RNA rather than RNA-RNA interactions in the decoding center (6Korostelev A. Zhu J. Asahara H. Noller H.F. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 2577-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 8Weixlbaumer A. Jin H. Neubauer C. Voorhees R.M. Petry S. Kelley A.C. Ramakrishnan V. Science. 2008; 322: 953-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 34Korostelev A. Asahara H. Lancaster L. Laurberg M. Hirschi A. Zhu J. Trakhanov S. Scott W.G. Noller H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19684-19689Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). One likely critical difference is the stacking interaction that forms between A1913 of H69 and A1493 of H44 when cognate interactions in the decoding center are sensed. Interestingly, we show here that A1913U ribosomes have no apparent defect in interactions with RF1 or RF2 on authentic stop codons, suggesting that the requisite stacking interaction may not depend on the identity of the nucleotide found at position 1913 but only on the presence of some nucleotide that can stack. Earlier studies similarly showed that mutation of A1493 had no effect on RF recognition and catalysis on authentic stop codons (19Youngman E.M. He S.L. Nikstad L.J. Green R. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).How then do we rationalize the defects in RF recognition by G1922A ribosomes where the mutation of interest appears to be more structurally remote from presumed critical contacts at the decoding center? We notice that for A1913 to stack with residue A1493 of the decoding center, H69 must undergo a relatively large conformational change which results in the formation of a new pocket within the ribosome core that cradles (and undoubtedly stabilizes) the so-called “switch” loop that forms in an extended conformation of the RF. Because of the proximity of G1922 to this switch loop pocket, we speculate that G1922A ribosomes are compromised in their ability to stabilize the extended conformation of RF2 bound to the ribosome (Fig. 4B). The specificity of the defects, observed only with RF2-UGA interactions, can perhaps be attributed to subtle differences observed on comparing the switch loop regions of RF1 and RF2 (34Korostelev A. Asahara H. Lancaster L. Laurberg M. Hirschi A. Zhu J. Trakhanov S. Scott W.G. Noller H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19684-19689Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). For example, RF2 is seen to make additional contacts with H69 residues 1914 and 1915 (8Weixlbaumer A. Jin H. Neubauer C. Voorhees R.M. Petry S. Kelley A.C. Ramakrishnan V. Science. 2008; 322: 953-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and these might be somewhat destabilized on interaction with the UGA-programmed ribosome complex. Whatever the cause, the specific deficiencies that we observe in the G1922A ribosomes are consistent with multiple earlier reports of RF-related deficiencies with H69 variant ribosomes (14Kipper K. Sild S. Hetényi C. Remme J. Liiv A. Biochimie. 2011; 93: 834-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 15Ali I.K. Lancaster L. Feinberg J. Joseph S. Noller H.F. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 865-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 16O'Connor M. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2009; 282: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).A thorough biochemical examination of specific ribosome variants and the defects associated with recognition of certain “cognate” interactions by tRNAs and RFs has allowed us to identify a role for H69 in both tRNA accommodation and RF2 function. This study highlights how individual mRNA codons are distinctly dealt with by the translational machinery and discovers a new mechanism that the ribosome employs to ensure uniformity in tRNA selection. Perturbation of this mechanism slows down the rates of incorporation of natural tRNA substrates on the AUA and CGA codons, at a minimum, and the rate of peptide release on the UGA codon. These findings not only shed light on the mechanism of ribosomal codon recognition but may also prove useful in manipulating the ribosomal machinery to accept foreign amino acids into codons that were deemed previously inaccessible or inefficient. IntroductionThe ribosome is the ribonucleoprotein machine responsible for the faithful translation of the genetic material into the encoded polypeptide. The core RNA components of the ribosome (the 16 S and 23 S rRNA) that reflect its earliest evolution play a key role in interactions that specify the selection of tRNAs and release factors on recognition of sense and stop codons, respectively. During translation elongation, the selection of a cognate ternary complex (composed of aa-tRNA, EFTu, and GTP) from solution is specified primarily in the small ribosomal subunit where three nucleotides in 16 S rRNA directly evaluate the geometry of the codon-anticodon interaction (1Ogle J.M. Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Tarry M.J. Carter A.P. Ramakrishnan V. Science. 2001; 292: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Though different in molecular detail, the selection of class 1 release factors takes place in the same decoding center of the small ribosomal subunit where conserved protein features of the RF engage the stop codon. Thus, for both decoding events, molecular interactions in the small subunit “decoding center” are early and critical contributors to the selection of cognate substrates during the translational cycle.In addition to these interactions in the decoding center, it is believed that other molecular interactions between the ribosome and these substrates contribute to binding and specificity.

H69 contacts incoming tRNA in both the pre- and postaccommodation steps near positions 25/26 of the D stem and position 38, located near the anticodon stem; tRNA mutations at these positions are linked to miscoding phenotypes (11Cochella L. Green R. Science. 2005; 308: 1178-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 12Ledoux S. Olejniczak M. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Likewise, the class 1 RFs make extensive contacts with H69 during stop-codon recognition to extend the GGQ domain into the large ribosomal subunit to promote catalysis. A particular metastable helical element referred to as the “switch helix” appears to occupy a cavity in the ribosome that is normally occupied by H69 but that is displaced during stop codon recognition. H69 is heavily modified by the synthase RluD, which pseudouridylates positions 1911, 1915, and 1917 (13Ejby M. Sørensen M.A. Pedersen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Recent studies have shown that ribosomes isolated from a strain lacking RluD show defects in the ability of RF2 (but not RF1) to catalyze the release of a peptide on UAA-programmed ribosome complexes (14Kipper K. Sild S. Hetényi C. Remme J. Liiv A. Biochimie. 2011; 93: 834-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Finally, other studies observed large conformational changes in H69 in ribosome structures where ribosome recycling factor is bound, consistent with the idea that movement of the helix plays a critical role in the dissociation reaction that ribosome recycling factor catalyzes (9Pai R.D.

Simple positioning makes H69 an excellent candidate for participation in substrate selection events and overall ribosome function.In an effort to define the contribution of H69 to ribosome function, the properties of ribosomes from which the helix had been deleted were characterized (15Ali I.K.

Although the ΔH69 ribosomes displayed substantial defects in subunit association (and even exhibit ribosome recycling factor-independent recycling) and RF1-mediated catalysis, the particles were surprisingly active in poly-Phe synthesis and displayed only modest defects in accuracy during tRNA selection (the variant ribosomes incorporated ∼2-fold less leucine on the poly-Uridine template). These results were somewhat at odds with the expectation that H69 would be critical to both tRNA and RF selection events mediated at the subunit interface.Genetic screens (16O'Connor M. Mol. Genet.

In particular, these studies identified “restrictive” mutations in the terminal loop of the helix (C1914, Ψ1911) based on observed decreases in UGA read-through, and other “ribosomal ambiguity” mutations in the stem (G1922) based on observed increases in UGA read-through. Although these studies highlighted a potential role for H69 in substrate selection events, their genetic nature did not allow for direct evaluation of ribosome function, especially because the read-through assay cannot distinguish between defects in the tRNA and RF selection steps.Here, we examine the role of previously identified key residues in H69 using transient kinetic approaches to isolate and quantify defects in specific steps in the tRNA and RF selection processes. We conclude that although contacts between the loop of H69 (A1913) are not essential for tRNA selection for a majority of tRNA substrates, these contacts are nevertheless critical for acceptance of a subset of natural tRNAs (specifically, tRNAk2CAUIle on the AUA codon and tRNAICGArg on the CGA codon). These tRNAs depend on noncanonical pairings in the third codon position, and we argue that this inherent instability necessitates additional contacts with H69. In other experiments, we find that although contacts between the stem of H69 (G1922) and class 1 RFs are generally not critical to selection, these contacts are specifically essential for facilitating the recognition of UGA codons by RF2. These data argue for a critical role for H69 in the overall fidelity of translation."
https://openalex.org/W2011112523,"Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) is expressed in two lineages of the pituitary, the anterior lobe corticotrophs and the intermediate lobe melanotrophs. POMC expression in these two lineages is highly dependent on the cell-restricted transcription factor Tpit. As Tpit intervenes relatively late in differentiation of those lineages, we have been searching for other transcription factors that may participate in their gene expression program. On the basis of similarity with the Tpit expression profile, we identified Ets variant gene 1 (Etv1/Er81) as a putative POMC transcription factor. Using Etv1-lacZ knockin mice, we describe preferential Etv1 expression in pituitary POMC cells and also in posterior lobe pituicytes. We further show that Etv1 enhances POMC transcription on its own and in synergy with Tpit. The Ets-binding site located within the Tpit/Pitx regulatory element is necessary for Etv1 activity in POMC-expressing AtT-20 cells but dispensable for synergy with Tpit. Etv1 and Tpit interact together in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Furthermore, Etv1 is present at the POMC promoter, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of Etv1 in AtT-20 cells produces a significant decrease in POMC expression. Etv1 knockout pituitaries show normal POMC cell distribution and normal POMC mRNA abundance, suggesting compensation by other factors. The coordinate expression of Etv1 with POMC cell differentiation and its interaction with the highly cell-restricted Tpit factor indicate that Etv1 participates in a combinatorial code for pituitary cell-specific gene expression.

The adult rodent pituitary consists of three lobes. The posterior lobe contains mainly axonal projections from the hypothalamus and supporting pituicytes, whereas the intermediate and anterior lobes together enclose six distinct secretory cell types. Two of these lineages express pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), 2The abbreviations used are: POMCpro-opiomelanocortinALanterior lobeαMSHmelanostimulinILintermediate lobeE12.5embryonic day 12.5PRLprolactinLHluteinizing hormoneP0postnatal day 0QPCRquantitative PCRCRHcorticotropin-releasing hormoneEGFPenhanced GFP. a precursor protein that is processed into ACTH in corticotrophs of the anterior lobe (AL) and melanostimulin (αMSH) in intermediate lobe (IL) melanotrophs. Corticotroph cells are the first to differentiate at about day 12.5 of embryonic development (E12.5) in mice. At E14.5, definitive thyrotrophs start expressing thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and melanotrophs turn on POMC expression. At about E15.5, somatotrophs express growth hormone (GH). Lactotrophs and gonadotrophs are the latest cells to differentiate, respectively expressing prolactin (PRL) at E16.5 and gonadotropins (FSH and LH) from E17.5 (1Japón M.A. Rubinstein M. Low M.J. J.

Cell-specific transcription of hormone-coding genes relies on combinatorial expression of cell-specific and pituitary-specific transcription factors (for review, see Ref. 2Drouin J. Melmed S. The Pituitary. Elsevier Academic Press, New York2010: 3-19Google Scholar). Among these, the Pitx1 and Pitx2 factors were shown to be important, but possibly redundant with each other, for transcription of most pituitary hormone-coding genes (3Tremblay J.J. Lanctôt C. Drouin J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 428-441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Tremblay J.J. Goodyer C.G. Drouin J. Neuroendocrinology. 2000; 71: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The Pitx are bicoid-related factors of the paired homeodomain subfamily that are expressed from e8 in the presumptive oral ectoderm (stomodeum). Their expression is required for pituitary development and is maintained in adult tissues. Inactivation of the Pitx2 gene leads to arrest of pituitary development at the Rathke's pouch stage (5Gage P.J. Suh H. Camper S.A.

Both homeodomain factors recognize the same response element and activate transcription at the gene promoters of POMC, α subunit of glycoprotein hormone, β-FSH, βLH, β subunit of thyroid stimulating hormone, PRL, and growth hormone. They act as pan-pituitary regulators of transcription and interact with cell-restricted factors such as Pit1 (9Li S. Crenshaw 3rd, E.B. Rawson E.J. Simmons D.M. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G.

Cell. 2001; 104: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) to activate promoter-specific transcription. Our laboratory previously defined the roles of NeuroD1 and Tpit in POMC cell-specific expression and cell differentiation. NeuroD1 is a neurogenic basic helix-loop-helix factor of the atonal subfamily, originally isolated as β2, a cell-specific transcription factor of the insulin gene (13Naya F.J. Stellrecht C.M. Tsai M.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). We documented NeuroD1 expression in corticotroph cells and defined its interactions with Tpit and Pitx1 (11Poulin G. Lebel M. Chamberland M. Paradis F.W. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4826-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 14Lamolet B. Poulin G. Chu K. Guillemot F. Tsai M.J. Drouin J. Mol.

Corticotroph expression of NeuroD1 is strongest between E12.5 and E15.5, and adult NeuroD1-null pituitaries contain a normal number of corticotrophs. However, POMC expression is delayed in NeuroD1-deficient mice, consistent with the developmental window of NeuroD1 expression in corticotrophs. This differentiation delay does not reflect a change of corticotroph commitment, as Tpit expression remains unchanged. NeuroD1 activates POMC transcription through dimer formation with various ubiquitous basic helix-loop-helix partners. It specifically recognizes and activates transcription from the POMC promoter Eboxneuro that confers transcriptional specificity. The in vivo importance of this promoter element was recently shown in transgenic mice (16Lavoie P.L. Budry L. Balsalobre A. Drouin J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 1647-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Tpit, a T-box containing transcription factor, was identified as a highly restricted T-box factor present in POMC-expressing AtT-20 cells, a corticotroph cell model (12Lamolet B. Pulichino A.M. Lamonerie T. Gauthier Y. Brue T. Enjalbert A. Drouin J. Cell. 2001; 104: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). POMC transcription requires cooperation between Tpit and Pitx1, the two factors binding to contiguous sites within the same regulatory element. In gain of function experiments, Tpit induces POMC expression in undifferentiated pituitary cells, indicating that it can initiate differentiation into POMC-expressing lineages (17Pulichino A.M. Vallette-Kasic S. Tsai J.P. Couture C. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TPIT gene mutations were found in patients with isolated deficiency of pituitary POMC-derived ACTH (12Lamolet B. Pulichino A.M. Lamonerie T. Gauthier Y. Brue T. Enjalbert A. Drouin J.

The essential role of Tpit for differentiation of pituitary POMC lineages was ascertained in Tpit knockout mice that exhibit an almost complete loss of pituitary POMC-expressing cells (17Pulichino A.M. Vallette-Kasic S. Tsai J.P. Couture C. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In these mice, the bulk of cells destined to become corticotrophs or melanotrophs remain undifferentiated, but a small number switch cell fate to become bona fide gonadotrophs (17Pulichino A.M. Vallette-Kasic S. Tsai J.P. Couture C. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, a small number of Tpit−/− pituitary cells do express POMC (17Pulichino A.M. Vallette-Kasic S. Tsai J.P. Couture C. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 20Bilodeau S. Roussel-Gervais A. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 1895-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), suggesting that other transcription factors may also contribute to cell-specific expression of POMC. The goal of this work was to identify transcription factors that may contribute to POMC expression and that could positively influence melanotroph and corticotroph differentiation. Using developmental expression profiling on microarrays, we identified Etv1 (also known as Er81), an Ets-domain containing factor of the PEA3 subfamily (for review, see Refs. 21de Launoit Y. Baert J.L. Chotteau-Lelievre A. Monte D. Coutte L. Mauen S. Firlej V. Degerny C. Verreman K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1766: 79-87PubMed Google Scholar and 22Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Duval D.L. Bradford A.P. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 18: 150-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), as a novel activator of POMC expression with a Tpit-like pituitary expression profile. Indeed, the present report describes Etv1 expression in pituitary IL melanotrophs and in anterior lobe corticotroph cells but not in other endocrine lineages. Etv1 binds to and activates transcription from the POMC promoter through the Tpit/Pitx1 response element. There it collaborates with Tpit and Pitx1 for transcriptional activation mainly through protein-protein interaction with Tpit. Consistently, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Etv1 significantly diminished POMC expression in AtT-20 cells, illustrating its importance for full transcriptional activity. However, Etv1 knockout mice display normal POMC cell and POMC mRNA content, suggesting a possible compensation by other related factors. These studies showed that Ets transcription factors participate in pituitary POMC expression. Etv1-lacZ mice were described previously (23Arber S. Ladle D.R. Lin J.H. Frank E. Jessell T.M. Cell. 2000; 101: 485-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) and generously provided by Dr. T. Jessel (Columbia University, NY). Animal experimentation was approved by the Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montréal Animal Ethics Review Committee. For embryonic tissues, the morning when a vaginal plug was detected was considered E0.5. For postnatal tissues, day of birth was considered P0. Pregnant mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and embryos were isolated for dissection. The β-galactosidase activity was revealed as described (17Pulichino A.M. Vallette-Kasic S. Tsai J.P. Couture C. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Tissues were then post-fixed for 6 h and incubated in 20% sucrose containing PBS for cryoprotection. On the following days, they were imbedded in OCT compound (Sakura) and frozen on 99% EtOH-saturated dry ice. Histology blocks were stored at −80 °C until used to prepare 10-μm sections stained with nuclear fast red. Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections as described (24Lanctôt C. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1416-1422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Tpit antibody was described previously (12Lamolet B. Pulichino A.M. Lamonerie T. Gauthier Y. Brue T. Enjalbert A. Drouin J. Cell. 2001; 104: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Antibodies were used at the following dilutions: rabbit anti-Pit1, 1:1000; rabbit anti-SF1, 1:100; rabbit anti-Etv1, 1:1000 (Abcam, ab36788); and rabbit anti-Etv5, 1:100 (X. Sun, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). For rabbit antibodies, slides were incubated with a biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody (Vector) and revealed with HRP or Alexa Fluor 488-coupled streptavidin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Mouse anti-POMC (Cortex Biochem) was used at 1:100, and detection was performed using HRP-coupled anti-mouse antibody (Sigma). HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. AtT-20 cells were grown in the same conditions unless indicated otherwise. For both cell types, 250,000 cells/well were plated in 12-well plates. HEK293 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (25Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y1982Google Scholar). Each well was transfected with 1 μg of reporter construct along with varying amounts of expression vectors completed to equal amounts with empty vector. AtT-20 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Transfection experiments were performed in duplicates, and luciferase activity was measured 48 h post-transfection. Cells were lysed in 100 mm Tris (pH 8) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Luciferin (Gold Biotechnology) was added to cell lysates at a final concentration of 0.5 mm before measurement of relative light units on a Glomax 96 luminometer (Promega). Data are presented as means ± S.E. of three to five separate experiments. Student's t test was used to assess statistical significance. The different reporter plasmids constructed in vector pXP1-luciferase were described previously (12Lamolet B. Pulichino A.M. Lamonerie T. Gauthier Y. Brue T. Enjalbert A. Drouin J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5952-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Full-length coding sequences of mouse Etv1 were amplified from AtT-20-derived cDNA and cloned in the pLNCX2 expression vector (Clontech). Expression vectors for mouse Tpit and Pitx1 were obtained using the same strategy, starting with plasmids described previously (12Lamolet B. Pulichino A.M. Lamonerie T. Gauthier Y. Brue T. Enjalbert A. Drouin J. Cell. 2001; 104: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The flagged form of Etv1 was obtained by subcloning the wild-type version into a modified pLNCX2 containing three copies of the FLAG sequence at the 5′ end of the insert. All expression plasmids were sequenced. Petri dishes (10 cm) were seeded with 7 × 106 HEK293 cells and transfected by the calcium phosphate method the next day for 8 h with 5 μg of each expression vector. Cells were harvested the following day, washed in PBS, pelleted, washed in 5 volumes, and then resuspended in two volumes of low-salt buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Samples were kept on ice for 5 min, and Nonidet P-40 was added at a final concentration of 0.1%. The mix was reincubated on ice for 5 min before addition of 1 volume of high-salt buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 6 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm KCl, 20% glycerol) and then left on ice for 30 min with occasional agitation. Lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. 1.5 mg of protein from the supernatant was then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C for immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG beads (Sigma). Beads were then washed four times in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm EDTA by quick inversion. Beads were boiled in 2.5% loading buffer, and SDS-PAGE was performed (18Vallette-Kasic S. Couture C. Balsalobre A. Gauthier Y. Metherell L.A. Dattani M. Drouin J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 92: 3991-3999Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After transfer, PVDF membranes (Millipore) were blotted with antibodies against FLAG M2 (Sigma) and Tpit or Pitx1 antibody (24Lanctôt C. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1416-1422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The signal was revealed using the TrueBlot system (eBioscience). Knockdown of Etv1 and Etv5 was performed using onTARGET SMARTpool siRNA against Etv1 and/or Etv5 and a control non-target siRNA pool (Dharmacon). AtT-20 cells were plated in 6-well plates (500,000 cells/well) and transfected in triplicates with siRNAs the following day using Lipofectamine. RNA was collected using the RNeasy mini extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and protein extracts were prepared for Western blot analysis. Direct read-out of mRNA abundance was assessed using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). The primers used were as follows: TATA-binding protein (TBP), 5′-TCTTGGCTCCTGTGCACACCATTT-3′ and 5′-CCGTGAATCTTGGCTGTAAACTTGACC-3′; Etv1, 5′-ATGGCTTGCTGAAGCTCAGGTAC-3′ and 5′-GCTGCTCTTGACTGCAAGCAGAC-3′; Etv5, 5′-TTTGATCTTGGTGGGAGGTGGAG-3′ and 5′-CTGATGATGAGCAGTTTGTCCCAG-3′; and POMC, 5′-GATGCAAGCCAGCAGGTTGCTCTC-3′ and 5′-TGGAAGATGCCGAGATTCTGCTACAGT-3′. Reactions were performed in triplicates on a MX-3005p (Stratagene), and quantitation was done using the accompanying software. Efficacy of protein knockdown was verified using total protein extracts. Briefly, cells were rinsed in PBS, harvested, and resuspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT, and 20% glycerol. Samples were frozen on dry ice, thawed on ice, and centrifuged. From the supernatant, 50 μg of protein was submitted to SDS-PAGE. After transfer, PVDF membranes (Millipore) were blotted with rabbit antibodies against Etv1, Etv5, and Tpit. Signal detection was revealed using ECL reagents (GE Healthcare). AtT-20 cells were grown to 60–70% confluence, and ChIP was performed as described previously (28Langlais D. Couture C. Balsalobre A. Drouin J. PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000224Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Sonicated chromatin was immunoprecipitated with serum of rabbits immunized with Etv1 protein (23Arber S. Ladle D.R. Lin J.H. Frank E. Jessell T.M. Cell. 2000; 101: 485-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), and preimmune serum was used as control. Precipitated DNA was collected using protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washes and de-cross-linking, DNA was purified using QIAquick columns following the manufacturer's directives. Specific enrichment at the POMC promoter was assessed relative to the MyoD promoter used as control reference by QPCR with QuantiTect SYBR Green (Qiagen). The primers used were as follows: MyoD, 5′-TGCTCCTTTGAGACAGCAGA-3′ and 5′-TTTCAGGAGGGCTCCCATGT-3′ and POMC, 5′-AAGGCAGATGGACGCACATA-3′ and 5′-CACTTAGAACTGGACAGAGGCT-3′. EGFP-positive cells were obtained from POMC-EGFP mice (16Lavoie P.L. Budry L. Balsalobre A. Drouin J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 1647-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using the following procedure. Briefly, adult males were killed by dislocation, and the neurointermediate and anterior pituitary lobes were collected separately in DMEM/F12 1:1 medium containing 0.3% BSA and 200 units/ml DNaseI (Invitrogen). Trypsin was added at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml, and scalpel-minced pituitaries were dispersed at 37 °C in a hybridization oven for 30 min. Proteolysis was then stopped by adding FBS at a final concentration of 10%. The cell suspension was washed in 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 0.22 mm KH2PO4, 0.13 mm Na2HPO4●2H2O, 10 mm HEPES (pH6), and 5.6 mm glucose, supplemented with BME essential amino acids (Sigma). The first and second washes contained 2 mm EDTA and 1 mm EDTA, respectively. Samples were filtered on a 100-μm cell strainer (BD Falcon), and cells were sorted in ice-cold PBS containing 2% FBS. Total RNA was prepared from EGFP-positive cells using the RNeasy mini extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. cDNA was synthesized using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and purified using QIAquick columns following the manufacturer's directives. QPCR was performed using QuantiTect SYBR Green (Qiagen). The primers used were the ones mentioned above and the following: Etv2, 5′-ACT ACA CCA CCA CGT GGA ATA CTG-3′ and 5′-AGG AGG AAT TGC CAC AGC TGA ATG-3′ and Etv4, 5′ TAC CGG ACA GTG ATG AGC AGT TTG-3′ and 5′-GGA GTA AAG GCA CTG CTC TCC ATG-3′. In an attempt to identify new regulatory factors of pituitary development, we used expression arrays to analyze RNA from E10, E12, E14, and E16 embryonic pituitaries along with samples prepared from adult (P35) AL and IL. Detailed analyses of these experiments will be described elsewhere. 3L. Budry, A. Balsalobre, and J. Drouin, manuscript in preparation. Using pattern recognition analyses, we screened this expression profiling database for transcription factors that display an expression pattern resembling that of Tpit (Fig. 1A). We rapidly focused on Etv1, an Ets-containing DNA-binding factor, because expression of the gene is similar to Tpit both in the developmental sequence and in established pituitary lineages (Fig. 1B). Indeed, Etv1 is highly expressed in AtT-20 cells but undetectable in αT3, LβT2, or GH3 cells. These data were confirmed using quantitative PCR (data not shown) and by histological analyses of Etv1-lacZ mice (originally described as Er81-nlslacZ) (23Arber S. Ladle D.R. Lin J.H. Frank E. Jessell T.M. Cell. 2000; 101: 485-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Compared with Tpit, the developmental profile of pituitary Etv1 expression was higher at E10 and E12 (Fig. 1A), and this early expression appeared to be in the forming posterior lobe (C). In fact, expression of Etv1-lacZ in Rathke's pouch derivatives can only be detected at E16.5 in both IL and AL, and this was confirmed by immunohistochemistry with an anti-Etv1 antibody (Fig. 1C). In the adult pituitary, all melanotroph cells of the IL were lacZ-positive (Fig. 1D). In the AL, Tpit-expressing corticotrophs were also lacZ-positive, although Tpit and Etv1 colocalization was not complete (Fig. 1D). In fact, about 60–65% Tpit-positive cells were also Etv1-positive, and conversely, only about 50% of Etv1-positive cells were Tpit-positive (Fig. 1D, insets). This suggested that Etv1 may be expressed in other pituitary cells. These cells are most probably not endocrine because β-galactosidase staining did not colocalize with either Pit1 or SF1, two markers that, together with Tpit, stain all hormone-producing cells of the pituitary (Fig. 1D). These Etv1-positive cells may thus be support cells (pituicytes), as they are likely to be in the posterior lobe (29Allaerts W. Vankelecom H. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2005; 153: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The PEA3 group of Ets transcription factors are transcriptional activators (21de Launoit Y. Baert J.L. Chotteau-Lelievre A. Monte D. Coutte L. Mauen S. Firlej V. Degerny C. Verreman K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1766: 79-87PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Duval D.L. Bradford A.P. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 18: 150-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Etv1 activated the full-length (-480/+63 bp) POMC promoter in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2A). Etv1 did not activate the minimal (-34/+63 bp) POMC promoter, indicating that Etv1 acted on upstream regulatory sequences. Consistent with the short Ets consensus DNA binding site (GGAA/T), the corresponding promoter region contains many putative Ets-binding sites. Ets factors generally display weak sequence specificity. They rather bind to their target sites in cooperation with other DNA-binding partners (30Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 213-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In view of the Tpit-like expression pattern of Etv1, we focused our attention on regulatory elements that confer cell-specific expression to POMC. Two predicted Ets-binding sites are present within POMC cell-specific regulatory elements: one within the NurRE/Eboxneuro response element (16Lavoie P.L. Budry L. Balsalobre A. Drouin J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 1647-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and the other within the Tpit/Pitx response element (Tpit/PitxRE) (12Lamolet B. Pulichino A.M. Lamonerie T. Gauthier Y. Brue T. Enjalbert A. Drouin J. Cell. 2001; 104: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). We tested Etv1 action on reporters containing multimers of these two regulatory element in POMC-expressing AtT-20 cells and found that Etv1 increased transcription from the Tpit/PitxRE but not from the NurRE/Eboxneuro (Fig. 2B). This result identified an Etv1 target site within the Tpit/PitxRE and prompted us to study its role with regard to POMC transcription and particularly in relation to Tpit and Pitx activity. To determine the importance of DNA interactions for Etv1 activity, we used a version of the Tpit/PitxRE reporter construct bearing a mutated Ets-binding site (Fig. 2C). Basal transcription of the Ets mutant reporter was reduced to almost one third of the wild-type reporter (Fig. 2D), underscoring the contribution of this promoter element to transcriptional activity in AtT-20 cells. Furthermore, the mutation ablated the response to increasing doses of Etv1 (Fig. 2E). Thus, the Ets-binding site within the Tpit/PitxRE is a target of Etv1, and action of Etv1 on this element is DNA-dependent in POMC-expressing AtT-20 cells. We showed previously that the Tpit/PitxRE confers responsiveness to CRH (31Maira M. Couture C. Le Martelot G. Pulichino A.M. Bilodeau S. Drouin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46523-46532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We therefore tested a putative role of Etv1 as a downstream mediator of CRH signaling on the Tpit/PitxRE. The Tpit/PitxRE reporter showed increased transcriptional activity in response to CRH (Fig. 2F) or forskolin (data not shown). However, this increase was similar in both control and Etv1-stimulated cells as well as with the Ets site mutant (Fig. 2G), indicating that Etv1 is not limiting for full CRH/forskolin response and that it likely does not participate in this pathway. The proximity of binding sites led us to test the combinatorial actions of Etv1, Tpit, and Pitx1 on Tpit/PitxRE-dependent transcription. Etv1 and Tpit synergistically enhanced transcription of the reporter, whereas Etv1 and Pitx1 only produced additive effects (Fig. 3A). The synergistic activity of Tpit and Pitx was also further enhanced by Etv1, indicating that the three proteins cooperate for maximal activity of the Tpit/PitxRE. We th"

https://openalex.org/W2009058897,"Presenilin (PS), a causative molecule of familial Alzheimer disease, acts as a crucial component of the γ-secretase complex, which is required to cleave type I transmembrane proteins such as amyloid precursor protein and Notch. However, it also functions through γ-secretase-independent pathways. Recent reports suggested that PS could regulate the expression level of cell surface receptors, including the PDGF and EGF receptors, followed by modulating their downstream pathways via γ-secretase-independent mechanisms. The main purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of PS on expression of the insulin receptor (IR) as well as on insulin signaling. Here, we demonstrate that PS inhibited IR transcription and reduced IR expression, and this was followed by down-regulation of insulin signaling. Moreover, we suggest that neither γ-secretase activity nor Wnt/β-catenin signaling can reduce the expression of IR, but a PS-mediated increase in the intracellular Ca(2+) level can be associated with it. These results clearly indicate that PS can functionally regulate insulin signaling by controlling IR expression."

Dendrite development is an important process in neural development. Apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons, the major sites for these neurons to receive excitatory inputs, exhibit a stereotypic orientation toward the pial surface. Neural adhesion molecules NB-3 and CHL1 regulate apical dendrite orientation in the mouse visual cortex (25Ye H. Tan Y.L. Ponniah S. Takeda Y. Wang S.Q. Schachner M. Watanabe K. Pallen C.J. Xiao Z.C.

Neuron. 2004; 44: 423-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). NB-3 belongs to the contactin subgroup of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily (27Ogawa J. Kaneko H. Masuda T. Nagata S. Hosoya H. Watanabe K. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 218: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Like other contactin family members, NB-3 contains six Ig-like domains and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats. It lacks a transmembrane and intracellular domain and is anchored at the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) link. NB-3 forms a co-receptor complex with CHL1, an L1 family cell adhesion molecule, in developing neurons. Knocking out either Nb-3 or Chl1 genes in mice leads to abnormal apical dendrite orientation in layer V of the caudal cortex, indicating that both are important for apical dendrite development (25Ye H. Tan Y.L. Ponniah S. Takeda Y. Wang S.Q. Schachner M. Watanabe K. Pallen C.J. Xiao Z.C. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26Demyanenko G.P. Schachner M. Anton E.

Besides regulating dendrite development, NB-3 has also been shown to regulate synaptic formation. It is located at the presynaptic site of glutamatergic synapses between parallel fibers and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. In Nb-3−/− mice vesicular glutamate transporter 1-positive synaptic density is reduced (28Sakurai K. Toyoshima M. Ueda H. Matsubara K. Takeda Y. Karagogeos D. Shimoda Y. Watanabe K. Dev. Neurobiol. 2009; 69: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which may explain the motor coordination impairment observed in these mice (29Takeda Y. Akasaka K. Lee S. Kobayashi S.

In the human genome, both NB-3 and CHL1 genes are located on chromosome 3p26-p25. This region is associated with the human 3p syndrome, a disease characterized by mental retardation or low IQ and delayed speech and motor development (30Drumheller T. McGillivray B.C. Behrner D.

Child. 1978; 132: 43-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Involvement of NB-3 and CHL1 in dendrite development and synaptogenesis may explain some aspects of 3p syndrome. Although CHL1 gene deletion has been found in some patients with 3p syndrome (32Cuoco C. Ronchetto P. Gimelli S. Béna F. Divizia M.T. Lerone M. Mirabelli-Badenier M. Mascaretti M. Gimelli G.

A. 2010; 152A: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the association of NB-3 gene and this disease needs to be determined. To function as a receptor in developing neurons, NB-3 needs to present at the cell surface at a sufficient level. However, our previous study suggested that other proteins might play a role in the optimal cell surface expression of NB-3 (25Ye H. Tan Y.L. Ponniah S. Takeda Y. Wang S.Q. Schachner M. Watanabe K. Pallen C.J. Xiao Z.C. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the role of PTPα in regulating NB-3 cell surface expression. We found that Ptpα−/− cortical neurons exhibited a lower level of cell surface NB-3 as compared with wild-type neurons. In transfected COS1 cells NB-3 was mainly retained in the Golgi apparatus during its synthesis. PTPα facilitated Golgi exit of NB-3 and increased NB-3 surface level by inhibiting NB-3 release from the plasma membrane. The extracellular domain but not the catalytic activity is necessary for this effect of PTPα. These results indicate that PTPα not only transduces NB-3 signals but also increases its surface presentation in developing neurons, thus revealing a dual function of PTPα in this signaling pathway.

Briefly, a VSVG epitope was inserted at a PacI site (Ile-16) in the extracellular region of full-length human PTPα in the pXJ41-neo vector. An HA tag was linked to the C terminus of full-length mouse CHL1 during the construction. Various NB-3 and PTPα constructs used in this study are illustrated in the figures, and the methods for construction are presented in the supplemental Materials and Methods.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (from GE Healthcare) or Alexa Fluor 488- or 594-conjugated immunoglobulins (from Invitrogen) were used as secondary antibodies for immunoblotting and immunofluorescent staining. For whole cell staining, cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and incubated in the blocking solution (5% normal goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS), then with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with corresponding secondary antibodies.

Briefly, live cells were incubated with rabbit anti-Myc antibody (from Cell Signaling) or mouse anti-NB-3 antibody in normal growth medium for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were then fixed and stained with fluorescent anti-rabbit IgG or permeabilized and double-stained with monoclonal anti-VSVG antibody for VSVG-PTPα. For double labeling of NB-3-Myc and lysosome, live COS1 cells were incubated with LysoTracker DND-99 (1:1000 in normal growth medium) at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by wash, fixation, and immunostaining using the mAb anti-Myc antibody. Images were taken using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope and analyzed using the FV10-ASW software. The assay to use biotin to label cell surface proteins was described before (25Ye H. Tan Y.L. Ponniah S. Takeda Y. Wang S.Q. Schachner M. Watanabe K. Pallen C.J. Xiao Z.C. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS1 cells (36–48 h after transfection) or cortical neurons from embryonic stage 17.5 (E17.5) mice (7 days in culture) were washed three times in cold PBS and incubated with the membrane-impermeable biotin derivative sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (0.5 mg/ml, from Pierce) in PBS for 15 min at 4 °C. After three washes in cold PBS (first wash with 25 mm Tris-HCl included), cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. Biotin-labeled proteins were precipitated using UltraLink® Immobilized NeutrAvidinTM Gel (from Pierce) at 4 °C for 2 h. Pulldown samples were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Membranes were scanned using Bio-Rad Molecular Imager® FX, and the intensity of signal was analyzed using Quantity One software. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C (PI-PLC, 10−4 units/ml, from Sigma) in the normal growth medium for 16 h at 37 °C followed by extensive wash with cold PBS (25Ye H.

Denisenko-Nehrbass N. Le Bivic A. Rougon G. Girault J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cells were then proceeded for immunostaining or cell surface biotinylation assay. PTPα-deficient mice as described before (35Ponniah S. Wang D.Z. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 535-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) were on the 129J background. Heterozygous mice were mated to generate wild-type and knock-out pairs for primary cortical neuronal culture. At E17.5, mothers were euthanized. Cortices from embryos were dissected and dissociated after trypsin digestion. Cells from individual embryos were plated separately on poly-l-lysine-coated plates. Embryos were then genotyped using a PCR procedure, and cells from Ptpα+/− embryos were discarded. Wild-type and Ptpα−/− cells were cultured in Neural Basal medium with B27 supplement (from Invitrogen) for 7 days before immunostaining or cell surface biotinylation assay were carried out. All procedures were approved and monitored by the institutional animal care and use committee in the Biological Resource Center of Singapore and the institutional animal care and use committee in the Institute of Biophysics, China. In search of proteins that enhance cell surface expression of NB-3, we found that PTPα, which interacts with and mediates signaling of NB-3 (25Ye H. Tan Y.L. Ponniah S. Takeda Y. Wang S.Q. Schachner M. Watanabe K. Pallen C.J. Xiao Z.C. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), also modulates its cell surface expression in neurons. Cortical neurons from E17.5 wild-type and Ptpα−/− mouse littermates were separately isolated and cultured for 7 days before cell surface protein was covalently labeled with biotin. Unlabeled biotin was removed, and neurons were lysed using RIPA buffer. Biotin-labeled cell surface proteins were precipitated using a NeutrAvidinTM gel. Probing of precipitates with a rabbit anti-NB-3 antibody revealed the amount of cell surface NB-3 protein. We detected a significant reduction of cell surface NB-3 in the Ptpα−/− cortical neurons (43.3 ± 3.3% of wild type), whereas the whole cell NB-3 level in the Ptpα−/− neurons was not significantly different from that in the wild-type neurons (Fig. 1, A–C). Consistently, when cell surface NB-3 was clustered and stained using a mouse anti-NB-3 antibody, Ptpα−/− neurons exhibited fewer clusters with lower signal intensity (Fig. 1E). Together, these observations indicate that PTPα positively regulates NB-3 cell surface expression in neurons and led us to investigate whether PTPα itself enhances NB-3 cell surface expression and the possible mechanism. We used COS1 cells to examine the effects of PTPα on NB-3 in more detail. Full-length mouse NB-3 cDNA fused with a Myc tag between the fourth FNIII repeat and the consensus GPI site (NB-3-Myc-GPI, Fig. 2A) and human PTPα cDNA fused with a VSVG tag (VSVG-PTPα) were transfected into the COS1 cells. To visualize only the cell surface NB-3-Myc protein in the transfected cells, live cells were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc antibody in normal growth medium, followed by fixation and incubation with fluorescent secondary antibody. Cells co-transfected with NB-3-Myc-GPI and VSVG-PTPα exhibited a stronger cell surface staining for NB-3-Myc than the cells transfected with NB-3-Myc-GPI cDNA alone (Fig. 2B). Double immunostaining of cell surface NB-3-Myc and whole cell VSVG-PTPα revealed that cells with a strong cell surface signal for NB-3-Myc also expressed VSVG-PTPα (Fig. 2C). To quantitatively compare the cell surface level of NB-3-Myc protein in single- and double-transfected COS1 cells, cell surface protein biotinylation was performed on live cells 36–48 h after transfection. The biotin-labeled cell surface proteins were precipitated, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and blotted with anti-Myc antibody to reveal the amount of cell surface NB-3-Myc-GPI. We found an average 3.5 ± 0.2-fold increase in the amount of cell surface NB-3-Myc in co-transfected cells, compared with that in the cells transfected with NB-3-Myc-GPI alone (Fig. 2, D and E), whereas the cell surface VSVG-PTPα level was relatively high and not significantly affected by the co-expression of NB-3-Myc-GPI (1.2 ± 0.1-fold change as compared with cells transfected with VSVG-PTPα alone (Fig. 2, D and F)). Together, these results indicate that co-expression with PTPα is sufficient to enhance NB-3 cell surface expression in COS1 cells. We next investigated how PTPα increased cell surface expression of NB-3. The low level of NB-3-Myc surface expression in COS1 cells could result from either its intracellular retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi apparatus during synthesis, its intense degradation in lysosomes, or cleavage of its GPI link at the cell surface and subsequent release from the cell membrane. To examine the cellular distribution of NB-3 protein in detail, COS1 cells transfected with NB-3-Myc-GPI were co-stained with anti-Myc antibody and various markers for intracellular organelles. NB-3-Myc exhibited a strong and focused signal at a perinuclear location and relatively weak signal at the cell plasma and periphery location. This strong signal was co-localized with a marker for medial Golgi apparatus, to a lesser extent with the marker for ER, but not with lysosomes (Fig. 3). These results indicate that a significant amount of NB-3-Myc protein is retained in the Golgi apparatus during synthesis. When co-expressed with VSVG-PTPα, however, the perinuclear signal of NB-3-Myc was not obvious anymore, whereas the NB-3-Myc signal at the cell periphery was increased (Fig. 4A). Indeed, the Pearson's coefficient for NB-3-Myc and the Golgi marker co-localization was significantly decreased in co-transfected cells as compared with that in the cells expressing NB-3-Myc-GPI alone, whereas co-localization of NB-3-Myc with the ER marker remained the same (Fig. 4B). The reduction of co-localization of NB-3-Myc with the medial Golgi marker and the increase of NB-3-Myc signal at the cell periphery in co-transfected cells suggest that PTPα facilitates the Golgi exit of NB-3, which reduces intracellular retention of NB-3 during synthesis and increases its protein level at the cell surface. Consistent with this finding, we also observed an increase of co-localization of endogenous NB-3 with the Golgi apparatus in cultured Ptpα−/− neurons compared with the wild-type neurons (Fig. 4, C and D). NB-3 protein lacks a transmembrane domain and is anchored at the cell surface via a GPI link. The GPI link can be cleaved by extracellular phospholipase activity and leads to subsequent release of NB-3 protein from the cell membrane. Indeed, secreted NB-3 protein can function as a ligand for other receptors, such as Notch1 (36Cui X.Y. Hu Q.D. Tekaya M. Shimoda Y. Ang B.T. Nie D.Y. Sun L. Hu W.P. Karsak M. Duka T. Takeda Y. Ou L.Y. Dawe G.S. Yu F.G. Ahmed S. Jin L.H. Schachner M. Watanabe K. Arsenijevic Y. Xiao Z.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25858-25865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that PTPα might increase the surface level of NB-3 via inhibition of NB-3 release from the cell surface. To test this possibility, we used PI-PLC to cleave the GPI link at the cell surface. After a 16-h treatment with PI-PLC, cell surface NB-3-Myc level was not significantly changed in cells co-expressing NB-3-Myc and VSVG-PTPα, compared with cells without PI-PLC treatment, as shown by both immunostaining (Fig. 5A) and cell surface protein biotinylation assay (Fig. 5, B and C). PI-PLC treatment resulted in a decrease of cell surface NB-3-Myc in cells expressing NB-3-Myc alone; however, the change was not statistically significant (Fig. 5, B and C). Thus, PTPα is capable of increasing the cell surface level of NB-3 independent of the GPI link. Treatment with PI-PLC has been shown to modulate the expression of GDNF, a GPI-anchored molecule whose synthesis is auto-regulated (37He D.Y. Ron D. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 2420-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To avoid possible effects of PI-PLC on NB-3 synthesis, we performed another experiment to test if PTPα can stabilize NB-3 at the cell surface independent of the GPI link. A Myc tag was added to the C terminus of the full-length mouse NB-3 cDNA, which disrupts the GPI consensus site and results in a secreted form of NB-3 (sNB-3-Myc, Fig. 2A). Indeed, the sNB-3-Myc signal was barely detectable at the plasma membrane of cells transfected with sNB-3-Myc alone; however, the cell surface sNB-3-Myc signal was much higher in cells co-transfected with VSVG-PTPα (Fig. 6A). After performing double staining of cell surface sNB-3-Myc and whole cell VSVG-PTPα, we found that the cells expressing a higher level of VSVG-PTPα also exhibited a higher level of cell surface sNB-3-Myc (Fig. 6B). In addition, a cell surface biotinylation assay revealed that the cell surface sNB-3-Myc was increased over 10-fold in cells co-expressing VSVG-PTPα, compared with cells expressing sNB-3-Myc alone (Fig. 6, C–E). Consistent with these findings, the level of sNB-3-Myc in the conditioned medium of PTPα co-transfected COS1 was significantly lower than that of the cells expressing sNB-3-Myc alone (21.3 ± 0.7%, Fig. 6, F and G). Together, these results indicate that protein-protein interaction of PTPα with NB-3 may stabilize NB-3 at the cell surface and leads to increased retention of NB-3 protein at the plasma membrane. Our previous study showed that PTPα interacts with NB-3 and mediates its signaling to p59fyn (25Ye H. Tan Y.L. Ponniah S. Takeda Y. Wang S.Q. Schachner M. Watanabe K. Pallen C.J. Xiao Z.C. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To determine the region in NB-3 that mediated its interaction with PTPα, we made truncated forms of NB-3 lacking either FNIII repeats (NB-3-Ig-Myc) or Ig-like domains (NB-3-FN-Myc) (Fig. 2A). In transfected COS1 cells, both NB-3-Ig-Myc and NB-3-FN-Myc were co-localized with VSVG-PTPα intracellularly and at the cell periphery (Fig. 7A). Thirty-six hours after transfection, transfected COS1 cells were lysed using RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody. The immune precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-PTPα antibody. VSVG-PTPα co-transfected with either NB-3-Ig-Myc or NB-3-FN-Myc was recovered in the anti-Myc immune precipitates (Fig. 7B), indicating that both Ig domains and the FNIII repeats of NB-3 can interact with PTPα. However, shorter truncated forms of NB-3 (Ig1–4, Ig4–6, FN1–2, and FN3–4) were not able to co-immunoprecipitate VSVG-PTPα (supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that all six Ig-like domains or four FNIII repeats are necessary for NB-3-PTPα interaction. Because contactin family members lack transmembrane and intracellular domains, the extracellular region of PTPα is required for its association with F3/contactin (3Zeng L. D'Alessandri L. Kalousek M.B. Vaughan L. Pallen C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To determine whether the extracellular region of PTPα is required for enhancing NB-3 cell surface expression, we co-transfected COS1 cells with NB-3-Myc-GPI and a PTPα mutant construct, VSVG-PTPα-ΔEC, which has the majority of the extracellular region deleted (amino acid residues Ser-18 to Ser-119, Fig. 8A). Similar to cells transfected with NB-3-Myc-GPI alone, co-transfected cells exhibited a strong and focused NB-3-Myc signal at a perinuclear location and relatively weak signals at the cell surface (Fig. 8, B and C). Cell surface biotinylation assay revealed a similar cell surface NB-3-Myc level in cells transfected with or without VSVG-PTPα-ΔEC, suggesting that removal of the extracellular region of PTPα abolishes the effect of PTPα on NB-3 cell surface expression. The intracellular region of PTPα contains two catalytic domains (D1 and D2), both of which are necessary for its optimal phosphatase activity to activate downstream Src family members (38Lim K.L. Lai D.S. Kalousek M.B. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mutation of two essential cysteine residues (Cys-414 and Cys-704) to serine residues in the D1 and D2 catalytic domains, respectively, abolishes its catalytic activity (38Lim K.L. Lai D.S. Kalousek M.B. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To test whether catalytic activity of PTPα and its downstream signaling is necessary for enhancing NB-3 cell surface expression, we co-transfected COS1 cells with a PTPα construct harboring these two mutations (VSVG-PTPα-D1sD2s, Fig. 8A). The strong perinuclear NB-3-Myc signal was not obvious (Fig. 8B), and the cell surface NB-3-Myc level was similar to that of cells expressing the wild-type PTPα (Fig. 8, C–E). Together, these results indicate that the extracellular region but not the catalytic activity of PTPα is necessary for its role in enhancing NB-3 cell surface expression. NB-3 is a neural adhesion molecule that functions in the developing nervous system, including the neocortex and cerebellum. Upon stimulation, cell surface NB-3 activates PTPα, which transduces signals inside the cells via dephosphorylation and activation of p59fyn. This signaling pathway is required for proper apical dendrite orientation of deep layer pyramidal neurons (25Ye H. Tan Y.L. Ponniah S. Takeda Y. Wang S.Q. Schachner M. Watanabe K. Pallen C.J. Xiao Z.C. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 39Schmid R.S. Maness P.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2008; 18: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In this study, we have uncovered a previous unknown role of PTPα in the NB-3 signaling pathway: increasing the surface expression level of NB-3 protein in both neurons and transfected COS1 cells (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). PTPα executes this function mainly through two mechanisms: facilitating Golgi exit of NB-3 and stabilizing NB-3 protein at the plasma membrane. NB-3, as a GPI-anchored cell surface protein, is processed in the ER-Golgi-plasma membrane secretary pathway during synthesis. Post-translational modification, including GPI-anchor formation mainly takes place in the ER, whereas the Golgi apparatus is the major sorting station that directs newly synthesized NB-3 protein to the plasma membrane. We found that NB-3 protein is enriched in the medial Golgi in transfected COS1 cells (Fig. 3), resulting in a low cell surface expression of NB-3, whereas surface expression of transfected PTPα is relatively higher (Fig. 2). According to a rapid-partitioning model of intra-Golgi progression, proteins entering the Golgi are quickly partitioned between two phases, the processing domain enriched in Golgi enzymes and the export domain capable of budding transport intermediates for their final target sites (40Patterson G.H. Hirschberg K. Polishchuk R.S. Gerlich D. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Cell. 2008; 133: 1055-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Enrichment of NB-3 in the medial Golgi suggests that most NB-3 protein may be partitioned into the processing domain, which leads to a low Golgi exit rate for NB-3 protein. PTPα is expressed at the cell surface at a relatively high level, suggesting that more PTPα is partitioned into the export domain to translocate to the plasma membrane. As an NB-3-interacting protein, co-expression with PTPα would probably help partition of NB-3 into the export domain, and facilitate Golgi exit of NB-3. Indeed, co-expression with PTPα significantly reduced the co-localization of NB-3 with the Golgi marker, and in Ptpα−/− neurons more endogenous NB-3 protein was co-localized with the Golgi marker (Fig. 4). Moreover, cargo proteins exit the Golgi at an exponential rate proportional to total Golgi load (40Patterson G.H. Hirschberg K. Polishchuk R.S. Gerlich D. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Cell. 2008; 133: 1055-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Co-expression with PTPα would increase the total Golgi abundance, which may also increase NB-3 Golgi exit rate to a certain extent. NB-3 belongs to the F3/contactin family. Adhesion molecules in this family lack a transmembrane domain and are anchored at the cell surface via a GPI link, which is frequently cleaved by extracellular phospholipase activity and leads to the release of the proteins. Indeed, released F3 or NB-3 can function as a ligand for other cell surface receptors, such as Notch1 (36Cui X.Y. Hu Q.D. Tekaya M. Shimoda Y. Ang B.T. Nie D.Y. Sun L. Hu W.P. Karsak M. Duka T. Takeda Y. Ou L.Y. Dawe G.S. Yu F.G. Ahmed S. Jin L.H. Schachner M. Watanabe K. Arsenijevic Y. Xiao Z.C. J. Biol.

Maciag T. Small D. Trifonova R. Kopan R. Okano H. Nakafuku M. Chiba S. Hirai H. Aster J.C. Schachner M. Pallen C.J. Watanabe K. Xiao Z.C. Cell. 2003; 115: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). However, to function as a receptor instead, NB-3 needs to be present at the plasma membrane. We found that cleavage of the GPI link using PI-PLC did not reduce the cell surface level of NB-3 in COS1 cells co-expressing PTPα (Fig. 5). Also, PTPα significantly increased the cell surface level of a secreted form of NB-3 and reduced its release into the culture medium (Fig. 6), suggesting that PTPα is able to stabilize NB-3 at the plasma membrane independent of the GPI link. PTPα most likely exerts this effect through direct interaction with both Ig domains and FNIII repeats of NB-3 protein at the plasma membrane (Fig. 7). The extracellular region but not the catalytic activity of PTPα is necessary for its effects on NB-3 cell surface expression (Fig. 8), suggesting that the physical interaction of PTPα and NB-3 protein is sufficient to facilitate NB-3 intracellular processing and stabilization at the cell surface. In summary, our present study demonstrated a novel function of PTPα in NB-3/PTPα signaling. In addition to transducing the NB-3 signal inside neurons and eventually leading to cytoskeleton rearrangement and dendritic growth, PTPα also helped Golgi exit of NB-3 and stabilized NB-3 at the plasma membrane, thus increasing the cell surface level of NB-3. In this way, PTPα, though a downstream effector, may also be able to enhance NB-3 signaling strength and efficiency at the receptor level in developing neurons. It would be interesting to investigate whether PTPα also regulates cell surface expression of other membrane-bound molecules and whether this signaling mechanism also applies to other GPI-anchored proteins to enhance and facilitate their functions as receptors.

Access to human reproductive tissue is essential for many forms of stem cell research. We identify questions for future studies of tissue providers, procurers, and end-user scientists, and suggest that international comparative studies of all three parties, and of the relationships between them, will improve the ethical supply of tissue. Many stem cell scientists are dependent on a supply of human reproductive tissues (hRT), such as eggs, embryos, fetal tissue, and placentas, to conduct their research. The processes through which that tissue arrives in the laboratory might be considered of little importance to many bench scientists, but we suggest that the field of stem cell research would benefit from an active interest in the relationships between those asked to provide tissue (often patients), those acquiring that tissue (often, but not only, IVF clinicians), and those using that tissue (stem cell scientists). Understanding the interactions between these three key parties will help to ensure an ethical and efficient supply of hRT. A growing body of research on actual and potential tissue providers supplies important insights into their reasons for giving or not giving tissue. We suggest that this research is a useful foundation for developing studies of the roles, values, and experiences of the other two parties and for studying the relationships between all three. In this article we use current knowledge to identify questions for future studies into this important aspect of stem cell research. Scientists wish to contribute to the greater good through the development of treatments for serious illnesses. They can only achieve this goal by ensuring a regular supply of a range of hRT. Such tissue does not just arrive, silently and seamlessly, into the laboratory, but has to be actively sought. Sometimes it even has to be fought for politically, as the USA Lamberth ruling indicates; there is a need to build trust in this “sensitive” area (Gottweis, 2010Gottweis H. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). One element of that trust is ensuring that tissue is acquired ethically, through understanding what is important to tissue providers, tissue procurers, research funders, and wider society. While trust is not the only aspect that requires examination in this complex field, it is considered central to the successful acceptance of developments in medicine, science, and biotechnology, as is the need to overcome undeserved mistrust (O'Neill, 2002O'Neill O. Autonomy and Trust in Bioethics. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2002Crossref Google Scholar). Evidence of a lack of trust ranges from the concerns raised by the Henrietta Lacks case (Skloot, 2010Skloot R. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. Crown Publishing Group, New York2010Google Scholar) to media (mis)representations of stem cell research to “society's doubt about the implications of science and its concerns about the hubris of scientists” (Moreno, 2010Moreno J. Nature. 2010; 467: 1031-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar; p. 1031). The building of trust relationships needs to be addressed internationally, as a corollary to the global demand for hRT for research. “Scientific tourism” (scientists traveling around the world to work under regulatory conditions more favorable to their research) is understandable within the ambitions of the therapeutic promise, but needs to be tempered by awareness of the processes of tissue transactions within any particular country. The provision and procurement of hRT varies between different cultural, regulatory, and ethical frameworks; scientists need to be aware of these variations and of their implications for the ethical conduct of their laboratory work. While the “Hwang scandal” is past history, the focus of attention, demonstrated by the recognizable shorthand reference, was as much the scientist who acquired and (mis)used the tissue as the fabricated results. The scandal is a reminder of the need to ensure that everyday practices of tissue procurement and use are not achieved at ethical cost to tissue providers, or at a cost to the trust relationship between all three parties. Paradoxically, ethical safeguards can inhibit the involvement of scientists in procuring tissue. For example, the UK Polkinghorne Guidelines for acquiring fetal tissue for research enshrine the “principle of separation,” which ensures that researchers have no direct contact with potential tissue providers (Woods and Taylor, 2008Woods S. Taylor K. Clinical Ethics. 2008; 3: 14-19Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). While valuable in protecting the autonomy of tissue providers, this principle can have the unintended effect of limiting the knowledge and understanding between providers and scientists. Trust exists in the context of a relationship between two or more parties; one of its components, openness, is enhanced by communication. If the separation principle means that that communication has to be taken on by mediating tissue procurers, then the need for all three parties to understand each other's actions and motivations is reinforced. There is a growing body of evidence-based research on the providers of varying types of hRT. These studies are valuable for understanding what matters to potential and actual providers and for identifying useful questions to ask of the other two parties. Current research is dominated by studies of the disposition decisions of couples with frozen embryos (for a detailed review of this international research, see Haimes and Taylor, 2010Haimes E. Taylor K. Bioethics. 2010; 25https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8519.2009.01792.xCrossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies indicate that most couples have great difficulty in committing to a decision and that none of the available options, including giving to research, is ideal. What might appear an obvious source of research materials is, to the potential providers, a series of complex challenges (Lyerly et al., 2011Lyerly A.D. Nakagawa S. Kuppermann M. Hum. Reprod. 2011; 26: 646-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that understanding tissue provision from the potential providers' viewpoint reveals factors that need to be addressed (e.g., through robust consent, and other, practices) if greater levels of provision are to be achieved (Kalista et al., 2011Kalista T. Freeman H.A. Behr B. Pera R.R. Scott C.T. Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 360-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In a rare empirical study of providers of fresh embryos for hESC research (Haimes and Taylor, 2009Haimes E. Taylor K. Hum. Reprod. 2009; 24: 2142-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), interviewees were preoccupied with IVF treatment and their overriding concern to have a baby. The request to provide fresh embryos to research was a secondary consideration and judged in relation to its effect on their chances of pregnancy. Producing eggs and then embryos was interviewees' initial goal because these steps represented the vital early markers of success without which no baby could result. In other words, eggs and embryos were both extremely valuable to the patients; few interviewees were prepared to give away eggs for research until fertilization had been attempted. Eggs are therefore not morally simple material, as is often assumed; they caused interviewees as many dilemmas as embryos, at that stage of their treatment. This finding suggests that attention should be paid to the careful timing of requests for fresh embryos and eggs. Although interviewees referred to the importance of “the embryo,” the morally laden, abstract entity that they knew was the subject of debate and which they felt deserved respect, it did not play a dominant role in their decision making. Such findings suggest that the moral status of the human embryo can be accorded a less determining role in ethical analyses of hESC research. Considered together, research on providers of frozen and fresh embryos suggests two other important issues: (1) that providers do not necessarily share clinicians', scientists', nor regulators' definitions of what constitutes “spare” embryos or eggs; and (2) that attention needs to be paid to the specific features of the clinical context in which people are asked to provide hRT. The study on fresh embryo provision suggested that a study on the provision of fresh eggs for research was necessary, since it was clear that egg provision is less ethically straightforward than might have been supposed. An ongoing study of volunteers to a controversial “egg sharing for research” scheme (which involves the provision of eggs for SCNT research in exchange for reduced IVF fees) may offer additional insight. The theoretical literature on this, and other schemes encouraging egg provision for research, debates the ethics of inducement, exploitation, and commodification. However, the fresh embryo project (Haimes and Taylor, 2009Haimes E. Taylor K. Hum. Reprod. 2009; 24: 2142-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) suggests that egg providers will have other insights to add, including what personal, social, and economic factors persuade potential tissue providers to become active volunteers to such a scheme, given what is now known about how precious these eggs are to IVF patients. Pfeffer, 2008Pfeffer N. Soc. Sci. Med. 2008; 66: 2544-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar adds to this work on providers through a study of women who gave fetal tissue from abortions to stem cell researchers. During focus group discussions women realized they had not understood the implications of the successful derivation of stem cell lines from their tissue. The association of these lines with “renewal, regeneration, and immortality” reinforced the physical reality of the fetus which was “the very thing abortion is meant to eliminate” (p. 2544). This greater knowledge meant women started to doubt their decision. This finding suggests that scientists and tissue procurers need to acknowledge and address such contradictions, perhaps by emphasizing the hoped-for, longer-term benefits of research. This research on providers of embryos (frozen and fresh), eggs, and fetal tissue is a valuable beginning, but further questions can be asked, comparing and contrasting potential and actual providers of a wider range of tissues in a wider range of countries. Some examples are as follows.(1)Do different types of hRT (e.g., eggs, sperm, embryos, fetuses, placentas, umbilical cords, amniotic membranes, and fluids) raise different issues for potential providers? How might these be addressed, to the providers' satisfaction, so that they turn from being potential to actual providers?(2)Research tissue is often described as “spare,” “surplus,” or “waste:” is this how potential hRT providers view their materials (the studies on embryo disposition suggest otherwise)?(3)Does the type of intended research, or a particular research team, affect the decision to provide hRT? What do potential providers want to know about the research?(4)How do potential hRT providers define and measure costs and benefits of provision?(5)What measures would potential hRT providers suggest to ensure ethical protection?(6)What do hRT providers regard as effective practices and policies in encouraging provision? Who would they prefer to discuss their decisions with?(7)How do hRT providers conceptualize their contribution: as donations, gifts, altruism, sharing, exchanging, or selling? Does this affect their decision?(8)What other factors affect their decision making? How do these compare with what clinicians, scientists, and policymakers assume to be important to providers? Without such comparative studies and evidence-based conclusions, we are reduced to speculating about what encourages people to supply tissue for research, what discourages them, and why. Even this brief indication of what can be learnt from studying providers suggests the usefulness of studying those tasked with the pivotal role of procuring tissue to see how they manage this process. Attention has been given to the ethics of arrangements for acquiring tissue (such as the impact of different consenting procedures; Cohen et al., 2008Cohen C.B. Brandhorst B. Nagy A. Leader A. Dickens B. Isasi R. Evans D. Knoppers B. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 416-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but less is known about how tissue procurers implement these arrangements in practice (Kalista et al., 2011Kalista T. Freeman H.A. Behr B. Pera R.R. Scott C.T. Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 360-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) or how their activities are affected by their relationships with tissue providers and with the end user scientists. Important questions to ask (again across the full range of tissues and countries) include the following.(1)Who are the tissue procurers?(2)What motivates them to act as go-betweens and how does this affect how they do their main jobs?(3)How do they think they should conduct their professional relationships with providers and with scientists? Do they see themselves as advocates for the science, the providers, or both?(4)What value do they place on measures such as inducements to provide tissue?(5)Are there any patients, clinical settings, or types of tissue that they feel should not be included in requests to help research? If so, why?(6)How might they be assisted to do a more effective job, within robust ethical guidelines? Acknowledging the global variations in tissue acquisition, it is also important to ask whether tissue transactions between providers and procurers take place under fair social and economic conditions or whether local inequalities and injustices skew such negotiations. These questions are open to empirical investigation. Scientists' collaborations with procurers can benefit from a greater understanding of what is actually involved in acquiring tissues, to make these transactions more effective and efficient while still ethically acceptable. This suggests, however, that there are also useful studies to be conducted with scientists, to understand how they see their role in these tissue transactions. Questions might include the following.(1)How much do scientists know about how hRT arrives in their laboratories?(2)Do scientists regard themselves as having any responsibility for the ethical procurement of hRT? Would they like a direct involvement in acquiring tissue?(3)Do scientists see a need to build trust relationships with tissue providers, procurers, and wider society? If so, how might they do this?(4)What do scientists regard as effective practices in encouraging provision? How do these compare with the experiences of providers and procurers?(5)Do scientists view different types of hRT differently in terms of how they should be provided, acquired, and used?(6)How influential are the legal, ethical, and cultural contexts in which they work in shaping their research?(7)Is stem cell science the same or different from other areas of research in terms of how human tissue should be provided, procured, and used? These questions are just the tip of an investigatory iceberg; others will emerge through research and debate. Given that many stem cell scientists have to play an increasingly public role in defending and promoting their work, it is important for them to know more about other parties' practices and experiences in this controversial aspect of their work, to assist them to provide an evidence-based advocacy. Studying tissue providers and procurers, their relationships with each other, and their relationship with stem cell scientists enables scrutiny of the highly complex moral, cultural, economic, and political transactions that underpin the uses of hRT in research. It also assists the identification of any misunderstandings and gaps in communication between all three parties, thereby building more trust between them and improving the ethical and efficient acquisition of hRT for research. A more detailed understanding of tissue transactions will also assist scientists to tailor messages about the need for tissue and about the long-term benefits of contributing to scientific research. Therefore a constant questioning of the processes of acquiring hRT by all those involved is essential to improving best practice. These outcomes will be more robust if future investigations (1) encompass the full range of hRT; (2) include a wider range of countries; (3) combine the perspectives of all three parties; (4) integrate socioethical collaborations within large-scale stem cell projects; (5) learn from tissue transactions in other areas of scientific research; and (6) combine to produce updated, evidence-based policy and practice guidelines for all those involved. The work of scientists depends on the trust of wider society, so it is in the interests of all those engaged in stem cell science to attend to these issues."
