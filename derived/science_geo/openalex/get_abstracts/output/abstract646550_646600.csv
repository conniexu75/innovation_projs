https://openalex.org/W3001737768,"Microbial communities of the mouse gut have been extensively studied; however, their functional roles and regulation are yet to be elucidated. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses may allow us a comprehensive profiling of bacterial composition and functions of the complex gut microbiota. The present study aimed to investigate the active functions of the microbial communities in the murine cecum by analyzing both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data on specific bacterial species within the microbial communities, in addition to the whole microbiome.Bacterial composition of the healthy mouse gut microbiome was profiled using the following three different approaches: 16S rRNA-based profiling based on amplicon and shotgun sequencing data, and genome-based profiling based on shotgun sequencing data. Consistently, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Deferribacteres emerged as the major phyla. Based on NCBI taxonomy, Muribaculaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Deferribacteraceae were the predominant families identified in each phylum. The genes for carbohydrate metabolism were upregulated in Muribaculaceae, while genes for cofactors and vitamin metabolism and amino acid metabolism were upregulated in Deferribacteraceae. The genes for translation were commonly enhanced in all three families. Notably, combined analysis of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing data revealed that the functions of translation and metabolism were largely upregulated in all three families in the mouse gut environment. The ratio of the genes in the metagenome and their expression in the metatranscriptome indicated higher expression of carbohydrate metabolism in Muribaculum, Duncaniella, and Mucispirillum.We demonstrated a fundamental methodology for linking genomic and transcriptomic datasets to examine functional activities of specific bacterial species in a complicated microbial environment. We investigated the normal flora of the mouse gut using three different approaches and identified Muribaculaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Deferribacteraceae as the predominant families. The functional distribution of these families was reflected in the entire microbiome. By comparing the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data, we found that the expression rates differed for different functional categories in the mouse gut environment. Application of these methods to track microbial transcription in individuals over time, or before and after administration of a specific stimulus will significantly facilitate future development of diagnostics and treatments."

However, CVCs may represent a source for bloodstream infections (central line-associated bloodstream infections, CLABSI) and, thus, may increase morbidity and mortality of these patients. A retrospective cohort study over 3 years was performed. Risk factors were determined and evaluated by a multivariable logistic regression analysis. Healthcare costs of CLABSI were analyzed in a matched case-control study. In total 610 patients got included with a CLABSI incidence of 10.6 cases per 1,000 CVC days. The use of more than one CVC per case, CVC insertion for conditioning for stem cell transplantation, acute myeloid leukemia, leukocytopenia (≤ 1000/μL), carbapenem therapy and pulmonary diseases were independent risk factors for CLABSI. Hospital costs directly attributed to the onset of CLABSI were 8,810 € per case. CLABSI had a significant impact on the overall healthcare costs. Knowledge about risk factors and infection control measures for CLABSI prevention is crucial for best clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W3002463610,"The diagnosis of myeloid neoplasms (MN) has significantly evolved through the last few decades. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is gradually becoming an essential tool to help clinicians with disease management. To this end, most specialized genetic laboratories have implemented NGS panels targeting a number of different genes relevant to MN. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the performance of four different targeted NGS gene panels based on their technical features and clinical utility. A total of 32 patient bone marrow samples were accrued and sequenced with 3 commercially available panels and 1 custom panel. Variants were classified by two geneticists based on their clinical relevance in MN. There was a difference in panel's depth of coverage. We found 11 discordant clinically relevant variants between panels, with a trend to miss long insertions. Our data show that there is a high risk of finding different mutations depending on the panel of choice, due both to the panel design and the data analysis method. Of note, CEBPA, CALR and FLT3 genes, remains challenging the use of NGS for diagnosis of MN in compliance with current guidelines. Therefore, conventional molecular testing might need to be kept in place for the correct diagnosis of MN for now."
https://openalex.org/W2939918494,"Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are widely used for modeling social networks observed at one point in time. However the computational difficulty of ERGM parameter estimation has limited the practical application of this class of models to relatively small networks, up to a few thousand nodes at most, with usually only a few hundred nodes or fewer. In the case of undirected networks, snowball sampling can be used to find ERGM parameter estimates of larger networks via network samples, and recently published improvements in ERGM network distribution sampling and ERGM estimation algorithms have allowed ERGM parameter estimates of undirected networks with over one hundred thousand nodes to be made. However the implementations of these algorithms to date have been limited in their scalability, and also restricted to undirected networks. Here we describe an implementation of the recently published Equilibrium Expectation (EE) algorithm for ERGM parameter estimation of large directed networks. We test it on some simulated networks, and demonstrate its application to an online social network with over 1.6 million nodes."
https://openalex.org/W3001330973,"The house cricket, Acheta domesticus L. (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) is one of the most important species of industrialized insects in the United States. Within the past five years the market of cricket powder as a food ingredient has been growing with increasing consumer interest on more sustainable sources of food. However, high labor costs of cricket production and high prices of cricket feed formulations result in cricket powder market prices much higher than other protein-rich food ingredients, making cricket powder only competitive within the novelty food market. In this study new diets formulated using by-products were developed using dietary self-selection followed by regression analysis. Crickets selected among seven different combinations of ingredients. Consumption ratios of food ingredients and by-products were used to determine macro and micro-nutrient intake. Regression analysis was used to determine the individual nutrient intake effect on cricket biomass production. Intake of vitamin C, sterol, manganese, and vitamins B1 and B5 had the most significant impact on live biomass production. Four diets were formulated based on this information and compared with a reference (Patton's 13) and a commercial diet. Although, crickets reared on Patton's diet 13 produced the most dry-weight biomass and developed the fastest, diet 4 (consisting of 92% by-products) generated the most profit (with a cost of $0.39 USD per kg) after an economic analysis that did not include the commercial formulation. Dry-weight biomass production was not significantly different among the four new diets and the commercial diet. This study demonstrated the value of dietary self-selection studies in developing oligidic insect diets and in studies of insect nutrition. This is the first such study involving farmed edible crickets and agricultural by-products. Four new cricket diet formulations contain between 62 and 92% agricultural by-products are included."

A summed image was generated and regions of interests were set to the left and right striata. Area, equivalent diameter, major axis length, minor axis length, perimeter and circularity were calculated as shape features. Striatum binding ratios (SBRputamen and SBRcaudate) were used as comparison features. The classification performance of the PD and NC groups according to receiver operating characteristic analysis of the shape features was compared in terms of SBRs. Furthermore, we compared the classification performance of ML when shape features or SBRs were used alone and in combination.The shape features (except minor axis length) and SBRs indicated significant differences between the NC and PD groups (p < 0.05). The top five areas under the curves (AUC) were as follows: circularity (0.972), SBRputamen (0.972), major axis length (0.945), SBRcaudate (0.928) and perimeter (0.896). When classification was done using ML, AUC was as follows: circularity and SBRs (0.995), circularity alone (0.990), and SBRs (0.973). The classification performance was significantly improved by combining SBRs and circularity than by SBRs alone (p = 0.018).We found that the circularity obtained from DAT-SPECT images could help in distinguishing NC and PD. Furthermore, the classification performance of ML was significantly improved using circularity in SBRs together."
https://openalex.org/W3001445204,"Electrical recording permits direct readout of neural activity but offers limited ability to correlate it to the network topography. On the other hand, optical imaging reveals the architecture of neural circuits, but relies on bulky optics and fluorescent reporters whose signals are attenuated by the brain tissue. Here we introduce implantable devices to record brain activities based on the field effect, which can be further extended with capability of label-free electrophysiological mapping. Such devices reply on light-addressable potentiometric sensors (LAPS) coupled to polymer fibers with integrated electrodes and optical waveguide bundles. The LAPS utilizes the field effect to convert electrophysiological activity into regional carrier redistribution, and the neural activity is read out in a spatially resolved manner as a photocurrent induced by a modulated light beam. Spatially resolved photocurrent recordings were achieved by illuminating different pixels within the fiber bundles. These devices were applied to record local field potentials in the mouse hippocampus. In conjunction with the raster-scanning via the single modulated beam, this technology may enable fast label-free imaging of neural activity in deep brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W3001836692,"Cancer awareness campaigns aim to increase awareness of the potential seriousness of signs and symptoms of cancer, and encourage their timely presentation to healthcare services. Enhanced understanding of the prevalence of symptoms possibly indicative of cancer in different population subgroups, and associated general practitioner (GP) help-seeking behaviour, will help to target cancer awareness campaigns more effectively.To determine: i) the prevalence of 21 symptoms possibly indicative of breast, colorectal, lung or upper gastrointestinal cancer in the United Kingdom (UK), including six 'red flag' symptoms; ii) whether the prevalence varies among population subgroups; iii) the proportion of symptoms self-reported as presented to GPs; iv) whether GP help-seeking behaviour varies within population subgroups.Self-completed questionnaire about experience of, and response to, 25 symptoms (including 21 possibly indicative of the four cancers of interest) in the previous month and year; sent to 50,000 adults aged 50 years or more and registered with 21 general practices in Staffordshire, England or across Scotland.Completed questionnaires were received from 16,778 respondents (corrected response rate 34.2%). Almost half (45.8%) of respondents had experienced at least one symptom possibly indicative of cancer in the last month, and 58.5% in the last year. The prevalence of individual symptoms varied widely (e.g. in the last year between near zero% (vomiting up blood) and 15.0% (tired all the time). Red flag symptoms were uncommon. Female gender, inability to work because of illness, smoking, a history of a specified medical diagnosis, low social support and lower household income were consistently associated with experiencing at least one symptom possibly indicative of cancer in both the last month and year. The proportion of people who had contacted their GP about a symptom experienced in the last month varied between 8.1% (persistent cough) and 39.9% (unexplained weight loss); in the last year between 32.8% (hoarseness) and 85.4% (lump in breast). Nearly half of respondents experiencing at least one red flag symptom in the last year did not contact their GP about it. Females, those aged 80+ years, those unable to work because of illness, ex-smokers and those previously diagnosed with a specified condition were more likely to report a symptom possibly indicative of cancer to their GP; and those on high household income less likely.Symptoms possibly indicative of cancer are common among adults aged 50+ years in the UK, although they are not evenly distributed. Help-seeking responses to different symptoms also vary. Our results suggest important opportunities to provide more nuanced messaging and targeting of symptom-based cancer awareness campaigns."
https://openalex.org/W3002801264,"Dispensing antibiotics without prescription is irrational and can hasten the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. This study aims at determining the extent of this practice and its determinants in all drug retail outlets of Eritrea. A cross-sectional simulated client method was used to conduct the study. Data was collected between July and August 2019, entered and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science version 22. Descriptive analysis was performed using mean (standard deviation), median (interquartile range), frequency, percentage, as appropriate, for independent variables. Logistic regression, at bivariate and multivariate levels, along with odds ratio (95% confidence interval) was used to determine the association between the dispensing of antibiotics without prescription and independent variables. P-values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. The extent of dispensing antibiotics without prescription was found to be 87.6% with the most frequently dispensed antibiotics being ciprofloxacin (47.8%) and co-trimoxazole (37.5%). Furthermore, 12.4% of the drug retail outlet attendants did not dispense antibiotics because they preferred a referral to health facilities (52.6%), were following administrative restrictions not to sell antibiotics (42.1%), or did not have the necessary antibiotics (31.6%). Private community pharmacies (AOR = 7.68, 95% CI: 1.67, 35.37; p = 0.009) and private drug shops (AOR = 10.65, 95% CI: 1.96, 57.93; p = 0.006) were more likely to dispense antibiotics compared to the governmental community pharmacies. Dispensing antibiotics without prescription was more likely to occur in the Maekel (central) region (AOR = 3.76, 95% CI: 1.19, 11.92; p = 0.024) compared to the remaining regions combined. In conclusion, the sales of antibiotics without prescription in the drug retail outlets of Eritrea is alarming which requires immediate attention from policymakers."
https://openalex.org/W3000977647,"Availability of trained radiologists for fast processing of CXRs in regions burdened with tuberculosis always has been a challenge, affecting both timely diagnosis and patient monitoring. The paucity of annotated images of lungs of TB patients hampers attempts to apply data-oriented algorithms for research and clinical practices. The TB Portals Program database (TBPP, https://TBPortals.niaid.nih.gov) is a global collaboration curating a large collection of the most dangerous, hard-to-cure drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) patient cases. TBPP, with 1,179 (83%) DR-TB patient cases, is a unique collection that is well positioned as a testing ground for deep learning classifiers. As of January 2019, the TBPP database contains 1,538 CXRs, of which 346 (22.5%) are annotated by a radiologist and 104 (6.7%) by a pulmonologist-leaving 1,088 (70.7%) CXRs without annotations. The Qure.ai qXR artificial intelligence automated CXR interpretation tool, was blind-tested on the 346 radiologist-annotated CXRs from the TBPP database. Qure.ai qXR CXR predictions for cavity, nodule, pleural effusion, hilar lymphadenopathy was successfully matching human expert annotations. In addition, we tested the 12 Qure.ai classifiers to find whether they correlate with treatment success (information provided by treating physicians). Ten descriptors were found as significant: abnormal CXR (p = 0.0005), pleural effusion (p = 0.048), nodule (p = 0.0004), hilar lymphadenopathy (p = 0.0038), cavity (p = 0.0002), opacity (p = 0.0006), atelectasis (p = 0.0074), consolidation (p = 0.0004), indicator of TB disease (p = < .0001), and fibrosis (p = < .0001). We conclude that applying fully automated Qure.ai CXR analysis tool is useful for fast, accurate, uniform, large-scale CXR annotation assistance, as it performed well even for DR-TB cases that were not used for initial training. Testing artificial intelligence algorithms (encapsulating both machine learning and deep learning classifiers) on diverse data collections, such as TBPP, is critically important toward progressing to clinically adopted automatic assistants for medical data analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3001604426,"Experimental studies highlight the important role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the regulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic connectivity in the nervous system. In its turn, the neural ECM is formed in an activity-dependent manner. Its maturation closes the so-called critical period of neural development, stabilizing the efficient configurations of neural networks in the brain. ECM is locally remodeled by proteases secreted and activated in an activity-dependent manner into the extracellular space and this process is important for physiological synaptic plasticity. We ask if ECM remodeling may be exaggerated under pathological conditions and enable activity-dependent switches between different regimes of ECM expression. We consider an analytical model based on known mechanisms of interaction between neuronal activity and expression of ECM, ECM receptors and ECM degrading proteases. We demonstrate that either inhibitory or excitatory influence of ECM on neuronal activity may lead to the bistability of ECM expression, so two stable stationary states are observed. Noteworthy, only in the case when ECM has predominant inhibitory influence on neurons, the bistability is dependent on the activity of proteases. Excitatory ECM-neuron feedback influences may also result in spontaneous oscillations of ECM expression, which may coexist with a stable stationary state. Thus, ECM-neuronal interactions support switches between distinct dynamic regimes of ECM expression, possibly representing transitions into disease states associated with remodeling of brain ECM."

This research uses Expansion Speed Index and Expansion Intensity Index to examine spatiotemporal characteristics of construction land expansion in the Yangtze River economic belt from 2000 to 2017. Based on a STIRPAT model, driving forces of construction land expansion are measured by Principal Component Analysis and Ordinary Least Square regression. The results show that: (1) there is a clear expansion pattern regarding the time sequence in provinces/cities of the Yangtze River economic belt, with rapid expansion in the initial stage, moderate expansion in the middle stage and rapid expansion in the later stage. (2) Spatial analysis demonstrates first expansion in the lower reaches in the early stage, rapid expansion of the upper reaches in the middle and later stage, and steady expansion of the middle reaches throughout the research period. (3)There are statistical significant correlations between construction land expansion and GDP, social fixed asset investments, population at the end of the year, population urbanization rate, per capita road area, and number of scientific and technological professionals as well as secondary and tertiary industry values. Of these factors, GDP, social fixed asset investments, population urbanization rate and second industry value are important common driving forces of construction land expansion in this region. The research findings have significant policy implications particularly on coordinated development of urban agglomerations and sustainable industry upgrading when construction land expansion is concerned."
https://openalex.org/W3001343942,"Sperm cryopreservation by ultra-rapid cooling based on dropping small volumes of sperm suspension directly into liquid nitrogen, has been successful in some wild ruminant species, including the Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica). In ultra-rapid cooling, the contents of these droplets are expected to enter a stable, glass-like state, but to the best of our knowledge no information exists regarding the presence or absence of ice formation in the extracellular milieu when using this technique. Different modifications to the extracellular milieu likely inflict different types of damage on the plasmalemma, the acrosome and mitochondrial membranes. The aims of the present work were: 1) to examine the physical state of the extracellular milieu after cryopreservation at slow and ultra-rapid cooling rates-and thus determine whether ultra-rapid cooling vitrifies the extracellular milieu; and 2) to compare, using conventional sperm analysis techniques and scanning and transmission electron microscopy, the damage to sperm caused by these two methods. Sperm samples were obtained by the transrectal ultrasound-guided massage method (TUMASG) from anesthetized Iberian ibexes, and cryopreserved using slow and ultra-rapid cooling techniques. Sperm motility (22.95 ± 3.22% vs 4.42 ± 0.86%), viability (25.64 ± 3.71% vs 12.8 ± 2.50%), acrosome integrity (41.45± 3.73% vs 27.00 ± 1.84%) and mitochondrial membrane integrity (16.52 ± 3.75% vs 4.00 ± 0.65%) were better after slow cooling (P<0.001) than after ultra-rapid technique. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM) suggested that the vitrified state was not achieved by ultra-rapid cooling, and that the ice crystals formed were smaller and had more stretchmarks (P<0.001) than after slow cooling. Scanning electron microscopy revealed no differences in the types of damage caused by the examined techniques, although transmission electron microscopy showed the damage to the plasmalemma and mitochondrial membrane to be worse after ultra-rapid cooling. In conclusion ultra-rapid cooling provoked more membrane damage than slow cooling, perhaps due to the extracellular ice crystals formed."
https://openalex.org/W3001466970,"Autophagy is a cellular mechanism involved in the bulk degradation of proteins and turnover of organelle. Several studies have shown the significance of autophagy of the renal tubular epithelium in rodent models of tubulointerstitial disorder. However, the role of autophagy in the regulation of human glomerular diseases is largely unknown. The current study aimed to demonstrate morphological evidence of autophagy and its association with the ultrastructural changes of podocytes and clinical data in patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, a disease in which patients exhibit podocyte injury. The study population included 95 patients, including patients with glomerular disease (minimal change nephrotic syndrome [MCNS], n = 41; idiopathic membranous nephropathy [IMN], n = 37) and 17 control subjects who underwent percutaneous renal biopsy. The number of autophagic vacuoles and the grade of foot process effacement (FPE) in podocytes were examined by electron microscopy (EM). The relationships among the expression of autophagic vacuoles, the grade of FPE, and the clinical data were determined. Autophagic vacuoles were mainly detected in podocytes by EM. The microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-positive area was co-localized with the Wilms tumor 1 (WT1)-positive area on immunofluorescence microscopy, which suggested that autophagy occurred in the podocytes of patients with MCNS. The number of autophagic vacuoles in the podocytes was significantly correlated with the podocyte FPE score (r = -0.443, p = 0.004), the amount of proteinuria (r = 0.334, p = 0.033), and the level of serum albumin (r = -0.317, p = 0.043) in patients with MCNS. The FPE score was a significant determinant for autophagy after adjusting for the age in a multiple regression analysis in MCNS patients (p = 0.0456). However, such correlations were not observed in patients with IMN or in control subjects. In conclusion, the results indicated that the autophagy of podocytes is associated with FPE and severe proteinuria in patients with MCNS. The mechanisms underlying the activation of autophagy in association with FPE in podocytes should be further investigated in order to elucidate the pathophysiology of MCNS."
https://openalex.org/W3001041655,"There continues to be a significant shortage of donor livers for transplantation. One impediment is the discard rate of fatty, or steatotic, livers because of their poor post-transplant function. Steatotic livers are prone to significant ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and data regarding how best to improve the quality of steatotic livers is lacking. Herein, we use normothermic (37°C) machine perfusion in combination with metabolic and lipidomic profiling to elucidate deficiencies in metabolic pathways in steatotic livers, and to inform strategies for improving their function. During perfusion, energy cofactors increased in steatotic livers to a similar extent as non-steatotic livers, but there were significant deficits in anti-oxidant capacity, efficient energy utilization, and lipid metabolism. Steatotic livers appeared to oxidize fatty acids at a higher rate but favored ketone body production rather than energy regeneration via the tricyclic acid cycle. As a result, lactate clearance was slower and transaminase levels were higher in steatotic livers. Lipidomic profiling revealed ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids increased in non-steatotic livers to a greater extent than in steatotic livers. The novel use of metabolic and lipidomic profiling during ex situ normothermic machine perfusion has the potential to guide the resuscitation and rehabilitation of steatotic livers for transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W3002160493,"The root rot causing oomycete, Phytophthora agathidicida, threatens the long-term survival of the iconic New Zealand kauri. Currently, testing for this pathogen involves an extended soil bioassay that takes 14–20 days and requires specialised staff, consumables, and infrastructure. Here we describe a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the detection of P. agathidicida that targets a portion of the mitochondrial apocytochrome b coding sequence. This assay has high specificity and sensitivity; it did not cross react with a range of other Phytophthora isolates and detected as little as 1 fg of total P. agathidicida DNA or 116 copies of the target locus. Assay performance was further investigated by testing plant tissue baits from flooded soil samples using both the extended soil bioassay and LAMP testing of DNA extracted from baits. In these comparisons, P. agathidicida was detected more frequently using the LAMP test. In addition to greater sensitivity, by removing the need for culturing, the hybrid baiting plus LAMP approach is more cost effective than the extended soil bioassay and, importantly, does not require a centralised laboratory facility with specialised staff, consumables, and equipment. Such testing will allow us to address outstanding questions about P. agathidicida. For example, the hybrid approach could enable monitoring of the pathogen beyond areas with visible disease symptoms, allow direct evaluation of rates and patterns of spread, and allow the effectiveness of disease control to be evaluated. The hybrid LAMP bioassay also has the potential to empower local communities to evaluate the pathogen status of local kauri stands, providing information for disease management and conservation initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W3000768700,"Introduction Loss to follow up after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is common in Africa, particularly in Ethiopia and it is a considerable obstacle for the effectiveness of the ART program. Mortality is a competing risk of loss to follow up but it is often overlooked and there is limited evidence about the incidence and predictors of loss to follow up in the presence of competing events. Objective To assess the Incidence and predictors of loss to follow up among adult HIV patients on ART in University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2018. Methods Institution based retrospective follow up study was conducted in University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. A Gray’s test and cumulative incidence curve were used to compare the cumulative incidence function of loss to follow up. Bivariable and multivariable competing risk regression models were fitted to identify the predictors of lost to follow up and those variables with p-value <0.05 in the multivariable analysis was considered as significant predictors of lost to follow up. Result A total of 531 adult HIV patients on ART were included in the analysis. The incidence rate of loss to follow up in this study was 10.90 (95% CI: 8.9–13.2) per 100 person years. Being age group 15–30 years (aSHR = 2.01; 95%CI;1.11–3.63), being daily laborer(aSHR = 2.60; 95%CI;1.45–4.66), not receiving cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (aSHR = 2.66; 95%CI;1.68–4.21), not receiving isoniazid preventive therapy(aSHR = 4.57; 95% CI;1.60–13.08), ambulatory functional status (aSHR = 1.61; 95% CI; 1.02–2.51) and taking AZT-3TC-NVP medication at start of ART(aSHR = 2.01; 95% CI; 1.16–3.78) were significant predictors of lost to follow up. Conclusion In this study the incidence of lost to follow up was high. Young people, daily laborer, ambulatory patients and those taking AZT-3TC-NVP as well as those who did not take opportunistic prophylaxis were at higher risk of loss to follow up. Therefore, giving special attention to the high-risk groups for lost to follow up highlighted in this study could decrease the rate of LTFU."
https://openalex.org/W3002462178,"The antibiotic resistance crisis is becoming dire, yet in the past several years few potential antibiotics or adjuvants with novel modes of action have been identified. The bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, MscL, found in the majority of bacterial species, including pathogens, normally functions as an emergency release valve, sensing membrane tension upon low-osmotic stress and discharging cytoplasmic solutes before cell lysis. Opening the huge ~30Å diameter pore of MscL inappropriately is detrimental to the cell, allowing solutes from and even passage of drugs into to cytoplasm. Thus, MscL is a potential novel drug target. However, there are no known natural agonists, and small compounds that modulate MscL activity are just now being identified. Here we describe a small compound, K05, that specifically modulates MscL activity and we compare results with those obtained for the recently characterized MscL agonist 011A. While the structure of K05 only vaguely resembles 011A, many of the findings, including the binding pocket, are similar. On the other hand, both in vivo and molecular dynamic simulations indicate that the two compounds modulate MscL activity in significantly different ways."
https://openalex.org/W3003093215,"All data are prone to error and require data cleaning prior to analysis. An important example is longitudinal growth data, for which there are no universally agreed standard methods for identifying and removing implausible values and many existing methods have limitations that restrict their usage across different domains. A decision-making algorithm that modified or deleted growth measurements based on a combination of pre-defined cut-offs and logic rules was designed. Five data cleaning methods for growth were tested with and without the addition of the algorithm and applied to five different longitudinal growth datasets: four uncleaned canine weight or height datasets and one pre-cleaned human weight dataset with randomly simulated errors. Prior to the addition of the algorithm, data cleaning based on non-linear mixed effects models was the most effective in all datasets and had on average a minimum of 26.00% higher sensitivity and 0.12% higher specificity than other methods. Data cleaning methods using the algorithm had improved data preservation and were capable of correcting simulated errors according to the gold standard; returning a value to its original state prior to error simulation. The algorithm improved the performance of all data cleaning methods and increased the average sensitivity and specificity of the non-linear mixed effects model method by 7.68% and 0.42% respectively. Using non-linear mixed effects models combined with the algorithm to clean data allows individual growth trajectories to vary from the population by using repeated longitudinal measurements, identifies consecutive errors or those within the first data entry, avoids the requirement for a minimum number of data entries, preserves data where possible by correcting errors rather than deleting them and removes duplications intelligently. This algorithm is broadly applicable to data cleaning anthropometric data in different mammalian species and could be adapted for use in a range of other domains."
https://openalex.org/W3002663569,"Type three secretion systems (T3SS) are complex nano-machines that evolved to inject bacterial effector proteins directly into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. Many high-priority human pathogens rely on one or more T3SSs to cause disease and evade host immune responses, underscoring the need to better understand the mechanisms through which T3SSs function and their role(s) in supporting pathogen virulence. We recently identified the Shigella protein Spa47 as an oligomerization-activated T3SS ATPase that fuels the T3SS and supports overall Shigella virulence. Here, we provide both in vitro and in vivo characterization of Spa47 oligomerization and activation in the presence and absence of engineered ATPase-inactive Spa47 mutants. The findings describe mechanistic details of Spa47-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis and uncover critical distinctions between oligomerization mechanisms capable of supporting ATP hydrolysis in vitro and those that support T3SS function in vivo. Concentration-dependent ATPase kinetics and experiments combining wild-type and engineered ATPase inactive Spa47 mutants found that monomeric Spa47 species isolated from recombinant preparations exhibit low-level ATPase activity by forming short-lived oligomers with active site contributions from at least two protomers. In contrast, isolated Spa47 oligomers exhibit enhanced ATP hydrolysis rates that likely result from multiple preformed active sites within the oligomeric complex, as is predicted to occur within the context of the type three secretion system injectisome. High-resolution fluorescence microscopy, T3SS activity, and virulence phenotype analyses of Shigella strains co-expressing wild-type Spa47 and the ATPase inactive Spa47 mutants demonstrate that the N-terminus of Spa47, not ATPase activity, is responsible for incorporation into the injectisome where the mutant strains exhibit a dominant negative effect on T3SS function and Shigella virulence. Together, the findings presented here help to close a significant gap in our understanding of how T3SS ATPases are activated and define restraints with respect to how ATP hydrolysis is ultimately coupled to T3SS function in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3001438575,"Hydraulic properties of sandy soil from the Mu Us sandy land of Shaanxi Province were analyzed by using SEM technology. Soil porosity, the water characteristic curve, and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of aeolian sandy soil with added soft rock were analyzed, and fractal characteristics were established. Soil hydraulic properties revealed the effect of soft rock application on soil structure and hydraulic properties. Mass ratios of soft rock to aeolian sand were 1:5, 1:2, and 1:1. Results showed that the addition of soft rock can significantly increase the bulk density of sandy soil and reduce the total porosity and macroporosity. The mass fraction of water-stable aggregates greater than 0.25mm increases significantly, increasing the fractal dimension of soil pores; reducing the soil saturated water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity. SEM technology and pore fractal theory were used to predict the soil salinity curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the improved saline soil."
https://openalex.org/W3002203367,"Studies have identified prior conditions associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease dementia (LOAD), but all prior diseases have rarely been screened simultaneously in the literature. Our objective in the present study was to identify prior conditions associated with LOAD and construct pathways for them. We conducted a population-based matched case-control study based on data collected in the National Health Insurance Research database of Taiwan and the Catastrophic Illness Certificate database for the years 1997–2013. Prior diseases definitions were based on the first three digits of the codes listed in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). Inclusion criteria required that each ICD-code existed for at least 1 year and incurred at least 2 outpatient visits or inpatient diagnosis. The case group comprised 4,600 patients newly diagnosed with LOAD in 2007–2013. The LOAD patients were matched by sex and age to obtain 4,600 controls. Using stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis, diseases were screened for 1, 2 …, 9 years prior to the first diagnosis of LOAD. Path analysis was used to construct pathways between prior diseases and LOAD. Our results revealed that the following conditions were positively associated with the incidence of LOAD: anxiety (ICD-code 300), functional digestive disorder (ICD code 564), psychopathology-specific symptoms (ICD-code 307), disorders of the vestibular system (ICD-code 386), concussion (ICD-code 850), disorders of the urethra and urinary tract (ICD-code 599), disorders of refraction and accommodation (ICD-code 367), and hearing loss (ICD-code 389). A number of the prior diseases have previously been described in the literature in a manner identical to that in the present study. Our study supports the assertion that mental, hearing, vestibular system, and functional digestive disorders may play an important role in the pathogenesis of LOAD."
https://openalex.org/W3002269904,"Persistent pain and hypertension often co-occur, and share several biological and lifestyle risk factors. The present study aimed to provide insight into the prevalence of, and factors associated with, hypertension in the largest cohort of patients seeking treatment in 43 tertiary pain clinics in Australia. Adults aged > = 18 years registered to the electronic Persistent Pain Outcomes Collaboration registry between 2013 and 2018 were included if they had persistent non-cancer pain (N = 43,789). Risk Ratios (RRs) compared prevalence of self-reported hypertension with the general and primary care Australian populations, and logistic regression examined factors associated with hypertension. One in four (23.9%) patients had hypertension, which was higher than the Australian adult population (2014–15: RR = 5.86, 95%CI: 5.66, 6.06; 2017–18: RR = 9.40, 95%CI: 9.01, 9.80), and in primary care patients (2011–13: RR = 1.17, 95%CI: 1.15, 1.20). Adjusting for covariates, patients with higher odds of hypertension were older, lived in regions with higher socioeconomic disadvantage, had higher levels of BMI, were born outside the Oceania/Australasia region, and had comorbid arthritis, diabetes, or severe-extremely severe anxiety symptoms. Female patients and those with depression symptoms had lower adjusted odds. Unadjusted analyses showed an association between widespread pain, pain duration, pain severity and interference, and lower pain self-efficacy with hypertension; however, only pain severity remained significant in adjusted analyses. Hypertension was more prevalent in people with persistent pain than in the general community, was associated with more severe pain, and commonly co-occurred with pain-related impairments. Routine hypertension screening and treatment targeting shared mechanisms of hypertension and pain may improve treatment outcomes in the pain clinic setting."

The method does not require the derivatization of the analyte and uses separation and quantification by reversed-phase HPLC coupled to UV detection. Lipids were methanol/chloroform extracted following the method of Bligh and Dyer, and separated using isopropanol/acetonitrile/water (60/30/10, v/v/v) as mobile phase. We observed lineal detection in a wide range of concentrations, from 62.5 to 2000 ng/μL, and were able to detect a significant increase in the brain cholesterol levels between postnatal days 2 and 10 in C57BL6 mice. Based on our validation parameters, we consider this analytical method a useful tool to assess free cholesterol in rodent brain samples and cell cultures."
https://openalex.org/W3001828127,"Introduction Evidence regarding the performance of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment tools is limited in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Therefore, we assessed the agreement between various externally validated CVD risk assessment tools in the UAE. Methods A secondary analysis of the Abu Dhabi Screening Program for Cardiovascular Risk Markers (AD-SALAMA) data, a large population-based cross-sectional survey conducted in Abu Dhabi, UAE during the period 2009 until 2015, was performed in July 2019. The analysis included 2,621 participants without type 2 Diabetes and without history of cardiovascular diseases. The CVD risk assessment tools included in the analysis were the World Health Organization for Middle East and North Africa Region (WHO-MENA), the systematic coronary risk evaluation for high risk countries (SCORE-H), the pooled cohort risk equations for white (PCRE-W) and African Americans (PCRE-AA), the national cholesterol education program Framingham risk score (FRAM-ATP), and the laboratory Framingham risk score (FRAM-LAB). Results The overall concordance coefficient was 0.50. The agreement between SCORE-H and PCRE-W, PCRE-AA, FRAM-LAB, FRAM-ATP and WHO-MENA, were 0.47, 0.39, 0.0.25, 0.42 and 0.18, respectively. PCRE-AA classified the highest proportion of participants into high-risk category of CVD (16.4%), followed by PCRE-W (13.6%), FRAM-LAB (6.9%), SCORE-H (4.5%), FRAM-ATP (2.7%), and WHO-MENA (0.4%). Conclusions We found a poor agreement between various externally validated CVD risk assessment tools when applied to a large data collected in the UAE. This poses a challenge to choose any of these tools for clinical decision-making regarding the primary prevention of CVD in the country."

GBA mutation carriers with PD (PD-GBA) are at higher risk of cognitive decline, but there is limited data regarding whether there are differences in gait dysfunction between GBA mutation and non-mutation carriers with PD.


Objectives/Methods 
The primary aim of this study was to use quantitative inertial sensor-based gait analysis to compare gait asymmetry in 17 PD-GBA subjects, 17 non-mutation carriers with PD, and 15 healthy control subjects using parameters that had gait laterality and were markers of bradykinesia, in particular arm swing velocity and arm swing range of motion and stride length.


Results 
Arm swing velocity was more symmetric in PD-GBA subjects vs. non-mutation carriers in the OFF state (12.5 +/- 8.3 vs. 22.9 +/- 11.8%, respectively, p = 0.018). In the ON-medication state, non-mutation carriers with PD, but not PD-GBA subjects, exhibited arm swing velocity (16.8 +/- 8.6 vs. 22.9 +/- 11.8%, p = 0.006) and arm range of motion (26.7 +/- 16.3 vs. 33.4 +/- 18.6%, p = 0.02) that was more asymmetric compared with the OFF-medication state.


Conclusions 
In the OFF medication state, arm swing velocity asymmetry may be a useful parameter in helping to distinguish GBA mutation carriers with PD from non-mutation carriers."
https://openalex.org/W3002700454,"Introduction Particles in exhaled air (PEx) provide samples of respiratory tract lining fluid from small airways containing, for example, Surfactant protein A (SP-A) and albumin, potential biomarkers of small airway disease. We hypothesized that there are differences between morning, noon, and afternoon measurements and that the variability of repeated measurements is larger between days than within days. Methods PEx was obtained in sixteen healthy non-smoking adults on 11 occasions, within one day and between days. SP-A and albumin were quantified by ELISA. The coefficient of repeatability (CR), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and coefficient of variation (CV) were used to assess the variation of repeated measurements. Results SP-A and albumin increased significantly from morning towards the noon and afternoon by 13% and 25% on average, respectively, whereas PEx number concentration and particle mean mass did not differ significantly between the morning, noon and afternoon. Between-day CRs were not larger than within-day CRs. Conclusions Time of the day influences the contents of SP-A and albumin in exhaled particles. The variation of repeated measurements was rather high but was not influenced by the time intervals between measurements."
https://openalex.org/W3002725146,"Among the three overburden zones (the caving zone, the fracture zone, and the continuous deformation zone) in longwall coal mining, the continuous deformation zone is often considered to be continuous without cracks, so continuum mechanics can be used to calculate the subsidence of overburden strata. Longwall coal mining, however, will induce the generation of wide cracks in the surface and thus may cause the continuous deformation zone to fracture. In this paper, whether there are cracks in the continuous deformation zone as well as the height of overburden fracture in longwall face and the subsidence and deformation of strata of different fracture penetration ratios were studied by means of physical simulation, theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. The results show that: (1) Rock stratum starts to fracture as long as it has slightly subsided for only tens of millimeters, and the height of fracture development is the height of working face overburden. (2) With the increase of fracture penetration ratio, the subsidence of key strata remains basically unchanged; the surface deformation range and the maximum compression deformation decrease, while the maximum horizontal movement and maximum horizontal tensile deformation increase. Therefore, the subsidence of overburden strata which have fractured but have not broken can be calculated through the continuum mechanics method."
https://openalex.org/W3003019728,"Background Memantine, currently available for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, is an uncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate type of glutamate receptors. Under normal physiologic conditions, these unstimulated receptor ion channels are blocked by magnesium ions, which are displaced after agonist-induced depolarization. In humans, memantine administration is associated with different gastrointestinal dysmotility side effects (vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, motor-mediated abdominal pain), thus limiting its clinical use. Mechanism of these motility disorders has not been clarified yet. Pigs can be used in various preclinical experiments due to their relatively very similar gastrointestinal functions compared to humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a single and repeated doses of memantine on porcine gastric myoelectric activity evaluated by means of electrogastrography (EGG). Methods Six adult female experimental pigs (Sus scrofa f. domestica, mean weight 41.7±5.0 kg) entered the study for two times. The first EGG was recorded after a single intragastric dose of memantine (20 mg). In the second part, EGG was accomplished after 7-day intragastric administration (20 mg per day). All EGG recordings were performed under general anaesthesia. Basal (15 minutes) and study recordings (120 minutes) were accomplished using an EGG stand (MMS, Enschede, the Netherlands). Running spectral analysis based on Fourier transform was used. Results were expressed as dominant frequency of gastric slow waves (DF) and power analysis (areas of amplitudes). Results Single dose of memantine significantly increased DF, from basic values (1.65±1.05 cycles per min.) to 2.86 cpm after 30 min. (p = 0.008), lasting till 75 min. (p = 0.014). Basal power (median 452; inter-quartile range 280–1312 μV^2) raised after 15 min. (median 827; IQR 224–2769; p = 0.386; NS), lasting next 30 min. Repetitively administrated memantine caused important gastric arrhythmia. Basal DF after single and repeated administration was not different, however, a DF increase in the second part was more prominent (up to 3.18±2.16 after 15 and 30 min., p<0.001). In comparison with a single dose, basal power was significantly higher after repetitively administrated memantine (median 3940; IQR 695–15023 μV^2; p<0.001). Next dose of 20 mg memantine in the second part induced a prominent drop of power after 15 min. (median 541; IQR 328–2280 μV^2; p<0.001), lasting till 120 min. (p<0.001). Conclusions Both single and repeated doses of memantine increased DF. Severe gastric arrhythmia and long-lasting low power after repeated administration might explain possible gastric dysmotility side effects in the chronic use of memantine."
https://openalex.org/W3001476792,"Resistance to chronic Toxoplasma gondii infection requires ongoing recruitment of T cells to the brain. Thus, the factors that promote, sustain, and regulate the T cell response to the parasite in the brain are of great interest. The costimulatory molecule ICOS (inducible T cell costimulator) has been reported to act largely through the PI3K pathway in T cells, and can play pro-inflammatory or pro-regulatory roles depending on the inflammatory context and T cell type being studied. During infection with T. gondii, ICOS promotes early T cell responses, while in the chronic stage of infection ICOS plays a regulatory role by limiting T cell responses in the brain. We sought to characterize the role of ICOS signaling through PI3K during chronic infection using two models of ICOS deficiency: total ICOS knockout (KO) mice and ICOS YF mice that are unable to activate PI3K signaling. Overall, ICOS KO and ICOS YF mice had similar severe defects in parasite-specific IgG production and parasite control compared to WT mice. Additionally, we observed expanded effector T cell populations and a loss of Treg frequency in the brains of both ICOS KO and ICOS YF mice. When comparing the remaining Treg populations in infected mice, ICOS KO Tregs expressed WT levels of Foxp3 and CD25, while ICOS YF Tregs expressed significantly less Foxp3 and CD25 compared to both WT and ICOS KO mice. Together, these results suggest that PI3K-independent signaling downstream of ICOS plays an important role in Treg stability in the context of chronic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3001517760,"In order to gain insights into how the effects of the uneven adoption of Medicaid expansion varies across the rural/urban spectrum and between racial/ethnic groups in the United States, this research used the fertility question in the 2011-2015 American Community Survey to link infants' records to their mothers' household health insurance status. This preliminary exploration of the Medicaid expansion used logistic regression to examine the probability that an infant will be born without health insurance coverage. Overall, the states that adopted Medicaid expansion improved the health insurance coverage for households with infants. However, rural households with infants report lower percentages of coverage than urban households with infants. Furthermore, the rural/urban gap in health insurance coverage is wider in states that adopted the Medicaid expansion. Additionally, Hispanic infants remain significantly less likely to have health insurance coverage compared to Non-Hispanic White infants. Understanding infant health insurance coverage across ethnic/racial groups and the rural/urban spectrum will become increasingly important as the U.S. population transitions to a minority-majority and also becomes more urban. Although not a perfect solution, our findings showed that the Medicaid expansion of health insurance coverage had a mainly overall positive effect on the percentage of U.S. households with infants who have health insurance coverage."
https://openalex.org/W3001512130,"Background Meteorological conditions are potential determinants of physical activity (PA). A profound understanding of the determinants of PA behaviour is required for PA promotion. This study examined the association between accelerometer-assessed PA and meteorological conditions among older adults. Methods This cross-sectional study included data of 577 adults aged 65–75 years living in Bremen, Germany (52% female; 3278 days). PA was measured with accelerometers for seven consecutive days (10/15-08/16). A threshold of 240 lx was used to differentiate between outdoor physical activity (OPA) and indoor physical activity (IPA). Linear mixed models estimated the association between PA (daily accelerometer counts per minute (CPM)) and meteorological factors (temperature, cloud cover, wind, and no precipitation) derived by principal component analysis. Results The analyses showed associations between PA in CPM and the meteorological factors temperature (93.7; 95%-CL: 64.9, 122.5) and no precipitation (48.4; 95%-CL: 19.8, 77.0) in women and wind (-40.3; 95%-CL: -59.7, -20.8) and no precipitation (30.1; 95%-CL: 5.6, 54.6) in men. After distinguishing in OPA and IPA for a subsample of 128 participants (473 days), the sex differences were no longer present. OPA in CPM was associated with temperature (women: 174.5; 95%-CL: 81.3, 267.6; men: 183.3; 95%-CL: 81.2, 285.4), cloud cover (women: -153.0; 95%-CL: -200.3, -105.7; men: -123.2; 95%-CL: -174.7, -71.7), and wind (women: -118.6; 95%-CL: -189.6; -47.7; men: -96.9; 95%-CL: -177.0, -16.7). No association between OPA and no precipitation was found (women: 2.9; 95%-CL: -89.0, 94.8; men: -17.1; 95%-CL: -116.7, 82.4). Conclusions The results of this study emphasize the importance of meteorological conditions as environmental determinants of PA among older adults. Meteorological conditions should be accounted for in the unbiased assessment of habitual PA and the development of PA promotion programs. Future research should focus on the associations of OPA and IPA with meteorological conditions in different climatic regions."

We evaluated emergency department visit outcomes up to 1 year after pediatric TBI, in comparison to a referent group of trauma patients without TBI. We performed a longitudinal, retrospective study of all pediatric trauma patients who presented to emergency departments and hospitals in California from 2005 to 2014. We compared emergency department visits, dispositions, revisits, readmissions, and mortality in pediatric trauma patients with a TBI diagnosis to those without TBI (Other Trauma patients). We identified 208,222 pediatric patients with an index diagnosis of TBI and 1,314,064 patients with an index diagnosis of Other Trauma. Population growth adjusted TBI visits increased by 5.6% while those for Other Trauma decreased by 40.7%. The majority of patients were discharged from the emergency department on their first visit (93.2% for traumatic brain injury vs. 96.5% for Other Trauma). A greater proportion of TBI patients revisited the emergency department (33.4% vs. 3.0%) or were readmitted to the hospital (0.9% vs. 0.04%) at least once within a year of discharge. The health burden within a year after a pediatric TBI visit is considerable and is greater than that of non-TBI trauma. These data suggest that outpatient strategies to monitor for short-term and longer-term sequelae after pediatric TBI are needed to improve patient outcomes, lessen the burden on families, and more appropriately allocate resources in the healthcare system."

Methods In our previous research, we have generated a melanocyte-lineage mTOR hyperactivation mouse model (Mitf-M-Cre Tsc2 KO mice; cKO mice) to investigate mTOR pathway in melanogenesis regulation, markedly reduced skin pigmentation was observed. Very unexpectedly, spontaneous recurrent epilepsy was also developed in this mouse model. Results Compared with control littermates, no change was found in either brain size or brain mass in cKO mice. Hematoxylin staining revealed no obvious aberrant histologic features in the whole brains of cKO mice. Histoimmunofluorescence staining and electron microscopy examination revealed markedly increased mTOR signaling and hyperproliferation of mitochondria in cKO mice, especially in the hippocampus. Furthermore, rapamycin treatment reversed these abnormalities. Conclusions This study suggests that our melanocyte-lineage mTOR hyperactivation mouse is a novel animal model of epilepsy, which may promote the progress of both epilepsy and neurophysiology research."
https://openalex.org/W3002718670,"Rice flag leaves are major source organs providing more than half of the nutrition needed for rice seed development. The dynamic metabolic changes in rice flag leaves and the detailed metabolic relationship between source and sink organs in rice, however, remain largely unknown. In this study, the metabolic changes of flag leaves in two japonica and two indica rice cultivars were investigated using non-targeted metabolomics approach. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that flag leaf metabolomes varied significantly depending on both species and developmental stage. Only a few of the metabolites in flag leaves displayed the same change pattern across the four tested cultivars along the process of seed development. Further association analysis found that levels of 45 metabolites in seeds that are associated with human nutrition and health correlated significantly with their levels in flag leaves. Comparison of metabolomics of flag leaves and seeds revealed that some flavonoids were specific or much higher in flag leaves while some lipid metabolites such as phospholipids were much higher in seeds. This reflected not only the function of the tissue specific metabolism but also the different physiological properties and metabolic adaptive features of these two tissues."

We investigated the extent to which canopy ectomycorrhizal communities contribute to overall diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with silver beech. Hyphal ingrowth bags were buried for 12 months in canopy and terrestrial soils of five trees at one site. We used amplicon sequencing of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 region (ITS2) to assess diversity of both ectomycorrhizal and non-ectomycorrhizal OTUs in hyphal ingrowth bags. There was a significant difference in ectomycorrhizal fungal community diversity between the terrestrial and canopy hyphal ingrowth bag communities. Ectomycorrhizal community composition of the terrestrial and canopy environments was also significantly different. Some ectomycorrhizal taxa were significantly differentially represented in either the terrestrial or canopy environment. The hyphal ingrowth bags also accumulated non-ectomycorrhizal species. The non-ectomycorrhizal fungi also had significantly different diversity and community composition between the canopy and terrestrial environments. Like the ectomycorrhizal community, some non-ectomycorrhizal taxa were significantly differentially represented in either the terrestrial or canopy environment. The canopy soil microhabitat provides a novel environment for growth of ectomycorrhizal adventitious roots and enables the spatial partitioning of ectomycorrhizal and non-ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity in the forest."
https://openalex.org/W3001813124,"Introduction Brazil ranks second in the absolute number of transplantations in the world. Despite improvements in graft survival, many patients will progress to graft loss and return to dialysis. Concerns exist regarding adverse clinical outcomes in this population when undergone peritoneal dialysis (PD). Objective To compare the occurrence of mortality, technique failure, and peritonitis among incident patients in PD coming from either Tx or pre-dialysis treatment. Methodology A retrospective study in which 47 adult patients with Tx failure (Tx group) were matched for age, gender, diabetes mellitus (DM), modality and start year of PD, with 1:1 predialysis patient (nTx group). The Fine-Gray competing risk model was used to analyze mortality and technique failure. Results Compared to nTx, the Tx group had a lower body mass index, serum potassium, and albumin concentrations. A higher ferritin level, transferrin saturation and the number of patients with positive serology for viral hepatitis were also observed in the Tx group. In the multivariate analysis, patients of the Tx group had 4.4-times higher risk of death (p = 0.007), with infection as the main cause. Technique failure and peritonitis were similar in both groups. Conclusion Previous Tx is a risk factor for mortality but not for technique failure or peritonitis in incident patients on a PD program."
https://openalex.org/W3001871623,"Insect herbivores have the potential to change both physical and chemical traits of their host plant. Although the impacts of herbivores on their hosts have been widely studied, experiments assessing changes in multiple leaf traits or functions simultaneously are still rare. We experimentally tested whether herbivory by winter moth (Operophtera brumata) caterpillars and mechanical leaf wounding changed leaf mass per area, leaf area, leaf carbon and nitrogen content, and the concentrations of 27 polyphenol compounds on oak (Quercus robur) leaves. To investigate how potential changes in the studied traits affect leaf functioning, we related the traits to the rates of leaf photosynthesis and respiration. Overall, we did not detect any clear effects of herbivory or mechanical leaf damage on the chemical or physical leaf traits, despite clear effect of herbivory on photosynthesis. Rather, the trait variation was primarily driven by variation between individual trees. Only leaf nitrogen content and a subset of the studied polyphenol compounds correlated with photosynthesis and leaf respiration. Our results suggest that in our study system, abiotic conditions related to the growth location, variation between tree individuals, and seasonal trends in plant physiology are more important than herbivory in determining the distribution and composition of leaf chemical and structural traits."
https://openalex.org/W3001978761,"Background and aim No previous study examined the association between whole-day water intake and odds of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We examined the association between whole-day water intake and odds of IBS in a large sample of Iranian adults. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among 4763 adults in Isfahan, Iran. Daily water intake was assessed using a pre-tested questionnaire by asking questions about the average number of glasses of water consumed in a day. IBS was assessed and defined using a modified Persian version of Rome III questionnaire. Results After taking potential confounders into account, no significant association between water consumption and odds of IBS was seen (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.74–1.78). We observed that participants who were taking >8 glasses/d of water had greater odds of IBS-M in comparison to those who consumed <2 glasses daily (OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.01–4.22). No significant association was observed between water intake and odds of IBS in either gender as well [for men: OR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.59–2.24 and for women: OR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.62–2.12]. By BMI status, no significant association was observed between whole day water intake and odds of IBS among normal weight (BMI<25 kg/m2) or overweight and obese people (BMI≥25 kg/m2).

https://openalex.org/W3002047056,"In recent years, multidrug resistance of Shigella strains associated with genetic elements like pathogenicity islands, have become a public health problem. The Shigella resistance locus pathogenicity island (SRL PAI) of S. flexneri 2a harbors a 16Kbp region that contributes to the multidrug resistance phenotype. However, there is not much information about other functions such as metabolic, physiologic or ecological ones. For that, wild type S. flexneri YSH6000 strain, and its spontaneous SRL PAI mutant, 1363, were used to study the contribution of the island in different growth conditions. Interestingly, when both strains were compared by the Phenotype Microarrays, the ability to metabolize D-aspartic acid as a carbon source was detected in the wild type strain but not in the mutant. When D-aspartate was added to minimal medium with other carbon sources such as mannose or mannitol, the SRL PAI-positive strain was able to metabolize it, while the SRL PAI-negative strain did not. In order to identify the genetic elements responsible for this phenotype, a bioinformatic analysis was performed and two genes belonging to SRL PAI were found: orf8, coding for a putative aspartate racemase, and orf9, coding for a transporter. Thus, it was possible to measure, by an indirect analysis of racemization activity in minimal medium supplemented only with D-aspartate, that YSH6000 strain was able to transform the D-form into L-, while the mutant was impaired to do it. When the orf8-orf9 region from SRL island was transformed into S. flexneri and S. sonnei SRL PAI-negative strains, the phenotype was restored. Although, when single genes were cloned into plasmids, no complementation was observed. Our results strongly suggest that the aspartate racemase and the transporter encoded in the SRL pathogenicity island are important for bacterial survival in environments rich in D-aspartate."
https://openalex.org/W3000886334,"Previous research has supported that personality traits can act to a precursor to media preferences. Due to the ongoing association between morality and media preferences in public and political discourse (e.g., blaming immoral behaviours on media preferences), this research sought to expand the knowledge about factors that contribute to media preferences by investigating if moral reasoning styles explain some of the variance that was not already explained by personality traits. A specific form of media preferences were chosen - lyrical preferences in metal music - as claims between metal lyrical themes and behaviour have been ongoing since the 1980s, despite a lack of empirical evidence to support these claims. A lyrical preferences scale was developed, and utilizing this scale, it was found that different types of metal fans exhibit different moral reasoning styles dependent on their metal sub-genre identification. Further, it was found that moral reasoning styles explain a portion of the variance in lyrical preferences that weren't already explained by personality traits. In particular, lyrical preferences were often thematically consistent with moral reasoning content and personality traits, such as that individuals that preferred lyrics about celebrating metal culture and unity had higher levels of the group loyalty moral reasoning domain alongside being higher in extraversion. The implications of moral reasoning styles and personality traits as being precursors to media preferences are discussed."

This study examines the early stages of demyelination and long-term consequences of demyelination and remyelination on axon survival or loss. Myelin vacuolation is the primary defect leading to myelin breakdown, demyelination then prompt remyelination in the spinal cord and brain. There is no evidence of oligodendrocyte death. The spinal cord dorsal column is initially spared yet eventually becomes severely demyelinated with subsequent loss of axons in the core and then surface of the fasciculus gracilis. However remyelination of the sub-pial axons in the dorsal column results in their protection. While there was a lack of biochemical evidence of Vitamin B12 deficiency, the pathological similarities of FIDID with sub-acute combined degeneration (SCD) led us to explore treatment with Vitamin B12. Treatment led to recovery or improvement in some cats and neurologic relapse on cessation of B12 therapy. While the reason that irradiated food is myelinotoxic in the cat remains unresolved, nonetheless the neuropathological changes match exactly what is seen in SCD and its models and provide an ideal model to study the cellular and molecular basis of remyelination."
https://openalex.org/W3001271520,"Alignment of structural RNAs is an important problem with a wide range of applications. Since function is often determined by molecular structure, RNA alignment programs should take into account both sequence and base-pairing information for structural homology identification. This paper describes C++ software, RNAmountAlign, for RNA sequence/structure alignment that runs in O(n3) time and O(n2) space for two sequences of length n; moreover, our software returns a p-value (transformable to expect value E) based on Karlin-Altschul statistics for local alignment, as well as parameter fitting for local and global alignment. Using incremental mountain height, a representation of structural information computable in cubic time, RNAmountAlign implements quadratic time pairwise local, global and global/semiglobal (query search) alignment using a weighted combination of sequence and structural similarity. RNAmountAlign is capable of performing progressive multiple alignment as well. Benchmarking of RNAmountAlign against LocARNA, LARA, FOLDALIGN, DYNALIGN, STRAL, MXSCARNA, and MUSCLE shows that RNAmountAlign has reasonably good accuracy and faster run time supporting all alignment types. Additionally, our extension of RNAmountAlign, called RNAmountAlignScan, which scans a target genome sequence to find hits having high sequence and structural similarity to a given query sequence, outperforms RSEARCH and sequence-only query scans and runs faster than FOLDALIGN query scan."
https://openalex.org/W3001621945,"Improved capabilities in microfluidics, electrochemistry, and portable assays have resulted in the development of a wide range of point-of-use sensors intended for environmental, medical, and agricultural applications in resource-limited environments of developing countries. However, these devices are frequently developed without direct interaction with their often-remote intended user base, creating the potential for a disconnect between users’ actual needs and those perceived by sensor developers. As different analytical techniques have inherent strengths and limitations, effective measurement solution development requires determination of desired sensor attributes early in the development process. In this work, we present our findings on design priorities for point-of-use microbial water sensors based on fieldwork in rural India, as well as a guide to fieldwork methodologies for determining desired sensor attributes. We utilized group design workshops for initial identification of design priorities, and then conducted choice-based conjoint analysis interviews for quantification of user preferences among these priorities. We found the highest user preference for integrated reporting of contaminant concentration and recommended actions, as well as significant preferences for mostly reusable sensor architectures, same-day results, and combined ingredients. These findings serve as a framework for future microbial sensor development and a guide for fieldwork-based understanding of user needs."
https://openalex.org/W3001886932,"Accounting for imperfect detection is an important process when obtaining estimates of density or abundance for breeding birds, and this is particularly true when researchers are monitoring birds to assess the success of restored wetlands. Due to the dramatic decline in areal cover and habitat quality, wetland restoration in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) is critically important to breeding birds. The Shallow Lakes Restoration Project (SLRP), a partnership between the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and Ducks Unlimited, Inc., aims to restore degraded shallow lakes throughout the Iowa PPR. We conducted unlimited-radius point counts with call-broadcast surveys for breeding marsh birds at 30 shallow lakes in various stages of restoration in 2016 and 2017. Our goals were to assess the impact of covariates on detection probability and estimate density of these species at non-restored, younger (1–5 years since restoration), and older (6–11 years since restoration) restorations. Detection probability ranged between 0.07 ± 0.009 (SE) for Red-winged Blackbird and 0.40 ± 0.09 (SE) for Common Yellowthroat. Percent cattail had a positive quadratic effect on detection probability for four species, with detection decreasing sharply as percent cattail increased and increasing slightly with 100% cattail cover. Wind speed negatively influenced the detection probability of Pied-billed Grebes but had a negative quadratic effect on the detection probability of Marsh Wrens. Both restored shallow lakes had greater densities of breeding Pied-billed Grebes, Marsh Wrens, and Yellow-headed Blackbirds than non-restored shallow lakes, but there was no significant difference between younger and older restorations. Including both habitat and environmental covariates on models for detection probability can improve the precision of estimates for density and should be considered when assessing bird populations pre- and post-restoration of shallow lakes."
https://openalex.org/W3003100825,"To assess the efficacy and safety of the second-generation probe of ultrasonic circular cyclocoagulation (UC3) in naive or refractory glaucoma, with a 6-month follow-up.A retrospective consecutive case-series study included patients having a UC3 procedure with the second-generation probe of the EyeOP1 device, intraocular pressure (IOP) ≥ 21 mmHg and under maximum tolerated medical treatment, with or without previous glaucoma surgery. Surgical success was defined at the 6-month post-operative visit as IOP > 5 and ≤ 21 mmHg with IOP reduction ≥ 20% from baseline, without any reoperation, and visual acuity better than negative light perception.100 patients were included and 97 (97.0%; 97 eyes) attended the 6-month follow-up. At 6 months, surgical success was obtained in 48 eyes (49.5%). Intraocular pressure was reduced from a mean ± SD preoperative value of 28.0 ± 5.6 mmHg to 19.3 ± 7.1 mmHg at 6 months (p<0.0001). The proportion of eyes requiring oral acetazolamide decreased from 57.0% to 30.0% between baseline and 6 months after surgery (p = 0.0007). We observed 15 (15.0%) cases of postsurgical macular edema, 8 (8.0%) of hypotony, and 20 (20.0%) of visual acuity loss > 2 Snellen lines. Postsurgical macular edema was associated with a history of epiretinal membranes, uveitis or retinal detachment. Risk factors for hypotony were a history of diabetes or trabeculectomy.The second-generation UC3 probe significantly reduced IOP in eyes with naive and refractory glaucoma but severe post-operative complications were often observed. Further studies are needed to better identify responders and decrease the high risk for complications associated with the procedure."
https://openalex.org/W3002869784,"This study aimed to examine age-specific reference intervals and growth dynamics of the best fit for liver dimensions on the diaphragmatic surface of the fetal liver. The research material consisted of 69 human fetuses of both sexes (32♂, 37♀) aged 18-30 weeks. Using methods of anatomical dissection, digital image analysis and statistics, a total of 10 measurements and 2 calculations were performed. No statistical significant differences between sexes were found (p>0.05). The parameters studied displayed growth models that followed natural logarithmic functions. The mean value of the transverse-to-vertical diameter ratio of the liver throughout the analyzed period was 0.71±0.11. The isthmic ratio decreased significantly from 0.81±0.12 in the 18-19th week to 0.62±0.06 in the 26-27th week, and then increased to 0.68±0.11 in the 28-30th week of fetal life (p<0.01). The morphometric parameters of the diaphragmatic surface of the liver present age-specific reference data. No sex differences are found. The transverse-to-vertical diameter ratio supports a proportionate growth of the fetal liver. Quantitative anatomy of the growing liver may be of relevance in both the ultrasound monitoring of the fetal development and the early detection of liver anomalies."
