https://openalex.org/W4284696817,"Abstract As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and evolve, detecting emerging variants early is critical for public health interventions. Inferring lineage prevalence by clinical testing is infeasible at scale, especially in areas with limited resources, participation, or testing and/or sequencing capacity, which can also introduce biases 1–3 . SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater successfully tracks regional infection dynamics and provides less biased abundance estimates than clinical testing 4,5 . Tracking virus genomic sequences in wastewater would improve community prevalence estimates and detect emerging variants. However, two factors limit wastewater-based genomic surveillance: low-quality sequence data and inability to estimate relative lineage abundance in mixed samples. Here we resolve these critical issues to perform a high-resolution, 295-day wastewater and clinical sequencing effort, in the controlled environment of a large university campus and the broader context of the surrounding county. We developed and deployed improved virus concentration protocols and deconvolution software that fully resolve multiple virus strains from wastewater. We detected emerging variants of concern up to 14 days earlier in wastewater samples, and identified multiple instances of virus spread not captured by clinical genomic surveillance. Our study provides a scalable solution for wastewater genomic surveillance that allows early detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants and identification of cryptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W4284675681,"Sleep has a complex micro-architecture, encompassing micro-arousals, sleep spindles and transitions between sleep stages. Fragmented sleep impairs memory consolidation, whereas spindle-rich and delta-rich non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep promote it. However, the relationship between micro-arousals and memory-promoting aspects of sleep remains unclear. In this study, we used fiber photometry in mice to examine how release of the arousal mediator norepinephrine (NE) shapes sleep micro-architecture. Here we show that micro-arousals are generated in a periodic pattern during NREM sleep, riding on the peak of locus-coeruleus-generated infraslow oscillations of extracellular NE, whereas descending phases of NE oscillations drive spindles. The amplitude of NE oscillations is crucial for shaping sleep micro-architecture related to memory performance: prolonged descent of NE promotes spindle-enriched intermediate state and REM sleep but also associates with awakenings, whereas shorter NE descents uphold NREM sleep and micro-arousals. Thus, the NE oscillatory amplitude may be a target for improving sleep in sleep disorders. Kjaerby and Andersen et al. show that norepinephrine (NE) plays profound roles in shaping sleep micro-architecture. NE slowly oscillates during sleep, with NE oscillatory amplitude being a major determinant of spindle-dependent memory consolidation and awakenings."

https://openalex.org/W4284689812,"A key bottleneck in the microbial production of therapeutic plant metabolites is identifying enzymes that can improve yield. The facile identification of genetically encoded biosensors can overcome this limitation and become part of a general method for engineering scaled production. We have developed a combined screening and selection approach that quickly refines the affinities and specificities of generalist transcription factors; using RamR as a starting point, we evolve highly specific (>100-fold preference) and sensitive (half-maximum effective concentration (EC50) < 30 μM) biosensors for the alkaloids tetrahydropapaverine, papaverine, glaucine, rotundine and noscapine. High-resolution structures reveal multiple evolutionary avenues for the malleable effector-binding site and the creation of new pockets for different chemical moieties. These sensors further enabled the evolution of a streamlined pathway for tetrahydropapaverine, a precursor to four modern pharmaceuticals, collapsing multiple methylation steps into a single evolved enzyme. Our methods for evolving biosensors enable the rapid engineering of pathways for therapeutic alkaloids. A combined screening and selection approach enables the evolution of the generalist transcription factor RamR into specific and sensitive biosensors for various alkaloids and in turn a streamlined pathway for tetrahydropapaverine biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4284709570,"The tumour suppressor p53 and PI3K-AKT pathways have fundamental roles in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis, and are frequently mutated in cancer. Here, we show that genotoxic stress induces nuclear AKT activation through a p53-dependent mechanism that is distinct from the canonical membrane-localized PI3K-AKT pathway. Following genotoxic stress, a nuclear PI3K binds p53 in the non-membranous nucleoplasm to generate a complex of p53 and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), which recruits AKT, PDK1 and mTORC2 to activate AKT and phosphorylate FOXO proteins, thereby inhibiting DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Wild-type p53 activates nuclear AKT in an on/off fashion following stress, whereas mutant p53 dose-dependently stimulates high basal AKT activity. The p53-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 complex is dephosphorylated to p53-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by PTEN to inhibit AKT activation. The nuclear p53-phosphoinositide signalosome is distinct from the canonical membrane-localized pathway and insensitive to PI3K inhibitors currently in the clinic, which underscores its therapeutic relevance."
https://openalex.org/W4284683820,"A large body of evidence has indicated that the phasic responses of midbrain dopamine neurons show a remarkable similarity to a type of teaching signal (temporal difference (TD) error) used in machine learning. However, previous studies failed to observe a key prediction of this algorithm: that when an agent associates a cue and a reward that are separated in time, the timing of dopamine signals should gradually move backward in time from the time of the reward to the time of the cue over multiple trials. Here we demonstrate that such a gradual shift occurs both at the level of dopaminergic cellular activity and dopamine release in the ventral striatum in mice. Our results establish a long-sought link between dopaminergic activity and the TD learning algorithm, providing fundamental insights into how the brain associates cues and rewards that are separated in time."
https://openalex.org/W4284704507,"Human untargeted metabolomics studies annotate only ~10% of molecular features. We introduce reference-data-driven analysis to match metabolomics tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data against metadata-annotated source data as a pseudo-MS/MS reference library. Applying this approach to food source data, we show that it increases MS/MS spectral usage 5.1-fold over conventional structural MS/MS library matches and allows empirical assessment of dietary patterns from untargeted data. Metabolomics is improved by using a reference library of both known and unknown molecules."
https://openalex.org/W4284666963,"The abundance of recorded protein sequence data stands in contrast to the small number of experimentally verified functional annotation. Here we screened a million-membered metagenomic library at ultrahigh throughput in microfluidic droplets for β-glucuronidase activity. We identified SN243, a genuine β-glucuronidase with little homology to previously studied enzymes of this type, as a glycoside hydrolase 3 family member. This glycoside hydrolase family contains only one recently added β-glucuronidase, showing that a functional metagenomic approach can shed light on assignments that are currently ‘unpredictable’ by bioinformatics. Kinetic analyses of SN243 characterized it as a promiscuous catalyst and structural analysis suggests regions of divergence from homologous glycoside hydrolase 3 members creating a wide-open active site. With a screening throughput of >107 library members per day, picolitre-volume microfluidic droplets enable functional assignments that complement current enzyme database dictionaries and provide bridgeheads for the annotation of unexplored sequence space. Functional screening of a large metagenomic library with a droplet microfluidics platform enabled the discovery of SN243, a bacterial β-glucuronidase from the glycoside hydrolase 3 family, which was characterized structurally and biochemically."
https://openalex.org/W4284706855,"Abstract Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play critical roles in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, their involvement in sunitinib resistance remains largely unknown. Herein, we identified a novel circRNA, named circME1, which contributes to sunitinib resistance development in ccRCC. CircME1 also promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion of ccRCC cells. Further mechanism analysis showed that circME1 interacted with U1 snRNP at the promoter of its parental gene ME1, thereby upregulating the expression of ME1, enhancing aerobic glycolysis of ccRCC, and promoting its malignant phenotype. Furthermore, ME1 specific inhibitor could effectively repress the oncogenic functions of circME1. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the circME1/ME1 pathway is involved in ccRCC progression and sunitinib resistance development, which may be exploited for anticancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W4283815482,"Complex cellular processes are driven by the regulated assembly and disassembly of large multiprotein complexes. While we are beginning to understand the molecular mechanism for assembly of the eukaryotic DNA replication machinery (replisome), we still know relatively little about the regulation of its disassembly at replication termination. Recently, the first elements of this process have emerged, revealing that the replicative helicase, at the heart of the replisome, is polyubiquitylated prior to unloading and that this unloading requires p97 segregase activity. Two different E3 ubiquitin ligases have now been shown to ubiquitylate the helicase under different conditions: Cul2Lrr1 and TRAIP. Here, using Xenopus laevis egg extract cell-free system and biochemical approaches, we have found two p97 cofactors, Ubxn7 and Faf1, which can interact with p97 during replisome disassembly during S-phase. We show only Ubxn7, however, facilitates efficient replisome disassembly. Ubxn7 delivers this role through its interaction via independent domains with both Cul2Lrr1 and p97 to allow coupling between Mcm7 ubiquitylation and its removal from chromatin. Our data therefore characterize Ubxn7 as the first substrate-specific p97 cofactor regulating replisome disassembly in vertebrates and a rationale for the efficacy of the Cul2Lrr1 replisome unloading pathway in unperturbed S-phase."
https://openalex.org/W4284689645,"Background Despite abundant data on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, 3 important knowledge gaps continue to exist, i.e., 1) studies from low-/middle income countries (LMICs); 2) studies in the later period of the COVID-19 pandemic; and 3) studies on non-hospitalized asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients. To address the knowledge gaps, we assessed the prevalence of and the risk factors for mental health symptoms among non-hospitalized asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients in one LMIC (Indonesia) during the later period of the pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in September 2020 in East Java province, Indonesia. Study population consisted of non-hospitalized asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients who were diagnosed based on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction results from nasopharyngeal swab. Mental health symptoms were evaluated using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. Results From 778 non-hospitalized asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients, 608 patients were included in the analysis. Patients’ median age was 35 years old and 61.2% were male. Of these, 22 (3.6%) reported symptoms of depression, 87 (14.3%) reported symptoms of anxiety, and 48 (7.9%) reported symptoms of stress. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that females were more likely to report symptoms of stress (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.98, p-value = 0.028); healthcare workers were more likely to report symptoms of depression and anxiety (aOR = 5.57, p-value = 0.002 and aOR = 2.92, p-value = 0.014, respectively); and those with a recent history of self-quarantine were more likely to report symptoms of depression and stress (aOR 5.18, p = 0.004 and aOR = 1.86, p = 0.047, respectively). Conclusion The reported prevalence of mental health symptoms, especially depression, was relatively low among non-hospitalized asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients during the later period of the COVID-19 pandemic in East Java province, Indonesia. In addition, several risk factors have been identified."

https://openalex.org/W4284665171,"WTAP, an essential component of the RNA N-6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification complex, guides METLL3-METLL14 heteroduplexes to target RNAs in the nuclear speckles of mammalian cells. Here, we show that TTC22 is widely coexpressed with WTAP and FTO in many human tissues by mining Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) datasets. Our results indicate that the direct interaction of TTC22 with 60S ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4) promotes the binding of WTAP mRNA to RPL4, enhances the stability and translation efficiency of WTAP mRNA, and consequently increases the level of WTAP protein. Also, WTAP mRNA itself is an m6A target and YTHDF1 is characterized as an essential m6A binding protein interacting with m6A-modified WTAP mRNA. TTC22 triggers a positive feedback loop between WTAP expression and WTAP mRNA m6A modification, leading to an increased m6A level in total RNA. The knockdown of RPL4, WTAP, or YTHDF1 expression diminishes the TTC22-induced increase in the m6A level of total RNA. Thus, TTC22 caused dramatic expression changes in genes related to metabolic pathways, ribosomal biogenesis, the RNA spliceosome, and microorganism infections. Importantly, TTC22 upregulates the expression of SNAI1 by increasing m6A level and thus promotes lung metastases of colon cancer cells in mice. In conclusion, our study showed that TTC22 upregulates WTAP and SNAI1 expression, which contributes to TTC22-induced colon cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W4284677807,"Objectives Acute phase reactants (APRs) are proteins altered by inflammation and are regarded as surrogate markers representing inflammatory status. This study evaluated changes of albumin (Alb), prealbumin (Palb), and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) in patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) in response to alterations in disease activity and the correlation between disease activity and Alb, Palb, and IMA. Methods Fifty-nine patients with AAV registered in the prospective SHAVE cohort, who had available serial blood samples at least three months apart were included (indicated as pre and post). Correlation analysis and linear regression were carried out to determine the relationship between continuous variables. Alb, Palb, and IMA levels in 40 healthy controls (HCs) were compared with patients with AAV. Results Comparison of Alb, Palb, and IMA levels in HCs and in patients at initial (pre) and follow-up (post) time points revealed that Alb levels significantly increased following the improvement of disease activity and were comparable between HCs and patients at follow-up (post). Meanwhile, there was no significant difference noted in Palb and IMA levels after the decrease of disease activity. While initial (pre) Alb and Palb were significantly associated with BVAS, a subgroup analysis of patients with new-onset disease showed Palb was no longer significantly associated with Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS). Multivariate linear regression showed Alb level (standardized β = -0.377; 95% confidence interval: -5.623, -1.260; p = 0.003) was an independent predictor of BVAS at baseline. Conclusions Among Alb, Palb, and IMA, we found that Alb could be a useful marker indicating disease activity in patients with AAV."
https://openalex.org/W4284973574,"This study investigated health problems, turnover intention, and actual turnover among shift work nurses. While turnover intention is often used as a proxy variable for turnover, the relationship between these variables requires clarification. This study tested for relevant associations using prospective longitudinal data with a time lag of 12 months. We also tested for associations between health problems (sleep disturbance, fatigue, and depression) and turnover intentions/turnover, with a focus on the mediating role of turnover intention.This study conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Shift Work Nurses' Health and Turnover project, which is a prospective longitudinal cohort study. We analyzed health problems, turnover intention, and actual turnover. The data were analyzed via descriptive statistics, the Pearson's chi-squared test, independent t-test, univariable logistic regression, multiple logistic regression, and causal mediation.Participants included 491 shift work female nurses. Of these, 112 (22.8%) had turnover intention, while 38 (7.7%) left their jobs within the 12-month period of investigation. Of the 112 with turnover intention, 22 left their jobs (OR 5.68. 95% CI 2.84-11.36). The logistic regression analysis showed that sleep disturbance and fatigue were associated with turnover intentions and actual turnover, while depression was only associated with turnover intention. The causal mediation analysis showed that turnover intention mediated the relationship between health problems (sleep disturbance and fatigue) and actual turnover (sleep disturbance OR 1.31, 95%CI = 1.02-1.60; fatigue OR 2.11, 95%CI = 1.50-2.68); sleep disturbance had a natural direct effect on actual turnover (OR 2.66, 95%CI,2.07-3.21).Turnover intention strongly predicted actual turnover. Sleep disturbances may result in turnover, even in cases without existing turnover intention. These findings highlight the need for early interventions aimed at preventing and alleviating sleep disturbances for shift work female nurses."
https://openalex.org/W4284665921,"Accumulating evidence identifies non-genetic mechanisms substantially contributing to drug resistance in cancer patients. Preclinical and clinical data implicate the transcriptional co-activators YAP1 and its paralog TAZ in resistance to multiple targeted therapies, highlighting the strong need for therapeutic strategies overcoming YAP1/TAZ-mediated resistance across tumor entities. Here, we show particularly high YAP1/TAZ activity in MITFlow/AXLhigh melanomas characterized by resistance to MAPK pathway inhibition and broad receptor tyrosine kinase activity. To uncover genetic dependencies of melanoma cells with high YAP1/TAZ activity, we used a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 functional screen and identified SLC35B2, the 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate transporter of the Golgi apparatus, as an essential gene for YAP1/TAZ-driven drug resistance. SLC35B2 expression correlates with tumor progression, and its loss decreases heparan sulfate expression, reduces receptor tyrosine kinase activity, and sensitizes resistant melanoma cells to BRAF inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Thus, targeting heparan sulfation via SLC35B2 represents a novel approach for breaking receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W4284977242,"Anemia remains a pervasive public health problem among preschool-age children in Ghana. Recent analyses have found that anemia in Ghanaian children, particularly in Southern regions, is largely attributable to infectious causes, rather than nutritional factors. Infections with enteropathogens can reduce iron absorption and increase systemic inflammation, but few studies have examined direct links between enteropathogens and anemia. This study investigated associations between detection of individual bacterial enteropathogens and systemic inflammation, iron deficiency, and anemia among 6- to 59-month-old children in Greater Accra, Ghana. Serum samples were analyzed from a cross-sectional sample of 262 children for concentrations of hemoglobin (Hb), biomarkers of systemic inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP) and α-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP)], and biomarkers of iron status [serum ferritin (SF) and serum transferrin receptor (sTfR)]. Stool samples were analyzed for ten bacterial enteropathogens using qPCR. We estimated associations between presence of each enteropathogen and elevated systemic inflammation (CRP > 5 mg/L and AGP > 1 g/L), iron deficiency (SF < 12 μg/L and sTfR > 8.3 mg/L) and anemia (Hb < 110 g/L). Enteropathogens were detected in 87% of children's stool despite a low prevalence of diarrhea (6.5%). Almost half (46%) of children had anemia while one-quarter (24%) had iron deficiency (low SF). Despite finding no associations with illness symptoms, Campylobacter jejuni/coli detection was strongly associated with elevated CRP [Odds Ratio (95% CI): 3.49 (1.45, 8.41)] and elevated AGP [4.27 (1.85, 9.84)]. Of the pathogens examined, only enteroinvasive Escherichia coli/Shigella spp. (EIEC/Shigella) was associated with iron deficiency, and enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) [1.69 (1.01, 2.84)] and EIEC/Shigella [2.34 (1.15, 4.76)] were associated with anemia. These results suggest that certain enteroinvasive pathogenic bacteria may contribute to child anemia. Reducing exposure to enteropathogens through improved water, sanitation, and hygiene practices may help reduce the burden of anemia in young Ghanaian children."
https://openalex.org/W4283800074,"The Ras-GTPase activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) plays a critical role in the formation of classical and antiviral stress granules in stressed and virus-infected eukaryotic cells, respectively. While G3BP1 is known to be phosphorylated at serine residues which could affect stress granule assembly, whether G3BP1 is phosphorylated at tyrosine residues and how this posttranslational modification might affect its functions is less clear. Here, we show using immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting studies with 4G10 antibody that G3BP1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated when cells are stimulated with the synthetic double-stranded RNA analog polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid to mimic viral infection. We further demonstrate via co-immunoprecipitation and inhibitor studies that Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) binds and phosphorylates G3BP1. The nuclear transport factor 2-like domain of G3BP1 was previously shown to be critical for its self-association to form stress granules. Our mass spectrometry, mutational and biochemical cross-linking analyses indicate that the tyrosine-40 residue in this domain is phosphorylated by BTK and critical for G3BP1 oligomerization. Furthermore, as visualized via confocal microscopy, pretreatment of cells with the BTK inhibitor LFM-A13 or genetic deletion of the btk gene or mutation of G3BP1-Y40 residue to alanine or phenylalanine all significantly attenuated the formation of antiviral stress granule aggregates upon polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid treatment. Taken together, our data indicate that BTK phosphorylation of G3BP1 induces G3BP1 oligomerization and facilitates the condensation of ribonucleoprotein complexes into macromolecular aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W4284701129,"Macrophage activation plays a key role in liver disease progression. Soluble CD163 (sCD163) is a specific macrophage activation biomarker useful for clinical estimating damage severity and predicting outcome in different liver conditions. sCD163 performance as a non-invasive marker of liver damage was evaluated in plasma samples at time of biopsy in 120 patients with different hepatic conditions (56 HCV, 20 HCV/HIV, 10 HBV and 34 MAFLD). sCD163 values were compared with those of healthy donors and analyzed related to histological damage. sCD163 together with other clinical parameters were used to create a logistical regression model to predict significant fibrosis. Only patients with viral hepatitis showed higher sCD163 values compared to the control group (HCV p<0.0001; HCV/HIV p<0.0001; HBV p = 0.0003), but no significant differences regarding fibrosis stages were observed. The proposed model predicts fibrosis severity using the logarithm sCD163 concentration, platelet count and age, it demonstrated to be a good marker for the HCV monoinfected group (AUROC 0.834) and an excellent one for the HCV/HIV co-infected group (AUROC 0.997). Moreover, the model displayed a diagnostic performance similar to FIB-4 in HCV cases and FIB-4 and APRI in HCV/HIV coinfected cases, and it even managed to correctly classify some cases that had been misclassified. The proposed model is able to determine, in a non-invasive way, the liver fibrosis stage of HCV and HCV/HIV patients, so after validation, it could be used in a complementary way in the clinical practice whenever APRI and FIB-4 failed to determine damage severity in HCV and HCV/HIV cases."

https://openalex.org/W4284958995,"Presently, human papillomavirus (HPV)-based cervical cancer screening is commonly used and is replacing conventional cytology screening tests. The HPV genotyping assay is useful for triage in cervical cancer screening and the evaluation of HPV vaccination effects. In this study, we evaluated the clinical performance of two HPV genotyping assays, BD Onclarity HPV (Onclarity) and Seegene Anyplex II HPV28 (Anyplex) in the detection of relevant cervical lesions and for HPV genotyping concordance. Anyplex and Onclarity assays were performed on 920 consecutive liquid-based specimens. Anyplex, sensitivity, specificity, and genotyping concordance with Onclarity were optimal when restricted to ≥2+ (medium) viral loads. HPV genotyping agreement between the two assays ranged between 0.75 and 0.9 (excellent), except for HPV 33/58, which was 0.73 (good). With Onclarity as a reference, the relative sensitivity of Anyplex for the detection of ≥CIN 2 was 1.05 (95% CI: 0.99-1.1) and the relative specificity for detection of negative for intraepithelial lesion and malignancy (NILM) was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.85-0.93). For most ≥CIN 2 lesions, high-risk HPV was detected by Onclarity (66/72) and Anyplex (69/72) assays. For high-risk HPV negative ≥CIN 2 lesions, possible high-risk HPV genotypes were detected by Anyplex. In conclusion, the genotyping agreement between the tests was good to excellent. Full genotyping with Anyplex might confer additional benefits to patients with ≥CIN 2, although the difference is small. We also suggest an optimal cutoff value when reporting HPV infections using the Anyplex assay (≥2+; medium viral loads)."
https://openalex.org/W4284959551,"Women with metastatic breast cancer have a disheartening 5-year survival rate of only 28%. CREB3L1 (cAMP-responsive element binding protein 3 like 1) is a metastasis suppressor that functions as a transcription factor, and in an estrogen-dependent model of rat breast cancer, it repressed the expression of genes that promote breast cancer progression and metastasis. In this report, we set out to determine the expression level of CREB3L1 across different human breast cancer subtypes and determine whether CREB3L1 functions as a metastasis suppressor, particularly in triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs). CREB3L1 expression was generally increased in luminal A, luminal B and HER2 breast cancers, but significantly reduced in a high proportion (75%) of TNBCs. Two luminal A (HCC1428, T47D) and two basal TNBC (HCC1806, HCC70) CREB3L1-deficient breast cancer cell lines were characterized as compared to their corresponding HA-CREB3L1-expressing counterparts. HA-CREB3L1 expression significantly reduced both cell migration and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar but had no impact on cell proliferation rates as compared to the CREB3L1-deficient parental cell lines. Restoration of CREB3L1 expression in HCC1806 cells was also sufficient to reduce mammary fat pad tumor formation and lung metastases in mouse xenograft models of breast cancer as compared to the parental HCC1806 cells. These results strongly support a metastasis suppressor role for CREB3L1 in human luminal A and TNBCs. Further, the ability to identify the subset of luminal A (7%) and TNBCs (75%) that are CREB3L1-deficient provides opportunities to stratify patients that would benefit from additional treatments to treat their more metastatic disease."
https://openalex.org/W4284966248,"Foeniculum vulgare, F. vulgare, commonly known as fennel, is believed to be one of the world's oldest medicinal herbs and has been exploited by people for centuries as a nutritional aid for digestive disorders. In many southeast Asian countries, it is ingested as an after-meal snack, mukhvas, due to its breath-freshening and digestive aid properties. F. vulgare is used in some countries, such as Iran, as a complementary and alternative treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).This study investigated the effects of fennel seed extract on intestinal epithelium barrier function and the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) pathway. This pathway is active in inflammatory bowel disease. To study the protective effects of fennel seed extract in vitro, monolayers derived from the T84 colonic cell line were challenged with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and monitored with and without fennel seed extract. To complement our in vitro studies, the dextran sodium sulfate induced murine colitis model was employed to ascertain whether the protective effect of fennel seed extract can be recapitulated in vivo.Fennel seed extract was shown to exert a protective effect on transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in both T84 and murine models and showed increases in tight junction-associated mRNA in T84 cell monolayers. Both models demonstrated significant decreases in phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1), indicating reduced activation of the STAT pathway. Additionally, mice treated with fennel seed showed significantly lower ulcer indices than control mice.We conclude barrier function of the gastrointestinal tract is improved by fennel seed extract, suggesting the potential utility of this agent as an alternative or adjunctive therapy in IBD."
https://openalex.org/W4284970595,"During ovarian development, gonadal ridge epithelial-like (GREL) cells arise from the epithelial cells of the ventral surface of the mesonephros. They ultimately develop into follicular granulosa cells or into ovarian surface epithelial cells. Stromal fibroblasts arise from the mesonephros and penetrate the ovary. We developed methods for isolating and culturing fetal ovarian GREL cells and ovarian fibroblasts by expansion of colonies without passage. In culture, these two cell types were morphologically different. We examined the expression profile of 34 genes by qRT-PCR, of which 24 genes had previously been studied in whole fetal ovaries. Expression of nine of the 10 newly-examined genes in fetal ovaries correlated with gestational age ( MUC1 , PKP2 , CCNE1 and CCNE2 negatively; STAR , COL4A1 , GJA1 , LAMB2 and HSD17B1 positively). Comparison between GREL cells and fetal fibroblasts revealed higher expression of KRT19 , PKP2 , OCLN , MUC1 , ESR1 and LGR5 and lower expression of GJA1 , FOXL2 , NR2F2 , FBN1 , COL1A1 , NR5A1 , CCND2 , CCNE1 and ALDH1A1 . Expression of CCND2 , CCNE1 , CCNE2 , ESR2 and TGFBR1 was higher in the fetal fibroblasts than in adult fibroblasts; FBN1 was lower. Expression of OCLN , MUC1 , LAMB2 , NR5A1 , ESR1 , ESR2 , and TGFBR3 was lower in GREL cells than ovarian surface epithelial cells. Expression of KRT19 , DSG2 , PKP2 , OCLN , MUC1 , FBN1 , COL1A1 , COL3A1 , STAR and TGFBR2 was higher and GJA1 , CTNNB1 , LAMB2 , NR5A1 , CYP11A1 , HSD3B1 , CYP19A1 , HSD17B1 , FOXL2 , ESR1 , ESR2 , TGFBR3 and CCND2 was lower in GREL cells compared to granulosa cells. TGFβ1 altered the expression of COL1A1 , COL3A1 and FBN1 in fetal fibroblasts and epidermal growth factor altered the expression of FBN1 and COL1A1 . In summary, the two major somatic cell types of the developing ovary have distinct gene expression profiles. They, especially GREL cells, also differ from the cells they ultimately differentiate in to. The regulation of cell fate determination, particularly of the bi-potential GREL cells, remains to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W4283803647,"FtsQBL is a transmembrane protein complex in the divisome of Escherichia coli that plays a critical role in regulating cell division. Although extensive efforts have been made to investigate the interactions between the three involved proteins, FtsQ, FtsB, and FtsL, the detailed interaction mechanism is still poorly understood. In this study, we used hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to investigate these full-length proteins and their complexes. We also dissected the structural dynamic changes and the related binding interfaces within the complexes. Our data revealed that FtsB and FtsL interact at both the periplasmic and transmembrane regions to form a stable complex. Furthermore, the periplasmic region of FtsB underwent significant conformational changes. With the help of computational modeling, our results suggest that FtsBL complexation may bring the respective constriction control domains (CCDs) in close proximity. We show that when FtsBL adopts a coiled-coil structure, the CCDs are fixed at a vertical position relative to the membrane surface; thus, this conformational change may be essential for FtsBL's interaction with other divisome proteins. In the FtsQBL complex, intriguingly, we show only FtsB interacts with FtsQ at its C-terminal region, which stiffens a large area of the β-domain of FtsQ. Consistent with this, we found the connection between the α- and β-domains in FtsQ is also strengthened in the complex. Overall, the present study provides important experimental evidence detailing the local interactions between the full-length FtsB, FtsL, and FtsQ protein, as well as valuable insights into the roles of FtsQBL complexation in regulating divisome activity."
https://openalex.org/W4284694766,"Introduction The spleen is a lymphoid organ and we hypothesize that clinical benefit to immunotherapy may present with an increase in splenic volume during treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether changes in splenic volume could be observed in those showing clinical benefit versus those not showing clinical benefit to pembrolizumab treatment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Materials and methods In this study, 70 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab; and who underwent baseline CT scan within 2 weeks before treatment and follow-up CT within 3 months after commencing immunotherapy were retrospectively evaluated. The splenic volume on each CT was segmented manually by outlining the splenic contour on every image and the total volume summated. We compared the splenic volume in those achieving a clinical benefit and those not achieving clinical benefit, using non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Clinical benefit was defined as stable disease or partial response lasting for greater than 24 weeks. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results There were 23 responders and 47 non-responders based on iRECIST criteria and 35 patients with clinical benefit and 35 without clinical benefit. There was no significant difference in the median pre-treatment volume (175 vs 187 cm 3 , p = 0.34), post-treatment volume (168 vs 167 cm 3 , p = 0.39) or change in splenic volume (-0.002 vs 0.0002 cm 3 , p = 0.97) between the two groups. No significant differences were also found between the splenic volume of patients with partial response, stable disease or progressive disease (p&gt;0.017). Moreover, there was no statistically significant difference between progression-free survival and time to disease progression when the splenic volume was categorized as smaller or larger than the median pre-treatment or post-treatment volume (p&gt;0.05). Conclusion No significant differences were observed in the splenic volume of those showing clinical benefit versus those without clinical benefit to pembrolizumab treatment in NSCLC patients. CT splenic volume cannot be used as a potentially simple biomarker of response to immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W4284701659,"The levels of indoor air microbial load in hospitals are very crucial to the health of patients and health care workers and are to be regularly monitored and maintained at an acceptable level. However, this problem remains overlooked, particularly in developing countries including Ethiopia. A hospital-based cross-sectional study is designed to determine the indoor air microbial load (settle plate technique), microbial isolates (standard microbiological techniques), bacterial susceptibility profiles (Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique), and associated factors, in different wards of the title Hospital, southern Ethiopia. An observational checklist was used to collect relevant information related to the associated factors; descriptive and inferential statistics were applied using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS); p-values ≤ 0.05 in the multivariable analysis were considered statistically significant. The total average bacterial and fungal load of the selected wards was 1914±1081.4 Colony Forming Units (CFU)/m3 (95% CI: 1718.5-2109.48 CFU/m3) and 1533.7±858.8 CFU/m3 (95% CI: 1378.5-1688CFU/m3) respectively. The highest mean bacterial (1914±1081.4 CFU/m3) and fungal (1533.7±858.8 CFU/m3) loads were found in the male surgical and female medical wards respectively. A total of 229 bacterial and 139 fungal isolates were obtained; Gram-positive bacteria were the predominant type, 130 (56.7%), particularly the isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 46 (20.1%). The predominant fungal isolates were Aspergillus sp., 53(38%). Percentages of multidrug-resistant (MDR), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), and carbapenemase producers respectively were 48.5, 26.5, and 25%. High room crowd index [p = 0.003; Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 12.5 (Confidence Interval (CI) 95%: 2.42-65)], presence of damp/wet materials [p = 0.025; AOR 7 (CI 95%: 1.3-37.4)], intense room traffic [p = 0.004; AOR 9.6 (CI 95%: 1.2-79.3)], inappropriate storage of food and drugs [p = 0.008; AOR 7.5 (CI 95%: 1.7-32)], and unclean environment [p = 0.03; AOR 5.8 (CI 95%: 1.2-28)] showed statistical significance concerning the indoor air microbial loads; most of the wards in Arba Minch General Hospital (AMGH) stand high and not in an acceptable level as per the WHO and the European Commission standards on indoor air microbial load. Periodic air surveillance and infection prevention control programs are required to reduce the transmission of these microbes to inpatients, visitors, and health care workers."
https://openalex.org/W4284702265,"In various team sports, such as handball, referees work on the court by continuously moving with the players. Therefore, their physical fitness also has an impact on their reaction time, which could affect their professional decisions. The cardiorespiratory fitness status of healthy Hungarian elite handball referees was examined via body composition analysis and vita maxima cardiopulmonary exercise testing with lactate measurements. One hundred referees were examined (age: 29.0 ± 7.9 years; male: 64.0%; training: 4.3 ± 2.0 hours/week; ratio of former elite handball players: 39.0%; 51.0% first and 49.0% second division referees of the Hungarian National Handball Leagues). A resting heart rate (HR) of 79.0 ± 12.6 BPM was measured. On the basis of the body composition analysis the fat-free mass index proved to be 19.9 ± 2.6 kg/m2. The referees achieved a maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max) of 44.6 ± 6.1 ml/kg/min, with a maximal HR of 187.2 ± 11.1 BPM (which was 98.1 ± 4.6% of their calculated maximal HR) and a peak lactate of 9.2 ± 3.2 mmol/l at 557.1 ± 168.3 sec on our continuous speed, increasing slope treadmill protocol. Second division referees were younger, on a weekly average they trained more, achieved higher treadmill exercise time (respectively, 463.8 ± 131.9 vs 658.4 ± 143.9 sec, p < 0.001) and anaerobic threshold time (respectively, 265.8 ± 100.9 vs 348.2 ± 117.1 sec, p < 0.001), while the two different divisional referees had similar V̇O2max values. Regarding our physical fitness measurements, huge individual differences were observed between the referees (exercise time range: 259.0-939.0 sec, V̇O2max range: 25.3-62.4 ml/kg/min). Since it can affect their performance as referees, individual training planning, regular physical fitness measurements, and strict selection methods are suggested."

Hybrid weakness in Capsicum , the cessation of plant growth, is caused by two complementary dominant genes, A from C . chinense or C . frutescens and B from C . annuum . In the present study, we surveyed whether 94 C . annuum accessions had B or b alleles by crossing with C . chinense having the A allele. Of the 94 C . annuum accessions, five had the B allele, three of which were native to Latin America and two were native to Asia. When combined with previous studies, the percentage of B carriers was 41% in Japan, 13% in Asia excluding Japan, 6% in Latin America, and 0% in Europe and Africa. In addition, 48 accessions of C . annuum from various countries were subjected to SSR analysis. Clades with high percentages of B -carriers were formed in the phylogenetic trees. In the principal coordinate analysis, most B -carriers were localized in a single group, although the group also included b -carriers. Based on these results, we presumed that the B allele was acquired in some C . annuum lines in Latin America, and B -carriers were introduced to the world during the Age of Discovery, as along with the b -carriers."
https://openalex.org/W4284967417,"This study explored changes in the microbial community structure during straw degradation by a microbial decomposer, M44. The microbial community succession at different degradation periods was analyzed using MiSeq high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that 14 days after inoculation, the filter paper enzyme and endoglucanase activities increased to 2.55 U·mL -1 and 2.34 U·mL -1 . The xylanase, laccase, and lignin peroxidase activities rose to 9.86 U·mL -1 , 132.16 U·L -1 , and 85.43 U·L -1 after 28 d, which was consistent with changes in the straw degradation rate. The degradation rates of straw, lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose were 31.43%, 13.67%, 25.04%, and 21.69%, respectively, after 28 d of fermentation at 15°C. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes were the main bacterial species in samples at different degradation stages. The dominant genera included Pseudomonas , Delftia , and Paenibacillus during the initial stage (1 d, 7 d) and the mid-term stage (14 d). The key functional microbes during the late stage (21 d, 28 d) were Rhizobium , Chryseobacterium , Sphingobacterium , Brevundimonas , and Devosia . Changes in the bacterial consortium structure and straw degradation characteristics during different degradation periods were clarified to provide a theoretical basis for the rational utilization of microbial decomposer M44."
https://openalex.org/W4284975388,"Maternal mortality and adverse pregnancy outcomes are still challenges in developing countries. In Ethiopia, long distances and lack of transportation are the main geographic barriers for pregnant women to utilize a skilled birth attendant. To alleviate this problem, maternity waiting homes are a gateway for women to deliver at the health facilities, thereby helping towards the reduction of the alarming maternal mortality trend and negative pregnancy outcomes. However, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the utilization of maternity waiting homes in the study area. Therefore, this study aimed to assess utilization of maternity waiting home services and associated factors among mothers who gave birth in the last year in Dabat district, northwest Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January 5 to February 30, 2019. A total of 402 eligible women were selected using a simple random sampling technique. Data were collected using a structured, pre-tested, and interviewer-administered questionnaire through face-to-face interviews. Data were entered into EPI info version 7.1.2 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models were fitted. Statistically significant associations between variables were determined based on the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with its 95% confidence interval and p-value of ≤ 0.05.Maternity waiting home utilization by pregnant women was found to be 16.2% (95% CI: 13, 20). The mothers' age (26-30 years) (AOR = 0.24; 95% CI: 0.08,0.69), primary level of education (AOR = 9.05; 95% CI: 3.83, 21.43), accepted length of stay in maternity waiting homes (AOR = 3.15; 95% CI: 1.54, 6.43), adequate knowledge of pregnancy danger signs (AOR = 7.88; 95% CI: 3.72,16.69), jointly decision on the mother's health (AOR = 2.76; 95% CI: 1.08,7.05), and getting people for household activities (AOR = 2.59, 95% CI: 1.21, 5.52) had significant association with maternity waiting home utilization.In this study, maternity waiting home utilization was low. Thus, expanding a strategy to improve women's educational status, health education communication regarding danger signs of pregnancy, empowering women's decision-making power, and shortening the length of stay at maternity waiting homes may enhance maternity waiting home utilization."
https://openalex.org/W4283821516,"A major physiological role of hERG1 (human Ether-á-go-go-Related Gene 1) potassium channels is to repolarize cardiac action potentials. Two isoforms, hERG1a and hERG1b, associate to form the potassium current IKr in cardiomyocytes. Inherited mutations in hERG1a or hERG1b cause prolonged cardiac repolarization, long QT syndrome, and sudden death arrhythmia. hERG1a subunits assemble with and enhance the number of hERG1b subunits at the plasma membrane, but the mechanism for the increase in hERG1b by hERG1a is not well understood. Here, we report that the hERG1a N-terminal region expressed in trans with hERG1b markedly increased hERG1b currents and increased biotin-labeled hERG1b protein at the membrane surface. hERG1b channels with a deletion of the N-terminal 1b domain did not have a measurable increase in current or biotinylated protein when coexpressed with hERG1a N-terminal regions, indicating that the 1b domain was required for the increase in hERG1b. Using a biochemical pull-down interaction assay and a FRET hybridization experiment, we detected a direct interaction between the hERG1a N-terminal region and the hERG1b N-terminal region. Using engineered deletions and alanine mutagenesis, we identified a short span of amino acids at positions 216 to 220 within the hERG1a ""N-linker"" region that were necessary for the upregulation of hERG1b. We propose that direct structural interactions between the hERG1a N-linker region and the hERG1b 1b domain increase hERG1b at the plasma membrane. Mechanisms regulating hERG1a and hERG1b are likely critical for cardiac function, may be disrupted by long QT syndrome mutants, and serve as potential targets for therapeutics."

https://openalex.org/W4284669176,"The ratio of Na+ and K+ is an important determinant of the magnitude of Na+ toxicity and osmotic stress in plant cells. Traditional analytical approaches involve destructive tissue sampling and chemical analysis, where real-time observation of spatio-temporal experiments across genetic or breeding populations is unrealistic. Such an approach can also be very inaccurate and prone to erroneous biological interpretation. Analysis by Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) is an emerging non-destructive alternative for tracking plant nutrient status in a time-course with higher accuracy and reduced cost for chemical analysis. In this study, the feasibility and predictive power of HSI-based approach for spatio-temporal tracking of Na+ and K+ levels in tissue samples was explored using a panel recombinant inbred line (RIL) of rice (Oryza sativa L.; salt-sensitive IR29 x salt-tolerant Pokkali) with differential activities of the Na+ exclusion mechanism conferred by the SalTol QTL. In this panel of RILs the spectrum of salinity tolerance was represented by FL499 (super-sensitive), FL454 (sensitive), FL478 (tolerant), and FL510 (super-tolerant). Whole-plant image processing pipeline was optimized to generate HSI spectra during salinity stress at EC = 9 dS m-1. Spectral data was used to create models for Na+ and K+ prediction by partial least squares regression (PLSR). Three datasets, i.e., mean image pixel spectra, smoothened version of mean image pixel spectra, and wavelength bands, with wide differences in intensity between control and salinity facilitated the prediction models with high R2. The smoothened and filtered datasets showed significant improvements over the mean image pixel dataset. However, model prediction was not fully consistent with the empirical data. While the outcome of modeling-based prediction showed a great potential for improving the throughput capacity for salinity stress phenotyping, additional technical refinements including tissue-specific measurements is necessary to maximize the accuracy of prediction models."
https://openalex.org/W4284674138,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the quantitative diagnostic performance of computed tomography (CT) densitometry in pediatric patients with bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). We measured the mean lung density (MLD) and represented the difference of MLD in inspiratory and expiratory phases (MLDD), the ratio of the MLD (E/I MLD), and the relative volume percentage of lung density at 50-Hounsfield unit (HU) interval threshold (E600 to E950). We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of the lung density indices for the diagnosis of BO. A total of 81 patients, including 51 patients with BO and 30 controls, were included in this study. In the BO patients, expiratory (EXP) MLD and MLDD were significantly lower, and E/I MLD and expiratory low attenuation areas below the threshold of −850 HU to −950 HU (E850, E900, and E950) were statistically significantly higher than controls. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that MLDD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.98, p &lt; .001), E/I MLD (OR = 1.39, p &lt; .001), and E850 to E950 were significant densitometry parameters for BO diagnosis. In a receiver-operating characteristic analysis, E900 (cutoff, 1.4%; AUC = 0.920), E/I MLD (cutoff, 0.87; AUC = 0.887), and MLDD (cutoff, 109 HU; AUC = 0.867) showed high accuracy for the diagnosis of BO. In conclusion, the lung CT densitometry can serve as a quantitative marker providing additional indications of expiratory airflow limitation in pediatric patients with BO."
https://openalex.org/W4284677951,"Genome editing in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) offers a potential tool for studying gene functions in disease models and correcting genetic mutations for cell-based therapy. Precise transgene insertion in hiPSCs represents a significant challenge. In the past decade, viral transduction has been widely used due to its high transduction efficiency; however, it can result in random transgene integration and variable transgene copy numbers. Non-viral-based strategies are generally safer but limited by their low transfection efficiency in hiPSCs. Recently, genome engineering using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors has emerged as a promising gene delivery approach due to AAVs’ low immunogenicity, toxicity, and ability to infect a broad range of cells. The following protocol describes the workflow for genome editing in hiPSCs using the CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex combined with the recombinant AAV serotype 6 (AAV6) donor vectors to introduce a gene of interest (GOI) fused with mCherry fluorescent reporter gene into the AAVS1 safe harbor site. This approach leads to efficient transgene insertion and is applicable to precise genome editing of hiPSCs or other types of stem cells for research purposes."
https://openalex.org/W4284692054,"Zinc is an essential mineral known to be important for the normal physiological functions of the immune system. It is one of the basic nutrients required during pregnancy for the normal development and growth of the fetus. However, Zinc deficiency during pregnancy causes irreversible effects on the newborn such as growth impairment, spontaneous abortion, congenital malformations and poor birth outcomes. Even though, the effect of Zinc deficiency is devastating during pregnancy, there is scarcity of evidence on Zinc deficiency and related factors among pregnant women in the current study area.To assess Zinc deficiency and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in public health facilities of Konso Zone, Southern Ethiopia.Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted among randomly selected 424 pregnant mothers. Data were collected using pre tested questionnaire (for interview part), and 5 blood sample was drawn for serum zinc level determination. Data were entered to Epi-Data version 3.1 software and exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Binary logistic regression analysis was computed and independent variables with a p-value ≤ 0.25 were included in multivariable analysis. Serum zinc level was determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy by applying clean and standard procedures in the laboratory. Finally adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence level, P-value < 0.05 was used to identify significant factors for Zinc deficiency.The prevalence of Zinc deficiency was found to be 128 (30.26%) with the mean serum zinc level of 0.56±0.12 g/dl.

https://openalex.org/W4284699400,"For bottom-up proteomic analysis, the goal of analytical pipelines that process the raw output of mass spectrometers is to detect, characterise, identify, and quantify peptides. The initial steps of detecting and characterising features in raw data must overcome some considerable challenges. The data presents as a sparse array, sometimes containing billions of intensity readings over time. These points represent both signal and chemical or electrical noise. Depending on the biological sample's complexity, tens to hundreds of thousands of peptides may be present in this vast data landscape. For ion mobility-based LC-MS analysis, each peptide is comprised of a grouping of hundreds of single intensity readings in three dimensions: mass-over-charge (m/z), mobility, and retention time. There is no inherent information about any associations between individual points; whether they represent a peptide or noise must be inferred from their structure. Peptides each have multiple isotopes, different charge states, and a dynamic range of intensity of over six orders of magnitude. Due to the high complexity of most biological samples, peptides often overlap in time and mobility, making it very difficult to tease apart isotopic peaks, to apportion the intensity of each and the contribution of each isotope to the determination of the peptide's monoisotopic mass, which is critical for the peptide's identification. Here we describe four algorithms for the Bruker timsTOF Pro that each play an important role in finding peptide features and determining their characteristics. These algorithms focus on separate characteristics that determine how candidate features are detected in the raw data. The first two algorithms deal with the complexity of the raw data, rapidly clustering raw data into spectra that allows isotopic peaks to be resolved. The third algorithm compensates for saturation of the instrument's detector thereby recovering lost dynamic range, and lastly, the fourth algorithm increases confidence of peptide identifications by simplification of the fragment spectra. These algorithms are effective in processing raw data to detect features and extracting the attributes required for peptide identification, and make an important contribution to an analytical pipeline by detecting features that are higher quality and better segmented from other peptides in close proximity. The software has been developed in Python using Numpy and Pandas and made freely available with an open-source MIT license to facilitate experimentation and further improvement (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.6513126).

https://openalex.org/W4284973695,"Decreased sea ice cover in the northern Bering Sea has altered annual phytoplankton phenology owing to an expansion of open water duration and its impact on ocean stratification. Limitations of satellite remote sensing such as the inability to detect bloom activity throughout the water column, under ice, and in cloudy conditions dictate the need for shipboard based measurements to provide more information on bloom dynamics. In this study, we adapted remote sensing land cover classification techniques to provide a new means to determine bloom stage from shipboard samples. Specifically, we used multiyear satellite time series of chlorophyll a to determine whether in-situ blooms were actively growing or mature (i.e., past-peak) at the time of field sampling. Field observations of chlorophyll a and pheophytin (degraded and oxidized chlorophyll products) were used to calculate pheophytin proportions, i.e., (Pheophytin/(Chlorophyll a + Pheophytin)) and empirically determine whether the bloom was growing or mature based on remotely sensed bloom stages. Data collected at 13 north Bering Sea stations each July from 2013–2019 supported a pheophytin proportion of 28% as the best empirical threshold to distinguish a growing vs. mature bloom stage. One outcome was that low vs. high sea ice years resulted in significantly different pheophytin proportions in July; in years with low winter-to-spring ice, more blooms with growing status were observed, compared to later stage, more mature blooms following springs with abundant seasonal sea ice. The detection of growing blooms in July following low ice years suggests that changes in the timing of the spring bloom triggers cascading effects on mid-summer production."
https://openalex.org/W4284976422,"IGF-1 is considered an important regulator of muscle protein synthesis. However, its role in stimulation of muscle protein synthesis by amino acids (AA) is not clear, despite pronounced alterations in IGF-1 mRNA expression and signaling in muscle tissues by feeding. This study evaluates the role of locally produced IGF-1 and IGF-1 signaling when skeletal muscle protein synthesis is activated by increased amino acid availability in confluent, non-proliferating cells.L6 skeletal muscle cells were subjected to amino acid starvation (24 h, 0.14 mM) followed by 18 h amino acid refeeding in Low AA (0.28 mM) or High AA concentrations (9 mM). Protein synthesis rates were estimated by L-[U-14C]-phenylalanine incorporation into cellular proteins. IGF-1 and IGF-1 receptor mRNA expression were quantified by real time PCR. SiRNA knockdown, antibodies and chemical inhibitors were used to attenuate muscle IGF-1 production and signaling.High AA concentrations (9mM) increased IGF-1 mRNA expression (+ 30%, p<0.05) and increased L-[U-14C]-phenylalanine incorporation compared to Low AA in confluent, non-proliferating muscle cells. Blocking IGF-1 signaling by chemical inhibitors reduced IGF-1 mRNA upregulation (~50%, p< 0.01), without decrease of protein synthesis. SiRNA knockdown of IGF-1 reduced protein synthesis, mainly explained by reduced cell proliferation. High AA or IGF-1 inhibitors did not change IGF-1 receptor mRNA expressions.Amino acids increased IGF-1 mRNA expression and stimulated muscle protein synthesis. However, simultaneous upregulation of IGF-1 mRNA did not relate to increased protein synthesis by amino acids. The results indicate that increased IGF-1 mRNA expression is rather a covariate to amino acid initiation of protein synthesis in non-proliferating muscle cells; effects that may be related to unrecognized metabolic activities, such as transport of amino acids."

Herein, we evaluate the effectiveness and outcome predictors of fluoroscopic transforaminal ESI for recurrent HIVD.Seventy-seven patients (48 male; mean age, 51.3 years) with recurrent lumbar HIVD were included and divided into three groups according to initial treatment: conservative treatment, transforaminal ESI, and immediate surgery. ESI effectiveness was evaluated by operation rates, injection numbers in 6 months, and pain reduction (visual analog scale (VAS) scores). Clinical and MRI variables were analyzed as possible outcome predictors. Each subject in the transforaminal ESI group was individually matched to two patients with initial HIVD (control group).In the transforaminal ESI group (n = 37), 20 patients (54.1%) did not undergo reoperation. The initial and follow-up VAS scores were significantly higher in the reoperation group (p = 0.014, p = 0.019, respectively). Patients with either paresthesia or motor weakness (12/19, 63.2%) had a significantly higher reoperation rate than patients with only pain (5/18, 27.8%; p = 0.031). Extruded disc ratios ≥2.0 were significantly higher in the reoperation group (10/17, 58.8%; p = 0.048).

Approximately 54% of patients did not undergo reoperation. An extruded disc ratio ≥2.0 and paresthesia or motor weakness were poor outcome predictors."

https://openalex.org/W4284959867,"Incontinence is global health and social issue, with urinary incontinence alone affecting over 400 million people. Incontinence can lead to physical harms such as skin damage, but it also commonly causes social and psychological harms, including those associated with stigma. For many people, treatment to cure incontinence does not work or is not suitable and they live with the long-term consequences of incontinence. At the moment, no stigma reduction interventions (increasingly used with other conditions such as mental health problems and HIV) have been developed for people living with incontinence. As a starting point for developing such an intervention, this review will address the questions 1) What are the incontinence (urinary or faecal) associated experiences of stigma of people living with incontinence? 2) What is the impact of incontinence associated stigma on their lives?The reviewers will search Embase, Medline, PsychINFO and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature using controlled vocabulary and relevant search terms. Articles assessed to meet inclusion criteria will be included. Once duplicates have been removed, titles and abstracts will be screened and full texts of selected research articles will be reviewed. An adapted Joanna Briggs Institute Data Extraction Form will be used to collect the data and quality will be assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for qualitative research appraisal tool. A framework approach (using the Revised Framework for Understanding Non-communicable Disease Related Stigma) will be used to organise, integrate, interpret and summarise findings from included articles. The review will be reported in accordance with the Enhancing Transparency in reporting the synthesis of qualitative research statement. Prospero registration number CRD42021259065.The systematic review described in this protocol will provide the first in-depth, comprehensive understanding of people's experiences of the stigma associated with incontinence and the impact that it has on their lives. It will identify broader influences of contextual variables such as age, sex, cause and type of incontinence, socio-economic culture and geographical location. The review aims to provide insights to support the development of incontinence associated stigma reduction interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4284961658,"Palliative sedation is used to relieve refractory symptoms and is part of clinical practice in Sweden. Yet we do not know how frequently this practice occurs, how decision-making takes place, or even which medications are preferentially used.To understand the current practice of palliative sedation in Sweden.We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional medical record-based study. For 690 consecutive deceased patients from 11 of 12 specialized palliative care units in the southernmost region of Sweden who underwent palliative sedation during 2016, we collected data on whether the patient died during sedation and, for sedated patients, the decision-making process, medication used, and depth of sedation.Eight percent of patients were sedated. Almost all (94%) were given midazolam, sometimes in combination with propofol. The proportions of sedation were similar in the patient groups with and without cancer. The largest proportion of the sedated patients died in inpatient care, but 23% died at home, with specialized palliative home care. Among the patients with a decision to sedate, 42% died deeply unconscious, while for those without such a decision the corresponding figure was 16%. In only one case was there more than one physician involved in the decision to use palliative sedation.8% of patients in specialized palliative care received palliative sedation, which is lower than international measures but much increased compared to an earlier Swedish assessment. The level of consciousness achieved often did not correspond to the planned level; this, together with indications of a scattered decision process, shows a need for clear guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W4284961780,"For the sizeable subset of adolescents and young adults whose cancer is incurable, developmentally appropriate end-of-life discussions are critical. Standards of care for adolescent and young adult end-of-life communication have been established, however, many health-professionals do not feel confident leading these conversations, leaving gaps in the implementation of best-practice end-of-life communication. We present a protocol for a Delphi study informing the development and implementation of clinician training to strengthen health-professionals' capacity in end-of-life conversations. Our approach will inform training to address barriers to end-of-life communication with adolescents and young adults across Westernized Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Global Accord countries. The Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Global Accord team involves 26 investigators from Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Twenty-four consumers, including adolescents and young adults with cancer history and carers, informed study design. We describe methodology for a modified Delphi questionnaire. The questionnaire aims to determine optimal timing for end-of-life communication with adolescents and young adults, practice-related content needed in clinician training for end-of-life communication with adolescents and young adults, and desireability of evidence-based training models. Round 1 involves an expert panel of investigators identifying appropriate questionnaire items. Rounds 2 and 3 involve questionnaires of international multidisciplinary health-professionals, followed by further input by adolescents and young adults. A second stage of research will design health-professional training to support best-practice end-of-life communication. The outcomes of this iterative and participatory research will directly inform the implementation of best-practice end-of-life communication across Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Global Accord countries. Barriers and training preferences identified will directly contribute to developing clinician-training resources. Our results will provide a framework to support further investigating end-of-life communication with adolescents and young adults across diverse countries. Our experiences also highlight effective methodology in undertaking highly collaborative global research."
https://openalex.org/W4284963509,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) burden on patients and healthcare systems warrants innovative strategies for screening asymptomatic individuals.We sought to externally validate a predictive model originally developed in a German population to detect unidentified incident AF utilising real-world primary healthcare databases from countries in Europe and Australia.This retrospective cohort study used anonymized, longitudinal patient data from 5 country-level primary care databases, including Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, and the UK. The study eligibility included adult patients (≥45 years) with either an AF diagnosis (cases) or no diagnosis (controls) who had continuous enrolment in the respective database prior to the study period. Logistic regression was fitted to a binary response (yes/no) for AF diagnosis using pre-determined risk factors.AF patients were from Germany (n = 63,562), the UK (n = 42,652), France (n = 7,213), Australia (n = 2,753), and Belgium (n = 1,371). Cases were more likely to have hypertension or other cardiac conditions than controls in all validation datasets compared to the model development data. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in the validation datasets ranged from 0.79 (Belgium) to 0.84 (Germany), comparable to the German study model, which had an area under the curve of 0.83. Most validation sets reported similar specificity at approximately 80% sensitivity, ranging from 67% (France) to 71% (United Kingdom). The positive predictive value (PPV) ranged from 2% (Belgium) to 16% (Germany), and the number needed to be screened was 50 in Belgium and 6 in Germany. The prevalence of AF varied widely between these datasets, which may be related to different coding practices. Low prevalence affected PPV, but not sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curves.AF risk prediction algorithms offer targeted ways to identify patients using electronic health records, which could improve screening number and the cost-effectiveness of AF screening if implemented in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W4284968988,"Three force measurement techniques in a shock tunnel, the free-flight, movable-support force balance, and stress-wave force balance techniques were employed, and each technique’s characteristics were assessed. For each force measurement technique, the system setup, data processing method, measurement uncertainties, and applied range of the test model size-flow establishment time were described in detail and compared. For a comparison and discussion, the drag coefficients of a circular pointed cone model with a semi-angle of 18.4° at a nominal freestream Mach number of 6 were measured. As a result, three force measurement techniques yield similar drag coefficients. However, the measurement uncertainties were increased in the order of the free-flight, the stress-wave force balance, and the movable-support force balance techniques. The main causes of the measurement uncertainties were the corner detection uncertainties for the free-flight techniques, and the propagation of the internal or external vibrations for the movable-support and stress-wave force balance techniques. To estimate the appropriate range of the test model size and flow establishment time for each technique’s application, the force measurement systems of the present work and the available literature were compared. As a result of comparative discussion, force measurement environments that can be advantageous for each technique are suggested."
