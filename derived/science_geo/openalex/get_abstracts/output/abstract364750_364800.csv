https://openalex.org/W2157393167,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp) detoxifies cells by exporting hundreds of chemically unrelated toxins but has been implicated in multidrug resistance (MDR) in the treatment of cancers. Substrate promiscuity is a hallmark of P-gp activity, thus a structural description of poly-specific drug-binding is important for the rational design of anticancer drugs and MDR inhibitors. The x-ray structure of apo P-gp at 3.8 angstroms reveals an internal cavity of ∼6000 angstroms cubed with a 30 angstrom separation of the two nucleotide-binding domains. Two additional P-gp structures with cyclic peptide inhibitors demonstrate distinct drug-binding sites in the internal cavity capable of stereoselectivity that is based on hydrophobic and aromatic interactions. Apo and drug-bound P-gp structures have portals open to the cytoplasm and the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer for drug entry. The inward-facing conformation represents an initial stage of the transport cycle that is competent for drug binding."

With use of an infectious, fluorescent clone of HIV, we tracked the movement of Gag in live CD4 T cells and captured the direct translocation of HIV across the virological synapse. Quantitative, high-speed three-dimensional (3D) video microscopy revealed the rapid formation of micrometer-sized ""buttons"" containing oligomerized viral Gag protein. Electron microscopy showed that these buttons were packed with budding viral crescents. Viral transfer events were observed to form virus-laden internal compartments within target cells. Continuous time-lapse monitoring showed preferential infection through synapses. Thus, HIV dissemination may be enhanced by virological synapse-mediated cell adhesion coupled to viral endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2106927126,"Systems biology approaches are extensively used to model and reverse engineer gene regulatory networks from experimental data. Conversely, synthetic biology allows ""de novo"" construction of a regulatory network to seed new functions in the cell. At present, the usefulness and predictive ability of modeling and reverse engineering cannot be assessed and compared rigorously. We built in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae a synthetic network, IRMA, for in vivo ""benchmarking"" of reverse-engineering and modeling approaches. The network is composed of five genes regulating each other through a variety of regulatory interactions; it is negligibly affected by endogenous genes, and it is responsive to small molecules. We measured time series and steady-state expression data after multiple perturbations. These data were used to assess state-of-the-art modeling and reverse-engineering techniques. A semiquantitative model was able to capture and predict the behavior of the network. Reverse engineering based on differential equations and Bayesian networks correctly inferred regulatory interactions from the experimental data."
https://openalex.org/W1967240215,"In the generalized epidemics of HIV in southern Sub-Saharan Africa, men who have sex with men have been largely excluded from HIV surveillance and research. Epidemiologic data for MSM in southern Africa are among the sparsest globally, and HIV risk among these men has yet to be characterized in the majority of countries.A cross-sectional anonymous probe of 537 men recruited with non-probability sampling among men who reported ever having had sex with another man in Malawi, Namibia, and Botswana using a structured survey instrument and HIV screening with the OraQuick(c) rapid test kit.The HIV prevalence among those between the ages of 18 and 23 was 8.3% (20/241); 20.0% (42/210) among those 24-29; and 35.7% (30/84) among those older than 30 for an overall prevalence of 17.4% (95% CI 14.4-20.8). In multivariate logistic regressions, being older than 25 (aOR 4.0, 95% CI 2.0-8.0), and not always wearing condoms during sex (aOR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3-4.9) were significantly associated with being HIV-positive. Sexual concurrency was common with 16.6% having ongoing concurrent stable relationships with a man and a woman and 53.7% had both male and female sexual partners in proceeding 6 months. Unprotected anal intercourse was common and the use of petroleum-based lubricants was also common when using condoms. Human rights abuses, including blackmail and denial of housing and health care was prevalent with 42.1% (222/527) reporting at least one abuse.MSM are a high-risk group for HIV infection and human rights abuses in Malawi, Namibia, and Botswana. Concurrency of sexual partnerships with partners of both genders may play important roles in HIV spread in these populations. Further epidemiologic and evaluative research is needed to assess the contribution of MSM to southern Africa's HIV epidemics and how best to mitigate this. These countries should initiate and adequately fund evidence-based and targeted HIV prevention programs for MSM."
https://openalex.org/W1979907792,"Human spliceosomal U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs), which consist of U1 small nuclear RNA and ten proteins, recognize the 5′ splice site within precursor messenger RNAs and initiate the assembly of the spliceosome for intron excision. An electron density map of the functional core of U1 snRNP at 5.5 Å resolution has enabled us to build the RNA and, in conjunction with site-specific labelling of individual proteins, to place the seven Sm proteins, U1-C and U1-70K into the map. Here we present the detailed structure of a spliceosomal snRNP, revealing a hierarchical network of intricate interactions between subunits. A striking feature is the amino (N)-terminal polypeptide of U1-70K, which extends over a distance of 180 Å from its RNA binding domain, wraps around the core domain consisting of the seven Sm proteins and finally contacts U1-C, which is crucial for 5′-splice-site recognition. The structure of U1 snRNP provides insights into U1 snRNP assembly and suggests a possible mechanism of 5′-splice-site recognition. In eukaryotes, many genes contain one or more introns — sequences that are transcribed as part of the mRNA, but which are removed before the mRNA is translated into protein. The macromolecular machine that clips these introns at appropriate places in the precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) is called the spliceosome. It consists of several RNA–protein complexes called snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles or 'snurps'), as well as other non-snRNP proteins. The structure of the U1 snRNP, which assembles at the 5′ end of the intron and is the first snurp bound to a pre-mRNA, has now been determined to 5.5 Å resolution. The subunit interactions that emerge from the structure reveal how the start of the intron is recognized by U1 snRNP, thereby initiating its removal by the spliceosome. In eukaryotes, many genes contain one or more introns — sequences that are transcribed into mRNA, but which are then excised before the mRNA is translated into protein. Multiprotein–RNA complexes called snRNPs are the machinery that clips these introns out. This study presents the structure of the U1 snRNP, which assembles at the 5′ end of the intron; the subunit interactions suggest a model by which the snRNP is assembled and the 5′ splice site is recognized."

https://openalex.org/W1999412329,"To generate efficient vaccines and cures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis , we need a far better understanding of its modes of infection, persistence, and spreading. Host cell entry and the establishment of a replication niche are well understood, but little is known about how tubercular mycobacteria exit host cells and disseminate the infection. Using the social amoeba Dictyostelium as a genetically tractable host for pathogenic mycobacteria, we discovered that M. tuberculosis and M. marinum , but not M. avium , are ejected from the cell through an actin-based structure, the ejectosome. This conserved nonlytic spreading mechanism requires a cytoskeleton regulator from the host and an intact mycobacterial ESX-1 secretion system. This insight offers new directions for research into the spreading of tubercular mycobacteria infections in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2129716919,"The Krebs cycle plays a fundamental role in cardiac energy production and is often implicated in the energetic imbalance characteristic of heart disease. In this study, we measured Krebs cycle flux in real time in perfused rat hearts using hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). [2-(13)C]Pyruvate was hyperpolarized and infused into isolated perfused hearts in both healthy and postischemic metabolic states. We followed the enzymatic conversion of pyruvate to lactate, acetylcarnitine, citrate, and glutamate with 1 s temporal resolution. The appearance of (13)C-labeled glutamate was delayed compared with that of other metabolites, indicating that Krebs cycle flux can be measured directly. The production of (13)C-labeled citrate and glutamate was decreased postischemia, as opposed to lactate, which was significantly elevated. These results showed that the control and fluxes of the Krebs cycle in heart disease can be studied using hyperpolarized [2-(13)C]pyruvate."

https://openalex.org/W1997661237,"The sensitivity limitations for magnetic resonance imaging of organic molecules have recently been addressed by hyperpolarization methods, which prepare excess nuclear spin polarization. This approach can increase sensitivity by orders of magnitude, but the enhanced signal relaxes away in tens of seconds, even in favorable cases. Here we show theoretically that singlet states between strongly coupled spins in molecules can be used to store and retrieve population in very-long-lived disconnected eigenstates, as long as the coupling between the spins substantially exceeds both the couplings to other spins and the resonance frequency difference between them. Experimentally, 2,3-carbon-13–labeled diacetyl has a disconnected eigenstate that can store population for minutes and is read out by hydration to make the two spins inequivalent."
https://openalex.org/W2138293866,"In the early stages of viral infection, outcomes depend on a race between expansion of infection and the immune response generated to contain it. We combined in situ tetramer staining with in situ hybridization to visualize, map, and quantify relationships between immune effector cells and their targets in tissues. In simian immunodeficiency virus infections in macaques and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections in mice, the magnitude and timing of the establishment of an excess of effector cells versus targets were found to correlate with the extent of control and the infection outcome (i.e., control and clearance versus partial or poor control and persistent infection). This method highlights the importance of the location, timing, and magnitude of the immune response needed for a vaccine to be effective against agents of persistent infection, such as HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W1975767327,"Similarities in the behavior of diverse animal species that form large groups have motivated attempts to establish general principles governing animal group behavior. It has been difficult, however, to make quantitative measurements of the temporal and spatial behavior of extensive animal groups in the wild, such as bird flocks, fish shoals, and locust swarms. By quantifying the formation processes of vast oceanic fish shoals during spawning, we show that (i) a rapid transition from disordered to highly synchronized behavior occurs as population density reaches a critical value; (ii) organized group migration occurs after this transition; and (iii) small sets of leaders significantly influence the actions of much larger groups. Each of these findings confirms general theoretical predictions believed to apply in nature irrespective of animal species."
https://openalex.org/W1991493368,"Mutations in the gene encoding Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) are one of the causes of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS). Fibrillar inclusions containing SOD1 and SOD1 inclusions that bind the amyloid-specific dye thioflavin S have been found in neurons of transgenic mice expressing mutant SOD1. Therefore, the formation of amyloid fibrils from human SOD1 was investigated. When agitated at acidic pH in the presence of low concentrations of guanidine or acetonitrile, metalated SOD1 formed fibrillar material which bound both thioflavin T and Congo red and had circular dichroism and infrared spectra characteristic of amyloid. While metalated SOD1 did not form amyloid-like aggregates at neutral pH, either removing metals from SOD1 with its intramolecular disulfide bond intact or reducing the intramolecular disulfide bond of metalated SOD1 was sufficient to promote formation of these aggregates. SOD1 formed amyloid-like aggregates both with and without intermolecular disulfide bonds, depending on the incubation conditions, and a mutant SOD1 lacking free sulfhydryl groups (AS-SOD1) formed amyloid-like aggregates at neutral pH under reducing conditions. ALS mutations enhanced the ability of disulfide-reduced SOD1 to form amyloid-like aggregates, and apo-AS-SOD1 formed amyloid-like aggregates at pH 7 only when an ALS mutation was also present. These results indicate that some mutations related to ALS promote formation of amyloid-like aggregates by facilitating the loss of metals and/or by making the intramolecular disulfide bond more susceptible to reduction, thus allowing the conversion of SOD1 to a form that aggregates to form resembling amyloid. Furthermore, the occurrence of amyloid-like aggregates per se does not depend on forming intermolecular disulfide bonds, and multiple forms of such aggregates can be produced from SOD1."
https://openalex.org/W2119379108,"Here we show that ouabain-induced cell growth regulation is intrinsically coupled to changes in the cellular amount of Na/K-ATPase via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Ouabain increases the endocytosis and degradation of Na/K-ATPase in LLC-PK1, human breast (BT20), and prostate (DU145) cancer cells. However, ouabain stimulates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and consequently up-regulates the expression of Na/K-ATPase in LLC-PK1 but not BT20 and DU145 cells. This up-regulation is sufficient to replete the plasma membrane pool of Na/K-ATPase and to stimulate cell proliferation in LLC-PK1 cells. On the other hand, ouabain causes a gradual depletion of Na/K-ATPase and an increased expression of cell cycle inhibitor p21cip, which consequently inhibits cell proliferation in BT20 and DU145 cells. Consistently, we observe that small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Na/K-ATPase is sufficient to induce the expression of p21cip and slow the proliferation of LLC-PK1 cells. Moreover, this knockdown converts the growth stimulatory effect of ouabain to growth inhibition in LLC-PK1 cells. Mechanistically, both Src and caveolin-1 are required for ouabain-induced activation of Akt and up-regulation of Na/K-ATPase. Furthermore, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway by rapamycin completely blocks ouabain-induced expression of Na/K-ATPase and converts ouabain-induced growth stimulation to growth inhibition in LLC-PK1 cells. Taken together, we conclude that changes in the expression of Na/K-ATPase dictate the growth regulatory effects of ouabain on cells.

Taken together, we conclude that changes in the expression of Na/K-ATPase dictate the growth regulatory effects of ouabain on cells. The Na/K-ATPase, a member of P-type ATPase family, was discovered as an energy transducing ion pump. It transports Na+ and K+ across the cell membrane and maintains ion homeostasis in animal cells (1Skou J.C. Physiol. Rev. 1965; 45: 596-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar, 2Lingrel J.B. Orlowski J. Shull M.M. Price E.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 38: 37-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that the Na/K-ATPase is also an important receptor that can transduce ligand binding into the activation of protein kinase cascades (3Li Z. Xie Z. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2009; 457: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Specifically, the Na/K-ATPase interacts with Src, which provides at least two important cellular regulations (4Liang M. Cai T.

Xie Z.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). First, association with Na/K-ATPase keeps Src in an inactive state. Thus, the Na/K-ATPase serves as a native negative Src regulator (4Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Qu W. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19709-19719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Second, this interaction forms a functional receptor complex for cardiotonic steroids (CTS) 3The abbreviations used are: CTS, cardiotonic steroid(s); IGF, insulin-like growth factor; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase.

Res. 1996; 31: 296-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Binding of CTS to the receptor complex activates the Na/K-ATPase-associated Src. Subsequently, the activated Src transactivates other tyrosine kinases, and together they recruit and further phosphorylate multiple membrane and soluble proteins, which results in the activation of protein kinase cascades and the generation of second messengers (3Li Z. Xie Z. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2009; 457: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 4Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Qu W. Xie Z.J. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Of particular significance are studies that indicate the beneficial effects of CTS therapy in women with breast cancer (25Stenkvist B. Bengtsson E. Eklund G. Eriksson O. Holmquist J. Nordin B.

Consistently, recent in vitro and in vivo studies have identified several new CTS compounds that exhibit anti-cancer activities (30Newman R.A. Yang P. Pawlus A.D. Block K.I. Mol.

Oleandrin, for example, is in clinical trials in the United States as an anti-cancer remedy for human cancers (31Ye M. Qu G. Guo H. Guo D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Ther. Oncol. 2006; 5: 167-181PubMed Google Scholar). Although ouabain inhibits the pumping function of the Na/K-ATPase, it is important to note that the growth inhibitory effect of ouabain can occur at doses that neither cause significant changes in intracellular Na+ and K+ nor affect cell viability. Rather, much like its effect on cell growth stimulation, ouabain induces cell growth inhibition through the activation of protein kinases and the generation of second messengers (19Chueh S.C. Guh J.H. Chen J. Lai M.K. Teng C.M. J. Urol. 2001; 166: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20Huang Y.T. Chueh S.C. Teng C.M. Guh J.H. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For example, a recent report showed that these nontoxic concentrations of ouabain stimulated Src, resulting in activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor/ERK pathway and induction of the expression of cell cycle inhibitor p21cip and cell growth arrest (34Kometiani P. Liu L. Askari A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Thus, it becomes important to understand the molecular mechanisms that govern different fates of cells in response to CTS stimulation. Prior studies have demonstrated that CTS induce endocytosis of the Na/K-ATPase and regulate its cellular expression via receptor-mediated signal transduction (35Liu J. Kesiry R. Periyasamy S.M. Malhotra D. Xie Z. Shapiro J.I. Kidney Int. 2004; 66: 227-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 36Liu J. Liang M. Liu L. Malhotra D. Xie Z. Shapiro J.I. Kidney Int. 2005; 67: 1844-1854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because the Na/K-ATPase has both pumping and signaling functions, it is conceivable that changes in the amount of cellular Na/K-ATPase could have significant consequences on cell growth. Therefore, we have conducted the following experiments to reveal the role of cellular Na/K-ATPase in ouabain-induced cell growth regulation. Materials—Cell culture media, fetal bovine serum, and trypsin were purchased from Invitrogen; Optitran nitrocellulose membrane was from Schleicher & Schuell; the ECL Supersignal kit was purchased from Pierce; and the monoclonal anti-α1 antibody (α6F) was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa. The anti-α2 antibody was from Millipore (Billerica, MA), and the anti-α3 was from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). The anti-p21cip antibody, anti-Src monoclonal antibody, and all the secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). The polyclonal anti-Akt and anti-pAkt at Ser473 antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). The MTT assay kit was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). [3H]Ouabain was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cell Culture—The pig kidney epithelia cells (LLC-PK1 cells), human breast cancer cells (BT-20 cells and MDA-MB-435s), and human prostate cancer cells (DU145 cells) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or RPMI 1640 medium (for DU145 cells) in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator (37Wang H. Haas M. Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Li S. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17250-17259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The Na/K-ATPase knockdown (A4–11 and PY-17), rat α1-rescued PY-17 cells (AAC-19), and caveolin-1 knockdown (C2-9) cells were derived from LLC-PK1 cells and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described (38Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Qu W. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; Google Scholar). To eliminate the confounding effect of growth factors in the serum, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h before experiments unless otherwise indicated. Western Blot Analysis—The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, as previously described (37Wang H. Haas M. Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Li S. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17250-17259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm, and the supernatants were used for protein assay and subjected to Western blot analysis. The samples were separated on SDS-PAGE (50 μg/lane) and transferred to a cellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with 4% nonfat dried milk in TBS-T (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0) for 1 h at room temperature and probed with specific antibodies. The protein signals were detected using an ECL kit and quantified using a Bio-Rad GS-670 imaging densitometer. MTT Assay for Measuring Cell Proliferation—The cells were subcultured in 96-well plates at the density of 10,000 cells/well. After 12 h of serum starvation, the cells were exposed to different concentrations of ouabain for 24 h. Ten μl of MTT reagent was added to each well for 90 min. The formazan crystal was dissolved with detergent, and the OD value was measured at 570 nm as instructed by the manufacturer. Cell Growth Curve and Cell Cycle Measurement—The cells were subcultured in 12-well plates at 50,000/well for 24 h, serum-starved for 24 h, and then treated with different concentrations of ouabain for indicated time periods. At each indicated time point, three wells of control or treated cells were trypsinized and counted. For cell cycle measurement, the cells were trypsinized and resuspended in citrate buffer (8.55% sucrose, 1.18% sodium citrate, 5% Me2SO, pH 7.6) and stained with propidium iodide as described by Konski et al. (39Konski A.A. Myles J.L. Sawyer T. Neisler J. Phibbs G. Leininger S. Kim K. Dobelbower Jr., R.R. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 1991; 21: 1033-1039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The stained cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry. [3H]Ouabain Binding—To measure the effects of ouabain on cell surface expression of Na/K-ATPase, serum-starved cells were cultured in 12-well plates and treated with ouabain for 72 h. Afterward, the cells were washed with serum-free medium and subjected to [3H]ouabain binding assay as described (40Baker P.F. Willis J.S. J. Physiol. 1972; 224: 441-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated in K+-free Krebs solution (137 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm NaH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm dextrose, 15 mm Tris, pH 7.4) for 15 min and then exposed to 100 nm [3H]ouabain for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 20 μm monensin. At the end of incubation, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold K+-free Krebs solution, solubilized in 0.1 m NaOH-0.2% SDS, and counted in a scintillation counter for [3H]ouabain. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 5 mm unlabeled ouabain and subtracted from total binding. Parallel plates were used for counting cell numbers. [3H]Ouabain binding data were calculated as binding sites/cell. Confocal Imaging and Immunocytochemistry—LLC-PK1, BT20, and DU145 cells were serum-starved for 24 h and treated with ouabain (10 nm) for 6 h on coverslips. The cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 15 min and blocked with Signal Enhancer from Invitrogen. A monoclonal anti-Na/K-ATPase α1 antibody was then added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After three washes, a secondary Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The coverslip was washed, mounted, and imaged using a Leica confocal microscope as described (5Tian J. Cai T. Yuan Z. Wang H. Liu L. Haas M. Maksimova E. Huang X.Y. Xie Z.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Quantitative RT-PCR—The cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes and serum-starved for 24 h after the confluence reached 90%. The cells were then treated with 10 nm ouabain for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol and subjected to quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The assays were performed on the AB 7500 real time PCR system with the following protocol: 1 cycle (6 min at 95 °C), 40 cycles (30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 52 °C, 30 s at 72 °C, and 1 min at 85 °C), followed by a dissociation stage to ensure a single product. The reactions are in a total volume of 25 μl, including 1.25 μl of Sybr Green (Invitrogen), 0.125 μl of DNA polymerase (Denville), 2.5 μl of dNTP (Invitrogen), 10 ng of cDNA. Primer pairs were used at 5 μm concentration, and the sequences are: human GAPDH, 5′-GGGAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGT and 3′-TCCACTTTACCAGAGTTAAAAGCAG; human Na/K-ATPase α1, 5′-TGTCCAGAATTGCAG and 3′-TGCCCGCTTAAGAATAGGTAGGT (41Murphy K.T.

The relative Na/K-ATPase α1 gene expression was calculated by comparative threshold (CT) method (ΔΔCT). To normalize the difference amounts of cDNA, GAPDH was used as an internal control. Statistics—The data are presented as the means ± S.E. and compared using Student's t test. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Ouabain Regulates Cell Growth and Na/K-ATPase Expression in a Cell-specific Manner—It is known that ouabain can either stimulate or inhibit cell proliferation in a cell-specific manner (16Aydemir-Koksoy A. Abramowitz J. Allen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46605-46611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 20Huang Y.T. Chueh S.C. Teng C.M. Guh J.H. Biochem.

To understand the molecular mechanism of these opposing effects, we first compared the effects of ouabain on cell growth in two human epithelia-derived cancer cell lines (BT20 and DU145) and a pig kidney epithelial cell line (LLC-PK1). As shown in Fig. 1A, MTT assays indicated that ouabain at 1–50 nm stimulated cell proliferation in LLC-PK1 cells. These findings are consistent with the observed effects of ouabain on other renal epithelial cells (47Dmitrieva R.I. Doris P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28160-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 48Nguyen A.N. Wallace D.P. Blanco G. J. Am Soc. Nephrol. 2007; 18: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, we failed to detect any stimulatory effect of ouabain on either breast cancer BT20 or prostate cancer DU145 cells. Moreover, 10–50 nm ouabain caused a significant inhibition of cell proliferation in these cells (Fig. 1A). To further confirm these observations, we counted cell numbers in the presence or absence of ouabain as a function of time. As depicted in Fig. 1B, ouabain increased the number of LLC-PK1 cells in a time-dependent manner, confirming that ouabain stimulates the proliferation of these cells. On the contrary, the same treatment significantly inhibits the proliferation of BT20 cells and DU145 cells. These findings are in accordance with what has been reported in the literature (22Yeh J.Y. Huang W.J. Kan S.F. Wang P.S. J. Urol. 2001; 166: 1937-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 34Kometiani P. Liu L. Askari A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Because ouabain inhibited cell proliferation by stimulating the expression of cell cycle inhibitor p21cip in human breast cancer MDA-MB-435s cells (34Kometiani P. Liu L. Askari A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we measured the effects of ouabain on p21cip expression. As depicted in Fig. 1C, whereas 10 nm ouabain stimulated the expression of cell cycle inhibitor p21cip in BT20 and DU145 cells, it failed to do so in LLC-PK1 cells. Because the Na/K-ATPase is the receptor for ouabain, we next tested whether ouabain affects the expression of Na/K-ATPase. Western blot analyses indicated that all three cell lines expressed a ouabain-sensitive α1 isoform of Na/K-ATPase. Under the same experimental conditions, the expression of α2 or α3 isoform was undetectable (data not shown). Interestingly, the effects of ouabain on α1 expression were also cell-specific. Although ouabain caused induction of α1 expression in LLC-PK1 cells after either 24 h or 72 h exposure, it reduced the cellular amount of α1 in both BT20 and DU145 cells (Fig. 2A). Because ouabain also inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-435s cells (34Kometiani P. Liu L. Askari A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we measured the effects of ouabain on α1 expression after these cells were exposed to 5 nm ouabain for 24 h. A significant reduction in α1 expression was detected (82 ± 2% of control, n = 3, p < 0.05). Thus, ouabain-induced changes in α1 expression were clearly correlated with its effects on cell proliferation. It is known that the β1 subunit plays an important role not only in the formation of a functional Na/K-ATPase but also in the formation of tight junctions and in the suppression of tumor cell growth (49Inge L.J. Rajasekaran S.A. Yoshimoto K. Mischel P.S. McBride W. Landaw E. Rajasekaran A.K. Histol. Histopathol. 2008; 23: 459-467PubMed Google Scholar, 50Rajasekaran S.A. Ball Jr., W.J. Bander N.H. Liu H. Pardee J.D. Rajasekaran A.K. J. Urol. 1999; 162: 574-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 51Rajasekaran S.A. Palmer L.G. Quan K. Harper J.F. Ball Jr., W.J. Bander N.H. Peralta Soler A. Rajasekaran A.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 279-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, we assessed whether ouabain affects β1 expression in LLC-PK1 and cancer cell lines. The cells were treated with 10 nm ouabain for 24 h, and the amount of β1 was measured in the cell lysates by Western blot. As depicted in Fig. 2B, ouabain caused a modest increase in β1 expression in LLC-PK1 but not BT-20 cells. To assess the functional consequence of these changes in α1 expression, we measured the number of active Na/K-ATPase in the plasma membrane. The cells were exposed to different concentrations of ouabain for 72 h and then subjected to [3H]ouabain binding. It is important to note that this assay measured the number of functional Na/K-ATPase that was not occupied by 5 or 10 nm ouabain after 72 h treatment. As depicted in Fig. 2C, ouabain up to 10 nm barely changed the number of active Na/K-ATPase in LLC-PK1 cells, indicating that the ouabain-induced up-regulation of α1 is just sufficient to replete the plasma membrane pool of active Na/K-ATPase. In contrast, ouabain caused a significant decrease in the number of active plasma membrane Na/K-ATPase in both BT20 and DU145 cells (Fig. 2C). Taken together, the data suggest that the decrease in the plasma membrane Na/K-ATPase may be involved in the ouabain-induced growth inhibition in cancer cells. Reduction of the Na/K-ATPase Slows Cell Proliferation and Enables Ouabain to Inhibit Cell Proliferation in LLC-PK1 Cells—LLC-PK1 cells and the two cancer cell lines are derived from different organs and species. To further test the proposal that a decrease in cellular Na/K-ATPase is involved in ouabain-induced inhibition of cell proliferation, we measured the effects of a graded knockdown of the Na/K-ATPase on cell proliferation in LLC-PK1 cells. The generation of the knockdown cell lines has been previously reported (4Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Qu W. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19709-19719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 52Liang M. Tian J. Liu L. Pierre S. Liu J. Shapiro J. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10585-10593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A4–11 and PY-17 cells expressed about 40 and 10% of the Na/K-ATPase in comparison with the control vector-transfected LLC-PK1 (P-11) cells, respectively (4Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Qu W. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19709-19719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, P-11 cells behaved similarly to the parent LLC-PK1 cells in response to ouabain stimulation. Ouabain, at concentrations from 1 to 10 nm, stimulated cell proliferation. In contrast, A4–11 and PY-17 cells behaved like BT20 and DU145 cells. No growth stimulation was detected. Instead, reduction of Na/K-ATPase expression by small interfering RNA-mediated mechanism sensitized these cells to ouabain-induced cell growth inhibition (Fig. 3). For example, 10 nm ouabain caused more than a 80% reduction in cell proliferation in PY-17 cells in comparison with that in P-11 cells. Moreover, the growth inhibitory effects of ouabain were clearly correlated with the cellular amount of Na/K-ATPase. To test whether this growth inhibitory effect of ouabain applies to other cardiotonic steroids, we measured the effects of digoxin, digitoxin, and marinobufagenin on cell proliferation in PY-17 cells. We observed that these compounds caused a growth inhibition similar to that of ouabain (data not shown). To further examine the consequences of Na/K-ATPase reduction in cell growth regul"

In the present study, we sought to evaluate the relationships between grey matter volume, early adverse events and cortisol levels in MDD. Methods/Results Grey matter volume was compared between 19 controls and 19 individuals with MDD using voxel-based morphometry. A history of early adverse events was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Subjects also provided salivary cortisol samples. Depressed patients showed decreased grey matter volume in the rostral ACC as compared to controls. Rostral ACC volume was inversely correlated with both cortisol and early adverse events. Conclusions These findings suggest a key relationship between ACC morphology, a history of early adverse events and circulating cortisol in the pathophysiology of MDD."
https://openalex.org/W2008242230,"Conditions experienced during early life can have profound effects on individual development and condition in adulthood. Differences in nutritional provisioning in birds during the first month of life can lead to differences in growth, reproductive success and survival. Yet, under natural conditions shorter periods of nutritional stress will be more prevalent. Individuals may respond differently, depending on the period of development during which nutritional stress was experienced. Such differences may surface specifically when poor environmental conditions challenge individuals again as adults. Here, we investigated long term consequences of differences in nutritional conditions experienced during different periods of early development by female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) on measures of management and acquisition of body reserves. As nestlings or fledglings, subjects were raised under different nutritional conditions, a low or high quality diet. After subjects reached sexual maturity, we measured their sensitivity to periods of food restriction, their exploration and foraging behaviour as well as adult resting metabolic rate (RMR). During a short period of food restriction, subjects from the poor nutritional conditions had a higher body mass loss than those raised under qualitatively superior nutritional conditions. Moreover, subjects that were raised under poor nutritional conditions were faster to engage in exploratory and foraging behaviour. But RMR did not differ among treatments. These results reveal that early nutritional conditions affect adult exploratory behaviour, a representative personality trait, foraging and adult's physiological condition. As early nutritional conditions are reflected in adult phenotypic plasticity specifically when stressful situations reappear, the results suggest that costs for poor developmental conditions are paid when environmental conditions deteriorate."
https://openalex.org/W2039797768,"Type A influenza virus is one of important pathogens of various animals, including humans, pigs, horses, marine mammals and birds. Currently, the viral type has been classified into 16 hemagglutinin and 9 neuraminidase subtypes, but the phylogenetic diversity and distribution within the viral type largely remain unclear from the whole view.The panorama phylogenetic trees of influenza A viruses were calculated with representative sequences selected from approximately 23,000 candidates available in GenBank using web servers in NCBI and the software MEGA 4.0. Lineages and sublineages were classified according to genetic distances, topology of the phylogenetic trees and distributions of the viruses in hosts, regions and time.Here, two panorama phylogenetic trees of type A influenza virus covering all the 16 hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 neuraminidase subtypes, respectively, were generated. The trees provided us whole views and some novel information to recognize influenza A viruses including that some subtypes of avian influenza viruses are more complicated than Eurasian and North American lineages as we thought in the past. They also provide us a framework to generalize the history and explore the future of the viral circulation and evolution in different kinds of hosts. In addition, a simple and comprehensive nomenclature system for the dozens of lineages and sublineages identified within the viral type was proposed, which if universally accepted, will facilitate communications on the viral evolution, ecology and epidemiology."
https://openalex.org/W2056933808,"Background Cysteine (Cys) and its disulfide, cystine (CySS) represent the major extracellular thiol/disulfide redox control system. The redox potential (Eh) of Cys/CySS is centered at approximately −80 mV in the plasma of healthy adults, and oxidation of Eh Cys/CySS is implicated in inflammation associated with various diseases. Methodology/Principal Findings The purpose of the present study was to determine whether oxidized Eh Cys/CySS is a determinant of interleukin (IL)-1β levels. Results showed a 1.7-fold increase in secreted pro-IL-1β levels in U937 monocytes exposed to oxidized Eh Cys/CySS (−46 mV), compared to controls exposed to a physiological Eh of −80 mV (P<0.01). In LPS-challenged mice, preservation of plasma Eh Cys/CySS from oxidation by dietary sulfur amino acid (SAA) supplementation, was associated with a 1.6-fold decrease in plasma IL-1β compared to control mice fed an isonitrogenous SAA-adequate diet (P<0.01). Analysis of Eh Cys/CySS and IL-1β in human plasma revealed a significant positive association between oxidized Eh Cys/CySS and IL-1β after controlling for age, gender, and BMI (P<0.001). Conclusions/Significance These data show that oxidized extracellular Eh Cys/CySS is a determinant of IL-1β levels, and suggest that strategies to preserve Eh Cys/CySS may represent a means to control IL-1β in inflammatory disease states."
https://openalex.org/W2071993518,"Recent studies have identified RNA transcripts arising from mammalian telomeres with the transcript of the C-rich strand (r(5'-UUAGGG-3')(n)) being much more abundant than transcripts of the G-rich strand. Here we used transmission electron microscopy, CD, and nuclease digestion to investigate the structure of approximately 640-nucleotide (nt) RNA transcripts of the C-rich and G-rich strands of mammalian telomeric DNA. The CD spectrum of the C-rich RNA in low salt (10 mm KCl) or high salt (100 mm KCl) was typical of mixed sequence RNA, whereas the CD spectrum for the G-rich RNA differed with changes characteristic of parallel G-quadruplexes at the higher salt concentration. Electron microscopy visualization of the C-rich RNA revealed relatively extended unstructured molecules 59.7 +/- 17.8 nm in length and with a width consistent with single-stranded RNA following metal coating. In contrast, the G-rich RNA was observed as round particles and short, thick rods with the rods being most prevalent in high salt conditions and absent in low salt. The rods were 22.7 +/- 4.8 nm in length and 7.6 nm in width. Digestion of the G-rich RNA with T1 RNA nuclease revealed a ladder of bands whose sizes were integral multiples of 24 nt plus a 4-nt overhang. These observations suggest a model in which G-rich telomeric RNA folds into chains of particles each consisting of four (UUAGGG) repeats stabilized by parallel G-quartets and joined by UUA linkers. These chains further condense to form short rods and round particles."
https://openalex.org/W2120747949,"Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone regulating important functions in higher plants, notably responses to abiotic stress. Recently, chemical or physical stimulation of human granulocytes was shown to induce production and release of endogenous ABA, which activates specific cell functions. Here we provide evidence that ABA stimulates several functional activities of the murine microglial cell line N9 (NO and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production, cell migration) through the second messenger cyclic ADP-ribose and an increase of intracellular calcium. ABA production and release occur in N9 cells stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, phorbol myristate acetate, the chemoattractant peptide f-MLP, or beta-amyloid, the primary plaque component in Alzheimer disease. Finally, ABA priming stimulates N9 cell migration toward beta-amyloid. These results indicate that ABA is a pro-inflammatory hormone inducing autocrine microglial activation, potentially representing a new target for anti-inflammatory therapies aimed at limiting microglia-induced tissue damage in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2034793318,"Background Leishmania is the etiologic agent of leishmanisais, a protozoan disease whose pathogenic events are not well understood. Current therapy is suboptimal due to toxicity of the available therapeutic agents and the emergence of drug resistance. Compounding these problems is the increase in the number of cases of Leishmania-HIV coinfection, due to the overlap between the AIDS epidemic and leishmaniasis. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present report, we have investigated the effect of HIV aspartyl peptidase inhibitors (PIs) on the Leishmania amazonensis proliferation, ultrastructure, interaction with macrophage cells and expression of classical peptidases which are directly involved in the Leishmania pathogenesis. All the HIV PIs impaired parasite growth in a dose-dependent fashion, especially nelfinavir and lopinavir. HIV PIs treatment caused profound changes in the leishmania ultrastructure as shown by transmission electron microscopy, including cytoplasm shrinking, increase in the number of lipid inclusions and some cells presenting the nucleus closely wrapped by endoplasmic reticulum resembling an autophagic process, as well as chromatin condensation which is suggestive of apoptotic death. The hydrolysis of HIV peptidase substrate by L. amazonensis extract was inhibited by pepstatin and HIV PIs, suggesting that an aspartyl peptidase may be the intracellular target of the inhibitors. The treatment with HIV PIs of either the promastigote forms preceding the interaction with macrophage cells or the amastigote forms inside macrophages drastically reduced the association indexes. Despite all these beneficial effects, the HIV PIs induced an increase in the expression of cysteine peptidase b (cpb) and the metallopeptidase gp63, two well-known virulence factors expressed by Leishmania spp. Conclusions/Significance In the face of leishmaniasis/HIV overlap, it is critical to further comprehend the sophisticated interplays among Leishmania, HIV and macrophages. In addition, there are many unresolved questions related to the management of Leishmania-HIV-coinfected patients. For instance, the efficacy of therapy aimed at controlling each pathogen in coinfected individuals remains largely undefined. The results presented herein add new in vitro insight into the wide spectrum efficacy of HIV PIs and suggest that additional studies about the synergistic effects of classical antileishmanial compounds and HIV PIs in macrophages coinfected with Leishmania and HIV-1 should be performed."
https://openalex.org/W2078726241,"The maintenance of the Mg2+ balance of the body is essential for neuromuscular excitability, protein synthesis, nucleic acid stability, and numerous enzymatic systems. The Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 6 (TRPM6) functions as the gatekeeper of transepithelial Mg2+ transport. However, the molecular regulation of TRPM6 channel activity remains elusive. Here, we identified the repressor of estrogen receptor activity (REA) as an interacting protein of TRPM6 that binds to the 6th, 7th, and 8th β-sheets in its α-kinase domain. Importantly, REA and TRPM6 are coexpressed in renal Mg2+-transporting distal convoluted tubules (DCT). We demonstrated that REA significantly inhibits TRPM6, but not its closest homologue TRPM7, channel activity. This inhibition occurs in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, since REA has no effect on the TRPM6 phosphotransferase-deficient mutant (K1804R), while it still binds to this mutant. Moreover, activation of protein kinase C by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-PMA potentiated the inhibitory effect of REA on TRPM6 channel activity. Finally, we showed that the interaction between REA and TRPM6 is a dynamic process, as short-term 17β-estradiol treatment disassociates the binding between these proteins. In agreement with this, 17β-estradiol treatment significantly stimulates the TRPM6-mediated current in HEK293 cells. These results suggest a rapid pathway for the effect of estrogen on Mg2+ homeostasis in addition to its transcriptional effect. Together, these data indicate that REA operates as a negative feedback modulator of TRPM6 in the regulation of active Mg2+ (re)absorption and provides new insight into the molecular mechanism of renal transepithelial Mg2+ transport.

These results suggest a rapid pathway for the effect of estrogen on Mg2+ homeostasis in addition to its transcriptional effect. Together, these data indicate that REA operates as a negative feedback modulator of TRPM6 in the regulation of active Mg2+ (re)absorption and provides new insight into the molecular mechanism of renal transepithelial Mg2+ transport. Mg2+ is a central electrolyte important for many biological functions by its intervention in gene transcription, protein synthesis, nucleic acid stability, channel regulation, cell cycle, and numerous enzymatic systems (1Vetter T.

In most species, serum Mg2+ levels are kept within a narrow range between 0.8 and 1.1 mm, while the free intracellular Mg2+ concentration [Mg2+]i has been estimated around 0.5–1.0 mm (5Chubanov V. Gudermann T. Schlingmann K.P. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 451: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Regulation of the Mg2+ balance principally resides within the kidney where Mg2+ excretion tightly matches the intestinal absorption of Mg2+ (5Chubanov V. Gudermann T. Schlingmann K.P. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 451: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The majority of Mg2+ in the renal ultrafiltrate is reabsorbed passively in the proximal tubule and the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, while the final Mg2+ excretion is determined in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) 3The abbreviations used are: DCT, distal convoluted tubule; TRPM6, Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 6; REA, repressor of estrogen receptor activity; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; ER, estrogen receptor.3The abbreviations used are: DCT, distal convoluted tubule; TRPM6, Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 6; REA, repressor of estrogen receptor activity; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; ER, estrogen receptor. via an active reabsorption process (5Chubanov V. Gudermann T. Schlingmann K.P. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 451: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 6 (TRPM6) localizes along the apical membranes of DCT and intestinal cells where it plays a crucial role in active Mg2+ (re)absorption. Mutations in TRPM6 lead to hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH) indicating that this channel is important for the maintenance of the Mg2+ balance (6Walder R.Y. Landau D. Meyer P.

Previous studies demonstrated that expression of TRPM6 is regulated by dietary Mg2+ and its channel activity is strongly inhibited by the intracellular Mg2+ concentration ([Mg2+]i) (8Voets T.

Generally, Mg2+-free solutions are used to measure the characteristic outwardly rectifying TRPM6 currents (8Voets T. Nilius B. Hoefs S. van der Kemp A.W. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. J.

Remarkably, TRPM6 contains a C-terminal α-kinase domain, of which the regulatory role on channel activity remains elusive (12Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E.

It has been shown that RACK1 can interact with this domain and inhibit channel activity in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (15Cao G. Thebault S. van der Wijst J. van der Kemp A. Lasonder E. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 168-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated that the ATP binding motif in the α-kinase domain is required for modulation of TRPM6 channel activity by intracellular ATP (16Thebault S. Cao G. Venselaar H. Xi Q.

Previous studies suggested that Mg2+ uptake in DCT is stimulated by hormones, such as parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, arginine vasopressin, insulin and prostaglandins (17Dai L.J. Ritchie G. Kerstan D. Kang H.S. Cole D.E. Quamme G.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 51-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). A recent study reported that epidermal growth factor (EGF) acts as an autocrine/paracrine magnesiotropic hormone via stimulating its receptor on the basolateral membrane of DCT cells, thereby specifically increasing TRPM6 current (18Groenestege W.M.

Next to this classical transcriptional pathway, accumulating evidence suggests also rapid estrogen effects that occur within minutes via a non-transcriptional route (19Moriarty K. Kim K.H.

Estrogen has the ability to facilitate rapid membrane-initiated signaling cascades through activation of plasma membrane-associated receptors, such as the recently discovered G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPCR30) (23Revankar C.M. Cimino D.F. Sklar L.A. Arterburn J.B. Prossnitz E.R. Science. 2005; 307: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated that the classical estrogen receptor α (ERα)) can be localized to the plasma membrane in response to estrogen or by interaction with adaptor proteins like Shc and p130Cas (24Cabodi S. Moro L. Baj G. Smeriglio M. Di Stefano P. Gippone S. Surico N. Silengo L. Turco E. Tarone G. Defilippi P. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1603-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25Levin E.R. Steroids. 2002; 67: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to investigate the regulation of the α-kinase domain on TRPM6 channel activity by identification of proteins specifically interacting with the α-kinase domain. Using a combined approach including biochemical, immunohistochemical, mass spectrometry, and electrophysiological analyses, we demonstrated a novel operation mode for rapid estrogen regulation on TRPM6 channel activity via attenuating the inhibitory effect of the TRPM6-associated protein, repressor of estrogen receptor activity (REA). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were grown and transfected as previously described (26Topala C.N. Groenestege W.T. Thebault S. van den Berg D. Nilius B. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and electrophysiological recordings were performed 48-h post-transfection. DNA Constructs and cRNA Synthesis—The kinase domain of mouse (1759–2028) and human (1750–2022) TRPM6 was cloned into pGEX6p-2 (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) by PCR using mouse kidney cDNA or human TRPM6 in pCINeo/IRES-GFP (8Voets T.

The α-kinase domain (1750–2022) of human TRPM6 was subcloned into the pEBG vector (27Okada T. Inoue R. Yamazaki K. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Yamakuni T. Tanaka I. Shimizu S. Ikenaka K. Imoto K. Mori Y. J.

Wild-type TRPM6 in the pCINeo/IRES-GFP vector was HA-tagged at the N-terminal tail as described previously (8Voets T. Nilius B. Hoefs S. van der Kemp A.W. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. J.

GST-α-kinase truncants (TRPM6 1759–1993, 1759–1885, 1759–1857, 1857–1885, and 1759–1813) mutants, TRPM6 phosphotransferase-deficient mutant (K1804R) and GST-α-kinase K1804R mutant were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All constructs were verified by sequence analysis. REA cRNA was synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (28Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W. Hartog A. van Os C.H. Willems P.H. Bindels R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Identification of Proteins by Nano Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry—After SDS-PAGE, GST, and GST-TRPM6 α-kinase interacting proteins were treated with dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide, and digested in-gel by trypsin as previously described (29Olsen J.V. Ong S.E. Mann M. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2004; 3: 608-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Peptide identification experiments by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry were performed using a nano-HPLC Agillent 1100 nanoflow system connected online to a 7-Tesla linear quadrupole ion trap-Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (LTQ-FT) mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, Bremen, Germany) as described previously (29Olsen J.V. Ong S.E. Mann M. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2004; 3: 608-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Peptides and proteins were identified using the Mascot 2.1 (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) algorithm to search a local version of the Uniprot data base. First ranked peptides were parsed from Mascot data base search html files with MSQuant to generate unique first ranked peptide lists and internal calibration of measured ion masses. GST Fusion Proteins and Pull-down Assay—TRPM6 α-kinase GST fusion protein was purified as previously described (30van de Graaf S.F. Hoenderop J.G. Gkika D. Lamers D. Prenen J. Rescher U. Gerke V. Staub O. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). REA protein was labeled with [35S]methionine using a reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) and added to purified GST fusion proteins, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, beads were washed extensively with pull-down buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.33% (v/v) Triton X-100). The bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by autoradiography. Sequence Analysis and Structure Modeling—The structural model of TRPM6 α-kinase domain was built based on the crystal structure of TRPM7 α-kinase domain (31Yamaguchi H. Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1047-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank under ID codes: 1IAJ (apo), 1IAH (ADP complex), and 1IA9 (AMP·PNP complex)) using SWISS-MODEL and analyzed by DeepView Swiss-PdbViewer (Version 3.7) and Yasara. RT-PCR—Total RNA isolation from mouse tissue and reverse transcription were performed as described previously (30van de Graaf S.F. Hoenderop J.G. Gkika D. Lamers D. Prenen J. Rescher U. Gerke V. Staub O. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). REA and β-actin were amplified by PCR and subsequently analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Electrophysiology—Patch clamp experiments were performed in the tight seal whole-cell configuration at room temperature using an EPC-10 patch clamp amplifier computer controlled by the Patchmaster software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Electrode resistances were 2–5 MΩ, and capacitance and access resistance were monitored continuously. A ramp protocol, consisting of linear voltage ramps from –100 to +100 mV (within 450 ms), was applied every 2 s from a holding potential of 0 mV. Current densities were obtained by normalizing the current amplitude to the cell membrane capacitance. The time course of current development was determined by measuring the current at +80 and –80 mV. I/V relations were established from the ramp protocols. The analysis and display of patch clamp data were performed using Igor Pro software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego). The standard pipette solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2. The extracellular solutions contained 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, and 1 mm Ca2+, pH 7.4. To investigate the effect of purified GST-REA or GST on TRPM6-mediated currents, proteins were added to the standard pipette solution and thereby infused via the patch pipette for 7 min before starting the recordings. Co-precipitation—HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with REA and pEBG-TRPM6 α-kinase or pEBG empty vector. Cells were treated with 50 nm 17β-estradiol or vehicle for 10 min at 37 °C and were lysed for 1 h on ice in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.33% (v/v) Triton including the protease inhibitors leupeptin (0.01 mg/ml), pepstatin (0.05 mg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm)). After centrifugation, supernatants of the lysates were incubated overnight with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads at 4 °C. After extensive washing in lysis buffer, the bound proteins were eluted and separated by SDS-PAGE. The co-precipitation was analyzed using the anti-REA antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Cell Surface Labeling with Biotin—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with 15 μg HA-TRPM6 in poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated 10-cm dishes. 72 h after transfection, cells were treated with 50 nm 17β-estradiol or vehicle for 10 min at 37 °C. Cell surface labeling with NHS-LC-LC-biotin (Pierce, Etten-Leur, The Netherlands) was performed as previously described (32Gkika D. Topala C.N. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 1 h after homogenizing, biotinylated proteins were precipitated using neutravidin-agarose beads (Pierce, Etten-Leur, The Netherlands). TRPM6 expression was analyzed by immunoblot for the precipitates (plasma membrane fraction) and for the total cell lysates using the anti-HA antibody (Sigma). Immunoblotting—Protein samples were denatured by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in Laemmli buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were incubated with either mouse anti-HA (Sigma) or rabbit anti-REA (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) antibody. Subsequently, blots were incubated with sheep horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and then visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (33Hoenderop J.G. Dardenne O. Van Abel M. Van Der Kemp A.W. Van Os C.H. St -Arnaud R. Bindels R.J. Faseb J. 2002; 16: 1398-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse kidney serial sections were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with rabbit anti-REA (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and guinea pig anti-TRPM6 (8Voets T. Nilius B. Hoefs S. van der Kemp A.W. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). To visualize TRPM6, tyramide signal amplification kit (NEN Life Science Products, Zaventem, Belgium) was used after incubation with biotin-coated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Images were taken with a Bio-Rad MRC 100 confocal laser scanning microscope. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—HA-TRPM6 was precipitated by using the anti-HA antibody. The precipitates were incubated in a total volume of 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 4 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 100 μm ATP) and 2 μCi of [γ32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by three washing steps with phosphorylation washing buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 4 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2). Phosphorylation was analyzed after gel electrophoresis by autoradiography. Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance between groups was determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA). In the case of significance, differences between the means of two groups were analyzed by unpaired Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. REA Associates with TRPM6—To identify proteins potentially interacting with the TRPM6 α-kinase domain, the combination of a GST pull-down with the α-kinase domain of TRPM6 in mouse kidney lysate followed by Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry (FTMS), was performed. REA (34Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage-Mourroux R. Chang W. Martini P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6947-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), was identified as an interacting protein of the TRPM6 α-kinase domain. Next, GST pull-down binding assays were used to confirm the interaction between REA and TRPM6 α-kinase domain. [35S]methionine-labeled REA protein was incubated with GST and GST-α-kinase immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. REA interacted specifically with the GST-α-kinase, but not with GST alone (Fig. 1A). Next, the association between TRPM6 and REA was further substantiated in mammalian cells by co-precipitation studies of GST and GST-α-kinase in REA-expressing HEK293 cells. REA co-precipitated with the GST-α-kinase, but not with GST alone (Fig. 1B). REA Binds to the 6th, 7th, and 8th β-Sheets in the TRPM6 α-Kinase Domain—To determine the REA binding site within TRPM6, a series of deletion mutants in the α-kinase domain was constructed. Truncated TRPM6 α-kinase mutants were expressed as GST-fused proteins and evaluated for their interaction with [35S]methionine-labeled REA protein (Fig. 1C). Truncation at position 1857 abolished the interaction between the two proteins, whereas truncation at position 1885 had no effect on the interaction with REA. Moreover, a GST fusion protein containing only the short peptide between the amino acids 1857 and 1885 of the TRPM6 α-kinase domain bound to REA (Fig. 1C). Therefore, the REA binding site within TRPM6 is restricted to the region between the positions 1857 and 1885. The integrity and quantity of the GST fusion proteins was analyzed and confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1D). The lower abundant product bands of different sizes might be due to binding of so far unknown proteins to the bigger truncation mutants or degradation products. To explore the REA binding site in the TRPM6 α-kinase domain, the tertiary structure of this domain was modeled by SWISS-MODEL based on the homology between TRPM6 and TRPM7 α-kinase domains (15Cao G. Thebault S. van der Wijst J. van der Kemp A. Lasonder E. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 168-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31Yamaguchi H. Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1047-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Because of the significant homology between the TRPM6 and TRPM7 α-kinase domains (84%), these two domains share a well-conserved secondary structure. The surface and accessibility analysis of the REA binding site (6th, 7th, and 8th β-sheets) using Yasara software suggested that, among the 28 amino acids of the REA binding site, 18 are localized at the surface of the TRPM6 α-kinase domain. Because RACK1 also binds to this region, we investigated whether RACK1 can affect the interaction between TRPM6 and REA. As shown in Fig. 1E, REA co-precipitated in similar amounts with GST α-kinase in the presence and absence of RACK1. REA Co-expresses with TRPM6 in Kidney—To address the tissue distribution of REA, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed on mouse tissues. The expected DNA fragment of 916 bp for REA was detected in most tested tissues as indicated in Fig. 2A. The β-actin fragment was present in all the tissues evaluated. Of note, REA is present in kidney where TRPM6 is predominantly expressed (8Voets T. Nilius B. Hoefs S. van der Kemp A.W. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). To further study the co-expression between REA and TRPM6 in kidney, immunohistochemistry was performed on serial mouse kidney sections. This analysis indicated immunopositive staining for REA in the TRPM6-expressing DCT cells that have been implicated in active Mg2+ reabsorption (8Voets T. Nilius B. Hoefs S. van der Kemp A.W. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). REA Inhibits TRPM6 Channel Activity in a Phosphorylation-dependent Manner—The functional role of REA on TRPM6 channel activity was investigated by whole-cell patch clamp recordings in HEK293 cells. Steeply outward rectifying currents carried by Na+ were measured in HEK293 cells co-expressing TRPM6 and empty vector (mock) (Fig. 3, A and B). These currents were significantly inhibited in cells co-expressing TRPM6 and REA (Fig. 3, A and B). Of note, the inhibitory effect of REA was specific for TRPM6, because REA did not affect the current in TRPM7-expressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 3, C and D). To further analyze the inhibitory effect of REA on TRPM6, GST and GST-REA were expressed in HEK293 cells and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Fig. 4A). These purified GST and GST-REA proteins were subsequently perfused into TRPM6-expressing HEK293 cells via the patch pipette before whole-cell recording. As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, REA significantly inhibited the TRPM6-mediated current, but the associated protein did not change the electrophysiological characteristics of the recorded currents. GST alone did not affect the TRPM6-mediated current. Next, the phosphotransferase-deficient mutant (K1804R) was used to investigate the role of TRPM6 phosphorylation activity in this process. REA was unable to inhibit the K1804R mutant-mediated current, similar as GST alone (Fig. 4, D and E). Importantly, the co-precipitation assay showed that the K1804R mutation did not influence the binding between TRPM6 and REA (Fig. 4F). Importantly, our in vitro phosphorylation assay demonstrated equal autophosphorylation of TRPM6 with or without REA co-expression (Fig. 4G). Next, we investigated the effect of PKC activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-PMA (PMA) on the regulatory effect of REA, since it has been shown that RACK1 inhibition can be prevented by 5 min of preincubation of 100 nm PMA (15Cao G. Thebault S. van der Wijst J. van der Kemp A. Lasonder E. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 168-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of cells co-expressing TRPM6 and REA significantly decreased TRPM6 channel activity. Of note, the current amplitude in the presence of PMA was not altered in cells expressing TRPM6 alone (Fig. 4H). Finally, we investigated whether REA is a phosphorylation target of TRPM6. The in vitro phosphorylation assay showed that REA is not phosphorylated by TRPM6 (Fig. 4G).FIGURE 4REA inhibits TRPM6 channel activity in a rapid and phosphorylation-dependent manner.

https://openalex.org/W2093033871,"Background The numerous studies examining where efforts to conserve biodiversity should be targeted are not matched by comparable research efforts addressing how conservation investments should be structured and what balance of conservation approaches works best in what contexts. An obvious starting point is to examine the past allocation of effort among conservation approaches and how this has evolved. Methodology/Principal Findings We examine the past allocation of conservation investment between conservation easements and fee simple acquisitions using the largest land trust in operation, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), as a case study. We analyse the balance of investments across the whole of the US and in individual states when measured in terms of the area protected and upfront cost of protecting land. Conclusions/Significance Across the US as a whole, the proportion of conservation investment allocated to easements is growing exponentially. Already 70% of the area of land protected in a given year, and half of all the financial investment in land conservation, is allocated to easements. The growth rate of conservation easements varies by a factor of two across states when measured in terms of the area protected and by a factor of three in terms of financial expenditure. Yet, we were unable to find consistent predictors that explained this variation. Our results underscore the urgency of implementing best practice guidelines for designing easements and of initiating a wider discussion of what balance of conservation approaches is desirable."
https://openalex.org/W2047827535,"Temperature affects the physiology, behavior, and evolution of organisms. We conducted mutagenesis and screens for mutants with altered temperature preference in Drosophila melanogaster and identified a cryophilic (cold-seeking) mutant, named atsugari (atu). Reduced expression of the Drosophila ortholog of dystroglycan (DmDG) induced tolerance to cold as well as preference for the low temperature. A sustained increase in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism caused by the reduced expression of DmDG accounted for the cryophilic phenotype of the atu mutant. Although most ectothermic animals do not use metabolically produced heat to regulate body temperature, our results indicate that their thermoregulatory behavior is closely linked to rates of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and that a mutation in a single gene can induce a sustained change in energy homeostasis and the thermal responses."

These findings implicate involvement of HbN in the defense of M. tuberculosis against nitrosative stress. The protein carries a tunnel system composed of a short and a long tunnel branch that has been proposed to facilitate diatomic ligand migration to the heme and an unusual Pre-A motif at the N terminus, which does not contribute significantly to the structural integrity of the protein, as it protrudes out of the compact globin fold. Strikingly, deletion of Pre-A region from the M. tuberculosis HbN drastically reduces its ability to scavenge nitric oxide (NO), whereas its insertion at the N terminus of Pre-A lacking HbN of Mycobacterium smegmatis improved its nitric-oxide dioxygenase activity. Titration of the oxygenated adduct of HbN and its mutants with NO indicated that the stoichiometric oxidation of protein is severalfold slower when the Pre-A region is deleted in HbN. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the excision of Pre-A motif results in distinct changes in the protein dynamics, which cause the gate of the tunnel long branch to be trapped into a closed conformation, thus impeding migration of diatomic ligands toward the heme active site. The present study, thus, unequivocally demonstrates vital function of Pre-A region in NO scavenging and unravels its unique role by which HbN might attain its efficient NO-detoxification ability.

https://openalex.org/W1977047204,"Base excision repair, a major repair pathway in mammalian cells, is responsible for correcting DNA base damage and maintaining genomic integrity. Recent reports show that the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 complex (9-1-1) stimulates enzymes proposed to perform a long patch-base excision repair sub-pathway (LP-BER), including DNA glycosylases, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), DNA polymerase β (pol β), flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), and DNA ligase I (LigI). However, 9-1-1 was found to produce minimal stimulation of FEN1 and LigI in the context of a complete reconstitution of LP-BER. We show here that pol β is a robust stimulator of FEN1 and a moderate stimulator of LigI. Apparently, there is a maximum possible stimulation of these two proteins such that after responding to pol β or another protein in the repair complex, only a small additional response to 9-1-1 is allowed. The 9-1-1 sliding clamp structure must serve primarily to coordinate enzyme actions rather than enhancing rate. Significantly, stimulation by the polymerase involves interaction of primer terminus-bound pol β with FEN1 and LigI. This observation provides compelling evidence that the proposed LP-BER pathway is actually employed in cells. Moreover, this pathway has been proposed to function by sequential enzyme actions in a “hit and run” mechanism. Our results imply that this mechanism is still carried out, but in the context of a multienzyme complex that remains structurally intact during the repair process.

Our results imply that this mechanism is still carried out, but in the context of a multienzyme complex that remains structurally intact during the repair process. The mammalian genome experiences constant stress from both external and internal factors that causes genomic instability. Eukaryotic cells have developed a number of DNA repair pathways that correct DNA damage before it results in permanent chromosomal alteration. Base excision repair (BER) 3The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; LP-BER, long patch-BER; nt, nucleotide(s); pol β, DNA polymerase β; FEN1, flap endonuclease 1; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; APE1, AP endonuclease 1; 9-1-1, Rad 9-Rad1-Hus1; Lig1, DNA ligase 1; dRP, deoxyribose phosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; THF, tetrahydrofuran; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; IP, immunoprecipitation. is the major pathway responsible for reversing DNA damage sustained by individual nucleotide bases. Mammalian BER is initiated by DNA glycosylases, which recognize structural alteration of a nitrogenous base and excise it leaving an intact sugar-phosphate backbone with an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site (1Scharer O.D. Jiricny J. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). AP sites in humans are detected by AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) that cleaves the phosphate backbone of the damaged strand, leaving a nick with a 3′-OH group and a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) residue. The dRP-bordered nick is not a substrate for ligation. If the dRP residue is not oxidized or reduced, repair can proceed via a short patch-BER pathway, in which the dRP residue is removed by the 5′-lyase activity of DNA polymerase β (pol β), which concurrently fills in the 1-nt gap, and the resulting nick is sealed by the DNA ligase III-XRCC1 complex (2Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 3Piersen C.E. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol.

However, if the oxidative state of the dRP is altered, the lyase activity of pol β is inhibited, but the polymerase activity of pol β can still displace the oxidized or reduced dRP residue into a 2-10-nt 5′ flap intermediate, which will then be cleaved by FEN1 and subsequently joined by LigI (4Wilson S.H. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 5Memisoglu A. Samson L. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 6Sung J.S. Demple B.

This process is known as long patch-base excision repair (LP-BER). Recent studies examining the relevance of the two different pathways in vitro predict a predominant role for short patch-BER in the cell as compared with LP-BER (8Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Because the cell undergoes constant repair of damaged bases, it is very difficult to assess the relative use of one pathway over the other in vivo. Studies using plasmid DNA containing defined DNA damage have been used as an indirect approach to evaluate the role of the two different BER pathways in cells and the size of the DNA repair patches (9Sattler U. Frit P. Salles B. Calsou P. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Results from these studies have shown that repair patches of 6-12 nucleotides are generated during repair of plasmids that contain a single base lesion, at least supporting the existence of LP-BER in vivo. LP-BER has also been proposed to proceed by either a PCNA-dependent sub-pathway involving the use of DNA pol δ/ϵ or a PCNA-independent sub-pathway that uses only DNA pol β. However, most LP-BER reconstitution experiments in vitro indicate that pol β works more efficiently than pol δ with the other proposed LP-BER proteins. FEN1 is known to stimulate pol β-mediated DNA synthesis on an LP-BER substrate suggesting that these two proteins interact functionally and mechanistically (10Liu Y. Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Prasad R. Hou E.W. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3665-3674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). pol β has also been shown to interact with LigI by co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicating that they might be a part of a multiprotein DNA repair complex (11Prasad R.

The heterotrimeric protein complex, Rad9, Rad1, and Hus1 (the 9-1-1 complex), plays a significant role in the early recognition of DNA damage and recruiting appropriate proteins to repair sites. The 9-1-1 complex interacts with several of the proteins involved in the proposed BER pathways, including DNA glycosylases (12Chang D.Y. Lu A.L. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2596-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the 9-1-1 complex was shown to interact both physically and functionally with APE1 and pol β and to stimulate their respective activities. Stimulation of the endonuclease ensures the abasic site is recognized and cleaved off efficiently. Stimulation of nucleotide addition by pol β is expected to promote the LP-BER sub-pathway, as 9-1-1 stimulates the strand displacement activity of pol β, thereby requiring FEN1 flap cleavage before ligation to repair the site of damage. Because 9-1-1 is structurally similar to the sliding clamp PCNA, early studies were focused on determining the effects of 9-1-1 on DNA replication and repair proteins previously shown to be stimulated by PCNA. The 9-1-1 complex has been reported to stimulate both FEN1 cleavage (17Friedrich-Heineken E. Toueille M. Tannler B. Burki C. Ferrari E. Hottiger M.O. Hubscher U. J. Mol.

However, the 9-1-1 clamp poorly stimulated FEN1 and LigI in the entire LP-BER-reconstituted system as compared with strong stimulation by 9-1-1 of individual cognate substrates (15Gembka A. Toueille M. Smirnova E. Poltz R. Ferrari E. Villani G. Hubscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2596-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The authors (15Gembka A. Toueille M. Smirnova E. Poltz R. Ferrari E. Villani G. Hubscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2596-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) suggest that FEN1 and LigI evolved to respond to stimulation by PCNA and not 9-1-1 during LP-BER. The issue with this explanation is that it does not take into consideration how LP-BER would be efficiently carried out when damage-induced p21 binds and inhibits PCNA (21Jaiswal A.S. Bloom L.B. Narayan S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5912-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To define how 9-1-1 interacts with the components of BER, we have reconstituted the entire LP-BER pathway using purified human enzymes and substrates that simulate an abasic site created after recognition and cleavage of damaged base by a glycosylase. Similar to results of Gembka et al. (15Gembka A. Toueille M. Smirnova E. Poltz R. Ferrari E. Villani G. Hubscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2596-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we observe much less stimulation of either FEN1 or LigI by 9-1-1 in the fully reconstituted system compared with 9-1-1 stimulation of FEN1 on a flap substrate or LigI on a nicked substrate alone. Our subsequent analysis of the protein-protein interactions among the various LP-BER enzymes provides insight into why the 9-1-1 clamp exhibits minimal stimulation in the reconstituted system. Moreover, our mechanistic characterization of the significant role of pol β in mediating the activities of various enzymes in the multiprotein repair complex both explains the behavior of 9-1-1 and strongly suggests the existence of the LP-BER pathway in vivo. Materials—Synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides, including those containing a tetrahydrofuran (THF) residue or the 5′-biotin conjugation, were prepared by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Radionucleotides [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]dCTP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Substrate-labeling enzymes, the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (for 3′ labeling), and polynucleotide kinase (for 5′ labeling) were from Roche Applied Science.

Oligodeoxyribonucleotides—Oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrates were designed to represent LP-BER intermediates. They have two adjacent primers annealed to a template. Oligodeoxyribonucleotide sequences are listed in Table 1. The primer sequences are listed 5′ to 3′, and the template sequences are listed 3′ to 5′ to facilitate visual alignment. A “Ø” in the nucleotide sequence represents a THF residue, and a “B” in the nucleotide sequence represents a biotin-conjugated strand. Downstream primers were labeled with 32P either at the 5′ or 3′ end as indicated in the figures. Labels were added at the 5′ end of strands by incubating them with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Labels were added at 3′ ends of strands by annealing 20 pmol of primer to 50 pmol of template having a G overhang at the 5′ end. [α-32P]dCTP was added to the 3′ end of the primer with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. Labeled primers were purified by electrophoresis and isolated from a 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gel. To anneal strands into substrates, primers were combined in annealing buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, transferred to 70 °C, and then slowly cooled to room temperature. Nicked, gapped, and 5′ flap substrates were annealed in a 1:2:4 ratio of labeled downstream primer to template to upstream primer. Substrates containing an internal THF residue were annealed in a 1:2 ratio of labeled primer to template.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide sequencesPrimerLength in ntSequenceUpstreamU1205′-CGACCGTGCCAGCCTAAAAC-3′U2195′-CGACCGTGCCAGCCTAAAA-3′U3265′-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACCA-3′U4255′-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACC-3′U5245′-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′U6225′-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACG-3′U7205′-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCA-3′DownstreamD1555′-CGACCGTGCCAGCCTAAAAØACTTGCCCGTGCCACCATCCCGACGCCACCTCCTG-3′D2355′-ØCTTGCCCGTGCCACCATCCCGACGCCACCTCCTG-3′D3365′-ØACTTGCCCGTGCCACCATCCCGACGCCACCTCCTG-3′D4285′-GCCGTCGTTTTACAACGACGTGACTGGG-3′D5355′-ACTTGCCCGTGCCACCATCCCGACGCCACCTCCTG-3′D6535′-BTTCACGCCTGTTAGTTAATTCACTGGCCGTCGTTTTACAACGACGTGACTGGG-3′TemplateT1493′-GCGGTCCCAAAAGGGTCAGTGCTGGGCAAAATGTTGCTGCACTGACCCG-5′T2563′-GCTGGCACGGTCGGATTTTGTGAACGGGCACGGTGGTAGGGCTGCGGTGGAGGACG-5′T3533′-GCTGGCACGGTCGGATTTTGACGGGCACGGTGGTAGGGCTGCGGTGGAGGACG-5′ Open table in a new tab Enzyme Assays—For analysis of DNA pol β stimulation of FEN1 and LigI, 20 μl of reaction mixtures containing the indicated quantities of enzyme and 5 fmol of 32P-radiolabeled DNA substrate were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× termination dye (90% formamide (v/v) with 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanole). Unless stated otherwise, the reaction buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm DTT, 30 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 50 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP. For the biotin-streptavidin blocking experiments, the initial reaction mixtures lacked MgCl2. The substrate was incubated with enzymes either before or after the addition of streptavidin. Streptavidin, added in a 50-fold excess over substrate, was complexed with the biotinylated substrate by placing the reaction at 37 °C for 10 min. MgCl2 was added after blocking at a concentration of 8 mm per reaction. The reaction was terminated with 2× termination dye as described above. After termination, samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and loaded onto a pre-heated denaturing (7 m urea) 15% polyacrylamide gel. Binding Assay—Purified FEN1 (1 or 2 ng) and pol β (1 or 2 ng) were allowed to bind together in a coupling buffer consisting of 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol for 2 h at 4 ° C (in a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio, as stated in Fig. 4). In some cases a 100-fold excess of BSA was added to the reaction to rule out nonspecific binding of FEN1 and DNA pol β to each other. The bound protein complexes were then added to a spin column containing the coupling gel to which the specific antibody (100 μg of either anti-FEN1 polyclonal antibody (Abcam, ab17993), anti-pol β monoclonal antibody (Abcam, ab3181), or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-25778)) was immobilized and allowed to bind overnight at 4 °C with gentle end-over mixing. Following binding to the antibody column, the proteins were released using elution buffer (ProFound co-immunoprecipitation kit, Pierce). The immunoprecipitates were separated on precast SDS-polyacrylamide gels (8-16%; Bio-Rad). Western blot analysis was performed with anti-FEN1 polyclonal antibody or anti-pol β monoclonal antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed using the protocol described in the ProFound co-immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce). Briefly 200 μg of specific antibody was immobilized on the antibody coupling gel overnight at 4 °C with gentle end-over mixing. Four mg of HeLa cell lysate was added to the spin column containing the immobilized antibody and allowed to bind for 4-5 h at 4 °C, after which the co-immunoprecipitation complex was released by elution buffer. The immunoprecipitates were separated on precast SDS-polyacrylamide gels (8-16%; Bio-Rad). Western blot analysis was performed with anti-FEN1 polyclonal antibody or anti-pol β monoclonal antibody. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Binding efficiency of pol β to different substrates was measured using EMSA. Increasing concentrations of pol β (0.01-100 fmol per reaction) were incubated with 1 fmol of various 5′-labeled substrates for 10 min on ice in a reaction buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm DTT, 30 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 5% glycerol. The reactions were loaded on pre-run 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (Invitrogen). Gels were subjected to electrophoresis for 30-45 min at 150 V. Gel Analysis—Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate, and the presented data are the average of the percentage of cleavage/ligation observed. After gel electrophoresis, the denaturing gels were transferred to Whatman filter paper, wrapped in Saran plastic, and dried on a vacuum gel drier (Savant, Bio-Rad). Dried gels were then exposed to a phosphor screen and analyzed by PhosphorImaging (GE Healthcare). Scanned images were analyzed by using ImageQuant version 5.0 software. Dissociation Constant (Kd) Measurements—After gel shift analysis, curves were fit using nonlinear least squares regression of the hyperbolic Equation 1,y=Bmax×[protein]/(Kd+[protein])(Eq. 1) where y is the percent of oligonucleotide bound; [protein] is the concentration of protein in nanomolar; Bmax is the maximum binding, and Kd is the equilibrium constant. Reconstitution of LP-BER—To examine the interactions of the 9-1-1 DNA clamp with other proteins involved in LP-BER, we used a 56-nt duplex DNA substrate containing an internal THF residue to reconstitute LP-BER in vitro. Fig. 1A shows the activity of APE1, pol β, FEN1, and LigI on the substrate. Fig. 1A, lane 1, derives from a solution containing 5 fmol of the THF substrate alone. In Fig. 1A, the designations SM and RP signify that the starting material (SM) substrate and the repaired product (RP) migrate to the same position. Fig. 1A, lane 2, derives from a reaction in which the THF substrate was incubated with 3 fmol of APE1, resulting in virtually 100% cleavage. The incised product is denoted by IP in Fig. 1. Fig. 1A, lane 3, represents a reaction with 20 fmol of pol β in addition to APE1. The downstream primer may have been displaced, but because it was not cleaved, it migrated to the same position as in Fig. 1A, lane 2. For Fig. 1A, lane 4, the reaction contained 1 fmol of FEN1 in addition to pol β and APE1. Strand displacement synthesis of the cleaved primer by pol β formed flap substrates that were cleaved by FEN1 and appear as a ladder of smaller products below the incision product of APE1 cleavage. Fig. 1A, lanes 5-7, show regeneration of the full-length repaired product upon addition of increasing amounts LigI. LigI has very low activity on a 5′-THF nick substrate (data not shown and Ref. 27Ranalli T.A. Tom S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41715-41724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), so the full-length product should not have resulted from ligation of the APE1 cleavage product. To prove that the full-length product generated in Fig. 1A, lanes 5-7, was fully repaired, we incubated the LP-BER enzymes with a THF-substrate containing a PstI restriction endonuclease site centered on the THF lesion. When the THF site is present, PstI cannot cleave. When the THF has been replaced with the correct nucleotide, the substrate is cleaved, giving a product distinct from the APE1 cleavage product. When this substrate was incubated with APE1, pol β, FEN1, and LigI and then exposed to PstI, all of the product was cleaved, indicating that the product was fully repaired duplex DNA (data not shown). After determining the optimum concentrations of enzymes required to efficiently repair the pre-made LP-BER substrate, we limited the FEN1 or LigI concentration in a fully reconstituted system, which diminished repair efficiency. Purified 9-1-1 complex was then added to determine whether it could stimulate FEN1 or LigI to restore efficiency (Fig. 1B). Gembka et al. (15Gembka A. Toueille M. Smirnova E. Poltz R. Ferrari E. Villani G. Hubscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2596-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) had previously reported that the 9-1-1 complex did not significantly stimulate FEN1 and LigI activities when present as a part of the fully reconstituted system. This contrasted with high level stimulation observed when the enzymes were tested in isolation on cognate substrates. Similar to observations by Gembka et al. (15Gembka A. Toueille M. Smirnova E. Poltz R. Ferrari E. Villani G. Hubscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2596-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), on using limiting concentrations of either FEN1 or LigI, we saw only a 1.5-2-fold stimulation of full-length product formation (Fig. 1B, lanes 4, 5, 7, and 8). Altering buffer conditions, reaction times, or enzyme concentrations did not increase the ability of 9-1-1 to stimulate the latter steps of LP-BER. A reaction mixture containing optimum amounts of FEN1 and LigI (Fig. 1B, lane 9) showed robust repair, proving that stimulation of these two enzyme components by 9-1-1 would have greatly improved overall repair efficiency. pol β Stimulates FEN1 Cleavage on a Variety of Substrates—There could be two possible scenarios whereby 9-1-1 is unable to significantly stimulate the activities of FEN1 and LigI in a fully reconstituted system. First, there are other proteins in the multienzyme repair complex that strongly stimulate FEN1 and LigI, such that further stimulation by 9-1-1 is not possible. In such a situation, the activities of FEN1 and LigI have achieved a maximum, such that presence of any additional stimulatory factor can have no effect. Second, in the fully reconstituted system, another repair protein disrupts the interaction between 9-1-1 and FEN1 or LigI. This might occur because of steric interference between proteins attempting to bind at the upstream-downstream primer junction or because of competition between 9-1-1 and a second enzyme for binding to FEN1 or LigI. Exploring these possibilities, we discovered that pol β stimulates flap cleavage by FEN1. The substrate employed was a 5-nt nick-flap with a completely annealed upstream primer that reaches to the base of the flap (Fig. 2A). The 9-1-1 clamp stimulated FEN1 on this nick-flap substrate about 9-fold (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5). In the absence of 9-1-1, pol β produced a 12-fold stimulation of flap cleavage (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7).FIGURE 2pol β stimulates FEN1 cleavage on a variety of substrates. Reactions were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” either in the presence (A) or absence (B) of dNTPs. All lanes represent reactions containing 5 fmol of 5-nt nick-flap substrate, which was generated by annealing primers D4, T1, and U4 in a 1:2:4 ratio (depicted in the figure). There are no missing nucleotides between the 3′ end of the upstream primer and base of the flap. The asterisk indicates the location of the radiolabel. Lane 1 in each panel (A and B) contains only substrate, and the lone band marks its migration. Lane 2 derives from a reaction containing substrate plus 20 fmol of pol β. In lanes 3-9 the reaction also contained 1 fmol of FEN1. The two quantities of 9-1-1 used were 250 and 500 fmol. + in the 9-1-1 row signifies the presence of 500 fmol of 9-1-1. The two quantities of pol β used were 10 and 20 fmol. C, cleavage by FEN1 (1 fmol) was assayed in the presence of increasing amounts of wild-type pol β (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 fmol) in the presence of dNTPs. The 5-nt nick-flap (D4:T1:U4) (filled squares), 5-nt double flap (D4:T1:U3) (filled triangles), and the 3-nt nick THF flap (D2:T3:U1) (filled circles) are depicted in the graph. Addition of dCTP to the reaction buffer containing the 5-nt nick-flap is graphically represented by the open squares, and addition of dTTP to the reaction buffer containing the 3-nt nick THF-flap is represented by the open circles. The inset in the graph represents reactions containing 5 fmol of the double flap substrate, in the presence of 50 amol per reaction of FEN1, and increasing concentrations of pol β (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 fmol), open triangles. D, cleavage by FEN1 (1 fmol) was assayed in the presence of increasing amounts of polymerase-defective/5′-dRP lyase-active D256A pol β mutant (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 fmol) in the presence of dNTPs. Graphical representations are identical to those described in C. E, FEN1 cleavage (75 amol) was assayed in the presence of either 20 fmol of pol β or 500 fmol of 9-1-1 using the 5-nt nick-flap, 5-nt double flap, or the 3-nt THF-flap substrate. In experiments graphically represented by the black bar, 75 amol of FEN1 and 20 fmol of pol β were preincubated at 37 °C with the specific substrates for 2 min, followed by addition of 500 fmol of 9-1-1, which was further incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Error bars indicate the standard deviation from a minimum of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To address whether pol β stimulation of FEN1 is synthesis-dependent, we performed a FEN1 cleavage reaction on the same 5-nt nick-flap substrate with pol β but in the absence of dNTPs (Fig. 2B). A control experiment containing a synthesis-competent substrate and high levels of pol β in the absence of dNTPs showed no synthesis (data not shown). In the absence of synthesis and strand displacement activity, pol β stimulated FEN1 cleavage nearly 8-fold (Fig. 2B, lanes 6 and 7). In the presence of 9-1-1 and pol β, FEN1 cleavage activity was stimulated to about 11-fold (Fig. 2B, lanes 8 and 9). Evidently, synthesis adds an additional increment to a substantial basal level of stimulation. The link with synthesis was unexpected because the initial 5-nt flap configuration was already a substrate for FEN1. A possible explanation for the improved cleavage is that strand displacement by pol β should produce a 1-nt 3′ ta"
https://openalex.org/W2161395384,"Retroposition and retrogenes gain increasing attention as recent studies show that they play an important role in human new gene formation. Here we examined the patterns of retrogene distribution in 8 mammalian genomes using 4 non-mammalian genomes as a contrast. There has been a burst of young retrogenes not only in primate lineages as suggested in a recent study, but also in other mammalian lineages. In mammals, most of the retrofamilies (the gene families that have retrogenes) are shared between species. In these shared retrofamilies, 14%–18% of functional retrogenes may have originated independently in multiple mammalian species. Notably, in the independently originated retrogenes, there is an enrichment of ribosome related gene function. In sharp contrast, none of these patterns hold in non-mammals. Our results suggest that the recruitment of the specific L1 retrotransposons in mammals might have been an important evolutionary event for the split of mammals and non-mammals and retroposition continues to be an important active process in shaping the dynamics of mammalian genomes, as compared to being rather inert in non-mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1970145565,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is accompanied by dysfunctions in a variety of cognitive processes. One of these is error processing, which depends upon phasic decreases of medial prefrontal dopaminergic activity. Until now, there is no study evaluating these processes in newly diagnosed, untreated patients with PD (""de novo PD"").Here we report large changes in performance monitoring processes using event-related potentials (ERPs) in de novo PD-patients. The results suggest that increases in medial frontal dopaminergic activity after an error (Ne) are decreased, relative to age-matched controls. In contrast, neurophysiological processes reflecting general motor response monitoring (Nc) are enhanced in de novo patients.It may be hypothesized that the Nc-increase is at costs of dopaminergic activity after an error; on a functional level errors may not always be detected and correct responses sometimes be misinterpreted as errors. This pattern differs from studies examining patients with a longer history of PD and may reflect compensatory processes, frequently occurring in pre-manifest stages of PD. From a clinical point of view the clearly attenuated Ne in the de novo PD patients may prove a useful additional tool for the early diagnosis of basal ganglia dysfunction in PD."
https://openalex.org/W2001315403,"Cervical cancer is frequently associated with HPV infection. The expression of E6 and E7 HPV oncoproteins is a key factor in its carcinogenicity and might also influence its virulence, including metastatic conversion. The cellular mechanisms involved in metastatic spread remain elusive, but pro-adhesive receptors and their ligands, such as SDF-1alpha and CXCR4 are implicated. In the present study, we assessed the possible relationship between SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 signaling, E6/E7 status and the metastatic process. We found that SDF-1alpha stimulated the invasion of E6/E7-positive cancer cell lines (HeLa and TC-1) in Matrigel though CXCR4 and subsequent Rho/ROCK activation. In pulmonary metastatic foci generated by TC-1 cells IV injection a high proportion of cells expressed membrane-associated CXCR4. In both cases models (in vitro and in vivo) cell adhesion and invasion was abrogated by CXCR4 immunological blockade supporting a contribution of SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 to the metastatic process. E6 and E7 silencing using stable knock-down and the approved anti-viral agent, Cidofovir decreased CXCR4 gene expression as well as both, constitutive and SDF-1alpha-induced cell invasion. In addition, Cidofovir inhibited lung metastasis (both adhesion and invasion) supporting contribution of E6 and E7 oncoproteins to the metastatic process. Finally, potential signals activated downstream SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 and involved in lung homing of E6/E7-expressing tumor cells were investigated. The contribution of the Rho/ROCK pathway was suggested by the inhibitory effect triggered by Cidofovir and further confirmed using Y-27632 (a small molecule ROCK inhibitor). These data suggest a novel and highly translatable therapeutic approach to cervix cancer, by inhibition of adhesion and invasion of circulating HPV-positive tumor cells, using Cidofovir and/or ROCK inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2072500972,"In performing arts, body postures are both means for expressing an artist's intentions, and also artistic objects, appealing to the audience. The postures of classical ballet obey the body's biomechanical limits, but also follow strict rules established by tradition. This combination offers a perfect milieu for assessing scientifically how the execution of this particular artistic activity has changed over time, and evaluating what factors may induce such changes. We quantified angles between body segments in archive material showing dancers from a leading company over a 60-year period. The data showed that body positions supposedly fixed by codified choreography were in fact implemented by very different elevation angles, according to the year of ballet production. Progressive changes lead to increasingly vertical positions of the dancer's body over the period studied. Experimental data showed that these change reflected aesthetic choices of naïve modern observers. Even when reduced to stick figures and unrecognisable shapes, the more vertical postures drawn from later productions were systematically preferred to less vertical postures from earlier productions. This gradual change within a conservative art form provides scientific evidence that aesthetic change may arise from continuous interaction between artistic tradition, individual artists' creativity, and a wider environmental context. This context may include social aesthetic pressure from audiences."
https://openalex.org/W2091211501,"NKG2D is an important activating receptor for triggering the NK cell cytotoxic activity, although chronic engagement of specific ligands by NKG2D is also known to provoke decreased cell surface expression of the receptor and compromised NK cell function. We have studied the dynamics of surface NKG2D expression and how exposure to the specific ligand major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related molecule B (MICB) affects receptor traffic and fate. While in the NKL cell line and ""resting"" NK cells NKG2D was found principally at the cell surface, in activated primary NK cells an intracellular pool of receptor could also be found recycling to the plasma membrane. Exposure of NK cells to targets expressing MICB resulted in degradation of approximately 50% of total NKG2D protein and lysosomal degradation of the DAP10 adaptor molecule. Consistent with these observations, confocal microscopy experiments demonstrated that DAP10 trafficked to secretory lysosomes in both transfected NKL cells and in activated primary NK cells upon interaction with MICB-expressing target cells. Interestingly, polarization to the synapse of secretory lysosomes containing DAP10 was also observed. The implications of the intracellular traffic of the NKG2D/DAP10 receptor complex for NK cell activation are discussed. We propose that the rapid degradation of NKG2D/DAP10 observed coincident with recruitment of the receptor to the cytotoxic immune synapse may explain the loss of NKG2D receptor expression after chronic exposure to NKG2D ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2166218666,"The intracellular protozoan parasite Theileria parva transforms bovine lymphocytes inducing uncontrolled proliferation. Proteins released from the parasite are assumed to contribute to phenotypic changes of the host cell and parasite persistence. With 85 members, genes encoding subtelomeric variable secreted proteins (SVSPs) form the largest gene family in T. parva. The majority of SVSPs contain predicted signal peptides, suggesting secretion into the host cell cytoplasm.We analysed SVSP expression in T. parva-transformed cell lines established in vitro by infection of T or B lymphocytes with cloned T. parva parasites. Microarray and quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed mRNA expression for a wide range of SVSP genes. The pattern of mRNA expression was largely defined by the parasite genotype and not by host background or cell type, and found to be relatively stable in vitro over a period of two months. Interestingly, immunofluorescence analysis carried out on cell lines established from a cloned parasite showed that expression of a single SVSP encoded by TP03_0882 is limited to only a small percentage of parasites. Epitope-tagged TP03_0882 expressed in mammalian cells was found to translocate into the nucleus, a process that could be attributed to two different nuclear localisation signals.Our analysis reveals a complex pattern of Theileria SVSP mRNA expression, which depends on the parasite genotype. Whereas in cell lines established from a cloned parasite transcripts can be found corresponding to a wide range of SVSP genes, only a minority of parasites appear to express a particular SVSP protein. The fact that a number of SVSPs contain functional nuclear localisation signals suggests that proteins released from the parasite could contribute to phenotypic changes of the host cell. This initial characterisation will facilitate future studies on the regulation of SVSP gene expression and the potential biological role of these enigmatic proteins."

Here, we show that a surface-exposed cationic region in the CBS module domain is critical for ion sensing. The consecutive substitution of up to five cationic residues led to a gradual decrease of the ionic strength dependence of transport. In fact, a 5-fold mutant was essentially independent of salt in the range from 0 to 250 mm KCl (or NaCl), supplemented to medium of 30 mm potassium phosphate. Importantly, the threshold temperature for transport was lowered by 5–7 °C and the temperature coefficient Q10 was lowered from 8 to ∼1.5 in the 5-fold mutant, indicating that large conformational changes are accompanying the CBS-mediated regulation of transport. Furthermore, by replacing the anionic C-terminal tail residues that extend the CBS module with histidines, the transport of OpuA became pH-dependent, presumably by additional charge interactions of the histidine residues with the membrane. The pH dependence was not observed at high ionic strength. Altogether the analyses of the CBS mutants support the notion that the osmotic regulation of OpuA involves a simple biophysical switching mechanism, in which nonspecific electrostatic interactions of a protein module with the membrane are sufficient to lock the transporter in the inactive state.

https://openalex.org/W1996338185,"The neuronal damage characteristic of HIV-1-mediated CNS diseases is inflicted by HIV-1 infected brain macrophages. Several steps of viral replication, including assembly and budding, differ between macrophages and T cells; it is likely that cell-specific host factors mediate these differences. We previously defined Annexin 2 (Anx2) as an HIV Gag binding partner in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) that promotes proper viral assembly. Anx2, a calcium-dependent membrane-binding protein that can aggregate phospholipid-containing lipid rafts, is expressed to high levels in macrophages, but not in T lymphocytes or the 293T cell line. Here, we use bimolecular fluorescence complementation in the 293T cell model to demonstrate that Anx2 and HIV-1 Gag interact at the phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate-containing lipid raft membrane domains at which Gag mediates viral assembly. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Anx2 expression in 293T cells increases Gag processing and HIV-1 production. These data provide new evidence that Anx2, by interacting with Gag at the membranes that support viral assembly, functions in the late stages of HIV-1 replication."

However, the pathway and regulative mechanism remain unknown.Here, we reported a new role for Mtmr8 in neuromuscular development of zebrafish. Firstly, we cloned and characterized zebrafish Mtmr8, and revealed the expression pattern predominantly in the eye field and somites during early somitogenesis. Using morpholino knockdown, then, we observed that loss-of-function of Mtmr8 led to defects in somitogenesis. Subsequently, the possible underlying mechanism and signal pathway were examined. We first checked the Akt phosphorylation, and observed an increase of Akt phosphorylation in the morphant embryos. Furthermore, we studied the PH/G domain function within Mtmr8. Although the PH/G domain deletion by itself did not result in embryonic defect, addition of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 did give a defective phenotype in the PH/G deletion morphants, indicating that the PH/G domain was essential for Mtmr8's function. Moreover, we investigated the cooperation of Mtmr8 with PI3K in actin filament modeling and muscle development, and found that both Mtmr8-MO1 and Mtmr8-MO2+LY294002 led to the disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, we revealed a possible participation of Mtmr8 in the Hedgehog pathway, and cell transplantation experiments showed that Mtmr8 worked in a non-cell autonomous manner in actin modeling.The above data indicate that a conserved functional cooperation of Mtmr8 with PI3K regulates actin filament modeling and muscle development in zebrafish, and reveal a possible participation of Mtmr8 in the Hedgehog pathway. Therefore, this work provides a new clue to study the physiological function of MTM family members."

The major substrate of NPP2 is lysophosphatidylcholine, which is converted into choline and lysophosphatidic acid.

The metastasis-enhancing properties of NPP2 have been attributed to its ability to promote the invasive properties of cancer cells and to stimulate angiogenesis. Importantly, NPP2 is highly expressed by various cancers including breast carcinoma (7Yang S.Y. Lee J. Park C.G. Kim S. Hong S. Chung H.C. Min S.K. Han J.W. Lee H.W. Lee H.Y. Clin. Exp.

Therefore, NPP2 is considered to be an attractive target for a novel anticancer therapy, in particular because it acts extracellularly, and interfering drugs thus do not need to be cell-permeable (10Federico L. Pamuklar Z. Smyth S. Morris A. Curr. Drug Targets. 2008; 8: 698-708Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). NPP2 is one of the seven mammalian members of the NPP-type family of ectophosphodiesterases, belonging to the superfamily of phospho-/sulfo-coordinating metalloenzymes (11Stefan C. Jansen S. Bollen M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 542-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). These enzymes all have a structurally related catalytic domain and the same catalytic mechanism but show a different substrate specificity. For example, NPP1 only recognizes nucleotide substrates, whereas NPP2 preferentially hydrolyzes lysophospholipids. Interestingly, NPP1–3 share a C-terminal non-catalytic domain, commonly referred to as the nuclease-like domain (NLD) (12Gijsbers R. Ceulemans H. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The latter is related to DNA/RNA-nonspecific endonucleases but lacks key residues that are necessary for activity and is therefore believed to have a structural or regulatory role. It is not known whether the NLD acts as a positive or negative regulator of NPP activity, but swapping experiments of the NLD between NPP1 and NPP2 suggested that it harbors isoform-specific determinants for catalysis (13Cimpean A. Stefan C. Gijsbers R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To examine the therapeutic potential of NPP2, in particular for the treatment of cancer, a number of small molecule inhibitors have been developed (14Saunders L.P. Ouellette A. Bandle R. Chang W.C.

However, these inhibitors are all directed against the catalytic site and may therefore also interfere with other phospho-/sulfo-coordinating metalloenzymes. We report here that the NLD is essential for the expression of catalytic activity and can be used as an alternative target to inhibit NPP2. NPP2 Constructs—Wild-type NPP2 (WT NPP2) was obtained by cloning rat NPP2 into the EGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). The EGFP tag at the C terminus was replaced by a c-Myc tag, and a FLAG epitope was introduced after the furin cleavage site to create an N-terminally tagged protein (16Jansen S. Stefan C. Creemers J.W. Waelkens E. Van E.A. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3081-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Deletion as well as partial reconstitution of the nuclease-like domain of NPP2 was obtained by PCR with wild-type NPP2 as template and using 3′-GTCGACGAGCAGAAGCTGATCTC-5′ as a sense primer in combination with an antisense primer starting at the residues indicated in the constructs. The last 12 amino acids of NPP2 were replaced by those of NPP1 by a PCR using 3′-ATCTTCAGCCAAGAAGACGTCGACGAGCAGAAGCTGATCTCC-5′ as a sense primer and 3′-TGGCAAATGTGTTTTCAAGGTCAGAATTTCCGAATAGCTACGG-5′ as an antisense primer. The underlined nucleotides correspond to the last 12 amino acids of NPP1. In the sense primer, these are followed by a sequence that anneals to the c-Myc affinity tag. In the antisense primer, the NPP1 nucleotides are preceded by base pairs coding for residues 842–850 of NPP2. These primers enable reading over the last 12 amino acids of NPP2 and directly replacing them for those of NPP1. Site-directed mutagenesis of the LKT triad was performed using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene). The same strategy was used for mutation of the Cys residues in the catalytic and the nuclease-like domain as well as introduction of the tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site. All constructs were verified by sequencing. The sequence of all primer sets used is available upon request. Cell Culture—HEK293T cells were maintained at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, glucose (4.5 g/liter), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were transiently transfected at 30–40% confluency using linear polyethyleneimine of 25 kDa (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). The medium was collected 72 h after transfection and cleared by centrifugation at 1000 g for 15 min. The cells were harvested at the same time point, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 50 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The supernatant obtained after ultracentrifugation (45 min at 100,000 g) was used as “cell lysate.” Aliquots of the cell lysates and media were used for immunoblot analysis and the assay of NPP2-associated activities. Assay of NPP2 Activities—Lysophospholipase-D activities were measured by incubating aliquots of media or cell lysates with the substrate lysophosphatidyl choline (14:0) at 37 °C in a total volume of 40 μl. Subsequently, the released choline was quantified spectrophotometrically at 540 nm after incubation for 5 min with 50 μl each of the peroxidase reagent (50 mm Tris at pH 9.0, 2 mm N-ethyl-N-(2-hydroxy-3-sulfoproryl)-3-methylaniline, 5 units/ml peroxidase, and 0.01% (v/v) of Triton X-100) and of the choline oxidase reagent (50 mm Tris at pH 9.0, 2 mm aminoantipyrine, choline oxidase (5 units/ml), and 0.01% Triton X-100) (17Jansen S. Callewaert N. Dewerte I. Andries M. Ceulemans H. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11084-11091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nucleotide phosphodiesterase activities were determined from the release of p-nitrophenolate from p-nitrophenyl thymidine 5′-monophosphate (17Jansen S. Callewaert N. Dewerte I. Andries M. Ceulemans H. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11084-11091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were incubated at 37 °C with 5 mm of the substrate, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm Tris/HCl at pH 9.0 in a total volume of 35 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 6% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid. Subsequently, the mixture was neutralized with NaOH, and p-nitrophenolate was quantified colorimetrically at 405 nm. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare), and subjected to 60 V for 2 h in 192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, and 10% methanol (pH 8.6). After blotting, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (Serva) or 5% milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20. Subsequently, membranes were incubated with anti-Myc (clone 9E10) monoclonal antibodies or anti-FLAG polyclonal antibodies (Sigma), respectively. After overnight incubation, proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase goat anti-mouse or swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako) and enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunofluorescence—HEK293 cells were seeded in 4-well chambers at a density of 30,000 cells/well. Cells were transfected using the FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). After 24 h, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice in PBS. Subsequently, the cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After several rinses in PBS, nonspecific binding was reduced by washing the cells with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 20 min. Following this blocking step, the cells were incubated with anti-Myc (clone 9E10) to visualize NPP2-(1–594) and anti-Spca (secretory pathway calcium ATPase) antibodies (kindly donated by Dr. F. Wuytack, University of Leuven, Belgium) to mark the Golgi apparatus. Expression of the autofluorescent NPP2-EGFP was monitored directly. Cells were washed again and incubated for 60 min with a secondary antibody, i.e. anti-mouse Dylight 549 (Pierce) for NPP2-(1–594) and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) to stain the Golgi. After washing in PBS, fluorescence was observed with an LSM 510 Axiovert 100M laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss). TEV Cleavage of NPP2—In a total volume of 75 μl, the NPP2 TEV mutant was incubated overnight at 30 °C with 1 unit of recombinant TEV protease (Invitrogen) in the presence of 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 5 mm citrate, 200 mm NaCl, 10 μm ZnCl2, and 20 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.4. Cleavage was analyzed by immunoblotting. Identification of the Disulfide Bridge between Cys413 and Cys805—To study the possible disulfide bridge between Cys413 and Cys805, Cys784 was mutated into Ala in an NPP2 construct with all glycosylation sites mutated, except for Asn524 (17Jansen S. Callewaert N. Dewerte I. Andries M. Ceulemans H. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11084-11091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This Myc-tagged NPP2 mutant was transiently transfected in HEK293T cells that were kept in conditioned medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. 72 h after transfection, the medium was collected, cleared by centrifugation (15 min at 1000 × g), and incubated overnight with anti-c-Myc covalently bound to CNBr-activated Sepharose. Retained proteins were eluted with 2 m NaCl in 20 mm Na2HPO4 at pH 11.0. The purity of the protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Next, 10 μg of pure protein was proteolyzed by 1 unit of sequencing-grade trypsin (Roche Applied Science) in 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, at 37 °C. Subsequently, the digested protein was subjected to an overnight incubation at 4 °C in the presence or in the absence of 150 mm DTT. The resulting mixture was loaded on a C18 pipette tip (Perfect Pure, Eppendorf) for cleanup. The eluate was evaporated and reconstituted in 1 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solution (3.5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight/time of flight analysis was executed on an ABI 4800 instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), operated in reflectron mode. The Nuclease-like Domain of NPP2 Is Required to Generate a Catalytically Active Enzyme—To explore the role of the NLD, we first examined the effect of its deletion on the synthesis, secretion, and catalytic activity of NPP2. When transiently expressed in HEK293T cells, WT NPP2 was present in both the cell lysate and the culture medium, as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). NPP2-(1–594), lacking the NLD (Fig. 1A), was also readily detected in the cell lysate but was not recovered in the culture medium (Fig. 1B). Because confocal microscopy showed a clear co-localization of both WT NPP2 and NPP2-(1–594) with the calcium ATPase Spca (Fig. 1C), a marker of the Golgi apparatus, these data suggest that the NLD harbors determinants for the transport of NPP2 from the Golgi to the extracellular space. In addition, the NLD appears to be required for the expression of catalytic activity because NPP2-(1–594) in the cell lysates did not exhibit any lysophospholipase-D (Fig. 1D) or nucleotide phosphodiesterase activities (not shown). It could be argued that NPP2-(1–594) is catalytically inactive because the NLD is required for a post-translational maturation step of the catalytic domain. Alternatively, the NLD can be an intrinsic part of the catalytic fold. To differentiate between these possibilities, we generated a catalytically active NPP2 with an N-terminal FLAG tag, a C-terminal Myc tag, and a specific cleavage site for the TEV protease (18Carrington J.C. Dougherty W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3391-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 19Kapust R.B. Tozser J. Fox J.D. Anderson D.E. Cherry S. Copeland T.D. Waugh D.S. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) introduced in the linker region between the catalytic domain and the NLD (Fig. 2A). This made it possible to examine the effect of the proteolytic removal of the NLD on the catalytic activity. It was verified that the resulting mutant, further referred to as NPP2m, was properly secreted (Fig. 2B) and displayed a normal catalytic activity (Fig. 2C). Incubation with the TEV protease did generate the expected FLAG-tagged N-terminal fragment, comprising the catalytic domain and the Myc-tagged NLD, as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 2D). However, these fragments only migrated as separate polypeptides during SDS-PAGE when the sample buffer was supplemented with DTT, indicating that the catalytic and nuclease-like domains remained covalently linked by one or more disulfide bridges following TEV proteolysis. Cleavage of NPP2m with the TEV protease did not affect its nucleotide phosphodiesterase (Fig. 2E) or lysophospholipase-D activities (not shown). However, the catalytic activity was completely lost in the presence of DTT, both before and after incubation with the TEV protease, suggesting that the activity depends on one or several disulfide bridges. Our finding that the catalytic and nuclease-like domains remained linked by (a) disulfide bond(s) following TEV cleavage precluded a clear interpretation on the role of the NLD for catalysis at this stage. The essential disulfide bridge(s) in NPP2 could be intradomain and/or interdomain bond(s). Initial evidence that they involved bonds between the catalytic and nuclease-like domains came from observations that the concentration of DTT needed to dissociate these domains after TEV-mediated proteolysis (Fig. 3A) corresponded well to the concentration that caused an inactivation of NPP2m (Fig. 3B). The same correspondence was seen at a more alkaline pH (9 versus 7.5), which increased the sensitivity to DTT about 10-fold, consistent with the higher prevalence of the reactive thiolate form of DTT at alkaline pH. Mapping of an Essential Interdomain Disulfide Bond—To identify the cysteines that are essential for the expression of catalytic activity, all 11 Cys residues in the catalytic and nuclease-like domains of NPP2m were mutated individually to Ala (Fig. 4A). Except for NPP2-C350A (not illustrated), all mutants were expressed well and could be detected in the culture medium. Analysis of the lysophospholipase-D activity of equal amounts of these Cys to Ala mutants showed that they all displayed a similar specific activity, except for C413A and C805A, which were only weakly active. Because Cys413 and Cys805 are located in the catalytic and nuclease-like domains, respectively, we hypothesized that they form an essential disulfide bridge between both domains. However, these data do not rule out the existence of additional intradomain or interdomain disulfide bridges that are, however, not essential for the expression of catalytic activity. Actually, following TEV proteolysis of the Cys to Ala mutants, including C413A and C805A, they only migrated as cleaved products in the presence of DTT, confirming the presence of at least one additional interdomain S–S bond (Fig. 4B). To obtain more direct evidence for a disulfide bond between Cys413 and Cys805, we used mass spectrometry. Initially, this analysis was hampered by the fact that Cys413 was recovered in a heavily glycosylated tryptic fragment. In addition, the tryptic fragment containing Cys805 also harbored Cys784, possibly involved in another disulfide linkage. Taken together, the hall-mark fragment for evaluation of the disulfide linkage between Cys413 and Cys805 displayed a molecular weight not amenable to reflectron MALDI-TOF/TOF. To circumvent these difficulties, we used an active NPP2 variant with mutated glycosylation sites (Asn to Ala), except for Asn524, whose glycosylation is essential to adopt an active conformation (17Jansen S. Callewaert N. Dewerte I. Andries M. Ceulemans H. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11084-11091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this glycosylation mutant, Cys784 was also converted into an Ala. Following purification and trypsinolysis under non-reducing conditions, the mass spectrum of this NPP2 variant displayed a peak of m/z 4121, corresponding to the mass of the disulfide-linked peptides (406TIIAALTCK414)-(784ADGPLSVSSFILPHRPDNDESCASSEDESK814) (Fig. 5, upper panel, right box). The identity of this species was confirmed by MS/MS (not shown), producing clear b12, b17, and b19 fragments of 784ADGPLSVSSFILPHRPDNDESCASSEDESK814. The m/z 4121 peak completely disappeared after a treatment with DTT (Fig. 5, lower panel, right box). In addition, a peak of m/z 3190, absent in the non-reduced sample and corresponding to the molecular weight of 784ADGPLSVSSFILPHRPDNDESCASSEDESK814, was detected (Fig. 5, left box). The identity of this species was confirmed by MS/MS of the m/z 3190 peak, producing b12, b17, and b19 fragments and an additional y28 fragment (not shown). The peptide harboring Cys413 was not recovered under reducing conditions, probably due to the low content of ionizable amino acids in this fragment. Collectively, these data identified a disulfide bridge between Cys413 and Cys805 that covalently anchors the catalytic and nuclease-like domains of NPP2 and that is essential for the expression of catalytic activity. Identification of an Essential Lysine in the C Terminus of the NLD—As an independent and alternative strategy to study the contribution of the NLD to the secretion and activity of NPP2, we used a stepwise rescue approach starting from the inactive, non-secreted NPP2-(1–594). C-terminal extensions of up to 139 residues, as in NPP2-(1–828), did not yield secreted proteins (Fig. 6A). This was unexpected because NPP2-(1–828) contains all the residues that are glycosylated (Asn524) or form the essential disulfide bond (Cys413 and Cys805). Because NPP2-(1–850) was recovered in the culture medium (Fig. 6A), these data therefore suggested that residues 829–850 are essential for the secretion of NPP2. Intriguingly, NPP2-(1–850) was only marginally active, both in the cell lysate (Fig. 6B) and in the medium (Fig. 6C), suggesting that the C-terminal 12 residues of NPP2, although not needed for secretion, are essential to obtain a fully active enzyme. Additional C-terminal extensions, as in NPP2-(1–853) and NPP2-(1–855), yielded fully active enzymes, hinting at an essential role for residues 851–853, comprising the triad Leu-Lys-Thr (LKT). Because the C termini of NPP1 and NPP2 are very different, except for this LKT triad (Fig. 7A), we also generated NPP2 with the C-terminal 12 residues of NPP1. This chimeric construct was secreted and fully active, providing additional evidence for an essential role of the LKT triad for catalysis. Finally, we explored the effects of mutagenesis of these three residues, either individually or combined, on the catalytic activity (Fig. 7B). The mutation of the LKT triad into AAA, SSS, or RRR yielded completely inactive NPP2 variants. Also, mutation of Lys852 into an Ala or Arg strongly reduced the catalytic activity, but the replacement of Leu851 or Thr853 by an Ala did not affect the catalytic activity. Collectively, these studies identified Lys852 as a residue that is essential for the expression of catalytic activity.FIGURE 7Identification of Lys852 as an essential residue for the expression of activity. A, alignment of the last 12 amino acids of NPP1 and NPP2. The bold underlined sequence indicates the amino acids that are conserved between both proteins. Using a deletion-insertion strategy, the last 12 amino acids of NPP2 were exchanged for those of NPP1, yielding NPP2-(C1). Equal amounts of WT NPP2 and NPP2-(C1) were estimated by immunoblotting with c-Myc antibodies. The same volumes were used to study the lysophospholipase-D activity (n = 3, mean ± S.E.). B, the residues of the LKT-triad were mutated as indicated, and the corresponding mutants in the medium (subset) were assayed for their lysophospholipase-D (LPase D) activities. The results are represented as means (n = 3) ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The introduction of a TEV cleavage site between the catalytic and nuclease-like domains of NPP2 has enabled us to show that these domains are covalently linked by at least two disulfide bonds (Figs. 2 and 4). Only one of these bridges turned out to be indispensable for the expression of catalytically active NPP2 and was unequivocally mapped by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 4) and mass spectrometry (Fig. 5) to Cys413 and Cys805. An essential covalent association between these domains was unexpected and suggests that the NLD somehow actively contributes to catalysis. Consistent with this notion, we could identify by mutagenesis studies Lys852 as a residue that is needed for enzymatic activity (Figs. 6 and 7). Remarkably, even the conservative replacement K852R resulted in a largely inactive enzyme (Fig. 7B). The exact role of the NLD in catalysis is not understood, but we speculate that this non-catalytic domain could be involved in substrate binding and/or in product release. Consistent with a role in substrate binding, Parrill et al. (20Parrill A.L. Echols U. Nguyen T. Pham T.C. Hoeglund A. Baker D.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2008; 16: 1784-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) failed to dock lysophosphatidylcholine species onto their model of the catalytic core of NPP2, suggesting that substrate-binding residues lie outside the catalytic domain. This notion is also supported by the observation that NPP2 with the NLD of NPP1 is catalytically inactive (13Cimpean A. Stefan C. Gijsbers R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that the NLDs harbor isoform-specific substrate-specifying determinants. As for a possible role of the NLD in product release, it is worthy of note that this represents the rate-limiting step of catalysis by NPPs (21Gijsbers R. Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1361-1368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the nuclease-like domain of the DNA repair protein RecC forms an aperture through which one strand of the newly split DNA is guided (22Rigden D.J. BMC. Struct. Biol. 2005; 5: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We speculate that a similar fold could guide product release in NPP2. We have also found that residues 829–850 of the NLD are involved in the secretion of NPP2 (Fig. 6). Because NPP2 without the NLD accumulates in the Golgi (Fig. 1), this suggests that the NLD harbors determinants for its secretion. In this respect, it cannot be excluded that the NLD has an indirect role and is required for a post-translational maturation step, such as glycosylation or the rearrangement of S–S bonds, that needs to be completed before NPP2 can be secreted. In conclusion, we have shown here that 1) the catalytic and nuclease-like domains of NPP2 are linked by an essential disulfide bond, 2) residues 829–850 of the NLD are necessary for the secretion of NPP2, and 3) the C-terminal Lys852 is essential for catalysis. Our study shows that the NLD domain can be targeted to generate novel inhibitors of the lysophospholipase-D activity of NPP2."

Loss of purine and pyrimidine bases is a significant source of DNA damage in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Abasic (apurinic and apyrimidinic) lesions occur spontaneously in DNA; in eukaryotes it has been estimated that about 104 depurination and 102 depyrimidation events occur per genome per day. An equally important source of abasic DNA lesions results from the action of DNA glycosylases, such as uracil glycosylase, which excises uracil arising primarily from spontaneous deamination of cytosines (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4412) Google Scholar). Although most AP sites are removed by the base excision repair (BER) 5The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; AP, abasic; pol, polymerase; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; Fen-1, Flap endonuclease 1; RP-A, replication protein A; BSA, bovine serum albumin; nt, nucleotide(s); ss, single-stranded; ds, double-stranded. pathway, a small fraction of lesions persists, and DNA with AP lesions presents a strong block to DNA synthesis by replicative DNA polymerases (DNA pols) (2Shibutani S.

Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Several studies have been performed to address the effects of AP sites on the template DNA strand on the synthetic activity of a variety of DNA pols. The major replicative enzyme of eukaryotic cells, DNA pol δ, was shown to be able to bypass an AP lesion, but only in the presence of the auxiliary factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and at a very reduced catalytic efficiency if compared with an undamaged DNA template (4Mozzherin D.J. Shibutani S. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6126-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the family X DNA pols β and λ were shown to bypass an AP site but in a very mutagenic way (5Blanca G. Villani G. Shevelev I. Ramadan K. Spadari S. Hubscher U. Maga G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11605-11615Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recent genetic evidence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells showed that DNA pol δ is the enzyme replicating the lagging strand (6Nick McElhinny S.A. Gordenin D.A. Stith C.M. Burgers P.M. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 137-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). According to the current model for Okazaki fragment synthesis (7Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 26051-26061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the action of DNA pol δ is not only critical for the extension of the newly synthesized Okazaki fragment but also for the displacement of an RNA/DNA segment of about 30 nucleotides on the pre-existing downstream Okazaki fragment to create an intermediate Flap structure that is the target for the subsequent action of the Dna2 endonuclease and the Flap endonuclease 1 (Fen-1). This process has the advantage of removing the entire RNA/DNA hybrid fragment synthesized by the DNA pol α/primase, potentially containing nucleotide misincorporations caused by the lack of a proofreading exonuclease activity of DNA pol α/primase. This results in a more accurate copy synthesized by DNA pol δ. The intrinsic strand displacement activity of DNA pol δ, in conjunction with Fen-1, PCNA, and replication protein A (RP-A), has been also proposed to be essential for the S phase-specific long patch BER pathway (10Stucki M. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Fortini P. Wilson S.H. Hubscher U. Dogliotti E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 11Pascucci B. Stucki M. Jónsson Z.O. Dogliotti E. Hübscher U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3040-3046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that an AP site on the template strand is a strong block for DNA pol δ-dependent synthesis on single-stranded DNA, the functional consequences of such a lesion on the ability of DNA pol δ to carry on strand displacement synthesis have never been investigated so far. Given the high frequency of spontaneous hydrolysis and/or cytidine deamination events, any detrimental effect of an AP site on the strand displacement activity of DNA pol δ might have important consequences both for lagging strand DNA synthesis and for long patch BER. In this work, we addressed this issue by constructing a series of synthetic gapped DNA templates with a single AP site at different positions with respect to the downstream primer to be displaced by DNA pol δ (see Fig. 1A). We show that an AP site immediately upstream of a single- to double-strand DNA junction constitutes a strong block to the strand displacement activity of DNA pol δ, even in the presence of RP-A and PCNA. Such a block could be resolved only through a “polymerase switch” involving the concerted physical and functional interaction of DNA pol β and Fen-1. The closely related DNA pol λ could only partially substitute for DNA pol β. Based on our data, we propose that stalling of a replication fork by an AP site not only is a consequence of its ability to inhibit nucleotide incorporation by the replicative DNA pols but can also stem from its effects on strand displacement during Okazaki fragment maturation. In summary, our data suggest the existence of a novel repair pathway that might be important in preventing replication fork stalling and identify a previously unnoticed deleterious effect of the AP site lesion on normal cell metabolism.

Primer Elongation Assays—For denaturing gel analysis of DNA synthesis products, the reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm dNTPs, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10–20 nm (3′-OH ends) of the 5′ 32P-labeled primer/templates. Concentrations of DNA pols λ and β, PCNA, RP-A, and Fen-1 were as indicated in the figures and figure legends. The reactions were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C (unless otherwise stated) and then stopped by the addition of standard denaturing gel loading buffer (95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue), heated at 95 °C for 3 min, and loaded on a 7 m urea, 10% polyacrylamide gel. Far Western Blot Analysis—Purified recombinant human Fen-1 (500 ng) and BSA (500 ng) were mixed with Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. All of the subsequent steps were preformed at 4 °C. The membrane was first incubated two times for 10 min in denaturing buffer (6 m guanidine hydrochloride in phosphate-buffered saline). To renature proteins the membrane was incubated in serial dilutions (1:1) of denaturing buffer and phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, up to final concentration of 93.75 mm guanidine hydrochloride. The membrane was then blocked for 1 h in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3% Tween, and 10% milk powder, followed by washing for 10 min in wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3% Tween, 0.25% milk powder, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Additionally the membrane was cut in half, followed by incubation for 2 h 30 min at 4 °C and then 30 min at room temperature, with one half in 1 μg/ml dilution of purified recombinant DNA pol β in wash buffer and the other half in wash buffer alone. The membranes were then washed four times for 10 min in wash buffer, with an exception that a second wash contained 0.0001% glutaraldehyde. From this point a conventional immunoblot analysis was performed, and the proteins were detected with the respective specific antibodies. An Abasic Site Immediately Upstream of a Double-stranded DNA Region Inhibits the Strand Displacement Activity of DNA Polymerase δ—Human DNA pol δ was tested on linear or gapped DNA templates, either undamaged or bearing a single AP site (tetrahydrofuran) at position +38 from the 3′-OH of the primer (Fig. 1A). The gapped DNA substrate was constructed so that the size of the gap was 38 nt, and the abasic site was placed at the last single-stranded (ss) template position, immediately upstream the double-stranded (ds) region. In all cases, the downstream terminator oligonucleotide was 5′-phosphorylated with cold ATP, whereas the 5′-end of the primer was radioactively labeled. As shown in Fig. 1B, with the undamaged templates, DNA pol δ was expected to be able to synthesize full-length products in a strictly PCNA-dependent manner both on the linear (lanes 1–8) and on the gapped (lanes 9–16) DNA substrates. However, on gapped DNA, pol δ was effectively slowed down by the presence of a downstream dsDNA, as shown by the accumulation of products >38 residues long (lanes 10–12 and 14–16) and by the requirement of an higher DNA pol δ concentration than with the linear template to reach full-length products (compare lanes 2–4 with lanes 10–12 and 14–16). When DNA pol δ was tested on the same templates but in the presence of an AP site, a strong accumulation of products was noted at the position corresponding to the lesion both on the linear and on the gapped DNA templates (Fig. 1C, lanes 2–4 and 6–9). However, whereas on the linear template DNA pol δ was eventually able to overcome the lesion, reaching full-length products on the gapped DNA the synthesis was abortive, with accumulation of products between +38 and +45, and no full-length synthesis, even in the presence of high PCNA concentrations (lanes 6–9), was observed. Thus, the presence of an additional block, such as an AP site, immediately upstream of a dsDNA region was able to prevent strand displacement by DNA pol δ. PCNA Promotes Efficient Bypass of an Abasic Site by DNA Polymerase β on Linear but Not on Gapped DNA Templates— Next, human DNA pol β was tested on the same templates. As shown in Fig. 2A, the ability of DNA pol β to synthesize full-length products on the linear (lanes 1–3) or gapped (lanes 7–9) undamaged templates increased as a function of enzyme concentration, according to the well known distributive mode of DNA synthesis by DNA pol β. DNA pol β was able to bypass an AP site both on linear (lanes 4–6) or gapped (lanes 10–12) DNA templates but with abortive synthesis of products slightly longer than +38, even at the highest concentration tested, suggesting that the lesion significantly increased the distributive DNA synthesis. DNA pol β has been reported to physically interact with PCNA, even though no functional role for this interaction has been shown so far. Thus, increasing amounts of PCNA were titrated in the reaction in the presence of low amounts of DNA pol β on both the linear and gapped DNA templates bearing an AP site. As shown in Fig. 2B, PCNA promoted the synthesis of full-length products past the lesion, but only on the linear template (lanes 1-5). If the mechanism of termination at the AP site was an increased dissociation rate of the enzyme from the DNA template, the bypass efficiency should be also influenced by the incubation time. To test this, a time course experiment was performed in the presence of fixed amounts of DNA pol β and PCNA, starting from 10 min (the same incubation time of the experiments shown in Fig. 2B) and up to 40 min. As shown in Fig. 2C, the amount of full-length products synthesized by DNA pol β increased with time (lanes 2–5). PCNA was essential for the stimulation of DNA synthesis, because in its absence no full-length products accumulated, even after 40 min (lanes 6 and 7). Thus, PCNA appears to be a stimulatory factor for DNA pol β bypass of an AP site. This is the first report of a functional interaction between these two proteins. However, no full-length synthesis could be detected on gapped DNA even with long incubation times (data not shown), suggesting that, similar to what has been observed with DNA pol δ (Fig. 1B), the presence of an AP site immediately upstream of a dsDNA region constitutes a strong block also to DNA pol β activity. The Presence of a Double-stranded DNA Region Upstream of an Abasic Site Facilitates Bypass by DNA Polymerase δ but Not β— Next, we investigated whether the position of the AP site relative to the dsDNA region might influence the ability of DNA pol δ to overcome the lesion. To this aim, a gapped substrate was constructed, where the AP site was placed 3 nt within the dsDNA, resulting in a ssDNA gap of 35 nt. As shown in Fig. 3A, DNA pol δ was able to fully displace the downstream terminator oligonucleotide, synthesizing full-length products (lanes 2–5). The addition of the ssDNA-binding protein RP-A further promoted full-length DNA synthesis (lanes 6–9). When DNA pol β was tested under the same conditions (Fig. 3B), however, no full-length synthesis was detected, irrespective of the presence or RP-A alone (lanes 9–12) or in combination with PCNA (lanes 17–20). Thus, the position of the AP lesion on gapped DNA substrates relative to the 5′-dsDNA region is important for DNA pol δ but not for DNA pol β. It has been suggested that DNA pol β interacts with a gapped DNA differently from DNA pol δ, by contacting first the 5′-downstream end of the gap (17Beard W.A. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 91-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This different binding mode between DNA pols β and δ might explain the observed differences. Fen-1 Inhibits the Synthesis of Products beyond the Abasic Site by DNA Polymerase δ but Is Essential for Efficient Strand Displacement-dependent Bypass of the Abasic Site by DNA Polymerase β—When the AP site is placed 3 nt within the dsDNA, both DNA pol δ and β would generate a short (3-nt) DNA Flap before encountering the AP site. In eukaryotic cells the endonuclease Fen-1 can specifically bind and cut Flap DNA structures. When Fen-1 was added in the reaction together with DNA pol δ, a strong reduction of DNA synthesis was observed (Fig. 3A), irrespective of the absence (lanes 10–13) or presence (lanes 14–17) of a fixed amount of RP-A. Because RP-A was able to promote full-length synthesis by DNA pol δ on this template (Fig. 3A, lanes 6–9), increasing amounts of RP-A were titrated into the reaction. As shown in Fig. 3B, in the absence of Fen-1, RP-A effectively promoted synthesis by DNA pol δ in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 1–4). However, the addition of Fen-1 (lanes 5–8) resulted in strong inhibition of DNA synthesis. Inhibition of DNA pol δ synthetic activity by Fen-1 on linear templates has been reported. However, on this gapped template, at the highest RP-A concentration, Fen-1 addition caused a strong reduction of bypass products (i.e. those of >38 residues, arising from strand displacement synthesis), whereas the amount of shorter products (i.e. those of <38 residues, synthesized during the gap filling step) was almost unaffected (compare lane 1 with lane 5), suggesting a mechanistic relationship between strand displacement by DNA pol δ and Fen-1 inhibition. DNA pol β was unable to overcome the block imposed by an AP site on gapped DNA, resulting in abortive synthesis of short bypass products even in the presence of PCNA and RP-A (Figs. 2B and 3B). However, when Fen-1 was added into the reaction, efficient bypass of the AP site was achieved and resulted in the accumulation of full-length products, irrespective of whether PCNA and RP-A were absent (Fig. 3B, lanes 13–16) or present (lanes 21–24). When similar experiments were repeated in the presence of increasing salt concentrations, a stimulatory effect of PCNA on the strand displacement activity of DNA pol β on the 38-nt Gap AP template could be observed even in the presence of Fen-1, suggesting that both proteins were required for lesion bypass under physiological salt conditions (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, Fen-1 and PCNA appear to be necessary to promote efficient strand displacement-dependent AP site bypass by DNA pol β. The Effect of Fen-1 on the Abasic Site Bypass by DNA Polymerases δ and β Is Not Dependent on the Position of the Lesion— Next, the influence of Fen-1 on the ability of DNA pol δ or β to bypass an AP site was tested on a gapped substrate where the AP site was placed 1 nt within the 5′-ds region, resulting in a ssDNA gap of 37 nt. On this template, an incoming DNA pol has to displace only 1 nt to face the AP site on the template. As shown in Fig. 4A, DNA pol δ was able to bypass the lesion by extending the products up to the full length (lanes 2 and 3). However, the addition of Fen-1 caused a strong reduction of the bypass products (lanes 4 and 5), suggesting that a 1-nt Flap was already sufficient to activate the inhibitory mechanism by Fen-1. RP-A did not show any effect on this reaction (compare lanes 2 and 4 with lanes 3 and 5). When these experiments were repeated with DNA pol β, extension of products beyond the lesion was observed again only in the presence of Fen-1 (compare lanes 7 and 8 with lanes 9 and 10) and RP-A stimulated the reaction (compare lane 9 with lane 10). However, the overall efficiency of Fen-1 stimulation was lower than with the 35-nt gapped DNA template (compare Fig. 4A with Fig. 3B). The experiments shown in Fig. 4A were incubated for 10 min. Increasing the incubation time up to 20 min (Fig. 4B) resulted in higher accumulation of full-length products by DNA pol β but always in a strictly Fen-1-dependent manner (compare lanes 1–4 with lanes 5–8). Thus, the effects of Fen-1 on either DNA pol δ or β were not influenced by the length of the Flap generated during strand displacement-dependent bypass of the AP site. Fen-1 Can Promote Strand Displacement-dependent Bypass of an Abasic Site Immediately Upstream of a Double-stranded DNA Region by DNA Polymerase β but Not by δ—As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the presence of an AP site immediately upstream of the 5′-dsDNA tract on a gapped template (38-nt Gap) constituted a strong block to strand displacement by both DNA pol δ and β. When increasing amounts of Fen-1 were titrated on this template in the presence of DNA pol δ, PCNA, and RP-A, (Fig. 4C), inhibition rather than stimulation of synthesis past the lesion was observed (lanes 5–8). In contrast, in the presence of DNA pol β, Fen-1 promoted efficient strand displacement beyond the lesion, with generation of full-length products (lanes 13–16). The effects of Fen-1 were also dependent on the presence of the lesion. In fact, on the undamaged 38-nt gapped template, no inhibition by Fen-1 of DNA pol δ was observed (Fig. 4C, lanes 1–4). On the contrary, Fen-1 facilitated strand displacement by both DNA pol δ and β, as shown by the reduction in the pausing sites corresponding to the first strand displacement events (Fig. 4C, compare lane 1 with lane 4 and lane 9 with lane 12; pausing sites are marked with asterisks at positions 38–42). Fen-1 Can Act on Abasic Site Bypass by DNA Polymerases δ and β Either at the Incorporation or Elongation Steps—The data presented above show that Fen-1 can differentially influence the activities of DNA pol δ and β while they attempt to bypass an AP site during strand displacement DNA synthesis. However, a question still remains as to whether this action occurs at the level of incorporation or elongation. To verify this, Fen-1 was tested in the presence of either DNA pol δ or β on two different templates, mimicking the reaction intermediates generated during gap filling before and after incorporation opposite the lesion. To this aim, in a first construct a 30-mer primer was annealed to the template strand, which terminates immediately upstream of the lesion, together with a 5′-phosphorylated terminator oligonucleotide that was annealed immediately downstream the AP site. This generated a 1-nt gapped DNA, with the AP site as the only ssDNA template residue, mimicking the reaction intermediate at the pre-incorporation step. In a second construct, a 31-mer primer was used that annealed opposite the lesion. This, together with the downstream terminator oligonucleotide, generated a nicked DNA, with an A residue base-paired to the AP site, thus mimicking the most frequent post-incorporation product generated by AP site bypass. As shown in Fig. 5A, the nicked DNA was a poor substrate for DNA pol δ, which incorporated one nucleotide only when PCNA and RP-A were present (lanes 2 and 3) but not in their absence (lane 1). The addition of Fen-1, however, completely abolished nucleotide incorporation by DNA pol δ even in the presence of PCNA and RP-A (lane 4). On the opposite, DNA pol β efficiently incorporated one nucleotide on this substrate, either in the absence (lane 5) or in the presence of PCNA and RP-A (lanes 6 and 7). The addition of Fen-1 greatly stimulated strand displacement-coupled DNA synthesis by DNA pol β, allowing the incorporation of several nucleotides (lane 8). With the 1-nt gapped DNA substrate (Fig. 5B), DNA pol δ could efficiently fill the gap opposite the AP site even in the absence of PCNA and RP-A (lane 1). The addition of PCNA and RP-A allowed limited strand displacement activity, resulting in the incorporation of additional two nucleotides (lanes 2 and 3). Again, the addition of Fen-1 completely abolished strand displacement by DNA pol δ, resulting in the accumulation of +1 product only, even in the presence of PCNA and RP-A (lane 4). DNA pol β, as expected, was able to efficiently fill the gap and also to perform limited strand displacement, generating +2 products (lane 5). PCNA and RP-A further stimulated its activity, allowing +3 products to be synthesized (lanes 6 and 7). However, the addition of Fen-1 dramatically increased the strand displacement-dependent DNA synthesis by DNA pol β, with the generation of long elongation products (lane 8). Next, higher amounts of DNA pol δ (Fig. 5C) or β (Fig. 5D) were incubated on both substrates, in the presence of PCNA and RP-A, and in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of Fen-1. Under these conditions, in the absence of Fen-1, DNA pol δ showed limited strand displacement activity on both the nicked (lane 1) or the 1-nt gapped (Fig. 5C, lane 5) templates. The addition of Fen-1 caused a clear reduction of the strand displacement products (lanes 2–4 and 5–8). DNA pol β in the absence of Fen-1 also showed on both substrates limited strand displacement activity (Fig. 5D, lanes 1 and 6), which was, however, dramatically stimulated by Fen-1 in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 2–5 and 7–10). Thus, Fen-1 was able to inhibit DNA pol δ and to stimulate DNA pol β, during AP site bypass, both at the incorporation and elongation steps. DNA Polymerase β Physically Interacts with Fen-1—It has been shown that both DNA pol β and Fen-1 interact with PCNA. To verify whether they also interact with each other, a Far Western blot analysis was performed. Fen-1 was immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane, and after in situ renaturation, the membrane was incubated with a solution of 1 μg/ml DNA pol β. Development of the membrane with anti-DNA pol β antibodies revealed the presence of DNA pol β on the membrane in correspondence of the signal of Fen-1 (lane 1). Replacement of Fen-1 with the same amount of BSA (lane 2) or omission of DNA pol β from the incubation buffer (lane 3) abolished the signal of DNA pol β, suggesting that Fen-1 and DNA pol β can physically interact. DNA Polymerase λ Cooperates Less Efficiently with Fen-1 in Abasic Site Bypass than DNA Polymerase β—DNA pol λ is another family X enzyme closely related to DNA pol β. As shown in supplemental Fig. S2 A, on both linear and gapped DNA substrates, DNA pol λ was able to synthesize full-length products in the absence (lanes 1–3 and 7–9) but not in the presence (lanes 4–6 and 10–12) of an AP site. Comparison with DNA pol β (Fig. 2A) also showed that DNA pol λ was generally less efficient on all the substrates tested (supplemental Fig. S2). Next, DNA pol λ was tested on undamaged or AP-containing 38-nt gapped DNA substrates in the absence or in the presence of Fen-1 and PCNA. As shown in supplemental Fig. S2, Fen-1 promoted strand displacement-coupled DNA synthesis on undamaged DNA (compare lane 1 with lanes 2–4). The addition of PCNA (lanes 8–11) further promoted strand displacement, leading to full-length products synthesis (compare lane 8 with lanes 9–11). In the presence of an AP site, however, DNA pol λ was stalled at the lesion (lanes 5 and 12), and Fen-1 could only promote very limited strand displacement synthesis beyond the AP site (lanes 6 and 7). The addition of PCNA enhanced the effect of Fen-1 (lanes 12–15) but did not increase the size of the elongation products made by strand displacement. Thus, DNA pol λ could cooperate with Fen-1 and PCNA in AP site bypass on gapped DNA substrates but with lower efficiency than DNA pol β (compare supplemental Fig. S2 with Fig. 4C). In eukaryotes, little is known on how DNA lesions differentially affect leading versus lagging strand replication and whether and how they are differentially handled during the lesion bypass (3Higuchi K. Katayama T. Iwai S. Hidaka M. Horiuchi T. Maki H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18Nikolaishvili-Feinberg N. Cordeiro-Stone M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15215-15223Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 19Cordeiro-Stone M. Nikolaishvili-Feinberg N. Mutat. Res. 2002; 510: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The effects of blocking lesions such as AP sites have been always viewed as the consequence of the inability of replicative DNA pols to perform translesion synthesis because of a dramatic drop of either the incorporation or the elongation rates when attempting to copy AP sites. This is certainly true in the case of leading strand replication. However, in the case of lagging strand synthesis, where about 2.5 × 107 Okazaki fragments have to be correctly replicated, the situation is much more complex (Fig. 6). The current model predicts that, after the synthesis of an RNA/DNA hybrid fragment of about 30 nt by DNA pol α/primase, DNA pol δ gets in and proceeds to synthesize the remaining 100–120 nt of a typical Okazaki fragment. When the 5′-end of the downstream fragment is reached, DNA pol δ initiates strand displacement DNA synthesis, removing the RNA/DNA hybrid synthesized by DNA pol α/primase. If an AP site is encountered by DNA pol α/primase, Okazaki fragment synthesis is impaired (Fig. 6A). Studies based on the analysis of replication products using SV40-origin containing DNA plasmids in UV-irradiated mammalian cells suggested that a blocking lesion on the lagging strand template inhibits the completion of the nascent Okazaki fragment, leaving a small gap in the lagging strand (20Cordeiro-Stone M. Zaritskaya L.S. Price L.K. Kaufmann W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13945-13954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21Mezzina M. Menck C.F. Courtin P. Sarasin A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4249-4258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthesis of a new Okazaki fragment (fragment n+1 in Fig. 6B) is then initiated by DNA pol α/primase, whereas the gap on the damaged strand of the previous fragment (fragment n in Fig. 6C) is being filled presumably by DNA pol δ and/or β. After the polymerase switch between DNA pol α/primase and DNA pol δ has occurred, and DNA pol δ has reached the 5′-end of the downstream Okazaki fragment (fragment n in Fig. 6C), strand displacement synthesis is initiated. During this step, however, DNA pol δ will encounter the AP site still present on the template strand (Fig. 6D). Biochemical data have shown that DNA pol δ is considerably slowed down by the presence of an AP site on the template strand (4Mozzherin D.J. Shibutani S. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6126-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Maga G. Villani G. Ramadan K. Shevelev I. Tanguy Le Gac N. Blanco L. Blanca G. Spadari S. Hubscher U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48434-48440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that strand displacement synthesis will be paused at the site of the lesion, enabling Fen-1 to process the generated Flap (Fig. 6E). The data presented in this work suggest that the resulting intermediate, where the AP site is placed at the ss/dsDNA junction, constitutes an impassable block for DNA pol δ, even in the presence of PCNA and RP-A. This potentially very dangerous situation can be resolved through a special polymerase switch, whereby the repair enzyme DNA pol β can replace DNA pol δ and, in coordination with Fen-1, continues the strand displacement synthesis, thus bypassing the lesion (Fig. 6F). Fen-1 appears to be absolutely required for this reaction, and the fact that Fen-1 and DNA pol β physically interact strengthen this. A stimulatory effect of Fen-1 on the activity of DNA pol β has been already shown to take place in the context of BER reactions (23Liu Y. Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Prasad R. Hou E.W. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3665-3674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because both of these enzymes also interact with PCNA (24Maga G. Hubscher U. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3051-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar), it is possible to envisage a coordinated trade-off mechanism, where pausing of DNA pol δ allows the recruitment of Fen-1 to the Flap through interaction with PCNA. Then DNA pol β is recruited by physical interaction with Fen-1 and PCNA, thus replacing DNA pol δ. As shown in Fig. 2 (B and C), PCNA promoted AP site bypass by DNA pol β. This is the first time that a functional effect for the physical interaction between DNA pol β and PCNA is reported (25Kedar P.S. Kim S.J. Robertson A. Hou E. Prasad R. Horton J.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31115-31123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 26Maga G. Villani G. Crespan E. Wimmer U. Ferrari E. Bertocci B. Hübscher U. Nature. 2007; 447: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In summary, our data suggest that, because the first 30 nt of each Okazaki fragment have to be copied twice, first by DNA pol α/primase and subsequently by DNA pol δ in the context of strand displacement synthesis, the presence of an AP site in this tract will cause a double block that must be resolved by two distinct mechanisms. Thus, our data identify a previously unnoticed deleterious effect of the AP site lesion on normal cell metabolism and suggest the existence of a novel repair pathway that might be important in preventing replication fork stalling.

The RAD51B (RAD51L1, Rec2) protein is a member of the RAD51 paralogs, which share about 20–30% amino acid sequence similarity with the RAD51 protein (36Albala J.S. Thelen M.P. Prange C. Fan W.

In the present study, we found that the human EVL (Ena/Vasp-like) protein binds to the RAD51 and RAD51B proteins in a HeLa cell extract. The EVL protein is known to be involved in cytoplasmic actin remodeling (48Kwiatkowski A.V. Gertler F.B. Loureiro J.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 386-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and is also overexpressed in breast cancer (49Hu L.D. Zou H.F. Zhan S.X. Cao K.M. Oncol. Rep. 2008; 19: 1015-1020PubMed Google Scholar). Like the RAD51B knockdown cells, the EVL knockdown cells partially impaired RAD51 foci formation after DSB induction, suggesting that the EVL protein enhances RAD51 assembly onto DSB sites. The purified EVL protein preferentially bound to ssDNA and stimulated RAD51-mediated homologous pairing and strand exchange. The EVL protein also promoted the annealing of complementary strands. These recombination reactions that were stimulated or promoted by the EVL protein were further enhanced by the RAD51B protein. These results strongly suggested that the EVL protein is a novel factor that activates RAD51-mediated recombination reactions, probably with the RAD51B protein. We anticipate that, in addition to its involvement in cytoplasmic actin dynamics, the EVL protein may be required in homologous recombination for repairing specific DNA lesions, and it may cause tumor malignancy by inappropriate recombination enhanced by EVL overexpression in certain types of tumor cells. Purification of the Human EVL Protein—The human EVL gene was isolated from a human cDNA pool (purchased from Clontech) by polymerase chain reaction and was cloned in the pET-15b vector (Novagen). In this construct, the hexahistidine tag sequence was fused at the N-terminal end of the gene. The EVL protein was expressed in the Escherichia coli JM109(DE3) strain, which also carried an expression vector for the minor tRNAs (Codon(+)RIL; Stratagene). The cells producing the EVL protein were resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.5), 700 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol and were disrupted by sonication. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 30,000 × g, and the lysate was mixed gently by the batch method with Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (8 ml; Qiagen) at 4 °C for 1 h. The EVL-bound beads were washed with 80 ml of buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.5), 700 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 30 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol. The beads were then washed with 80 ml of buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.5), 700 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 60 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol and then were washed again with buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.5), 700 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 30 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol. The beads were then packed into an Econo-column (Bio-Rad) and were washed with 300 ml of buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 30 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol. The His6-tagged EVL protein was eluted with a 30-column volume linear gradient of 30–300 mm imidazole, in 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. The fractions containing the His6-tagged EVL protein were diluted with the same volume of buffer, containing 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, and were mixed gently by the batch method with hydroxyapatite resin (10 ml; Bio-Rad) at 4 °C for 1 h. The resin was then washed with 80 ml of buffer, containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, and was packed into an Econo-column (Bio-Rad). The resin was further washed with 300 ml of buffer, containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.5), 225 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, and then the His6-tagged EVL protein was eluted with a 30-column volume linear gradient of 225–1000 mm NaCl and 10–300 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.5). The His6 tag was uncoupled from the EVL portion by a digestion with 5.5 units of thrombin protease (GE Healthcare) per mg of the His6-tagged EVL protein, and then the protein was immediately dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol at 4 °C. After uncoupling of the His6 tag, the EVL protein was further purified by Superdex 200 gel filtration column (HiLoad 26/60 preparation grade; GE Healthcare) chromatography, followed by Mono S column chromatography. The peak fractions were diluted with the same volume of buffer, containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, and were subjected to MonoS (GE Healthcare) column chromatography. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of buffer, containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, and the EVL protein was eluted with a 12-column volume linear gradient of 100–600 mm NaCl. The purified EVL protein was dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.3), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 30% glycerol and was stored at -80 °C. The concentration of the purified EVL protein was determined by the Bradford method, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were purified by the methods described previously. DNA Substrates—Single-stranded ϕX174 viral (+) strand DNA and double-stranded ϕX174 replicative form I DNA were purchased from New England Biolabs. The linear dsDNA was prepared from the ϕX174 replicative form I DNA by PstI digestion. In the D-loop formation assay, superhelical dsDNA (pB5Sarray DNA) was prepared by a method to prevent irreversible denaturation of the dsDNA substrate by alkaline treatment of the cells harboring the plasmid DNA. The cells were gently lysed using Sarkosyl, as described previously (15Kagawa W. Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35201-35208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The pB5Sarray DNA contained 11 repeats of a sea urchin 5 S rRNA gene (207-bp fragment) within the pBlueScript II SK(+) vector. For the ssDNA annealing assay, the following high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-purified oligonucleotides were purchased from Nihon Gene Research Laboratory: 5′-GTC CCA GGC CAT TAC AGA TCA ATC CTG AGC ATG TTT ACC AAG CGC ATT G-3′ and 5′-CAA TGC GCT TGG TAA ACA TGC TCA GGA TTG ATC TGT AAT GGC CTG GGA C-3′. For the ssDNA substrate used in the D-loop assay, the following HPLC-purified oligonucleotide was purchased: 50-mer, 5′-GGA ATT CGG TAT TCC CAG GCG GTC TCC CAT CCA AGT ACT AAC CGA GCC CT-3′. The DNA sequences used in the strand exchange assay with the oligonucleotides are as follows: 63-mer, 5′-TCC TTT TGA TAA GAG GTC ATT TTT GCG GAT GGC TTA GAG CTT AAT TGC TGA ATC TGG TGC TGT-3′; 32-mer top strand, 5′-CCA TCC GCA AAA ATG ACC TCT TAT CAA AAG GA-3′; 32-mer bottom strand, 5′-TCC TTT TGA TAA GAG GTC ATT TTT GCG GAT GG-3′. The 5′-ends of the oligonucleotide (32-mer bottom strand) were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 30 min. All DNA concentrations are expressed in moles of nucleotides. Pulldown Assays with EVL-conjugated Beads—The EVL protein was covalently conjugated to Affi-Gel 10 beads (100 μl; Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To block the remaining active ester sites, ethanolamine (pH 8.0) was added to a final concentration of 100 mm, and the resin was incubated at 4 °C overnight. The unbound proteins were removed by washing the Affi-Gel 10-EVL beads three times with 500 μl of binding buffer, which contained 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.3), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 30% glycerol, and 0.05% Triton X-100. After washing the resin, the Affi-Gel 10-protein matrices were adjusted to 50% slurries and were stored at 4 °C. For the RAD51B-binding and RAD51-binding assays, the EVL beads were incubated with a HeLa whole cell extract (2 mg of protein), and the beads were washed three times with 200 μl of washing buffer, containing 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque). The proteins that copelleted with the EVL beads were separated into two portions for the RAD51 and RAD51B analyses and were fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE. The RAD51 and RAD51B proteins were detected with the RAD51-specific and RAD51B-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies, respectively. Pulldown Assays with the Ni2+-NTA-Agarose Beads—The His6-tagged EVL protein (0.45 μm) was prepared and was mixed with the RAD51 or RAD51B protein (2 μm) in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.3), containing 95 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.045% Triton X-100, 1.8 mm ammonium sulfate, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 4.5 mm imidazole, and 29% glycerol. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, 1.5 μl of the Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads were added to the reaction mixture, and the RAD51 or RAD51B protein bound to the His6-tagged EVL protein was captured by the beads. The beads were washed two times with 100 μl of washing buffer, containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.3), 90 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 2 mm ammonium sulfate, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm imidazole, and 30% glycerol. The proteins that copelleted with the Ni2+-NTA beads were eluted with a buffer, containing 14 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.3), 100 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 300 mm imidazole, and 21% glycerol. The eluted fractions were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) signals were measured with a Biacore J instrument (GE Healthcare). Flow cells were maintained at 25 °C during the measurement, and the instrument was operated at the mid-flow rate (∼30 μl/min). The EVL protein was conjugated to the activated surface of CM5 sensor chips (GE Healthcare), using the standard amine coupling conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The level of the conjugated EVL protein was 3,860 resonance units. Reference SPR signals of the flow cell containing a sensor chip without the EVL protein were subtracted from those of the SPR signals of the flow cell containing the EVL-conjugated sensor chip. The running buffer was 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.3), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm ammonium sulfate, 5% glycerol, and 0.05% Triton X-100. Before each binding assay, the sensor chip was regenerated by a 1-min wash with 10 mm NaOH and two 1-min washes with 20 mm citrate buffer (pH 2.65), followed by a 25-min wash with the running buffer. For each binding assay, 1 μm analyte solution (i.e. the RAD51 protein, the RAD51B protein, the DMC1 protein, or the BSA solution) was injected for 5 min. Assays for DNA Binding—The ϕX174 circular ssDNA (20 μm) or the linearized ϕX174 dsDNA (20 μm) was mixed with the EVL protein in 10 μl of a standard reaction solution, containing 36 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 24% glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and were then analyzed by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis in 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate and 1 mm EDTA) at 3.3 V/cm for 2 h. The bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The D-loop Formation Assay—The indicated amount of the EVL protein was incubated in the presence or absence of the RAD51 protein (0.1 μm) at 37 °C for 5 min in the reaction buffer, containing 26 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 0.02 mm EDTA, 0.9 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm AMPPNP, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. After this incubation, the 32P-labeled 50-mer oligonucleotide (1 μm) was added, and the samples were further incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The reactions were then initiated by the addition of the pB5Sarray superhelical dsDNA (60 μm) along with 9 mm MgCl2 and were continued at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.2% SDS and 1.5 mg/ml proteinase K and were further incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. After adding 6-fold loading dye, the deproteinized reaction products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 1× TAE buffer at 3.3 V/cm for 2.5 h. The gels were dried, exposed to an imaging plate, and visualized using an FLA-7000 imaging analyzer (Fujifilm). Assays for Homologous Pairing with Oligonucleotides—For the homologous pairing assay with oligonucleotides, the RAD51 protein and the indicated amounts of the EVL protein were incubated with a 63-mer ssDNA (15 μm) in 10 μl of standard reaction buffer, containing 28 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.02 mm EDTA, 1.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 75 μg/ml creatine kinase, and 8% glycerol at 37 °C for 10 min. The strand exchange reaction was initiated by the addition of the 32-mer dsDNA (1.5 μm), which shared sequence homology with the 63-mer ssDNA. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.2% SDS and 1.5 mg/ml proteinase K. The reaction mixtures were further incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. After 6-fold loading dye was added, the reaction mixtures were subjected to 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA) at 10 V/cm for 5 h. The gels were dried, exposed to an imaging plate, and visualized using an FLA-7000 imaging analyzer. Assay for Strand Exchange—The RAD51 protein (1 μm) and RPA (1 μm) were incubated with the indicated amounts of the EVL protein and/or the RAD51B protein at 30 °C for 10 min, in 8 μl of reaction buffer, containing 28 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 49 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.03 mm EDTA, 1.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 9% glycerol, 0.2 mm ammonium sulfate, 0.005% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 20 mm creatine phosphate, and 75 μg/ml creatine kinase. After this incubation, ϕX174 circular ssDNA (20 μm) was added, and the samples were further incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The reactions were then initiated by the addition of ϕX174 linear dsDNA (20 μm) and were continued at 30 °C for 60 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.2% SDS and 1.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) and were further incubated for 20 min. After adding 6-fold loading dye, the deproteinized reaction products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 1 × TAE buffer at 3.3 V/cm for 4 h. The products were visualized by SYBR Gold (Invitrogen) staining. ssDNA Annealing Assay—The ssDNA oligonucleotide 49-mer (0.2 μm) was incubated with the indicated amounts of the EVL protein at 30 °C for 5 min in 9 μl of reaction buffer, containing 28 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 12% glycerol, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. For the experiment with the RAD51B protein, the EVL protein was preincubated with the indicated amounts of the RAD51B protein at 30 °C for 10 min, in 8 μl of reaction buffer, containing 28 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 38 mm NaCl, 1.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 12% glycerol, 0.4 mm ammonium sulfate, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA, before the addition of the ssDNA oligonucleotide. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.2 μm antisense 32P-labeled 49-mer oligonucleotide. At the times indicated, the reactions were quenched with an excess of the unlabeled 49-mer oligonucleotide. The DNA substrates and products were deproteinized by 0.2% SDS and 1.5 mg/ml proteinase K at 30 °C for 10 min. The products were fractionated by 10% PAGE in 0.5× TBE. The gels were dried, exposed to an imaging plate, and visualized using an FLA-7000 imaging analyzer. EVL and RAD51B Knockdown Experiments—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies for the EVL and RAD51B proteins were obtained with the purified recombinant EVL and RAD51B proteins as antigens. The RAD51 antibody was purchased from Calbiochem (anti-RAD51 Ab-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody), and the Cdk2 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Anti-Cdk2 M2 rabbit polyclonal antibody). The siRNA duplexes (Stealth™ RNAi) were designed by the BLOCK-iT™ RNAi Designer (Invitrogen) and were purchased from Invitrogen. The siRNA sequences of EVL and RAD51B are as follows: 5′-CCAGUAAGAAAUGGGUACCAAUCAA-3′ (for EVL) and 5′-GAGGUGUCCAUGAACUUCUAUGUAU-3′ (for RAD51B). The sequence of the control siRNA is 5′-CCAAGAAGUAAAUGGAACCUUGCAA-3′, in which the EVL siRNA sequence was shuffled. The cells were seeded in a 6-well plate. A 15-μl aliquot of siRNA (20 μm) was diluted with 185 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. In a sep"
https://openalex.org/W2109682362,"Background Tinnitus is a frequent condition with high morbidity and impairment in quality of life. The pathophysiology is still incompletely understood. Electromagnetic fields are discussed to be involved in the multi-factorial pathogenesis of tinnitus, but data proofing this relationship are very limited. Potential health hazards of electromagnetic fields (EMF) have been under discussion for long. Especially, individuals claiming themselves to be electromagnetic hypersensitive suffer from a variety of unspecific symptoms, which they attribute to EMF-exposure. The aim of the study was to elucidate the relationship between EMF-exposure, electromagnetic hypersensitivity and tinnitus using a case-control design. Methodology Tinnitus occurrence and tinnitus severity were assessed by questionnaires in 89 electromagnetic hypersensitive patients and 107 controls matched for age-, gender, living surroundings and workplace. Using a logistic regression approach, potential risk factors for the development of tinnitus were evaluated. Findings Tinnitus was significantly more frequent in the electromagnetic hypersensitive group (50.72% vs. 17.5%) whereas tinnitus duration and severity did not differ between groups. Electromagnetic hypersensitivity and tinnitus were independent risk factors for sleep disturbances. However, measures of individual EMF-exposure like e.g. cell phone use did not show any association with tinnitus. Conclusions Our data indicate that tinnitus is associated with subjective electromagnetic hypersensitivity. An individual vulnerability probably due to an over activated cortical distress network seems to be responsible for, both, electromagnetic hypersensitivity and tinnitus. Hence, therapeutic efforts should focus on treatment strategies (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy) aiming at normalizing this dysfunctional distress network."
https://openalex.org/W2146190882,"The 6-protein complex shelterin protects the telomeres of human chromosomes. The recent discovery that telomeres are important for epigenetic gene regulation and vertebrate embryonic development calls for the establishment of model organisms to study shelterin and telomere function under normal developmental conditions. Here, we report the sequences of the shelterin-encoding genes in Xenopus laevis and its close relation Xenopus tropicalis. In vitro expression and biochemical characterization of the Xenopus shelterin proteins TRF1, TRF2, POT1, TIN2, RAP1, TPP1, and the shelterin accessory factor PINX1 indicate that all main functions of their human orthologs are conserved in Xenopus. The XlTRF1 and XtTRF1 proteins bind double-stranded telomeric DNA sequence specifically and interact with XlTIN2 and XtTIN2, respectively. Similarly, the XlTRF2 and XtTRF2 proteins bind double-stranded telomeric DNA and interact with XlRAP1 and XtRAP1, respectively, whereas the XlPOT1 and XtPOT1 proteins bind single-stranded telomeric DNA. Real-time PCR further reveals the gene expression profiles for telomerase and the shelterin genes during embryogenesis. Notably, the composition of shelterin and the formation of its subcomplexes appear to be temporally regulated during embryonic development. Moreover, unexpectedly high telomerase and shelterin gene expression during early embryogenesis may reflect a telomere length-resetting mechanism, similar to that reported for induced pluripotent stem cells and for animals cloned through somatic nuclear transfer."

We show that a 60-amino acid C-terminal deletion mutant of ICP8 (ICP8ΔC) also binds very strongly to UL9ct. Using small angle x-ray scattering, the low resolution solution structures of UL9ct alone, in complex with ICP8ΔC, and in complex with a 15-mer double-stranded DNA containing Box I of the origin of replication are described. Size exclusion chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, backed up by isothermal titration calorimetry measurements, are used to show that the stoichiometry of the UL9ct-dsDNA15-mer complex is 2:1 at micromolar protein concentrations. The reaction occurs in two steps with initial binding of UL9ct to DNA (Kd ∼ 6 nm) followed by a second binding event (Kd ∼ 0.8 nm). It is also shown that the stoichiometry of the ternary UL9ct-ICP8ΔC-dsDNA15-mer complex is 2:1:1, at the concentrations used in the different assays. Electron microscopy indicates that the complex assembled on the extended origin, oriS, rather than Box I alone, is much larger. The results are consistent with a simple model whereby a conformational switch of the UL9 DNA-binding domain upon binding to Box I allows the recruitment of a UL9-ICP8 complex by interaction between the UL9 DNA-binding domains.

The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) genome encodes seven proteins required for origin-dependent DNA replication. These are the DNA polymerase (UL30) and its accessory protein (UL42), a heterotrimeric helicase-primase complex (UL5, UL8, and UL52), the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (ICP8 or UL29), and the origin-binding protein (UL9) (reviewed in Ref. 1Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 347-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). HSV-1 contains three functional origins, oriL and two copies of oriS. OriS, which is about 80 bp in length, consists of three UL9 recognition sites, in Boxes I, II, and III, which are arranged in two overlapping palindromes (2Aslani A. Macao B. Simonsson S. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7194-7199Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Box I and Box III are part of an evolutionarily conserved palindrome that forms a stable hairpin in single-stranded DNA, which may be important in the origin rearrangement (3Macao B. Olsson M. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29211-29217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) during initiation of replication. Box I and II are separated by an AT-rich spacer sequence, which varies in length and nucleotide composition between the different members of the α-herpesvirus subfamily (2Aslani A. Macao B.

UL9 is a homodimer in solution, and EM studies, with UL9 bound to oriS, indicate the existence of a dimer or pair of dimers assembled on oriS (7Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1742-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Several reports indicate that UL9 can physically interact not only with ICP8 (8Boehmer P.E. Craigie M.C. Stow N.D. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29329-29334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but also with other members of the HSV-1 replication complex, including UL8 (9McLean G.W. Abbotts A.P. Parry M.E. Marsden H.S. Stow N.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 2699-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and UL42 (10Monahan S.J. Grinstead L.A. Olivieri W. Parris D.S. Virology. 1998; 241: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus UL9 functions as a docking protein to recruit these essential replication proteins to the viral origins. ICP8 stimulates the helicase activity of UL9 (11Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2676-2683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Boehmer P.E. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1220-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and binds to its C-terminal 27-aa residues (13Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the presence of ICP8, UL9 will open dsDNA containing Box I, leading to a conformational change in the origin, thus facilitating unwinding (14Lee S.S. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 15He X. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3024-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Makhov A.M. Lee S.S. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 898-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As stated above, the changes in DNA conformation in the complete oriS may be more complex (3Macao B. Olsson M. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29211-29217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that single-stranded oriS folds into a unique and evolutionarily conserved conformation, oriS*, which is stably bound by UL9. oriS* contains a hairpin formed by complementary base pairing between Box I and Box III in oriS (17Aslani A. Simonsson S. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5880-5887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). UL9, in the presence of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein ICP8, can convert an 80-bp double-stranded minimal oriS fragment to oriS* and form a UL9-oriS* complex. The formation of a UL9-oriS* complex requires ATP hydrolysis (18Aslani A. Olsson M. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41204-41212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, the UL9-oriS* complex may serve as an assembly site for the herpesvirus replisome. Macao et al. (3Macao B. Olsson M. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29211-29217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) proposed a model in which full-length UL9 would be required to adopt a different conformation when binding to oriS or oriS*. The implication is that UL9 partially unwinds and introduces a hairpin into the origin of replication and that the formation of oriS* is aided, in some way, by ICP8 and requires ATP hydrolysis. Macao et al. (3Macao B. Olsson M. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29211-29217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) suggest that the length of the single-stranded tail of the probe DNA determines the stoichiometry of the UL9-DNA complex. oriS may bind two molecules of UL9, whereas oriS* may only bind one because the hairpin formation prevents the second interaction. Photo-cross-linking studies have shown that, although the UL9 protein binds Box I as a dimer, only one of the two monomers contacts Box I, suggesting that the C terminus of UL9 undergoes a conformational change upon binding to Box I (19Lee S.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18613-18617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The results reported here are consistent with this observation. To date there is no three-dimensional structural information available on the full-length UL9 or either of the functionally characterized (helicase and DNA binding) domains. The ability to adopt different conformations and a tendency to proteolytic degradation may be responsible for this. It has been shown that UL9 binds with very high specificity to the Box I through its DNA-binding domain, consisting of the C-terminal 317 aa (UL9ct) (20Weir H.M. Calder J.M. Stow N.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1409-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Hazuda D.J. Perry H.C. Naylor A.M. McClements W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24621-24626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the importance of the binding between UL9ct and oriS for the viral life cycle is well established, the mechanism behind this interaction still remains unclear. Even though UL9ct exists as a monomer in solution, uncertainty remains as to whether one or two molecules bind to a single Box I recognition sequence. Some reports have suggested that one UL9ct molecule binds to a single copy of the sequence (22Simonsson S. Samuelsson T. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24633-24639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 23Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol.

Virol. 1994; 68: 3674-3681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas others have proposed that UL9ct forms a dimer when bound to DNA (25Fierer D.S. Challberg M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7330-7334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Stabell E.C. Olivo P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5203-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This apparent difference may well result from the different protein concentrations used in different assays/experiments, which in turn highlights the difficulty of translating in vitro equilibrium experiments into cellular nonequilibrium situations. A few years ago, the crystal structure of a 60-residue C-terminal deletion mutant of ICP8 (ICP8ΔC) was determined to 3 Å resolution (Protein Data Bank code 1URJ (27Mapelli M. Panjikar S. Tucker P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2990-2997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)). The structure of ICP8ΔC consists of a large N-terminal domain (aa 9–1038) and a smaller entirely helical C-terminal domain (aa 1049–1120) connected to the N-terminal domain by a disordered linker (aa 1038–1049) spanning around 18 Å in the crystal structure. ICP8 preferentially binds ssDNA over dsDNA in a nonsequence-specific and cooperative manner (28Lee C.K. Knipe D.M. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 731-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ICP8 is a zinc metalloprotein containing one zinc atom per molecule, which is coordinated by three cysteines (Cys-499, Cys-502, and Cys-510) and a histidine (His-512) (27Mapelli M. Panjikar S. Tucker P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2990-2997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the 60-amino acid C-terminal deletion of ICP8 (ICP8ΔC) binds strongly to UL9ct. We present three low resolution structures in solution using small angle x-ray scattering as follows: that of the UL9ct alone, in complex with ICP8ΔC, and in complex with a 15-mer dsDNA (dsDNA15-mer) containing the Box I sequence. Using these data and a variety of biophysical techniques, we demonstrate that the stoichiometries of the UL9ct-dsDNA15-mer and UL9ct-ICP8ΔC-dsDNA15-mer complexes are 2:1 and 2:1:1, respectively, at the micromolar protein concentrations used in this study. Using EM we visualize the assembly of the ICP8ΔC-UL9ct complex on oriS and estimate the size of the complex. Insect-cell culture media and reagents were obtained from Invitrogen, and the oligonucleotides were from MWG and Eurogentec. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells and the pET-23b plasmid were obtained from Novagen. The UL9ct clone was a kind gift of Dr. N. Stow (MRC Virology Unit, Glasgow, Scotland, UK) (29Stow N.D. Brown G. Cross A.M. Abbotts A.P. Virology. 1998; 240: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A single colony of E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS transformed with the appropriate plasmid was inoculated overnight at 30 °C in 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with 50 μg ml−1 ampicillin and 34 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol. One ml of culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with the same antibiotics. For the native protein, after growing at 30 °C to A600 = 0.8, the culture was rapidly cooled to 15 °C, and expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Harvesting took place after 12–14 h of expression at 15 °C. Finally, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 11,500 × g, and the pellets were stored at −20 °C until required. A pellet from 1 liter of cells was resuspended in 30 ml of buffer-L1 (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). The cells were sonicated, and the supernatant was separated from the cell debris by centrifugation at 64,000 × g (Beckman SA-300 rotor) for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein was purified over an SP-Sepharose (1 ml) column followed by a heparin (1 ml) column. In each case, once the base line had been reached, a linear gradient from 100 to 1000 mm NaCl in buffer-L1 was used to elute the protein. A final purification step using size exclusion chromatography was carried out using a Superdex-75 (10/30) column. The UL9ct concentration was estimated from the theoretical molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm (38,305 m−1 cm−1). expresSF+ insect cells (Protein Sciences Corp.) were maintained in Sf900II medium supplemented with 100 units ml−1 penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and grown in 2.5-liter suspension flasks (Fernbach) to a cell density of 4 × 106 cells ml−1. Cells were diluted 1:2 prior to infection with the recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Sixty five to 70 h after infection, cells were harvested, washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen at −80 °C. The insect cell pellets from 300 ml of insect cell culture were resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer-L2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 μg ml−1 DNase I, and 4 tablets of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and homogenized by sonication. The lysed cells were cleared by centrifugation at 64,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckman SA-300 rotor. The protein solution was applied to a 5-ml nickel-chelating column followed by a gel filtration column (Superdex-200) using an Äkta purifier (Amersham Biosciences) equipped with the three-dimensional kit. The His6-tagged protein constructs were purified following a standard three-dimensional Äkta purifier protocol with a combined low imidazole (5 mm imidazole) and a high salt (500 mm NaCl) washing step. The proteins were eluted from the nickel-chelating column with buffer-L2 + 500 mm imidazole. The final gel filtration and storage buffer was buffer-GF (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 5% (v/v) glycerol). The UL9ct-ICP8ΔC complex was purified using one of two strategies as follows: 1) either by mixing the separately purified proteins together in the appropriate molar ratio and running the mixture through a gel filtration (Superdex-200) column, or 2) by mixing the corresponding cell lysates together and following a three-dimensional kit protocol (Amersham Biosciences) with a nickel-chelating column followed by size exclusion chromatography. The nature of the complex did not depend on the manner of preparation (note that only ICP8ΔC is His6-tagged). Two 15-base-long oligonucleotides were purchased to form the dsDNA15-mer, the F15-mer 5′-gcgttcgcacttcgt-3′ and the R15-mer 5′-acgaagtgcgaacgc-3′. Equimolar amounts of the complementary oligonucleotides were mixed, heated to 90 °C for 20 min in annealing buffer-A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl), and cooled slowly to 4 °C overnight to achieve complete annealing. The duplex DNA was separated from un-annealed ssDNA using size exclusion chromatography (Superdex-75). The DNA concentration was calculated based on the reduced molar extinction coefficient (230,000 m−1cm−1) calculated by summing the nucleoside extinction coefficients at 260 nm and subtracting 18% to correct for the hypochromic effect in the duplex. In the case of hexachlorofluorescein-labeled dsDNA15-mer (hex-dsDNA15-mer), the contribution of the fluorescent tag, at 260 nm, was also taken into account (∼10%). To test complex formation using EMSA, different molar ratios of the dsDNA15-mer template and the pre-purified UL9ct (see above) were mixed and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in buffer-GF. The ternary complex was investigated in a similar manner. For the SAXS experiments on the UL9ct-dsDNA15-mer complex, a 2:1 molar ratio was used, followed by a polishing step using a gel filtration column (Superdex-200) to separate the protein-DNA complex from any unbound dsDNA. UL9ct and the DNA duplex were prepared and purified as described above. During this experiment, buffer-A1 (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) was used, instead of annealing buffer-A. The 1-ml fractions, corresponding to dsDNA, were stored at −20 °C. ITC measurements were carried out in duplicate on a MicroCal VP-ITC instrument at 25 °C. DNA (463 μm) was injected into 1.8 ml of buffer-A1 containing UL9ct (15.8 μm). The volume of DNA per injection was 2.5 μl. The UL9ct and DNA concentrations were determined as described above. The kcal/mol per injection was fitted by a two-step reaction using the Origin software (MicroCal), after subtracting −0.9 kcal/mol, corresponding to the approximate average of the control experiment, namely titrating buffer without DNA into the UL9ct solution. Hex-dsDNA15-mer (final concentration 3 μm) was incubated with ICP8ΔC (1:1 molar ratio) and with ICP8ΔC and UL9ct (1:1:1 molar ratio). In this case, the buffer used was 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The elution was performed on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column. A second experiment was performed on the native UL9ct-dsDNA15-mer complex at two protein:DNA ratios (i.e. 1:1 and 2:1) and a final DNA concentration of 5 μm. This analysis was performed using a Superose 12 10/300 GL column, run at 1 ml min−1 and 4 °C on an Äkta purifier system. The column was equilibrated with 2 column volumes of buffer-GF. The nucleoprotein complexes and free DNA were loaded onto the column in 250-μl aliquots, following its calibration with high molecular weight markers (Amersham Biosciences). Native UL9ct was mixed with dsDNA15-mer at 4:1 monomer protein to DNA ratio at 2.4 μm final DNA concentration. Complex (400 μl) and buffer (425 μl) were loaded into a standard double-sector EPON cell with quartz glass window assemblies of 12-mm optical path length. The cell was subsequently loaded into an AN50-Ti analytical rotor and transferred to the centrifuge, where it was left to equilibrate at 4 °C. The rotor was accelerated to 42,000 rpm, and scans were taken every 10 min at 262 nm until complete depletion of sample at the meniscus was observed. The data produced were analyzed using the c(s) program present in the UltraScan 7.1 software package. The partial specific volume (VP) used for the analysis of the complex data (0.71 ml g−1) was calculated based on Equation 1 that takes into account the individual VP values of UL9ct (0.73 ml g−1, calculated by SEDNTERP (30Laue T.M.

Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar)) and DNA (0.55 ml g−1 (31Durchschlag H. Hinz H.-J. Thermodynamic Data for Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Springer-Verlag, New York1986: 80-81Google Scholar)), and the stoichiometric ratio of the two (2:1 protein monomers to DNA (32Rasimas J.J. Pegg A.E. Fried M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7973-7980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)).VP(PnD)=(nMPVP(P)+MDVP(D))(nMP+MD)(Eq. 1) where VP(PnD) is the partial specific volume of the nucleoprotein complex; n is the number of protein monomers; VP(P) is the partial specific volume of UL9ct; MP is the molecular weight of UL9ct; VP(D) is the partial specific volume of DNA; and MD is the molecular weight of the DNA used. Different molar ratios of protein in buffer-GF were mixed with equal volumes of the dsDNA15-mer, containing the Box I UL9 recognition site (annealed F15-mer 5′-gcgttcgcacttcgt-3′ and R15-mer 5′-acgaagtgcgaacgc-3′). The binding reactions, typically 30–40 μl, were left to equilibrate at 4 °C for 30 min before loading onto a 1.0% TBE-agarose gel in 0.5× TBE buffer. Following electrophoresis at 8 V cm−1 for 3 h, DNA was visualized with ethidium bromide, and the proteins were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. In a typical reaction (50 μl) pGEM822 plasmid DNA (33Wong S.C. Schaffer P.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2601-2611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the 822-bp HSV-1 BamHI fragment containing oriS isolated from pGEM822 was mixed with the 1:1 UL9ct-ICP8ΔC complex in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) to give final concentrations of 3 μg ml−1 of DNA (150–250 ng) and 45 μg ml−1 of protein (2.25 μg). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, then fixed with 0.6% glutaraldehyde (final concentration) for 5 min, and chromatographed over 2-ml columns of 10% agarose beads (Agarose Bead Technology, Colna, Portugal) to remove free protein and fixatives. The fractions containing DNA-protein complexes were collected, mixed with spermidine (2.5 mm final concentration), adsorbed onto glow-charged thin carbon foils, dehydrated through a water-ethanol series, and rotary shadow-cast with tungsten (34Griffith J.D. Christiansen G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The samples were examined using a Tecnai 12 instrument at 40 kV or Philips CM12 instrument at 80 kV. Images were recorded on SO-163 film (Eastman-Kodak Co.) at magnifications of 35,000, 45,000, or 60,000, and the images were scanned with an Imacon 848 film scanner (Hasselblad A/S, Gothenburg, Sweden). The contrast was optimized, and images were arranged using Adobe Photoshop software. The molecular mass of UL9ct-ICP8ΔC complexes bound to oriS was evaluated as described previously (35Griffith J.D. Makhov A. Zawel L. Reinberg D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In brief, 1:1 complexes of UL9ct-ICP8ΔC were formed on a linear fragment containing oriS, and following fixation and just prior to mounting, apoferritin (Sigma) (443 kDa) was added. In micrographs, the projected area of several apoferritin particles was determined, averaged, and compared with the projected area of the oriS-DNA complex. Conversion to volume ratios was carried out on the assumption that the apoferritin and oriS-DNA complexes were spherical, and this was converted to a mass ratio. The mass of the duplex DNA within the complex was excluded from consideration based on the assumption that it does not significantly affect the net volume of the complex. The synchrotron radiation x-ray scattering data were collected on the X33 beamline of the EMBL on the storage ring DORIS III (DESY, Hamburg, Germany) (36Roessle M.W. Klaering R. Ristau U. Robrahn B. Jahn D. Gehrmann T. Konarev P. Round A. Fiedler S. Hermes C. Svergun D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: S190-S194Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Solutions of UL9ct protein and its complexes with ICP8ΔC protein (UL9ct/ICP8ΔC) and dsDNA15-mer (UL9ct/DNA) were measured at 15 °C in the solute concentration range between 0.8 and 1.5 mg ml−1 in buffer-GF. The data were recorded using a MAR345 two-dimensional image plate detector at a sample-detector distance of 2.7 m and a wavelength of λ = 1.5 Å, covering the range of momentum transfer 0.12 < s < 4.5 nm−1 (s = 4π sinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle). To check for radiation damage, the data were collected in two 2-min exposures. These measurements indicated no changes in the scattering patterns with time, i.e. there was no measurable radiation damage. The data were averaged after normalization to the intensity of the incident beam, and the scattering of the buffer was subtracted. All data manipulations were performed using the program package PRIMUS (37Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2342) Google Scholar). The forward scattering I(0) and the radius of gyration (Rg) were evaluated using the Guinier approximation assuming that, at very small angles (s < 1.3/Rg), the intensity is represented as I(s) = I(0) exp(−(sRg)2/3). These parameters and the maximum diameter (Dmax) of the particle were also computed from the entire scattering patterns using the program GNOM (38Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2947) Google Scholar). The excluded volume, Vp, of the particle was computed from the Porod invariant (39Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. General Theory, in Small-angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982: 17-51Google Scholar). The molecular masses of the solutes were evaluated by comparison of the forward scattering with that from reference solutions of bovine serum albumin (66 kDa). The ab initio low resolution shape analysis of UL9ct was performed using the program DAMMIN (40Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). The program represents the molecule as a collection of M ≫ 1 densely packed beads inside a sphere with Dmax. Each bead belongs either to the molecule or to the solvent, and the shape is described by a binary string of length M. Starting from a random string, simulated annealing is employed to search for a compact model that fits the shape of the scattering curve I(s) to minimize the discrepancy shown in Equation 2,χ2=1N−1∑j(I(sj)−clcalc (sj)σ(sj))2(Eq. 2) where N is the number of experimental points; c is a scale factor, and Icalc(sj) and σ(sj) are the calculated intensity and the experimental error at the momentum transfer sj, respectively. The program GASBOR (41Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar) was used to create ab initio models of the UL9ct protein consisting of dummy residues instead of beads. In this program a simulated annealing protocol is employed to construct a model with a protein-like distribution of beads that provides the best fit to the experimental data. For all ab initio analyses, multiple runs were performed to verify the stability and reliability of the solution. The structure of the ICP8ΔC-UL9ct complex (with 1:1 stoichiometry) was refined by rigid body modeling using the program SASREF (42Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1237-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), which employs a simulated annealing protocol to generate an interconnected assembly of subunits without steric clashes fitting the scattering data. The monomer model of ICP8ΔC was taken from the crystal structure (27Mapelli M. Panjikar S. Tucker P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2990-2997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas for UL9ct, the reconstructed ab initio envelope was used. The scattering amplitudes from the two proteins were calculated using the program CRYSOL (43Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2765) Google Scholar). Two potential models were found by multiple runs of SASREF.

https://openalex.org/W2074141261,"A number of mammalian genes exhibit the unusual properties of random monoallelic expression and random asynchronous replication. Such exceptional genes include genes subject to X inactivation and autosomal genes including odorant receptors, immunoglobulins, interleukins, pheromone receptors, and p120 catenin. In differentiated cells, random asynchronous replication of interspersed autosomal genes is coordinated at the whole chromosome level, indicative of chromosome-pair non-equivalence. Here we have investigated the replication pattern of the random asynchronously replicating genes in undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells, using fluorescence in situ hybridization based assay. We show that allele-specific replication of X-linked genes and random monoallelic autosomal genes occur in human embryonic stem cells. The direction of replication is coordinated at the whole chromosome level and can cross the centromere, indicating the existence of autosome-pair non-equivalence in human embryonic stem cells. These results suggest that epigenetic mechanism(s) that randomly distinguish between two parental alleles are emerging in the cells of the inner cell mass, the source of human embryonic stem cells."

It is unknown whether both electrons are transferred from the same domain close to the Rieske protein, or if an unstable semiquinone anion intermediate diffuses rapidly to the vicinity of the bL heme. We have determined the pre-steady state rate and activation energy (Ea) for quinol oxidation in purified yeast bc1 complexes harboring either a Y185F mutation in the Rieske protein, which decreases the redox potential of the FeS cluster, or a E272Q cytochrome b mutation, which eliminates the proton acceptor in cytochrome b. The rate of the bifurcated reaction in the E272Q mutant (<10% of the wild type) was even lower than that of the Y185F enzyme (∼20% of the wild type). However, the E272Q enzyme showed the same Ea (61 kJ mol-1) with respect to the wild type (62 kJ mol-1), in contrast with the Y185F mutation, which increased Ea to 73 kJ mol-1. The rate and Ea of the slow reaction of quinol with oxygen that are observed after cytochrome b is reduced were unaffected by the E272Q substitution, whereas the Y185F mutation modified only its rate. The Y185F/E272Q double mutation resulted in a synergistic decrease in the rate of quinol oxidation (0.7% of the wild type). These results are inconsistent with a sequential “movable semiquinone” mechanism but are consistent with a model in which both electrons are transferred simultaneously from the same domain in center P.

https://openalex.org/W1972323447,"The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) plays a key role in plasma cholesterol homeostasis by binding and internalizing lipoprotein ligands. Studies have revealed that one or more of the seven LDL type A repeats (LA1-LA7) in the receptor are responsible for apolipoprotein binding. In the present study, protein engineering was performed to swap or replace key LA repeats in a recombinant soluble LDLR (sLDLR). Although wild type sLDLR showed strong ligand binding activity, an sLDLR variant in which LA repeat 5 was replaced by a second copy of LA repeat 2 showed low binding activity. Likewise, a variant wherein LA repeats 2 and 5 were swapped displayed low binding activity. At the same time, substitution of LA repeat 2 with a second a copy of repeat 5 resulted in a receptor with ligand binding activity similar to wild type LDLR. When binding assays were conducted with human low density lipoprotein as ligand, LA repeat order was a less important determinant of binding activity. Taken together, the data indicate that the sequential order of LA repeats plays a key role in ligand binding properties of LDLR."

https://openalex.org/W2093673110,"PRIP (peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor interacting protein) is a nuclear receptor coactivator required for mammary gland development. To understand the function of PRIP in breast tumorigenesis, we established a mammary tumor cell line with the PRIP(Loxp/Loxp) genotype. By knocking out the PRIP gene in the tumor cell line, we demonstrated that PRIP deficiency led to inhibited tumor formation without affecting tumor cell proliferation. The PRIP deficiency was associated with decreased cell invasion and migration capabilities. We found that PRIP deficiency substantially reduced FOS gene expression. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that PRIP was recruited to the FOS promoter. In addition, we demonstrated that PRIP also directly up-regulated the FOS gene expression in human breast cancer cells. Promoter analysis showed that PRIP acted through serum-responsive factor to regulate FOS gene expression. Finally, by re-expressing the FOS gene, we confirmed that the inhibited tumor formation of PRIP-deficient tumor cells was due to reduced expression of the FOS gene."
