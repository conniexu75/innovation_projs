https://openalex.org/W1579716589,"Formycin, 2-aminopurine ribonucleoside, and 2,6-diaminopurine ribonucleoside are analogues of adenosine in base pairing and in a wide variety of enzymatic reactions. These chromophores, in contrast to adenine and other naturally occurring bases, are fluorescent under physiological conditions. Another noteworthy feature of these analogues is that they can be selectively excited in the presence of normal bases because their absorption bands occur at longer wave lengths. The fluorescence properties of these compounds, and of their phosphorylated derivatives, over a wide range of temperature, pH, and ionic strength, are reported here. Incorporation of formycin or 2-aminopurine into a perfectly alternating ribocopolymer results in a 100-fold reduction of the quantum yield of fluorescence. The residual fluorescence comes from chromophores at the ends of the polymer. Thermal denaturation of the helical structure is accompanied by a 3- to 10-fold increase in quantum yield. The pH and temperature dependence of the fluorescence of transfer RNA with formycin residue in place of the terminal adenosine indicates that the terminal formycin residue interacts with other parts of the transfer RNA molecule. Some potential applications of these analogues in studies of the structure and function of nucleic acids and proteins are: analysis of protein-nucleic acid interaction, polynucleotide conformation and conformational transitions, enzyme-coenzyme interaction, and nuclease assay."
https://openalex.org/W2014744085,"A new kind of statistical display, the joint peri-stimulus-time scatter diagram, facilitates the analysis and interpretation of two or more simultaneously recorded trains of action potentials. The display is a generalization of the cross correlation and the peri-stimulus-time histogram, and it reflects specific underlying neuronal interactions. The technique yields quantitative measures of interaction in terms of effectiveness of synaptic connections."
https://openalex.org/W1530765498,"Polynucleotides containing AMP in excess of 90 mole account for almost 1 of the total RNA synthesized by Ehrlich ascites cells growing either in the mouse or during short incubations in vitro. A method based on the affinity of these AMP-rich polynucleotides for polythymidylate oligomers covalently bound to cellulose has been used to isolate them from the total cellular RNA. The most highly purified fractions are relatively large polynucleotides of the order of 8 to 10 S as judged by their electrophoretic mobility on polyacrylamide gels relative to that of a number of well characterized RNA molecules. They are located primarily in the cell nucleus, for almost 90 of the polyadenylate of whole cells was recovered in nuclei from an aqueous homogenate of these cells. The suppression of polyadenylate synthesis by relatively low doses of actinomycin D suggests that it may be synthesized on a DNA template."
https://openalex.org/W1499259204,"Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (inosine monophosphate:pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase EC 2.4.2.8) has been purified 50-fold from an acid-treated lysate of human erythrocytes. The average particle weight of the enzyme was estimated by gel filtration at 60,000. Between the pH values of 7.1 and 9.1 no marked difference in the initial velocity of IMP synthesis was observed. Kinetic studies of magnesium effects are consistent with the view that magnesium activates nucleotide synthesis by complexing with the substrate 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate. Guanine, hypoxanthine, and 6-mercaptopurine are good substrates for the enzyme, while xanthine and allopurinol are very poor substrates. No detectable nucleotides were formed from adenine, uric acid, uracil, azathioprine, and oxipurinol. The enzyme effectively binds purines with an oxo or thio group in position 6, but not those with a 6-amino group. A 2-amino group enhances binding whereas a 2-hydroxyl group diminishes it. Of the N-methyl purines, only the 1-methyl derivatives show significant binding to the enzyme. The important role of the imidazole ring of purine in binding is indicated by the relatively poor binding of the pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidines and the v-triazolo(4,5-d)pyrimidines. That the imidazole portion itself is not sufficient for binding is shown by the high Ki values for 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide and its formyl derivative."

https://openalex.org/W1972097792,"Tactile stimulation of the siphon and mantle shelf in Aplysia causes a characteristic withdrawal response of the external organs of the mantle cavity. A similar response also occurs spontaneously. Both responses are mediated by the abdominal ganglion and therefore provide an opportunity for correlating cellular functioning and behavior in a relatively simple and well-studied neuronal system. The withdrawal responses are controlled by five identified motor cells which receive two types of synaptic inputs. One set of excitatory connections, activated by tactile stimulation of the siphon and mantle shelf, mediates the defensive withdrawal reflex. A second set of connections is activated by a spontaneous burst of activity in a group of closely coupled interneurons which are excitatory to some of the motor cells and inhibitory to the others. This second set of connections mediates the spontaneous withdrawal response. These two inputs can therefore switch the same population of motor cells from a simple reflex to a more complex, internally organized response."
https://openalex.org/W2056679416,"The effects of marihuana, alcohol, and no treatment on simulated driving performance were determined for experienced marihuana smokers. Subjects experiencing a ""social marihuana high"" accumulated significantly more speedometer errors than when under control conditions, whereas there were no significant differences in accelerator, brake, signal, steering, and total errors. The same subjects intoxicated from alcohol accumulated significantly more accelerator, brake, signal, speedometer, and total errors than under normal conditions, whereas there was no significant difference in steering errors. Impairment in simulated driving performance does not seem to be a function of increased marihuana dosage or inexperience with the drug."

https://openalex.org/W1518517454,"Abstract 1. The β-galactosidases of rat intestinal mucosa have been isolated and characterized. 2. There is a lysosomal enzyme with a pH optimum of 3.0 which is relatively heat-stable, active against o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside and 6-bromo-2-naphthyl-β-d-galactoside, but relatively inactive against lactose. This activity is latent and isolated in subcellular fractions containing other lysosomal enzymes. 3. The brush borders of intestinal mucosa contain a separate single enzyme with a pH optimum of 6.0 and relative instability to heat, which hydrolyzes lactose readily. This enzyme has been purified 1000-fold, and a single protein zone containing lactose activity was isolated in polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis. When o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside is used as a substrate for β-galactosidase activity, careful tissue fractionation must first be performed in order to separate the two β-galactosidases. 4. Studies in human intestinal mucosa confirm the existence of a lysosomal β-galactosidase with an acid pH optimum and relative heat stability, and another lactase, presumably of brush border origin."

These changes are similar to those observed in other types of cells in pinocytosis. The reduction in surface cell membrane which accompanies internalization of plasmalemma may be generally significant in the destruction of red cells."

https://openalex.org/W1542002933,"We have shown that a 1:1 complex is formed between polyinosinic acid (I)n and poly-5-bromocytidylic acid (BC)n and have characterized the complex by several spectroscopic methods. We attribute the resolved, longest wave length band in the ultraviolet spectrum to a 5-bromocytidine transition and suggest that the first positive and negative bands in the circular dichroism curve may arise primarily from splitting interaction in the (BC)n chain. The infrared spectrum indicates interaction at the carbonyl groups and shows specificity of base pairing. We have determined the dependence of Tm of (I)n·(BC)n upon BC content of mixed (C, BC)n copolymers and have carried out a comparative study of the effect of organic solvent upon the Tm of (I)n·(C)n and (I)n·(BC)n. The dependence of Tm upon BC content is linear, indicating that the stabilizing effect of bromine residues does not depend significantly upon sequence or Br-Br proximity in the chain. The effect of ethylene glycol upon Tm is similar for both helices, suggesting that differential solvation of C and BC is probably not the source of the stabilizing effect of bromine. We present further experiments and arguments in support of our conclusion that the stabilizing effect of bromine is probably not due to solvent effects or to in-plane I-C interactions within the helix but that it may result instead from the rather high polarizability of Br acting upon cytosine residues in the same chain."

https://openalex.org/W1598961246,"Methods are described for estimation of kinetic constants from the integrated rate equations for a number of reaction mechanisms. In general, these methods depend upon elimination of either zero order or first order terms between rate curves determined at two initial substrate concentrations or more. This operation is followed by graphic or statistical evaluation of the kinetic constants in the simplified equation and substitution of these values back into the original rate equation to permit evaluation of the remaining kinetic constants."

https://openalex.org/W1562117015,Abstract The heat of interaction of sodium warfarin and human plasma albumin has been studied by heatburst microcalorimetry. Sixteen experiments were performed at warfarin concentrations of 0.02 and 0.10% and albumin concentrations of 0.2 and 0.4%. The average heat evolved was -3.14 kcal per mole of warfarin. It is suggested that the molecular basis of the warfarin-albumin interaction is hydrogen and hydrophobic bonding. Microcalorimetry was an ideal method for studying this interaction; the lack of specificity of the thermal method should allow its application to a wide variety of interactions of biological interest.

https://openalex.org/W1521305975,"Abstract A method is described for the study of transport processes in ghosts isolated from rat adipose cells. With this procedure it was possible to follow the time course of potassium uptake, potassium release, and sodium release. The uptake of potassium was stimulated by sodium and was inhibited by ouabain at concentrations down to at least 10-6 m. In the presence of pyruvate (1 mm), potassium uptake showed a more rapid initial increase, and the steady state level was more than doubled. Glucose (5 mm) produced a smaller stimulation of potassium uptake. Cyanide, 2,4-dinitrophenol, or incubation in the cold diminished both potassium uptake and content. Potassium efflux, unlike uptake, was not altered by ouabain or pyruvate; a half-life of 45 min was found. Sodium ion was exchanged but not accumulated by ghosts. Efflux studies showed that sodium was released with a half-life of 10 min. It is concluded that potassium is accumulated by ghosts of fat cells via a sodium-linked, energy-requiring process characteristic of an intact plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1571458087,"Abstract A cell-free system was prepared from Lemna minor L. which carried out the synthesis of d-apiose from UDP-d-glucuronic acid. The d-apiose was derived from the glucuronic acid portion of the sugar nucleotide. Paper co-chromatography and periodate oxidation established that d-apiose had been synthesized. The d-apiose synthesized by this system was not free but was part of a compound whose identity is unknown. Only one d-apiose-containing compound was detected. This compound contained phosphate but did not contain uridine. It could be reisolated unchanged following incubation with alkaline phosphatase. It migrated as an anion at pH 3.7. The compound was not UDP-d-apiose, d-apiose phosphate monoester, or d-apiose."
https://openalex.org/W1991428040,"WE have found that plasma of fasting humans usually contains small amounts of a previously unrecognized ammo-acid which we have tentatively identified as e-N-methyl lysine. We first noted the presence of this compound when we began chromatographing plasma samples from adults with a new automatic amino-acid analyser technique1, which uses an elution gradient of lithium citrate buffers instead of the usual sodium citrate buffers. Our procedure alters the order of emergence of certain amino-acids from the column, and we were surprised to observe the regular appearance on chromatograms of a small unidentified peak between lysine and histidine. 1-Methyl histidine, 3-methyl histidine and the dipeptides anserine and carnosine are all eluted after histidine with our technique, and no known ninhydrin-positive components of plasma should have been eluted between lysine and histidine."

https://openalex.org/W1984644340,"WE have reported a dissociation between antidiuretic and vasopressor activities of vasopressin in the posterior lobe of rat pituitary in vitro1. Posterior pituitaries incubated in Krebs–Ringer bicarbonate glucose lost nearly all antidiuretic activity, although vasopressor activity was reduced only slightly. Antidiuretic activity seemed to have been released into the incubation medium, for there was far less vasopressor than antidiuretic activity in the medium. Thorn could not confirm this discrepancy in the release of the two activities in vitro using slightly different conditions2. We repeated the experiments (unpublished) in 1966 and observed the dissociation, although less marked than originally. When we repeated the work in 1968, we were unable to demonstrate the dissociation, although the experiments were apparently performed in the same conditions as before1. We thought that conditions might have been somewhat different after 2 yr, and decided to investigate some modifications of the conditions in vitro and in vivo."
