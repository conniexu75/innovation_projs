https://openalex.org/W2034291571,"Iron-based catalysts for the oxygen-reduction reaction in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells have been poorly competitive with platinum catalysts, in part because they have a comparatively low number of active sites per unit volume. We produced microporous carbon–supported iron-based catalysts with active sites believed to contain iron cations coordinated by pyridinic nitrogen functionalities in the interstices of graphitic sheets within the micropores. We found that the greatest increase in site density was obtained when a mixture of carbon support, phenanthroline, and ferrous acetate was ball-milled and then pyrolyzed twice, first in argon, then in ammonia. The current density of a cathode made with the best iron-based electrocatalyst reported here can equal that of a platinum-based cathode with a loading of 0.4 milligram of platinum per square centimeter at a cell voltage of ≥0.9 volt."

We have taken advantage of the integration of carbon-14, generated by nuclear bomb tests during the Cold War, into DNA to establish the age of cardiomyocytes in humans. We report that cardiomyocytes renew, with a gradual decrease from 1% turning over annually at the age of 25 to 0.45% at the age of 75. Fewer than 50% of cardiomyocytes are exchanged during a normal life span. The capacity to generate cardiomyocytes in the adult human heart suggests that it may be rational to work toward the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at stimulating this process in cardiac pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W1979769287,"For centuries, scientists have attempted to identify and document analytical laws that underlie physical phenomena in nature. Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the “alphabet” used to describe those systems."

Postgelation control of the gel properties was demonstrated to introduce temporal changes, creation of arbitrarily shaped features, and on-demand pendant functionality release. Channels photodegraded within a hydrogel containing encapsulated cells allow cell migration. Temporal variation of the biochemical gel composition was used to influence chondrogenic differentiation of encapsulated stem cells. Photodegradable gels that allow real-time manipulation of material properties or chemistry provide dynamic environments with the scope to answer fundamental questions about material regulation of live cell function and may affect an array of applications from design of drug delivery vehicles to tissue engineering systems."

Whereas K48-linked chains are well established as mediators of proteasomal degradation, and K63-linked chains act in nonproteolytic events, the roles of unconventional polyubiquitin chains linked through K6, K11, K27, K29, or K33 are not well understood. Here, we report that the unconventional linkages are abundant in vivo and that all non-K63 linkages may target proteins for degradation. Ubiquitin with K48 as the single lysine cannot support yeast viability, and different linkages have partially redundant functions. By profiling both the entire yeast proteome and ubiquitinated proteins in wild-type and ubiquitin K11R mutant strains using mass spectrometry, we identified K11 linkage-specific substrates, including Ubc6, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). Ubc6 primarily synthesizes K11-linked chains, and K11 linkages function in the ERAD pathway. Thus, unconventional polyubiquitin chains are critical for ubiquitin-proteasome system function.

Ubc6 primarily synthesizes K11-linked chains, and K11 linkages function in the ERAD pathway. Thus, unconventional polyubiquitin chains are critical for ubiquitin-proteasome system function. Protein ubiquitination is a highly conserved modification that controls a variety of cellular processes (Kerscher et al., 2006Kerscher O. Felberbaum R. Hochstrasser M. Modification of proteins by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin (Ub) is covalently attached to protein substrates by a cascade of enzymatic reactions involving activating enzymes (E1), conjugating enzymes (E2), and ligases (E3). These reactions generally form an isopeptide bond between the carboxyl group of the C terminus of Ub (G76) and the ɛ-amino group of a lysine residue within the substrates. All seven lysines in Ub contribute to the assembly of polyUb chains, thereby producing a variety of structures with diverse lengths and linkages (Peng et al., 2003bPeng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D. Marsischky G. Roelofs J. Finley D. Gygi S.P. A proteomics approach to understanding protein ubiquitination.Nat.

Biol. 2004; 8: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ubiquitination is reversible through the action of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). The specificity of Ub signaling is mediated by substrate recognition via the E3 ligases, the interaction of Ub moieties (monoUb and polyUb) with Ub receptors, and Ub removal by specific DUBs. More recently, the regulation of Ub pathways by Ub chains bearing distinct polyUb linkages has emerged as an important mechanism. The synthesis of particular polyUb chain linkages appears to be a function of specific E2s and the E2-E3 combinations involved (Jin et al., 2008Jin L. Williamson A. Banerjee S. Philipp I. Rape M.

For example, the Cdc34 E2 generates predominantly K48-linked polyUb products, and its specificity is dependent on an acidic loop region of Cdc34 (Petroski and Deshaies, 2005Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J.

The Mms2/Ubc13 E2 complex preferentially catalyzes the formation of polyUb with K63 linkages, because the structure of Mms2 allows for selective insertion of the K63 side chain of Ub into the Ubc13 active site during chain elongation (Eddins et al., 2006Eddins M.J. Carlile C.M. Gomez K.M. Pickart C.M. Wolberger C. Mms2-Ubc13 covalently bound to ubiquitin reveals the structural basis of linkage-specific polyubiquitin chain formation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The interaction between Ub enzymes and specific surface residues adjacent to the lysine sites in Ub may be important for selection of the docking site during chain assembly (Wang et al., 2006Wang M. Cheng D. Peng J. Pickart C.M. Molecular determinants of polyubiquitin linkage selection by an HECT ubiquitin ligase.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1710-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Indeed, a “TEK-box” in Ub facilitates the formation of K11-linked polyUb by the APC E3 and UbcH10 E2 (Jin et al., 2008Jin L. Williamson A. Banerjee S. Philipp I. Rape M. Mechanism of ubiquitin-chain formation by the human anaphase-promoting complex.Cell. 2008; 133: 653-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Ubiquitinated substrates may be sorted into different pathways based on diverse polyUb structures (Pickart and Fushman, 2004Pickart C.M. Fushman D. Polyubiquitin chains: polymeric protein signals.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Canonical K48-linked polyUb chains are believed to be the principal signal for targeting substrates for degradation by the 26S proteasome, whereas K63-linked chains act in a range of other processes, including protein trafficking, DNA repair, and inflammation. Monoubiquitination also functions as a nonproteolytic signal. However, the prevalence of other polyUb topologies and their roles in biological processes are not well understood, in spite of a few intriguing observations. K6 linkages catalyzed by the BRCA1/BARD1 E3 might regulate DNA repair (Nishikawa et al., 2004Nishikawa H. Ooka S. Sato K. Arima K. Okamoto J. Klevit R.E. Fukuda M. Ohta T.

Chem. 2004; 279: 3916-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). K11 linkages were suggested to support proteasomal degradation of certain protein targets (Baboshina and Haas, 1996Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. Novel multiubiquitin chain linkages catalyzed by the conjugating enzymes E2EPF and RAD6 are recognized by 26 S proteasome subunit 5.J. Biol.

Quantitative analysis of in vitro ubiquitinated cyclin B1 reveals complex chain topology.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Both K27 and K33 linkages may be assembled by U-box-type E3 ligases during stress response (Hatakeyama et al., 2001Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Nakayama K.I. U box proteins as a new family of ubiquitin-protein ligases.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Finally, K29-linked chains may participate in Ub fusion degradation (Johnson et al., 1995Johnson E.S. Ma P.C. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. A proteolytic pathway that recognizes ubiquitin as a degradation signal.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). In the present study, we combined genetic and proteomic approaches to systematically study the function of different polyUb linkages in the yeast S. cerevisiae. Our data revealed unexpectedly high levels of unconventional polyUb linkages on a broad range of substrates in cells. We found that proteasomal degradation is mediated by all non-K63 polyUb linkages in vivo. K11 linkages preferentially modify a subset of protein substrates and play an important role in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). To analyze the level of polyUb linkages by mass spectrometry (MS), we employed an isotope dilution method (Kirkpatrick et al., 2006Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J. Finley D. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Quantitative analysis of in vitro ubiquitinated cyclin B1 reveals complex chain topology.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, Xu et al., 2006Xu P. Cheng D. Duong D.M. Rush J. Roelofs J. Finley D. Peng J. A proteomic strategy for quantifying polyubiquitin chain topologies.Isr. J. Chem. 2006; 46: 171-182Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which uses heavy isotope-labeled peptides as internal standards for lighter versions of unlabeled, native linkage-specific peptides that are generated during trypsin digestion of Ub polymers (Figure 1A, Table S1 available online). Ubiquitinated proteins are usually isolated from yeast cells by affinity purification and digested by trypsin, during which Ub is trimmed to a tag of two Gly residues (GG, monoisotopic mass of 114.0429 Da, Figure 1A) attached to the modified Lys side chains of remnant peptides of Ub itself or non-Ub proteins (Peng et al., 2003bPeng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D. Marsischky G. Roelofs J. Finley D. Gygi S.P. A proteomics approach to understanding protein ubiquitination.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). Therefore, the abundance of specific Ub-Ub linkages is represented by the level of the corresponding GG-tagged tryptic peptides. The chemical properties of the labeled standards are indistinguishable from those of native peptides, but, being different in mass, the labeled and unlabeled peptides are resolved by MS, allowing for quantitation of the native peptides. Using chemically synthesized, heavy isotope-labeled, GG-tagged peptides as references, we found that the concentration of K48 linkages is 7.3 ± 0.3 picomoles per milligram protein in log-phase yeast cell lysate. There is a striking and unexpectedly high abundance of the unconventional non-K48 linkages, especially K11 linkages. Based on the absolute quantification of all seven linkages (a sum of 100%), the percent abundance of individual linkages is 10.9% ± 1.9% (K6), 28.0% ± 1.4% (K11), 9.0% ± 0.1% (K27), 3.2% ± 0.1% (K29), 3.5% ± 0.1% (K33), 29.1% ± 1.9% (K48), and 16.3% ± 0.2% (K63). Thus, unconventional Ub chains form a major component of the conjugated Ub pool. We further developed a more precise method to quantify polyUb linkages using stable-isotope labeled cells/proteins instead of peptides (Figures 1A and 1B), and found that levels of monoUb and all seven Ub-Ub linkages are essentially unchanged as a function of cell growth stage (Table S2). When monoUb pool was augmented ∼10-fold by induction in yeast, all seven polyUb linkages were increased, but to varying levels (3- to 12-fold, Figure S1 and Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Results), suggesting that the seven polyUb linkages display different kinetics of synthesis and disassembly. To investigate the potential physiological roles of the abundant unconventional polyUb chains compared with K48-linked chains, we analyzed the change in these linkages during proteasomal inhibition. After treatment with MG132 proteasome inhibitor, bulk Ub conjugates accumulated, leveling off after ∼2 hr (Figure 1C). When the MG132 concentration was increased from 10 to 1000 μM, ubiquitinated species accumulated in a dose-dependent manner, almost reaching saturation at ∼100 μM. The Ub conjugate levels also markedly increased in the presence of 30 μM of PS341, a more potent and specific proteasome inhibitor. MS analyses indicated that MG132 (100 μM) and PS341 (30 μM) had similar effects on the level of polyUb linkages (Figures 1D and S2, Table S2). After 2 hr treatment, K48 linkages increased ∼8-fold; K6, K11, and K29 linkages 4- to 5-fold; and K27 and K33 linkages ∼2-fold. In contrast, K63 linkages did not change significantly. When MG132 was administrated at a level (30 μM) causing incomplete proteasomal inhibition, all non-K63 linkages also accumulated, though to a lesser degree (Table S2). These data indicate that the levels of all non-K63 polyUb chains are inversely correlated with the proteolytic activity of the proteasome. Substrates modified by such chains might therefore be targeted to the proteasome. To test the apparent involvement of unconventional polyUb chains in proteasomal targeting, we further measured levels of polyUb linkages in yeast strains carrying mutations in components of the Ub-proteasome system. We first developed a method that used total cell lysate directly, rather than Ub conjugates purified by nickel affinity chromatography, because these strains only express untagged Ub (Figure 1A). With this method, we were able to detect only the three most abundant linkages (K11, K48, and K63), the other linkages being undetectable because of their lower concentrations and the greater protein complexity in total cell lysate versus purified Ub conjugates. Single-gene deletions of proteasomal subunits (sem1Δ or pre9Δ) or proteasome assembly factors (pba3Δ or pba4Δ) caused comparable increases of K11 linkages (∼1.8-fold) and K48 linkages (∼2.4-fold, Figure 1E, Table S2). Similarly, deletion of Ub receptors Dsk2 or Rad23, both of which deliver Ub conjugates to the proteasome, raised the level of K11 (∼2.0-fold) and K48 (∼1.8-fold) linkages, and the double deletion had a more dramatic effect (K11, 2.9-fold; K48, 2.8-fold; Figure 1F). In all of these mutant strains, K63 linkages remained constant. The data strongly support the possibility that both K11- and K48-linked chains are targeting signals for the proteasome. In addition, we analyzed the abundance of K11, K48, and K63 linkages in yeast strains containing mutations in DUB genes (Figure 2A). Consistent with previous results that deletion of proteasome-associated Ubp6 caused little accumulation of high molecular weight ubiquitinated proteins (Amerik et al., 2000aAmerik A.Y. Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Analysis of the deubiquitinating enzymes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 981-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we did not observe large changes in the three linkages. In contrast, in doa4Δ strain, K11 and K48 linkages were markedly decreased (5-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively), probably because of Ub depletion (Swaminathan et al., 1999Swaminathan S. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. The Doa4 deubiquitinating enzyme is required for ubiquitin homeostasis in yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2583-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), whereas K63 linkages showed a small increase (1.3-fold) despite the decrease of overall Ub levels, in agreement with the role of Doa4 in membrane trafficking that involves K63-linked polyUb chains (Amerik et al., 2000bAmerik A.Y. Nowak J. Swaminathan S. Hochstrasser M. The Doa4 deubiquitinating enzyme is functionally linked to the vacuolar protein-sorting and endocytic pathways.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3365-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Loss of the UBP2 gene, encoding another DUB that has preference for K63 linkages and regulates protein sorting efficiency (Kee et al., 2006Kee Y. Munoz W. Lyon N. Huibregtse J.M. The deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp2 modulates Rsp5-dependent lys63-linked polyubiquitin conjugates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36724-36731Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), raised the level of K63 linkages (1.8-fold) but also increased K48 linkages (1.9-fold). Loss of UBP14, a DUB that cleaves unanchored polyUb chains with various linkages (Amerik et al., 2000aAmerik A.Y. Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Analysis of the deubiquitinating enzymes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 981-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), resulted in higher amount of all three linkages (1.2- to 1.7-fold). These results suggest that distinct DUBs have specific Ub-Ub linkage preferences in vivo. The patterns of polyUb linkages in the DUB mutants are also different from that in the above proteasome-defective cells, supporting the nondegradative role for K63-linked chains and the function of other linkages in degradation. If the unconventional polyUb chains direct proteins for proteasomal degradation, the Ub in these chains could be recycled by deubiquitinating activities associated with the proteasome complex. To test this idea, we set up an in vitro deubiquitinating assay using purified native Ub conjugates (Figure 2B) and 26S proteasome (Figure 2C). The purified Ub conjugates were not disassembled without the addition of proteasome, indicating that the Ub conjugates had little contamination by active DUBs or other proteases (Figure 2D). When the conjugates were incubated with the 26S in the presence of ATP, Ub conjugate levels were dramatically decreased (Figure 2E), suggesting that polyUb chains were disassembled by the action of the 26S proteasome. This process was obstructed by the addition of MG132 (Figure 2F), probably because it inhibits the proteasome core particle and indirectly interferes with the deubiquitinating activity of a proteasome subunit Rpn11 (Jin et al., 2008Jin L. Williamson A. Banerjee S. Philipp I. Rape M. Mechanism of ubiquitin-chain formation by the human anaphase-promoting complex.Cell. 2008; 133: 653-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In addition, this deubiquitination was also sensitive to high-salt treatment (Figure 2F), which inactivates the 26S-associated DUBs, such as Rpn11 (Verma et al., 2002Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates 3rd, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Role of Rpn11 metalloprotease in deubiquitination and degradation by the 26S proteasome.Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) and USP14 (a mammalian homolog of yeast Ubp6) (Leggett et al., 2002Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Multiple associated proteins regulate proteasome structure and function.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that all seven linkages were cleaved by proteasome-associated DUBs, but to different extents, with K48 linkages hydrolyzed most readily (Figure 2G). All these data further confirm that unconventional polyUb linkages can be recognized and disassembled in the 26S proteasome. Although these unconventional polyUb chains are abundant in the cell and appear to function as signals for proteasomal degradation, only the K48R substitution in Ub is lethal in yeast, and the K27R mutation causes a small growth defect (Spence et al., 1995Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. A ubiquitin mutant with specific defects in DNA repair and multiubiquitination.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether polyUb chains with unconventional linkages have redundant functions by combining mutations in non-K48 lysine residues and testing yeast survival. We generated a series of yeast Ub mutant strains, including single (R11 or R27), double (R11R63), triple (R11R27R63), and quadruple (R6R11R27R63) lysine substitutions (Figure S3A). We also attempted to make a strain expressing a sextuple Ub mutant (R6R11R27R29R33R63) with K48 as the single lysine but failed in spite of extensive screening (Figure S3B), suggesting that Ub with K48 alone cannot support viability in yeast. To confirm that Ub with K48 as the lone lysine is not sufficient for yeast survival, we used a strategy to switch expression from wild-type to mutant Ub genes in yeast and then examined cell growth (Figure 3A). We constructed yeast strains that maintained two plasmids: one expressing wild-type Ub from galactose-inducible GAL10 promoter, and the other expressing individual Ub mutants under the constitutive CUP1 promoter (Figure 3A). In synthetic galactose media, Ub genes on both plasmids were actively transcribed. Switching to glucose media suppressed the expression of wild-type Ub, whereas the mutant gene was still expressed as the only source of ubiquitin. When Ub-K48R was introduced into the strain, it could not support growth (Figure 3B), confirming that Ub-K48 is an essential residue (Finley et al., 1994Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. Chau V. Inhibition of proteolysis and cell cycle progression in a multiubiquitination-deficient yeast mutant.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5501-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). More importantly, expressing the single-lysine Ub (K48 alone) also resulted in a complete deficiency in cell growth (Figure 3B), and the culture's growth curve was indistinguishable from that of the Ub-K48R strain (Figure S3D). These data indicate that Ub with K48 as its only lysine is not sufficient to sustain yeast growth, underscoring the physiological significance of non-K48 lysine residues. To rescue viability of the K48-only Ub mutant, restitution of K29 and K33 (R6R11R27R63 strain) is sufficient. However, this mutant exhibited severely retarded growth (Figure 3B). The growth curves of various lysine mutant strains in rich medium (YPD) were further compared (Figure 3C). The order of growth rates was WT = R11 = R11R63 > R27 > R11R27R63 > R6R11R27R63, suggesting that the mutations have a cumulative effect on cell proliferation. To eliminate the possibility that the mutations affected the stability of ubiquitin, thereby reducing the availability of Ub for conjugation, we examined the level of Ub and its conjugates in all strains by western blotting. In spite of a slight increase in Ub conjugates in the quadruple mutant, all strains showed comparable levels of Ub monomer and conjugates (Figure 3D). Thus, the lethal effect of mutating combinations of non-K48 lysines is unlikely to have resulted from a general defect in conjugate formation. However, this does not rule out subtle functional defects not related to the formation of specific chains. To examine potential interdependence of the different Ub-Ub linkages, we used MS to measure the changes in the polyUb linkage levels in the Ub mutants (Figure 3E). Neither R11 nor R11R63 affected cell growth, and they had little effect on the abundance of other linkages (<2-fold). K27R replacement influenced linkages only at the nearby lysines K29 (1.9-fold) and K33 (4.7-fold). The triple substitution mutant (R11R27R63) dramatically reduced cell growth and increased K48 (1.6-fold), K29 (3.8-fold), and K33 (7.0-fold) linkages. Additional mutation of K6 resulted in a further increase in the utilization of the remaining sites (K48, 3.9-fold; K29, 6.1-fold; and K33, 22.2-fold). These results indicate that the physiological roles of these lysine residues are partially redundant, and thus the growth defects are cumulative when more lysine residues are mutated. Conversely, concomitant increases of polyUb linkages at the remaining lysines occur but do not support wild-type growth rate. This suggests that different polyUb linkages may modify specific substrates and have unique functions (unnaturally high levels of alternative Ub-Ub linkages might be deleterious as well; see Discussion). Since K11 Ub-Ub isopeptide bonds are as abundant as K48 linkages in vivo but are not nearly as well characterized, we sought to identify K11 polyUb chain-linked substrates by comparing R11 and wild-type strains using a quantitative MS strategy, termed stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) (Ong et al., 2002Ong S.E.

Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (4314) Google Scholar). R11 and wild-type cells were differentially labeled in light and heavy stable isotope media, mixed after harvesting, and then used for the purification of Ub conjugates under denaturing conditions (Figure 4A). Proteins from total cell lysate and Ub conjugates were both resolved on an SDS gel, excised from the gel, digested by trypsin, and analyzed by reverse phase liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS, Figure 4B). This resulted in the quantification of 1576 proteins in the total lysate (Table S3), and 347 Ub conjugate candidates with at least two assigned peptides. Because samples enriched for Ub conjugates can still be contaminated by unmodified proteins, we developed an algorithm to construct “virtual western blot” images of every identified protein (Figures 5C and 5D) to evaluate whether the protein is likely to be ubiquitinated based on the large mobility shift expected from the polyUb tag (Seyfried et al., 2008Seyfried N.T. Xu P. Duong D.M. Cheng D. Hanfelt J. Peng J. Systematic approach for validating the ubiquitinated proteome.Anal. Chem. 2008; 80: 4161-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Ultimately, out of the 347 candidates, we accepted 75 Ub conjugates, 37 (49%) of which were also quantified in the total cell lysate (Table S4). Comparison of the accepted Ub conjugates to the proteins in the total cell lysate revealed that the K11R substitution caused a small, global decrease in ubiquitination (main peak for the Ub conjugates in Figure 4C) and markedly inhibited the ubiquitination of a subset of proteins (shoulder in the histogram of Ub conjugates; Figure 4C). Moreover, out of the 1576 proteins in the cell lysate, 91 proteins showed statistically significant changes in abundance (absolute log2 ratio at least 0.8 and signal-to-noise ratio >1.5, Figure S4E, Table S3). Gene ontology classification (Ashburner et al., 2000Ashburner M. Ball C.A. Blake J.A. Botstein D. Butler H. Cherry J.M. Davis A.P. Dolinski K. Dwight S.S.

The disruption of this dynamic equilibrium may herald cell injury or death and may contribute to developmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Nitric oxide functions as a signaling molecule, but in excess it mediates neuronal injury, in part via mitochondrial fission or fragmentation. However, the underlying mechanism for nitric oxide–induced pathological fission remains unclear. We found that nitric oxide produced in response to β-amyloid protein, thought to be a key mediator of Alzheimer's disease, triggered mitochondrial fission, synaptic loss, and neuronal damage, in part via S-nitrosylation of dynamin-related protein 1 (forming SNO-Drp1). Preventing nitrosylation of Drp1 by cysteine mutation abrogated these neurotoxic events. SNO-Drp1 is increased in brains of human Alzheimer's disease patients and may thus contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration."

We present here a 947-year-long multidecadal North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) reconstruction and find a persistent positive NAO during the MCA. Supplementary reconstructions based on climate model results and proxy data indicate a clear shift to weaker NAO conditions into the Little Ice Age (LIA).

In yeast, this ability allows them to act as non-Mendelian elements of phenotypic inheritance. To further our understanding of prion biology, we conducted a bioinformatic proteome-wide survey for prionogenic proteins in S. cerevisiae, followed by experimental investigations of 100 prion candidates. We found an unexpected amino acid bias in aggregation-prone candidates and discovered that 19 of these could also form prions. At least one of these prion proteins, Mot3, produces a bona fide prion in its natural context that increases population-level phenotypic heterogeneity. The self-perpetuating states of these proteins present a vast source of heritable phenotypic variation that increases the adaptability of yeast populations to diverse environments."

Rare mutations in Nurr1 are associated with familial Parkinson's disease, but the underlying basis for this relationship has not been established. Here, we demonstrate that Nurr1 unexpectedly functions to inhibit expression of pro-inflammatory neurotoxic mediators in both microglia and astrocytes. Reduced Nurr1 expression results in exaggerated inflammatory responses in microglia that are further amplified by astrocytes, leading to the production of factors that cause death of tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neurons. Nurr1 exerts anti-inflammatory effects by docking to NF-κB-p65 on target inflammatory gene promoters in a signal-dependent manner. Subsequently, Nurr1 recruits the CoREST corepressor complex, resulting in clearance of NF-κB-p65 and transcriptional repression.

These studies suggest that Nurr1 protects against loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease in part by limiting the production of neurotoxic mediators by microglia and astrocytes. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most prevalent movement disorder among people over 65 years old. Denervation of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) results in severely debilitating motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremor and rigidity (Farrer, 2006Farrer M.J.

Ageing and Parkinson's disease: substantia nigra regional selectivity.Brain. 1991; 114: 2283-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (2461) Google Scholar). Although the etiologies of most common forms of PD remain poorly understood, the disease is generally associated with an inflammatory component that is manifested in part by the presence of activated microglia (central nervous system-resident macrophages) and elevated serum or cerebrospinal fluid levels of pro-inflammatory factors (Block et al., 2007Block M.L.

Several lines of evidence suggest that inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, nitric oxide (NO) and Interleukin (IL)-1β derived from nonneuronal cells, including microglia, modulate the progression of PD (Brown, 2007Brown G.C.

Inflammation as a causative factor in the aetiology of Parkinson's disease.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 150: 963-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Whether inflammation is an initiating factor of PD in humans is unclear, but intracranial infusion of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a ligand for Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 and a potent activator of microglia, is sufficient to induce the loss of TH+ neurons in rodents (Meredith et al., 2008Meredith G.E. Sonsalla P.K. Chesselet M.F. Animal models of Parkinson's disease progression.Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 2008; 115: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). LPS-induced inflammation can also synergize with α-Synuclein and Parkin mutations associated with familial PD to potentiate the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+ neurons in animal models (Frank-Cannon et al., 2008Frank-Cannon T.C. Tran T. Ruhn K.A. Martinez T.N. Hong J. Marvin M. Hartley M. Trevino I. O'Brien D.E. Casey B. et al.Parkin deficiency increases vulnerability to inflammation-related nigral degeneration.J.

Neuroinflammation and oxidation/nitration of α-synuclein linked to dopaminergic neurodegeneration.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 7687-7698Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the possibility that environmental factors, such as infection, may interact with common but less penetrant susceptibility genes to influence the onset of most commonly observed sporadic PD cases (Tansey et al., 2007Tansey M.G. McCoy M.K. Frank-Cannon T.C. Neuroinflammatory mechanisms in Parkinson's disease: potential environmental triggers, pathways, and targets for early therapeutic intervention.Exp. Neurol. 2007; 208: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). TLRs induce inflammatory gene expression by regulating the activities and expression of signal-dependent transcription factors that include members of the NF-κB, AP-1 and IRF families (Kawai and Akira, 2007Kawai T. Akira S. TLR signaling.Semin. Immunol. 2007; 19: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). The TLRs play essential roles in innate immune responses to microbial pathogens based on their ability to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (Akira et al., 2006Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Pathogen recognition and innate immunity.Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8085) Google Scholar, Medzhitov, 2007Medzhitov R. Recognition of microorganisms and activation of the immune response.Nature. 2007; 449: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). More recently, genetic loss-of-function experiments in mice have shown that TLRs contribute to the pathogenesis of a number of diseases in which inflammation is known to play a pathogenic role, including atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and liver fibrosis (Atkinson, 2008Atkinson T.J. Toll-like receptors, transduction-effector pathways, and disease diversity: evidence of an immunobiological paradigm explaining all human illness?.Int. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 27: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with TLRs being able to signal in response to the generation of endogenously derived ligands, such as components of necrotic cells. Nurr1 (NR4A2) belongs to the nuclear receptor (NR)4 family of orphan nuclear receptors and is known to function as a constitutively active transcription factor by binding to target genes as a monomer, homodimer or heterodimer with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) (Aarnisalo et al., 2002Aarnisalo P. Kim C.H. Lee J.W. Perlmann T. Defining requirements for heterodimerization between the retinoid X receptor and the orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1.J. Biol.

Structure and function of Nurr1 identifies a class of ligand-independent nuclear receptors.Nature. 2003; 423: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Deletion of the Nurr1 gene in mice results in a severe reduction in dopaminergic neurons and perinatal lethality (Zetterstrom et al., 1997Zetterstrom R.H. Solomin L. Jansson L. Hoffer B.J. Olson L. Perlmann T. Dopamine neuron agenesis in Nurr1-deficient mice.Science. 1997; 276: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), consistent with an essential role for Nurr1 in the development and/or maintenance of dopaminergic neurons. Human mutations resulting in reduced expression of Nurr1 are associated with late-onset familial PD (Le et al., 2003Le W.D. Xu P. Jankovic J. Jiang H. Appel S.H. Smith R.G. Vassilatis D.K. Mutations in NR4A2 associated with familial Parkinson disease.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), indicating that Nurr1 may play a protective role. Nurr1 is also expressed in nonneuronal cell types and Nurr1 mRNA is induced by inflammatory stimuli, including LPS, in macrophages (Barish et al., 2005Barish G.D. Downes M. Alaynick W.A. Yu R.T. Ocampo C.B. Bookout A.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. A Nuclear Receptor Atlas: macrophage activation.Mol.

Induction of NR4A orphan nuclear receptor expression in macrophages in response to inflammatory stimuli.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29256-29262Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, recent observations suggest that members of the NR4 family can function as both activators and repressors of cell type-specific inflammatory responses. For instance, Nurr1 suppresses expression of inflammatory response genes in human macrophages that are implicated in the development of arthrosclerosis (Bonta et al., 2006Bonta P.I. van Tiel C.M. Vos M. Pols T.W. van Thienen J.V. Ferreira V. Arkenbout E.K. Seppen J. Spek C.A. van der Poll T. et al.Nuclear receptors Nur77, Nurr1, and NOR-1 expressed in atherosclerotic lesion macrophages reduce lipid loading and inflammatory responses.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 2288-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In contrast, Nurr1 promotes the development of mouse and human Th17 T cells that contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (Doi et al., 2008Doi Y. Oki S. Ozawa T. Hohjoh H. Miyake S. Yamamura T. Orphan nuclear receptor NR4A2 expressed in T cells from multiple sclerosis mediates production of inflammatory cytokines.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 8381-8386Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which Nurr1 controls transcriptional activation or repression of inflammatory responses have not been established, and the potential impact of Nurr1 function on the inflammatory component of PD has not been evaluated. Here, we present evidence that Nurr1 plays an essential role in both microglia and astrocytes as a signal-dependent transcriptional repressor of genes that encode pro-inflammatory neurotoxic factors. Nurr1 functions as a key component of a negative feedback loop in both microglia and astrocytes by recruiting CoREST corepressor complexes to NF-κB target genes. CoREST complexes, in turn, mediate the turnover of NF-κB and restore activated gene expression to a basal state. Loss of Nurr1 function in extraneuronal cells of the SN results in exaggerated and prolonged inflammatory responses that accelerate the loss of dopaminergic neurons in response to LPS or overexpression of a mutant form of α-Synuclein (A30P) associated with familial PD (Kruger et al., 1998Kruger R. Kuhn W. Muller T. Woitalla D. Graeber M. Kosel S. Przuntek H. Epplen J.T. Schols L. Riess O. Ala30Pro mutation in the gene encoding alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease.Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3160) Google Scholar). Studies demonstrating that Nurr1 mRNA is upregulated by LPS in macrophages (Barish et al., 2005Barish G.D. Downes M. Alaynick W.A. Yu R.T. Ocampo C.B. Bookout A.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. A Nuclear Receptor Atlas: macrophage activation.Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2466-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, Pei et al., 2005Pei L. Castrillo A. Chen M. Hoffmann A. Tontonoz P. Induction of NR4A orphan nuclear receptor expression in macrophages in response to inflammatory stimuli.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29256-29262Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) raised the question of whether it might also be expressed in nonneuronal cells and influence the development of PD. Analysis of Nurr1 protein and mRNA levels in primary human and mouse microglia, primary human astrocytes, and the BV2 microglia cell line demonstrated significant protein expression under basal conditions and induction of Nurr1 mRNA in microglia in response to LPS (see Figures S1A–S1E available with this article online and data not shown). Similarly, Nurr1 protein colocalized with the microglia marker F4/80 (Figure S2E) and Nurr1 mRNA was induced approximately 2-fold in the SN 6 hr following stereotaxic injection of LPS (Figure S1F). To investigate the potential role of Nurr1 in PD pathology, we evaluated the impact of reducing Nurr1 expression. Since Nurr1-deficient mice die shortly after birth, we performed stereotaxic injections of lentiviruses encoding two independent shRNAs against Nurr1 (shNurr1-1 and shNurr1-2) or control shRNA (shCtrl) into the SN of adult wild-type mice (Figure S2A). shNurr1-1 and −2 efficiently and specifically reduced Nurr1 mRNA and protein expression in the SN, as determined by qPCR and immunostaining (Figures S2B–S2E). A comparison of lentivirus-directed GFP expression with cell-specific markers indicated preferential transduction of nonneuronal cells, including microglia and astrocytes (Figure S2G). The lentiviral injection was followed two days later by injection of LPS into the same coordinates. We then analyzed the magnitude of the inflammatory response by qPCR 6 hr after LPS injection and quantified TH+ neurons by immunohistochemistry (IHC) 7 days after LPS injection. Loss of TH+ neurons following LPS injection normally takes 2–3 weeks (Meredith et al., 2008Meredith G.E. Sonsalla P.K. Chesselet M.F. Animal models of Parkinson's disease progression.Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 2008; 115: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, stereological analysis revealed a significant decrease in TH+ neurons in the SN of shNurr1 lentivirus-injected mice compared to shCtrl-injected animals after only 7 days of LPS treatment (Figures 1A and 1B). Interestingly, a pathological morphology of TH+ neurons with reduced or absent processes and alterations in the size and shape of the cells was observed more often in the shNurr1 groups (Figures S2E and 1B). In addition, pathological TH+ cells were observed close to activated microglia (Figure S2F). The accelerated loss of TH+ neurons following Nurr1 knockdown required LPS injection, as it was not observed in buffer (PBS)-injected animals (Figure 1C and D). In addition, LPS injection was associated with detection of caspase-3 cleavage, suggesting that loss of TH+ cells was due to cell death rather than to loss of TH expression (Figure S2G) (Sakurada et al., 1999Sakurada K. Ohshima-Sakurada M. Palmer T.D. Gage F.H. Nurr1, an orphan nuclear receptor, is a transcriptional activator of endogenous tyrosine hydroxylase in neural progenitor cells derived from the adult brain.Development. 1999; 126: 4017-4026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of Nurr1 expression in the SN also resulted in exaggerated expression of inflammatory mediators in response to LPS injection, including iNOS, TNFα and IL1β (Figures 1E–1G). We also examined whether Nurr1 exerted neuro-protective effects in the context of overexpression of an α−Synuclein mutant (A30P) associated with familial PD by combining stereotaxic injection of shNurr1- or shCtrl-lentivirus with a lentivirus encoding mutant α−Synuclein (A30P). A30P expression alone caused weak inflammation in the SN, whereas reduction of Nurr1 expression in the context of A30P expression resulted in a dramatic increase in expression of numerous inflammatory response genes, including TNFα and IL1β, and significant loss of TH+ neurons (Figures S3A–S3C and data not shown). In concert, these experiments indicate that Nurr1 limits inflammatory responses in the CNS and protects TH+ neurons from LPS- and α-Synuclein (A30P)-induced toxicity. To define the cell types responsible for LPS-mediated inflammation in the SN, we evaluated the responses of human and mouse microglia, astrocytes and neurons to LPS. These experiments demonstrated that microglia are orders of magnitude more responsive than astrocytes or neurons, exemplified by the pattern of TNFα induction in primary mouse and human microglia and astrocytes and the neuronal Neuro2A (mouse neuroblastoma) cell line (Figures 2A and S4F). These results are consistent with the expression patterns of TLR4, coreceptors and down-stream signaling molecules in neurons and glial cells (Figures S4A–S4E). Although, TLR4 expression was virtually absent from the neuronal cell lines examined, we tested whether LPS could directly induce the death of these cells. Three different neuronal cell lines, Neuro2A, SK-N-SH and PC12, were incubated with LPS for 24h. No significant cell death was observed by TUNEL assay or caspase-3 cleavage, in contrast to the effects of TNFα plus cyclohexamide (CHX) treatment (Figures 2B and S4G). In addition, knockdown of Nurr1 in Neuro2A cells did not increase the sensitivity to LPS or death signaling (TNFα plus CHX) as determined by TUNEL assay (Figure 2C). Based on these results, we evaluated the consequences of reducing Nurr1 expression in microglia on LPS responses. Knockdown of Nurr1 expression in BV2 microglia using specific lentivirus-encoded shRNAs led to significant increases in LPS-dependent expression of inflammatory mediators, including TNFα, iNOS and IL-1β (Figures 2D–2F). Similar results were observed in the primary mouse (Figure S5 and S6A–C) and human (data not shown) microglia. To explore whether loss of Nurr1 in microglia resulted in secretion of mediators exhibiting preferential toxicity for TH+ neurons, we knocked down Nurr1 expression using lentivirus-encoded shRNAs in BV2 cells and tested the activity of conditioned media (CM) after LPS stimulation on in vitro differentiated neurons and glial cells derived from mouse neuronal stem cells (NSC). CM from shNurr1-BV2 cells resulted in the death of nearly all TH+ neurons, with a significantly smaller effect on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-positive neurons and no significant effect on glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astroglial cells (Figure 2G–I). Experiments using neuron and glia coculture in vitro suggest that activation of innate immunity in the CNS can trigger neuronal death (Lehnardt et al., 2003Lehnardt S. Massillon L. Follett P. Jensen F.E. Ratan R. Rosenberg P.A. Volpe J.J. Vartanian T. Activation of innate immunity in the CNS triggers neurodegeneration through a Toll-like receptor 4-dependent pathway.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 8514-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Since NSC-derived neurons always coexist with astrocytes, it is possible that astrocytes contributed to the neurotoxic effect of the microglia CM. To explore this possibility, we performed sequential CM experiments employing isolated primary microglia and astrocytes and using Neuro2A cells as a read-out for neurotoxicity. Primary murine astrocytes and microglia were infected with shCtrl- or shNurr1-lentivirus used for the injection into the SN. Cells were then stimulated with LPS and CM was harvested as described in Figure 2G. CM of microglia infected with shNurr1 induced significant cell death in Neuro2A cultures, whereas CM of astrocytes infected with shNurr1 had much less effect on the death of Neuro2A cells. Intriguingly, sequential conditioning of media from microglia to astrocytes indicated that astrocytes significantly amplified the production of neurotoxic factors when exposed to microglia-conditioned media (Figure 2J lane 2 to lane 6 and 7). This effect was further increased when expression of Nurr1 was reduced in astrocytes (Figure 2J lane 3 to lane 8 and 9). We conclude that microglia are the initial responders to LPS-mediated inflammation and that astrocytes amplify the production of neurotoxic factors after the microglial activation. The knockdown of Nurr1 in either microglia or astrocytes increases the toxicity of CM, suggesting that Nurr1 inhibits the production of neurotoxic factors in both cell types. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments indicated that Nurr1 was recruited to LPS-responsive promoters following LPS treatment, exemplified by the TNFα promoter (Figure 3A), suggesting that it was acting locally to repress transcription. Two different general mechanisms of NR-mediated repression have been described: active repression, involving sequence-specific DNA binding, and transrepression, involving tethering of NRs to negatively regulated target genes via protein-protein interactions (Glass and Ogawa, 2006Glass C.K. Ogawa S. Combinatorial roles of nuclear receptors in inflammation and immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). A mutant of Nurr1 (Nurr1C280A/E281A, CEAA), defective for sequence-specific DNA binding and unable to activate NGFI-B responsive element (NBRE)-luciferase, a reporter for Nurr1 monomer-binding, was fully able to repress iNOS induction by LPS (Figures 3B and S6D). In addition, mutations directed at the heterodimerization (I-box) domain (Aarnisalo et al., 2002Aarnisalo P. Kim C.H. Lee J.W. Perlmann T. Defining requirements for heterodimerization between the retinoid X receptor and the orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1.J. Biol.

On the other hand, this I-box mutation increased transcriptional activation of Nurr1 monomers through the NBRE element, as previously reported (Aarnisalo et al., 2002Aarnisalo P. Kim C.H. Lee J.W. Perlmann T. Defining requirements for heterodimerization between the retinoid X receptor and the orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35118-35123Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (Figure S6D). We conclude that Nurr1 inhibits LPS responses by a transrepression mechanism. SUMOylation of NRs has recently been established to play important roles in transrepression (Pascual et al., 2005Pascual G. Fong A.L. Ogawa S. Gamliel A. Li A.C. Perissi V. Rose D.W. Willson T.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. A SUMOylation-dependent pathway mediates transrepression of inflammatory response genes by PPAR-γ.Nature. 2005; 437: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Since it is known that Nurr1 interacts with the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) 4 (Galleguillos et al., 2004Galleguillos D. Vecchiola A. Fuentealba J.A. Ojeda V. Alvarez K. Gomez A. Andres M.E. PIASγ represses the transcriptional activation induced by the nuclear receptor Nurr1.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2005-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which is a SUMO E3 ligase, we examined whether SUMOylation is also involved in Nurr1-mediated repression. As shown in Figure 3C, knockdown of Ubc9, an essential E2 enzyme for SUMOylation (Hay, 2005Hay R.T. SUMO: a history of modification.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar), reversed Nurr1-mediated repression of iNOS, suggesting that SUMOylation is required. Next, we confirmed that Nurr1 could be SUMOylated with SUMO2 and SUMO3 using PIAS4 as an E3 ligase (Figure S6E and F) and found that IL1β stimulation could induce SUMOylation of Nurr1 in the absence of overexpression of PIAS4 (Figure S6F). Mutational studies demonstrated that lysine 558 and, to a lesser extent lysine 576, are essential SUMO sites of Nurr1 (Figure 3D). Since both K558R and K576R mutants are located in the ligand binding domain and close to the I-box and RXR is not required for repression activity (Figure 3B and Figure S6D), we hypothesize that SUMOylation is required for monomerization of Nurr1. Consistent with this, K558R and K576R mutants were less able to activate the NBRE reporter and preferentially activated the DR5 reporter (Figure S6G). In addition, reconstitution of BV2 microglia cells expressing the Nurr1 shRNA-2 with a nontargeted (NT) form of WT Nurr1 reversed hyperactivation of the endogenous iNOS and TNFα genes, while the nontargeted forms of the SUMOylation mutants (Nurr1 K558R and K576R) did not (Figures 3E and S6H and S6I). Since transrepression requires the tethering of NRs to other transcription factors, we tested whether Nurr1 could bind to transcription factors involved in inflammation, such as NF-κB. Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays of Nurr1 in BV2 cells showed interaction with NF-κB-p65 that was significantly enhanced by LPS treatment and independent of changes in Nurr1 protein levels (Figures 3F and S6A). Phosphorylation of Serine-468 (S468) in p65 is associated with negative regulation of NF-κB signaling (Buss et al., 2004Buss H. Dorrie A. Schmitz M.L. Frank R. Livingstone M. Resch K. Kracht M. Phosphorylation of serine 468 by GSK-3β negatively regulates basal p65 NF-κB activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49571-49574Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and can be mediated by GSK3β, which is activated following TLR4 stimulation in human monocytes (Martin et al., 2005Martin M. Rehani K. Jope R.S. Michalek S.M. Toll-like receptor-mediated cytokine production is differentially regulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3.Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inactivation of GSK3β results in increased NF-κB-dependent transcription of TNFα without changing the kinase activity of the IKK complex or the nuclear translocation of p65 (Buss et al., 2004Buss H. Dorrie A. Schmitz M.L. Frank R. Livingstone M. Resch K. Kracht M. Phosphorylation of serine 468 by GSK-3β negatively regulates basal p65 NF-κB activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49571-49574Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that S468 phosphorylation of p65 by GSK3β might provide the docking site for tethering of Nurr1. Consistent with this possibility, the GSK3β-specific inhibitor SB216763 (SB21) inhibited the interaction of Nurr1 and p65 in BV2 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3G and Figure S7D) and prevented the recruitment of Nurr1 to the TNFα-promoter, as determined by ChIP assay (Figure 3A). To further confirm GSK3β involvement, we performed TNFα-luciferase reporter assays in RAW264.7 cells cotransfected with a kinase-dead mutant of GSK3β (GSK3β-K85R mutant, GSK3β-KD). GSK3β-KD expression abolished the Nurr1-mediated transrepression of the TNFα-promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S7B). Furthermore, knockdown of GSK3β completely prevented Nurr1-mediated iNOS repression (Figure 3H). We further validated the contribution of phospho-S468 in p65 by exchanging S468 for alanine (S468A). The p65 S468A mutant, but not wild-type p65, reversed Nurr1-mediated iNOS repression in RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3I and Figure S7E). Finally, GSK3β stimulated the in vitro interaction of Nurr1 with wild-type p65 but not with p65-S486A (Figure S7C). Transcriptional repression requires the recruitment of multiprotein complexes assembled on central scaffolding proteins referred to as corepressors. We used siRNAs against various candidate corepressors in the iNOS-luciferase reporter assay and identified CoREST as being essential for Nurr1-mediated repression (Figure 4A and Figure S8A). CoREST has been considered to be dedicated to repression of neuronal genes in nonneuronal cells or early precursors by binding to neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF)/RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) (Ballas et al., 2005Ballas N. Grunseich C. Lu D.D. Speh J.C. Mandel G. REST and its corepressors mediate plasticity of neuronal gene chromatin throughout neurogenesis.Cell. 2005; 121: 645-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). CoREST assembles many chromatin-modifying enzymes, including histone methyltransferase G9a, histone demethylase, lysine-specific demethylase (LSD1) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 and 2 (Shi et al., 2003Shi Y.

Bacterial infection results in the increased accumulation of the mobile metabolite azelaic acid, a nine-carbon dicarboxylic acid, in the vascular sap of Arabidopsis that confers local and systemic resistance against the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae . Azelaic acid primes plants to accumulate salicylic acid (SA), a known defense signal, upon infection. Mutation of the AZELAIC ACID INDUCED 1 (AZI1) gene, which is induced by azelaic acid, results in the specific loss of systemic immunity triggered by pathogen or azelaic acid and of the priming of SA induction in plants. Furthermore, the predicted secreted protein AZI1 is also important for generating vascular sap that confers disease resistance. Thus, azelaic acid and AZI1 are components of plant systemic immunity involved in priming defenses."

The molecular nature of this switch remains enigmatic. Here, we show that TGFβ-dependent cell migration, invasion and metastasis are empowered by mutant-p53 and opposed by p63. Mechanistically, TGFβ acts in concert with oncogenic Ras and mutant-p53 to induce the assembly of a mutant-p53/p63 protein complex in which Smads serve as essential platforms.

Cancer progression is a multistep process involving the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes in several genes. Still, how distinct defects cooperate to generate a metastatic tumor remains a long-standing unanswered question in cancer biology. The fact that specific gene-sets, or signatures, already expressed in primary tumors have been found predictive for metastasis, has led to the proposal that metastatic proclivity might be intimately wired to the same aberrant genetic pathways that control tumorigenesis in the primary tumor (Bernards and Weinberg, 2002Bernards R. Weinberg R.A. A progression puzzle.Nature. 2002; 418: 823Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). One of the most frequent genetic lesions in human tumors is mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor, which acts as transcription factor to promote cytostasis, apoptosis and genome integrity. More than 80% of p53 alterations are missense mutations that lead to the synthesis of a stable but transcriptionally deficient protein (Soussi and Beroud, 2001Soussi T. Beroud C. Assessing TP53 status in human tumours to evaluate clinical outcome.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Why do tumor cells retain a disabled tumor suppressor, rather than losing it for good? An important step in answering this question has been the generation of mutant-p53 knockin mice (Lang et al., 2004Lang G.A. Iwakuma T. Suh Y.A. Liu G. Rao V.A. Parant J.M. Valentin-Vega Y.A. Terzian T. Caldwell L.C.

Mutant p53 gain of function in two mouse models of Li-Fraumeni syndrome.Cell. 2004; 119: 847-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Remarkably, tumors emerging in these models display aggressive and metastatic traits that are never detected in tumors developing in a p53 null background. This is supported by molecular epidemiology data in humans, showing that mutant-p53 expressing tumors are aggressive and associated to poor-prognosis (Sorlie et al., 2001Sorlie T. Perou C.M. Tibshirani R. Aas T. Geisler S. Johnsen H. Hastie T. Eisen M.B. van de Rijn M.

Cancer. 2001; 1: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, activating mutations in the Ras signaling pathway appear critical for the malignant phenotypes of mutant-p53 (Caulin et al., 2007Caulin C. Nguyen T. Lang G.A. Goepfert T.M. Brinkley B.R. Cai W.W. Lozano G. Roop D.R. An inducible mouse model for skin cancer reveals distinct roles for gain- and loss-of-function p53 mutations.J. Clin.

Thus, p53 mutation, in concert with oncogenic Ras, leads to a gain of molecularly undefined properties that render mutant-p53 a dominant prometastatic factor. Whether this entails the intersection with other pathways involved in neoplastic transformation is unknown. TGFβ/Smad signaling plays a central role for tumorigenesis of several epithelia, paradoxically switching from tumor suppressor to promoter of metastasis during cancer progression (Derynck et al., 2001Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. TGF-beta signaling in tumor suppression and cancer progression.Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence of a TGFβ-initiated intracellular cascade specifically relevant in advanced tumor cells for metastasis. We show that mutant-p53 expression is required for sustaining TGFβ proinvasive responses and metastatic spread in vivo. Moreover, we shed light on the enigmatic nature of the prometastatic switches of mutant-p53 and TGFβ by showing that these converge on the same mechanism: Ras-activated mutant-p53 and TGFβ conspire to oppose the activity of the p53 family member p63. p63 is a master gene for normal epithelial stem cells, protecting them from apoptosis and coordinating their differentiation (Deyoung and Ellisen, 2007Deyoung M.P. Ellisen L.W. p63 and p73 in human cancer: defining the network.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5169-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Here we show a role for p63 in metastasis protection that is disabled by the quantitative physical incorporation of p63 into a ternary protein complex together with mutant-p53 and TGFβ activated Smads. Finally, we also unveiled, and functionally validated, two genes regulated by this pathway that may be used as efficient prognostic tool in clinical settings. We sought to compare the effects of wild-type and mutant-p53 on the cellular response to TGFβ (Figure 1A). To this end, we used p53 null H1299 cells stably reconstituted with inducible expression vectors coding for wild-type human p53 or the hot-spot p53R175H mutant allele. The two cell populations expressed p53 proteins at similar levels and retained similar responsiveness to TGFβ, as judged by activation of P-Smad3 and of a synthetic reporter of Smad activity (pCAGA12-lux) (Figure 1B and Figure S1A available with this article online). In agreement with previous findings, reconstitution of H1299 cells with wild-type p53 rescued the ability of TGFβ to induce p21WAF1 and growth arrest (Figure 1B and data not shown, see Cordenonsi et al., 2007Cordenonsi M. Montagner M. Adorno M. Zacchigna L. Martello G. Mamidi A. Soligo S. Dupont S. Piccolo S. Integration of TGF-beta and Ras/MAPK signaling through p53 phosphorylation.Science. 2007; 315: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In contrast, reconstitution with mutant-p53 was ineffective in this respect (Figure 1B). TGFβ treatment of H1299 cells bearing p53R175H caused instead a strikingly different phenotype, as cells shed their cuboidal epithelial shape and acquired a more mesenchymal phenotype, characterized by a number of dynamic protrusions, such as filopodia and lamellipodia (Figure 1C). These were not present in parental cells or in cells reconstituted with wild-type p53 (Figure 1C and data not shown). To examine if expression of mutant-p53 also conferred migratory properties to cells receiving TGFβ, we used a wounding assay, in which cells are induced to migrate into a wound created by scratching confluent cultures with a pipette tip. After TGFβ treatment, while parental (p53 null) or wild-type p53 reconstituted H1299 cells had migrated poorly, p53R175H expressing cells almost completely invaded the wound (Figure 1D and data not shown). As an independent mean of measuring cell motility, we also carried out transwell-migration assays. Figure 1E shows that expression of mutant-p53, but not of wild-type p53, parallels with the acquisition of a TGFβ promigratory response. These data establish p53 as the only known Smad regulator whose mutational status can impart two profoundly different interpretations to TGFβ signal, being able to switch the cellular responses from tumor suppressive, supported by wild-type p53 (Cordenonsi et al., 2003Cordenonsi M. Dupont S. Maretto S. Insinga A. Imbriano C. Piccolo S.

Integration of TGF-beta and Ras/MAPK signaling through p53 phosphorylation.Science. 2007; 315: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), to promalignant, promoted by mutant-p53. Our data link the gain of mutant-p53 to TGFβ induced epithelial plasticity and migration, phenotypes whose emergence is critical for TGFβ invasive properties (Derynck et al., 2001Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. TGF-beta signaling in tumor suppression and cancer progression.Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). However, the actual requirement for these effects of mutant-p53 endogenously expressed in metastatic cancer cells remained a key unanswered issue. To address this, we knocked down endogenous mutant-p53 (p53R280K, Table S1) in MDA-MB-231 cells, a well-established model of invasive breast cancer. In transwell-migration assays, TGFβ triggered a Smad-dependent promigratory response in these cells (Figures 2A and S2B). Remarkably, this response was lost in mutant-p53-depleted cells (Figure 2A). Once embedded in a drop of Matrigel, MDA-MB-231 cells display a TGFβ dependent scattering, extracellular matrix degradation and migration (Figures S2C and S2D), recapitulating in vivo invasiveness. We found that mutant-p53 expression is required for these activities. These data suggest that, at least in vitro, mutant-p53 and TGFβ jointly control cell shape and invasiveness of breast cancer cells. Multiple evidences indicate that the metastatic spread of MDA-MB-231 cells in vivo is under control of autocrine TGFβ (Table S1). To test if mutant-p53 is relevant for TGFβ promoted malignant behaviors in vivo, we injected control (shGFP) or stably mutant-p53 depleted (shp53) MDA-MB-231 cells into the mammary fat pad of immunocompromized mice. The two cell populations grew at similar rate in vitro (data not shown) and formed primary tumors at similar rates and size in vivo (Figure 2B), indicating that high levels of mutant-p53 in MDA-MB-231 cells are not essential for proliferation or primary tumor formation. Six weeks after implantation, mice were sacrificed and examined for presence of metastatic lesions. Orthotopically injected MDA-MB-231 are poorly metastatic to the lung, but efficiently metastasize to the lymph nodes. Strikingly, depletion of mutant-p53 drastically reduced the number of lymph node metastases when compared to the control cells, as only one out of 22 mice injected with the shGFP cells scored negative for lymphonodal metastasis, whereas 10 out of 22 of mice carrying the shp53-depleted tumors remained metastasis-free (Figure 2C). To confirm these results implicating mutant-p53 in invasiveness in vivo, we injected control and shp53-MDA-MB-231 intravenously into nude mice. Mutant-p53 is required for lung colonization, as two independent clones of shp53-MDA-MB-231 cells displayed overt reduction of metastatic nodules in number and size (Figures 2D–2F). While control cells massively invaded the lung parenchyma, small nodules of shp53-cells remained confined perivascularly (Figure S2F). As specificity control, metastatic behavior of shp53-MDA-MB-231 cells is rescued by adding back siRNA insensitive mutant-p53, but not wild-type p53 (Figure 2D, compare lanes 4, 5, and 6). Taken together, the data suggest that mutant-p53 expression plays a crucial role in canalizing TGFβ responsiveness for efficient metastatic spread. Knockin mice expressing mutant-p53 (p53+/R172H or p53+/R270H) develop metastatic carcinomas, a phenotype never observed in mice simply lacking one p53 allele (p53+/−) (Lang et al., 2004Lang G.A.

Intriguingly, loss of one allele of p63 or p73 similarly endows p53+/− tumors with metastatic properties (Flores et al., 2005Flores E.R. Sengupta S. Miller J.B. Newman J.J. Bronson R. Crowley D. Yang A. McKeon F. Jacks T.

The parallel between loss of p63/p73 and gain of mutant-p53 is compatible with mutant-p53 acting as a restraining factor for the activity of its family members. Interestingly, loss of p63 or p73 fosters progression, but in distinct tumor spectra, with loss of p63 specifically promoting the emergence of metastatic cancers in stratified epithelia (Flores et al., 2005Flores E.R. Sengupta S. Miller J.B. Newman J.J. Bronson R. Crowley D. Yang A. McKeon F. Jacks T. Tumor predisposition in mice mutant for p63 and p73: evidence for broader tumor suppressor functions for the p53 family.Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 363-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), that is, tumor types characterized by a clear promalignant-switch in TGFβ responses (Derynck et al., 2001Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. TGF-beta signaling in tumor suppression and cancer progression.Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). These hints prompted us to test the role of p63 in cell migration and invasion induced by TGFβ. Transient transfection of p63 (both TA or ΔNp63α isoforms) caused a marked inhibition of TGFβ-induced transwell migration (Figure 3A). Conversely, siRNA-mediated depletion of p63 in parental H1299 cells empowers TGFβ-induced migration, phenocopying gain of mutant-p53 (Figure 3B). We then tested the epistatic relationships between mutant-p53 and p63. Crucially, loss of p63 leads to a remarkable rescue of TGFβ promigratory and proinvasive properties in p53-depleted MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 3C, lanes 3 and 4). To functionally support this notion in vivo, we stably antagonized endogenous p63 activity using a dominant-negative protein, termed p63DD, consisting of EGFP fused in frame with the p63 tetramerization domain (Figures S4A and S4B). We used a lentiviral delivery system to stably introduce p63DD in shp53 MDA-MB-231 cells. Remarkably, p63 inactivation substantially rescues lung colonization in mutant-p53-depleted cells (Figure 3E). Taken together, the evidences in vitro and in vivo suggest that TGFβ uses mutant-p53 to surpass the barrier that p63 raises against TGFβ-induced malignant cell responses (Figure 3D). If p63 inhibition by mutant-p53 and TGFβ allows the exploitation of TGFβ proinvasive properties in metastatic cells, then experimental downregulation of p63 in non-invasive tumors might unleash a TGFβ-dependent transition toward more aggressive cell phenotypes. To test this, we used non-invasive skin squamous carcinoma B9 cells (Oft et al., 2002Oft M. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Metastasis is driven by sequential elevation of H-ras and Smad2 levels.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). After transfection of p63-siRNA, B9 cells displayed loss of epithelial and gain of mesenchymal traits (Figures 3F–3H). This shift was inhibited by blocking TGFβ receptor I activity with SB431542, indicating the reliance on endogenous TGFβ signaling. To investigate the role of p63 in vivo, we stably transduced p63DD in B9 cells and, as a control, in H11 aggressive spindle cells (expressing extremely low levels of p63, data not shown). Cells bearing p63DD or only GFP (as control) were injected sub-cutaneously into nude mice, and their growth as xenograft tumors was observed. While expression of p63DD had little effect on tumor growth and morphology of H11 cells (data not shown), tumors emerging from p63DD engineered B9 cells displayed an accelerated growth, decreased differentiation and acquisition of a spindle phenotype with increased stromal invasion (Figures 3I and 3J). We next sought to address the mechanism by which TGFβ controls p63 through mutant-p53. Previous work has shown that, at the biochemical level, the recombinant core domain of some mutant-p53 proteins, but not of wild-type p53, binds and inhibits p63 by masking its DNA binding domain (Gaiddon et al., 2001Gaiddon C. Lokshin M. Ahn J. Zhang T. Prives C. A subset of tumor-derived mutant forms of p53 down-regulate p63 and p73 through a direct interaction with the p53 core domain.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1874-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, Strano et al., 2002Strano S. Fontemaggi G. Costanzo A. Rizzo M.G. Monti O. Baccarini A. Del Sal G. Levrero M. Sacchi A. Oren M. et al.Physical interaction with human tumor-derived p53 mutants inhibits p63 activities.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18817-18826Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, several observations suggest that this biochemical model is an oversimplification, that misses at least one essential component. Indeed, to be effective as an antagonist, mutant-p53 should be able to quantitatively titrate p63; in contrast, there is scant evidence that such interaction can effectively occur in vivo at physiological concentrations of these proteins (Caulin et al., 2007Caulin C. Nguyen T. Lang G.A. Goepfert T.M. Brinkley B.R. Cai W.W. Lozano G. Roop D.R. An inducible mouse model for skin cancer reveals distinct roles for gain- and loss-of-function p53 mutations.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1893-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, and see below). Moreover, stratified epithelia almost exclusively express ΔNp63, an isoform per se unable to complex mutant-p53 (Gaiddon et al., 2001Gaiddon C. Lokshin M. Ahn J. Zhang T. Prives C. A subset of tumor-derived mutant forms of p53 down-regulate p63 and p73 through a direct interaction with the p53 core domain.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1874-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We tested if Smads might be the missing link between mutant-p53 and p63 inactivation. For this, we first immunoprecipitated endogenous mutant-p53 from HACAT keratinocytes (carrying the p53H179Y/R282W mutations, Table S1). Co-precipitating proteins were revealed by Western blotting. In lysates of untreated cells we could detect only a weak interaction between p63 and mutant-p53, but this association was massively augmented in the presence of TGFβ signaling (by more than 20-fold; Figure 4A, compare lanes 2 and 3). Crucially, endogenous Smads are essential for mutant-p53/p63 complex formation, becoming this undetectable upon transfection of siRNA against Smad2/3 (Figure 4A, compare lane 3 and 4). These findings suggest that TGFβ signaling is an essential determinant for mutant-p53 to complex its family member p63. In an alternative experimental set-up, coimmunoprecipitation using anti-Smad2 antibodies reveals Smad2 associated with p63 and mutant-p53 (Figure 4B); yet, while the interaction of Smad2 with p63 is to a large extent independent from mutant-p53 (Figure 4B, lane 3), Smad binding to mutant-p53 requires p63 (Figure 4B, lane 4), suggesting that mutant-p53 preferentially associates to a preassembled p63/Smad2 scaffold in these cells. Together, these biochemical data indicate the formation of a TGFβ-induced ternary complex between endogenous p63, mutant-p53 and Smads. A wealth of evidence in cancer cells and animal models clearly indicates that metastasis requires the combination of elevated TGFβ and Ras signaling, but the mechanisms of this intersection remain unclear (Grunert et al., 2003Grunert S. Jechlinger M. Beug H. Diverse cellular and molecular mechanisms contribute to epithelial plasticity and metastasis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we previously showed that the same pathways are involved in mesoderm development in Xenopus embryogenesis: in that case, however, it is wild-type p53 that serves as link between Smad and RTK signaling (Cordenonsi et al., 2007Cordenonsi M. Montagner M. Adorno M. Zacchigna L. Martello G. Mamidi A. Soligo S. Dupont S. Piccolo S. Integration of TGF-beta and Ras/MAPK signaling through p53 phosphorylation.Science. 2007; 315: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These precedents prompted us to test if oncogenic Ras may feed on mutant-p53 for the formation of the ternary complex. We first wished to address this in a cellular context free from the multiple genetic changes that typically characterize cancer cell lines. For this, we used MEFs derived from p53−/− and p53R172H knockin mice, transduced with control or oncogenic HRas-expressing retroviral vectors (Lang et al., 2004Lang G.A. Iwakuma T. Suh Y.A. Liu G. Rao V.A. Parant J.M. Valentin-Vega Y.A. Terzian T. Caldwell L.C. Strong L.C. et al.Gain of function of a p53 hot spot mutation in a mouse model of Li-Fraumeni syndrome.Cell. 2004; 119: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 4C, TGFβ induced the formation of the ternary complex between p63, mutant-p53 and Smads only in presence of oncogenic Ras (lane 4). Consistently, TGFβ promoted migration of MEFs in transwell assays only in cells expressing both mutant-p53 and oncogenic Ras (Figure 4D). We previously showed that Ras promotes the formation of a complex between wild-type p53 and Smads by triggering phosphorylation the p53 N-terminus through CK1ɛ/δ kinases (Cordenonsi et al., 2007Cordenonsi M. Montagner M. Adorno M. Zacchigna L. Martello G. Mamidi A. Soligo S. Dupont S. Piccolo S. Integration of TGF-beta and Ras/MAPK signaling through p53 phosphorylation.Science. 2007; 315: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We thus investigated whether a similar mechanism operated on mutant-p53. In breast MDA-MB-231 cells, endogenous oncogenic Ras is indeed required for mutant-p53 N-terminal phosphorylation (Figure S5A) and the formation of the TGFβ-induced ternary complex is inhibited by loss of Ras/MEK signaling or CK1ɛ/δ depletion (Figures 4E and S5B). Consistently, as shown in Figure S5C, mutation of the Ras/CK1-targeted phosphorylation sites of mutant-p53 abolished ternary complex formation in reconstituted H1299 cells (expressing oncogenic N-Ras, Table S1). In line with these biochemical data, Ras/CK1ɛδ signaling is required for TGFβ induced migration of MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4F) and p53R175H-reconstituted H1299 cells (Figure S5D). We finally validated in vivo the role of CK1ɛ/δ and found that CK1ɛ/δ-depleted MDA-MB-231 failed to undergo metastatic spread after tail vein injection in recipient mice (Figure 4G). Together, data presented so far indicate that Ras/CK1 signaling enables ternary complex formation and empowers TGFβ-induced migration and breast cancer cell metastasis. Our evidences suggest that Smads serve as a critical bridge for the formation of an inhibitory complex between mutant-p53 and p63. Using immobilized GST-Smad3 and in vitro translated p63, we found that their interaction is direct (Figure 5A). Using different p63 isoforms, we dissected two independent Smad interaction surfaces in p63: the p63 N-terminal TA-domain contacts the MH1 domain of Smad3 whereas the p63 C-terminal alpha domain binds the Smad3-MH2 domain. While mapping Smad interaction in the TA domain confirms previous findings with p53 (Cordenonsi et al., 2007Cordenonsi M. Montagner M. Adorno M. Zacchigna L. Martello G. Mamidi A. Soligo S. Dupont S. Piccolo S. Integration of TGF-beta and Ras/MAPK signaling through p53 phosphorylation.Science. 2007; 315: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the identification of a second Smad interaction surface in the alpha domain of p63 is interesting, first, because this domain has no structural counterparts in p53 and, second, because the vast majority of p63 is expressed in vivo as ΔNα isoform, lacking its TA-domain (Deyoung and Ellisen, 2007Deyoung M.P. Ellisen L.W. p63 and p73 in human cancer: defining the network.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5169-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These structural hints suggest that RSmad, by mean its N- and C-terminal domains may serve as a platform to assemble the mutant-p53/p63 complex (Figure 5B). This configuration might enable mutant-p53 to inhibit p63 transcriptional properties. To validate this hypothesis, we monitored p63 transcriptional activity in luciferase assays. p63 overexpression in H1299 cells potently induced transcription from the p53/p63 element of the Mix.2 promoter (p53BE-lux) (Figure S8A). Cotransfection of several distinct mutant-p53 isoforms effectively inhibited p63 activity only in cells stimulated by TGFβ/Smad signaling (Figures 5C and S8B). To better dissect the molecular mechanism of p63 repression we carried out ChIP analyses on the established p63 binding elements of the CDKN1A promoter (Deyoung and Ellisen, 2007Deyoung M.P. Ellisen L.W. p63 and p73 in human cancer: defining the network.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5169-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 5D, binding of p63 to its cognate sites is quantitatively inhibited by mutant-p53 only in the presence of TGFβ signaling (lane 4). Similar results were obtained using transfected p53BE-lux reporter. Thus, incorporation of p63 into a TGFβ-induced ternary complex impairs p63 binding to DNA. During malignant progression, sequential elevations of TGFβ/Smad signaling is associated with the acquisition of metastatic potential (Cui et al., 1996Cui W. Fowlis D.J. Bryson S. Duffie E. Ireland H. Balmain A. Akhurst R.J. TGFbeta1 inhibits the formation of benign skin tumors, but enhances progression to invasive spindle carcinomas in transgenic mice.Cell. 1996; 86: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, Oft et al., 2002Oft M. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Metastasis is driven by sequential elevation of H-ras and Smad2 levels.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We thus explored the possibility that the metastatic shift of cancer cells could correspond to a quantitative inactivation of p63. For this, we monitored the dynamic of the trimeric complex in locally invasive D3 spindle carcinoma cells and their metastatic derivative D3S2, bearing constitutive Smad activity but expressing equal levels of p63, mutant-p53 (p53C236F) and oncogenic Ras (Oft et al., 2002Oft M. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Metastasis is driven by sequential elevation of H-ras and Smad2 levels.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar; Table S1 and Figure 6A). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 antibodies and coprecipitating p63 quantified by Western blotting. The amount of p63 complexed by mutant-p53 raised dramatically upon TGFβ treatment in D3 cells (becoming 50% of the input), to become essentially quantitative (>95%) in metastatic D3S2 cells (Figures 6B and 6C). Thus, in advanced tumors, increasing doses of TGFβ/Smad2 signaling correspond to increasing levels of p63 trapped into mutant-p53-containing complexes. D3S2 cells allow to validate in vivo the requirement of mutant-p53 and oncogenic Ras/CK1 signaling in a cellular context rendered metastatic by elevated Smad signaling (Figure S9A). As shown in Figure 6D, mutant-p53, high levels of oncogenic Ras and CK1ɛ/δ activity are required for lung metastasis of D3S2 cells upon tail vein injection in immunocompromised mice. This closely recapitulates our previous findings in human breast cancer cells, suggesting a general impact for the mechanism here described in TGFβ-driven malignancy. Further challenging the mutant-p53/p63 axis, we also tested in D3S"

https://openalex.org/W2084798466,"A substantial challenge in engineering molecular motors is designing mechanisms to coordinate the motion between multiple domains of the motor so as to bias random thermal motion. For bipedal motors, this challenge takes the form of coordinating the movement of the biped's legs so that they can move in a synchronized fashion. To address this problem, we have constructed an autonomous DNA bipedal walker that coordinates the action of its two legs by cyclically catalyzing the hybridization of metastable DNA fuel strands. This process leads to a chemically ratcheted walk along a directionally polar DNA track. By covalently cross-linking aliquots of the walker to its track in successive walking states, we demonstrate that this Brownian motor can complete a full walking cycle on a track whose length could be extended for longer walks. We believe that this study helps to uncover principles behind the design of unidirectional devices that can function without intervention. This device should be able to fulfill roles that entail the performance of useful mechanical work on the nanometer scale."

https://openalex.org/W2072565033,"Discovery of an efficient artificial catalyst for the sunlight-driven splitting of water into dioxygen and dihydrogen is a major goal of renewable energy research. We describe a solution-phase reaction scheme that leads to the stoichiometric liberation of dihydrogen and dioxygen in consecutive thermal- and light-driven steps mediated by mononuclear, well-defined ruthenium complexes. The initial reaction of water at 25 degrees C with a dearomatized ruthenium (II) [Ru(II)] pincer complex yields a monomeric aromatic Ru(II) hydrido-hydroxo complex that, on further reaction with water at 100 degrees C, releases H2 and forms a cis dihydroxo complex. Irradiation of this complex in the 320-to-420-nanometer range liberates oxygen and regenerates the starting hydrido-hydroxo Ru(II) complex, probably by elimination of hydrogen peroxide, which rapidly disproportionates. Isotopic labeling experiments with H2 17O and H2 18O show unequivocally that the process of oxygen-oxygen bond formation is intramolecular, establishing a previously elusive fundamental step toward dioxygen-generating homogeneous catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1970254771,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease caused by neuronal accumulation of the mutant protein huntingtin. Improving clearance of the mutant protein is expected to prevent cellular dysfunction and neurodegeneration in HD. We report here that such clearance can be achieved by posttranslational modification of the mutant Huntingtin (Htt) by acetylation at lysine residue 444 (K444). Increased acetylation at K444 facilitates trafficking of mutant Htt into autophagosomes, significantly improves clearance of the mutant protein by macroautophagy, and reverses the toxic effects of mutant huntingtin in primary striatal and cortical neurons and in a transgenic C. elegans model of HD. In contrast, mutant Htt that is rendered resistant to acetylation dramatically accumulates and leads to neurodegeneration in cultured neurons and in mouse brain. These studies identify acetylation as a mechanism for removing accumulated protein in HD, and more broadly for actively targeting proteins for degradation by autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2015113576,"Sleep is universal, strictly regulated, and necessary for cognition. Why this is so remains a mystery, although recent work suggests that sleep, memory, and plasticity are linked. However, little is known about how wakefulness and sleep affect synapses. Using Western blots and confocal microscopy in Drosophila , we found that protein levels of key components of central synapses were high after waking and low after sleep. These changes were related to behavioral state rather than time of day and occurred in all major areas of the Drosophila brain. The decrease of synaptic markers during sleep was progressive, and sleep was necessary for their decline. Thus, sleep may be involved in maintaining synaptic homeostasis altered by waking activities."

Crystallographic analysis of this region revealed a pair of parallel dimeric coiled coils intercalated in a tail-to-tail fashion to form a tetramer, giving rise to the unique configuration of a pair of N-terminal EVH1 domains at each end of the coiled coil. In neurons, the tetramerization is required for structural integrity of the dendritic spines and recruitment of proteins to synapses.

The identification of genes maintaining ESC identity is important to develop these cells for their potential therapeutic use. Here we report a genome-scale RNAi screen for a global survey of genes affecting ESC identity via alteration of Oct4 expression. Factors with the strongest effect on Oct4 expression included components of the Paf1 complex, a protein complex associated with RNA polymerase II. Using a combination of proteomics, expression profiling, and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that the Paf1C binds to promoters of key pluripotency genes, where it is required to maintain a transcriptionally active chromatin structure. The Paf1C is developmentally regulated and blocks ESC differentiation upon overexpression, and the knockdown in ESCs causes expression changes similar to Oct4 or Nanog depletions. We propose that the Paf1C plays an important role in maintaining ESC identity."
https://openalex.org/W2171205956,"Background Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 9p21 near the INK4/ARF (CDKN2A/B) tumor suppressor locus with risk of atherosclerotic diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus. To explore the mechanism of this association, we investigated whether expression of proximate transcripts (p16INK4a, p15INK4b, ARF, ANRIL and MTAP) correlate with genotype of representative 9p21 SNPs. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed expression of 9p21 transcripts in purified peripheral blood T-cells (PBTL) from 170 healthy donors. Samples were genotyped for six selected disease-related SNPs spanning the INK4/ARF locus. Correlations among these variables were determined by univariate and multivariate analysis. Significantly reduced expression of all INK4/ARF transcripts (p15INK4b, p16INK4a, ARF and ANRIL) was found in PBTL of individuals harboring a common SNP (rs10757278) associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease, stroke and aortic aneurysm. Expression of MTAP was not influenced by rs10757278 genotype. No association of any these transcripts was noted with five other tested 9p21 SNPs. Conclusions/Significance Genotypes of rs10757278 linked to increased risk of atherosclerotic diseases are also associated with decreased expression in PBTL of the INK4/ARF locus, which encodes three related anti-proliferative transcripts of known importance in tumor suppression and aging."

Rescue of each of these genes within the ventral lateral neurons (LNVs) restores increased sleep after social enrichment. Social experiences that induce increased sleep were associated with an increase in the number of synaptic terminals in the LNV projections into the medulla.

https://openalex.org/W2141791765,"Brown fat is specialized for energy expenditure, a process that is principally controlled by the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha. Here, we describe a molecular network important for PGC-1alpha function and brown fat metabolism. We find that twist-1 is selectively expressed in adipose tissue, interacts with PGC-1alpha, and is recruited to the promoters of PGC-1alpha's target genes to suppress mitochondrial metabolism and uncoupling. In vivo, transgenic mice expressing twist-1 in the adipose tissue are prone to high-fat-diet-induced obesity, whereas twist-1 heterozygous knockout mice are obesity resistant. These phenotypes are attributed to their altered mitochondrial metabolism in the brown fat. Interestingly, the nuclear receptor PPARdelta not only mediates the actions of PGC-1alpha but also regulates twist-1 expression, suggesting a negative-feedback regulatory mechanism. These findings reveal an unexpected physiological role for twist-1 in the maintenance of energy homeostasis and have important implications for understanding metabolic control and metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2079261384,"In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), lectins and processing enzymes are involved in quality control of newly synthesized proteins for productive folding as well as in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded proteins. ER quality control requires the recognition and modification of the N-linked oligosaccharides attached to glycoproteins. Mannose trimming from the N-glycans plays an important role in targeting of misfolded glycoproteins for ERAD. Recently, two mammalian lectins, OS-9 and XTP3-B, which contain mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology domains, were reported to be involved in ER quality control. Here, we examined the requirement for human OS-9 (hOS-9) lectin activity in degradation of the glycosylated ERAD substrate NHK, a genetic variant of alpha1-antitrypsin. Using frontal affinity chromatography, we demonstrated that the recombinant hOS-9 mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology domain specifically binds N-glycans lacking the terminal mannose from the C branch in vitro. To examine the specificity of OS-9 recognition of N-glycans in vivo, we modified the oligosaccharide structures on NHK by overexpressing ER alpha1,2-mannosidase I or EDEM3 and examined the effect of these modifications on NHK degradation in combination with small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of hOS-9. The ability of hOS-9 to enhance glycoprotein ERAD depended on the N-glycan structures on NHK, consistent with the frontal affinity chromatography results. Thus, we propose a model for mannose trimming and the requirement for hOS-9 lectin activity in glycoprotein ERAD in which N-glycans lacking the terminal mannose from the C branch are recognized by hOS-9 and targeted for degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2110318878,"Cells are devices whose structures delimit function. For example, in the nervous system, neuronal and glial shapes dictate paths of information flow. To understand how cells acquire their shapes, we examined the formation of a sense organ in C. elegans.

A genetic screen identified DEX-1 and DYF-7, extracellular proteins required for dendritic tip anchoring, which act cooperatively at the time and place of anchoring. DEX-1 and DYF-7 contain, respectively, zonadhesin and zona pellucida domains, and DYF-7 self-associates into multimers important for anchoring. Thus, unlike other dendrites, amphid dendritic tips are positioned by DEX-1 and DYF-7 without the need for long-range guidance cues.

Some of the most remarkable architecture on the planet is found at the level of single cells. Neurons, in particular, adopt precisely patterned shapes that extend over millimeters (or, in some organisms, meters), and they elaborate complex dendrites with stereotyped lengths and branching patterns that occupy defined volumes of space (Parrish et al., 2007Parrish J.Z. Emoto K. Kim M.D. Jan Y.N. Mechanisms that regulate establishment, maintenance, and remodeling of dendritic fields.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 399-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The fidelity with which each neuron assumes and maintains its shape directly affects its function, with miswiring leading to a range of neurological disorders (Yaron and Zheng, 2007Yaron A. Zheng B. Navigating their way to the clinic: emerging roles for axon guidance molecules in neurological disorders and injury.Dev. Neurobiol. 2007; 67: 1216-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The shapes of neurons are matched in complexity only, perhaps, by the shapes of the glia that surround them. Moreover, the shapes of neurons and glia must be closely coordinated for a functional nervous system to assemble. And, while the problem of generating cell shape takes on particularly astounding dimensions in the nervous system, the same problem—and, possibly, the same solutions—affect every tissue of the body. The nematode C. elegans provides a useful model in which to study cell shape. Most of the 959 somatic cells of an adult hermaphrodite exhibit an essentially invariant shape from animal to animal (Sulston et al., 1983Sulston J.E. Schierenberg E. White J.G. Thomson J.N. The embryonic cell lineage of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Dev. Biol. 1983; 100: 64-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). Each of these cell shapes, including the complete wiring diagram of the nervous sytem, has been cataloged by three-dimensional reconstruction of electron micrographic serial sections (Ward et al., 1975Ward S. Thomson N. White J.G. Brenner S. Electron microscopical reconstruction of the anterior sensory anatomy of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Comp. Neurol. 1975; 160: 313-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, White et al., 1976White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S.

Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As most cells acquire their shapes in a defined time window from about 300–420 min post-fertilization, morphogenesis occurs on a timescale compatible with time-lapse imaging, a technique made even more powerful by the optical transparency of C. elegans. Finally, the facile genetics of this organism make it straightforward to isolate mutants affecting cell shape and thereby identify the relevant genes. To examine how cell shape is determined in neurons and glia, we decided to use developmental imaging and genetics to study development of the amphids, a bilaterally symmetric pair of sense organs in the head of the animal. Each amphid consists of 12 neurons that exhibit specific responses to smells (AWA, AWB, and AWC neurons), temperature (AFD neuron), and taste, touch, osmotic conditions, and pheromones (ASE, ADF, ASG, ASH, ASI, ASJ, ASK, and ADL neurons) (Bargmann, 2006Bargmann C.I. Chemosensation in C. elegans.WormBook. 2006; : 1-29PubMed Google Scholar, Ward et al., 1975Ward S. Thomson N. White J.G. Brenner S. Electron microscopical reconstruction of the anterior sensory anatomy of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Comp. Neurol. 1975; 160: 313-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Despite their diverse sensory functions, these 12 neurons share a similar overall shape, each extending an axon laterally into the nerve ring, or “brain,” and a single dendrite reaching to the tip of the nose. The axons do not arborize but are unbranched or bifurcated and make synapses en passant. The dendrites are also unbranched, each terminating at the nose in a sensory cilium bearing receptors responsible for that neuron's specific sensory modalities (Bargmann, 2006Bargmann C.I. Chemosensation in C. elegans.WormBook. 2006; : 1-29PubMed Google Scholar). The 12 dendrites associate with two glia: the sheath glial cell, which extends a process to the nose where it ensheathes all 12 dendritic endings; and the socket glial cell, which extends a process to the nose where it forms a pore through which some neurons are directly exposed to the environment (Shaham, 2006Shaham S. Glia-neuron interactions in the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 522-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, Ward et al., 1975Ward S. Thomson N.

Neurol. 1975; 160: 313-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). This sense organ, therefore, is shaped essentially as a linear bundle (Figure 1A), allowing a single aspect of neuronal and glial shape to be analyzed without the added complications of dendritic field tiling or branching, features that have been carefully explored elsewhere (Gao, 2007Gao F.B. Molecular and cellular mechanisms of dendritic morphogenesis.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the amphid offers a simple system for asking a basic question about cell shape, namely, how is the length of a sensory dendrite, or a glial cell, established. To identify factors that determine the shapes of neurons and glia, we generated a strain expressing fluorescent proteins in two amphid neurons (ASE and AWC) and the sheath glial cell, performed random chemical mutagenesis, and screened visually for animals with morphologically abnormal neurons and glia. We also screened a panel of candidate mutants known to affect sensory neuron function (Starich et al., 1995Starich T.A. Herman R.K. Kari C.K. Yeh W.H. Schackwitz W.S. Schuyler M.W. Collet J. Thomas J.H. Riddle D.L. Mutations affecting the chemosensory neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 1995; 139: 171-188PubMed Google Scholar). We identified a novel class of mutants in which all 12 dendrites and the sheath glial process fail to extend to the tip of the nose, a phenotype we call Dex (Dendrite extension defective) (Figures 1A–1C). The mutations define two genes, dex-1 and dyf-7 (see Experimental Procedures). The Dex phenotype is specific to the lengths of the dendrites and sheath glial process. Neuronal and glial cell bodies are properly positioned and appear healthy; both cell types express appropriate cell-specific markers, including a marker whose expression depends on normal axon-axon contacts; and overall axon morphology appears normal (Figures 1A–1C, Figure S1 available online). Dendrites are ensheathed by the sheath glial cell and possess sensory cilia to which odorant receptors properly localize (Figure S1). The socket glial cell extends a grossly wild-type process to the tip of nose but also extends an ectopic posterior process that contacts the shortened sheath glial cell (Figures 1B and 1C), suggesting that all relevant cell-cell contacts in the organ—namely, between the sheath glial cell and each neuron, between the sheath and socket glia, and between the socket glial cell and hypodermal cells at the nose (Perkins et al., 1986Perkins L.A.

The specificity of the Dex phenotype to dendrite length indicates that dendrite and axon extension occur by different mechanisms, and that cell-cell contacts are probably not sufficient to confer normal cell shape. Two additional features of the Dex phenotype struck us as potentially revealing. First, weakly penetrant alleles of dex-1 and dyf-7 produce bimodally distributed dendrite lengths, an effect seen most conspicuously in dyf-7(ns116) but also evident in dex-1(ns42), dyf-7(ns117), and, to a lesser extent, dyf-7(ns88) (Figure 1D). These bimodal distributions suggest that dendrite growth in dex-1 and dyf-7 animals is limited by an initiation event that often fails, while downstream steps usually proceed to completion if the initiation event is successful. Second, when dex-1 or dyf-7 larvae are born with short dendrites, those dendrites remain at constant length until adulthood, unlike wild-type dendrites, which scale almost 2-fold in length to keep pace with overall larval growth (Figures 1E and S1D). However, dex-1 and dyf-7 neurons are not generally insensitive to larval growth, as their cell body size and axon length increase at rates similar to those in wild-type neurons (Figures S1C and S1D). Thus, dex-1 and dyf-7 mutations cause defects at two steps: first, in establishing proper dendrite length during embryonic development, and second, in scaling dendrite length to keep pace with larval growth. Animals bearing the partially penetrant alleles dex-1(ns42) and dyf-7(ns117) display dendrites and glial processes of variable lengths in a population, which allowed us to determine if each neuron and glial cell attains its length autonomously or if lengths are coordinated within an amphid bundle. If each cell attains its length autonomously, then neurons in the same bundle would be of similar lengths no more often than one would expect based on the overall distribution of lengths in the population. However, a correlation between dendrite lengths would indicate coordination within each amphid bundle, suggesting a non-cell-autonomous mechanism of growth. To distinguish between these possibilities, we generated a strain in which a single neuron, AWC, expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) stochastically in either the left or right amphid (Troemel et al., 1999Troemel E.R. Sagasti A. Bargmann C.I. Lateral signaling mediated by axon contact and calcium entry regulates asymmetric odorant receptor expression in C. elegans.Cell. 1999; 99: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and another neuron, ADF, expresses red fluorescent protein (RFP) in both amphids (Figure 2A). We then compared the length of the AWC dendrite to the lengths of ipsilateral (Figure 2A, closed arrowheads) and contralateral (Figure 2A, open arrowheads) ADF dendrites in dex-1(ns42) and dyf-7(ns117) animals. In each mutant, dendrite lengths in the same amphid were perfectly correlated (Figure 2B), while dendrite lengths in bilaterally apposed amphids were no more correlated than would be expected at random (Figure 2C). Dendrite lengths were similarly well-correlated with the length of the sheath glial process (data not shown). Thus, at least two separable activities are involved in dendrite length establishment: a genetically uncharacterized activity that coordinates the relative lengths of dendrites and glia, and a dex-1- and dyf-7-dependent activity that sets the absolute length of the dendritic-glial bundle. We considered two hypotheses for how dendrite length might be established. In one hypothesis, a dendritic growth cone emerges from the cell body and seeks a target at the nose. This mode of neurite outgrowth is well established for axon formation, and a similar mode of outgrowth has been observed using in vivo time-lapse imaging of highly branched dendrites forming in other systems (Williams and Truman, 2004Williams D.W.

Time-lapse in vivo imaging of the morphological development of Xenopus optic tectal interneurons.J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 459: 392-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In an alternative hypothesis, the presumptive dendritic tip remains stationary while the cell body migrates away, a mode of outgrowth we call retrograde extension. Retrograde extension has not been directly observed in any system but has been suggested by electron microscopic studies of developing sense organs in C. elegans embryos and male tails (Nguyen et al., 1999Nguyen C.Q.

Schierenberg E. White J.G. Thomson J.N. The embryonic cell lineage of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Dev. Biol. 1983; 100: 64-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). Time-lapse images of wild-type and dyf-7(m537) embryos expressing myristoylated GFP in most sensory neurons were consistent with retrograde extension (Movie S1), but due to the large number of cells labeled it was impossible to resolve individual dendrites. To overcome this limitation, we used optical cell marking (OCM) to observe the formation of single dendrites in living C. elegans embryos. OCM entails cell-limited photoconversion of a broadly expressed fluorescent protein—in this case, Kaede—to generate a marker with nearly exclusive single-cell specificity (Figures 3A–3C) (Ando et al., 2002Ando R. Hama H. Yamamoto-Hino M. Mizuno H. Miyawaki A. An optical marker based on the UV-induced green-to-red photoconversion of a fluorescent protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 12651-12656Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Using OCM we saw that in 4/4 wild-type embryos (Movies S2–S5), amphid neurons were born near the presumptive nose and formed a projection toward it (Figure 3D). The cell body then developed a leading edge antipodal to this projection and underwent an ∼30 min, ∼6 μm posterior migration while the dendritic tip remained anchored at its original position (Figure 3E), forming a dendrite by retrograde extension (Figure 3F). We did not attempt single-embryo analysis of dex-1 embryos because of the weak penetrance of the ns42 allele. However, in 4/4 dyf-7(m537) embryos (Movies S6–S9), neurons were born in the proper position and formed projections toward the nose (Figure 3H), but dendritic tips failed to remain anchored during cell body migration, were “dragged” along with the migrating cell body (Figure 3I), and eventually disappeared (Figure 3J). Thus, dyf-7 is required for anchoring dendritic tips during cell body migration. We attempted to quantify the rate of movement of the dendritic tip, nucleus, and leading edge of each migrating cell by measuring their positions along the vertical image axis (y) at each time point (t) (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We aligned the movies in space and time using the endpoint of nuclear migration, defined by the abatement of nuclear velocity, as a registration mark ((y, t) = (0, 0); Figure S2). Averaged trajectories of wild-type embryos from Movies S2–S4 (Figure 3G) and dyf-7 embryos from Movies S6–S9 (Figure 3K) showed that cell body migrations were virtually identical. However, in dyf-7 embryos the dendritic tip did not remain stationary but followed the migrating cell body with similar velocity, demonstrating that dyf-7 specifically affects dendritic tip anchoring but not cell body migration. We used standard mapping and cloning techniques to identify the dex-1 and dyf-7 genes (see Experimental Procedures). We found that dyf-7 encodes a predicted single-pass transmembrane protein with a small cytoplasmic domain and a large extracellular/lumenal domain similar to zona pellucida (ZP) proteins, best known for comprising the matrix surrounding vertebrate oocytes to which sperm bind (Figure 4A) (Jovine et al., 2005Jovine L. Darie C.C. Litscher E.S. Wassarman P.M. Zona pellucida domain proteins.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 83-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We mapped dex-1 to a 0.4 cM interval that included a gene predicted to encode a single-pass transmembrane protein with a domain similar to zonadhesin (Figure 4A), a sperm protein that binds the ZP matrix (Hardy and Garbers, 1995Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. A sperm membrane protein that binds in a species-specific manner to the egg extracellular matrix is homologous to von Willebrand factor.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26025-26028Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and thus a candidate DYF-7 interactor. Sequence analysis and genetic rescue showed that this gene is dex-1 (see Experimental Procedures). In addition to its zonadhesin-like domain, DEX-1 is predicted to include two domains similar to nidogens, a family of proteins found in basement membranes, including neuronal basement membrane in C. elegans (Kim and Wadsworth, 2000Kim S. Wadsworth W.G. Positioning of longitudinal nerves in C. elegans by nidogen.Science. 2000; 288: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The sole dex-1 mutation is predicted to truncate its zonadhesin domain (Figure 4A). The most penetrant alleles of dyf-7 are predicted to prematurely terminate its coding sequence (ns119, m537), interfere with its transmembrane segment (ns118), or change a hydrophobic residue to a charged residue between the first and second conserved cysteines of the ZP domain (V52E in ns120). Less penetrant alleles correspond to other point mutations in the ZP domain (ns117, ns116, ns88) (Figures 1D and 4A). In addition to their similarity to proteins involved in sperm-egg binding, DEX-1 and DYF-7 also share domain composition with α- and β-tectorin (Figure 4A), two vertebrate inner ear proteins found in a matrix (the tectorial membrane) that anchors the sensory endings of hair cells and is required for hearing (Legan et al., 1997Legan P.K. Rau A. Keen J.N. Richardson G.P. The mouse tectorins. Modular matrix proteins of the inner ear homologous to components of the sperm-egg adhesion system.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8791-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, Petit et al., 2001Petit C. Levilliers J. Hardelin J.P. Molecular genetics of hearing loss.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 589-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Mutations in α-tectorin are linked to instances of familial deafness and one such mutation, α-tectorin(G1824D) (Verhoeven et al., 1998Verhoeven K. Van Laer L. Kirschhofer K. Legan P.K. Hughes D.C. Schatteman I. Verstreken M. Van Hauwe P. Coucke P. Chen A. et al.Mutations in the human alpha-tectorin gene cause autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing impairment.Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 60-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), corresponds well to DYF-7(V52E), despite the low overall sequence similarity between their ZP domains (Figure S3). We reasoned that if DEX-1 and DYF-7 constitute a tectorin-like matrix, then mutations in each protein might interact genetically. Indeed, the weakly penetrant, cold-sensitive alleles dex-1(ns42) and dyf-7(ns117) strongly synergize, such that the residual dendrite-anchoring activity of DYF-7(P107S) depends almost entirely on the presence of wild-type DEX-1 (Figure 4B, 25°C). Cultivation under restrictive conditions revealed an even stronger synergy, in the form of a synthetic lethal phenotype (Figure 4B, 20°C and 15°C) caused by defects in the excretory system (data not shown). These genetic interactions are consistent with the notion that the DEX-1 zonadhesin and DYF-7 ZP domains might physically interact. In vertebrates, α-tectorin provides sufficient activity for hearing, while β-tectorin contributes more subtly (Russell et al., 2007Russell I.J. Legan P.K. Lukashkina V.A. Lukashkin A.N. Goodyear R.J. Richardson G.P. Sharpened cochlear tuning in a mouse with a genetically modified tectorial membrane.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We noted that α-tectorin resembles a DEX-1-DYF-7 fusion (Figure 4A), suggesting that α-tectorin may have arisen by duplication of an ancestral dyf-7-like gene downstream of, and in frame with, an ancestral dex-1-like gene. As a test of this hypothesis, we expressed a DEX-1-DYF-7 fusion and assayed its ability to rescue the dex-1(ns42); dyf-7(ns117) double mutant. The DEX-1-DYF-7 fusion restored dendrite length and organismal viability at 25°C, 20°C, and 15°C (Figure 4B), while DEX-1 or DYF-7 individually did not (Figure S4). These results support a split-gene origin for α-tectorin and suggest a similarity in function between DEX-1 and DYF-7 and α-tectorin. To determine when dex-1 and dyf-7 act, we performed reciprocal temperature shifts of the cold-sensitive mutants at various developmental stages and scored dendrite lengths in adults. Shifting animals to the permissive temperature before, but not after, the time of dendrite formation was sufficient to promote dendrite extension (Figures 5A and 5B, open circles). Conversely, shifting animals to the nonpermissive temperature before, but not after, the time of dendrite formation inhibited dendrite extension (Figures 5A and 5B, closed circles). Similarly, expression of dyf-7 cDNA, under control of a heat-shock-inducible promoter, before the time of dendrite formation was necessary and sufficient for rescue of a completely penetrant dyf-7 mutation (Figure S5A). Thus, dex-1 and dyf-7 activities are necessary and sufficient at the time of dendrite extension. To determine when and where dex-1 and dyf-7 are expressed, we generated myristoylated fluorescent reporter transgenes using dex-1 or dyf-7 promoter sequences that are sufficient for rescue when used to express the corresponding cDNAs. These promoters drive reporter expression in embryos at the time of dendrite formation, with dyf-7pro expressed in most sensory neurons, including all amphid sensory neurons, and dex-1pro expressed in many non-neuronal adjacent cells, including hypodermal cells, seen as a row lateral to the amphid neuron bundle and, in a separate group, surrounding the sensory depression at the anterior pole of the embryo (Figure 5C). The promoters also drive expression in the excretory cell, consistent with the lethality observed in the double mutant (Figure 5C). The activity of each promoter was first apparent in bean-stage embryos, peaked in late embryogenesis, diminished in L1 larvae, and was negligible in older larvae and adults (Movie S10, Figure S5B). We next used rescuing fluorescent fusion proteins to determine the subcellular localization of DEX-1 and DYF-7. DEX-1-mCherry localizes in spots and patches restricted to the head and tail, where sensory organs are forming (Figure 5D). DYF-7-GFP accumulates in bright puncta at dendritic tips during retrograde extension, with weaker staining at the plasma membrane of the dendrite and cell body (Figure 5E, Movie S11). Colocalization of DEX-1-mCherry and DYF-7-GFP at dendritic tips was occasionally observed (Figure S5C). To further characterize DYF-7 localization, we forced expression of DYF-7-GFP in a single amphid neuron post-embryonically, when it is not normally expressed, to take advantage of the greater spatial resolution afforded by a mature neuron. In this system, DYF-7-GFP localizes in a novel domain at the dendritic tip, adjacent to the sensory cilium, indicating it contains a signal targeting it to the dendritic tip (Figure 5F). The timing, expression, and localization of DEX-1 and DYF-7 position them to play a direct role in dendritic tip anchoring. We imagined two models for dendrite anchoring. First, DEX-1 on neighboring cells could bind to DYF-7 at the dendritic tip, thus adhering the dendritic tip to cells at the nose. Alternatively, DEX-1 and DYF-7 could be proteolytically released from the cell surface and assembled into a local extracellular matrix to which the dendritic tip binds via a yet-unidentified receptor. Indeed, α- and β-tectorin are released from their membrane anchors by a furin-family protease and, together with collagens, assemble a matrix to which ciliated hair cells bind via an unidentified receptor (Legan et al., 1997Legan P.K. Rau A. Keen J.N. Richardson G.P. The mouse tectorins. Modular matrix proteins of the inner ear homologous to components of the sperm-egg adhesion system.J. Biol.

Genet. 2001; 35: 589-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if DEX-1 and DYF-7 are similarly released, their activities might be independent of the cell type in which they are expressed, a prediction not compatible with the cell adhesion model. We found that a dex-1 mutant was rescued by dex-1 cDNA expressed using its endogenous promoter, the dyf-7 promoter, or a glial enhancer element from the lin-26 gene (Figure 6A) (Landmann et al., 2004Landmann F. Quintin S. Labouesse M. Multiple regulatory elements with spatially and temporally distinct activities control the expression of the epithelial differentiation gene lin-26 in C. elegans.Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 478-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), but not when using the pha-4 promoter expressed at the same developmental stage in foregut and midgut cells, anatomically separated from the amphid (Figure 6A) (Mango et al., 1994Mango S.E. Lambie E.J. Kimble J. The pha-4 gene is required to generate the pharyngeal primordium of Caenorhabditis elegans.Development. 1994; 120: 3019-3031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mosaic analysis also indicated that dex-1 could act from multiple lineages (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). To further examine proteolysis and secretion of DEX-1, we expressed an epitope-tagged construct in Drosophila S2 cells in vitro, a system that allows rapid production of large quantities of protein at a temperature compatible with C. elegans protein function. We observed no proteolytic cleavage or secretion of DEX-1 in this system (Figure 6B), suggesting that secretion in vivo would require a protease absent in S2 cells. DEX-1 lacks an optimal consensus furin cleavage site (CFCS) and α-tectorin and zonadhesin undergo proteolytic cleavages at non-CFCS sequences, suggesting the existence of a conserved protease that cleaves within zonadhesin domains (Bi et al., 2003Bi M. Hickox J.R. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Hardy D.M. Processing, localization and binding activity of zonadhesin suggest a function in sperm adhesion to the zona pellucida during exocytosis of the acrosome.Biochem.

Modular matrix proteins of the inner ear homologous to components of the sperm-egg adhesion system.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8791-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, a derivative of DEX-1 lacking its transmembrane anchor (DEX-1ΔTM; Figure 4A) was efficiently secreted in vitro (Figure 6B) and was competent for rescue when expressed using the dex-1 or glial promoters, although not the dyf-7 promoter (Figure 6A). These results demonstrate that DEX-1 is capable of acting as a secreted factor. Similarly, the dyf-7 cDNA was competent for rescue whether expressed in neurons, dex-1-expressing cells, or glia, but not in gut (Figure 6C), and mosaic analysis indicated sufficiency in multiple amphid sensory neuron lineages (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures).

MicroRNAs turn off target gene expression within cells by binding complementary regions in messenger RNA transcripts, and they have been broadly implicated in development and disease.

Conversely, the receptor without the ligand represses microRNA expression during developmental arrest.

Telomere position effect, an epigenetic phenomenon, has been proposed to play a critical role in VSG regulation, yet no telomeric protein has been identified whose disruption led to VSG derepression. We now identify tbRAP1 as an intrinsic component of the T. brucei telomere complex and a major regulator for silencing VSG expression sites (ESs). Knockdown of tbRAP1 led to derepression of all VSGs in silent ESs, but not VSGs located elsewhere, and resulted in stronger derepression of genes located within 10 kb from telomeres than genes located further upstream. This graduated silencing pattern suggests that telomere integrity plays a key role in tbRAP1-dependent silencing and VSG regulation."

Thus, hotspot tracks can reveal patterns of past mantle circulation."
https://openalex.org/W2030350258,"The importance of segmental duplications and copy number variants as a source of genetic and phenotypic variation is gaining greater appreciation, in a variety of organisms. Now, we have identified the Phytophthora sojae avirulence genes Avr1a and Avr3a and demonstrate how each of these Avr genes display copy number variation in different strains of P. sojae. The Avr1a locus is a tandem array of four near-identical copies of a 5.2 kb DNA segment. Two copies encoding Avr1a are deleted in some P. sojae strains, causing changes in virulence. In other P. sojae strains, differences in transcription of Avr1a result in gain of virulence. For Avr3a, there are four copies or one copy of this gene, depending on the P. sojae strain. In P. sojae strains with multiple copies of Avr3a, this gene occurs within a 10.8 kb segmental duplication that includes four other genes. Transcriptional differences of the Avr3a gene among P. sojae strains cause changes in virulence. To determine the extent of duplication within the superfamily of secreted proteins that includes Avr1a and Avr3a, predicted RXLR effector genes from the P. sojae and the P. ramorum genomes were compared by counting trace file matches from whole genome shotgun sequences. The results indicate that multiple, near-identical copies of RXLR effector genes are prevalent in oomycete genomes. We propose that multiple copies of particular RXLR effectors may contribute to pathogen fitness. However, recognition of these effectors by plant immune systems results in selection for pathogen strains with deleted or transcriptionally silenced gene copies."

Accordingly, many miRNAs are expressed preferentially in one or a small number of cell types. Yet the mechanisms responsible for this selectivity are not well understood. The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular basis of cell-specific expression of the pri-miR-375 gene, which is selectively expressed in pancreatic islets, and has been implicated both in the development of islets, and the function of mature pancreatic beta cells. An evolutionarily conserved 768 bp region of DNA upstream of the pri-miR-375 gene was linked to GFP and luciferase reporter genes, and expression monitored in transgenic mice and transfected cultured cells. Deletion and targeted mutagenesis analysis was used to evaluate the functional significance of sequence blocks within the upstream fragment. 5'-RACE analysis was used for mapping the pri-miR-375 gene transcription start site. The conserved 768 bp region was able to direct preferential expression of a GFP reporter gene to pancreatic islets in transgenic mice. Deletion analysis using a luciferase reporter gene in transfected cultured cell lines confirmed the cell specificity of the putative promoter region, and identified several key cis-elements essential for optimal activity, including E-boxes and a TATA sequence. Consistent with this, 5'-RACE analysis identified a transcription start site within this DNA region, 24 bp downstream of the TATA sequence. These studies define the promoter of the pri-miR-375 gene, and show that islet-specific expression of the pri-miR-375 gene is controlled at the transcriptional level. Detailed analysis of the transcriptional mechanisms controlling expression of miRNA genes will be essential to permit a comprehensive understanding of the complex role of miRNAs such as miR-375 in developmental processes."

In response to insulin, raptor binding to substrates is elevated through the release of the competitive inhibitor PRAS40 from mTORC1 (9Wang L. Rhodes C.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol.

In response to amino acid sufficiency, raptor directly interacts with a heterodimer of Rag GTPases and promotes mTORC1 localization to the Rheb-containing vesicular compartment (15Sancak Y.

Growth factors inhibit the GTPase-activating protein activity of TSC2 toward the small GTPase Rheb via the PI3K/Akt pathway (16Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat.

Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), and upon charging with GTP, Rheb functions as an mTORC1 activator (6Sancak Y. Thoreen C.C. Peterson T.R.

Cell. 2007; 25: 903-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). mTORC1 complexes isolated from growth factor-stimulated cells show increased kinase activity yet do not contain detectable levels of associated Rheb. Therefore, how Rheb-GTP binding to mTOR leads to an increase in mTORC1 activity toward substrates, and what the role of raptor is in this activation is currently unknown. More recently, the AMPK and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) have been reported to directly phosphorylate raptor and regulate mTORC1 activity. The phosphorylation of raptor directly by AMPK reduced mTORC1 activity, suggesting an alternative regulation mechanism independent of TSC2 in response to energy supply (20Gwinn D.M. Shackelford D.B.

RSK-mediated raptor phosphorylation enhances mTORC1 activity and provides a mechanism whereby stress may activate mTORC1 independent of the PI3K/Akt pathway (21Carriere A. Cargnello M. Julien L.A.

Therefore, the phosphorylation status of raptor can be critical for the regulation of mTORC1 activity. In this study, we investigated phosphorylation sites in raptor catalyzed by mTOR. Using two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping, we found that Ser863 and Ser859 in raptor were phosphorylated by mTOR both in vivo and in vitro. mTORC1 activity in vitro and in vivo is associated with the phosphorylation of Ser863 in raptor.

Phosphospecific antibodies to the Thr389 site in S6K1 were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. FLAG antibodies were from Sigma-Aldrich. Recombinant human insulin (Novolin R) was from Novo Nordisk. Rapamycin was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Tween 20 was from Fisher, and Triton X-100 was from Sigma-Aldrich. l-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was from Worthington. Cellulose TLC plates were from EMD Chemicals Inc. Cell Culture, Treatment, and Extract Preparation—3T3-L1 adipocytes were differentiated as described previously (9Wang L. Rhodes C.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24293-24303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and were used in 10–12 days. HEK293, HEK293E, and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and used for transfection experiments. HEK293T cells were used to perform 32P labeling and phosphopeptide mapping experiments. When compared with HEK293 and HEK293T cells, there are low basal levels of the phosphorylation of mTOR targets in HEK293E cells, and thus, HEK293E cells were used for insulin signaling studies. For amino acid starvation, the culture medium was replaced with a solution containing 145 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 1.4 mm MgSO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, 0.2 mm sodium phosphate, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 for 1 h. To terminate the incubation, cells were rinsed once with chilled phosphate-buffered saline and then homogenized with a syringe with a 20-gauge needle in lysis buffer as described previously (9Wang L. Rhodes C.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24293-24303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were retained for analyses. Transfection and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes or 6-well plates. 24 h later, plasmids were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at 1:1 ratio (w/v). The cells were harvested and analyzed at 36 h after transfection. Cell extracts were incubated with antibodies (2 μg) bound to protein A- or G-agarose beads at 4 °C for 2 h with constant mixing. The beads were then washed four times. In Vitro Kinase Assay—As described (9Wang L. Rhodes C.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24293-24303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), immune complex beads were rinsed with 1 ml of kinase buffer (50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5μm microcystin LR, 10 mm HEPES, and 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4) and suspended in 60 μl of kinase buffer. The kinase reactions were initiated by adding to 20 μl of the suspension 5 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 0.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 1,000 mCi/mmol), 50 mm MnCl2, and 0.25μg of 4E-BP1 as substrates or no substrate for the phosphorylation of raptor-mTOR complex. Reactions were terminated after 30 min at 30 °C by adding SDS sample buffer. The relative amounts of 32P incorporation were determined by phosphorimaging after SDS-PAGE. In Vivo 32P Radiolabeling and Two-dimensional Phosphopeptide Mapping—In vivo 32P radiolabeling and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping were performed as described previously (23Wang L. Harris T.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15619-15627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Raptor by mTOR in Vitro—When conducting mTORC1 kinase assays in vitro with substrates such as 4E-BP1, S6K1, and PRAS40, we observed that both mTOR and raptor, isolated in the mTORC1 immune complex, also incorporated [γ-32P]ATP. mTOR has been previously observed to undergo autophosphorylation at Ser2481 (24Peterson R.T. Beal P.A. Comb M.J. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7416-7423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to investigate whether the phosphorylation of raptor is mediated by mTOR and to reveal, if possible, the functional consequences of raptor phosphorylation by mTOR. Triton X-100 causes disassociation of the mTOR-raptor complex, whereas nonionic detergents of Tween 20 do not (7Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar, 8Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). Therefore, cell extracts and immunoprecipitations were prepared in Tween 20 or Triton X-100 to isolate raptor immune complexes with or without mTOR. After incubation of the raptor immune complexes prepared in the presence of Tween 20 in vitro, raptor was phosphorylated, whereas incubation with [γ-32P]ATP/Mn2+ did not result in raptor phosphorylation when cell extracts were prepared with Triton X-100 (Fig. 1A). To confirm that the phosphorylation of raptor in vitro depends on mTOR activity, mTOR kinase dead (S2338A, KD) and constitutive active (deleting 2433–2451, ΔRD) mutants were utilized in the mTORC1 kinase assay. With equal amounts of raptor recovered by mTOR, when compared with wild type, the mTOR KD mutant largely abolished kinase activity toward raptor, whereas mTOR ΔRD substantially enhanced the phosphorylation of raptor (Fig. 1B). This suggests that the phosphorylation of raptor was dependent on mTOR kinase activity and inhibited by an intact regulatory domain of mTOR, as are the phosphorylations of mTORC1 substrates (4E-BP1, S6K1, and PRAS40). Of note, mTOR KD reduced the autophosphorylation of mTOR in vitro, but mTOR ΔRD did not affect autophosphorylation (Fig. 1B). The mechanism by which the inhibitory domain of mTOR controls kinase activity is unknown. To investigate further, we asked whether raptor phosphorylation is inhibited by rapamycin, the mTORC1-specific inhibitor. The mTORC1 immune complex was incubated with rapamycin and FKBP12. Incubating mTORC1 with rapamycin or FKBP12 alone was without effect on raptor phosphorylation; however, the combination of rapamycin and FKBP12 reduced the phosphorylation of raptor (Fig. 1C). Consistently, LY294002, which is also an inhibitor of PI3K/mTOR but by a different mechanism, abolished raptor phosphorylation as well. Taken together, the in vitro phosphorylation of raptor in mTORC1 is mediated by mTOR with similar characteristics as the other substrates of mTORC1 such as 4E-BP1, S6K1, and PRAS40. Phosphorylation of Raptor by mTOR in Vivo Maps to Ser859 and Ser863 and Is Sensitive to Rapamycin—The phosphorylation of raptor in cells was studied by expressing raptor in HEK293T cells labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. 32P-labeled recombinant raptor was immunoprecipitated by FLAG tag antibody and resolved by SDS-PAGE. A 32P-labeled raptor band with increased 32P suitable for mapping was obtained by overexpression of raptor (Fig. 2A). The raptor band was excised and digested by trypsin and then subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping analysis. Raptor phosphorylated by mTOR in vitro, prepared as described in the legend for Fig. 1 (panel A), was digested by trypsin and mixed with raptor peptides phosphorylated in vivo to compare raptor phosphorylation sites catalyzed by mTOR in vitro with those obtained in vivo. The major phosphorylated peptides in vivo were obtained as indicated by spots of a–d and in vitro as indicated by spots of 1–5 (Fig. 2B). Phosphopeptides of b, c, and d from raptor phosphorylated in vivo co-migrated with spots of 1, 2, and 4 from in vitro mTOR-phosphorylated peptides (Fig. 2B, last panel), suggesting that these peptides (spots b, c, and d) could be phosphorylated by mTOR in vivo. We noticed that some peptides, such as spot 3 and 5, were phosphorylated by mTOR in vitro but were not present in the in vivo raptor phosphopeptide map. The additional phosphopeptides arising from the in vitro kinase reaction is not unusual and could be from several sources. In addition to kinases in vitro being more promiscuous than in vivo, it is also possible that the dephosphorylation of some sites occurs more rapidly in vivo. Alternatively, there could be a loss of some proteins during the immunoprecipitation of mTORC1 that could change the phosphorylation of raptor by mTOR in vitro when compared in vivo. Mass spectrometry has become a powerful technology for phosphoproteomic studies, providing a starting point for biologic studies. Olsen et al. (25Olsen J.V. Blagoev B. Gnad F. Macek B. Kumar C. Mortensen P. Mann M. Cell. 2006; 127: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2750) Google Scholar) defined a phosphoproteome in HeLa cells after stimulation of epidermal growth factor. In this phosphopeptide library (Ref. 25Olsen J.V. Blagoev B. Gnad F. Macek B. Kumar C. Mortensen P. Mann M. Cell. 2006; 127: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2750) Google Scholar, document S2 in supplemental data) raptor phosphorylations at Ser859, Ser863, and Ser884 were detected. We mutated these serine residues to alanine and tested whether they are phosphorylated in cells by using two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. As shown in Fig. 2C, Ser863 and Ser859 were phosphorylated in vivo because the mutations of Ser to Ala at 863 and 859 eliminated phosphopeptides represented at spots b and c. Interestingly, mutation of Ser863 to Ala (S863A) caused the disappearance of both spot b and spot c, whereas mutation of Ser859 to Ala (S859A) only eliminated spot c (Fig. 2C). Because Ser859 and Ser863 reside in the same tryptic peptide of 850VLDTSSLTQSAPASPTNK868, the spot b and spot c likely represent different phosphorylation patterns within this single peptide. Spot c migrated slower in the first dimension and was less hydrophobic in the second dimension than spot b, suggesting that spot c has more phosphorylation than spot b. Thus, spot c represents the phosphorylation of both Ser863 and Ser859, and spot b represents a single phosphorylation. As only S863A but not S859A caused the disappearance of spot b, spot b most likely represents phosphorylation at Ser863. This suggests that Ser859 is phosphorylated only when Ser863 is phosphorylated first. The phosphopeptide mapping of mutation at Ser884 (S884A) remained unaltered when compared with wild type (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, we mutated Ser863 to Glu and Thr. As predicted, mutation of Ser863 to Glu eliminated phosphorylation at this site similar to the Ala mutant (supplemental Fig. S1A). Because in vitro mTORC1-mediated raptor phosphopeptides co-migrated with in vivo phosphopeptides containing Ser863 and Ser859 (spot 1 → b and spot 2 → c, Fig. 2B) and mutations of Ser863 and Ser859 to Ala eliminated spot 1 and 2 (data not shown), mTOR phosphorylates raptor at Ser863 and Ser859 in vitro as well. We next investigated whether the phosphorylation of Ser863 and Ser859 were regulated by growth factor stimulation and rapamycin. Because they have a low level of signaling and a robust response to insulin, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were utilized to analyze inducible raptor phosphorylation. After cells were labeled by [32P]orthophosphate, the mTORC1 complex was immunoprecipitated with raptor antibodies. In multiple experiments, the phosphorylation of the peptide represented in spot a appeared not to be affected by insulin and rapamycin treatments. In response to insulin stimulation, the phosphorylation of Ser863 and Ser859, represented in spot b and c, increased as a ratio when compared with spot a, and rapamycin treatment prior to insulin stimulation reduced the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Ser863 and Ser859 (Fig. 2D). Taking the phosphorylation of Ser863 and Ser859 by mTOR directly in vitro and their inhibition by rapamycin in vivo together, our data demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Ser863 and Ser859 is mediated by mTOR. When comparing the sequences of phosphorylation sites catalyzed by mTORC1 (4E-BP1, S6K1, and PRAS40) and sites catalyzed by mTORC2 (Akt1 and protein kinase C-α), there is not a high degree of selectivity (supplemental Fig. S1B). This may arise from the fact that the substrate specificity is largely dependent on the specific companion proteins of the complex (raptor for mTORC1 and rictor and SIN1 for mTORC2). For mTORC1, raptor binds to substrates, and the substrate specificity is mediated through the TOS motif within the substrates themselves (10Wang L. Harris T.E. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20036-20044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 11Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr.

J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24514-24524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, the phosphorylation sites characterized as catalyzed by mTOR have two distinct categories: sites directed by proline at +1 or +2 such as Thr36, Thr45, Thr69, and Ser64 in 4E-BP1, Ser183 in PRAS40, Ser450 in Akt1, and Ser637 in protein kinase C-α and sites with surrounding hydrophobic residues such as Thr389 in S6K1, Ser473 in Akt1, and Ser656 in protein kinase C-α. Ser863 and Ser859 in raptor both contain a proline at +1/+2, similar to the mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation sites found in the 4E-BPs and PRAS40. Further comparing the proline-directed phosphorylation sites catalyzed by mTOR reveals that the –3 position shows a bias for hydrophobic residues. Phosphorylation of Raptor at Ser863 Regulates mTORC1 Activity—To determine whether phosphorylations of raptor modulate mTOR function, mTORC1 activity in vitro and in vivo were compared for cells co-expressing mTOR with raptor versus mutants (S859A, S863A, and S884A). mTORC1 immune complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation of raptor with FLAG antibody. The mTORC1 activity in vitro was measured with 4E-BP1 as substrate. When compared with wild type raptor, the mutation of Ser863, but not Ser884, substantially reduced the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 catalyzed by mTORC1 in vitro (Fig. 3A). The mutation of Ser859 alone did not produce a significant decrease of mTORC1 activity. Because activation of mTORC1 activity is associated with an increase of 4E-BP1 binding to raptor (9Wang L. Rhodes C.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24293-24303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we examined 4E-BP1 binding to raptor phosphorylation mutants by using recombinant 4E-BP1 coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose. As shown in supplemental Fig. S2A, the raptor mutants of S859A, S863A, and S884A did not produce a significant change in binding to 4E-BP1 when compared with raptor wild type. This indicates that raptor phosphorylation does not affect 4E-BP1 binding to raptor and that the mechanism by which the phosphorylation of raptor promotes mTORC1 activity is not due to an increase in substrate binding. To measure the in vivo kinase activity of the expressed mTORC1, the mTOR rapamycin-resistant mutant (S2035W) was utilized, and endogenous mTORC1 activity was inhibited by rapamycin pretreatment. The mutant mTOR S2035W and S6K1 were expressed together with either raptor wild type or mutants in HEK293E cells, treated with rapamycin to block endogenous mTORC1 kinase activity, and then stimulated with insulin. Consistent with the mTORC1 activity in vitro, mutation of Ser863 to Ala decreased insulin-stimulated mTORC1 activity in vivo as shown by decreased phosphorylation of S6K at Thr389 (Fig. 3B), whereas mutation of Ser859 and Ser884 did not alter the phosphorylation of S6K at Thr389. Interestingly, when compared with the Ala mutant, mutation of Ser863 to Glu appears to mimic phosphorylation, as seen in the recovery of mTORC1 activity toward S6K at Thr389 after insulin treatment (supplemental Fig. S2B). However, we did not observe that the Ser-Glu mutant lead to increased basal mTORC1 activity (supplemental Fig. S2B). We discuss this in the below. Because overexpression of GTP-binding protein Rheb promotes mTORC1 activity (19Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), we tested whether the activation of mTORC1 by Rheb requires raptor phosphorylation. Rheb was co-expressed with rapamycin-resistant mTOR, raptor, and S6K1, and background of endogenous mTORC1 activity was knocked down with rapamycin pretreatment. Overexpression of Rheb enhanced the phosphorylation of S6K1 at Thr389, as expected. However, expression of raptor containing the Ala mutation at Ser863, but not Ser859 and Ser884, reduced the phosphorylation of S6K at Thr389 activated by Rheb expression (Fig. 3C, left panel). As reported before (19Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), overexpression of Rheb overcomes the inhibition of the phosphorylation of S6K1 by amino acid depletion in cell culture medium. When Rheb was overexpressed with raptor wild type and mutants and amino acids were withdrawn from the cell culture medium, the raptor Ser863 to Ala mutant suppressed the Rheb-mediated rescue of S6K1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C, right panel). Therefore, the phosphorylation of raptor at Ser863 appears to be associated with mTORC1 activity and plays a critical role on the activation of mTORC1 in response to insulin. We propose that in response to growth factors, Rheb provides an initial stimulation of mTOR kinase activity, and the activation of mTOR results in raptor phosphorylation at Ser863 and Ser859. Consequently, as an essential component of mTORC1, raptor phosphorylation leads to a stable activation of mTORC1 kinase activity toward downstream substrates such as S6K1 and 4E-BP1. It is possible that Rheb binding to mTOR initiates a conformational change in the mTOR complex. The subsequent phosphorylation of Ser863 stabilizes the proposed Rheb-mediated conformational change and leads to an activation of mTORC1 kinase activity that persists in the absence of Rheb association. However, merely mimicking phosphorylation at Ser863 by mutation to Glu is insufficient to initiate a conformational change in the absence of Rheb. Thus, in vivo the mutation of Ser863 to Glu does not increase basal mTORC1 kinase activity in the absence of Rheb activation. In addition, mTORC1 regulation consists of several relatively separate mechanisms. Raptor phosphorylation may modulate an increase in mTOR kinase activity toward substrates that have been bound by raptor, whereas substrate binding to raptor, which is essentially regulated by PRAS40 in response to insulin (10Wang L. Harris T.E. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20036-20044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), is independent of raptor phosphorylation. According to raptor phosphopeptide mapping analysis, mutation of Ser863 prevents the phosphorylation of both Ser863 and Ser859. It is possible that mTORC1 activity needs phosphorylation at both sites. Recently, Ser722 and Ser792 in raptor were identified as AMPK-mediated phosphorylation sites and required for the inhibition of mTORC1 induced by energy stress (20Gwinn D.M. Shackelford D.B.

All these sites are located in the region between the N-terminal conserved region and the C-terminal seven WD repeats. The raptor C terminus tightly interacts with mTOR (8Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D.

Mutation of raptor at Ser863 did not change raptor binding to 4E-BP1 as measured by interaction with 4E-BP1 recombinant protein-coupled beads. Similarly, RSK-mediated phosphorylation does not change raptor interaction with 4E-BP1 (21Carriere A. Cargnello M. Julien L.A. Gao H. Bonneil E. Thibault P. Roux P.P. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1269-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Therefore, although 4E-BP1 binding to raptor does increase after insulin-stimulated dissociation of PRAS40 (9Wang L. Rhodes C.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol.

Rather, the phosphorylation of raptor may promote the access of substrates bound to raptor to the mTOR kinase active site, probably due to a conformational change in mTORC1. As shown in Fig. 3A, mutation of Ser863 did not change raptor interaction with mTOR. However, because mTOR and raptor interactions are mediated by multiple sites, raptor phosphorylation might cause different directional interaction changes and thus leads to an undetectable association change in vitro. Finally, it cannot be excluded that the effects of raptor phosphorylation involve additional proteins or a phosphatase that modify mTORC1 activity. Because it contains several activity-modifying phosphorylation sites, the region between the N and C terminus in raptor is functionally important and worth further investigating.

Here, we demonstrate that the plant plasma membrane is the primary site for subcellular localization of the Pseudomonas syringae effector AvrPphB and five additional cysteine protease family members. AvrPphB and two AvrPphB-like effectors, ORF4 and NopT, autoproteolytically process following delivery into the plant cell to expose embedded sites for fatty acylation. Host-dependent lipidation of these three effectors directs plasma membrane localization and is required for the avirulence activity of AvrPphB. Surprisingly, the AvrPphB-like effectors RipT, HopC1, and HopN1 utilize an acylation-independent mechanism to localize to the cellular plasma membrane. Although some AvrPphB-like effectors employ acylation-independent localization strategies, others hijack the eukaryotic lipidation machinery to ensure plasma membrane localization, illustrating the diverse tactics employed by type III effectors to target specific subcellular compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1973039447,Synonymous codon usage and variations in the level of isoaccepting tRNAs exert a powerful selective force on translation fidelity. We have developed an algorithm to evaluate the relative rate of translation which allows large-scale comparisons of the non-uniform translation rate on the protein biogenesis. Using the complete genomes of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis we show that stretches of codons pairing to minor tRNAs form putative sites to locally attenuate translation; thereby the tendency is to cluster in near proximity whereas long contiguous stretches of slow-translating triplets are avoided. The presence of slow-translating segments positively correlates with the protein length irrespective of the protein abundance. The slow-translating clusters are predominantly located down-stream of the domain boundaries presumably to fine-tune translational accuracy with the folding fidelity of multidomain proteins. Translation attenuation patterns at highly structurally and functionally conserved domains are preserved across the species suggesting a concerted selective pressure on the codon selection and species-specific tRNA abundance in these regions.
https://openalex.org/W1989699984,"To elucidate the minimal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure needed for the viability of Escherichia coli, suppressor-free strains lacking either the 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid transferase waaA gene or derivatives of the heptosyltransferase I waaC deletion with lack of one or all late acyltransferases (lpxL/M/P) and/or various outer membrane biogenesis factors were constructed. Delta(waaC lpxL lpxM lpxP) and waaA mutants exhibited highly attenuated growth, whereas simultaneous deletion of waaC and surA was lethal. Analyses of LPS of suppressor-free waaA mutants grown at 21 degrees C, besides showing accumulation of free lipid IV(A) precursor, also revealed the presence of its pentaacylated and hexaacylated derivatives, indicating in vivo late acylation can occur without Kdo. In contrast, LPS of Delta(waaC lpxL lpxM lpxP) strains showed primarily Kdo(2)-lipid IV(A), indicating that these minimal LPS structures are sufficient to support growth of E. coli under slow-growth conditions at 21/23 degrees C. These lipid IV(A) derivatives could be modified biosynthetically by phosphoethanolamine, but not by 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose, indicating export defects of such minimal LPS. DeltawaaA and Delta(waaC lpxL lpxM lpxP) exhibited cell-division defects with a decrease in the levels of FtsZ and OMP-folding factor PpiD. These mutations led to strong constitutive additive induction of envelope responsive CpxR/A and sigma(E) signal transduction pathways. Delta(lpxL lpxM lpxP) mutant, with intact waaC, synthesized tetraacylated lipid A and constitutively incorporated a third Kdo in growth medium inducing synthesis of P-EtN and l-Ara4N. Overexpression of msbA restored growth of Delta(lpxL lpxM lpxP) under fast-growing conditions, but only partially that of the Delta(waaC lpxL lpxM lpxP) mutant. This suppression could be alleviated by overexpression of certain mutant msbA alleles or the single-copy chromosomal MsbA-498V variant in the vicinity of Walker-box II."
https://openalex.org/W2154489745,"GSH metabolism in yeast is carried out by the gamma-glutamyl cycle as well as by the DUG complex. One of the last steps in the gamma-glutamyl cycle is the cleavage of Cys-Gly by a peptidase to the constitutent amino acids. Saccharomyces cerevisiae extracts carry Cys-Gly dipeptidase activity, but the corresponding gene has not yet been identified. We describe the isolation and characterization of a novel Cys-Gly dipeptidase, encoded by the DUG1 gene. Dug1p had previously been identified as part of the Dug1p-Dug2p-Dug3p complex that operates as an alternate GSH degradation pathway and has also been suggested to function as a possible di- or tripeptidase based on genetic studies. We show here that Dug1p is a homodimer that can also function in a Dug2-Dug3-independent manner as a dipeptidase with high specificity for Cys-Gly and no activity toward tri- or tetrapeptides in vitro. This activity requires zinc or manganese ions. Yeast cells lacking Dug1p (dug1Delta) accumulate Cys-Gly. Unlike all other Cys-Gly peptidases, which are members of the metallopeptidase M17, M19, or M1 families, Dug1p is the first to belong to the M20A family. We also show that the Dug1p Schizosaccharomyces pombe orthologue functions as the exclusive Cys-Gly peptidase in this organism. The human orthologue CNDP2 also displays Cys-Gly peptidase activity, as seen by complementation of the dug1Delta mutant and by biochemical characterization, which revealed a high substrate specificity and affinity for Cys-Gly. The results indicate that the Dug1p family represents a novel class of Cys-Gly dipeptidases."
https://openalex.org/W2087400406,"Background The Mediator complex associates with RNA polymerase (Pol) II, and it is recruited to enhancer regions by activator proteins under appropriate environmental conditions. However, the issue of Mediator association in yeast cells is controversial. Under optimal growth conditions (YPD medium), we were unable to detect Mediator at essentially any S. cerevisiae promoter region, including those supporting very high levels of transcription. In contrast, whole genome microarray experiments in synthetic complete (SC) medium reported that Mediator associates with many genes at both promoter and coding regions. Principal Findings As assayed by chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that there are a small number of Mediator targets in SC medium that are not observed in YPD medium. However, most Mediator targets identified in the genome-wide analysis are false positives that arose for several interrelated reasons: the use of overly lenient cut-offs; artifactual differences in apparent IP efficiencies among different genomic regions in the untagged strain; low fold-enrichments making it difficult to distinguish true Mediator targets from false positives that occur in the absence of the tagged Mediator protein. Lastly, apparent Mediator association in highly active coding regions is due to a non-specific effect on accessibility due to the lack of nucleosomes, not to a specific association of Mediator. Conclusions These results indicate that Mediator does not bind to numerous sites in the yeast genome, but rather selectively associates with a limited number of upstream promoter regions in an activator- and stress-specific manner."

Ahmed A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 169: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Besides this pathway, ppGpp is also directly synthesized from GDP by the activity of RelA. Thereafter, ppGpp is degraded to GDP and pyrophosphate by the activity of SpoT, which is a RelA homolog with reciprocal activities for ppGpp degradation and synthesis (5.Johnson G.S. Adler C.R.

For several bacteria, SpoT physiologically acts as both the ppGpp synthetase and hydrolase and is known as the Rel/Spo homolog. The metabolism of these alarmone nucleotides is understood based on the function of these two enzymes, whereas recent studies have identified alternative players acting as ppGpp synthetase in bacteria (7.Lemos J.A.

The Nudix hydrolases constitute a large family of proteins that share a highly conserved amino acid sequence, the so-called “Nudix motif,” which is distributed in all living organisms (13.McLennan A.G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Almost all Nudix proteins possess a pyrophosphatase activity and specifically degrade a variety of substrates with the common structure of a nucleoside diphosphate linked to another moiety, X. The known substrates of Nudix proteins include (d)NTPs (14.Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 15.O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Bullions L.C.

Because several of these substrates exhibit cell toxicity, members of Nudix proteins are considered to act as “housecleaning” enzymes, sanitizing damaged nucleotides, metabolizing intermediates, or signaling molecules (22.Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance is still undetermined for many of the Nudix family proteins because their identified hydrolytic activities are mainly based on in vitro assays. To understand the biological significance of these Nudix proteins, identification of their “natural authentic substrates” or their physiologically significant in vivo activities must be determined. This study employed a combinatorial approach of transcriptomics and metabolomics to demonstrate that Ndx8, one of eight Nudix hydrolases in Thermus thermophilus HB8, catalyzes novel ppGpp decay and acts as a growth phase modulator under nutritionally defined conditions. Dominance of Ndx8 activity on intracellular ppGpp levels was found at the growth phase transition from the logarithmic growth phase (log phase) to the stationary phase, indicating that Ndx8 is a key administrator of growth in response to nutritional conditions. This is the first study directly demonstrating the existence of ppGpp pyrophosphatase activity in bacteria and should lead to the identification of similar activity in other organisms. Guanosine 3′,5′-bisphosphate (pGp) and ppGpp were purchased from TriLink Biotechnologies (San Diego, CA). Other nucleotide chemicals used in this study were from Sigma. TR medium (23.Hashimoto Y. Yano T. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was used as rich medium, and chemically synthetic (CS) medium (24.Tanaka T. Kawano N. Oshima T. J. Biochem. 1981; 89: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was used as nutritionally defined medium. The construction of the gene disruptant of ndx8 (ttha1939) and rsh (ttha1717) and their double mutant was performed as described previously (23.Hashimoto Y. Yano T. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The details are described in the supplemental data. T. thermophilus HB8 wild-type and mutant strains were grown at 70 °C while shaking at 180 rpm. For each experiment, the cells were precultured in TR medium twice until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.5, harvested by brief centrifugation, and suspended in fresh medium. For the growth experiment using rsh mutants, 1 ml of the seed culture was directly added to 100 ml of CS medium because the growth of these mutants was too slow to evaluate when the medium was completely exchanged. According to the growth curve, we defined the flexion point as the end of the log phase and indicated it as a zero time point (T0) of each culture. The difference interference contrast images were obtained with an Axioskop MOT 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Göttingen, Germany) equipped with a CoolSNAP fx CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Inc., Tucson, AZ). Observations were performed after 2 and 12 h from the end of the log phase in CS medium. The inter-septum distance of cells stained with propidium iodide was measured along the long axis of cells by using MetaMorph software (Version 4.6) (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA), and the average length was calculated from the measurement of 100 cells. The cells of the wild type and the ndx8 mutant grown in CS medium were harvested after 2 h from the end of the log phase. The RNA isolation and hybridization was performed as described previously (25.Shinkai A. Kira S. Nakagawa N. Kashihara A. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3891-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Sample preparation was performed four times independently, and the total RNA from each sample was hybridized on a different array. The probe array was scanned with a GeneArray scanner (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA), and the data analyses were performed by using GeneSpring GX (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Genes with a flag of “Presence” for more than four times were used for analysis. The intensities of the genes for each mutant sample were normalized relative to that of the wild-type sample in the respective experimental set, and genes that produced a >2-fold change in the average intensities were regarded as significant. The microarray data in this study have been deposited in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE8795. The extraction of nucleotides from cells was performed as reported previously with modifications (26.Kasai K. Nishizawa T. Takahashi K. Hosaka T. Aoki H. Ochi K. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 7111-7122Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The wild type and the ndx8 mutant grown in CS medium were harvested at the end of the log phase by centrifugation at 7,500 × g and 35 °C for 1 min. Cold 1 m formic acid containing 2 μm internal standards (MES, methionine sulfone, and d-camphor-10-sulfonic acid) was added to the cell pellet. After vortex and centrifugation (2,300 × g and 4 °C for 5 min), the supernatant was mixed with water-saturated phenol to denature the proteins. After the centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with chloroform to remove the lipid fraction. After the centrifugation, the supernatant was filtered (Mr cutoff of 5,000) and lyophilized, and the resulting dried extract was dissolved in 20 μl of water. Capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS) measurements were performed as described previously (27.Ohashi Y. Hirayama A. Ishikawa T. Nakamura S.

A. 2007; 1159: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this procedure, the recovery rates of nucleotides ranged from 60 to 90%, for example, 76, 81, 82, 63, 84, 76, 89, 57, and 66% for AMP, ADP, ATP, dATP, UDP, GDP, CDP, dTDP, and ppGpp, respectively. Three independent experiments were performed for each strain, and a total of 1,229 peaks were detected. Among them, the area of 236 peaks, which were present in more than two samples of both strains, was normalized by the area of the internal standard and the dry weight of the sample cells. The resulting “relative intensity” (per μg of weight) was used in Student's t tests, and peaks producing a p value < 0.05 were considered to be significant. The identification of annotated metabolites was confirmed based on their mass spectra and migration indices by using the metabolites library as described previously (27.Ohashi Y. Hirayama A. Ishikawa T. Nakamura S. Shimizu K. Ueno Y. Tomita M. Soga T. Mol. BioSyst. 2008; 4: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The ndx8 gene in plasmid pT7-blue (Novagen) was amplified by PCR with the primer pair 5′-ATGCGCCGGGAGATCCTG-3′ and 5′-AGAACCACGCGGAACCAGGAATTCATCCATATGACTAGTAGATCCTCTAGA-3′, which was designed to incorporate a thrombin cleavage site at the N terminus of the ndx8 gene product. Using EcoRI and BglII sites, the amplified fragment was ligated into plasmid pMAL-cRI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to express the target gene as a maltose-binding protein fusion. The resulting expression plasmid was used for the transformation of E. coli strain DH5α. A single transformant colony was grown at 37 °C to 1 × 108 cells/ml in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml of ampicillin. The cells were grown for 5 h and harvested. The cells were suspended into purification buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl and 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5) and disrupted by ultrasonication on ice. After the centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to an amylose resin column (New England Biolabs), and maltose-binding protein Ndx8 was purified by gradient elution of up to 100 mm maltose in the buffer. The maltose-binding protein tag was removed by adding 50 units of thrombin to the collected fraction containing 1 mm CaCl2. After incubating the mixture at 25 °C for 20 h, released maltose-binding protein was denatured by heating at 70 °C for 15 min. After the centrifugation, the supernatant was dialyzed at 4 °C against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. Precipitated Ndx8 was then recovered and dissolved in 20 mm glycine-HCl buffer, pH 3.0. The resulting solution was filtered (0.22-μm pore size), concentrated, and stored at 4 °C. Solutions contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 μm Ndx8, and 0.5 mm substrate, pH 8.2. Reactions were performed at 25 °C, which is a standard state, and for 30 min, and then stopped by adding an equal volume of 0.1 m H3PO4. The identification and quantification of products were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (AKTAexplorer 10S, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden) with an anion-exchange column (4.6 × 75 mm; TSK-GEL DEAE-2SW, Tosoh Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The elution was performed by using a linear gradient of 50–500 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.2, containing 20% (v/v) acetonitrile. For the ppGpp assay, the gradient was started at 200 mm sodium phosphate. The substrate and product were detected based on absorption at 252 and 260 nm, respectively. For the assay of ppGpp, the reaction rate was calculated from the production of all products: pGp, ppGp, and pGpp. For the assay of 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate, a colorimetric procedure (30.Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was performed to measure the production of inorganic phosphate. The cells of the wild type and the ndx8 mutant were grown in 100 ml of CS medium in a 500-ml flask and were harvested through the growth phase transition from the log phase to the stationary phase (from T−2 to T6). The extraction of nucleotide and the quantification of ppGpp using HPLC were performed as described above. The quantification of GDP was performed by using a reverse-phase column (CAPCELPAK C18 MG, Shiseido Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The column was equilibrated with buffer A (10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mm tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, and 15% (v/v) MeOH). The elution was performed with a gradient from 0 to 25% buffer B (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 4.5, 5 mm tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, and 20% (v/v) MeOH). Compounds were detected by absorption at 252, 260, and 280 nm. The peaks corresponding to ppGpp and GDP were identified from the elution profile of an authentic standard mixed with extracted metabolites and the relative intensity in three wavelengths. In this study, three independent experiments were performed for each strain. In T. thermophilus, the ndx8 gene codes for an 18-kDa protein, Ndx8, which carries a “Nudix motif.” An ndx8-null mutant was constructed to investigate its phenotype under nutritionally rich and defined conditions. Based on the growth curve with A600, the flexion point was defined as the end of the log phase (T0), which is a growth transition from vegetative growth to the stationary phase. In a nutritionally defined minimal medium (CS medium), the ndx8 mutant showed advanced growth arrest (Fig. 2A). During the vegetative growth (T−5–T0), the increase in A600 and the dry weight of the wild-type and ndx8 mutant cells were almost the same. However, at the end of the log phase (T0–T1), the A600 value for the mutant abruptly dropped, and it again increased until the stationary phase. In addition, the increase in the dry weight of cells also was arrested for the mutant after the temporary drop of the growth curve. The morphology of the cells was observed using difference interference contrast microscopy (Fig. 2, C–F). Intriguingly, the mutant cells showed a remarkable aggregation immediately after the end of the log phase. A similar aggregation of cells was also observed in the wild type, whereas it appeared in the stationary phase. Moreover, the mutant cells also exhibited striking cellular elongation at an earlier growth stage than the wild type (Fig. 2, G and H). The average length of the mutant cells was significantly extended to 4.6 μm, whereas that of the wild-type cells was 2.7 μm immediately after the end of the log phase. On the other hand, the cell lengths of both strains were similar after the transition to the stationary phase. Notably, the above phenotype was not observed for the mutant cells grown in TR medium (Fig. 2B), indicating the malnutrition-dependent property of the ndx8 mutant. To characterize the observed phenotype of the ndx8 mutant, the differences in transcriptional features between the mutant and the wild type were investigated. Both strains grown in CS medium were harvested immediately after the end of the log phase, when the mutant cells exhibited cellular aggregation. Among the 2,349 genes on the array, 308 genes exhibited a significant change in the expression level (>2-fold) between the mutant and the wild type (see supplemental Table S1 for the entire list of genes). For the mutant, the expression of 221 genes was repressed and that of 87 genes was activated relative to the wild type (Table 1). The down-regulated group included genes involved in cell growth, e.g. translational machineries, DNA replication (dnaB), and cell division (ftsZ) (31.Hale C.A. de Boer P.A. Cell. 1997; 88: 175-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). For the mutant, genes involved in following metabolic pathways were also repressed: tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino acid metabolism, cobalamin biosynthesis, coenzyme metabolism, metabolism of redox reactions, and fatty acid biosynthesis. In addition, 33 genes, which are predicted to code for membrane transporters, were also repressed in the mutant. The up-regulated group included genes of ammonia assimilation, stress response (dnaK and grpER), and three transcriptional regulators.TABLE 1Transcriptional features of the ndx8 mutantFunctionNo.GenesDown-regulated genes in the ndx8 mutantMetabolismAmino acid metabolism18arg, asd, gcvPB, gdhA, hpaB, hpaE, ilvC, ilvD, ilvN, leuA, leuB, leuC, leuD, mhpC, mhpD, mhpE, tyrA, ttha1378TCA cycle12fumC, gltA, icdA, korA, korB, lpdA, mdh, sdhA, sdhB, sdhD, sucA, sucBCobalamine biosynthesis11bluB, cbiB, cbiD, cbiG, cbiL, cbiX, cobH, cobJ, cobL, cysG, tthb055Redox reaction10aceA, etfB, glcF, pilQ, ttha0753, tthat1326, ttha1763, ttha1764, tthb012, tthb250Coenzyme metabolism8acs1, acs2, acs3, pntA1, pntA2, pntB, thiD, ttha0511Fatty acid biosynthesis7desA, fabG, fadD1, fadD2, fadD3, ttha0461, ttha0586Other16Cell doubling15dnaB, fusA, ftsZ, grs1, rlpE, rlpJ, rlpL, rlpO, rlpP, rlpW, rlpX, rspQ, rspS, tthaA0813, ttha1452Transporters33copB, livF, livF2, livG, livH, livH2, livK, modB, and 25 genes without orthologOther26Hypothetical protein65 (total 221 genes)Up-regulated genes in the ndx8 mutantMetabolismAmmonia assimilation12amt, argC, argF, argG, argH, argJ, carA, carB, glmS, glnA, glnB, gltBAmino acid metabolism5dpaA, hpaB, hpaE, hpaG, ttha1457Others9Stress response10dnaK, grpER, and 8 genes without an orthologOther24Hypothetical protein27 (total 87 genes) Open table in a new tab Metabolomics analysis using CE-TOFMS was employed to identify the potential substrate(s) of Ndx8. According to the hypothesis that the loss of Ndx8 activity results in the accumulation of its substrate and that it might trigger the observed phenotype of the ndx8 mutant, this method screened for metabolites accumulating in the mutant cell just before the appearance of the phenotype. Extracted metabolites were then measured by CE-TOFMS tuned for high molecular weight anion metabolites containing nucleotides (Fig. 3). Among a total of 236 signals, which were detected in both strains with good reproducibility (n > 2; see supplemental Table S2 for the entire list of peaks), 57 metabolites were identified as pre-annotated compounds based on the m/z and migration time in CE-TOFMS. From the comparison between the two strains, 11 metabolites exhibited a significant difference (p < 0.05 in Student's t test; Fig. 3B). Among the 10 metabolites accumulating in the mutant cells, the following compounds were assumed to be substrates for Nudix proteins and were therefore regarded as candidates for natural authentic substrates of Ndx8 in vivo: 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate, CDP, GDP, UTP, dATP, GDP-glucose, ppGpp, and NAD+. The in vitro hydrolytic activity of purified Ndx8 was evaluated for metabolites that accumulated in the ndx8 mutant cells and for given substrates of Nudix proteins (Fig. 4A). As predicted from the sequence homology, Ndx8 exhibited pyrophosphatase activity for (d)NDPs except for cytidine derivatives. The preferential substrates contained GDP, which was accumulated in the mutant cells. As for all other Nudix proteins, Ndx8 required divalent cations for the activity, for example, Mg2+ with maximum activity, Mn2+ or Zn2+ with partial activity, but Co2+ and Cu2+ with no activity. Notably, Ndx8 also showed high degradation activity for ppGpp and generated pGp as a final product (Fig. 4B). The ppGpp degradation by Ndx8 also produced two peaks detected in elution volumes 20 and 21 ml in HPLC. After a long term reaction, the area values of these two peaks were reduced accompanied with the consumption of ppGpp, and the area value of the pGp peak was increased instead (data not shown). This result suggests that these peaks corresponded to reaction intermediates ppGp and pGpp because most Nudix proteins hydrolyze phosphodiester bonds in substrates. This hypothesis was also supported by the elution profile in anion-exchange chromatography, suggesting that these two intermediates possessed higher negative charges than that for pGp. The structural difference between ppGp and pGpp, such as the position of phosphodiester group on the ribose, was considered to yield their separation into two peaks, although we were not able to identify which of them corresponded to ppGp or pGpp. On the other hand, no degradation activity was observed for any other substrates including the candidates proposed from metabolomics screening. The intracellular profiles of ppGpp and GDP were assessed to demonstrate the direct connection between the in vitro degradation activity of Ndx8 and the growth phenotype of the ndx8 mutant. The cellular extracts were prepared from the wild type and the ndx8 mutant grown in CS medium and analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 5). In the ndx8 mutant, the intracellular level of ppGpp transiently increased at the end of the log phase and then dropped to the stationary phase (Fig. 5A). The maximum level in the mutant tended to fluctuate, whereas it was 2.3- to 3.2-fold-higher than that in the wild type in each of three independent experiments. The intracellular amount of ppGpp was maintained at the same level between both strains after the emergence of the cellular aggregation for the mutant cells. In contrast, the intracellular level of GDP was almost the same between these two strains at the end of the log phase, and both strains increased slightly (Fig. 5B). After the time point, although the precise levels tended to fluctuate, the level for the mutant was higher than that for the wild type. The phenotypic influence of the ndx8 gene disruption in a ppGpp-free (ppGpp0) strain was investigated to certify the physiological significance of the ppGpp degradation by Ndx8. An rsh-null mutant strain that lacks ppGpp synthesis activity was constructed and used to evaluate the phenotypic changes caused by the ndx8 gene disruption (Fig. 6). If the ndx8 rsh double mutant could grow like the wild type, this would provide evidence that the growth arrest found in the ndx8 mutant is directly associated with the accumulation of ppGpp. The rsh mutant could not grow on nutritionally defined CS plates (Fig. 6B), suggesting the multiple amino acid auxotrophy of the cells as shown previously in E. coli and T. thermophilus (26.Kasai K. Nishizawa T. Takahashi K. Hosaka T. Aoki H. Ochi K. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 7111-7122Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32.Xiao H. Kalman M. Ikehara K. Zemel S. Glaser G. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5980-5990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in this experiment, all strains precultured in TR medium were directly inoculated into CS medium by a dilution factor of 101. This seemed to cause contamination of limited nutrients, especially for several amino acids, resulting in permissive growth for the rsh mutants. The growth curve clearly showed (Fig. 6A) that A600 for the ndx8 rsh double mutant was increased continuously until the stationary phase without a transient drop. Although the rate of increase in the A600 for the double mutant was slightly lower than that for the wild type, it was almost the same as that for the rsh single mutant. Notably, the resumption of the increase in A600 for the ndx8 single mutant (Fig. 6A) tended to be slow relative to the result of Fig. 2A. Because the inoculation procedures were different between these two experiments, a subtle difference in nutritional conditions at the culture initiation is considered to influence the observed duration.

https://openalex.org/W2102143672,"Sister chromatid separation is triggered by the separase-catalyzed cleavage of cohesin. This process is temporally controlled by cell-cycle-dependent factors, but its biochemical mechanism and spatial regulation remain poorly understood. We report that cohesin cleavage by human separase requires DNA in a sequence-nonspecific manner. Separase binds to DNA in vitro, but its proteolytic activity, measured by its autocleavage, is not stimulated by DNA. Instead, biochemical characterizations suggest that DNA mediates cohesin cleavage by bridging the interaction between separase and cohesin. In human cells, a fraction of separase localizes to the mitotic chromosome. The importance of the chromosomal DNA in cohesin cleavage is further demonstrated by the observation that the cleavage of the chromosome-associated cohesins is sensitive to nuclease treatment. Our observations explain why chromosome-associated cohesins are specifically cleaved by separase and the soluble cohesins are left intact in anaphase."
https://openalex.org/W1995175147,"Most genes function at multiple stages of metazoan development, in dividing and nondividing cells. Generating mouse conditional knock-outs (cKO), where a gene can be eliminated in a temporally and spatially controlled manner, is a valuable technique because it allows study of gene function at any stage of life. In contrast and despite the development of many other powerful genetic tools, cKO has thus far been lacking in Drosophila . We combined several recent molecular and genetic technical advances in an approach termed integrase-mediated approach for gene knock-out (IMAGO). IMAGO allows the replacement of any genomic sequence, such as a gene, with another desired sequence, including cKO alleles that can be used to create positively marked mutant cells. IMAGO should also be applicable to other genetic model organisms."

(2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 105, 14849–14854). We discovered here that cobalt was inserted into both the cobalt-free NhlAE (apo-NhlAE) and the cobalt-free α-subunit (apo-α-subunit) in an NhlE-dependent manner in the presence of cobalt and dithiothreitol in vitro. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy analysis revealed that the non-oxidized cysteine residues in apo-NhlAE were post-translationally oxidized after cobalt insertion. These findings suggested that NhlE has two activities, i.e. cobalt insertion and cysteine oxidation. NhlE not only functions as a self-subunit swapping chaperone but also a metallochaperone that includes a redox function. Cobalt insertion and cysteine oxidation occurred under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions when Co3+ was used as a cobalt donor, suggesting that the oxygen atoms in the oxidized cysteines were derived from water molecules but not from dissolved oxygen.

Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1 produces high and low molecular mass NHases (H-NHase and L-NHase), which exhibit different physicochemical properties and substrate specificities (1Kobayashi M. Shimizu S.

Acrylamide is manufactured at the industrial level not only in Japan but also in the United States and France (17Kobayashi M. Nagasawa T. Yamada H.

Metalloproteins have been characterized intensively for decades yet only recently have investigators focused on the mechanisms underlying biological metallocenter assembly (19Kuchar J. Hausinger R.P. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 509-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The synthesis of some metalloproteins has been found to require the participation of accessory proteins (19Kuchar J. Hausinger R.P. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 509-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). An open reading frame, nhlE, which is just downstream of the structural genes of L-NHase (nhlBA), is necessary for functional L-NHase maturation (20Zhou Z. Hashimoto Y. Shiraki K. Kobayashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 14849-14854Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast to the cobalt-containing cysteine-oxidized L-NHase (holo-α2β2) derived from nhlBAE, the gene product derived from nhlBA is a non-oxidized cobalt-free apo-L-NHase (20Zhou Z. Hashimoto Y. Shiraki K. Kobayashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 14849-14854Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). An L-NHase maturation mediator, NhlAE (encoded by the nhlAE genes, and consisting of αe2 containing the cobalt-containing cysteine-oxidized α-subunit of L-NHase), has been discovered, and the incorporation of cobalt into L-NHase has been found to depend on the α-subunit exchange between apo-L-NHase and NhlAE. This is a novel post-translational maturation process different from general mechanisms of metallocenter biosynthesis known so far. Thus, we named it self-subunit swapping (Fig. 1(i)) (20Zhou Z.

Among these enzymes, NHase and thiocyanate hydrolase are intriguing ones because they possess both Cys-SO2H and Cys-SOH as ligands of the metal center and neither residue plays any catalytic redox role at all (29Claiborne A. Yeh J.I. Mallett T.C. Luba J. Crane E.J. Charrier V. Parsonage D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15407-15416Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Although the oxidized cysteine residues in both enzymes are essential for their activities (20Zhou Z. Hashimoto Y. Shiraki K. Kobayashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Non-corrin cobalt enzymes like NHase are receiving increasing interest not only in bioinorganic chemistry but also in biotechnology, and their availability and remarkable chemical versatility make them invaluable catalysts in the chemical industry (6Kobayashi M.

Although we have discovered a cobalt transporter (NhlF) that mediates cobalt uptake into the cell (38Komeda H. Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the mechanism underlying the insertion of a cobalt into a noncorrin-cobalt-containing protein in the cell has never been clarified. In this study we discovered that cobalt was directly inserted into a non-oxidized apo-α-subunit on the addition of NhlE, which yielded a cobalt-containing cysteine-oxidized NhlAE in vitro, suggesting that NhlE acts as a metallochaperone that is crucial for both post-translational cysteine oxidation and cobalt incorporation into the α-subunit of L-NHase (Fig. 1(ii)). Bacterial Strain and Plasmid Used—Rhodococcus fascians DSM43985 was used as the host for vector plasmid pREIT19, which was used for nhlBAE, nhlAE, and nhlBA-(α-A3G) expression as described previously (20Zhou Z. Hashimoto Y. Shiraki K. Kobayashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 14849-14854Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Culture Conditions—The R. fascians DSM43985 transformants carrying pREIT-nhlAE for holo-αe2 expression were grown at 28 °C for 72 h in 2YT medium containing CoCl2·6H2O (0.1 g/liter) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and 0.1% (v/v) of isovaleronitrile, as an inducer, was added to the medium after incubation for 12 h. R. fascians DSM43985 transformants carrying pREIT-nhlBAE were grown under the same conditions for 96 h except that the inducer was continuously added every 24 h for a total of 4 times to increase the amount of L-NHase expressed. The R. fascians DSM43985 transformants carrying pREIT-nhlAE, pREIT-nhlBAE, and pREIT-nhlBA-(α-A3G) used for apoprotein expression were incubated under the same conditions except that CoCl2·6H2O was not added to the medium. Protein Purification—Proteins were purified in the same manner as that described previously (20Zhou Z. Hashimoto Y. Shiraki K. Kobayashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 14849-14854Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) except that 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (KPB) (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) was used in all purification steps. No influence on L-NHase activity was observed under these purification conditions. The apo-L-NHases purified under these conditions were mostly of the heterotetramer form (apo-α2β2), and only little heterodimer forms (apo-αβ) were detected. Thus, the purified apo-α2β2 was used as the apo-L-NHase in this study. In Vitro Activation of Apo-α2β2—The routine apo-α2β2 activation buffer consisted of 10 mm KPB (pH 7.5), 10 μm cobalt, and 2 mm DTT unless otherwise noted. The final concentrations of apo-α2β2 and apo-αe2 in the activation buffer were 0.1 and 0.4 mg/ml, respectively. A CoCl2 solution was used as a cobalt donor unless otherwise noted. The mixtures were incubated at 28 °C. Purification of Resultant Proteins—Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200-pg (GE Healthcare) and Resource Q (6 ml) (GE Healthcare) columns were used to purify the resultant L-NHases and NhlAEs from mixtures in the same way as described previously (20Zhou Z. Hashimoto Y. Shiraki K. Kobayashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 14849-14854Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) except that 10 mm KPB (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 mm DTT was used. Enzyme Assay—L-NHase activity was assayed in a reaction mixture (0.5 ml) comprising 10 mm KPB (pH 7.5), 20 mm 3-cyanopyridine, and 10 μl of enzyme containing activation buffer or an appropriate amount of the enzyme. The reaction was carried out at 20 °C for 20 min and stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of acetonitrile. The amount of nicotinamide formed in the reaction mixture was determined as described previously (20Zhou Z. Hashimoto Y. Shiraki K. Kobayashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 14849-14854Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). One unit of L-NHase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the release of 1 μmol of nicotinamide per min at 20 °C. Denaturation of NhlAE and Renaturation of the α-Subunit and NhlE—The denaturation and renaturation experiments were carried out at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). SDS was carefully added to NhlAE, which had been mixed with 2-mercaptoethanol. The concentrations of resultant apo-αe2 (R-apo-αe2) and SDS were both 0.2 mg/ml, and that of 2-mercaptoethanol was 10% (v/v) (final, respectively). After 2 h, the α-subunit and NhlE were purified by gel filtration on a Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200-pg column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1% SDS. After dialysis, the SDS remaining with the α-subunit was eliminated with a Resource Q column (6 ml) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), and the protein was eluted with 0.5 liters of the buffer by increasing the concentration of KCl linearly from 0 to 0.5 m. This step was carried out twice to isolate the α-subunit. These two procedures were carried out with an AKTA purifier (GE Healthcare). Gel filtration chromatograph analysis was performed for molecular mass determination, the flow rate being 0.5 ml/min. A Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) and 0.2 m KCl-containing buffer were used for estimation of the molecular masses of the purified α-subunits and NhlE. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) Sequencing—MALDI-TOF MS was typically performed using a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) in the linear positive mode. The purified α-subunit derived from R-apo-αe2 was reduced with 1 mm DTT and carboxamidomethylated with 2.1 mm iodoacetamide and then diluted with 3 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and treated with trypsin at 35 °C for 20 h. The details were given previously (20Zhou Z. Hashimoto Y. Shiraki K. Kobayashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 14849-14854Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Other Analytical Methods—CD measurement, UV-Visible Measurement, and Cobalt Ion Determination Were Described Previously (20Zhou Z. Hashimoto Y. Shiraki K. Kobayashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 14849-14854Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Post-translational Activation of Apo-L-NHase by Apo-αe2 in the Presence of Cobalt in Vitro—Previous work (20Zhou Z. Hashimoto Y. Shiraki K. Kobayashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 14849-14854Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) has shown that apo-L-NHase is converted into holo-α2β2 after mixing with holo-αe2 through self-subunit swapping maturation. To determine whether cobalt could be directly incorporated into apo-L-NHase to yield holo-L-NHase, we mixed apo-L-NHase (apo-α2β2, see “Experimental Procedures”) with cobalt (20 μm, final) in 10 mm KPB (pH 7.5) and then measured the L-NHase activity in the mixture. As shown in Fig. 2, no significant increase in L-NHase activity was observed. However, we found that L-NHase activity increased when apo-αe2 was mixed in additionally and that the L-NHase activity significantly increased when 0.5 mm DTT was further added to this mixture (Fig. 2). These findings indicated that apo-α2β2 was post-translationally activated by apo-αe2 in the presence of cobalt and that the post-translational activation was enhanced by the addition of DTT in vitro. Subsequently, the effect of the DTT concentration on activation of apo-α2β2 by apo-αe2 in the presence of cobalt was investigated. Mixtures were incubated with various concentrations of DTT, and then the L-NHase activity in each activation mixture at 12 h was measured. The L-NHase activity in the activation mixtures became higher as the DTT concentration increased, but more than 4 mm DTT caused a decrease in activation competence (see Fig. 3A and “Discussion”). These findings suggest that a certain amount of DTT is necessary for activation of apo-α2β2 by apo-αe2 in the presence of cobalt and that the suitable concentration of DTT is 2 mm. Thereafter, the effect of the cobalt concentration on activation of apo-α2β2 was investigated with this suitable DTT concentration. The L-NHase activity in the activation mixtures reached a plateau with 10 μm cobalt added (Fig. 3B). Thus, an activation mixture containing 2 mm DTT and 10 μm cobalt provided the optimal conditions and, thus, was used in the following experiments.FIGURE 3Activation of apo-α2β2 by apo-αe2 under various conditions in vitro. A, effect of the DTT concentration on apo-α2β2 activation. Apo-α2β2 was mixed with apo-αe2 in the activation buffer containing 20 μm CoCl2 and 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 mm DTT. B, effect of the cobalt concentration on apo-α2β2 activation. Apo-α2β2 was mixed with apo-αe2 in the activation buffer containing 2 mm DTT and 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, or 80 μm CoCl2. Aliquots of the samples were removed at 12 h and then assayed for L-NHase activity. Values represent the means ± S.D. for at least triplicate independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Direct Incorporation of Cobalt into Apo-αe2—Site-directed mutagenesis and N-terminal amino acid sequence analyses were performed to confirm the source of the α-subunit in the active L-NHase derived from the mixture of apo-α2β2, apo-αe2, cobalt, and DTT. As a result, the source of the α-subunit in the active L-NHase was found to be the apo-αe2 (supplemental Fig. S1 and Table S1), demonstrating that the activation of apo-α2β2 was dependent on self-subunit swapping. We have already demonstrated that self-subunit swapping occurs between apo-α2β2 and holo-αe2 but not between apo-α2β2 and apo-αe2 (20Zhou Z. Hashimoto Y. Shiraki K. Kobayashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 14849-14854Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Considering these findings, we speculated that cobalt should be first inserted into the cobalt-free α-subunit (apo-α-subunit) of apo-αe2 to yield the cobalt-containing α-subunit (holo-α-subunit), resulting in the formation of holo-αe2, and then self-subunit swapping occurs between apo-α2β2 and this holo-αe2 to yield holo-α2β2. To test this hypothesis, we mixed apo-αe2 with cobalt and DTT in the absence of apo-α2β2. The R-apo-αe2 was purified after incubation for 4 h (Fig. 4A) and then compared with apo-αe2 and holo-αe2. The results of cobalt content determination showed that R-apo-αe2 contained 0.98 ± 0.08 mol ion/mol of αe2, similar to the content of holo-αe2 (Table 1). Although R-apo-αe2, holo-αe2, and apo-αe2 showed similar CD spectra (Fig. 4B), the UV-visible spectrum of R-apo-αe2 was similar to that of holo-αe2 but not to that of apo-αe2 (Fig. 4C). It has been reported that the absorption in the 300–350-nm region for Co-NHase reflects S → Co3+ charge transfer (7Payne M.S. Wu S. Fallon R.D. Tudor G. Stieglitz B. Turner Jr., I.M. Nelson M.J.

A. 2008; 105: 14849-14854Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4C, an extra shoulder in the 300–350-nm region was found for R-apo-αe2 as well as holo-αe2, suggesting that the cobalt-ligand environment of R-apo-αe2 is the same as those of holo-αe2 and Co-NHases. On the other hand, we also mixed apo-α2β2 with cobalt and DTT in the absence of apo-αe2. The resultant apo-α2β2 (R-apo-α2β2) was purified after incubation for 4 h and then compared with apo-α2β2 and holo-α2β2. The UV-visible spectrum of R-apo-α2β2 was similar to that of apo-α2β2, but not to that of holo-α2β2, and no extra shoulder in the 300–350-nm region was observed (supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast to the cobalt content of holo-α2β2 (0.88 ± 0.03 mol/mol of αβ), only 0.16 ± 0.03 mol cobalt ion/mol of αβ was detected in R-apo-α2β2 (Table 1). These findings demonstrated that a cobalt ion was directly incorporated into the apo-α-subunit of apo-αe2 (Fig. 1 (ii)) but not into that of apo-α2β2 in vitro.TABLE 1Characterization of the purified NhlAEs, L-NHases, α-subunits, R-NhlAEs, R-L-NHases, and R-α-subunit"
https://openalex.org/W2030753117,"ADP plays an integral role in the process of hemostasis by signaling through two platelet G-protein-coupled receptors, P2Y1 and P2Y12. The recent use of antagonists against these two receptors has contributed a substantial body of data characterizing the ADP signaling pathways in human platelets. Specifically, the results have indicated that although P2Y1 receptors are involved in the initiation of platelet aggregation, P2Y12 receptor activation appears to account for the bulk of the ADP-mediated effects. Based on this consideration, emphasis has been placed on the development of a new class of P2Y12 antagonists (separate from clopidogrel and ticlopidine) as an approach to the treatment of thromboembolic disorders. The present work examined the molecular mechanisms by which two of these widely used adenosine-based P2Y12 antagonists (2-methylthioadenosine 5'-monophosphate triethylammonium salt (2MeSAMP) and ARC69931MX), inhibit human platelet activation. It was found that both of these compounds raise platelet cAMP to levels that substantially inhibit platelet aggregation. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that this elevation of cAMP did not require Gi signaling or functional P2Y12 receptors but was mediated through activation of a separate G protein-coupled pathway, presumably involving Gs. However, additional experiments revealed that neither 2MeSAMP nor ARC69931MX (cangrelor) increased cAMP through activation of A2a, IP, DP, or EP2 receptors, which are known to couple to Gs. Collectively, these findings indicate that 2MeSAMP and ARC69931MX interact with an unidentified platelet G protein-coupled receptor that stimulates cAMP-mediated inhibition of platelet function. This inhibition is in addition to that derived from antagonism of P2Y12 receptors."

PTP opening, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial volume, and NAD(P)H localization were assessed by time-lapse laser confocal microscopy using the calcein-cobalt technique, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester, MitoTracker, and NAD(P)H autofluorescence, respectively. Concomitant with PTP opening, NAD(P)H fluorescence increased outside mitochondria. These events occurred in all cells and were prevented by cyclosporin A. Mitochondrial membrane potential was not systematically collapsed, whereas mitochondrial volume did not change, confirming that A23187 induced transient PTP opening in a subpopulation of cells and suggesting that mitochondrial swelling did not immediately occur after PTP opening in intact cells. NAD(P)H autofluorescence remained elevated after PTP opening, particularly after membrane potential had been collapsed by an uncoupler. Extraction of nucleotide for NAD(P)H quantification confirmed that PTP opening led to an increase in NAD(P)H content. Because the oxygen consumption rate decreased, whereas the lactate/pyruvate ratio increased after PTP opening in intact cells, we conclude that PTP opening inhibits respiration and dramatically affects the cytosolic redox potential in intact cells.

Although its molecular nature remains a matter of debate, the role of the PTP in cell death is now well acknowledged, especially when cell death is triggered by oxidative stress (3Baines C.P.

Under normal physiological conditions, the mitochondrial inner membrane is impermeable to almost all metabolites and ions. The compounds that enter or leave mitochondria are generally transported via specific and highly controlled carriers (6Palmieri F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 689-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Consequently, intra- and extramitochondrial environments are significantly different in ionic composition. PTP opening dramatically changes the properties of the inner membrane, making it unspecifically permeable to molecules smaller than 1500 Da, which thus equilibrate according to their concentration gradient (1Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar). In isolated mitochondria, PTP opening leads to the collapse of the protonmotive force and the release of matrix NADH (7Fontaine E. Eriksson O. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12662-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 8Vinogradov A. Scarpa A. Chance B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 152: 646-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). When incubated in the standard media used with isolated organelles, PTP opening leads to mitochondrial swelling because of the presence of matrix proteins that cannot diffuse through the open pore, thus creating an oncotic pressure gradient. This oncotic pressure gradient can be eliminated by incubating mitochondria in media containing osmotic molecules larger than 1500 Da, a particular condition in which PTP opening occurs in the absence of mitochondrial swelling (9Massari S. Azzone G.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 283: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Concomitant to this change in permeability, PTP opening in isolated mitochondria also leads to a partial inhibition of respiratory chain Complex 1 and to a dramatic increase in reactive oxygen species production (10Batandier C. Leverve X. Fontaine E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17197-17204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). It has long been recognized that PTP opening is a reversible event (11Haworth R.A. Hunter D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). However, not all the consequences of PTP opening are reversible. Closure of the pore restores the protonmotive force and the ionic homeostasis of compounds that are physiologically transported, whereas compounds that only diffuse through an open PTP remain either entrapped or excluded after they have entered or left mitochondria, respectively (12Crompton M. Costi A. Hayat L. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Consequently, PTP closure in isolated mitochondria does not lead to mitochondrial shrinkage in sucrose- or KCl-based media (13Petronilli V. Nicolli A. Costantini P. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). PTP opening in intact cells has been visualized using compounds that do not enter mitochondria unless the PTP is open. Two different approaches with calcein have been developed. In experimental conditions where cell loading with calcein acetoxymethyl ester does not load mitochondria, calcein fluorescence is compartmentalized outside mitochondria, and PTP opening is visualized by the distribution of calcein inside mitochondria (14Nieminen A.L. Saylor A.K. Tesfai S.A. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In experimental conditions where calcein acetoxymethyl ester also loads mitochondria, the fluorescence from cytosolic calcein is quenched by the addition of cobalt that distributes in cells but not in mitochondria. The calcein fluorescence is then compartmentalized within mitochondria until PTP opening permits the distribution of cobalt inside mitochondria, which results in the quenching of calcein fluorescence (15Petronilli V. Miotto G. Canton M. Brini M. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Whatever the technique, PTP opening thus leads to the decompartmentalization of calcein fluorescence. PTP opening in intact cells may or may not lead to mitochondrial depolarization depending on the PTP open time. Observations where calcein decompartmentalization occurred without mitochondrial depolarization indicate that PTP opening may be reversible in intact cells (16Petronilli V. Penzo D. Scorrano L. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12030-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Whether or not PTP opening leads to mitochondrial swelling in intact cells remains a matter of debate. Concomitant to PTP opening in intact cells, mitochondrial morphological changes interpreted as mitochondrial swelling (17Huser J. Blatter L.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 18Precht T.A. Phelps R.A. Linseman D.A. Butts B.D. Le S.S. Laessig T.A. Bouchard R.J. Heidenreich K.A.

Remington S.J. Youle R.J. Ichas F. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) have both been reported. Indirect evidence suggests that PTP opening in vivo leads to the release of mitochondrial NAD(P)+ (20Di Lisa F. Menabo R. Canton M. Barile M. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2571-2575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). However, mitochondrial NAD(P)H release following PTP opening has never been directly demonstrated in intact cells. Finally, it is not known whether PTP opening inhibits Complex 1 in intact cells, as it does in isolated mitochondria. In the present work, studying intact cells by time-lapse laser confocal microscopy, we report that both transient PTP opening (i.e. calcein decompartmentalization in the absence of mitochondrial depolarization) and permanent PTP opening (i.e. calcein decompartmentalization with mitochondrial depolarization) led to the appearance of NAD(P)H outside mitochondria and inhibited the respiratory chain but did not induce mitochondrial swelling. Cell Culture—Immortalized human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1), a generous gift of Dr. J. J. Feige (Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique, Grenoble, France), were maintained in MCDB 131 medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone. HMEC-1 cells were grown to confluence and maintained at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere (95% air, 5% CO2). Two days before the experiment, cells were harvested, seeded, and grown on glass coverslips in the medium described above. Hepatocytes were isolated according to the method of Berry and Friend (21Berry M.N. Friend D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (3628) Google Scholar), as modified by Groen et al. (22Groen A.K. Sips H.J. Vervoorn R.C. Tager J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were seeded on collagen type I-coated glass coverslips (5 μg/cm2) in a mixture containing 75% minimum essential medium and 25% medium 199, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10 μg/ml insulin. The medium was removed after 3 h and replaced by the same medium, with the exception that fetal bovine serum was omitted and bovine serum albumin concentration was increased to 1 mg/ml. Cell Loading—Cell loading was performed immediately before the experiment in the presence of 1 μm CsA or vehicle in MCDB 131 medium for HMEC-1 cells or in 75% minimum essential medium plus 25% medium 199 for hepatocytes. For calcein/cobalt staining, cells were exposed for 30 min to a medium supplemented with 8 mm CoCl2 and 0.25 μm calcein acetoxymethyl ester. For membrane potential determination, cells were loaded with 10 nm tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) for 30 min. For the determination of mitochondrial volume, cells were loaded with 50 nm MitoTracker Green for 20 min. After loading, cells were washed free of probes and further incubated in MCDB 131 medium for HMEC-1 cells or in 75% minimum essential medium plus 25% medium 199 for hepatocytes. Imaging—Cells on glass coverslips were studied by time-lapse laser confocal microscopy at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (95% air, 5% CO2) using a microscope equipped with a perfusion chamber (POC chamber, LaCon, Erbach, Germany) and an incubation system (O2-CO2-°C, PeCon, Erbach, Germany). Images were collected with a Leica TCS SP2 Acoustico Optical Beam Splitter (AOBS) inverted laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a Coherent 351–364 UV laser using a ×63 water immersion objective (HCX PL APO 63.0 × 1.20 water corrected). Laser excitation was 351–364 nm for NAD(P)H, 488 nm for calcein or MitoTracker Green, and 543 nm for TMRM. Fluorescence emission adjusted with AOBS was 390–486 nm for NAD(P)H, 506–541 nm for calcein, 565–645 nm for TMRM, and 501–542 nm for MitoTracker Green. Confocal pinhole (Airy units) was 1 for calcein and TMRM. Because NAD(P)H is less fluorescent, the pinhole aperture was increased to 2.62. The same aperture was used with MitoTracker Green to perform volume comparison. Image acquisition conditions were kept constant during each experiment. Each experiment was performed on a randomly chosen field containing 15–25 cells. The images of calcein and TMRM were not electronically manipulated. NADH autofluorescence images were improved by linear contrast enhancement followed by fine filter (Kernel 3 × 3) and deconvolution by calculated point spread function using the Volocity software. The MitoTracker Green images were improved using the ImageJ software as described in Ref. 23Koopman W.J. Distelmaier F. Esseling J.J. Smeitink J.A. Willems P.H. Methods (San Diego). 2008; 46: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar using a “top-hat” spatial filter. This filter is particularly suited to extract intense peaks upon background, depending on the criteria of size and shape. Therefore, this allows the removal of noise and a precise definition of the mitochondrial morphology. Image quantification was performed using the ImageJ and Volocity software for area, volume, and fluorescence intensity quantification. Because the fluorescence intensity depends on the number of cells, whereas the percentage of changes of fluorescence does not, the fluorescence was arbitrarily set at 100 at the beginning of each experiment. This was done to facilitate the comparison of changes in fluorescence between the different experiments. Oxygraphy—Hepatocyte oxygen consumption was measured polarographically at 37 °C using a Clark-type electrode. The incubation medium was a Krebs-Henseleit-bicarbonate buffer at pH 7.4 containing 1.4 mm Ca2+ and 10 mm lactate plus 1 mm pyruvate. Quantification of NADH—For the quantification of total hepatocyte NAD(P)H content, nucleotides were extracted as described in Ref. 24Devin A. Guerin B. Rigoulet M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar. For the quantification of mitochondrial NAD(P)H content, nucleotides were extracted using the digitonin fractionation method as described by in Ref. 25Zuurendonk P.F. Tischler M.E. Akerboom T.P. Van Der Meer R. Williamson J.R. Tager J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 207-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, except that the quenching phase under the oil was replaced by 2 m KOH. After extraction, NAD(P)H was immediately measured by fluorometry. Lactate/Pyruvate Ratio—Hepatocytes were incubated in 30-ml stopped plastic vials in a shaking water bath at 37 °C. The incubation medium (5 ml) was a Krebs-Henseleit-bicarbonate buffer in equilibrium with a gas phase containing O2/CO2 (95% O2 and 5% CO2), pH 7.4, supplemented with 1.4 mm Ca2+ and 20 mm dihydroxyacetone. When indicated, 700-μl samples of the cell suspension were taken, quenched in HClO4 (0.4 g/liter final concentration), and neutralized with 2 m KOH, 0.3 m MOPS. Lactate and pyruvate were measured enzymatically as described in Bergmeyer (26Bergmeyer H.U. Methods in Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie Weinheim Academic Press, Inc., New York, New York1974Google Scholar). Isolated Mitochondria—Rat liver mitochondria were prepared according to standard differential centrifugation procedures in a medium containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 0.1 mm EGTA-Tris. Mitochondrial volume changes (light scattering at 520 nm) and NAD(P)H fluorescence (excitation-emission, 340-460 nm) were measured simultaneously using a PTI Quantamaster C61 spectrofluorometer equipped with magnetic stirring and thermostatic controls. Reagents—Calcein acetoxymethyl ester, TMRM, and Mitotracker Green were from Molecular Probes, whereas all other chemicals were from Sigma. HMEC-1 cells coloaded with calcein plus cobalt displayed a fluorescence compatible with a mitochondrial calcein distribution (Fig. 1). Cells were exposed to the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 and, as expected (16Petronilli V. Penzo D. Scorrano L. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12030-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), a decompartmentalization of the calcein fluorescence occurred (Fig. 1, upper panel, left). No change in the pattern of calcein distribution was observed in the absence of Ca2+ ionophore (not shown). Note that the A23187-induced calcein decompartmentalization was partial in some cells (i.e. some mitochondria remained fluorescent). However, total or partial calcein decompartmentalization occurred in every cell, suggesting that this protocol led to PTP opening in every HMEC-1 cell but not in all mitochondria. In the presence of CsA, PTP opening requires more Ca2+ (27Detaille D. Guigas B. Chauvin C. Batandier C. Fontaine E. Wiernsperger N. Leverve X. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2179-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Because the Ca2+ load increases with time under our conditions, CsA is expected to retard PTP opening (16Petronilli V. Penzo D. Scorrano L. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12030-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the decompartmentalization of the calcein fluorescence was dramatically delayed when cells where incubated in the presence of CsA (Fig. 1, upper panel, right). NAD(P)H autofluorescence was measured in parallel in the same cells (Fig. 1, lower panels). As expected, NAD(P)H was mainly localized within mitochondria before A23187 addition (see also Figs. 2 and 3). Concomitant to calcein decompartmentalization, A23187 addition led to an increase in NAD(P)H autofluorescence in terms of both intensity and surface distribution. The effect of A23187 on NAD(P)H fluorescence was prevented by CsA (Fig. 1), and the same behavior was also observed in the absence of calcein plus cobalt (not shown). These data indicate that A23187-induced PTP opening affected the localization and fluorescence of NAD(P)H in HMEC-1 cells.FIGURE 3Double channel imaging of NAD(P)H autofluorescence and mitochondrial electrical membrane potential. HMEC-1 cells loaded with 10 nm TMRM in the absence or presence of 1 μm CsA were exposed to 0.05 μm A23187. The fluorescence of NAD(P)H (blue) and TMRM (red) was imaged simultaneously every 3 min. Bar, 44 μm. NAD(P)H fluorescence (quantified as in Fig. 1) increased from 100 (AU) at 0 min to 226 (AU) at 6 min in the absence of CsA, whereas it increased from 100 (AU) at 0 min to 114 (AU) at 6 min in the presence of CsA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether the increase in NAD(P)H fluorescence area was due to mitochondrial swelling, HMEC-1 cells loaded with MitoTracker Green were observed in three dimensions by confocal microscopy while being exposed to the same concentration of A23187. MitoTracker Green accumulates in polarized mitochondria, where it reacts with thiols to form aldehydefixable conjugates. Because most of the MitoTracker Green remains in mitochondria after depolarization (28Elmore S.P. Nishimura Y. Qian T. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 422: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), this is a suitable probe for analysis of mitochondrial morphology in conditions in which membrane potential may change. As shown in Fig. 2 (upper panels), although the mitochondrial network morphology changed with time (because of the physiological processes of fusion, fission, and movement), A23187-induced PTP opening did not affect MitoTracker Green volume (i.e. the entire mitochondrial volume). As expected, PTP opening led to an increase in the total NAD(P)H fluorescence in terms of both intensity and volume distribution (result not shown). However, the mitochondrial NAD(P)H autofluorescence remained almost unchanged (Fig. 2, middle panels), whereas the NAD(P)H autofluorescence outside mitochondria dramatically increased (Fig. 2, lower panels). To study the relationship between NAD(P)H localization and mitochondrial membrane potential, HMEC-1 cells loaded with TMRM were exposed to the same concentration of A23187. Although PTP opening affected NAD(P)H fluorescence in every cell, it decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in a subpopulation of cells only (Fig. 3, left panels). As expected, NAD(P)H and TMRM signals did not change when CsA prevented PTP opening (Fig. 3, right panels). These data indicate that our protocol induced PTP opening in every HMEC-1 cell. However, PTP opening was permanent only in cells in which membrane potential was collapsed, whereas it was transient in cells that maintained their membrane potential. Because membrane potential and NAD(P)H redox potential are known to be in thermodynamic equilibrium via Complex 1, one would expect that NAD(P)H fluorescence decreases with membrane potential, but this was not the case (Fig. 3, left panels). To clarify this issue, HMEC-1 cells loaded with TMRM were exposed to the uncoupler FCCP in control condition, in the presence of rotenone, or after A23187-induced PTP opening (Fig. 4). As expected, mitochondrial depolarization was followed by a dramatic decrease in NAD(P)H fluorescence in normal conditions (Fig. 4, upper panel), whereas NAD(P)H fluorescence did not change and remained compartmentalized after mitochondrial depolarization when Complex 1 was inhibited with rotenone (Fig. 4, middle panel). Interestingly, NAD(P)H fluorescence did not fall after either transient or permanent PTP opening and was not affected when membrane potential was collapsed by FCCP (Fig. 4, lower panel). These results indicate that membrane potential and NAD(P)H redox potential were no longer in thermodynamic equilibrium after PTP opening. NAD(P)H autofluorescence depends on the concentration and redox status of pyridine nucleotides as well as on the microenvironment (29Blinova K. Carroll S. Bose S. Smirnov A.V. Harvey J.J. Knutson J.R. Balaban R.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2585-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To test whether the increase in NAD(P)H fluorescence intensity was due to a change in NAD(P)H content, nucleotides were extracted from cells for subsequent quantification. Because this experiment required a large amount of cells, this experiment was performed on isolated hepatocytes. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, we first checked that A23187 induced an increase in NAD(P)H autofluorescence in hepatocytes. NAD(P)H extraction was then performed in parallel experiments. As shown in Fig. 5C, the NAD(P)H fluorescence spectrum measured 15 min after A23187 addition was dramatically higher than that after 1 min, whereas it remained constant over time in the absence of A23187 (not shown). This observation confirms that PTP opening increases NAD(P)H content in intact cells, as suggested by confocal imaging. To test whether such an increase in NAD(P)H content occurred in mitochondria, in cytosol, or in both compartments, NAD(P)H extraction was performed after cell fractionation. A23187 addition did not significantly affect mitochondrial NAD(P)H content (not shown), suggesting that PTP opening increases cytosolic NAD(P)H content. Because NAD(P)H can be either free or bound on proteins, we finally measured the lactate/pyruvate ratio, which is in equilibrium with the free cytosolic NADH. As shown in Fig. 5D, A23187 addition dramatically increased the lactate/pyruvate ratio, which remained unchanged in the control condition (not shown). As seen in Fig. 5B, NAD(P)H fluorescence increased, whereas TMRM fluorescence decreased after PTP opening in hepatocytes. Moreover, chemical uncoupling dramatically decreased TMRM fluorescence but slightly decreased NAD(P)H fluorescence, which remained higher than that observed before PTP opening. In other words, as seen in HMEC-1 cells, membrane potential and NAD(P)H redox potential were no longer in thermodynamic equilibrium after PTP opening in hepatocytes as well. Because this dissociation can be observed after respiratory chain inhibition, the oxygen consumption rate of hepatocytes was measured. In comparison with the control, A23187 led to a mild stimulation followed by a marked inhibition of oxygen consumption (Fig. 5E). To clarify how the increase in extramitochondrial NAD(P)H could be generated after PTP opening, we next measured the NAD(P)H fluorescence of isolated rat liver mitochondria during Ca2+-induced PTP opening. As previously shown, PTP opening in vitro led to mitochondrial swelling and NAD(P)H oxidation (Fig. 6A, trace a). Under those conditions of incubation, mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides are released outside mitochondria, which decreases the availability of NAD+ for matrix dehydrogenases. This sets a limit for NADH synthesis, which becomes lower than NADH consumption; as a consequence, NAD(P)H fluorescence decreases. As shown in Fig. 6A (trace b), the addition of NAD+ after PTP opening led to an increase in NAD(P)H fluorescence, which finally exceeded the NAD(P)H fluorescence observed before PTP opening. When PTP opening was triggered in the presence of NAD+, the drop in NAD(P)H fluorescence was restricted and transient (Fig. 6A, trace c), and the final NAD(P)H fluorescence was higher than before PTP opening had occurred. In parallel experiments, mitochondrial samples were withheld and immediately centrifuged to measure extramitochondrial NAD(P)H. As shown in Fig. 6B, extramitochondrial NAD(P)H concentration increased after PTP opening once NAD+ had been added. NAD(P)H did not appear outside mitochondria when NAD+ was added in the absence of PTP opening (data not shown). These data indicate that after PTP opening in the presence of NAD+, the following occurred: (i) NADH production exceeded NADH consumption, and (ii) the NADH produced by matrix dehydrogenase left mitochondria. In this work, we have shown that A23187-induced PTP opening was followed by (i) the appearance of NAD(P)H outside mitochondria in the absence of obvious mitochondrial swelling and (ii) the rupture of the thermodynamic equilibrium between NAD(P)H redox potential and membrane potential. The appearance of NAD(P)H outside mitochondria after PTP opening suggests that part of NAD(P)H has left mitochondria. This is consistent with its concentration gradient and in accordance with results obtained with isolated mitochondria. Alternatively, a number of electrons from mitochondrial NAD(P)H may have left mitochondria to reduce cytosolic NAD(P)+ via enzymatic reactions after contact between the cytosolic and the mitochondrial pools of pyridine nucleotides. These two mechanisms are non-mutually exclusive and, in both cases, PTP opening dramatically increases the cytosolic NAD(P)H content. After PTP opening in intact cells, not only does NAD(P)H appear outside mitochondria, but the total fluorescence of NAD(P)H dramatically increases (Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 5). The spectral quantification of cell extracts confirmed that NAD(P)H content increases after PTP opening (Fig. 5). Experiments performed with isolated mitochondria show that NADH is synthesized and exported outside mitochondria when PTP opening occurs in the presence of a physiological concentration (26Bergmeyer H.U. Methods in Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie Weinheim Academic Press, Inc., New York, New York1974Google Scholar) of NAD+ (Fig. 6). Under normal conditions, NAD(P)+-reducing and NAD(P)H-oxidizing processes are finely tuned. For example, the addition of rotenone (i.e. the inhibition of the main NADH-oxidizing pathway) slightly increases NADH matrix concentration, which in turn inhibits mitochondrial dehydrogenases that produce NADH. After PTP opening in intact cells, NADH oxidation decreased (because oxygen consumption decreased; Fig. 5), but this was not followed by an inhibition of the NAD(P)+-reducing pathways (because NAD(P)H content increased; Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 5). We hypothesize that this lack of inhibition was most probably because NADH did not accumulate in the matrix but either escaped from mitochondria or “exported” its reducing potential via the open PTP. The results in Fig. 6 support this hypothesis. The results in Figs. 3, 4, 5 show that NAD(P)H was not oxidized anymore in depolarized mitochondria after PTP opening, suggesting that PTP opening had inhibited the respiratory chain. This was confirmed by the direct measurement of the oxygen consumption rate in intact hepatocytes (Fig. 5E). In isolated mitochondria, PTP opening inhibits Complex 1 activity via two mechanisms. Firstly, PTP opening leads to the release of pyridine nucleotides, which decreases the availability of NADH for Complex 1 (7Fontaine E. Eriksson O. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12662-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Secondly, PTP opening partly decreases the rotenone-sensitive NADH decylubiquinone reductase activity (i.e. Complex 1 activity), possibly via a conformational change of Complex 1 (10Batandier C. Leverve X. Fontaine E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17197-17204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Note that PTP opening does not inhibit the other complexes of the respiratory chain in isolated mitochondria (10Batandier C. Leverve X. Fontaine E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17197-17204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In intact cells, an indirect inhibition of Complex 1 due to a decrease in NADH availability is not expected to occur because NAD(P)H content increased after PTP opening (Fig. 5C). Therefore, the inhibition of respiration observed in intact cells after PTP opening suggests that PTP opening inhibits Complex 1 in intact cells, as it does in isolated mitochondria. These findings led to the question as to whether transient PTP opening (i.e. calcein and NAD(P)H decompartmentalization in the absence of mitochondrial depolarization) corresponded to a continuous channel flickering or to one single reversible opening. Careful examination of the kinetic of NAD(P)H fluorescence indicates that the observed increase was a continuous process that reached a plateau 15–30 min after A23187 addition (not shown). Because this lengthy process is not compatible with one single reversible opening, this observation indirectly suggests that the transient PTP opening observed in this study corresponds to a continuous channel flickering. It must be emphasized that transient PTP opening had permanent consequences in intact cells. As shown in Fig. 4, the addition of FCCP did not decrease NAD(P)H fluorescence in cells where transient PTP openings had taken place, indicating that the respiratory chain was also inhibited in that condition. Therefore, the double channel imaging of NAD(P)H autofluorescence and mitochondrial electrical membrane potential before and after uncoupling represents a new technical approach to easily distinguish transient and permanent PTP opening on the same cell population. The inhibition of the respiratory chain in isolated mitochondria leads to mitochondrial depolarization unless mitochondria are incubated in the presence of ATP. In that particular condition, the uptake of ATP via the adenine nucleotide translocator and its hydrolysis via the F1F0-ATPase maintain the membrane potential. In intact cells, the inhibition of Complex 1 by rotenone did not abolish mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 4) unless ATPase was inhibited by oligomycin (data not shown). This indicates that, during the time course of our experiments, glycolysis provided enough ATP to sustain the mitochondrial membrane potential when Complex 1 was inhibited. Considering on one hand the cytosolic oncotic pressure in intact cells and the fact that PTP opening does not lead to mitochondrial swelling in the absence of oncotic pressure gradient on the other hand, PTP opening is not expected to lead to an immediate mitochondrial swelling in intact cells because there is no oncotic pressure gradient in that particular condition. This gradient increases secondarily when cytosolic proteins undergo degradation by proteolysis or are released through a leaky plasma membrane. In other words, PTP-dependent mitochondrial swelling (e.g. Ref. 30Friberg H. Ferrand-Drake M. Bengtsson F. Halestrap A.P. Wieloch T. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5151-5159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) should be regarded as a delayed consequence of PTP opening. Consistent with this view, the results in Figs. 1 and 2 indicate that the diffusion of cobalt inside mitochondria and the appearance of NAD(P)H outside mitochondria occurred without obvious mitochondrial swelling. This observation is in accordance with previous reports that suggest that PTP opening does not immediately induce a large mitochondrial swelling in intact cells (19De Giorgi F. Lartigue L. Bauer M.K. Schubert A. Grimm S. Hanson G.T. Remington S.J. Youle R.J. Ichas F. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). By analogy with what occurs in isolated mitochondria, it has initially been proposed that PTP opening in intact cells leads to the collapse of the proton-motive force, disruption of ionic homeostasis, mitochondrial swelling, and massive ATP hydrolysis by the ATPase. This first scenario was then supplemented by the observation that PTP opening in intact cells may not systematically lead to mitochondrial depolarization (16Petronilli V. Penzo D. Scorrano L. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12030-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) or mitochondrial swelling (19De Giorgi F. Lartigue L. Bauer M.K.

https://openalex.org/W2048682783,"The Alzheimer disease (AD) amyloid protein precursor (APP) can bind the FE65 adaptor protein and this complex can regulate gene expression. We carried out yeast two-hybrid studies with a PTB domain of FE65, focusing on those genes that might be involved in nuclear signaling, and identified and validated Teashirt proteins as FE65 interacting proteins in neurons. Using reporter systems, we observed that FE65 could simultaneously recruit SET, a component of the inhibitor of acetyl transferase, and Teashirt, which in turn recruited histone deacetylases, to produce a powerful gene-silencing complex. We screened stable cell lines with a macroarray focusing on AD-related genes and identified CASP4, encoding caspase-4, as a target of this silencing complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed a direct interaction of FE65 and Teashirt3 with the promoter region of CASP4. Expression studies in postmortem samples demonstrated decreasing expression of Teashirt and increasing expression of caspase-4 with progressive cognitive decline. Importantly, there were significant increases in caspase-4 expression associated with even the earliest neuritic plaque changes in AD. We evaluated a case-control cohort and observed evidence for a genetic association between the Teashirt genes TSHZ1 and TSHZ3 and AD, with the TSHZ3 SNP genotype correlating with expression of Teashirt3. The results were consistent with a model in which reduced expression of Teashirt3, mediated by genetic or other causes, increases caspase-4 expression, leading to progression of AD. Thus the cell biological, gene expression and genetic data support a role for Teashirt/caspase-4 in AD biology. As caspase-4 shows evidence of being a primate-specific gene, current models of AD and other neurodegenerative conditions may be incomplete because of the absence of this gene in the murine genome."

Accordingly, we tested the fluorinated analogue of glucosamine (4-fluoro-N-acetyl-glucosamine (4-F-GlcNAc)) on the synthesis of heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) by murine airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells in the presence of radiolabeled metabolic precursors. Secreted and cell-associated CS and HS were assessed for changes in size by Superose 6 chromatography. Treatment of ASM cells with 4-F-GlcNAc (100 microM) reduced the quantity (by 64.1-76.6%) and decreased the size of HS/CS glycosaminoglycans associated with the cell layer (K(av) shifted from 0.30 to 0.45). The quantity of CS secreted into the medium decreased by 65.7-73.0%, and the size showed a K(av) shift from 0.30 to 0.50. Treatment of ASM cells with 45 microM and 179 microM 4-F-GlcNAc in the presence of a stimulator of CS synthesis, 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-xyloside, reduced the amount of the xyloside-CS chains by 65.4 and 87.0%, respectively. The size of xyloside-CS chains synthesized in the presence of 4-F-GlcNAc were only slightly larger than those with xyloside treatment alone (K(av) of 0.55 compared with that of 0.6). The effects of 4-F-GlcNAc to inhibit CS synthesis were not observed with equimolar concentrations of glucosamine. We propose that 4-F-GlcNAc inhibits CS synthesis by inhibiting 4-epimerization of UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-GalNAc, thereby depleting one of the substrates required, whereas HS elongation is inhibited by truncation when the nonreducing terminus of the growing chain is capped with 4-F-GlcNAc."
https://openalex.org/W2064757152,"The Ste20-related protein proline/alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) plays important roles in cellular functions such as cell differentiation and regulation of chloride transport, but its roles in pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation remain largely unknown. Here we report significantly increased SPAK expression levels in hyperosmotic environments, such as mucosal biopsy samples from patients with Crohn's disease, as well as colon tissues of C57BL/6 mice and Caco2-BBE cells treated with hyperosmotic medium. NF-κB and Sp1-binding sites in the SPAK TATA-less promoter are essential for SPAK mRNA transcription. Hyperosmolarity increases the ability of NF-κB and Sp1 to bind to their binding sites. Knock-down of either NF-κB or Sp1 by siRNA reduces the hyperosmolarity-induced SPAK expression levels. Furthermore, expression of NF-κB, but not Sp1, was upregulated by hyperosmolarity in vivo and in vitro. Nuclear run-on assays showed that hyperosmolarity increases SPAK expression levels at the transcriptional level, without affecting SPAK mRNA stability. Knockdown of SPAK expression by siRNA or overexpression of SPAK in cells and transgenic mice shows that SPAK is involved in intestinal permeability in vitro and in vivo. Together, our data suggest that SPAK, the transcription of which is regulated by hyperosmolarity, plays an important role in epithelial barrier function."
https://openalex.org/W2126810236,"CorA is a constitutively expressed magnesium transporter in many bacteria. The crystal structures of Thermotoga maritima CorA provide an excellent structural framework for continuing studies. Here, the ligand binding properties of the conserved interhelical loop, the only portion of the protein exposed to the periplasmic space, are characterized by solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Through titration experiments performed on the isolated transmembrane domain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis CorA, it was found that two CorA substrates (Mg2+ and Co2+) and the CorA-specific inhibitor (Co(III) hexamine chloride) bind in the loop at the same binding site. This site includes the glutamic acid residue from the conserved ""MPEL"" motif. The relatively large dissociation constants indicate that such interactions are weak but not atypical for channels. The present data support the hypothesis that the negatively charged loop could act as an electrostatic ring, increasing local substrate concentrations before transport across the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2152483080,"In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the clpP1 chloroplast gene encoding one of the catalytic subunits of the ClpP protease complex contains a large in-frame insertion sequence (IS1). Based on the Escherichia coli ClpP structure, IS1 is predicted to protrude at the apical surface of the complex, likely influencing the interaction of the catalytic core with ClpC/HSP100 chaperones. Immunoblotting with an anti-ClpP1 antibody detected two immunoreactive forms of ClpP1: ClpP1(H) (59 kDa) and ClpP1(L) (25 kDa). It has been proposed that IS1 is a new type of protein intron (different from inteins). By studying transformants harboring mutations at the predicted borders of IS1 and tags at the C terminus of ClpP1 (tandem affinity purification tag, His tag, Strep.Tag) or within the IS1 sequence (3-hemagglutinin tag), we show that IS1 is not a protein intron and that ClpP1(L) results from endoproteolytic cleavage inside IS1. Processing sites have been identified in the middle of IS1 and near its C terminus. The sites can be mutated without abolishing processing."
https://openalex.org/W2159427943,"The C-module-binding factor (CbfA) is a multidomain protein that belongs to the family of jumonji-type (JmjC) transcription regulators. In the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, CbfA regulates gene expression during the unicellular growth phase and multicellular development. CbfA and a related D. discoideum CbfA-like protein, CbfB, share a paralogous domain arrangement that includes the JmjC domain, presumably a chromatin-remodeling activity, and two zinc finger-like (ZF) motifs. On the other hand, the CbfA and CbfB proteins have completely different carboxy-terminal domains, suggesting that the plasticity of such domains may have contributed to the adaptation of the CbfA-like transcription factors to the rapid genome evolution in the dictyostelid clade. To support this hypothesis we performed DNA microarray and real-time RT-PCR measurements and found that CbfA regulates at least 160 genes during the vegetative growth of D. discoideum cells. Functional annotation of these genes revealed that CbfA predominantly controls the expression of gene products involved in housekeeping functions, such as carbohydrate, purine nucleoside/nucleotide, and amino acid metabolism. The CbfA protein displays two different mechanisms of gene regulation. The expression of one set of CbfA-dependent genes requires at least the JmjC/ZF domain of the CbfA protein and thus may depend on chromatin modulation. Regulation of the larger group of genes, however, does not depend on the entire CbfA protein and requires only the carboxy-terminal domain of CbfA (CbfA-CTD). An AT-hook motif located in CbfA-CTD, which is known to mediate DNA binding to A+T-rich sequences in vitro, contributed to CbfA-CTD-dependent gene regulatory functions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2073235151,"The conformation of a surface loop, the lid, controls activity of pancreatic triglyceride lipase (PTL) by moving from a position that sterically hinders substrate access to the active site into a new conformation that opens and configures the active site. Movement of the lid is accompanied by a large change in steady state tryptophan fluorescence. Although a change in the microenvironment of Trp-253, a lid residue, could account for the increased fluorescence, the mechanism and tryptophan residues have not been identified. To identify the tryptophan residues responsible for the increased fluorescence and to gain insight into the mechanism of lid opening and the structure of PTL in aqueous solution, we examined the effects of mutating individual tryptophan residues to tyrosine, alanine, or phenylalanine on lipase activity and steady state fluorescence. Substitution of tryptophans 86, 107, 253, and 403 reduced activity against tributyrin with the largest effects caused by substituting Trp-86 and Trp-107. Trp-107 and Trp-253 fluorescence accounts for the increased fluorescence emissions of PTL that is stimulated by tetrahydrolipstatin and sodium taurodeoxycholate. The largest contribution is from Trp-107. Contrary to the prediction from the crystal structure of PTL, Trp-107 is likely exposed to solvent. Both tetrahydrolipstatin and sodium taurodeoxycholate are required to produce the increased fluorescence in PTL. Alone, neither is sufficient. Colipase does not significantly influence the conformational changes leading to increased emission fluorescence. Thus, Trp-107 and Trp-253 contribute to the change in steady state fluorescence that is triggered by mixed micelles of inhibitor and bile salt.

Furthermore, the results suggest that the conformation of PTL in solution differs significantly from the conformation in crystals. Lipases belong to a large gene family of proteins characterized by a common protein structure (1Holmquist M. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2000; 1: 209-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 2Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Susman J.L.

Included in this family are pancreatic triglyceride lipase (PTL, 2The abbreviations used are: PTL, pancreatic triglyceride lipase; NaTDC, sodium taurodeoxycholate; THL, tetrahydrolipstatin. triacylglycerol acylhydrolase, EC 3.1.1.3) and its close homologues pancreatic triglyceride lipase related proteins 1 and 2 (3Lowe M.E.

Not only do these pancreatic lipases have highly conserved primary structures, their x-ray crystal structures are essentially identical (4Roussel A. deCaro J. Bezzine S. Gastinel L. de Caro A.

Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Each contains two domains, a globular N-terminal domain consisting of an α/β hydrolase fold and a C-terminal domain consisting of a β-sandwich structure. A striking feature of these lipases and many others is the presence of a surface loop termed the lid domain. Together with the β5 loop and β9 loops of the N-terminal domain, the lid domain sterically hinders access of substrate to the active site. In this conformation, PTL cannot hydrolyze substrate, and the existence of another conformation was proposed (6Winkler F.K. D'Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a second, open conformation of PTL was identified in studies of the crystal structure of the PTL-colipase complex (7van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 8van Tilbeurgh H. Gargouri Y. Dezan C. Egloff M.P. Nesa M.P. Ruganie N. Sarda L. Verger R. Cambillau C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In these studies, the investigators obtained crystals of the complex in the presence and absence of detergent and phospholipid mixed micelles. Without micelles, the lid domain remained in the same closed position as observed in the PTL structure even though colipase clearly bound to the C-terminal domain (8van Tilbeurgh H. Gargouri Y. Dezan C. Egloff M.P. Nesa M.P. Ruganie N. Sarda L. Verger R. Cambillau C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). With micelles, the lid domain and the β5 loop adopted new conformations (7van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). A large hinge movement of the lid moved the domain away from the active site to form new interactions with colipase. The lid movement opened and configured the active site to generate a conformation compatible with catalysis. Additionally, the movement exposed a large hydrophobic surface on the PTL-colipase complex, a surface that likely contributes to the anchoring of the complex on the substrate interface. Although x-ray crystallography studies clearly demonstrated two conformations of PTL and other lipases, these only provide a static picture of what may be the beginning and end of the process. The mechanism that triggers lid opening and the presence of intermediate conformations remains speculative. Initially, many assumed that a lipid-water interface triggered the conformational change (9Verger R. Trends Biochem. Technol. 1997; 15: 32-38Scopus (726) Google Scholar). However, a number of studies using inhibitors, small angle neutron scattering, neutron diffraction, and monoclonal antibodies suggest that the lid can open in solution (10Hermoso J. Pignol D.

Acta. 1978; 530: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In these studies, it was variously suggested that bile salt micelles and colipase or bile salt micelles alone were sufficient to trigger lid opening. The presence of a lipid substrate was not required. None of these studies addressed the relative contribution of bile salts and colipase to the lid opening. A recent paper described the use of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy combined with site-directed spin labeling to monitor conformational changes in the PTL lid and to determine the effect of bile salts and colipase on lid opening (15Belle V. Fournel A. Woudstra M. Ranaldi S. Prieri F. Thome V. Currault J. Verger R. Guigliarelli B. Carriere F. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2205-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A cysteine was substituted for Asp-250 in the lid domain, and a paramagnetic probe was linked at that site. Using this method, the authors observed a mixture of closed and open conformations of the lid in the presence of bile salt micelles alone. Colipase by itself did not induce lid opening, but in the presence of bile salt micelles, colipase increased the relative concentration of PTL in the open conformation. Although the spin labeling did not have dramatic effects on the activity of the labeled PTL, it may not be benign. The presence of the probe may alter the kinetics of lid opening and may explain why a portion of PTL always stayed in the closed position. Another spectral method to follow conformation changes in proteins is fluorescence spectroscopy of native tryptophan. After systematically mutating the three tryptophans to alanine, investigators measured the binding of Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase and the mutants to mixed micelles of cis-parinaric acid and bile salt by fluorescence quenching and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (16Yapoudjian S. Ivanova M.G. Brzozowski A.M. Patkar S.A. Vind J. Svendsen A. Verger R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The measured values correlated with lid opening and depended on the presence of the single tryptophan in the lid. PTL shows a large increase in tryptophan fluorescence when incubated with a lipase inhibitor, tetrahydrolipstatin (THL), in the presence of bile salts (11Luthi-Peng Q. Winkler F.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It was suggested, but not demonstrated, that the fluorescence change reflected movement of the lid domain. Because PTL contains seven tryptophan residues including one in the lid, Trp-253, the interpretation of this study is quite complicated. Another study monitoring time-resolved fluorescence of PTL and several tryptophan mutants demonstrated that Trp-30 makes a significant contribution to the tryptophan fluorescence of PTL (17Ramos P. Coste T. Piemont E. Lessinger J.M. Bousquet J.A. Chapus C. Kerfelec B. Ferard G. Mely Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12488-12496Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The lid tryptophan, Trp-253, had a low quantum yield and contributed considerably less to the overall tryptophan fluorescence. This report did not include investigations of PTL fluorescence in the presence of bile salts or colipase. Consequently, the assumption that the large increase in steady state fluorescence of PTL in the presence of THL and bile salt results from changes in the environment of the lid domain tryptophan remains unproven. To determine whether the increased tryptophan fluorescence of PTL in THL and bile saIt represents a conformational change in PTL, we measured the effect of tryptophan substitution mutations on the activity and intrinsic steady state fluorescence of PTL. Each of the seven tryptophans was mutated to tyrosine. Selected tryptophans were mutated to alanine or phenylalanine. Each mutant PTL was expressed and purified. We monitored the effect of bile salts, colipase, THL, and mixtures of these compounds on the steady state fluorescence of PTL. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Manipulations of DNA were done by standard methods (18Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into the wild type PTL cDNA in the pHILS1 vector by polymerase chain reaction using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit as per the manufacturer's protocol (19Yang Y. Lowe M.E. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers were designed to introduce the desired mutations and were generally 27 bp long. Transformations into Epicurian Coli XL-1 Supercompetent cells were performed as described in the QuikChange protocol. Minipreps were performed using either the Qiagen plasmid mini kit or the Qiagen QIAprep miniprep kit. The presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequence analysis of the complete cDNA using the ABI PRISM Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit. The DNA was transformed into yeast by electroporation and positive clones selected as previously done (19Yang Y. Lowe M.E. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Cordle R.A. Lowe M.E. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Protein Methods—The mutant lipases were expressed and purified as previously described (19Yang Y. Lowe M.E. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis and by spectrophotometry at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of E1% = 1.2. The purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and staining with GELCODE Blue stain (Pierce) to confirm the homogeneity of the isolated protein. Standard Lipase Activity Measurements—The lipase activity of wild type and mutant PTL was determined in bulk by measuring the release of fatty acids from mechanically stirred emulsions of tributyrin, trioctanoin, or triolein as previously described (21Chahinian H. Bezzine S. Ferrato F. Ivanova M.G. Perez B. Lowe M.E. Carriere F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13725-13735Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Crandall W.V. Lowe M.E. J. Biol.

Unless otherwise stated, pure colipase from porcine pancreas or pure recombinant, human colipase was added at a molar excess of 5. The lipolytic activities are expressed in international units/milligram of enzyme. One unit corresponds to 1 μmol of fatty acid released per min. Inhibition by THL—For the incubations, 10 μg of PTL was added to 1 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 4% dimethyl sulfoxide for a concentration of 2 × 10–7 m. Five separate incubations were set up: 1) no other additions; 2) 10-fold molar excess of THL (Sigma); 3) 10-fold molar excess of THL and 10 μg of colipase; 4) 10-fold molar excess of THL and TDC to a final concentration of 4 mm; and 5) 10-fold molar excess of THL, TDC to a final concentration of 4 mm and 10 μg of colipase. Each mixture was incubated at room temperature. 100-μl aliquots were removed at time 0 and every 15 min for activity assays against tributyrin. For the samples that did not contain colipase, 1 μg of colipase was added to the assay. Inhibition was calculated as a percentage of the activity in the control sample (i.e. no other additions). The results were fitted to decay functions using SigmaPlot 10 (Systat Software, Inc). Steady State Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence measurements were performed at room temperature on a Fluoro-Max-2 (Jobin Yvon, Inc) spectrofluorimeter using a 1-cm quartz cell. The excitation and emission monochromators were set at 4-nm slit widths. Excitation was at 295 nm to selectively excite tryptophan residues. Emission was monitored between 305 and 400 nm. The average of five separate scans was analyzed. Quenching experiments with acrylamide were accomplished by adding 6-μl aliquots of an 8.4 m acrylamide stock to 3 ml of protein solution up to a final concentration of 0.41 m acrylamide. The fluorescence intensity changes were recorded at the maximum emission wavelength for the mutant PTL and corrected for dilution. The quenching curves were carried out after incubating PTL with THL for 6 h at room temperature. In preliminary experiments, longer incubation times did not alter the result. The Stern-Volmer plates were created with the simplified equation 23, 24) F0/F = 1 + KSV[Q], where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of the quencher, respectively; Q is the molar concentration of acrylamide; and KSV is the Stern-Volmer constant for collisional quenching. The data were fitted by linear regression using SigmaPlot 10. Statistical Analysis—Comparisons were done with the software package SigmaStat 3.5 (Systat Software, Inc.). Pairwise comparisons were done by t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant, and α was 0.05. All of the values are the means ± standard deviations. Functional Properties of the Tryptophan Mutants—To determine the contribution of each tryptophan residue to the steady state fluorescence of PTL, we mutated each individual tryptophan to tyrosine. This substitution was selected based on substitution preferences showing that tyrosine is a well tolerated naturally occurring substitution for tryptophan (25Bordo D. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 26Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Additionally, tyrosine has low absorption at 295 nm, and its emission signal is insignificant compared with that of tryptophan (28Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum, New York1999: 446-452Google Scholar). Wild type and tryptophan mutants of PTL were created and expressed in Pichia pastoris as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each of the proteins was efficiently secreted into the medium, indicating that protein folding was not dramatically altered. All were purified and purity assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). We next determined the activity of each mutant in the pH-stat assay (Table 1). Each assay included the test lipase, 0.11 m tributyrin in 4 mm sodium taurodeoxycholate with and without a 5-fold molar excess of recombinant human colipase. Neither PTL nor any of the mutants had activity in the absence of colipase. All were reactivated by colipase, indicating that they could bind colipase. Three of the mutants, W17Y, W30Y, and W339Y, had normal activities, indicating that none of these residues affects catalysis directly or indirectly. The remaining mutants had lower than normal activity ranging from 17 to 70% of PTL activity. The changes in activity are similar to those reported for W17F, W30F, W86F, W252F, and W402F PTL mutants (17Ramos P. Coste T. Piemont E. Lessinger J.M. Bousquet J.A. Chapus C. Kerfelec B. Ferard G. Mely Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12488-12496Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The colipase requirement and presence of activity indicate that the mutants are not grossly misfolded.TABLE 1Specific activity and steady state fluorescence measurements of PTL and the tryptophan mutantsLipaseSpecific activityλmaxRelative fluorescenceI330/I350units/mgnmPTL7,200 ± 250338 ± 11.00.81W17Y7,800 ± 130338 ± 11.39 ± 0.200.71W30Y7,400 ± 360326 ± 10.40 ± 0.061.12W86Y1,200 ± 80338 ± 11.4 ± 0.150.80W107Y1880 ± 65328 ± 10.82 ± 0.101.04W253Y5,100 ± 300339 ± 11.85 ± 0.300.75W339Y7,200 ± 250339 ± 10.60 ± 0.040.74W403Y3,900 ± 195339 ± 11.10 ± 0.200.75 Open table in a new tab Steady State Fluorescence—The maximum emission wavelength for PTL (λmax = 338 ± 1) corresponds well to previously reported values (11Luthi-Peng Q. Winkler F.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Ramos P. Coste T. Piemont E. Lessinger J.M. Bousquet J.A. Chapus C. Kerfelec B. Ferard G. Mely Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12488-12496Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Only the tyrosine substitutions of Trp-30 and Trp-107 shifted the maximum emission wavelength significantly (λmax = 328 ± 1). The blue shift suggests that Trp-30 and Trp-107 are exposed to solvent. This conclusion is supported by the change in the I330/I350 ratio. Tryptophan residues in proteins have a λmax = 330 when they are buried in nonpolar regions of the protein and a λmax = 350 when they are completely exposed to water (29Brustein E.A. Vedenkina N.S. Irkova M.N. Photochem. Photobiol. 1973; 18: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Higher I330/I350 ratios indicate a relatively hydrophobic environment for the tryptophan residues. PTL has an I330/I350 ratio of 0.81, whereas the ratio increases for both W30Y and W107Y, suggesting that they are in a relatively polar environment. The ratio decreases for all other mutants, except W86Y, consistent with a more hydrophobic environment for Trp-17, Trp-253, Trp-339, and Trp-403. The tyrosine substitutions also affected the relative fluorescence at maximum intensity for the mutants (Table 1). The largest effect was seen for the W30Y substitution, which showed a decrease in fluorescence consistent with the large contribution of Trp-30 to the quantum yield of PTL (17Ramos P. Coste T.

The largest increase in fluorescence was observed for W17Y, W86Y, and W253Y in agreement with the suggestion that these residues have weak fluorescence and act as acceptors in Trp-Trp homotransfer (17Ramos P. Coste T. Piemont E. Lessinger J.M. Bousquet J.A. Chapus C. Kerfelec B. Ferard G. Mely Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12488-12496Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We then examined the effect of NaTDC, THL, and colipase on the emission spectra of PTL and each of the tryptophan substitution mutants to identify the residues that contribute to the increased emission of PTL in the presence of those substances. As previously reported, the inclusion of bile salt and THL increased the emission intensity and red-shifted the λmax of PTL (11Luthi-Peng Q. Winkler F.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A 93 ± 7% increase in emission intensity at the peak and a 4-nm red shift was observed (Table 2 and Fig. 1). The spectral changes agree with the earlier study (11Luthi-Peng Q. Winkler F.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). W17Y, W86Y, W339Y, and W403Y had increases in emission intensity and a red shift similar to those seen for PTL (p > 0.05), indicating that these residues did not contribute significantly to the observed spectral changes. In contrast, substitution of Trp-30 led to a significant increase in peak emission intensity (p = 0.002), and substitutions of Trp-107 and Trp-253 caused a decrease in peak emission intensity (p = <0.001) (Table 2 and Fig. 2). Interestingly, the substitution of Trp-107 and not Trp-253 had the greatest effect on the change in peak emission intensity.TABLE 2Peak shift and change in maximum fluorescence intensity for PTL and the tryptophan mutants induced by NaTDC, THL, and colipaseLipasePeak shiftΔInm%PTL+493 ± 7W17Y+4100 ± 9W30Y+4128 ± 8W86Y+485 ± 9W107Y09 ± 1W253Y027 ± 8W339Y+488 ± 4W403Y+486 ± 7 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Fluorescence emission spectra of PTL mutants incubated with and without THL.

Because tyrosine to tryptophan resonance energy transfer can occur, any significant tyrosine fluorescence may affect overall protein fluorescence (30Edelhoch H. Brand L. Wilchek M. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 547-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 31Weber G. Biochem. J. 1960; 75: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Thus, we substituted alanine for the tryptophans of most interest, Trp-30, Trp-107, and Trp-253. Yeast transformed with W30A and W253A vectors expressed and secreted mutant lipase in good quantities. In contrast, yeast transformed with W107A did not secrete any detectable amounts of recombinant lipase (40 colonies were screened by immunoblot and lipase assay), suggesting that the substitution was not tolerated. We then created a phenylalanine substitution mutant for Trp-107. The W107F mutation was easily detectable in the media of transformed yeast. Each mutant was expressed and purified for further characterization. The activities of W30A and W253A were similar to those of the corresponding tyrosine mutants (Tables 1 and 3). W30A and W30Y had near normal activity, whereas W253A and W253Y had ∼65 to 70% of normal activity. W107F had higher activity than did W107Y, 60% versus 25% of the PTL activity. The peak fluorescence intensity of W30A and W107F relative to PTL were similar to the changes seen with W30Y and W107Y, whereas the peak fluorescence of W253A was nearly identical to that of PTL and lower than that of W253Y (p = 0.01) (Tables 1 and 3). As with the tyrosine substitution mutants, the W107F and W253A mutants did not have a red shift in peak intensity, nor did they show a large increase in peak intensity when incubated with NaTDC, THL (Tables 2 and 3). Interestingly, the W253A substitution had a decrease in peak fluorescence in the presence of NaTDC, THL, and colipase.TABLE 3Activity and change in maximum fluorescence intensity for PTL and the W30A, W107F, and W253A mutants induced by NaTDC, THL, and colipaseLipaseSpecific activityPeak shiftRelative fluorescenceΔIunits/mgnm%PTL7200 ± 120+41.090 ± 8W30A6348 ± 150+40.49 ± 0.09108 ± 10W107F4400 ± 8000.89 ± 0.1314 ± 1W253A4700 ± 1001.07 ± 0.06-17 ± 3 Open table in a new tab Fluorescence Quenching by Acrylamide—To determine whether there was a change in the accessibility of Trp-107 and Trp-253 in the presence and absence of NaTDC and THL, we performed quenching experiments with acrylamide, an uncharged polar molecule that can quench both solvent-exposed and buried tryptophan residues (Fig. 3). Each of the curves appeared linear when fit to the Stern-Volmer equation (R2 > 0.99 for each linear regression). The slope of the curves was similar for PTL and W253Y (4.4 and 4.1 m–1). In contrast, the slope of curve for W107Y was less steep (2.3 m–1). For each lipase, adding NaTDC decreased the slope, but the change was small (for PTL, 3.8 m–1; for W107Y, 2.1 m–1; and for W253Y, 3.8 m–1). The inclusion of THL with NaTDC increased the slope. In the case of PTL and W253Y, the slope approached that of the lipase alone (4.1 and 4.0 m–1, respectively). In the case of W107Y, a larger change was observed, and the slope increased above that of W107Y alone (2.6 m–1). Conformational Change of PTL—To determine the contributions of bile salt, colipase, and THL to the increase in emission intensity for PTL, we measured emission in the presence of each component singly and in combinations (Table 4). When added alone, each component increased peak emission fluorescence indicating the potential interactions. The addition of colipase had the smallest effect and only NaTDC caused a shift in the λmax of PTL, a red shift of 2 nm. Including NaTDC with colipase did not alter the spectra beyond the effects of NaTDC alone. Similarly, the PTL spectra in the presence of THL and colipase resembled that obtained in the presence of THL alone. Comparable changes were observed with W107Y and W253Y. Only when PTL was incubated with both NaTDC micelles and THL were the full spectral changes observed. The addition of colipase to this incubation caused no additional change in the peak shift or peak emission intensity.TABLE 4Change in maximum fluorescence intensity induced by colipase, NaTDC and THL for PTL, W107Y, and W253YAdditionΔIPTLW107YW253Y%Hcol7 ± 17 ± 29 ± 0.8NaTDC14 ± 912 ± 515 ± 6THL15 ± 88 ± 610 ± 3hcol, NaTDC16 ± 710 ± 412 ± 8hcol, THL12 ± 59 ± 219 ± 7NaTDC, THL88 ± 78 ± 322 ± 6hcol, NaTDC, THL93 ± 79 ± 427 ± 8 Open table in a new tab Inf"
