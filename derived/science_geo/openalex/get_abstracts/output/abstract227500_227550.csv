https://openalex.org/W1969072247,"Double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) serves as a danger signal associated with viral infection and leads to stimulation of innate immune cells. In contrast, the immunostimulatory potential of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) is poorly understood and innate immune receptors for ssRNA are unknown. We report that guanosine (G)- and uridine (U)-rich ssRNA oligonucleotides derived from human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) stimulate dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages to secrete interferon-alpha and proinflammatory, as well as regulatory, cytokines. By using Toll-like receptor (TLR)-deficient mice and genetic complementation, we show that murine TLR7 and human TLR8 mediate species-specific recognition of GU-rich ssRNA. These data suggest that ssRNA represents a physiological ligand for TLR7 and TLR8."

Using functional imaging, we assessed brain activity while volunteers experienced a painful stimulus and compared it to that elicited when they observed a signal indicating that their loved one--present in the same room--was receiving a similar pain stimulus. Bilateral anterior insula (AI), rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), brainstem, and cerebellum were activated when subjects received pain and also by a signal that a loved one experienced pain. AI and ACC activation correlated with individual empathy scores. Activity in the posterior insula/secondary somatosensory cortex, the sensorimotor cortex (SI/MI), and the caudal ACC was specific to receiving pain. Thus, a neural response in AI and rostral ACC, activated in common for ""self"" and ""other"" conditions, suggests that the neural substrate for empathic experience does not involve the entire ""pain matrix."" We conclude that only that part of the pain network associated with its affective qualities, but not its sensory qualities, mediates empathy."

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells produce vast amounts of IFN-α in response to the wild-type influenza virus. Here, we show that this requires endosomal recognition of influenza genomic RNA and signaling by means of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and MyD88. Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) molecules of nonviral origin also induce TLR7-dependent production of inflammatory cytokines. These results identify ssRNA as a ligand for TLR7 and suggest that cells of the innate immune system sense endosomal ssRNA to detect infection by RNA viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2124898423,"The Sir2 deacetylase modulates organismal life-span in various species. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Sir2 increases longevity are largely unknown. We show that in mammalian cells, the Sir2 homolog SIRT1 appears to control the cellular response to stress by regulating the FOXO family of Forkhead transcription factors, a family of proteins that function as sensors of the insulin signaling pathway and as regulators of organismal longevity. SIRT1 and the FOXO transcription factor FOXO3 formed a complex in cells in response to oxidative stress, and SIRT1 deacetylated FOXO3 in vitro and within cells. SIRT1 had a dual effect on FOXO3 function: SIRT1 increased FOXO3's ability to induce cell cycle arrest and resistance to oxidative stress but inhibited FOXO3's ability to induce cell death. Thus, one way in which members of the Sir2 family of proteins may increase organismal longevity is by tipping FOXO-dependent responses away from apoptosis and toward stress resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2135382170,"The experience of pain arises from both physiological and psychological factors, including one's beliefs and expectations. Thus, placebo treatments that have no intrinsic pharmacological effects may produce analgesia by altering expectations. However, controversy exists regarding whether placebos alter sensory pain transmission, pain affect, or simply produce compliance with the suggestions of investigators. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, we found that placebo analgesia was related to decreased brain activity in pain-sensitive brain regions, including the thalamus, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex, and was associated with increased activity during anticipation of pain in the prefrontal cortex, providing evidence that placebos alter the experience of pain."
https://openalex.org/W2123936150,"Dietary cholesterol consumption and intestinal cholesterol absorption contribute to plasma cholesterol levels, a risk factor for coronary heart disease. The molecular mechanism of sterol uptake from the lumen of the small intestine is poorly defined. We show that Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1(NPC1L1) protein plays a critical role in the absorption of intestinal cholesterol. NPC1L1 expression is enriched in the small intestine and is in the brush border membrane of enterocytes. Although otherwise phenotypically normal, NPC1L1-deficient mice exhibit a substantial reduction in absorbed cholesterol, which is unaffected by dietary supplementation of bile acids. Ezetimibe, a drug that inhibits cholesterol absorption, had no effect in NPC1L1 knockout mice, suggesting that NPC1L1 resides in an ezetimibe-sensitive pathway responsible for intestinal cholesterol absorption."
https://openalex.org/W2122574093,"Detailed organic analysis of natural aerosols from the Amazonian rain forest showed considerable quantities of previously unobserved polar organic compounds, which were identified as a mixture of two diastereoisomeric 2-methyltetrols: 2-methylthreitol and 2-methylerythritol. These polyols, which have the isoprene skeleton, can be explained by OH radical–initiated photooxidation of isoprene. They have low vapor pressure, allowing them to condense onto preexisting particles. It is estimated that photooxidation of isoprene results in an annual global production of about 2 teragrams of the polyols, a substantial fraction of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimate of between 8 and 40 teragrams per year of secondary organic aerosol from biogenic sources."
https://openalex.org/W2121492052,"The association between obesity and diabetes supports an endocrine role for the adipocyte in maintaining glucose homeostasis. Here we report that mice lacking the adipocyte hormone resistin exhibit low blood glucose levels after fasting, due to reduced hepatic glucose production. This is partly mediated by activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and decreased expression of gluconeogenic enzymes in the liver. The data thus support a physiological function for resistin in the maintenance of blood glucose during fasting. Remarkably, lack of resistin diminishes the increase in post-fast blood glucose normally associated with increased weight, suggesting a role for resistin in mediating hyperglycemia associated with obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2126955565,"Intention is central to the concept of voluntary action. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we compared conditions in which participants made self-paced actions and attended either to their intention to move or to the actual movement. When they attended to their intention rather than their movement, there was an enhancement of activity in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). We also found activations in the right dorsal prefrontal cortexand left intraparietal cortex. Prefrontal activity, but not parietal activity, was more strongly coupled with activity in the pre-SMA. We conclude that activity in the pre-SMA reflects the representation of intention."

https://openalex.org/W2049428247,"The transcription factor NF-κB (NF-κB) plays a pivotal role in regulating inflammatory gene expression. Its effects are optimized by various coactivators including histone acetyltransferases (HATs) such as CBP/p300 and p/CAF. Evidence shows that high glucose (HG) conditions mimicking diabetes can activate the transcription of NF-κB-regulated inflammatory genes. However, the underlying in vivo transcription and nuclear chromatin remodeling events are unknown. We therefore carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in monocytes to identify 1) chromatin factors bound to the promoters of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and related NF-κB-regulated genes under HG or diabetic conditions, 2) specific lysine (Lys (K)) residues on histone H3 (HH3) and HH4 acetylated in this process. HG treatment of THP-1 monocytes increased the transcriptional activity of NF-κB p65, which was augmented by CBP/p300 and p/CAF. ChIP assays showed that HG increased the recruitment of NF-κB p65, CPB, and p/CAF to the TNF-α and COX-2 promoters. Interestingly, ChIP assays also demonstrated concomitant acetylation of HH3 at Lys9 and Lys14, and HH4 at Lys5, Lys8, and Lys12 at the TNF-α and COX-2 promoters. Overexpression of histone deacetylase (HDAC) isoforms inhibited p65-mediated TNF-α transcription. In contrast, a HDAC inhibitor stimulated gene transcription and histone acetylation. Finally, we demonstrated increased HH3 acetylation at TNF-α and COX-2 promoters in human blood monocytes from type 1 and type 2 diabetic subjects relative to nondiabetic. These results show for the first time that diabetic conditions can increase in vivo recruitment of NF-κB and HATs, as well as histone acetylation at the promoters of inflammatory genes, leading to chromatin remodeling and transcription.

Certain key factors have been implicated in diabetes-induced accelerated atherosclerotic and inflammatory disease including hyperglycemia (1Ruderman N. Williamson J.R. Brownlee M.

Normalizing mitochondrial superoxide production could block three pathways induced by hyperglycemic damage (8Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y. Yorek M.A. Beebe D.

However, the specific molecular mechanisms and nuclear events involved in the transcription of pathological genes under diabetic conditions are not fully resolved. Circulating monocytes in diabetic individuals would be continuously exposed to hyperglycemic conditions. We recently showed that in vitro culture of monocytes under high glucose (HG) versus normal glucose (NG) conditions led to the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and significantly increased the expression of several inflammatory chemokines and cytokines (9Guha M. Bai W. Nadler J. Natarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17728-17739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 10Shanmugam N. Reddy M.A. Guha M. Natarajan R. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1256-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The potent inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), chemokine, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were among the factors induced (9Guha M. Bai W. Nadler J. Natarajan R. J.

Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1256-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these factors were transcriptionally regulated by HG with NF-κB being a major regulatory factor. In addition, the involvement of multiple upstream signaling pathways such as oxidant stress, protein kinase C, and mitogen-activated protein kinases were demonstrated (9Guha M. Bai W. Nadler J.

Recent studies, including our own, indicate that HG, AGEs, and the receptor of AGE ligand S100B can activate NF-κB in vitro in monocytes and lead to the expression of inflammatory genes such as TNF-α, MCP-1, interleukins, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (9Guha M.

Cell. 1999; 97: 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). NF-κB activity was also increased in monocytes from diabetic individuals (13Hoffman M.A. Schiekofer S. Kanitz M. Klevesath M.S. Josig M. Lee V. Morcos M. Tritschler H. Ziegler R. Wahl P. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P.P. Diabetes Care. 1998; 21: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the specific molecular in vivo transcription mechanisms and nuclear chromatin remodeling events underlying the regulation under diabetic conditions of these NF-κB-regulated inflammatory genes implicated in monocyte activation and dysfunction. NF-κB is an inducible transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in regulating the expression of more than 100 genes including TNF-α, MCP-1, and COX-2 (15Leonardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1998; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1259) Google Scholar, 16Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a heterodimer that usually consists of 65- and 50-kDa subunits (p65 and p50) complexed to its inhibitor, IκB-α, in the cytoplasm (15Leonardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1998; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1259) Google Scholar, 16Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). Upon cell stimulation by stimuli such as TNF-α, the IκB unit is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded, thereby allowing free NF-κB heterodimer to be transported to the nucleus and participate in gene regulation (16Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). p65 is a key transcriptionally active component of NF-κB. Our recent data shows that HG can increase nuclear p65 and decrease cytosolic IκB-α levels in monocytes (9Guha M. Bai W. Nadler J. Natarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17728-17739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The nuclear transactivation potential of NF-κB has been shown to require a number of different coactivators including CBP/p300, p/CAF, and SRC-1 (17Sheppard K.A. Rose D.W. Haque Z.A. Kurokawa R. Mcinerney E. Westin S. Thanos D. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) These cofactors have histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity and play key roles in the transcription machinery (18Cheung W.L. Briggs S.D. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 19Kurdistani S.K. Grunstein M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Histone acetylation has been shown to be associated with increased gene transcription (18Cheung W.L. Briggs S.D. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 19Kurdistani S.K. Grunstein M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). Acetylated histone proteins confer accessibility of the DNA template to the transcriptional machinery for gene expression. Histone deacetylases (HDACs), on the other hand, catalyze removal of acetyl groups on amino-terminal lysine residues and act as transcriptional repressors or silencers of genes (23de Ruijter A.J. van Gennip A.H. Caron H.N. Kemp S. van Kuilenburg A.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (2494) Google Scholar, 24Wade P.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The exchange of HATs for HDACs can mediate regulated gene expression. It is now clear that, apart from binding of transcription factors to their promoter DNA binding sites, transcriptional activation or repression is also linked to the recruitment of protein complexes that alter chromatin structure and architecture via enzymatic modifications of histone tails and/or nucleosome remodeling. Thus, although NF-κB and p65 seem to be involved in gene transcription under diabetic conditions, the specific in vivo regulation mechanisms at the level of chromatin are not known. In the present study, we hypothesized that diabetic conditions lead to chromatin remodeling and key alterations in the nuclear transcriptome that induce inflammatory gene transcription and enhanced monocyte activation. We have effectively used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to demonstrate for the first time the occurrence of chromatin rearrangements at the promoters of inflammatory genes in vivo in monocytes under diabetic conditions. We noted that HG culture of monocytes that mimics diabetic conditions could specifically increase the recruitment of coactivator HATs such as CBP and p/CAF to the promoters of inflammatory genes and leading to the acetylation of nucleosomal factors histone H3 (HH3) and HH4 while also decreasing the association of HDACs. There was concomitant recruitment of NF-κB p65 to the promoters of key HG-induced NF-κB-dependent genes such as TNF-α and COX-2. Additionally, we demonstrated in vivo relevance by examining histone acetylation patterns in monocytes from diabetic patients. Our results reveal for the first time that in vivo chromatin remodeling occurs under diabetic conditions in cell culture and in patients.

Samples were balanced for total DNA content with control plasmid. Cells were then washed and cultured for 24 h in complete medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and either NG or HG. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed as described previously (10Shanmugam N. Reddy M.A. Guha M. Natarajan R.

ChIP Assays—These were performed according to Boyd and Farnham (25Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 30-60 min, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and sonicated one to three times for 30 s each at 40% maximum setting of the sonicator (Branson Sonifier, model 250) followed by centrifugation for 10 min. One-tenth of the total lysate was used for total genomic DNA as “Input DNA” control. Supernatants were collected and diluted in buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) followed by immunoclearing with 1 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, 10 μl of rabbit IgG, and 20 μl of protein-A-Sepharose (Upstate Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed for 15 h at 4 °C with 2-5 μg each of specific antibodies. Precipitates were washed sequentially for 10 min each in TSE I buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), TSE II (TSE I with 500 mm NaCl), and buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Precipitates were then washed twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA) and extracted twice with 1% SDS containing 0.1 m NaHCO3. Eluates were pooled and heated at 65 °C for at least 6 h to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. DNA fragments were purified with Qiagen Qiaquick spin kit. For PCR, 1 μl from a 50-μl DNA extraction was used.

Isolation of Human Peripheral Blood Monocytes (PBMC)—50-60 ml of blood from adult volunteers with established type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and from normal healthy donors, was collected in the presence of anti-coagulant in accordance with an approved Institutional Review Board protocol. Monocytes were isolated from the blood according to our reported procedure (12Shanmugam N. Kim Y.S. Lanting L. Natarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34834-34844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). ChIP assays were then performed with antibodies to acetylated H3K9 and H3K14 as described earlier. p65-dependent Transcription from the TNF-α Promoter Is Augmented by CBP and p/CAF and Further Enhanced by HG—Evidence shows that NF-κB p65 can interact with CBP and its structural homolog p300, and also p/CAF (17Sheppard K.A. Rose D.W. Haque Z.A. Kurokawa R. Mcinerney E. Westin S. Thanos D. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Jenuwein T. Allis C.D.

Cell. 2002; 9: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), to stimulate NF-κB-dependent transactivation and gene expression. There is also evidence that the HAT activity of p/CAF, but not that of CPB, is required to coactivate p65-dependent transcription (17Sheppard K.A. Rose D.W. Haque Z.A. Kurokawa R. Mcinerney E. Westin S. Thanos D. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since HG can augment the expression of NF-κB-dependent genes such as TNF-α, we first examined whether HG can affect CBP/p300-, p/CAF-, and p65-mediated transcriptional activation of the TNF-α promoter. We transfected THP-1 cells with a minimal hTNF-α promoter (295TNF-αLuc) with or without expression vectors for p65, CBP, p300 or p/CAF for 16 h and then cultured the cells under NG (5.5 mm) or HG (25 mm) conditions for 24 h. Luciferase activities in Fig. 1A show that TNF-α transcription is dependent on p65. Furthermore, Fig. 1B shows that this is increased under HG conditions (second bar set). Furthermore, CBP, p300, and p/CAF could each clearly enhance p65-mediated increase in TNF promoter activity under NG conditions and these are slightly, but not significantly, stimulated by HG versus NG conditions (third, fourth, and fifth bar sets). Interestingly, the transcriptional activities of p65 (second bar set) as well as coactivator effects of CBP, p300, or p/CAF (sixth, seventh, and eighth bar sets) are clearly enhanced under HG conditions. These results suggest for the first time that HG may enhance coactivator HAT recruitment. They also further support earlier observations that HG can significantly increase the expression of key inflammatory genes via NF-κB activation. ChIP Assays to Evaluate p65 Binding to the Promoters of Inflammatory Genes—The ChIP assay is a powerful technique to determine true in vivo binding of transcription factors and other nucleosomal proteins to chromatin in response to an agonist (25Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 27Orlando V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 99-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). We used this assay to determine the status of the NF-κB transcription complex at the promoters of key NF-κB-regulated genes in THP-1 cells in response to HG. Specifically we evaluated the recruitment of NF-κB p65 and p50 subunits and the HAT coactivators, CBP and p/CAF, using antibodies specific for each of these factors. After the ChIP protocol, gene promoter regions were amplified and analyzed by semiquantitative PCRs using specific primer pairs around NF-κB binding regions on the promoters of TNFα, MCP-1, COX-2, and IL-6. All of these genes are known to be regulated at least in part by NF-κB. THP-1 cells cultured for 3 days in NG or HG were subjected to ChIP first with an antibody (Ab) to p65. Enrichment of specific DNA sequences in the chromatin immunoprecipitates, which indicates association of these ligand factors to DNA strands within intact chromatin, were visualized by PCR amplification. PCR was designed to amplify a 486-bp region of the hTNF-α promoter (-453 to +33) (24 bp from either end used as primers), which contains key κB binding elements. An increase in the relative amount of amplified TNF-α promoter-specific PCR product indicates binding. Fig. 2A clearly shows selective increased occupancy by p65 on the TNFα promoter by 48-h HG treatment (over 5-fold). Very little or no binding is seen in NG. Important controls demonstrate the specificity of HG effects, since there is no amplified band in the absence of Ab (lane 1), with mannitol (MANN, band similar to NG), with primers that amplify GAPDH promoter, or to an open reading frame exoncoding region on TNF-α gene (EXON). Control amplification is with total input DNA (Input DNA) (lower panel of Fig. 2A). There is no change in the amplification of input DNA in all the cases. In addition, we also examined the promoters of other NF-κB target genes that are regulated by HG, namely MCP-1, COX-2, and IL-6. p65 is again similarly recruited in vivo to these gene promoters in response to HG (Fig. 2B). Time Course of HG-induced in Vivo Recruitment of Chromatin Remodeling Factors to the TNF-α and COX-2 Promoters—Evidence shows that HG treatment of THP-1 cells can increase p65 levels in the nuclei (9Guha M. Bai W. Nadler J. Natarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17728-17739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NF-κB-dependent gene expression in other cells is enhanced by association of p65 with CBP and p/CAF (17Sheppard K.A. Rose D.W. Haque Z.A. Kurokawa R. Mcinerney E. Westin S. Thanos D. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this has not been observed in an in vivo context or in response to HG. We therefore did a time course of HG treatment of THP-1 cells and performed ChIPs with antibodies to p65, CBP, p/CAF, and acetyl-HH3 (Ab recognizing histones acetylated at Lys9 and Lys14) followed by PCR analyses with primers amplifying the TNF or COX-2 promoter regions containing NF-kB binding sites. Fig. 3A with the TNF-α promoter shows several interesting new results: 1) p65 recruitment to the TNF-α promoter occurs as early as 16 h after HG treatment and falls off only after 72 h; 2) HG clearly increases the recruitment of CBP at a similar time frame as p65; 3) HG also increases the recruitment of p/CAF and this appears sustained even at 72 h; 4) these events also coincide with the acetylation of HH3. The lowest panel shows that input DNA is not altered by HG. These results indicate for the first time that HG can induce histone acetylation in the TNF-α gene locus in vivo and provides novel evidence that a close relationship exists between TNF-α gene activation by HG and acetylated histone accumulation. We also conducted ChIP assays to evaluate changes at the human COX-2 promoter, which is also regulated by NF-κB (12Shanmugam N. Kim Y.S. Lanting L. Natarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34834-34844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 28Appleby S.B. Ristimaki A. Nielson K. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Fig. 3B shows the time course (16-24 h) of HG effects and indicates that CBP, p/CAF, and p65 are recruited in a temporal sequence to the COX-2 promoter similar to TNF-α promoter. p50 is also recruited with similar kinetics. The intriguing new result is that, while the transcriptional repressor HDAC1 is associated to the COX-2 promoter under basal NG conditions (lane 1), however, with increasing time of HG treatment, the levels of bound HDAC1 steadily decreased while bound CBP levels increased. Interestingly, HDAC1 is reported to appear in complexes containing various corepressors like Sin3 and Mi-2-NuRD complex (23de Ruijter A.J. van Gennip A.H. Caron H.N. Kemp S. van Kuilenburg A.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (2494) Google Scholar) and hence can mediate gene repression. These new results suggest that HG conditions can elicit dynamic alterations in HDAC to HAT activities, in vivo recruitment of transcription factors and coactivators, and histone acetylation at inflammatory gene loci in vivo, culminating in increased gene expression. Evidence shows that TNF-α can auto regulate its own gene expression. Fig. 3C shows that TNF-α increases p65 and CBP recruitment and also the acetylation of HH3 at the TNF-α promoter similar to the actions of HG. Furthermore, TNF-α effects are augmented under HG conditions. Identification of Specific Lysines Acetylated on HH3 and HH4 —Emerging data indicates the importance of specific patterns of histone acetylation at lysine residues for the final outcome of gene expression versus silencing. We therefore wanted to determine which specific lysines of HH3 and HH4 are acetylated at the TNF-α promoter in response to HG. For these, we performed ChIP assays with specific Abs to HH3 acetylated at lysine (Lys (K)) 9 or Lys14 or Abs to HH4 acetylated at Lys5, Lys8, Lys12, or Lys16 (key histone modifications involved in gene transcription). Fig. 4A shows that HG leads to a time-dependent increase in the acetylation of Lys9 and Lys14 on HH3 at the TNF promoter region, with Lys9 effects being more intense. Furthermore, it appears that, temporally, these events occur parallel to p65, CBP, and p/CAF recruitment. This is supporte"

This is the first structure of a mycobacterial outer-membrane protein. No structure-related protein was found in the Protein Data Bank.

https://openalex.org/W2007835300,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are sensors for the detection of invading infectious agents and can initiate innate immune responses. Because the innate immune system induces an appropriate defense against different pathogens, different TLR signaling domains may have unique properties that are responsible for eliciting distinctive responses to different types of pathogens. To test this hypothesis, we created ligand-regulated TLR chimeric receptors composed of the extracellular region of TLR4 and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of other TLRs and expressed these chimeras in macrophages lacking endogenous TLR4. Interestingly, the chimeras between TLR4 and either TLR3, TLR7, or TLR9 were localized completely intracellularly whereas other chimeras were expressed on the cell surface. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a ligand for these chimeras, induced the activation of nuclear factor κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases and the subsequent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages expressing TLR4, TLR4/TLR5, or TLR4/TLR8 chimeras but not in macrophages expressing TLR4/TLR1, TLR4/TLR2, or TLR4/TLR6 chimeras. Co-expression of unresponsive chimeras in some combinations (chimeras with TLR1+TLR2 or TLR2+TLR6 but not TLR1+TLR6) resulted in LPS responsiveness, indicating functional complementarity. Furthermore, the pair of TLR2+TLR6 chimera required approximately 10-fold less LPS to induce the same responses compared with the TLR1+TLR2 pair. Finally, LPS induced effective interferon-β production and subsequent Stat1 phosphorylation in macrophages expressing full-length TLR4 but not other cell surface TLR chimeras. These results suggest that the functions of TLRs are diversified not only in their extracellular regions for ligand recognition but also in their transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions for subcellular localization and signaling properties.

Vertebrates have developed innate and adaptive immune systems to combat infections by bacteria, fungi, and viruses (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Google Scholar). The innate immune system is a first line of the defense against invading agents. It contains elements conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates, and includes receptors recognizing molecular structures highly conserved among pathogens, referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns. In vertebrates, the innate immune system also has a critical role in triggering the activation of adaptive immune responses by promoting presentation of antigens and up-regulation of various cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules (2Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 380-383Google Scholar). Toll-like receptors (TLRs), 1The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; TIR, Toll/interleukin-1 receptor homology; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IFN, interferon; PE, phycoerythrin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; HPRT, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase; IL, interleukin; RT, reverse transcription; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. mammalian homologs of the Drosophila receptor Toll, are an integral part of the innate immune system (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Google Scholar, 3Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Google Scholar). To date, 10 different human and 9 different mouse TLRs have been identified. All TLRs are type I transmembrane proteins composed of an N-terminal extracellular domain with leucine-rich repeats involved in ligand recognition, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain largely made up of a TIR (Toll/IL-1 receptor homology) domain required for downstream signaling. Previous experiments with TLR knockout mice and dominant negative mutants of TLRs have demonstrated that TLRs recognize a wide variety of molecules associated with pathogens, such as bacterial cell wall components and pathogen nucleic acids (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Google Scholar, 3Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Google Scholar). Because important aspects of infection such as replication and dissemination are distinctive for different types of pathogens, it would seem that optimal innate immune responses to different pathogens would include elements especially appropriate for the type of pathogen. For example, the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and inducible nitricoxide synthase (iNOS) are important for the elimination of bacterial infections. In contrast, type I IFNs are more critical for the elimination of many viral infections. Because these immune responses are mediated by TLRs in innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, we hypothesized that different TLRs may have different properties which allow innate immune cells to tailor their responses to individual pathogens by producing specific patterns of cytokines and inflammatory mediators. Comparing the signaling capabilities of endogenous TLRs is not entirely straightforward as these receptors are not all expressed on the cell surface (4Zarember K.A. Godowski P.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 554-561Google Scholar, 5Hornung V. Rothenfusser S. Britsch S. Krug A. Jahrsdorfer B. Giese T. Endres S. Hartmann G. J.

For these reasons, the functional properties of altered forms of TLRs, such as chimeric molecules with constitutively active signaling properties, have been examined. Although those chimera systems such as CD4-TLR (9Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Schroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 171-176Google Scholar) have been informative, the noninducible nature of those chimeric TLRs makes a number of issues, such as the kinetic aspects of signaling, hard to address. In addition, most TLR chimera experiments have been carried out in nonimmune cells, such as 293T or Chinese hamster ovary cells, rather than innate immune cells and have involved high levels of expression. Thus we wanted to develop a ligand-regulated TLR chimera system that improved upon these aspects of previous TLR chimera systems, and examined the diversity of TLRs originating from the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of TLRs. Here we describe studies with a system in which ligand-regulated TLR chimeras were expressed at near physiological levels in primary macrophages. These studies demonstrated the functional diversity of TLR transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains for intracellular localization and signaling properties. Reagents, Mice, and Cell Culture—Highly purified LPS from Salmonella minnesota R595 (Re) and peptidoglycan from Staphylococcus aureus were purchased from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA) and Sigma, respectively. Recombinant mouse interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Antibodies to unmodified forms of IκBα, ERK1/2, JNK1, p38, and Stat1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to phosphorylated IκBα, ERK1/2, JNK1/2, p38, and Stat1 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-mouse IFN-β monoclonal antibody (clone 7F-D3, a rat IgG1) was purchased from Seikagaku America (Falmouth, MA). GolgiPlug reagent was purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). C57BL/10ScN and C57BL/10ScSn mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred in our colony. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were prepared from 8-10-week-old mice, plated onto non-tissue culture-treated plates (Becton Dickinson Lab Ware, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 25 mm Hepes and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, and 15% CMG 12-14 cell conditioned medium as a source of CSF-1 (13Takeshita S. Kaji K. Kudo A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1477-1488Google Scholar). Macrophages at day 4 or 5 after isolation from the bone marrow were used for retroviral infection. cDNAs and Plasmids—cDNAs for murine TLR4, TLR6, and TLR9 were kindly provided by Drs. B. Beutler (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA), A. Aderem (Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA), and S. Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan), respectively. Murine TLR1 and TLR2 were isolated by screening of a mouse spleen cDNA library with EST cDNA clones as probes. Murine TLR3 and TLR7 were amplified by PCR from the mouse spleen cDNA library. Murine TLR5 and TLR8 were amplified by PCR from mouse liver cDNA and IFN-γ-treated RAW 264.7 macrophage cDNA, respectively. TLR chimeras were constructed by fusing cDNA encoding the extracellular domain of murine TLR4 (amino acids 22-625) to the cDNAs encoding the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of murine TLR1 (amino acids 581-795), TLR2 (amino acids 586-784), TLR3 (amino acids 698-905), TLR5 (amino acids 631-859), TLR6 (amino acids 594-806), TLR7 (amino acids 835-1050), TLR8 (amino acids 814-1032), and TLR9 (amino acids 811-1032). In all cases, the junctions were made at the highly conserved last cysteine of the juxtamembrane cysteine-rich domain. All TLR chimeras had the preprotrypsin signal sequence followed by a FLAG-tag sequence followed by the amino terminus of the extracellular domain of TLR4. A TLR4 modified in this way has been shown to respond normally to LPS (14Poltorak A. Smirnova I. He X. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. McNally O. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Du X. Thompson P. Chan E.K. Ledesma J. Roe B. Clifton S. Vogel S.N. Beutler B. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1998; 24: 340-355Google Scholar). The TLR chimeras were cloned into the pMX-pie bicistronic retroviral vector, which encodes the gene of interest followed by an internal ribosomal entry site element and the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene (15Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329Google Scholar). GFP fluorescence is therefore an indication of infection efficiency and expression level of the gene of interest. TIR domain-deleted TLR4 mutant (TLR4TIRDL or 4DL, amino acids 22-664) was amplified by PCR and was cloned into pMX-pie. Viral Production and Infection—The TLR chimeras were transduced into bone marrow-derived macrophages by retroviral gene transfer. Briefly, TLR chimera-encoding retroviruses were produced by triple transfection of HEK293T cells with retroviral constructs along with gag-pol and vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein expression constructs (16Yee J.K. Friedmann T. Burns J.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 99-112Google Scholar). Viral supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection and added to macrophages. Cells and viruses were then centrifuged at 2,400 rpm for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation for 6 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air. Then, viral supernatants were replaced with culture media. After 48 h, the infection efficiency was assessed by measuring GFP fluorescence with a FACScan, and the cells were used for experiments. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cells were released from adherence by chelation of divalent cations with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA, incubated with Fc Block (anti-mouse CD16/CD32 antibody, BD Pharmingen), and then stained with phycoerythrin (PE)conjugated monoclonal anti-mouse TLR4/MD2 antibody (clone MTS510, eBioscience, San Diego, CA) or isotype control (PE-conjugated anti-rat IgG2a, eBioscience). After washes, stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan and CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). For intracellular staining, the cells were preincubated with Fc Block, fixed, and then permeabilized with the Cytofix/Cytoperm reagent (BD Pharmingen) before staining with antibodies. Quantitation of Cytokines and Nitrite in Culture Medium—One day before stimulation, 2 × 105 cells/well in 0.5 ml of culture medium were plated in 24-well plates. After stimulation, the concentration of TNF, IL-6, and IL-12 p40 in cell culture medium was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the instructions from the manufacturer (BD Pharmingen). Production of nitrite was measured by using the Griess reagent as described previously (17Arima T. Kitamura Y. Nishiya T. Takagi H. Nomura Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 212: 1-4Google Scholar). For the intracellular TNF staining, cells were stained with PE-conjugated anti-mouse TNF-α monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen) after cells were treated with Fc Block, fixed, and permeabilized as described above. Western Blot Analysis—One day before stimulation, cells were plated at 8.75 × 105/6-cm dish. 3 h before stimulation, the medium was exchanged with 4 ml of low growth factor medium (1% fetal calf serum, 1.5% CMG 12-14 cell supernatant) to decrease the basal cellular activity. After stimulation, cells were harvested and resuspended in 150 μl of ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) and sonicated for 7 s (Sonifier cell disruptor 200, Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT). After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm (= 20,000 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C, supernatants were collected, and the protein concentrations were measured with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit. Equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and blotted with indicated antibodies. PCR with Reverse Transcription (RT-PCR)—Cells were seeded, and given a 3-h rest in low growth factor medium as described above. After stimulation, total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Two μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 20 μl. Two μl of this reaction was used as a template for PCR amplification with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for 24, 27, and 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 40 s (IFN-β) or 30 s (hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT)). Primers for IFN-β and HPRT were described by Alexopoulou et al. (18Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Google Scholar). Ligand-regulated Chimeric Toll-like Receptors—To investigate the signaling properties and biological functions of different TLRs in a ligand-dependent manner, we established a new system in which chimeric receptors were composed of the extracellular region of TLR4 fused with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic region of other TLRs and expressed in primary macrophages lacking endogenous TLR4 (Fig. 1A). In this way, the activity of chimeric receptors could be regulated by a TLR4 ligand, LPS. Retroviral vectors were used to introduce these chimeras into bone marrow-derived macrophages derived from C57BL/10ScN mice, which carry a null mutation in the TLR4 gene (19Qureshi S.T. Lariviere L. Leveque G. Clermont S. Moore K.J. Gros P. Malo D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 615-625Google Scholar, 20Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C.

Res. 2000; 6: 51-56Google Scholar). These macrophages are unresponsive to optimal concentrations of a highly purified preparation of rough LPS, and introduction of full-length TLR4 cDNA into these macrophages restored LPS responsiveness (Fig. 1B). The cell surface level of TLR4 produced by retrovirus-mediated expression was estimated to be approximately 2-3-fold elevated compared with endogenous TLR4 in bone marrow macrophages derived from wild-type mice (C57BL/10ScSn) (Fig. 1C). In addition, TNF production levels in response to LPS were almost the same between wild-type macrophages and TLR4-reconstituted C57BL/10ScN macrophages (Fig. 1D), suggesting that this experimental system is highly physiological. Approximately 35% of these primary macrophages expressed the chimeric receptors in each case, as judged by expression of GFP, which was also encoded in the retrovirus (data not shown). Different Subcellular Distributions of the TLR Chimeras in Macrophages—We first examined whether TLR chimeras were expressed on the plasma membrane by flow cytometry using an anti-TLR4/MD2 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the extracellular region of TLR4 associated with MD2, an accessory molecule required for cell surface expression and LPS responsiveness of TLR4 (22Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 667-672Google Scholar). Interestingly, only some TLR chimeras were expressed on the cell surface. In intact cells, TLR4/TLR1, TLR4/TLR2, TLR4, TLR4/TLR5, TLR4/TLR6, and, to a lesser extent, TLR4/TLR8 chimeras were detected on the cell surface (Fig. 2). In contrast, the TLR4/TLR3, TLR4/TLR7, and TLR4/TLR9 chimeras were not detected on the cell surface. These chimeras, however, were readily detected when cells were fixed and permeabilized before staining (Fig. 2). Identical results were obtained in 3T3 fibroblasts (data not shown). These results were confirmed by fluorescence microscopy (data not shown). We also observed that the TLR4/TLR9 chimera was strongly co-localized with hemagglutinin-tagged wild type TLR9 in intracellular compartments, 2T. Nishiya and A. L. DeFranco, unpublished data. suggesting that TLR chimeras were localized in macrophages similarly to wild type TLRs. Cytoplasmic Domains of Individual TLRs Exhibit Distinct Signaling Properties—This ligand-regulated chimeric receptor system allowed us to compare the ability of the different chimeras to trigger signaling cascades involved in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We examined the ability of TLR chimeras to activate NF-κB, ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 MAPK, because all these molecules are activated by TLR ligands, and are also involved in the induction of inflammatory responses (23Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Science. 2003; 300: 1524-1525Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, the phosphorylation and degradation of IκΒα were detected in macrophages expressing TLR4, TLR4/TLR5, and, with slower kinetics, TLR4/TLR8 chimeras, whereas these events were not detected in macrophages expressing TLR4/TLR1, TLR4/TLR2, or TLR4/TLR6 chimeras. Similarly, phosphorylated ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 were detected in macrophages expressing TLR4 and the TLR4/TLR5 chimera. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38, but not JNK1/2, were also detected in macrophages expressing the TLR4/TLR8 chimera, with slower but prolonged activation. In contrast, activation of these signaling events was undetectable in macrophages expressing TLR4/TLR1, TLR4/TLR2, or TLR4/TLR6 chimeras, with the exception of a weakly phosphorylated ERK1/2 in macrophages expressing the TLR4/TLR2 chimera, and of a phosphorylated p38 with slow kinetics in macrophages expressing the TLR4/TLR6 chimera when cells were stimulated with a high dose of LPS (100 ng/ml) (Fig. 3B). LPS-induced Homo-multimerization of the Cytoplasmic Domains of TLR4, TLR5, and TLR8, but Not TLR1, TLR2, and TLR6, Can Mediate Inflammatory Responses—One of the most important functions of TLRs is to induce early inflammatory responses by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, we next examined whether the cytoplasmic domains of individual TLRs can mediate inflammatory responses. Nitrite accumulation, which reflects the expression of the iNOS gene, was detected in a ligand-dependent manner in macrophages expressing TLR4 or the TLR4/TLR5 chimera (Fig. 4). Nitrite production in response to TLR4 or TLR4/TLR5 stimulation was significantly enhanced in the presence of IFN-γ as expected, because iNOS induction is known to be regulated by both TLR and IFN signaling (24Bogdan C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 907-916Google Scholar). Macrophages expressing the TLR4/TLR8 chimera made less nitrite, but a small amount was detected in response to LPS plus IFN-γ. Similar results were seen for production of TNF, IL-6, and IL-12, except no significant enhancement was seen in the presence of IFN-γ. Inflammatory responses mediated by TLR4/TLR5 and TLR4/TLR8 chimeras required approximately 10 and 100 times more LPS compared with the amount of LPS needed to induce a comparable response in macrophages expressing TLR4. These differences could be because of the cell surface levels of each chimeras as the TLR4/TLR8 chimera was expressed at 10-20 times lower levels than TLR4 and the TLR4/TLR5 chimera was expressed at approximately 4 times lower levels (Table I).Table ICell surface level of TLR chimeras in bone marrow-derived macrophages at 48 h after infectionVirusesCell surface levels of TLR4/MD2MFITLR4/TLR1376 ± 44TLR4/TLR2366 ± 28TLR4484 ± 56TLR4/TLR5124 ± 8TLR4/TLR6473 ± 54TLR4/TLR826 ± 2TLR4TIRDL548 ± 32Vector18 ± 1 Open table in a new tab In contrast, macrophages expressing TLR4/TLR1, TLR4/TLR2, or TLR4/TLR6 chimeras did not induce any inflammatory responses tested. TNF was normally induced in the transduced macrophages expressing different chimeras by the TLR2 ligand, peptidoglycan and the TLR9 ligand, CpG-DNA (data not shown), suggesting that signaling components involved in the induction of inflammatory responses were intact in all macrophages. Production or lack of production of inflammatory mediators correlated with the ability of the chimeras to activate signaling molecules. The macrophages expressing TLR chimeras that were seen only intracellularly failed to respond to LPS even at high concentration (100 ng/ml) (data not shown). Complementary Signaling Functions of Some TLR Chimeras—Aderem's group has suggested that TLR2 may function as a hetero-multimer with TLR1 or TLR6 (9Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Schroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Google Scholar), and the response to some bacterial lipoproteins has been shown to be lost in macrophages lacking either TLR2 or TLR6 (7Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Muhlradt P.F. Morr M. Radolf J.D. Zychlinsky A. Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 933-940Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the combination of two of the unresponsive TLR chimeras, TLR4/TLR1, TLR4/TLR2, and TLR4/TLR6, could trigger activation of intracellular signaling events. In these experiments, macrophages were infected with two different retroviruses to express two different TLR chimeras. Efficiency of dual infections and cell surface levels of TLR chimeras were almost the same between the different combinations tested (Table II). In agreement with the evidence that TLR2 and TLR6 can function together to promote responses to bacterial lipopeptides, the combination of TLR4/TLR2 plus TLR4/TLR6 induced activation of all signaling molecules tested (Fig. 5). Similar but smaller activity was detected in the combination of TLR4/TLR1 plus TLR4/TLR2, whereas TLR4/TLR1 plus TLR4/TLR6 showed a minimal ability to activate those signaling molecules.Table IIThe efficiency of dual infection and cell surface level of TLR chimeras in bone marrow-derived macrophagesVirusesGFP + cellsCell surface levels of TLR4/MD2%MFITLR4/TLR1 + TLR4/TLR235.4 ± 3.5430 ± 30TLR4/TLR2 + TLR4/TLR638.4 ± 2.5466 ± 16TLR4/TLR1 + TLR4/TLR635.7 ± 2.6495 ± 33 Open table in a new tab Consistent with their relative abilities to promote activation of signaling pathways, the combination of TLR4/TLR2 plus TLR4/TLR6 showed much higher production of pro-inflammatory cytokines than the combination of TLR4/TLR1 plus TLR4/TLR2, and no cytokine production was seen upon addition of LPS to cells expressing TLR4/TLR1 plus TLR4/TLR6 (Fig. 6). Effective Antiviral Response by IFN-β Production Is Restricted to TLR4 Signaling—It has recently been suggested that TLR signaling also mediates antiviral innate immune responses by directing production of type I IFNs, especially IFN-β (25Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Google Scholar, 26Re F. Strominger J.L. J. Biol.

To investigate which TLR cytoplasmic domains can mediate type I IFN production, we conducted RT-PCR to detect IFN-β mRNA in macrophages expressing cell surface TLR chimeras. As shown in Fig. 7A, IFN-β mRNA was strongly induced by LPS in macrophages expressing TLR4, but not in cells expressing TLR4/TLR1, TLR4/TLR2, or TLR4/TLR6 chimeras. Low levels of IFN-β mRNA were detected in LPS-stimulated macrophages expressing TLR4/TLR5 and TLR4/TLR8 chimeras. These inductions were detected after 24 cycles of PCR reaction and did not saturate even at 30 cycles (data not shown). The phosphorylation of tyrosine 701 on Stat1, a critical event for the induction of antiviral responses by IFN-β and its receptor, was next examined. Macrophages expressing TLR4 showed robust tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 at 2 h after LPS stimulation (Fig. 7B). This response was inhibited by anti-IFN-β antibody, indicating that it was caused by IFN-β production. In contrast, no significant Stat1 phosphorylation was observed in macrophages expressing other TLR chimeras even at 4 h after stimulation. We then investigated whether combinations of unresponsive TLR chimeras could induce IFN-β. As shown in Fig. 7C, IFN-β mRNA was detected at low levels in macrophages expressing TLR4/TLR1 plus TLR4/TLR2 or TLR4/TLR2 plus TLR4/TLR6 at 30 cycles of PCR reaction, but was not detected at 24 or 27 cycles (data not shown). Even this low level of IFN-β mRNA was not detected in macrophages expressing TLR4/TLR1 plus TLR4/TLR6. In addition, no significant phosphorylation of Stat1 was observed in macrophages expressing these combinations of TLR chimeras (Fig. 7D). The failure of TLR4/TLR1+TLR4/TLR2 or TLR4/TLR2+TLR4/TLR6 to make nitrites (Fig. 6) supports the previous observation that LPS-induced iNOS is IFN-β-dependent (25Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.Y. Thomas K. Cody M"
https://openalex.org/W2049255037,"Despite much progress in understanding how extrinsic signaling regulates stem cell self-renewal, little is known about how cell-autonomous gene regulation controls this process. In Drosophila ovaries, germline stem cells (GSCs) divide asymmetrically to produce daughter GSCs and cystoblasts, the latter of which develop into germline cysts. Here, we show that removing the translational repressor Nanos from either GSCs or their precursors, the primordial germ cells (PGCs), causes both cell types to differentiate into germline cysts. Thus, Nanos is essential for both establishing and maintaining GSCs by preventing their precocious entry into oogenesis. These functions are likely achieved by repressing the translation of differentiation factors in PGCs and GSCs."

However, our study indicates subtle differences between the binding of these two compounds. Importantly, the observation that some mutations that have no effect on calcimimetics recognition but which affect the binding of calcilytics in TM3 and TM5, suggests that the binding pocket of positive and negative allosteric modulators is partially overlapping but not identical.

Cloning the extracellular Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR) 1The abbreviations used are: CaSR, calcium-sensing receptor; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; PTH, parathyroid hormone; TM, transmembrane domain; mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; IP, inositol phosphates; WT, wild-type. from bovine parathyroid has shed light on the molecular mechanisms implicated in the regulation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion (1Brown E.M.

The role of CaSR in calcitonin secretion in the thyroid and ion maintenance in the kidney has also been investigated and its presence has been detected in various tissues such as the intestine, the lung, as well as in bone (2Brown E.M. MacLeod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Google Scholar) where it has been proposed as a molecular target for the actions of strontium ranelate, a candidate drug for the treatment of female osteoporosis (3Coulombe J.

Kifor O. Vassilev P.M. Nishimura R. Brown E.M. Glia. 1998; 24: 449-458Google Scholar) and its presence on nerve terminals suggest additional roles for this receptor (7Ruat M. Molliver M.E.

The CaSR belongs to family 3 of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by a long bilobed amino-terminal tail proposed to contain the ligand binding sites. This family includes metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), γ-aminobutyric acid, taste, and putative pheromone receptors (9Pin J.P. Galvez T. Prezeau L. Ther. Pharmacol. 2003; 98: 325-354Google Scholar, 10Jingami H. Nakanishi S. Morikawa K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 271-278Google Scholar). Positive allosteric modulators of the CaSR, also called calcimimetics, have been characterized (11Ferry S. Chatel B. Dodd R.H. Lair C. Gully D. Maffrand J.P. Ruat M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

One of these, NPS R-568, a phenylalkylamine (Fig. 1), has been proposed to selectively activate the parathyroid CaSR resulting in an inhibition of PTH secretion both in vitro and in vivo (15Nemeth E.F. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 2077-2087Google Scholar). The therapeutic potential of NPS R-568 and its derivatives has been demonstrated in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism as well as in patients exhibiting secondary hyperparathyroidism linked to renal disease. NPS R-568 has been shown to interact with residues located in the extracellular region delimited by the seven transmembrane domains (TMs) (16Hammerland L.G. Krapcho K.J. Garrett J.E. Alasti N.

This compound, also called a calcilytic, inhibits the biological effects elicited by Ca2+ or by a calcimimetic acting on the CaSR but does not affect the responses elicited by the activation of several other GPCRs. When applied to bovine parathyroid cells in culture, NPS 2143 stimulated the secretion of PTH (20Nemeth E.F. Delmar E.G. Heaton W.L. Miller M.A. Lambert L.D. Conklin R.L. Gowen M. Gleason J.G. Bhatnagar P.K. Fox J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 323-331Google Scholar). After in vivo injection of this molecule, a rapid and sustained increase of plasma PTH was observed in the rat, and long term treatment of ovariectomized rats, an animal model of osteoporosis, was followed by a large increase in bone turnover (20Nemeth E.F. Delmar E.G. Heaton W.L. Miller M.A. Lambert L.D. Conklin R.L. Gowen M. Gleason J.G. Bhatnagar P.K. Fox J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 323-331Google Scholar, 21Gowen M. Stroup G.B. Dodds R.A.

These data suggest that NPS 2143, and calcilytics in general, might be useful for regulating the plasma PTH level, thereby representing an interesting pharmacological target for drug development. The identification and characterization of calcimimetics and calcilytics as well as their associated molecular mechanisms of action are therefore important goals. In this report, we have identified the binding site(s) of NPS 2143 in the human CaSR using a three-dimensional model of this receptor based on the x-ray structure of bovine rhodopsin (22Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Google Scholar) that we have recently reported (23Petrel C. Kessler A. Maslah F. Dauban P. Dodd R.H. Rognan D. Ruat M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49487-49494Google Scholar). Comparison of the ligand binding pocket of both NPS 2143 and Calhex 231 (Fig. 1), a structurally different negative allosteric modulator of the CaSR that we have recently characterized (23Petrel C. Kessler A. Maslah F. Dauban P. Dodd R.H. Rognan D. Ruat M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49487-49494Google Scholar), led us to demonstrate that these two calcilytics interact with overlapping binding sites in the TMs. Moreover, we report the calcimimetic properties of (R)-2-[1-(1-naphthyl)ethylaminomethyl]-1H-indole (Calindol) (Fig. 1), which also belongs to a novel structurally different series of calcimimetics (24Faure H. Ruat M. Kessler A. Dauban P. Dodd R.H. Osteoporos. Int. 2002; 1: S29Google Scholar). We have, furthermore, examined if the amino acids involved in the recognition of the calcilytics Calhex 231 and NPS 2143 are also implicated in the binding of the calcimimetics Calindol and NPS R-568. Our data suggest that calcilytics and calcimimetics interact with several identical residues only within the sixth and seventh TMs. These studies further validate our CaSR model based on the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin and provide a rational framework for the development of more selective and potent allosteric modulators of the CaSR. Preparation of Calindol—Calindol was prepared as its hydrochloride salt. Briefly, indole-2-carboxylic acid in chloroform was treated for 16 h at room temperature with excess thionyl chloride in the presence of catalytic N,N-dimethylformamide. The reaction of the resulting acid chloride with (R)-(+)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine and triethylamine afforded (R)-[1-(1-naphthyl)ethyl]-1H-indole-2-carboxamide. Reduction of the latter with lithium aluminum hydride-aluminum chloride in refluxing tetrahydrofuran for 24 h gave (R)-2-[1-(1-naphthyl)ethylaminomethyl]-1H-indole, i.e. Calindol. Details of the synthesis and structural characterization of Calindol will be published elsewhere. NPS 2143, N-[(R)-2-hydroxy-3-(2-cyano-3-chlorophenoxy)propyl]-1,1-dimethyl-2-(2-naphthyl)ethylamine, was prepared as described (25Doggrell S.A. Del Fresno M. Castaner J. Drugs Future. 2002; 27: 140-142Google Scholar). NPS R-568, (R)-N-(3-methoxy-α-phenylethyl)-3-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-propylamine, was synthesized as its hydrochloride salt as described (5Ferry S. Traiffort E. Stinnakre J. Ruat M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 872-884Google Scholar). Plasmids—The human wild-type (WT) CaSR cDNA (provided by Prof. M. Freichel), and the mutant CaSRs T764A, H766A, F684A, F688A, L776A, W818A, F821A, I841A, E837A, have been reported (23Petrel C. Kessler A. Maslah F. Dauban P. Dodd R.H. Rognan D. Ruat M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49487-49494Google Scholar). R680A mutant was prepared as the other CaSR mutants previously described (23Petrel C. Kessler A. Maslah F. Dauban P. Dodd R.H. Rognan D. Ruat M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49487-49494Google Scholar), using the appropriate oligonucleotides (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) to convert arginine to alanine (sequences of oligonucleotides are available on request). Sequencing of the resulting mutated DNA was performed as described (23Petrel C. Kessler A. Maslah F. Dauban P. Dodd R.H. Rognan D. Ruat M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49487-49494Google Scholar). EC50 of R680A for Ca2+ (3.4 ± 0.1 mm, mean ± S.E., n = 2) was determined by measuring accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates ([3H]IP) by increasing concentrations of Ca2+ after transient expression of the R680A mutant in HEK293 cells (see below). Expression of the CaSR mutant R680A was investigated by Western blot analysis using the 141Ab antiserum directed against the human CaSR as described (23Petrel C. Kessler A. Maslah F. Dauban P. Dodd R.H. Rognan D. Ruat M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49487-49494Google Scholar) and was comparable with the expression of the WT CaSR (data not shown). Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293 cells (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and were transiently transfected by electroporation (270 volts, 975 microfarads) using a gene pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad). Briefly, 4 μg of pCDNA3 plasmid containing WT or mutated human CaSR DNA were supplemented with 6 μg of pRK5 plasmid and were used to transfect 107 cells in a total volume of 300 μl of electroporation buffer (K2HPO4, 50 mm; CH3COOK, 20 mm; KOH, 20 mm; MgSO4, 26.6 mm; pH 7.4). After electroporation, cells were resuspended in culture medium and distributed on a 24-well plate coated with 100 μg/ml rat tail collagen (BD Biosciences) for [3H]IP analysis. [3H]IP Formation—Cells were labeled by 0.5 μCi/well of myo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 h in their growth medium and measurement of [3H]IP accumulation was performed as described (26Ruat M. Snowman A.M. Hester L.D. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5972-5975Google Scholar). The activities of WT and mutant CaSRs were determined in response to NPS 2143 or Calhex 231 in the presence of 10 mm Ca2+. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate determinations and are representative of one of three to 10 independent experiments. IC50 values for NPS 2143 and Calhex 231 were calculated using GraphPad prism 2.01 (GraphPad Prism Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Graphs of concentration dependence for the [3H]IP response were obtained by increasing the concentration of Ca2+ with or without 1 μm Calindol or NPS R-568 and were constructed for the WT and mutant receptors using GraphPad prism 2.01 software. The effect of the R680A mutant was determined in the presence of 1 μm NPS R-568 or Calindol at 3.4 mm Ca2+ concentration corresponding to its EC50. Significance was assayed by the Excel 98 Student's t test (Microsoft, Seattle, WA). Each value on a curve is the mean of duplicate determinations normalized to the maximal activation of each receptor obtained at 10 mm Ca2+. The graphs presented correspond to two to five independent experiments. Automated Docking of NPS 2143—The Surflex docking program (27Jain A.N. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 499-511Google Scholar) was used to automatically dock NPS 2143 to the previously described three-dimensional model of the CaSR (23Petrel C. Kessler A. Maslah F. Dauban P. Dodd R.H. Rognan D. Ruat M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49487-49494Google Scholar). An idealized active site ligand or protomol (28Ruppert J. Welch W. Jain A.N. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 524-533Google Scholar) was first generated from 33 consensus positions (29Bissantz C. Bernard P. Hibert M. Rognan D. Proteins. 2003; 50: 5-25Google Scholar) supposed to map the TM cavity of most GPCRs. This protomol consists of the preferred locations of various molecular probes (CH4,C = O, N-H) that are then used by the docking engine to search for the best three-dimensional morphological similarity between the protomol and the ligand to dock. A proto_thresh value of 0.5 and a proto_bloat value of 0 were used to generate a compact protomol. A TRIPOS mol2file (TRIPOS Associates Inc., St. Louis, MO) of the antagonist, obtained from a two-dimensional sketch as previously reported (29Bissantz C. Bernard P. Hibert M. Rognan D. Proteins. 2003; 50: 5-25Google Scholar) was docked into the TM cavity using standard parameters of Surflex used in the “whole” docking approach (27Jain A.N. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 499-511Google Scholar). The best 30 solutions were finally stored in mol2 format. Hypothesized Binding Mode of NPS 2143—We have recently developed a model of the human CaSR based on the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin that has allowed us to delineate the putative TMs of the CaSR (Ref. 23Petrel C. Kessler A. Maslah F. Dauban P. Dodd R.H. Rognan D. Ruat M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49487-49494Google Scholar and Fig. 2). We then used this model to dock the novel calcilytic Calhex 231 (Fig. 1) into a hydrophobic cavity centered on Glu-837 and formed by two pockets (23Petrel C. Kessler A. Maslah F. Dauban P. Dodd R.H. Rognan D. Ruat M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49487-49494Google Scholar). This observation prompted us to use the same model to analyze the potential sites of interaction of NPS 2143, a structurally different calcilytic (Fig. 1). Automated docking of NPS 2143 using the recently described Surflex docking engine (27Jain A.N. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 499-511Google Scholar) disclosed a preferred binding mode (Fig. 3, A and B) in which both the amine and the hydroxyl functions are H-bonded to Glu-837. The close proximity of the protonated secondary amine to the negatively charged Glu-837 side chain indicates a likely ionic interaction between both moieties. An additional H-bond between the Arg-680 side chain and the ether oxygen of NPS 2143 contributes to anchoring the calcilytic in the binding cavity. It should be noted that the guanidine moiety of Arg-680 does not directly interact with the hydroxyl group of NPS 2143, although a water-mediated H-bond would be topologically possible. Furthermore, the naphthalene moiety of the calcilytic is embedded in pocket A and interacts with neighboring hydrophobic side chains (Pro-682, Phe-688, Val-689, Tyr-744, Pro-748, Leu-776, Trp-818, and Phe-821), whereas the disubstituted phenyl ring is buried in the additional pocket B (Phe-612, Ala-615, Leu-616, Phe-668, Ile-669, Arg-680, Phe-684, Val-838, and Ile-841). The gem-dimethyl group directly faces the Phe-684 aromatic ring. The proposed interaction model suggests a tight binding of NPS 2143 because 68% of the overall surface of the antagonist (457 of 667 Å2) is buried upon binding to the TM cavity.Fig. 3Proposed models of the human CaSR complexed with NPS 2143 and Calhex 231. A, proposed interaction model between NPS 2143 and the CaSR binding cavity. TM helices are displayed as yellow ribbons. NPS 2143 as well as important CaSR heavy atoms are indicated by sticks using the following color coding: carbon atom of NPS 2143, orange; carbon atom of the CaSR, white; oxygen atom, red; nitrogen atom, blue; chloride atom, green. Important side chain positions of the CaSR are labeled at the Cα atom. Intermolecular hydrogen bonds between CaSR and NPS 2143 are represented by dotted yellow lines. Mutations discussed herein are displayed by green labels. B, comparison of NPS 2143 and Calhex 231 binding pockets. Carbon atoms of Calhex 231 are displayed in cyan. Whereas the substituted phenyl side chain of NPS 2143 and Calhex 231 largely occupy pocket B in a similar manner, the naphthalene moiety of both molecules markedly differ in their orientation in pocket A, facing Phe-688 located in TM3 for NPS 2143 and facing Trp-818 and Phe-F821 in TM6 for Calhex 231.

Incubation of these cells with NPS 2143 caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the IP response to 10 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 4, A and B). Analysis of the dose-response curve led to an IC50 for NPS 2143 of 0.35 ± 0.08 μm (mean ± S.E., n = 10), which is comparable with that of Calhex 231 (IC50 = 0.39 ± 0.08 μm, Table I) for the inhibition of IP response elicited by Ca2+ under similar experimental conditions.Table ISummary of the effects of various CaSR mutations on the properties of NPS 2143 and Calhex 231ReceptorPositionIC50 ± S.E.Calhex 231NPS 2143μmWT0.39 ± 0.080.35 ± 0.08R680ATM30.12 ± 0.02ap < 0.01 with the WT receptor.4.1 ± 0.8ap < 0.01 with the WT receptor.F684ATM3>10−5>10−5F688ATM33.20 ± 0.98bp < 0.001 with the WT receptor.>10−5T764AECL20.28 ± 0.050.44 ± 0.06H766AECL20.64 ± 0.030.54 ± 0.14L776ATM50.07 ± 0.03ap < 0.01 with the WT receptor.0.37 ± 0.06W818ATM63.30 ± 0.50bp < 0.001 with the WT receptor.0.65 ± 0.09F821ATM60.06 ± 0.01ap < 0.01 with the WT receptor.0.57 ± 0.14E837ATM7>10−5>10−5I841ATM72.71 ± 0.10bp < 0.001 with the WT receptor.4.17 ± 0.52bp < 0.001 with the WT receptor.a p < 0.01 with the WT receptor.b p < 0.001 with the WT receptor. Open table in a new tab We then examined the ability of NPS 2143 to block the Ca2+-induced [3H]IP accumulation in HEK293 cells expressing the mutant CaSRs previously used by us for identifying the Calhex 231 binding site, as well as to that harboring the R680A mutation that we have now characterized (see “Materials and Methods”). We have previously shown by Western blot analysis using 141Ab antiserum directed against the human CaSR, that the expression pattern of WT and the CaSR mutants transfected in HEK293 cells was comparable (see “Materials and Methods” and Ref. 23Petrel C. Kessler A. Maslah F. Dauban P. Dodd R.H. Rognan D. Ruat M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49487-49494Google Scholar). The potencies of NPS 2143 and Calhex 231 in blocking the IP response elicited by Ca2+ on these receptors are reported in Table I. The dose-response curves of NPS 2143 for the three mutants F684A,F688A located in TM3, and E837A located in TM7, respectively, were profoundly affected as shown in Fig. 4, A and B. Thus, NPS 2143 lost its ability to block the Ca2+-induced IP response in CaSR having the point mutation F684A,F688A (<30% inhibition by 10 μm NPS 2143), as well as E837A (<20% inhibition by 10 μm NPS 2143). These data indicate that these residues play a key role in NPS 2143 recognition. Analysis of the dose-response of the R680A mutant revealed a ∼12-fold increase of the IC50 value for NPS 2143 thereby demonstrating that Arg-680, which is located next to the two crucial phenylalanines Phe-684 and Phe-688 in TM3, also participates in the binding of NPS 2143 (Table I). However, this mutation led to a significant decrease in the IC50 of Calhex 231 in inhibiting the Ca2+-induced IP response (IC50 = 0.12 ± 0.02 μm) compared with the WT receptor (IC50 = 0.39 ± 0.08 μm, p < 0.05) (Table I). Analysis of the dose response of the I841A mutant indicated a ∼12-fold increase of the IC50 value for NPS 2143, which demonstrates that Ile-841, located next to Glu-837 in TM7, is also implicated in the binding of NPS 2143. The last mutations studied, T764A and H766A, corresponding to two residues located in the extracellular loop 2 that could potentially block access of compounds to the TM region, as well as L776A located in TM5, and W818A,F821A both located in TM6, did not significantly affect the ability of NPS 2143 to block the Ca2+-induced IP response in transfected cells (Table I). Potency of Calindol—In a recent preliminary report, we described the synthesis and characterization of a novel series of molecules displaying calcimimetic properties toward the rat CaSR (24Faure H. Ruat M. Kessler A. Dauban P. Dodd R.H. Osteoporos. Int. 2002; 1: S29Google Scholar). We have now synthesized and investigated the potency of Calindol (Fig. 1), which belongs to this family of molecules, toward the human CaSR. In the presence of 2 mm Ca2+, increasing concentrations of Calindol led to a dose-dependent increase of the IP response in transfected cells, which was similar to that obtained with a reference calcimimetic NPS R-568 (11Ferry S. Chatel B. Dodd R.H. Lair C. Gully D. Maffrand J.P. Ruat M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 866-873Google Scholar, 12Mailland M. Waelchli R. Ruat M. Boddeke H.G. Seuwen K.

A. 1998; 95: 4040-4045Google Scholar), in parallel experiments performed under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 5). Analysis of the dose-response curves gave an EC50 of 0.31 ± 0.05 and 0.50 ± 0.05 μm (mean ± S.E., n = 5) for Calindol and NPS R-568, respectively. In the presence of 1 μm Calindol or NPS R-568, the concentration-response curve for Ca2+ was significantly left-shifted (EC50 for Ca2+ = 3.4 ± 0.1 mm; EC50 for Ca2+ + 1 μm Calindol or NPS R-568 = 1.6 ± 0.3 mm) and the maximal responses were significantly increased (Fig. 6, Table II). These results show that Calindol and NPS R-568 display similar pharmacological properties toward the human CaSR and that both compounds enhance the affinity of Ca2+ for its receptor. These data also suggest that these molecules are allosteric modulators, and possibly interact at the level of the TM for CaSR. We therefore examined whether amino acid residues involved in the recognition of the calcilytics are also implicated in the recognition of these two calcimimetics.Fig. 6Effect of CaSR mutations in stimulating Ca2+-induced accumulation of IP by Calindol and NPS R-568. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected as described under “Materials and Methods” with the WT or appropriate mutant receptors, and were stimulated by increasing concentrations of Ca2+ alone (filled squares), or in the presence of 1 μm Calindol or NPS R-568 (open and closed circles, respectively). Data are expressed as % of maximal IP response of each mutant observed with 10 mm Ca2+ and are means of duplicates from a typical experiment representative of three to five experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IISummary of the effects of various CaSR mutations on the properties of Ca2+, Calindol, and NPS R-568ReceptorPositionMaximal responseCa2+, EC50ControlCalindolNPS R-568ControlCalindolNPS R-568%mmWT100 ± 4125 ± 11ap < 0.01 compared to the WT receptor.135 ± 7bp < 0.001 compared to the WT receptor.3.4 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.3bp < 0.001 compared to the WT receptor.1.6 ± 0.3bp < 0.001 compared to the WT receptor.F684ATM350 ± 442 ± 2ap < 0.01 compared to the WT receptor.46 ± 25.9 ± 0.42.5 ± 0.1bp < 0.001 compared to the WT receptor.2.9 ± 0.2bp < 0.001 compared to the WT receptor.F688ATM350 ± 345 ± 460 ± 25.9 ± 0.22.1 ± 0.1bp < 0.001 compared to the WT receptor.2.5 ± 0.2bp < 0.001 compared to the WT receptor.L776ATM5121 ± 9116 ± 5113 ± 52.2 ± 0.30.7 ± 0.2bp < 0.001 compared to the WT receptor.0.8 ± 0.1bp < 0.001 compared to the WT receptor.W818ATM672 ± 492 ± 2bp < 0.001 compared to the WT receptor.97 ± 5bp < 0.001 compared to the WT receptor.3.4 ± 0.23.1 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.2ap < 0.01 compared to the WT receptor.F821ATM6112 ± 10112 ± 6125 ± 42.6 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.3ap < 0.01 compared to the WT receptor.2.6 ± 0.3E837ATM772 ± 565 ± 3ap < 0.01 compared to the WT receptor.73 ± 53.8 ± 0.23.6 ± 0.13.0 ± 0.3I841ATM798 ± 660 ± 2bp < 0.001 compared to the WT receptor.59 ± 4bp < 0.001 compared to the WT receptor.2.9 ± 0.22.3 ± 0.22.7 ± 0.2a p < 0.01 compared to the WT receptor.b p < 0.001 compared to the WT receptor.

The marked shift in the EC50 for Ca2+ observed for the WT CaSR corresponding to the potentiation of the Ca2+ effect by the calcimimetics was completely abolished in the presence of Calindol or NPS R-568 in cells transfected with the mutants bearing E837A or I841A mutations. It was also completely abrogated in the presence of Calindol but not of NPS R-568 when the W818A mutant was tested, and in the presence of NPS R-568 but not of Calindol when the F821A mutant was analyzed. For all other mutants tested, we observed a decrease in the EC50 for Ca2+ in the presence of either Calindol or NPS R-568 (Fig. 6, Table II). For example, the mutant receptors bearing the F684A or F688A mutations exhibited a marked decrease of their EC50 for Ca2+, being shifted from 5.9 mm for Ca2+ alone to 2-3 mm in the presence of calcimimetic"
https://openalex.org/W2082715693,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) induces a disease similar to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in cats, yet in contrast to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), CD4 is not the viral receptor. We identified a primary receptor for FIV as CD134 (OX40), a T cell activation antigen and costimulatory molecule. CD134 expression promotes viral binding and renders cells permissive for viral entry, productive infection, and syncytium formation. Infection is CXCR4-dependent, analogous to infection with X4 strains of HIV. Thus, despite the evolutionary divergence of the feline and human lentiviruses, both viruses use receptors that target the virus to a subset of cells that are pivotal to the acquired immune response."

Stephens D.S. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1997; 314: 245-249Google Scholar, 2Hooton T.M. Stamm W.E. Infect. Dis. Clin. North Am. 1997; 11: 551-581Google Scholar). The most common causative agent of UTIs is uropathogenic Escherichia coli (2Hooton T.M. Stamm W.E. Infect. Dis. Clin. North Am. 1997; 11: 551-581Google Scholar, 3Svanborg C. Godaly G. Infect. Dis. Clin. North Am. 1997; 11: 513-529Google Scholar), which expresses filamentous organelles of adhesion called type 1 fimbriae (4Abraham S.N. Sun D. Dale J.B. Beachey E.H. Nature. 1988; 336: 682-684Google Scholar). These fimbriae mediate bacterial adherence to the uroepithelium, promoting sustained colonization of this normally sterile body site (5Connell I. Agace W. Klemm P. Schembri M. Marild S. Svanborg C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9827-9832Google Scholar). An important characteristic of UTIs is the frequency of recurrence among women (6Stapleton A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 462: 351-358Google Scholar), as up to 25% of women who experience a first UTI will have a second infection within 6 months (7Foxman B. Am. J. Public Health. 1990; 80: 331-333Google Scholar). Historically, recurrence was thought to be initiated by a reinfection of the urinary tract from a reservoir of uropathogenic bacteria located in the gastrointestinal tract (8Hooton T.M. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 2001; 17: 259-268Google Scholar). However, recently it has been shown that E. coli can survive for many weeks in the bladders of mice, without bacteriuria (9Mulvey M.A. Schilling J.D. Hultgren S.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4572-4579Google Scholar, 10Schilling J.D. Lorenz R.G. Hultgren S.J. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 7042-7049Google Scholar). This establishment of a quiescent bladder infection has been linked to the ability of type 1 fimbriated E. coli to invade and persist within bladder epithelial cells (BEC). Invasion was mediated by bacterial type 1 fimbriae (11Martinez J.J. Mulvey M.A. Schilling J.D. Pinkner J.S. Hultgren S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2803-2812Google Scholar), and in their intracellular location, the bacteria were presumably inaccessible to immune cells of the host as well as antibiotics (9Mulvey M.A. Schilling J.D. Hultgren S.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4572-4579Google Scholar, 10Schilling J.D. Lorenz R.G. Hultgren S.J. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 7042-7049Google Scholar). The ability of E. coli to invade and persist within BEC could explain the frequent recurrence of E. coli infections of the bladder and their apparent resistance to antibiotic therapy. It is interesting that the typically noninvasive uropathogenic E. coli is able to invade the bladder epithelium, considering the highly impermeable barrier it presents to its luminal contents (12Lewis S.A. Diamond J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1976; 28: 1-40Google Scholar, 13Lewis S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F867-F874Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that the high impermeability of the urothelium arises largely from the presence of scallop-shaped plaques on the apical surface of the superficial BEC, also known as the asymmetric unit membrane, which line the lumen of the bladder (13Lewis S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F867-F874Google Scholar, 14Hu P. Meyers S. Liang F.X. Deng F.M. Kachar B. Zeidel M.L. Sun T.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F1200-F1207Google Scholar). These plaques are composed of four subunits, known as uroplakins (UP): UPIa, the host receptor for type 1 fimbriated E. coli (15Zhou G. Mo W.J. Sebbel P. Min G. Neubert T.A. Glockshuber R. Wu X.R. Sun T.T. Kong X.P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4095-4103Google Scholar), and UPIb, which pair with UPII and UPIII, respectively (16Wu X.R. Medina J.J. Sun T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29752-29759Google Scholar). The composition of the lipids associated with the urothelial plaques is also believed to play a large role in determining the permeability barrier of the uroepithelium (14Hu P. Meyers S. Liang F.X.

Purified urothelial plaques are rich in both cholesterol and sphingolipids (18Vergara J. Zambrano F. Robertson J.D. Elrod H. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 83-94Google Scholar, 19Ketterer B. Hicks R.M. Christodoulides L. Beale D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 311: 180-190Google Scholar), which leads to a more ordered lipid structure, lowering membrane fluidity and permeability and favoring microdomain formation (20Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Google Scholar, 21Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 67-84Google Scholar, 22Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Google Scholar). Thus, the urothelial plaques work in conjunction with associated specialized lipid microdomains to mediate the high impermeability of the uroepithelium. Cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched microdomains have recently been the focus of much study and are often referred to as lipid rafts (20Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Google Scholar, 22Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Google Scholar, 23Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are highly ordered regions of the plasma membranes enriched in not only cholesterol and sphingolipids but also glycolipids and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored molecules and may contain a 22-kDa protein, caveolin-1 (20Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Google Scholar, 23Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Google Scholar, 24Couet J. Belanger M.M. Roussel E. Drolet M.C. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2001; 49: 223-235Google Scholar). A subtype of lipid rafts, caveolae, has a distinct cave-like morphology in the plasma membrane (23Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Google Scholar, 25Duncan M.J. Shin J.S. Abraham S.N. Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 783-791Google Scholar). Lipid rafts have been implicated in signal transduction as a large number of signaling molecules aggregate within them (20Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Google Scholar, 23Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Google Scholar, 24Couet J. Belanger M.M. Roussel E. Drolet M.C. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2001; 49: 223-235Google Scholar). These microdomains also possess a versatile endocytic capacity that has been implicated recently in microbial pathogenesis as demonstrated by their ability to mediate the entry of viruses, bacteria, and even large parasites into host cells (25Duncan M.J. Shin J.S. Abraham S.N. Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 783-791Google Scholar, 26van der Goot F.G. Harder T. Semin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 89-97Google Scholar). Paradoxically, E. coli may be using the very same structures that mediate the highly impermeable nature of the uroepithelium, namely urothelial plaques (specifically UPIa) and the cholesterol/sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains associated with them, to penetrate the uroepithelial barrier. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the role of lipid rafts in type 1 fimbriated E. coli invasion of BEC, as elucidation of the molecular aspects of E. coli entry into BEC could lead to the development of effective strategies to prevent the emergence and recurrence of UTIs. Bacteria and Cell Lines—E. coli strain ORN103 (27Orndorff P.E. Falkow S. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 736-744Google Scholar), containing a complete deletion of the type 1 fimbrial gene cluster, was transformed with plasmid pSH2 (type 1 fimbrial gene cluster, chloramphenicol resistance) (27Orndorff P.E. Falkow S. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 736-744Google Scholar) or plasmid pREP4 (kanamycin resistance) (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Bacteria were grown in 10 ml of static Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with the appropriate antibiotics for 24 h prior to use. Uropathogenic E. coli J96 (28Svanborg Eden C. Hull R. Falkow S. Leffler H. Prog. Food Nutr. Sci. 1983; 7: 75-89Google Scholar) was grown in 10 ml of static Luria-Bertani (LB) broth for 24 h in the absence of antibiotics. Type 1 fimbrial expression was confirmed by mannose-sensitive agglutination of baker's yeast. Listeria monocytogenes was grown overnight in brain heart infusion broth (BD Biosciences). The human bladder epithelial cell line 5637 (ATCC HTB-9) was grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2.0 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.3 g/liter l-glutamine, 2.5 g/liter glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. 5637 BEC Uroplakin Ia Expression—5637 BEC lysates (∼8.0 × 106 cells) were made in 400 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and either boiled for 5 min or allowed to remain at room temperature (RT) for 30 min before SDS-PAGE (45 μl of each sample), transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotting with a UPIa-specific polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). In Vitro Bacterial Invasion Assays—5637 bladder epithelial cells were seeded into 96-well plates and grown to confluence. Bladder cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 50-100 bacteria per host cell by the addition of 100 μl of bacteria diluted in serum-free cell culture medium containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma), A600 ∼0.05. Plates were centrifuged for 5 min at 600 × g to accelerate bacterial contact with host cells. Plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium containing 100 μg/ml of the membrane-impermeable antibiotic gentamicin (Invitrogen) to kill extracellular bacteria. Incubation was continued for an additional 1 h, after which each well was washed three times with PBS and the cells were lysed by the addition of 100 μl of 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and plated onto LB agar plates with chloramphenicol for E. coli ORN103(pSH2) or brain heart infusion agar plates for L. monocytogenes. To test the effect of specific caveolar disruptors/usurpers on bacterial invasion, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (1, 5, or 10 mm, Sigma) along with lovastatin (10 μm) in serum-free medium was added to the cells for 30 min prior to infection. The cells were washed three times to remove the methyl-β-cyclodextrin, and the medium was replaced with bacteria-containing medium along with 10 μm lovastatin. Nystatin (5 mg/ml stock in Me2SO, Sigma) was added to the cells at a concentration of 50 μg/ml in serum-free medium for 30 min prior to infection. Nystatin was removed by washing three times, and the cells were infected as before. The B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB, Sigma) was preincubated with the cells for 30 min before infection at a concentration of 20 μg/ml and remained on the cells throughout the invasion assay. The viability of the bladder cells was not affected by any of the treatments used as determined by trypan blue exclusion. The MTT adherence assay was performed as follows. 5637 cells were plated overnight onto 96-well plates and then incubated with 0, 1, 5, or 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 30 min as above and then fixed overnight with 2.5% paraformaldehyde. The monolayers were washed three times with sterile PBS and pretreated for 1 h at RT with blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS). 100 μl of ORN103(pSH2) (A600 ∼1.0) in PBS was incubated with the monolayers for 1 h at RT. Nonadherent bacteria were removed by washing the cell monolayers three times with PBS. Fifty μl of LB was applied to each monolayer and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. MTT (Sigma) was dissolved in PBS at 2 mg/ml, filter-sterilized, and stored at 4 °C until use. Fifty μl of 2 mg/ml MTT was added to all wells, and the plates were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C to allow reduction of MTT to formazan by live bacteria. 150 μl of isopropyl alcohol and hydrochloric acid (at a ratio of 24:1) was added to each well to solubilize the formazan and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a Tecan Sunrise remote microplate reader. Bacterial Invasion of Mouse Bladder Epithelium in Vivo—For quantitative determination of bacterial invasion, 8-week-old female BALB/c mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and inoculated transurethrally with 50 μlofan E. coli J96 bacterial suspension (∼1.0 × 108 colony-forming units) or a L. monocytogenes bacterial suspension (∼1.0 × 107 colony-forming units) suspended in PBS with or without 25 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin. After 1 h, bladders were aseptically removed, bisected, and incubated for 1 h in culture media with 100 μg/ml gentamicin followed by homogenization in 1 ml of sterile 0.1% Triton X-100. Serial dilutions of the homogenates were plated onto MacConkey agar plates (for E. coli J96) or brain heart infusion agar plates (for L. monocytogenes). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin had no effect on bacterial viability as determined by colony counts with or without a 60-min incubation in 25 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin. Sucrose Density Fractionation of Infected Bladder Epithelial Cells—Bladder epithelial cells were grown to confluence on OmniTray tissue culture plates (growth area ∼110 cm2, Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). Three plates were infected with FITC-labeled E. coli ORN103(pSH2) in 15 ml of serum-free medium (1 × 109-2 × 109 bacteria per plate) for 2 h. Infected plates, along with three uninfected plates, were washed five times with ice-cold PBS and scraped off the plates using a rubber policeman in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and a 1:100 dilution of mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). The cell suspension was then passed 20 times through a 27-gauge needle, brought to 45% sucrose by the addition of an equal volume of 90% sucrose, and then overlaid with 2 ml each of 35, 25, 15, and 5% sucrose. The gradients were centrifuged for 18 h at 39,000 rpm in a SW41Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA), and 10 equal fractions were collected from the top of each gradient and assayed for caveolin-1 by Western blotting using polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories, San Diego) and a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). The fractions were also assayed for fluorescence using a fluorometer. Fluorescent Microscopy—5637 bladder epithelial cells were seeded onto 12-mm diameter glass coverslips placed into the wells of a 24-well plate and grown overnight. The cells were infected with ORN103(pSH2) as in the invasion assays. The infected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1-2 h, washed four times with PBS to remove unbound bacteria (followed by an additional 1-h incubation with 20 μg/ml FITC-CTB (Sigma) for the cells to be examined for GM1 labeling), and fixed overnight in 2.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS. To label cholesterol, the cells were incubated with 200 μg/ml of the UV fluorescent cholesterol-binding fungal toxin filipin (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min. To examine caveolin-1 labeling, 5637 cells grown on coverslips as above were infected with the uropathogenic E. coli J96 for 1-2 h as in the invasion assays, washed three times with PBS, and fixed overnight with 2.5% paraformaldehyde. After removing the fixative, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and caveolin-1 was then labeled using polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody followed with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 F(ab′)2 (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were examined using a Nikon Eclipse TE200 microscope with a 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole filter set to examine filipin labeling and a fluorescein filter set to examine GM1 and caveolin-1 labeling. Lipid Raft Purification—5637 BEC lipid rafts were purified using a method described previously with some modifications (29Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Google Scholar). Briefly, 5637 BEC grown to confluency on OmniTray tissue culture plates (growth area ∼110 cm2, Nalge Nunc International) were left untreated or treated with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin in serum-free RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 1 h. Treated and untreated cells (two tissue culture plates per condition) were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and removed from the plates using rubber policeman in 3 ml of ice-cold PBS per plate. Treated and untreated cells were then collected by centrifugation, and each cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold carbonate buffer (500 mm Na2CO3 (pH 11.00), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and a 1:100 dilution of mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). The cells were homogenized by passing through a 21-guage needle 20 times, sonicated in an ice bath for 5 min, and passaged through a 21-guage needle an additional 20 times. The samples were brought to 45% sucrose by the addition of an equal volume of 90% sucrose in MBS (25 mm MES (Sigma), 75 mm NaCl, pH 6.8) and then overlaid with 4 ml each of 35 and 5% sucrose in MBS. The gradients were centrifuged for 18 h at 39,000 rpm in a SW41Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA), and 12 equal fractions (1 ml each) were collected from the top of each gradient and assayed for Rac1 and caveolin-1 by Western blotting using monoclonal anti-Rac1 (Transduction Laboratories) or polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody. Lipid rafts were purified from BALB/c mouse bladders as follows. Bladders from 15 BALB/c female mice were removed and washed briefly in ice-cold PBS, before brief homogenization in a Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder (Kontes Glass Co., Vineland, NJ) in ice-cold PBS. The resulting suspension was filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences) and collected by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of carbonate buffer and homogenized by passing through a 21-gauge needle 20 times, sonicated in an ice bath for 5 min, and passaged through a 21-gauge needle an additional 20 times. The sample was brought to 45% sucrose by the addition of an equal volume of 90% sucrose in MBS and then overlaid with 2 ml each of 35 and 5% sucrose in MBS. The gradient was centrifuged for 18 h at 39,000 rpm in a SW41Ti rotor, and 12 equal fractions (500 μl each) were collected from the top of each gradient and assayed for UPIa, caveolin-1, and clathrin heavy chain by Western blotting using polyclonal anti-UPIa, polyclonal anti-caveolin-1, or monoclonal anti-clathrin heavy chain (Transduction Laboratories) antibodies. Immunoprecipitation—Caveolin-1 and Rac1 were immunoprecipitated from fraction 5 of the 5637 BEC lipid raft preparation as follows. 400 μl of fraction 5 was brought to 1 ml with MBS (1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, and a 1:100 dilution of mammalian protease inhibitor mixture). The sample was precleared with 10 μg of normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 50 μl of a 50% suspension of protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) in MBS for 1 h at 4 °C. 4 μg of polyclonal anti-Rac1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 was added, and the sample was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. 50 μl of a 50% suspension of protein G-Sepharose was added, and the sample was further incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of MBS (1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, and a 1:100 dilution of mammalian protease inhibitor mixture), resuspended in 60 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Immunoprecipitates were assayed for Rac1 and caveolin-1 using monoclonal anti-Rac1 or polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibodies. Construction of Small Interfering RNA Vector, Transfection, and Infection—To construct the small interfering RNA expression vector, the pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences) backbone was used. Briefly, pEGFP-N1 was digested by BglII and BamHI and was then re-ligated to generate pEGFP-N1A. Human U6 small nuclear RNA promoter was PCR-amplified from pTZ U6 + 1 (gift from John Rossi, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, Duarte, CA) with added HindIII and BamHI sites at 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The PCR product was cloned into pUC18 to generate pUC18-U6. The U6 promoter and its flanking multiple cloning sites were PCR-amplified from pUC18-U6 with an added AflII site at both 5′ and 3′ ends. The PCR product was cloned into pEGFP-N1A by using its unique AflII site to generate pEGFP-N1A-U6. Oligo1, 5′-GATCCCGGAGATCGACCTGGTCAAC- TTCAAGAGAGTTGACCAGGTCGATCTCCTTTTTGGAAG-3′, and oligo2, 5′-AATTCTTCCAAAAAAGGAGATCGACCTGGTCAACTCTCTTGAAGTTGACCAGGTCGATCTCCGG-3′ were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Coralville, IA. The boldface and underlined sequences are forward and reverse sequences, respectively, which correspond to nucleotides 419-437 of the human cavolin-1 gene (Gen-Bank™ accession number NM-001753). Oligo1 and 2 were annealed to form double-stranded DNA and cloned into pEGFP-N1A-U6 by using BamHI and EcoRI sites to generate pSi-Cav419. pEGFP-N1A-U6 and pSi-Cav419 were used to transfect human bladder cell line 5637 by using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Five days following transfection, the cells were plated onto 96-well plates and grown overnight, followed by the invasion assay using E. coli ORN103(pSH2) as described above. The transfected cells were also seeded onto glass coverslips and grown overnight, followed by paraformaldehyde fixation and labeling for caveolin-1 with polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 and goat antirabbit Alexa Fluor 660 F(ab′)2 (Molecular Probes). Endogenous caveolin-1 expression was examined using a Nikon Eclipse TE200 confocal scanning light microscope. Whole cell lysates of 5-day post-transfection cells were examined by Western blotting using polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody as above or monoclonal anti-β-actin, clone AC-15 (Sigma), to control for protein loading. Densitometry was performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Electron Microscopy—Bladder epithelial cells grown on Transwell filters were left uninfected or infected with E. coli ORN103(pSH2) for 4 h, washed to remove unbound bacteria, and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS. The filters were processed for TEM using standard methods. For the enumeration of caveolae, uninfected cells grown on Transwell filters and processed for TEM as above were examined, and caveolae were enumerated as described previously (30Vogel U. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 825-832Google Scholar). The 5637 Human BEC Line Expresses UPIa Protein—To begin studying the aspects of E. coli BEC invasion, we utilized a well established in vitro model, the 5637 human BEC line, that has been shown to closely mimic E. coli/BEC interactions in vivo (9Mulvey M.A. Schilling J.D. Hultgren S.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4572-4579Google Scholar, 11Martinez J.J. Mulvey M.A. Schilling J.D. Pinkner J.S. Hultgren S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2803-2812Google Scholar, 31Martinez J.J. Hultgren S.J. Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 19-28Google Scholar, 32Schilling J.D. Mulvey M.A. Vincent C.D. Lorenz R.G. Hultgren S.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1148-1155Google Scholar, 33Schilling J.D. Martin S.M. Hunstad D.A. Patel K.P. Mulvey M.A. Justice S.S. Lorenz R.G. Hultgren S.J. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 1470-1480Google Scholar). Although 5637 BEC have been used previously, they were never shown to express the protein UPIa, the in vivo host receptor for type 1 fimbriated E. coli (15Zhou G. Mo W.J. Sebbel P. Min G. Neubert T.A. Glockshuber R. Wu X.R. Sun T.T. Kong X.P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4095-4103Google Scholar). We therefore examined 5637 BEC for the expression of UPIa. Western blotting was performed on a whole cell lysate boiled in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, using a UPIa specific antibody. No band of the expected size (27 kDa) was seen, but a much larger, unclear band was observed, indicating that the protein may have been aggregated by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, as reported previously for bovine UPI (Fig. 1A) (34Wu X.R. Manabe M. Yu J. Sun T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19170-19179Google Scholar). Another whole cell lysate was prepared and allowed to remain at room temperature for 30 min before SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, and a single band of the appropriate size was seen, demonstrating that 5637 BEC express UPIa, the in vivo host cell receptor for E. coli type 1 fimbriae (Fig. 1B). Morphological Aspects of E. coli Invasion—Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on uninfected and infected 5637 BEC monolayers, grown on Transwell filters, to explore the morphological aspects of E. coli invasion. Uninfected BEC were observed to express distinct cave-like structures, called caveolae, along their basolateral surface (218 basolateral caveolae/mm of filter), but none were visible on their apical surface, consistent with previous reports of polarized caveolae expression on other epithelial cell lines (Fig. 1C) (30Vogel U. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 825-832Google Scholar). On BEC infected with type 1 fimbriated E. coli, caveolae were now found at the apical surface, intimately associated with invading bacteria at their point of attachment and forming part of the phagosomal structure encasing internalized bacteria (Fig. 1, D-F). As a means of further demonstrating lipid raft association with intracellular E. coli, we examined infected BEC using specific probes for the most commonly used markers of lipid rafts: caveolin-1, cholesterol, and the glycolipid GM1 (23Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Google Scholar, 35Shin J.S. Gao Z. Abraham S.N. Science. 2000; 289: 785-788Google Scholar, 36Baorto D.M. Gao Z. Malaviya R. Dustin M.L. van der Merwe A. Lublin D.M. Abraham S.N. Nature. 1997; 389: 636-639Google Scholar). Shown in Fig. 2, B, D, and F, are fluorescent images showing the accumulation of caveolin-1, cholesterol, and GM1, respectively, around intracellular E. coli. The corresponding differential interference contrast images are shown in Fig. 2, A, C, and E. We also employed a biochemical approach to demonstrate mobilization of cellular caveolin-1 to sites of intracellular bacteria. FITC-labeled E. coli ORN103(pSH2) were incubated with BEC, after which the cells were homogenized and fractionated on a sucrose gradient to isolate intracellular bacteria-containing compartments as described previously (35Shin J.S. Gao Z. Abraham S.N. Science. 2000; 289: 785-788Google Scholar). Each of the various fractions was collected and probed for fluorescence. Most of the fluorescence was associated with fractions 8-10, which represented extracellular bacteria (Fig. 2G). However, a small peak of fluorescence, representing bacteria-containing phagosomes, was detected in fraction 5. When fractions obtained from infected and uninfected BEC were probed with caveolin-1-specific antibody on a Western blot, the distributio"
https://openalex.org/W2155279315,"Copper uptake and subsequent delivery to copper-dependent enzymes are essential for many cellular processes. However, the intracellular levels of this nutrient must be controlled because of its potential toxicity. The hCtr1 protein functions in high affinity copper uptake at the plasma membrane of human cells. Recent studies have shown that elevated copper stimulates the endocytosis and degradation of the hCtr1 protein, and this response is likely an important homeostatic mechanism that prevents the overaccumulation of copper. The domains of hCtr1 involved in copper-stimulated endocytosis and degradation are unknown. In this study we examined the importance of potential copper-binding sequences in the extracellular domain and a conserved transmembrane 150MXXXM154 motif for copper-stimulated endocytosis and degradation of hCtr1. The endocytic response of hCtr1 to low copper concentrations required an amino-terminal methionine cluster (40MMMMPM45) closest to the transmembrane region. However, this cluster was not required for the endocytic response to higher copper levels, suggesting this motif may function as a high affinity copper-sensing domain. Moreover, the transmembrane 150MXXXM154 motif was absolutely required for copper-stimulated endocytosis and degradation of hCtr1 even under high copper concentrations. Together with previous studies demonstrating a role for these motifs in high affinity copper transport activity, our findings suggest common biochemical mechanisms regulate both transport and trafficking functions of hCtr1.

Copper is an essential trace element required for several enzymes with critical roles in metabolism, including cytochrome c oxidase, lysyl oxidase, dopamine B hydroxylase, superoxide dismutase, and ferroxidases (1Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The ability of copper to exist in two redox states, Cu+ and Cu2+, enables copper-containing enzymes to catalyze electron transfer reactions. However, these same redox properties of copper also make it toxic when present in elevated concentrations within cells. Excess copper can generate the formation of hydroxyl radicals that damage lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. This paradox of an essential yet toxic nutrient has resulted in the evolution of sophisticated homeostatic mechanisms that maintain an essential supply and controlled distribution of copper while preventing its overaccumulation. Menkes disease and Wilson disease provide genetic evidence of the importance of maintaining copper balance in humans. The Menkes and Wilson disease genes, ATP7A and ATP7B, respectively, encode two closely related copper-transporting P-type ATPases that are located in the trans-Golgi network (2Petris M.J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), whereas ATP7B, which is mainly expressed in the liver, relocates to post-Golgi vesicles where the transporter is thought to compartmentalize copper prior to its excretion (4Hung I.H.

The copper-stimulated trafficking of ATP7A/B proteins is an important post-translational mechanism for regulating copper export, and recent studies indicate that copper-responsive trafficking also regulates mammalian copper uptake (6Petris M.J.

These proteins were the founding members of a widely conserved family of Ctr proteins identified in fungi, plants, insects, and mammals.

Analysis of the human hCtr1 and mouse mCtr1 proteins in mammalian cells indicates these proteins function as copper importers (10Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Dagenais S.L. Glover T.W. Thiele D.J.

The deletion of mCtr1 in mice results in a severe embryonic lethal phenotype, suggesting that high affinity copper uptake via this protein is critical for normal mammalian development (12Kuo Y.M.

Members of the Ctr family are integral membrane proteins with three membrane-spanning helices, and studies on yCtr1 and hCtr1 indicate that these proteins assemble as multimers (11Lee J. Pena M.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar).Another conserved feature of the Ctr1 protein family is the existence of methionine-rich sequences in the extracellular amino-terminal region (1Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 16Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). These sequences, referred to as “Mets” motifs, have the consensus MXXMXM, and the hCtr1 protein possesses two such motifs. The similarity of Mets motifs to copper-binding domains of the bacterial copper transporters, CopB and CutE, provided initial indications that these sequences may bind copper (8Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies of yCtr1 and hCtr1 proteins have revealed that the Mets motifs are essential for normal copper uptake when extracellular levels are low, suggesting that these sequences primarily function to scavenge copper when the metal is scarce (16Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). All Ctr1 family members also possess an MXXXM motif, which is predicted to reside within the second transmembrane domain and is essential for copper transport activity of yCtr1 and hCtr1 (16Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar).The hCtr1 and yCtr1 proteins, like the ATP7A/B copper exporters, are post-translationally regulated by copper availability. Elevated copper stimulates the rapid endocytosis and degradation of yCtr1 and hCtr1 (6Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 17Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This process may function to attenuate copper uptake and prevent overaccumulation of this potentially toxic metal. However, the domains of Ctr1 proteins involved in sensing copper and stimulating endocytosis are unknown. In this study, we examined the role of the conserved extracellular Mets motifs, two histidine-rich regions, and the 150MXXXM154 sequence in regulating the copper-responsive endocytosis and degradation of hCtr1. The Mets motif closest to the first transmembrane region was required to stimulate endocytosis in response to low micromolar copper levels but not elevated concentrations. Moreover, mutation of either methionine of the 150MXXXM154 motif completely abolished copper-responsive endocytosis and degradation of hCtr1 even under high copper concentrations. These findings suggest a model whereby the endocytic response of hCtr1 to copper may require the protein to be a functional copper transporter.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids, Cell Lines, and Antibodies—The hCtr1 mutations in this study were either introduced previously into the hCtr1 cDNA (16Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) or generated by PCR mutagenesis and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) mammalian expression plasmid. DNA sequencing was used to verify each mutation. The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2. This basal medium contains ∼1 μm copper. Cells were transfected with the pcDNA3.1 empty vector or the same vector harboring the wild type or mutant alleles of hCtr1 using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After selection for 10 days with 500 μg/ml G418, the expression of the wild type hCtr1 and each mutant protein was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blotting (described below) using the 9E10 monoclonal affinity-purified anti-myc antibody (Roche Applied Science). In specific experiments, de novo protein synthesis was inhibited by pretreating cells for 30 min with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (ICN), which was subsequently maintained throughout copper treatments.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown overnight on sterile glass coverslips coated with poly(l-lysine) (Sigma), washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, and then fixed for 10 min at 25 °C using 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, blocked for 1 h with 1% bovine serum albumin and 3% skim milk in PBS, and then probed with the anti-myc antibodies (10 μg/ml) followed by Alexa 488 anti-mouse antibodies (1:1000). For copper-treated samples, 100 μm CuCl2 was added to the medium for 2 h prior to fixing.Detection of hCtr1 Protein Levels at the Plasma Membrane and Western Blots—The pool of hCtr1-myc at the plasma membrane was assessed by measuring the levels of anti-myc antibodies bound to the surface of HEK/hCtr1-myc cells as described previously with minor modifications (6Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). HEK/hCtr1-myc cells were cultured for 24 h in poly(l-lysine)-coated 6-well trays, washed twice with PBS on ice, and blocked for 10 min with ice-cold PBS containing 5% skim milk. The cells were then incubated with the anti-myc antibody (1:500) for 20 min at 4 °C. After washing the cells five times with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS to remove unbound antibodies, the cells (with retained antibodies) were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (62 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science)) and then fractionated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE. After transferring proteins to nitrocellulose membranes, the anti-myc antibodies were detected using anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (1: 5000) using a chemiluminescence detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Tubulin protein levels were detected on parallel immunoblots using antitubulin antibodies (1:40,000; Sigma). The detection of total myc-tagged wild type and mutant hCtr1 proteins was performed as described previously (6Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar).Assay of hCtr1 Endocytosis—The endocytosis of hCtr1-myc was determined by measuring the uptake of anti-myc antibodies added to the cultured medium of stably transfected HEK293 cells as previously described (6Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Cells were pregrown in 6-well trays for 24 h in basal medium and then incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in basal or copper-supplemented medium containing 10 μg/ml anti-myc antibodies. Cells were washed twice with PBS on ice, and surface-bound antibodies were removed by three washes in ice-cold acidic buffer (100 mm glycine, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium chloride, pH 2.2). Cells were harvested by scraping into ice-cold PBS and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g. The cell pellets were solubilized in SDS buffer (see above), and 20 μg of lysates containing internalized anti-myc antibodies were separated using 4–20% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by chemiluminescence using anti-mouse HRP antibodies.RESULTSThe human Ctr1 protein contains two Mets motifs, M1 (7MGMSYM12) and M2 (40MMMMPM45), and two histidine-rich regions, H1 (3HSHH6) and H2 (22HHH24), in the extracellular amino-terminal region (Fig. 1A). Copper uptake experiments using transfected HEK293 cells and complementation studies of the yeast Δctr1Δctr3Δ mutant suggest that the M2 motif, but not the M1, H1, or H2 motifs, is required for high affinity copper uptake activity under low copper conditions (16Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The same study found that both methionines of the conserved 150MXXXM154 motif are absolutely critical for copper uptake via hCtr1 but not for localization to the plasma membrane. The aim of the current study was to determine the importance of these motifs for the copper-responsive endocytosis and degradation of hCtr1 observed previously (6Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). All histidine residues in the H1 and H2 motifs and methionine residues in the M1 and M2 motifs were substituted for alanine, and HEK293 cells were stably transfected with myc-tagged hCtr1 constructs bearing these mutations. After selecting for G418 resistance, surviving populations of cells were screened for expression of the mutant hCtr1 proteins using immunoblots. This enabled the identification of cell lines with similar levels of expression of the monomeric (35-kDa) and multimeric (70-kDa) forms of hCtr1 mutant proteins (Fig. 1B).Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to investigate the steady-state distribution of each hCtr1 mutant protein in cells cultured in basal medium and the ability to relocalize in response to elevated copper. The Wt-hCtr1myc protein was located at the plasma membrane in cells cultured in basal medium (Fig. 2A), consistent with previous studies (6Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Exposure of the cells to 100 μm copper for 2 h resulted in the relocalization of Wt-hCtr1myc to cytoplasmic vesicles and a clear reduction in fluorescent staining of the cell periphery and overall signal intensity (Fig. 2B). This result was consistent with the copper-stimulated endocytosis and degradation of Wt-hCtr1myc protein reported previously (6Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis of the hCtr1 mutant proteins indicated that for each mutation there was strong labeling of the periphery of cells cultured in basal medium conditions, suggesting that none of the mutations grossly interfered with hCtr1 trafficking to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, C, E, G, I, K, M, and O). An incubation for 2 h with 100 μm copper stimulated the relocalization of M1, M2, M1/M2, H1, and H2 mutants to cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 2, D, F, H, J, and L), suggesting that none of these mutations abolished copper-responsive endocytosis of hCtr1 under these high copper conditions (see below for low copper conditions). This result was in sharp contrast to the M150A and M154A mutations, which completely abolished relocalization of hCtr1 following copper treatment as indicated by the strong fluorescent staining remaining at the periphery of cells (Fig. 2, N and P). Longer exposure times and higher concentrations of copper failed to alter the location of the M150A and M154A mutant proteins (data not shown). Identical results were obtained when M150 or M154 was replaced with the similarly sized non-polar residue leucine (data not shown), suggesting that the defective trafficking response was specific to the loss of methionine. These findings suggest that the copper-induced relocalization of hCtr1 is dependent on both methionines within the conserved 150MXXXM154 sequence.Fig. 2Copper-dependent relocalization of the hCtr1 mutant proteins. Shown is immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of HEK293 cells expressing each hCtr1 mutant protein; the cells were exposed to either basal medium (A, C, E, G, I, K, M, and O) or medium containing 100 μm copper (B, D, F, H, J, L, N, and P) for 2 h. The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and blocked prior to detection of wild type (Wt) and mutant (mut) hCtr1 proteins using anti-myc antibodies followed by anti-mouse Alexa 488 secondary antibodies.

The location of the amino-terminal myc tag is extracellular when hCtr1-myc is at the plasma membrane (6Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

In previous studies we have measured copper-dependent changes in the pool of hCtr1-myc protein at the plasma membrane by probing non-permeabilized cells with anti-myc antibodies followed by Western blotting to determine the levels of these antibodies bound to the cell surface (6Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells for 2 h with 100 μm copper resulted in a marked reduction in levels of Wt-hCtr1myc at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). In control experiments, there was no binding of anti-myc antibodies to the surface of HEK293 cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). Copper treatment also resulted in a marked reduction in the plasma membrane levels of H1, H2, M1, M2, and M1/M2 mutant proteins (Fig. 3). However, this surface reduction of H2, M1, and M2 mutants occurred to a lesser extent than that of the wild type protein (see “Discussion”). Significantly, the surface levels of the M150A and M154A mutant proteins were not altered by elevated copper concentrations (Fig. 3). This result confirmed our earlier immunofluorescence data for M150A and M154A mutants, which indicated that elevated copper did not alter the steady-state distribution of these proteins (Fig. 2).Fig. 3Analysis of plasma membrane levels of hCtr1 mutant proteins following copper treatment. Immunoblots were used to detect anti-myc antibodies bound to the surface of HEK293 cells expressing each hCtr1 mutant protein after exposure to either basal medium (-) or medium containing 100 μm copper (+) for 2 h. Intact cells were cooled on ice and probed with anti-myc antibodies to bind the surface pool of hCtr1. Total lysates were prepared, and anti-myc antibodies were detected using anti-mouse HRP secondary antibodies.

Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), we tested whether the total abundance of hCtr1 following exposure to elevated copper levels was affected by the mutations depicted in Fig. 1. Western blots were used to detect levels of the hCtr1 mutant proteins in total cell lysates following a 3-h exposure to 100 μm copper in the presence of cycloheximide to prevent new protein expression (Fig. 4). The levels of both 35- and 70-kDa forms of the Wt-hCtr1myc protein were markedly reduced in response to this copper treatment, and a similar degree of degradation was observed for the H1 mutant protein (Fig. 4, lanes 13 and 14). Interestingly, the degradation of the M1, M2, M1/M2, and H2 mutants was clearly apparent in copper-treated cells; however, in each case it was not as extensive as for the Wt-hCtr1myc protein (Fig. 4; see “Discussion”). In contrast, however, the M150A and M154A mutations completely abolished hCtr1 degradation in response to copper treatment (Fig. 4, lanes 9–12). Together with the immunofluorescence analysis and assays of surface hCtr1 protein levels, these findings suggest that the Met150 and Met154 residues are critical for the copper-stimulated relocalization and degradation of hCtr1.Fig. 4Copper-dependent degradation of the hCtr1 mutant proteins. HEK293 cells expressing each hCtr1 mutant protein were exposed to either basal medium (-) or medium containing 100 μm copper (+) for 3 h prior to immunoblot analysis to detect total hCtr1 protein levels using anti-myc antibodies.

We have used this method previously to define the kinetics, sensitivity, and metal specificity of copper-stimulated endocytosis of hCtr1-myc (6Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). A low rate of endocytosis of Wt-hCtr1myc occurred in basal medium, as evident by the weakly detected internalized anti-myc antibodies (Fig. 5, lane 3). However, endocytosis of Wt-hCtr1myc was stimulated in the presence of elevated copper as indicated by the increased antibody accumulation (Fig. 5, lane 4). The internalization of anti-myc antibodies was dependent on the expression of the hCtr1-myc protein because it did not occur in HEK293 cells expressing the empty pcDNA3.1 vector (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2). For each of the mutants, anti-myc antibodies were internalized under basal copper conditions, suggesting that none of the mutations abolished the endocytosis of hCtr1-myc. It was notable that the uptake of anti-myc antibodies from basal medium by the M2 mutant protein was lower than for the wild type protein (Fig. 5, lane 7). This may be due in part to its lower abundance at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, lane 15), possibly due to a small reduction in its secretion to the plasma membrane. Elevated copper levels stimulated a marked increase in the rate of endocytosis for each hCtr1 mutant protein compared with basal medium, except for the M150A and M154A mutants, which showed no changes in endocytosis. Increasing the copper levels above 100 μm failed to stimulate endocytosis of the M150A and M154A mutants above that observed in basal medium (data not shown). These findings, together with earlier studies, suggested that the Met150 and Met154 residues are critical not only for copper uptake but also for the copper-responsive endocytosis and degradation of hCtr1.Fig. 5Analysis of copper-dependent endocytosis of the hCtr1 mutant proteins. HEK293 cells stably expressing wild type or mutant (mut) hCtr1 proteins were allowed to internalize anti-myc antibodies added to basal medium (-) or medium containing 100 μm copper (+) for 5 min. Surface antibodies were then removed by washing cells in cold acidic buffer, and intracellular antibodies were then detected by immunoblotting with anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to HRP. Note the inhibition of copper-stimulated endocytosis of M150A and M154A mutant proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have demonstrated previously that the addition of low micromolar levels of copper to basal medium is sufficient to stimulate the endocytosis of the hCtr1-myc protein (6Petris M.J.

Given that the M1, M2, H1, and H2 sequences may provide high affinity copper-binding sites, we investigated whether these motifs were essential for increasing the rate of hCtr1 endocytosis in response to a range of physiologically relevant copper concentrations closer to the Km value for hCtr1-mediated copper uptake (∼2 μm copper).

The thresholds for isomerizing conformer A to all six other conformations divided into three groups at 750 wavenumbers (cm-1)(A-->B, F), 1000 cm-1 [A-->C(2)], and 1280 to 1320 cm-1 [A-->D, E, and C(1)]. The appearance of the first band and the absence of the band below it were used to place upper and lower bounds to the barrier heights for each process. The thresholds for A-->B and B-->A isomerizations were also combined to determine the relative energies of these two lowest energy minima. The combined data from all X-->Y isomerizations identify important isomerization pathways on the potential energy surface linking the minima."

Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) down-regulates NET by sequestering it from the plasma membrane, although the underlying mechanism is not yet known. Previously, we showed robust expression of endogenous NETs in rat placental trophoblasts (Jayanthi, L. D., Vargas, G., and DeFelice, L. J. (2002) Br. J. Pharmacol. 135, 1927-1934). Here we report a significant reduction in native NET function and surface expression in these cells following phorbol ester (β-PMA) treatment. The β-PMA-mediated down-regulation of NET occurs by a rapid sequestration of NETs from the plasma membrane and is calcium-independent. Reversible biotinylation experiments revealed a significant enhancement of NET endocytosis following β-PMA treatment. Chemical treatments and expression of dominant negative mutants of dynamin 1 and 2 failed to prevent the β-PMA effect, suggesting a clathrin-independent pathway. In contrast, treatment with the cholesterol-disrupting agent filipin, which blocks caveolae/lipid raft-mediated internalization, completely blocked the β-PMA-mediated NET sequestration. Discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed NET in the lipid raft fractions. Following β-PMA treatment, there was reduced NET levels in the lipid raft fractions suggesting that cholesterol-rich lipid rafts mediate PKC-triggered NET internalization. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation studies revealed that NET phosphorylation is stimulated severalfold by PKC activation and protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibition. Together, these findings demonstrate for the first time that in trophoblasts (i) PKC activation regulates NET function and surface expression by an enhanced internalization process that is lipid raft-mediated and (ii) PKC and protein phosphatase(s) modulation regulates NET phosphorylation.

Discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed NET in the lipid raft fractions. Following β-PMA treatment, there was reduced NET levels in the lipid raft fractions suggesting that cholesterol-rich lipid rafts mediate PKC-triggered NET internalization. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation studies revealed that NET phosphorylation is stimulated severalfold by PKC activation and protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibition. Together, these findings demonstrate for the first time that in trophoblasts (i) PKC activation regulates NET function and surface expression by an enhanced internalization process that is lipid raft-mediated and (ii) PKC and protein phosphatase(s) modulation regulates NET phosphorylation.

Kopin I.J. Prog. Brain Res. 1969; 31: 21-32Google Scholar, 2Iversen L.L. Iversen I. Handbook of Psychopharmacology. 3rd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1978: 381-442Google Scholar). NET is also an important target for various antidepressants and psychostimulants (3Pacholczyk T. Blakely R.D. Amara S.G. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Google Scholar). Functional silencing of NET through genetic manipulations results in altered behavior when animals are stressed or challenged pharmacologically (hypersensitivity to psychostimulants and opiates) (4Bohn L.M. Xu F. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 9040-9045Google Scholar, 5Xu F. Gainetdinov R.R. Wetsel W.C. Jones S.R. Bohn L.M. Miller G.W. Wang Y.M. Caron M.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 465-471Google Scholar). NE uptake sites and NET activity are also compromised in cardiovascular diseases and brain disorders (6Esler M. Jackman G. Bobik A. Leonard P. Kelleher D. Skews H. Jennings G. Korner P. Hypertension. 1981; 3: 149-156Google Scholar, 7Ganguly P.K. Dhalla K.S. Innes I.R. Beamish R.E. Dhall N.S. Circ. Res. 1986; 59: 684-693Google Scholar, 8Klimek V. Stockmeier C. Overholser J. Meltzer H.Y. Kalka S. Dilley G. Ordway G.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8451-8458Google Scholar). A point mutation in NET (A457P in exon 9 of the NET gene) has been shown to be associated with orthostatic intolerance (9Shannon J.R. Flattem N.L. Jordan J. Jacob G. Black B.K. Biaggioni I. Blakely R.D. Robertson D. N. Engl. Med. 2000; 342: 541-549Google Scholar), whereas another study shows the absence of this specific mutation in all the orthostatic intolerance patients examined (10Ivancsits S. Heider A. Rudiger H.W. Winker R. Am. J. Med. Sci. 2003; 325: 63-65Google Scholar). The A457P mutation disrupts surface expression of mutant and wild type NETs when coexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (11Hahn M.A. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4470-4478Google Scholar). Diverse stimuli, including neuronal activity, peptide hormones, and second messengers elevated after receptor activation, regulate NET. For example, activation of PKC down-regulates the activity of NET and results in redistribution of NET from the plasma membrane (12Apparsundaram S. Galli A. DeFelice L.J. Hartzell H.C. Blakely R.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 733-743Google Scholar, 13Apparsundaram S. Schroeter S. Blakely R.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 744-751Google Scholar). Activation of PKC leads to a reduction in amine transport capacity, revealed by a change in maximal transport with little or no change in substrate affinity (12Apparsundaram S. Galli A. DeFelice L.J. Hartzell H.C. Blakely R.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 733-743Google Scholar, 13Apparsundaram S. Schroeter S. Blakely R.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 744-751Google Scholar, 14Qian Y. Galli A. Ramamoorthy S. Risso S. DeFelice L.J. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 45-57Google Scholar). Similarly, inhibition of protein phosphatase 1/2A (PP1/PP2A) reduces amine transport activity, and stimulates transporter phosphorylation (15Ramamoorthy S. Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. 2nd Ed. Humana Press Inc, Totowa, NJ2002: 1-23Google Scholar). PP2Ac exists in physical complexes containing biogenic amine transporters including NET (16Bauman A.L. Apparsundaram S. Ramamoorthy S. Wadzinski B.E. Vaughan R.A. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7571-7578Google Scholar). NET bears multiple consensus sites for PKC phosphorylation on putative cytoplasmic domains (3Pacholczyk T. Blakely R.D. Amara S.G. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Google Scholar). Determinants within the C-terminal region of NET dictate NET trafficking, stability, and activity (17Bauman P.A. Blakely R.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 404: 80-91Google Scholar). Although membrane trafficking is implicated in PKC-mediated regulation of NET proteins, it is not yet known whether NET cell surface losses are due to increased internalization (endocytosis) or decreased recycling. It is also not known whether NET undergoes regulated phosphorylation. Although dynamin-dependent clathrin-mediated internalization is involved in the regulation of DAT and GAT1 trafficking (18Daniels G. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35794Google Scholar, 19Saunders C. Ferrer J.V. Shi L. Chen J. Merrill G. Lamb M.E. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Carvelli L. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6850-6855Google Scholar, 20Deken S.L. Wang D. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1563-1568Google Scholar), such a mechanism is not known for NET. Certain endocytic pathways utilize glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane proteins (lipid rafts) and caveolae to concentrate and internalize molecules such as folate (21Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Google Scholar). The association of multiple signaling molecules with caveolae and lipid rafts suggests their role in coordinating signal transductions with internalization of molecules (22Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Google Scholar). Human placenta expresses both SERT and NET (23Ramamoorthy S. Prasad P.D. Kulanthaivel P. Leibach F.H. Blakely R.D. Ganapathy V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1346-1353Google Scholar, 24Ramamoorthy J.D. Ramamoorthy S. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1995; 173: 1782-1787Google Scholar, 25Jayanthi L.D. Prasad P.D. Ramamoorthy S. Mahesh V.B. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12178-12185Google Scholar), and we have recently developed trophoblast cultures from the rat placenta that robustly express endogenous NET (26Jayanthi L.D. Vargas G. DeFelice L.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 1927-1934Google Scholar). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the β-PMA-induced down-regulation of NET in trophoblasts occurs by an enhanced internalization process and that this internalization is dynamin-dependent. Our results demonstrate that in trophoblasts, PKC activation enhances NET internalization and that the internalization occurs in a calcium- and clathrin (dynamin)-independent manner. Surprisingly, cholesterol-disrupting agents prevented the β-PMA-induced NET internalization. In addition, we show that NET protein is present in lipid raft fractions and demonstrate that NETs internalize via lipid rafts following β-PMA treatment. Finally we provide evidence that PKC and PP1/PP2A regulate the phosphorylation of native NETs. These findings suggest that NET function in the trophoblast is regulated by endogenous kinases and phosphatases, and the regulation of NET may play a role in placental control of amine entry or exit in order to cope with the fetal demands, such as fetal growth, and the maternal insults, such as drug abuse by the pregnant mother. β- and α-PMA were from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Rat NET polyclonal antibody was raised against the peptide WERVAYGITPENEHHLVAQRDVR, amino acids 535-557 of rNET supplied by the commercial vendor, Invitrogen. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to dynamin 1, dynamin 2, caveolin 1, and PKCα were from BD Biosciences. Mouse monoclonal antibody to PKCϵ was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody was from Roche Applied Science. Polyclonal anti-GFP and anti-Myc antibodies were from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Mouse anti-TfR antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). All other chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Placentas were isolated from pregnant rats at gestation day 17, and trophoblasts were isolated as described earlier (26Jayanthi L.D. Vargas G. DeFelice L.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 1927-1934Google Scholar). All animal procedures were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Placental tissue was minced and digested with 0.1% w/v collagenase plus 0.002% w/v DNase in 10 ml of M199 medium containing Hanks' salts. Tissue was dispersed in 1× Ca2+- and Mg2+- free Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.1% BSA followed by filtration through 4 layers of 150-μm nylon cloth. Trophoblasts were isolated by discontinuous Percoll gradient (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ) (10-70%) centrifugation and cultured in a mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine and penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells seeded in 24-well cell culture plates (100,000 cells/well) or 35-mm dishes or 6-well plates (500,000 cells/dish or well) were allowed to grow in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 and used for the experiments. Trophoblasts grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA) in PBS/Ca-Mg (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2) for 15 min at room temperature (RT), rinsed with PBS/Ca-Mg, and quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS/Ca-Mg. The cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at RT and blocked with 2% BSA in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS/Ca-Mg. Trophoblasts were incubated with the primary antibody (polyclonal anti-rNET, raised against rNET sequence (WERVAYGITPENEHHLVAQRDVR) in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% BSA for 1 h at RT. After washing the cells three times with PBS/Ca-Mg, 1:1000 dilution of the secondary antibody (Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc, West Grove, PA) in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% BSA was added and incubated for 1 h at RT. The cells were washed as before with PBS, mounted on glass slides in Aqua-Poly/Mount (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA), and examined using a Zeiss Axiovert 135 confocal microscope. Trophoblasts were treated with the vehicle or β-PMA (0.5 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Other treatments with various reagents were performed as described in appropriate places. Uptake measurements were performed by incubating the trophoblasts for 10 min at 37 °C, with [3H]NE (35.0 Ci/mmol l-[7,8-3H]norepinephrine, Amersham Biosciences) in 0.5 ml of Krebs-Ringer/HEPES (KRH) buffer, pH 7.4 (120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm Tris, and 10 mmd-glucose), containing 100 μm ascorbic acid and 100 μm pargyline. Assays were terminated by removing the radiolabel and by rapid washings of cells three times with 1 ml of ice-cold KRH buffer. Cells were solubilized in 0.5 ml of 1% SDS, and the accumulated [3H]NE was quantified by liquid scintillation counting (Beckman Coulter Inc., CA). 50 nm of [3H]NE was used in all experiments except for kinetic studies, where uptake of NE was measured over a concentration of 0.1 to 10 μm NE with 50 nm of [3H]NE and the rest substituting with nonradioactive NE. Specific NE uptake was measured by subtracting the NE uptake measured in the presence of 1 μm desipramine (DS) from the total NE uptake measured in the absence of DS. For kinetic analysis of NE uptake in trophoblasts, the values were plotted as picomoles of NE uptake versus concentration of NE, and the data represent the mean ± S.E. from three experiments performed in triplicate on different batches of trophoblast cultures. Substrate Km and Vmax values for NE uptake were determined by nonlinear least square fits (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software, Reading, PA) with the generalized Michaelis-Menten equation: V=Vmax[S]n/(Kmn+[S]n), where V = transport velocity, [S] = substrate (NE) concentration, and n represents the Hill coefficient. Nisoxetine Binding—To estimate the change in cell surface density of NET in placental trophoblasts, binding of [3H]nisoxetine (86.0 Ci/mmol [N-methyl-3H]nisoxetine, Amersham Biosciences), a specific radioligand for NET, was measured using both intact trophoblasts and isolated membrane fractions. Trophoblasts were treated with the vehicle or β-PMA as described under “Treatments and NE Uptake Assays,” washed with ice-cold binding buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, 120 mm NaCl and 5 mm KCl, pH 7.4 containing 0.32 m sucrose), and incubated with increasing concentrations (0.1-5 nm) of [3H]nisoxetine in binding buffer on ice for 2 h (saturates by 2 h). At the end of the incubations, the cells were washed, lysed, and measured for radioactivity. For [3H]nisoxetine binding in membranes, trophoblast cultures in 35-mm dishes were treated with the vehicle or β-PMA as described under uptake assays, and the cells were collected in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Pelleted cells were resuspended in ice-cold binding buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, 120 mm NaCl, and 5 mm KCl, pH 7.4) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μm each of pepstatin and iodoacetamide, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g. The resulting pellet was homogenized in 4 ml of binding buffer with a Polytron (Brinkmann Instruments) at 25,000 rpm for 5 s, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet (membrane fraction) was resuspended in ice-cold binding buffer, and membrane protein was estimated by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Membranes (50 μg of protein) were incubated with increasing concentrations (0.1-5nm)of[3H]nisoxetine for 2 h (saturates by 2 h)at 4 °C and collected (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD) on GF/B glass filters (Whatman, Clifton, NJ) presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine. Filters were washed, and bound radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding, defined as the binding in the presence of 10 μm DS, was subtracted from total binding to obtain specific binding to whole cells as well as to membranes. Scatchard analysis was used to estimate ligand Kd and binding site density (Bmax). Surface Biotinylation—Although nisoxetine has been used as a NET ligand for binding studies to quantify cell surface NET density (12Apparsundaram S. Galli A. DeFelice L.J. Hartzell H.C. Blakely R.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 733-743Google Scholar, 27Kitayama S. Ikeda T. Mitsuhata C. Sato T. Morita K. Dohi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10731-10736Google Scholar), nisoxetine may enter the cell even at 4 °C. Cell surface biotinylation and immunoblot analyses were employed (28Melikian H.E. Ramamoorthy S. Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 266-276Google Scholar) to quantify more accurately the amount of NET protein distributed between cell surface and intracellular pools. Trophoblasts subjected to various treatments were washed and incubated with the cell membrane-impermeable reagent, sulfo-NHS-biotin (1.5 mg/ml, Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C in PBS/Ca-Mg (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 9.6 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3). The biotinylating agent was removed by incubating twice with 100 mm glycine for 30 min. Cells were washed with PBS/Ca-Mg and lysed at 4 °C with 400 μl of RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated with monomeric avidin beads for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer, and adsorbed proteins were eluted in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). An aliquot (40 μl) of total cell lysate from each sample and all (50 μl) of the avidin-bound samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with NET-specific antibody. To visualize intracellular NET, proteins from unbound fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and equal amounts of protein were analyzed by immunoblotting with NET antibody. To validate the surface localization of biotinylated NET protein, blots were stripped and reprobed with anticalnexin antibody (1:1000, Stressgen Biotechnologies, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Band intensities were quantified using NIH Image (version 1.62). Exposures were precalibrated to ensure quantitation within the linear range of the film, and multiple exposures were taken to validate linearity of quantitation. Values of total, nonbiotinylated, and surface NET proteins were normalized using levels of calnexin immunoreactivity in total cell extract, and values were averaged across three experiments. In one set, trophoblasts were treated with the membrane-permeant Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (10 μm) in Ca2+-free KRH buffer for 2 h at 37 °C to deplete both external and internal Ca2+ (29Apparsundaram S. Sung U. Price R.D. Blakely R.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 666-677Google Scholar). After BAPTA-AM treatment, β-PMA (0.5 μm final concentration) or the vehicle was added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the continued presence of BAPTA-AM. In another set, trophoblasts were incubated at 37 °C with 0.001% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (vehicle for BAPTA-AM) in Ca2+ (2.2 mm) containing KRH buffer for 2 h. After the treatment, β-PMA (0.5 μm final concentration) or the vehicle was added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for another 30 min. Following treatments, uptake assays and biotinylation experiments were performed as described above. Reversible biotinylation was performed as described (30Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Google Scholar). Trophoblasts were cooled rapidly to 4 °C to inhibit endocytosis by washing with cold PBS and surface-biotinylated with a disulfide-cleavable biotin (sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin; Pierce), and free biotinylating reagent was removed by quenching with glycine. NET endocytosis was initiated by incubating the cells with prewarmed media containing β-PMA or the vehicle for indicated times at 37 °C. At the end of each time point, the reagents were removed, and fresh pre-chilled media were added to stop the endocytosis. The cells were then washed and incubated twice with 250 μm sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MesNa), a reducing agent in PBS/Ca-Mg for 20 min to dissociate the biotin from cell surface-resident proteins via disulfide exchange. To define total biotinylated NETs, one dish of biotinylated trophoblasts was not subjected to reduction with MesNa and directly processed for extraction followed by isolation by avidin beads. To define MesNa-accessible NETs, another dish of cells was treated with MesNa immediately (at 0 time) following biotinylation at 4 °C to reveal the quantity of surface NET biotinylation that MesNa can reverse efficiently. At the end of the treatments, trophoblasts were solubilized in RIPA, and biotinylated NETs were separated from nonbiotinylated proteins by using monomeric avidin beads. Biotinylated proteins were eluted from beads and resolved by SDS-PAGE. NET proteins in the fractions were visualized with NET-specific antibody as described under “Surface Biotinylation.” NET bands were scanned, and the band densities were quantified by NIH Image 1.62 software (National Institutes of Health). Trophoblasts were subjected to various conditions that inhibit endocytosis mediated by either dynamin (clathrin-coated pits) (30Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Google Scholar) or caveolae/lipid rafts (31Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Pinney E. Allard J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1217-1232Google Scholar, 32Carozzi A.J. Roy S. Morrow I.C. Pol A. Wyse B. Clyde-Smith J. Prior I.A. Nixon S.J. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17944-17949Google Scholar). Trophoblasts were incubated with cycloheximide (30 μg/ml) for 30 min prior to treatment with β-PMA to prevent the confounding effects of protein synthesis (18Daniels G. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35794Google Scholar). Procedures to inhibit endocytosis were also performed for 30 min prior to experimentation coincident with cycloheximide treatment. The reagents and conditions to block clathrin-mediated endocytosis are as follows: (i) Control buffer, KRH buffer; (ii) K+ depletion, trophoblasts were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min in hypotonic shock solution (serum-free DMEM and distilled water in 1:1 ratio) and then rinsed and incubated with K+ depletion buffer (50 mm HEPES; 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4; 1 mm CaCl2;1mm MgCl2); (iii) Hypertonic medium, 0.5 m sucrose in KRH buffer; (iv) chemical inhibition by (a) concanavalin A (ConA) (250 μg/ml) and (b) monodansyl cadaverine (MDC) (50 μm). The reagents and conditions to block caveolae/lipid raft-mediated endocytosis are as follows: (i) filipin (5 μg/ml) and (ii) nystatin (5 μg/ml) in KRH assay buffer. Treatments with appropriate vehicles were carried out for controls. Following the treatments, trophoblasts were treated with vehicle or β-PMA as described before and used for NE uptake measurement and biotinylation studies as described above. Because trophoblasts also express Na+/Cl--dependent taurine transporters, and PKC activation down-regulates the taurine transporter, 2L. D. Jayanthi, D. J. Samuvel, and S. Ramamoorthy, unpublished observations. the effect of these manipulations on β-PMA-mediated inhibition of taurine transport was examined. In addition, following filipin treatment, β-PMA induced translocation of PKC isoforms (α and ϵ) was measured as described by Karl and Divald (33Karl P.I. Divald A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 831-836Google Scholar) to determine whether PKC signaling pathways remain intact in response to cholesterol-depleting agents. Trophoblasts were tested for the endogenous expression of dynamin 1, dynamin 2, and caveolin 1 by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies to dynamin 1, dynamin 2, and caveolin 1, respectively. Trophoblasts were transiently transfected with K44A mutant cDNAs of dynamin 1 (HA-tagged) (34van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Google Scholar) or dynamin 2 (GFP-tagged) (35Jones S.M. Howell K.E. Henley J.R. Cao H. McNiven M.A. Science. 1998; 279: 573-577Google Scholar), or Myc-tagged S80E mutant cDNA of caveolin 1 (36Shigematsu S. Watson R.T. Khan A.H. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10683-10690Google Scholar), or HA-tagged DGV mutant cDNA of caveolin 3 (32Carozzi A.J. Roy S. Morrow I.C. Pol A. Wyse B. Clyde-Smith J. Prior I.A. Nixon S.J. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17944-17949Google Scholar), or empty vectors (control) using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Bioscience), and cultures were maintained for 48 h prior to experimentation (0.25 μg/well in 24-well plates or 1 μg/well in 6-well plates). Cells grown in 24-well plates were used for NE uptake measurements, and cells grown in 6-well plates were used for biotinylation experiments to assess the ability of these mutants to block β-PMA-mediated NET endocytosis. To determine whether dominant negative dynamin mutants impaired clathrin-mediated endocytosis, TfR internalization was assessed by surface biotinylation experiments using trophoblasts transfected with vector alone or K44A dynamin 1 mutant. To determine whether dominant negative mutants of caveolin impaired caveolin-dependent endocytosis, cholera toxin B (CTXB) internalization was assessed. Trophoblasts transfected with vector alone, S80E caveolin 1, or DGV caveolin 3 were incubated at 4 °C with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated CTXB (4 μg/ml PBS/Ca-Mg) for 45 min. Unbound CTXB was removed by washing with cold PBS/Ca-Mg. Internalization of bound CTXB was carried out by incubating the cells in PBS/Ca-Mg at 37 °C for 2.5 h. Following the incubation, biotinylation experiments were performed on the trophoblasts as described under “Surface Biotinylation.” Equal amounts (150 μg) of protein from total lysates, all (50 μl) of the avidin-bound samples, and equal amounts (300 μl concentrated to 150 μl) of unbound fractions were dotted on a nitrocellulose membrane and developed with ECL reagents (37Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6324-6331Google Scholar). Dot blots were scanned, and the dot densities were quantified by NIH Image 1.62 software (National Institutes of Health). Lipid rafts were isolated from vehicle or β-PMA-treated trophoblasts using the protocol described earlier (38Becher A. White J.H. McIlhinney R.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 787-795Google Scholar) with few modifications. Trophoblasts were lysed in 1.5 ml of MBS (25 mm MES and 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5) containing 1% Triton X-100 and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 μm pepstatin A, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) by using Dounce homogenizer with 10 up and down strokes at 4 °C. Equal volumes of 80% (w/v) sucrose in MBS were added to the homogenates. Cell lysates in 40% sucrose were placed at the bottom of SW41 centrifuge tubes and overlaid successively with 4 ml of 30% sucrose and 3 ml of 5% sucrose.

We cross-correlated seismograms from approximately 14,000 earthquakes and explosions and measured relative arrival times to approximately 0.01 second, enabling lateral location precision of about 100 to 300 meters. Such precision is important for seismic hazard studies, earthquake physics, and nuclear test ban verification. Recognition and measurement of repeating signals in archived data and the resulting improvement in location specificity quantifies the inaccuracy of current procedures for picking onset times and locating events."
https://openalex.org/W2014594220,"To achieve X-chromosome dosage compensation, organisms must distinguish X chromosomes from autosomes. We identified multiple, cis-acting regions that recruit the Caenorhabditis elegans dosage compensation complex (DCC) through a search for regions of X that bind the complex when detached from X. The DCC normally assembles along the entire X chromosome, but not all detached regions recruit the complex, despite having genes known to be dosage compensated on the native X. Thus, the DCC binds first to recruitment sites, then spreads to neighboring X regions to accomplish chromosome-wide gene repression. From a large chromosomal domain, we defined a 793–base pair fragment that functions in vivo as an X-recognition element to recruit the DCC."
https://openalex.org/W2142551442,"The presence of multiple muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes in the heart and lung, combined with the lack of mAChR subtype-selective ligands, have complicated the task of identifying the mAChR subtypes mediating cardiac slowing (bradycardia) and airway narrowing (bronchoconstriction) due to vagal innervation. To determine which of the five mAChRs are responsible for the cholinergic control of heart rate and airway caliber in vivo, we performed experiments on mutant mice lacking the two prime candidates for such control, the M2 or M3 mAChR. Here, we report that in vivo, bradycardia caused by vagal stimulation or administration of the muscarinic agonist methacholine (MCh) was abolished in mice lacking functional M2 mAChRs (M2-/- mice). In contrast, heart rate responses remained unchanged in M3 receptor-deficient mice (M3-/- mice). The reduced hypotensive response of M3-/- mice to MCh suggests M3 mAChRs contribute to peripheral vasodilation. The M2-/- mice showed significantly enhanced in vivo bronchoconstrictor responses to vagal stimulation or MCh administration. In contrast, bronchoconstrictor responses were totally abolished in M3-/- mice. Because altered cardiac or pulmonary vagal tone is involved in a number of pathophysiological conditions, including cardiac arrhythmias, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, these results should be of considerable therapeutic relevance."

Developmental Biology. 6th Ed. Sinauer Asociates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2000: 152-153Google Scholar). There are three mammalian TGF-β isoforms, with TGF-β1 being the most abundant in tissues (2Ashcroft G.S. Microb. Infect. 1999; 1: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).

Upon binding to ligands, TβRII transphosphorylates TβRI and TβRIII (betaglycan), propagating downstream signaling. Betaglycan is a “part-time” cell surface proteoglycan that binds TGF-β and transfers TGF-β to TβRII. Its core protein binds TGF-β, and its GAG chains are not needed (10Segarini P.R. Seyedin S.M. J.

Indeed, GAG modification of betaglycan may inhibit TGF-β signaling (13Eickelberg O. Centrella M. Reiss M. Kashgarian M. Wells R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of betaglycan is essential for downstream signaling (8Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P.

It associates with autophosphorylated TβRII and promotes the formation of the TβRI·TβRII complex. Following phosphorylation by TβRII, betaglycan dissociates from the active TβRI·TβRII complex. The cytoplasmic domain of betaglycan contains a PDZ (post-synaptic density-95, disks large, zonula occludens-1)-domain binding motif, whose interaction with the PDZ-domain containing protein GIPC (GAIP-interacting protein, C terminus) leads to increased betaglycan expression (9Blobe G.C.

They have divergent ectodomains and highly homologous transmembrane domains, and their cytoplasmic domains have two regions of homology (C1 and C2) flanking V regions unique to each syndecan. S2 interacts with matrix proteins such as laminin (19Utani A. Nomizu M. Matsuura H. Kato K. Kobayashi T. Takeda U. Aota S. Nielsen P.K. Shinkai H. J. Biol.

The V region of S2 also controls left-right asymmetry during Xenopus development through the actions of TGF-β family members (23Kramer K.L. Yost H.J. Dev.

Interestingly, S2 has similar motifs to betaglycan (Fig. 1) including the GAG attachment sites, a possible serine phosphorylation site (Ser-ser-ala-ala; SSAA) and a C-terminal PDZ-domain binding motif that binds GIPC. Since both fibrosis and determination of left-right asymmetry involve TGF-β family members (5Ihn H. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2002; 14: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 23Kramer K.L.

RNAzol™ B was from Leedo Medical Laboratories (Houston, TX). pcDNA3 vector was obtained from Invitrogen. Antibodies against S2 (T-17), TβRI (V-22), TβRII (L-21), TβRIII (C-20), and donkey anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Protein-G-Sepharose, blocking agent for detection of biotinylated proteins, and streptavidin-HRP were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragments of goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Cappel (Durham, NC). Heparitinase I (EC 4.2.2.8) and chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4) were from Seikagaku America (Falmouth, MA). UltraLink immobilized streptavidin gel and NHS-Sulfo-Biotin were from Pierce. Immunohistochemical Analysis of S2 Expression in Renal Sections— Frozen sections from control and diabetic type II patients were incubated with anti-S2 or anti-S4 (45 min, 37 °C), washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (3 × 15 min), incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse (45 min, 37 °C), washed with PBS (3 × 15 min), and photographed using a Nikon Optiphot microscope. Equivalent exposure, development, and scanning procedures were used for digital images. Northern and Immunoblotting Analyses of Syndecan-2 Expression— Renal papillary fibroblasts (RPF) cells were cultured in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 50% Ham's F-12 with 5% fetal bovine serum. Subconfluent cultures were serum-starved (7 h) and treated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) with retreatment at 24 h. Total RNA was isolated with RNAzol™ B, and 30 μg were used for Northern analysis (14Chen L. Couchman J.R. Smith J. Woods A. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 481-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using the partial transmembrane domain plus the cytoplasmic domain of rat S2 as the 5′-end-labeled probe. For immunoblotting, cells were lysed into SDS sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (10% (w/v)) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated with goat anti-S2 (1:1000) followed by donkey anti-goat IgG-HRP (1:1000), and antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Analysis of Fibronectin Matrix Deposition—Cells were treated with TGF-β1 as above for 48 h, fixed, and stained with anti-fibronectin, followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:50). Levels of matrix deposition were semiquantified using camera exposure time. Cell Surface Binding of TGF-β—Confluent 6-well plate cultures were incubated (27Gebken J. Feydt A. Brinckmann J. Notbohm H. Müller P.K. Bätge B. J. Endocrin. 1999; 161: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with 400 pm biotinylated TGF-β1 + 100-fold unlabeled TGF-β1. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with 5 milliunits of heparitinase I (37 °C, 2 h), with repeated enzyme addition at 1 h. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (15% (w/v)), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked (5% blocking agent in PBS-0.1% Tween), and bound biotinylated TGF-β1 was visualized by incubation with streptavidin-HRP (1:1000) followed by ECL. Binding Assays—Recombinant S2 ectodomain was prepared as described previously (14Chen L. Couchman J.R. Smith J. Woods A. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 481-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RPF (T-75 flask) were treated with heparitinase and chondroitinase as described previously (14Chen L. Couchman J.R. Smith J. Woods A. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 481-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by addition of 12 ml of lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide). Streptavidin gel (20 μl) was washed twice with 1 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100 in lysis buffer and incubated with biotinylated TGF-β1 (250 ng, 4 °C, 1 h). Following three washes with 1 ml of lysis buffer, S2 ectodomain (0.5 μg) or RPF cell lysate was incubated with the gel (4 °C, 2 h). Gels were washed three times, and bound material was eluted with SDS sample buffer (30 μl), resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% (w/v)), and detected by R1891 (1:2000), followed by goat anti-rabbit-HRP (1:2000) and ECL. Immunoblotting of TβRI, TβRII, and TβRIII—For immunoblotting of TβRI and TβRII, confluent cultures were lysed into SDS sample buffer. For immunoblotting of TβRIII, the GAG chains were removed as described previously (14Chen L. Couchman J.R. Smith J. Woods A. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 481-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, 10% (w/v) for TβRI and TβRII, 3–10% (w/v) for TβRIII, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Receptors were visualized by blotting with anti-TβRI (1:1000 in 0.1% Tween, 0.1% BSA, 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 2 h), TβRII (1:1000 in the same buffer as for TβRI for 1h), or TβRIII (1:1000 in PBS for 1.5 h), followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:2000 in 0.1% Tween, 0.1% BSA, 1% nonfat milk in TBS for 1 h) or donkey anti-goat IgG-HRP (1:1000 in 0.1% Tween, 0.1% BSA, 1% nonfat milk in PBS for 1 h) and ECL. Cell Surface Biotinylation and Immunoprecipitation—Confluent cultures (T-75 flask) were washed with cold PBS three times, incubated with NHS-Sulfo-Biotin (2.5 mg) in PBS (5 ml, 30 min, 4 °C), washed with cold PBS three times, and scraped into lysis buffer (5 ml). The cell number of parallel cultures was used to confirm equal loading. After centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was incubated (1 h, 4 °C) with protein-G-Sepharose beads preblocked with 5% fetal bovine serum. Beads were removed by centrifugation (400 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant incubated with fresh preblocked beads and 5 μg/ml antibody (2 h, 4 °C). Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, three times with PBS, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling with SDS sample buffer (5 min), subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blotted with streptavidin-HRP and ECL. Membranes were stripped and blotted with antibodies against S2. When renal sections from age-matched controls (Fig. 2A, left panel) were compared with those from type II diabetic patients (Fig. 2A, second panel), S2 was increased in the tubulointerstitium. In contrast, despite some increase in the glomerulus, syndecan-4 (right two panels) was not dramatically increased in the tubulointerstitium. Similar results were obtained with streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (data not shown). TGF-β increases S2 expression in several cell types (28Worapamorn W. Haase H.R. Li H. Bartold P.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 186: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Sebestyen A. Gallai M. Knittel T. Ambrust T. Ramadori G. Kovalszky I. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 1557-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We, therefore, tested whether the increase in S2 was due to TGF-β, a known mediator of fibrosis (5Ihn H. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2002; 14: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, S2 mRNA or protein levels were not increased (Fig. 2B and data not shown) in RPF cells treated with TGF-β at concentrations sufficient to increase fibronectin matrix in these (Fig. 2C) and other cells (30Kaji T. Yamada A. Miyajima S. Yamamoto C. Fujiwara Y. Wight T.N. Kinsella M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1463-1470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 31Van Osch G.J. van der Veen S.W. Buma P. Verwoerd-Verhoef H.L.

We then tested whether S2 can mediate TGF-β-induced increased matrix deposition. Immunofluorescent labeling indicated that overexpression of S2 in RPF increased fibronectin matrix deposition with more fibrils/cell and larger fibrils (arrows) than in cells transfected with vector only (Fig. 2C). This difference was not statistically significant in a semiquantitative assay using exposure time. Construct expression levels vary among cells, although immunoblotting (data not shown) indicated transfection with S2 or S2ΔS increased S2 levels 2.5-fold overall. In contrast, expression of S2ΔS decreased basal fibronectin deposition (Fig. 2C), compared with cells transfected with vector only (102 ± 11 versus 76 ± 6.0, p < 0.001), and several cells (arrowheads) lacked fibrils. This suggests that S2 cytoplasmic domain regulates matrix deposition in RPF cells, as it does in CHO-K1 cells (21Klass C.M. Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 493-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Differences in matrix deposition were exaggerated after TGF-β treatment. The percentage decrease of exposure time after TGF-β treatment parallels increased matrix deposition. Treatment of vector-only transfected cells with TGF-β (Fig. 2C) increased matrix deposition (18% ± 9.7% decrease in exposure time). Increased matrix deposition in S2 cells was exaggerated (21% ± 7.0%), but S2ΔS cells showed (Fig. 2C) less increase (14% ± 9.1%). These results suggest that S2 regulates TGF-β-mediated matrix increase. Transfection of cells with either S2 or S2ΔS increased surface binding of TGF-β over that to cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 3, A and B). Cleavage of HS chains reduced TGF-β binding (Fig. 3B), suggesting that some binding is through HS chains. Surprisingly, recombinant S2 ectodomain bound biotinylated TGF-β1, and TGF-β1 could capture S2 from RPF cell lysates (Fig. 3, C and D). Thus, the core protein of both S2 and S2ΔS binds TGF-β, and binding is independent of the cytoplasmic domain. Immunoblotting of total cell lysates demonstrated that S2ΔS slightly, and S2 dramatically, increased protein levels of TβRI and TβRII (Fig. 4, A, B, D, and E). The expression of TβRIII, betaglycan, was increased in S2ΔS cells but decreased in S2 cells (Fig. 4, C and F). When cell surface receptor levels were monitored by biotinylation followed by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5, A–C), these were consistent with the total levels. In Fig. 5C, the lowest species is coprecipitated S2, as confirmed in Fig. 5D.Fig. 5Cell surface TGF-β receptor levels and association with syndecan-2.A–C, cell surface biotinylation, immunoprecipitation of TβRI (A), TβRII (B), or TβRIII (C), followed by streptavidin-HRP. D, the membrane in C was stripped and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-S2. E is a repeat of C with increased loading and longer time exposure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The regulation of the expression of TGF-β receptors by S2 may be through formation of a complex between S2 and the receptor(s). Syndecan-2 was not detected in TβRI or TβRII immunoprecipitates (data not shown) but was detected in TβRIII immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5D). Although S2ΔS cells expressed the highest levels of betaglycan (Fig. 4C), less S2 coprecipitated with betaglycan from S2ΔS cells than from vector-only transfected cells, and that detected may be endogenous full-length S2. Thus, the cytoplasmic domain of S2 may be needed for association with betaglycan. Low amounts of coprecipitated S2 were detected from S2 cells, probably due to the decreased level of betaglycan in S2 cells (Fig. 4C). To confirm differential association of betaglycan with S2ΔS and S2, further coprecipitation experiments were performed with increased loading on SDS-PAGE and longer time exposure on the film (Fig. 5E). Syndecans can act as co-receptors for growth factors (16Clasper S. Vekemans S. Fiore M. Plebanski M. Wordsworth P. David G. Jackson D.G. J. Biol.

Here, for the first time, we report that S2 can bind and regulate the signaling of TGF-β, and the binding is through the core protein of the ectodomain, with the HS GAGs having only a minor role. The binding is independent of the cytoplasmic domain. However, the cytoplasmic domain of S2 is crucial in the regulation of TGF-β receptor levels and in association of S2 with betaglycan. Total and surface levels of TβRI and TβRII were dramatically increased by S2 but not by S2ΔS. The cell surface level of receptors is balanced by rates of synthesis, cleavage, and internalization-dependent down-regulation and recycling. There are conflicting reports whether TGF-β up- or down-regulates its receptor expression (27Gebken J. Feydt A. Brinckmann J. Notbohm H. Müller P.K. Bätge B. J. Endocrin. 1999; 161: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34Kleeff J. Korc M. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 1999; 252: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Additionally, other S2 ligands, such as FGF2 and GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), can up-regulate the expression of TβRI and TβRII (37de Iongh R.U. Gordon-Thomson C. Chamberlain C.G. Hales A.M. McAvoy J.W. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 72: 649-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 38Ripley D. Tang X.M. Ma C. Chegini N. Gynecol. Oncol. 2001; 81: 301-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). S2 and S2ΔS may differentially regulate cell surface degradation of TGF-β receptors; TβRIII can be cleaved at the cell surface (39Philip A. Hannah R. O'Connor-McCourt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 618-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), although cleavage of TβRI and TβRII was not detected (35Koli K.M. Arteaga C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6423-6427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Finally, S2 and S2ΔS may differentially regulate endocytosis-dependent degradation and recycling of TGF-β receptors. The distinct effects of S2 and S2ΔS on betaglycan levels are intriguing. Effects on betaglycan (increased by S2ΔS but not by S2) may be explained by similarities between S2 and betaglycan cytoplasmic domains. Both contain a PDZ-domain binding motif (Fig. 1) that binds GIPC (9Blobe G.C. Liu X. Fang S.J. How T. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39608-39617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 40Gao L.H. Lim M. Chen W. Simons M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). GIPC binding up-regulates betaglycan levels on the cell surface by preventing proteosome degradation (9Blobe G.C. Liu X. Fang S.J. How T. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39608-39617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). If S2 competes for GIPC binding, less GIPC will be available for betaglycan in S2 cells but more in S2ΔS cells. All three receptors may be required for efficient receptor down-regulation (36Zwaagstra J.C. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Decreased cell surface betaglycan in S2 cells may then reduce down-regulation of TβRI and TβRII. Whatever the mechanism, the finding that S2 can regulate the cell surface levels of TGF-β receptors adds a new level of complexity to TGF-β action. Despite increased TGF-β binding and betaglycan level in S2ΔS cells, TGF-β did not increase matrix deposition in S2ΔS cells, suggestive of defective downstream signaling. Both betaglycan and S2 cytoplasmic domain contain a SSAA sequence (Fig. 1). Phosphorylation of betaglycan cytoplasmic domain is needed for downstream signaling (8Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Pepin M.C. Beauchemin M. Moustakas A. Lodish H.F. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24627-24637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and, although the site has not been determined, this can be by TβRII. The SSAA sequence in S2 can be phosphorylated if not oligomerized (22Oh E.S. Couchman J.R. Woods A. Arch. Biochem. Biophysics. 1997; 344: 64-74Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation is needed for both matrix assembly2 and the regulation of left-right asymmetry in Xenopus embryos (23Kramer K.L. Yost H.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 24Kramer K.L. Barnette J.E. Yost H.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 981-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Whether S2 and betaglycan compete for the same kinase(s) is not known, but overexpression of S2 may promote oligomerization, as it does with syndecan-4 (41Echtermeyer F. Baciu P.C. Saoncella S. Ge Y. Goetinck P.F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3433-3441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and thus reduce its phosphorylation potential. Finally, we found that betaglycan coprecipitates with S2, and the cytoplasmic domain of S2 is needed for this association. Whether this is a direct interaction is now being determined. There may be two distinct signaling mechanisms, involving either S2 or betaglycan, with coprecipitation due to common binding to TGF-β. While much remains to be determined, it is clear that, as is the case with betaglycan (8Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Pepin M.C. Beauchemin M. Moustakas A. Lodish H.F. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24627-24637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), cytoplasmic domain truncation of S2 has no effect on TGF-β binding but reduces downstream effects. In summary, the data presented here demonstrate a mechanism of TGF-β regulation by syndecan-2. Since TGF-β is a major fibrogenic agent, this highlights a possible role of syndecan-2 in fibrosis.

This antiapoptotic state also lends protection against cell death induced by metabolic inhibitors like actinomycin D and cycloheximide. The identity of the viral antiapoptotic protein and the underlying mechanism are unknown. Here, we provide evidence that the coxsackievirus 2B protein modulates apoptosis by manipulating intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Using fluorescent Ca2+ indicators and organelle-targeted aequorins, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of 2B in HeLa cells decreases the Ca2+ content of both the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi, resulting in down-regulation of Ca2+ signaling between these stores and the mitochondria, and increases the influx of extracellular Ca2+. In our studies of the physiological importance of the 2B-induced alterations in Ca2+ signaling, we found that the expression of 2B suppressed caspase activation and apoptotic cell death induced by various stimuli, including actinomycin D and cycloheximide. Mutants of 2B that were defective in reducing the Ca2+ content of the stores failed to suppress apoptosis. These data implicate a functional role of the perturbation of intracellular Ca2+ compartmentalization in the enteroviral strategy to suppress intrinsic apoptotic host cell responses.

These data implicate a functional role of the perturbation of intracellular Ca2+ compartmentalization in the enteroviral strategy to suppress intrinsic apoptotic host cell responses. The putative down-regulation of an endoplasmic reticulum-dependent apoptotic pathway is discussed. Many viruses are endowed with the potential to manipulate cell death pathways in order to prevent premature abortion of the infectious cycle (1O'Brien V. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1833-1845Google Scholar, 2Hay S. Kannourakis G. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 1547-1564Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which enteroviruses manipulate the life span of their host cell is, as yet, poorly understood. Enteroviruses (coxsackievirus, poliovirus, and ECHO virus) are nonenveloped, cytolytic RNA viruses that replicate their genome at the secretory pathway-derived membrane vesicles that accumulate in the cytoplasm of the infected cell (3Bienz K. Egger D. Pfister T. Arch. Virol. Suppl. 1994; 9: 147-157Google Scholar). Classically, lytic viral replication is believed to induce canonical cellular necrosis by destruction of the plasma membrane, causing the collapse of ionic gradients. However, evidence is accumulating that the issue of how enteroviruses induce cell death is much more complex. Enterovirus infection leads to the development of the so-called cytopathic effect (CPE), 1The abbreviations used are: CPE, cytopathic effect; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; aa, amino acid(s); DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; KRB, Krebs-Ringer buffer; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; AEQ, aequorin; cyt, cytosolic; er, ER-targeted; Go, Golgi-targeted; mt, mitochondrially targeted; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; GuHCl, guanidine hydrochloride. a necrosis-like type of cell death that is characterized by rounding up of the infected cells, distortion and displacement of the nuclei, condensation of chromatin, and increased plasma membrane permeability. This type of cell death is the result of a complex interplay between apoptosis-inducing and apoptosis-suppressing functions encoded by the enterovirus genome (4Tolskaya E.A. Romanova L.I. Kolesnikova M.S. Ivannikova T.A. Smirnova E.A. Raikhlin N.T. Agol V.I. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1181-1189Google Scholar, 5Agol V.I. Belov G.A. Bienz K. Egger D. Kolesnikova M.S. Raikhlin N.T. Romanova L.I. Smirnova E.A. Tolskaya E.A. Virology. 1998; 252: 343-353Google Scholar, 6Agol V.I. Belov G.A. Bienz K. Egger D. Kolesnikova M.S. Romanova L.I. Sladkova L.V. Tolskaya E.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5534-5541Google Scholar). Early in infection, i.e. upon translation of the enterovirus RNA genome, sufficient quantities of a putative pro-apoptotic function are produced to trigger an apoptotic response. Concomitantly with the onset of viral replication, however, the implementation of the virus-induced apoptotic program is abruptly interrupted, suggesting that enteroviruses also encode an antiapoptotic function (6Agol V.I. Belov G.A. Bienz K. Egger D. Kolesnikova M.S. Romanova L.I. Sladkova L.V. Tolskaya E.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5534-5541Google Scholar). This antiapoptotic function also renders infected cells resistant against non-viral apoptotic stimuli like cycloheximide and actinomycin D (4Tolskaya E.A. Romanova L.I. Kolesnikova M.S. Ivannikova T.A. Smirnova E.A. Raikhlin N.T. Agol V.I. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1181-1189Google Scholar). The apoptosis-suppressing function dominates upon productive infection (i.e. conditions that allow efficient virus replication). Under these conditions, only at late stages (i.e. after the development of CPE) can some signs of apoptosis be detected (7McCarthy C.M. Granville D.J. Watson K.A. Anderson D.R. Wilson J.E. Yang D. Hunt D.W.C. McManus B.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7669-7675Google Scholar). Virus replication and CPE, however, are not sensitive to caspase inhibitors or the overexpression of Bcl-2 (5Agol V.I. Belov G.A. Bienz K. Egger D. Kolesnikova M.S. Raikhlin N.T. Romanova L.I. Smirnova E.A. Tolskaya E.A. Virology. 1998; 252: 343-353Google Scholar). The apoptosis-inducing function dominates upon non-permissive infection (i.e. conditions that restrict virus growth). The full-blown apoptosis that is induced under these latter conditions is efficiently suppressed by caspase inhibitors as well as by Bcl-2 overexpression (5Agol V.I. Belov G.A. Bienz K. Egger D. Kolesnikova M.S. Raikhlin N.T. Romanova L.I. Smirnova E.A. Tolskaya E.A. Virology. 1998; 252: 343-353Google Scholar). Recent studies have shed some light on the identity of the putative apoptosis-inducing enterovirus proteins. Individual expression of the viral proteinase 2Apro, which inhibits cap-dependent translation of cellular mRNAs, or the expression of 3Cpro, which shuts off host cell RNA transcription, results in apoptotic cell death (8Barco A. Feduchi E. Carrasco L. Virology. 2000; 266: 352-360Google Scholar, 9Goldstaub D. Gradi A. Bercovitch Z. Grosmann Z. Nophar Y. Luria S. Sonenberg N. Kahana C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1271-1277Google Scholar). Little is known about the identity of the apoptosis-suppressing factors. The 3A protein suppresses the extrinsic apoptotic pathway by eliminating labile receptors from the cell surface (10Neznanov N. Kondratova A. Chumakov K. Angres B. Zhumabayeva B. Agol V.I. Gudkov A.V. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10409-10420Google Scholar) through its ability to inhibit protein secretion (11Doedens J.R. Kirkegaard K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 894-907Google Scholar). The enteroviral protein that is responsible for the suppression of the intrinsic apoptotic host cell responses has not yet been identified. Ca2+ is one of the most versatile and universal signaling mediators in cells and is required for the activation of many cellular processes. Increasing evidence indicates that alterations in the finely tuned intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and compartmentalization can lead to cell death, either through apoptosis or necrosis (12Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Google Scholar). The switch from the control of physiological functions to the death program most likely involves alterations in the tightly regulated spatio-temporal Ca2+ pattern or alterations at the level of organelles (e.g. mitochondria or ER/Golgi) or effector proteins (e.g. calpain or calcineurin) that are activated by Ca2+ (13Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Google Scholar). Enteroviruses have a profound effect on intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (14Irurzun A. Arroyo J. Alvarez A. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5142-5146Google Scholar, 15van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Hoenderop J.G.J. Smeets R.L.L.M. Willems P.H.G.M. Dijkman H.B.P.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3519-3532Google Scholar). We have previously shown that infection of HeLa cells with the coxsackievirus results in a reduction of the amount of Ca2+ that can be released from the intracellular stores. In parallel, a gradual increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) is observed due to the influx of extracellular Ca2+ (15van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Hoenderop J.G.J. Smeets R.L.L.M. Willems P.H.G.M. Dijkman H.B.P.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3519-3532Google Scholar). The enterovirus 2B protein has been implicated in the virus-induced alterations in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (15van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Hoenderop J.G.J. Smeets R.L.L.M. Willems P.H.G.M. Dijkman H.B.P.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3519-3532Google Scholar, 16Aldabe R. Irurzun A. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6214-6217Google Scholar). The 2B protein is a small (97–99 aa) membrane-integral replication protein (17de Jong A.S. Wessels E. Dijkman H.B.P.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. Willems P.H.G.M. van Kuppeveld F.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1012-1021Google Scholar) that, in infected cells, is localized at the surface of the ER- and Golgi-derived membrane vesicles at which viral replication takes place (3Bienz K. Egger D. Pfister T. Arch. Virol. Suppl. 1994; 9: 147-157Google Scholar, 18Schlegel A. Giddings Jr., T.H. Ladinsky M.L. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6576-6588Google Scholar, 19Rust R.C. Landmann L. Gosert R. Tang B.L. Hong W. Hauri H.P. Egger D. Bienz K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9808-9818Google Scholar). All enterovirus 2B proteins contain two hydrophobic regions, of which one is predicted to form a cationic amphipathic α-helix (20van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Galama J.M.D. Zoll J. Melchers W.J.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7782-7790Google Scholar, 21van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Galama J.M.D. Zoll J. van den Hurk P.J.J.C. Melchers W.J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3876-3886Google Scholar). This amphipathic α-helix displays characteristics typical for the group of membrane-lytic α-helical peptides that can build membrane-integral pores by forming multimeric transmembrane bundles (22Segrest J.P. de Loof H. Dohlman J.G. Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Proteins. 1990; 8: 103-117Google Scholar, 23Shai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 55-70Google Scholar). Homomultimerization reactions of 2B have been demonstrated by yeast and mammalian two-hybrid (24Cuconati A. Xiang W. Lasher F. Pfister T. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1297-1307Google Scholar, 25de Jong A.S. Schrama I.W.J. Willems P.H.G.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. van Kuppeveld F.J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 783-793Google Scholar) and biochemical approaches (26Agirre A. Barco A. Carrasco L. Nieva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40434-40441Google Scholar) and in living cells by using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy (27van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Melchers W.J.G. Willems P.H.G.M. Gadella Jr., T.W. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9446-9456Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that 2B is responsible for the reduction of the [Ca2+] in ER and Golgi ([Ca2+]ER and [Ca2+]Golgi) by building pores in the membranes of these organelles. Direct evidence that 2B indeed causes a reduction in the [Ca2+] of the stores is, however, still lacking. In this study, we investigated Ca2+ homeostasis in 2B-expressing cells and evaluated the physiological importance of the alterations in Ca2+ signaling for the implementation or suppression of the different cell death programs. Using fluorescent Ca2+ indicators and organelle-targeted aequorins (AEQs; genetically encoded Ca2+ sensors), we demonstrate that 2B indeed reduces [Ca2+]ER and [Ca2+]Golgi in HeLa cells. We show that this leads to a decrease in the amount of Ca2+ that can be released from these stores and, as a consequence, results in the stimulus-induced rise of [Ca2+] in the mitochondria ([Ca2+]mt). Moreover, the influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium is increased, and, thus, the [Ca2+]cyt responses are larger. In our studies of the functional importance of the 2B-induced manipulation of intracellular Ca2+ signaling, we found that the expression of 2B suppressed apoptosis induced by certain stimuli, including actinomycin D and cycloheximide. 2B mutants that were unable to reduce the Ca2+ content of the stores failed to protect against apoptosis. These data implicate a functional role of the 2B-induced perturbation of intracellular Ca2+ compartmentalization in the enteroviral strategy to suppress premature abortion of the viral life cycle and provide a physiological example of the regulatory role of Ca2+ signaling in the modulation of apoptotic cell death. Reagents and Solutions—Fura-2/AM and coelenterazine were purchased from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Thapsigargin, histamine, actinomycin D, cycloheximide N-acetyl-d-sphingosine (C2 ceramide), and etoposide were purchased from Sigma. DAPI was obtained from Merck. HT buffer contained 132.6 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm glucose-monohydrate, 10 mm HEPES, 4.2 mm MgCl2, and (1×) minimum Eagle's medium amino acids (Invitrogen).

Cell Culture, Viruses, Plasmids, and Transfection—HeLa cells were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 25 μg/ml streptomycin. CHO cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 μg/ml gentamycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The coxsackievirus B3 used in this study was derived from plasmid pCB3/T7, which contains a cDNA of coxsackievirus B3 (strain Nancy) behind a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Virus titers were determined by end point titration as described (20van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Galama J.M.D. Zoll J. Melchers W.J.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7782-7790Google Scholar). Plasmid GFP (S65T) was from Clontech. Plasmid 2B-GFP (S65T) was constructed by replacing the enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) coding region from 2B-ECFP (27van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Melchers W.J.G. Willems P.H.G.M. Gadella Jr., T.W. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9446-9456Google Scholar) with the GFP (S65T) coding region using AgeI and BfrI. Plasmid 2B-EGFP has been described (17de Jong A.S. Wessels E. Dijkman H.B.P.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. Willems P.H.G.M. van Kuppeveld F.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1012-1021Google Scholar). Plasmid mt-GFP encodes an EGFP protein that is targeted to the mitochondria through fusion with the signal sequence of cytochrome oxidase subunit VIII (28Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pizzo P. Murgia M.

For the Fura-2/AM measurements, 3 × 105 CHO cells were transfected with 2 μg of either GFP (S65T) or 2B-GFP (S65T) using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). After 24 h, 5 × 104 cells were seeded onto 24-mm coverslips and grown for another 16 h before [Ca2+]cyt measurements. For the aequorin measurements, HeLa cells were seeded onto 13-mm coverslips and cotransfected using the Ca2+ phosphate technique with 1 μg of erAEQ, GoAEQ, cytAEQ, or mtAEQ, together with 3 μg of 2B-EGFP or in combination with the same amount (3 μg) of mt-GFP (which served as negative control). For the cell death experiments, HeLa cells were seeded onto 24-mm coverslips and transfected with 4 μg of 2B-EGFP or mt-GFP. Fura-2/AM Measurements—The fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fura-2 was used to measure [Ca2+]cyt at the single cell level essentially as described (15van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Hoenderop J.G.J. Smeets R.L.L.M. Willems P.H.G.M. Dijkman H.B.P.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3519-3532Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in medium supplemented with 2.5 μm Fura-2/AM for 30 min, washed with HT buffer to remove the extracellular probe, supplied with preheated HT buffer (supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2), and placed in a thermostated (37 °C) incubation chamber on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon). Dynamic video imaging was performed using the MagiCal hardware and TARDIS software (Joyce Loebl, Tyne and Wear, UK). Fluorescence was measured every 2 s with the excitation wavelength alternating between 340 and 380 nm and the emission fluorescence being recorded at 492 nm. At the end of the experiment, a region free of cells was selected, and one averaged background frame was collected at each excitation wavelength for background correction. To measure the [Ca2+] of the stores, the amount of thapsigargin-releasable Ca2+ was determined. After recording the cells in Ca2+-containing HT buffer, the medium was replaced with Ca2+-free HT buffer supplemented with 0.5 mm EGTA. After 10 min, the cells were challenged with 1 μm thapsigargin, and [Ca2+]cyt was measured as described above. Aequorin Measurements—Organelle-targeted aequorin constructs were used to measure the [Ca2+] in the cytosol and different organelles at the cell population level (at 36 h post-transfection). For the mtAEQ and cytAEQ measurements, the cells were incubated with 5 μm coelenterazine for 1–2 h in DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS and then transferred to the perfusion chamber. To reconstitute the erAEQ and GoAEQ with high efficiency, the luminal [Ca2+] of the ER and Golgi first must be reduced. This was achieved by incubating the cells for 1 h at 4 °C in KRB supplemented with 5 μm coelenterazine, the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, and 600 μm EGTA. After this incubation, cells were extensively washed with KRB supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin. The coverslip with transfected cells was placed in a perfused, thermostated chamber located in the close proximity of a low noise photomultiplier, with built-in amplifier-discriminator. All aequorin measurements were carried out in KRB supplemented with either 1 mm Ca2+ or the indicated [Ca2+]. Agonists and other drugs were added to the same medium, as specified in the relevant figure legends. The experiments were terminated by lysing the cells with 100 μm digitonin in a hypotonic Ca2+-containing solution (10 mm CaCl2 in H2O), thus discharging the remaining aequorin pool. The output of the discriminator was captured by a Thorn-EMI photon counting board and stored in an IBM-compatible computer for further analyses. The aequorin luminescence data were calibrated off-line into [Ca2+] values, using a computer algorithm based on the Ca2+ response curve of wildtype and mutant aequorins (30Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Google Scholar, 33Barrero M.J. Montero M. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27694-27699Google Scholar). Cell Death Analysis—To assay the antiapoptotic effects in coxsackievirus-infected cells, cells grown on coverslips were either mock-infected or infected with coxsackievirus (30 min at room temperature) at a multiplicity of infection of 50. At the indicated times (specified in the relevant figure legends), cells were challenged with guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) (2 mm), cycloheximide (100 μg/ml), or actinomycin D (0.5 μg/ml) for the indicated times. For the analysis of the nuclear morphology, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with DAPI (10 μg/ml), viewed under an Axiovert epifluorescence-inverted microscope (Carl-Zeiss GmbH), and imaged with a Nikon Coolpix 995 digital camera equipped with an MDC lens. Caspase activation was analyzed using the Apo-ONE™ homogeneous caspase-3/7 assay according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega). Analysis of DNA fragmentation was performed as described by Tolskaya et al. (4Tolskaya E.A. Romanova L.I. Kolesnikova M.S. Ivannikova T.A. Smirnova E.A. Raikhlin N.T. Agol V.I. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1181-1189Google Scholar). Incubations were performed in serum-free DMEM except for the experiments in which caspase-3 activation was assayed (because of the high caspase-3 background in serum-free DMEM in control cells and infected cells). To investigate the antiapoptotic effects in 2B-expressing cells, cells grown on coverslips were transfected either with 2B-GFP or mt-GFP. At 36 h post-transfection, cells were treated with the apoptosis-inducing drugs for 4 h (for analysis of caspase-3 activation) or 16 h (for analysis of cell survival). Incubation with cycloheximide, actinomycin D, and etoposide was performed in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Incubation with ceramide was performed in KRB buffer supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2. To assay caspase-3 activation, cells were fixed and stained as described (17de Jong A.S. Wessels E. Dijkman H.B.P.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. Willems P.H.G.M. van Kuppeveld F.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1012-1021Google Scholar) with an anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp-175) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), which specifically recognizes active caspase-3 but not its inactive zymogen, and a Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. The percentage of caspase-3-positive GFP-expressing cells was determined de visu by counting at the microscope. To assay cell survival, cells were washed thoroughly to eliminate apoptotic cells after incubation with the apoptotic drugs. The percentage of fluorescent cells before and after a challenge with the apoptotic drugs was determined de visu by counting at the microscope. Ca2+ Homeostasis in 2B-expressing Cells—To investigate the effects of 2B on subcellular Ca2+ homeostasis, we made use of a fusion protein of 2B and GFP. We have shown previously that the fusion of EGFP at the C terminus of the coxsackievirus 2B protein does not interfere with its membrane-active function and localization (17de Jong A.S. Wessels E. Dijkman H.B.P.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. Willems P.H.G.M. van Kuppeveld F.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1012-1021Google Scholar). Because the EGFP fluorescence heavily contaminates that of the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fura-2 (data not shown) (34Bolsover S. Ibrahim O. O'Luanaigh N. Williams H. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 345-352Google Scholar), we made use of GFP (S65T), a nonenhanced GFP protein that exhibits 30-fold reduced fluorescence intensity relative to EGFP. Fig. 1A shows the [Ca2+]cyt of nontransfected control cells and cells expressing either GFP (S65T) or 2B-GFP (S65T). The [Ca2+]cyt in GFP-expressing cells was slightly lower than that of control cells (suggesting that there is some minor contamination of the Fura-2 fluorescence by GFP). Expression of 2B-GFP, however, resulted in a significant increase in [Ca2+]cyt (p < 0.01), shown previously to depend on extracellular Ca2+ (15van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Hoenderop J.G.J. Smeets R.L.L.M. Willems P.H.G.M. Dijkman H.B.P.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3519-3532Google Scholar). Next, we addressed the relationship between the [Ca2+]cyt and the [Ca2+] of the intracellular stores (i.e. ER and Golgi) using thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump. The activity of the SERCA is required to compensate for the continuous leakage of Ca2+ that takes place from the stores under normal conditions. Upon inhibition of the SERCA, the Ca2+ that leaks from the stores is not resequestered and accumulates in the cytosol. The size of the thapsigargin-induced transient increase in [Ca2+]cyt reflects the [Ca2+] of the stores. Fig. 1B shows that the amount of thapsigargin-releasable Ca2+ in cells expressing GFP was similar to that observed in nontransfected control cells. Cells expressing 2B-GFP, however, exhibited a significant decrease (p < 0.01) in the amount of thapsigargin-releasable Ca2+. Fig. 1C shows representative traces of nontransfected controls cells, cells expressing GFP, and cells expressing 2B-GFP. The amount of thapsigargin-releasable Ca2+ from cells expressing 2B-GFP exhibited an inverse relationship with the initial [Ca2+]cyt (as measured in the presence of extracellular Ca2+); i.e. the higher the initial [Ca2+]cyt, the lower the amount of Ca2+ that can be released from the stores (Fig. 1, C and D). Fig. 1D also demonstrates that the filling state of the thapsigargin-sensitive stores of 2B-GFP-expressing cells was always lower than that of control cells, even when the initial [Ca2+]cyt was similar. Taken together, these results show that the 2B-induced reduction in the [Ca2+] of the stores precedes the increased influx of extracellular Ca2+, providing evidence that the stores are the primary target of 2B. Reduced ER and Golgi Luminal Ca2+ Concentrations in 2B-expressing Cells—To investigate the effect of 2B on ER and Golgi calcium levels directly and independently, we used chimeras of aequorin, a Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein. To this end, HeLa cells were cotransfected with erAEQ or GoAEQ and 2B-GFP or mt-GFP (which was further used as negative control throughout this study), and the [Ca2+]ER and [Ca2+]Golgi were compared. To efficiently reconstitute the aequorin chimeras and reliably measure [Ca2+]ER and [Ca2+]Golgi, the luminal [Ca2+] of these organelles must first be reduced. This was obtained by incubation of the cells in KRB supplemented with coelenterazine (i.e. the prosthetic group of aequorin) and ionomycin, a Ca2+ ionophore, in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Aequorin luminescence signals were collected using a luminometer and calibrated into [Ca2+] values. Under these conditions, the [Ca2+] was <10 μm in both organelles. Upon switching the perfusion medium to KRB buffer supplemented with 1 mm Ca2+, [Ca2+]ER and [Ca2+]Golgi gradually increased, reaching plateau levels in control cells of ∼365 μm in the ER and ∼345 μm in the Golgi (Fig. 2). In 2B-GFP-expressing cells, lower steady state levels (∼30–40% reduction) were observed in both compartments (∼255 and ∼215 μm in the ER and Golgi, respectively). The addition of histamine to the cells resulted in a rapid decrease in [Ca2+] in both organelles, confirming that the sensitivity to agonists of the two Ca2+ stores was retained, although a smaller amount of Ca2+ could be released in 2B-expressing cells. Taken together, these data indicate that 2B is responsible for a reduction of the luminal [Ca2+] in both ER and Golgi. Mitochondrial and Cytosolic Ca2+ Handling in 2B-expressing Cells—Mitochondria play an important role in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. The mitochondria are localized in close proximity of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-gated channels and are capable of taking up the Ca2+ that is released by IP3-generating agonists, thereby buffering the [Ca2+]cyt (35Rizzuto R. Pinton P Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the 2B-induced reduction in the steady state [Ca2+]ER and [Ca2+]Golgi levels and the ensuing reduction of IP3-induced Ca2+ release should decrease the uptake of Ca2+ by the mitochondria. To test this hypothesis, HeLa cells were transfected with mtAEQ and either 2B-GFP or mt-GFP and then challenged with histamine (in the presence of extracellular Ca2+). Fig. 3A shows that the peak mitochondrial response is markedly reduced (almost ∼35%) in 2B-GFP-expressing cells compared with the control cells. Similar results were obtained when cells were challenged with ATP, an agonist that drives production of IP3 through its action on a Gq-coupled P2Y receptor, or when CHO cells were used as model system (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that the 2B-induced reduction of [Ca2+] in the stores leads to a reduction in the stimulus-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. The 2B-induced reduction in the steady state [Ca2+]ER and [Ca2+]Golgi levels should also be reflected in a decrease in the rise of the [Ca2+]cyt upon stimulation with IP3-generating agonists. To investigate this supposition, HeLa cells were cotransfected with cytAEQ and 2B-GFP or mt-GFP and then challenged with histamine (in the presence of extracellular Ca2+). Surprising"
https://openalex.org/W2107496637,"The study aimed at determining whether aging and/or sedentariness impairs muscle fat oxidative capacity (OXFA) and whether this was associated with increased risk to develop insulin resistance. We first examined muscle mitochondrial functions, OXFA and insulin sensitivity (ISI; evaluated during an oral glucose tolerance test) in a cross-sectional study with 32 sedentary (S) and endurance-trained (T), young (Y) and elderly (E) men (24.2+/-2.6 vs. 66.6+/-3.2 yr). As for mitochondrial functions, OXFA was higher in T than in S but similar between age groups (SY 41.8+/-11.3, TY 68.0+/-17.7, SE 40.1+/-14.1, TE 73.1+/-20.1 palmitate x min(-1) x g wet tissue(-1); activity P<0.0001, age P=NS, activity x age P=NS). Similar results were obtained with ISI (SY 6.2+/-2.2, TY 11.4+/-4.4, SE 5.9+/-1.5, TE 11.0+/-3.5, activity P<0.001, age P=NS, activity x age P=NS). Stepwise regression showed that, among body composition, VO2max and muscle biochemical characteristics, OXFA was the main predictor of ISI (r=0.60, P<0.001). We subsequently showed in eight sedentary elderly subjects (63.5+/-3.3 yr) that OXFA and insulin sensitivity (measured using insulin clamp) improved in parallel after 8 weeks of endurance training (r=0.79, P<0.01). We concluded that mitochondrial functions, OXFA and ISI, are not impaired by age but by physical inactivity and are closely correlated."
https://openalex.org/W2143942568,"Cyclic nucleotides regulate axonal responses to a number of guidance cues through unknown molecular events. We report here that Drosophila nervy, a member of the myeloid translocation gene family of A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), regulates repulsive axon guidance by linking the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to the Semaphorin 1a (Sema-1a) receptor Plexin A (PlexA). Nervy and PKA antagonize Sema-1a-PlexA-mediated repulsion, and the AKAP binding region of Nervy is critical for this effect. Thus, Nervy couples cAMP-PKA signaling to PlexA to regulate Sema-1a-mediated axonal repulsion, revealing a simple molecular mechanism that allows growing axons to integrate inputs from multiple guidance cues."
https://openalex.org/W2018736093,"The glyoxalase system is a ubiquitous pathway catalyzing the glutathione-dependent detoxication of ketoaldehydes such as methylglyoxal, which is mainly formed as a by-product of glycolysis.

Our results show that the glyoxalase system is another pathway in which the nearly ubiquitous glutathione is replaced by the unique trypanothione in trypanosomatids. The glyoxalase system is a ubiquitous pathway for the detoxication of highly reactive ketoaldehydes. Glyoxalase I (EC 4.4.1.5., lactoylglutathione methylglyoxal lyase) and glyoxalase II (EC 3.1.2.6., hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase) catalyze the dismutation of 2-ketoaldehydes into the corresponding 2-hydroxy acids using glutathione as cofactor (1Vander Jagt D.L. Dolphin D. Avramovic O. Poulson R. Coenzymes and Cofactors. IIIA. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989: 597-641Google Scholar, 2Thornalley P.J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 111–112: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The main physiological function of the glyoxalase system is probably the detoxication of methylglyoxal, a mutagenic and cytotoxic compound that is mainly formed as a by-product of glycolysis. In addition, methylglyoxal is produced by the catabolism of amino acids via aminoacetone or hydroxyacetone (3Phillips S.A. Thornalley P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Methylglyoxal can react with the nucleophilic centers of DNA, RNA, and proteins. The ketoaldehyde reacts with the side chains of arginine, lysine, and cysteine and with the base guanine and to a lesser extent with adenine and cytosine. Glyoxalase I (GLX I) 1The abbreviations used are: GLX I, glyoxalase I; GLX II, glyoxalase II; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. converts the hemithioacetal, which is formed spontaneously from methylglyoxal and glutathione, into S-lactoylglutathione. The thioester is subsequently hydrolyzed by glyoxalase II (GLX II) yielding d-lactate and regenerating glutathione. Trypanosomatids are the causative agents of severe tropical diseases such as African sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense), Nagana cattle disease (T. brucei brucei and Trypanosoma congolense), Chagas' disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), and the three manifestations of leishmaniasis (Leishmania donovani, Leishmania major, and Leishmania mexicana). All these parasitic protozoa have in common that the nearly ubiquitous glutathione/glutathione reductase system is replaced by trypanothione (N1,N8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine) and the flavoenzyme trypanothione reductase (4Fairlamb A.H.

A linkage between glutathione and spermidine metabolism was first discovered in Escherichia coli (6Tabor H. Tabor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2648-2654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During stationary phase, all of the cellular spermidine and a large part of glutathione occur as mono(glutathionyl)spermidine whereby the bacterium does not form trypanothione. The trypanothione metabolism is essential for the parasite (7Krieger S. Schwarz W. Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Clayton C. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 542-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and is involved in the detoxication of hydroperoxides, the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase, as well as the homeostasis of ascorbate (5Müller S.

The pathogenic form of T. brucei multiplying in the blood of the mammalian host depends on glycolysis as the sole energy source and has a very high glucose turnover, which is about 200–300-fold higher than in erythrocytes (8Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar). In E. coli and human red blood cells, the glycolytic rate has been shown to quantitatively correlate with the formation of methylglyoxal (2Thornalley P.J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 111–112: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 3Phillips S.A. Thornalley P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). These findings together with the fact that trypanothione instead of glutathione is the main low molecular mass thiol prompted us to characterize the glyoxalase system in African trypanosomes. The T. brucei genome contains two probable glyoxalase II sequences. Here we report on the cloning and overexpression of a glyoxalase II gene encoded on chromosome VI. The recombinant T. brucei protein slowly hydrolyzes lactoylglutathione, the substrate of classical glyoxalases II, but strongly prefers trypanothione thioesters. We provide strong evidence that glutathione is replaced by trypanothione also in the glyoxalase system of trypanosomatid parasites. S-Lactoylglutathione, methylglyoxal, yeast glyoxalase I (400–800 units/mg), bovine liver glyoxalase II (10 units/mg), and Leuconostoc mesenteroidesd-lactate dehydrogenase were purchased from Sigma. Hog muscle l-lactate dehydrogenase was from Roche. T. cruzi trypanothione reductase was prepared as described (9Sullivan F.X. Walsh C.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 44: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Trypanothione disulfide was obtained from Bachem. Restriction enzymes and PfuTurbo DNA polymerase were from MBI Fermentas. Primer synthesis and DNA sequencing were performed by MWG Biotech. All other chemicals were commercially available reagents of the highest quality. T. brucei His6-GLX II—The coding region of the glxII gene was amplified from T. brucei genomic DNA (strain TREU 927/4 (10Melville S.E. Leech V. Gerrard C.S. Tait A. Blackwell J.M. Mol. Biochem.

The 5′ primer (5′-gcgcggatccgaagttgtagtgaagagcatcgg-3′) contained a BamHI site (underlined) and gaa encoding glutamate 2 of the protein. The 3′ primer (5′-taggtaccacaccatagttcgcg-3′) was placed in the 3′-untranslated region directly after the stop codon. The gene was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR (95 °C for 2 min; 95 °C for 30 s; 55 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles; 72 °C for 10 min; Pfu). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and cloned into the pQE-30 vector (Qiagen), digested with BamHI and SmaI. E. coli NovaBlue cells (Novagen) were transformed with the pQE-30/his-glxII plasmid. The plasmid was isolated using the NucleoBond® plasmid purification kit (Macherey-Nagel) and the insert was completely sequenced in both directions. For overexpression of T. brucei His6-GLX II, a 1-liter culture of recombinant NovaBlue cells was incubated at 37 °C in LB-medium containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin. At an A600 of about 0.5, expression was induced by adding 200 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and the cells were allowed to grow overnight at 15 °C. T. brucei GLX II—For overexpression of tag-free T. brucei glyoxalase II, the 5′ primer (5′-cgcgccatggaagttgtagtgaagagcatc-3′) contained an NcoI site (underlined) and the start ATG (italic). The 3′ primer (5′-cgcaggatccttacggacacgtattatagaggaag-3′) contained the stop codon (tta) and a BamHI site (underlined). The gene was amplified from genomic DNA (95 °C for 2 min; 95 °C for 30 s; 64 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles; 72 °C for 10 min; Pfu) and the PCR product was cloned using the NcoI and BamHI restriction sites into the pQE-60 vector, resulting in the pQE-60/glxII plasmid. The plasmid was isolated and sequenced. NovaBlue cells were transformed with the plasmid and the gene was overexpressed as described above. The fusion protein, carrying a 14-residue long N-terminal extension with six histidine residues, was purified at 4 °C by chromatography on a TALON® metal affinity resin column (Clontech). Cells from a 1-liter bacterial culture were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm imidazol, pH 7.0, 150 nm pepstatin, 4 nm cystatin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by sonification, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 33,000 × g. The supernatant was applied onto a 5-ml resin pre-equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm imidazol, pH 7.0. After washing the column with the equilibration buffer, followed by 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazol, pH 7.0, the protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazol in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. The recombinant T. brucei His6-glyoxalase II was ≥95% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid kit (BCA, Pierce). The recombinant protein without tag was purified on a Q-Sepharose fast flow cation exchanger (Amersham Biosciences). The column (10 ml) was equilibrated at 4 °C in 100 ml of 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5. The recombinant NovaBlue cells from a 1-liter culture were harvested by centrifugation, the cell pellet was suspended in 5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 150 nm pepstatin, 4 nm cystatin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed as described above. The supernatant was diluted with H2O to a conductivity lower than that of the equilibration buffer and applied onto the column. After washing the Q-Sepharose with 120 ml of equilibration buffer, the protein was eluted with 90 ml of 20 mm NaCl in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, collecting 5-ml fractions. The purity of the protein was ≥95% as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For homogeneous His6-GLX II and tag-free GLX II a protein concentration of 0.58 mg/ml corresponds to a ΔA280 of 1. For long-term storage at -20 °C, 50% glycerol was added to the protein preparations. The subunit composition of T. brucei glyoxalase II was determined by fast protein liquid chromatography on a High Load 26/60 Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences). Purified, tag-free protein (3.6 mg) was loaded onto the column equilibrated in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and run at room temperature at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, collecting 3-ml fractions. The low molecular weight Gel Filtration Kit (bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, chymotrypsinogen A, and ribonuclease A) (Amersham Biosciences) served as molecular mass standard. The lactoyltrypanothione thioesters were prepared in two steps. For the generation of mono-(lactoyl)trypanothione, 5 mm trypanothione disulfide in 1 ml of 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, was reduced with 7 mm NADPH and 2.75 units of T. cruzi trypanothione reductase for 1 h at room temperature. Then 10 μl of 100 mm methylglyoxal in 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, and 6.4 units of yeast glyoxalase I were added and the reaction mixture was incubated for another 1 h. For the synthesis of bis-(lactoyl)trypanothione, 1.5 ml of 3 mm reduced trypanothione was mixed with 8 μl of 5.5 m methylglyoxal and treated as described above. NADPH, methylglyoxal, and the proteins were removed from the thioesters (and excess trypanothione in the case of mono-(lactoyl)trypanothione) on an Oasis® MCX cartridge (Waters). The cartridge was pre-equilibrated with 1 ml of methanol and 2 ml of H2O and the reaction mixture was applied. After washing with 2 ml of H2O and 2 ml of methanol, the thioesters were eluted with 2 ml of 1 m N-ethylmorpholino acetate, pH 6.8. The flow-through already containing some thioester was again applied onto the re-equilibrated cartridge, washed, and eluted with 1 ml of 1 m N-ethylmorpholino acetate, pH 6.8. The thioester containing fractions were dried by evaporation and stored in aliquots at -20 °C. Immediately before use, an aliquot was dissolved in 150 μl of 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.2. The concentration was determined by measuring the thiol content with DTNB before and after hydrolysis of the thioester by glyoxalase II (11Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). The S-lactoyltrypanothione thioesters eluted from the Oasis MCX cartridge were analyzed by HPLC using a buffer system described in Ref. 12Shahi S.K. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Clayton C.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar. After injection of the sample, the column (Vydac 218TP52) was washed at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min for 5 min with solvent A (0.25% (w/v) d-camphor sulfonate Li-salt, pH 2.64) at 40 °C. Then the thioesters were eluted by a 19-min isocratic step of 90% solvent A and 10% solvent B (25% 1-propanol in solvent A). Before applying a new sample, the column was washed with 100% solvent B for 10 min and equilibrated for 23 min with 100% solvent A. The S-lactoyltrypanothione conjugates were detected by the thioester absorption at 240 nm. To show the regeneration of trypanothione in the T. brucei glyoxalase II reaction, the samples were analyzed at 220 nm. The MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight) analyses of the thioesters were carried out by Drs. Jens Pfannstiel and Johannes Lechner (Biochemie-Zentrum der Universität Heidelberg) using a 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix. The activities of T. brucei and bovine liver glyoxalase II were determined by measuring the hydrolysis of the thioesters (lactoylglutathione, mono-(lactoyl)trypanothione, and bis-(lactoyl)trypanothione) directly at 240 nm or in a coupled assay following the reaction of the liberated thiol with DTNB at 412 nm (13Ridderström M. Saccucci F. Hellman U. Bergman T. Principato G. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 319-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The assays were performed in a total volume of 1 ml of 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, at 25 °C in a Hitachi 150-20 spectrophotometer or in 300-μl microcuvettes in a Beckman DU®-65 spectrophotometer. The lactoylglutathione concentration was varied between 0.01 and 5 mm in the coupled and between 0.01 and 0.6 mm in the direct assay. Hydrolysis of the lactoyltrypanothione thioesters was followed only in the direct assay at 240 nm at concentrations between 0.02 and 0.15 mm. The thioester stock solutions were freshly prepared from a dried aliquot stored at -20 °C (see above). The extinction coefficients used are DTNB, ϵ412 = 13.6 mm-1 cm-1 (11Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar), SLG, ϵ240 = 3.3 mm-1 cm-1 (14Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 190: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Uotila L. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3938-3943Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), MLT, ϵ240 = 3.3 mm-1 cm-1, and BLT, ϵ240 = 6.5 mm-1 cm-1, respectively. The ϵ values of the trypanothione thioesters were derived from measuring the thiol concentration with DTNB after complete hydrolysis. The pH dependence of T. brucei glyoxalase II was determined by following the activity of the enzyme in the presence of 82 μm bis-(lactoyl)trypanothione in a total volume of 200 μl of 100 mm MOPS between pH 6.0 and 9.2 at 25 °C. To elucidate the optimum of ionic strength, assays were performed at 25 °C with 88 μm bis-(lactoyl) trypanothione in a total volume of 200 μl of 10–250 mm MOPS buffers at a constant pH of 7.2. Production of d-lactate was shown by coupling the T. brucei glyoxalase II reaction to the reaction of d- and l-lactate dehydrogenase, respectively, following formation of NADH. After the glyoxalase II reaction with 87.5 μm bis-(lactoyl)trypanothione in 800 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, had run to completion, 5 mm NAD and 2.75 units of d- or l-lactate dehydrogenase were added and the absorption increase at 340 nm (ϵ340 = 6.22 mm-1 cm-1) was followed at 25 °C (16Gutheil W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 259: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The metal content of His6- and tag-free T. brucei glyoxalase II was analyzed by Dr. Peter Schramel (GSF-Forschungszentrum, Neuherberg) by ICP-OES (inductively coupled-plasma optical emission spectrometry). For comparison, the concentration of different metals in the buffers before and after the columns used for purification were determined. About 12 mg of T. brucei His6-GLX II in 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, was coupled to 0.7 ml of Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) overnight at 4 °C as described by the manufacturer. The resin was then washed with 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, and the remaining reactive groups were blocked with 0.7 ml of 1 m ethanolamine acetate, pH 8.0, for 1 h at 4 °C. The column was washed 2 times each with 3 ml of PBS, containing 250 mm NaCl, 3 ml of 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, 3 ml of PBS with 500 mm NaCl, and again with 3 ml of PBS containing 250 mm NaCl. The IgGs from 30 ml of rabbit polyclonal antiserum against T. brucei His6-GLX II (Eurogentec) were precipitated by 33% (NH4)2SO4 overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 20 min at 33,000 × g, the pellet was dissolved in 10 ml of PBS containing 250 mm NaCl, and the solution was applied onto the Affi-Gel 10-His6-GLX II column at room temperature. The flow-through was again applied, and the column was washed with 7 ml of PBS containing 250 mm NaCl. After additional washing with 5 ml of PBS with 500 mm NaCl, the antibodies were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, collecting 1-ml fractions in Eppendorf cups containing 60 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 9.5. The protein concentration was determined at 280 nm. Antibody containing fractions were pooled (3 ml), glycerol was added at 50% saturation, and aliquots were stored at -20 °C. Recombinant T. brucei GLX II and cell lysates of bloodstream and procyclic T. brucei were mixed with 4× SDS loading buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.004% bromphenol blue, containing 100 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine solution, neutral pH (Bond-Breaker®, Pierce)) and boiled for 5 min. The proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% SDS gel and transferred onto a Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by a Bio-Rad Mini Trans Blot, at 4 °C for 2 h at 150 mA. The membrane was treated with blocking solution (5% milk powder, 1× Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween) overnight at 4 °C. The blot was washed at room temperature three times for 5 min with 1× Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween and then incubated for 1 h with the purified T. brucei GLX II antibodies (see above, dilution 1:500). The membrane was again washed as described above and treated with the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz, dilution 1:20,000)) for 1 h. After washing with Tris-buffered saline/Tween, the blots were developed using the SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) with exposition times from 30 s to 60 min. Cloning and Structural Comparison of T. brucei Glyoxalase II with Glyoxalases II from Other Species—Blast searches with human glyoxalase II as template revealed two sets of putative glyoxalase II sequences in the T. brucei genome. The deduced protein sequences encoded on chromosomes IV and VI were only 25% identical to each other but showed 30 and 36% identity with human glyoxalase II, respectively. Based on this information, the gene on chromosome VI was cloned from genomic DNA of strain TREU 927/4 (10Melville S.E. Leech V. Gerrard C.S. Tait A. Blackwell J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 155-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The complete coding region was amplified with two gene-specific primers and sequenced in both directions. PCR on cDNA from bloodstream T. brucei with a sequence-specific primer and a poly(dT) primer amplified a fragment containing the 3′ end of the coding sequence followed by a 390-bp long 3′-untranslated region (data not shown). The deduced protein sequence consists of 296 amino acid residues and clearly classifies the T. brucei protein as glyoxalase II. The highest degree of similarity is found with putative proteins from T. cruzi and L. major where 66 and 51%, respectively, of all residues are identical. In the functionally characterized human and Arabidopsis thaliana glyoxalases II 36 and 31%, respectively, of all residues are conserved. The sequence of a probable hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase from E. coli shows 30% identical residues (Fig. 1). The isoelectric point (pI) of T. brucei glyoxalase II calculated from the protein sequence is 6.0–6.5, which is comparable with those of the proteins from A. thaliana (6.2) (17Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and Candida albicans (6.0) (18Talesa V. Rosi G. Bistoni F. Marconi P. Norton S.J. Principato G.B. Biochem. Int. 1990; 21: 397-403PubMed Google Scholar) determined by isoelectric focusing. The putative other kinetoplastid glyoxalases II (Fig. 1) also have theoretical acidic pI values. In general, plant glyoxalases II are acidic proteins with pI values ranging from 4.7 to 6.2, whereas animal enzymes have basic pI values. Isoelectric focusing of recombinant human glyoxalase II and the enzyme isolated from erythrocytes yielded isoelectric points of 8.5 (13Ridderström M. Saccucci F. Hellman U. Bergman T. Principato G. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 319-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and 8.3 (19Allen R.E. Lo T.W. Thornalley P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1261-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), respectively. Several glyoxalases II such as the enzyme from Aloe vera (20Norton S.J. Talesa V. Yuan W.J. Principato G.B. Biochem. Int. 1990; 22: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), spinach leaves (21Talesa V. Rosi G. Contenti S. Mangiabene C. Lupattelli M. Norton S.J. Giovannini E. Principato G.B. Biochem. Int. 1990; 22: 1115-1120PubMed Google Scholar), and bovine liver mitochondria (22Talesa V. Principato G.B. Norton S.J. Contenti S. Mangiabene C. Rosi G. Biochem. Int. 1990; 20: 53-58PubMed Google Scholar) show multiple protein bands when subjected to isoelectric focusing. At least some of the bands may be explained by a varying content of their metal cofactors that obviously exchange or get lost easily (see below). Because the molecular and kinetic properties of the known glyoxalases II are very similar, the diversities of their isoelectric points probably reflect the evolutionary distance rather than functional differences of the enzymes. Glyoxalases II contain the highly conserved metal binding motif THXHXDH (23Zang T.M. Hollman D.A. Crawford P.A. Crowder M.W. Makaroff C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4788-4795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In total, five His and two Asp residues interact directly with two metal ions as shown in the three-dimensional structure of human glyoxalase II (24Cameron A.D. Ridderström M. Olin B. Mannervik B. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (153) Google Scholar). All these residues are conserved in the trypanosomatid proteins, suggesting that the parasite proteins also possess metal cofactors (Fig. 1). The structure of human glyoxalase II in complex with a substrate analogue revealed three conserved basic residues that are involved in the fixation of the thioester in the active site. Arg-249, Lys-252, and Lys-143 (numbering of human glyoxalase II) are in close proximity to the glycine carboxylate of the glutathione moiety of the substrate analogue (24Cameron A.D. Ridderström M. Olin B. Mannervik B. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These residues, present in all glyoxalases II studied so far, are not conserved in the proteins from T. brucei and the other kinetoplastid organisms. This was the first indication that glutathione thioesters are probably not the physiological substrates of the parasite glyoxalases II. Overexpression and Purification of T. brucei Glyoxalase II— The glyoxalase II gene was overexpressed from pQE vectors with and without the N-terminal His6 tag. Purification of His-tagged T. brucei glyoxalase II by metal affinity chromatography yielded 10 mg of pure protein from a 1-liter bacterial culture. The tag-free recombinant protein was purified also in a single step using Q-Sepharose as cation exchanger. About 16 mg of pure protein were obtained from a 1-liter culture. Gel filtration of the recombinant protein on Superdex 75 yielded a relative molecular mass of about 25,000 in accordance with a monomeric structure. This corresponds to all glyoxalases II studied so far, e.g. from A. vera (20Norton S.J. Talesa V. Yuan W.J. Principato G.B. Biochem. Int. 1990; 22: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), human red blood cells (19Allen R.E. Lo T.W. Thornalley P.J. Eur. J.

J. 1997; 322: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The molecular mass calculated from the protein sequence is 32,507 in good agreement with 32,000 estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Synthesis and Structural Analysis of S-Lactoyltrypanothione—Mono- and bis-(lactoyl)trypanothione thioesters were obtained by reacting reduced trypanothione with methylglyoxal. The spontaneous reaction resulted in a hemithioacetal (14Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 190: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Rae C. O'Donoghue S.I. Bubb W.A. Kuchel P.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3548-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which is isomerized into the lactoyltrypanothione thioester by yeast glyoxalase I. The method takes advantage of the fact that glyoxalase I, in contrast to glyoxalase II, is not highly specific for glutathione but also accepts derivatives of glutathione modified at the glycine carboxylate (26Cameron A.D. Olin B. Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3386-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 27Hamilton D.S. Creighton D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1159: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The thioesters were freed from the other reaction components by chromatography on an Oasis MCX cation exchanger cartridge that retains the positively charged trypanothione derivatives. HPLC analysis of bis-(lactoyl)trypanothione showed two peaks with retention times of 17.5 and 19.5 min. The first, minor peak represents mono-(lactoyl)trypanothione and the second, major peak is bis-(lactoyl)trypanothione (Fig. 2A). Mass spectrometry confirmed bis-(lactoyl)trypanothione as the main reaction product and the presence of a small amount of mono-(lactoyl)trypanothione (Fig. 2B). Mono-(lactoyl)trypanothione (≥90% pure) was obtained by a"
https://openalex.org/W2045648308,"We have engineered a pathway for the formation of disulfide bonds. By imposing evolutionary pressure, we isolated mutations that changed thioredoxin, which is a monomeric disulfide reductase, into a [2Fe-2S] bridged dimer capable of catalyzing O2-dependent sulfhydryl oxidation in vitro. Expression of the mutant protein in Escherichia coli with oxidizing cytoplasm and secretion via the Tat pathway restored disulfide bond formation in strains that lacked the complete periplasmic oxidative machinery (DsbA and DsbB). The evolution of [2Fe-2S] thioredoxin illustrates how mutations within an existing scaffold can add a cofactor and markedly change protein function."

GRKs utilize a variety of mechanisms to bind tightly, and sometimes reversibly, to cellular membranes. Previous studies demonstrated the presence of a membrane binding domain in the C terminus of GRK5. Here we define a mechanism by which this short C-terminal stretch of amino acids of GRK5 mediates PM localization. Secondary structure predictions suggest that a region contained within amino acids 546-565 of GRK5 forms an amphipathic helix, with the key features of the predicted helix being a hydrophobic patch of amino acids on one face of the helix, hydrophilic amino acids on the opposite face, and a number of basic amino acids surrounding the hydrophobic patch. We show that amino acids 546-565 of GRK5 are sufficient to target the cytoplasmic green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the PM, and the hydrophobic amino acids are necessary for PM targeting of GFP-546-565. Moreover, full-length GRK5-GFP is localized to the PM, but mutation of the hydrophobic patch or the surrounding basic amino acids prevents PM localization of GRK5-GFP. Last, we show that mutation of the hydrophobic residues severely diminishes phospholipid-dependent autophosphorylation of GRK5 and phosphorylation of membrane-bound rhodopsin by GRK5.

Proper regulation of GPCR signaling is maintained in part by a process known as desensitization (1Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), which refers to the turning off of a GPCR-initiated signaling event in the continuous presence of agonist. A key mechanism of GPCR desensitization is phosphorylation of agonist-occupied receptor by the G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (2Penn R.B. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation promotes binding of arrestin proteins to the GPCR and results in subsequent uncoupling of the GPCR from G protein. To function properly GRKs need to be localized to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane (PM) where their GPCR substrates are located. Different members of the GRK family utilize a variety of mechanisms to bind to cellular membranes (2Penn R.B. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Trends Cardiovasc.

The pleckstrin homology domains allow PM binding by interacting with both phospholipids and free G protein βγ subunits. In contrast to GRK2/3, other GRK family members exhibit a more constitutive association with cellular membranes. GRK1 and GRK7 contain a C-terminal CAAX motif, which directs covalent modification by a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl isoprenoid (1Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol.

The isoprenyl lipid contributes to membrane binding by providing a hydrophobic anchor to insert into membranes. Similarly, covalent attachment of palmitate to C-terminal cysteines of GRK4 and GRK6 contributes to their PM localization (8Premont R.T. Macrae A.D. Stoffel R.H. Chung N. Pitcher J.A. Ambrose C.

The remaining GRK, GRK5, does not appear to undergo a lipid modification, yet it binds tightly to membranes. Interestingly, a short region, amino acids 552-562, in the C terminus of GRK5 has been defined as critical for binding of GRK5 to phospholipids in vitro and localization of GRK5 to the PM in cells (12Pronin A.N.

However, the mechanism by which this C-terminal sequence of GRK5 contributes to membrane binding has not been defined. It has been noted that this region is rich in basic amino acids, and thus it has been proposed that the positively charged C-terminal region of GRK5 mediates binding to negatively charged phospholipid membranes (12Pronin A.N.

We provide evidence that is consistent with a novel prediction that this region of GRK5 forms an amphipathic helix in which a hydrophobic patch of amino acids is surrounded by basic residues. Our results demonstrate a major role for a sequence of hydrophobic residues in mediating PM localization and function of GRK5. Plasmids—GRK2-GFP and GRK5-GFP were constructed by subcloning the coding sequences of bovine GRK2 and human GRK5, respectively, into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). Mutants of full-length GRK5-GFP were generated using QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis. GFP-546-565 was generated by annealing the complementary oligos, 5′-gat ctc cca aga aag ggc tgc tcc aga gac tct tca agc ggc agc atc aga aca att cca aga gtt a-3′ and 5′-agc tta act ctt gga att gtt ctg atg ctg ccg ctt gaa gag tct ctg gag cag ccc ttt ctt ggg a-3′ and then directly subcloning into the BglII and Hind III restriction sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Mutants of GFP-546-565 were generated using QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis. Confocal Microscopy—HEK293 cells were grown to 50-90% confluence on 6-well dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were transfected with 1 μg of total DNA using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For pEGFP-N1 (GFP alone) and GFP-546-565 plasmids, 0.2 μg DNA was used along with 0.8 μg pcDNA3, while 0.5 μg of DNA was used for the full-length GRK2-GFP and GRK5-GFP plasmids along with 0.5 μg of pcDNA3. 24 h after transfection, cells were replated onto 35 mm glass bottom microwell dishes (Maktek Corp.). 24 h later, the medium was changed to F-12/Ham's containing 25 mm HEPES, and images were acquired of GFP fluorescence in live cells using a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser scanning confocal microscope (Kimmel Cancer Center Bioimaging Facility) running CoMos 7.0 software and interfaced to a Zeiss Plan-Apo 63 × 1.40 NA oil immersion objective. Samples were analyzed using excitation at 488 nm. Images of “x-y” sections through the middle of the cell were recorded. Quantitation of confocal microscopy images of single cells was performed using the Plot Profile tool of NIH ImageJ software. The relative magnitude of GFP distribution along linear slices of the cell was quantitated as described previously (15Thiyagarajan M.M. Bigras E. Van Tol H.H. Hebert T.E. Evanko D.S. Wedegaertner P.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9470-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Appropriate linear slices were chosen to maintain a standard distance of 100 pixels from one edge of a cell to an edge on the opposite side of the same cell. The average pixel intensity in 15-45 traces from n ≥ 5 cells for each protein was determined and plotted. Gray values of the distribution curves were normalized to 100. Histograms of the different GRK5 constructs are presented together to reveal quantitative differences in plasma membrane localization. The specific percent plasma membrane fluorescence for GRK5-GFP and GFP-546-565 was determined by quantitating the total pixel intensity under a 10-pixel-wide peak at each extremity of the plot and then dividing the total of the two peaks by the total pixel intensity under the entire histogram trace. To remove contributions to the PM signal not attributable to plasma membrane localization, the percent of fluorescence at the 10-pixel-wide edge was determined for GRK5(4A)GFP and GFP-546-565(4A), and then these values were subtracted from the values for GRK5-GFP and GFP-546-565, respectively. Preparation of COS-1 Cell Lysates—COS-1 cells were grown at 37 °C to 50-90% confluence on 10-cm dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were transfected with 10 μg of total DNA (pcDNA3 alone or wt or mutant GRK5-GFP in pEGFP-N1) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were harvested after 48 h, washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 1 ml buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.02% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mm benzamidine) by Polytron homogenization (two 15-s bursts at 2500 rpm). Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 40,000 × g to remove particulate matter, and supernatants were then assayed. Levels of protein expression were equivalent based on Western blot analysis. Substrate Phosphorylation—To test for the ability of the wt and mutant GRKs to phosphorylate rhodopsin, 2 μl of COS-1 cell lysates was incubated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, ∼1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and ∼3.5 μm rhodopsin at 30 °C in room light. Reactions were quenched after 2, 5, 10, and 20 min by addition of SDS sample buffer and incubation for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were then electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and gels were fixed in 0.7 m trichloroacetic acid, 0.14 m 5′-sulfosalicylic acid for 10 min to remove unincorporated radionucleotide, washed twice in 50% ethanol, 16% acetic acid for 10 min, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Rhodopsin bands were excised and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. To test for the ability of the wt and mutant GRKs to phosphorylate tubulin, 2 μl of COS-1 cell lysates was incubated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, ∼1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 5 μm tubulin for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were quenched by addition of SDS sample buffer and incubation for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were then electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and gels were fixed in 0.7 m trichloroacetic acid, 0.14 m 5′-sulfosalicylic acid for 10 min, washed twice in 50% ethanol, 16% acetic acid for 10 min, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Tubulin bands were excised and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Data were analyzed and plotted using GraphPad Prism. For both rhodopsin and tubulin phosphorylation, cell lysates containing GRK5-GFP were directly compared with lysates containing non-tagged GRK5 to demonstrate that the C-terminally fused GFP does not drastically inhibit kinase activity. Cell lysates containing GRK5-GFP and GRK5 phosphorylated rhodopsin at 11.9 ± 1.1 (n = 8) pmol of phosphate/min/mg of protein and 16.7 ± 1.9 (n = 8) pmol of phosphate/min/mg of protein, respectively. Cell lysates containing GRK5-GFP and GRK5 phosphorylated tubulin at 18.6 ± 2.4 (n = 3) pmol of phosphate/min/mg of protein and 35.3 ± 3.1 (n = 3) pmol of phosphate/min/mg of protein, respectively. Thus, the relative activity of GRK5-GFP to non-tagged GRK5 is 0.71 and 0.53 for phosphorylation of rhodopsin and tubulin, respectively. Autophosphorylation of GRK5—To determine the ability of wt and mutant GRK5-GFP to undergo autophosphorylation, 2 μl of COS-1 cell lysates was incubated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, ∼1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP with or without 20 μg of crude soybean phosphatidylcholine (Sigma) for 2 min at 30 °C. Reactions were quenched by addition of SDS sample buffer and incubation for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were then electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and gels were fixed in 0.7 m trichloroacetic acid, 0.14 m 5′-sulfosalicylic acid for 10 min, washed twice in 50% ethanol, 16% acetic acid for 10 min, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Prediction of an Amphipathic Helical Membrane Binding Motif in the C Terminus of GRK5—Previous deletion mutagenesis identified amino acids 552-562 of GRK5 as critical for phospholipid binding and PM localization (12Pronin A.N. Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31510-31518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Moreover, this C-terminal region of GRK5 (Fig. 1A) is rich in basic amino acids that may function to interact with negatively charged phospholipid membranes (12Pronin A.N. Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31510-31518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Pitcher J.A. Fredericks Z.L. Stone W.C. Premont R.T. Stoffel R.H. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24907-24913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In this study, we note that all secondary structure programs tested (16Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar) strongly predict an alpha-helical structure for this region, minimally amino acids 549-557 of GRK5 (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the predicted helical region by a helical wheel or helical net projection (17Heximer S.P. Lim H. Bernard J.L. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14195-14203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and C) reveals an amphipathicity for this membrane-targeting region. A hydrophobic patch, consisting of Leu550, Leu551, Leu554, and Phe555, lies on one face of the helix (Fig. 1). The other side of the helix consists mostly of hydrophilic residues, and a number of the basic residues are predicted to surround the hydrophobic patch. Thus, an amphipathic helical membrane binding motif, similar to that proposed recently for several other proteins (17Heximer S.P. Lim H. Bernard J.L. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14195-14203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18Chen C. Seow K.T. Guo K. Yaw L.P. Lin S.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), is predicted to exist within amino acids 546-565 in GRK5. The hydrophobic residues can directly insert into membrane lipids, while the surrounding positively charged amino acids would further enhance membrane binding by interacting with acidic phospholipids. Amino Acids 546-565 of GRK5 Are Sufficient for PM Localization—To examine the C-terminal membrane-targeting domain of GRK5 in more detail, amino acids 546-565 were fused to GFP, and subcellular localization of GFP-tagged proteins was determined by confocal microscopy of live cells (Fig. 2). When GFP was expressed alone in HEK293 cells, fluorescence was observed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 2A). As described previously (6Barak L.S. Warabi K. Feng X. Caron M.G. Kwatra M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7565-7569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), GRK2-GFP is localized exclusively throughout the cytoplasm in live HEK293 cells (Fig. 2B). In contrast, full-length GRK5 fused to GFP is predominantly localized at the PM with very little in the cytoplasm, as seen by strong fluorescence at the cell periphery (Fig. 2C). Importantly, GFP-546-565, in which amino acids 546-565 of GRK5 are fused to the C terminus of GFP, shows PM localization (Fig. 2D), as clearly distinguished by sharp fluorescence at edges of the cells and at interfaces between cells, indicating that this amino acid sequence can function as an autonomous membrane-targeting signal to direct PM localization of a normally cytoplasmic protein. GFP-546-565 also displays prominent staining throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus, and we cannot rule out that other regions of GRK5 contribute to PM localization. Although PM localization of GFP-546-565 is substantially weaker compared with GRK5-GFP, PM localization of GFP-546-565 is clearly distinguishable from the absence of PM staining observed with GFP alone (Fig. 2A) or mutants of GFP-546-565 described below (Fig. 2, E-H). Significant PM localization of GFP-546-565 is also revealed by quantitative analysis of confocal images (Fig. 3E), as discussed below.Fig. 3Mutation of the hydrophobic patch or surrounding basic residues prevents PM localization of GRK5-GFP. Plasmids expressing full-length GRK5-GFP (A), full-length GRK5(4A)-GFP (B), full-length GRK5(QR)-GFP (C), or full-length GRK5(basic)-GFP (D) were transfected into HEK293 cells. 48 h later GFP fluorescence was visualized by confocal microscopy of live cells, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” E, the histogram shows the distribution of GRK5-GFP (red), GRK5(4A)-GFP (peach), GFP-546-565 (blue), GFP-546-565(4A) (dark green), and GFP (light green) across linear slices of images from single cells. The traces shown represent the average pixel intensity in 15-45 traces from n ≥ 5 cells for each protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mutation of Hydrophobic Patch and Basic Residues Prevents PM Localization of GRK5—To test the prediction of membrane binding mediated by a patch of hydrophobic residues within the 546-565 domain of GRK5 (Fig. 1), subcellular localization of several mutants of GFP-546-565 were examined. When Leu550, Leu551, Leu554, and Phe555 were all mutated together to alanines in the context of GFP-546-565, to generate GFP-546-565(4A), PM localization was abolished (Fig. 2E); GFP-546-565(4A) was only observed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells (Fig. 2E). Moreover, the loss of only two hydrophobic side chains was sufficient to disrupt PM localization of GFP-546-565. GFP-546-565(AALF) (Fig. 2F), in which both Leu550 and Leu551 were replaced with alanines, and GFP-546-565(LLAA) (Fig. 2G), in which both Leu554 and Phe555 were replaced with alanines, failed to show any detectable PM localization when expressed in HEK293 cells. Last, Leu550, Leu551, Leu554, and Phe555 were all replaced simultaneously with hydrophilic glutamines, and the resulting mutant, GFP-546-565(4Q), again failed to display any PM localization (Fig. 2H). Thus, the results are consistent with the prediction that a patch of hydrophobic amino acids is essential for membrane binding of GRK5. The above results utilized the short 546-565 sequence fused to GFP, but it is important to test whether mutation of the hydrophobic patch can disrupt localization of full-length GRK5. In contrast to the almost complete PM localization of GRK5-GFP (Fig. 3A), GRK5(4A)-GFP, in which Leu550, Leu551, Leu554, and Phe555 were all mutated together to alanines in the context of full-length GRK5-GFP, was diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm with no detectable PM localization (Fig. 3B). When Gln552 and Arg553, which in the linear sequence reside within the stretch of hydrophobic residues (Fig. 1), were both replaced with alanines in full-length GRK5-GFP, no effect on subcellular localization was observed; GRK5(QR)GFP retained strong PM localization (Fig. 3C). However, when four basic residues, Lys547, Lys548, Lys556, and Arg557, that are predicted to surround the hydrophobic patch (Fig. 1C) were changed to alanines, the resulting GRK5(basic)-GFP was located throughout the cytoplasm of cells with no detectable PM association (Fig. 3D). Thus, disruption of either the hydrophobic patch or surrounding basic amino acids in the C-terminal 546-565 membrane-targeting sequence is sufficient to prevent PM localization of GRK5. Moreover, the results with full-length GRK5-GFP (Fig. 3) are consistent with membrane binding mediated by an amphipathic helix. PM localization of GRK5-GFP (Figs. 2C and 3A) and GFP-546-565 (Fig. 2D) was confirmed by quantitative analysis of confocal images. The pixel intensity across linear slices of images of single cells was determined and plotted as a histogram to indicate distribution across the cell (Fig. 3E). GRK5-GFP showed sharp peaks at the extremities of the distribution graph with very little pixel intensity in the middle, consistent with predominant localization at the PM and much lesser localization in the interior of the cell. Sharp peaks at the edges were also evident in the histogram trace for GFP-546-565 (Fig. 3E), but a large amount of pixel intensity was also observed in the middle portion of the trace, consistent with the qualitative view of GFP-546-565 localization (Fig. 2D) showing both PM and substantial cytoplasmic and nuclear localization. Analysis of the PM peaks indicated that 56% of overexpressed GRK5-GFP and 9% of overexpressed GFP-546-565 was at the PM in these linear profiles. GFP-546-565(4A) and GFP alone displayed almost identical traces; peaks at the edges corresponding to PM localization were completely absent, and virtually all pixel intensity was found in the middle of histogram, corresponding to a cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution. GRK5(4A)GFP also lacked sharp peaks at the extremities of the distribution plot; instead, GRK5(4A)-GFP displayed wide peaks corresponding to a cytoplasmic distribution and a central dip corresponding to a lack of the protein in the nucleus. Note that the histogram traces clearly show a difference in subcellular distribution between GFP-546-565 and GFP-546-565(4A); GFP-546-565 is partially present at the PM, but GFP-546-565(4A) is not present at the PM. The Hydrophobic Patch Is Necessary for Phosphorylation of Rhodopsin by GRK5—Previous deletion mutagenesis indicated that a GRK5-(1-551) mutant, in which the C-terminal amino acids 552-590 were deleted, showed a substantial decrease compared with full-length GRK5 in its ability to phosphorylate membrane-bound rhodopsin in vitro (12Pronin A.N. Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31510-31518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), a widely used model for GPCR phosphorylation by GRKs (14Kunapuli P. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10209-10212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates from COS-1 cells expressing GRK5-GFP or its mutants were prepared and assayed for their ability to phosphorylate rhodopsin. GRK5-GFP displayed a time-dependent increase in phosphorylation of light-activated rhodopsin, and GRK5(QR)-GFP, a mutant that retained strong PM localization (Fig. 3C), showed a virtually identical profile of rhodopsin phosphorylation (Fig. 4). Mutation of the four basic residues, Lys547, Lys548, Lys556, and Arg557, in GRK5(basic)-GFP, resulted in a reduction in rhodopsin phosphorylation (Fig. 4). Strikingly, GRK5(4A)GFP, in which amino acids in the predicted hydrophobic patch were replaced with alanines, was decreased by 90% in rhodopsin phosphorylation compared with wt GRK5-GFP (Fig. 4). Mutation of the Hydrophobic Patch Reduces GRK5 Autophosphorylation and Phosphorylation of Tubulin—The functional consequences of mutations in the C-terminal membrane binding domain were examined further by phosphorylation of the soluble substrate tubulin (21Carman C.V. Som T. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20308-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). GRK5(QR)-GFP was slightly reduced compared with wt GRK5-GFP in its ability to phosphorylate tubulin (Fig. 5A). However, both mutation of the hydrophobic patch and of the basic residues substantially inhibited tubulin phosphorylation. Tubulin phosphorylation by GRK5(4A)-GFP and GRK5(basic)-GFP was reduced 57 and 46%, respectively, compared with wt GRK5-GFP (Fig. 5A). Because previous studies demonstrated that autophoshorylation of GRK5 is promoted by phospholipid binding, the autophosphorylation of the GRK5-GFP mutants was examined. As described for GRK5 (14Kunapuli P. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10209-10212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pronin A.N. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18273-18280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), autophosphorylation of GRK5-GFP is also dependent upon the addition of phospholipids (Fig. 5B), crude soybean phosphatidylcholine in these experiments. Similarly, phospholipids stimulated the in vitro autophosphorylation of both GRK5(QR)-GFP and GRK5(basic)-GFP (Fig. 5B). In contrast, GRK5(4A)-GFP displayed a significant defect in phospholipid-dependent autophosphorylation (Fig. 5B), although weak autophosphorylation could be detected. These results are consistent with the rhodopsin phosphorylation results (Fig. 4) in that GRK5(4A)-GFP is more severely impaired compared with GRK5(basic)-GFP in catalytic activity that depends on phospholipid binding. Although it was recognized previously that the GRK5 C-terminal membrane-targeting sequence contains a number of basic amino acids (12Pronin A.N. Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31510-31518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14Kunapuli P. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10209-10212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the data presented here reveal novel features of this C-terminal sequence and suggest a mechanism by which this sequence mediates membrane binding. Secondary structure prediction (Fig. 1) suggests that the GRK5 membrane-targeting sequence forms a helix, and the key features of the helix are a patch of hydrophobic amino acids surrounded by a number of basic amino acids. In this model, the hydrophobic amino acids insert into the membrane bilayer, and the basic amino acids are poised to interact with acidic phospholipid head groups. Here we tested the amphipathic helix model for membrane targeting by examining the subcellular localization of GRK5 mutants. Whereas expressed GRK5-GFP was predominantly found at the PM (Figs. 2C and 3A), the GRK5(4A)-GFP mutant, in which the hydrophobic amino acids Leu550, Leu551, Leu554, and Phe555 were all changed to alanines, was not detected at the PM but instead was found throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B). Likewise, substituting the basic amino acids Lys547, Lys548, Lys556, and Arg557 with alanines prevented PM localization of GRK5(basic)-GFP (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that both the hydrophobic patch and the surrounding positive charges contribute to membrane binding of GRK5. Moreover, we demonstrated that the region containing the predicted amphipathic helix of GRK5 is sufficient to function as a membrane-targeting motif; when amino acids 546-565 were fused to GFP, fluorescence was observed at the PM (Fig. 2D). In agreement with this result, previous work (15Thiyagarajan M.M. Bigras E. Van Tol H.H. Hebert T.E. Evanko D.S. Wedegaertner P.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9470-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) demonstrated that replacing the N-terminal palmitoylation site of the G protein αs with amino acids 546-565 of GRK5 was sufficient to restore PM localization of αs, and a peptide corresponding to 547-565 blocked binding of full-length GRK5 to phospholipids in vitro (12Pronin A.N. Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31510-31518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that mutation of only two of the hydrophobic residues in the predicted hydrophobic patch is sufficient to prevent the membrane targeting by 546-565 when fused to GFP (Fig. 2, F and G), further confirming the importance of the hydrophobic patch in this membrane-targeting motif. Interestingly, GFP-546-565 displayed substantially weaker PM localization compared with full-length GRK5; for GFP-546-565, cytoplasmic and nuclear localization was observed in addition to PM localization (Figs. 2D and 3E). Weak PM localization of GFP-546-565 suggests that additional sequences in GRK5 contribute to strong PM localization. Consistent with this proposal, additional binding sites for phospholipids have been identified in the N terminus of GRK (13Pitcher J.A. Fredericks Z.L. Stone W.C. Premont R.T. Stoffel R.H. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24907-24913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 23Noble B. Kallal L.A. Pausch M.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47466-47476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is possible that when removed from the context of the full-length GRK5 sequence and fused to GFP, only a fraction of 546-565 is properly folded and thus able to direct PM localization. Amphipathic helix membrane-targeting motifs have been identified in several other signaling proteins, including the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins RGS2, RGS4, and RGS16 (17Heximer S.P.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). For the RGS proteins, helical models predict a hydrophobic face and a hydrophilic face rich in positive charged amino acids, and, similar to the results described here for GRK5, both the hydrophobic and basic residues contribute to membrane binding. For ARF1, structural studies have verified the amphipathic nature of its N-terminal helix (24Losonczi J.A. Tian F. Prestegard J.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3804-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D.

Biol. 1995; 2: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), where hydrophobic residues in the ARF1 helix lie on one side thus presenting a hydrophobic patch for membrane interaction. The similarity of the predicted amphipathic helix of GRK5 and that of ARF1 is underscored by the presence of a similar hydrophobic amino acid sequence motif, LLXXLF in GRK5 (Fig. 1) and IFXXLFXXLF in ARF1 (20Antonny B. Beraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Moreover, similar to GRK5 and RGS2, RGS4 and RGS16, the ARF1 N-terminal amphipathic helix contains several basic residues, which have been proposed to contribute to membrane binding (20Antonny B.

Interestingly, the N-terminal amphipathic helix of ARF1 mediates guanine nucleotide-dependent reversible membrane targeting. In soluble ARF1-GDP, the amphipathic helix binds intramolecularly to a hydrophobic groove; however, upon GTP binding, conformational changes abolish the intramolecular binding site, allowing the amphipathic N-terminal helix to interact with cellular membranes. We can speculate that conformational changes in GRK5 or interacting proteins (22Pronin A.N. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18273-18280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) might affect the accessibility of its membrane binding amphipathic helix and provide a mechanism for regulating GRK5 membrane binding. Examination of the C-terminal amino acid sequences of GRK4 and GRK6 suggests that they also each contain an amphipathic helix membrane binding domain. As previously noted, GRK4 and GRK6 have numerous basic amino acids in similar positions to those found in the membrane binding domain of GRK5 (12Pronin A.N. Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31510-31518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here, we note that GRK4 and GRK6 also contain the critical hydrophobic motif (Fig. 1A), consistent with the proposal that GRK4 and GRK6 utilize an amphipathic C-terminal helix for membrane binding. Like GRK5, GRK6 has the hydrophobic motif LLXXLF, whereas FFXXLF is found in the predicted amphipathic helix of GRK4 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the sequence identity between GRK4, GRK5, and GRK6 diverges immediately after the predicted C-terminal amphipathic helices, and this difference is coincident with exonexon boundaries (12Pronin A.N. Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31510-31518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). After the amphipathic helix, GRK4 and GRK6A, one of three GRK6 splice variants (27Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Premont R.T. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24328-24334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28Firsov D. Elalouf J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C953-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), contain sites for palmitoylation (Fig. 1A), whereas GRK5 contains numerous serine sites of phosphorylation. On the other hand, the two additional splice variants of GRK6, GRK6B and GRK6C (Fig. 1A), lack cysteine sites of palmitoylation in their C termini (27Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Premont R.T. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24328-24334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) yet retain the predicted amphipathic helix motif. One would predict that palmitoylation combined with a membrane binding helix, as is found in GRK4 and GRK6A, would result in tighter membrane binding compared with GRK5, GRK6B, and GRK6C, which all appear to lack lipid modification, and possibly would promote localization to different membrane microdomains. Last, we demonstrated here that GRK5 mutants that are defective in PM localization also display defects in function. Previous work has led to a model for GRK5 activation in which binding to phospholipid membranes stimulates the autophosphorylation of GRK5, and then both autophosphorylation and membrane binding are required for GRK5 to phosphorylate agonist-activated GPCRs (12Pronin A.N. Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31510-31518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Pitcher J.A. Fredericks Z.L. Stone W.C. Premont R.T. Stoffel R.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10209-10212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with this model, the hydrophobic site mutant GRK5(4A)-GFP was severely inhibited in its ability to autophosphorylate (Fig. 5B) and to phosphorylate light-activated rhodopsin (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, the basic mutant GRK5(basic)-GFP displayed no detectable defect in phospholipid-stimulated autophosphorylation (Fig. 5B) and only a partial inhibition of its ability to phosphorylate membrane-bound rhodopsin (Fig. 4), even though GRK5(basic)-GFP failed to localize to the PM in cells (Fig. 3). Thus, GRK5(4A)-GFP and GRK5(basic)-GFP are similarly defective in PM localization, but the functional analyses demonstrate a difference between GRK5(4A)-GFP and GRK5(basic)-GFP. This may indicate that GRK5(basic)-GFP is able to interact, at least transiently, with phospholipids in vitro sufficiently to promote autophosphorylation and subsequent receptor phosphorylation, and thus the hydrophobic patch may play a greater role than the basic residues of the amphipathic helix in membrane binding of GRK5. Interestingly, both GRK5(4A)-GFP and GRK5(basic)-GFP displayed a decreased ability compared with wt GRK5-GFP to phosphorylate the soluble substrate tubulin (Fig. 5A). The amphipathic helix domain may be positioned to affect the catalytic activity of GRK5 or substrate binding, in addition to mediating interaction with membranes. Consistent with this idea, a previous report noted that phosphorylation of GRK5 by protein kinase C, which likely occurs immediately adjacent to the amphipathic helix membrane binding domain at multiple serines between 562 and 572, did not affect binding of GRK5 to phospholipids but significantly inhibited phosphorylation of soluble substrates by GRK5 (29Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3806-3812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The C terminus of GRK5 appears to be positioned to detect a variety of regulatory inputs that affect GRK5 function and localization (12Pronin A.N. Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31510-31518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In summary, our results have defined a mechanism by which GRK5 binds to cellular membranes. The findings presented here suggest that GRK5 utilizes an amphipathic C-terminal helix consisting of a hydrophobic face and a hydrophilic face to mediate proper localization at the PM. It will be important to determine whether physiological stimuli modulate the ability of this membrane binding domain to direct subcellular localization of GRK5 and the related subfamily members, GRK4 and GRK6.

Gephyrin binds directly to the large cytoplasmic loop located between transmembrane helices three and four of the β-subunit of the glycine receptor and to microtubules, thus promoting glycine receptor (GlyR) anchoring to the cytoskeleton and clustering in the postsynaptic membrane. Besides its structural role, gephyrin is involved in the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor that is essential for all molybdenum-dependent enzymes in mammals. Gephyrin can be divided into an N-terminal trimeric G domain and a C-terminal E domain, which are connected by a central linker region. Here we have studied the in vitro interaction of gephyrin and its domains with the large cytoplasmic loop of the GlyR β-sub-unit (GlyRβ-loop). Binding of gephyrin to the GlyR is exclusively mediated by the E domain, and the binding site was mapped to one of its sub-domains (residues 496–654). By using isothermal titration calorimetry, a high affinity (Kd = 0.2–0.4 μm) and low affinity (Kd = 11–30 μm) binding site for the GlyRβ-loop was found on holo-gephyrin and the E domain, respectively, with a binding stoichiometry of two GlyRβ-loops per E domain in both cases.

Binding of the GlyRβ-loop does not change the oligomeric state of either full-length gephyrin or the isolated E domain. Efficient transmission of synaptic signals in the central nervous system is dependent on high local concentrations of neurotransmitter ion channels in the postsynaptic membrane of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Glycine is an important inhibitory neurotransmitter, and its postsynaptic receptors are an essential component of inhibitory nerve terminals (1Kneussel M. Betz H.

Thomas L. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7394-7398Google Scholar). Crucial for proper functioning of GlyRs is their clustering that generates a high packing density of neuroreceptors in the postsynaptic membrane. Gephyrin, a highly expressed neuronal protein, was found to co-localize with glycine (5Schmitt B. Knaus P. Becker C.M. Betz H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 805-811Google Scholar, 6Prior P. Schmitt B. Grenningloh G. Pribilla I. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Maulet Y. Werner P. Langosch D. Kirsch J. Betz H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1161-1170Google Scholar) and GABAA receptors (7Essrich C. Lorez M. Benson J.A.

Neurol. 1995; 357: 1-14Google Scholar). Gephyrin is crucial for the clustering of both types of inhibitory neuroreceptors (9Kirsch J. Wolters I. Triller A. Betz H. Nature. 1993; 366: 745-748Google Scholar) and anchors these receptors to the subsynaptic cytoskeleton. A direct binding of gephyrin to microtubules was shown (10Kirsch J. Langosch D. Prior P. Littauer U.Z. Schmitt B. Betz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22242-22245Google Scholar), which is possibly mediated by a “tau” motif (11Ramming M. Kins S. Werner N. Hermann A. Betz H. Kirsch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10266-10271Google Scholar). So far no direct interaction with microfilaments has been demonstrated, but pharmacological studies indicate a function of actin filaments in determining the cluster size (12Kirsch J. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4148-4156Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising that binding of gephyrin to key regulators of microfilament dynamics such as profilin I, neuronal profilin IIa, and microfilament adaptors of the Mena/VASP family including neuronal Mena has been reported recently (13Giesemann T. Schwarz G. Navrotzki R. Berhörster K. Rothkegel M. Schlüter K. Schrader N. Schindelin H. Mendel R.R. Kirsch J. Jockusch B.M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8330-8339Google Scholar). The binding site of gephyrin on GlyR has been mapped to a stretch of 18 amino acids located within the large cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane helices three and four of the GlyR β-subunit (GlyRβ-loop) (14Meyer G. Kirsch J. Betz H. Langosch D. Neuron. 1995; 15: 563-572Google Scholar), but the binding site on gephyrin is not known. Based on site-directed mutagenesis of the identified GlyR peptide, the nature of this interaction is considered to be hydrophobic (15Kneussel M. Hermann A. Kirsch J. Betz H. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1323-1326Google Scholar). A model for the gephyrin-mediated formation of GlyR clusters during synaptogenesis has been proposed (16Kirsch J. Betz H. Nature. 1998; 392: 717-720Google Scholar). The release of glycine from a pre-synaptic terminal leads to a depolarizing Cl- efflux that activates Ca2+ channels in the postsynaptic membrane. The resulting Ca2+ influx initiates gephyrin clustering and subsequent formation of glycineric postsynaptic membrane specializations. Additional regulatory or modifying factors for efficient gephyrin-mediated GlyR and GABAA receptor clustering were identified in recent years. Gephyrin was found to interact with a number of proteins that are involved in diverse cellular processes, such as the translational regulator RAFT1, a member of the rapamycin-sensitive signaling pathway, the neuronal guanine nucleotide exchange factor collybistin (17Kins S. Betz H. Kirsch J. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 22-29Google Scholar) which acts on small G proteins of the Rho/Rac family, the GABAA receptor associated protein GABARAP (18Kneussel M. Haverkamp S. Fuhrmann J.C. Wang H. Wassle H. Olsen R.W. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8594-8599Google Scholar), and a component of motor proteins, the dynein light chain (19Fuhrmann J.C. Kins S. Rostaing P. El Far O. Kirsch J. Sheng M. Triller A. Betz H. Kneussel M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5393-5402Google Scholar). Gephyrin expression is not restricted to neuronal tissues. Transcripts are also found in liver, lung, kidney, heart, and muscle (6Prior P. Schmitt B. Grenningloh G. Pribilla I. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Maulet Y. Werner P. Langosch D. Kirsch J. Betz H.

In addition, alternative splicing results in more than 10 different gephyrin transcripts as found in rat (6Prior P. Schmitt B. Grenningloh G. Pribilla I. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Maulet Y. Werner P. Langosch D. Kirsch J. Betz H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1161-1170Google Scholar, 20Meier J. De Chaldee M. Triller A. Vannier C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 566-577Google Scholar), mouse (11Ramming M.

The primary structure of gephyrin (6Prior P. Schmitt B. Grenningloh G. Pribilla I. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Maulet Y. Werner P. Langosch D. Kirsch J. Betz H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1161-1170Google Scholar) shows strong homology to bacterial and eukaryotic proteins involved in the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor (Moco). Moco forms the catalytic center of all molybdenum-containing enzymes with the sole exception of nitrogenase. Gephyrin features two conserved domains, an N-terminal G domain (Geph-G) and a C-terminal E domain (Geph-E), which are homologous to Escherichia coli MogA and MoeA, respectively. Both domains are connected by a third central domain (Geph-C), which has a length of 160–200 residues depending on the gephyrin splice variant. It has been demonstrated that besides its function in neuroreceptor clustering, gephyrin indeed catalyzes the final step of Moco biosynthesis, the attachment of molybdenum to the pyranopterin dithiolene precursor (22Stallmeyer B. Schwarz G. Schulze J. Nerlich A. Reiss J. Kirsch J. Mendel R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1333-1338Google Scholar). A loss of gephyrin in mice (23Feng G. Tintrup H. Kirsch J. Nichol M.C. Kuhse J. Betz H. Sanes J.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1321-1324Google Scholar) or humans (24Reiss J. Gross-Hardt S. Christensen E. Schmidt P. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 208-213Google Scholar) results in Moco deficiency, a severe metabolic disorder for which until now no therapy is available (25Johnson J.L. Duran M. Scriver C. Beaudet A. Sly W. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 3163-3177Google Scholar). Structural information on gephyrin is currently only available for the G domain (26Schwarz G. Schrader N. Mendel R.R. Hecht H.J. Schindelin H. J. Mol.

The crystal structure of the E. coli MoeA protein, which is homologous to Geph-E, revealed a dimer consisting of two elongated monomers. Each monomer is composed of four distinct domains that in the following discussion will be referred to as the sub-domains of Geph-E. The E domain of the homologous plant protein Cnx1 (28Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Google Scholar) also dimerizes, and Geph-E has been postulated to be dimeric as well (29Xiang S. Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Structure. 2001; 9: 299-310Google Scholar, 30Schrag J.D. Huang W. Sivaraman J. Smith C. Plamondon J. Larocque R. Matte A. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 419-431Google Scholar). Based on the distinct oligomerization potentials of the G and E domains, the formation of a hexagonal gephyrin scaffold located underneath the postsynaptic membrane was suggested (29Xiang S. Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Structure. 2001; 9: 299-310Google Scholar), which would allow efficient clustering of large numbers of GlyRs (1Kneussel M. Betz H. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 429-435Google Scholar). The formation of these clusters might be either dependent on other gephyrin-binding partners (13Giesemann T. Schwarz G. Navrotzki R. Berhörster K.

The central domain of gephyrin has been postulated to mediate many of the interactions between gephyrin and its binding partners (1Kneussel M. Betz H. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 429-435Google Scholar), because it is basically absent in other eukaryotic homologs (32Stallmeyer B. Nerlich A. Schiemann J. Brinkmann H. Mendel R.R. Plant J. 1995; 8: 751-762Google Scholar) and subjected, at least in humans, to splicing with high complexity in neuronal tissues (21Rees M.I. Harvey K. Ward H. White J.H. Evans L.I. Duguid I.C. Hsu C.C. Coleman S.L. Miller J. Baer K. Waldvogel H.J. Gibbon F. Smart T.G. Owen M.J. Harvey R.J. Snell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24688-24696Google Scholar). There is, however, no direct experimental evidence for its participation in any of the binding interactions. Here we present the biochemical characterization of gephyrin, its domains, and their in vitro interaction with a 49-residue-long peptide, corresponding to residues 400–448 of the large cytoplasmic loop of the GlyR β-subunit (GlyRβ-loop). Our studies demonstrate that this interaction involves a high and a low affinity binding site and is mediated by sub-domain III of the E domain of gephyrin. Cloning and Expression of Gephyrin Constructs and the GlyRβ-loop in E. coli—For recombinant expression in E. coli, the rat gephyrin cDNA encoding the P2 splice variant (P2, residues 1–736 of P1 variant and 19 residues of C4 cassette (6Prior P. Schmitt B. Grenningloh G. Pribilla I. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Maulet Y. Werner P. Langosch D. Kirsch J. Betz H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1161-1170Google Scholar)) and gephyrin G domain with the central domain (Geph-GC, residues 1–310) were generated by PCR and cloned as KpnI/KpnI fragments into the vector pQE-30 (Qiagen). The gephyrin G domain was expressed using the pQE-60Geph-G clone described earlier (26Schwarz G. Schrader N. Mendel R.R. Hecht H.J. Schindelin H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 405-418Google Scholar). The sequence encoding the E domain (Geph-E, residues 318–736) was PCR-cloned into the NcoI/PstI sites of pTWIN2 (New England Biolabs). For the expression of a chimeric gephyrin P2 with an additional E domain (P2-EE), a PCR-derived EcoRV/EcoRV fragment of Geph-E (encoding residues 307–735) was inserted into the EcoRV site of the central domain (between residues 307 and 308). The gephyrin-binding motif (residues 400–448 (14Meyer G. Kirsch J. Betz H. Langosch D. Neuron. 1995; 15: 563-572Google Scholar)) of the GlyRβ-loop (GenBank™ AJ310839, nucleotides 1132–1278) was PCR-cloned into the NdeI/XmaI site of pTYB2 (New England Biolabs). The large cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane helices 3 and 4 of the GlyR α-subunit (GenBank™ AY129229, nucleotides 1048–1261) was PCR-cloned into the NdeI/XmaI site of pTYB2. All gephyrin forms except Geph-E were expressed in E. coli DL41 (CGSC 7177, Genetic Stock Centre, Yale, New Haven, CT) as His6-tagged proteins. Geph-E was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene) as an intein fusion protein with a chitin-binding domain for affinity purification. Cells were grown in 2× YT-enriched LB medium at 22 °C (P2, P2-EE, and Geph-GC), 30 °C (Geph-E), or 37 °C (Geph-G) and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside at a cell density of A600 = 0.3–0.8. Cells were harvested after 16–24 h of expression. GlyRβ- and GlyRα-loops were expressed as intein fusion proteins (GlyRβ-loop-intein and GlyRα-loop-intein) in the E. coli strain BL21 (Stratagene). Cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside at a density of A600 = 0.5 and were harvested 4 h after induction. Purification of Recombinant Proteins—For protein purification, cells were resuspended in the appropriate lysis buffer, passed twice through a French pressure cell, sonicated, and centrifuged. All His6-tagged gephyrin forms were initially purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (Qiagen) at 4 °C according to the instructions of the manufacturer with the sole exception that all buffers used for this and all subsequent purification steps contained 5 mm DTT. Protein-containing fractions were collected, and buffer was exchanged to Q-buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) using either PD10 desalting columns (Amersham Biosciences) or dialysis. Geph-E was purified at 4 °C using a chitin column according to the instructions of the IMPACT-TWIN protein expression and purification system (New England Biolabs). Cleavage of Geph-E from the N-terminal intein fusion was induced by a pH and temperature shift (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, T = 25 °C) and subsequent incubation for 24–48 h. After affinity purification, the different gephyrin forms were further purified by anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography. Proteins were loaded onto a Source Q15 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Q-buffer and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (50–500 mm). After concentrating the gephyrin-containing fractions, the proteins were applied to a 26/60 Superdex 200 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with SD buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 250 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). Pure fractions were pooled, concentrated to 8–60 mg/ml, flash-frozen in 20-μl aliquots, and stored in liquid nitrogen. GlyRβ- and GlyRα-loops were purified at 4 °C as intein fusion proteins according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). For co-precipitation experiments, GlyRβ- and GlyRα-loop-intein-coated chitin beads were equilibrated with binding buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) and stored as 50% slurries at 4 °C for 2 weeks. During that time no significant self-cleavage of the thioester bond between the GlyR loops and the intein was observed. For other binding experiments (size exclusion chromatography and ITC) the GlyRβ-loop was cleaved off the intein-chitin binding domain by incubation with 50 mm DTT for 24 h. The eluted GlyRβ-loop was concentrated and loaded onto a 26/60 Superdex 200 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with SD buffer. GlyRβ-loop-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated to 4–7 mg/ml, and stored at -80 °C in 20-μl aliquots after flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)—DLS experiments were performed at 25 °C with a DYNAPRO instrument (Protein Solutions) using 15 μl of protein solution. Protein concentrations were adjusted to yield a count rate of 105–106 at 100% laser power. For each experiment, 30 individual measurements of 10-s acquisitions were collected and analyzed using the program DYNAMICS (Protein Solutions). In Vitro Translation—For in vitro translation experiments, pcDNA3-based gephyrin constructs described earlier (13Giesemann T. Schwarz G. Navrotzki R. Berhörster K. Rothkegel M. Schlüter K. Schrader N. Schindelin H. Mendel R.R. Kirsch J. Jockusch B.M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8330-8339Google Scholar) were used. Additional constructs for the expression of gephyrin P2 variants with deletions of Geph-E sub-domains (Fig. 1) were PCR-cloned into the KpnI/KpnI site of pcDNA3 (Promega). Plasmid pcDNA-P2-EI/II expresses sub-domains I and II (residues 1–496), pcDNA-P2-EIII sub-domain III (residues 1–341 and 497–654), and P2-EIV sub-domain IV (residues 1–315 and 655–736) of P2 gephyrin. Proteins were synthesized by in vitro transcription/translation and labeled with [35S]Met using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). GlyRβ-loop Co-precipitation and Dot Overlay Experiments—Chitin beads (2.5–5 μl) coated with the GlyRβ-loop-intein fusion (GlyRβ-loop-intein beads), coated only with intein (intein beads) or coated with the GlyRα-loop-intein fusion (GlyRα-loop-intein beads), were incubated with 200–400 pmol of the different gephyrin forms in a total volume of 50 μl of binding buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min, washed five times with 500 μl of binding buffer, and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For the estimation of binding affinities, different amounts of protein (1.5–28 μm) were subjected to a GlyRβ-loop co-precipitation assay. Band intensities of the protein in the pellet (bound) and supernatant (unbound) were measured densitometrically (HEROLAB EasyWin32, version 3.99.199) after Coomassie Blue staining of the SDS-PAGE. Intein beads were used as negative control. Dot overlays of different in vitro translated gephyrin forms were performed as described before (13Giesemann T. Schwarz G. Navrotzki R. Berhörster K. Rothkegel M. Schlüter K. Schrader N. Schindelin H. Mendel R.R. Kirsch J. Jockusch B.M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8330-8339Google Scholar) using 200–600 pmol of immobilized GlyRβ-loop. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Prior to all ITC experiments, the gephyrin and GlyRβ-loop samples were extensively dialyzed against large volumes of identical buffer (250 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0) at 4 °C overnight. Purified GlyRβ-loop was titrated as the ligand into the sample cell containing either gephyrin P2 or Geph-E. The cell volume was 1.42 ml, and gephyrin concentrations varied from 30 to 50 μm for gephyrin P2 and Geph-E. GlyRβ-loop (at concentrations of 0.5–1.0 mm) was titrated in 3-μl injections (90 injections total) to reach a final molar ratio of GlyRβ-loop to gephyrin ranging from 2:1 to 4:1 at the end of the experiment. At least three experiments were performed with full-length gephyrin and Geph-E, and all experiments were performed at 25 °C. Blank injections of titrant into the buffer were performed to estimate the heat of injection, mixing, and dilution and revealed heat effects of less than 2% of the gephyrin-GlyRβ-loop binding heat. For every injection the binding enthalpy was calculated by integration of the peak area using the ORIGIN software. The heat change after each injection was related to the calorimetric enthalpy of binding ΔHcal and was also dependent on the stoichiometry of the gephyrin-GlyRβ-loop complex. The association constant Ka and additional binding parameters (binding stoichiometry, enthalpy, and entropy) were obtained through curve fitting with ORIGIN. Size Exclusion Chromatography—For determination of the binding stoichiometry between gephyrin and the GlyRβ-loop, 1.0–1.5 nmol of gephyrin P2 and Geph-E were incubated with 4–6 nmol of GlyRβ-loop in a total volume of 20 μl for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were loaded onto Micro Bio-Spin P30 columns (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with SE buffer (250 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and eluted stepwise in 20-μl fractions by centrifugation for 1 min at 1000 × g. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (gephyrin P2 and Geph-E) and Tricine-PAGE (GlyRβ-loop), respectively. The Coomassie-stained protein bands were analyzed densitometrically as described above. In order to quantify the measured band intensities, known amounts of protein were loaded on the same gel and used for calibration. Analytical size exclusion chromatography was performed using a HR10/30 Superdex 200 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with SD buffer. 2–10 nmol of gephyrin P2, Geph-E, gephyrin P2-EE, and purified GlyRβ-loop were either incubated separately or as equimolar complexes with the GlyRβ-loop in 100 μl for 30 min at room temperature and loaded onto the column. Absorption of the eluting proteins was monitored at 280 nm, and the peak area of the GlyRβ-loop elution was compared with runs containing the same amount of peptide in the absence or presence of equimolar amounts of binding partner. The Superdex 200 column was calibrated with thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa) in order to estimate the apparent molecular mass of the analyzed proteins. Peak areas were integrated using the program UNICORN (Amersham Biosciences). Homology Modeling of Geph-E—By using the SWISS-PDBVIEWER (www.expasy.ch/spdbv), a structural model of Geph-E was generated based on the structure of E. coli MoeA (29Xiang S. Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Structure. 2001; 9: 299-310Google Scholar). When the resulting Geph-E model was superimposed onto MoeA, an overall root mean square deviation of 0.83 Å was obtained for 387 of 425 C-α atoms that is similar to the experimentally observed deviation of 1.11 Å between Geph-G and E. coli MogA (26Schwarz G. Schrader N. Mendel R.R. Hecht H.J. Schindelin H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 405-418Google Scholar). In Vitro Binding of Gephyrin to the GlyRβ-loop—The clustering of GlyRs in the postsynaptic membrane is dependent on the interaction with gephyrin and the simultaneous binding to microtubules. In order to identify and analyze the GlyR-binding site on gephyrin, we have recombinantly expressed a 49-amino acid-long peptide of the GlyRβ-loop (residues 400–448) as an intein fusion protein. The coupled peptide was either directly used for co-precipitation experiments or cleaved off and further purified. For binding studies the P2 splice variant of gephyrin (insertion of the C4 cassette in the central domain (6Prior P. Schmitt B. Grenningloh G. Pribilla I. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Maulet Y. Werner P. Langosch D. Kirsch J. Betz H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1161-1170Google Scholar)), the G domain (Geph-G), the G domain with the central domain (Geph-GC), and the E domain (Geph-E) were expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 2, A and B). In order to simulate a form of gephyrin that might be present in the proposed gephyrin clusters (1Kneussel M. Betz H. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 429-435Google Scholar, 29Xiang S. Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Structure. 2001; 9: 299-310Google Scholar), we have constructed a chimeric protein containing a second E domain fused to the C terminus of gephyrin (P2-EE). As a bridging segment between the tandem E domains, 20 residues of the C-terminal end of Geph-C (residues 307–326) were incorporated between both E domains (Fig. 1). Co-precipitation with immobilized GlyRβ-loop (Fig. 2A) revealed a strong binding of gephyrin P2, Geph-E, and P2-EE to the GlyRβ-loop, where 50–80% of the loaded protein was detected in the pellet. In contrast, virtually no binding to the GlyRβ-loop was found for the G domain without (Geph-G) or with the central domain (Geph-GC). A control experiment using intein-coated chitin beads showed only very weak bands in the pellet fraction for all five proteins used in the assay (Fig. 2B). The observed unspecific binding corresponds to less than one-tenth of the intensity found for GlyRβ-loop precipitation with all E domain-containing gephyrin forms. In case of Geph-G and Geph-GC, the amount of sedimented protein was similar in both experiments, indicating a weak unspecific co-precipitation with the intein-chitin-binding fusion, which was present in both experiments. Another control experiment was performed to exclude unspecific binding of the hydrophilic and positively charged GlyRβ-loop by using the corresponding but somewhat larger cytoplasmic loop of the α1-subunit of GlyR (GlyRα-loop). Residues 346–417 of GlyRα-loop were expressed and purified similar to the GlyRβ-loop and subjected to pull-down experiments (Fig. 2C). In line with previous studies (14Meyer G. Kirsch J. Betz H. Langosch D. Neuron. 1995; 15: 563-572Google Scholar), neither gephyrin P2 nor any of its individual domains were found to bind to the GlyRα-loop (Fig. 2C); only a slight background as seen with the intein beads alone was observed (Fig. 2B). These experiments demonstrate that binding experiments involving the GlyRβ-loop faithfully reproduce the specific interaction between the GlyR and gephyrin. In addition, GlyRβ-loop co-sedimentation experiments were also performed in buffers with different ionic strengths varying from 0 to 1 m NaCl; however, no significant effect on the binding of gephyrin was observed (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the C-terminal E-domain of gephyrin interacts with GlyR. To verify the results of the co-sedimentation assay, dot overlay experiments were performed by using in vitro translated"
https://openalex.org/W2139126784,"Studies of evolved massive stars indicate that they form in a clustered mode. During the earliest evolutionary stages, these regions are embedded within their natal cores. Here we present high-spatial-resolution interferometric dust continuum observations disentangling the cluster-like structure of a young massive star-forming region. The derived protocluster mass distribution is consistent with the stellar initial mass function. Thus, fragmentation of the initial massive cores may determine the initial mass function and the masses of the final stars. This implies that stars of all masses can form via accretion processes, and coalescence of intermediate-mass protostars appears not to be necessary."

To determine whether specific serine phosphorylation sites within the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit are involved in the Na+,K+-ATPase responses to PTH, we examined the effect of PTH in opossum kidney cells stably transfected with wild type rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit (WT), serine 11 to alanine mutant α1-subunit (S11A), or serine 18 to alanine mutant α1-subunit (S18A). PTH increased phosphorylation and endocytosis of the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit into clathrin-coated vesicles in cells transfected with WT and S18A rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunits. PTH did not increase the level of phosphorylation or stimulate translocation of Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunits into clathrin-coated vesicles in cells transfected with the S11A mutant. PTH inhibited ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake and Na+,K+-ATPase activity (ouabain-sensitive ATP hydrolysis) in WT- and S18A-transfected opossum kidney cells but not in S11A-transfected cells. Pretreatment of the cells with the PKC inhibitors and ERK inhibitor blocked PTH inhibition of 86Rb uptake, Na+,K+-ATPase activity, α1-subunit phosphorylation, and endocytosis in WT and S18A cells. Consistent with the notion that ERK phosphorylates Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit, ERK was shown to be capable of causing phosphorylation of Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit immunoprecipitated from WT and S18A but not from S11A-transfected cells. These results suggest that PTH regulates Na+,K+-ATPase by PKC and ERK-dependent α1-subunit phosphorylation and that the phosphorylation requires the expression of a serine at the 11 position of the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2160500503,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) contributes to vascular disease by stimulating the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Since amino acids are required for cell growth, the present study examined the effect of PDGF on system L amino acid transport, which is the predominant cellular pathway for the uptake of essential amino acids. System L amino acid transport was monitored by measuring the uptake of L-leucine. Treatment of SMCs with PDGF stimulated L-leucine transport in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and this was associated with a selective increase in LAT1 mRNA and protein. PDGF failed to induce the expression of the other system L transport proteins, LAT2 and the heavy chain of the 4F2 cell surface antigen. The induction of LAT1 by PDGF was dependent on de novo RNA and protein synthesis and on mTOR activity. Serum, thrombin, and angiotensin II likewise stimulated L-leucine transport by inducing LAT1 expression. Inhibition of system L amino acid transport by the model substrate 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid blocked growth factor-mediated SMC proliferation and induced SMC apoptosis, whereas it had no effect on quiescent cells. These results demonstrate that growth factors stimulate system L amino acid transport by inducing LAT1 gene expression and that system L amino acid transport is essential for SMC proliferation and survival. The capacity of vascular mitogens to induce LAT1 expression may represent a basic mechanism by which tho acid transport * apoptosis"

This differentiation therapy propelled interest in uncovering molecular mechanisms for RA-dependent APL differentiation. We previously identified the ubiquitin-activating enzyme-E1-like protein (UBE1L) as an RA-regulated target gene in APL that triggers PML/RARα degradation and apoptosis. This study reports that conjugation of the ubiquitin-like species, interferon-stimulated gene, 15-kDa protein (ISG15), also occurs during RA-induced APL differentiation. Knock-down of UBE1L expression inhibited this conjugation. RA treatment of APL and other RA-responsive leukemic cells induced expression of UBE1L and ISG15 as well as intracellular ISG15 conjugates. Notably, ISG15 conjugation did not occur in RA-resistant NB4-R1 APL cells. Induction of UBE1L and ISG15 along with ISG15 conjugation in RA-sensitive NB4-S1 APL cells were detected following treatment with specific retinoids and type I interferon (IFN). UBE1L and ISG15 mRNAs were co-expressed in normal human tissues that were examined. In contrast, UBE1L mRNA expression was markedly repressed in several cancer cell lines. A physical association was found between UBE1L and ISG15 in vivo. This required the conserved diglycine motif in the carboxyl terminus of ISG15. Targeting UBE1L expression with small inhibitory RNA or small hairpin RNA inhibited IFN and RA-induced ISG15 conjugation. Formation of ISG15 conjugates through induction of an activating enzyme represents a novel pharmacologic mechanism for regulation of this ubiquitin-related species. Taken together, the observed rela tionship between expression of UBE1L and ISG15, their physical association and coordinate regulation, and induced ISG15 conjugation during leukemic cell differentiation implicate an important role for these proteins in retinoid response.

Ronchetti S. Zhong S. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 266-272Google Scholar). PML/RARα also inhibits retinoid signaling by acting as a dominant-negative retinoid nuclear receptor (5Pitha-Rowe I. Petty W. Kitareewan S. Dmitrovsky E. Leukemia. 2003; 17: 1723-1730Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand, PML/RARα can dimerize (11Perez A. Kastner P. Sethi S. Lutz Y. Reibel C. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3171-3182Google Scholar, 12Lin R.J. Evans R.M. Mol.

Ectopic UBE1L expression triggered PML/RARα degradation, and retroviral transduction of UBE1L into NB4 APL cells rapidly triggered leukemic cell death even in the absence of RA treatment. These findings directly implicated UBE1L as a retinoid target gene in APL (19Kitareewan S. Pitha-Rowe I. Sekula D. Lowrey C.H. Nemeth M.J. Golub T.R. Freemantle S.J. Dmitrovsky E. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Sequence homology between activating enzymes supports the hypothesis that this family of enzymes, which includes the activating enzymes for ubiquitin, small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO), and NEDD8, engage similar mechanisms during conjugate activation. ISG15, originally identified as an interferon-induced species (22Farrell P.J. Broeze R.J. Lengyel P. Nature. 1979; 279: 523-525Google Scholar), contains tandem ubiquitin homology domains and a carboxyl-terminal LRGG motif conserved between ubiquitin-like protein modifiers (23Haas A.L. Ahrens P. Bright P.M. Ankel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11315-11323Google Scholar). ISG15 forms covalent conjugates with intracellular proteins following diverse signals such as type I IFN treatment (24Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8408-8419Google Scholar) and bacterial (25Liu M. Reimschuessel R. Hassel B.A. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 298: 129-139Google Scholar) or viral challenges (20Yuan W. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 362-371Google Scholar). The recent observation that serpin 2a (26Hamerman J.A. Hayashi F. Schroeder L.A. Gygi S.P. Haas A.L. Hampson L. Coughlin P. Aebersold R. Aderem A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2415-2423Google Scholar), phospholipase 1γC, JAK1, ERK1, and STAT1 (27Malakhov M.P. Kim K.I. Malakhova O.A. Jacobs B.S. Borden E.C. Zhang D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16608-16613Google Scholar) are targets for ISG15 conjugation indicated a role for ISG15 in pathways critical for signaling diverse second messenger pathways or cellular responses (28Malakhova O.A. Yan M. Malakhov M.P. Yuan Y. Ritchie K.J. Kim K.I. Peterson L.F. Shuai K. Zhang D.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 455-460Google Scholar). The reported induction of UBE1L expression during RA-mediated APL differentiation (19Kitareewan S. Pitha-Rowe I. Sekula D. Lowrey C.H. Nemeth M.J. Golub T.R. Freemantle S.J. Dmitrovsky E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3806-3811Google Scholar) indicated that retinoid treatment might also promote ISG15 conjugation. The aim of this study was to explore comprehensively the coordinate regulation and potential physical association of UBE1L and ISG15 in vivo and then to examine the relationship between induction of ISG15 conjugation and RA-mediated leukemic cell differentiation. Retinoid-sensitive and -resistant leukemic cells were independently examined. The direct involvement of UBE1L in ISG15 conjugation was studied through loss of function experiments using small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) as well as small hairpin RNA (shRNA) to target UBE1L expression. The findings reported here established that siRNA- or shRNA-mediated repression of UBE1L inhibits induction of ISG15 conjugation by RA or IFN. A role for UBE1L and ISG15 conjugation beyond leukemia is consistent with results from mRNA cell and tissue arrays where UBE1L and ISG15 were often detected as expressed in the same human cells and tissues. Yet, repression of UBE1L mRNA was evident in several human cancer cell lines. As will be discussed, these results build upon and extend prior work implicating UBE1L as a tumor suppressor. Taken together, these findings implicate this previously unrecognized, retinoid induction of UBE1L and ISG15 conjugation as having important functional roles in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. Cell Culture—NB4, U937, and THP-1 leukemic cell lines were individually cultured in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. The NB4-S1 and NB4-R1 APL cell lines are RA-sensitive and -resistant APL cell lines, respectively (29Nason-Burchenal K. Maerz W. Albanell J. Allopenna J. Martin P. Moore M.A. Dmitrovsky E. Differentiation. 1997; 61: 321-331Google Scholar). The BEAS-2B immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line was cultured in serum-free LHC-9 medium, as described previously (30Lechner J.F. Haugen A. McClendon I.A. Pettis E.W. In Vitro. 1982; 18: 633-642Google Scholar). HeLa S3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cell lines were each cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 using a humidified incubator. Semiquantitative RT-PCR Assays—Logarithmically growing NB4-S1 and NB4-R1 APL cells were independently seeded in the described media at a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml. U937 and THP-1 cells were each seeded in logarithmic growth phase at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. These cell lines were cultured with either 1 μm RA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) or Me2SO (Sigma) as a vehicle control. Total cellular RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Protect Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). Contaminating DNA was removed using a DNA-free kit according to the manufacturer's procedures (Ambion, Austin, TX). The cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA primed with random hexamers and using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (RT) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). PCR amplifications were performed with Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), and expression of each species was compared with β-actin or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression that served as a control. To detect UBE1L, the forward primer was 5′-AGGTGGCCAAGAACTTGGTT-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-CACCACCTGGAAGTCCAACA-3′ (19Kitareewan S. Pitha-Rowe I. Sekula D. Lowrey C.H. Nemeth M.J. Golub T.R. Freemantle S.J. Dmitrovsky E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3806-3811Google Scholar). For ISG15, the forward primer was 5′-GGTGGACAAATGCGACGAAC-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-ATGCTGGTGGAGGCCCTTAG-3′. For β-actin, the forward primer was 5′-GCGGGAAATCGTGCGTGACA-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-AAGGAAGGCTGGAAGAGTGC-3′. For GAPDH, the forward primer was 5′-GGAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCA-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-GACAAGCTTCCCGTTCTCAG-3′. These independent PCR assay reaction products were each size-fractionated by electrophoresis and transferred onto nylon filters (Nytran SuPerCharge, Schleicher & Schuell Bioscience, Inc., Keene, NH), and then selectively hybridized with appropriate radiolabeled probes, as needed to enhance detection of some species. Immunoblot Analyses—Lysates were size-fractionated using SDS-PAGE before transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell Bioscience, Inc., Keene, NH) using previously described techniques (19Kitareewan S. Pitha-Rowe I. Sekula D. Lowrey C.H. Nemeth M.J. Golub T.R. Freemantle S.J. Dmitrovsky E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3806-3811Google Scholar). Independent primary antibodies used were a polyclonal rabbit antibody that recognized the amino terminus of UBE1L (19Kitareewan S. Pitha-Rowe I. Sekula D. Lowrey C.H. Nemeth M.J. Golub T.R. Freemantle S.J. Dmitrovsky E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3806-3811Google Scholar), a polyclonal goat antibody that recognized β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or a murine monoclonal antibody (Berkley Antibody Co., Berkley, CA) that recognized the 6-histidine tag (His6). The primary murine monoclonal antibody that recognized ISG15 was provided by Dr. E. Borden (Cleveland Clinic Foundation). Horse-radish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG were each purchased (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) as was the anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Pharmacologic Treatments—NB4-S1 and NB4-R1 APL cells were independently seeded as already described before treatments at the indicated dosages with RA (Sigma), and the same culture conditions were used for experiments with 9-cis-retinoic acid (Sigma), phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; provided by Dr. M. Sporn, Dartmouth Medical School), rosiglitazone (provided by Dr. M. Sporn), fenretinide (4-HPR) (BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA), IFN A/Dα (Sigma), the triterpenoid CDDO (provided by Dr. M. Sporn), or with Me2SO that served as a vehicle control. Cells were lysed in a modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay. Samples were then subjected to immunoblot analyses using previously described procedures (19Kitareewan S. Pitha-Rowe I. Sekula D. Lowrey C.H. Nemeth M.J. Golub T.R. Freemantle S.J. Dmitrovsky E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3806-3811Google Scholar). Tissue Arrays and Tissue Bank—Multiple Tissue Expression Arrays (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and Multiple Tissue Northern membranes (Clontech) were individually prehybridized in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech) at 65 °C for 30 min. Membranes were hybridized overnight in prehybridization buffer at 65 °C with a dCT32P-radio-labeled 1-kb EcoRI-NcoI UBE1L probe or a radiolabeled probe that contained the full coding region of ISG15 and was isolated from the pcDNA4 vector with EcoRI-XbaI restriction endonuclease digestions. After hybridization, membranes were stringently washed in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50 °C. The Multiple Tissue Expression Array was hybridized to a radiolabeled probe to ubiquitin (Clontech) as a loading control. To confirm and extend these results from the mRNA to protein level of expression, immunoblot analyses for UBE1L were performed on protein isolated from paired normal lung tissues and malignant lung tissues obtained from a lung tumor bank developed at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. The institutional review board reviewed and approved these studies. Purification of the ISG15·UBE1L Complex—BEAS-2B cells were transfected using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed in a buffer containing: 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20 at pH 8. After three freeze-thaw cycles and passage through a 27-gauge syringe to reduce viscosity, lysates were mixed with Ni2+-agarose beads that were prewashed with lysis buffer and blocked for 2 h at room temperature in lysis buffer containing 5 mg/ml bovine albumin. After 2 h of additional incubation, beads were washed with lysis buffer to a final stringency of 20 mm imidazole. Beads were then eluted with SDS loading dye, under reducing conditions. Eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Nytran SuPerCharge, Schleicher & Schuell Bioscience, Inc., Keene, NH), as previously described (19Kitareewan S. Pitha-Rowe I. Sekula D. Lowrey C.H. Nemeth M.J. Golub T.R. Freemantle S.J. Dmitrovsky E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3806-3811Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses were performed using a polyclonal antibody that recognized the amino terminus of UBE1L and monoclonal antibodies that recognized the His6 tag or ISG15, respectively. SiRNA Targeting of UBE1L—Synthetic siRNAs were purchased (Dharmacon Research, Inc., Lafayette, CO) as annealed oligonucleotides and were resuspended in RNase-free H2O. The siRNA duplexes used independently targeted luciferase GL2 as a scrambled control against an unexpressed sequence (siRNA-Control) (31Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Google Scholar); β-actin (siRNA-Actin) (32Harborth J. Elbashir S.M. Bechert K. Tuschl T. Weber K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4557-4565Google Scholar); or UBE1L using the sequence AACUUGUUCUGAUGGGUGUG (siRNA-UBE1L). HeLa S3 cells were transfected with siRNA twice in 24-h intervals using Oligofectamine-based methods (Invitrogen) and previously established techniques (31Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Google Scholar). Total RNA was then isolated, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays were performed using the described independent primers for UBE1L, ISG15, β-actin, or GAPDH. To induce ISG15 conjugation after siRNA transfection, cells were treated with or without IFN A/D α (Sigma) for 24 h. Immunoblot analyses were performed using the described polyclonal antibodies that independently recognized UBE1L or β-actin and the murine mono-clonal antibody that recognized ISG15. shRNA Targeting of UBE1L—The shRNA construct that targeted bases 935–954 of the UBE1L sequence was subcloned into the pSuper-Retro (Oligoengine, Seattle, WA) retroviral vector. A pSuper-Retro vector with a scrambled sequence was used as a control in these experiments (provided by Dr. J. Curtin, Dartmouth Medical School). These retroviral vectors were independently transfected into GP2-293 packaging cells (Clontech) using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and the manufacturer's procedures. Two days after transfection, media were used for viral transduction of NB4-S1 cells in the presence of Polybrene (8 μg/ml) (Sigma). After 24 h, cells were then cultured in fresh media, and 72 h after transduction, cells were selected with puromycin (5 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 72 h to obtain stable transductants. Reduced basal UBE1L expression was detected in transductants by immunoblot analyses for at least 3 weeks after puromycin selection (data not shown). These transductants were then independently treated with or without RA, IFN A/D α, or vehicle control. Induction of UBE1L and ISG15 Expression—The retinoid regulation of UBE1L and ISG15 expression was independently examined in RA-sensitive NB4-S1 cells and in RA-resistant NB4-R1 APL cells as well as in the U937 and THP-1 (data not shown) leukemic cell lines before and after RA treatment. As shown by RT-PCR analyses in Fig. 1, UBE1L and ISG15 mRNA expression increased markedly at 48 h of RA treatment of NB4-S1 APL cells. Induction of ISG15 mRNA was most evident from 24 (data not shown) to 48 h after RA treatment of NB4-S1, U937, and THP-1 (data not shown) leukemic cells. Notably, induction of ISG15 and UBE1L mRNAs was blunted despite RA treatment of NB4-R1 APL cells, as shown in Fig. 1. RA treatment of U937 cells increased UBE1L and ISG15 mRNA expression with kinetics similar to that detected for NB4-S1 cells (data not shown). Similar results were seen following RA treatment of THP-1 cells (data not shown). These findings implicated a role for these species in the retinoid response of leukemic cells. Induction of ISG15 Conjugation—Coordinate regulation of UBE1L and ISG15 mRNA expression following RA treatment of NB4-S1 but not NB4-R1 cells suggested the involvement of ISG15 conjugation in the differentiation program of APL cells. To explore this further, intracellular ISG15 conjugation was examined before and after RA treatment of NB4-S1 cells. Results were compared with findings obtained in the RA-resistant NB4-R1 cell line. Immunoblot analyses revealed that, before RA treatment, ISG15 was not readily detected in these cells. In contrast, following RA treatment, both unconjugated and conjugated ISG15 were prominently induced by 48 h, as displayed in Fig. 2. The pattern of ISG15 conjugates following RA treatment was similar to that observed following IFN-induced conjugation (data not shown). Conjugation of ISG15 occurred after RA treatment along with induction of UBE1L and ISG15 mRNAs. Notably, unconjugated and conjugated ISG15 species were not appreciably induced following RA treatment of NB4-R1 cells as shown in Fig. 2. To examine the pharmacologic regulation of UBE1L expression and ISG15 conjugation, RA-sensitive and -resistant NB4 cells were treated independently with diverse antiproliferative and differentiation-inducing agents, including 9-cis-retinoic acid, a retinoid X receptor (rexinoid) agonist LG100268 (data not shown), a non-classic retinoid (4-HPR), a triterpenoid (CDDO), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonist (rosiglitazone), phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), or IFN A/D α. Of these pharmacologic agents, only 9-cis-retinoic acid and IFN A/D α prominently induced UBE1L, ISG15 expression, and ISG15 conjugation. Induction of UBE1L and ISG15 conjugation was not appreciably observed following 9-cis-retinoic acid treatments of NB4-R1 cells (data not shown). However, IFN A/D α treatment still augmented UBE1L expression and ISG15 conjugation, despite RA resistance of NB4-R1 cells (data not shown). ISG15 and UBE1L Expression Profiles—ISG15 and UBE1L mRNA expression profiles were examined in human tissues and cell lines using tissue expression arrays and independent radiolabeled probes for ISG15 and UBE1L (Fig. 3). ISG15 mRNAs were widely detected across hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tissues and cell lines, with elevated levels detected in specific adult and fetal tissues. UBE1L mRNA expression was most prominent in the small bowel, lymph node, spleen, fetal spleen, thymus, and lung as compared with other examined tissues and cell lines. Yet, repression of UBE1L mRNA expression was detected in brain tissues and several examined cancer cell lines (HL-60, HeLa S3, K562, Daudi, and A549). As shown in these arrays, ISG15 and UBE1L mRNAs were often detected in the same hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells and tissues. Similar loading of mRNA species in this array was independently confirmed by hybridization to a radiolabeled ubiquitin probe (data not shown). These expression patterns for ISG15 and UBE1L mRNAs were independently confirmed using Northern analyses of multiple human tissues (data not shown).Fig. 3Multiple tissue and cell line array analyses of UBE1L and ISG15 mRNA expression. A, a dot blot array containing 76 poly(A)+ RNAs from adult tissues, cell lines, fetal tissues, and malignant cell lines were each hybridized with probes for UBE1L (middle panel) or ISG15 (bottom panel) or to a control species, ubiquitin (data not shown). The positions of mRNAs on the filter are depicted (top panel and at www.clontech.com/index.shtml). B, densitometric analyses of relative expression levels for UBE1L and ISG15. Values were determined by densitometric analyses using ImageQuaNT (version 5.1). The differences between the highest and lowest values for each species were determined. These differences were divided equally and used to determine relative levels of expression spanning from “Low” to “High” for each indicated species. UBE1L and ISG15 expression profiles for the indicated tissues and cell lines were assessed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The observed repression of UBE1L mRNA in cancer cell lines was consistent with previous work that indicated repressed UBE1L mRNA levels in lung cancer cell lines (33Kok K.

https://openalex.org/W1968973334,"Nitric oxide (NO) release from nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) is largely dependent on the dissociation of an enzyme ferric heme-NO product complex (FeIIINO). Although the NOS-like protein from Bacillus subtilis (bsNOS) generates FeIIINO from the reaction intermediate N-hydroxy-l-arginine (NOHA), its NO dissociation is about 20-fold slower than in mammalian NOSs. Crystal structures suggest that a conserved Val to Ile switch near the heme pocket of bsNOS might determine its kinetic profile. To test this we generated complementary mutations in the mouse inducible NOS oxygenase domain (iNOSoxy, V346I) and in bsNOS (I224V) and characterized the kinetics and extent of their NO synthesis from NOHA and their NO-binding kinetics. The mutations did not greatly alter binding of Arg, (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin, or alter the electronic properties of the heme or various heme-ligand complexes. Stopped-flow spectroscopy was used to study heme transitions during single turnover NOHA reactions. I224V bsNOS displayed three heme transitions involving four species as typically occurs in wild-type NOS, the beginning ferrous enzyme, a ferrous-dioxy (FeIIO2) intermediate, FeIIINO, and an ending ferric enzyme. The rate of each transition was increased relative to wild-type bsNOS, with FeIIINO dissociation being 3.6 times faster. In V346I iNOSoxy we consecutively observed the beginning ferrous, FeIIO2, a mixture of FeIIINO and ferric heme species, and ending ferric enzyme. The rate of each transition was decreased relative to wild-type iNOSoxy, with the FeIIINO dissociation being 3 times slower. An independent measure of NO binding kinetics confirmed that V346I iNOSoxy has slower NO binding and dissociation than wild-type. Citrulline production by both mutants was only slightly lower than wild-type enzymes, indicating good coupling. Our data suggest that a greater shielding of the heme pocket caused by the Val/Ile switch slows down NO synthesis and NO release in NOS, and thus identifies a structural basis for regulating these kinetic variables."
https://openalex.org/W2121371218,"Abundant evidence supports the role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in colorectal cancer. Nitric oxide (NO), a pro-inflammatory signaling factor, may regulate COX-2 expression and activity thereby linking hyper-inflammatory states to cancer susceptibility. Previously we showed that NO induced COX-2 expression. Although NO also activated the β-catenin·T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancing factor transcriptional pathway, a direct causal link between this pathway and COX-2 expression was not demonstrated. In this current study, we focused on NO-induced transcriptional activity and elucidated its role in COX-2 expression. NO donors stimulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-δ and c-myc, both downstream genes of β-catenin. They also induced the expression of polyoma enhancer activator 3 (PEA3) and increased its DNA-binding activity. To establish a role for PEA3 to β-catenin-induced COX-2, we transfected RKO cells with β-catenin and found that β-catenin increased PEA3 expression. Also, there was higher PEA3 in immortal mouse colon epithelium cells (ApcMin/+) compared with young adult mouse colon cells (Apc+/+). Luciferase reporter assays revealed that, although several transcription factors/coactivator, acting alone or in synergistic combination, induced COX-2 promoter activity, PEA3 was one of the most potent. Interestingly, NO from NO donors or generated endogenously from transfected inducible nitric-oxide synthase, increased PEA3/p300-induced COX-2 promoter activity. We also found that an ETS site (-75/-72) and the NF-IL6 site were responsible for COX-2 activity induced by PEA3, PEA3/p300, and NO. Taken together, our results demonstrated that NO through β-catenin signaling stimulated PEA3 to increase COX-2 activity.

Full-Text PDF Open Access Multiple lines of evidence suggest that prostaglandins, metabolites of arachidonic acid, play an important role in colon cancer development. Elevated prostaglandin levels are found in colon cancers and in their precursor lesions, adenomatous polyps. It is now understood that at least two forms of the enzyme, COX-1 and COX-2, 1The abbreviations used are: COX-1 and -2, cyclooxygenase-1 and -2; NO, nitric oxide; NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; iNOS, inducible NOS; LEF, lymphocyte enhancing factor; TCF, T-cell factor; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; YAMC, young adult mouse colon; IMCE, immortal mouse colon epithelium; SMT, S-methylisothiourea sulfate; SIN-1, 3-morpholinosydnonimine, HCl; NOR-1, (E)-methyl-2-[(E)-hydroxyimino]-5-nitro-6-methoxy-3-hexeneamide; SNAP, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; AP-1, activator protein-1; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; MAPK, mitogen-activate protein kinase; PEA3, polyoma enhancer activator 3. are responsible for the metabolism of arachidonic acid. COX-2 is inducible and increased in inflammatory states as well as in numerous cancers and their associated pre-malignant lesions. It may be a critical step in colon carcinogenesis in that inhibitors of COX-2 can block carcinogenesis (1Subbaramaiah K. Dannenberg A.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 96-102Google Scholar, 2Steinbach G. Lynch P.M. Phillips R.K. Wallace M.H. Hawk E. Gordon G.B. Wakabayashi N. Saunders B. Shen Y. Fujimura T. Su L.K. Levin B. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1946-1952Google Scholar) NO is a pleiotropic regulator, critical to numerous biological processes, including vasodilatation, neurotransmission, and macrophage-mediated immunity. It also modulates the etiology and phenotype of cancer cells (3Xu W. Liu L.Z. Loizidou M. Ahmed M. Charles I.G. Cell Res. 2002; 12: 311-320Google Scholar, 4Perez-Sala D. Lamas S. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 231-248Google Scholar, 5Lala P.K. Chakraborty C. Lancet Oncol. 2001; 2: 149-156Google Scholar). Previous work from our group as well as others established a connection between NO and the induction of COX-2 (4Perez-Sala D. Lamas S. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 231-248Google Scholar, 6Mei J.M. Hord N.G. Winterstein D.F. Donald S.P. Phang J.M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1188-1201Google Scholar). NO is produced from l-arginine by nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs). NO treatment activates matrix metalloproteinases, which cause the degradation of E-cadherin, the relocalization of β-catenin to cytosol and nucleus, and the formation of β-catenin·TCF/LEF complexes. The β-catenin·TCF/LEF transcription complex, probably indirectly, stimulates COX-2 expression (6Mei J.M. Hord N.G. Winterstein D.F. Donald S.P. Phang J.M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1188-1201Google Scholar, 7Mei J.M. Borchert G.L. Donald S.P. Phang J.M. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 2119-2122Google Scholar). Because other investigations showed that β-catenin may transactivate the expression of PEA3, a transcription factor of the Ets family (8Howe L.R. Crawford H.C. Subbaramaiah K. Hassell J.A. Dannenberg A.J. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20108-20115Google Scholar), we considered whether β-catenin·TCF/LEF may stimulate COX-2 through activation of PEA-3. Thus, activation of COX-2 by NO may be by a sequential pathway: NO → β-catenin·TCF/LEF → PEA3 → COX-2. PEA3 belongs to the Ets family of transcription factors. The signature of the Ets family is the ETS domain, a region of ∼85 amino acids, which has been widely conserved during evolution. Most of the Ets family members bind to the core sequence 5′-GGA(A/T)-3′. A wide series of promoters have been characterized as containing active ETS binding sites (9Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Google Scholar, 10de Launoit Y. Baert J.L. Chotteau A. Monte D. Defossez P.A. Coutte L. Pelczar H. Leenders F. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1997; 61: 127-135Google Scholar). The specificity of each member of the Ets family to the regulation of a specific gene has not yet been established. It has been demonstrated that PEA3 is able to transactivate the promoters of collagenase types I and IV as well as stromelysin type I (11Higashino F. Yoshida K. Noumi T. Seiki M. Fujinaga K. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1461-1463Google Scholar). Recently, a specific glutathione peroxidase gene gpx5 has been characterized as a putative target gene of the PEA3 DNA-binding protein in the mouse epididymis (12Drevet J.R. Lareyre J.J. Schwaab V. Vernet P. Dufaure J.P. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 49: 131-140Google Scholar). In this study, we employed conditionally immortal colonic cell lines. One is designated YAMC cell (Apc+/+) derived from a SV40LT antigen parental mouse; IMCE cells (ApcMin/+) are derived from the F1 hybrids resulting from the mating of ApcMin/+ and SV40LT antigen transgenic mice (13Whitehead R.H. Joseph J.L. Epithelial Cell Biol. 1994; 3: 119-125Google Scholar, 14Whitehead R.H. VanEeden P.E. Noble M.D. Ataliotis P. Jat P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 587-591Google Scholar). This pair of non-transformed murine colon epithelial cell lines of similar genetic background includes one that carries the ApcMin/+ mutation and consequently expresses higher β-catenin levels. Because both YAMC and IMCE cells express the heatlabile SV40LT antigen that allows them to proliferate at 33 °C, they revert to a non-transformed phenotype at the restrictive temperature of 39 °C at which the proliferation of these cells ceases. RKO is a human colorectal cancer cell line with both wild type APC and wild type β-catenin. From studies in these cell lines, we found that NO treatment stimulated PEA3 expression that might be mediated by β-catenin·TCF/LEF signaling. PEA3 and some other transcription factors induced COX-2 promoter activity. One interesting finding was that NO, either added exogenously or produced endogenously by transfected iNOS, stimulated the interaction between PEA3 and transcription co-activator CBP/p300 in the induction of COX-2. These findings indicate the unique role of PEA3 in the regulation of COX-2. These data support our hypothesis that PEA3 mediates NO-induced COX-2. Reagents and Tissue Culture—NO donors, SIN-1, NOR-1, SNAP, and iNOS inhibitor SMT were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Experiments were carried out using the conditionally immortalized murine colonic epithelial cell lines YAMC and IMCE (13Whitehead R.H. Joseph J.L. Epithelial Cell Biol. 1994; 3: 119-125Google Scholar, 14Whitehead R.H. VanEeden P.E. Noble M.D. Ataliotis P. Jat P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 587-591Google Scholar). Both YAMC and IMCE cells express the heat-labile SV40 large T antigen with an IFN-γ-inducible promoter. The temperature-sensitive SV40 large T antigen with IFN-γ-inducible promoter is active only at 33 °C. It becomes inactivated and non-functional once cells are transferred to 39 °C. All cells were grown on a 75-cm2 tissue culture flask coated with type I collagen (5 μg/cm2) in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 5% neonatal calf serum, ITS+ (insulin, 6.25 μg/ml; transferrin, 6.25 μg/ml; selenious acid, 6.25 ng/ml; linoleic acid, 5.35 mg/ml; and bovine serum albumin, 1.25 mg/ml), 5 IU/ml murine IFN-γ, 100,000 IU/liter penicil-lin, and 100 mg/liter streptomycin. They were cultured under transforming (permissive) conditions in a 33 °C incubator with 5% CO2 plus all the aforementioned supplements in the media. RKO colorectal cancer cells were kindly supplied by Dr. M. G. Brattain, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% of fetal bovine serum.

The p300 expression vector was from Upstate Biotech, Inc. The series of COX-2 luciferase reporter constructs in which deletions or site-specific mutations had been introduced, -1432/+59, -327/+59, -124/+59, -52/+59, KBM (NF-κB, -223/-214), ILM (NF-IL6, -132/-124), and CRM (CRE, -59/-53) were kindly provided by Dr. Tadashi Tanabe of the National Cardiovascular Center Research Institute, Osaka, Japan (21Jayaraman G. Srinivas R. Duggan C. Ferreira E. Swaminathan S. Somasundaram K. Williams J. Hauser C. Kurkinen M. Dhar R. Weitzman S. Buttice G. Thimmapaya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17342-17352Google Scholar). Using a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), 4 ETS binding sites (-75/-72, -104/-101, -189/-186, and -287/-284) in the COX-2 promoter were mutagenized, respectively, where -327/+59 construct was used as backbone. They were designated as ETSM-1, -2, -3, and -4. Western Blot Analysis and Co-immunoprecipitation—Equal amounts of total cellular protein extract were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The primary antibodies used were anti-PEA3 (16Howe L.R. Subbaramaiah K. Chung W.J. Dannenberg A.J. Brown A.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1572-1577Google Scholar) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-PPAR-δ (H74, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-c-myc (MAB8865, Chemicon), anti-β-catenin (BD Transduction Laboratory), and anti-actin (Sigma). Anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) were used as secondary antibodies. Blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) procedure (Amersham Biosciences). The methods for the co-immunoprecipitation assay have been previously described (15Liu Y. Ludes-Meyers J. Zhang Y. Munoz-Medellin D. Kim H.T. Lu C. Ge G. Schiff R. Hilsenbeck S.G. Osborne C.K. Brown P.H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7680-7689Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm NaVO3, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein G-agarose (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) was incubated p300 antibody (N-15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 1 h followed by incubating with 500 μg of protein extracts at 4 °C overnight. The agarose mixture was pelleted and washed four times in lysis buffer. For immunoprecipitation-Western blotting, the agarose was resuspended in 40 μl of 1 × sample buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, 0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol), and 20 μl was loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting to PEA3 was performed as described above. Luciferase Assay—COX-2 transcriptional activity in RKO cells was measured using the Dual Luciferase™ reporter assay (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were co-transfected with the Cox-2-Luc reporter construct, or different truncation or mutation constructs, and pRL-TK, a Renilla construct for normalizing of transfection efficiency. To determine the effects of transcription factors on COX-2 activity, equivalent amounts of cDNA of various transcription factors, p300, or iNOS, or vector plasmid were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Some cells were treated with 50 μm of SIN-1 overnight. Transfected cells were lysed 36 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured with equal amounts of cell extract using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) and normalized with the Renilla activity. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—YAMC and IMCE cells were treated with 10 μm SIN-1 for 4 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared using NE-PER™ Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Pierce Co., Rockford, IL). We added 1.5 μg of nuclear protein to a 20-μl reaction mix containing 2 μg of poly(dI-dC); binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 60 μm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 12% glycerol); with or without double-stranded mouse PEA3 oligonucleotide (Invitrogen), 5′-GCAGGAAGTAGGGAGAG-3′. Unlabeled oligonucleotide at 100× concentration was used as specific competitor. Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min. Then, PEA3 oligonucleotide radiolabeled using T4 kinase (Invitrogen) and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) were added at 1.5–2 × 104 cpm per reaction and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. DNA loading dye (Quality Biological, Gaithersburg, MD) was added to stop the reaction. Samples were run on a 6% poly-acrylamide gel (37.5:1; Protogel, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) at 189 V for 2.5 h in 0.5× TBE (Tris-borate-EDTA) running buffer. Gels were dried and exposed to XAR-5 film (Kodak). NO Treatment Increased Expression of β-Catenin·TCF/LEF Downstream Genes and Stimulated the Expression and DNA Binding of PEA3—Our previously published studies showed that, in YAMC cells, NO treatment stimulated the expression of COX-2 and increased the production and activity of prostaglandin E2, a product of COX-2. Furthermore, NO induced the relocation of β-catenin from membrane to the cytosol and nucleus and stimulated the β-catenin·LEF-1 DNA complex formation. But a direct NO induction of COX-2 activity by β-catenin·TCF/LEF complex has not been shown (6Mei J.M. Hord N.G. Winterstein D.F. Donald S.P. Phang J.M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1188-1201Google Scholar). To confirm that NO stimulated the β-catenin·TCF/LEF transactivation activity, we treated cells with NO donors and performed Western blot analysis on the expression for PPAR-δ and c-myc, both downstream genes of β-catenin·TCF/LEF. The YAMC cells were treated with two different concentrations of SIN-1 (5.0 and 50 μm), SNAP (10 and 100 μm), and NOR-1 (5.0 and 50 μm), respectively. NO treatment dramatically increased the expression of PPAR-δ and c-myc (Fig. 1A), which is consistent with our previous interpretation that NO stimulated the β-catenin·TCF/LEF transactivation activity. Previously published work by others suggested that PEA3 regulated COX-2 (8Howe L.R. Crawford H.C. Subbaramaiah K. Hassell J.A. Dannenberg A.J. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20108-20115Google Scholar, 16Howe L.R. Subbaramaiah K. Chung W.J. Dannenberg A.J. Brown A.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1572-1577Google Scholar) which prompted us to consider that PEA3 might mediate NO-induced COX-2 in our model system. We first showed that NO stimulated PEA3 expression. Performing Western blot analysis for PEA3, we found that SIN-1 (5.0 and 50 μm), SNAP (10 and 100 μm), and NOR-1 (5.0 and 50 μm) all induced the expression of PEA3 in YAMC cells (Fig. 1A). To further explore the effect of NO on PEA3 activity, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays, which showed that the NO donor SIN-1 increased the DNA-binding activity of PEA3 in both YAMC and IMCE cells (Fig. 1B). The Status of β-Catenin Affected the Expression of PEA3— These initial studies showed that NO stimulated the activity of both PEA3 and β-catenin·TCF/LEF. Whereas others have suggested PEA3 stimulation of COX-2, no direct stimulation of COX-2 expression by β-catenin·TCF/LEF has been reported. Therefore, we considered that PEA3 might be a downstream target gene of β-catenin·TCF/LEF. To demonstrate this, we transfected RKO cells with a vector expressing an activated form of β-catenin, β-catenin-S37A, and obtained stable transfectants. Western blot analysis showed that β-catenin-S37A markedly increased the level of PEA3 as compared with vector-transfected control cells (Fig. 2A). We also tested this hypothesis in YAMC (Apc+/+) and IMCE (ApcMin/+) cells, which differ only in their Apc genotype. In IMCE cells, mutation in Apc leads to higher levels of cytosolic and nuclear β-catenin. Therefore, we compared the expression levels of PEA3 in these two cell lines. Western blot analysis showed that IMCE cells contained higher levels of cytosolic β-catenin when compared with its counterpart YAMC cells (Fig. 2B). Consistent with this finding, IMCE cells also had higher levels of c-myc, a target gene of β-catenin·TCF/LEF (Fig. 2B). Importantly, PEA3 levels were present at higher levels in IMCE cells (Fig. 2B), presumably due to higher β-catenin·TCF/LEF activity and supporting the interpretation that β-catenin·TCF/LEF regulates the expression of PEA3. COX-2 Promoter Activity Was Regulated by PEA3, CBP/p300, and Other Transcription Factors—The aforementioned findings led us to propose that PEA3 mediated NO induction of COX-2 activity. We performed studies assaying promoter activity in cells transfected with a COX-2-Luc construct to directly address this hypothesis. To determine whether PEA3 or various transcription factors and co-activators, alone or in various specified combinations, stimulated COX-2 promoter activity, we co-transfected vectors expressing c-Jun, β-catenin-S37A, TCF-4, cEBP-α, -β, -δ, and p300. We included these transcription factors, because they were reported either to regulate COX-2 activity in a cell system, and/or they were found to have binding sites in the COX-2 promoter (Fig. 3A) (8Howe L.R.

Norton L. Gerald W. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18649-18657Google Scholar). Each set of transfectants was treated with or without the NO donor, SIN-1, to examine NO modulation of one or more specific transcription factors alone or in combination. As shown in Fig. 3B, PEA3 acting alone was the most potent among those tested with a COX-2 promoter activity increase of 7-fold over control. A number of other transcription factors, including c-Jun, cEBP-α, cEBP-δ, and p300 increased COX-2 promoter activity 1- to 2-fold, whereas β-catenin and TCF-4 had little effect. In fact, cEBP-β showed significant inhibition of COX-2 promoter activity. The pattern of promoter activity seen with combinations of transcriptional factors was of special interest. As a co-activator, p300 significantly increased the stimulatory activity of c-Jun (∼4-fold) and modestly increased the already high activity level of PEA3. The synergistic interaction of PEA3 with c-Jun was dramatic. In combination these two stimulated COX-2 activity 17-fold as compared with the effect of PEA3 and c-Jun at ∼7-fold and ∼2-fold, respectively, when transfected alone. A modest synergism was seen between c-Jun and β-catenin. In contrast to the increased activity of p300 with PEA3, the cEBP species appeared to decrease the stimulatory effect of PEA3. With our focus on the mediator of the NO effect on COX-2 expression, it was striking that NO modulated the promoter activity of only one set of transcriptional factors among those that we studied. With the use of SIN-1 as NO donor, we found an increase in stimulation of promoter activity only with the PEA3/p300 combination. Treatment with SIN-1 increased this activity almost 2-fold to the highest level seen in these studies. At the concentration used, SIN-1 had no inhibitory effect on any of the COX-2 promoter activities. Endogenous NO Also Stimulated PEA3/p300-induced COX-2 Activity—NO, a potent second messenger and regulator, is generated from l-arginine by several nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs). The expression of the inducible isoform (iNOS) is stimulated by cytokines and/or bacterial products in a wide range of cell types and tissues. Additionally, tumor cells may express high levels constitutively (3Xu W. Liu L.Z. Loizidou M. Ahmed M. Charles I.G. Cell Res. 2002; 12: 311-320Google Scholar). Although our studies showed marked effects of exogenous NO from NO donors on the transcriptional activity of PEA3/p300 (Fig. 3B), the demonstration that endogenous NO generated from iNOS functioned like exogenous NO would greatly strengthen the physiologic relevance of this finding. We, therefore, co-transfected RKO cells with a human iNOS cDNA expression construct as well as with PEA3/p300. The luciferase reporter assay showed that endogenous NO generated from transfected iNOS-stimulated COX-2 promoter activity over that of PEA3/p300 (Fig. 4). To support the interpretation that this effect was caused by NO produced by iNOS, we treated these cells with S-methylisothiourea sulfate (SMT), a specific inhibitor of iNOS catalytic activity. The results showed that SMT blocked the effect of iNOS in augmenting PEA3/p300-induced COX-2 promoter activity (Fig. 4). These studies clearly showed that endogenously generated NO as well as exogenous NO from NO donors stimulated PEA3/p300-induced COX-2 promoter activity. NF-IL6 and ETS-1 Sites Were Responsible for COX-2 Induction by PEA3 and PEA3/p300 Stimulated by NO—To determine the regulatory elements in the COX-2 promoter that were responsible for NO stimulation of PEA3/p300-induced COX-2 activity, a series of promoter reporter constructs were used in which deletions had been introduced (21Jayaraman G. Srinivas R. Duggan C. Ferreira E. Swaminathan S. Somasundaram K. Williams J. Hauser C. Kurkinen M. Dhar R. Weitzman S. Buttice G. Thimmapaya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17342-17352Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, the NO-dependent PEA3/p300-induced, as well as NO-independent PEA3- and PEA3/p300-induced, promoter activity was totally abolished when using -124/+59 or -52/+59, whereas -327/+59 retained most of its activity, suggesting that the sequences critical for the promoter induction probably lie between base pairs -327 and -125. Then we employed constructs with site-specific mutation to the transcription factor binding sites that locate between -327 and -125, including KBM, CRM, ILM, ETSM-3, and -4 (Fig. 3A). Because the ETS-1 site has been reported important for PEA3-induced COX-2 activity (20Subbaramaiah K. Norton L. Gerald W. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18649-18657Google Scholar), ETSM-1 and -2 also were used. All these reporter constructs had -327/+59 as their backbone. Although the promoter activity was retained using KBM, CRM, and ETSM-2, -3, -4, it was abrogated using ILM and ETSM-1 (Fig. 5B; data for ETSM-3 and -4 not shown). These data agreed with the results from Subbaramaiah et al. (20Subbaramaiah K. Norton L. Gerald W. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18649-18657Google Scholar) and Howe et al. (8Howe L.R. Crawford H.C. Subbaramaiah K. Hassell J.A. Dannenberg A.J. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20108-20115Google Scholar), who suggested that ETS-1 and NF-IL6 sites, respectively, are important for PEA3-induced COX-2. The apparently contradictory observations that mutation of ETS-1 reduces COX-2 promoter transcription even though the native ETS-1 is inactive in the -124/54 promoter construct suggest that cooperation with other transcription factors that bind upstream of position -124 is necessary for ETS-1 activity. Thus, the data strongly suggested that NF-IL6 and ETS-1 sites are critical for COX-2 activity by PEA3, as well as PEA3/p300 stimulated by NO. PEA3 Physically Interacted with p300 —As transcription coactivators, CBP/p300 binds to numerous transcription factors and nuclear receptors to modulate their activity. The binding of CBP/p300 to Ets-1 and Ets-2, both members of the Ets family, has been described (21Jayaraman G. Srinivas R. Duggan C. Ferreira E. Swaminathan S. Somasundaram K. Williams J. Hauser C. Kurkinen M. Dhar R. Weitzman S. Buttice G. Thimmapaya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17342-17352Google Scholar). In our current studies, the finding that both exogenous and endogenous NO stimulated PEA3/p300 mediated COX-2 promoter activity suggested to us that PEA3 and p300 might bind to form a complex. The stimulation of their interaction by NO became an intriguing possibility. To test this idea, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies using RKO cells transiently transfected with pcDNA-, PEA3-, p300-, or PEA3/p300-expressing vectors. After immunoprecipitation with an anti-p300 antibody, a Western blot to PEA3 was carried out. The results clearly demonstrated the physical binding between PEA3 and p300 (Fig. 6). Two different cyclooxygenases are functional in mammals: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-2 is mainly an inducible isoform that shares significant features with iNOS in tissue distribution, regulatory function, and participation in pathophysiological phenomena. NO, the product of iNOS catalysis, is an important regulator of COX-2 expression and activity. There are various pathways proposed for NO-induced regulation of COX-2 expression and for modulation of cancer development. Among these, modulation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor-κB and AP-1 appears important (4Perez-Sala D. Lamas S. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 231-248Google Scholar). We and others have proposed that β-catenin·TCF/LEF signaling also plays a critical role in NO induction of COX-2, especially in colon epithelial cells (6Mei J.M. Hord N.G. Winterstein D.F. Donald S.P. Phang J.M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1188-1201Google Scholar, 22Takahashi M. Mutoh M. Kawamori T. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1974263628,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent a vast family of transmembrane proteins involved in the regulation of several physiological responses. The thromboxane A2 receptor (present as two isoforms: TPα and TPβ) is a GPCR displaying diverse pharmacological effects. As seen for many other GPCRs, TPβ is regulated by agonist-induced internalization. In the present study, we report the identification by yeast two-hybrid screening of Nm23-H2, a nucleoside diphosphate kinase, as a new interacting molecular partner with the C-terminal tail of TPβ. This interaction was confirmed in a cellular context when Nm23-H2 was co-immunoprecipitated with TPβ in HEK293 cells, a process dependent on agonist stimulation of the receptor. We observed that agonist-induced internalization of TPβ was regulated by Nm23-H2 through modulation of Rac1 signaling. Immunofluorescence microscopy in HEK293 cells revealed that Nm23-H2 had a cytoplasmic and nuclear localization but was induced to translocate to the plasma membrane upon stimulation of TPβ to show extensive co-localization with the receptor. Our findings represent the first demonstration of an interaction of an Nm23 protein with a membrane receptor and constitute a novel molecular regulatory mechanism of GPCR endocytosis.

They regulate a wide variety of physiological responses such as neurotransmission, inflammation, cell growth and differentiation, and smell and taste perception. For example, the thromboxane A2 receptor (TP) is implicated in the regulation of diverse pharmacological events, including platelet aggregation, constriction of vascular and bronchiolar smooth muscle cells, as well as mitogenesis and hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells (1Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Google Scholar). Two TP receptor isoforms were identified that are generated by the alternative splicing of a single gene, TPα (343 amino acids) and TPβ (407 amino acids), which share the first 328 amino acids (2Hirata M. Hayashi Y. Ushikubi F. Yokota Y. Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Narumiya S. Nature. 1991; 349: 617-620Google Scholar, 3Raychowdhury M.K. Yukawa M. Collins L.J. McGrail S.H. Kent K.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Google Scholar) demonstrated that only TPβ, but not TPα, undergoes agonist-induced and tonic (constitutive) internalization, which are dictated by distinct motifs in the C terminus of the TPβ receptor. Our efforts in the laboratory have been focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of TPβ (5Rochdi M.D. Watier V. La Madeleine C. Nakata H. Kozasa T. Parent J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40751-40759Google Scholar, 6Rochdi M.D. Parent J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17827-17837Google Scholar). The majority of GPCRs undergo internalization following agonist stimulation. This internalization can participate in receptor desensitization, resensitization, degradation, or activation of signaling cascades such as mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (7Von Zastrow M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 500-504Google Scholar, 8Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 455-465Google Scholar, 9Cavalli V. Corti M. Gruenberg J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 190-196Google Scholar). It has long been questioned if GPCRs signaling and endocytosis constitute two separate events, and if they are regulated by distinct molecular mechanisms (9Cavalli V. Corti M. Gruenberg J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 190-196Google Scholar). In this regard, we have recently shown that Gαq signaling is directly involved in agonist-induced internalization of the TPβ receptor, suggesting that, in the case of some GPCRs, signaling and endocytosis are tightly connected (6Rochdi M.D. Parent J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17827-17837Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which Gαq protein regulates TPβ agonist-induced internalization is still unclear and is one of the major interests of our laboratory. Growing evidence has shown that endocytosis of GPCRs is governed by signaling molecules (6Rochdi M.D. Parent J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17827-17837Google Scholar, 9Cavalli V. Corti M. Gruenberg J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 190-196Google Scholar). Indeed, some studies have demonstrated that members of the Rho family such as RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 as well as a member of the ARF family, ARF6, play a crucial role in GPCR endocytosis (10Qualmann B. Mellor H. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 233-241Google Scholar, 11Claing A. Chen W. Miller W.E. Vitale N. Moss J. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, the regulation of these small G proteins and how they are involved in this process is not well understood. It has been suggested that the regulation of Rho/ARF-mediated actin cytoskeleton rearrangement is either directly or indirectly involved in the regulation of GPCR endocytosis (13Qualmann B. Kessels M.M. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F111-F116Google Scholar, 14Machesky L.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E29-E31Google Scholar, 15Song J.Z. Khachikian H. Radhakrishna J.G. Donaldson J. J.

In addition, several other signaling proteins participating in endocytosis have been identified. Recently, it has been shown that Nm23-H1 regulates dynamin-dependent endocytosis (12Palacios F. Schweitzer J.K. Boshans R.L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 929-936Google Scholar, 21Deitcher D. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 24: 625-626Google Scholar, 22Krishnan K.S. Rikhy R. Rao S. Shivalkar M. Mosko M. Narayanan R. Etter P. Estes P.S. Ramaswami M. Neuron. 2001; 30: 197-210Google Scholar). Nm23 (also known as NDPK, NDK, and Awd) was first identified as a putative tumor metastasis suppressor and as an essential element of fly development (23Ishikawa N. Shimada N. Takagi Y. Ishijima Y. Fukuda M. Kimura N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 7-18Google Scholar). In human, Nm23 represents a family of nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs) encoded by eight different genes. According to their genomic architecture and phosphotransferase activity, human Nm23 genes were classified into two groups. Group I is represented by the Nm23-H1 to Nm23-H4 isoforms, whereas group II contains the Nm23-H5 to Nm23-H8 isoforms (23Ishikawa N. Shimada N. Takagi Y. Ishijima Y. Fukuda M. Kimura N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 7-18Google Scholar). Group I Nm23 proteins possess a highly conserved kinase active site. On the other hand there is no strict conservation of the kinase site motifs for group II, and only Nm23-H6 has been reported to display kinase activity (23Ishikawa N. Shimada N. Takagi Y. Ishijima Y. Fukuda M. Kimura N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 7-18Google Scholar). Nm23 proteins are multifunctional and were shown to be involved in a fascinating variety of cellular activities, including proliferation, development, and differentiation (24Kimura N. Shimada N. Fukuda M. Ishijima Y. Miyazaki H. Ishii A. Takagi Y. Ishikawa N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 32: 309-315Google Scholar). Several studies demonstrated that regulation of these processes by Nm23 proteins is the result of their ability to modulate diverse transmembrane signaling pathways, including transforming growth factor-β1, nerve growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor-1 as reviewed by Otero et al. (25Otero A.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 32: 269-275Google Scholar). NDPKβ (Nm23-H1) was recently shown to promote activation of the Gαs subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins (25Otero A.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 32: 269-275Google Scholar). Nm23 was also suggested to function as a nucleoside diphosphate kinase involved in the activation of dynamin by promoting its GTP loading (22Krishnan K.S. Rikhy R. Rao S. Shivalkar M. Mosko M. Narayanan R. Etter P. Estes P.S. Ramaswami M. Neuron. 2001; 30: 197-210Google Scholar). Inactivation of the Nm23-H1 (also known as awd) gene in Drosophila led to the inhibition of endocytosis occurring at nerve terminals (22Krishnan K.S. Rikhy R. Rao S. Shivalkar M. Mosko M. Narayanan R. Etter P. Estes P.S. Ramaswami M. Neuron. 2001; 30: 197-210Google Scholar). Moreover, Palacios et al. (12Palacios F. Schweitzer J.K. Boshans R.L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 929-936Google Scholar) reported that ARF6-GTP recruits Nm23-H1 to facilitate dynamin-mediated endocytosis of E-cadherin and transferrin receptors during disassembly of adherens junctions. They also proposed that Nm23-H1 promotes adherens junctions disassembly by inactivating the Rac1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, these studies demonstrated that Nm23-H1 inactivates Rac1 by binding Tiam1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac1 (12Palacios F. Schweitzer J.K. Boshans R.L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 929-936Google Scholar, 27Mertens A.E. Roovers R.C. Collard J.G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 11-16Google Scholar). In addition, the same authors showed that expression of Nm23-H1-ΔKpn, a mutant that lacks the killer of prune homology domain involved in the oligomerization and the function of the wild-type Nm23, could reverse ARF6-mediated inactivation of Rac1 signaling, because it could not bind Tiam1 (12Palacios F. Schweitzer J.K. Boshans R.L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 929-936Google Scholar). To our knowledge, Nm23 proteins were never demonstrated to interact with a transmembrane receptor and more particularly, their role in GPCR endocytosis remains to be addressed. In our attempt to identify putative factors involved in TPβ agonist-mediated endocytosis, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using a HeLa cell cDNA library. Interestingly, we identified Nm23-H2 as a protein capable of interacting with the C-terminal tail of TPβ. Here we report a novel interaction between Nm23-H2 and TPβ that regulates TPβ agonist-induced internalization through a Rac1 mechanism. Plasmids Construction—The TPβ C-terminal (TPβCT) coding sequences (amino acids 328-407) were isolated by PCR using the Expand High Fidelity System (Roche Applied Science) with the following oligonucleotides TPβCTF (5′-CAGGGATCCTCAATCCTTTCTGGACAGAGCCTTCCC-3′) and TPβCTR (5′-CAGGAATTCCGGAGTCTCACTCTGTGGCCCAGC-3′). The PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into the bait vector pAS2-1 (Clontech) digested with the same enzymes and subsequently used to perform yeast two-hybrid screening as described below. pcDNA3-Myc-Nm23-H2WT, pcDNA3-Myc-Nm23-H2H118C, and pcDNA3-Nm23-H2-ΔKpn were prepared by PCR using the pGad424-Nm23-H2 plasmid (isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening) and the following primers, respectively, NM23F (5′-GAGGAATTCATGGCCAACCTGGAGCGCACC-3′), NM23R (5′-GCGCTCGAGTCACAGATCCTCTTCAGAGATGAGTTTCTGTTCTTCATAGACCCAGTCATG-3′), Nm23H118CF (5′-GGCAGGAACATCATTTGTGGCAGTGATTCAG-3′), NM23H118CR (5′-CTGAATCACTGCCACAAAGATGTTCCTGCC-3′), NM23ΔKpnF (5′-CTGAATCACTGCATGAATGATGGTCTCCCCAAGCATCACTCGGCC-3′), and NM23ΔKpnR (5′-GGCCGAGTGATGCTTGGGGAGACCATCATTCATGGCAGTGATTCAG-3′). Two-hybrid Screening Assay—A yeast two-hybrid screening was performed following the two-hybrid system standard protocol (28Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Google Scholar). Briefly, the pAS2-1-TPβCT plasmid was transformed into the yeast strain pJ69-4α according to the lithium yeast transformation protocol (28Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Google Scholar) generating a stably pAS2-1/CT-transformed yeast clone. This clone was then transformed with a Human HeLa MATCHMAKER cDNA Library or with the empty pGad424 plasmid (Clontech) (negative control) and grown on (Trp-, Leu-, and His-) restricted media. Several clones showing positive interactions were then isolated, and these interactions were confirmed by growth on quadruple selective (Trp-, Leu-, His-, and Ade-) media. pGAD-GH plasmids containing the library inserts from positive colonies were isolated and transformed into the DH10B bacterial strain. Plasmids were extracted from DH10B cells and transformed once more into yeast with either the bait (pAS2-1/TPβCT) or the negative control (pAS2-1) and plated on quadruple selective medium (Trp-, Leu-, His-, and Ade-) to confirm the interaction. The selected plasmids were then sequenced by dideoxy sequencing. The sequences obtained were searched by using the NCBI blast alignment tool (available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (ICN) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Transient transfections of HEK293 cells grown to 75-90% confluence were performed using FuGENE 6™ (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Empty pcDNA3 vector was added to keep the total DNA amount added per plate constant. Cells grown on 60-mm plates were transfected using 6 μg of total DNA vectors. Receptor Cell Surface Expression and Internalization Assays—Cell surface internalization of TPβ and β2AR were measured by ELISA using transiently transfected HEK293 cells as described previously (4Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.2 × 106 cells were grown overnight in 60-mm plates. The cells were then transfected with pcDNA3-HA-TPβ or other indicated receptor constructs combined with empty pcDNA3, pcDNA3-Nm23-H2WT, pcDNA3-Nm23-H2H118C, or pcDNA3-Nm23-H2-ΔKpn. Transfected cells were maintained as described above for 24 h. Thereafter, 2 × 105 cells were transferred to 24-well plates precoated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and maintained for an additional 24 h. To assess the agonist-induced internalization, the transfected cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by stimulation with 100 nm U46619 at 37 °C for the indicated times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Thereafter, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde plus TBS for 5 min at room temperature followed by three times wash with TBS. Nonspecific binding was blocked with TBS containing 1% BSA for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with a HA- or FLAG-specific monoclonal antibody (BAbCO) at a dilution of 1:1000 in TBS/BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Three washes with TBS buffer followed, and cells were briefly reblocked for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated with a 1:1000 in TBS/BSA of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with TBS, and a colorimetric alkaline phosphatase substrate (Bio-Rad) was added following the instructions from the manufacturer. The resulting colorimetric reactions were measured using a Titertek MultisKan MCC/340 spectrophotometer. Cells transfected with pcDNA3 were studied concurrently to determine background. Values shown represent the mean ± S.E. of four to six independent experiments performed in triplicate. Immunoprecipitations—We transfected 6-well plates of HEK293 cells with pcDNA3, pcDNA3-HA-TPβ, pcDNA3-Myc-Nm23-H2, pcDNA3-Myc-Nm23-H2H118C, and pcDNA3-Myc-Nm23-H2-ΔKpn in the different combinations indicated under “Results.” Transfected cells were maintained as described above for 48 h and incubated for 0-30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 100 nm U46619 prior to harvesting. Thereafter, the cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and harvested in 800 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (9 nm pepstatin, 9 nm antipain, 10 nm leupeptin, and 10 nm chymostatin) (Sigma). Following 60-min incubation of the cells in lysis buffer at 4 °C with rotation, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. One to four micrograms of HA-specific monoclonal were added to the supernatant. After 60 min of incubation at 4 °C, 50 μl of 50% protein A-agarose pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer was added, followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged for 1 min in a microcentrifuge and washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by addition of 50 μl of SDS sample buffer followed by a 30-min incubation at room temperature. Initial lysates and immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting performed by specific antibodies. Recombinant Protein Production and Binding Assay—The cDNA encoding for TPβCT (amino acid region 312-407 representing the whole C-terminal domain of TPβ) was subcloned in the pGEX-4-T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences), and the construct was used to produce a GST-tagged TPβCT fusion protein in Escherichia coli BL21 by following the manufacturer's instruction. The recombinant TPβCT was purified using glutathione-Sepharose™4B (Amersham Biosciences) as indicated by the manufacturer. The purified recombinant TPβCT was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and was immunoblotted by using a GST-specific polyclonal antibody (Bethyl Laboratories). Glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-TPβCT was incubated with Myc-NM23-H2 cellular extracts in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Igepal) supplemented with proteases inhibitors (9 mm pepstatin, 9 mm antipain, 10 mm leupeptin, and 10 mm chymostatin) (Sigma). The binding reactions were then washed three times with binding buffer. SDS sample buffer was added to the binding reactions, and the tubes were boiled for 5 min. The binding reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed with the indicated specific antibodies. Inositol Phosphates Measurement in Cells—Inositol phosphates measurements were performed as described previously (4Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Google Scholar). 2 × 105 HEK293 cells were grown overnight in 12-well plates. The cells were then co-transfected as described above with the indicated constructs. The cells were labeled the following day for 18-24 h with 4 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Biosciences) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, without inositol). The cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in pre-warmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, without inositol) supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 20 mm LiCl for 10 min. After a 30-min stimulation with 500 nm U46619, the medium was removed, and the reactions were terminated by addition of 0.8 ml of 0.4 m chilled perchloric acid. Cells were then collected in microcentrifuge tubes, and a 0.5 volume of a 0.72 n KOH 0.6, m KOHCO3 solution was added. Tubes were mixed and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. Inositol phosphates were separated on Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 columns and eluted with 1.5 m ammonium formate. Total labeled inositol phosphates were then measured by liquid scintillation counting. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—TPβ and Nm23-H2 intracellular localization was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy. 1.2 × 106 HEK293 cells were grown overnight in 60-mm plates as described above. The cells were then transfected with an empty pcDNA3 vector or co-transfected with pcDNA3-HA-TPβ and pcDNA3-Myc-Nm23-H2, and maintained overnight as described above. Then 2 × 105 cells were transferred on coverslips and further grown overnight. The cells were then stimulated at 37 °C with 100 nm U46619 before being fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde plus PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 plus PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100 plus PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with an HA-specific monoclonal (1:500 dilution) and Myc-specific polyclonal (1:200 dilution) antibodies (1:500 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature in PBS supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk. Then, cells were washed three times with 0.1% Triton X-100 plus PBS, followed by incubation with a goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated and Texas Red goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:200 for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed six times with permeabilization buffer. Finally, coverslips were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and examined by immunofluorescence microscopy on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope using a 60× objective. Images were collected using SimplePCI Camera software and processed with Adobe Photoshop software. Rac1 Activation Assay—Rac1 activation was assessed by the PBD assay. This method relies on the capacity of the active form of Rac1 to bind the N-terminal regulatory region of (p21)-activated kinase PAK1 referred to as the p21-binding domain (PBD) (29Thompson G. Owen D. Chalk P.A. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 1995; 37: 7885-7891Google Scholar, 32Benard V. Bokoch G.M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 349-359Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.8 × 106 HEK293 cells were grown overnight in 100-mm plates. The cells were then co-transfected as described above with the indicated constructs. Transfected cells were maintained as described above for 48 h and incubated for 0-120 min at 37 °C in the presence of 100 nm U46619 prior to harvesting. Thereafter, the cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and harvested in 800 μl of lysis buffer (200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with protease inhibitors (9 nm pepstatin, 9 nm antipain, 10 nm leupeptin, and 10 nm chymostatin) (Sigma). Cell extracts (10 μg) were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-PBD (a kind gift of Gary Bokoch, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) for 1 h at 4 °C. The binding reactions were then centrifuged for 2 min at 2000 rpm, and the bead pellets were washed three times with washing buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton, plus antiproteases) followed by two washes in buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm MgCl2,40mm NaCl, plus antiproteases). 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer was then added to the bead pellet. The binding reactions were then analyzed by immunoblotting performed by the use of Rac1-speific monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences). Nm23-H2 Interacts with TPβ—We have recently shown that the C terminus of TPβ confers specific regulatory mechanisms to this isoform of the thromboxane A2 receptor (4Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Google Scholar, 26Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Driss Rochdi M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7079-7085Google Scholar). To identify putative proteins, that could interact with the C terminus of TPβ, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening experiments using the yeast strain pJ69-4α transformed with pAS2.1-TPβCT and a human HeLa cell cDNA library. A total of 1.5 × 106 independent clones were screened yielding over 300 positives. One hundred clones demonstrating a strong growth on selective yeast medium (Trp-, Leu-, His-, and Ade-) were then isolated and characterized by dideoxy sequencing and then aligned using the NCBI blast alignment search tool. Three clones contained a cDNA fragment coding for the Nm23-H2 protein. Other members of the Nm23 protein family were not isolated in the clones that were sequenced. In this study we report the characterization of Nm23-H2 as a putative protein, which strongly interacts with the C-terminal tail of TPβ. As shown in Fig. 1A, strong growth on Trp-, Leu-, His-, and Ade- medium was present only in yeast transformed with pAS2.1-TPβCT and pGADGH-Nm23-H2, indicating that Nm23-H2 is interacting with the C terminus of TPβ. Co-immunoprecipitations and in Vitro Binding Assay—To investigate the interaction of Nm23-H2 with TPβ in a cellular context, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells transfected with pcDNA3-Myc-Nm23-H2 and pcDNA3-HA-TPβ in the presence or absence of U46619 stimulation. Cell lysates were incubated with a HA-specific monoclonal antibody and protein A-agarose, and immunoprecipitation reactions were analyzed by immunoblotting with a Myc-specific polyclonal antibody. Our results demonstrate that Myc-Nm23-H2 was co-immunoprecipitated with TPβ following agonist treatment (Fig. 1B). This suggests that the interaction of Nm23-H2 with TPβ is modulated by agonist stimulation. Moreover, to further confirm the interaction of Nm23-H2 with the C-terminal tail of TPβ, we performed an in vitro binding assay using the purified recombinant C-terminal tail of TPβ fused to GST (GST-TPβCT) along with HEK293 cell extracts expressing Myc-Nm23-H2. The results obtained showed that Nm23-H2 could bind specifically to glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-TPβCT and not to glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST (Fig. 1C). Taken together, our data demonstrate that Nm23-H2 interacts directly with the C-terminal tail of TPβ in an agonist-dependent manner. Interestingly, this constitutes the first study whereby a direct interaction of an Nm23 protein with a G protein-coupled receptor, and to our knowledge to any transmembrane receptor, is shown. Nm23-H2 Inhibits TPβ Agonist-induced Internalization—We were then interested in determining the role of Nm23-H2 in TPβ regulation. Nm23-H1 and Nm23-H2 are 88% identical. Two dominant-negative mutants of Nm23-H1 have been reported. Nm23-H1H118C was characterized as a kinase-defective mutant of Nm23-H1, whereas the Nm23-H1-ΔKpn mutant was shown to be unable to inactivate Rac1 signaling, because it could not bind and sequester Tiam1 (an Rac1 GEF) (12Palacios F. Schweitzer J.K. Boshans R.L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 929-936Google Scholar). The same mutations were thus introduced into Nm23-H2. We first assessed how Nm23-H2 and its two mutants would regulate agonist-induced internalization of TPβ. Fig. 2A shows the results of a TPβ internalization assay following a 2-h incubation with U46619 performed by ELISA (4Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Google Scholar) in HEK293 cells transfected with HA-TPβ and either Myc-Nm23-H2WT, Myc-Nm23-H2H118C, Myc-Nm23-H2-ΔKpn, or pcDNA3. Intriguingly, we observed that only Nm23-H2-ΔKpn significantly inhibited the agonist-induced internalization of TPβ, whereas expression of Nm23-H2WT or Nm23-H2H118C had no apparent effect on the latter. A time course of receptor internalization was performed to further characterize the effect of Nm23-H2-ΔKpn. Data found in Fig. 2B confirmed that only Nm23-H2-ΔKpn significantly inhibited agonist-induced internalization of"
https://openalex.org/W2037991981,"High levels of prostacyclin (PGI2; measured as 6-keto-PGF1alpha) have been reported in patients under septic shock. Because this was at variance with our previous findings of nitration and inhibition of PGI2 synthase by endotoxin (LPS) in the endothelium, we examined the role of vascular smooth muscle as an alternative source of PGI2. Bovine aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) in passage 1 contained high levels of PGI2 synthase but no activity and no detectable levels of COX-1 or COX-2. LPS exposure for 3 h caused COX-2 mRNA and protein levels to rise during 8 h together with a large increase in PGI2 synthase activity. In contrast, cytokines lead to only a moderate increase of both PGI2 and PGE2. Specific COX-2 inhibitors completely blocked PGI2 formation but PGE2 synthesis only partially. Unexpectedly, *NO formation remained low over 6-8 h, which may be a reason for the lack of nitration and inhibition of prostacyclin synthase in LPS exposed SMC. Our results can explain the clinical observation of severe hypotension in progressive stages of septic shock as a mechanism to compensate endothelial dysfunction. According to our data, the use of COX-2-specific inhibitors may not be advisable in septic patients. In contrast, administration of COX-1-specific blockers could prevent platelet aggregation during progressed stages of endotoxic shock."
https://openalex.org/W2093887822,"The coxsackievirus 2B protein is a small hydrophobic protein (99 amino acids) that increases host cell membrane permeability, possibly by forming homo-multimers that build membrane-integral pores. Previously, we defined the functional role of the two hydrophobic regions HR1 and HR2. Here, we investigated the importance of regions outside HR1 and HR2 for multimerization, increasing membrane permeability, subcellular localization, and virus replication through analysis of linker insertion and substitution mutants. From these studies, the following conclusions could be drawn. (i) The hydrophilic region (58RNHDD62) between HR1 and HR2 is critical for multimerization and increasing membrane permeability. Substitution analysis of Asn61 and Asn62 demonstrated the preference for short polar side chains (Asp, Asn), residues that are often present in turns, over long polar side chains (Glu, Gln). This finding supports the idea that the hydrophilic region is involved in pore formation by facilitating a turn between HR1 and HR2 to reverse chain direction. (ii) Studies undertaken to define the downstream boundary of HR2 demonstrated that the aromatic residues Trp80 and Trp82, but not the positively charged residues Arg81, Lys84, and Lys86 are important for increasing membrane permeability. (iii) The N terminus is not required for multimerization but does contribute to the membraneactive character of 2B. (iv) The subcellular localization of 2B does not rely on regions outside HR1 and HR2 and does not require multimerization. (v) Virus replication requires both the membrane-active character and an additional function of 2B that is not connected to this activity.

Enteroviruses (e.g. poliovirus, coxsackievirus, echovirus) belong to the family of Picornaviridae, a large family of nonenveloped, cytolytic viruses. The enterovirus genome consists of a 7.5-kb RNA molecule of positive polarity that is translated into one single 220-kDa polyprotein in a cap-independent manner. Proteolytic processing of the polyprotein by virus-encoded proteases yields the P1, P2, and P3 region proteins. The P1 region is further processed to generate the capsid proteins; the P2 and P3 regions are cleaved to yield the replication proteins 2Apro, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3Cpro, and 3Dpol and the more stable cleavage intermediates 2BC, 3AB, and 3CDpro, which have functions distinct from their cleavage products (reviewed in Refs. 1Wimmer E. Hellen C.U. Cao X. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 353-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 2Porter A.G. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6917-6921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enteroviruses induce a number of profound functional and morphological alterations in host cell membranes. An important membrane modification that can be observed in infected cells is the increase in membrane permeability, which affects both intracellular membranes and the plasma membrane (3Carrasco L. Otero M.J. Castrillo J.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 40: 171-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 4Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Hoenderop J.G.J. Smeets R.L.L. Willems P.H.G.M. Dijkman H.B.P.M.

The gradual modification of membrane permeability starts with the release of calcium from intracellular stores, followed (or accompanied) by the disruption of ionic gradients over the plasma membrane. Later in infection, low molecular weight compounds like hygromycin B (hygB) 1The abbreviations used are: hygB, hygromycin B; BGM, Buffalo green monkey; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CLSM, confocal laser scanning microscopy. , a small non-permeative inhibitor of translation, can also efficiently pass the plasma membrane. At the end of the virus replication cycle, cells are lysed to release virus progeny. Of the morphological modifications, the massive accumulation of small, cytoplasmic membrane vesicles with which the viral replication complexes are associated is the most prominent (6Bienz K. Egger D. Pfister T. Arch. Virol. Suppl. 1994; 9: 147-157PubMed Google Scholar, 7Schlegel A. Giddings T.H. Ladinsky M.S. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6576-6588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both biochemical and microscopical evidence indicates that these vesicles are derived from the secretory pathway (7Schlegel A. Giddings T.H. Ladinsky M.S. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6576-6588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that the 2BC precursor protein plays an important role in the accumulation of these vesicles (8Cho M.W. Teterina N. Egger D. Bienz K.

The enterovirus 2B protein plays a major role in these virus-induced membrane modifications. Expression of the 2B protein or its precursor 2BC is sufficient to release calcium from intracellular stores (i.e. ER and Golgi; Ref. 4Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Hoenderop J.G.J. Smeets R.L.L.

How the 2B protein modifies membrane permeability is at present largely unknown. In infected cells, the 2B protein is present at the secretory pathway-derived membranes of the replication complex (7Schlegel A. Giddings T.H. Ladinsky M.S. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6576-6588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bienz K. Egger D. Pasamontes L. Virology. 1987; 160: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 11Rust R.C. Landmann L. Gosert R. Tang B.L. Hong W. Hauri H.P. Egger D. Bienz K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9808-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Upon individual expression, the 2B protein localizes at membranes of the ER and Golgi complex (17Sandoval I.V. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4679-4693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18De Jong A.S. Wessels E. Dijkman H.B. Galama J.M. Melchers W.J. Willems P.H. Van Kuppeveld F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1012-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This localization pattern suggests that the 2B protein increases membrane permeability of ER and Golgi membranes directly, whereas the permeability of the plasma membrane is increased indirectly, by means of an as yet unknown mechanism. Recently, we demonstrated that mutations that disrupt the ability of 2B to increase ER and Golgi membrane permeability also disrupt the 2B-induced increase in plasma membrane permeability, suggesting that these two phenomena are coupled (56Campanella M. de Jong A.S. Lanke K.W.H. Melchers W.J.G. Willems P.H.G.M. Pinton P. Rizzuto R. Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18440-18450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Mutations in 2B that affect its ability to increase membrane permeability interfere with an early step in viral RNA replication (15Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Melchers W.J.G. Kirkegaard K. Doedens J.R. Virology. 1997; 227: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is possible that the membrane-active character of 2B is involved in the accumulation of replication vesicles by the 2BC protein. Virus replication is also affected by mutations in 2B that do not affect its ability to increase membrane permeability (15Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Melchers W.J.G. Kirkegaard K. Doedens J.R. Virology. 1997; 227: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), arguing for an additional role of 2B in RNA replication. The enterovirus 2B protein is a small, hydrophobic protein (97–99 amino acids) that was recently classified as a viroporin, a group of virus proteins that modify host cell membrane permeability and share a number of common features (reviewed in Ref. 20Gonzalez M.E. Carrasco L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The 2B protein contains two hydrophobic regions, designated HR1 (amino acids 37–54) and HR2 (amino acids 63–80), of which the first is predicted to form a cationic amphipathic α-helix (21Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Galama J.M.D. Zoll J. Melchers W.J.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7782-7790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Galama J.M.D. Zoll J. van den Hurk P.J.J.C. Melchers W.J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3876-3886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amphipathic α-helix displays characteristics typical for the group of lytic polypeptides, which may build membrane-integral pores upon the formation of multimeric transmembrane complexes (23Segrest J.P. De-Loof H. Dohlman J.G. Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Proteins. 1990; 8: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 24Shai Y. Trends. Biochem.

Accordingly, the 2B protein was suggested to form multimeric pores in which both HR1 and HR2 span the phospholipid bilayer. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, homo-multimerization reactions of the 2B protein were demonstrated in vivo by yeast and mammalian two-hybrid analysis (26Cuconati A. Xiang W. Lahser F. Pfister T. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27De Jong A.S. Schrama I.W.J. Willems P.H.G.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy (28Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Melchers W.J.G. Willems P.H.G.M. Gadella T.W.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9446-9456Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), as well as in vitro using a biochemical approach (29Agirre A. Barco A. Carrasco L. Nieva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40434-40441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Second, mutations in each of the hydrophobic regions interfere with the ability of the 2B protein to homo-multimerize and to increase membrane permeability (15Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Melchers W.J.G. Kirkegaard K. Doedens J.R. Virology. 1997; 227: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 27De Jong A.S. Schrama I.W.J. Willems P.H.G.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Barco A. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3560-3570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the 2B protein was demonstrated to be an integral membrane protein, and the presence of each of the hydrophobic regions was shown to be required for this integral membrane association and the correct subcellular localization (18De Jong A.S. Wessels E. Dijkman H.B. Galama J.M. Melchers W.J. Willems P.H. Van Kuppeveld F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1012-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The structure-function relationship and the membrane architecture of the 2B protein are as yet poorly understood. Our current view is mainly based on the phenotypic characterization of mutations in HR1 and HR2. The functional role of domains upstream, between and downstream of HR1 and HR2, however, has not yet been characterized. Here, we describe the effects of linker insertion and substitution mutations in different regions of the 2B protein on homo-multimerization, increasing membrane permeability, subcellular localization, and virus replication. Cells and Media—Buffalo green monkey (BGM) cells were grown in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units penicillin per ml, and 25 μg streptomycin per ml. COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units penicillin per ml, and 25 μg streptomycin per ml. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Construction of Mutants—Oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis was performed using the subgenomic phagemid pALTCB3/2080–4947 (21Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Galama J.M.D. Zoll J. Melchers W.J.G.

In the sequences of the oligonucleotides described below, the restriction sites are shown in italics and the sequence encoding the 9-amino acids linker (a hemagglutinin epitope tag, YPYDVPDYA) is underlined. pCB3/T7–2B(ins (5)linker) was generated using a forward primer that contained an SmaI restriction site (italics) and the linker sequence (underlined) (5′-gggggggcccgggtcaaagattatccgtacgacgtccccgattatgccggagtgaaggactatgtggaa). The reverse primer (5′-cagagatttctcgagctaggagtcttggcccactag, nt 3837) was chosen such that the PCR product contained the unique SpeI restriction site. The PCR product was digested with SmaI and SpeI and cloned in pCB3/T7-StuI(3743) (32Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. van den Hurk P.J.J.C. van der Vliet W. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. J. Gen.

The PCR product was digested with SpeI and StuI and cloned in pCB3/T7-HpaI(3915) (32Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. van den Hurk P.J.J.C. van der Vliet W. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. J. Gen.

The PCR product was digested with SpeI and ScaI and cloned in pCB3/T7-HpaI(4042), which was digested with SpeI and HpaI. By consequence, the sequence of the 2B/2C junction is altered from AERQ ↓ N to AERQ ↓ S; however, this sequence is efficiently processed by 3Cpro, and virus replication is not affected by the presence of this sequence at the 2B/2C junction (33Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. van den Hurk P.J.J.C. Zoll J. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7632-7640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All sequences that were amplified by PCR were verified by sequence analysis. RNA Transfections and Virus Replication—The effect of the mutations on virus viability was examined by transfection of BGM cells, with RNA transcripts generated from the mutated infectious pCB3/T7 cDNA clones, as described previously (21Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Galama J.M.D. Zoll J. Melchers W.J.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7782-7790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were incubated at 36 °C until cytopathic effect was observed. In case no cytopathic effect was observed after 6 days, the cell cultures were subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing, passaging to fresh monolayers of BGM cells, and incubation for another 6 days. If no virus replication was observed at 6 days after passage, it was concluded that the mutated proteins did not support virus replication. All viruses that were obtained were subjected to sequence analysis. To ensure that the observed phenotypes were not due to additional mutations in the plasmid DNA, all mutants were generated from two individual mutagenesis reactions and analyzed separately. Single-cycle growth curves were performed as described previously (21Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Galama J.M.D. Zoll J. Melchers W.J.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7782-7790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, monolayers of BGM cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 1, incubated at 36 °C, and harvested at 2, 4, 6, and 8 h postinfection. Viruses were released by three cycles of freezing and thawing, and virus titers were determined by titration on BGM cells at 36 °C as described (34Reed L.J. Muench H. Am. J. Hyg. 1938; 27: 493-497Google Scholar). In vitro translation reactions demonstrated that defects in virus replication were not caused by alterations in polyprotein processing (data not shown). Mammalian Two-hybrid Analysis—Homo-multimerization reactions were studied using plasmids pACT, pBIND, and pG5luc of the Checkmate™ Mammalian two-hybrid system (Promega) (27De Jong A.S. Schrama I.W.J.

From the mutant pCB3/T7 plasmids, the NsiI-to-BssHII fragments were cloned into pSP72–2BC (27De Jong A.S. Schrama I.W.J. Willems P.H.G.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and digested with the same enzymes. From the resulting mutant pSP72–2BC constructs, the BamHI-to-SmaI fragments were cloned into pACT-2BC and pBIND-2BC (27De Jong A.S. Schrama I.W.J. Willems P.H.G.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and digested with BamHI and EcoRV. Analysis was performed using pACT-2BC and pBIND-2BC fusion proteins, because the 2BC multimerization reactions always yielded higher luciferase signals, and all the 2B mutants behaved identically in the 2BC and 2B multimerization reactions (27De Jong A.S. Schrama I.W.J. Willems P.H.G.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells in 24-well plates were transfected with the indicated constructs and lysed at 48 h posttransfection, using the FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), as described previously (27De Jong A.S. Schrama I.W.J. Willems P.H.G.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase enzyme activities were measured from the same cell lysate sample with the Dual-Luciferase™ reporter assay system, according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega). Luciferase activities were measured in a luminometer (Bio-Orbit 1251). Measurement of the Renilla luciferase production revealed only small differences among different samples from the same experiment. Because these small differences merely reflected variations in the luciferase measurement, we did not normalize for transfection efficiency. Protein expression was confirmed on Western blots stained with anti-Gal 4 DNA-binding domain (data not shown). Hygromycin B Assay—The ability of 2B to increase plasma membrane permeability to hygB was studied using 2B-EGFP fusion proteins, as described previously (18De Jong A.S. Wessels E. Dijkman H.B.

Mutant p2B-EGFP plasmids were constructed by amplification of the 2B coding sequences of the mutant pCB3/T7 plasmids. A forward primer was used that contained an SaII restriction site (italics) and a start codon (underlined), preceded by a Kozak sequence (5′-ctcctgtggctggctagcgtcgacgccaccatgggagtgaaggactatgtggaa-3′), and a reverse primer that introduced a BamHI restriction site (5′-ccagctggatccttggcgttcagccatagg-3′). The PCR product was cloned into pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) and digested with SalI and BamHI to yield mutant p2B-EGFP. All sequences that were amplified by PCR were verified by sequence analysis. BGM cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected in duplicate with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant 2B-EGFP fusion proteins, using the FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), as described previously (27De Jong A.S. Schrama I.W.J. Willems P.H.G.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). At 40 h posttransfection, cells were starved of methionine for 15 min in the presence or absence of 500 μg/ml hygB, pulse-labeled for 1 h with [35S]methionine (50 μCi/well) in the presence or absence of hygB, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% SDS). Protein synthesis was analyzed by SDS-PAGE of immuno-precipitated EGFP fusion proteins. The amount of radiolabeled anti-EGFP-precipitated protein was quantified by using a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad MultiAnalyst version 1.0.1), and the ratios of the amount of protein synthesized in the presence and absence of hygB was determined. Protein expression was checked on Western blots stained with anti-EGFP (not shown). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—The subcellular localization of wild-type and mutant 2B proteins was determined as described previously (18De Jong A.S. Wessels E.

Briefly, BGM cells were grown on coverslips in 24-well plates and transfected with the indicated plasmids using the FuGene transfection reagent, according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). At 24 h posttransfection, cells were fixed, stained, and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) using a Leica TCS NT (Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). Mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc (clone 9E10) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Rabbit polyclonal anti-calreticulin was obtained from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody, Texas Red-conjugated goat-anti-mouse polyclonal antibody, and Texas Red-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Primary antibodies were diluted 1:200 (anti-c-Myc) or 1:150 (anti-calreticulin). Conjugates were diluted 1:75. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean values ± S.D. Differences were tested for significance by means of the Student's t test.

Here, we analyzed the functional role of domains upstream, between, and down-stream HR1 and HR2 using a linker scanning analysis (Fig. 1A). A nine-amino acid linker was introduced in the N terminus of the protein (linker insertion at position 5, ins (5)linker), immediately upstream HR1 (ins (34)linker), in the hydrophilic sequence between HR1 and HR2 (ins (61)linker), and in the C terminus of the protein (ins (94)linker). In mutant ins (5)linker, the first four amino acids of the 2B protein were duplicated to retain the correct environment for the 3C protease to cleave the 2A/2B junction in the viral polyprotein expressed by the infectious cDNA clone. Alternative codons were used for the duplicated amino acid sequences to minimize the chance of recombination events in the viral RNA. The ability of 2B mutants to form homo-multimers was analyzed using a mammalian two-hybrid system. BGM cells were transfected with fusion proteins containing the activation domain of herpes simplex virus type 1 VP16 or the DNA-binding domain of the yeast GAL4 gene product, and synthesis of the firefly luciferase reporter protein was determined to measure protein-protein interactions. The ability of mutant 2B proteins to increase membrane permeability was studied by determining the entry of hygB, a small inhibitor of translation that, under physiological conditions, poorly passes the plasma membrane. HygB entry was determined by analyzing protein synthesis in cells expressing mutant 2B-EGFP fusion proteins in the absence and presence of the drug.

Alterations of the monounsaturated/saturated fatty acids ratio have been implicated in various diseases related to the metabolic syndrome, including hypertension. We previously evidenced that lipogenesis end-products accumulated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and that a dietary combination of n-6/n-3 PUFA had hypotensive effects. Our present objective was to test the hypothesis that these SHR liver lipid disorders might be modulated, in response to this hypotensive combination, by changes in SCD-1 expression and activity. So we studied, in hepatocytes, SCD-1 transcription by Northern blotting, as well as plasma and liver fatty acid composition by gas-liquid chromatography. Liver SCD-1 gene expression was suppressed by 50%, and in different lipid classes, relative abundance of stearic and oleic acids decreased. Consequently, the Delta9 desaturation index, calculated from the ratio of oleic vs. stearic acids, decreased. In addition, the level of circulating saturated fatty acids decreased when one of oleic acids increased. These data provided evidence that the tested hypotensive PUFA combination reverses the high monounsaturated/saturated fatty acids ratio associated to hypertension in SHR, via a regulation monounsaturated fatty acid relative abundance by repression of SCD-1 gene."

This important recent discovery makes δ-EVIA a unique tool to study the modulation mechanisms of neuronal Na+ channels. As a consequence, δ-EVIA may also serve as a new lead molecule for the design of new drugs to treat neurological diseases characterized by defective nerve conduction, especially those causing an axonal demyelinization (2Kaji R.

Nerve conduction could be facilitated by specific inhibition of Na+ channel inactivation. The knowledge of the detailed three-dimensional structure is therefore the first step necessary to understand the structure-activity relationships of this new lead conotoxin.

All conotoxins of this group exhibit a rather well defined backbone conformation, stabilized by a number of hydrogen bonds located in the different secondary structures, and by the three disulfide bridges. The scaffold forms the classical “cystine-knot” motif known for toxic and inhibitory polypeptides (29Pallaghy P.K. Nielsen K.J. Craik D.J. Norton R.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1833-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). A remarkable feature of δ-EVIA is the length of the loop 2 is made of nine residues instead of six for the other conotoxins. A variability in the cystine-knot scaffold, both in sequence and length, was already described for the loop 4 of conotoxin μ-GS (27Hill J.M. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Structure. 1997; 5: 571-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or the δ-atracotoxin-Hv1 (30Fletcher J.I. Chapman B.E. Mackay J.P. Howden M.E. King G.F.

We describe here the three-dimensional NMR structure in aqueous solution of δ-EVIA. The specific difference with the solution conformation of the other members of the four-loop family of conotoxins is located in loop 2, which is characterized by an apparent low conformational order corroborated by a 1:1 cis/trans isomerism of the Leu12-Pro13 peptide bond in slow exchange on the NMR chemical shift time scale. Both cis Leu12-Pro13 and trans Leu12-Pro13 bonds were separately solved based on two separate sets of experimental restraints. For comparison purposes, a Pro13 → Ala single mutant was also prepared. The NMR data for P13A mutation are consistent with a 12-13 peptide bond purely trans, whereas the global structure of the toxin is maintained. The binding of the P13A δ-EVIA to rat brain synaptosomes as well as its activity, measured by intracerebroventricular injection to mice, is reduced about 2-fold. Toxin synthesis-solid phase synthesis of the linear δ-EVIA and P13A δ-EVIA peptides were done with an ABI 430A synthesizer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), using Fmoc chemistry with 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/HOAt as the condensation reagent (31Carpino L.A. El-Faham A. Minor C. Albericio F. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1994; : 201-203Crossref Google Scholar) and 0.1 mmol of Rink amide resin. After the last Fmoc-amino acid coupling, the Fmoc group was kept bound to the N-terminal amino acid of the linear peptide in order to simplify the read out of the HPLC profile during its purification. The N-α-Fmoc linear peptide was cleaved from the resin and purified with a reverse phase preparative column (Vydac, 218TP, 250 × 25 mm). The peptide was eluted by a linear gradient of A and B solvents, 30-100% B in 70 min; A is an aqueous solution of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and B is an aqueous solution containing 60% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After elution, the major component (151 mg), corresponding to the target Fmoc peptide (mass spectrum, m/z 3515.32), was deprotected by incubation (5 min, 22 °C) with a mixture composed of N,N-dimethyl formamide (5 ml) containing 20% piperidine (v/v) and 1% 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (v/v) and 5 ml of mercaptoethanol (72 mmol). After deprotection, the medium was diluted with deionized water (final volume ∼500 ml) and acidified to pH 4 with trifluoroacetic acid, and the linear peptide was desalted by reverse phase preparative HPLC, as described previously. A pool of the δ-EVIA-containing fractions (∼100 ml) was diluted with deionized water (final volume, ∼500 ml) containing the redox couple cysteine/cystine, 2/0.5 mmol. The volume was adjusted to 1 liter with degassed buffer (0.1 m NH4SO4, 0.1 m ammonium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5), and the solution was adjusted to pH 8.5 with NH4OH and renatured by incubation (48 h at 4 °C, followed by 12 h at 22 °C). The mixture of oxidized peptides was adjusted to pH 4 with trifluoroacetic acid, loaded on reverse phase preparative column (Vydac, 218TP, 250 × 25 mm), and eluted with the acetonitrile gradient described previously. Based on HPLC co-elution experiments and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, δ-EVIA was identified as a minor product under the oxidation conditions used. The peptide was further purified with a semi-preparative column (Zorbax SB C18, 250 × 9.4 mm). Disulfide Pairing Assignment—δ-EVIA disulfide pairing pattern was determined after partial reduction with tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (40 °C, 5 min), as reported previously (32Gray W.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1732-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The reverse phase chromatographic profile of the mixture is shown in Fig. 2A. The fingerprint pattern displayed a huge peak of nonreduced δ-EVIA and three intermediates with one or two open disulfide bonds (peaks A-C). The fully reduced peptide (SH)6 eluted earlier than the nonreduced δ-EVIA and the three intermediates. After the intermediates in peaks A-C were alkylated with a large excess of iodoacetamide and purified by reverse phase HPLC, the amino acid sequences of their Cys (S-carboxamidomethyl) derivatives were determined (Fig. 2B). Sequencing the Cys (S-cam) derivative in peak A indicated SS bridging of Cys3 and Cys21. Sequencing the Cys (S-cam) derivative in peak B revealed an increased signal for Cys (S-cam) at cycles 3, 10, 21, and 25. Thus, peak B has the disulfide bridge Cys10, Cys25 in addition to the disulfide bridge Cys3, Cys21. Analysis of peak C yielded a significant increase in the Cys (S-cam) signal at cycles 10 and 25, due to the open disulfide bridge Cys10, Cys25. Therefore, we deduce SS bridging between Cys20, Cys29,in addition to the detected Cys3, Cys21 and Cys10, Cys25 disulfide bonds. The cystine framework of δ-EVIA was summarized as Cys3, Cys21, Cys10, Cys25, and Cys20, Cys29. Radioiodination and Binding Assays—δ-Conotoxin TxVIA was radio-iodinated by using 1 nmol of toxin, 0.5 mCi of carrier-free Na125I in a potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.25, containing H2O2 (10 μl of 1:50,000 solution) and lactoperoxidase (0.7 unit, EC 1.11.1.7 from bovine milk) for a 2-min incubation time. The monoiodotoxin was purified on a Vydac C18 column. Rat brain synaptosomes were prepared from adult Sprague-Dawley rats (300 g), according to the method described by Kanner (33Kanner B.J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1207-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Equilibrium competition assays were performed using increasing concentrations of unlabeled toxins in the presence of a constant low concentration of the radioactive toxin. Competition binding experiments were analyzed by the program Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software) by using a non-linear Hill equation (for IC50 determination). The Ki values of δ-EVIA were calculated by the equation Ki = IC50/(1 + (L*/Kd)) where L* is the concentration of the hot δ-TxVIA, and Kd is its dissociation constant (34Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar). Standard binding medium composition was (in mm) as follows: choline Cl 130, CaCl2 1.8, KCl 5, MgSO4 0.8, HEPES 50, glucose 10, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Following incubation for the designated times, the reaction was terminated by dilution with 2 ml of ice-cold wash buffer of the following composition (in mm): choline Cl 140, CaCl2 1.8, KCl 5.4, MgSO4 0.8, HEPES 50, pH 7.2, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Separation of free from bound toxin was achieved by rapid filtration under vacuum using Whatman GF/C filters preincubated with 0.3% polyethyleneimine. The filter discs were then rapidly washed twice with 2 ml of buffer. Nonspecific toxin binding was determined in the presence of a high concentration of the unlabeled toxin. Biological Activity—To quantify the biological activity of native and synthetic conotoxins, Swiss-Webster mice (≈15 g) were injected intracerebroventricularly with a stereotaxic system (Harvard/ASI Apparatus, UK). The ED50 value was defined as the dose that produces hyper-activity in 50% of the tested animals within 12 h postinjection. NMR Spectroscopy—δ-EVIA was dissolved at 2.2 mm (4 mg/550 μl) in either 90% H2O, 10% D2O, or 100% D2O. pH was adjusted to 3.0 (direct uncorrected pH-meter reading) using microliter increments of 0.1 n HCl. The P13A analog was prepared at 0.6 mm in 90% H2O, 10% D2O, pH 3.0. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance DRX 500 spectrometer using a 5-mm (1H, 13C, 15N) triple-resonance probe head, equipped with a supplementary self-shielded z gradient coil. Spectra were processed using Bruker XWINNMR and GIFA V.4 (35Pons J.L. Malliavin T.E. Delsuc M.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) software. The solvent signal was suppressed with the WATERGATE sequence using a 3-9-19 pulse sequence with z gradient (36Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenár V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar, 37Sklenár V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. Sect. A. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). The DQF-COSY experiment (38Rance M. Sørensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar) was recorded at 283 K in H2O with a very low power presaturation of the water resonance during the recycle delay to minimize the radiation damping effect. TOCSY/HOHAHA experiments (39Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3112) Google Scholar, 40Davies D.G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 2820-2821Crossref Scopus (1073) Google Scholar) were collected in both H2O and D2O at 283 K with a spin-lock time of 40 and 80 ms and at 290 and 297 K with a spin-lock time of 80 ms. An MLEV pulse sequence was used for the isotropic mixing arranged as the clean-TOCSY scheme (41Griesinger C. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). NOESY spectra (42Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4845) Google Scholar, 43Macura S. Hyang Y. Suter D. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1981; 43: 259-281Google Scholar) were collected at 283, 290, and 297 K with a 1.5-s recycle time and a 150-ms mixing time. Supplementary NOESY spectra were collected at 283 K in H2O and D2O with mixing time of 75 and 250 ms, respectively. In these NOESY experiments, a selective flip-back pulse was applied on water resonance, and gradients were added during t1 to minimize the radiation damping effect (44Lippens G. Najib J. Wodak S.J. Tartar A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Except for the NOESY experiment at 283 K in H2O where 96 scans per t1 increments were accumulated, spectra were registered with 512 (t1) × 1024 (t2) complex data points and 32 scans per t1. The quadrature detection in the t1 dimension was achieved using the States-TPPI method (45Marion D. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 393-399Google Scholar). Chemical shifts were quoted relative to the solvent (H2O) chemical shift at the respective temperature (4.92 ppm at 283 K). The spectral width of all experiments was 10.96 ppm (5482.5 Hz) with a carrier frequency on-resonance with the water resonance. For the P13A conotoxin δ-EVIA, the TOCSY spectrum was collected with a spin-lock time of 80 ms, and NOESY spectrum was recorded with a 150-ms mixing time. Deuterium exchange of labile protons was monitored just after dissolution of the lyophilized sample from H2O at pH 3.0 in neat D2O. The residual NH signal was followed with time at 283 K by analysis of TOCSY spectra recorded at 0.5, 1, 3, 19, 36, and 54 h. Experimental NMR Restraints—Interproton-distance constraints were classified into four categories according to the cross-peak intensity of the NOESY spectrum at 283 K and 150-ms mixing time in H2O and D2O. Upper bounds were fixed at 2.7, 3.3, 5.0, and 6.0 Å for strong, medium, weak, and very weak correlations, respectively. The lower bound for all restraints was fixed at 1.8 Å, which corresponds to the sum of the hydrogen van der Waals' radii. The calibration for the NOE intensities was achieved using the cross-peak intensity Hδ-Hϵ of Tyr7. Pseudo-atom corrections (46Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar) of the upper bounds were applied for magnetically equivalent aromatic protons (+2 Å) and unresolved diastereotopic methyl or methylene protons (+ 1 Å). 0.3 Å was added to NOEs involving amide protons. Dihedral angle restraint χ1 was deduced from the stereospecific assignments of diastereotopic β-protons (±40° from the ideal staggered conformation) (47Hyberts S.G. Marki W. Wagner G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 48Wagner G. Braun W. Havel T.F. Schaumann T. Go N. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 611-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The φ dihedral angle restraints were set to -65 ± 25° for 3JHN-Ha >8 Hz and to -120 ± 40° for 3JHN-Ha <5 Hz. After the initial calculation, 22 distance restraints were applied to restrain 11 hydrogen bonds that were unambiguously defined by both the exchange rate and the NOEs, and by the fact that they appear in ∼75% of the models. Target values of 1.5-2.3 Å for NH(i)-O(j) and 2.5-3.3 Å for N(i)-O(j) were used. Structure Calculations—Models were calculated following a protocol described previously (49Krimm I. Gilles N. Sautièe P. Stankiewicz M. Pelhate M. Gordon D. Lancelin J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1749-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using the X-PLOR software version 3.851 (50Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.851. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar). Structures were analyzed using aqua/procheck-nmr (51Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar) and promotif (52Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar) and displayed using MolMol version 2.4 (53Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) and Molscript (54Kraulis P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). The structure was generated by the hybrid distance geometry dynamically simulated annealing method (55Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 56Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Brünger A.T. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 33-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In a first stage, the substructures generated using metric matrix distance geometry algorithms were regularized and refined by a high temperature simulated annealing protocol, using the parallhdg.pro force field of X-PLOR. The non-bonded van der Waals' interactions were represented by a simple repulsive quadratic term (55Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 57Brünger A.T. Karplus M.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1991; 24: 54-61Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The experimental distance restraints were represented as a soft asymptotic potential, and electrostatic interactions were ignored. The force constant associated with the distance restraints was kept to 50 kcal·mol-1·Å-2 throughout the protocol. One cycle of simulated annealing refinement consisted of 1,500 steps of 3 fs at 1,000 K followed by 3,000 cooling steps of 1 fs from 1,000 to 300 K. At the end, each structure was subjected to 1,500 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization. In the second stage of the calculation, structures with good experimental and geometric energies were further refined using the full CHARMM22 force field of X-PLOR. In this stage of the calculation, the non-bonded interactions such as electrostatic interactions and van der Waals' interactions (described by the Lennard-Jones empirical energy function) were taken into account. An approximate solvent electrostatic screening effect was introduced by using a distance-dependent dielectric constant and by reducing the electric charges of the formally charged amino acid side chain (Asp and Lys) to 20% of its nominal charges defined in the CHARMM22 force field. The force constant used for the NOE potential was reduced to 25 kcal·mol-1·Å-2. After 1,500 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization, the dynamic was initiated at 750 K. The system was equilibrated for 0.5 ps with an integration step of 1 fs and then coupled to a heat bath at 750 K, and the molecule was allowed to evolve for 10 ps before a slow cooling to 300 K for a period of 5.4 ps and allowed to evolve again for 15 ps. Finally, the structures were energy-minimized by 1,500 steps of the conjugate gradient algorithm. δ-EVIA was synthesized using Fmoc chemistry, based on its amino acid sequence. The Nα-Fmoc linear/denatured and reduced peptide was obtained in high yield (151/350 mg of calculated Fmoc peptide). Its folding/renaturation was the limiting step in the synthesis of bioactive δ-EVIA. Typically, the folding procedure yielded only 5-10 mg of synthetic and bioactive δ-EVIA (3.3-6.6% yield, based on 151 mg of Fmoc linear peptide). The HPLC pattern of the preparation obtained after the folding procedure indicated the presence of a large quantity of monomer isomass peptides (data not shown), probably because of misfolding of the linear, reduced peptide. Synthetic δ-EVIA co-eluted with native δ-EVIA (Fig. 2C), and the predicted MW of synthetic δ-EVIA was confirmed by ESI-MS (observed MH+ 3288.1; calculated MH+ 3288.4). Sequence Resonance Assignments of the Spin Systems—From the DQF-COSY and TOCSY spectra, we first noticed the presence of 53 amide protons (HN), instead of the 30 expected. The sequence-specific resonance assignment (46Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar) was undertaken and revealed two distinct NOESY walking with only Asp1, Asp2, Lys5, Hyp6, Gly8, Cys21, and Leu32 common to the two systems. The dαN connectivities proceeded unambiguously for the two sets of resonances except for Cys21/Ser22. Tyr7, Phe9, Pro13, Ala24, and Ala30 spin systems were used as starting points for the sequential assignment due to their specific pattern. In one of the two systems, the Leu12-Pro13 peptide bond was unambiguously assigned to the cis peptide conformation due to the observation of a strong dαα and a weak dαδ in NOESY spectra. For the second system, the peptide bond conformation was unambiguously assigned to the trans conformation due to the observation of a strong dαδ with no dαα. Then the two systems clearly resulted from a Leu12-Pro13 cis/trans mixture of δ-EVIA in slow exchange on the time scale of the NMR chemical shift. No exchange peaks between the two conformers were detected either in the TOCSY or the NOESY experiments (Fig. 3). The chemical shift differences (where Δδc-t indicates difference of the chemical shifts between cis and trans c"

Critics argue that the continued advance of biomedicine will inevitably change human nature, lead to the commodification and objectification of human beings, and rob us of meaningful lives. Although presented with great verve, these worries are not persuasive to the [author][1] of this Policy Forum. Given the stakes involved (i.e., the lost opportunities for development of cures, palliation, and the prevention of disability) better arguments must be forthcoming in order to justify slowing or stopping biomedical research.

https://openalex.org/W2041749908,"Furcatin hydrolase (FH) is a unique disaccharide-specific acuminosidase, which hydrolyzes furcatin (p-allylphenyl 6-O-β-d-apiofuranosyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (acuminoside)) into p-allylphenol and the disaccharide acuminose. We have isolated a cDNA coding for FH from Viburnum furcatum leaves. The open reading frame in the cDNA encoded a 538-amino acid polypeptide including a putative chloroplast transit peptide. The deduced protein showed 64% identity with tea leaf β-primeverosidase, which is another disaccharide glycosidase specific to β-primeverosides (6-O-β-d-xylopyranosyl-β-d-glucopyranosides). The deduced FH also shared greater than 50% identity with various plant β-glucosidases in glycosyl hydrolase family 1. The recombinant FH expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited the highest level of activity toward furcatin with a Km value of 2.2 mm and specifically hydrolyzed the β-glycosidic bond between p-allylphenol and acuminose, confirming FH as a disaccharide glycosidase. The FH also hydrolyzed β-primeverosides and β-vicianoside (6-O-α-l-arabinopyranosyl-β-d-glucopyranoside) but poorly hydrolyzed β-gentiobiosides (6-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-β-d-glucopyranosides), indicating high substrate specificity for the disaccharide glycone moiety. The FH exhibited activity toward p-allylphenyl β-d-glucopyranoside containing the same aglycone as furcatin but little activity toward the other β-d-glucopyranosides. Stereochemical analysis using 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed that FH is a retaining glycosidase. The subcellular localization of FH was analyzed using green fluorescent protein fused with the putative N-terminal signal peptide, indicating that FH is localized to the chloroplast. Phylogenetic analysis of plant β-glucosidases revealed that FH clusters with β-primeverosidase, and this suggests that the disaccharide glycosidases will form a new subfamily in glycosyl hydrolase family 1.

Many plant secondary products are accumulated and stored as β-glucosides, in which one glucose unit is linked to the hydroxy group of various kinds of aglycones. Glucosylation of secondary products results in enhancement of water solubility, decrease in chemical reactivity, and reduction of biological activity compared with the corresponding free aglycones. The β-glucosides are hydrolyzed by specific β-glucosidases to release the physiologically active aglycones (1Bones A.M. Rossiter J.T. Physiol. Plant. 1996; 97: 194-208Crossref Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 2Brzobohaty B. Moore I. Kristoffersen P. Bako L. Campos N. Schell J. Palme K.

In some cases, the hydroxy group at position C-6 of the glycone moiety (glucose) of β-glucosides is further modified by a 6-O-glycosidic bond formation with various monosaccharides such as glucose, xylose, arabinose, rhamnose, and apiose. The resulting disaccharide glycosides are resistant to hydrolysis by single β-glucosidases. Stepwise and sequential reactions catalyzed by two independent glycosidases are thought to be required to hydrolyze disaccharide glycosides into two monosaccharide units and aglycones. First, endogenous and/or exogenous enzymes such as β-glucosidase and β-xylosidase hydrolyze the inter-glycosidic linkage between two sugars, then a second β-glucosidase hydrolyzes the resultant β-glucosides to release glucose and aglycones (5Gunata Z. Blondeel C. Vallier M.J. Lepoutre J.P. Sapis J.C. Watanabe N. J. Agric. Food. Chem. 1998; 46: 2748-2753Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For example, the cyanogenic diglucoside amygdalin ((R)-mandelonitrile β-gentiobioside (6-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-β-d-glucopyranoside) found in black cherry seeds) is sequentially hydrolyzed by two distinct β-glucosidases (amygdalin hydrolase and prunasin hydrolase) (6Li C.P. Swain E. Poulton J.E. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). On the other hand, some plants contain disaccharide glycosidases, which directly hydrolyze the β-glycosidic bond of disaccharide glycosides to release the corresponding disaccharide units and aglycones (Fig. 1). For example, β-primeverosidase in Camellia sinensis hydrolyzes β-primeverosides (6-O-β-d-xylopyranosyl-β-d-glucopyranosides) to liberate a primeverose unit and various aroma alcohols (7Ogawa K.

In addition, there are several similar examples for sets of glycosidases and disaccharide glycosides such as furcatin hydrolase in Viburnum furcatum Blume and furcatin (p-allylphenyl β-acuminoside (6-O-β-d-apiofuranosyl-β-d-glucopyranoside)) (9Imaseki H.

Ser. D. 1980; 290: 1071-1074Google Scholar) and a microorganism (16Yamamoto S. Okada M. Usui T. Sakata K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), biochemical properties such as the substrate specificity and the reaction mechanism are still unclear. Recently, we have succeeded in the purification and cloning of β-primeverosidase from tea leaves (8Mizutani M. Nakanishi H. Ema J.I. Ma S.J. Noguchi E. Inohara-Ochiai M. Fukuchi-Mizutani M. Nakao M. Sakata K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 2164-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This enzyme hydrolyzes the β-glycosidic bond between primeverose and aglycones. It is classified as a family 1 glycosyl hydrolase and shares greater than 50% amino acid sequence identity with various plant β-glucosidases. β-Primeverosidase shows high substrate specificity for β-primeveroside in terms of the glycone moiety and can also hydrolyze disaccharide glycosides such as β-vicianoside and β-acuminoside to some extent but does not hydrolyze monosaccharide glycosides such as β-glucosides and β-xyloside at all (17Ma S.J. Mizutani M. Hiratake J. Hayashi K. Yagi K. Watanabe N. Sakata K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2001; 65: 2719-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In recent years, the aglycone specificity of β-glucosidases has been investigated in structural and mutational analyses, and several key amino acids interacting with the aglycone moiety were identified (18Zhou J. Hartmann S. Shepherd B.K. Poulton J.E. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 1252-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Cicek M. Blanchard D. Bevans D.R. Esen A. J. Biol.

However, the mechanism of the glycone specificity in various β-glycosidases has not been clarified in detail. Comparison studies between disaccharide glycosidases and β-glucosidases will provide new insight into the mechanism of glycone recognition and binding. Leaves of V. furcatum contain a large amount of the disaccharide glycoside furcatin (p-allylphenyl 6-O-β-d-acuminoside; its incorrect structure was revised (Refs. 21Hattori S. Imaseki H. J. Am. Chem.

They also contain a unique β-glycosidase, furcatin hydrolase (FH), 1The abbreviations used are: FH, furcatin hydrolase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Hax, axial proton; Heq, equatorial proton; pNP, para-nitrophenyl; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; TLC, thin layer chromatography; NJ, neighbor-joining; RT, reverse transcription. which hydrolyzes furcatin into p-allylphenol and the disaccharide acuminose. Previously, FH activity was detected in a crude preparation of V. furcatum leaves (9Imaseki H. Yamamoto T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1961; 92: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) but has not yet been purified and characterized. In the present study, FH was partially purified and characterized. To further study the disaccharide glycosidase at the molecular and biochemical level, a cDNA encoding V. furcatum FH was isolated. Its enzymatic properties, expression pattern, and subcellular localization were also investigated. Chemicals—para-Nitrophenyl (pNP) β-d-glucopyranoside, pNP β-gentiobioside (6-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-β-d-glucopyranoside), pNP β-d-xylopyranoside, pNP α-l-arabinopyranoside, pNP β-d-galactopyranoside, and prunasin (mandelonitrile β-d-glucopyranoside) were purchased from Sigma. Amygdalin (mandelonitrile β-gentiobioside) was obtained from Wako Co.

The extract was subjected to chromatography on a charcoal column eluted with a gradient elution of 0-34% (v/v) ethyl acetate in methanol and crystallized from ethyl acetate to give furcatin (14.6 g). p-Allylphenol (chavicol) was synthesized from estragole by the method of Ohigashi and Koshimizu (24Ohigashi H. Koshimizu K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1976; 40: 2283-2287Google Scholar). Forty mmol (6 g) of estragole gave 34 mmol (4.35 g) of p-allylphenol in 80% yield. Plant Materials—V. furcatum Blume plants were sampled in the northern mountains of Kyoto, Japan. Leaves, stems, fruits, and roots were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Preparation of Crude Extracts—Frozen leaves of V. furcatum were finely ground with a pestle in a chilled mortar with liquid nitrogen. Dry ice acetone (-30 °C) was added and filtered in vacuo. The residue was washed with chilled acetone until the filtrate became nearly colorless. The residual acetone powder was placed in vacuo to remove acetone and stored at -40 °C until used. The acetone powder (10 g) was suspended in 300 ml of extraction buffer (20 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in the presence of 1.7% (w/v) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone to remove phenolic materials and stirred overnight at 4 °C. The slurry was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (crude extract) was used for further purification steps and enzymatic assays. Partial Purification of FH—All procedures were performed at 0-4 °C. An equal amount of chilled acetone was added to the crude extract with stirring and left overnight. The precipitate obtained by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min was dissolved in the extraction buffer. Ammonium sulfate was added at up to 50% saturation, and the resultant precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. The precipitate was suspended in the extraction buffer, and the suspension was centrifuged. The supernatant was dialyzed against the extraction buffer overnight. The enzyme preparation was applied to a CM-Toyopearl column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan), which was previously equilibrated with 20 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Because the active fraction was not absorbed by the column, the enzyme preparation was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0.1 to 0.7 m at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were tested for enzyme activity, and active fractions were combined and used for further tests. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Purification progress and the molecular weight of the protein were checked by SDS-PAGE with a 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The preparation of anti-β-primeverosidase polyclonal antibodies was described previously (8Mizutani M. Nakanishi H. Ema J.I. Ma S.J. Noguchi E. Inohara-Ochiai M. Fukuchi-Mizutani M. Nakao M. Sakata K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 2164-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using the β-primeverosidase antibody was done using alkaline phosphatase and an ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences). Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction—Tissue samples were finely ground in a mortar with a pestle in the presence of liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was prepared essentially as described by Chang et al. (25Chang S. Puryear J. Cairney J. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1993; 11: 113-116Crossref Scopus (2977) Google Scholar), except that the extraction buffer consisted of 2% (w/v) cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 20 mm EDTA, 1.4 m NaCl, and 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. Based on highly conserved regions in the amino acid sequences of plant family 1 β-glucosidases including β-primeverosidase, the following four degenerate primers were designed; AHN1 (according to the conserved sequence for FG-DRVK(R)H(E/Y)): 5′-TTYGGIGAYAGRGTNAARCA-3′, AHN2 (for I(V)WDT(V/N)F(Y)TH(K)): 5′-ATHTGGGAYACITTYACNCA-3′, AHN3 (for I(V)TENGM(V/R/I/T)D(G/P/A/N)): 5′-TCCATICCRTTYTCNGTDAT-3′, and AHN4 (for GY(F)T(K)V(Q/Y/P/S/E)RF(Y)G): 5′-CCRAAYCTYTGIGTRTANCC-3′. One microgram of total RNA was used to synthesize the first strand cDNA using an RNA PCR Kit (version 2.1; Takara). Reverse transcription was carried out at 42 °C, and the PCR was undertaken for 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 45 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 50 s at 45 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C. PCR products were analyzed on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel, and cDNA fragments of expected size were recovered from the agarose gel using a Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and cloned into a pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Isolation of a Full-length FH cDNA—A cDNA library was constructed from total RNA of V. furcatum leaves. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using an Oligotex™-dT30 (Super) kit (Takara). The cDNA was synthesized and inserted in a ZipLox vector using a SuperScript™ Lambda System for cDNA Synthesis and λ Cloning (Invitrogen). Approximately 250,000 cDNA-containing phages were screened on nylon filters (Hybond-N, Amersham Biosciences) using an alkaline phosphatase-labeled probe based on a PCR product obtained with degenerate primers. A total of five positive phages were isolated and converted to plasmids. DNA sequence analysis showed that all five clones were identical, except for their length, and the longest clone was selected for further analysis. Because this clone did not contain a full-length cDNA, the 5′ end cDNA was obtained by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) with a 5′-Full RACE Core Set (Takara) and gene-specific primers. The PCR product containing a start codon was found to overlap with the previously isolated cDNA clone. RT-PCR was performed to obtain a full-length cDNA using the primers FH1 (5′-ATGGCCACCATCACGACACTAG-3′; sense) and FH2 (5′-CTATTTGCCGAAGAGCTTCTTG-3′; antisense), and followed by cloning into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Sequencing reactions were carried out using a BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems). A DNA sequencer model 377 (PE Applied Biosystems) was used for DNA sequencing. Nucleotide sequences were analyzed using the DNASIS software system (Hitachi). Heterologous Expression of FH in E. coli—-The FH open reading frame was amplified by PCR using a set of two primers: the N-terminal primer AHN5, 5′-GTCGACATGGCCACCATCACGACACTAG-3′, containing a SalI site (underlined) and C-terminal primer AHN6, 5′-GCGGCCGCCTATTTGCCGAAGAGCTTCTTG-3′, containing a NotI site (underlined). The amplification product was cloned into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector, and its sequence was checked for PCR errors. The entire coding region of the FH cDNA was cloned in-frame as a SalI/NotI fragment into the expression vector pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Biosciences), and the constructed vector, pGEX-FH, was used for production of a fusion protein between glutathione S-transferase (GST) and FH in E. coli strain BL 21. To express the FH, the cells were grown to log phase (A600 = 0.6) at 37 °C, before isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The culture was incubated at 25 °C for an additional 15 h. The induced culture was harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were sonicated 15 times for 30 s with 30-s intervals and centrifuged at 28,000 × g for 30 min. The recombinant protein in the obtained supernatant was isolated by GST-affinity chromatography (Amersham Biosciences), and the free FH was released by a protease factor Xa (New England Biolabs). Enzyme Assays—Enzyme activity was determined by measuring the liberation of aglycones from each glycoside. Each reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 10 mm substrate, 20 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0), and 10 μl of the enzyme solution. A mixture without the enzyme was preincubated at 37 °C, and the reaction was started by adding the enzyme and stopped by the addition of 50 μlof1 m Na2CO3. The activity of a reaction mixture with pNP glycoside was determined spectrophotometrically with liberated p-nitrophenol at 405 nm. In the reaction with furcatin, 20 μl of reaction mixture was subjected to HPLC, and p-allylphenol (retention time, 7.6 min) liberated from the substrate was detected at 277 nm. In the reactions with amygdalin, prunasin, and vicianin, 20 μl of reaction mixture was subjected to HPLC, and benzaldehyde, which is a product of mandelonitrile liberated from the substrates, was detected at 250 nm. The activity toward 2-phenylethyl β-glycosides was measured by assaying the amount of 2-phenylethanol liberated from the substrate using HPLC. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (26Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 245-254Crossref Scopus (216412) Google Scholar) using the Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). HPLC and TLC Analysis—Analysis of liberated p-allylphenol was performed under the following conditions: column, Cosmosil 5C18-AR-II (4.6 × 50 mm) (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan); detection at 277 nm with a Shimadzu SPD-10AUP UV-visible detector; column temperature, 40 °C; mobile phase, 60% (v/v) methanol in water containing 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid; flow rate, 0.75 ml/min. Analysis of liberated benzaldehyde was performed under the following conditions: column, Cosmosil 5C18-AR-II (4.6 × 50 mm) (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.); detection at 250 nm with a Shimadzu SPD-10AUP UV-visible detector; column temperature, 40 °C; mobile phase, 50% (v/v) methanol in water; flow rate, 0.8 ml/min. Analysis of liberated 2-phenylethanol was performed under the following conditions: column, YMC-pack ODS-AQ (4.6 × 250 mm) (YMC Co., Kyoto, Japan); detection at 210 nm with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector; column temperature, 40 °C; mobile phase, 33% (v/v) acetonitrile in water; flow rate, 1.0 ml/min. TLC was carried out on silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck 5715, 0.25 mm), using a solvent system of butanol-water-acetic acid (3:2:1, v/v/v). Glycosides and sugars were detected by heating at 120 °C after spraying with 0.2% (w/v) naphthoresorcinol in H2SO4:ethanol (1:19, v/v). 1H NMR Analysis for Determination of Stereochemical Outcome— The method was essentially as described by Wong et al. (27Wong A.W. He S. Grubb J.H. Sly W.S. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34057-34062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furcatin (10 mg) was dissolved in 0.7 ml of D2O. FH was lyophilized and redis-solved in 40 μl of D2O. The 1H NMR spectrum of the substrate solution was recorded, and then the enzyme (40 μl) was added to the NMR tube. The tube was incubated at 37 °C and subjected to 1H NMR measurements at time intervals at 25 °C, because the axial proton (Hax) of the β-anomer of the released acuminose overlapped with the HDO signal at 37 °C. Transient Expression of GFP Fusions—Green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used as a reporter protein to examine the subcellular localization of FH. The FH cDNA fragment corresponding to the N-terminal region (amino acid residues 1-65) including a putative signal peptide was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides containing restriction sites (underlined): FH-SalI (5′-GTCGACATGGCCACCATCACGACACTAGCT-3′) and FH-NcoI (5′-CCATGGCTAACCAGTTATCTTTGTTAAAGT-3′). The amplified DNA fragment was ligated into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and digested with SalI and NcoI. The DNA fragment was ligated into SalI-NcoI sites behind the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S (CaMV35S) promoter of the vector CaMV35S-sGFP-NOS3′ kindly provided by Niwa (28Chiu W.-I. Niwa Y. Zeng W. Hirano T. Kobayashi H. Sheen J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was introduced into onion cells and Arabidopsis leaf cells with a particle bombardment device (Biolistic PDS-1000/He, Bio-Rad) with DNA coated with 1.0-μm gold particles (Bio-Rad). After bombardment, cells were incubated for 24 h at 25 °C in a solid Murashige-Skoog medium (sugar-free), before observation by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Excised leaves and onion cells were mounted in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH 7.0) under glass coverslips and observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM510). We used a filter set for GFP fluorescence (LP585 and BP505-550 for Arabidopsis cells and BP505-550 for onion cells). Phylogenetic Analysis—To investigate the evolutionary relationships between FH and its relatives, a multiple alignment of members of glycosyl hydrolase family 1 from various plants was constructed with ClustalW 1.81 (29Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55757) Google Scholar). A human β-glucosidase (AF323990) was included in the alignment as an outgroup. Based on the alignment, an unrooted molecular phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method (30Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). For the analysis, the sites including gaps were excluded from the multiple alignment. The genetic distance between every pair of aligned sequences was calculated as the maximum like-hood estimate (31Felsenstein J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 418-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using the JTT model (32Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 275-282PubMed Google Scholar) for the amino acid substitutions. Based on these distances, an NJ tree was constructed for all of the sequences included in the alignment. The statistical significance of the NJ tree topology was evaluated by bootstrap analysis (33Felsenstein J. Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 1000 iterative tree constructions. For the phylogenetic analysis, two software packages, PHYLIP 3.5c (34Felsenstein J. PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package), Version 3.5c. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA1993Google Scholar) and MOLPHY 2.3b3 (35Adachi J. Hasegawa M. MOLPHY (Programs for Molecular Phylogenetics), Version 2.3b3. Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Tokyo1996Google Scholar), were used. The tree was drawn by TreeView (36Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Partial Purification of FH from V. furcatum Leaves—Table I summarizes the purification of FH from 20 g of acetone powder of V. furcatum leaves, resulting in a 5.78-fold purification of FH, with a yield of 20.5%. After DEAE-Sepharose chromatography, the purity of the preparation was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by CBB staining (Fig. 2A). The protein fractions contained a major protein with a molecular mass of 56 kDa, but there were several minor contaminants of around 60 and 45 kDa. Because of limitations in plant materials and enzymes, we could not proceed further with the purification. Subsequently, the peptide sequences of this enzyme could not be obtained in this study.Table ISummary of the purification of FH from V. furcatum leavesProteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgunitsunit/mg protein%-foldCrude extract50.33677.301001Acetone precipitate14.722815.562.12.1250% (NH4)2SO4 precipitate6.1112520.533.92.81CM-Toyopearl4.0312130.032.94.11DEAE-Sepharose1.7875.442.220.55.78 Open table in a new tab The partially purified FH showed β-primeverosidase activity as well as β-acuminosidase activity. Ma et al. (17Ma S.J. Mizutani M. Hiratake J. Hayashi K. Yagi K. Watanabe N. Sakata K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2001; 65: 2719-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) reported that β-primeverosidase from tea leaves was capable of hydrolyzing β-vicianoside and β-acuminoside to some extent, suggesting similar properties between FH and β-primeverosidase. Thus, to identify the FH protein in the preparation, Western blot analysis was performed using an anti-β-primeverosidase polyclonal antibody (Fig. 2B). A single clear band, which was identical to the major 56-kDa protein in the final preparation, was detected. In addition, the signal increased during the purification procedures, indicating that a native FH was immunoreactive with the anti-β-primeverosidase sera. This result suggests that FH will be a 56-kDa protein with a primary structure similar to β-primeverosidase. It was therefore expected that FH, like β-primeverosidase, would belong to glycosyl hydrolase family 1. cDNA Cloning of FH—To obtain the cDNA encoding FH, we attempted to isolate cDNAs coding for family 1 glycosidases that are abundantly expressed in V. furcatum leaves.

https://openalex.org/W2057550477,"The effect of Ca2+ in calpain activation is mediated via several binding sites in the enzyme molecule. To test the contribution of structural elements suspected to be part of this Ca2+ relay system, we made a site-directed mutagenesis study on calpains, measuring consequential changes in Ca2+ binding and Ca2+ sensitivity of enzyme activity. Evidence is provided for earlier suggestions that an acidic loop in domain III and the transducer region connecting domains III and IV are part of the Ca2+ relay system. Wild-type Drosophila Calpain B domain III binds two to three Ca2+ ions with a Kd of 3400 μm. Phospholipids lower this value to 220 μm. Ca2+ binding decreases in parallel with the number of mutated loop residues. Deletion of the entire loop abolishes binding of the ion. The Ca2+ dependence of enzyme activity of various acidic-loop mutants of Calpain B and rat m-calpain suggests the importance of the loop in regulating activity. Most conspicuously, the replacement of two adjacent acidic residues in the N-terminal half of the loop evokes a dramatic decrease in the Ca2+ need of both enzymes, lowering half-maximal Ca2+ concentration from 8.6 to 1.3 mm for Calpain B and from 250 to 7 μm for m-calpain. Transducer-region mutations in m-calpain also facilitate Ca2+ activation with the most profound effect seen upon shortening the region by deletion mutagenesis. All of these data along with structural considerations suggest that the acidic loop and the transducer region form an interconnected, extended structural unit that has the capacity to integrate and transduce Ca2+-evoked conformational changes over a long distance. A schematic model of this “extended transducer” mechanism is presented. The effect of Ca2+ in calpain activation is mediated via several binding sites in the enzyme molecule.

A schematic model of this “extended transducer” mechanism is presented. Calpains are a family of calcium-dependent cytoplasmic cysteine proteinases, regulatory enzymes transducing intracellular Ca2+ signals into limited proteolysis of their substrate proteins. Members of this family are thought to have diverse and basic functions in the regulation of various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal remodeling, cell cycle, apoptosis, and motility (1Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 2Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 1998; 245: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Calpains also take part in some pathological processes, such as muscular dystrophy, cataract, diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (6Huang Y. Wang K.K. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 355-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Distinct isoforms in vertebrates include the ubiquitous μ- and m-calpain-specific and some tissue-specific forms, e.g. muscle-specific p94 (CAPN3), or the stomach-specific nCL-2 and nCL-4. Calpain homologues have also been described in lower organisms such as insects, nematodes, and fungi and, most recently, in plants (7Lid S.E. Gruis D. Jung R. Lorentzen J.A. Ananiev E. Chamberlin M. Niu X. Meeley R. Nichols S. Olsen O.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5460-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The mammalian ubiquitous μ- and m-calpains (CAPN1 and CAPN2) are the best-characterized members of the family. They are traditionally held to be heterodimers of a distinct 80-kDa large subunit and a common 30-kDa small subunit. Recently, we have cloned a homologue of the small subunit, which can substitute for the common small subunit in vitro (8Schád E. Farkas A. Jékely G. Tompa P. Friedrich P. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 383-388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). μ-Calpain and m-calpain also differ in the concentration of Ca2+ required for their half-maximal activation in vitro, which is ∼50 μm for μ-calpain and 200 μm for m-calpain. Both of these values are far above the Ca2+ concentrations normally available in the cytoplasm. Autolysis, an autoproteolytic process in which the enzyme cuts its N-terminal tail and so becomes active, decreases the Ca2+ requirement (9Baki A. Tompa P. Alexa A. Molnar O. Friedrich P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). On the basis of sequence homology, the large subunit has been divided into four domains (I–IV) and the small subunit has been divided into two domains (V–VI) (4Ohno S. Emori Y. Imajoh S. Kawasaki H. Kisaragi M. Suzuki K. Nature. 1984; 312: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), of which domain II is a papain-like cysteine protease domain, whereas domains IV and VI are calmodulin-like Ca2+-binding domains. The high resolution x-ray structures of rat (10Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and human (11Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) m-calpain support this domain assignment and explain the strict Ca2+ dependence of calpain activity. In the absence of Ca2+, the protease domain is separated into two halves by a deep crevice that prevents residues of the catalytic triad from assuming the correct spatial positions for substrate hydrolysis. In this inactive state, interactions with other domains hold the two halves of the catalytic domain apart. Domain IIa is held by the N-terminal α-helix of the large subunit termed domain I (11Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) or anchor peptide (10Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and domain IIb is mostly positioned by multiple salt bridges between its clustered Lys226, Lys230, and Lys234 residues and an acidic loop in domain III composed of 8–10 Asp/Glu residues. To explain the activation of the enzyme, it has been suggested that binding of Ca2+ to domains IV and VI induces conformational changes, which relieve the structural constraints on both sides of the catalytic domain, leading to the assembly of the competent active site (10Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 11Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In the absence of the high resolution structure of the Ca2+-bound active form of the enzyme, this mechanism lacks direct structural evidence. Nevertheless, there are several observations that indirectly support this activation model. The isolated catalytic core of the enzyme, “minicalpain,” which is free of the above constraints, is inclined to form the closed, catalytically competent conformation in the presence of Ca2+ (12Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The two Ca2+ ions bound to two non-EF hand sites in minicalpain play a decisive role in activation, as evidenced by site directed mutagenesis (13Moldoveanu T. Jia Z. Davies P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6106-6114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The release of the anchor peptide occurs by autolytic removal upon calpain activation (9Baki A. Tompa P. Alexa A. Molnar O. Friedrich P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For the release of domain IIb, the evidence mainly derives from the structural analogy of domain III with C2 domains, originally found in protein kinase C and later in a range of other Ca2+-regulated lipid-binding proteins (14Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Ca2+ binding by the acidic loop of domain III breaks salt bridges between domains III and IIb, thus allowing IIb to move toward IIa and close the active site crevice (11Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In accord, abrogation of the critical salt bridges by point mutations of lysines in domain IIb was found to significantly reduced the Ca2+ requirement of activation (15Hosfield C.M. Moldoveanu T. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Jia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7404-7407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, isolated domain III was shown to bind Ca2+ and phospholipids in a mutually dependent manner (16Tompa P. Emori Y. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. Friedrich P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Despite all of these data, there are three critical mechanistic elements of calpain activation, which have never been tested experimentally. First, there is no direct evidence that the acidic loop of domain III is a Ca2+ binding motif. Second, it has not been demonstrated that Ca2+ binding by this loop, should it occur, contributes to the activation of the enzyme. Third, it has never been shown that the 15-residue long linker or transducer (10Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 11Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) segment connecting domains III and IV plays a role in activation as suggested previously (10Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). To address these issues, we tested the function of these two critical structural elements by targeted mutations (Fig. 1). By mutating the loop region of isolated domain III from Calpain B, we tested whether this region acidic loop is responsible for the Ca2+ binding of this domain. As the Ca2+-binding capacity clearly correlated with the extent of loop modification, we selected two types of domain III mutants, one with strongly reduced and the other with moderately reduced Ca2+ binding, and the corresponding mutations were made in the whole enzymes, Drosophila Calpain B and rat m-calpain (Fig. 1B). The increase of Ca2+ sensitivity of these mutant enzymes attests to the importance of Ca2+ binding by the loop region in calpain activation. Finally, we examined the consequences of modifying the transducer segment by mutagenesis in various ways. The goal of modifying this segment (Fig. 1C) is to examine whether it can mediate the minor (17Lin G.D. Chattopadhyay D. Maki M. Wang K.K. Carson M. Jin L. Yuen P.W. Takano E. Hatanaka M.

From all of the data obtained, an “extended transducer” model is proposed for calpain activation in which the acidic loop and the transducer act in a concerted manner.

Construction of Expression Vectors—PET-20b-Calpain B-DIII-CHis6 encoding domain III of Drosophila Calpain B was constructed as described previously (16Tompa P. Emori Y. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K.

The cDNA corresponding to full-length Drosophila Calpain B was amplified from the LD16770 sequencing vector by using proofreading Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and primers 5′-CTAGCTAGCATGTACGGCATTGATAATTACCCC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGAGAGTAAATTGTTCGCTCCAG-3′. The PCR product was digested with NheI and XhoI and ligated into the corresponding sites of the pET21c expression vector.

Cells were grown in NZYM medium (1% N-Z-Case Plus (Sigma), 0.5% select yeast extract (Sigma), 0.5% NaCl, and 0.2% MgSO4) containing the appropriate antibiotics (ampicillin at 100 μg/ml, kanamycin at 20 μg/ml) at 37 °C, 250 rpm until A600 0.6–0.8. Induction of expression and purification of isolated domain III of Calpain B was carried out according to Tompa et al. (16Tompa P. Emori Y. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. Friedrich P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) with the exception that Talon-affinity chromatography was applied prior to renaturation. Renaturation was carried out by removal of urea by stepwise dialysis in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1 m NaCl and 8–4-2–1-0.5–0 m urea, at least for 8 h in each case. The renatured protein was dialyzed into buffer A and used immediately for equilibrium dialysis. Calpain B was prepared from both the soluble and the insoluble fractions of E. coli. To obtain wild type or mutant Calpain B from the bacterial cytosol, expression of the protein was induced by 0.05 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 20 °C for 3 h. The culture was cooled on ice and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and sonicated for 6 × 15 s at 16 μm on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a 5-ml Ni-NTA resin equilibrated with Ni-NTA buffer (lysis buffer with the exception of EDTA is 0.2 mm). The column was washed with Ni-NTA buffer containing 2% glycerol, 1% Tween 20, and 10 mm imidazole. Calpain B was eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole from 20 to 250 mm in Ni-NTA buffer. Calpain B was dialyzed into and stored in buffer A containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 4 °C. Calpain B was also prepared from inclusion bodies according to Jekely and Friedrich (23Jekely G. Friedrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23893-23900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this case, expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 3 h. The enzyme otherwise behaved the same as the cytosolic preparation. Expression of wild type or mutant rat m-calpain was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 3 h. The culture was cooled on ice and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were suspended in lysis buffer and sonicated for 6 × 15 s at 16 μm on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a 5 ml of Ni-NTA resin equilibrated with Ni-NTA buffer. The column was washed with Ni-NTA buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, and elution was carried out with Ni-NTA buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. All of the enzyme preparations were sufficiently pure for kinetic analysis as detected by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3) Equilibrium Dialysis—Equilibrium dialysis could be carried out with Calpain B domain III but not with m-calpain domain III because of the instability of the latter. The protein (1–1.5 mg/ml) in 50 μl of buffer A was put into the dialysis tubes. The bags were then transferred into vials containing 500 μl of buffer A with 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and appropriate concentrations of 45Ca2+. After 18–20 h dialysis at 4 °C, aliquots (10 μl) were taken from the equilibrating buffer and from the sample within the bag and counted for radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac 1409 DSA). Conditions were set so that the radioactivity of samples was within 20,000–30,000 cpm in 2 ml of scintillation mixture. The amount of 45Ca2+ bound to the protein was calculated from the differences between the radioactivity present in the bags and in the outside buffer. When carrying out dialysis in the presence of liposomes, the concentration of liposomes was 0.1 mg/ml both inside and outside the bag. Bovine serum albumin at a concentration (mg/ml) equal to domain III was used as a control to calculate nonspecific interactions. SDS-PAGE and densitometry were applied to determine the exact concentration of protein inside the bags at the end of dialysis. Preparation of Liposomes—Liposomes were prepared from a crude bovine brain extract of phosphoinositides (Sigma P6023) according to Tompa et al. (16Tompa P. Emori Y. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. Friedrich P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Ca2+ Overlay Assay—Samples containing 1 μg of protein in 8 m urea/buffer A were spotted on a 1 × 5-cm strip of nitrocellulose membrane pre-wetted with distilled water. The membrane was washed for 2 × 10 min with buffer A, placed on a sheet of Parafilm, and incubated with 400 μl of 30 μm 45Ca2+ (400 MBq/mmol) on a rocking shaker for 20 min at room temperature. After incubation, the membrane was washed briefly with water and dried for autoradiography on AGFA CP-B medical x-ray film. Dot intensities were determined by densitometry in a Bio-Rad GelDoc 1000 video densitometer. Fluorometric Assay of Calpain Activity—Calpain activity was measured in a JASCO FP 777 spectrofluorometer, continuously recording the increase of fluorescence corresponding to the cleavage of the substrate N-succinyl-Leu-Tyr-7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin (Sigma). The excitation wavelength was 380 nm, and emission was monitored at 460 nm. Reactions were set up in a final volume of 50 μl in buffer A containing 1 mm EDTA at room temperature. The concentration of the fluorescent substrate was 1 mm. Free Ca2+ concentration was adjusted to the value indicated. The reaction was started by the addition of calpain. The free Ca2+ concentration was determined by a commercial Ca2+-selective electrode. With Calpain B and, to a lesser extent, with m-calpain, there is a lag phase in the progress curve corresponding to activation (23Jekely G. Friedrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23893-23900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) during which enzyme activity increases until it reaches a maximum, later to decline because of slow inactivation. The maximal slope of the progress curves, determined as the maximum of the derivative relative to time, yielded enzyme activity. Specific Activity—The specific activity was calculated as the ratio of maximal activity at 5 mm free Ca2+ concentration, and the enzyme concentration was determined by the Bradford method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211906) Google Scholar). The protein content of the enzyme preparations was taken to represent the active enzymes on the following basis. Only freshly prepared enzymes were used, and the specific activities were determined on the next day after preparation. After overnight dialysis into buffer A containing 1 mm EDTA, the preparations were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove any denatured and aggregated proteins. The preparations were homogenous on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). Determination of the Number of Catalytic Cycles—At different concentrations (0.01–1 mm) of N-succinyl-Leu-Tyr-7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin, substrate hydrolysis was monitored for 1–3 h with repeated additions of m-calpain to determine the total change in fluorescence intensity caused by the full consumption of substrate. From these measurements, we obtained that deltaF (in arbitrary units) equals 250 for 1 μm substrate cleaved. This calibration was used to calculate the number of catalytic cycles performed by a given concentration of the enzyme (see below for mutant M-Δ395–404). Ca2+ Binding to Domain III of Drosophila Calpain B—The number and affinity of the Ca2+-binding sites of wild-type domain III were determined by equilibrium dialysis (Fig. 4). Domain III can bind three Ca2+ ions with a Kd of 3400 μm in the absence of liposomes and two Ca2+ ions with a Kd of 220 μm in the presence of liposomes. Thus, liposomes produce a significant increase in the affinity for Ca2+. The effect of mutations (for definition, see Fig. 2) of the acidic loop of domain III could not be studied by equilibrium dialysis because of the poor solubility of the mutants generated. Nevertheless, their Ca2+ binding could be assessed and compared with that of wild-type domain III by an overlay assay on dot blots (Table II) because the proteins thus examined were homogeneous by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The mutant and wild-type domain III samples were denatured in 8 m urea and then were spotted on nitrocellulose membrane and then washed in buffer A (see “Experimental Procedures”). This washing step apparently brought the proteins to the native form, because the binding capacity of each mutant was different in a highly reproducible manner in ∼10 parallel experiments. In case of unspecific denaturation, we would not expect such a distinct and reproducible pattern. We found that wild-type domain III of Calpain B has the highest capacity for binding Ca2+, whereas the BIII-E610A/D611A/P612A,Δ613–620 deletion mutant, which lacks all of the acidic amino acids of the loop, is practically unable to bind Ca2+. The BIII-P612A,Δ613–620 deletion mutant, in which the whole loop is excised but two acidic groups next to the loop are present, retains approximately one-third of the original Ca2+-binding capacity. Mutations in the N-terminal part of the loop have greater effect on Ca2+ binding than mutations in the C-terminal part. For example, the BIII-D617N/D618N mutant binds twice as much Ca2+ as the BIII-D613N/D614N mutant, 60 and 30% binding capacity of wild type. The BIII-E610Q/D611N/D613N/D614N mutant (four amino acids changed in the N-part of the loop) has 16.2% binding capacity, whereas BIII-E615Q/D616N/D617N/D618N (four mutations in the C-part of the loop) binds 36%. In general, the more acidic amino acids are substituted with neutral ones, the lower the capacity is to bind Ca2+. Overall, from the Ca2+ overlay assay, we can draw the conclusion that the acidic loop of Calpain B domain III and its two adjoining residues on the N-terminal side are responsible for Ca2+ binding of the domain.Table IICa2+ binding to wild type and mutant recombinant domains III of Calpain B 1 μg of wild type or mutant domain III was dotted on a nitrocellulose membrane and laid over with 45Ca2+. Radioactivity of Ca2+ bound to the protein was visualized by autoradiography.

Emori Y. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. Friedrich P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The effect of phospholipids, which increase the strength of Ca2+ binding by approximately an order of magnitude and lower the number of bound ions possibly due to steric hindrance, is in line with prior da"

While various models can be conceived to explain the results, the study at least eliminated the possibility that the misfolded VSVG failed to exit because it is tethered to the immobile ER matrix (19Hendershot L.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E105-E106Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Movements of newly synthesized proteins could affect their folding per se. Collision of two molecules exposing hydrophobic patches on their surfaces could result in the formation of aggregates. Also, folding rates depend on the frequency of collision with molecular chaperones. Hence, it is expected that the mobility of proteins during folding is regulated in living cells. However, this is hard to measure by FRAP because FRAP records the average motion of a mass population and its time resolution is not sufficient for complicated dynamics including submillisecond diffusion. For measuring such random diffusional motion of an individual protein, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is, at present, the only practical method (20Rigler R. Elson E.L.

FCS detects fluctuation of the fluorescence intensity in a confocally defined volume with a sharply focused laser. This method has been developed as a unique technique to measure translational and rotational diffusion coefficients of molecules in solution and in living cells (22Hess S.T. Huang S. Heikal A.A.

Application of this technique to biological systems has brought to light novel aspects of various molecular dynamisms, such as the status of the tubulin complex in kinesin-mediated axonal transport in the squid giant axon (26Terada S. Kinjo M. Hirokawa N. Cell. 2000; 103: 141-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, this method has not been used to analyze the process of protein maturation in living cells. To study the dynamics of immature proteins, we reasoned that we might be able to use the thermal sensitivity of tyrosinase, a melanosomal membrane enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of monohydric phenols, a critical step in melanin biosynthesis (EC 1.14.18.1) (27Hearing V.J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 154-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Failure to express its catalytic activity results in the occurrence of oculocutaneous albinism type I (28Spritz R.A. Hearing V.J. Hirschhorn K. Harris H. Advances in Human Genetics. Plenum Press, New York1994: 1-5Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Pigment cells from individuals with some types of this disorder are temperature-sensitive (29Halaban R. Svedine S. Cheng E. Smicun Y. Aron R. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

When wild type tyrosinase is expressed in non-pigmented cells, its folding is also sensitive to heat (31Berson J.F. Frank D.W. Calvo P.A. Bieler B.M. Marks M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12281-12289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Completion of tyrosinase folding is a well defined step in that it can be monitored by the acquisition of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) oxidizing activity either in situ or in solution, and it depends entirely on interactions with calnexin (32Petrescu S.M.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 37Simmen T. Schmidt A. Hunziker W. Beermann F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 45-53PubMed Google Scholar, 38Calvo P.A. Frank D.W.

Pigment Cell Res. 2000; 13: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this study we first tested whether the diffusion of folded tyrosinase is measurable. We then studied how the dynamics change in the thermally restricted condition. We also used FRAP to determine the fraction of the population that was immobilized. Our results show that folding appears to be regulated at various levels of microdynamics. Expression Vectors and Culture Cells—The adenovirus vector used to express tyrosinase is described elsewhere (41Hirosaki K. Yamashita T. Wada I. Jin H.Y. Jimbow K. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 475-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). EcoRI and BamHI sites were attached to the human tyrosinase cDNA (35Toyofuku K. Wada I. Hirosaki K. Park J.S. Hori Y. Jimbow K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Tyrosinase fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) or cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) was then produced by ligating the human tyrosinase into pEYFP-N1 or pECFP-N1 (BD Bioscience) cut with EcoRI and BamHI, respectively. For construction of the Sar1(T39N) expression vector, Sar1 cDNA was isolated by reverse transcription from HepG2 RNA using the primer 5′-GGATCAGTCCAGAGAAGTAAAAC-3′, then amplified by PCR with the pair of primers 5′-GCCGGAGAGCCCCTCAGGCCGTAGTAAGC-3′ and 5′-TCACCGTCCAAACATCAGTCAATATACTGG-3′. Restriction sites for BglII and KpnI were created at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the Sar1 cDNA using PCR. The Sar1 cDNA was then ligated into the corresponding sites of pEYFP-N1Δ whose EYFP open reading frame was removed by restriction with BamHI and NotI followed by ligation after polishing the terminus. To construct the GDP-restricted form of Sar1, the codon for Thr at amino acid 36 was mutated to that encoding Asn using the QuikChange™ protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). An expression vector for CFP-GT-(1-81) (GT-(1-81); the amino-terminal 81 amino acids of human β-1,4-galactosyltransferase) were purchased from Clontech. A vector for VSVG (ts045) was described previously (42Nagaya H. Wada I. Jia Y.-J. Kanoh H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 302-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These vectors were introduced directly into cells using siliconized glass microbeads (42Nagaya H. Wada I. Jia Y.-J. Kanoh H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 302-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). SiHa and COS7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). COS7 cells stably expressing hSec13-YFP were generated as follows. The coding sequence of human Sec13-YFP (42Nagaya H. Wada I. Jia Y.-J. Kanoh H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 302-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the appropriate cloning sites of the retrovirus expression vector, pCX4bsr. pCX4bsr, a generous gift from Dr. T. Akagi (Osaka BioScience Institute), is a modified version of pCXbsr (43Akagi T. Shishido T. Murata K. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7290-7295Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) that lacks the internal initiation codons within the gag region. The recombinant retrovirus was generated as described (43Akagi T. Shishido T. Murata K. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7290-7295Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and used to infect COS7 cells. The cells expressing hSec13 were selected by culturing them in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing blasticidin (10 μg/ml). Analysis of Protein Dynamics in Living Cells—Live cell analysis using the microscopy was essentially described previously (42Nagaya H. Wada I. Jia Y.-J. Kanoh H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 302-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The culture temperature of cells on the microscope stage was controlled using an objective heater for a planapochromat lens ×63 (Bioptechs, Butler, PA) or a Silicon Heater (Cell MicroControls, Norfolk, VA) for a C-Apochromat ×40 lens in combination with a stage heater (Kitazato Supply, Fujinomiya, Japan). To monitor the temperature of the cells under observation, an infrared thermometer (model CT820, CITIZEN Co., Tokyo, Japan) was used. For confocal microscopy and FCS analysis, a ConfoCor2 instrument (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) was used. Confocal images were taken with the laser scanning microscopy module. The excitation light of an argon ion laser at 514 nm was reflected by a dichroic mirror (HFT 514) and focused through a C-Apochromat ×40, NA = 1.2 water immersion objective (pinhole width 70 μm). A 530-560 nm band-pass filter was used to filter out the remaining scattered laser light. In all measurements, the minimum laser power of the setup was used. The fluorescence signal was recorded for three consecutive periods of 15 s (time resolution, 200 ns). The autocorrelation function and data fitting was performed with the software provided with the setup. Indirect immunofluorescence of fixed cells and time-lapse analysis of fluorescent molecules in live cells were carried out and processed as described previously by Nagaya et al. (42Nagaya H. Wada I. Jia Y.-J. Kanoh H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 302-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For FRAP experiments, an area (1 μm2) was exposed to the maximum power of the argon laser and then the recovery from the bleaching was measured at the minimum power of the laser. The obtained data were analyzed by fitting to a formula for one-dimensional diffusion (44Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar) using Prism version 3.0 software (San Diego, CA). Tyrosinase Activity Measurements and Sedimentation Analysis—Active staining of DOPA oxidase and spectrophotomeric measurements of DOPA oxidase activity in cellular lysates were carried out as described (35Toyofuku K. Wada I. Hirosaki K. Park J.S. Hori Y. Jimbow K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To determine the sedimentation velocity of tyrosinase synthesized under various culture conditions, cells in a 60-mm dish were lysed with 0.5 ml of 1% sodium cholate, 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, and directly loaded onto a sucrose gradient from 25 to 10% in 0.3% sodium cholate, 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, in a tube for a Hitachi RPS40T rotor. After centrifugation at 36,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C, ten 1-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube and 10 μl from each fraction was subjected to immunoblot analysis using an anti-tyrosinase monoclonal antibody (Novocastra Laboratories Ltd., Balliol Business Park West, UK). FCS Measurements of Tyrosinase Expressed in Non-pigmented Cells—To test whether we could use the reported thermal sensitivity of tyrosinase folding to synchronize its maturation, we first examined the heat lability of its folding and stability. A recombinant adenovirus was used to express tyrosinase in human cervical carcinoma SiHa cells for 24 h at 37 °C and at various other temperatures (Fig. 1A). For the cells incubated at 37 °C, protein synthesis was halted by the addition of puromycin and the cells were further incubated for 24 h at the indicated temperatures. The cells were then lysed with detergents and the DOPA oxidase activity was determined (35Toyofuku K. Wada I. Hirosaki K. Park J.S. Hori Y. Jimbow K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The DOPA oxidase activity was dramatically reduced when tyrosinase was synthesized above 39 °C (Fig. 1A, inset). In contrast, thermal treatment of folded tyrosinase (i.e. tyrosinase synthesized at 37 °C) had little effects on the activity, indicating that completion of tyrosinase folding is arrested above 39 °C. Importantly, when the inactive tyrosinase formed at 40 °C was further incubated at 37 °C in the presence of puromycin, the protein became almost fully active with 60 min (Fig. 1A, squares). This activation was not observed in ATP-depleted medium (circles) or in the presence of an α-glucosidase inhibitor (triangles). We then used this protocol to study how the mobility of tyrosinase is regulated during maturation. We reasoned that the diffusion profile of thermally misfolded tyrosinase may be distinct from the properly folded molecule if there is any regulation of mobility. To analyze mobility, we used FCS because this technique has the highest time resolution of the available techniques. However, it is known that FCS is often too sensitive to analyze cellular processes (21Elson E.L. Traffic. 2001; 2: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In particular, photobleaching is a major obstacle. We therefore examined the conditions in which FCS could detect random diffusion in living cells. Because the degree of photobleaching obtained by FCS should correlate with the density of the molecules, we investigated which expression level would largely allow for random diffusion. In cells where the expression level is too high, the molecules would be at least partially immobilized. To achieve various levels of expression, we used siliconized glass microbeads (42Nagaya H. Wada I. Jia Y.-J. Kanoh H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 302-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). When photon-counting of tyrosinase-YFP was carried out in formalin-fixed cells, all fluorophores showed rapid decay of fluorescence to near background within 45 s, as expected (Fig. 1B, left panel). The fluctuation of the signal was almost at the level of noise, and no autocorrelation was observed from this counting (not shown). We next examined whether this setup could detect diffusion of tyrosinase-YFP expressed in a living cell at 37 °C for 2 h in the presence of brefeldin A, which prevents export from the ER (45Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this measurement, the degree of photobleaching was reduced compared with that in the fixed cells, and massive signal fluctuation was observed (Fig. 1B, right panel). When we plotted the extent of bleaching, B, against the expression level, Iini, we noticed that the relationship largely fits a simple saturable binding model: B = Bmax·Iini/(K + Iini). The constant K reflects the degree of correlation between photobleaching and the expression level. In the case of fixed cells, K should be ∼0. If the level of tyrosinase expression has little influence on diffusional motion in the membrane, K should far exceed Iini. This would happen if the fluorophore is very bright, so that the number of expressed molecules is very small. However, when measured in the living cells, this is not the case. In the living cells, a significant correlation was observed between the two values when the initial count rate was below 100 kHz (Fig. 1C, ×), suggesting that at least tyrosinase-YFP was not saturated at this range and, thus, random diffusion of tyrosinase-YFP should be measurable. Regulation of Diffusional Mobility of Thermally Misfolded Tyrosinase—We next expressed tyrosinase-YFP at 40 °C and plotted the degree of photobleaching against the number of misfolded molecules. Surprisingly, massive photobleaching was observed irrespective of the expression level (Fig. 2A). A typical decay curve is shown in Fig. 2B (top panel), which resembles that of the fixed protein (Fig. 1B). It should be noted that, different from the fixed cells, the decay in living cells reached a plateau at a significantly higher level than background (∼1 kHz), suggesting the presence of a slow movement of nonbleached tyrosinase into the bleached area. However, this mobility was too slow to be captured by FCS. Nonetheless, the counting showed almost no autocorrelation over time (Fig. 2C, black line). To know if this lack of fluctuation is reversed when folding is allowed, we recorded the fluorescence in the same spot over a temperature shift from 40 °C (Fig. 2B, top) to 37 °C (Fig. 2B, middle and bottom). In these cases, fluctuation emerged upon temperature shift (Fig. 2B, middle). Interestingly, an almost identical autocorrelation curve was observed when incubation was continued at 37 °C for another 10 min (Fig. 2C, red line), except for a slight increase in the population with the faster mobility in the millisecond range. A two-component fitting analysis indicated that the mobility was composed of fast (T = 0.64 ms, 50.7%) and slow (T = 9.17 ms, 49.3%) diffusion components (Fig. 2C, bottom panel). While these results indicated that the random diffusion detected by FCS was suppressed at 40 °C, they also suggested that the protein was slowly mobile at this temperature. We therefore examined whether such dynamics might be detected by FRAP. To test this possibility, we first assayed the rates of reversible photobleaching in fixed cells (46Swaminathan R. Hoang C.P. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1900-1907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). An area of a formalin-fixed tyrosinase-YFP was photobleached by a pulse of intense laser beam, and the recovery rate was determined. As shown in Fig. 3A, the maximum laser beam reduced the signal to 42% of the initial level and within 1 s the intensity increased to 50% and remained there, suggesting that any recovery above 50% should be because of fluorophore exchange between the bleached and unbleached areas. We then determined the fraction of immobilized molecules in the living cells. While the fluorescence intensity of an area of tyrosinase-YFP synthesized for 2 h at 40 °C was reduced almost as much as it was in the fixed cell by an intense laser beam, the signal in the area recovered almost fully (Fig. 3B, red). Similarly, full recovery from photobleaching was observed in the adjacent area when the cell was incubated on the stage at 37 °C for 15 min after 40 °C expression for 2 h although it appeared to be slightly faster (Fig. 3B, blue). These results and further independent experiments, as summarized in Fig. 3C, indicates that tyrosinase synthesized at 40 °C was slow, but fully mobile. Diffusional Mobility of Aggregated Tyrosinase Formed in Castanospermine-treated Cells—To know whether the apparent lack of random diffusion seen with FCS measurements at non-permissive temperatures was because of the formation of large aggregates, we measured the molecular weight of detergent-solubilized tyrosinase using sedimentation analysis through sucrose density gradients. As shown in Fig. 4A, tyrosinase synthesized at the non-permissive temperature, 40 °C, was mostly found in the bottom three fractions of the gradient (red line). After 30 min at 37 °C, the majority was still found in the bottom fractions, but a slight increase in the recovery in fractions 4 and 5 was observed (green line). After 1 h at 37 °C, a small decrease in the percentage of tyrosinase in the bottom fraction was detected (blue line). An almost identical pattern was obtained at 2 h postincubation. 2A. Kamada, H. Nagaya, T. Tamura, M. Kinjo, H.-Y. Jin, T. Yamashita, K. Jimbow, H. Kanoh, and I. Wada, unpublished data. However, the molecules did not acquire the compact tertiary structure detected for the native enzyme synthesized without exposure to 40 °C (black line). When we examined terminally misfolded tyrosinase synthesized in the presence of an α-glucosidase inhibitor, castanospermine, the majority of the molecules were recovered in the bottom fractions, suggesting that they are largely aggregated. This analysis suggests that a slight alteration in size of tyrosinase aggregates is associated with the acquisition of activity, and that the thermally misfolded tyrosinase is structurally distinct from terminally misfolded tyrosinase. To examine the possibility that the suppression of millisecond diffusion at the non-permissive temperature was caused by enhanced aggregation, we measured diffusion of the terminally misfolded tyrosinase synthesized in castanospermine-treated cells at 37 °C. However, in this case, the autocorrelation analysis showed that the diffusion of the slower mobility component was slightly slower but detectable by FCS (Fig. 5A). The typical measurement showed that the diffusion was composed of a fast (586.8 μs, 45.6%) and a slow (18.7 ms, 54.4%) diffusion (Fig. 5A). A summary of FCS measurements at various conditions is also shown in Fig. 5B. Hence, we conclude that the lack of autocorrelation at the non-permissive temperature was not the result of enlarged aggregates. However, FRAP analysis of the castanospermine-treated cells showed that the maximum recovery rate was reduced by ∼30% (Fig. 5C). Taken together, we reasoned that l"

Kinetic assays revealed that Spo0A∼P stimulated both the rate of formation of initiated complexes as well as increasing the number of complexes capable of initiating transcription.
