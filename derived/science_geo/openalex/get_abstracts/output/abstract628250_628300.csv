Light-emitting defects in diamond and quantum dots grown by molecular beam epitaxy have demonstrated transform-limited emission linewidths. However, they are limited in terms of production scalability and reproducibility between individual emitters. Utzat et al. now show that perovskite quantum dots can overcome these limitations and provide unprecedented versatility for the generation of indistinguishable single photons or entangled photon pairs for quantum information processing.

However, the physical processes that produced that emission remain poorly understood, particularly the late-time x-ray and radio emission. Ghirlanda et al. observed the radio afterglow with an interferometric array of 32 radio telescopes spread across the globe. The size and position of the radio source are not compatible with a uniformly expanding cocoon, as some have suggested. Instead, the data indicate that GW170817 produced a structured jet of material that escaped the surrounding ejecta and is now expanding into the interstellar medium at relativistic speeds.

Thus far, a deterministic and coherent interface between a single quantum system, e.g. a qubit, and such an ensemble has remained elusive. We first use an electron to cool the mesoscopic nuclear-spin ensemble of a semiconductor quantum dot to the nuclear sideband-resolved regime. We then implement an all-optical approach to access these individual quantized electronic-nuclear spin transitions. Finally, we perform coherent optical rotations of a single collective nuclear spin excitation corresponding to a spin wave called a nuclear magnon. These results constitute the building blocks of a dedicated local memory per quantum-dot spin qubit and promise a solid-state platform for quantum-state engineering of isolated many-body systems."

Yang et al. apply the same vernier principle with optical combs to develop a spectrometer that can determine the wavelength of light with high accuracy and precision. Two phase-locked counterpropagating optical microcombs generated in a miniature microresonator provided the rulers. Matching up of the “teeth” of the combs was then used to measure the wavelength of the optical light sources. Science , this issue p. 965"
https://openalex.org/W2951505541,"Grain yield is a trait of paramount importance in the breeding of all cereals. In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), yield has steadily increased since the Green Revolution, though the current rate of increase is not forecasted to keep pace with demand due to growing world population and increasing affluence. While several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on yield and related component traits have been performed in wheat, the previous lack of a reference genome has made comparisons between studies difficult. In this study, a GWAS for yield and yield-related traits was carried out on a population of 322 soft red winter wheat lines across a total of four rain-fed environments in the state of Virginia using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker data generated by a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) protocol. Two separate mixed linear models were used to identify significant marker-trait associations (MTAs). The first was a single-locus model utilizing a leave-one-chromosome-out approach to estimating kinship. The second was a sub-setting kinship estimation multi-locus method (FarmCPU). The single-locus model identified nine significant MTAs for various yield-related traits, while the FarmCPU model identified 74 significant MTAs. The availability of the wheat reference genome allowed for the description of MTAs in terms of both genetic and physical positions, and enabled more extensive post-GWAS characterization of significant MTAs. The results indicate a number of promising candidate genes contributing to grain yield, including an ortholog of the rice aberrant panicle organization (APO1) protein and a gibberellin oxidase protein (GA2ox-A1) affecting the trait grains per square meter, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis thaliana mother of flowering time and terminal flowering 1 (MFT) gene affecting the trait seeds per square meter, and a B2 heat stress response protein affecting the trait seeds per head."

Targeted inhibition of oncogenic gene products is considered the “holy grail” of present-day cancer therapy, and recent discoveries of small-molecule KRas4B inhibitors were made thanks to a deeper understanding of the structure and dynamics of this GTPase. Because interactions with biological membranes are key for Ras function, Ras–lipid interactions have become a major focus, especially because such interactions evidently involve both the Ras C terminus for lipid anchoring and its G-protein domain. Here, using NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations complemented by biophysical- and cell-biology assays, we investigated the interaction between K-Ras4B with the signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-phosphate (PIP2). We discovered that the β2 and β3 strands as well as helices 4 and 5 of the GTPase G-domain bind to PIP2 and identified the specific residues in these structural elements employed in these interactions, likely occurring in two K-Ras4B orientation states relative to the membrane. Importantly, we found that some of these residues known to be oncogenic when mutated (D47K, D92N, K104M, and D126N) are critical for K-Ras–mediated transformation of fibroblast cells, but do not substantially affect basal and assisted nucleotide hydrolysis and exchange. Moreover, the K104M substitution abolished localization of K-Ras to the plasma membrane. The findings suggest that specific G-domain residues can critically regulate Ras function by mediating interactions with membrane-associated PIP2 lipids; these insights that may inform the future design of therapeutic reagents targeting Ras activity.

We investigated the role of the circadian clock using mice bearing targeted deletion of the circadian gene brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (Bmal1) in AECs. Pulmonary neutrophil infiltration, biomechanical function, and responses to influenza infection were all disrupted. A circadian time-series RNA sequencing study of laser-captured AECs revealed widespread disruption in genes of the core circadian clock and output pathways regulating cell metabolism (lipids and xenobiotics), extracellular matrix, and chemokine signaling, but strikingly also the gain of a novel rhythmic transcriptome in Bmal1-targeted cells. Many of the rhythmic components were replicated in primary AECs cultured in air-liquid interface, indicating significant cell autonomy for control of pulmonary circadian physiology. Finally, we found that metabolic cues dictate phasing of the pulmonary clock and circadian responses to immunologic challenges. Thus, the local circadian clock in AECs is vital in lung health by coordinating major cell processes such as metabolism and immunity.—Zhang, Z.

The aim of this study was to generate a theory explaining the process by which people with diabetes learn about their disease in Indonesia. Methods This study employed a grounded theory methodology influenced by constructivism and symbolic interactionism. A total of twenty-eight face-to-face or telephone interviews with participants from Indonesia that included people with diabetes, healthcare professionals, health service providers and families of people with diabetes were conducted in both Indonesia and Australia. Results This study discloses a core category of Learning, choosing, and acting: self-management of diabetes in Indonesia as the basic social process of how people learn about their diabetes. The process includes five distinctive major categories. People with diabetes acted after they had received recommendations that they considered to be trustworthy. Factors that influenced their choice of recommendations to adopt are also identified. Conclusions Awareness of the complexity involved in their decision making will assist healthcare professionals to engage effectively with people living with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2915906854,"Background Ilio-psoas hematoma is a potentially lethal condition that can arise during hospital stay. However, neither the incidence nor the prognosis of patients whose stay in intensive care units (ICU) is complicated by a iatrogenic ilio-psoas hematoma is known. Methods A bicentric retrospective study was conducted to compile the patients who developed an ilio-psoas hematoma while they were hospitalized in ICU between January 2009 and December 2016. Their biometric characteristics, pre-existing conditions, the circumstances in which the hematoma was diagnosed, the treatments they received and their prognosis were recorded. Results Forty patients were diagnosed with an ilio-psoas hematoma during their ICU stay. The incidence of this complication was 3.8 cases for 1000 admissions, taking into account only patients who stayed more than three days in ICU. The median age of patients was 74 years old and the median time between admission and the diagnosis of ilio-psoas hematoma was 12.6 days. A large proportion of them was obese (42.5%) and/or under dialysis (50%) prior to developing their hematoma. Ninety-five percent of the patients had heparin at prophylactic or therapeutic doses. Only 10% of them were above the therapeutic range of anticoagulation. The ICU mortality rate was of 50% following this complication (versus a general mortality rate of 22% for the patients without IPH over the same period of time). Patients with IPH that were complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulopathy had a significantly higher mortality rate than those with IPH and no disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (OR 6.91, 95% CI [1.28; 58.8], p = 0.04). Conclusion Age, anticoagulation, a high body mass index and dialysis seem to be risk factors of developing an ilio-psoas hematoma in ICU. Iatrogenic ilio-psoas hematomas complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulopathies are more at risk of leading to death. It is noteworthy that activated partial thromboplastin time above the therapeutic range was not a good predictor of developing a hematoma for patients who received unfractioned heparin therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2917870472,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a technique used to modulate neuronal excitability through non-invasive brain stimulation that can enhance exercise performance. We hypothesize that tDCS would improve submaximal running time to exhaustion (TTE) and delay the increase in the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) over time. We also hypothesize that tDCS would not lead to difference in cardiorespiratory responses. We employed a randomized, single-blinded, and counterbalanced design in which 10 trained men participated. After receiving either 20 min of 1.98 mA anodal tDCS applied over the primary motor cortex (M1) or sham-operated control on separate days, participants completed a constant-load test involving running at a speed equivalent to 80% of their own maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max). During this constant-load test, RPE, heart rate (HR), VO2, pulmonary ventilation (VE), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and ventilatory threshold (VT) were continuously monitored. TTE was recorded at the end of the test. TTEs were significantly longer in the tDCS than in the sham conditions (21.18 ± 7.13 min; 18.44 ± 6.32 min; p = 0.011). For TTE, no significant differences were found in RPE between conditions at isotime. In addition, no significant differences in HR, VO2, VE, RER, and VT were found during TTE between the two stimulation conditions at any time point. These results indicate that the application of tDCS does not induce a change of the exercise performance-related index; however, it can affect the increase of the exercise duration due to the stimuli in the M1 area."
https://openalex.org/W2915700009,"Previous studies have reported the pathogenic role of C-reactive protein (CRP) during diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in human CRP transgenic and Crp-/- mice. However, because humans and mice have inverse acute phase expression patterns of CRP and serum amyloid P component, this could lead to the inaccurate evaluation of CRP function with the above-mentioned CRP transgenic mouse. But different from mice, rats have the same acute phase protein expression pattern as human, which might avoid this problem and be a better choice for CRP function studies. To dispel this doubt and accurately define the role of CRP during diabetic nephropathy, we created the first Crp-/- rat model, which we treated with streptozocin to induce DKD for in vivo studies. Moreover, an established cell line (human kidney 2) was used to further investigate the pathologic mechanisms of CRP. We found that CRP promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through Wnt/β-catenin and ERK1/2 signaling, which are dependent on CRP binding to FcγRII on apoptotic cells. By promoting EMT, CRP was demonstrated to accelerate the development of DKD. We thus present convincing evidence demonstrating CRP as a therapeutic target for DKD treatment.-Zhang, L., Shen, Z.-Y., Wang, K., Li, W., Shi, J.-M., Osoro, E. K., Ullah, N., Zhou, Y., Ji, S.-R.

https://openalex.org/W2915251823,"Organ size is regulated by intercellular signaling for cell growth and proliferation. The TOR pathway mediates a key signaling mechanism for controlling cell size and number in organ growth. Chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT) is a complex that assists protein folding and function, but its role in animal development is largely unknown. Here we show that the CCT complex is required for organ growth by interacting with the TOR pathway in Drosophila. Reduction of CCT4 results in growth defects by affecting both cell size and proliferation. Loss of CCT4 causes preferential cell death anterior to the morphogenetic furrow in the eye disc and within wing pouch in the wing disc. Depletion of any CCT subunit in the eye disc results in headless phenotype. Overgrowth by active TOR signaling is suppressed by CCT RNAi. The CCT complex physically interacts with TOR signaling components including TOR, Rheb, and S6K. Loss of CCT leads to decreased phosphorylation of S6K and S6 while increasing phosphorylation of Akt. Insulin/TOR signaling is also necessary and sufficient for promoting CCT complex transcription. Our data provide evidence that the CCT complex regulates organ growth by directly interacting with the TOR signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4250806340,"Background IgA nephropathy (IgAN), the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide, has serious outcomes with end-stage renal disease developing in 30–50% of patients. The diagnosis requires renal biopsy. Due to its inherent risks, non-invasive approaches are needed. Methods We evaluated 91 Czech patients with biopsy-proven IgAN who were assessed at time of diagnosis for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, and hypertension, and then followed prospectively. Serum samples collected at diagnosis were analyzed for galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) using new native-IgA1 and established neuraminidase-treated-IgA1 tests, Gd-IgA1-specific IgG autoantibodies, discriminant analysis and logistic regression model assessed correlations with renal function and Oxford classification (MEST score). Results Serum levels of native (P <0.005) and neuraminidase-treated (P <0.005) Gd-IgA1 were associated with the rate of eGFR decline. A higher relative degree of galactose deficiency in native serum IgA1 predicted a faster eGFR decline and poor renal survival (P <0.005). However, Gd-IgA1 has not differentiated patients with low vs. high baseline eGFR. Furthermore, patients with high baseline eGFR that was maintained during follow-up were characterized by low serum levels of Gd-IgA1-specific IgG autoantibodies (P = 0.003). Conclusions Including levels of native and neuraminidase-treated Gd-IgA1 and Gd-IgA1-specific autoantibodies at diagnosis may aid in the prognostication of disease progression in Czech patients with IgAN. Future tests will assess utility of these biomarkers in larger patients cohorts from geographically distinct areas."
https://openalex.org/W2949097641,"We describe the use of a ligation-based targeted whole transcriptome expression profiling assay, TempO-Seq, to profile formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, including H&E stained FFPE tissue, by directly lysing tissue scraped from slides without extracting RNA or converting the RNA to cDNA. The correlation of measured gene expression changes in unfixed and fixed samples using blocks prepared from a pellet of a single cell type was R2 = 0.97, demonstrating that no significant artifacts were introduced by fixation. Fixed and fresh samples prepared in an equivalent manner produced comparable sequencing depth results (+/- 20%), with similar %CV (11.5 and 12.7%, respectively), indicating no significant loss of measurable RNA due to fixation. The sensitivity of the TempO-Seq assay was the same whether the tissue section was fixed or not. The assay performance was equivalent for human, mouse, or rat whole transcriptome. The results from 10 mm2 and 2 mm2 areas of tissue obtained from 5 μm thick sections were equivalent, thus demonstrating high sensitivity and ability to profile focal areas of histology within a section. Replicate reproducibility of separate areas of tissue ranged from R2 = 0.83 (lung) to 0.96 (liver) depending on the tissue type, with an average correlation of R2 = 0.90 across nine tissue types. The average %CVs were 16.8% for genes expressed at greater than 200 counts, and 20.3% for genes greater than 50 counts. Tissue specific differences in gene expression were identified and agreed with the literature. There was negligible impact on assay performance using FFPE tissues that had been archived for up to 30 years. Similarly, there was negligible impact of H&E staining, facilitating accurate visualization for scraping and assay of small focal areas of specific histology within a section."
https://openalex.org/W2914901954,"Background The study aims to assess characteristics and outcomes of patients suffering a mechanical complication (MC) after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in a contemporary cohort of patients in the percutaneous coronary intervention era. Methods and results This retrospective single-center cohort study encompasses 2508 patients admitted with STEMI between March 9, 2009 and June 30, 2014. A total of 26 patients (1.1%) suffered a mechanical complication: ventricular septal rupture (VSR) in 17, ventricular free wall rupture (VFWR) in 2, a combination of VSD and VFWR in 2, and papillary muscle rupture (PMR) in 5 patients. Older age (74.5 ± 10.4 years versus 63.9 ± 13.1 years, p < 0.001), female sex (42.3% versus 23.3%, p = 0.034), and a longer latency period between symptom onset and angiography (> 24h: 42.3% versus 16.2%, p = 0.002) were more frequent among patients with MC as compared to patients without MC. The majority of MC patients had multivessel disease (77%) and presented in cardiogenic shock (Killip class IV: 73.1%). Nine patients (7 VSR, 2 VFWR & VSR) were treated conservatively and died. Out of the remaining 10 VSR patients, four underwent surgery, three underwent implantation of an occluder device, and another three patients had surgical repair following occluder device implantation. All patients with isolated VFWR and PMR underwent emergency surgery. At 30 days, mortality for VSR, VFWR, VFWR & VSR and PMR amounted to 71%, 50%, 100% and 0%, respectively. Conclusions Despite advances in the management of STEMI patients, mortality of mechanical complications stays considerable in this contemporary cohort. Older age, female sex, and a prolonged latency period between symptom onset and angiography are associated with the occurrence of these complications."
https://openalex.org/W2917269028,"Pneumonia remains a global health threat, in part due to expanding categories of susceptible individuals and increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistant pathogens. However, therapeutic stimulation of the lungs’ mucosal defenses by inhaled exposure to a synergistic combination of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists known as Pam2-ODN promotes mouse survival of pneumonia caused by a wide array of pathogens. This inducible resistance to pneumonia relies on intact lung epithelial TLR signaling, and inducible protection against viral pathogens has recently been shown to require increased production of epithelial reactive oxygen species (ROS) from multiple epithelial ROS generators. To determine whether similar mechanisms contribute to inducible antibacterial responses, the current work investigates the role of ROS in therapeutically-stimulated protection against Pseudomonas aerugnosa challenges. Inhaled Pam2-ODN treatment one day before infection prevented hemorrhagic lung cytotoxicity and mouse death in a manner that correlated with reduction in bacterial burden. The bacterial killing effect of Pam2-ODN was recapitulated in isolated mouse and human lung epithelial cells, and the protection correlated with inducible epithelial generation of ROS. Scavenging or targeted blockade of ROS production from either dual oxidase or mitochondrial sources resulted in near complete loss of Pam2-ODN-induced bacterial killing, whereas deficiency of induced antimicrobial peptides had little effect. These findings support a central role for multisource epithelial ROS in inducible resistance against a bacterial pathogen and provide mechanistic insights into means to protect vulnerable patients against lethal infections."
https://openalex.org/W2916617519,"Members of the MAPK superfamily are known as key regulators of ciliogenesis. Long flagellar (LF) 4, a MAPK-related kinase in Chlamydomonas, is the first kinase that was implicated in ciliary assembly and length. However, little is known about its cellular properties, regulation, and molecular functions. LF4 is localized both in the flagella and cell body with enrichment at the 2 basal bodies, shown by super-resolution microscopy. LF4 is constitutively phosphorylated at T159 at the kinase activation loop and remains at the basal bodies during flagellar assembly. Gene mutations that affect the kinase activity or T159 phosphorylation alter the localization of LF4 at the basal bodies, and the mutants fail to rescue lf4-3, a null mutant. LF4 does not affect the velocities of intraflagellar transport (IFT). However, LF4 null mutation induces accumulation of IFT proteins in the flagellum and reduces the phosphorylation of the kinesin-II subunit FLA8/KIF3B, indicating that LF4 negatively regulates IFT entry. Furthermore, LF2, a cell cycle-related kinase, and LF3, a novel protein, are required for LF4 phosphorylation. Our study demonstrates that LF4 is likely a constitutively active kinase that is regulated by LF2 and regulates IFT entry at the basal bodies to control flagellar assembly and length.-Wang, Y., Ren, Y., Pan, J.

https://openalex.org/W2952857690,"Robot-assisted training is a promising tool under development for improving walking function based on repetitive goal-oriented task practice. The challenges in developing the controllers for gait training devices that promote desired changes in gait is complicated by the limited understanding of the human response to robotic input. A possible method of controller formulation can be based on the principle of bio-inspiration, where a robot is controlled to apply the change in joint moment applied by human subjects when they achieve a gait feature of interest. However, it is currently unclear how lower extremity joint moments are modulated by even basic gait spatio-temporal parameters. In this study, we investigated how sagittal plane joint moments are affected by a factorial modulation of two important gait parameters: gait speed and stride length. We present the findings obtained from 20 healthy control subjects walking at various treadmill-imposed speeds and instructed to modulate stride length utilizing real-time visual feedback. Implementing a continuum analysis of inverse-dynamics derived joint moment profiles, we extracted the effects of gait speed and stride length on joint moment throughout the gait cycle. Moreover, we utilized a torque pulse approximation analysis to determine the timing and amplitude of torque pulses that approximate the difference in joint moment profiles between stride length conditions, at all gait speed conditions. Our results show that gait speed has a significant effect on the moment profiles in all joints considered, while stride length has more localized effects, with the main effect observed on the knee moment during stance, and smaller effects observed for the hip joint moment during swing and ankle moment during the loading response. Moreover, our study demonstrated that trailing limb angle, a parameter of interest in programs targeting propulsion at push-off, was significantly correlated with stride length. As such, our study has generated assistance strategies based on pulses of torque suitable for implementation via a wearable exoskeleton with the objective of modulating stride length, and other correlated variables such as trailing limb angle."
https://openalex.org/W2915200291,"M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are highly expressed in key areas that control cognition, such as the cortex and hippocampus, representing one potential therapeutic target for cognitive dysfunctions of Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. We have reported that M1 receptors facilitate cognition by promoting membrane insertion of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor AMPA receptor subunit 1 (GluA1) through phosphorylation at Ser845. However, the signaling pathway is still unclear. Here we showed that adenylyl cyclase inhibitor 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine and PKA inhibitor KT5720 inhibited enhancement of phosphorylation of Ser845 and membrane insertion of GluA1 induced by M1 receptor activation. Furthermore, PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and protein kinase B (Akt) inhibitor IV blocked the effects of M1 receptors as well. Remarkably, the increase of the activity of PI3K-Akt signaling induced by M1 receptor activation could be abolished by cAMP-PKA inhibitors. Moreover, inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1, an important downstream effector of PI3K-Akt, by short-term application of rapamycin attenuated the effects of M1 receptors on GluA1. Furthermore, such effect was unrelated to possible protein synthesis promoted by mTOR. Taken together, these data demonstrate that M1 receptor activation induces membrane insertion of GluA1 via a signaling linking cAMP-PKA and PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathways but is irrelevant to protein synthesis.-Zhao, L.-X., Ge, Y.-H., Li, J.-B., Xiong, C.-H., Law, P.-Y., Xu, J.-R., Qiu, Y., Chen, H.-Z.

However, because of its essential nature, global inhibition of V-ATPase is not a therapeutic option. Instead, there is a need for targeted modulation of the enzyme's activity, a goal that requires a detailed understanding of V-ATPase's catalytic and regulatory mechanisms. vacuolar H+-ATPase ATPase sector of the V-ATPase membrane sector of the V-ATPase N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the a subunit C-terminal transmembrane domain of the a subunit C-terminal domain of the H subunit N-terminal domain of the H subunit maltose-binding protein biolayer interferometry concanamycin A membrane scaffold protein. V-ATPase is composed of two subcomplexes, a cytosolic ATPase called V1, and a membrane integral proton channel termed Vo (Fig. 1A). In yeast, the subunit compositions for the V1 and Vo are A3B3(C)DE3FG3H and ac8c′c″def, respectively (10Oot R.A. Couoh-Cardel S. Sharma S. Stam N.J. Wilkens S. Breaking up and making up: the secret life of the vacuolar H+-ATPase.Protein Sci. 2017; 26 (28247968): 896-90910.1002/pro.3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The A and B subunits of V1 are arranged in a hexamer (A3B3), with three catalytic sites at alternating AB interfaces. Located within the hexamer and extending from it in the direction of the membrane is subunit D that, together with F, provides the functional link between V1 and Vo. The Vo is constituted by subunit a that can be divided into cytosolic N-terminal and membrane-integral C-terminal domains (aNT and aCT), the c, c′ and c″ subunits (“proteolipids”) that form a ring (c-ring), and subunit d that connects the c-ring with V1 subunits D and F. V1 and Vo are held together by three heterodimers of subunits E and G (peripheral stalks EG1–3) that link the catalytic hexamer and the single copy C and H subunits to the membrane integral a subunit by binding to aNT. V-ATPase is a rotary motor enzyme and employs a catalytic mechanism that is shared with the F-, A-, and A/V-type ATPases (11Muench S.P. Trinick J. Harrison M.A. Structural divergence of the rotary ATPases.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2011; 44 (21426606): 311-35610.1017/S0033583510000338Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In V-ATPase, ATP hydrolysis–driven rotation of the DFdc-ring central rotor is coupled to proton translocation at the interface of aCT and the c-ring. During catalysis, the three peripheral stalks, in conjunction with C, H, and aNT, resist the rotary torque to keep the A3B3 hexamer static against aCT for efficient energy coupling. However, unlike F-, A-, and A/V-type enzymes, eukaryotic V-ATPase is regulated by a unique mechanism referred to as “reversible disassembly,” wherein V1 detaches from Vo in response to e.g. nutrient shortage (12Kane P.M.

Biochemical studies in yeast have shown that the single copy C and H subunits, which are unique to eukaryotic V-ATPase, play key roles in enzyme regulation. Both C and H are two-domain proteins, with C composed of “foot” (Cfoot) and “head” (Chead), and H of N- (HNT) and C-terminal (HCT) domains. H has a dual role because it is required for both coupling MgATPase to proton-pumping activities and for stabilizing the autoinhibited state of membrane detached V1; C functions to stabilize the V1–Vo interface in the holo enzyme but dissociates from the complex upon regulated disassembly. Recent structural studies have revealed that in assembled V1Vo, HCT is bound to aNT (23Zhao J. Benlekbir S. Rubinstein J.L.

Upon disassembly of V1 from Vo, HCT undergoes a 150° rotation to wedge an inhibitory loop between the B subunit of an open catalytic site and subunits DF of the central rotor (16Oot R.A. Kane P.M.

We hypothesized that the mismatch of rotational states observed in autoinhibited V1 and Vo, together with the large conformational changes of HCT and aNT that accompany enzyme dissociation, explain why V1 does not readily rebind free Vo under physiological conditions in vitro (10Oot R.A. Couoh-Cardel S. Sharma S. Stam N.J. Wilkens S.

We recently introduced biolayer interferometry (BLI) of purified V-ATPase in biotinylated and native lipid containing nanodiscs to analyze MgATP-dependent enzyme dissociation kinetics (29Sharma S. Wilkens S. Biolayer interferometry of lipid nanodisc-reconstituted yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase.Protein Sci. 2017; 26 (28241399): 1070-107910.1002/pro.3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here, we have expanded on this approach to probe the interaction of V1 and Vo. Vo sector was reconstituted into vacuolar lipid containing nanodiscs (VoND) and immobilized on BLI sensors to screen V1 mutants for their ability to bind Vo. In line with available literature (28Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Wild-type and mutant vacuolar membranes support pH-dependent reassembly of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase in vitro.J. Biol.

Couoh-Cardel S. Sharma S. Stam N.J. Wilkens S. Breaking up and making up: the secret life of the vacuolar H+-ATPase.Protein Sci. 2017; 26 (28247968): 896-90910.1002/pro.3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Previously, we generated a chimeric H subunit containing the yeast N-terminal and human C-terminal domains (Hchim) that does not inhibit free V1 because human HCT lacks an inhibitory loop that links an open catalytic site and the central rotor (16Oot R.A. Kane P.M. Berry E.A. Wilkens S. Crystal structure of yeast V1-ATPase in the autoinhibited state.EMBO J. 2016; 35 (27295975): 1694-170610.15252/embj.201593447Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and consequently, V1 containing Hchim is not restrained in any particular rotational state. We show that replacement of endogenous H in yeast V1 with Hchim (V1Hchim) (16Oot R.A. Kane P.M. Berry E.A. Wilkens S. Crystal structure of yeast V1-ATPase in the autoinhibited state.EMBO J. 2016; 35 (27295975): 1694-170610.15252/embj.201593447Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) permits binding to VoND, and formation of a coupled holo V-ATPase (V1HchimVoND) with catalytic properties similar to the ones of the recently characterized WT V1VoND (29Sharma S. Wilkens S. Biolayer interferometry of lipid nanodisc-reconstituted yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase.Protein Sci. 2017; 26 (28241399): 1070-107910.1002/pro.3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, V1HchimVoND was more resistant to ATP hydrolysis-induced disassembly compared with WT, highlighting the importance of HCT's conformational switch in driving V-ATPase disassembly. The in vitro data presented here thus provide key insight into the molecular steps that accompany V-ATPase regulation by reversible disassembly. Vo was extracted from yeast vacuoles using the “reconstitution before purification” strategy as described for V1Vo (29Sharma S. Wilkens S. Biolayer interferometry of lipid nanodisc-reconstituted yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase.Protein Sci. 2017; 26 (28241399): 1070-107910.1002/pro.3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C, panels i–iii). The resultant VoND complex consisted of Vo embedded in endogenous vacuolar lipid containing nanodiscs encircled by biotinylated membrane scaffold protein (MSP; Fig. 1C, panel iii). The purified complex was monodisperse and contained all Vo subunits plus MSP based on gel filtration and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, D and E). Examination of purified VoND using negative stain EM showed single particles of VoND with the typical size and appearance as described previously (26Stam N.J. Wilkens S.

Four different V1 mutants were tested for their ability to bind VoND and form coupled holo V-ATPase (Fig. 2A): WT V1 (containing subunits A3B3DE3FG3H), V1 purified from a yeast strain deleted for subunit H (V1ΔH), V1ΔH reconstituted with recombinantly expressed WT H (V1Hwt), and V1ΔH reconstituted with chimeric H (V1Hchim) (16Oot R.A.

Although WT V1 has no measurable MgATPase activity (Fig. 2B, dark green trace), V1ΔH had an initial specific activity of 15.7 α 1.7 units/mg, consistent with previous reports (16Oot R.A. Kane P.M. Berry E.A. Wilkens S.

Although MgATPase activity is measured in an ATP-regenerating system, the activity of V1ΔH decreases over time as MgADP gets trapped in a closed catalytic site, leading to the MgADP-inhibited state (15Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. The H subunit (Vma13p) of the yeast V-ATPase inhibits the ATPase activity of cytosolic V1 complexes.J. Biol.

Although V1Hwt has identical subunit composition to WT V1, V1Hwt distinguishes itself from WT by having only ∼0.4 instead of 1.3 mol/mol ADP in catalytic sites (16Oot R.A. Kane P.M. Berry E.A. Wilkens S. Crystal structure of yeast V1-ATPase in the autoinhibited state.EMBO J. 2016; 35 (27295975): 1694-170610.15252/embj.201593447Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the complex therefore exhibits an initial MgATPase activity of ∼4.95 α 0.55 units/mg before becoming MgADP-inhibited (Fig. 2, B and C, light green). V1ΔH reconstituted with Hchim to yield V1Hchim (Fig. 2, D–F) showed an initial MgATPase activity of 8.2 α 0.4 units/mg that, as for the other V1 mutants, declined over time because of MgADP inhibition (Fig. 2, B and C, pink). Experiments in yeast have shown that upon deletion of the gene encoding the C subunit, V1 does not stably/functionally associate with Vo. Moreover, biochemical analysis revealed that Chead binds isolated EG heterodimer with moderate affinity, whereas both Cfoot and EG bind aNT weakly (31Oot R.A. Wilkens S.

From these data we concluded that V1 and Vo are held together by multiple weak interactions, resulting in an overall high-avidity interface, and that destabilization of one of these interactions by a cellular response to starvation would result in enzyme dissociation (10Oot R.A. Couoh-Cardel S. Sharma S. Stam N.J. Wilkens S.

Moreover, when we analyzed binding of H (and HNT) to V1ΔH, we found that MgATP hydrolysis destabilized the V1–H interaction, an effect likely caused by the cyclic conformational changes at the catalytic AB interfaces to which the EG heterodimers are bound (30Sharma S.

We therefore wished to determine whether C binding to EG on V1 is also enhanced compared with isolated EG, and if so, (i) what the affinity of the interaction is, and (ii) whether the interaction is also destabilized during ATP hydrolysis.

https://openalex.org/W2915722416,"Defensins are an extensive family of host defense peptides found ubiquitously across plant and animal species. In addition to protecting against infection by pathogenic microorganisms, some defensins are selectively cytotoxic toward tumor cells. As such, defensins have attracted interest as potential antimicrobial and anticancer therapeutics. The mechanism of defensin action against microbes and tumor cells appears to be conserved and involves the targeting and disruption of cellular membranes. This has been best defined for plant defensins, which upon binding specific phospholipids, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidic acid, form defensin-lipid oligomeric complexes that destabilize membranes, leading to cell lysis. In this study, to further define the anticancer and therapeutic properties of plant defensins, we have characterized a novel plant defensin, Nicotiana occidentalis defensin 173 (NoD173), from N. occidentalis. NoD173 at low micromolar concentrations selectively killed a panel of tumor cell lines over normal primary cells. To improve the anticancer activity of NoD173, we explored increasing cationicity by mutation, with NoD173 with the substitution of Q22 with lysine [NoD173(Q22K)], increasing the antitumor cell activity by 2-fold. NoD173 and the NoD173(Q22K) mutant exhibited only low levels of hemolytic activity, and both maintained activity against tumor cells in serum. The ability of NoD173 to inhibit solid tumor growth in vivo was tested in a mouse B16-F1 model, whereby injection of NoD173 into established subcutaneous tumors significantly inhibited tumor growth. Finally, we showed that NoD173 specifically targets PIP2 and determined by X-ray crystallography that a high-resolution structure of NoD173, which forms a conserved family-defining cysteine-stabilized-αβ motif with a dimeric lipid-binding conformation, configured into an arch-shaped oligomer of 4 dimers. These data provide insights into the mechanism of how defensins target membranes to kill tumor cells and provide proof of concept that defensins are able to inhibit tumor growth in vivo.-Lay, F.

https://openalex.org/W2917736585,"Despite public health measures and health-promotion efforts, the decline in tuberculosis (TB) morbidity in Japan has been slow, with a higher TB incidence rate relative to those observed in most developed countries. Because health behavior depends on multiple factors and is formulated within a social context, a theory-driven model would be necessary to increase TB prevention behavior. Based upon the Health Belief Model, this study examined the effects of health beliefs, personality traits, and social factors on TB prevention behavior among Japanese adults. A cross-sectional survey was carried out with a nationally representative sample (N = 911; 50.9% women; mean age 49.5, SD = 14.1). Path analyses gave empirical support for the hypothesized model, suggesting that TB prevention behaviors are influenced by not only perceived susceptibility to the illness but also social factors such as cues to action and one’s concern to benefit others. The findings have implications for research examining health communication tailored to individual differences in personality and interpersonal concern."
https://openalex.org/W2917054194,"Background/Purpose Few studies have examined the risk factors for gallbladder (GB) disease in young adults. This study aimed to evaluate risk factors for GB disease in young adults based on big data in Korea. Methods All participants underwent routine checkup at the Korea Medical Institute from June 2014 to May 2015. After excluding 677 individuals with missing information in records, 724,114 individuals (435,635 men, 288,479 women) were finally included. The definition of abnormal GB finding included stones, sludge, polyps, and adenomyomatosis detected using ultrasonography. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.2. Results Overall, 27,130 (17.5%) individuals were diagnosed as having abnormal GB finding in the young age group (N = 154,463, aged 20–39 years). In men, significant differences in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and cholesterol levels were observed between the abnormal GB finding group and normal GB group (p < 0.05). In women, a significant difference in smoking history was noted between the abnormal GB finding group and normal GB group (p < 0.05). The prevalence rate of GB stones was 1.9% (27,979/154,463) in the young age group. High body mass index (BMI), large thigh circumference, and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level in women and low HDL level in men were independent risk factors for the presence of GB stones (p < 0.05). Conclusion In this study, obesity-related factors (BMI, waist size, thigh circumference, and cholesterol, LDL, and HDL levels) correlated with GB disease in the young generation of Korea."
https://openalex.org/W2916941690,"Endothelial surface layer (glycocalyx) is the major physiological regulator of tumor cell adhesion to endothelium. Cancer cells express vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which increases the permeability of a microvessel wall by degrading glycocalyx. Endothelial cells lining large arteries have also been reported, in vitro and in vivo, to mediate VEGF expression significantly under exposure to high wall shear stress (WSS) > 0.6 Pa. The objective of the present study is to explore whether local hemodynamic conditions in the vicinity of a migrating deformable cancer cell can influence the function of endothelial cells to express VEGF within the microvasculature. A three-dimensional model of deformable cancer cells (DCCs) migrating within a capillary is developed by applying a massively parallel hemodynamics application to simulate the fluid-structure interaction between the DCC and fluid surrounding the DCC. We study how dynamic interactions between the DCC and its local microenvironment affect WSS exposed on endothelium, under physiological conditions of capillaries with different diameters and flow conditions. Moreover, we quantify the area of endothelium affected by the DCC. Our results show that the DCC alters local hemodynamics in its vicinity up to an area as large as 40 times the cancer cell lateral surface. In this area, endothelium experiences high WSS values in the range of 0.6–12 Pa. Endothelial cells exposed to this range of WSS have been reported to express VEGF. Furthermore, we demonstrate that stiffer cancer cells expose higher WSS on the endothelium. A strong impact of cell stiffness on its local microenvironment is observed in capillaries with diameters <16 μm. WSS-induced-VEGF by endothelium represents an important potential mechanism for cancer cell adhesion and metastasis in the microvasculature. This work serves as an important first step in understanding the mechanisms driving VEGF-expression by endothelium and identifying the underlying mechanisms of glycocalyx degradation by endothelium in microvasculature. The identification of angiogenesis factors involved in early stages of cancer cell-endothelium interactions and understanding their regulation will help, first to develop anti-angiogenic strategies applied to diagnostic studies and therapeutic interventions, second to predict accurately where different cancer cell types most likely adhere in microvasculature, and third to establish accurate criteria predisposing the cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2917266953,"Background In this paper we present a model of parameters to aesthetically characterize films using a multi-disciplinary approach: by combining film theory, visual low-level video descriptors (modeled in order to supply aesthetic information) and classification techniques using machine and deep learning. Methods Four different tests have been developed, each for a different application, proving the model's usefulness. These applications are: aesthetic style clustering, prediction of production year, genre detection and influence on film popularity. Results The results are compared against high-level information to determine the accuracy of the model to classify films without knowing such information previously. The main difference with other film characterization approaches is that we are able to isolate the influence of high-level descriptors to really understand the relevance of low-level features and, accordingly propose a useful set of low-level visual descriptors for that purpose. This model has been tested with a representative number of films to prove that it can be used for different applications."
https://openalex.org/W2917837554,"Despite their potential importance with regard to infectious and chronic diseases among tobacco users, microbial constituents of tobacco products lack characterization. Specifically, to our knowledge, there are no data describing the bacterial diversity of little cigars or cigarillos. To address this knowledge gap, we tested four brands of little cigars and cigarillos. Tobacco and wrapper subsamples (n = 132) were separately subjected to DNA extraction, followed by PCR amplification of the V3V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene, and sequencing using Illumina HiSeq. Sequences were analyzed using QIIME and Phyloseq implemented in R. We identified 2,681 operational taxonomic units across all products. Significant differences in alpha and beta diversity were observed between Swisher Sweets and Cheyenne products. Alpha and beta diversity was also significantly different between tobacco and wrapper subsamples within the same product. Beta diversity analyses of only tobacco samples identified no significant differences in the bacterial microbiota of different lots of the same products; however, the microbiota in the wrapper differed significantly across lots for all brands. Overall, Firmicutes were found to dominate in the wrapper, whereas Proteobacteria were most abundant in the tobacco. At the genus level, Bacillus and Lactobacillus dominated in the wrappers, and Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas dominated in the tobacco. Our findings suggest that the bacterial microbiota of little cigars and cigarillos is diverse and differs significantly between the tobacco and the wrapper, and across brands. Future work is necessary to evaluate the potential public health implications of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2917545491,"We previously reported on the elevated intravitreal activities of tryptase and chymase in association with idiopathic epiretinal membrane (ERM) and idiopathic macular hole (MH). In this present study, we investigated the potential intraocular production of these serine proteases, and measured and compared tryptase and chymase activities in the vitreous body and serum in ERM, MH, proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) patients. In addition, nuclear staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and mast-cell staining with toluidine blue were performed on samples of the vitreous core and bursa premacularis (BPM) of MH. We also performed immunostaining on the above two regions of vitreous samples for MH with anti-tryptase antibody, anti-chymase antibody, anti-podoplanin antibody, anti-lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1) antibody, and anti-fibroblast antibody. Moreover, we performed immunostaining with anti-tryptase antibody and anti-chymase antibody on ERMs collected intraoperatively. Tryptase activity in the vitreous body was significantly higher in ERM and MH than in PDR. However, no significant differences were observed in the tryptase activity in the serum among these four diseases. Chymase activity in the vitreous body was significantly higher in MH than in the other three diseases, yet chymase activity in the serum was below detection limit in any of the diseases. Nuclear staining with H&E revealed an abundance of nuclei in the BPM region, but few in the surrounding area. Mast-cell staining with toluidine blue revealed that the BPM showed metachromatic staining. In immunostaining with anti-fibroblasts antibody, anti-tryptase antibody, anti-chymase antibody, anti-podoplanin antibody, and anti-LYVE-1 antibody, the BPM stained more strongly than the vitreous core. Tryptase and chymase-positive cells were also observed in ERM. These findings revealed that the presence of mast cells in the BPM potentially represent the source of these serine proteases. Moreover, the BPM, as a lymphatic tissue, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of macular disease."

In the context of image sets, color photographs are particularly suited to this purpose as they reduce the difficulty of visual decoding processes that may emerge with traditional image sets of line drawings. This is especially so in clinical populations. In this study we provide Italian norms for a set of 357 high quality image-items belonging to 23 semantic subcategories from the Moreno-Martínez and Montoro database. Data from several variables affecting image processing were collected from a sample of 255 Italian-speaking participants: age of acquisition, familiarity, lexical frequency, manipulability, name agreement, typicality and visual complexity. Lexical frequency data were derived from the CoLFIS corpus. Furthermore, we collected data on image oral naming latencies to explore how the variance in these latencies could be explained by these critical variables. Multiple regression analyses on the naming latencies show classical psycholinguistic phenomena, such as the effects of age of acquisition and name agreement. In addition, manipulability was also a significant predictor. The described Italian normative data and naming latencies are available for download as supplementary material."

To investigate CASPR1′s physiological role in BMECs, here we used CASPR1 as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify CASPR1-interacting proteins and identified the β3 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase (ATP1B3) as a CASPR1-binding protein. Using recombinant and purified CASPR1, RNAi, GST-pulldown, immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and Na+/K+-ATPase activity assays, we found that ATP1B3′s core proteins, but not its glycosylated forms, interact with CASPR1, which was primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum of BMECs. CASPR1 knockdown reduced ATP1B3 glycosylation and prevented its plasma membrane localization, phenotypes that were reversed by expression of full-length CASPR1. We also found that the CASPR1 knockdown reduces the plasma membrane distribution of the α1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase, which is the major component assembled with ATP1B3 in the complete Na+/K+-ATPase complex. The binding of CASPR1 with ATP1B3, but not the α1 subunit, indicated that CASPR1 binds with ATP1B3 to facilitate the assembly of Na+/K+-ATPase. Furthermore, the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase was reduced in CASPR1-silenced BMECs. Interestingly, shRNA-mediated CASPR1 silencing reduced glutamate efflux through the BMECs. These results demonstrate that CASPR1 binds with ATP1B3 and thereby contributes to the regulation of Na+/K+-ATPase maturation and trafficking to the plasma membrane in BMECs.

https://openalex.org/W2917784704,"Tissue segmentation and classification in MRI is a challenging task due to a lack of signal intensity standardization. MRI signal is dependent on the acquisition protocol, the coil profile, the scanner type, etc. While we can compute quantitative physical tissue properties independent of the hardware and the sequence parameters, it is still difficult to leverage these physical properties to segment and classify pelvic tissues. The proposed method integrates quantitative MRI values (T1 and T2 relaxation times and pure synthetic weighted images) and machine learning (Support Vector Machine (SVM)) to segment and classify tissues in the pelvic region, i.e.: fat, muscle, prostate, bone marrow, bladder, and air. Twenty-two men with a mean age of 30±14 years were included in this prospective study. The images were acquired with a 3 Tesla MRI scanner. An inversion recovery-prepared turbo spin echo sequence was used to obtain T1-weighted images at different inversion times with a TR of 14000 ms. A 32-echo spin echo sequence was used to obtain the T2-weighted images at different echo times with a TR of 5000 ms. T1 and T2 relaxation times, synthetic T1- and T2-weighted images and anatomical probabilistic maps were calculated and used as input features of a SVM for segmenting and classifying tissues within the pelvic region. The mean SVM classification accuracy across subjects was calculated for the different tissues: prostate (94.2%), fat (96.9%), muscle (95.8%), bone marrow (91%) and bladder (82.1%) indicating an excellent classification performance. However, the segmentation and classification for air (within the rectum) may not always be successful (mean SVM accuracy 47.5%) due to the lack of air data in the training and testing sets. Our findings suggest that SVM can reliably segment and classify tissues in the pelvic region."

Methods Data for 459 consecutive patients (mean age 60.8 years; 88.5% male) with STEMI, treated in 16 public hospitals (representing 72.2% of public hospitals in Tunisia treating STEMI patients), were collected prospectively.The most common risk factors were smoking (63.6%), hypertension (39.7%), diabetes (32%) and dyslipidaemia (18.2%). Results Among the 459 patients, 61.8% received reperfusion therapy: 30% with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) and 31.8% with intravenous fibrinolysis (IF) (28.6% with pre-hospital thrombolysis). The median time from symptom onset to thrombolysis was 185 min and to PPCI was 358 min. In-hospital mortality was 5.3%. Compared with those managed at regional hospitals, patients managed at interventional university hospitals (n = 357) were more likely to receive reperfusion therapy (52.9% vs. 34.1%; p<0.001), with less IF (28.6% vs. 43.1%; p = 0.002) but more PPCI (37.8% vs. 3.9%; p<0.0001). However, in-hospital mortality in the two types of hospitals was similar (5.3% vs. 5.1%; p = 0.866). Conclusions Data from the FAST-MI Tunisia registry show that a pharmaco-invasive strategy of management for STEMI should be promoted in non-interventional regional hospitals."

To reveal the evolutionary relationship of MC gene family in Rosaceae genomes, we identified 8, 7, 8, 12, 12, and 23 MC genes in the genomes of Fragaria vesca, Prunus mume, Prunus persica, Pyrus communis, Pyrus bretschneideri and Malus domestica, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the MC genes could be grouped into three clades: Type I*, Type I and Type II, which was supported by gene structure and conserved motif analysis. Microsynteny analysis revealed that MC genes present in the corresponding syntenic blocks of P. communis, P. bretschneideri and M. domestica, and further suggested that large-scale duplication events play an important role in the expansion of MC gene family members in these three genomes than other Rosaceae plants (F. vesca, P. mume and P. persica). RNA-seq data showed the specific expression patterns of PbMC genes in response to drought stress. The expression analysis of MC genes demonstrated that PbMC01 and PbMC03 were able to be detected in all four pear pollen tubes and seven fruit development stages. The current study highlighted the evolutionary relationship and duplication of the MC gene family in these six Rosaceae genomes and provided appropriate candidate genes for further studies in P. bretschneideri."

Using computational approaches to identify transcription factor binding motifs in a freshwater sponge genome, we located putative PaxB binding sites near a Secreted Frizzled Related Protein (SFRP) gene in Ephydatia muelleri. EmSFRP is expressed throughout development, but with highest levels in juvenile sponges. In situ hybridization and antibody staining show EmSFRP expression throughout the pinacoderm and choanoderm in a subpopulation of amoeboid cells that may be differentiating archeocytes. Knockdown of EmSFRP leads to ectopic oscula formation during development, suggesting that EmSFRP acts as an antagonist of Wnt signaling in E. muelleri. Our findings support a hypothesis that regulation of the Wnt pathway by the Pax/Six network as well as the role of Wnt signaling in body plan morphogenesis was established before sponges diverged from the rest of the metazoans."

Perceptions of the comprehensibility and readability of medication labels in relation to sociodemographic characteristics were evaluated by Poisson regression models with robust variance. Labeling preferences were assessed through questions addressing possible improvements and through the use of digitally simulated packages.Of 6,255 medication users interviewed, more than half found it difficult or very difficult to read (50.8%) and/or understand (52.0%) medication labels. Difficulties were more pronounced for participants aged 40 years or older, with lower levels of education, and non-whites. Increasing the font size (93.7%), describing the indications for use (95.9%) and contraindications (95.6%) on the label, and highlighting the expiration date (96.3%) were the most widely accepted improvements. In the evaluation of simulated packages, users preferred factors that improved readability, such as increased font size, use of graphic elements and color to highlight the concentration of the active ingredient, and contrast between the font color and background. The new simulated package design, with increased font size, color to highlight the concentration and contrast between the font color and background, was preferred over the standard design by 77.0% of participants.Based on users' perceptions, increased font size and use of graphic elements and color to emphasize critical information, such as expiration date and concentration, are factors that contribute to making medication labels clearer to users.

We also applied the model to assess the scale-up efforts through the end of September 2017 and project their impact on HIV incidence through 2030. The DMPPT 2 is a compartmental Excel-based model that analyzes the effects of age at circumcision on program impact and cost-effectiveness. The model tracks changes in age-specific MC coverage due to VMMC program circumcisions. Baseline MC prevalence was based on data from the 2011 Demographic and Health Survey. The DMPPT 2 was populated with HIV incidence projections from Spectrum/Goals under an assumption that Mozambique would reach its national targets for HIV treatment and prevention by 2022.We estimate the VMMC program increased MC coverage among males ages 10 to 49 from 27 percent in 2009 to 48 percent by end of September 2017. Coverage increased primarily in males ages 10 to 29. VMMCs conducted in the national program through the end of September 2017 are projected to avert 67,076 HIV infections from 2010 to 2030. Scaling up circumcisions in males ages 20 to 29 will have the most immediate impact on HIV incidence, while the greatest impact over a 15-year period is obtained by circumcising males ages 15 to 24 in the majority of priority provinces. Circumcising 80 percent of males ages 10 to 29 can achieve 77 percent of the impact through 2030 compared with circumcising 80 percent of males ages 10 to 49.The VMMC program in Mozambique has made great strides in increasing MC coverage, particularly for males ages 10 to 29.

Sensitive and accurate assays are vital for efficient prevention of the spread of HLB-associated “Candidatus Liberibacter spp”. “Candidatus Liberibacter spp” that infect Citrus includes “Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus” (Las), “Candidatus Liberibacter africanus” (Laf) and “Candidatus Liberibacter americanus” (Lam). Of them, Las is the most widespread species. In this study, a set of nested PCR primer pairs were screened to diagnose Las, and the nested PCR method greatly enhanced the sensitivity to detect Las up to 10 times and 100 times compared to qPCR and conventional PCR, respectively. Totally, 1112 samples from 5 different citrus cultivars in 39 different counties and cities were assayed by nested PCR. The results show that 384 samples were HLB-infected; the highest positive detection rate was 79.7% from the lopsided fruit samples, and the lowest positive detection rate was 16.3% from the apical dieback samples. The results indicate that the designed nested PCR primer pairs can detect Las from different symptomatic tissues, different citrus cultivars and different geographic regions. The set of nested PCR primers designed in the present study will provide a very useful supplementation to the current approaches for Las detection."

Yet, the resulting information is frequently scattered in many scientific articles, in many databases and specialized web servers. To provide a more compendious view of erythrocytes and of their protein content, we developed a dedicated database called RESPIRE that aims at gathering a comprehensive and coherent ensemble of information and data about proteins in RBC. This cell-driven database lists proteins found in erythrocytes. For a given protein entry, initial data are processed from external portals and enriched by using state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods. As structural information is extremely useful to understand protein function and predict the impact of mutations, a strong effort has been put on the prediction of protein structures with a special treatment for membrane proteins. Browsing the database is available through text search for reference gene names or protein identifiers, through pre-defined queries or via hyperlinks. The RESPIRE database provides valuable information and unique annotations that should be useful to a wide audience of biologists, clinicians and structural biologists.

https://openalex.org/W2953080538,"We have previously reported the inhibition of bacterial topoisomerase I activity by a fluoroquinophenoxazine compound (FP-11g) with a 6-bipiperidinyl lipophilic side chain that exhibited promising antituberculosis activity (MIC = 2.5 μM against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, SI = 9.8). Here, we found that the compound is bactericidal towards Mycobacterium smegmatis, resulting in greater than 5 Log10 reduction in colony-forming units [cfu]/mL following a 10 h incubation at 1.25 μM (4X MIC) concentration. Growth inhibition (MIC = 50 μM) and reduction in cfu could also be observed against a clinical isolate of Mycobacterium abscessus. Stepwise isolation of resistant mutants of M. smegmatis was conducted to explore the mechanism of resistance. Mutations in the resistant isolates were identified by direct comparison of whole-genome sequencing data from mutant and wild-type isolates. These include mutations in genes likely to affect the entry and retention of the compound. FP-11g inhibits Mtb topoisomerase I and Mtb gyrase with IC50 of 0.24 and 27 μM, respectively. Biophysical analysis showed that FP-11g binds DNA as an intercalator but the IC50 for inhibition of Mtb topoisomerase I activity is >10 fold lower than the compound concentrations required for producing negatively supercoiled DNA during ligation of nicked circular DNA. Thus, the DNA-binding property of FP-11g may contribute to its antimycobacterial mechanism, but that alone cannot account for the observed inhibition of Mtb topoisomerase I."
https://openalex.org/W2915792463,"Objective This pilot study assessed the efficacy of a knee guard device, which used magnetophoresis to transdermally deliver Glucosamine, Chondroitin and Hyaluronic Acid in a cohort of individuals with prior knee injury. The aim was to determine if the change in physical function and pain with the knee guard device was equivalent to the change produced by an established topical NSAID formulation containing diclofenac sodium 1%. Methods A randomized, controlled, equivalence trial evaluated outcomes following treatment with the knee guard device or NSAID formulation. The study recruited 114 male participants (aged 40–55 years). Participants were randomly allocated to wear the knee guard device or to use a NSAID gel daily for two weeks. The primary outcomes were the knee injury osteoarthritis function score (KOOS-F) and an aggregated function score (AFS). The lower extremity functional scale (LEFS), pain numerical rating scale (PNRS), global rating of change (GROC) and other KOOS scores were also evaluated. Results Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that there were no significant differences between the interventions for changes in the primary outcomes of AFS and KOOS_F. The 95% confidence interval (-2.89 to 5.15) of the estimated treatment difference for KOOS-F was within the lower (-5.61) and upper (5.61) bounds of the 7% equivalence margin for that measure, The mean value for the AFS was within, but the 95% CI (-3.11 to 7.37) exceeded the 7% equivalence margin (-2.97 to 2.97) for that measure. There was a significant difference in PNRS, which favored the knee guard device. Conclusion The knee guard device demonstrated equivalence for the KOOS-F measure but not the AFS measure of function over the two week trial period when compared to a widely available NSAID gel that has been shown to be superior to placebo. The knee guard produced a greater reduction in pain report (p = 0.002) than the NSAID gel. Users of the knee guard device experienced more skin irritation than participants using the NSAID gel. Further research is required to fully evaluate the therapeutic potential of this innovative treatment approach."
https://openalex.org/W2915810322,"Habitat selection and extension of the area used by a given species may vary during different phases of its life and are often determined by the distribution and availability of resources throughout the landscape, such as food, breeding sites, and shelters. In this study, we assessed the influence of body size on the areas used by 21 individuals of the yellow-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis denticulatus) from January to June 2017 in a dense rain forest area in Central Amazonia. We also investigated whether individuals selected different ranges of terrain slope, elevation, areas with high food availability, or areas with treefall gaps that could be used for shelter or thermoregulation. We monitored tortoise movements using thread-bobbins, and sampled terrain characteristics, availability of potential food resources and forest gaps along the routes used by the tortoises. We also measured the same variables in plots distributed systematically throughout the study area to evaluate resource availability. Tortoises used an average area of 1.56 ha (SD = 1.51, min = 0.03, max = 6.44). The size of the area used was positively associated with the individual body size, but did not vary between sexes. Small individuals selected higher and flatter areas where the availability of fallen flowers was higher, whereas the area used by larger individuals did not differ from the natural availability of topographic traits and food in the region. Although tortoises did not select areas according to availability of tree-fall gaps, most larger tortoises were found sheltered under fallen trees (85%). Conversely, small individuals were mainly found hidden under litter (66%). Body size determined the patterns of landscape use by tortoises; larger individuals were mainly generalists, but small individuals occupied high and flat areas. The yellow-footed tortoise is endangered by hunting, illegal collection for the pet trade, habitat destruction and effects of climate change. Size-related differences in habitat selection should be taken into account in species-distribution models for the identification of suitable areas for reintroduction and the development of management plans in protected areas."
https://openalex.org/W2915817777,"Systems biology faces two key challenges when dealing with large amounts of disparate data produced by different experiments: the integration of results across different experiments, and the extraction of meaningful information from the data produced by these experiments. An ongoing challenge is to provide better tools that can mine data patterns that could not have been discovered through simple visualization. Such mining capabilities also need to be coupled with intuitive visualization to portray those findings. We introduce a software toolbox entitled BioNetApp to mine these patterns and visualize them across all experiments.BioNetApp is an interactive visual data mining software for analyzing high-volume molecular expression data obtained from multiple 'omics experiments. By integrating visualization, statistical methods, and data mining techniques, BioNetApp can perform interactive correlative and comparative analysis along time-course studies of molecular expression data. Correlation analysis provides several visualization features such as Kamada-Kawai, Fruchterman-Reingold Spring embedding network layouts, in addition to single circle, multiple circle and heatmap layouts, whereas comparative analysis presents expression-data distributions across samples, groups, and time points with boxplot display, outlier detection, and data curve fitting. BioNetApp also provides data clustering based on molecular concentrations using Self Organizing Maps (SOM), K-Means, K-Medoids, and Farthest First algorithms.BioNetApp has been utilized in a metabolomics study to investigate the metabolite abundance changes in alcohol induced fatty liver, where pair-wise analyses of metabolome concentration revealed correlation networks and interesting patterns in the metabolomics dataset. This study case demonstrates the effectiveness of the BioNetApp software as an interactive visual analysis tool for molecular expression data in systems biology. The BioNetApp software is freely available under GNU GPL license and can be downloaded (including the case-study data and user-manual) at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2563129."
https://openalex.org/W2917694196,"Objectives Direct antiviral agents (DAA) has dramatically improved the therapy outcome of hepatitis C-virus (HCV) infection, both on the waiting-list and post liver transplantation (LT). DAA are generally well-tolerated in patients with mild to moderate liver and kidney failure, but some DAAs are contraindicated in patients with severe dysfunction of these organs. Today there are few studies of peri-LT DAA use and treatment is commonly discontinued at the time of LT. We report here our experience of DAA therapy given continuously in the perioperative LT period in a real-life setting in Sweden. Material In total 10 patients with HCV-cirrhosis, with or without hepatocellular carcinoma, and a median age of 60.5 years (range, 52–65) were treated with DAAs on the waiting list for LT, and continued in the early postoperative period without any interruption, on the basis of not having reached a full treatment course at the time of LT. Sofosbuvir and a NS5A inhibitor with or without ribavirin, or sofosbuvir and ribavirin only, were given. The distribution of genotypes was genotype 1 and 3, in 4 and 6 patients, respectively. Six of the 10 patients had previously been treated with IFN-based therapy. Results There were no adverse events leading to premature DAA discontinuation. All recipients achieved a sustained viral response 12 weeks after end-of-treatment (SVR12). At the time of LT the median MELD-score was 16.5 (range 7–21), CTP-score 9.0 (range 5–10), creatinine 82.5 μmol/L (range 56–135, reference 60–105), bilirubin 33 μmol/L (range 16–79, reference 5–25) and PK-INR 1.5 (range 1.1–1.8). The median duration of DAA therapy was 60 days (range 18–132) pre-LT, 54 days post-LT (range 8–111 days) and in total 15.5 weeks (range 12–30 weeks). Conclusion Interferon-free DAA therapy of HCV-infection given in the immediate pre- and post-operative LT period is safe, well-tolerated and yields high SVR rates."
https://openalex.org/W2917975356,"Cardiac diseases with elevated central venous pressure have higher frequency of jugular venous reflux (JVR), which is associated with decreased cerebral blood flow and white matter hyperintensities. Whether patients with severe mitral-regurgitation (SMR) have poorer cognitive functions and whether JVR is involved were determined in this pilot study. Patients with SMR and age/sex-matched controls were prospectively recruited. Neuropsychological tests such as global cognitive (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE), verbal memory, executive, and visuospatial domains were performed. Cardiac parameters by cardiac catheterisation and echocardiography, and the frequency of JVR by colour-coded duplex ultrasonography were obtained. Forty patients with SMR and 40 controls (71.1±12.2, 38–89 years; 75% men) were included. Compared with the controls, patients with SMR had lower scores in all neuropsychological tests but only MMSE and visuospatial test scores were statistically significant after adjusting for age, sex, and educational level. We further adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors; the significance remained in the visuospatial test but diminished in MMSE. Multivariate linear regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, and educational level showed that JVR combined with high right-atrial-pressure (RAP > 50th-percentile, 12 mmHg) was significantly associated with poorer performances in both MMSE [right JVR: B coefficient(95% confidence interval,p) = -2.83(-5.46–0.20, 0.036); left JVR: -2.77(-5.52–0.02, 0.048)] and visuospatial test [right JVR: -4.52(-8.89–0.16, 0.043); left JVR: -4.56(-8.81–0.30, 0.037)], with significances that remained after further adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. Our pilot results suggest that retrogradely-transmitted venous pressure might be involved in the mechanisms mediating the relationship between cardiac diseases and brain functions."
https://openalex.org/W2978329318,"The transient receptor potential Ankyrin-1 (TRPA1) ion channel is modulated by myriad noxious stimuli that interact with multiple regions of the channel, including cysteine-reactive natural extracts from onion and garlic which modify residues in the cytoplasmic domains. The way in which TRPA1 cytoplasmic domain modification is coupled to opening of the ion-conducting pore has yet to be elucidated. The cryo-EM structure of TRPA1 revealed a tetrameric C-terminal coiled-coil surrounded by N-terminal ankyrin repeat domains (ARDs), an architecture shared with the canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) ion channel family. Similarly, structures of the TRP melastatin (TRPM) ion channel family also showed a C-terminal coiled-coil surrounded by N-terminal cytoplasmic domains. This conserved architecture may indicate a common gating mechanism by which modification of cytoplasmic domains can transduce conformational changes to open the ion-conducting pore. We developed an in vitro system in which N-terminal ARDs and C-terminal coiled-coil domains can be expressed in bacteria and maintain the ability to interact. We tested three gating regulators: temperature; the polyphosphate compound IP6; and the covalent modifier allyl isothiocyanate to determine whether they alter N- and C-terminal interactions. We found that none of the modifiers tested abolished ARD-coiled-coil interactions, though there was a significant reduction at 37˚C. We found that coiled-coils tetramerize in a concentration dependent manner, with monomers and trimers observed at lower concentrations. Our system provides a method for examining the mechanism of oligomerization of TRPA1 cytoplasmic domains as well as a system to study the transmission of conformational changes resulting from covalent modification."
https://openalex.org/W2916194472,"The benefits of using longer than self-selected poles have been shown in double poling, but these potential benefits have not been examined in the gear 3 ski skating sub-technique (G3), during which the poling movement is very similar to double poling. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of longer than self-selected poles on physiological and perceptual responses in the G3 sub-technique. Ten cross-country skiers and biathletes (VO2max 72.4 ± 3.0 ml∙min-1∙kg-1, age 20.1 ± 2.8 years, height 1.81 ± 0.03 m and weight 73.1 ± 4.6 kg) completed two tests, each with three different submaximal intensities, during roller skiing using the G3 technique. The first test was carried out at a fixed speed (10 km∙h-1) and the skiers performed two intervals of 5 min at 7, 9 and 11% inclination on a roller ski treadmill with self-selected poles (SSP) and 7.5 cm longer poles (LP) at each step. The second test had a fixed inclination of 4% and speeds of 14, 17 and 20 km∙h-1, also performed with SSP and LP at each step. At fixed speed, the oxygen uptake was 2.7% lower (P = 0.005) and the gross efficiency (GE) 2.1% higher (P = 0.01) with LP than with SSP at the steepest inclination of 11%. At fixed inclination, the oxygen uptake was 2.1% lower (P = 0.01) and the GE was 4.1% higher (P = 0.03) with LP than with SSP at the highest speed of 20 km∙h-1. At 14 km∙h-1, the oxygen uptake was 3.0% lower (P = 0.05) and GE was 3.8% higher (P = 0.03) with LP than with SSP. Our novel findings show that longer poles in the G3 technique may enhance the efficiency of skiing."
https://openalex.org/W2915609193,"LPS has been shown to elicit neuroinflammation associated with the up-regulation of the eicosanoid pathway in animal models; however, the regulatory mechanisms of TLR4 in brain neuroinflammatory conditions remain elusive. β-Arrestins are key regulators of the GPCR signaling pathway and are involved in the leukotriene B4-induced leukocyte migration to initiate inflammatory response. However, the roles of β-arrestins in eicosanoid regulation and related diseases are not clear. To address this issue, we conducted a study to investigate the effect of TLR4 on the eicosanoid pathway in ischemic stroke brain and to explore the underlying molecular regulation mechanism. Cerebral ischemia was produced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, followed by reperfusion for 24 h. We demonstrated that knockout of TLR4 improves ischemic stroke brain associated with eicosanoid down-regulation. Interestingly, genetic disruption of β-arrestin-2 failed to decrease neuroinflammation in the damaged brain of TLR4-/- mice, which indicates the requirement of β-arrestin-2 for TLR4 knockdown protection. Further study showed that the negative regulation of phosphorylated (phospho-)ERK1/2 and phospho-cytosolic phospholipase A2 α (cPLA2α) by TLR4 deficiency was eliminated by genetic disruption of β-arrestin-2. In addition, β-arrestin-2 deficiency reversed the reduction of colocalization of phospho-ERK1/2 with phospho-cPLA2α in TLR4-/- mice following ischemic stroke. Mechanistic studies indicated that β-arrestin-2 specifically colocalized and associated with ERK1/2 to prevent ERK1/2-dependent cPLA2α activation following ischemic injury, and β-arrestin-2 deficiency blocked the negative regulation of phospho-ERK1/2, revived the association of phospho-ERK1/2 with phospho-cPLA2α, and subsequently increased the prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane A2 production remarkably. Our findings may provide novel insights that β-arrestin-2 is responsible for ischemic brain improvement in TLR4-/- mice via negative regulation of eicosanoid production.-Xiang, Y., Wei, X., Du, P., Zhao, H., Liu, A., Chen, Y. β-Arrestin-2-ERK1/2 cPLA2α axis mediates TLR4 signaling to influence eicosanoid induction in ischemic brain."
https://openalex.org/W2916846277,"This paper presents a method to reduce a set of n 2D points to a smaller set of s 2D points with the property that the convex hull on the smaller set is the same as the convex hull of the original bigger set. The paper shows, experimentally, that such reduction accelerates computations; the time it takes to reduce from n down to s points plus the time of computing the convex hull on the s points is less than the time to compute the convex hull on the original set of n points. The method accepts 2D points expressed as real numbers and thus extends our previous method that required points as integers. The method achieves a percentage of reduction of points of over 90% in a collections of four datasets. This amount of reduction provides speedup factors of at least two for various common convex hull algorithms. Theoretically, the reduction method executes in time within O(n) and thus is suitable for preprocessing 2D data before computing the convex hull by any known algorithm."

https://openalex.org/W2918044671,"To determine whether optical spectral transmission (OST) can be used to assess synovitis in hand and wrist joints of patients with hand osteoarthritis (OA).Hand and wrist joints of 47 primary hand OA patients with at least one clinically inflamed hand or wrist joint were assessed for synovitis by OST and ultrasound (US). Associations between standardized OST and US synovitis were studied in linear mixed effects models, across all joint types together and individually for wrist, proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, and were adjusted for OA features that showed associations with US synovitis. Diagnostic performance was determined using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves analysis, with US as reference standard.Altogether, 6.7% of joints showed US synovitis. Statistically significant associations between OST scores and US synovitis were found for all joints combined (Δ0.37SD, p<0.001) and PIP joints (Δ0.81SD, p<0.001), but not for DIP (Δ0.14SD, p = 0.484) or wrist joints (Δ0.37SD, p = 0.178). All associations were independent of other OA features, i.e. osteophytes and dorsal vascularity. Analysis of diagnostic performance of OST, revealed an area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.74 for all joints together (p<0.001), 0.69 for PIP joints (p<0.001), 0.54 for DIP joints (p = 0.486), and 0.61 for wrist joints (p = 0.234).OST scores and US synovitis are statistically significantly associated, independent of osteophytes and dorsal vascularity. At this stage, OST performs fair in the assessment of synovitis in PIP joints of hand OA patients."
https://openalex.org/W2915715166,"Quantitative assessments of the severity of bleeding in patients with bleeds within the gastrointestinal tract (GIB) are generally limited to blood tests like the hematocrit. The varied and irregular nature of the data collected during such observations makes it difficult in retrospective data analysis to characterize the complete course of bleeding. We intend to quantify the rate of blood loss over the course of an ICU stay, facilitating more precise analysis of retrospective data, and to use this quantification to examine questions about the effects of GIB.A population of 2,445 intensive care admissions across 2,266 patients with a diagnosis of GIB was studied. Using statistical techniques for smoothing data and accepted medical approaches for calculating blood loss, we are able to convert collections of individual laboratory readings that are difficult to understand into a simple, interpretable overview of the patient's bleeding status over time. To demonstrate this method, we compare patients' standard vital signs while bleeding heavily to times when they are not bleeding, finding a 3.0 ± 0.5% increase in heart rate, a 1.3 ± 0.4% decrease in systolic blood pressure and a 0.9 ± 0.5% decrease in diastolic blood pressure. After considering the effect of bleeding on standard vital signs, we demonstrate that patients with upper GIB have significantly elevated blood urea nitrogen levels while bleeding heavily, with a mean increase of 11.7 ± 7.2%, while patients with lower GIB do not, with a mean increase of 4.2 ± 6.6%.This study introduces a novel method of processing retrospective laboratory data to characterize the course of bleeds within the gastrointestinal tract. This method is used to examine the direct effects of bleeding on a patient and can be deployed in future studies of bleeding using retrospective data."
