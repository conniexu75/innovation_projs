https://openalex.org/W2053665966,"Oxidative stress is a major aspect of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. We have investigated the relationship between oxidative stress and neuronal binding of Abeta oligomers (also known as ADDLs). ADDLs are known to accumulate in brain tissue of AD patients and are considered centrally related to pathogenesis. Using hippocampal neuronal cultures, we found that ADDLs stimulated excessive formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through a mechanism requiring N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) activation. ADDL binding to neurons was reduced and ROS formation was completely blocked by an antibody to the extracellular domain of the NR1 subunit of NMDA-Rs. In harmony with a steric inhibition of ADDL binding by NR1 antibodies, ADDLs that were bound to detergent-extracted synaptosomal membranes co-immunoprecipitated with NMDA-R subunits. The NR1 antibody did not affect ROS formation induced by NMDA, showing that NMDA-Rs themselves remained functional. Memantine, an open channel NMDA-R antagonist prescribed as a memory-preserving drug for AD patients, completely protected against ADDL-induced ROS formation, as did other NMDA-R antagonists. Memantine and the anti-NR1 antibody also attenuated a rapid ADDL-induced increase in intraneuronal calcium, which was essential for stimulated ROS formation. These results show that ADDLs bind to or in close proximity to NMDA-Rs, triggering neuronal damage through NMDA-R-dependent calcium flux. This response provides a pathologically specific mechanism for the therapeutic action of memantine, indicates a role for ROS dysregulation in ADDL-induced cognitive impairment, and supports the unifying hypothesis that ADDLs play a central role in AD pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2056218982,"A hallmark in the pathogenesis of cancer is the increased expression of heat shock proteins (Hsps) and other molecular chaperones observed in many tumor types, which is considered to be an adaptive response to enhance tumor cell survival. Heat shock transcription factor 1 (Hsf1) is a major transactivator of Hsp induction and has been proposed to affect tumor initiation and progression, regulating expression of Hsps and other molecular targets. In this report, we provide direct in vivo evidence that Hsf1 plays a critical role in the evolution of spontaneous tumors arising in p53−/− mice. Thus, loss of Hsf1 function did not prolong tumor-free survival, but surprisingly altered the spectrum of tumors that arose in p53−/− mice. Tumor development is rapid in p53−/− mice, which predominantly (about 70%) succumb to lymphomas. In contrast, hsf1−/−p53−/− mice rarely develop lymphomas (<8%), but succumb to other tumor types including testicular carcinomas and soft tissue sarcomas. Our findings suggest that an increase in p53-independent apoptotic cell death in association with altered cytokine signaling and suppressed production of inflammatory factors in hsf1−/− mice may contribute to selective lymphoma suppression. In conclusion, the data presented here link the loss of Hsf1-dependent function to decreased susceptibility to spontaneous lymphomagenesis, which may have implications for cancer prevention and therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2072365996,"Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which is associated with infection by Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV)/human herpesvirus-8. The c-Myc transcription factor plays an important role in cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Lymphomas frequently have deregulated c-Myc expression owing to chromosomal translocations, amplifications or abnormal stabilization. However, no structural abnormalities were found in the c-myc oncogene in PEL. Given that c-Myc is often involved in lymphomagenesis, we hypothesized that it is deregulated in PEL. We report that PEL cells have abnormally stable c-Myc protein. The turnover of c-Myc protein is stringently regulated by post-transcriptional modifications, including phosphorylation of c-Myc threonine 58 (T58) by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Our data show that the impaired c-Myc degradation in PEL cells is associated with a significant underphosphorylation of c-Myc T58. The KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is responsible for this deregulation. Overexpression of LANA in human embryonic kidney 293 or peripheral blood B cells leads to post-transcriptional deregulation of c-Myc protein. Conversely, when LANA is eliminated from PEL cells using RNA interference, GSK-3β-mediated c-Myc T58 phosphorylation is restored. The presence of c-Myc and LANA in GSK-3β-containing complexes in PEL cells further confirms the significance of these interactions in naturally KSHV-infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2054106515,"Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) is an RNA-binding protein with multiple functions in the regulation of RNA processing and IRES-mediated translation. We report here overexpression of PTB in a majority of epithelial ovarian tumors revealed by immunoblotting and tissue microarray (TMA) staining. By western blotting, we found that PTB was overexpressed in 17 out of 19 ovarian tumor specimens compared to their matched-normal tissues. By TMA staining, we found PTB expression in 38 out of 44 ovarian cancer cases but only in two out of nine normal adjacent tissues. PTB is also overexpressed in SV40 large T-antigen immortalized ovarian epithelial cells compared to normal human ovarian epithelial cells. Using doxycycline-inducible small interfering RNA technology, we found that knockdown of PTB expression in the ovarian tumor cell line A2780 substantially impaired tumor cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth and in vitro invasiveness. These results suggest that overexpression of PTB is an important component of the multistep process of tumorigenesis, and might be required for the development and maintenance of epithelial ovarian tumors. Moreover, because of its novel role in tumor cell growth and invasiveness, shown here for the first time, PTB may be a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of ovarian cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2133704608,"Potassium (K+) channels have been implicated in proliferation of some tumor cells. However, whether K+ channels are important to the pathogenesis of endometrial cancer (EC) remains unknown. In the present study, we report that intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (IKCa1) channels play a critical role in the development of EC. The expression of IKCa1 at both mRNA and protein levels in EC tissues was greatly increased than that in atypical hyperplasia and normal tissues. Treatment of EC cells with clotrimazole and TRAM-34, two agents known to inhibit IKCa1 channels, suppressed the proliferation of EC cells and blocked EC cell cycle at G0/G1 phase. Similarly, downregulation of IKCa1 by siRNA against IKCa1 inhibited EC cell proliferation and arrested its cell cycle at G0/G1 phase. A clotrimazole-sensitive K+ current was induced in EC cells in response to the increased Ca2+. The current density induced by Ca2+ was greatly reduced by clotrimazole, TRAM-34, charybdotoxin or downregulation of IKCa1 by the siRNA against IKCa1. Furthermore, TRAM-34 and clotrimazole slowed the formation in nude mice of tumor generated by injection of EC cells. Our results suggest that increased activity of IKCa1 channel is necessary for the development of EC."
https://openalex.org/W2015177498,"To investigate the mechanism by which HSulf-1 expression is downregulated in ovarian cancer, DNA methylation and histone acetylation of HSulf-1 was analysed in ovarian cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Treatment of OV207 and SKOV3 by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine resulted in increased transcription of HSulf-1. Sequence analysis of bisulfite-modified genomic DNA from ovarian cell lines and primary tumors without HSulf-1 expression revealed an increase in the frequency of methylation of 12 CpG sites in exon 1A. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed an increase in histone H3 methylation in cell lines without HSulf-1 expression. To assess the significance of HSulf-1 downregulation in ovarian cancer, OV167 and OV202 cells were transfected with HSulf-1 siRNA. Downregulation of HSulf-1 expression in OV167 and OV202 cells lead to an attenuation of cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, patients with ovarian tumors expressing higher levels of HSulf-1 showed a 90% response rate (27/30) to chemotherapy compared to a response rate of 63% (19/30) in those with weak or moderate levels (P=0.0146, χ2 test). Collectively, these data indicate that HSulf-1 is epigenetically silenced in ovarian cancer and that epigenetic therapy targeting HSulf-1 might sensitize ovarian tumors to conventional first-line therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1996120254,"Cellular protein kinases, phosphatases, and other serotonin transporter (SERT) interacting proteins participate in several signaling mechanisms regulating SERT activity. The molecular mechanisms of protein kinase G (PKG)-mediated SERT regulation and the site of transporter phosphorylation were investigated. Treatment of rat midbrain synaptosomes with 8-bromo-cGMP increased SERT activity, and the increase was selectively blocked by PKG inhibitors. The Vmax value for serotonin (5-HT) transport increased following cGMP treatment. However, surface biotinylation studies showed no change in SERT surface abundance following PKG activation. 32P metabolic labeling experiments showed increased SERT phosphorylation in the presence of cGMP that was abolished by selectively inhibiting PKG. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that cGMP-stimulated native SERT phosphorylation occurred only on threonine residues. When added to CHO-1 cells expressing SERT, 8-bromo-cGMP stimulated 5-HT transport and SERT phosphorylation. Mutation of SERT threonine 276 to alanine completely abolished cGMP-mediated stimulation of 5-HT transport and SERT phosphorylation. Although the T276A mutation had no significant effect on 5-HT transport or SERT protein expression, mutation to aspartate (T276D) increased the level of 5-HT uptake to that of cGMP-stimulated 5-HT uptake in wild-type SERT-expressing cells and was no longer sensitive to cGMP. These findings provide the first identification of a phosphorylation site in SERT and demonstrate that phosphorylation of Thr-276 is required for cGMP-mediated SERT regulation. They also constitute the first evidence that in the central nervous system PKG activation stimulates endogenous SERT activity by a trafficking-independent mechanism.

Raven Press, New York1995: 321-333Google Scholar). Therefore, the activity of SERT in the presynaptic plasma membrane is a critical factor that determines the strength of serotonergic neurotransmission. SERT expression and function are regulated by SERT gene transcription, translation, and post-translation modifications linked to protein kinases, phosphatases, and interacting proteins (3Ramamoorthy S.

Previously, we and others have demonstrated that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) or inhibition of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, protein phosphatase 2Ac (PP2Ac), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) decrease SERT activity in a variety of systems (5Qian Y.

Mutations in SERT that affect the PKG pathway have been found associated with psychiatric disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and Asperger syndrome (10Kilic F. Murphy D.L. Rudnick G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Activation of PKC and PKA, or inhibition of PP2Ac, increases SERT basal phosphorylation in HEK 293-hSERT cells. Phosphorylation of SERT by PKC and dephosphorylation by PP2Ac showed close temporal correlation with 5-HT transport, surface expression, and SERT endocytosis (8Ramamoorthy S. Giovanetti E. Qian Y. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2458-2466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SERT activity attenuates the PKC effects on SERT phosphorylation, surface expression, and SERT-PP2Ac interactions (7Ramamoorthy S. Blakely R.D. Science. 1999; 285: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 14Bauman A.L. Apparsundaram S. Ramamoorthy S. Wadzinski B.E. Vaughan R.A. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7571-7578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent studies demonstrated that SERT is constitutively phosphorylated and that SERT basal phosphorylation is sensitive to p38 MAPK (9Samuvel D.J. Jayanthi L.D. Bhat N.R. Ramamoorthy S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that presynaptic receptors modulate SERT function and 5-HT homeostasis through a common mechanism by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of SERT in response to altered protein kinase and phosphatase activities. Despite these findings, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to SERT regulation is incomplete. Also, the direct link between phosphorylation of SERT and 5-HT uptake has not yet been verified in SERT phosphorylation site mutants. The intracellular domains of SERT (15Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Rudnick G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8370-8378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) contain potential phosphorylation sites for several protein kinases (16Ramamoorthy S. Bauman A. Moore K. Han H. Yang-Feng T.

This raises the possibility that SERT may be regulated by direct phosphorylation. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that SERT phosphorylation by PKG is linked to cGMP regulation of 5-HT transport. We used the following: (a) rat midbrain synaptosomes to identify the molecular events in native SERT regulation by cGMP and PKG, and (b) a heterologous cell model system to identify the molecular site(s) of SERT phosphorylation in cGMP- and PKG-dependent transporter regulation. Using the synaptosomal preparation, we demonstrate that 8-Br-cGMP stimulates 5-HT uptake via PKG activation without altering SERT surface density. PKG activation also leads to SERT phosphorylation on threonine residue(s). Using SERT mutants with various intracellular threonines replaced, we find that cGMP- and PKG-mediated SERT regulation in CHO-1 cells requires phosphorylation of Thr-276 located in the fifth transmembrane domain near the second intracellular loop of SERT. These findings demonstrate for the first time a mechanistic basis for the direct link between 5-HT transport and alterations in SERT phosphorylation in response to changes in PKG activity. Materials—8-Br-cGMP, H-8, fluoxetine, 5-HT, and detergents were obtained from Sigma. Okadaic acid was purchased from LC Laboratories/Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Bisindolylmaleimide I was purchased from Calbiochem. [3H]5-HT (5-hydroxy[3H]tryptamine trifluoroacetate), 32PO4 carrier-free orthophosphate, protein A beads, ECL reagent, and ECL enhanced film were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. NHS-SS-biotin and monomeric avidin beads were from Pierce. All cell culture media and other reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. FuGENE 6 was from Roche Diagnostics. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Anti-calnexin was from StressGen (Victoria, Canada). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Other reagents were of the highest grade possible from standard sources. Synaptosome Preparations—All animal procedures were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and all animal use protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (100–150 g) were decapitated, and the midbrain was immediately homogenized in 10 volumes (w/v) of cold 0.32 m sucrose. The crude synaptosomal pellet (P2 fraction) was further purified as described previously (9Samuvel D.J. Jayanthi L.D. Bhat N.R. Ramamoorthy S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The purified synaptosomes were suspended in regular Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (KRH) buffer saturated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Protein concentration was determined by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. 5-HT Uptake in Synaptosomes—10–20 μg of purified synaptosomes were incubated in 250 μl of assay buffer containing 0.1 mm ascorbic acid, 0.1 mm pargyline, and 20 nm [3H]5-HT for 3 min. Synaptosomes were preincubated with the modulators at 37 °C for the indicated times followed by addition of [3H]5-HT to initiate 5-HT uptake as described previously (9Samuvel D.J. Jayanthi L.D. Bhat N.R. Ramamoorthy S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). For saturation analysis, [3H]5-HT was mixed with unlabeled 5-HT and varied from 10 nm to 1 μm. Nonspecific [3H]5-HT uptake was defined as the accumulation in the presence of 100 nm fluoxetine and was subtracted from total uptake. Uptake was terminated by addition of 3 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 μm imipramine) followed by rapid filtration over 0.3% polyethyleneimine-coated GF-B filters using a Brandel cell harvester. Filters were washed rapidly with 5 ml of cold stop buffer, and radioactivity bound to the filter was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. All uptake assays were performed in triplicate, and mean values of specific uptake ± S.E. from at least three separate experiments were determined. Surface Biotinylation—Cell surface SERT in purified synaptosomal preparations was determined as described previously (9Samuvel D.J. Jayanthi L.D. Bhat N.R. Ramamoorthy S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of purified synaptosomes were incubated with cGMP or vehicle for 15 min at 37 °C. The samples were washed quickly, and the pellets were treated with NHS-SS-Biotin (0.5 mg/1 mg of protein) for 20 min at 4 °C in cold Krebs-bicarbonate buffer. The samples were subsequently washed with the same buffer containing 100 mm glycine, and the pellet was resuspended in RIPA lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm sodium fluoride, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm activated orthovanadate, and 1 μm okadaic acid). The resuspended synaptosomes were triturated 10 times through a 25-gauge needle and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min. The biotinylated proteins were separated from clear supernatant fluid by incubation with monomeric avidin beads for 4 h at 4 °C, washing three times with RIPA buffer, and extraction with Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at room temperature. Aliquots from total extracts, unbound fractions, and bead eluate were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with SERT-specific SR-12 antibody as described previously (9Samuvel D.J. Jayanthi L.D. Bhat N.R. Ramamoorthy S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). SERT-reactive proteins were visualized using ECL Plus reagent followed by exposure to Hyperfilm-ECL (GE Healthcare). Multiple exposures of immunoblots were taken to ensure the band development on the film was within the linear range. Band densities were quantified by scanning and analyzed using NIH ImageJ (version 1.32j) software. Subsequently, the blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-calnexin antibody to validate the surface biotinylation of plasma membrane proteins. SERT densities from total, nonbiotinylated (representing the intracellular pool), and biotinylated (representing the surface pool) fractions were normalized using levels of calnexin in the total extract. SERT Phosphorylation—The protocol for assaying cGMP-dependent SERT phosphorylation was similar to that described previously (7Ramamoorthy S. Blakely R.D. Science. 1999; 285: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 8Ramamoorthy S. Giovanetti E. Qian Y. Blakely R.D. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Synaptosomes (1 mg) were incubated with 4.0 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (carrier-free) for 60 min prior to the addition of modulators (as indicated). Samples were then centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in RIPA buffer (containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors) by passing through a 25-gauge needle 10 times. The clear supernatant obtained after sedimenting the solubilized synaptosomes at 45,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C was passed through a Sephadex G-50 spin column to remove unused 32P and free 32P-labeled ATP before immunoprecipitation with the SR-12 antibody. To test specificity, additional experiments were performed in parallel using SR-12 preimmune serum as described previously (9Samuvel D.J. Jayanthi L.D. Bhat N.R. Ramamoorthy S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were captured by the addition of protein A-Sepharose. The beads were washed with RIPA buffer prior to extraction with 60 μl of Laemmli sample buffer for 30 min at 22 °C. Eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (4–15%), and radiolabeled SERT was detected by autoradiography. Multiple exposures (1–4 days) were evaluated by digital quantitation using NIH ImageJ (version 1.32j) software to ensure that results were within the linear range of the film. Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described previously (19Ramamoorthy S. Balasubramanian A.S. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 32P-labeled SERT was immunoisolated from cGMP-treated synaptosomes and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above. The band corresponding to 32P-labeled SERT was excised from the gel and incubated in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1% SDS, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 μg of histone (as carrier) with continuous overnight shaking at 22 °C. Eluted protein was precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid and subjected to acid hydrolysis for 90 min in 5.7 n HCl at 110 °C, and the samples were subjected to high voltage electrophoresis as described previously (19Ramamoorthy S. Balasubramanian A.S. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Standard phosphoamino acids were added to the radioactive samples during hydrolysis and located by ninhydrin spray. The 32P-phosphoamino acids from SERT were located by autoradiography and aligned with standards as we have described previously (19Ramamoorthy S. Balasubramanian A.S. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Threonine residues in hSERT intracellular domains were mutated to alanine or aspartic acid residues using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). XhoI/AgeI or XbaI/AgeI fragments containing the mutated site(s) were then ligated into correspondingly cut wild-type hSERT. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing the DNAs on both strands. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—CHO-1 cells were cultured as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine in 25- or 75-cm2 flasks in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% humidity at 37 °C. For transient transfection experiments, trypsin-released cells were seeded in 6-well (200,000 cells/well) or 24-well (50,000 cells/well) plates. Cells were transfected with hSERT plasmids or the empty vector using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocols. Where indicated, cells were treated with different modulators as described after 24 h of transfection. 5-HT Uptake in Transfected CHO-1 Cells—5-HT uptake was performed as described previously (7Ramamoorthy S.

Cells were preincubated with the modulators at 37 °C for the indicated times followed by addition of [3H]5-HT to initiate 5-HT uptake. Uptake was terminated after 10 min of incubation at 37 °C by rapid washings with KRH assay buffer containing 100 nm fluoxetine. Cells were lysed, and the accumulated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. Specific 5-HT uptake measurements were performed as described above. Cell-surface Biotinylation and Immunoblotting—Cell-surface biotinylation on transfected cells was performed as described previously (7Ramamoorthy S. Blakely R.D. Science. 1999; 285: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 20Ramamoorthy S. Melikian H.E. Qian Y. Blakely R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 347-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) following treatments with different modulators as indicated elsewhere. Biotinylated and nonbiotinylated proteins were separated by monomeric avidin bead binding and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above. Biotinylated and nonbiotinylated SERT proteins were identified by immunoblotting with SERT-specific antibody. SERT Phosphorylation in Transfected Cells—SERT phosphorylation in transfected CHO-1 cells was measured as described previously (7Ramamoorthy S. Blakely R.D. Science. 1999; 285: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 20Ramamoorthy S. Melikian H.E. Qian Y. Blakely R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 347-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and subjected to treatments with different modulators as indicated elsewhere. RIPA extracts of the cells were immunoprecipitated with SR-12 antibody along with parallel control experiments using SR-12 preimmune serum as described previously (9Samuvel D.J. Jayanthi L.D. Bhat N.R. Ramamoorthy S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were captured by protein A-Sepharose beads and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography to visualize phosphorylated SERT as described above. Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblotting—SERT immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were performed on detergent extracts of synaptosomes and transfected cells as described previously (9Samuvel D.J. Jayanthi L.D. Bhat N.R. Ramamoorthy S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 14Bauman A.L. Apparsundaram S. Ramamoorthy S. Wadzinski B.E. Vaughan R.A. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7571-7578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein samples were separated using a 4–15% linear gradient SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with specific antibodies as indicated in figure legends. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL Plus). Statistical Analyses—Unless indicated otherwise, experiments were conducted in triplicate, and the mean values ± S.E. from three independent experiments are given. Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Analysis by one-way analysis of variance was used followed by post hoc testing (Tukey-Kramer and Bonferroni). Student's t test was performed for paired observations. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. cGMP Stimulates 5-HT Uptake in Midbrain Synaptosomes via PKG Activation—Fig. 1 shows that the membrane-permeant cGMP analog, 8-Br-cGMP, increases 5-HT uptake by midbrain synaptosomes in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. The time course of stimulation by 250 μm 8-Br-cGMP peaked at 10–15 min and then decreased (Fig. 1A). 5-HT uptake increased maximally (25%) at 250 μm 8-Br-cGMP and decreased above that concentration (Fig. 1B). 8-Br-cGMP-stimulated 5-HT uptake was blocked almost completely when synaptosomes were incubated with PKG-specific inhibitors, KT5823 and (Rp)-8-pcPT-cGMPS, for 30 min prior to exposure to 8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 2). Neither the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I nor the PKA inhibitor KT5720 blocked 8-Br-cGMP-stimulated 5-HT uptake (Fig. 2). Thus, PKG (and not PKC or PKA) seems to be responsible for the stimulation of 5-HT uptake by 8-Br-cGMP.FIGURE 2Effect of PKA, PKC, and PKG inhibitors on 8-Br-cGMP-stimulated 5-HT uptake in synaptosomes. Purified rat midbrain synaptosomes were preincubated with kinase inhibitors for 30 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of 8-Br-cGMP. Synaptosomes were pretreated with vehicle, 10 μm KT5823, 100 μm (Rp)-8-pcPT-cGMP, 500 nm bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM I), or 100 μm KT5720 and incubated with or without 8-Br-cGMP (250 μm) for 15 min before measuring 5-HT uptake as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. *, p < 0.02 versus control; #, <0.02 versus 8-Br-cGMP alone by one-way ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer post-hoc analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For subsequent experiments in this study, preparations were treated with 250 μm 8-Br-cGMP for 15 min, conditions that caused maximal stimulation of 5-HT uptake. Using these conditions, the Km and Vmax values for SERT were determined in vehicle- and 8-Br-cGMP-treated midbrain synaptosomes. 8-Br-cGMP treatment increased the maximal velocity (Vmax) by ∼25% (from 2138.2 ± 35.9 to 2725.0 ± 23.5 fmol/mg protein/min). There was no significant change in the Km value following cGMP treatment (Km values, control 40.39 ± 0.2 nm and 8-Br-cGMP 36.77 ± 3.3 nm). Lack of Surface SERT Redistribution in cGMP-induced SERT Activation—One potential mechanism by which 8-Br-cGMP could increase Vmax for 5-HT transport is by altering trafficking events such that more functional SERT is available on the cell-surface for 5-HT uptake. Therefore, we measured cell-surface SERT by surface biotinylation and immunoblotting (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 shows that acute treatment with 8-Br-cGMP had no effect on either SERT surface density or total SERT protein levels. These results suggest that 8-Br-cGMP activation of PKG in synaptosomes activates 5-HT uptake by increasing the intrinsic activity of SERT. cGMP Induces PKG-dependent SERT Phosphorylation—If PKG is necessary for the regulation of SERT activity by 8-Br-cGMP, it is possible that PKG directly phosphorylates SERT, increasing its intrinsic activity. To address whether SERT is phosphorylated by PKG in synaptosomal preparations, we tested the effect of pretreatment with 8-Br-cGMP on the extent of SERT phosphorylation in synaptosomes metabolically labeled with 32PO4. Fig. 4 shows that pretreatment of such synaptosomes with 8-Br-cGMP led to a marked increase in SERT phosphorylation. 8-Br-cGMP-induced SERT phosphorylation was effectively blocked by the PKG inhibitors KT5823 and (Rp)-8-pcPT-cGMPs but not by KT5720 or bisindolylmaleimide I, inhibitors of PKA or PKC, respectively (Fig. 4). The increase in 32P-SERT mirrored the effects of 8-Br-cGMP on SERT activity (Fig. 1). The 32P-labeled band was not found when immunoprecipitation was performed with preimmune serum (Fig. 4). cGMP Increases Phosphorylation of SERT Threonine Residue(s)—Having shown that PKG activation leads to SERT phosphorylation, we next sought to determine the phosphoamino acid composition of PKG-phosphorylated SERT. Under basal, unstimulated conditions, 32P-labeled SERT was detected (Fig. 4). However, because of the low level of SERT phosphorylation, we could not determine the phosphoamino acid composition of unstimulated phospho-SERT. Fig. 5 shows that after 15 min of incubation with 8-Br-cGMP, the increased phosphorylation of SERT was exclusively in phosphothreonine. These data suggest that 8-Br-cGMP induces SERT phosphorylation on threonines but not on serines or tyrosines. cGMP-induced SERT Regulation Requires Phosphorylation of SERT on Threonine 276—To identify the site of threonine phosphorylation in SERT, and to verify its functional importance in 5-HT transport, we used heterologous expression of hSERT mutants in CHO-1 cells. We individually mutated to alanine each of the 18 threonines predicted by homology with the structure of LeuT (21Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 22Beuming T. Shi L. Javitch J.A. Weinstein H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1630-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) to have cytoplasmic exposure. We then expressed the mutants in CHO-1 cells and screened for the ability of 8-Br-cGMP to stimulate 5-HT uptake. SERT contains nine threonines in the N terminus (Thr-3, -4, -33, -59, -66, -67, -68, -69, and -81), one near the second intracellular loop (Thr-276), two in the fourth intracellular loop (Thr-439 and Thr-448), one in the fifth intracellular loop (Thr-519), and five in the C terminus (Thr-600, -603, -613, -616, and -618). Consistent with the stimulatory effect of 8-Br-cGMP on 5-HT uptake in synaptosomes (Fig. 1), exposure of CHO-1 cells expressing wild-type hSERT to 8-Br-cGMP (250 μm) for 15 min stimulated 5-HT uptake, and the effect was blocked when the PKG inhibitor (Rp)-8-pcPT-cGMPs was applied prior to 8-Br-cGMP treatment (Fig. 6). Of all the single threonine mutants, only T276A failed to respond to 8-Br-cGMP with an increase in 5-HT uptake (Figs. 6 and 7A). In cells expressing all other single mutants, 5-HT uptake responded to 8-Br-cGMP comparably to wild type. Following 8-Br-cGMP treatment, we found enhanced SERT incorporation of 32P in cells expressing wild-type hSERT. However, 8-Br-cGMP failed to enhance 32P incorporation into SERT in cells expressing the T276A mutant (Fig. 7, C and D). In the absence of any modulator, we de"

Increasing the binding affinity was shown to specifically increase the antiproliferative potency of IFNα2. Here, we constructed a phage display library by randomizing three positions on IFNα2 previously shown to confer weak binding to IFNAR1. The tightest binding variant selected, comprised of mutations H57Y, E58N, and Q61S (YNS), was shown to bind IFNAR1 60-fold tighter compared with wild-type IFNα2, and 3-fold tighter compared with IFNβ. Binding of YNS to IFNAR2 was comparable with wild-type IFNα2. The YNS mutant conferred a 150-fold higher antiproliferative potency in WISH cells compared with wild-type IFNα2, whereas its antiviral activity was increased by only 3.5-fold. The high antiproliferative activity was related to an induction of apoptosis, as demonstrated by annexin V binding assays, and to specific gene induction, particularly TRAIL. To determine the potency of the YNS mutant in a xenograft cancer model, we injected it twice a week to nude mice carrying transplanted MDA231 human breast cancer cells. After 5 weeks, no tumors remained in mice treated with YNS, whereas most mice treated with wild-type IFNα2 showed visible tumors. Histological analysis of these tumors showed a significant anti-angiogenic effect of YNS, compared with wild-type IFNα2. This work demonstrates the application of detailed biophysical understanding in the process of protein engineering, yielding an interferon variant with highly increased biological potency.

Type I interferons (IFNs) 3The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type; ISG, interferon-stimulated gene; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; JAK, Janus family kinase. are multifunctional cytokines that orchestrate the antiviral innate immunity in vertebrates, acting in virtually every nucleated cell. They belong to the helical cytokine superfamily (1Klaus W. Gsell B. Labhardt A.M. Wipf B. Senn H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 661-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and consist of at least 17 different members in humans: 13 different IFNα subtypes, IFNβ, IFNω, and IFNκ, all of which share significant amino acid homology (2Chen J.B. Baig E. Fish E.N. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2004; 24: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). All type I interferons induce their biological effects through a common receptor, composed of two distinct transmembrane proteins, namely IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 (3Uze G. Lutfalla G. Gresser I. Cell. 1990; 60: 225-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 4Cohen B. Novick D. Barak S. Rubinstein M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4208-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 5Brierley M.M. Fish E.N. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Upon formation of the ternary complex, the interferon signal is transduced through receptor-associated Janus family kinases (JAK), which activate the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins. These, in turn, form homo- and heterodimers that translocate to the nucleus, where they directly regulate the transcription of specific interferon responsive genes (6Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). In addition to their important roles at the first line of defense against viral infections (7Haller O. Kochs G. Weber F. Virology. 2006; 344: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) and in modulation of the adaptive immune system (8Theofilopoulos A.N. Baccala R. Beutler B. Kono D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 307-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), type I interferons are capable of inducing a significant antiproliferative activity (9Platanias L.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2372) Google Scholar). Consequently, interferons are widely used in the clinic for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and chronic hepatitis (10Cooksley W.G. Piratvisuth T. Lee S.D. Mahachai V. Chao Y.C. Tanwandee T. Chutaputti A. Chang W.Y. Zahm F.E. Pluck N. J. Viral Hepatitis. 2003; 10: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 11Goodin D.S. Frohman E.M. Garmany G.P. Halper J. Likosky W.H. Lublin F.D. Silberberg D.H. Stuart W.H. van den Noort S. Neurology. 2002; 58: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), as well as for a number of malignancies (12Caraglia M. Vitale G. Marra M. Budillon A. Tagliaferri P. Abbruzzese A. Curr. Protein Peptide Sci. 2004; 5: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the efficiency of interferon treatment in the majority of cancers is modest, limited by side effects and varying resistance of malignant cells to this treatment (13Slaton J.W. Karashima T. Perrotte P. Inoue K. Kim S.J. Izawa J. Kedar D. McConkey D.J. Millikan R. Sweeney P. Yoshikawa C. Shuin T. Dinney C.P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 2840-2853PubMed Google Scholar, 14Einhorn S. Grander D. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Despite their sequence homology and shared receptor, type I interferons are not redundant, but rather induce their activities differentially (15Rosenblum M.G. Yung W.K. Kelleher P.J. Ruzicka F. Steck P.A. Borden E.C. J. Interferon Res. 1990; 10: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Grumbach I.M. Fish E.N. Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Colamonici O.R. Figulla H.R. Heim A. Platanias L.C. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). One important example is the substantially higher antiproliferative response induced by IFNβ relative to IFNα. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying this differential signaling, which is initiated through the same receptor complex, remains unclear. However, we have recently shown that whereas the binding affinity of interferon toward IFNAR2 correlates with both antiviral and antiproliferative activities (17Piehler J. Roisman L.C. Schreiber G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40425-40433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), a change in the affinity toward IFNAR1 translates differently between these two activities (18Jaitin D.A. Roisman L.C. Jaks E. Gavutis M. Piehler J. Van der Heyden J. Uze G. Schreiber G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1888-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Specifically, we have found that increasing the affinity of IFNα2 toward IFNAR1 is accompanied by a significant increase in its antiproliferative activity, whereas its antiviral activity is minimally affected. Moreover, sequence alignment of the different human IFNα proteins showed that their weak binding toward IFNAR1 is a conserved characteristic, as manifested by three conserved positions on IFNα2 (His57, Glu58, and Gln61), of which mutations to Ala caused a significant increase in the binding affinity and antiproliferative activity of this mutant (termed HEQ). Here, we exploited this important aspect of type I interferon behavior by using phage display to further optimize the IFNAR1-binding affinity of IFNα2. Indeed, an optimized IFNAR1 binder, screened out of a mutant library, exhibited a 150-fold enhanced antiproliferative activity on cell cultures, accompanied by only a minor (3.5-fold) change in antiviral activity. In light of the importance of IFN in cancer therapy, we further discuss the implications of the YNS mutant in improving this mostly unfulfilled promise, and show how it confers a significantly stronger anti-tumor activity in a mouse model. Cell Lines and Antibodies—Human epithelial WISH cells and human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were kindly provided by Daniela Novick (Weizmann Institute of Science) and Lea Eisenbach (Weizmann Institute of Science), respectively. Monoclonal anti-IFNAR1-EC DB2 and AA3 antibodies were a gift from Biogene. Monoclonal anti-IFNAR2-EC 46.10 and 117.7 were a gift from Daniela Novick. Phage Display—Screening for strong IFNAR1 binders was carried out using a hybrid phage-display system comprised of a phagemid encoding for a P3 viral-coat protein fused to an IFNα2 gene followed by a FLAG tag, which encodes for an epitope peptide used to detect expression of this construct on the phage envelope by ELISA. A helper phage is added to encode for the necessary proteins for phage assembly (19Sidhu S.S. Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 333-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The library was produced by site-directed mutagenesis at positions 57, 58, and 61 of the fused IFN, using T7 DNA polymerase for primer extension on a single-stranded DNA template. The template was produced in Escherichia coli CJ236 cells (dut-/ung-) incorporating uracils. The resulting phagemid library was transformed into ss320 bacteria by electrophoresis, and a phage library was subsequently produced. Proper IFN protein expression on the phages was confirmed by binding to Maxi-sorp plates (Nunc) coated with anti-FLAG antibodies, followed by ELISA using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phage antibodies. The proper folding of the expressed IFN was assessed according to the ability to bind IFNAR2-EC, using a similar ELISA sandwich assay where Maxisorp plates were coated with non-neutralizing anti-IFNAR2 46.10 antibody, followed by addition of IFNAR2 and IFN-producing phages. These were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phage antibodies. Specific IFNAR1 library screening was done similarly, with Maxisorp plates coated with anti-IFNAR1-EC DB2 antibody (20Goldman L.A. Zafari M. Cutrone E.C. Dang A.J. Brickelmeier M. Runkel L. Benjamin C.D. Ling L.E. Langer J.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), followed by addition of IFNAR1 and IFN producing phages. Control wells consisted of antibody coat only. Phage elution was carried out in three sequential steps, using 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 m HCl. Phage numbers were calculated from the number of bacterial colonies formed after phage transfection at serial dilutions. After the fifth round of panning, individual phages were tested individually for IFNAR1-EC binding by ELISA. Phagemids from positive clones were extracted for sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—IFNα2 and IFNAR2-EC were expressed using the expression vector pT7T318U in E. coli BL21 strain and purified by ion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography (21Piehler J. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). YNS was expressed in the E. coli Rosetta strain, where it was found mainly in inclusion bodies. Following four washing cycles with Triton wash solution (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl) and one additional wash without Triton, the protein was unfolded in 6 m guanidine and then refolded by 1:20 dilution in 0.8 m arginine, pH 9.3, followed by dialysis in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The protein was then purified on an ion-exchange column. Proteins were analyzed by analytical gel filtration chromatography to assess purity and binding activity. Protein concentrations were determined both by analytical gel filtration chromatography and from the absorbance at 280 nm with ϵ280 = 18,500 cm-1 m-1 for IFNα2 and ϵ280 = 26,500 cm-1 m-1 for IFNAR2-EC. IFNAR1-EC was expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified as described before (22Lamken P. Lata S. Gavutis M. Piehler J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 303-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and was a generous gift from Jacob Piehler. Binding Measurements—Binding affinities of IFN toward IFNAR1-EC or IFNAR2-EC were measured using the ProteOn XPR36 Protein Interaction Array system (Bio-Rad), based on surface plasmon resonance technology. A solution of 0.005% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4, was used as running buffer at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. For immobilization, an activated EDC/NHS surface was covered with the non-neutralizing antibodies DB2 and 46.10 against IFNAR1-EC and IFNAR2-EC, respectively, and blocked with ethanolamine. Thereafter, five of the six channels were reacted with IFNAR1-EC or IFNAR2-EC (180 μlata concentration of 0.5 μm), leaving one channel free as reference. This was followed by cross-linking a second antibody, AA3 for IFNAR1-EC and 117.7 for IFNAR2-EC (23Piehler J. Schreiber G. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interferons were then injected perpendicular to ligands, at six different concentrations within a range of 37 to 8,000 nm for IFNAR1 binding and 3.12 to 100 nm for IFNAR2 binding. Data were analyzed with BIAeval 4.1 software, using the standard Langmuir models for fitting kinetic data. Dissociation constants KD were determined from the rate constants according to, KD=koffkon(Eq.1) or from the equilibrium response at six different analyte concentrations, fitted to the mass-action equation. Determination of IC50 Binding Values on WISH Cells—Wild-type (WT) IFNα2 was labeled with 125I using the chloramine T iodination method (24Jacobs S. Hazum E. Shechter Y. Cuatrecasas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4918-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). After iodination, the radiolabeled interferon was cleaned using a homemade Sephadex column. For the competition assay, WISH cells were grown on 24-well plates, washed once with PBS + 0.1% sodium azide, and then incubated for 10 min with the same solution. Cells were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature (20 °C) with labeled IFNα2 (200,000 cpm/well) in the presence of unlabeled IFNα2 WT or YNS at different concentrations (50 nm to 25 pm), in culture medium + 0.1% sodium azide. Thereafter, cells were washed twice in PBS, trypsinated, and transferred into test tubes for measuring of bound, 125I-labeled IFNα2 WT, using a γ-counter (Packard). The experiment was repeated three times, each time in duplicates. IC50 values were calculated using Kaleidagraph Synergy Software. Antiviral and Antiproliferative Assays—The antiproliferative assay (25Roisman L.C. Jaitin D.A. Baker D.P. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) on WISH and MDA-MB-231 cells was conducted by adding IFN (IFNα2 WT, YNS, or IFNβ) at serial dilutions to the growth medium in flat-bottomed microtiter plates, and monitoring cell density after 72 h by staining with crystal violet. The 50% activity concentrations (EC50), as well as the sensitivity of cells to increasing amounts of interferon, were deduced from an IFN dose-response curve (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software) using Equation 2, y=A0+A/(1+C/EC50)s(Eq.2) where y is the absorbance and reflects the relative number of cells, A0 is the offset, A is the amplitude, c is the IFN concentration, and s is the slope (25Roisman L.C. Jaitin D.A. Baker D.P. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Antiviral activity of IFNα2 WT, YNS, and IFNβ was assayed as the inhibition of the cytopathic effect of vesicular stomatitis virus on human WISH and MDA-MB-231 cells, as described previously (25Roisman L.C. Jaitin D.A. Baker D.P. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Rubinstein M. Pestka S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 78: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In general, IFN was added at serial dilutions to cells grown on flat-bottomed microtiter plates. Four hours later vesicular stomatitis virus was added to all wells, and after 17 h of incubation cell density was measured by crystal violet staining. EC50 was calculated as described for the antiproliferative experiment. Both the antiviral and antiproliferative assays were repeated at least 3 times for each protein. The experimental error (σ) for both assays was 35%. Therefore, a 2 σ confidence level would suggest that differences smaller than 2-fold between interferons are within the experimental error. Annexin V/PI Assay—Apoptosis was monitored by the phosphatidylserine content on the outer leaflet of the cell membrane with the annexin V-FITC/PI assay kit (Bender MedSystems). Cells were detached with 5 mm EDTA in PBS and labeled with annexin V following the kit manufacturer's instructions. Samples were analyzed with FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Quantitative PCR—Selected human interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression levels were measured with the ABI Prism 7300 Real-Time PCR System, using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and cDNA samples were produced with Superscript II (Invitrogen) from 1 μg of total RNA, extracted with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Primer sequences were designed using the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). Standard curves were generated per primer pair using serial dilutions of an IFN treatment sample, to ensure reaction efficiencies of 100 ± 5%: only primers that yielded a -3.3 slope (± 0.3), corresponding to an amplification efficiency of 2 (efficiency = 10-1/slope) were used. Both primer and template concentrations were optimized. Quantitative PCR was performed using 1.25 ng of cDNA for HLA-F, ISG15, and MDA5, and 2.5 ng for TRAIL and CASP1 transcript levels, in a total volume of 20 μl and at least in triplicate per sample. Relative expression levels were calculated by the δ-δ cycle threshold (Ct) relative quantification (RQ) method (ddCt, RQ = 2-ddCt), using the untreated cells control as the calibrator sample, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the endogenous control detector (reference gene levels measured on the same sample), at least in triplicate for each sample. Standard error of ddCt, calculated per sample, was calculated as the square root of the sum of squares of four S.E. ± mean Ct; S.E. of tested gene in treatment sample; S.E. of tested gene in control sample; S.E. of reference gene in treatment sample; and S.E. of reference gene in control sample. Western Blot Analysis—Total protein extracts were obtained from WISH cells in RIPA buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were probed with rabbit polyclonal antiserum against STAT1 (1:4,000) or pY701-STAT1 (1:1,000, Santa Cruz), and mouse monoclonal antibodies against α-tubulin (1:20,000, Sigma), detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences) or anti-mouse (Jackson Immunochemicals) antibodies. In Vivo Experiments—All animal procedures were carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Research Animals at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Nude mice (n = 23, 8-week-old) were injected subcutaneously with MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells (107 in 0.2 ml of PBS). Mice were then divided randomly into four treatment groups (IFNα2, YNS, and control n = 6; IFNβ, n = 5). Interferon (20 μg in 0.2 ml of PBS) was injected intraperitoneally; control mice were injected with 0.2 ml of PBS. Treatments were given twice a week, starting at day 3 up to day 35, after which mice were sacrificed; tumor remainders and suspected scar tissues were surgically removed, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin blocks. Sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) for histological analysis. The protocol closely followed that used successfully by Wagner et al. (27Wagner T.C. Velichko S. Chesney S.K. Biroc S. Harde D. Vogel D. Croze E. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 111: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Screening a Phage-displayed IFNα2 Library for Tight IFNAR1 Binding—We have previously identified three conserved residues at the IFNAR1-binding region of IFNα2, namely His57, Glu58, and Gln61, whose combined alanine substitution (termed HEQ) resulted both in a large increase of affinity toward IFNAR1 and a greatly enhanced antiproliferative but not antiviral activity in WISH cells (18Jaitin D.A. Roisman L.C. Jaks E. Gavutis M. Piehler J. Van der Heyden J. Uze G. Schreiber G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1888-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). As it is difficult to envision alanine as an optimal binding residue, we established a phage-display system to isolate even tighter IFNAR1-binding interferon variants out of a library of IFNα2 comprised of random mutations at these three positions. The gene encoding for IFNα2 was inserted into a phagemid encoding for a fusion protein consisting of a phage P3-coat protein at the C-terminal end and a FLAG tag at the N terminus. The phagemid was transfected into E. coli bacteria, and expressed as part of the capsule of M13 phages following infection with K07M13 helper phages. To verify the proper translation of this fusion protein, we conducted an ELISA using anti-FLAG antibody-coated wells, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phage antibodies for detection of specific binding. Positive signals were indicative of both a correct translation of the entire fusion protein in the correct reading frame, and a sufficient level of integration within the phage capsule. Next, the proper folding of the fused IFNα2 was verified by its ability to bind IFNAR2-EC (KD ∼ 5 nm). This was done by a similar ELISA, using IFNAR2-EC-coated wells, which resulted in a significant signal of specifically bound phages. The phagemid library containing all possible codon combinations at positions 57, 58, and 61 (8000 different clones) was constructed using degenerate primers, starting from a template containing a stop codon at each of these positions. The use of stop codons was necessary to avoid a high percentage of wild-type clones in the library, because the digestion of the single-stranded DNA template by the host SS320 bacteria is incomplete. The resulting library contained 1011 phages/ml (according to serial dilutions), ensuring a high copy representation (∼107 phages/ml) of each clone. The first enrichment round of the library included a relatively mild washing step prior to elution with 0.1 mm HCl. As of the second round, the washing steps were increasingly aggressive, and starting from the third round the elution step was made up of three sequential elutions using 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mm HCl. A graphic representation of specific population enrichment along the panning rounds and the following decay thereof, which is a typical feature of this type of screen, is given in Fig. 1. Specific binding levels peaked at the fifth selection round, from which 20 single phage clones were tested for binding to IFNAR1-EC by ELISA. Four of them produced a significant signal (>3-fold higher than background). The residues replacing His57, Glu58, and Gln61 in these clones were YNS, MDL, YLD, and YAS. A clear preference for Tyr is observed for position 57, but no clear preference was observed at the other two positions (except for a preference for polar over hydrophobic residues at a 5:2 ratio). Repeated phage ELISA has shown that the YLD and YAS clones were not stable, as they rapidly lost their binding activity toward both IFNAR1-EC and IFNAR2-EC. We therefore concentrated our efforts on expression and purification of the MDL and YNS clones. Expression, Purification, and Characterization of the IFNα2-YNS Mutant—The standard protocol for expression and purification of IFNα2 mutants (21Piehler J. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) did not work properly for the expression of YNS. We therefore elaborated a new expression protocol, based on unfolding in guanidine HCl and refolding in arginine (see “Experimental Procedures”). Using this protocol, we were able to produce and purify 7.5 mg/liter of the IFNα2-YNS mutant. To examine its activity, we injected this mutant alone or together with IFNAR1-EC, IFNAR2-EC, or both receptor subunits to an analytical gel-filtration column (Fig. 2). The peak corresponding to YNS was occluded by either receptor separately (orange and red lines), as well as by both receptors together (dotted black line), while forming higher Mr heterodimers and ternary complexes, respectively. It should be noted that the retention times of IFNAR1-EC and its complexes are shorter than expected from their calculated molecular mass (R1, 47 kDa; R2, 24.5 kDa; IFN, 18.5 kDa; R2 + IFN, 43 kDa), due to glycosylation of the protein during production (22Lamken P. Lata S. Gavutis M. Piehler J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 303-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The indicated receptor binding and ternary complex formation for YNS is possible due to its higher affinity to IFNAR1-EC, whereas occlusion of IFNα2 WT by IFNAR1 was not detectable in this type of assay. YNS Binds IFNAR1 with 60-Fold Higher Affinity than Wild-type IFNα2—The binding affinities of various IFNs toward IFNAR1-EC and IFNAR2-EC were measured using the multichannel ProteOn XPR36 instrument (Bio-Rad) (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The binding affinity of the YNS mutant toward IFNAR1-EC was 60-fold higher than that of the IFNα2WTand about 3-fold higher than measured for IFNβ, HEQ, or MDL. In contrast, the affinity of YNS, HEQ, and MDL toward the IFNAR2 subunit was about equal to that of the IFNα2WT protein. The binding parameters given here for IFNβ and the HEQ mutant were similar to those reported by us previously (18Jaitin D.A. Roisman L.C. Jaks E. Gavutis M. Piehler J. Van der Heyden J. Uze G. Schreiber G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1888-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), but the affinity of IFNα2 WT toward IFNAR1-EC is some-what higher (1.9 versus 5 μm). Due to the weak binding of IFNα2 WT to IFNAR1-EC, its calculated affinity relies on mass action data rather than kinetic measurements as for the other interferons. Moreover, the current measurements were done on a ProteOn, whereas the previous measurements were done using RIfS, with a different receptor immobilization method applied in each study.TABLE 1Kinetic and affinity binding values of interferons with their receptor subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2IFNAR1-ECIFNAR2-ECIC50 values on WISH cellsaThe IC50 values were determined by mixing cold IFNα2 WT or YNS with 125I-labeled IFNα2 (see “Experimental Procedures”).kakdKdRatiokakd × 10−3KdRationMRatioM−1 s−1s−1nMM−1 s−1bka values for binding IFNAR2 were measured using a stopped-flow (36).

Open table in a new tab To verify the higher affinity of YNS also toward the full IFNAR receptor complex within the cellular environment, a binding competition assay on WISH cells was initiated. 125I-Labeled IFNα2 WT was mixed with cold IFN (either WT or YNS) at concentrations from 0.01 pm to 100 nm and binding of 125I to the cells was measured (see “Experimental Procedures”). YNS exhibited a 20-fold lower IC50 value compared with the wild-type protein (Table 1). The somewhat lower increase in affinity compared with the in vitro assays can be attributed to specific factors of the cellular environment, such as the effect of receptor surface concentrations on ligand-receptor affinity (28Jaks E.

Lowrey D.M. Lichtenheld M. Podack E.R. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3142-3147PubMed Google Scholar). GzmK is closely linked together with the other tryptase GzmA on the same chromosome both in mice and humans (2Grossman W.J. Revell P.A. Lu Z.H. Johnson H. Bredemeyer A.J. Ley T.J. Curr. Opin.

Wiltrout R.H. Turcovski-Corrales S.M. Taub D.D. Cell. Immunol. 1996; 172: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). GzmA-deficient CTLs have only slightly reduced cytolytic activity against allogeneic targets, which still contain 20% tryptase activity (5Davis J.E. Smyth M.J. Trapani J.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). GzmA-deficient CTLs do not affect GzmK gene and its expression. It suggests tryptase GzmK might be a potent granzyme to rescue GzmA function. GzmK is less abundant than GzmA and -B in human lymphokine-activated killer cells (1Hameed A. Lowrey D.M. Lichtenheld M. Podack E.R. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3142-3147PubMed Google Scholar). However GzmK expresses at high levels in CD56high NK cells, memory CD8+ T cells, and CD56+ T cells (6Bratke K. Kuepper M. Bade B. Virchow Jr., J.C. Luttmann W. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 2608-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A recent report showed that circulating levels of GzmK are significantly elevated in virus-infected patients (7Bade B. Lohrmann J. Ten Brinke A. Wolbink A.M. Wolbink G.J. Berge I.J. Virchow Jr., J.C. Luttmann W. Hack C.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 2940-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It suggests GzmK may play an important role in cytolytic lymphocyte-mediated viral clearance. It is unclear how GzmK functions in cytolytic lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity. One early report showed rat GzmK is a slow acting enzyme to induce DNA fragmentation without apoptotic nuclear morphology (8Shi L. Kraut R.P. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). We found human GzmK induces a rapid death with single-stranded DNA nicks independently of caspase activation (9Zhao T. Zhang H. Guo Y. Zhang Q. Hua G. Lu H. Hou Q. Liu H. Fan Z. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 14: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). MacDonald et al. (10MacDonald G. Shi L. Vande Velde C. Lieberman J. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) showed that rat GzmK abolishes mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) and induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production without release of cytochrome c (cyt c). Mitochondria play a central role in apoptosis. Undergoing apoptosis, mitochondrial function is completely disrupted by loss of ΔΨ and an increase of ROS. The outer mitochondrial membrane is destroyed, causing the release of proapoptotic factors, such as cyt c, endonuclease G (EndoG), high temperature-requirement protein A2, SMAC, and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), which can initiate caspase activation and/or other apoptotic process (11Chipuk J.E. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 12Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4036) Google Scholar). The release of the proapoptotic factors from mitochondria is triggered by the opening of a high conductance channel, the permeability transition pore (PTP), which initiates an increase of inner membrane permeability leading to proapoptotic factors release to the intermembrane space (13Bernardi P. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Forte M. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 112-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). ROS induce the opening of the PTP through oxidation-dependent mechanisms and are potent inducers of apoptosis (12Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4036) Google Scholar). Translocation of proapoptotic proteins such as Bid and Bax from the cytosol to the outer mitochondrial membrane disrupts the outer membrane integrity (14Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). One recent study showed GzmA induces a rapid accumulation of ROS and loss of ΔΨ in a caspase-independent manner (15Martinvalet D. Zhu P. Lieberman J. Immunity. 2005; 22: 355-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). But GzmA does not cleave Bid or cause the release of proapoptotic factors (16Fan Z. Zhang Q. Cell.

In this study, we found GzmK provoked mitochondrial swelling and initiated loss of ΔΨ and rapid accumulation of ROS. Blockade of ROS by antioxidants or superoxide scavengers inhibited GzmK-induced cell death. GzmK directly degraded Bid and triggered release of cyt c and EndoG with a Bid-dependent way. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and Reagents—Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Jurkat) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HeLa) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Commercial antibodies were mouse monoclonal antibody against cyt c (BD Pharmingen), β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), and CoxIV (Molecular Probes). Rabbit Bid and EndoG antisera were kindly gifts of Dr. X. Wang. DIOC6 (3Shresta S. Goda P. Wesselschmidt R. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20236-20244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and HE were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). NAC and Tiron were from Sigma. The Pro-Ject™ (PJ) protein transfection reagent kit was from Pierce, and Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate was from BD Pharmingen. Loading GzmK with Pro-Ject, Adenovirus, or Perforin—Cells were washed three times in Hanks' balanced salt solution and resuspended in loading buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution with 0.5 mg of BSA per ml, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2). HeLa cells or Jurkat cells (2 × 105) in 50 μl of loading buffer were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times with different concentrations of GzmK, S-AGzmK, and/or an optimal dose of PJ, adenovirus (Ad), or perforin (PFP). Cells were incubated for an additional 15 min in 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride before being lysed for immunoblot. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Annexin V was used to evaluate phosphatidylserine externalization. Target cells treated with S-AGzmK or GzmK plus PJ were stained with Annexin V-Fluos and propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur device (BD Biosciences). ROS production was performed by adding 2 μm HE just before flow cytometry analysis to cells treated for the indicated times and doses of GzmK plus adenovirus. 30-min exposure of cells to 3% H2O2 was used as a positive control. For ΔΨm, cells treated with GzmK/Ad or CCCP were stained with DiOC6 (3Shresta S. Goda P. Wesselschmidt R. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20236-20244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously (18Barry M. Heibein J.A. Pinkoski M.J. Lee S.F. Moyer R.W. Green D.R. Bleackley R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3781-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In brief, Jurkat cells treated with GzmK/Ad (100 pfu/ml) for the indicated times and doses were harvested and washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution three times. Cells were loaded with 20 nm DiOC6 (3Shresta S. Goda P. Wesselschmidt R. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20236-20244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) for 5 min before FACS analysis. Cells treated with the membrane uncoupler CCCP were used as a positive control. Transmission Electron Microscopy—HeLa cells (5 × 105) were treated with GzmK plus PJ at 37 °C for 4 h. After which, cells were washed twice and fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C for 1 h and postfixed with 2% osmium tetroxide. Cells were dehydrated with sequential immergence in 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% ethanol, and then embedded in Spurr's resin. Ultrathin sections were mounted in copper grids and counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Images were photographed and scanned by using the Eversmart Jazz+ program (Scitex). Time-lapse Microscopy—HeLa cells were plated overnight in culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The media were replaced with loading buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution with 0.5 mg of BSA per ml, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2) plus 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF-DA). The dishes remained at the 37 °C chamber before adding GzmK with adenovirus. Images were captured every 2 min. Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy—HeLa cells (4 × 104) grown overnight on Falcon culture slides (Molecular Probes) were stained with MitoTracker and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then treated with GzmK plus PFP at 37 °C for 2 h. GzmB plus PFP was used as a positive control. After an additional wash with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 for another 20 min, stained with anti-cyt c or anti-CoxIV or anti-EndoG antibodies, and then stained with the secondary antibody Alexa488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG or Alexa594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG. The slides were mounted and observed using laser scanning confocal microscopy (Olympus FV500 microscope). Bid Cleavage Assay—rBid or cell lysates (2 × 105 cell equivalents) were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times with different concentrations of GzmK, S-AGzmK, or GzmB in 20-μl cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2). The reaction products were boiled in SDS loading buffer before SDS-PAGE. For in vivo cleavage assay, cells loaded with GzmK and PJ were lysed with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The lysates were probed by immunoblotting. Mitochondrial Isolation—Murine liver mitochondria were isolated as described (19Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3078) Google Scholar). Briefly, the murine liver was homogenized in ice-cold mitochondria isolation buffer (MIB containing 250 mm mannitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, 0.1% BSA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.2), and the pellets were removed after centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the mitochondria pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of MIB and loaded onto a continuous Percoll gradient that consisted of 30% Percoll, 225 mm mannitol, 25 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 0.1% BSA (pH 7.2). The suspension/gradient was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The mitochondria were abstracted from the brownish band at 1.10 g/ml with a pipette. Then the mitochondrial pellets were washed with MIB by centrifugation at 6300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The mitochondria were resuspended in the buffer containing 400 mm mannitol, 10 mm KH2PO4, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) with 1 mg/ml BSA. Cytochrome c Release—Murine mitochondria were incubated with GzmK or GzmB in the presence or absence of recombinant Bid in a final volume of 50-μl reaction buffer (220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 30 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. SDS buffer (5×) was added to the supernatants and the mitochondrial pellets. The samples were boiled for 5 min and loading onto the 12% SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis using cyt c antibody. GzmK Targets Mitochondria—We previously demonstrated GzmK induces rapid caspase-independent cell death with externalization of phosphatidylserine, nuclear morphological changes, and single-stranded DNA nicks (9Zhao T.

GzmK-induced death is through targeting all the three GzmA substrates of the SET complex, including SET, Ape1, and HMG2 (17Lieberman J. Fan Z. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20Fan Z. Beresford P.J. Oh D.Y. Zhang D. Lieberman J.

Immunol. 2003; 4: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We compared delivery reagents for loading granzymes into the intact cells and found the cationic lipid reagent PJ can substitute for perforin or Ad to transport granzymes into target cells (9Zhao T. Zhang H. Guo Y. Zhang Q. Hua G. Lu H. Hou Q. Liu H. Fan Z. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 14: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Lu H. Hou Q. Zhao T. Zhang H. Zhang Q. Wu L. Fan Z. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Granzymes loaded with PJ induce similar kinetics of death by loading with perforin or Ad. Mitochondrial damage is an initial step for apoptosis. One previous study showed rat GzmK induced an increase of ROS (10MacDonald G. Shi L. Vande Velde C. Lieberman J. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We wanted to investigate whether GzmK provokes morphological changes in mitochondria. GzmK and S-AGzmK were produced with pET26b vector in Escherichia coli or Pichia pastoris system described in our previous report (9Zhao T. Zhang H. Guo Y. Zhang Q. Hua G. Lu H. Hou Q. Liu H. Fan Z. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 14: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). 1 μm GzmK was loaded with PJ into HeLa cells at 37 °C for 4 h and visualized by electronic microscopy. GzmK plus PJ treatment induced profound mitochondrial swelling with loss of cristae structure (Fig. 1). The mitochondria of mock treated cells showed normal features with a condensed state and narrow cristae, identical to the mitochondria of cells treated with S-AGzmK plus PJ or GzmK alone (Fig. 1 and not shown). GzmK Causes Loss of ΔΨ—Mitochondrial functions, including protein import, ATP generation, and lipid biogenesis, are dependent on the maintenance of ΔΨ (24Voisine C. Craig E.A. Zufall N. von Ahsen O. Pfanner N. Voos W. Cell. 1999; 97: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Loss of ΔΨ is likely to contribute to the death of cells (25Ricci J.E. Gottlieb R.A. Green D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). To assess whether GzmK causes ΔΨ collapse, Jurkat cells were treated with GzmK plus Ad and analyzed by FACS analysis. Cells loaded with GzmK plus Ad showed a dose-dependent decrease of ΔΨ, assayed by the change in fluorescence of the sensitive dye DiOC6, which targets to the negatively charged environment of the mitochondrial matrix at a low concentration in intact cells (Fig. 2A). 0.5 μm GzmK started to initiate reduction of ΔΨ within 1 h. Inactive S-AGzmK plus Ad or mock treated cells were without effect. An uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation CCCP was used to treat cells as a positive control. GzmK-induced ΔΨ reduction also occurred in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). 1 μm GzmK plus Ad initiated a dramatic decrease in ΔΨ within 1 h. By 4 h, ΔΨ was completely collapsed. GzmK and Ad alone or S-AGzmK plus Ad had little effect. GzmK-induced ΔΨ rupture requires enzymatic activity of GzmK. GzmK Triggers a Rapid Increase of Intracellular ROS—ROS have been proposed as critical regulators of apoptosis (12Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4036) Google Scholar, 26Balaban R.S. Nemoto S. Finkel T. Cell. 2005; 120: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3302) Google Scholar). Superfluous ROS cause mitochondrial damage as well as nuclear DNA damage. Mitochondria are the major source of intracellular ROS (27Esposito L.A. Melov S. Panov A. Cottrell B.A. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4820-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). ROS can be generated after damage to the mitochondrial inner membrane accompanying the permeability transition, which may be one route for releasing proapoptotic factors from the intramembrane space (28Green D.R. Kroemer G. Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2815) Google Scholar). To detect ROS accumulation in GzmK-induced death, Jurkat cells were treated with GzmK plus Ad as measured by detection of the conversion of hydroethidine (HE) to fluorescent ethidium. 0.2 μm GzmK began to trigger ROS production within 50 min of treatment as seen by the increase in mean fluorescence intensity of the ROS indicator dye (Fig. 3A). GzmK augmented ROS generation with the increasing concentrations. 2 μm GzmK reached a high peak for ROS production (mean fluorescence intensity, 86). ROS accumulate rapidly after GzmK treatment. Within 10 min, GzmK began to generate ROS, and ROS increased over time (Fig. 3B). GzmK, Ad alone, or S-AGzmK with Ad at the same time points all had comparable levels. H2O2-treated cells were used as a positive control. To further verify ROS generation induced by GzmK, time-lapse microscopy was used to visualize ROS production at a single cell level. HeLa cells loaded with GzmK and Ad appeared to have strong fluorescence staining (Fig. 3C). GzmK, Ad alone, or mock treated cells were undetectable. For detection of ROS generation, one cell was chosen and photographed every 2 min, as depicted by the arrow. ROS began to produce early on and increased over time, which was consistent with the above observations by FACS. Blockade of ROS Production Inhibits GzmK-induced Cell Death—We next wanted to detect whether reagents that react with oxidative intermediates can decrease GzmK-induced ROS. The antioxidant NAC or superoxide scavenger sodium 4,5-dihydroxybenzene 1,3-disulfonate (Tiron) pretreatment inhibited GzmK-induced ROS accumulation (Fig. 4A). This is consistent with the observations of GzmA by Martinvalet et al. (15Martinvalet D. Zhu P. Lieberman J. Immunity. 2005; 22: 355-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Even high concentrations of NAC and Tiron we used were nontoxic as determined for each reagent through staining by Annexin V and propidium iodide (not shown). To further determine the consequence of ROS on cell death, Jurkat cells were preincubated with 4 mm NAC or 50 mm Tiron before being loading with GzmK by Ad, and cell death was analyzed by Annexin V or Hoechst staining. NAC treatment can inhibit GzmK-induced death (Annexin V+ cells: 22 ± 2% versus 54 ± 2.1%, p < 0.01; Hoechst staining: 25 ± 3.6% versus 70 ± 5.1%, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4B). Tiron treatment gave similar results (Annexin V+ cells: 22% ± 2% versus 54 ± 2.1%, p < 0.01; Hoechst staining: 25 ± 3.6% versus 70 ± 5.1%, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4C). Similar results were found for propidium iodide staining (data not shown). Six control groups were used: GzmK, Ad, NAC, Tiron alone, NAC plus Ad, or Tiron plus Ad. These groups resulted in comparable cell death. GzmK Directly Processes Bid to Produce Its Active Form tBid in Its Recombinant or Native Form of Lysates and Intact Cells—Bid is a BH3-only protein of the Bcl-2 family that plays an important role in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Undergoing apoptosis, Bid can be processed to a truncated Bid (tBid) that potently attacks the outer mitochondrial membrane to initiate release of cyt c and other proapoptotic factors (19Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3078) Google Scholar, 29Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Bid is processed by GzmK, 0.5 μm rBid was incubated with different concentrations of GzmK and probed by anti-Bid antibody. Bid began to degrade at 0.5 μm GzmK (Fig. 5A). The full-length Bid was completely processed at a high concentration of 2 μm GzmK. By 30 min, Bid started to degrade after GzmK treatment and was completely hydrolyzed within 4 h. Even with high concentration of 2 μm S-AGzmK, Bid was uncleaved. To assess whether GzmK degrades native Bid, Jurkat cell lysates (2 × 105 cell equivalents) were incubated with different doses of GzmK. Bid was degraded by GzmK in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5B). The same blot was stripped and probed with β-actin. β-Actin was unchanged as a negative control. After 2 h, Bid was dramatically degraded by 2 μm GzmK and almost completely processed by 4 h. Similar results were obtained in HeLa cells (data not shown). To further verify Bid processing is physiologically relevant, Jurkat cells were treated with 1 μm GzmK in the presence of PJ. Cytosolic Bid degradation occurred after 2 h (Fig. 5C). tBid production increased over time. The size of tBid produced by GzmK was similar to that processed by GzmB. Cells loaded with GzmB showed stronger enzymatic activity for Bid cleavage than GzmK. S-AGzmK was without effect. β-Actin was unchangeable at all time points as a loading control. GzmK Induces cyt c and EndoG Release in a Bid-dependent Way— cyt c release from mitochondria appears to be an early event during apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli (30Jiang X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar, 31Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4408) Google Scholar). Cytosolic cyt c, together with Apaf-1 and procaspase-9, in an ATP-dependent manner, forms apoptosome, which causes caspase activation that orchestrates the biochemical execution of cells (32Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6229) Google Scholar, 33Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2742) Google Scholar). EndoG is a proapoptotic DNase that is released from mitochondria and translocates to the nucleus where it damages chromatin DNA without caspase activation during apoptosis, which represents a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway initiated from the mitochondria (34Li L.Y. Luo X. Wang X. Nature. 2001; 412: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). We next wanted to investigate whether GzmK initiates the release of cyt c and other proapoptotic factors and whether these events are Bid-dependent. Murine liver mitochondria were isolated and treated with GzmK in the presence or absence of rBid at 37 °C for 30 min. In the presence of rBid, GzmK induced cyt c and EndoG release in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). Without rBid, even high concentration of 2 μm GzmK did not cause release of cyt c and EndoG. cyt c and EndoG release induced by GzmB also required rBid presence, which is consistent with previous reports (35Alimonti J.B. Shi L. Baijal P.K. Greenberg A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6974-6982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 36Heibein J.A. Goping I.S. Barry M. Pinkoski M.J. Shore G.C. Green D.R. Bleackley R.C. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). cyt c release by 0.5 μm GzmK treatment was comparable to that of the same molar GzmB, whereas EndoG release by 0.5 μm GzmB treatment was much higher than the same molar GzmK treatment. rBid alone did not cause the release of cyt c and other proapoptotic factors from mitochondria. These data are representative of at least three separate experiments. CoxIV, a matrix protein of mitochondria, was used for fractionation controls. CoxIV was not detectable in the supernatants. GzmK can induce SMAC and AIF, and the release of SMAC and AIF was also required for the presence of rBid (data not shown). These results were further confirmed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Fig. 6B). GzmK loading with PFP induced cyt c and EndoG release in HeLa cells. GzmK or PFP alone was without effect. GzmB plus PFP was used as a positive control. Similar results were found in GzmK-treated HeLa cells by delivery of PJ or Ad (data not shown). It has not been defined how GzmK functions in CTL- and NK-cell induced cytolysis. Shi et al. (8Shi L. Kraut R.P. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 37Shi L. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) showed that rat GzmK induces DNA fragmentation without nuclear morphological changes after GzmK loading with perforin and is considered as a slowing granzyme. The same group also demonstrated GzmK disrupts ΔΨ but does not initiate release of cyt c (10MacDonald G. Shi L. Vande Velde C. Lieberman J. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We previously showed that human GzmK induces rapid cell death without caspase activation (9Zhao T. Zhang H. Guo Y. Zhang Q. Hua G. Lu H. Hou Q. Liu H. Fan Z. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 14: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The features of death are characterized by rapid externalization of phosphatidylserine, nuclear morphological changes, and single-stranded DNA nicks, which are reminiscent of the alternate tryptase GzmA. Moreover, GzmK targets all three GzmA substrates of the SET complex, such as SET, Ape1/Ref-1, and HMG2, in the same proteolytic patterns as GzmA (9Zhao T. Zhang H. Guo Y. Zhang Q. Hua G. Lu H. Hou Q. Liu H. Fan Z. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 14: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Fan Z. Beresford P.J. Oh D.Y. Zhang D. Lieberman J. Cell. 2003; 112: 659-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 21Fan Z. Beresford P.J. Zhang D. Lieberman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2810-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Fan Z. Beresford P.J. Zhang D. Xu Z. Novina C.D. Yoshida A. Pommier Y. Lieberman J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). GzmK and -A are two tryptase among all the granzymes and linked together on the same chromosome of mice and humans. Therefore, GzmK might share redundancy with GzmA. The Lieberman group (15Martinvalet D. Zhu P. Lieberman J. Immunity. 2005; 22: 355-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) showed ROS is critical for the distinct caspase-independent cell death pathway triggered by GzmA. GzmA initiates mitochondrial damage with a rapid increase in ROS and loss of ΔΨ. GzmA does not cleave Bid or induce release of mitochondrial proapoptotic molecules. In this study we found GzmK can also provoke rapid ROS generation and collapse of ΔΨ. But GzmK directly cleaves Bid to generate its active form tBid that disrupts the outer mitochondrial membrane leading to the release of cyt c and EndoG that is different from GzmA. Mitochondria play a central role in both the caspase-dependent and -independent death pathway (30Jiang X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). They contain a number of proapoptotic proteins, such as cyt c, SMAC, high temperature-requirement protein A2, AIF, and EndoG, which are released into the cytosol undergoing apoptosis. The release of proapoptotic factors from mitochondria is due to the rupture of mitochondrial integrity. These events are initiated by the opening of the PTP (13Bernardi P. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Forte M. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 112-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Opening of PTP triggers an increase of inner membrane permeability to ions and solutes, followed by net water influx toward the mitochondrial matrix, swelling of the organelle, and physiological disruption of its outer membrane, with the consequent release of proteins to the intermembrane space. Increase of ROS and loss of ΔΨ are indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction, hallmarks of apoptotic mitochondrial damage (12Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4036) Google Scholar). It is postulated that ROS and ΔΨ collapse are early events in apoptosis that involve the opening by PTP of the inner mitochondrial membrane (10MacDonald G. Shi L. Vande Velde C. Lieberman J. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 38Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Marchetti P. Hirsch T. Gomez-Monterrey I. Castedo M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). We showed that GzmK triggers rapid ROS production and loss of ΔΨ. Our data suggest that GzmK damages the inner mitochondrial membrane thus resulting in mitochondrial solutes to the intermembrane space. Whether generation of ROS is critical to apoptosis or only a side effect of mitochondrial dysfunction has not been well defined. ROS induce the opening of PTP through oxidation-dependent mechanisms and are potent inducers of apoptosis (12Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4036) Google Scholar, 39Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lieberman's group (15Martinvalet D. Zhu P. Lieberman J. Immunity. 2005; 22: 355-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) showed that ROS is critical in GzmA-induced caspase-independent death. ROS generation induced by GzmA is not inhibited by Bcl-2 overexpression or by pan caspase inhibitors. We found that GzmK can initiate rapid ROS generation and confirmed this at a single cell level. Both the antioxidant NAC and the superoxide scavenger Tiron blocked ROS production, which protected cells from GzmK-induced death. By contrast, Martinvalet et al. (15Martinvalet D. Zhu P. Lieberman J. Immunity. 2005; 22: 355-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) reported that NAC is less effective than Tiron at neutralizing ROS and is unable to protect GzmA-induced death. We previously showed that GzmK can cleave Ape1/Ref-1 leading to disruption of its redox function as GzmA (9Zhao T. Zhang H. Guo Y. Zhang Q. Hua G. Lu H. Hou Q. Liu H. Fan Z. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 14: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Fan Z. Beresford P.J. Zhang D. Xu Z. Novina C.D. Yoshida A. Pommier Y. Lieberman J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). A primary function of Ape1/Ref-1 is maintaining reduced thiols and DNA binding of transcription factors, such as AP-1 and NF-κB. Ape1/Ref-1 can inhibit intracellular ROS accumulation. We found that GzmK can degrade tumor suppressor p53. 4T. Zhao, H. Zhang, Y. Guo, and Z. Fan, unpublished data. A recent study showed that p53 protects genome stability from oxidation by ROS (40Sablina A.A. Budanov A.V. Ilyinskaya G.V. Agapova L.S. Kravchenko J.E. Chumakov P.M. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1306-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of p53 results in excessive oxidation of DNA that is prevented by NAC treatment. Dietary supplementation with NAC prevents frequent lymphomas characteristic of p53-deficient mice. cyt c release from mitochondria has been defined as an important event in the activation of downstream caspases and apoptosis (31Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4408) Google Scholar). Once released to the cytosol, cyt c acts as a cofactor in conjunction with Apaf-1, procaspase 9, and ATP/dATP to form an active holoenzyme that processes and activates downstream caspase 3 (30Jiang X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar, 32Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X.

Translocation from the cytoplasm to mitochondria during apoptosis has been reported for Bid, Bax, Bak, Bad, and Bim (19Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

These proteins are inactive in the cytoplasm and are translocated to the mitochondria after a death signal. Following Fas ligation and recruitment of Fas-associated death domain to the trimeric receptor complex, caspase 8 is activated and then degrades cytosolic Bid to tBid, which translocates to mitochondria to cause the release of cyt c (19Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3078) Google Scholar). GzmB directly cleaves Bid to produce a 14-kDa GzmB-truncated Bid (called gtBid), which is different from caspase 8-truncated 15-kDa tBid (36Heibein J.A. Goping I.S. Barry M. Pinkoski M.J. Shore G.C. Green D.R. Bleackley R.C. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). gtBid recruits Bax to mitochondria through a caspase-independent mechanism where it is integrated into the mitochondrial membrane and initiates cyt c release. We showed here that Bid is processed by GzmK, which appears to have the same pattern as GzmB. GzmK-truncated Bid might mimic gtBid to recruit Bax leading to caspase-independent mechanism of mitochondrial damage, which is different from GzmA. Moreover, GzmK can induce the release of other proapoptotic molecules, including EndoG, SMAC, and AIF, which enhance GzmK-induced death. We thank L. Wang, Q. X. Zhang, Q. Hou, H. X. Lu, G. Q. Hua, W.

https://openalex.org/W2010245607,"p53 is a fundamental determinant of cancer susceptibility and other age-related pathologies. Similar to mammalian counterparts, Drosophila p53 integrates stress signals and elicits apoptotic responses that maintain genomic stability. To illuminate core-adaptive functions controlled by this gene family, we examined the Drosophila p53 regulatory network at a genomic scale. In development, the absence of p53 impacted constitutive expression for a surprisingly broad scope of genes. By contrast, stimulus-dependent responses governed by Drosophila p53 were limited in scope. The vast majority of stress responders were induced and p53 dependent (RIPD) genes. The signature set of 29 'high stringency' RIPD genes identified here were enriched for intronless loci, with a non-uniform distribution that includes a recently evolved cluster unique to Drosophila melanogaster. Two RIPD genes, with known and unknown biochemical activities, were functionally examined. One RIPD gene, designated XRP1, maintains genome stability after genotoxic challenge and prevents cell proliferation upon induced expression. A second gene, RnrL, is an apoptogenic effector required for caspase activation in a model of p53-dependent killing. Together, these studies identify ancient and convergent features of the p53 regulatory network."
https://openalex.org/W2073179267,"Overexpression of the adaptor/scaffolding protein Gab2 has been detected in primary human breast cancer cells and cell lines, although its functional significance in breast carcinogenesis is not fully understood. Here, we show a requirement for Gab2 in promoting mammary tumor metastasis. Although Gab2 expression levels were elevated in mammary tumors induced by the Neu (ErbB-2) oncogene, homozygous deletion of Gab2 in mice had only a modest effect on the initiation of Neu-induced mammary tumors. Notably, ablation of Gab2 severely suppressed lung metastasis. Gab2-deficient cancer cells displayed normal Akt activities, and their proliferative rate in vitro was similar to control cells. However, Gab2(-/-) cancer cells exhibited decreased migration and impaired Erk activation, and the defects were rescued by re-introduction of Gab2 into Gab2(-/-) cells. These findings suggest that although Gab2 overexpression may confer growth advantage to tumor cells, the functional requirement for Gab2 in mammary tumor initiation/growth may be dispensable, and that Gab2 may have a prominent role in promoting mammary tumor metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2108358725,"Calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and the receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) comprise a receptor for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Although CGRP induces endocytosis of CLR/RAMP1, little is known about post-endocytic sorting of these proteins. We observed that the duration of stimulation with CGRP markedly affected post-endocytic sorting of CLR/RAMP1. In HEK and SK-N-MC cells, transient stimulation (10-7 m CGRP, 1 h), induced CLR/RAMP1 recycling with similar kinetics (2-6 h), demonstrated by labeling receptors in living cells with antibodies to extracellular epitopes. Recycling of CLR/RAMP1 correlated with resensitization of CGRP-induced increases in [Ca2+]i. Cycloheximide did not affect resensitization, but bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPases, abolished resensitization. Recycling CLR and RAMP1 were detected in endosomes containing Rab4a and Rab11a, and expression of GTPase-defective Rab4aS22N and Rab11aS25N inhibited resensitization. After sustained stimulation (10-7 m CGRP, >2 h), CLR/RAMP1 trafficked to lysosomes. RAMP1 was degraded ∼4-fold more rapidly than CLR (RAMP1, 45% degradation, 5 h; CLR, 54% degradation, 16 h), determined by Western blotting. Inhibitors of lysosomal, but not proteasomal, proteases prevented degradation. Sustained stimulation did not induce detectable mono- or polyubiquitination of CLR or RAMP1, determined by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Moreover, a RAMP1 mutant lacking the only intracellular lysine (RAMP1K142R) internalized and was degraded normally. Thus, after transient stimulation with CGRP, CLR and RAMP1 traffic from endosomes to the plasma membrane, which mediates resensitization. After sustained stimulation, CLR and RAMP1 traffic from endosomes to lysosomes by ubiquitin-independent mechanisms, where they are degraded at different rates. Calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and the receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) comprise a receptor for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Although CGRP induces endocytosis of CLR/RAMP1, little is known about post-endocytic sorting of these proteins. We observed that the duration of stimulation with CGRP markedly affected post-endocytic sorting of CLR/RAMP1. In HEK and SK-N-MC cells, transient stimulation (10-7 m CGRP, 1 h), induced CLR/RAMP1 recycling with similar kinetics (2-6 h), demonstrated by labeling receptors in living cells with antibodies to extracellular epitopes. Recycling of CLR/RAMP1 correlated with resensitization of CGRP-induced increases in [Ca2+]i. Cycloheximide did not affect resensitization, but bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPases, abolished resensitization. Recycling CLR and RAMP1 were detected in endosomes containing Rab4a and Rab11a, and expression of GTPase-defective Rab4aS22N and Rab11aS25N inhibited resensitization. After sustained stimulation (10-7 m CGRP, >2 h), CLR/RAMP1 trafficked to lysosomes. RAMP1 was degraded ∼4-fold more rapidly than CLR (RAMP1, 45% degradation, 5 h; CLR, 54% degradation, 16 h), determined by Western blotting. Inhibitors of lysosomal, but not proteasomal, proteases prevented degradation. Sustained stimulation did not induce detectable mono- or polyubiquitination of CLR or RAMP1, determined by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Moreover, a RAMP1 mutant lacking the only intracellular lysine (RAMP1K142R) internalized and was degraded normally. Thus, after transient stimulation with CGRP, CLR and RAMP1 traffic from endosomes to the plasma membrane, which mediates resensitization. After sustained stimulation, CLR and RAMP1 traffic from endosomes to lysosomes by ubiquitin-independent mechanisms, where they are degraded at different rates. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) 2The abbreviations used are: CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; CLR, calcitonin receptor-like receptor; RAMP1, receptor activity-modifying protein; NK1R, neurokinin 1 receptor; β2AR, β2 adrenergic receptor; PAR2, protease-activated receptor 2; LAMP1, lysosomal-associated glycomembrane protein 1; EEA1, early endosomal antigen 1; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein.2The abbreviations used are: CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; CLR, calcitonin receptor-like receptor; RAMP1, receptor activity-modifying protein; NK1R, neurokinin 1 receptor; β2AR, β2 adrenergic receptor; PAR2, protease-activated receptor 2; LAMP1, lysosomal-associated glycomembrane protein 1; EEA1, early endosomal antigen 1; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein. belongs to the calcitonin family of regulatory peptides and is produced by tissue-specific alternate splicing of transcripts from the calcitonin gene (1Amara S.G. Jonas V. Rosenfeld M.G. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Nature. 1982; 298: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). CGRP is a potent vasodilator and mediator of neurogenic inflammation and pain transmission (2van Rossum D. Hanisch U.K. Quirion R. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1997; 21: 649-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 3Brain S.D. Grant A.D. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 903-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Notably, CGRP has a causative role in migraine headaches and is thus a mediator of human disease (4Olesen J. Diener H.C. Husstedt I.W. Goadsby P.J. Hall D. Meier U. Pollentier S. Lesko L.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). In view of the importance of CGRP in health and disease, it is of interest to understand the mechanisms that control cellular responses to this peptide. Unusually for neuropeptides, the CGRP receptor is a heterodimer composed of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1). CLR is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that shares 55% amino acid sequence identity with the calcitonin receptor (5Njuki F. Nicholl C.G. Howard A. Mak J.C. Barnes P.J. Girgis S.I. Legon S. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1993; 85: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), whereas RAMP1, RAMP2, and RAMP3 are single transmembrane proteins with ∼30% identity (6McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar). CLR functions as either a CGRP receptor, when coexpressed with RAMP1, or an adrenomedullin receptor, when coexpressed with RAMP2 or -3 (6McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar); the extracellular domain of the RAMP imparts this specificity (7Kuwasako K.

Thus, RAMP1 is also a chaperone that targets CLR to the plasma membrane. However, it remains to be determined if CLR and RAMP1 are invariably associated after receptor activation. Upon activation with CGRP, CLR, but not RAMP1, is phosphorylated and interacts with β-arrestins (12Hilairet S. Belanger C. Bertrand J. Laperriere A. Foord S.M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42182-42190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). β-Arrestins are adapters for clathrin and AP2, and the CLR, RAMP1, and β-arrestin complex undergoes dynamin-dependent endocytosis in clathrin-coated pits by well defined mechanisms (11Kuwasako K. Shimekake Y. Masuda M. Nakahara K. Yoshida T. Kitaura M. Kitamura K. Eto T. Sakata T. J. Biol.

However, little is known about the mechanisms of post-endocytic sorting of GPCRs, such as CLR, or accessory proteins, such as RAMP1, to degradative or recycling pathways. It is important to understand the post-endocytic sorting of CLR and RAMP1, because recycling may permit rapid resensitization of CGRP signaling, whereas degradation would prevent sustained, uncontrolled CGRP signaling during conditions of sustained peptide release. β-Arrestins can influence the rate of recycling of GPCRs. “Class A” receptors (e.g. β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR), μ-opioid receptor, neurokinin 3 receptor) form low affinity and transient interactions with β-arrestin2 and rapidly recycle (13Oakley R.H.

Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C945-C958Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Activated CLR colocalizes with β-arrestin2 and β-arrestin1 for prolonged periods (12Hilairet S. Belanger C. Bertrand J. Laperriere A. Foord S.M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42182-42190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). 3N. W. Bunnett, unpublished observation.3N. W. Bunnett, unpublished observation. Thus, CLR may belong to the class B family of slowly recycling GPCRs. However, it is not known whether CLR and RAMP1 can recycle. Addition of ubiquitin molecules to intracellular lysine residues targets some GPCRs to degradative pathways (e.g. β2AR, chemokine (CXC motif) receptor 4, protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), and NK1R) (15Shenoy S.K.

However, other GPCRs traffic to lysosomes by ubiquitin-independent processes (e.g. δ-opioid receptor) (20Tanowitz M. Von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

Thus, after transient stimulation with low concentrations of substance P, the NK1R is not ubiquitinated and rapidly recycles and resensitizes (19Cottrell G.S. Padilla B. Pikios S. Roosterman D.

It remains to be determined if the duration of stimulation with CGRP affects the post-endocytic sorting of CLR and RAMP1 to recycling or degradative pathways. We investigated the pathway and mechanism of post-endocytic trafficking of CLR and RAMP1 and determined the importance of this trafficking to the control of CGRP signaling. Our aims were as follows: (a) to determine whether transient stimulation with CGRP induces post-endocytic sorting of CLR and RAMP1 to recycling pathways; (b) to define the role of recycling in resensitization of CGRP signaling; (c) to determine whether sustained stimulation with CGRP induces post-endocytic sorting of CLR and RAMP1 to degradative pathways; and (d) to investigate whether trafficking to degradative pathways involves ubiquitination of CLR and RAMP1. Reagents—Rabbit antibodies to the C terminus of rat CLR (RK11) and human RAMP1 (9891) have been described previously (24Cottrell G.S. Roosterman D. Marvizon J.C. Song B. Wick E. Pikios S. Wong H. Berthelier C. Tang Y. Sternini C. Bunnett N.W. Grady E.F. J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 490: 239-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Sources of other antibodies were: rat high affinity anti-HA (Roche Applied Science); rabbit anti-Myc and mouse anti-β-actin (A-5441, Sigma); goat anti-Myc (A-14) and mouse anti-ubiquitin (P4D1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); mouse anti-human lysosomal-associated glycomembrane protein 1 (LAMP1, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA); mouse anti-early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1, BD Transduction Laboratories); goat or donkey anti-mouse, rat, or rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine red-X, or Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA); and goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG coupled to AlexaFluor® 680 (Invitrogen) and coupled to IRDye™ 800 (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA). Rat α-CGRP was from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Vector Construction—cDNAs encoding rat CLR with an extracellular, N-terminal HA epitope, and rat RAMP1 with an extracellular, N-terminal Myc epitope have been described before (24Cottrell G.S. Roosterman D. Marvizon J.C. Song B. Wick E. Pikios S. Wong H. Berthelier C. Tang Y. Sternini C. Bunnett N.W. Grady E.F. J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 490: 239-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). CLR was subcloned into pcDNA5/FRT to yield pcDNA5/FRT-rCLR. To create a vector that expressed CLR and RAMP1, RAMP1 was amplified by PCR together with a cytomegalovirus promoter and bovine growth hormone poly(A) tail and subcloned into the BsmI and BstZ17I sites of pcDNA5/FRT-rCLR. A rat RAMP1 mutant in which the lysine (Lys-142) was mutated to arginine (designated RAMP1K142R) was generated by PCR (forward primer, 5′-cgcaaatgggcggtaggcgtg-3′; reverse primer, 5′-atgcggccgcctacacgatgccctctgtgcgcctgctcctcc-3′) using standard techniques and subcloned into pcDNA5/FRT-rCLR. Constructs were sequenced to verify integrity. Other primer sequences are available on request. cDNAs encoding GFP-tagged Rab4a, Rab11a, and GTPase-defective Rab4aS22N and Rab11aS25N have been described (23Roosterman D. Cottrell G.S. Schmidlin F. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30670-30679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Transfected Cells and Cell Lines—The generation and maintenance of human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK) FLP cells (Invitrogen) stably expressing rat CLR and rat RAMP1 have been described (24Cottrell G.S. Roosterman D. Marvizon J.C. Song B. Wick E. Pikios S. Wong H. Berthelier C. Tang Y. Sternini C. Bunnett N.W. Grady E.F. J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 490: 239-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). HEKFLP cells stably expressing CLR and RAMP1 from the same vector (pcDNA5/FRT) or rat NK1R were created with the Flp-In™ system according to the manufacturer's guidelines, and cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. In some experiments, cells were transiently transfected with CLR, RAMP1, Rab4a, Rab4aS22N, Rab11a, or Rab11aS25N using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-MC was from American Tissue Type Collection (Manassas, VA). SK-N-MC cells were transiently transfected with CLR and RAMP1 and grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with non-essential amino acids and 10% HIFBS. All cells were routinely grown in 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. In control experiments, cells were transfected with vectors without inserts. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—Cells were incubated with 2.5 μm fura-2AM (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37 °C and washed. Fluorescence was measured at 340 and 380 nm excitation and 510 nm emission in an F-2500 spectrophotometer (Hitachi Instruments, Irvine, CA). The ratio of the fluorescence at the two excitation wavelengths, which is proportional to [Ca2+]i, was calculated, and results are expressed as increase above basal values. To assess desensitization and resensitization, cells were challenged with CGRP (10-7 m, 1 h) or vehicle (control) and washed, and [Ca2+] was determined after a second challenge with CGRP (3 × 10-8 m). Immunofluorescence—Cells were plated at 3 × 105 cells per 35-mm dish, onto coverslips were coated with poly-d-lysine (100 μg/ml). To localize CLR and RAMP1, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm PBS, pH 7.4 (20 min at 4 °C), and washed for 15 min with 1× PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 1% normal goat serum or 2% normal donkey serum. Proteins were localized using primary antibodies: CLR (RK11, 1:4000), RAMP1 (9891, 1:2000 or goat anti-Myc, 1:100), LAMP1 (1:1000), and EEA1 (1:500) (overnight, 4 °C). Cells were washed for 15 min with 1× PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 1% normal goat serum or 2% normal donkey serum and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine red-X, or Cy5 (1:200, 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C). Trafficking of Antibody-tagged Receptors—To label CLR and RAMP1 at the cell surface, living cells were incubated with rat anti-HA (to detect CLR; 1:100) and rabbit or goat anti-Myc (to detect RAMP1; 1:100) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ and stimulated with CGRP. Cells were fixed at specified times, washed, and incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Confocal Microscopy—Cells were observed by using Zeiss Axiovert, 510Meta, and Bio-Rad MRC1000 confocal microscopes with a Plan Apo ×100 (numerical aperture 1.3 or 1.4) objective. Images were collected at zooms of 1-2 and an iris of <3 μm, and typically 5-10 optical sections were taken at intervals of 0.5 μm. Images (single optical sections are shown) were colored and processed to adjust contrast and brightness using Adobe Photoshop CS (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, boiled, and centrifuged. Lysates (5-10 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE (CLR, 8 or 9%; RAMP1, 15% acrylamide gels). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P or FL, Millipore, Billerica, MA) and blocked for 1 h at room temperature (1x PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin, 5% milk powder, 0.1% Tween 20, or Odyssey Blocking Buffer). Membranes were incubated with antibodies to rat CLR (RK11, 1:10,000), rat RAMP1 (9891, 1:5,000), β-actin (1:20,000), or ubiquitin P4D1 (1:1,000) overnight at 4 °C (1× PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin, 5% milk powder, 0.1% Tween 20, or Odyssey Blocking Buffer). Membranes were washed for 30 min (1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000, 1 h, room temperature). Membranes were washed for 30 min, and immunoreactive proteins were detected by using chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate, Pierce). Alternatively, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to AlexaFluor® 680 or IRDye™ 800 (1:10-20,000, 1 h, room temperature), and blots were analyzed with the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were plated at 1.5 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish and used after 48 h. After treatments, cells were washed with PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+, lysed with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40), and centrifuged (10 min, 15,000 g, room temperature). Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes, and immunoprecipitating antibodies were added (CLR: rat anti-HA, 500 ng; RAMP1: rabbit anti-Myc, 2 μg). Samples were rotated for 16 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G Plus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added (30 μl), and samples were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were pelleted, washed three times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay, boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. For denaturing immunoprecipitation (NK1R), cells were lysed in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, sonicated, and mixed with 4 volumes of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40). The lysate was mixed by pipetting, and a radioimmune precipitation assay was added to 1-ml final volume and centrifuged (16,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). Supernatants were rotated with antibody (FLAG M2, 3.5 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C, and samples were processed as described above. Activation of CLR and RAMP1 and Drug Treatments—Two days after plating cells or after transfection, cells were washed three times with PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ and placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were stimulated with 10-7 m rat α-CGRP, unless otherwise stated. To inhibit new protein synthesis, cells were treated with cycloheximide (140 μm, Sigma). To inhibit vacuolar-type H+-ATPases, cells were treated with bafilomycin A1 (1 μm, A. G. Scientific, San Diego, CA). These inhibitors were preincubated with cells 1 h prior to stimulation with CGRP and were present throughout stimulation and recovery phases of the experiments. Lysosomal proteases were inhibited using ZPAD, E64d (Bachem, 200 μm and 20 μm, respectively) and pepstatin A (Roche Applied Science, 10 μm). The proteolytic activity of the proteasome was inhibited using epoxomicin (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA; 10 μm). Controls included appropriate vehicle. Densitometry—Signals on Western blots were quantified using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-COR Biosciences), or blots were digitized using an Epson Perfection 3200 PHOTO scanner and analyzed by densitometry with National Institutes of Health Image 1.63. To quantify CLR and RAMP1 degradation, signals were compared with β-actin signals. Statistics—Data are presented as the mean and standard error of ≥ 3 experiments. Results are compared by Student's t test or analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Kuel's test, with *, p < 0.05 considered significant. CLR and RAMP1 Traffic to Early Endosomes and Lysosomes—To examine the effects of CGRP on trafficking of CLR and RAMP1, we incubated HEK cells stably expressing CLR and RAMP1 (HEK-CLR-RAMP1 cells) with CGRP (10-7 m) for 0-120 min; we localized CLR, RAMP1 (using antibodies RK11 and 9891, to the C terminus of CLR and RAMP1, respectively), EEA1 and LAMP1 by indirect immunofluorescence. In unstimulated cells, CLR and RAMP1 were at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, A and B, arrowheads). After 10 min with CGRP, CLR and RAMP1 were depleted from the plasma membrane and were colocalized with EEA1 in early endosomes (Fig. 1, A and B, white arrows). CLR and RAMP1 were prominently localized to early endosomes at 30 and 60 min (not shown). After 120 min with CGRP, CLR and RAMP1 were sometimes colocalized with EEA1 (Fig. 1, A and B, white arrows) but were also detected in vesicles that did not contain EEA1 (Fig. 1, A and B, yellow arrows). These vesicles were lysosomes, because at 120 min CLR and RAMP1 were prominently colocalized with LAMP1 (Fig. 1, C and D, white arrows). However, CLR and RAMP1 were also detected in some vesicles that did not contain LAMP1 and are probably early endosomes (Fig. 1, C and D, yellow arrows). At earlier times (e.g. 60 min), CLR and LAMP1 were rarely detected in lysosomes (not shown). These results show that activated CLR and RAMP1 traffic from the plasma membrane to early endosomes and lysosomes, which is consistent with other reports of CLR and RAMP1 trafficking (11Kuwasako K. Shimekake Y. Masuda M. Nakahara K. Yoshida T. Kitaura M. Kitamura K. Eto T. Sakata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29602-29609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). At early times (10-60 min), the receptors are most prominently in early endosomes. At later times (120 min), the receptors are more prominently sorted to lysosomes. However, even after sustained activation, lysosomal sorting is incomplete and some receptors are retained in early endosomes. We therefore examined whether CLR and RAMP1 can recycle from early endosomes after transient stimulation with CGRP. CLR and RAMP1 Recycle after Transient Stimulation with CGRP—Although continuous stimulation of cells with high concentrations of CGRP induces trafficking of CLR and RAMP1 to lysosomes (11Kuwasako K. Shimekake Y. Masuda M. Nakahara K. Yoshida T. Kitaura M. Kitamura K. Eto T. Sakata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29602-29609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), many GPCRs efficiently recycle, especially after brief stimulation with agonist (22Garland A.M.

We examined CLR and RAMP1 recycling in cycloheximide-treated HEK-CLR-RAMP1 cells, to avoid synthesis of new receptors, which would also traffic to the plasma membrane. Cells were incubated with CGRP for 1 h to induce trafficking of both proteins to early endosomes. Cells were washed and incubated in CGRP-free medium for 0-6 h, to allow recycling. CLR and RAMP1 were simultaneously detected by indirect immunofluorescence using a rabbit antibody the C terminus of CLR (RK11), and a goat antibody to an N-terminal Myc epitope of RAMP1. In unstimulated cells, CLR and RAMP1 colocalized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A, arrowheads). After 1 h with CGRP, CLR and RAMP1 were depleted from the plasma membrane and were colocalized in vesicles (Fig. 2A, arrows). These vesicles colocalized with EEA1 and are thus early endosomes (not shown). At 2 h after washing and recovery in agonist-free medium, CLR and RAMP1 were present in some endosomes but were also detected at the plasma membrane, and both proteins were almost exclusively colocalized at the plasma membrane after 6-h recovery (Fig. 2A, arrowheads). The reappearance of CLR and RAMP1 at the plasma membrane of cycloheximide-treated cells suggests that these proteins can recycle. However, mobilization of CLR and RAMP1 from intracellular stores could also account for the reappearance of CLR and RAMP1 at the plasma membrane. To exclude this possibility, we examined trafficking of CLR and RAMP1 that were tagged at the cell surface using antibodies to extracellular epitopes. To label surface receptors, living HEK-CLR-RAMP1 cells were simultaneously incubated with antibodies to the extracellular epitop"

https://openalex.org/W2084401477,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key players in cell communication. Several classes of such receptors have been identified. Although all GPCRs possess a heptahelical domain directly activating G proteins, important structural and sequence differences within receptors from different classes suggested distinct activation mechanisms. Here we show that highly conserved charged residues likely involved in an interaction network between transmembrane domains (TM) 3 and 6 at the cytoplasmic side of class C GPCRs are critical for activation of the γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptor. Indeed, the loss of function resulting from the mutation of the conserved lysine residue into aspartate or glutamate in the TM3 of γ-aminobutyric acid type B2 can be partly rescued by mutating the conserved acidic residue of TM6 into either lysine or arginine. In addition, mutation of the conserved lysine into an acidic residue leads to a nonfunctional receptor that displays a high agonist affinity. This is reminiscent of a similar ionic network that constitutes a lock stabilizing the inactive state of many class A rhodopsin-like GPCRs. These data reveal that despite their original structure, class C GPCRs share with class A receptors at least some common structural feature controlling G protein activation.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptors; TM, transmembrane; HD, heptahelical domain; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GABAB, γ-aminobutyric acid, type B; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemag-glutinin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; mGlu, metabotropic Glu. are encoded by one of the most important gene families in mammalian genomes (1Bockaert J. Claeysen S. Becamel C. Pinloche S. Dumuis A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 212: 63-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These membrane proteins play a critical role in transducing extracellular signals into the cell and constitute the major target for drug development. Although they are important molecules, little is known about their activation mechanism (2Karnik S.S. Gogonea C. Patil S. Saad Y. Takezako T. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 431-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 3Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). All these receptors possess a heptahelical domain (HD), the structure of which has been solved for rhodopsin only (4Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar). This available structure is in a fully inactive state, as it is stabilized by the covalently linked inverse agonist cis-retinal. Thus, our actual knowledge on the active conformation relies mostly on functional and biophysical analysis of a variety of mutated receptors and their coupling to G proteins and their effectors (2Karnik S.S. Gogonea C. Patil S. Saad Y. Takezako T. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 431-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 3Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Four main classes of GPCRs have been defined in mammals based on sequence analysis (1Bockaert J. Claeysen S. Becamel C. Pinloche S. Dumuis A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 212: 63-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 5Fredriksson R. Lagerstrom M.C. Lundin L.G. Schioth H.B. Mol.

Rev. 2005; 57: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), with the rhodopsin-like class A receptors being the largest and the most studied. Class A receptor activation is associated with a movement of TM6 relative to TM3, leading to the opening of a cavity between the intracellular loops 2 and 3 connecting TM3 to TM4 and TM5 to TM6, respectively (2Karnik S.S. Gogonea C. Patil S. Saad Y. Takezako T. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 431-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 7Lu Z.L. Saldanha J.W. Hulme E.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 140-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The inactive state is stabilized by a network of interactions between residues at the cytoplasmic end of the TMs (4Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar). This network includes ionic interactions that involve the highly conserved class A residues (D/E)RY at the cytoplasmic end of TM3. In many class A GPCRs, the Arg of the (D/E)RY motif makes an ionic interaction with a conserved acidic residue (D/E) of TM6 (3Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Mutation of these residues leads either to a loss or a gain of function, consistent with this motif being involved in a lock that can control the conformational state of class A GPCRs (3Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 8Flanagan C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Perez D.M. Karnik S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the Arg of the (D/E)RY motif has also been proposed to play a direct role in receptor G protein interaction and activation for some class A receptors (8Flanagan C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The (D/E)RY motif is not found in the GPCRs from the other classes. This is the case for the class C receptors that are activated by the two main neurotransmitters, glutamate and γ-aminobutyrate (GABA), by Ca2+ ions, taste compounds, and pheromones (10Pin J.-P. Galvez T. Prezeau L. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 325-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The sequence divergence between the HDs of class A and class C GPCRs questioned whether both get activated the same way. In addition, class C receptor general functioning appears quite different from that of class A receptors despite their likely common dimeric organization (11Pin J.P. Kniazeff J. Goudet C. Bessis A.S. Liu J. Galvez T. Acher F. Rondard P. Prezeau L. Biol. Cell. 2004; 96: 335-342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although conformational changes within the HD of class A GPCRs is regarded as the main step in receptor activation, activation of class C receptors is assumed to result from a change in the relative position of the subunits in the dimer. Indeed, the crystal structure of the large dimeric extracellular domain of mGlu1, with and without bound agonist, revealed a major change in their relative position resulting from agonist binding (12Pin J.P. Kniazeff J. Liu J. Binet V. Goudet C. Rondard P. Prezeau L. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2947-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Moreover, fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis in living cells with cyan fluorescent protein and yellow fluorescent protein fused at various places in the intracellular segments of each of the subunits is consistent with a relative movement of the HDs during class C receptor dimer activation (13Tateyama M. Abe H. Nakata H. Saito O. Kubo Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, a number of modeling and mutagenesis studies are consistent with the HDs of class C GPCRs being structurally similar to rhodopsin (10Pin J.-P. Galvez T. Prezeau L. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 325-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 14Pagano A. Ruegg D. Litschig S. Stoehr N. Stierlin C. Heinrich M. Floersheim P. Prezeau L. Carroll F. Pin J.P. Cambria A.

Thus, besides the putative movement between the HDs (13Tateyama M. Abe H. Nakata H. Saito O. Kubo Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), a change in the conformation of the HDs themselves is likely also involved, as indicated by the effect of allosteric regulators interacting directly in the HD (15Goudet C. Gaven F. Kniazeff J. Vol C. Liu J. Cohen-Gonsaud M. Acher F. Prezeau L. Pin J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 16Goudet C. Binet V.

But are any of the structural requirements involved in such a conformational change similar in both class A and class C GPCRs? In this study, we aimed at identifying key residues involved in the activation of class C GPCRs. Using the GABAB receptor as a model system, we thus examined the functional consequences resulting from the mutation of such residues. This leads us to the observation that a network of interactions involving TM3 and TM6 plays a critical role in the activation process, illustrating some similarity in the structural determinants controlling G protein activation by class A and class C GPCRs. Materials—GABA was purchased from Sigma. [3H]CGP54626, purchased from Tocris (Bristol, UK), had a specific activity of 40 Ci·mmol-1. CGP54626 was purchased from Tocris (Fisher-Bioblock, Illkrich, France). Fetal bovine serum, culture media, and other solutions used for cell culture were from Invitrogen. [3H]Myoinositol (23.4 Ci/mol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other reagents used were of molecular or analytical grade where appropriate. Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The plasmids encoding the wild-type and chimeric GABAB1a and GABAB2 subunits epitope-tagged at their N-terminal ends (pRK-GABAB1a-HA, pRK-GABAB2-cMyc), under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter, were described previously (19Pagano A.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a pRK-GABAB1a-HA or a pRK-GABAB2-cMyc vector using a QuikChange® strategy (Stratagene). Briefly, the mutations were generated by using two complementary 30- to 40-mer oligonucleotides designed to contain the desired mutation, and the sequence of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Genome Express, France). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected by electroporation as described elsewhere (17Binet V. Brajon C. Le Corre L. Acher F. Pin J.P. Prezeau L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29085-29091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, 107 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA containing the coding sequence of the receptor subunits and completed to a total amount of 10 μg of plasmid DNA with pRK6 plasmid. For determination of inositol phosphate accumulation, the cells were also tranfected with the chimeric Gαqi9 G protein, which allows the coupling of the recombinant heteromeric GABAB receptor to phospholipase C (20Galvez T.

Measurement of Inositol Phosphate Production—Determination of inositol phosphate (InP) accumulation in transfected cells was performed in 96-well plates (0.2 × 106 cells/well) after overnight labeling with [3H]myoinositols (0.5 μCi/well) as already described (21Liu J.

The stimulation was conducted for 30 min in a medium containing 10 mm LiCl and the indicated concentration of agonist or antagonist. The reaction was stopped by replacing the medium by 0.1 m formic acid. Supernatants were recovered, and InPs were purified by ion exchange chromatography using Dowex AG1-X8 resin (Bio-Rad) in 96-well filter plates (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Total radioactivity remaining in the membrane fractions was counted after treatment of cells with a solution containing 10% Triton X-100 and 0.1 n NaOH. Radioactivity was quantified using Wallac 1450 MicroBeta liquid scintillation counter. Data were expressed as the amount of total InPs produced over the amount of radioactivity remaining in the membranes plus the produced InP, multiplied by 100. Unless stated otherwise, all data are means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. The dose-response curves were fitted using the Graph-Pad (San Diego) PRISM software and the following equation: y = ((ymax - ymin)/(1 + (x/EC50)nH)) + ymin, where the EC50 is the concentration of the compound necessary to obtain 50% of the maximal effect, and nH is the Hill coefficient. Anti-HA Tag ELISA for Quantification of Cell Surface Expression—Twenty four hours after transfection (107 cells, HA-tagged GABAB1 (2 μg) and c-Myc-tagged GABAB2 (2 μg) subunits), cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then blocked with phosphate-buffered saline + 5% fetal bovine serum. After a 30-min reaction with primary antibody (monoclonal anti-HA clone 3F10 (Roche Applied Science) at 0.5 μg/ml) in the same buffer, the goat anti-rat antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) was applied for 30 min at 1 μg/ml. After intense washes with phosphate-buffered saline, secondary antibody was detected and quantified instantaneously by chemiluminescence using Supersignalp® ELISA femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce) and a Wallac Victor 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptors; TM, transmembrane; HD, heptahelical domain; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GABAB, γ-aminobutyric acid, type B; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemag-glutinin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; mGlu, metabotropic Glu. luminescence counter. Ligand Binding on Intact HEK293 Cells—Ligand binding experiments were performed on intact HEK293 cells. The cells were plated after electroporation the day before the experiment. Thus, the cells on ice were washed with ice-cold binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 118 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2) and incubated in the presence of 1.5 nm [3H]CGP54626 with or without unlabeled ligand at the indicated concentration. The incubation was terminated by washing with ice-cold binding buffer. The cells were disrupted with 0.1 nm NaOH (400 μl), and the bound radioactivity was counted in a scintillation beta counter. Displacement curves were fitted with the GraphPad (San Diego) PRISM software, using the equation y = ((ymax - ymin)/(1 + (x/EC50)nH) + ymin, where EC50 is the concentration of cold drug necessary to displace half of the specially bound [3H]CGP54626, and nH is the Hill number. Structural Biology—Sequence alignment of class C receptors was performed using ClustalW (22Higgins D. Thompson J. Gibson T. Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; : 4673-4680PubMed Google Scholar) and refined manually. Fold compatibility for truncated sequences corresponding to the HD of various class C receptors was searched using the meta-server @TOME (23 and references therein). Sequence-structure alignments, including various class C receptors and the crystal structures of rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank codes 1LH9, 1U19, and 1GZM (4Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T.

Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2004; 20: 3694-3696Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Models of various receptors (mainly mGluRs, T1R2, T1R3, GABAB1, and GABAB2) were performed using SCWRL3.0 (27Canutescu A. Shelenkov A. Dunbrack R.J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2001-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar) and MODELLER7.7 (28Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10548) Google Scholar). In the absence of tools for structure evaluation of modeled membrane proteins, several rounds of alignment refinement/molecular modeling were performed. Visual inspection of the localization of hydrophobic and/or conserved residues relative to the membrane interface and protein core was performed for each TM helix and then for the whole HD. Strict conservation was computed for each subfamily of class C receptors (e.g. GABAB2) or for the whole superfamily using ViTO. Final three-dimensional models were built for using MODELLER 7.7 with the loop optimization procedure. Identification of Conserved Residues at the Cytoplasmic Ends of TM3 and TM6 of Class C GPCRs—Alignment of the sequences of class C receptor HDs revealed several highly conserved residues. Among these are two basic residues located at the cytoplasmic side of TM3, at positions close to that of the (D/E)RY motif in class A receptors (Fig. 1). A second highly conserved position is that of an acidic residue of the cytoplasmic end of TM6 (Fig. 1). To get some possible information on the functional role of these conserved charged residues, three-dimensional models of class C HDs were generated based on rhodopsin structure. A fold recognition approach using the meta-server @TOME confirmed the expected compatibility of sequences from class C receptors with the seven-helix bundle of rhodopsin and provided us with a structural alignment. However, because of the rather low level of sequence identity (∼12%), this alignment needed to be refined and critically assessed. The alignment was refined taking into account the following: first the position of the highly conserved residues, considering these are likely buried in the core structure (Fig. 2A); second, the position of the hydrophobic residues likely exposed to the plasma membrane; and third, amino acid hydrophobicity was also used to delimitate helix termini, and large sequence variation (in length and amino acid composition) was clustered in loops. The refinement of the combined alignment was performed by several rounds of manual editing, molecular modeling, and structure analysis using the program ViTO on the @TOME meta-server. This strategy was first applied locally, i.e. on each TM separately, and then validated on the full model. As illustrated with the GABAB2 HD (Fig. 2), the final models obtained for various class C GPCR HDs revealed consistencies with a rhodopsin-like structure. For example, TM1 showed only a thin patch of conserved residues in agreement with its thin interhelical surface. Also in agreement with TM3 being mostly buried in the core structure, this helix showed the same bias in amino acid composition (enrichment in Ser, Thr, Gly, and Ala) in class A and class C GPCRs. Moreover, the conserved disulfide bridge that links TM3 to TM5 in class A receptor is predicted to be present in class C GPCRs. The final model obtained is in agreement with those already reported (14Pagano A. Ruegg D. Litschig S. Stoehr N. Stierlin C. Heinrich M. Floersheim P. Prezeau L. Carroll F. Pin J.P. Cambria A.

These models were validated by directed mutagenesis of allosteric ligand putative binding sites. Indeed, the HD of class C receptors contains a binding site for allosteric modulators at positions similar to that of the binding site of small ligands interacting with class A receptors (14Pagano A.

We further checked that our structural alignment is compatible with these additional restraints by building models for the corresponding receptors (especially GABAB2, mGluR1, mGluR5, CaSR, and T1R3) and assessing the positions of the residues proposed to line the binding pocket (data not shown). Using this alignment and the GABAB2 model, we examined the predicted position of the highly conserved residues identified at the cytoplasmic face of TM3 and TM6 of class C GPCRs. The conserved arginine in TM3 (Arg-575 in GABAB2) is shifted by one residue from the arginine of the (D/E)RY motif of class A receptors. However, it is optimally located near the solvent interface where the G proteins are expected to bind. Our model also places the conserved TM3 lysine (Lys-572 in GABAB2) one helical turn above the former arginine in a buried and rather hydrophobic environment. Searching for negatively charged residues in the vicinity of this lysine highlighted solely the highly conserved aspartate of TM6 (Asp-688 in GABAB2). Of interest, this aspartate residue is located one turn of α-helix above the highly conserved acidic residue at the bottom of TM6 in class A receptors (Glu-247 in rhodopsin). As depicted in Fig. 2B, the three-dimensional model of the class C GABAB2 HD is consistent with the conserved charged residues identified in TM3 and TM6 facing each other. This ménage-à-trois might be involved in a network of ionic interactions mimicking that observed in class A GPCRs involving the (D/E)RY motif. Mutated GABAB Subunits Are Correctly Expressed at the Cell Surface—To test the possible involvement of the conserved basic and acidic residues, these were mutated such that the charge is suppressed (alanine), conserved, or inverted. To perform this study, we used the GABAB receptor as a model system. This receptor is a heterodimer composed of two homologous proteins GABAB1 and GABAB2. Although the GABAB1 subunit is responsible for agonist binding (34Kniazeff J. Galvez T. Labesse G. Pin J.P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7352-7361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Galvez T. Parmentier M.L.

As such, analyzing the role of these conserved residues in this receptor heterodimer may also allow a better understanding of the specific role of each HDs in G protein activation. We first mutated these three conserved residues (Lys-572, Arg-575, and Asp-688) in the GABAB2 subunit and co-expressed these with the wild-type GABAB1 subunit. As shown in Fig. 3A, the mutated GABAB2 subunits allow the correct surface targeting of the N-terminal HA-tagged GABAB1 subunit (between 77 ± 1 and 125 ± 11% of the wild-type GABAB receptor cell surface expression), as revealed by an ELISA performed on intact cells using anti-HA antibodies. Because it is well known that GABAB1 reaches the cell surface when associated with GABAB2 only (19Pagano A. Rovelli G. Mosbacher J. Lohmann T. Duthey B. Stauffer D. Ristig D. Schuler V. Heid J.

Two nearly identical copies of the survival of motor neuron genes (SMN1 and SMN2) are located on the human chromosome, 5q13, whereas other eukaryotic species have only one copy of the SMN gene. Homozygous deletions of, or mutations in the SMN1 gene are responsible for SMA (4Lefebvre S. Burglen L. Reboullet S. Clermont O. Burlet P. Viollet L. Benichou B. Cruaud C. Millasseau P. Zeviani M.

SMN is expressed ubiquitously and is a core component of a self-assembling multiprotein complex, the SMN complex, consisting of SMN and Gemin proteins, which plays an essential role in the assembly of the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and in pre-mRNA splicing (5Yong J.

Most of the missense mutations in SMA patients are located in exon 6 of SMN1; whereas nonsense and frameshift mutations are widely spread throughout the entire gene (7Ogino S. Wilson R.B. Expert Rev. Mol. Diagn. 2004; 4: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Exon 6 of SMN1 encodes a self-association domain, and deletions or mutations of this domain result in a decrease in oligomer formation of SMN, which correlates with the severity of SMA (8Lorson C.L.

SMN oligomerization is also a prerequisite for high affinity binding of the SMN complex to spliceosomal snRNPs (9Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11167-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The self-association domains of SMN were identified by surface plasmon resonance analysis; both the carboxyl-terminal exon 6-encoded region and the amino-terminal exon 2b-encoded region contributed to self-association (10Young P.J.

This suggests a mechanism in which the self-association formation involves either linear oligomers or closed rings by SMN proteins (10Young P.J. Man N.T. Lorson C.L. Le T.T. Androphy E.J.

Gemin2 is a 30-kDa protein that was identified as a core component of the SMN complex because of its association with the amino-terminal side of the SMN protein. Despite its lack of apparent known domains, Gemin2 plays important roles in the SMN complex; the SMN-Gemin2 complex is associated with spliceosomal snRNPs U1 and U5 (12Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), and Gemin2 is essential for the formation of the SMN complex (21Paushkin S. Gubitz A.K.

Additionally, gene targeting of Gemin2 in mice reveals a correlation between defects in the biogenesis of U snRNPs and motor neuron cell death (22Jablonka S. Holtmann B. Meister G. Bandilla M.

As well as Gemin2, the roles and the mechanisms of the other Gemin proteins in the SMN complex are not yet fully characterized, although recent analysis reveals that, in addition to the SMN protein, Gemin3, -5, -6, and -7 all associate directly with the Sm proteins (24Meister G.

Recent crystal structural analysis showed that a Gemin6-Gemin7 heterodimer has an Sm protein-like structure, suggesting that it plays a role in the assembly of the snRNP proteins (28Ma Y. Dostie J. Dreyfuss G. Van Duyne G.D. Structure. 2005; 13: 883-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Further, a Gemin3-Gemin4 complex was identified in the RNA-induced silencing complex complex, suggesting that Gemin3 and -4 have additional roles to play in the RNA interference gene regulation system (29Mourelatos Z.

Here, we systematically explore the functions of Gemin2 to gain insight into the molecular basis of the SMN complex and show that Gemin2 significantly stabilized amino-terminal SMN self-association. This correlates with the stability of the SMN oligomer formation and snRNP assembly activity and is likely to occur through the recently identified Gemin2 self-association. We also found that the amino-terminal self-association, Gemin2 binding, stabilizing effect of Gemin2, and snRNP assembly activity were lowered in the SMA-derived amino-terminal missense mutant SMN(D44V), supporting the importance of Gemin2 in stabilizing the SMN complex. cDNA Clones—The full-length cDNAs encoding the SMN complex component proteins were obtained from the RIKEN mouse cDNA bank (FANTOM) (30Carninci P.

The full-length cDNA for human SMN (BC015308) was purchased from the Mammalian Gene Collection. The full-length cDNA for human Gemin2 was kindly provided by Dr. Hitoshi Kurumizaka (Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan). Preparation of SMN Mutants—To generate missense mutations (D30N, D44V, and Y272C), human SMN cDNA was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension using PCR (31Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). PCR products were digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated into the pET21a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). SMN constructs, including synonymous point mutations in the target region of the siRNA against wild type SMN mRNA, were also generated by site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension using PCR. PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into the pCMV-HA vector (Clontech). The resulting clones were sequenced to confirm each mutation. The primers used for the preparation of SMN mutants are listed in supplemental Table S1. Expression and Purification of the Recombinant Gemin2—The Gemin2 encoding sequence was subcloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to express the GST-fused Gemin2 protein (GST-Gemin2). The sequence was also subcloned into the homemade pGEX-6P-1-(His)6 vector to express the carboxyl-terminal (His)6-tagged GST-Gemin2 (GST-Gemin2-His). The fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cells, harvested from 200 ml of culture, were sonicated and centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The lysate was applied to the GSTrap FF column (Amersham Biosciences) that contains glutathione-Sepharose resin and was then washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (–) buffer. The bound GST-Gemin2 or GST-Gemin2-His proteins were then cleaved with PreScission™ protease (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 4 h. Then the GST tag-free Gemin2 or Gemin2-His was eluted with HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl). The tag-free Gemin2 protein was subjected to gel-filtration chromatography on a Hi-Load 16/60 Superdex 200-pg column (Amersham Biosciences) with HBS buffer. The bound GST-Gemin2 was also eluted using 10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to obtain the GST-tagged Gemin2. Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay—Mammalian two-hybrid assays, including sample construction and transfection, were carried out as previously described (32Suzuki H. Fukunishi Y. Kagawa I. Saito R. Oda H. Endo T. Kondo S. Bono H. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1758-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. The forward primers specific to each ORF were designed to have a consensus tag sequence, 5′-GAAGGAGCCGCCACCATG-3′, followed by an ORF sense-strand sequence with an annealing temperature of 60 °C. Similarly, the reverse primers were designed to have another tag sequence, 5′-CAATTTCACACAGGAAACTCA-3′, followed by an ORF antisense-strand sequence. All the gene-specific primers and other common primers used in this work (RSALSE, FSV40LPAS02, FPCMV6, FPCMV5, RSV40LPAS01, T7-RBS-KOZAK, and LGT10L) are listed in supplemental Table S2. Briefly, fragments for the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (BIND) or the VP16 transcriptional activation domain (ACT), were PCR-amplified from pBIND or pACT vectors (Promega, Madison, WI) using the primer pair FPCMV6 and RSALSE. Fragments for the SV40 late polyadenylation signal (SV40LPAS) was PCR-amplified from the pBIND vector using the primer pair FSV40LPAS02 and RSV40LPAS01. Each cDNA ORF was amplified by using the corresponding ORF-specific forward and reverse primers. Overlapping PCR was carried out to obtain the assay constructs, in which each ORF fragment was connected with the BIND or ACT fragments at the 5′-end of the first PCR product and the SV40LPAS fragment at the 3′-end (bait and prey, respectively). One microliter each of the ORF fragments was mixed with 0.75 μl of BIND or ACT fragments and SV40LPAS fragments, and then amplified in 100-μl reactions using the primer pair FPCMV5 and LGT10L. All the PCR conditions were based on those in our previous report (32Suzuki H. Fukunishi Y. Kagawa I. Saito R. Oda H. Endo T. Kondo S. Bono H. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1758-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). All the combinations of Gemin2 and other components were transfected to CHO-K1 cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) together with the luciferase reporter plasmid pG5luc, and the reporter activity was measured after 22 h incubation. Each combination was done in triplicates, and the assay was carried out three times. Rapid in Vitro Pull-down Assay—The PCR products encoding protein-coding sequences were used to construct samples for in vitro transcription/translation. The products were connected by overlapping PCR using the primer pair T7-RBS-KOZAK and LGT10L giving the final constructs with a T7 RNA polymerase promoter at the 5′-terminal. The in vitro pull-down assay was carried out as previously described (33Suzuki H. Ogawa C. Usui K. Hayashizaki Y. BioTechniques. 2004; 37: 918-920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, independent in vitro synthesis of biotinylated and 35S-labeled proteins was carried out from the corresponding PCR constructs by using the Transcend™ biotinylated lysine-tRNA (Promega), redivue l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences), and TnT T7 Quick-Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega). After 35S-labeled protein synthesis was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, 10 μl each of biotinylated protein and 35S-labeled protein were mixed, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h. Dynabeads Streptavidin (Dynal Biotech, LLC, Milwaukee, WI) suspension (0.2-mg beads in 80 μl of blocking buffer, 2% (w/v) skim milk in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20)) was mixed with the reaction, and the mixture was incubated in a rotary shaker for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were isolated with a magnet and washed five times with 150 μl of ice-cold TBST. The radiolabeled proteins co-precipitated with biotinylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. GST Pull-down Assay—Purified GST (5 μg) or GST-Gemin2 (5 μg) was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Purified Gemin2-His (10 μg) was incubated with the immobilized GST or GST-Gemin2 in a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing the resin five times with the lysis buffer, the bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie staining or Western blot using anti-Gemin2 or anti-His antibodies. Western Blotting—The samples were separated by 10–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Primary antibodies used were: anti-Gemin2, SMN, Gemin3, PRMT5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), Gemin7 (Abnova Corp., Taipei City, Taiwan), polyclonal IgG, anti-Sm monoclonal antibody Y12 (Lab Vision Corp., Fremont, CA), anti-Gemin2 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences), and anti-His monoclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat (Promega) or anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) was used as secondary antibody, and the signal was detected by using the ECL plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Dissociation Assay—For in vitro dissociation assay, free [35S]methionine in the radioisotope-labeled reaction that was not incorporated into the synthesized proteins was removed using CENTRI-SEP spin columns (Princeton Separations, Inc., Adelphia, NJ). Each 50 μl of Biotin-labeled and 35S-labeled proteins was mixed with either 50 μl of in vitro synthesized unlabeled protein or 50 μl of the reticulocyte lysate, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h. Dynabeads Streptavidin suspension (1-mg beads in 150 μl of the blocking buffer) was mixed with the reaction and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were captured by a magnet and washed once with 500 μl of ice-cold TBST within 2 min of the capture, followed by re-suspension in 300 μl of TBST. Every 15 min, 50 μl of the suspension was removed. The beads were captured, and radioactivity remaining on the beads was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. Sedimentation Analysis—HeLa cells (two 10-cm cultured dishes) were used for sedimentation analysis of the SMN oligomer. The siRNAs for Gemin2 and the negative control (GCAGCUCAAUGUCCAGAU and CCCGGACCACAACGCUCUG, respectively (25Feng W. Gubitz A.K. Wan L. Battle D.J. Dostie J. Golembe T.J. Dreyfuss G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1605-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)) were purchased from Invitrogen. The siRNAs were transfected into the cells by using Oligofectamine™ according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). After 44 h from the siRNA transfection, the silencing of Gemin2 in siRNA-transfected cells was evaluated by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The cells were harvested and re-suspended in 500 μl of the lysis buffer, and the centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Preparation of the sucrose density gradient was performed by using Gradient master (Biocomp Instruments, Inc., Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada). The supernatant was separated on 6 to 38% (w/v) sucrose gradients at 17,000 rpm in the SW28 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) at 4 °C for 17.5 h, followed by 2-ml fractionations by using a Piston gradient fractionator (Biocomp Instruments). The proteins in the fractions were precipitated with 3% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The precipitants were diluted in 50 μl of 0.1 m NaOH, and 20% of each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-SMN polyclonal IgG. Svedberg values of the SMN complex were estimated by using the marker globular proteins, ovalbumin (3.5S, 44 kDa), aldolase (7.3S, 158 kDa), and thyroglobulin (19.4S, 670 kDa). Other additional ribosomal 50S (1.8 MDa) and 70S (2.7 MDa) subunits were also used in size estimation. Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells (in a 10-cm culture dish) were transfected with the siRNA for Gemin2 or with the negative control siRNA using Oligofectamine™ according to the manufacturer's protocol. Forty-four hours after the siRNA transfection, cells were harvested and lysed by lysis buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 mg/ml leupeptin. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were subjected to an immunoprecipitation with 5 μg of anti-SMN antibody. The co-precipitated Gemin2, Gemin3, Gemin7, and SmB/B′ were detected by Western blotting. qRT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from HeLa cells using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The extracted total RNA was reverse-transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer and ThermoScript™ RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). The prepared cDNA were used as templates for qRT-PCR analysis using SYBR Green I nucleic acid gel stain (Invitrogen). The two different primer sets against each target gene are shown in supplemental Table S3. PCR amplification was carried out using the ABI Prism 7900HT instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and each reaction was run in triplicate. Expression was assessed by evaluating the threshold cycle value (CT). Firstly, the difference of threshold cycle (ΔCT) of each target gene was calculated between the negative control siRNA-transfected cells and Gemin2 siRNA-transfected cells. Secondly, the gene expression levels of negative control cells was set to 1.0, and the relative gene expression levels of Gemin2 siRNA-transfected cells were calculated as 2–ΔCT. The procedure is described in detail in supplemental data 1. In Vitro snRNP Assembly Assay—The in vitro snRNP assembly assay was carried out as described previously (26Shpargel K.B. Matera A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17372-17377Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 34Wan L. Battle D.J. Yong J. Gubitz A.K. Kolb S.J. Wang J. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5543-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), with slight modification. Briefly, U1 snRNA was transcribed in vitro using Riboprobe Systems (Promega) in the presence of Ribo m7G Cap Analog (Promega) and [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by removal of DNA template by digestion with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega). The free [α-32P]UTP that was not incorporated into the synthesized U1 snRNA was removed by using MicroSpin S-200 HR Columns (Amersham Biosciences). Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from HeLa cells using Ne-Per nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce), and the extracts were incubated with U1 snRNA for 20 min at 30 °C in RSB-100 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2). Subsequently, the U1 RNA that was assembled by Sm proteins was immunoprecipitated with the anti-Sm monoclonal antibody Y12 (Lab Vision Corp.) or anti-Gal4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which was used as a negative control antibody. The antibody and Dynabeads protein G (Dynal Biotech) in 80 μl of RSB-100 buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.2 unit/μl RNasin RNase inhibitor (Promega), were added to the reaction mixtures, and the mixture was incubated in a rotary shaker for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were isolated with a magnet and washed five times with 200 μl of ice-cold RSB-100 buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Half of the precipitated U1 RNA was measured using a liquid scintillation counter, and the other half was subjected to 7 m urea-6% polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. After subtraction of the count for immunoprecipitation with anti-Gal4 antibody (negative control), the relative assembly activity was compared with the assembly activity of the wild-type cells. The average count for the negative control was 82 cpm (<1% of the count in the wild type). Identification of a Novel Protein-Protein Interaction, the Gemin2 Self-association—Gemin2 is a core component of the SMN complex, contributing to the activity of the SMN complex through an uncharacterized molecular mechanism (12Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 22Jablonka S. Holtmann B. Meister G. Bandilla M. Rossoll W. Fischer U.

Cell Res. 2004; 296: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To gain insight into Gemin2 and its mechanisms, we tried to purify recombinant Gemin2 using a size-fractionation column, and we found that the main fraction of Gemin2 was ∼65 kDa, whereas minor fractions of 30 and 120 kDa were apparent (Fig. 1A). Assuming that Gemin2 is a globular protein, the observed molecular mass for the main fraction was twice as heavy as the theoretical molecular mass of 30 kDa, which would suggest that Gemin2 forms a homo-dimer (Fig. 1A). To confirm the result in vivo, we explored the self-association of Gemin2 using a mammalian two-hybrid system (32Suzuki H. Fukunishi Y. Kagawa I. Saito R. Oda H. Endo T. Kondo S. Bono H. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1758-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We made constructs that expressed Gemin2, SMN, and Gemin4 as fusion proteins with the Gal4 DNA binding domain or the VP16 trans-activation domain. Together with the reporter plasmid, the Gal4-Gemin2 construct was transfected into CHO-K1 cells in combination with VP16-fusion protein constructs, and the interaction between the expressed fusion proteins was detected by measuring the luciferase reporter activity the next day. We found that Gemin2-Gemin2 showed high reporter activity, comparable to that of SMN-Gemin2, a previously known interaction (Fig. 1B). We also applied a rapid in vitro pull-down method that we recently d"

https://openalex.org/W2003804424,"We have previously identified mouse DDA3 as a p53-inducible gene. To explore the functional role of DDA3, we screened a mouse brain cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid assay, and identified the microtubule plus-end binding protein EB3 as a DDA3-interacting protein. Binding of DDA3 to EB3 was verified by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay and subcellular colocalization; co-immunoprecipitation further indicated that interaction of these two proteins within cells required intact microtubules. Domains of DDA3-EB3 interaction were mapped by GST pull-down assay to amino acids 118–241 and 242–329 of DDA3 and the N- and C-termini of EB3. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed colocalization of DDA3 with microtubules in various cell phases, and regions encompassing aa 118–241 and 242–329 contained microtubule-interacting and bundling activities. In vitro microtubule-binding assay showed that DDA3 and EB3 associated directly with microtubules, and cooperated with each other for microtubule binding. In addition, DDA3 bound to the EB3 interacting partner adenomatous polyposis coli 2 (APC2), a homolog of the tumor suppressor APC, which is a component of the β-catenin destruction complex. Ectopic expression of DDA3 and EB3 enhanced β-catenin-dependent transactivation and cyclin D1 production, whereas knockdown of endogenous DDA3 or EB3 inhibited β-catenin-mediated transactivation and the ability of cells to form colonies. Together, our results identify DDA3 as a novel microtubule-associated protein that binds to EB3, and implicate DDA3 and EB3 in the β-catenin-mediated growth signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2030748065,"Deletions of chromosomal arms 1p and 19q are frequent in oligodendroglial tumours and have been associated with sensitivity to radio- and chemotherapy as well as favourable prognosis. By using microarray-based expression profiling, we found that oligodendroglial tumours with 1p and 19q losses showed significantly lower expression of the CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with glutamic acid/aspartic acid-rich carboxyl-terminal domain 4 gene (CITED4) at 1p34.2 as compared to tumours without 1p and 19q losses. Mutational analysis showed no CITED4 mutations in gliomas. However, 1p and 19q losses as well as low expression of CITED4 transcripts were significantly associated with hypermethylation of the CITED4-associated CpG island. In line with the latter finding, treatment of CITED4 hypermethylated glioma cell lines with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine and trichostatine A resulted in a marked increase of the CITED4 transcript levels. Furthermore, CITED4 hypermethylation was significantly associated with longer recurrence-free and overall survival of patients with oligodendroglial tumours. Taken together, our results indicate that CITED4 is epigenetically silenced in the vast majority of oligodendroglial tumours with 1p and 19q deletions and suggest CITED4 hypermethylation as a novel prognostic marker in oligodendroglioma patients."

https://openalex.org/W2072659410,"Phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized pathogens by Fcγ receptors requires extensive remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, a process regulated by the small GTPase Rac. Vav was thought to be the guanine nucleotide exchange factor responsible for the activation of Rac, but recent evidence indicates that Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis is unaffected in macrophages lacking all three isoforms of Vav. We therefore tested whether another GEF, DOCK180, participates in Fcγ receptor-initiated phagocytosis. DOCK180 associates with the adaptor protein Crk, which mediates recruitment of the GEF to sites of tyrosine phosphorylation. CrkII and DOCK180 were found to accumulate at the phagocytic cup. Knockdown of Crk or DOCK180 in murine macrophages using small interfering RNA inhibited phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized particles. Moreover, transfection of dominant negative CrkII prevented both recruitment of DOCK180 and the activation of Rac at the phagocytic cup. This is the first report of a role for either Crk or DOCK180 in Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis. The Crk-DOCK180 complex is involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells, which unlike the ingestion of IgG-opsonized particles, is an anti-inflammatory process. The finding that CrkII-DOCK180 is also responsible, at least in part, for the effects of Fcγ receptors implies that additional, parallel pathways must account for the associated pro-inflammatory effect.

The finding that CrkII-DOCK180 is also responsible, at least in part, for the effects of Fcγ receptors implies that additional, parallel pathways must account for the associated pro-inflammatory effect. Phagocytosis is a key component of the innate immune response to infection. Phagocytic receptors recognize molecular features inherent to infectious microorganisms or bind host-derived opsonins, such as complement components or immunoglobulins that coat their surface. Fcγ receptors on the surface of phagocytes recognize pathogens opsonized by IgG. Upon engagement, the receptors become phosphorylated by Src family kinases and recruit and activate the kinase Syk (1Greenberg S. Grinstein S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). These early events culminate in extensive remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for engulfment of the pathogen.Actin restructuring during Fc-mediated phagocytosis is regulated by the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac. These GTPases act as molecular switches, recruiting effector proteins only when bound to GTP, a condition promoted by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). 4The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PBD, PAK-binding domain; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; SH, Src homology; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DIC, differential interference contrast. 4The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PBD, PAK-binding domain; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; SH, Src homology; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DIC, differential interference contrast. The activation cycle is terminated by hydrolysis of GTP, which is facilitated by GTPase activating proteins. Although the relative contributions of Rac and Cdc42 to Fcγ-mediated phagocytosis are only partially understood (2Hoppe A.D. Swanson J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), there is good evidence that Rac plays an essential role. Epitope-tagged Rac becomes enriched at sites of Fcγ-mediated phagocytosis (3Caron E. Hall A. Science. 1998; 282: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar), whereas expression of dominant negative Rac constructs drastically inhibits phagocytosis and the accumulation of actin underneath the IgG-opsonized particle (4Cox D. Chang P. Zhang Q. Reddy P.G. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Indeed, recruitment of active Rac to the plasma membrane per se is sufficient to induce phagocytosis of latex beads (5Castellano F. Montcourrier P. Chavrier P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2955-2961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Despite its importance, it remains unclear how stimulation of Fcγ receptors is linked to Rac activation. In particular, the identity of the GEF(s) responsible for activating Rac is controversial. Some evidence has implicated Vav isoforms, because microinjection of dominant negative Vav constructs was found to inhibit phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized red blood cells (6Patel J.C. Hall A. Caron E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has recently been shown that macrophages deficient in all three isoforms of Vav display no defect in Fcγ-mediated phagocytosis (7Hall A.B. Gakidis M.A. Glogauer M. Wilsbacher J.L. Gao S. Swat W. Brugge J.S. Immunity. 2006; 24: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).It is known that GEFs can be recruited to receptors at the plasma membrane by adaptor proteins (8Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Such adaptors contain modular protein-protein interaction domains that allow the activated receptor to recruit downstream signaling molecules (9Buday L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 187-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). One such adaptor, CrkII, contains an N-terminal SH2 domain that interacts with phosphorylated tyrosine residues followed by two SH3 domains (designated SH3-N and SH3-C) that bind proline-rich motifs (10Feller S.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6348-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in Caenorhabditis elegans, CED-2 (the homologue of CrkII) has been shown to mediate phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells (11Wang X. Wu Y.C. Fadok V.A. Lee M.C. Gengyo-Ando K. Cheng L.C. Ledwich D. Hsu P.K. Chen J.Y. Chou B.K. Henson P. Mitani S. Xue D. Science. 2003; 302: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and interacts with a Rac GEF, DOCK180, via its SH3-N domain. Recently, CrkII was also found to be essential for the invasion of Listeria monocytogenes into non-phagocytic mammalian cells (12Sun H. Shen Y. Dokainish H. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A. Ireton K. Cell Microbiol. 2005; 7: 443-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Whether CrkII is also necessary for Fcγ-mediated phagocytosis is unknown.In this work, we sought to determine the link between the early events in Fcγ receptor-mediated signaling and Rac activation in macrophages. We identified a critical role for CrkII in the phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized particles and provided evidence that this adaptor serves to recruit the Rac GEF DOCK180 to the site of ingestion. CrkII-DOCK180-mediated activation of Rac therefore represents a conserved signaling pathway common to the phagocytosis of both IgG-opsonized particles and apoptotic cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—Fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Hepes-buffered solution/RPMI 1640 and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were from Wisent (St. Bruno, Quebec, Canada). Latex beads (3.1 μm in diameter) were from Bangs Beads (Fishers, IN). Mouse monoclonal antibody to Crk was from BD Biosciences. Goat antibody to DOCK180 and rabbit anti-CrkL were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-HA was from Covance (Berkeley, CA).

The siRNA pool to Crk (siGENOME SMARTpool M-061117) and the non-targeting siRNA control (siCONTROL Non-targeting siRNA#1 D-001210–01) were from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO), and siRNA to DOCK180 (SC-35208) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Plasmids encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein-DOCK180 and FLAG-DOCK180 were generously provided by Dr. M. Matsuda (Osaka University, Japan). The plasmids encoding HA-tagged wild-type and dominant negative CrkII (R38K, W170K, W276K) have been previously described (12Sun H. Shen Y. Dokainish H. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A. Ireton K. Cell Microbiol. 2005; 7: 443-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding the fusion of the PBD-YFP was a gift of Dr. G. Bokoch (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA).Cell Culture and Transfection—RAW264.7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 under a humidified atmosphere. Lipofection was carried out with FuGENE-6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) using 5 μl of the lipofection reagent and 2 μg of DNA. Electroporation was performed using the Amaxa system (Cologne, Germany), following the manufacturer's guidelines, with 2 million cells and either 2 μg of cDNA or 1.5 μg of siRNA using program D32. Cells were analyzed 6–10 h after electroporation, unless otherwise stated.Human macrophages were isolated by plating the lymphocyte/monocyte-rich layer of blood from healthy volunteers on coverslips bathed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, incubating them at 37 °C, followed by washing with sterile PBS and changing the medium daily for five days to remove platelets and lymphocytes.Phagocytosis Assays—Latex beads were opsonized with 3.75 mg/ml human IgG for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells grown on glass coverslips were changed to prewarmed serum-free Hepes-buffered solution/RPMI 1640 and were overlaid with 25 μl of opsonized latex beads and incubated at 37 °C to initiate phagocytosis. In most experiments, phagocytosis was synchronized by centrifugation of the beads onto the cells at 1500 revolutions/min for 10 s. Unless stated otherwise, RAW cells were incubated with beads for 10 min at 37 °C followed by labeling of external beads using Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-human antibody and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. In some experiments, RAW cells were pretreated with 100 μm LY294002 for 15 min prior to phagocytosis.Microscopy, Immunofluorescence, and Image Analysis—Analysis of the distribution and density of Crk, DOCK180, and PBD-YFP was performed using an LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss) with a 100× oil immersion objective. Quantitation of the fluorescence of PBD-YFP at the phagosomal cup was accomplished using Image J software (NIH) after subtracting for the background. Membrane-associated fluorescence was normalized to cytosolic fluorescence to eliminate the variable expression inherent to transient transfection. The phagocytic index of cells transfected with dominant negative mutants of CrkII was calculated by imaging random fields and counting the number of internalized beads in cells expressing suitably high levels of the transfected gene product. Phagocytic index of cells treated with siRNA was calculated by imaging random fields and counting the number of internalized beads divided by the number of cells in the field. In all cases, image acquisition settings were kept constant between conditions.Immunofluorescence of Crk in RAW cells was performed by fixing cells in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by permeabilization in 0.1% Triton, blocking in 5% milk, and then probing with mouse anti-Crk at 1:100 for 1 h. After washing with PBS, the samples were incubated with Cy-3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:1000) for 30 min and then washed and mounted using DAKO mounting medium (Dako Cytomation, Carpenteria, CA). An identical procedure was used for immunofluorescence of DOCK180 in RAW cells, except that a goat anti-DOCK180 primary antibody (1:50) and the appropriate secondary antibody were used. For immunofluorescence of HA- or FLAG-tagged proteins, we used mouse anti-HA at 1:1000 and mouse anti-FLAG at 1:1000 for 1 h.Flow Cytometry—RAW cells were treated with siRNA to Crk or control siRNA 72 h before the experiment. Cells were probed with Fc Block antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences) using a Cy2-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:1000. Cells were analyzed in a FACS-Calibur cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the results were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Flow Jo).Immunoblotting—Lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 7–10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked for 1 h in 5% milk in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween), and then probed overnight with the primary antibody at 4 °C. We used 1:2500 for mouse anti-Crk, 1:100 for anti-DOCK180, 1:50 for anti-CrkL, 1:2000 for anti-GAPDH, and 1:10000 for anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. After washing in PBS/Tween, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000–1:5000) for 30 min, washed vigorously, and then visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).Aggregated IgG was prepared by heating a 12.5 mg/ml solution of IgG in PBS to 56 °C for 30 min and then removing high-molecular-weight aggregates by centrifugation. The supernatant was applied to the cells for 7 min at 37 °C. For immunoblotting for phosphotyrosine, membranes were blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and washes were in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20. Quantitation of protein bands was performed using Image J (NIH) on scanned blots and included correction for the background.Protein Expression, Purification, and Pulldown Assay—Plasmid constructs containing glutathione S-transferase (GST) alone or fused to full-length wild-type CrkII or CrkII W170K were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (12Sun H. Shen Y. Dokainish H. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A. Ireton K. Cell Microbiol. 2005; 7: 443-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Sedimentation of proteins from solubilized lysates of RAW cells that interact with GST fusion proteins was performed essentially as previously described (12Sun H. Shen Y. Dokainish H. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A. Ireton K. Cell Microbiol. 2005; 7: 443-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 106 RAW cells were seeded in 10-cm plates and grown for 24 h. The cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and solubilized by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm sodium-orthovanadate HCl-activated, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin). The RAW cell lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was recovered and used for the pulldown assay. Equal quantities of GST fusion proteins and RAW cell lysates were used for each precipitation. The total protein in the precipitates was separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by immunoblotting for DOCK180.Statistics—Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were performed at least in triplicate. For comparisons of means, Student's t tests were used. A probability <0.05 was deemed significant.RESULTSCrkII Is Recruited to the Phagocytic Cup during Fcγ-mediated Phagocytosis—To confirm that Crk is expressed in macrophages, we analyzed whole cell lysates of human blood monocyte-derived macrophages and murine RAW264.7 cells (hereafter called RAW cells) by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the two known splice variants of Crk (10Feller S.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6348-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). As expected, we detected two bands, corresponding to CrkII (≈40 kDa) and CrkI (≈28 kDa). As shown in Fig. 1A, CrkII is expressed at higher levels than CrkI in both human and murine macrophages. Next, we determined whether Crk is recruited to the phagosome during Fcγ-mediated phagocytosis. Human macrophages were allowed to ingest IgG-opsonized latex beads and were subsequently immunostained for endogenous Crk. A distinct recruitment of Crk to the nascent phagosome was noted (Fig. 1B). A similar recruitment was also observed in RAW macrophages (Fig. 1C), indicating that Crk is present and mobilizes to phagosomes in both human and murine phagocytes. Of note, the association of endogenous Crk was clearly observable at the earliest stages of phagocytic cup formation but was virtually absent from formed (sealed) phagosomes (Fig. 1D). The accumulation of Crk at the phagocytic cup was also apparent in RAW cells transfected with HA-tagged CrkII, the predominant splice isoform in these cells. As found for endogenous Crk, the recruitment of CrkII-HA was noticeable during the initial stages of phagocytosis (Fig. 1E), but despite the improved detectability conferred by the epitope tag, the adaptor protein was virtually absent from sealed phagosomes (Fig. 1F). These data demonstrate that CrkII is recruited rapidly to the forming phagosome in both murine and human macrophages but suggest that this recruitment is only transient.Dominant Negative CrkII Inhibits Fcγ-mediated Phagocytosis—To determine the functional role of CrkII in phagocytosis, we expressed dominant negative mutant forms of the adaptor in RAW macrophages. These mutants have amino acid substitutions in either the SH2 (R38K), SH3-N (W170K), or SH3-C (W276K) domains of the protein (Fig. 2A). The R38K mutation eliminates an arginine residue found in all SH2 domains that is known to be essential for the recognition of phosphotyrosine groups (13Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Similarly, the W170K and W276K mutations alter conserved tryptophans required for binding of SH3 domains to proline-rich motifs (14Dalgarno D.C. Botfield M.C. Rickles R.J. Biopolymers. 1997; 43: 383-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Mutants of CrkII at Arg-38 and Trp-170 have been previously shown to disrupt the interaction of CrkII with its binding partners (15Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kurata T. Sugimura H. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24479-24484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Transfection of the dominant negative mutants of CrkII significantly inhibited phagocytosis, with the greatest inhibition occurring with the R38K and W170K mutants (Fig. 2B; p < 0.01 for all mutants versus control). In particular, expression of the R38K mutant decreased phagocytosis by almost 75% relative to cells transfected with wild-type CrkII. This mutant also decreased the ability of the cells to spread on the substratum (not illustrated), consistent with an effect on actin remodeling. Transfection of wild-type CrkII had no significant effect on internalization compared with untransfected cells (data not shown).FIGURE 2Dominant negative CrkII inhibits Fcγ-mediated phagocytosis. A, schematic of the domain structure of CrkII and of the mutants used in this study. B, quantitation of the effect of CrkII dominant negative mutants on the phagocytic index. RAW macrophages were transfected with either wild-type (WT) or dominant negative alleles of HA-tagged CrkII before incubation with IgG-opsonized latex beads. The phagocytic index was calculated relative to cells transfected with wild-type CrkII. Data are means ± S.E. of at least 70 individual determinations/condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Knockdown of Crk by siRNA Inhibits Fcγ-mediated Phagocytosis—Because overexpression of inhibitory mutants can have undesirable effects on related yet distinct pathways, we sought to confirm the role of Crk by alternative, more specific means. To this end, we introduced siRNA to Crk into RAW cells by electroporation and determined the levels of the protein 48–72 h later. As a control for our siRNA studies, we used a non-targeting siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) specifically designed not to interact with any gene products in mouse cells. Although Crk expression was unaffected in cells transfected with control siRNA, the expression of both isoforms was markedly depressed in cells treated with Crk siRNA. CrkI and CrkII protein levels dropped by >75 and 50%, respectively (p < 0.05 versus control for both) (Fig. 3A and B). Importantly, this effect was specific to the Crk gene. Not only was the expression of unrelated housekeeping proteins such as GAPDH unaffected, but the levels of the related protein CrkL were similarly unaltered (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Knockdown of Crk by siRNA inhibits Fcγ-mediated phagocytosis. A, RAW cells were treated with siRNA to Crk, and lysates were probed by immunoblotting for Crk 48–72 h later. Blots were stripped and reprobed for GADPH as a loading control (Ctrl) followed by stripping and reprobing for CrkL. B, quantitation of protein knockdown. Blots such as that in A were scanned, and the intensity of the bands was normalized to control cells after background subtraction. Data are means ± S.E. of three separate experiments. RAW cells treated with either control siRNA (C and D) or siRNA to Crk (E and F) were incubated with IgG-opsonized beads 48–72 h after electroporation and then immunostained using an antibody to Crk (red). Non-internalized beads were detected using Cy5-conjugated anti-human antibody and are shown in blue. Corresponding DIC images are shown in D and F. G, quantitation of the effect of knockdown of Crk on the phagocytic index. RAW cells treated with either control siRNA or siRNA to Crk for 48–72 h were incubated with IgG-opsonized beads. The phagocytic index was normalized to the control cells. Data represent means ± S.E. from three separate experiments and ∼1300 cells/condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In parallel experiments, we exposed siRNA-transfected cells to IgG-opsonized beads and determined the phagocytic index (Fig. 3, C–F). Cells pretreated with Crk siRNA had a lower ability to ingest particles compared with non-targeting siRNA controls (Fig. 3G). The inhibition was never complete, but it was highly significant (p < 0.01) and of the same order as the reduction in protein expression (see above). This likely reflects heterogeneity in the delivery of siRNA by electroporation, because immunostaining revealed the presence of two populations of cells: one with near-normal expression and another with negligible levels (not shown). Together with the data from the dominant negative constructs, these results indicate that Crk has an essential function in Fcγ-mediated phagocytosis.Knockdown of Crk Does Not Affect Fcγ Receptor Levels or Function—Silencing the Crk gene was expected to alter the adaptor function of this protein and its downstream effectors without impairing receptor activation. To validate this notion, we determined the surface density and activation state of Fcγ receptors in cells treated with control or Crk-directed siRNA. Flow cytometric determinations revealed that the surface expression of Fcγ receptors was indistinguishable in control and Crk-depleted cells (Fig. 4A). The ability of these receptors to become activated was evaluated by quantifying the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation triggered by cross-linking. As shown in Fig. 4B, a robust increase in phosphotyrosine content was induced by aggregated IgG in both control and Crk-depleted cells. These results provide evidence that Crk knockdown does not affect Fcγ receptor expression, targeting, or activation and imply that Crk plays a specific role in signaling subsequent transduction events.FIGURE 4Knockdown of Crk does not affect Fcγ receptor expression or function. A, RAW cells treated with either control (Ctrl) siRNA or siRNA to Crk were probed 72 h after electroporation with an antibody to murine FcγRII/III followed by a Cy2-labeled secondary antibody and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Black tracing denotes cells treated with siRNA to Crk; gray tracing denotes control siRNA-treated cells. Histogram is representative of three separate experiments. B, RAW cells treated with either control or Crk-specific siRNA were stimulated 72 h after electroporation with aggregated IgG for 7 min at 37 °C and then analyzed by immunoblotting. Lysates were probed using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and then stripped and reprobed for GAPDH as a loading control. Images and blots are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DOCK180 Is Recruited to the Phagocytic Cup in a CrkII-dependent Manner—One of the best-characterized Crk-binding proteins is DOCK180, which was described to display GEF activity (16Hasegawa H.

It therefore seemed conceivable that CrkII functions at the nascent phagocytic cup by recruiting DOCK180. To test this hypothesis, we immunostained endogenous DOCK180 in RAW macrophages during the course of phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized beads (Fig. 5A). We also transfected RAW macrophages with either FLAG- or green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged DOCK180 and visualized the cells during the course of particle ingestion. An obvious accumulation of DOCK180 at the cup was observed very early during phagocytosis, whether by immunostaining of the endogenous protein or of epitope-tagged constructs (Fig. 5, B and C), resembling the pattern noted earlier with CrkII.FIGURE 5DOCK180 is recruited to the cup in a CrkII-dependent manner. A, RAW cells were incubated with IgG-opsonized beads for 1 min at 37 °C and then probed for endogenous DOCK180. For all panels, arrowheads denote the phagocytic cup, whereas asterisks denote beads. Insets are corresponding DIC images. B, RAW cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged DOCK180 and incubated with IgG-opsonized beads for 1 min at 37 °C and then probed for the FLAG epitope.

D, RAW cells were transfected with GFP-tagged DOCK180 and treated with 100 μm LY294002 for 15 min prior to incubation with IgG-opsonized beads for 1 min. RAW cells were co-transfected with GFP-tagged DOCK180 (E) and HA-tagged CrkII and incubated with IgG-opsonized beads for 1 min followed by immunostaining for HA (F). RAW cells were co-transfected with GFP-tagged DOCK180 (G) and HA-tagged CrkII(R38K) and then incubated with IgG-opsonized beads for 1 min followed by immunostaining for HA (H).

The membrane topology of Streptococcus pneumoniae PlsY was determined using the substituted cysteine accessibility method. PlsY has five membrane-spanning segments with the amino terminus and two short loops located on the external face of the membrane. Each of the three larger cytoplasmic domains contains a highly conserved sequence motif. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that each conserved domain was critical for PlsY catalysis. Motif 1 had an essential serine and arginine residue. Motif 2 had the characteristics of a phosphate-binding loop. Mutations of the conserved glycines in motif 2 to alanines resulted in a Km defect for glycerol 3-phosphate binding leading to the conclusion that this motif corresponded to the glycerol 3-phosphate binding site. Motif 3 contained a conserved histidine and asparagine that were important for activity and a glutamate that was critical to the structural integrity of PlsY. PlsY was noncompetitively inhibited by palmitoyl-CoA. These data define the membrane architecture and the critical active site residues in the PlsY family of bacterial acyltransferases.

However, the E. coli paradigm is not universal, and the plsB gene is confined to Gram-negative bacteria (primarily γ-proteobacteria) (5Lu Y.-J. Zhang Y.-M. Grimes K.D. Qi J. Lee R.E. Rock C.O. Mol.

This activated fatty acid is then used by the membrane-bound PlsY acyltransferase to acylate the 1-position of glycerol-3-P (Fig. 1). The second acyltransferase in PtdOH formation, PlsC, is universally expressed in bacteria and completes the synthesis of PtdOH by transferring an acyl chain from acyl-ACP (acyl-CoA) to the 2-position of 1-acylglycerol-3-P (5Lu Y.-J.

Briefly, the reaction buffer contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm Na3VO4 (to inactive phosphatases), and purified membranes. 16:0-PO4 was added to start the reaction.

Aliquots containing serial dilutions of membrane protein were assayed for PlsY activity as described above, and the specific activity was calculated by regression analysis. Samples (10 μg of protein) from each mutant membrane preparation were fractionated by SDSgel electrophoresis, and the PlsY proteins were detected by immunoblotting with the anti-His antibody. The relative amount of each PlsY mutant was determined by quantitation of the fluorescent signal using the Typhoon 9200 Phosphor-Imager. These values were normalized to the wild-type protein, and the normalization factor was multiplied by the specific activity to obtain the activity reported in the text and figures.Plasmid Construction, Mutagenesis, and Expression—Plasmid pPJ131 was derived from pBluescript II KS+ that had the XbaI-BamHI fragment from pET15b inserted into the multiple cloning site. The S. pneumoniae SPR0755 gene (plsY) was amplified using primer pairs that added six histidines to the carboxyl terminus, an NcoI site at the initiating codon, and a XhoI site after an engineered stop codon following the His6 tag. This fragment was inserted between the NcoI and XhoI sites of pPJ131. The resulting plasmid, pPJY (5Lu Y.-J. Zhang Y.-M. Grimes K.D. Qi J. Lee R.E. Rock C.O. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 765-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), expressed a carboxylterminal PlsY under the control of the T7 promoter. Mutants were generated by using primer pairs that introduced the desired changes and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Primers were designed following guidelines in the QuikChange protocol. Briefly, both of the mutagenic primers contained the desired mutation and annealed to the same sequence on opposite strands of the plasmid. Primers were between 25 and 45 bases in length, with a melting temperature ≥ 78 °C. There were 15-18 bases of correct sequence on either side of the mutated codon. The primers optimally had minimum GC content of 40% and terminated in one or more C or G bases. The sequences were verified by Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. These plasmids were used to transform E. coli strain FB23281 (plsY::Tn5).The T7 promoter controlling plsY expression provided a modest protein overexpression in the absence of T7 polymerase. The specific activity of PlsY in S. pneumoniae membranes was 3.7 ± 0.1 pmol/min/μg. The PlsY specific activity in the E. coli expression system was 18.28 ± 1.49 pmol/min/μg, which was 5-fold higher than found in native S. pneumoniae membranes.Topology Determination of PlsY using SCAM—The substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) was performed following the methods described by Bogdanov et al. (23Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 24Bogdanov M. Zhang W. Xie J. Dowhan W. Methods (San Diego). 2005; 36: 148-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to an A600 of 1.0 and collected by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended in 1 ml of 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline and divided equally into two tubes. Toluene (0.5%) was added into one tube to permeabilize the cell membrane. Both tubes were treated with 10 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min followed by washes with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then labeled with 100 μm MPB for 10 min and stopped by adding β-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 20 mm. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 2% Triton X-100. Cells were lysed by sonication and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads and incubated at room temperature for 2 h with shaking. The beads were washed once with the same buffer and twice with buffer containing 40 mm imidazole and then eluted with buffer adjusted to 200 mm imidazole. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-His antibody and streptavidin-AP conjugate following standard protocol.Kinetic Analysis—The kinetic parameters for glycerol-3-P and 16:0-PO4 were obtained by linear regression analysis of double reciprocal plot using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software). The Km for glycerol-3-P was determined by fixing the 16:0-PO4 concentration to 200 μm while varying the [14C]glycerol-3-P concentration from 50 to 800 μm. The Km for 16:0-PO4 was obtained by varying the concentration of 16:0-PO4 from 3.125 to 50 μm at a fixed [14C]glycerol-3-P concentration of 200 μm.RESULTSMembrane Topology of PlsY—PlsY was associated with the membrane fraction of S. pneumoniae or E. coli cells expressing PlsY when acylphosphate acyltransferase activity was assayed using fractions separated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (5Lu Y.-J. Zhang Y.-M. Grimes K.D. Qi J. Lee R.E. Rock C.O. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 765-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This behavior was characteristic for an integral membrane protein; thus we performed a hydropathy analysis of PlsY using the Kyte-Doolitte algorithm with a window size of 19 residues to predict the transmembrane domains in PlsY (25Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17009) Google Scholar). The prediction did not clearly demonstrate a pattern of hydrophobicity that allowed us to confidently define the membrane topology by visual inspection (Fig. 2A). The analysis of the PlsY sequence using two membrane protein structure prediction programs, SOSUI (26Hirokawa T. Boon-Chieng S. Mitaku S. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 1998; 14: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar) and TMHMM (27Krogh A. Larsson B. von H.G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8888) Google Scholar), showed that PlsY contained several possible transmembrane domains; however, the programs did not agree on the topology. Both models predicted the existence of significant protein loops that contained highly conserved amino acid sequences exposed to cell exterior. Because the substrates for PlsY are generated on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, it did not seem reasonable that an extended loop with a highly conserved sequence motif would be found in the extracellular compartment.FIGURE 2Topology of PlsY. A, the hydropathy plot of PlsY according to Kyte and Doolittle (25Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17009) Google Scholar). The location of the cysteine substitution mutants are indicated. B, E. coli cells expressing the indicated cysteine substitution mutants were treated with or without 0.5% toluene and labeled with 100 μm MPB. Cells were lysed by 2% Triton X-100 plus sonication, and the His-tagged PlsY proteins were isolated using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads and separated by SDS gel electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The top row (MPB) shows the visualization of the biotin-derivatized proteins with streptavidin and the bottom row (His) shows immunostaining of the proteins with the anti-His tag antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The SCAM approach, based on the controlled membrane permeability of sulfhydryl reagents, was used to directly determine the topology of PlsY (23Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 24Bogdanov M. Zhang W. Xie J. Dowhan W. Methods (San Diego). 2005; 36: 148-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Single Cys replacement mutants at different locations along the PlsY sequence (Fig. 2B) were introduced, and the modified PlsYs were expressed as carboxyl-terminal His-tagged proteins in E. coli. MPB is impermeable to the inner membranes of E. coli (28Wada T. Long J.C. Zhang D. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17353-17357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The presence of toluene in the solution permeabilized the membrane and allowed MPB to biotinylate cysteines on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. There was one cysteine in the wild-type PlsY sequence at position 121. This cysteine was used in our analysis, but Cys-121 was mutated to serine for the analysis of the other constructs. Membranes prepared from E. coli expressing PlsY and PlsY[C121S] had same amount of PlsY as detected by immunoblot using anti-His antibody and showed no difference in their specific PlsY acyltransferase activity, illustrating that removal of Cys-121 did not affect the activity or membrane targeting of PlsY. We selected residues spaced along the PlsY sequence, postulated as being in the loop regions based on hydropathy analysis (Fig. 2A), and mutated them to cysteine in the PlsY[C121S] background. E. coli cells expressing these proteins were first treated with 10 mm dithiothreitol to ensure that all the exposed cysteines were in the reduced form. Dithiothreitol was then removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were labeled with 100 μm MPB in the presence or absence of toluene. PlsY[I2C], PlsY[H75C], and PlsY[I162C] were labeled by MPB in the absence of toluene, which placed these three residues in the extracellular space (Fig. 2B). PlsY[T39C], PlsY[K51C], PlsY[A105C], wildtype PlsY(C121), PlsY[G135C], and PlsY[A190C] showed toluene-dependent MPB labeling, which placed these residues in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B). The same amount of each PlsY mutant protein was present in each experiment as indicated by immunoblot analysis using anti-His antibody (Fig. 2B). Two other mutants (PlsY[I59C] and PlsY[I90C]) were generated that did not label with MPB either in the presence of absence of toluene (not shown). These results suggest that these residues were likely located in the membrane-spanning regions of PlsY and were not accessible to MPB either in the presence or absence of toluene (23Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 24Bogdanov M. Zhang W. Xie J. Dowhan W. Methods (San Diego). 2005; 36: 148-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Based on these data, the hydropathy analysis and a length of 22 residues for a transmembrane segment, the five membrane-spanning segments of PlsY were predicted to be located between residues 5-27, 52-74, 78-99, 139-161, and 163-184, three short regions exposed to the outside of the cell, and three cytoplasmic domains. However, the precise cutoff for the beginning end of each transmembrane domain cannot be determined from this data.There were no ambiguous results in the SCAM analysis, which indicated that >97% of the PlsY was in the same orientation in the membrane. The level of PlsY overexpression in the experimental system was modest. The specific activity of PlsY in S. pneumoniae membranes was 3.7 ± 0.1 pmol/min/μg. The PlsY specific activity in the E. coli expression system was 18.28 ± 1.49 pmol/min/μg, which was only 5-fold higher than found in native S. pneumoniae membranes. The topology is also consistent with the finding that amino-terminal Histagged PlsY did not assemble into the membrane. This was attributed to the inability to move the charged His tag through the bilayer to the extracellular face. This is why we used carboxyl-terminal His-tagged PlsY for all of our experiments.Kinetic Constants for PlsY—The activity of PlsY did not require divalent or monovalent cations, and the addition of 1 mm EDTA to the reaction did not affect its activity either. PlsY was active between pH 6.5 and 9.5 with maximal activity at pH 7.4 (data not shown). We determined the Km values for the two substrates of PlsY, glycerol-3-P and 16:0-PO4, using purified membranes from E. coli expressing S. pneumoniae PlsY. The apparent Km for glycerol-3-P was 100 μm (Fig. 3A) and for 16:0-PO4 was 30 μm (Fig. 3B), as calculated from the double reciprocal plot. These Km values are comparable with those of PlsB for glycerol-3-P and 16:0-CoA, which are 90 and 20 μm, respectively (9Rock C.O. Goelz S.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 736-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Kinetic constants for PlsY. Membranes from E. coli cells expressing S. pneumoniae PlsY were purified by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation; assay mixtures contained 0.2 μg of membrane protein and either 200 μm 16:0-PO4 (A) or 200 μm [14C]glycerol-3-P (B) with the indicated concentrations of glycerol-3-P (A) or 16:0-PO4 (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Three Conserved Sequence Motifs in PlsY—We aligned 417 PlsY sequences found in the Integrated Genomic Bacterial Database and identified three regions containing completely conserved amino acid sequences (Fig. 4). All three motifs were located in the cytoplasmic surface of PlsY based on the topology determination, and the high degree of conservation of these sequences suggests that they are critical to catalysis. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to analyze the effect of altering these conserved residues on PlsY activity with the goal of ascribing functions to each of the domains in this new acyltransferase superfamily of proteins. Each mutant protein was expressed in E. coli strain FB23281 (plsY::Tn5) to ablate background activity because of the low level of endogenous PlsY expression. The expression and assembly into membranes of each of the mutants was assessed by immunoblot analysis, which detected the carboxyl-terminal His tag in PlsY in membranes purified from cells expressing the mutant proteins. The biochemical activity of these mutant PlsY proteins in E. coli membranes was normalized to the amount of protein expression based on the Western blots (Fig. 5), analyzed, and compared with wild-type PlsY expression as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Table 1). Proteins scored as inactive had <0.05% of wild-type activity. This lower limit of detection was established from the highest amount of membrane protein that could be added to the assay without our detecting product formation.FIGURE 4Conserved PlsY sequence motifs. A total of 417 PlsY protein sequences were analyzed, and the frequencies of amino acid identity at a given position relative to the S. pneumoniae PlsY sequence were calculated. Three highly conserved intracellular sequence motifs were clearly evident. Residues with a frequency of occurrence over 75% are highlighted in black in the S. pneumoniae PlsY sequence shown below the graphical analysis. Motif 1 was located in the first cytoplasmic loop, motif 2 was located in the second cytoplasmic loop, and motif 3 was located in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Western blot analysis of the expression of a selected group of inactive PlsY mutants.

VDR is a member of the steroid hormone receptor/nuclear receptor superfamily. VDR and other steroid hormone receptors are classic, ligand-activated transcriptional regulatory proteins that control RNA polymerase II-directed transcription in response to a steroidal or other lipid ligand. The binding of 1,25(OH)2D3 induces a conformational change in VDR that is essential for high affinity interaction between VDR and its obligate heterodimeric partner, the retinoid X receptor (RXR) (1Kliewer S.A.

Cumulatively, these coactivators function through distinct mechanisms to promote VDR/RXR-mediated transcription. Synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D3 is a tightly controlled, multistep process involving several cytochrome P450 enzymes. The skin is a major source of vitamin D, where it is synthesized from its 7-dehydrocholesterol precursor upon exposure to UV light (12Jones G. Strugnell S.A. DeLuca H.F. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1193-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Vitamin D is also obtained from the diet. Bioactivation of vitamin D is accomplished through sequential hydroxylations (12Jones G. Strugnell S.A. DeLuca H.F. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1193-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). The first takes place in the liver, where vitamin D-25-hydroxylase catalyzes C-25 hydroxylation of vitamin D3, producing 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, the major circulating form of vitamin D in mammals (13Blunt J.W. Tanaka Y. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 717-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The second hydroxylation at C-1 of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 occurs primarily in renal tissues and is catalyzed by 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1α-hydroxylase (1αOHase) (14Gray R.W. Omdahl J.L. Ghazarian J.G. DeLuca H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7528-7532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The product is 1,25(OH)2D3, the hormonally active form of vitamin D. One of the best characterized target genes of 1,25(OH)2D3- and VDR-induced transcription is 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase (24OHase), a ubiquitously expressed enzyme that targets vitamin D metabolites for degradation and elimination (15Knutson J.C.

Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). 1,25(OH)2D3-induced expression of 24OHase and the resulting catabolism of the ligand is an important feedback component of the vitamin D endocrine system. Considerable insight into the physiological roles of the vitamin D endocrine system has come from the ongoing analysis of knock-out mouse models in which either the receptor (VDR) or the ligand (1,25(OH)2D3) has been eliminated.

As expected, these mice recapitulate the major symptoms of vitamin D deficiency and those of humans with inactivating mutations in VDR (hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets), namely hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, and the consequent skeletal anomalies, including rickets and osteomalacia. Mice lacking 1αOHase (i.e. the ligand knock-out mouse) exhibit mineral homeostasis phenotypes that are similar to VDRKO mice and that are also seen in a human genetic disorder termed pseudovitamin D deficiency rickets, a rare disease caused by mutations in the 1αOHase enzyme (20Panda D.K.

Res. 1997; 12: 1552-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a diet containing high amounts of calcium, phosphorus, and lactose corrects the undermineralized skeletal phenotype in both the VDRKO and 1αOHaseKO mice (23Li Y.C. Amling M. Pirro A.E. Priemel M. Meuse J. Baron R. Delling G. Demay M.B. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4391-4396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Dardenne O. Prud'homme J. Hacking S.A. Glorieux F.H. St-Arnaud R. Bone. 2003; 32: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), suggesting that the skeletal effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 and VDR may be indirect. An intriguing difference between the VDRKO and 1αOHaseKO mice is apparent in skin tissue. VDRKO mice develop their first coat of hair after birth, but hair follicle cycling ceases thereafter, leading to alopecia. Hair follicles degenerate into dermal cysts and utriculi (23Li Y.C. Amling M. Pirro A.E. Priemel M. Meuse J. Baron R. Delling G. Demay M.B. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4391-4396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the in vivo interfollicular keratinocyte proliferation rate of VDRKO mice is approximately twice the rate of wild type mice, and consequently, the epidermal thickness of VDRKO mice is double that of wild type controls (25Zinser G.M. Sundberg J.P. Welsh J. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 2103-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These anomalies are not corrected by a high calcium diet, indicating that they are due to direct actions of VDR in keratinocytes. In contrast, the skin and hair of 1αOHaseKO mice appears to be morphologically normal and exhibits only minor differences in expression of skin differentiation markers compared with wild type controls (26Bikle D.D. Chang S. Crumrine D. Elalieh H. Man M.Q. Choi E.H. Dardenne O. Xie Z. Arnaud R.S. Feingold K. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2004; 122: 984-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, in animals lacking the 1,25(OH)2D3 ligand, hair follicle cycling and keratinocyte proliferation are normal. These mouse models accurately mimic human skin disorders resulting from vitamin D endocrine system defects. Many, but not all, hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets patients that have inactivating mutations in VDR exhibit degenerated hair follicles and alopecia (27Bergman R. Schein-Goldshmid R. Hochberg Z. Ben-Izhak O. Sprecher E. Arch. Dermatol. 2005; 141: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), whereas vitamin D deficiency and pseudovitamin D deficiency rickets cause no obvious skin or hair defects. The striking phenotypic differences in the skin and hair of VDRKO and 1αOHaseKO mice strongly suggest that a novel, 1,25(OH)2D3-independent mechanism regulates VDR activity in the skin. This hypothesis is also supported by dietary deficiency studies in which long term maintenance of animals on vitamin D-deficient diets does not impact hair follicle cycling (28Sakai Y. Kishimoto J. Demay M.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Experiments in transgenic mice have localized the critical actions of VDR to epidermal keratinocytes, since targeted expression of VDR in this cell type is sufficient to rescue the skin phenotype of VDRKO mice (29Chen C.H. Sakai Y. Demay M.B. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 5386-5389Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of a ligand binding mutant of VDR (L233S) rescues hair follicle cycling, further indicating that maintenance of skin homeostasis requires VDR but not 1,25(OH)2D3 (30Skorija K. Cox M. Sisk J.M. Dowd D.R. MacDonald P.N. Thompson C.C. Demay M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These in vivo studies have led to the hypothesis that the actions of VDR in skin are independent of the 1,25(OH)2D3 ligand (30Skorija K. Cox M. Sisk J.M. Dowd D.R. MacDonald P.N. Thompson C.C. Demay M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, there is little experimental evidence directly supporting this hypothesis or illuminating the molecular mechanisms governing VDR transcriptional activity in the skin. In this report, we provide evidence for VDR-dependent and 1,25(OH)2D3-independent expression of 24-hydroxylase, a well characterized VDR target gene in primary keratinocytes. The ligand-independent activity of VDR in keratinocytes appears to stem from strong interactions between VDR and RXR, which occur in the absence of 1,25(OH)2D3. Plasmid Constructs—The VDRE4-TATA-Luc construct was described previously (31Ellison T.I. Dowd D.R. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2309-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The human 24-hydroxylase promoter (–1200 to +120 bp, relative to the transcriptional start site) was amplified from MCF-7 genomic DNA using PCR and the following primers: 5′-gcgcctcgagaccagggaaggatttgcc-3′ and 5′-gcgcaagctttgggatgcctcctgttgg-3′. The product was digested with XhoI and HindIII and inserted into the multiple cloning site of pGL3 basic (Promega, Madison, WI).

Demay (Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), respectively. Mouse genotyping was performed on tail DNA. The 1α-hydroxylase PCR primers 5′-gtcccagacagagacatccgt-3′ and 5′-gcacctggctcaggtagctcttc-3′ yield products of 986 base pairs (wild type allele) and 350 base pairs (targeted allele).

Cycling conditions consisted of 33 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were visualized on 2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Cell Culture and Transient Reporter Assays—Primary human keratinocytes and primary human fibroblasts were isolated from the foreskins of newborn donors. Skin was floated in keratinocyte-SFM (Invitrogen) with 5 units/ml Dispase II (Roche Applied Science), 10 units/ml penicillin G, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1.0 μg/ml Fungizone (Invitrogen) at 4 °C. Keratinocytes were isolated from the epidermal layer as described previously (34Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were isolated from the dermis. The dermis was minced with sterile scissors and digested in 0.35% collagenase I (Worthington) dissolved in DMEM (Invitrogen), shaking at 37 °C for 45 min. The cell suspension was centrifuged and resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml penicillin G, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) and then maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. HaCaT keratinocytes were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml penicillin G, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For transient transfection assays, primary human fibroblasts and HaCaT cells were grown in DMEM with 5% charcoal-stripped calf bovine serum, 10 units/ml penicillin G, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. Primary human keratinocytes were grown in keratinocyte-SFM with 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 30 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 10 units/ml penicillin G, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. HaCaT cells, primary human fibroblasts in passages 2–4, or primary human keratinocytes in passages 3–5 were seeded for reporter assays at a density of 3.2 × 104 cells/well in 12-well plates and transfected the next day with Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) diluted in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). 18 h later, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and media were replenished and supplemented with 1,25(OH)2D3,9-cis-retinoic acid, ethanol vehicle, or no additive as indicated. Following a 24-h incubation, cells were harvested in 150 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega). Cell extracts were analyzed for luciferase activity using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions and a LMax luminometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Primary mouse keratinocytes were isolated from 1–3-day-old pups essentially as described (35Caldelari R. Suter M.M. Baumann D. De Bruin A. Muller E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 1064-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, the skin was removed from pups and floated overnight in keratinocyte-SFM (Invitrogen) with 5 units/ml Dispase II (Roche Applied Science), 10 units/ml penicillin G, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1.0 μg/ml Fungizone (Invitrogen) at 4 °C. The epidermis was separated from the dermis and trypsinized in 0.05% trypsin (Invitrogen) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 4 min. Trypsin was inactivated by adding DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, and cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 25 °C. Cells were resuspended in growth media (keratinocyte-SFM with 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 30 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 10 units/ml penicillin G, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen)) and seeded in collagen I-coated plates. Keratinocytes were allowed to attach to plates overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and then cells were washed and media were replaced. Some keratinocytes were transfected with Fugene and Opti-MEM, as noted, and treated the next morning with 1,25(OH)2D3 or ethanol as indicated. Mouse dermal fibroblasts were isolated and cultured using the same conditions as primary human fibroblasts. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from mouse keratinocyte and fibroblast cultures using RNA Bee (Tel-test, Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was purified using RNeasy Plus Mini columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Five μg of purified RNA was reverse-transcribed using the Superscript III First-Strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) with the oligo(dT)20 primer. 24OHase transcripts were amplified by PCR using PCR Master Mix (Promega) and the primers 5′-ggagtccatgaggcttacc-3′ and 5′-gtcttcgctagagcccagc-3′, producing a product of 136 nucleotides. β-Actin transcripts were amplified with the primers 5′-aagatcctcaccgagcgcg-3′ and 5′-tggatgccacaggactccat-3′, producing a product of 254 nucleotides. Cycling conditions were 94 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. PCR products were visualized on 2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Evidence for 1,25(OH)2D3-independent Activation of the 24-Hydroxylase Promoter in Primary Human Keratinocytes—Similarities in the undermineralized phenotypes of the VDRKO and 1αOHaseKO mice highlight the essential roles that VDR and 1,25(OH)2D3 play in maintaining appropriate calcium and phosphate absorption in the intestine, but their prominent phenotypic differences in the skin provide compelling evidence for an uncoupling of VDR and its 1,25(OH)2D3 ligand in keratinocyte biology. However, direct evidence for 1,25(OH)2D3-independent actions of VDR in keratinocytes has not been forthcoming. To determine whether keratinocyte-derived VDR exhibits transcriptional activity that is independent of 1,25(OH)2D3, we transfected two highly responsive, VDR-activated promoter-reporter constructs into primary human keratinocytes, HaCaT immortalized keratinocytes, and primary human dermal fibroblasts, three cell types that have been previously characterized as VDR- and 1,25(OH)2D3-responsive. The VDRE4-TATA-Luc reporter contains four tandem copies of the VDRE from the rat osteocalcin gene fused to the minimal TATA box from the same gene, and it represents one of the most powerful and sensitive VDR-activated constructs of its kind in transfection assays. As shown in Fig. 1A, it was activated 3-fold by 1,25(OH)2D3 in the HaCaT cell line, but ectopic expression of VDR led to a profound 100-fold activation by 1,25(OH)2D3. In primary human fibroblasts, 1,25(OH)2D3 activated the consensus reporter 11-fold, and expression of VDR increased activation to 45-fold (Fig. 1B). In contrast, 1,25(OH)2D3 activated this reporter 1.6-fold in primary human keratinocytes, and surprisingly, ectopic expression of VDR increased the 1,25(OH)2D3 response by a comparatively modest factor of 3 (Fig. 1C). Western blot analysis of VDR protein levels in primary human and HaCaT keratinocytes showed comparable expression of the SG5-VDR vector that could not account for these observed differences in reporter gene activation (data not shown). These data indicate that 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent activation of VDR, as assessed with the synthetic VDRE4-TATA-luc reporter, is suppressed in primary human keratinocytes when compared with primary dermal fibroblasts and HaCaT keratinocytes. A second reporter tested contains the natural promoter and 1200 base pairs of upstream flanking sequence from the 24OHase gene, one of the most highly induced genes that is stimulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 and VDR in a variety of cell types. 1,25(OH)2D3 activated this reporter 23-fold in HaCaT cells (Fig. 1A), 8-fold in primary human fibroblasts (Fig. 1B), and 6-fold in primary human keratinocytes (Fig. 1C). Expression of additional VDR increased -fold activation by 1,25(OH)2D3 to 150-fold in HaCaT keratinocytes and 35-fold in primary human fibroblasts (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively). Surprisingly, when VDR was expressed in the primary human keratinocytes in the absence of the 1,25(OH)2D3 ligand, we observed a 7-fold increase in 24OHase promoter reporter gene expression compared with cells transfected with the SG5 vector control (Fig. 1C, open bars). This 1,25(OH)2D3-independent activity of VDR was not evident in the HaCaT immortalized keratinocytes and primary human fibroblasts (Fig. 1, A and B, open bars). These data indicate that in primary human keratinocytes, VDR possesses significant transactivation potential in the absence of its requisite 1,25(OH)2D3 ligand. VDR-induced Activation of the 24-Hydroxylase Promoter Is Not Due to Endogenous Production of 1,25(OH)2D3 by the 1α-Hydroxylase Enzyme—The skin is the only organ of the human body capable of synthesizing 1,25(OH)2D3 from its 7-dehydrocholesterol precursor, and 1,25(OH)2D3 is known to be produced from 25-OHD3 in cultured primary human keratinocytes (36Bikle D.D. Nemanic M.K. Whitney J.O. Elias P.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1545-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). 1α-Hydroxylase catalyzes 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis, and some evidence exists for its expression in keratinocytes (37Fu G.K. Lin D. Zhang M.Y. Bikle D.D. Shackleton C.H. Miller W.L. Portale A.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1961-1970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the possibility that VDR activation may result from endogenous production of 1,25(OH)2D3, the 24-hydroxylase promoter was transfected into wild type and 1αOHaseKO primary mouse keratinocytes. VDR activated the 24-hydroxylase reporter to similar extents in both wild type and 1αOHaseKO keratinocytes (Fig. 2A). These data indicate that local production of 1,25(OH)2D3 by the CYP27 gene product is not the basis for the activity observed in these studies. 1α-Hydroxylase is the only known enzyme that catalyzes 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis (38Miller W.L. Portale A.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 315-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), but the possibility exists that 1,25(OH)2D3 is synthesized by an alternate pathway in keratinocytes. However, mammalian one-hybrid analysis using Gal4-VDR and a Gal4-responsive reporter (Gal45-TATA-Luc) gene argues against this possibility. Gal4-VDR is a highly sensitive 1,25(OH)2D3-activated fusion protein that consists of the VDR ligand binding domain (amino acids 93–427) and the heterologous Gal4 DNA binding domain. 1,25(OH)2D3 strongly activated this Gal4-VDR fusion protein in primary human keratinocytes (Fig. 2B). However, the Gal4-VDR fusion displayed no inherent transactivation potential in"
https://openalex.org/W2003487209,"BACKGROUND/ABSTRACT: Immune responses initiated by T cell receptor (TCR) and costimulatory molecule mediated signaling culminate in maximal cytokine mRNA production and stability. The transcriptional responses to co-stimulatory T cell signalling involve calcineurin and NF-AT, which can be antagonized by interference with the cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIase), cyclophilin A and FKBP. Signalling molecules downstream of CD28 which are essential for the stabilization of cytokine mRNAs are largely unknown.We now show that Pin1, a third member of the PPIase family mediates the post-transcriptional regulation of Th1 cytokines by activated T cells. Blockade of Pin1 by pharmacologic or genetic means greatly attenuated IFN-gamma, IL-2 and CXCL-10 mRNA stability, accumulation and protein expression after cell activation. In vivo, Pin1 blockade prevented both the acute and chronic rejection of MHC mismatched, orthotopic rat lung transplants by reducing the expression of IFN-gamma and CXCL-10. Combined transcriptional and post-transcriptional blockade with cyclosporine A and the Pin1 inhibitor, juglone, was synergistic.These data suggest Pin1 inhibitors should be explored for use as immunosuppressants and employed with available calcineurin inhibitors to reduce toxicity and enhance effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W1993282994,"The developmentally important Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction pathway, which has recently been implicated in several forms of cancer, is subject to regulation by several protein kinases. Here, we address the role of protein kinase Cδ in pathway inhibition and show that cellular depletion or pharmacological inhibition of this kinase isoform results in a blockade of signalling between Suppressor of Fused and the Gli transcription factors. We further provide evidence that the observed pathway inhibition is independent of primary cilia and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (Mek1) kinase. These findings allowed for the rapid dissection of downstream Hh pathway activation mechanisms in human tumour cells and demonstrate a surprising variation in how cells can activate signalling in a ligand- and receptor-independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2064634712,"Patched1 (PTCH1) is one of the key molecules involved in the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway and acts as the receptor of HH ligands. Additionally, PTCH1 inhibits the positive signal transductor Smoothened (SMO). Several PTCH1 splice variants are known but the functional differences among them are not clear. Here, we demonstrate the unique biological properties of the PTCH1 isoforms generated by alternative first exon usage. All isoforms examined worked as functional receptors of both Sonic HH and Desert HH. However, the signaling upregulated isoforms PTCH1-1B and -1C inhibited SMO and the pathway transcription factors glioma 1 (GLI1) and GLI2 to a higher extent than PTCH1-1 and -1Ckid. Moreover, in situ hybridizations allowed the detection of the Ptch1 isoforms in specific structures of the developing mouse embryo. Additionally, the differences in the N-terminal tail had a dramatic influence on the steady states of the proteins, with PTCH1-1B and -1C levels being significantly higher than PTCH1-1 and -1Ckid. This implies that the pronounced signaling inhibitory properties of PTCH1-1B and -1C may be mostly due to this high-protein expression rather than to intrinsic functional differences. Thus, our study supports a role of splicing variation and promoter choice for HH signaling regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2162370807,"Cyclin D1 regulates G1 cell-cycle progression and is aberrantly expressed in carcinogenesis. Proteasomal degradation of cyclin D1 was highlighted as a cancer chemopreventive mechanism. To understand this mechanism better, residues responsible for degradation and ubiquitination of cyclin D1 were investigated. Eighteen lysines in cyclin D1 had single, double or multiple mutations engineered before transfection into BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells to evaluate stabilities after all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) or cycloheximide treatments. Specific mutations stabilized cyclin D1, including substitutions of lysines surrounding the cyclin box domain that inhibited RA-mediated degradation and extended the cyclin D1 half-life. Mutation of all cyclin D1 lysines blocked polyubiquitination. N-terminus (but not C-terminus) modification stabilized cyclin D1. Ubiquitination-resistant mutants preferentially localized cyclin D1 to the nucleus, directly implicating subcellular localization in regulating cyclin D1 degradation. Taken together, these findings uncover specific residues conferring ubiquitination of cyclin D1. These provide a mechanistic basis for proteasomal degradation of cyclin D1."

https://openalex.org/W1979795377,"Proteasomes are known to produce major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ligands from endogenous antigens. The interferon-γ-inducible proteasome activator PA28 plays an important role in the generation of MHC ligands by proteasomes. Generation of the HLA-A*0201 restricted melanoma antigen TRP2360–368 by the proteasome has been shown to be dependent on the function of PA28 in vitro and in vivo (Sun, Y., Sijts, A. J., Song, M., Janek, K., Nussbaum, A. K., Kral, S., Schirle, M., Stevanovic, S., Paschen, A., Schild, H., Kloetzel, P. M., and Schadendorf, D. (2002) Cancer Res. 62, 2875–2882). Here we analyzed the role of the epitope sequence environment in determining this PA28 dependence. Experiments using the melanoma TRP2288–296 epitope and the murine cytomegalovirus-derived pp89 epitope precursor peptide for epitope replacement revealed that the TRP2360–368 flanking sequences can transfer PA28 dependence onto otherwise PA28 independent epitopes. Moreover, the N-terminal flanking sequence is sufficient to establish PA28 dependence of an epitope by allowing PA28-induced coordinated dual cleavages. These results show that N-terminal flanking sequences strongly influence epitope generation efficiency and that PA28 function is particularly relevant for the generation of normally poorly excised peptide products. Proteasomes are known to produce major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ligands from endogenous antigens. The interferon-γ-inducible proteasome activator PA28 plays an important role in the generation of MHC ligands by proteasomes.

Experiments using the melanoma TRP2288–296 epitope and the murine cytomegalovirus-derived pp89 epitope precursor peptide for epitope replacement revealed that the TRP2360–368 flanking sequences can transfer PA28 dependence onto otherwise PA28 independent epitopes. Moreover, the N-terminal flanking sequence is sufficient to establish PA28 dependence of an epitope by allowing PA28-induced coordinated dual cleavages. These results show that N-terminal flanking sequences strongly influence epitope generation efficiency and that PA28 function is particularly relevant for the generation of normally poorly excised peptide products.

The ubiquitin-proteasome system represents the major source for MHC class I-presented peptides exposed to CD8+ T cells (1Princiotta M.F. Finzi D. Qian S.B. Gibbs J. Schuchmann S. Buttgereit F. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Immunity. 2003; 18: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-proteasome system-mediated peptide generation is influenced by structural changes in the 20S catalytic core (20S proteasome), which occur by exchange of the standard catalytic subunits by immunosubunits. The ATP-dependent 26S proteasome, composed of a 20S core and a 19S regulatory complex, recognizes substrates by a multi-ubiquitin signal. In contrast, 20S proteasomes can accept larger non-ubiquitinated peptides as substrates for ATP-independent degradation (3Stohwasser R. Holzhutter H.G. Lehmann U. Henklein P. Kloetzel P.M. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, 20S proteasomes exist in a latent state within the cells. In consequence, proteasome activity and function is regulated in part by modulating substrate entry by the PA28 complex, which attaches ATP-independent to the outer α-rings of the 20S proteasome. Detailed kinetic analysis using fluorogenic peptide substrates has shown that activation of the 20S proteasome by PA28 occurs by facilitating either substrate entry and/or product exit, with no effects on the active sites (3Stohwasser R. Holzhutter H.G. Lehmann U. Henklein P. Kloetzel P.M. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In support, structural analyses have demonstrated that attachment of the activator to the 20S core leads to the opening of the central gate of the α-ring (4Hill C.P. Masters E.I. Whitby F.G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 268: 73-89PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of PA28 is constitutively enhanced in cells with specialized antigen-presenting function and is induced by stimulation of cells with interferon-γ. The presentation of a number of viral MHC class I epitopes is enhanced in the presence of PA28 (5Groettrup M. Ruppert T. Kuehn L. Seeger M. Standera S. Koszinowski U. Kloetzel P.M. J. Biol.

Med. 2000; 192: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Moreover, the action of PA28 appears to be independent of the presence of immunosubunits in the 20S core (7Schwarz K. Eggers M.

In vitro digestion experiments performed by incubating epitope-containing peptides with 20S proteasomes in PA28 presence resulted in an immediate liberation of PA28-dependent epitopes (8Dick T.P.

The conclusion drawn from these experiments was that PA28 changes the cleavage behavior of the 20S core in a characteristic manner; without PA28 the proteasome cuts substrates by consecutive and independent single cleavages, whereas association with PA28 results in a strong enhancement of proteasomal double cleavages and an accelerated liberation of MHC class I ligands or their precursors (8Dick T.P. Ruppert T. Groettrup M. Kloetzel P.M. Kuehn L. Koszinowski U.H. Stevanovic S. Schild H. Rammensee H.G.

Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 785-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A striking example of PA28 action that stand in contrast to the above findings has been provided recently by our analysis of two cytotoxic lymphocyte epitopes, TRP2288–296 and TRP2360–368, derived from the melanoma differentiation antigen TRP2 (tyrosine-related protein 2) (11Sun Y. Sijts A.J. Song M. Janek K. Nussbaum A.K. Kral S. Schirle M. Stevanovic S. Paschen A. Schild H. Kloetzel P.M. Schadendorf D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2875-2882PubMed Google Scholar). Melanoma cell lines presented the former epitope, but three of them showed a dramatically diminished presentation of the latter epitope. Interferon-γ treatment restored the presentation of TRP2360–368 on all melanoma cell lines but one, Mel18, which was completely unable to present this TRP2-derived peptide. Analysis showed that the expression of PA28 was strongly impaired in Mel18 cells. Consequently, TRP2360–368 epitope presentation and specific cytotoxic lymphocyte lysis was completely restored by transfection with PA28 cDNAs. Importantly, in vitro experiments with purified 20S proteasomes, PA28, and a synthetic peptide harboring the TRP2360–368 epitope were able to mimic the in vivo situation and revealed that the presence of PA28 resulted in production of the TRP2 epitope and an N-terminally extended precursor peptide. The generation and presentation of the second epitope, TRP2288–296, did not correlate with the presence of PA28. Thus PA28 in some cases appears to be able to alter the immunological phenotype of a cell by inducing subtle structural changes in the 20S proteasomes that allow the generation and presentation of normally hidden epitopes. So far it is not known what determines the PA28 dependence of an epitope, raising the question of whether the TRP2360–368 epitope and the polypeptide domain that harbors this epitope possess distinct characteristics that determine their complete PA28 dependence. Our experiments now demonstrate that the flanking N-terminal sequences can determine either the PA28 dependence or independence of proteasomal MHC class I epitope generation. Peptides—Peptides were synthesized using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) methodology (0.1 mmol) on an Applied Biosystems 433A automated synthesizer. The peptides were purified by HPLC and analyzed by mass spectrometry (ABI Voyager DE PRO). The peptide sequences are shown in Figs. 3A,4A, and 5.FIGURE 4The permissive N-terminal flanking sequence is responsible for enhanced peptide liberation, but it abolishes the PA28 dependence of proteasomal cleavage. A, the pp89 precursor peptide was inserted in the permissive TRP2283–309 region. Additionally, peptides were generated in which the C-terminal flanking sequence of TRP2288–296 was exchanged against the C-terminal region of the nonpermissive C-terminal sequence (TRP2 N283–287C369–378 pp89ins) or in which the C-terminal sequences were deleted (TRP2 N283–287ΔC10pp89ins).

Peptide Analysis and Quantification—Samples were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC, using an HP1100 system (Hewlett-Packard) equipped with an RPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 column (GE Healthcare). Analysis was performed on line with a LCQ ion trap MS equipped with an electrospray ion source (ThermoQuest, Germany) (11Sun Y. Sijts A.J. Song M. Janek K. Nussbaum A.K. Kral S. Schirle M.

Spectra of both peptides (1.5 mg dissolved in 80 μl) were recorded at 298 K and 600.03 MHz on a Bruker Avance 600 NMR spectrometer equipped with a 2.5-mm micro probe head (Bruker Biospin GmbH). The 1H spectra were internally referenced to D4-TSP. TOCSY spectra were recorded with mixing times of 80 ms, NOESY spectra with mixing times of 180 and 250 ms. Each two-dimensional experiment was processed with standard Bruker software (Topspin). Structure Calculations—The data derived from NMR spectra were analyzed via restrained molecular dynamics (rMD) simulations using XPLOR-NIH on a SUSE linux PC (14Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 66-74Crossref Scopus (1825) Google Scholar). Distance restraints (220 for TRP2350–378 pp89ins and 195 for TRP2283–309pp89ins) were generated from analysis of 1H NOESY experiments. For each peptide 50 starting structures were generated by randomizing the atom coordinates of peptide models followed by 1000 step Powell energy minimization. All structures were submitted to an 18-ps rMD calculation in conjunction with a simulated annealing procedure. The 10 structures with the lowest total energy were submitted to an additional 90-ps rMD simulation at 300 K. To test the PA28 dependence of epitope generation synthetic 29-mer and 27-mer polypeptides harboring either the TRP2360–368 or the TRP2288–296 MHC class I epitope, respectively, were processed in vitro by standard proteasomes (20S proteasomes) in the absence or presence of purified PA28. Generated MHC class I ligands or their precursor peptides were detected by mass spectrometry. In perfect agreement with the situation in melanoma cells (11Sun Y. Sijts A.J. Song M. Janek K. Nussbaum A.K. Kral S. Schirle M. Stevanovic S. Paschen A. Schild H. Kloetzel P.M. Schadendorf D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2875-2882PubMed Google Scholar), generation of the TRP2288–296 peptide was completely independent of PA28 presence. In contrast, the TRP2360–368 epitope was generated only in PA28 presence (Fig. 1A). We detected both, the TRP2356–368 epitope precursor and the TRP2360–368 epitope in those experiments, although the latter at very low quantity. Remarkably, generation of both fragments essentially required the presence of PA28. These data raised the question of whether the epitopes themselves and/or their flanking sequences determine the observed requirement for PA28 activity. To answer this query, we performed epitope switching experiments in which TRP2360–368 was inserted into the potentially permissive (PA28-independent) TRP2283–309 sequence, and vice versa, TRP2288–296 was inserted into the potentially nonpermissive (PA28-dependent) sequence of TRP2350–378 (Fig. 1B). Insertion of TRP2288–296 epitope into in the “nonpermissive” TRP2350–378 context resulted in complete PA28 dependence of TRP2288–296 generation. In contrast, the PA28-dependent TRP2360–368 epitope became PA28-independent when inserted into the “permissive” context of TRP2283–309. Therefore we concluded that PA28 dependence on or independence of the two TRP2 epitopes is determined by their flanking sequences and that by inserting either epitope into a nonpermissive or permissive sequence context, PA28 dependence can be altered. Although the above experiments suggested that the flanking sequences might harbor the information for PA28 dependence, a possible functional interaction between the epitopes and their surrounding sequence context could not be excluded. Therefore, we replaced both TRP2 epitopes by an entirely different sequence representing the relevant 11-mer precursor peptide of the murine cytomegalovirus IEpp89166–176 epitope (15Knuehl C. Spee P. Ruppert T. Kuckelkorn U. Henklein P. Neefjes J. Kloetzel P.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This well studied antigenic peptide is efficiently generated in vitro by c20S and is well detectable by mass spectrometry (8Dick T.P. Ruppert T. Groettrup M. Kloetzel P.M. Kuehn L. Koszinowski U.H. Stevanovic S. Schild H. Rammensee H.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Integration of the pp89 precursor peptide into the nonpermissive TRP2350–378 sequence context (TRP2350–378 pp89ins) resulted in complete PA28 dependence of its generation (Fig. 2A). In contrast, insertion of the pp89 sequence into the permissive TRP2283–309 (TRP2283–309pp89ins) rendered the generation of the precursor peptide completely PA28-independent (Fig. 2B). From these experiments we concluded that the information for PA28 dependence can be transferred onto other antigenic peptides and that the flanking sequences of the TRP2360–368 epitope determine their PA28 dependence. Furthermore, there exists no obvious functional interaction between the epitope sequence and the surrounding sequence context with regard to PA28 requirement. To further study the influence of the flanking regions on PA28 dependence for proteasomal processing, the peptide TRP2350–378pp89ins was modified by truncations of the N- and C-terminal flanking regions and analyzed as above (Fig. 3A). Partial truncation of the N-terminal flanking sequence (TRP2350–378ΔN5pp89ins) preserved PA28 dependence, although the efficiency of epitope liberation was slightly reduced (Fig. 3B). Similarly, partial truncation of the C-terminal flanking region (TRP2350–378ΔC5pp89ins), or truncation of both terminal flanking sequences by 5 residues (TRP2350–378ΔN5/ΔC5pp89ins), did not affect PA28 dependence. Nevertheless, the efficiency of epitope precursor generation from the latter peptide was diminished in the presence of PA28, most likely because of the shortening of the flanking sequences (9Shimbara N. Nakajima H. Tanahashi N. Ogawa K. Niwa S. Uenaka A. Nakayama E. Tanaka K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 785-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Neither complete truncation of the C-terminal flanking residues from the TRP2/pp89 hybrid sequence (TRP2350–378ΔC10pp89ins) nor its truncation from the original human TRP2 polypeptide (TRP2350–378ΔC10wt) abolished the PA28-dependent liberation of the precursor peptides (Fig. 3C). In both cases PA28 was essential for antigenic peptide liberation. However, Complete truncation of the N-terminal flanking sequence, i.e. TRP2350–378ΔN10pp89ins, abolished PA28 dependence and led to a dramatically increased efficiency of the precursor peptide liberation. These data strongly suggest that the N-terminal flanking region of the human PA28-dependent TRP2360–368 epitope is predominantly responsible for the PA28-dependent epitope liberation and that the C-terminal flanking sequences have only a minor influence. In support of this conclusion, the combination of the N-terminal flanking region of PA28-independent TRP2288–296 with the C-terminal flanking region of the PA28-dependent TRP2360–368 epitope (TRP2 N283–287C369–378pp89ins) resulted in a strikingly improved liberation of the epitope precursor peptide and abrogated PA28 dependence (Fig. 4). The presence of PA28 affected epitope precursor liberation only slightly. These data therefore complement the experiments shown in Fig. 3C for TRP2350–378ΔN10pp89ins and demonstrate that the N-terminal flanking sequence plays a pivotal role in the determination of PA28 dependence of an epitope. Accordingly, the presence of the permissive N-terminal flanking sequence as in TRP2 N283–287ΔC13pp89ins revealed a complete PA28 independence of pp89 precursor peptide liberation (Fig. 4B). To study the effects of PA28 on proteasomal cleavage site preference within the permissive and nonpermissive peptide substrates, the generated fragments from different processing experiments were analyzed in detail. Frequent cleavage sites or sites used to generate large amounts of specific fragments are marked by arrows (Fig. 5). The carboxyl site of the C-terminal leucine residue of the pp89 insert represents the predominant proteasomal cleavage site, both in the presence and absence of PA28. Remarkably, the N-terminal site required for liberation of the pp89 11-mer precursor was used predominantly in the presence PA28 (Fig. 5, A–D). The 11-mer precursor was efficiently generated despite a strong PA28-induced cleavage within the epitope (Fig. 5, A and C). Thus, in a nonpermissive context (Fig. 5, A–C) PA28 appears to favor the additional and preferential usage of a cleavage site at the N terminus of that potential antigenic peptide whereas the already strong C-terminal cleavage was not significantly affected by PA28. These observations raise the question of whether there are defined structures within the TRP2350–378 peptide domain that are responsible for its PA28 sensitivity. Thus both TRP2-derived peptides with the same insert, i.e. TRP2283–309pp89ins (Fig. 6A) and TRP2350–378pp89ins (Fig. 6B), were analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. However, the spectra of the two peptides exhibited similar characteristics. The 1H chemical shift values of most of the amino acids of both peptides correspond to the tabulated proton shifts of random coil proteins (16Gross K.-H. Kalbitzer H.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1988; 76: 87-99Google Scholar). Amino acid side chains are obviously exposed to the same solvent environment. The absence of medium- and long-range nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) indicates that no helices or β-sheets are present. Furthermore, there was no hint for β-turns formed by proline. When energy-preferred states of the 29- and 31-mer peptide, respectively, were calculated and overlaid (shown for each three states), no defined structure elements were found, suggesting that structural features do not play an important determining role in the recognition, binding, and processing of peptide substrates by the proteasome-PA28 complex. Previously we reported that the proteasomal liberation and consequent MHC class I presentation of the TRP2360–368 epitope from the tyrosinase-related protein 2 in human melanocytes essentially requires the function of PA28 (11Sun Y. Sijts A.J. Song M. Janek K. Nussbaum A.K. Kral S. Schirle M. Stevanovic S. Paschen A. Schild H. Kloetzel P.M. Schadendorf D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2875-2882PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the flanking sequences of the melanoma TRP2360–368 antigen can transfer PA28 dependence onto otherwise PA28-independent human and viral epitopes and, importantly, that the proximal N-terminal flanking residues of the TRP2360–368 epitope alone are sufficient to determine PA28 dependence of epitope generation. Fusion of the TRP2360–368 epitope with the N-terminal flanking sequence of a PA28-independent TRP2 epitope however rendered the TRP2360–368 epitope completely PA28 independent. Considering what is known about the action of PA28 on the proteasome, this is a surprising and completely unexpected result. X-ray structure analysis had shown that trypanosomal PA26 opens the central gate within the yeast proteasome α-ring (4Hill C.P. Masters E.I. Whitby F.G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 268: 73-89PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently it was proposed that such an open conformation would allow the release of slightly longer N-terminally extended peptides presumed to be more adapted to support antigen presentation. In addition, detailed biochemical analysis of the effect of PA28 on proteasomal cleavage properties in connection with epitope liberation suggested that PA28 induced coordinated, dual cleavages for enhanced epitope generation (8Dick T.P. Ruppert T. Groettrup M. Kloetzel P.M. Kuehn L. Koszinowski U.H. Stevanovic S. Schild H. Rammensee H.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these and other studies also emphasize that PA28 action, while enhancing epitope liberation, does not induce the usage of entirely new cleavage sites by the proteasome. The two models, i.e. gating and dual cleavage, may in fact complement each other and are sufficient to explain the enhanced PA28-induced liberation of MHC class I epitopes or their precursor peptides, which are already generated in the absence of PA28 from a permissive sequence context, albeit in lower amounts. However, neither model alone or in combination appears to offer a solution for the PA28 effect observed in connection with the TRP2360–368 epitope. TRP2360–368 epitope liberation appears to be exceptional in comparison with all of the other PA28-induced epitopes described thus far in that it is embedded into a nonpermissive sequence context that prohibits its liberation by the proteasome in the absence of PA28. Our epitope switching experiments now have shown for the first time that the flanking sequences of TRP2360–368 can be used to transfer PA28 dependence onto another TRP2 epitope as well as to the viral murine cytomegalovirus-derived pp89 epitope. These data are interesting for three reasons. First, they exclude the previously likely possibility that PA28 dependence is due to a cross-talk between a specific epitope sequence and the surrounding sequence environment. Secondly, they demonstrate that PA28 dependence is determined by the flanking sequence, and thirdly they show that this nonpermissive sequence context may be used more generally for experiments in which epitope generation occurs only under PA28-controlled conditions. A considerable number of examples show that the sequence environment of the epitope can influence its relative generation efficiency by proteasomes (17Ossendorp F. Eggers M. Neisig A. Ruppert T.

Melief C.J. Ossendorp F. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1898-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Also, it is well established that predominantly the C-terminal flanking residues or the flanking sequences of an epitope determine the efficiency of proteasomal antigen generation. Hence, for viral HCV NS3 and murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-derived epitopes as well as for a human p53 tumor epitope it has been demonstrated that the C-terminal flanking residues determine the epitope liberation efficiency by the proteasome (19Seifert U. Liermann H. Racanelli V. Halenius A. Wiese M. Wedemeyer H. Ruppert T. Rispeter K. Henklein P. Sijts A. Hengel H. Kloetzel P.M. Rehermann B. J. Clin.

Koszinowski U.H. Kloetzel P.M. Sherman L.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is generally accepted that proteasomal cleavage at the N terminus of an epitope is less well defined and of limited importance. In this context, our experiments in which the C-terminal flanking sequences were deleted as in TRP2350–378ΔC10pp89ins and TRP2350–378ΔC10 wild type are striking in that they demonstrate that PA28 dependence is solely provided by the proximal N-terminal residues of the TRP2360–368 epitope. In support, fusion of the permissive N-terminal residues from the TRP288–296 epitope, as in TRP2 N283–287C369–378 pp89ins, resolves PA28 dependence and results in an extremely efficient generation of the epitope precursor peptide. How then can the functional predominance of the nonpermissive or the permissive N-terminal flanking sequences be explained? A possibility to consider is that the flanking N-terminal regions provide specific structural features that either prohibit or allow proteasomal cleavage. However, NMR studies of the different polypeptides provided no evidence for structural specificities either in the C-terminal or the N-terminal flanking regions of the inserted epitope. In contrast, cleavage product analysis revealed that proteasomal cleavage near the correct N terminus of the epitope or epitope precursor is strongly impaired in the presence of a nonpermissive N terminus, whereas the opposite is true for the permissive N terminus. In consequence, the function of PA28 may be 2-fold. First of all, our data demonstrate that PA28 supports the efficient usage of a cleavage site in the nonpermissive N-terminal region of a substrate, and thus they extend the previous dual coordinated cleavage hypothesis formulated for PA28 action epitope generation in a permissive sequence environment. Furthermore, our experiments essentially demand that binding of PA28 to the 20S proteasomes not only opens the gate but also induces subtle structural changes onto the 20S proteasome. These could affect the channeling of the substrate within the catalytic cavity and allow docking of the N-terminal residues of the TRP2360–368 epitope close to an active site within the inner β-rings, thus permitting the use of new cleavage sites within the otherwise nonpermissive sequence context of the proteasome."

In this report, we investigated the functional significance of the interaction between INT6 and MCM7, which was observed in a two-hybrid screen performed with INT6 as bait. It was found that proteasome inhibition strengthens interaction between both proteins and that INT6 stabilizes MCM7. Removal of MCM7 from chromatin as replication proceeds was accelerated in INT6-silenced cells and reduced amounts of protein were transiently observed, followed by a correction resulting from stimulation of mcm7 gene expression. Synchronized cells depleted for either INT6 or MCM7 display a reduction in thymidine incorporation and a reinforced association of RPA and claspin with chromatin. These data show that INT6 stabilizes chromatin-bound MCM7 and that alteration of this effect is associated with replication deficiency."

ParB binds several copies of two distinct recognition motifs, known as A- and B-boxes, which flank a bend in parS created by IHF binding. The recent crystal structure of ParB bound to a partial parS site revealed two relatively independent DNA-binding domains and raised the question of how a dimer of ParB recognizes its complicated arrangement of recognition motifs when it loads onto the full parS site in the presence of IHF. In this study, we addressed this question by examining ParB binding activities to parS mutants containing different combinations of the A- and B-box motifs in parS. Binding was measured to linear and supercoiled DNA in electrophoretic and filter binding assays, respectively. ParB showed preferences for certain motifs that are dependent on position and on plasmid topology. In the simplest arrangement, one motif on either side of the bend was sufficient to form a complex, although affinity differed depending on the motifs. Therefore, a ParB dimer can load onto parS in different ways, so that the initial ParB-IHF-parS complex consists of a mixture of different orientations of ParB. This arrangement supports a model in which parS motifs are available for interas well as intramolecular parS recognition.

In bacterial cells, the dynamic localization of low copy number plasmids is directed by their partition systems, which ensure the proper segregation and thus stable inheritance of these plasmids in growing cell populations. The P1 plasmid exists as a stable, autonomously replicating, low copy number plasmid in Escherichia coli, and its partition system has served as a paradigm for homologous systems found in many naturally occurring bacterial plasmids as well as several bacterial chromosomes (reviewed in Refs. 1Hayes F. Barilla D. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar and 2Funnell B.E. Slavcev R.A. Funnell B.E. Phillips G.J. Plasmid Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2004: 81-103Google Scholar). These partition systems typically consist of two proteins, ParA and ParB, that act on a plasmid partition site, parS (P1 nomenclature). The partition reaction occurs through a series of DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions that lead to P1 plasmid localization within an E. coli cell. ParB acts as the key partition site binding protein (3Davis M.A. Austin S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Funnell B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6657-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). ParB initially loads onto parS as a dimer and then recruits multiple dimers to form a large nucleoprotein complex, which is proposed to mediate P1 plasmid pairing through ParB-ParB interactions (5Bouet J.-Y. Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8213-8219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 6Erdmann N. Petroff T. Funnell B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ParA is an ATPase that interacts with this complex and through an unknown process, mediates the specific localization of P1 plasmids (6Erdmann N. Petroff T. Funnell B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14905-14910Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8Davis M.A. Radnedge L. Martin K.A. Hayes F. Youngren B. Austin S.J. Mol.

Microbiol. 2002; 46: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The only host factor known to participate in P1 partition is E. coli integration host factor (IHF), 2The abbreviations used are: IHF, integration host factor; HTH, helix-turn-helix. which assists ParB in the initial DNA binding step by greatly increasing the affinity of ParB for parS (4Funnell B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6657-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). ParB is an unusual site-specific DNA-binding protein in that it recognizes two distinct sequence motifs, called A-boxes (ATTTCAA/C) and B-boxes (TCGCCA), in parS (11Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Funnell B.E. Gagnier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3616-3624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are multiple copies of these boxes in parS, and they are asymmetrically arranged around an IHF binding site (Fig. 1). The spacing and orientation of these binding motifs are critical for complex formation in vitro as well as parS activity in vivo (12Funnell B.E. Gagnier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3616-3624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hayes F. Austin S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). IHF bends parS, which allows ParB to contact its specific binding motifs flanking the bend, resulting in a high-affinity protein-DNA complex. In the absence of IHF, ParB binds specifically but more weakly to parS and requires only the right half of parS for activity. In vivo, a 22-bp sequence on the right side of parS (boxes A2-A3-B2, called parS-small in Fig. 1) is sufficient but not optimal for partition (14Martin K.A. Davis M.A. Austin S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3630-3634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The optimal parS site extends from box B1 to box B2 and requires IHF. All motifs except boxes A1 and A4 are necessary for wild-type parS activity in vivo (11Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Funnell B.E. Gagnier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3616-3624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hayes F. Austin S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, the position and orientation of boxes A1 and A4 have been conserved in a variety of related parS sites (2Funnell B.E. Slavcev R.A. Funnell B.E. Phillips G.J. Plasmid Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2004: 81-103Google Scholar). Biochemical assays have shown that the C-terminal half of ParB (residues 142–333) contains all of the information necessary to form the dimeric, high-affinity (IHF-stimulated) ParB complex at parS (15Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12385-12394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of ParB-(142–333) bound to a 25-bp DNA duplex containing the parS-small sequence has been determined (16Schumacher M.A. Funnell B.E. Nature. 2005; 438: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). ParB contains two essentially independent DNA-binding domains (a helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain between residues 147–270 and a dimer domain between residues 275 and 333) separated by a short (4-residue) flexible linker. This arrangement permits ParB to contact a variety of A- and B-box combinations within parS. As functional studies predicted, the crystal structure of ParB-(142–333) confirms that the HTH motif binds the A-boxes within parS and the dimerization domain binds the B-boxes (15Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12385-12394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Schumacher M.A. Funnell B.E. Nature. 2005; 438: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 17Radnedge L. Davis M.A. Austin S.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Hayes F. Radnedge L. Davis M.A. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 11: 249-260Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The dimerization interaction creates a novel DNA binding motif that requires contributions from each monomer to bind a box B sequence. The arrangement of the HTH motifs is unusual in that they are on opposite sides of the dimer pointing away from each other so they cannot simultaneously contact a single inverted repeat. In fact, one ParB dimer contacts its different motifs on separate copies of the same 25-mer parS-small oligonucleotide, effectively bridging different DNA molecules. The bridging activity illustrates how ParB might contact separate motifs intramolecularly across an IHF-directed bend but also suggests that it may participate in pairing plasmids intermolecularly across parS sites (16Schumacher M.A. Funnell B.E. Nature. 2005; 438: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We were interested in how ParB contacts the parS site, particularly across the IHF-directed bend and potentially across adjacent DNA molecules. Chemical footprinting experiments have shown that all A- and B-boxes within parS are protected by a dimer of ParB (5Bouet J.-Y. Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8213-8219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but the crystal structure implies that one dimer cannot contact all motifs simultaneously (16Schumacher M.A. Funnell B.E. Nature. 2005; 438: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this study we examined how a dimer of ParB recognizes the parS site. Do the different A- and B-boxes work together in providing a high-affinity binding site for ParB, or is there a distinct set of ParB-IHF-parS complexes that uses specific A- and B-box combinations? Does ParB have a binding preference for specific A- or B-boxes within parS? To address these questions, variants of parS were created with A- and B-boxes systematically mutated individually or in combination with each other. We found that ParB prefers different subsets of motifs when it initially binds to parS. Our results support the model that the arrangement of recognition motifs in parS is necessary to build the proper architecture of partition complexes at and across partition sites. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli strain DH5 (F– endA1 hsdR17 (rK– mK+) supE44 thi-1 gyrA96 recA1) was used to construct and maintain plasmids. The plasmid pBend5, a derivative of pBend2 (19Kim J. Zwieb C. Wu C. Adhya S. Gene. 1989; 85: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), was used as the vector to create plasmids containing the parS variants, which were the DNA substrates for biochemical experiments. All parS variants used in this study were constructed by cloning complementary synthetic oligonucleotides (80–88-mers, depending on the variant; see supplemental Table 1) into the HpaI site of pBend5. The plasmid parS sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing at York University (Toronto) and/or Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, South Korea). Reagents—Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen. Sources for other reagents were as follows: [α-32P]dCTP and S-[3H]adenosyl-l-methionine were from PerkinElmer; bovine serum albumin and salmon sperm DNA, from Sigma; restriction enzymes, Klenow DNA polymerase, and HaeIII methylase, from New England Biolabs. DNA and Proteins—For gel mobility shift assays, the DNA substrates were total XhoI restriction digests of plasmid DNA. DNA fragments were labeled at their 3′-ends with [α-32P]dCTP and DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment), and then purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation steps. For nitrocellulose filter binding assays, supercoiled plasmid DNAs were purified in cesium chloride gradients, and labeled with S-[3H]adenosyl-l-methionine and HaeIII methylase as described (4Funnell B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6657-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). ParB (fraction V) was purified as described previously (9Bouet J.-Y. Funnell B.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). IHF was purified essentially as described (20Nash H.A. Robertson C.A. Flamm E. Weisberg R.A. Miller H.I. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4124-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), except that the phosphocellulose step was followed by Mono-S chromatography in 15 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.4, 5% glycerol, and protein was eluted with a 50 mm–1 m NaCl gradient in the same buffer. Gel Mobility Shift Assays—The standard reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 1 nm 32P-labeled DNA in 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 80 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml, and 250 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA/ml. IHF, when present, was included at 500 nm (so its binding would not be limiting). The mixtures were assembled on ice, incubated for 20 min at 30 °C, and analyzed by electrophoresis in 5% polyacrylamide gels in 90 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA. Electrophoresis was performed at 150 V for 3.5 h at 4 °C. The gels were dried onto Whatman DE81 paper and exposed to a phosphor screen for imaging by a PhosphorImager. Data were quantified using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). For each lane in the gels, the radioactivity (as phosphorimaging counts) in the area corresponding to a dimeric ParB-IHF-parS complex was measured and expressed as a fraction of the value corresponding to the parS DNA fragment in the absence of ParB. Analysis of the Data—All variants were tested typically three to six times for binding by ParB over a range of ParB concentrations, and the results from these titrations were averaged. The error in individual values was typically less than 10% of substrate, ranging from 2 to 15% of substrate. When a dimer of ParB binds parS, the interaction occurs in an equimolar fashion. Therefore, the averaged data set from a particular variant was then fit to the Langmuir binding equation (21Reichheld S.E. Davidson A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Larsson A. Axelsson B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 137: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 23Ma Y. Lieber M.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9638-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) using SigmaPlot 2000 software. I=I0+(I∞[B]/Kd)/(1+[B]/Kd)(Eq.1) The band intensity, I, is a function of the free ParB concentration [B] and the dissociation constant (Kd), and [B] is defined by the following equation, [B]=(-([S]-[BT]+Kd)+SQRT(([S]-[BT]+Kd)2+4*Kd*[BT]))/2(Eq.2) where [S] is the total concentration of parS substrate, [BT] is the total concentration of ParB, and SQRT is the square root of the values in parentheses. Not all A- and B-boxes Are Required for a Dimer of ParB to Recognize and Bind to parS—The first step in partition complex assembly is the binding of one ParB dimer to parS across the IHF-directed bend (5Bouet J.-Y. Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8213-8219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We were interested in the nature of this protein-DNA interaction as well as the role of different motifs in partition complex function. Our recent crystal structure of ParB-(142–333) complexed with parS-small had raised questions about how ParB recognizes a full parS site (16Schumacher M.A. Funnell B.E. Nature. 2005; 438: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We typically study the interaction by gel mobility shift assays in order to examine specific complexes and monitor the stoichiometry of assembly (5Bouet J.-Y. Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8213-8219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In situ OP-Cu footprinting of the dimeric ParB-IHF-parS complex showed protection of all A- and B-boxes within parS, suggesting two possible mechanisms of ParB binding to parS: 1) a single dimer of ParB binds all or most of its recognition sequences on both the left and right arms of parS simultaneously; or 2) a dimer of ParB can bind various combinations of motifs across an IHF-directed bend, so that the initial complex actually represents a mixture of complexes with different modes of ParB binding to parS. To examine these possibilities, we created a spectrum of mutant sites in which A- or B-boxes were removed by substitution with a restriction site (Fig. 2). In our nomenclature, mutations are designated by the box name in lowercase (for example, parS[a2] lacks the box A2-specific sequence; Fig. 2). Substitution allowed for the removal of specific base pair contacts with ParB while maintaining the sequence, spacing, and orientation of the remaining boxes. The use of different restriction sites also marked each parS variant differently. We constructed a negative control, called parS[Δab], which lacks all A- and B-box sequences but retains the IHF binding site (Fig. 2). We defined parS+ as all sequences between and including box B1 to B2 because box A4 is dispensable for partition in vivo (13Hayes F. Austin S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Funnell B.E. Gagnier L. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 924-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and its omission allowed us to reduce the number and complexity of variants that we created. We did subsequently confirm that box A4 was dispensable in our assays; we observed no quantitative differences in ParB binding affinity between parS+ and the parS+-A4 site (see below and Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of ParB binding activity to parS site variants in the presence of IHFparS variantBoxes remainingaDashes indicate the position of boxes that have been mutated (with respect to parS+).Kd(app)bKd(app) was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” NB, no measurable binding activity. >1 μm, substrate binding below 50% at 1 μm ParB.nmparS+B1 A1 A2 A3 B217 ± 4Δab— — — — —NBb1— A1 A2 A3 B27 ± 2a1B1 — A2 A3 B2580 ± 40a2B1 A1 — A3 B210 ± 2a3B1 A1 A2 — B261 ± 25b2B1 A1 A2 A3 —58 ± 23b1,a1— — A2 A3 B2690 ± 210b1,a2— A1 — A3 B249 ± 20b1,a3— A1 A2 — B2119 ± 59b1,b2— A1 A2 A3 —56 ± 28a1,a2B1 — — A3 B2>1 μma1,a3B1 — A2 — B2NBa1,b2B1 — A2 A3 —NBa3,b2B1 A1 A2 — —59 ± 35a2,b2B1 A1 — A3 —400 ± 160a2,a3B1 A1 — — B2450 ± 150b1,a3,b2— A1 A2 — —28 ± 6b1,a2,b2— A1 — A3 —550 ± 180b1,a2,a3— A1 — — B2500 ± 220RevA1A2— 1A 2A — —NBparS+-A4B1 A1 A2 A3 B2 A414 ± 7b1,a2,a3,b2-A4— A1 — — — A4760 ± 210a1,a2,a3,b2-A4B1 — — — — A4NBa Dashes indicate the position of boxes that have been mutated (with respect to parS+).b Kd(app) was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” NB, no measurable binding activity. >1 μm, substrate binding below 50% at 1 μm ParB. Open table in a new tab We first tested the effect of mutating individual motifs on the formation of the partition complex. The parS substrates were incubated with ParB and IHF, and the resulting complexes were separated by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3). An apparent dissociation constant (Kd(app)) was then determined through quantitative analysis of ParB-IHF-parS complex formation (Table 1). The data were evaluated using the Langmuir formula (see “Experimental Procedures”), a common way of describing specific, high-affinity binding of two molecules (21Reichheld S.E. Davidson A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Larsson A. Axelsson B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 137: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 23Ma Y. Lieber M.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9638-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The half-interval method was then used on the fitted curves to obtain the Kd(app) value, where Kd(app) is defined as the amount of ParB necessary for 50% maximal binding. The theoretical Langmuir curves and experimental binding curves produced Kd(app) values that were very similar. The results showed that not all motifs are necessary for the initial recognition of parS by ParB, and that some motifs are more important than others (Figs. 3 and 4; Table 1). Mutation of box B1 or box A2 had no significant effect on complex formation compared with that with parS+. However, removal of the other three motifs did reduce ParB affinity for parS. Mutation of box A3 or box B2 each reduced complex formation by ∼3–4-fold. The removal of box A1 produced the greatest reduction in complex formation. The Kd(app) was 30-fold greater than when using parS+. Therefore in this assay box A1 is a stronger recognition sequence than box B1 for ParB to bridge over the IHF directed bend. Comparison of parS[a3]to parS[a2] indicates that box A3 is the preferred A-box on the right arm of parS. Finally, the data indicate that this initial ParB-IHF-parS complex is only a precursor of the functional partition complex, because not all motifs necessary for parS function are necessary to form this first complex. We also noted that ParB bound to all parS variants with the same stoichiometry as to parS+, as the mobility of the ParB-IHF-parS complexes were identical in all gels that we examined (Fig. 3). Motif Use Is Influenced by Substrate Topology—The effect of mutation of box A1 on complex formation was unexpected because genetic assays had shown that it is dispensable for parS activity in vivo (11Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the single motif mutations we used in this study behaved identically in vivo to mutations published previously (12Funnell B.E. Gagnier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3616-3624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hayes F. Austin S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Funnell B.E. Gagnier L. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 924-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) by using incompatibility assays, which measure the ability of parS to destabilize a miniP1 partitioned by parS+. The parS[b1], parS[a2], parS[a3], and parS[b2] substitutions destroyed parS activity (were Inc–) compared with parS[a1], which behaved as parS+ (Inc+; data not shown). We considered the possibility that DNA topology was important because plasmid DNA would normally be negatively supercoiled in vivo. We used nitrocellulose filter binding assays with 3H-labeled plasmid DNA in vitro to test the influence of mutations in each motif on ParB binding to supercoiled substrates (Fig. 5). This assay is effective in examining ParB binding directly because under these conditions IHF binds DNA to nitrocellulose poorly (4Funnell B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6657-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast to the assays on linear DNA, ParB bound parS+, parS[a1], and parS[b1] to similar extents in this assay (Fig. 5A). The mutations in the right side of parS, however, had effects on supercoiled DNA similar to those they manifested on linear DNA. Mutation of box A2 did not affect ParB binding activity, whereas mutation of box A3 or box B2 reduced ParB affinity for these parS variants. Because removing either one of the left-side boxes did not significantly affect binding, we removed both boxes B1 and A1 (Fig. 5A). The ParB binding activity to parS[b1,a1] was greatly reduced; therefore either box B1 or box A1 on the left arm of parS is necessary for this complex, but either one will suffice in this assay. This result confirms that the complexes measured in these filter-binding assays are using recognition motifs on both the left and right arms of parS over an IHF-directed bend, and thus the use of box B1 by ParB is strongly influenced by the topological context of the parS site. Therefore the ability to use box B1 is dependent on negative supercoiling, but in plasmids with this topology, either box A1 or B1 is sufficient to bridge across the IHF-directed bend. The role of Right-side Motifs in ParB Recognition—We next examined parS variants lacking two motifs (Fig. 2). First, each right-side motif was mutated in combination with either box A1 or box B1 (Fig. 6A and Table 1). All double mutants lacking A1 were poor substrates for ParB. parS sites lacking box B1 and one right-side motif were similar to or slightly weaker than the corresponding parS sites with single right-side mutations. Therefore two motifs on the right side are sufficient to mediate a relatively strong interaction with ParB as long as there is a specific left-side interaction. We concluded that box B1 could not contribute significantly because the substrates were linear. We confirmed this conclusion by testing two of these right-side mutations (a2 or a3) in the presence of either a1 or b1 substitutions in parS sites on supercoiled plasmids in nitrocellulose filter binding assays. In this experiment, parS[a1,a2] behaved as parS[b1,a2], and parS[a1,a3] behaved as parS[b1,a3] (Fig. 5B). Therefore, as seen with the single mutants, either box B1 or A1 is sufficient for a specific interaction of ParB with the left side of parS on supercoiled substrates. Because, with the exception of box A1, the gel-shift and filter-binding assays showed similar motif preferences for ParB, we continued the analysis using gel electrophoresis, as it allowed us to identify and quantify the dimeric ParB-IHF-parS complexes. We next examined the behavior of parS sites with double mutations in the right side of parS (Fig. 6B) to see whether any of the three right-side motifs were sufficient to mediate a specific interaction with ParB and, if so, whether they were equivalent. The answer was yes, all could interact specifically with ParB, but no, they were not equivalent. parS sites with only box A3 or box B2 were weaker, but specific sites (parS[a2,b2] and parS[a2,a3] were better substrates than parS[Δab]; Fig. 6B). However the parS site with only box A2 (parS[a3,b2]; Fig. 6B) was similar to parS sites lacking only one motif on the right side of parS (Fig. 6A; Table 1). We think that the simplest interpretation of these combinations is that in the presence of IHF and a specific left-side interaction, box A2 alone is sufficient to mediate a relatively strong interaction on the right side of parS. However in the absence of box A2, both boxes A3 and B2 must be present for highest binding activity of the right side of parS (Fig. 6B and Table 1). Finally, we tested parS variants that contained only motifs A1 and A2 (parS[b1,a3,b2]), only A1 and A3 (parS[b1,a2,b2]), and only A1 and B2 (parS[b1,a3,b2]) to confirm that only one motif on each side of parS was sufficient to mediate a specific interaction. Within the limits of experimental error, the affinity of ParB for these parS variants was similar to that when box B1 was present (Fig. 6B; Table 1). Our results indicating a role for box A1 on linear DNA prompted us to reassess the involvement of box A4 in complex formation, even though the presence of box A4 did not affect the activity of parS+ (Figs. 3 and 4, Table 1). We asked whether box A4 could substitute as a single motif on the right side of parS. ParB bound weakly to parS, with only boxes A1 and A4 (Fig. 6B; Table 1), and not to parS with boxes B1 and A4. Note that box A4 is 22 bp, or two turns of the helix, to the right of box A2, so we interpret the A1–A4 activity as ParB bridging across the bend in a specific and similar, but weaker, fashion than as between A1 and A2. In summary, the parS variants that we constructed for this analysis fell into three general categories: strong binding sites (with Kd(app) values similar to or only a fewfold higher than parS+); weak but specific binding sites (such as parS[a2,b2]); and sites with no detectable specific binding (equivalent to parS[Δab]). Several representative parS sites are graphed over a large titration range of ParB to illustrate these groups in Fig. 6C. All parS sites with intact A1 boxes fell into the former two categories (with linear DNA), indicating that bridging across the IHF-directed bend could occur with a minimum of one motif on each side of parS. ParB Interactions across the Bend in parS—All of the previous assays included IHF, and thus we have not directly measured the role of the IHF-directed bend. To ask how ParB binds to parS in the absence of the bend, we measured ParB interactions with parS sites lacking one or more motifs in the absence of IHF (Fig. 7A). Consistent with previous observations that the right side of parS, or parS-small, is the minimal partition site, removal of motifs on the left side of parS did not affect ParB binding in the absence of IHF. In other words, without the bend, ParB does not interact productively with the left side of parS. Examina"

In this study, we demonstrate that the signalling scaffold Shb associates through SH2 and PTB domain interactions with phosphorylated tyrosine motifs in the LMP2A N-terminal tail. Additionally, we show that mutation of tyrosines in these motifs as well as shRNA-mediated downregulation of Shb leads to a loss of constitutive Akt-activation in LMP2A-expressing cells. Furthermore, utilization by Shb of the LMP2A ITAM motif regulates stability of the Syk tyrosine kinase in LMP2A-expressing cells. Our data set the precedent for viral utilization of the Shb signalling scaffold and implicate Shb as a regulator of LMP2A-dependent Akt activation."

Proteins associated with homologous recombination play important roles in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the genome. They facilitate DNA repair and aid the rescue damaged replication forks. A key feature of recombination is the process of homologous DNA strand exchange. This reaction is catalyzed in bacteria by RecA protein and in eukaryotes and archaea by the RecA homologues Rad51 and RadA, respectively. These proteins assemble on ssDNA 2The abbreviations used are: ss, single-stranded; ds, double-stranded; Se-Met, selenomethionyl; SARS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. to form helical nucleoprotein filaments that initiate the search for homology (1Kowalczykowski S.C.

Biol. 2007; 8: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, their activity has to be controlled to avoid unnecessary exchanges, which can be highly detrimental (3Mahdi A.A. Buckman C. Harris L. Lloyd R.G. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2135-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). RecA activity in E. coli is limited by the need for specialized loading factors (RecBCD and RecFOR) to overcome the propensity for any ssDNA to be rapidly sequestered by SSB protein and is tempered by other proteins (DinI and RecX) that affect the stability of the assembled filament (2Cox M.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). A number of recent studies have indicated that RdgC may be another factor that acts as a negative regulator of RecA function. The RdgC protein is restricted to the β- and γ-subsections of the Proteobacteria (4Moore T. McGlynn P. Ngo H.P. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that includes E. coli and Neisseria spps. In the latter, RdgC promotes the recombination-mediated, pilin antigenic variation associated with virulence (5Mehr I.J. Long C.D. Serkin C.D. Seifert H.S. Genetics. 2000; 154: 523-532PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was first characterized as a factor essential for growth of recombination-deficient mutants of E. coli (6Ryder L. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and later as a DNA-binding protein needed to maintain viability in strains lacking PriA (4Moore T. McGlynn P. Ngo H.P. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), a primosome assembly factor that loads the DnaB replicative helicase at stalled replication forks. In particular, the presence of RdgC appears necessary to counter or survive RecFOR-mediated loading of RecA (4Moore T. McGlynn P. Ngo H.P. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies with RdgC from Escherichia coli and Neisseria meningitidis showed it to be a dimer in solution and to bind nonspecifically to linear and circular DNA, although it displays a higher affinity for double stranded over single stranded substrates (4Moore T. McGlynn P. Ngo H.P. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 7Moore T. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. J.

Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4708-4717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Taken together with the estimate of ∼1000 copies of the dimer in an E. coli cell during exponential phase growth (4Moore T. McGlynn P. Ngo H.P. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), these observations are consistent with a role as a negative regulator of RecA. The crystal structure described here provides a number of clues as to how RdgC might bind DNA to achieve this effect. Protein Expression and Purification—Native RdgC was expressed from E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying pLysS and pGS853, as described (4Moore T. McGlynn P. Ngo H.P. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A selenomethionyl (Se-Met) derivative was expressed from the same strain using feedback inhibition of methionine biosynthesis (10Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) by growth in fully supplemented 56/2 minimal salts medium with Se-Met added to 50 mg/liter. After expression, resuspended cell pellets were sonicated and clarified. RdgC was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, heparin, and Q ion exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration into 20 mm Tris:HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl. Finally, the purified proteins were concentrated to 25–30 mg/ml. Incorporation of Se-Met was confirmed by mass spectrometry. DNA Substrates—The oligonucleotides YJ7 (5′-TGTAATCGTCTATGACGTT-3′) and YJ8 (5′-AACGTCATAGACGATTACA-3′) were annealed to make the 19-mer duplex, JY7/8. The duplex was purified by gel electrophoresis and eluted into 10 mm Tris:HCl, pH 8.5, before concentration to ∼300 mm. Crystallization Conditions—RdgC and YJ7/8 were mixed to a final concentration of 70 and 80 μm, respectively, and left on ice for 15 min to form complexes. Crystals were grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion with a 1:1 ratio of complex and reservoir solution in each drop. Typically, crystals grew at 10 °C from 15 to 20% polyethylene glycol 1000, 200 mm CaCl2, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0–7.5. Data Collection and Processing—Cryoprotection was by the dropwise addition of 100% 2,3-butandiol to the crystallization drop until the volume was 130% of the original. Crystals were harvested and plunged into liquid nitrogen. Data for the Se-Met derivative were collected on ID14-4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) with a wavelength of 0.98 Å to allow collection of anomalous data. Data were indexed and reduced with MOSFLM (11Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar) and SCALA (12Evans P.R. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S.

The final model is complete for both chains in the dimer, apart from residues at the extreme C terminus. Crystal Structure—We crystallized native RdgC and the Se-Met derivative with and without DNA. The structure presented is for the Se-Met derivative co-crystallized with a 19-bp duplex, YJ7/8, which was solved to 2.4 Å (Table 1). Data were also collected for native RdgC, but the resulting model was less complete. Crystallization was enhanced in the presence of either ssDNA or dsDNA, with crystals reaching 400 × 200 × 200 μm. Crystals formed in the absence of DNA were smaller, non-isomorphous, and diffracted to only 2.8 Å.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsSe-Met RdgCData collection Space groupP 21 21 21 Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)51.42, 95.68, 171.58α, β, γ (°)90, 90, 90 Wavelength0.98 Resolution (Å)95.78-2.40 (2.53-2.40) Rmerge0.06 (0.33) I/σI20.2 (3.9) Completeness (%)98.5 (92.9) Anom.aAnom., anomalous. completeness (%)97.2 (88.7) Anom.aAnom., anomalous. multiplicity3.5 (3.2)Refinement Resolution (Å)19.8-2.40 (2.46-2.40) No. of unique reflections29976 Rwork/Rfree0.23/0.32 (0.28/0.39) Mean FOM from SOLVE0.64 No. of atomsProtein4717Water84 rmsbrms, root mean square. deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.032Bond angles (°)2.674 Correlation coefficient on fo — fc0.926a Anom., anomalous.b rms, root mean square. Open table in a new tab In agreement with biochemical data (4Moore T. McGlynn P. Ngo H.P. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), RdgC crystallizes as a dimer with a head-to-head, tail-to-tail organization (Fig. 1, A and B). The dimer forms a ring with a 30 Å diameter hole (Cα to Cα) at the center. Interestingly, the packing of RdgC molecules in the crystal lattice causes these holes to form long, continuous pores through the crystal (Fig. 1C). Analysis of a washed and dissolved crystal by gel electrophoresis confirmed the presence of DNA. Unfortunately, no additional density was observed in the Fo – Fc difference map that could be used to locate the DNA. We assume that the DNA is disordered, which may be related to the mode of binding. Protein Fold—A search of the structure data base with the Dali server (18Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar) revealed no matches to RdgC. The overall protein fold is unique and reminiscent of a horseshoe in shape, with twin gates closing the open end (Fig. 1A). The inner face consists of eight anti-parallel β-strands with the dimer interface falling between the fourth and fifth strands (Fig. 2B). This interface is completed by two anti-parallel helices on the outer surface. It is held together by hydrogen bonds between the β-strands and also between a triad of highly conserved residues at the ends of the helices; Gln-212 and Glu-218 from one monomer and Lys-227 from the other (Fig. 2, A and B). The conserved histidine, His-222, completes the dimer interface. The second dimer interface is created where the two regions of extended β-strand forming the gates overlap. Unlike the horseshoe dimer interface, the interface closing the gate appears to be mediated primarily by a double hydrophobic interaction. A conserved phenylalanine, Phe-120, on one chain sits in a pocket formed by highly conserved residues on the other chain: Ile-74, Leu-75, Pro-76, Val-79, Leu-115, Leu-116, Arg-118, Ala-119, and Phe-120, and vice versa (Fig. 2, C and D). Hydrogen bonding between the guanidinium and carbonyl groups of the Arg-118 residues stabilize the dimer interaction (Fig. 2D). Two anti-parallel α-helices project perpendicular to the ring on either side of the dimer interface at the gate. These “finger” domains run from Ser-77 to Leu-115. They contain a high proportion of conserved lysines that cause the upper surface to be highly electropositive (Fig. 2, A and E). Of particular note is the turn between the two helices, consisting of an arginine (Arg-97) and three lysines (Lys-98, Lys-100, Lys-101), which form a basic tip (Fig. 2E). Although the exact positioning of the fingertip residues is not conserved across all species, the propensity for basic residues in this region is retained (Fig. 2A). The two finger domains do not have identical conformations in the crystal structure; this is probably due to their relative positions in the crystal lattice, which allows them to make different crystallographic contacts. It may also be indicative of their high B factors, and it is possible that some flexibility is necessary for protein function. Although RdgC has a novel fold, an electrostatic surface representation (Fig. 3) invites comparisons with the sliding clamp proteins proliferating cell nuclear antigen (19Krishna T.S. Kong X.P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar) and β-clamp (20Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), and with the SARS-CoV nsp7-nsp8 hexadecamer (21Zhai Y. Sun F. Li X. Pang H. Xu X. Bartlam M. Rao Z. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 980-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Like RdgC, these have a ring structure with a hole lined with positive potential and an outer negative surface. Sliding clamps are processivity factors that encircle DNA at replication forks. The SARS-CoV protein is thought to be involved in replication and encircles dsRNA. Thus RdgC could bind DNA by encircling it with the positively charged channel interacting with the DNA phosphate backbone (Fig. 3, B–D). The dimensions of the hole (30 Å) are similar to that in SARS-CoV and would suggest that the positively charged side chains can interact directly with the DNA (25 Å diameter). This is in contrast to the sliding clamp proteins, which have a 35 Å hole and are thought to maintain a topological interaction with DNA, whereas not directly interacting with it (22Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3613-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The ring structure, with a positively charged hole, would explain the limited sequence and structural specificity seen in biochemical studies. The proposed DNA binding channel is 40 Å from the front to the back of the ring and 55 Å from fingertip to fingertip (Figs. 1B and 3C). This area could interact with ∼18 bp of DNA, which agrees well with the 15–20 bp required to make a stable complex in vitro (4Moore T. McGlynn P. Ngo H.P. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 7Moore T. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). If the protein is primarily interacting with the negatively charged backbone, then as long as the DNA molecule has a region of the correct dimensions (a duplex of at least 20 bp), the binding of different structures will be indistinguishable. Backbone contacts would explain the slight preference for dsDNA. With ssDNA, the backbone phosphates would be less likely to be positioned for optimum binding. The failure to observe electron density for any of the DNA substrates tested (single-stranded, blunt duplexes, 5′ or 3′ overhangs, hairpins, mismatches, insertion-induced bends), despite evidence for its presence in the crystals, is likely to reflect the nonspecific nature of DNA binding. Another similarity with the sliding clamp family of proteins can be seen in the structure at the horseshoe dimer interface. Although the overall topologies are different, the dimer interfaces are analogous. Both are held together by a continuous run of β-sheet across the interface with a pair of anti-parallel α-helices providing additional interdomain bonds. RdgC has the helices on the outside of the protein, whereas β-clamp has them on the inner face of the ring. In the case of β-clamp, the stability of the dimer interfaces necessitates active loading and unloading on DNA via the clamp loader (23Yao N. Turner J. Kelman Z. Stukenberg P.T. Dean F. Shechter D. Pan Z.Q. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). RdgC is able to bind to circular DNA molecules without a requirement for additional factors (7Moore T. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 8Tessmer I. Moore T. Lloyd R.G. Wilson A. Erie D.A. Allen S. Tendler S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting that it can load by itself, possibly by opening of the second dimer interface in the gate region. The highly electropositive finger domain (Figs. 2E and 3, C and D) is an obvious site for the initial recognition of, and interaction with, the DNA phosphate backbone. Once bound, a change in conformation of the two helices forming the finger could disrupt the hydrophobic pocket at the base, which forms the dimer interface, causing the gate to open. The DNA, held in position by the finger, could then enter the opened gate and become encircled by the RdgC protein. The narrowness of the central hole would suggest that RdgC cannot slide easily along a length of DNA and so is unlikely to be a processivity factor. The tight binding of small oligonucleotides in biochemical assays supports this view. If RdgC could readily slide along DNA, then we would expect these complexes to be inherently unstable. β-Clamp, for example, will not form stable complexes with linear DNA in vitro (24Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of specificity with regard to DNA binding substrates would limit its role as a recruitment protein because, although it could clearly form protein-protein interactions, there would be no specific feature of the DNA that could be targeted. Of course, the lack of DNA specificity displayed by RdgC in vitro does not preclude the possibility that RdgC itself is recruited to specific regions by interactions with proteins that do demonstrate DNA structure or sequence specificity. The function that has been suggested for RdgC is as a modulator of RecA activity. The structure determined suggests how RdgC might achieve this effect. If RdgC binds to DNA in the manner predicted here, the main consequence will be the stabilization of the DNA duplex to unwinding as the DNA is completely encircled. Such a complex could curb the activity of RecA either by forming an obstacle to filament assembly or by preventing subsequent strand exchange or both. We think of RdgC not as a complete block to RecA but rather as a temporary halt that prevents inappropriate or unnecessary activity.

https://openalex.org/W2017025485,"Pes1 was first identified as the locus affected in the zebrafish mutant pescadillo, which exhibits severe defects in gut and liver development. It has since been demonstrated that loss of Pes1 expression in mammals and yeast affects ribosome biogenesis, resulting in a block in cell proliferation. Pes1 contains a BRCA1 C-terminal domain, a structural motif that has been shown to facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting that Pes1 has binding partners. We used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify putative interacting proteins. We found that light chain 1 of the microtubule-associated protein 1B (Mtap1b-LC1) could partner with Pes1, and deletion analyses revealed a specific interaction of Mtap1b-LC1 with the Pes1 BRCA1 C-terminal domain. We confirmed the integrity of the interaction between Pes1 and Mtap1b-LC1 by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Protein localization studies in NIH3T3 cells revealed that exogenously expressed Pes1 was typically restricted to nuclei and nucleoli. However, exogenous Pes1 was found predominantly in the cytoplasm in cells that were forced to express Mtap1b-LC1. We also observed that the expression of endogenous Pes1 protein was significantly reduced or undetectable in nuclei when Mtap1b-LC1 was overexpressed, implying that a dynamic interaction exists between the two proteins and that Mtap1b-LC1 has the potential to negatively impact Pes1 function. Finally, we demonstrated that, as is the case when Pes1 expression is depleted by shRNA, overexpression of Mtap1b-LC1 resulted in diminished proliferation of NIH3T3 cells, suggesting that Mtap1b-LC1 has the potential to repress cell proliferation by modulating the nucleolar levels of Pes1."
