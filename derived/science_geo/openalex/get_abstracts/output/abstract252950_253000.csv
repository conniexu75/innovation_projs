https://openalex.org/W2063478423,"The hope of developing new transplantation therapies for degenerative diseases is limited by inefficient stem cell growth and immunological incompatibility with the host. Here we show that Notch receptor activation induces the expression of the specific target genes hairy and enhancer of split 3 (Hes3) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) through rapid activation of cytoplasmic signals, including the serine/threonine kinase Akt, the transcription factor STAT3 and mammalian target of rapamycin, and thereby promotes the survival of neural stem cells. In both murine somatic and human embryonic stem cells, these positive signals are opposed by a control mechanism that involves the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Transient administration of Notch ligands to the brain of adult rats increases the numbers of newly generated precursor cells and improves motor skills after ischaemic injury. These data indicate that stem cell expansion in vitro and in vivo, two central goals of regenerative medicine, may be achieved by Notch ligands through a pathway that is fundamental to development and cancer."

In Alzheimer disease, accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain and disease-causing mutations in amyloid precursor protein or in enzymes that produce Aβ indicate dysregulation of production or clearance of Aβ. Whether dysregulation of Aβ synthesis or clearance causes the most common form of Alzheimer disease (sporadic, >99% of cases), however, is not known. Here, we describe a method to determine the production and clearance rates of proteins within the human central nervous system (CNS). We report the first measurements of the fractional production and clearance rates of Aβ in vivo in the human CNS to be 7.6% per hour and 8.3% per hour, respectively. This method may be used to search for novel biomarkers of disease, to assess underlying differences in protein metabolism that contribute to disease and to evaluate treatments in terms of their pharmacodynamic effects on proposed disease-causing pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1970146368,"Most colorectal cancers have mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene or the β-catenin gene that stabilize β-catenin and activate β-catenin target genes, leading ultimately to cancer. The molecular mechanisms of APC function in β-catenin degradation are not completely known. APC binds β-catenin and is involved in the Axin complex, suggesting that APC regulates β-catenin phosphorylation. Some evidence also suggests that APC regulates β-catenin nuclear export. Here, we examine the effects of APC mutations on β-catenin phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation in the colon cancer cell lines SW480, DLD-1, and HT29, each of which contains a different APC truncation. Although the current models suggest that β-catenin phosphorylation should be inhibited by APC mutations, we detected significant β-catenin phosphorylation in these cells. However, β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation were inhibited in SW480 but not in DLD-1 and HT29 cells. The ubiquitination ofβ-catenin in SW480 cells can be rescued by exogenous expression of APC. The APC domains required for β-catenin ubiquitination were analyzed. Our results suggest that APC regulates β-catenin phosphorylation and ubiquitination by distinct domains and by separate molecular mechanisms.

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, and the incidence of colorectal cancer is rising in developing countries (1American Cancer Society.

Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4252) Google Scholar). APC is an essential component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which plays a key role in intestinal homeostasis and colorectal cancers (3Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys.

It binds E-cadherin on the cell membrane, regulating cell adhesion. It also binds T-cell factor (TCF) in the nucleus and controls gene expression (3Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys.

In normal cells, β-catenin degradation is initiated by serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) phosphorylation at its amino-terminal region (7Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R.

Without Wnt signaling, β-catenin forms a complex with casein kinase Iα (CKIα), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), and a scaffold protein, Axin, resulting in CKIα-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser-45. Ser-45 phosphorylation provides a recognition site for GSK-3 and allows GSK-3 to phosphorylate β-catenin at positions Thr-41, Ser-37, and Ser-33 (9Amit S. Hatzubai A. Birman Y. Andersen J.S.

Wnt signaling inhibits GSK-3 phosphorylation of β-catenin but not CKIα phosphorylation of β-catenin (10Liu C. Li Y. Semenov M. Han C. Baeg G.H. Tan Y. Zhang Z. Lin X. He X. Cell. 2002; 108: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). However, it is still unknown whether APC regulates β-catenin phosphorylation or whether APC regulates GSK-3 or CKIα phosphorylation of β-catenin. Furthermore, it is unclear how β-catenin shifts from a complex with Axin to a separate complex with β-Trcp.APC has two types of β-catenin binding domains, three 15-aa repeat domains and seven 20-aa repeat domains (3Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1653: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 4Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Moon R.T. Brown J.D.

Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). APC also has three Axin binding domains, which are called SAMP motifs (16Behrens J. Jerchow B.A. Wurtele M. Grimm J. Asbrand C. Wirtz R. Kuhl M. Wedlich D. Birchmeier W. Science. 1998; 280: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Most colorectal cancers have an APC truncation in one allele and loss of heterozygosity in the other allele (2Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4252) Google Scholar, 17Rowan A.J. Lamlum H. Ilyas M. Wheeler J. Straub J. Papadopoulou A. Bicknell D. Bodmer W.F. Tomlinson I.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3352-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). APC mutations associated with cancer are consistently truncated before amino acid 1638 and lack the Axin binding domains (18Smits R. Kielman M.F. Breukel C. Zurcher C. Neufeld K. Jagmohan-Changur S. Hofland N. van Dijk J. White R. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Khan P.M. Fodde R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1309-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Since APC has both β-catenin and Axin binding domains, it has been suggested that APC is an essential component in the Axin complex (16Behrens J. Jerchow B.A. Wurtele M. Grimm J. Asbrand C. Wirtz R. Kuhl M. Wedlich D. Birchmeier W. Science. 1998; 280: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar, 19Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A.

It would be expected that, in these colon cancer cells, APC mutations prevent the assembly of Axin complex and thus prevent β-catenin phosphorylation. Recently, crystal structures of β-catenin/APC and β-catenin/Axin complex suggest that APC may compete with Axin for β-catenin binding, thus releasing phosphorylated β-catenin from the Axin complex for degradation (21Ha N.C. Tonozuka T. Stamos J.L. Choi H.J. Weis W.I. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 22Xing Y. Clements W.K. Kimelman D. Xu W.

Cell. 2004; 15: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). APC also has a nuclear export signal and can shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus (24Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 25Henderson B.R. Fagotto F. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 26Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Townsley F. Bienz M. Nature. 2000; 406: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that APC may transport β-catenin out of the nucleus. According to this model, APC mutations should prevent the nuclear export of β-catenin and thus prevent β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation in colon cancer cells.To understand APC function in vivo and to understand why APC mutations inhibit β-catenin degradation in colon cancer cells, we analyzed β-catenin phosphorylation in the colon cancer cell lines containing different APC truncations. We found that these APC truncations did not prevent β-catenin phosphorylation, suggesting that truncated APC retains at least partial activity for β-catenin phosphorylation. However, β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation was inhibited in SW480 cells. We demonstrated that the defect in β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation in SW480 cells is due to an APC truncation. The truncated APC only inhibits β-catenin ubiquitination but not β-catenin phosphorylation. These results indicate that the mechanisms of APC function in β-catenin regulation are more complicated than originally thought.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines—The colon cancer cell lines, HEK293T, HCT116, SW480, DLD-1, and HT29, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C, 5% CO2. HEK293T cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method. SW480 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or infected with adenovirus. For proteasome inhibition, cells were treated with MG132 (2.5 μm) for 6 h.Constructs—Truncated APC fragments were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pCS2MT vector. DNA sequences were confirmed by automatic sequencing. Adenovirus Ad-CBR was a gift from Dr. B. Vogelstein (27Shih I.M. Yu J. He T.C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1671-1676PubMed Google Scholar). Adenoviruses that express different APC fragments were constructed using the Ad-Easy kit from ATCC. GST-APC2,3 was a gift from Dr. W. Xu. The putative APC phosphorylation sites Ser-1385, Thr-1388, Ser-1389, Ser-1391, Ser-1501, Ser-1504, Ser-1505, Ser-1507, and Ser-1510 (according to Ha et al. (21Ha N.C. Tonozuka T. Stamos J.L. Choi H.J. Weis W.I. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar)) were changed to alanine in GST-APC2,3 to make an S→A mutant. This site-directed mutagenesis was designed using the computer program SiteFind (28Evans P.M. Liu C. BMC Mol. Biol. 2005; 6: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). CKI kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA).Western Blot—Cells were lysed in 1% Triton lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. GST pulldown assays and Western blots were performed as described previously (13Liu C. Kato Y. Zhang Z. Do V.M. Yankner B.A. He X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6273-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Cell fractions were isolated using a cell fractionation kit from Sigma. Phospho-specific antibodies for β-catenin were described previously (10Liu C. Li Y. Semenov M. Han C. Baeg G.H. Tan Y. Zhang Z. Lin X. He X. Cell. 2002; 108: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-β-Trcp antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA).Immunohistochemistry—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min and then blocked by serum-free protein blocking buffer (DakoCytomation) for 1 h. Anti-β-catenin antibody (1:100, Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA) was diluted in antibody diluent (DakoCytomation) and incubated with cells overnight. The cells were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline with Tween, incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:800), and then diluted in Tris-buffered saline with Tween for 1 h. The coverslips were washed, mounted on glass slides, and photographed with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope (Germany).Enzymatic Assay—Luciferase activity was analyzed by the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison WI). In vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (13Liu C. Kato Y. Zhang Z. Do V.M. Yankner B.A. He X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6273-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The alkaline phosphatase assay was performed by incubating the immunoprecipitated β-catenin with calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) at 37 °C for 30 min.RESULTSβ-Catenin Phosphorylation Was Not Inhibited in Colon Cancer Cells Containing APC Mutations—The majority of colon cancer cells have APC mutations; therefore, it was expected that these cells would not have phosphorylated β-catenin. We analyzed β-catenin phosphorylation in APC mutant colon cancer cell lines SW480, DLD-1, and HT29 using phospho-specific antibodies against β-catenin. APC is deleted at the carboxyl terminus at residue 1338 in SW480 cells, residue 1427 in DLD-1 cells, and residue 1555 in HT29 cells (29Brocardo M. Nathke I.S. Henderson B.R. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 30Hinoi T. Yamamoto H. Kishida M. Takada S. Kishida S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34399-34406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 31Nishisho I. Nakamura Y. Miyoshi Y. Miki Y. Ando H. Horii A. Koyama K. Utsunomiya J. Baba S. Hedge P. Science. 1991; 253: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The colon cancer cell line HCT116, which has wild type APC, was used as a control. As described in our previous study, antibody Ab45 only recognizes β-catenin phosphorylation at residue Ser-45, and Ab(33 + 37)/41 only recognizes Ser-33/Ser-37/Thr-41 phosphorylation of β-catenin (10Liu C. Li Y. Semenov M. Han C. Baeg G.H. Tan Y. Zhang Z. Lin X. He X. Cell. 2002; 108: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we found that both Ser-33/Ser-37/Thr-41 and Ser-45 were phosphorylated in these cells, suggesting that APC truncations in these cell lines do not inhibit GSK-3 or CKIα phosphorylation of β-catenin (Fig. 1B). To further confirm that these antibodies only recognize phosphorylated β-catenin, β-catenin protein was immunoprecipitated with a β-catenin antibody from HT29 and HCT116 cell lysates and treated with CIP. The levels of β-catenin protein remained the same as the control samples without CIP treatment. However, β-catenin phosphorylation could not be detected in the CIP-treated samples (Fig. 1C). These data confirmed the specificity of the phospho-specific antibodies, further suggesting that, in human colon cancer cell lines SW480, DLD-1, and HT29, APC mutations do not prevent β-catenin phosphorylation. HCT116 cells have one allele of wild type β-catenin and one allele of mutated β-catenin that has a deletion at Ser-45 (32Wang Z. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5234-5235PubMed Google Scholar). Since the Ser-45 deletion mutant is stabilized relative to the wild type protein, it comprises most of the β-catenin within the cell. We observed a lesser degree of Ser-45 phosphorylation in these cells.APC Mutation Inhibits β-Catenin Ubiquitination and Degradation in the SW480 Colon Cancer Cells—To further study how APC regulates β-catenin degradation, several colon cancer cell lines were treated with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, and analyzed with β-catenin antibodies. HCT116 cells were used as a control. It is known that proteasome inhibitors can stabilize ubiquitinated β-catenin. After MG132 treatment, two major bands were detected by Western blot. The lower band is β-catenin without ubiquitination; the upper band is β-catenin with mono-ubiquitination (30Hinoi T. Yamamoto H. Kishida M. Takada S. Kishida S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34399-34406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 33Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Hattori K. Nakamichi I. Kikuchi A. Nakayama K. Nakayama K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). As expected, after MG132 treatment, ubiquitinated β-catenin was detected in HCT116 cell lysates (Fig. 2A). The ubiquitinated bands of β-catenin were also detected in DLD-1 and HT29 cells. In HCT116, DLD-1, and HT29 cells treated with MG132, β-catenin levels increased, suggesting that β-catenin degradation was not completely inhibited in these cells. In contrast, SW480 cells demonstrated strong β-catenin phosphorylation, almost undetectable ubiquitination, and no increase in β-catenin levels after MG132 treatment. This suggests that β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation were inhibited in SW480 cells (Fig. 2A). Similar results have been reported by Sadot et al. (34Sadot E. Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J. Shnizer D. Lando Z. Zharhary D. Kam Z. Ben-Ze'ev A. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2771-2780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether the defect of β-catenin ubiquitination in SW480 cells was caused by an APC mutation or by other mutations. To confirm that β-catenin phosphorylation is required for ubiquitination, we transfected wild type β-catenin and mutant β-catenin into HEK293T cells. The cells were treated with or without MG132. We found that wild type β-catenin, but not mutant β-catenin, was modified by ubiquitination (Fig. 2B). We infected SW480 cells with Ad-CBR, which carries a functional APC fragment (27Shih I.M. Yu J. He T.C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1671-1676PubMed Google Scholar). This fragment contains all of the 15-aa repeats and 20-aa repeats, in addition to the Axin binding domains. We found that Ad-CBR can rescue β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation in SW480 cells, indicating that APC is required for the ubiquitination and degradation of phosphorylated β-catenin (Fig. 2C). β-Catenin phosphorylation was stronger in SW480 cells, most likely because phosphorylated β-catenin is degraded more slowly and accumulates in SW480 cells. MG132 treatment also stabilized phosphorylated β-catenin. Ad-CBR increased β-catenin phosphorylation, indicating that APC is required for the efficient phosphorylation of β-catenin.FIGURE 2β-Catenin ubiquitination/degradation in colon cancer cells. A, SW480, DLD-1, HT29, and HCT116 cells were treated with MG132 and analyzed with antibodies against β-catenin and phosphorylated β-catenin. The upper bands are ubiquitinated β-catenin (28Evans P.M. Liu C. BMC Mol. Biol. 2005; 6: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 32Wang Z. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5234-5235PubMed Google Scholar). B, HEK293T cells were transfected by FLAG-tagged wild type (WT) β-catenin and mutant β-catenin, S33A (serine 33 changed to alanine), and S→A (Ser-33, Ser-37, Thr-41, and Ser-45 were changed to alanine), and then treated with MG132. Transfected β-catenin was detected by anti-FLAG antibody. C, SW480 cells were infected with the APC adenovirus Ad-CBR or the control adenovirus, Ad-GFP, and then treated with MG132. Cytoplasmic fractions were analyzed with antibodies against β-catenin and phosphorylated β-catenin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)APC Domains Required for β-Catenin Ubiquitination—Notably, the APC mutations in these colon cancer cells are truncated mutations and not null mutations. These APC proteins still have the 15-aa repeat β-catenin binding domains and at least one 20-aa β-catenin binding domain. β-Catenin phosphorylation may be regulated by the β-catenin binding domains that remain in the APC mutants. The CBR fragment of APC can rescue β-catenin ubiquitination in SW480 cells. To determine which APC domains are required for β-catenin ubiquitination, we cloned truncated CBR fragments into the CS2MT vector as well as an adenovirus vector (Fig. 3A). Except for the APC fragment containing the first two 20-aa repeats (APC-I2), the expression of these APC fragments can be detected by Western blot using anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 3B). We have made several constructs for APC-I2 but were unable to detect this protein. The effects of these APC fragments on a TCF reporter were analyzed in SW480 cells. APC fragments with SAMP domains strongly inhibited the TCF reporter. An APC fragment with one or three 20-aa repeats modestly inhibited TCF reporter activity (Fig. 3C). SW480 cells were infected with several adenoviruses that express each of these APC fragments and then treated with MG132. We found that the APC fragment with the first three 20-aa repeats (APC-I3) can sufficiently rescue β-catenin ubiquitination (Fig. 3D). Control virus (GFP) or a virus containing the first 20-aa repeat (APC-I1) did not rescue β-catenin ubiquitination in SW480 cells. These data demonstrate that the second and third 20-aa repeats are required for β-catenin ubiquitination, whereas the SAMP domains are not required for β-catenin ubiquitination. It is also possible that any combination of two 20-aa repeats may be sufficient for β-catenin ubiquitination.FIGURE 3APC domains required for β-catenin ubiquitination. A, schematic representation of various truncated APC fragments incorporated into CS2MT as well as the Ad-Easy adenovirus vectors. The 15-amino acid repeats (A–C) and 20-amino acid repeats (1–7) are β-catenin binding domains, and the SAMP repeats (SAMP1–3) are Axin binding domains. B, the expression of APC fragments in HEK293T cells was analyzed by Western blot using anti-Myc antibody. C, the APC fragments were transfected into SW480 cells with both the TopFlash reporter and the Renilla reporter. The luciferase reporter was analyzed and normalized with Renilla reporter. D, SW480 cells were infected with various APC adenoviruses and then treated with MG132. β-Catenin phosphorylation and ubiquitination were analyzed by Western blot using β-catenin antibody and phospho-specific antibodies against β-catenin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)β-Catenin Localization in SW480 Cells—Since APC has a nuclear export signal, APC may regulate β-catenin subcellular localization. It has been suggested that a mutation in APC might inhibit the nuclear export of β-catenin and thus inhibit β-catenin degradation, resulting in β-catenin accumulation in the nucleus of colon cancer cells. To test whether β-catenin ubiquitination is regulated by β-catenin localization, the SW480 cells were infected with APC adenoviruses, which co-express the GFP protein, and then stained with anti-β-catenin antibody. Control virus (GFP) or an APC virus with the first 20-aa repeat (APC-I1) had no effect on the cytoplasmic levels of β-catenin (Fig. 4). β-Catenin was detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, with or without infection. APC viruses with 3–5 20-aa repeats (APC-I3, APC-I4, and APC-I5) significantly reduced the cytoplasmic β-catenin levels (Fig. 4). These data confirm that the second and third 20-aa repeats of APC are required for β-catenin degradation. We did not find a clear correlation between β-catenin localization, degradation, and APC status. Since β-catenin can be detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of SW480 cells, the inhibition of β-catenin ubiquitination is not due to the effects on β-catenin localization. Although the SAMP domains are not absolutely required for β-catenin degradation, APC-I4 and APC-I5 are more efficient in β-catenin degradation.FIGURE 4β-Catenin localization in various APC adenovirus infected SW480 cells. SW480 cells were infected with various APC adenoviruses or a control adenovirus. Cells were immunostained with a β-catenin antibody, and the nucleus was counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). GFP indicates the adenovirus-infected cells. Arrows indicate β-catenin staining in the adenovirus-infected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Function of 15-aa Repeats of APC—The 15-aa repeats also bind β-catenin. To determine whether the 15-aa repeats are required for β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation, we deleted the 15-aa repeats from the CBR fragment (Fig. 5A). We found that the CBR fragment, without 15-aa repeats (APC-II5), can sufficiently inhibit the TCF reporter and rescue β-catenin ubiquitination in SW480 cells (Fig. 5, B and C). This construct also reduced cytoplasmic β-catenin levels, suggesting that the 15-aa repeats are not required for β-catenin ubiquitination (Fig. 5D). Whether these 15-aa repeats are required for β-catenin phosphorylation is not known.FIGURE 5The function of 15-aa repeats of APC. A, schematic representation of APC fragments without 15-aa repeats (APC-II5). B, top, luciferase reporter activity was analyzed in SW480 cells transfected with APC-II5. Bottom, the expression of APC-II5 detected by an anti-Myc antibody. C, SW480 cells were infected with the APC-II5 adenovirus and then treated with MG132. Cells were analyzed with antibodies against both β-catenin and phosphorylated β-catenin. D, immunofluorescent staining of β-catenin in SW480 cells infected with APC-II5 adenovirus.

Strong β-catenin signals were detected in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. These data further confirm that β-catenin ubiquitination but not phosphorylation or nuclear export is inhibited in SW480 cells. Since β-catenin ubiquitination was inhibited in SW480 but not DLD-1 and HT29 cells, and β-Trcp couples β-catenin phosphorylation and ubiquitination, we examined the interaction between β-catenin and β-Trcp in these cells. The interaction was detected in all three cell lines, and the interaction in SW480 cells was not dependent on functional APC (Fig. 6B). A similar result has been reported using a Myc-tagged β-Trcp (12Hart M. Concordet J.P. Lassot I. Albert I. del los Santos R. Durand H. Perret C. Rubinfeld B. Margottin F. Benarous R. Polakis P. Curr.

https://openalex.org/W2080199303,"Successful treatment of multiple cancer types requires early detection and identification of reliable biomarkers present in specific cancer tissues. To test the feasibility of identifying proteins from archival cancer tissues, we have developed a methodology, termed direct tissue proteomics (DTP), which can be used to identify proteins directly from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostate cancer tissue samples. Using minute prostate biopsy sections, we demonstrate the identification of 428 prostate-expressed proteins using the shotgun method. Because the DTP method is not quantitative, we employed the absolute quantification method and demonstrate picogram level quantification of prostate-specific antigen. In depth bioinformatics analysis of these expressed proteins affords the categorization of metabolic pathways that may be important for distinct stages of prostate carcinogenesis. Furthermore, we validate Wnt-3 as an upregulated protein in cancerous prostate cells by immunohistochemistry. We propose that this general strategy provides a roadmap for successful identification of critical molecular targets of multiple cancer types."

Here, we investigate the function of the main polysaccharide fraction of Reishi (Reishi-F3) in B lymphocyte activation/differentiation. We find that Reishi-F3 causes mouse splenic B cell activation and differentiation to IgM-secreting plasma cells, and the process depends on Reishi-F3-mediated induction of Blimp-1, a master regulator capable of triggering the changes of a cascade of gene expression during plasmacytic differentiation. In human peripheral B lymphocytes, although Reishi-F3 fails to induce their activation, it is able to enhance antibody secretion, which is associated with Blimp-1 mRNA induction. The function of Reishi-F3 depends on the Toll-like receptors TLR4/TLR2 as neutralizing antibodies against TLR4/TLR2 block Reishi-F3-mediated induction of Blimp-1 mRNA and Ig secretion. We have shown that interaction of Reishi-F3 with TLR4/TLR2 followed by signaling through p38 MAPK is involved in the induction of Blimp-1 mRNA, whereas signaling through ERK, p38 MAPK, JNK, and IKK complex is involved in Reishi-F3-mediated Ig secretion. Furthermore, the differential mechanism of Reishi-F3 in mouse and human B cell activation is probably due to the presence of Blimp-1 regulatory site in human CD86 promoter.

Despite numerous studies, the precise functional mechanism of Reishi, especially with respect to its cellular receptors and the molecular marker(s) associated with its activities has not been firmly demonstrated. Additionally, it is unclear whether Reishi would directly affect the effector stage of B lymphocytes. Blimp-1 (B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1) has been shown as the master regulator for plasmacytic differentiation (12Calame K.L. Lin K.I. Tunyaplin C. Annu. Rev.

Ectopic expression of Blimp-1 is sufficient to induce plasma cell formation and immunoglobulin production from mature B cells (14Piskurich J.F. Lin K.I. Lin Y. Wang Y. Ting J.P. Calame K. Nat.

Studies from mice deficient in prdm1, the gene encoding Blimp-1, demonstrated that Blimp-1 is required for the formation of antibody-secreting cells and preplasma memory B cells (19Shapiro-Shelef M.

In addition to its crucial role in B lymphocyte terminal differentiation, Blimp-1 has also been shown to play an important role in differentiating U937 cells, a human promonocytic cell line, in response to the stimulation by phorbol 12-mysritate 13-acetate (20Chang D. Angelin-Duclos C. Calame K. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and in regulating T cell homeostasis (21Kallies A. Hawkins E.D. Belz G.T. Metcalf D. Hommel M.

Many signaling pathways involved in immune responses, including IL-2-, IL-5-, IL-6-, and IL-21-induced pathways, and the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated signaling pathway have been shown to induce the expression of Blimp-1 mRNA (13Shapiro-Shelef M.

The ability of Blimp-1 to promote the differentiation of various cell subsets in response to stimuli led us to test whether the effects of Reishi extracts in B lymphocyte correlate with Blimp-1 expression. A previous report has demonstrated that incubation of human macrophages with Reishi fraction 3 (Reishi-F3) induced the expression of many phosphotyrosyl proteins and pro-IL-1 production (4Hsu H.Y. Hua K.F. Lin C.C. Lin C.H. Hsu J. Wong C.H. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 5989-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this study, we used Reishi-F3 (25Wang Y.Y. Khoo K.H. Chen S.T. Lin C.C. Wong C.H. Lin C.H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2002; 10: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) to test its functional role in purified murine primary B cells and human peripheral B cells. We found that Reishi-F3 could induce antibody production in purified murine splenic B cells and in human peripheral B cells, both associated with the induction of Blimp-1. The Reishi-F3-mediated process is at least in part through the TLR2 and TLR4 receptors, the key players in recognizing pathogenic microorganisms in the innate immune system, and the signaling pathways downstream to TLR4 and TLR2, like p38 MAPK, appeared to be involved in Blimp-1 induction. Finally, we found that Reishi-F3 could induce mouse splenic B cell proliferation and activation, whereas it failed to do so in human peripheral B cells. Such differential effects of Reishi on CD86 expression between mice and humans might be due to the interaction of Blimp-1 with the human CD86 promoter. Reishi-F3 Preparation—The preparation of the polysaccharide-containing F3 fraction of G. lucidum (Reishi-F3) was performed essentially as previously described (4Hsu H.Y. Hua K.F. Lin C.C. Lin C.H.

Briefly, a crude powder of Reishi extract (6 g) was dissolved in 120 ml of double-distilled water, stirred at 4 °C for 12 h, and centrifuged (1000 r.p.m.) for 1 h to remove the insoluble materials. The resulting solution was concentrated at 40–50 °C to a small volume and lyophilized to generate 5 g of dark brown powder. This water-soluble residue was stored at –20 °C for further purification. Briefly, a 2.1-g sample was dissolved in a small volume of 0.1 n Tris buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.1% sodium azide and purified by gel filtration chromatography at 4 °C using a Sephacryl S-500 column (95 × 2.6 cm) with 0.1 n Tris buffer (pH 7.0) as the eluent. The flow rate was at 0.6 ml/min, and 6.0 ml/tube was collected. After the chromatography, each fraction was subjected to carbohydrate detection with phenol-H2SO4. Five fractions were collected (fractions 1–5), concentrated at 40–50 °C to give a small volume, and dialyzed to remove excessive salts and sodium azide and then lyophilized to give 520 mg (25%) of Reishi-F3. Cell Culture and Reagents—Mouse splenic B cells were purified using B220 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) from 6–8-week-old C57/Bl6 mice, prdm1f/fCD19Cre+ or prdm1f/fCD19Cre– as previously described (19Shapiro-Shelef M.

Cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (2.5 μg/ml from Sigma) or Reishi-F3 (20 μg/ml) for various time points. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by Histopaque-1077 (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Human peripheral CD19+ cells were further purified by CD19 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Enriched human B cells (purity >90%) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml), and 2 mm l-glutamine. CD19+ cells, at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml, were treated either with Reishi-F3 (20 μg/ml) or IL-4 (100 units/ml from PeproTech) plus CD40L (1 μg/ml from PeproTech) at the indicated time. Various inhibitors, including SB203580, LY294002, SP600125, PD98059, and NF-κB inhibitors, were purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-mouse TLR4 (clone HTA125), anti-human/mouse TLR2 (clone T2.5), anti-human TLR4/MD-2 (clone MTS510), and isotype control antibody, rat IgG2a, were all purchased from eBioscience. Isotype control antibodies (e.g. mouse IgG1 and mouse IgG2a) were from Sigma. 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml). RNA Isolation and RT-QPCR—Total RNA was isolated on an RNeasy spin column (Qiagen, Inc.). 1 μg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis by Sensiscript Reverse Transcriptase kit (Qiagen, Inc.) performed as per the manufacturer's suggestions. Real time quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR) was performed with TaqMan method on an ABI prism 7000 system according to the supplier's recommendation. The genespecific primers and probes sets, including prdm1 (assay ID: Mm 00476128_ml), L32 (assay ID: Mm 00777741_sH), PRDM1 (assay ID: Hs00153357_ml), and PPIA (assay ID: Hs99999904_ml) were purchased from ABI. Western Blot—Whole cell lysates from splenic B cells cultured with LPS or Reishi-F3 for 3 days were harvested and subjected to 6% SDS-PAGE as previously described (19Shapiro-Shelef M. Lin K.I.

The immunoreactive proteins were detected by an enhanced chemifluorescence kit (ECF™ Western blotting kits; Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's suggestions and the fluorescent immunocomplexes were scanned and detected by Typhoon9400 (Amersham Biosciences). ELISA and Beadlyte Human Cytokine Detection—For the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), cell supernatants were harvested by centrifugation of the culture medium once at 2000 rpm. Supernatants were then serially diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin into 96-well plates coated with anti-mouse IgM, anti-human IgM or anti-human IgG (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.) antibody and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The following procedures and methods for detecting captured mouse IgM, human IgM, or human IgG were essentially according to the manufacturer's suggestions (Bethyl Laboratories), using TMB as the substrate. The plates were subsequently read on a plate reader (Molecular Devices) at 450 nm. For the detection of multiple cytokines from Reishi-F3 treated human peripheral B cells, we essentially followed the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions). The reading was performed on a Luminex® 100™ instrument. Flow Cytometry—B cells were harvested and washed in phosphate-buffered saline once and then further resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline plus 2% fetal bovine serum at a density of 106 cell/ml. A total of 105 cells were used for each staining. Antibodies used in this study were as follows: phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse syndecan-1 (BD PharMingen), phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse anti-human CD19 (BD PharMingen), and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human CD86 (eBioscience). Cells were then analyzed by FACScalibur (BD Biosciences) and CellQuest software.

The amplified product was cloned into XhoI and HindIII sites of pGL-3B vector (Promega). The transfection procedure is essentially performed as previously described (17Lin K.I. Angelin-Duclos C. Kuo T.C. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4771-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Basically, a total of 2 × 105 3T3 cells were seeded in 6-well plates 1 day before transfection. 2 μg of luciferase reporter construct driven by CD86 promoter were cotransfected with various amounts of Blimp-1 expression vectors (pBDP1-F) or the control vector carrying the reverse sequence of Blimp-1 (pBDP1-R) by calcium phosphate method. 0.5 μg of Renilla luciferase reporter driven by thymidine kinase promoter was used in each transfection to normalize the transfection efficiency. After 2 days of transfections, cells were lysed and used for firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase assay using a Promega Dual-Luciferase Reporter® assay kit. The luminescence was measured with TopCount NXT™. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extract from P3X was prepared as previously described (16Lin Y. Wong K. Calame K. Science. 1997; 276: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and stored at –80 °C until used. DNA oligonucleotides containing Blimp-1 binding sites were synthesized and labeled with biotin using the LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's provided protocol. EMSA was performed essentially following the protocol provided by the LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce). 10 μg of nuclear extract and 30 fmol of labeled probes alone or with various amounts of excess equivalents of unlabeled oligonucleotides were incubated in the 10× binding buffer plus 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 20-μl reaction systems at room temperature for 20 min. For supershift EMSA, 1 μl of rabbit anti-Blimp-1 antibody (29Kuo T.C. Calame K.L. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 5556-5563Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) or control antibody from rabbit was incubated with 10 μg of nuclear extract 5 min before the addition of labeled probes and further incubation on ice for 20 min as described above. The entire binding reaction was loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and run at room temperature in 0.25× TBE at 110 V for 1–1.5 h. The binding complex was then transferred to nylon Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in a Trans-Blot SD semidry electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 15 V for 30 min and cross-linked in UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). The method for detection of biotin-labeled probe was according to the manufacturer's suggestion. The oligonucleotides corresponding to various Blimp-1 binding sites or control in this study were as follows: PRF, 5′-CGCGTACAGAAAGGGAAAGGACTAGCGCG-3′; CD86, 5′-AAATAATTAGAAAGAGAAAACAAACCTC-3′; nonspecific, 5′-AGCTTTAGCCGCAATATGCCGATATCC-3′. Reishi-F3 Induces Plasmacytic Differentiation in Mouse Primary Splenic B Cells—Reishi has been shown to stimulate murine splenic B lymphocyte proliferation (8Shao B.M. Dai H. Xu W. Lin Z.B. Gao X.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 9Zhang J. Tang Q. Zimmerman-Kordmann M. Reutter W. Fan H. Life Sci. 2002; 71: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), but whether Reishi has the activity to promote the plasma cell formation has not been formally addressed. Following our previous published protocols (4Hsu H.Y. Hua K.F. Lin C.C. Lin C.H. Hsu J. Wong C.H. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 5989-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25Wang Y.Y. Khoo K.H.

Med. Chem. 2004; 12: 5595-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), as described under “Experimental Procedures,” we used Reishi-F3 to investigate its mode of action in B lymphocytes. We first tested whether Reishi-F3 could have an effect on inducing the antibody secretion in purified murine B cell culture. As previously described (9Zhang J. Tang Q. Zimmerman-Kordmann M. Reutter W. Fan H. Life Sci. 2002; 71: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we observed that Reishi-F3 treatment results in B cell activation as shown by the increased expression of the activation marker, CD86, on surfaces (data not shown) and the increased proliferation of murine splenic B cells after 3 days of treatment (about 3.5-fold). Significantly, as shown in Fig. 1A, compared with cells without Reishi-F3 treatment, a dramatic induction of IgM began to be detected by ELISA after treatment of splenic B220+ B cells with Reishi-F3 for 3 days. A further increased IgM induction was observed at day 4 (Fig. 1A). A dose-dependent induction of IgM by Reishi-F3 determined at day 3 was shown in Fig. 1B. Treatment of primary murine splenic B cells cultured ex vivo with the polyclonal mitogen LPS gives rise to a burst of proliferation followed by subsequent differentiation to immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells (31Sieckmann D.G. Asofsky R. Mosier D.E. Zitron I.M. Paul W.E. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 147: 814-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 32Chen-Bettecken U. Wecker E. Schimpl A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7384-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We found that the induction of IgM secretion by Reishi-F3 is comparable with the stimulation by LPS (Fig. 1A). A robust induction of expression of plasma cell surface marker, syndecan-1 (CD138), was observed in splenic B cell culture stimulated with Reishi-F3 for 3 days (Fig. 1C). The possibility of LPS contamination during the Reishi-F3 preparation has been carefully eliminated in our studies (4Hsu H.Y. Hua K.F. Lin C.C. Lin C.H. Hsu J. Wong C.H. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 5989-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We used sodium azide during the initial preparation procedures of Reishi to prevent the growth of bacteria. NMR analysis also revealed differential signature of components between LPS and Reishi-F3. 3W.-B. Yang, unpublished data. These results suggest that Reishi-F3 may have a role in promoting plasmacytic differentiation. The ability of Reishi-F3 to induce plasma cell differentiation in ex vivo splenic B cell culture led us to investigate whether the plasma cell-dependent transcription factor is induced during this process. Blimp-1, a master regulator for plasma cell differentiation, was studied for this purpose. RT-QPCR analysis demonstrated that, like the positive control with LPS, Reishi-F3 induced the expression of Blimp-1 mRNA after 3 days of treatment (Fig. 1D). The induction of Blimp-1 protein was also detected by Western blot analysis after 3 days of Reishi-F3 treatment (Fig. 1E). Studies of B lymphocyte lineage-specific deletion of prdm1 have shown that Blimp-1 is essential for generation of IgM-secreting cells in response to LPS in ex vivo splenic B cell culture (19Shapiro-Shelef M. Lin K.I. McHeyzer-Williams L.J. Liao J. McHeyzer-Williams M.G. Calame K. Immunity. 2003; 19: 607-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). We took advantage of this system and determined whether Blimp-1 is required for Reishi-F3-mediated IgM secretion. We found that Reishi-F3 as well as LPS treatment failed to induce IgM secretion of splenic B cells from prdm1 knock-out B cells (prdm1f/f CD19Cre+); in contrast, control B cells (prdm1f/f CD19Cre–) differentiate normally (Fig. 1F). These data together indicated that Reishi-F3 could trigger a signaling cascade to activate plasmacytic differentiation, which required the induction and expression of the plasma cell transcription factor Blimp-1. TLR4/TLR2-mediated Pathways Are Required for Reishi-F3 Activities in Primary Mouse Splenic B Cells—Having established the ability of Reishi to induce primary murine splenic B cell differentiation, we further investigated the signaling pathways utilized by Reishi-F3 for the induction of Blimp-1 expression during plasmacytic differentiation. It has been shown that B cells from C3H/HeJ mice with mutated TLR4 signaling failed to respond to Reishi in the proliferation assay (8Shao B.M. Dai H. Xu W. Lin Z.B. Gao X.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Additionally, rat anti-mouse TLR4 monoclonal antibody inhibited the proliferation of BALB/c mouse B cells under Reishi treatment (8Shao B.M. Dai H. Xu W. Lin Z.B. Gao X.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Since a recent paper indicated that TLRs have a direct role in B-cell activation and antibody production (33Pasare C. Medzhitov R. Nature. 2005; 438: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), we tested whether TLRs, such as TLR2 and TLR4, which recognize carbohydrate ligands, are involved in the effects of Reishi-F3 on B cells. TLR2 can recognize a broad range of ligands, including peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid, or the lipopolysaccharide component present in various pathogens such as Leptospira interrogans (34Wetzler L.M. Vaccine. 2003; 21: S55-S60Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 35Werts C. Tapping R.I. Mathison J.C. Chuang T.H. Kravchenko V. Saint Girons I. Haake D.A. Godowski P.J. Hayashi F. Ozinsky A.

Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6702) Google Scholar). We found that the induction of IgM secretion upon Reishi-F3 treatment is blocked by the treatment of anti-TLR4 and anti-TLR2 antibodies in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). The effect of inhibition is neither additive nor synergetic upon the treatment of anti-TLR4 and anti-TLR2 together (Fig. 2A), suggesting that a common signaling pathway was utilized upon the conjugation of TLR4/TLR2 with the ligands in Reishi-F3. LPS-dependent induction of IgM secretion could only be blocked by anti-TLR4 antibody (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrated that, unlike LPS, Reishi F3 clearly uses an additional set of receptor(s) for stimulation of plasmacytic differentiation in B cells. To determine whether Reishi-F3-mediated induction of Blimp-1 is through the TLR4 and/or TLR2, the levels of Blimp-1 mRNA induction by Reishi-F3 plus the treatment of anti-mouse TLR4 or TLR2 antibody were monitored by RT-QPCR. Similar to the effects of anti-mouse TLR4 antibody in LPS-treated B cells, the addition of neutralizing antibodies to TLR4 and TLR2 resulted in about 2-fold repression of Blimp-1 mRNA induction in response to Reishi-F3 treatment (Fig. 2B), indicating that both TLR4 and TLR2 signaling pathways ultimately trigger the expression of the master regulator of plasma cell differentiation, Blimp-1, in B cells. Signaling through TLR2 or TLR4 can activate the signaling cascade of MyD88/TIRAP-IRAK1-TRAF6-TAK1 (36Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6702) Google Scholar, 37Peng S.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2005; 17: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), which in turn causes the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including p38 (38Nick J.A. Avdi N.J.

https://openalex.org/W1992686564,"Historically, most studies attribute p53 function to the transactivation of target genes. That p53 can selectively repress genes to affect a cellular response is less widely appreciated. Available evidence suggests that repression is important for p53-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. To better establish the scope of p53-repressed target genes and the cellular processes they may affect, a global expression profiling strategy was used to identify p53-responsive genes following adenoviral p53 gene transfer (Ad-p53) in PC3 prostate cancer cells. A total of 111 genes, 0.77% of the 14,500 genes represented on the Affymetrix U133A microarray, were repressed more than 2-fold (p ≤ 0.05). Validation of the array data, using reverse transcription-PCR of 20 randomly selected genes, yielded a confirmation rate of >95.5% for the complete data set. Functional over-representation analysis revealed that cell cycle regulatory genes exhibited a highly significant enrichment (p ≤ 5 × 10–28) within the transrepressed targets. 41% of the repressed targets are cell cycle regulators. A subset of these genes exhibited repression following DNA damage, preceding cell cycle arrest, in LNCaP cells. The use of a p53 small interfering RNA strategy in LNCaP cells and the use of p53-null cell lines demonstrated that this repression is p53-dependent. These findings identify a set of genes not known previously to be down-regulated by p53 and indicate that p53-induced cell cycle arrest is a function of not only the transactivation of cell cycle inhibitors (e.g. p21) but also the repression of targets that regulate proliferation at several distinct phases of the cell cycle.

Instances of DNA damage, resulting in gene mutation or deletion, are critical events that contribute to tumor formation. Accordingly, cells possess sophisticated mechanisms to detect and respond to DNA damage. One such mechanism is the activation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. High levels of activated and stabilized p53 protein accumulate in the nucleus in response to various forms of cell stress, including DNA damage (1Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2692) Google Scholar, 2Levine A.J. Momand J. Finlay C.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3642) Google Scholar). Activated p53 can induce cell cycle arrest, DNA repair processes, and apoptosis. These cellular outcomes are thought to minimize the accumulation of deleterious mutations that could eventually contribute to a malignant phenotype (3Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4436) Google Scholar). The importance of this pathway is highlighted by the observation that over 50% of cancers have acquired p53 gene mutations, ostensibly allowing the tumors to bypass this p53 checkpoint (4Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7411) Google Scholar, 5Hollstein M. Rice K. Greenblatt M.S. Soussi T. Fuchs R. Sorlie T. Hovig E. Smith-Sorensen B. Montesano R. Harris C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3551-3555PubMed Google Scholar).Although transcription-independent functions exist, p53 mediates its effects largely by regulating the expression of downstream target genes (6Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar, 7el-Deiry W.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Most studies investigating p53 function have focused attention on the genes transactivated by p53. However, it is recognized that repression of target genes may be important for p53-induced cell death and cell cycle arrest. For example, trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, inhibits the repression of p53 targets and the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis (8Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Additionally, cell cycle regulators such as cdc2 and cyclin B can be repressed by p53 (9Taylor W.R. Schonthal A.H. Galante J. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1998-2006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Krause K. Wasner M. Reinhard W. Haugwitz U. Dohna C.L. Mossner J. Engeland K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4410-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Beyond apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, p53 can affect other cellular processes including DNA repair, senescence, and differentiation (1Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2692) Google Scholar). Despite documented examples (11Miyashita T. Harigai M. Hanada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3131-3135PubMed Google Scholar, 12Murphy M. Hinman A. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2971-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), relatively little is known regarding the genes transcriptionally repressed by p53 and what roles they play in mediating p53 function. These repressed genes are of further interest in that they may potentially be overexpressed as a consequence of somatic p53 mutation during cancer progression.Using high density oligonucleotide microarrays we identified a total of 111 genes that were significantly repressed following adenoviral p53 gene transfer (Ad-p53) in PC3 prostate cancer cells. Functional over-representation analysis was used to objectively identify which cellular processes were influenced by p53-mediated repression. Notably, nearly half of the repressed genes (45 of 111 genes) are involved in cell cycle regulation. This represents a highly significant enrichment of this functional category within the repressed targets compared with the microarray as a whole. Importantly, several cell cycle genes were repressed after genotoxic stress only in cells harboring wild type p53 alleles and before cell cycle arrest is evident. The p53-dependent nature of this repression was further demonstrated using a p53 knockdown strategy. These findings identify cell cycle regulatory genes previously unrecognized as p53-responsive and indicate that p53-induced cell cycle arrest is a function of not only the transactivation of cell cycle inhibitors (e.g. p21), but also the repression of targets that regulate proliferation at several distinct phases of the cell cycle.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines—The PC3 and LNCaP prostate carcinoma cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cell culture conditions, along with the generation and characterization of stable vector control (PC3-BN) and BCL2-overexpressing (PC3-BCL2) PC3 cells have been described (13Spurgers K.B.

Younes A. Li Y. Meyn R.E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3757-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Where noted, the cells were treated with etoposide (Sigma) dissolved in Me2SO added directly to the complete media of monolayer cultures (10 μg/ml). Cycloheximide (CHX) 3The abbreviations used are: CHX, cycloheximide; RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; GO, gene ontology. (Sigma) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline was also added directly to the complete medium of monolayer cultures at a final concentration of 7.5 μg/ml. Me2SO and etoposide were added at time 0 and left on for the indicated durations. CHX was added directly to the culture media 2 h after the addition of etoposide.Adenovirus Infection and Microarray Hybridization—All of the adenoviral vector constructs were maintained by the Vector Core Facility of the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX). Construction of the recombinant, replication-deficient, type 5 adenovirus expressing human p53 (Ad-p53) and the experimental parameters and procedures used in this study have been described (13Spurgers K.B. Coombes K.R. Meyn R.E. Gold D.L. Logothetis C.J. Johnson T.J. McDonnell T.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1712-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 15Zhang W.W. Fang X. Mazur W. French B.A. Georges R.N. Roth J.A. Cancer Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 5-13PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PC3 cells were infected with control virus expressing β-galactosidase (Ad-LacZ) or with Ad-p53 at 1,000 virus particles/cell. RNA was harvested 19 h after infection. Target preparation and Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) U133A GeneChip hybridizations have been described (16Gold D. Coombes K. Medhane D. Ramaswamy A. Ju Z. Strong L. Koo J.S. Kapoor M. BMC Genomics. 2004; 5: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and were carried out by the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Microarray Core Facility (Houston, TX).Array Data Analysis—The arrays were preprocessed with dCHIP version 1.3 software (www.dchip.org). Gene expression was obtained after normalization with the Perfect Match only model (17Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar). dCHIP array level quality metrics were examined to identify outliers. The arrays were also assessed for brightness, alignment calibration, and spatial variation following the methods of Gold et al. (16Gold D. Coombes K. Medhane D. Ramaswamy A. Ju Z. Strong L. Koo J.S. Kapoor M. BMC Genomics. 2004; 5: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Initially, a detection filter was applied to retain only those probe sets called present by dCHIP in all six replicates of at least one biological factor combination. Of the 22,283 probe sets on the U133A microarray, 12,308 met this detection criterion. The log2-transformed expressions of the probe sets were modeled linearly,log2(Yijkg)=μg+αig+βjg+αβij+ϵijkgϵijkg∼N(0,σg2)(Eq. 1) for i = j = 1–2, k = 1–6, and g = 1–12,308, in α for the presence of a p53 effect, β for a BCL2 effect, and αβ for p53-BCL2 interaction. Here μ accounts for expected log2 expression. Unexplained random variation ϵ was assumed normally distributed with expectation 0 and variance σg2. We explored possible hybridization day and RNA extraction contributions to variation in gene expression across arrays. These were not considerable, agreeing with hierarchical cluster analysis and thus were omitted from Equations 1 and 2. Genes with significantly altered expression were identified using an F-statistic pass at the 0.05 Bonferroni-corrected significance level (p < 0.05/12,038) to test the hypothesis that the control factors in Equation 1 were simultaneously zero,H0:αig=βjg=αβij=0Ha:atleastonefactor≠0(Eq. 2) versus the alternative that at least one term was not zero. 5,080 of the 12,038 detectable probe sets had a significant F-statistic at the Bonferroni adjusted level. Gene discovery proceeded with a pass for significant p53 effects exceeding a fold change of 2, corresponding to |α2g| ≥ 1 on the log2 scale. Individual t-statistics for the hypotheses Ho: –1 < α2g < 1 Ha: α2g ≤ –1 or α2g ≥ 1 were tested at a 0.05 Bonferroni adjusted significance level. While accounting for p53-BCL2 interactions, we found 391 probe sets with significant change coincidental with p53 expression beyond a fold change of 2. These 391 probe sets correspond to 335 unique genes (224 up-regulated and 111 repressed following p53 expression).Hierarchical Cluster Analysis—We compared relative sources of variation between arrays by using hierarchical cluster analysis. We required probe sets to have expression levels above the median signal on at least six arrays to be included in the analysis (n = 10,625 probe sets). Hierarchical cluster analysis was applied with complete linkage and Euclidean distance on log2 expression. Furthermore, the respective profiles for probe set targets of p53 were examined on the log2 scale.Estimation of Array Data False Positive Rate—A random number generator following a discrete uniform distribution was used to select 20 differentially expressed genes for verification. To estimate the fraction φ of “true positives” on our list of differentially expressed genes, we modeled the number of successful confirmations as a binomial random variable X = ∼Binom(N,φ). A Bayesian statistical method was used to estimate the probability distribution of φ. We looked at various beta prior distributions, φ =∼Beta(2p, 2(1–p)), corresponding to different choices of the parameter p, the prior probability of confirmation. The posterior distribution of φ, conditional on confirming k of N genes, is another beta distribution, Beta(2p + k, 2(1–p) + N–k). All 20 of the genes tested were successfully confirmed, giving posterior distributions of the form Beta(2p + 20, 2(1–p) + 20). We computed the expected value and 95% confidence interval for the confirmation rate φ for a wide range of prior distributions.RT-PCR—For RT-PCRs, 3 μg of total RNA was combined with 500 ng of oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 12 μl, heated at 70 °C for 10 min, and then placed on ice. Reverse transcription reactions (20 μl) were then assembled with final concentrations of 1× reaction buffer, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm dNTPs, and 100 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Two percent of the RT reaction was used as input for each PCR. PCRs (50 μl) were assembled with final concentrations of 1× buffer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.2 μm of each primer, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). Primers were obtained from Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). The sequence of each primer is available upon request. PCR cycle parameters were as follows: initial step of 95 °C for 5 min and then 20–35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, annealing temperature of 59–61 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s, and a final step of 72 °C for 5 min. The cycle number that allows for end point analysis during linear amplification was determined empirically.Functional Over-representation Analysis—The Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer software package was used to identify biological themes that are significantly enriched in our list of p53-repressed genes (18Hosack D.A. Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gene categories with an Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer score of ≤0.05 were considered significantly enriched. Bonferroni multiplicity correction was not employed.siRNA Transfection—LNCaP cells were transfected with p53-specific or p21waf1-specific siRNA SmartPool duplexes or nontargeting siRNA number 1 (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) at a final concentration of 100 nm. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. A total of 30 and 60 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 were used for each 60-mm and 10-cm plate, respectively. Transfection medium was replaced with fresh complete medium after 7 h.Western Blot—Western blots were generated and probed as described (13Spurgers K.B. Coombes K.R. Meyn R.E. Gold D.L. Logothetis C.J. Johnson T.J. McDonnell T.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1712-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were anti-p53 at 1:1,500 (Bp53-12; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-p21 at 1:500 (Ab-1; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), and antiactin at 1:1,000 (AC-40; Sigma).BrdUrd Incorporation—BrdUrd incorporation was measured in LNCaP cells using the BrdUrd Flow Kit (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol with some modifications. BrdUrd was added directly to culture medium at a final concentration of 10 μm. Forty minutes after the addition of BrdUrd, the cells were harvested with trypsin, washed once in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 100 μl of Cytofix/Cytoperm for 30 min at room temperature. Incubation with Cytoperm Plus and a second fixation with Cytofix/Cytoperm were omitted. The cells were read on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).RESULTSIdentification of p53-responsive Genes—The microarray expression profiling experiments performed here were originally designed to assess p53-responsive gene expression and the extent to which this process could be modulated by BCL2 (13Spurgers K.B. Coombes K.R. Meyn R.E. Gold D.L. Logothetis C.J. Johnson T.J. McDonnell T.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1712-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). BCL2 expression is associated with androgen-independent prostate cancer, tumor progression, and resistance to therapy (19McDonnell T.J. Troncoso P. Brisbay S.M. Logothetis C. Chung L.W. Hsieh J.T.

Additionally, the BCL2 proto-oncogene can inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis and may act, in part, by modulating the transcriptional response of select p53 target genes (21Beham A. Marin M.C. Fernandez A. Herrmann J. Brisbay S. Tari A.M. Lopez-Berestein G. Lozano G. Sarkiss M. McDonnell T.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 6469-6475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We used Affymetrix U133A microarrays and an adenovirus p53 (Ad-p53) expression system to identify p53-responsive genes in stable vector control (PC3-BN) and BCL2 overexpressing (PC3-BCL2) PC3 prostate cancer cells (13Spurgers K.B. Coombes K.R. Meyn R.E. Gold D.L. Logothetis C.J. Johnson T.J. McDonnell T.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1712-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For each cell line, the probes for the arrays were generated from RNA harvested 19 h after infection with control adenovirus (Ad-LacZ) or Ad-p53.Microarray experiments and subsequent statistical analysis were designed to minimize the effect of inherent experimental variation. Six replicate hybridizations (with probes from two independent virus infections and RNA extractions) were performed for each cell line/treatment combination. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to assess sources of variation across the arrays. The most dominant feature affecting the clustering was p53 expression (not shown). RNA extraction or hybridization day were insignificant sources of variation across arrays.To identify p53-responsive genes, control virus treatments were compared with Ad-p53 treatments. A total of 111 genes were repressed (fold change ≥ 2, p ≤ 0.05) in both PC3-BN and PC3-BCL2 cell lines following p53 expression. The repression of these 111 genes was not affected by BCL2 overexpression. No genes were detected that were repressed in one cell line and not the other. The complete list of p53-repressed genes is available as supplementary data (supplemental Table S1).Objective Assessment of Array Data Reliability—Given the nature of microarray experiments and the statistical methods employed, the presence of false positives is inherent in any evaluation of differentially expressed genes. With this in mind, we objectively assessed the false positive rate within our final data set. In addition to p53-repressed genes, we also identified genes transcriptionally activated in response to p53. Twenty genes were chosen at random (10 activated and 10 repressed) and tested for a response to p53 by RT-PCR. The expression patterns of all 20 genes were validated (Fig. 1 and not shown). Given this data, we used a Bayesian statistical method to estimate the false positive rate for the complete data set. Using a neutral, uniform, prior probability for confirmation, the estimate of the confirmation rate is 95.5% with a 95% confidence interval of 86.7–100%. Thus, ∼4.5% of the genes identified as differentially expressed are expected to be false positives.Even with a very low expected frequency of false positives, our data set does contain at least some false negative results. For example, survivin is strongly down-regulated in PC3 cells following Ad-p53 treatment (13Spurgers K.B. Coombes K.R. Meyn R.E. Gold D.L. Logothetis C.J. Johnson T.J. McDonnell T.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1712-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This gene is represented on the U133A microarray but was not identified as a p53-repressed target in our analysis. Despite the presence of some false negatives, our data set shows considerable overlap with published expression profiling studies looking at p53-responsive gene expression and also identifies novel p53 target genes (23Kho P.S.

Specifically, the percentage of p53-repressed genes with a given gene ontology (GO) annotation was compared with the percentage of genes on the Affymetrix U133A GeneChip with the same annotation. A significant p value (p ≤ 0.05) indicates that the observed percentage of p53-repressed genes with a given annotation could not likely occur by chance given the frequency of genes on the microarray with the same annotation. Fig. 2 displays nine GO categories that were significantly enriched (p ≤ 0.05) in our list of p53-repressed genes. The GO annotation “cell cycle” shows the most significant enrichment. Specifically, 45 of the 111 p53-repressed genes identified in our study are involved in cell cycle regulation (Table 1). Most of these genes also have more specific GO annotations suggesting that several phases of the cell cycle are affected by p53-mediated transcriptional repression. × indicates that the gene product has a GO annotation for that specific cell cycle phase (Table 1). Genes that harbor consensus p53 DNA-binding sites, based on the data of Hoh et al. (25Hoh J. Jin S. Parrado T. Edington J. Levine A.J. Ott J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8467-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), are also indicated. Other GO categories of interest significantly enriched within the repressed targets include DNA repair, nucleotide metabolism, and DNA packaging (supplemental Table S2).FIGURE 2Functional over-representation analysis. Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer software was used to compare the percentage of p53-repressed genes with a given GO annotation to the percentage of genes on the Affymetrix U133A GeneChip with the same annotation. Each gene category shown is significantly enriched in our list of p53-repressed genes (p ≤ 0.05). The p value for each category is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1p53-repressed cell cycle regulatory genesProbeSymbolGene nameG1G1/SSG2/MMp53 site203968_s_atCDC6Cell division cycle 6 homolog××××Yes204510_atCDC7Cell division cycle 7×××203213_atCDC2Cell division cycle 2, CDK1××203418_atCCNA2Cyclin A2×××Yes204695_atCDC25ACell division cycle 25A×××Yes202246_s_atCDK4Cyclin-dependent kinase 4×Yes205393_s_atCHEK1CHK1 checkpoint homolog (Schizosaccharomyces pombe)××Yes211814_s_atCCNE2Cyclin E2××Yes204244_s_atASKActivator of S phase kinase×222037_atMCM4Minichromosome maintenance deficient 4×202107_s_atMCM2Minichromosome maintenance deficient 2×Yes201555_atMCM3Minichromosome maintenance deficient 3×Yes201930_atMCM6Minichromosome maintenance deficient 6×Yes210983_s_atMCM7Minichromosome maintenance deficient 7×Yes201890_atRRM2Ribonucleotide reductase M2 polypeptide×Yes208956_x_atDUTdUTP pyrophosphatase×204767_s_atFEN1Flap structure-specific endonuclease 1×211450_s_atMSH6mutS homolog 6 (Escherichia coli)×209421_atMSH2mutS homolog 2×205909_atPOLE2Polymerase (DNA directed), epsilon 2 (p59 subunit)×205053_atPRIM1Primase, polypeptide 1, 49 kDa×204127_atRFC3Replication factor C (activator 1) 3×201292_atTOP2ATopoisomerase (DNA) IIα 170 kDa×221521_s_atPSF2DNA replication complex GINS protein PSF2×209832_s_atCDT1DNA replication factor×202870_s_atCDC20Cell division cycle 20 homolog×Yes218009_s_atPRC1Protein regulator of cytokinesis 1×Yes204641_atNEK2NIMA (never in mitosis gene a)-related kinase 2×204709_s_atKIF23Kinesin family member 23×202954_atUBE2CUbiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2×203362_s_atMAD2L1MAD2 mitotic arrest deficient-like 1 (yeast)×Yes209642_atBUB1Budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1 homolog (yeast)×203755_atBUB1BBudding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1 homolog β (yeast)×207828_s_atCENPFCentromere protein F×208079_s_atSTK6Serine/threonine kinase 6, BTAK, STK15, AURA×209259_s_atCSPG6Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 6 (bamacan)×201663_s_atSMC4L1SMC4 structural maintenance of chromosomes 4-like 1×204162_atKNTC2Kinetochore-associated 2×204240_s_atSMC2L1Structural maintenance of chromosomes 2-like 1×210052_s_atTPX2Microtubule-associated protein homolog (Xenopus laevis)×219494_atRAD54BRAD54 homolog B (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)×219148_atTOPKT-LAK cell-originated protein k×218662_s_atHCAP-GChromosome condensation protein G×202431_s_atMYCv-Myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (c-Myc)209464_atAURKBAurora kinase B, STK12 Open table in a new tab p53-dependent Repression of Cell Cycle Genes Following DNA Damage—To assess the potential relevance of our findings, we determined whether any of these genes respond to endogenous p53 after DNA damage. Several genes were tested for a response to DNA damage in LNCaP cells (p53 wild type) and the p53-null PC3 cell line (26Carroll A.G. Voeller H.J. Sugars L. Gelmann E.P. Prostate. 1993; 23: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 27Rubin S.J. Hallahan D.E. Ashman C.R. Brachman D.G. Beckett M.A. Virudachalam S. Yandell D.W. Weichselbaum R.R. J. Surg. Oncol. 1991; 46: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Etoposide, a chemotherapeutic agent that causes DNA double strand breaks, induced p53 protein accumulation in LNCaP cells (Fig. 3A). Induction of the cell cycle inhibitor p21waf1, a well characterized direct p53 target, was also observed. In concordance with these data, LNCaP cells undergo cell cycle arrest in response to etoposide treatment. As indicated by BrdUrd incorporation, a significant fraction of LNCaP cells are still synthesizing DNA 8 h after treatment (Fig. 3B). However, the cells are fully arrested 24 h after treatment with few, if any, exhibiting BrdUrd incorporation. By scoring cells with a sub-G1 DNA content as apoptotic, we confirmed that LNCaP cells are not undergoing apoptosis over this time course (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3LNCaP cells exhibit p53 and p21 protein accumulation, and cell cycle arrest, in response to etoposide treatment. A, LNCaP cells were not treated (NT), mock treated with Me2SO (M), or treated with etoposide for the indicated time. Western blot analysis was performed for p53, p21 and actin. B, LNCaP cells were treated with etoposide for 8 or 24 h, or not treated (NT). Cells synthesizing DNA were scored by detection of incorporated BrdUrd. The percentages of cells positive for BrdUrd incorporation are shown. C, DNA content histograms were generated from the data in B.

https://openalex.org/W2001212328,"The tetraspanin membrane protein CD151 has been suggested to regulate cancer invasion and metastasis by initiating signaling events. The CD151-mediated signaling pathways involved in this regulation remain to be revealed. In this study, we found that stable transfection of CD151 into MelJuSo human melanoma cells lacking CD151 expression significantly increased cell motility, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression, and invasiveness. The enhancement of cell motility and MMP-9 expression by CD151 overexpression was abrogated by inhibitors and small interfering RNAs targeted to focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src, p38 MAPK, and JNK, suggesting an essential role of these signaling components in CD151 signaling pathways. Also, CD151-induced MMP-9 expression was shown to be mediated by c-Jun binding to AP-1 sites in the MMP-9 gene promoter, indicating AP-1 activation by CD151 signaling pathways. Meanwhile, CD151 was found to be associated with α3β1 and α6β1 integrins in MelJuSo cells, and activation of associated integrins was a prerequisite for CD151-stimulated MMP-9 expression and activation of FAK, Src, p38 MAPK, JNK, and c-Jun. Furthermore, CD151 on one cell was shown to bind to neighboring cells expressing CD151, suggesting that CD151 is a homophilic interacting protein. The homophilic interactions of CD151 increased motility and MMP-9 expression of CD151-transfected MelJuSo cells, along with FAK-, Src-, p38 MAPK-, and JNK-mediated activation of c-Jun in an adhesion-dependent manner. Furthermore, C8161 melanoma cells with endogenous CD151 were also shown to respond to homophilic CD151 interactions for the induction of adhesion-dependent activation of FAK, Src, and c-Jun. These results suggest that homophilic interactions of CD151 stimulate integrin-dependent signaling to c-Jun through FAK-Src-MAPKs pathways in human melanoma cells, leading to enhanced cell motility and MMP-9 expression.

CD151 (PETA-3/SFA-1) is a member of the tetraspanins (also known as the transmembrane 4 superfamily), a group of membrane proteins that have four highly conserved transmembrane domains (1Fitter S. Tetaz T.J. Berndt M.C. Ashman L.K. Blood. 1995; 86: 1348-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hasegawa H. Utsunomiya Y. Kishimoto K. Yanagisawa K. Fujita S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3258-3263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tetraspanins have been suggested to play important roles in the regulation of various cellular functions, including cell activation, proliferation, differentiation, development, adhesion, and motility (3Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 4Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Cell Mol.

Although the biochemical function(s) of tetraspanins remains unclear, the capability of tetraspanin proteins to associate with each other and with several other membrane proteins involved in signaling pathways suggests that tetraspanins may act as molecular adaptors facilitating the assembly of functional signaling complexes in the membrane (4Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1189-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 6Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The protein CD151 is expressed in various cell types, including epidermal basal cells, epithelial cells, skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscle, endothelial cells, platelets, and Schwann cells (7Sincock P.M. Mayrhofer G. Ashman L.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although the physiological function of CD151 is largely unknown, in vitro functional studies showed that CD151 is involved in cell adhesion, motility, and polarity (8Yauch R.L. Berditchevski F. Harler M.B. Reichner J. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2751-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 9Penas P.F. Garcia-Diez A. Sanchez-Madrid F. Yanez-Mo M. J. Invest.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 577-587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, CD151 was reported to be a positive effector of metastasis, which is contrary to the metastasis-suppressing role of other tetraspanins, such as CD9/MRP-1, CD63/ME-491, and CD82/KAI-1. High CD151 expression was found to be associated with a poor prognosis in lung, colon, and prostate cancer (11Tokuhara T. Hasegawa H. Hattori N. Ishida H. Taki T. Tachibana S. Sasaki S. Miyake M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 4109-4114PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hashida H. Takabayashi A. Tokuhara T. Hattori N. Taki T. Hasegawa H. Satoh S. Kobayashi N. Yamaoka Y. Miyake M. Br. J.

Monoclonal antibodies to CD151 inhibited in vivo metastasis of human cancer cells and transfection of CD151 cDNA into different tumor cell lines resulted in enhanced cell motility and metastasis (14Testa J.E. Brooks P.C. Lin J.M. Quigley J.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3812-3820PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kohno M. Hasegawa H. Miyake M. Yamamoto T. Fujita S. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This implies that CD151 does not only play an important role in normal physiological processes but also in pathological events, such as tumor cell invasion and metastasis. CD151 is predominantly localized on the cell surface in contact with basement membranes and to a lesser extent at cell-cell junctions in epithelial cells (7Sincock P.M. Mayrhofer G. Ashman L.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 16Sterk L.M. Geuijen C.A. Oomen L.C. Calafat J. Janssen H. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 969-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). CD151 forms a multimolecular complex with many other transmembrane proteins. CD151 has been found to form very strong complexes with the α3β1 integrin; moderately stable complexes with α6β1, α6β4, and α7β1 integrins; and less stable, possibly indirect complexes with other integrins, E-cadherin, and other tetraspanins (4Boucheix C.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Since cellular processes regulated by CD151 (such as cell adhesion, migration, and spreading) are integrin-mediated adhesive events, it has been proposed that CD151 modulates integrin activity and function. It was recently demonstrated that CD151 association increases the binding activity of integrin α3β1 to laminin through stabilizing its activated conformation (20Nishiuchi R. Sanzen N. Nada S. Sumida Y. Wada Y. Okada M. Takagi J. Hasegawa H. Sekiguchi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1939-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It was also reported that CD151 regulates platelet function by modulating outside-in signaling events of the major platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (21Lau L.M. Wee J.L. Wright M.D. Moseley G.W. Hogarth P.M. Ashman L.K. Jackson D.E. Blood. 2004; 104: 2368-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition to integrin association, CD151 associates with phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase and protein kinase C on the cytosolic surface, thereby linking integrins to these signaling molecules (8Yauch R.L. Berditchevski F. Harler M.B. Reichner J. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2751-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 22Zhang X.A. Bontrager A.L. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25005-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). CD151 has also been shown to regulate expression of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase, PTPμ, and its recruitment to cell-cell junctions (19Chattopadhyay N. Wang Z. Ashman L.K. Brady-Kalnay S.M. Kreidberg J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and to inhibit adhesion-dependent activation of Ras (23Sawada S. Yoshimoto M. Odintsova E. Hotchin N.A. Berditchevski F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26323-26326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It thus appears that the intracellular signaling pathways initiated by integrin binding to the extracellular matrix could be altered by the integrin-associated tetraspanin CD151. Taken together, CD151 is thought to participate in adhesion-dependent transmembrane signaling pathways by modulating integrin activity and modifying integrin-mediated outside-in signaling pathways as well. However, the modified integrin signaling pathways by which CD151 manifests its activity have not been established. In this report, we investigated the functional effects of CD151 expression on cellular activities related to cancer invasion and metastasis and then attempted to identify CD151-mediated signaling pathways for the induction of such cellular functions. We showed that CD151 increases motility and MMP 2The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPKAPK-2, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered protein; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethane-sulfonic acid. -9 expression of human melanoma cells through adhesion-dependent c-Jun activation-signaling pathways. Furthermore, we established that these signaling pathways are initiated not only by the matrix binding of integrin molecules but also by homophilic interactions between CD151 proteins on the surface of neighboring cells. Finally, detailed analysis of signaling events indicated that the CD151-α3β1/α6β1 integrin complexes increase c-Jun activity through the activation of FAK, Src, p38 MAPK, and JNK.

Monoclonal antibodies against CD151, CD9, and CD63 were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Antibodies to FAK, phospho-FAKTyr-925, Src, phospho-SrcTyr-416, ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2Thr-202/Tyr-204, p38 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPKThr-180/Tyr-182, JNK, phospho-JNKThr-183/Tyr-185, c-Jun, phospho-c-JunSer-63/Ser-73, and paxillin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to MAPKAPK-2 and phospho-MAPKAPK-2Thr-334 were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). PD98059, PP1, SB203580, and SP600125 were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). All other reagents were from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Transfection of CD151 cDNA and Selection of Stable Clones—Full-length CD151 cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI/KpnI sites of a pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), downstream of a cyto-megalovirus promoter. The CD151 cDNA expression construct was transfected into MelJuSo human melanoma cells by using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. pcDNA3 vector only was also transfected as a control. Neomycin-resistant clones were isolated by growing the cells in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Stable transfectant clones were characterized by immunoblotting and flow cytometric analyses for their expression levels of CD151 protein. Transfection of Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—siRNAs for FAK, src, p38 MAPK, and JNK were designed and synthesized using the software and Silencer™ siRNA construction kit from Ambion (Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specific oligonucleotide sequences for each target gene were as follows: 5′-GAGAAGGCUCAGCAAGAAGdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CUUCUUGCUGAGCCUUCUCdTdT-3′ (antisense) targeting FAK; 5′-GUGCAUUAAGAACGACGCCdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGCGUCGUUCUUAAUGCACdTdT-3′ (antisense) targeting src; 5′-AGCAGGGACCUCCUUAUAGdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CUAUAAGGAGGUCCCUGCUdTdT-3′ (antisense) targeting p38 MAPK; 5′-UGUCUGGUAUGAUCCUUCUdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGAAGGAUCAUACCAGACAdTdT-3′ (antisense) targeting JNK; 5′-CAUCACCUAUUGGAUCCAAdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-UUGGAUCCAAUAGGUGAUGdTdT-3′ (antisense) targeting MMP-9. The siRNA control was 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAAdTdT-3′ (antisense), which bears no homology with relevant human genes (26Duxbury M.S. Ito H. Zinner M.J. Ashley S.W. Whang E.E. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). For siRNA transfection, cells (5 × 105) were seeded in 6-well plates and grown for 24 h to reach 60–70% confluence. The different amounts of siRNA and the Lipofectamine reagent (5 μl) were diluted in 200 μl of DMEM/F-12 medium. The diluted siRNA-liposome complex was added to cells in DMEM/F-12 medium (800 μl). Following a 6-h incubation, cells were rinsed with fresh medium and grown for 24 h in normal growth medium containing fetal bovine serum before analysis. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total cellular RNA was purified from the cultured cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with 1 μg of total RNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (Promega, Madison, WI). For PCR amplification, 5′-aaggtaccaggatgggtgagttcaacgag-3′ was used as the sense primer, and 5′-atgaattcggtcagtagtgctccagcttg-3′ was used as the antisense primer. This primer pair amplifies a 760-bp fragment of CD151 cDNA. The reaction mixture was subjected to 25 PCR amplification cycles of 60 s at 94 °C, 90 s at 55 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C. β-Actin amplification was used as an internal PCR control (27Nakajima-Iijima S. Hamada H. Reddy P. Kakunaga T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6133-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) with 5′-gatatcgccgcgctcgtcgtcgac-3′ as the sense primer and 5′-caggaaggaaggctggaagagtgc-3′ as the antisense primer. The PCR products were visualized using ethidium bromide in 1% agarose gel. Immunoblotting Analysis—Cells were washed, harvested, and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm benzimidine) on ice for 10 min. For phosphoprotein analysis, cell lysis buffer was supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate). After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatants were collected and quantified for protein concentration by Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein per lane were separated onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to an Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) membrane. The membrane was blocked in 5% skim milk for 2 h and then incubated with a specific antibody for 2 h. After washing, the membrane was incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. After final washes, the membrane was developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-CD151 monoclonal antibody (mAb) for 30 min, washed with cold PBS, and then incubated with saturating concentrations of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (PharMingen) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, the cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS. Cell surface immunofluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry performed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Brij 98 or 1% Triton X-100 for 2 h at 4°C. The lysate was centrifuged (16,000 × g, 15 min), and the supernatant was precleared with a combination of protein A- and protein G-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) precoated with normal mouse IgG for 2 h at 4 °C. After preclearing, the lysate was incubated with a specific antibody coupled to the protein A/G-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes collected on the beads were then washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected by immunoblotting analysis using specific antibodies. Invasion Assay into Matrigel—24-well Transwell chamber inserts (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) with 8-μm porosity polycarbonate filters were precoated with 80 μg of basement membrane Matrigel (BD Biosciences) onto the upper surface and with 20 μg of gelatin onto the lower surface. Culture supernatant of NIH3T3 fibroblasts in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was placed in the lower well. MelJuSo cells suspended in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum were added to the upper chambers (2 × 104 cells/well) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Noninvading cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed by wiping out with a cotton swab, and the filter was excised and mounted on a microscope slide. Invasiveness was quantified by counting cells on the lower surface of the filter. Wound-healing Migration Assay—For the measurement of cell migration during wound healing, cells (5 × 105) were seeded in individual wells of a 24-well culture plate. When the cells reached a confluent state, cell layers were wounded with a plastic micropipette tip having a large orifice. The medium and debris were aspirated away and replaced by 2 ml of fresh serum-free medium. Cells were photographed every 12 h after wounding by phase-contrast microscopy. For evaluation of “wound closure,” five randomly selected points along each wound were marked, and the horizontal distance of migrating cells from the initial wound was measured. Gelatin Zymography—Type IV collagenase activities present in conditioned medium were visualized by electrophoresis on gelatin-containing polyacrylamide gel as previously described (28Jang H.I. Lee H. Exp. Mol. Med. 2003; 35: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, conditioned medium from cells cultured in serum-free medium was mixed 3:1 with substrate gel sample buffer (40% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and loaded without boiling onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing type 1 gelatin (1.5 mg/ml). After electrophoresis at 4 °C, the gel was soaked in 2.5% Triton X-100 with gentle shaking for 30 min with one change of detergent solution. The gel was rinsed and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in substrate buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3). Following incubation, the gel was stained with 0.05% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 and destained in 10% acetic acid and 20% methanol. Cell Aggregation Assay—L cells transfected with CD151 or vector alone were washed with PBS containing 2 mm EDTA and rendered into single cell suspension by seven gentle passes through a 22-gauge needle after scraping. After washing with Puck's saline (5 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, 8 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4), suspensions of single cells (1 × 105 cells/ml) were seeded into individual wells of a 24-well culture plate and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C with agitation at 70–80 rpm using an orbital shaker. Photographs were taken every 15 min after incubation under a phase-contrast microscope on three predetermined fields, and both the total cell number (A) and the number of cells remaining as single cells (B) were counted. The results were expressed as the percentage of cells that formed aggregates as follows: (A – B)/A × 100 (%). In some experiments, the transfectants were preincubated with antibody (20 μg/ml) and then washed free of unbound antibody before incubation. In experiments to determine whether aggregation was homophilic, distinct populations of cells were prelabeled with 5- and 6-CFSE (carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) before suspension. For these experiments, phase and fluorescent images of the same field were photographed after a 30-min incubation with orbital shaking. Promoter Assay—A 1305-bp DNA fragment (–1285 to +20), corresponding to the promoter of the human MMP-9 gene (29Sato H. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar, 30Eberhardt W.

Commun. 2003; 305: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For mt-AP-1 of the MMP-9 gene promoter, in which distal and proximal AP-1 binding sites (–533 to –527 and –79 to –73, respectively) were destroyed, 5′-TGAGTCA-3′ was changed to 5′-TGAGTtg-3′ (underlined lowercase letters indicate the mutated bases) by the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For mt-NF-κB of the MMP-9 promoter, in which a NF-κB binding site (–600 to –590) was destroyed, 5′-GGAATTCCCC-3′ was mutated to 5′-GatcgatCCC-3′. After subcloning the mutant MMP-9 promoters into a promoterless luciferase expression vector, pGL3 (Promega), the corresponding mutations in the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The pGL3 vector containing wild-type or mutant MMP-9 promoter was transfected into MelJuSo cells by using Lipofectamine. Luciferase activity in cell lysate was measured using the Promega luciferase assay system according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To normalize luciferase activity, each of the pGL3 vectors was co-transfected with a pRLSV40ΔEnh, which expresses Renilla luciferase by an enhancerless SV40 promoter (31Hah N. Lee S.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Cells were incubated with serum-free medium for 4 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (32Na H.J. Lee S.J. Kang Y.C. Cho Y.L. Nam W.D. Kim P.K. Ha K.S. Chung H.T. Lee H. Kwon Y.G. Koh J.S. Kim Y.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1276-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the putative AP-1 binding site (–86 to –66; 5′-TGACCCCTGAGTCAGCACTTG-3′; the AP-1 recognition sequence is underlined) and the putative NF-κB site (–607 to –582; 5′-GCCCCGTGGAATTCCCCCAAATCCTG-3′; the NF-κB recognition sequence is underlined) in the proximal MMP-9 promoter sequences were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified by a G-50 Sephadex column. The 32P-labeled probes (∼40,000 cpm) were then incubated with nuclear extracts (10 μg of protein) for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were resolved on native 5% polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Specificity for binding of AP-1 factors and NF-κB to the corresponding sequences of the MMP-9 promoter was confirmed by using cold competitors having typical AP-1 and NF-κB binding sequences (Promega), respectively. Detergent-free Purification of Membrane Fractions—Mock and CD151 transfectant cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then scraped into buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm benzimidine). The cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes). A postnuclear supernatant was obtained by centrifugation (2500 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), adjusted to 10% sucrose and loaded onto a 30% sucrose cushion in an ultracentrifuge tube. After centrifugation for 60 min at 150,000 × g in a T-1270 rotor of a tabletop ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments), a light-scattering band confined to the 10–30% sucrose interface was collected and stored at –70 °C until use. In Vitro Kinase Assays—Cellular proteins (200 μg) were incubated with anti-FAK, anti-Src, or anti-paxillin Abs and immunoprecipitated using protein A/G-agarose beads. Immune complexes collected on the beads were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer and once with kinase buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and added to an in vitro kinase reaction mixture containing 5 μg of acid-denatured enolase and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (33Gabarra-Niecko V. Keely P.J. Schaller M.D. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and then stopped by boiling with SDS-sample buffer. After electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, the radioactive proteins were visualized by autoradiography. CD151 Increases Motility, MMP-9 Expression, and Invasiveness of Human Melanoma Cells—First, we examined CD151 expression levels in two human metastatic melanoma cell lines, C8161 and MelJuSo, among which C8161 was illustrated to have a higher metastatic ability than MelJuSo (24Welch D.R.

A 760-bp PCR product and a 29-kDa protein band were detected in C8161, but not in MelJuSo cells, by reverse transcription-PCR analysis using CD151 cDNA-specific primers and immunoblotting analysis using anti-CD151 mAb, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating that CD151 is differentially expressed in a cell line-specific manner among human melanoma cells. The tetraspanins CD9 and CD63, which were previously reported to suppress melanoma metastasis (28Jang H.I. Lee H. Exp. Mol.

This effect is rapamycin-sensitive and mediated by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), a signaling complex containing mTOR, raptor, and mLST8. Here we demonstrate that insulin produces a stable increase in the kinase activity of mTORC1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The response was associated with a marked increase in 4EBP1 binding to raptor in mTORC1, and it was abolished by disrupting the TOR signaling motif in 4EBP1. The stimulatory effects of insulin on both 4EBP1 kinase activity and binding occurred rapidly and at physiological concentrations of insulin, and both effects required an intact mTORC1. Results of experiments involving size exclusion chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged subunits provide evidence that the major insulin-responsive form is dimeric mTORC1, a structure containing two heterotrimers of mTOR, raptor, and mLST8.

However, such changes in mTOR activity have not been detected in other studies, and the conclusion that insulin produces a stable increase in the kinase activity of mTOR is controversial. Previous studies of insulin action on mTOR activity in vitro have not discriminated between the two mTOR signaling complexes, and in some cases the conditions used to extract mTOR would have disrupted mTORC1. Because mTORC1 mediates the effects of insulin on the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 in cells, we conducted experiments to measure mTORC1 activity and the interaction of mTORC1 with 4EBP1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAdipocyte Culture and Extract Preparation—3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum. Fibroblasts were converted to adipocytes by using differentiation medium as described previously (17Lin T.-A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 10–12 days after adding the differentiation medium. For experiments, the culture medium was replaced with a solution containing 145 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 1.4 mm MgSO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm sodium phosphate, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The cells were incubated at 37 °C without or with a maximally effective concentration of insulin (0.6 μm) and/or other additions. To terminate the incubation the adipocytes were rinsed once with chilled phosphate-buffered saline (145 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) and then homogenized (0.8 ml of buffer/10-cm-diameter dish) in a glass tissue grinder with a Teflon pestle driven at 1,000 rpm. Homogenization Buffer was composed of Buffer A supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 μm microcystin. Buffer A contained 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20 (unless otherwise indicated), 10 mm sodium phosphate, and 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4. Homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were retained for analyses.Antibodies—Antibodies to the COOH-terminal region of 4EBP1 (26Hu C. Pang S. Kong X. Velleca M.

The mTOR antibodies, mTAb1 and mTAb2, were described previously (27Brunn G.J. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32547-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Antibodies (designated N-Rap Ab) to the region in raptor (amino acids 36–53) originally targeted by Kim et al. (7Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19667-19673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). mTAb2 and N-Rap Ab were used to detect mTOR and raptor, respectively, by immunoblotting. mLST8 antibodies were described previously (28McMahon L.P. Yue W. Santen R.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as were phosphospecific antibodies to the Ser-2448 site in mTOR (29Reynolds T.H. Bodine S.C. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17657-17662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).In pilot experiments we attempted to immunoprecipitate mTORC1 by using N-Rap Ab. Although raptor was readily detected in immunoprecipitates obtained with this antibody, neither mTOR nor mLST8 were found (results not presented). Thus, N-Rap Ab either promoted dissociation of mTOR and raptor or was unable to bind raptor associated with mTOR. To generate raptor antibodies that could be used to immunoprecipitate mTORC1, a peptide having an NH2-terminal Cys followed by 12 amino acids (YISVYSVEKRVR) corresponding to the COOH-terminal region of raptor was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and the conjugate was used to immunize rabbits. The resulting raptor antibodies (C-Rap Ab) were purified using a column containing an affinity resin prepared by coupling the peptide to Sulfolink beads (Pierce). Rictor antibodies were generated in a similar manner except that a peptide (CRHSPDTAEGQLKEDRE) based on amino acids 263–278 in mouse rictor was used.Monoclonal antibody 12CA5, which recognizes the HA epitope tag, was purified from hybridoma culture medium. Phosphospecific antibodies to the Ser-473 site in Akt2, the Thr-389 site in S6K1, and the activating sites in the ERK1 and ERK2 isoforms of mitogen-activated protein kinase were from Cell Signaling Technology Inc.Purification of Recombinant Proteins—His-tagged forms of wild type 4EBP1 and a 4EBP1 protein having Ala at position 113 (F113A) were expressed in bacteria and purified as described previously (22Choi K.M. McMahon L.P. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19667-19673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To assess purity and to confirm protein concentrations, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then stained with Coomassie Blue (22Choi K.M. McMahon L.P. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19667-19673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Complexes of eIF4E bound to His-tagged forms of either 4EBP1 or 4EBP2 were purified as described previously (30Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30199-30204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-FKBP12 was prepared as described previously (31Sabers C.J. Martin M.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 815-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation of mTORC1—Two strategies were used to recover mTORC1. In the first, the raptor subunit of the endogenous complex was targeted by using C-Rap Ab. In the other, an HA antibody was used to capture mTORC1 containing an epitope-tagged raptor that had been overexpressed in the adipocytes. Several antibodies to mTOR, raptor, and mLST8 proved unsuitable either because they activated mTOR or because they failed to immunoprecipitate mTORC1 (results not shown). Adipocyte extract samples (800 μl) were incubated with C-Rap Ab (2 μg) bound to protein A-agarose beads (15 μl) or with 12CA5 (2 μg) bound to protein G-agarose beads (15 μl) at 4 °C for 12 h with constant mixing. As a control for specificity, rabbit or mouse nonimmune IgG was substituted for the C-Rap Ab or 12CA5, respectively. The beads were then washed once with 1 ml of Buffer A, once with 1 ml of Buffer A plus 0.5 mm NaCl, and then twice with 1 ml of Buffer A.Expression of HA-raptor in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes by Adenoviral Mediated Gene Transfer—Virus for expressing HA-raptor was prepared using the system developed by He et al. (32He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3229) Google Scholar). Briefly cDNA encoding HA-tagged raptor was excised with KpnI and NotI from the pBluescript construct described previously (22Choi K.M. McMahon L.P. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19667-19673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and inserted between the KpnI and NotI sites in the shuttle vector, pAdTrack. The resulting plasmid was cotransformed with the adenoviral backbone plasmid, pAdEasy-1, into BJ5183 bacteria. Recombined plasmid was selected and transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells to generate virus, which was amplified and then purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation to create a high titer viral stock. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected essentially as described by Kasuga and co-workers (33Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The efficiency of infection judged by expression of green fluorescent protein, which is also encoded by the HA-raptor virus, was ∼50%. Virus encoding β-galactosidase was used as a control.Expression Constructs for mTOR, Raptor, and mLST8—Most of the expression constructs used have been described previously (14McMahon L.P. Choi K.M. Lin T.A. Abraham R.T. Lawrence J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7428-7438Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Choi K.M. McMahon L.P. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To generate a construct for expressing Myc-raptor, cDNA encoding raptor was excised from an HA-raptor-pcDNA3 vector (22Choi K.M. McMahon L.P. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19667-19673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) by using EcoRI and inserted into the EcoRI site in pCMVTag3B (Stratagene). The construct for expressing untagged mLST8 was prepared by excising mLST8 cDNA from the HA-mLST8 vector (28McMahon L.P. Yue W. Santen R.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and then inserting the mLST8 fragment into pcDNA3. To generate vector for expressing FLAG-mTOR, a fragment corresponding to bp 1–632 of the mTOR coding region was amplified by PCR with AU1-mTOR pcDNA3 template and the following primers: 5′-GGCGGATCCCACCATGCTTGGGACAGGCCCTG-3′ and 5′-GGCAGTCGACTCTAGAGCCACAGCTCCTTCACGGATG-3′. The fragment was digested with BamHI and SalI, and the product was inserted between the BamHI and SalI sites in pCMVTag2A (Stratagene) to generate NT-pCMVTag2A. To complete construction of the FLAG-mTOR expression construct (mTOR-pCMVTag2A), EcoRI and XbaI were used to excise a fragment from AU1-mTOR pcDNA3 that was inserted between the EcoRI (which cuts in the mTOR coding region in NT-pCMVTag2A) and XbaI sites in the NT-pCMVTag2A construct. The region of the FLAG-mTOR cDNA generated by PCR was sequenced and found to be free of errors.Immune Complex Assay of mTORC1 Activity—Immune complex beads were rinsed with 1 ml of Buffer B (50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μm microcystin LR, 10 mm HEPES, and 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4) and suspended in 60 μl of Buffer B. After removing a sample for immunoblotting mTOR and raptor, the kinase reactions were initiated by adding to 20 μl of the suspension 5 μl of Buffer A supplemented with 0.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 1,000 mCi/mmol), 50 mm MnCl2, and 1 μg of the His-tagged form of either wild type 4EBP1 or F113A. Unless otherwise stated, reactions were terminated after 30 min at 30 °C by adding SDS sample buffer. The relative amounts of 32P incorporated into the 4EBP1 proteins were determined by phosphorimaging following SDS-PAGE. Measurements under these conditions reflect the initial rate of phosphorylation as less than 5% of the available substrates were phosphorylated, and the reactions proceed linearly for 60 min (see later, Fig. 2b).4EBP1 Binding to C-Rap Ab Immune Complexes—Immune complexes from 400 μl of extract (7.5 μl of beads) were suspended in Buffer A (500 μl) containing 50 ng of the His-tagged form of either 4EBP1 or F113A. After incubating at 21 °C for 1 h with constant mixing, the beads were washed four times with 1 ml of Buffer A, twice with Buffer A plus 0.5 m NaCl, and then once with a solution containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The relative amounts of the 4EBP1 proteins retained by the beads were determined by immunoblotting.Binding of Raptor to 4EBP1 Affinity Resins—His-tagged 4EBP1 or F113A proteins (1 mg) were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (86 mg) in 0.5 m NaCl and 0.1 m NaHCO3 (pH 8.3). After 12 h at 4 °C, the resins were washed exhaustively as directed by the supplier (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were then suspended in 0.5 ml of buffer (0.5 m NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and stored at 4 °C prior to use. For binding, an aliquot (15 μl) of the beads was added to 800 μl of extract. After incubating at 4 °C for 12 h with constant mixing, the beads were washed as described above for 4EBP1 binding to C-Rap Ab immune complexes. The relative amounts of raptor and mTOR retained by the beads were determined by immunoblotting.Electrophoretic Analyses—SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were conducted as described previously (12Mothe-Satney I. Brunn G.J. McMahon L.P. Capaldo C.T. Abraham R.T. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33836-33843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Binding of primary antibodies was monitored by using the appropriate alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies, which were detected by using CDP-Star reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Relative signal intensities of bands in immunoblots were determined by scanning laser densitometry of x-ray films or by using a Fujifilm LAS 3000 LCD camera system.Gel Filtration—Adipocytes were incubated without or with insulin, rinsed three times with Buffer A (minus detergents and dithiothreitol) that had been chilled on ice, and scraped from the dishes (six 10-cm-diameter dishes per treatment). To enhance resolution by the column, the volume of extract was minimized by homogenizing cells in 500 μl of Homogenization Buffer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were retained and passed through a 0.45-μm filter. Extract samples (350 μl) were applied to a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated in Buffer A. The flow rate was maintained at 0.2 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected.Other Materials—Recombinant human insulin (Novolin R) was from Novo Nordisk. Rapamycin, LY294002, and U0126 were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Epidermal growth factor was from Upstate Biologicals. Fibroblast growth factor-1 was provided by Dr. David Ornitz (Washington University). Farnesylthiosalicylic acid was provided by Dr. Wayne Bardin (Thyreos, New York, NY). Tween 20 was from Fischer. CHAPS was from Roche Applied Science. Caffeine, insulin-like growth factor 1, Nonidet P-40, Triton X-100, and wortmannin were from Sigma.RESULTSStable Activation of mTORC1—mTORC1 was immunoprecipitated from extracts of 3T3-L1 adipocytes by using an antibody (C-Rap Ab) to the COOH-terminal region of raptor (Fig. 1A). Raptor, mTOR, and mLST8 were detected in the immune complexes, confirming that intact mTORC1 was recovered (Fig. 1B). To measure mTORC1 activity, immune complexes were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and 4EBP1. Treating adipocytes with insulin increased 4EBP1 phosphorylation by mTORC1 (Fig. 1B). No activity was detected in complexes isolated with nonimmune IgG. The 3-fold increase in mTORC1 activity produced by insulin (Fig. 1B) is comparable to the increase in phosphorylation of endogenous 4EBP1 when 32P-labeled 3T3-L1 adipocytes are incubated with the hormone (17Lin T.-A.

We have previously demonstrated that demineralized bone (DB) from ovariectomized (OVX) rats cannot induce bone formation when implanted ectopically at the subcutaneous site. Here we showed in vitro that 17β-estradiol (E2) specifically induced expression of Bmp6 mRNA in MC3T3-E1 preosteoblastic cells and that bone extracts from OVX rats lack BMPs. Next we demonstrated that 125I-BMP-6 administered systemically accumulated in the skeleton and also restored the osteoinductive capacity of ectopically implanted DB from OVX rats. BMP-6 applied systemically to aged OVX rats significantly increased bone volume and mechanical characteristics of both the trabecular and cortical bone, the osteoblast surface, serum osteocalcin and osteoprotegerin levels, and decreased the osteoclast surface, serum C-telopeptide, and interleukin-6. E2 was significantly less effective, and was not synergistic with BMP-6. Animals that discontinued BMP-6 therapy maintained bone mineral density gains for another 12 weeks. BMP-6 increased in vivo the bone expression of Acvr-1, Bmpr1b, Smad5, alkaline phosphatase, and collagen type I and decreased expression of Bmp3 and BMP antagonists, chordin and cerberus. These results show, for the first time, that systemically administered BMP-6 restores the bone inductive capacity, microarchitecture, and quality of the skeleton in osteoporotic rats.

Bone loss during aging and after menopause in women is known to result from an imbalance between bone formation and resorption leading to altered bone microarchitecture and excess bone fragility. Inferior bone strength and increased bone fracture rate of bone in patients with osteoporosis might be associated with decreased osteoinductive and thus self-regenerative bone capacity eventually due to the lower content of growth and differentiation factors including bone morphogenetic proteins in the bone extracellular matrix (1Cesnjaj M.

Nathanson M.A. Reddi A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3419-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). On the contrary, DBM from OVX animals implanted into both normal and OVX rats induces only fibrous tissues suggesting that its decreased bone inducing activity is due to abnormal composition of bone from OVX rats and not to the 17β-estradiol (E2)-deficient microenvironment (1Cesnjaj M. Stavljenic A. Vukicevic S. Acta Orthop. Scand. 1991; 62: 471-475PubMed Google Scholar). Lack of specific signals needed for ectopic bone induction may, at least in part, explain diminished bone potency to heal fractures in osteoporotic patients (6Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. 2003; 32: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Srivastava A.K. Vliet E.L. Lewiecki E.M. Maricic M. Abdelmalek A. Gluck O. Baylink D.J. Curr. Med. Res. Opin. 2005; 21: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that fetal osteoblastic cell lines treated by E2 specifically express Bmp6 mRNA, whereas gene transcripts of other members of the BMP family are unaffected (8Rickard D.J. Hofbauer L.C. Bonde S.K. Gori F. Spelsberg T.C. Riggs B.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A functional relationship between E2 and BMP-6 was further suggested by E2 binding to the Bmp6 gene promotor (9Ong D.B. Colley S.M. Norman M.R. Kitazawa S. Tobias J.H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and by increased BMP-6 immunostaining in bone marrow of mice treated with E2 (10Plant A. Tobias J.H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although numerous studies have unequivocally demonstrated that BMPs induce new bone formation locally in animals and humans, both ectopically and when implanted between bone ends in patients with delayed non-unions or acute fractures (11Friedlaender G.E. Vukicevic S. Sampath K. Bone morphogenetic proteins, Regeneration of Bone and Beyond. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel2004: 157-163Crossref Google Scholar, 12Friedlaender G.E. Perry C.R. Cole J.D. Cook S.D. Cierny G. Muschler G.F. Zych G.A. Calhoun J.H. LaForte A.J. Yin S. J. Bone Joint Surg. 2001; 83: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), so far it has not been shown that a systemically administered recombinant BMP can effect the bone volume in OVX rats. In these studies we tested the effect of systemically administered recombinant BMP-6 on bone formation in aged OVX rats and showed for the first time that BMP-6 is a novel systemic bone anabolic agent and has a potential for treating bone loss in patients with osteoporosis. Demineralized Bone Matrix—Bone matrix was prepared from 6-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats, 3 months following OVX. After sacrifice, diaphyses of femurs and tibiae were removed and then powdered, sieved, and demineralized as previously described (5Sampath T.K. Nathanson M.A. Reddi A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3419-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). DBM from OVX rats was implanted subcutaneously in the pectoral region of normal and OVX rats, which were subsequently injected with 20, 50, and 100 μg/kg/day of BMP-6 intravenously (iv) from days 2 to 6 following implantation. Two weeks following implantation of DBM, pellets were removed and embedded in paraffin, cut, stained with toluidine blue, and examined for the presence of new cartilage and bone. MC3T3-E1 Preosteoblastic Cell Line and Cell Culture Experiments—Stock cultures of non-confluent mouse calvarial preosteoblasts (MC3T3-E1) were grown in α minimal essential medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. All culture reagents were from Invitrogen. MC3T3-E1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were plated at 3 × 104 cells/cm2 in 24-multiwell culture dishes (Costar) and cultured until reaching ∼90% confluence. The growth medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (without phenol red; Invitrogen) supplemented with ITS + culture supplement (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) and l-ascorbic acid 2-sulfate (50 μg/ml; Sigma). Cells were stimulated with E2 (Sigma) at 10-7-10-11 m for 12 and 72 h. At the designated time points total cellular RNA was extracted and analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR. Animals—Four-, 6-, or 7-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to OVX. Animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of thiopenthal at doses of 4 mg/kg body weight. Thirty animals per experiment were subjected to sham surgery during which the ovaries were exteriorized but replaced intact. Bilateral ovariectomies were performed in the remaining rats from the dorsal approach and they were left untreated for a period of 6 to 18 months following surgery to await the development of osteopenia. BMP-6 at doses of 1, 10, 25, and 50 μg/kg was injected through the rat tail vein one or three times a week for 8-12 or 30 weeks (extended protocol). In total 390 sham and OVX rats were used in three protocols as follows: A: 1, sham (n = 30); 2, OVX (n = 20); 3, OVX + BMP-6 (10 μg/kg intravenously, 3 times/week) (n = 20); 4, OVX + BMP-6 (25 μg/kg intravenously, 3 times/week) (n = 20); 5, OVX + BMP-6 (50 μg/kg intravenously, 3 times/week) (n = 20); 6, OVX + E2 (50 μg/kg intraperitoneally, 3 times/week) (n = 20); and 7, OVX + E2 (50 μg/kg intravenously, 3 times/week) + BMP-6 (50 μg/kg intravenously, 3 times/week) (n = 20). Therapy started 12 months following OVX and continued for 12 weeks (Fig. 2). Protocol B was: 1, sham (n = 30); 2, OVX (n = 20); 3, OVX + BMP-6 (10 μg/kg intravenously, 3 times/week) (n = 50) for 3 months, and then group 3 OVX + BMP-6 was divided into: 4, OVX + BMP-6 (10 μg/kg intravenously, 3 times/week) (n = 20); 5, OVX + E2 (50 μg/kg intraperitoneally, 3 times/week) (n = 20); and 6, OVX + no therapy (n = 10) for 4.5 months. Therapy started 6 months following OVX and continued for 7.5 months including the first (3 months) and second therapies (3.5 months) (Fig. 4). Protocol C was: 1, sham (n = 30); 2, OVX (n = 20); 3, OVX + BMP-6 (1 μg/kg intravenously, 3 times/week) (n = 20); 4, OVX + BMP-6 (10 μg/kg intravenously, 3 times/week) (n = 20); and 5, OVX + BMP-6 (10 μg/kg intravenously, once/week) (n = 20). Therapy started 18 months following OVX and continued for 6 weeks (Fig. 5). All experiments and protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee and the Ministry of Science and Technology (project 108295). Recombinant BMP-6—Human mature BMP-6 was produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells as previously described (13Ozkaynak E. Rueger D.C. Drier E.A. Corbett C. Ridge R.J. Sampath T.K. Oppermann H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2085-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 14Jones W.K. Richmond E.A. White K. Sasak H. Kusmik W. Smart J. Oppermann H. Rueger D.C. Tucker R.F. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Proteins were purified by using a Filtron Minisette (PallGelman) cross-flow device. pH was adjusted to 5.5 and the material was dialyzed against 0.1 m Tris, 75 mm acetic acid, 0.2 m KH2PO4, 5 mm EDTA, 6 m urea and then filtered. Subsequently, about 150 mg of protein was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap™ Heparin-Sepharose HP (Amersham Biosciences) column that had been preequilibrated with 0.1 m Tris, 125 mm acetic acid, 5 mm EDTA, and 6 m urea containing 0.3 m NaCl. Loading was performed at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The column was loaded with maximal 30 mg of dialyzed protein. Dimeric BMP-6 species was eluted at a NaCl concentration of 0.7 m. Homogenous fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 10 mm NH4 acetate, pH 4.0, lyophilized, and stored until used. Biodistribution and Pharmacokinetics of 125I-Labeled BMP-6 (125I-BMP-6)—Highly purified BMP-6 (15.7 mg) was radioiodinated with 5 mCi of carrier-free Na125I using a modification of the lactoperoxidase method as described earlier (15Bosukonda D. Shih M.S. Sampath T.K. Vukicevic S. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 1902-1911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Vukicevic S. Basic V. Rogic D. Basic N. Shih M.S. Shepard A. Jin D.

Investig. 1998; 102: 202-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Shortly, gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column was used to separate radioiodinated BMP-6 (125I-BMP-6) from the free iodide. The column was eluted with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 0.2 Tween 80 and 0.1% ovalbumin. The specific activity of the 125I-BMP-6 preparation used in this study was 0.273 mCi/mg. Rats (n = 50) received a single injection of 125I-BMP-6 at a dose level of 10 μg/kg with the activity of 20 μCi. Injection volume was 500 μl. Animals were sacrificed 30 min, 1, 3, 6, and 24 h following injection. Tissues were removed, weighed, and radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. The relative uptake of 125I-BMP-6 by tissues during the above time was expressed as nanograms of 125I-BMP-6 per gram of wet tissue weight. Western Blot Analysis of Bone Extracts from Sham and OVX Rats—Femur and tibia from sham and OVX rats were excised, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and crushed into a fine powder with a biopulverizer (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). Two hundred grams of bone powder were extracted at 4 °C with 4 m guanidine HCl and a mixture of protease inhibitors (5 mm benzamide, 0.1 m 6-aminohexanoic acid, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide). The protein extract was then ethanol-precipitated and lyophilized (17Sampath T.K. Coughlin J.E. Whetstone R.M. Banach D. Corbett C. Ridge R.J. Ozkaynak E. Oppermann H. Rueger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13198-13205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pellet was dissolved in 6 m urea, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl and purified by a heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Bound proteins were eluted with 0.5, 1, and 2 m NaCl in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The protein eluted by 0.5 m NaCl was collected and dialyzed extensively against distilled water and 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 4 °C. SDS-PAGE was run on a 10% gel according to the method of Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Samples were heated in boiling water for 3 min with or without dithiothreitol (100 mm) prior to electrophoresis. Following electrophoresis, the gel was blotted onto the nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with a goat polyclonal BMP-6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), goat polyclonal BMP-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rabbit polyclonal BMP-7 primary antibodies (19Vukicevic S. Latin V. Chen P. Batorsky R. Reddi A.H. Sampath T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-goat were used as a secondary antibody. The membranes were developed with the chromogenic substrate (Invitrogen). In Vivo and ex Vivo Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Measurement by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry—At 6-week intervals the animals were scanned for bone density measurements by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (Hologic QDR-4000, Hologic, Waltham, MA) (20Karahan S. Kincaid S.A. Lauten S.D. Wright J.C. Comp. Med. 2002; 52: 143-151PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the experiment, animals were anesthetized, weighed, and killed by cervical dislocation. The hind limbs and lumbar vertebrae were removed and fixed in 70% ethanol. The right femur and tibia, and the lumbar vertebrae (L1-5) were used for determination of bone mineral content and BMD by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (21Ke H.Z. Simmons H.A. Pirie C.M. Crawford D.T. Thompson D.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 136: 2435-2441Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar) equipped with Regional High Resolution Scan software. The scan field size was 5.08 × 1.902 cm, resolution was 0.0254 × 0.0127 cm, and speed was 7.25 mm/s. The scan images were analyzed and the bone area, bone mineral content, and bone density of whole bones, proximal, and distal metaphyses and the shaft of femurs and tibiae were determined. Peripheral Quantitative Computerized Tomography—Isolated femurs were scanned by a peripheral quantitative computerized tomography x-ray machine (Stratec XCT Research M; Norland Medical Systems, Fort Atkinson, WI) with software version 5.40. Volumetric content, density, and area of the total bone, trabecular, and cortical regions were determined as previously described (22Jamsa T. Jalovaara P. Peng Z. Vaananen H.K. Tuukkanen J. Bone. 1998; 23: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 23Windahl S.H. Vidal O. Andersson G. Gustafsson J.A. Ohlsson C. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Micro-CT—The microcomputerized tomography apparatus (μCT 40) and the analyzing software used in these experiments were obtained from SCANCO Medical AG (Bassersdorf, Switzerland) (24Ruegsegger P. Koller B. Mullar R. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1996; 58: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). The distal femur was scanned in 250 slices, each 13-μm thick in the dorsoventral direction (25Ito M. Nakamura T. Matsumoto T. Tsurusaki K. Hayashi K. Bone. 1998; 23: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional reconstruction of bone was performed using the triangulation algorithm. The trabecular bone volume (BV, mm3), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, μm), and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, μm), were directly measured on three-dimensional images using the method described by Hildebrand et al. (26Hildebrand T. Laib A. Muller R. Dequeker J. Ruegsegger P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). The trabecular bone pattern factor and the structure model index were computed using software provided with the micro-CT machine (27Hahn M. Vogel M. Pompesious-Kempa M. Delling G. Bone. 1992; 13: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 28Hildebrand T. Ruegsegger P. Comp. Meth. Biochem. Biomed. Eng. 1997; 1: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Histology and Histomorphometry—Animals were given a subcutaneous injection of the fluorochrome calcein at 10 mg/kg (Sigma) at 4 and 14 days before death. The femurs were removed at death, prepared for histomorphometric analysis, and quantified using a computer-aided image analysis system (Bioquant II, R and M Biometrics, Nashville, TN) as previously described (29Parfitt A.M. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meunier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar, 30Krempien B. Vukicevic S.

Res. 1987; 2: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were performed using StatView 4.0 packages (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Organs were taken for histologic analyzes, embedded in paraffin, cut in 10-μm thick sections, and stained with hemalauneosin and toluidine blue to reveal potential therapeutic adverse effects. Biomechanical Testing—Using a materials testing system (Model 810, MTS Systems Corp., Minneapolis, MN), two types of mechanical testing were performed on the femur. Three-point bending test of the femoral shaft was used to determine the mechanical properties of the midshaft femur. The midshaft of the femur was subjected to three-point bending to failure at a displacement rate of 0.1 mm/s, as described by Turner and Burr (32Turner C.H. Burr D.B. Bone. 1993; 14: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar), using a 2.5 kN load cell (MTS Model 661, 14A-03). The maximal load and stiffness were calculated from the load-displacement curve. Indentation test of the distal femoral metaphysis was used to determine the mechanical properties of cancellous bone in the marrow cavity of the distal femoral metaphysis, as described previously (33Meng X.W. Liang X.G. Birchman R. Wu D.D. Dempster D.W. Lindsay R. Shen V. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 34Shen V. Birchman R. Xu R. Otter M. Wu D. Lindsay R. Dempster D.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Biochemical Serum and Urine Parameters—Serum bone formation and resorption markers were measured by commercially available kits. Serum concentration of osteocalcin was measured by ELISA using rat osteocalcin EIA kits (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA). Serum concentration of C-telopeptide was measured by ELISA using RatLaps ELISA kits (Nordic Bioscience Diagnostics, Herlev, Denmark). The osteoprotegerin (OPG) level in serum was measured by ELISA using the Biomedica rat OPG ELISA kit (Biomedica, Wien, Austria). Serum concentration of IL-6 was measured by ELISA using an IL-6 Quantikine ELISA kit (R&D, Minneapolis, MN) following procedures provided by the manufacturer. The minimum detectable concentration of osteocalcin, C-telopeptide, OPG, and IL-6 were 1 ng/ml, 2 ng/ml, 0.73 pmol/liter, and 10 pg/ml, respectively. RNA Isolation and PCR Analysis—RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA with Superscript II RNase H Reverse Transcriptase as indicated by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Samples were amplified with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sequences of primers are shown in Table 1. Reactions were performed in a GeneAmp 4800 thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 32-40 cycles. Results were visualized by gel electrophoresis in 1% agarose (Sea Kem GTG, Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) in TAE buffer (Tris-HCl, acetic acid, EDTA, pH 8.0) and stained with ethidium bromide (Sigma).TABLE 1Sequences of primers used for gene expression analysis All primers are for rat genes, whereas mouse primers were used for analyses of the MC3T3-E1 mouse cell line in in vitro experiments.Target geneSemi-quantitative PCRReal time-PCRIL-6Forward: CAAGAGACTTCCAGCCAGTTGCReverse: TTGCCGAGTAGACCTCATAGTGACBmp2Forward: GCAGAGCTCCAGATTTTTCGForward: TTAAGACGCTTCCGCTGTTTForward: TGAACACAGCTGGTCTCAGGMouseForward: GTTCCCTACAGGGAGAACACCReverse: TTAAGACGCTTCCGCTGTTTReverse: GCCTGCGGTACAGATCTAGCBmp3Forward: CACTCAGCTCTTACGGAAGGCCForward: TGCTGTGGCTCTATGACAGGReverse: CTGTTTCTTTTTGCTCCGGCTCReverse: TGGTGTTCACCAATTCTCCABmp4Forward: TTCCTGGTAACCGAATGCTReverse: GGGGCTTCATAACCTCATAAForward: TCTGGTCTCCGTCCCTAATGMouseForward: TTCCTGGTAACCGAATGCTReverse: AAACTTGCTGGAAAGGCTCAReverse: GGGGCTTCATAACCTCATAABmp6Forward: AGGATGGGGTGTCAGAGGGAGAReverse: GTTGTGCTGCGGTGTCACCAForward: TTCTTCAAGGTGAGCGAGGTMouseForward: CAGGAGCATCAGCACAGAGAReverse: TAGTTGGCAGCGTAGCCTTTReverse: ATGTGTGCGTTGAGTGGGAAcvr1Forward: CCACCAACGTCGGAGATAGCAForward: ACCACCAACGTCGGAGATReverse: TGCAGCACTGTCCGTTCTTCTTReverse: CCCCTCCACACTTCTCCATABmpr1bForward: CAGGTATAAAAGACAAGAAGCCAGForward: CTCTGGGAGATTGCAAGGAGReverse: TCTCTCATGTCCTCATAAGAAGGGReverse: TCATAAGCTTCCCCATTTGCSmad 5Forward: TGATGAGGAAGAGAAATGGGForward: GAATGCCACGTTTCCTGATTReverse: GGAGGATAGGGGCTGTTAGGReverse: AGGGGTATCAGCTGGGAGTTAlp2Forward: CGACACGGACAAGAAGCCCTForward: CCTTGAAAAATGCCCTGAAAReverse: AAGGTTGGCTCCAATGCAGGReverse: CTTGGAGAGAGCCACAAAGGOpnForward: GTGAACTCGGATGAATCTGACGForward: ATGGCTTTCATTGGAGTTGCReverse: CTTGTCCTCATGGCTGTGAAACReverse: GAGGAGAAGGCGCATTACAGColla1Forward: TATTGCTGGTGCTCCTGGCTTCForward: TGCTGCCTTTTCTGTTCCTTReverse: TCACCACGGGCTCCTCGTTTReverse: AAGGTGCTGGGTAGGGAAGTChrdForward: GAACATCAAACCTCAGTGCCCCForward: CCAGGGACAGCTACTTCGAGReverse: TGTGAACCGAACCCTGCTGGReverse: AGAGGACGCTTTGAAGGACACer1Forward: TGGCATCGCTTCATGTTCAGAForward: ACTGCTCACCCACCAAATTCReverse: GTTCCGTCTTCACCATGCACTGReverse: AGCTGGGAGTCCAGAGATGATwsg1Forward: TCCCTGATGTTCCTGATGTGCCForward: TGTGAGCAAGTGCCTCATTCReverse: CCGAGGGTTGCACATACCGAReverse: GGGAGGTGTGTCGCTGTAATNogForward: GAGCAAGAAGCTGAGGAGGAForward: CCTGGCTTTCTGGTTCATGTReverse: GTGGGGATCCATCAAGTGTCReverse: GCCGGGTAACTTTTGACGTAGapdhForward: ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCACForward: AGACAGCCGCATCTTCTTGTReverse: TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAReverse: CTTGCCGTGGGTAGAGTCAT Open table in a new tab Real Time PCR—Two μg of purified total RNA from each rat bone were reverse transcribed with 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase RNase (BD Biosciences) using random hexamer primers (final concentration 20 pmol per sample) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Gene expression of interest was measured using a commercial kit (LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) in a LightCycler instrument (Roche Diagnostics) as described (35Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123392) Google Scholar). Sequences of primers are shown in Table 1. Expression of four housekeeping genes was analyzed and geNorm software was used to identify the most suitable reference gene. Gapdh transcripts were used as a normalizer. Results are represented as -fold change of the comparative expression level. Statistical Analysis—Distributions of quantitative data were tested with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Densitometric and histologic data measurement within the same time point were analyzed with one-way ANOVA with one-sided Dunnett t post hoc test against OVX and sham animals. Serum values of IL-6 were analyzed with paired t test. Changes in gene expression were evaluated using one-way ANOVA with one-sided Dunett-t post hoc test against OVX and sham animals. Bone Matrix from OVX Rats Is Deficient in BMPs—Bone extracts from normal and OVX rats were analyzed by Western blot analysis following reduction with DTT (Fig. 1, A-C). Unlike bone extracts from normal rats, OVX animals had undetectable amounts of BMP-2, -6, and -7 (Fig. 1, A-C), suggesting that E2 deficiency results with decreased amounts of BMPs in bone. This suggests that the lack of capacity of DBM from OVX rats to form new bone at an ectopic site in both normal and OVX rats may be at least in part due to BMP-deficient DBM (1Cesnjaj M. Stavljenic A. Vukicevic S. Acta Orthop. Scand. 1991; 62: 471-475PubMed Google Scholar). Intravenously Administered BMP-6 Induces Ectopic Bone Formation by Binding to Subcutaneously Implanted Extracted DBM from OVX Rats—Systemic effects of BMP-6 were tested by intravenous injections following subcutaneous implantation of DBM from OVX rats into both normal and OVX rats. New bone formation was found 2 weeks later in an amount similar to the one induced by implanting DBM from normal rats (Fig. 1, F and G). These results suggest that, following systemic administration of BMP-6, DBM from OVX rats, lacking new bone induction capacity, regained the osteogenic potential in both normal and OVX rats. A similar result was obtained when 8 m urea extracted and thus non-osteogenic DBM from normal rats was implanted subcutaneously into male rats injected intravenously from days 2 to 5 with 100 μg/kg BMP-6 (data not shown). These results prompted us to test whether systemic administration of BMP-6 is effective in restoring bone volume in aged rats 12-18 months following OVX. Pharmacokinetics and Biodistribution of Systemically Administered 125I-BMP-6—Prior to testing the efficacy of BMP-6 on the skeleton we tested its pharmacokinetic properties and biodistribution. High serum levels of 125I-BMP-6 were achieved immediately after intravenous injection followed by a steady decline (Fig. 1D). Approximately 60 ng of BMP-6/ml was present in circulation 1 min after injecting a dose of 10 μg BMP-6/kg. Biodistribution of 125I-BMP-6 in the rat kidney increased during the first 4 h following injection, and decreased in the following 20 h, whereas the level of 125I-BMP-6 in the liver increased immediately and decreased slowly throughout the experiment. The uptake of 125I-BMP-6 in femur was 0.15% of the total applied dose (∼4.5 ng of 125I-BMP-6), reached the maximal value at 4 h, and then declined slowly to 0.05% of the applied dose at 24 h following injection (Fig. 1C). The maximal uptake of 125I-BMP-6 in the tibia was 0.12% of the applied dose (∼3.6 ng of 125I-BMP-6) at 8 h following injection and declined slowly to 0.025% of the applied dose at 24 h following injection (Fig. 1E). Autoradiographic analysis demonstrated that 125I-BMP-6 remained intact in the serum, assayed at 4 h after administration (data not shown).

In contrast to eukaryotic and some prokaryotic NSSs, which contain 12 transmembrane domains (TMs), Tyt1 contains only 11 TMs, a characteristic shared by ∼70% of prokaryotic NSS homologues. Nonetheless upon heterologous expression in an engineered Escherichia coli host, Tyt1 catalyzes robust Na+-dependent, highly selective l-tyrosine transport. Genetic engineering of Tyt1 variants devoid of cysteines or with individually retained endogenous cysteines at positions 18 or 238, at the cytoplasmic ends of TM1 and TM6, respectively, preserved normal transport activity. Whereas cysteine-less Tyt1 was resistant to the inhibitory effect of sulfhydryl-alkylating reagents, N-ethylmaleimide inhibited transport by Tyt1 variants containing either one or both of the endogenous cysteines, and this inhibition was altered by the substrates sodium and tyrosine, consistent with substrate-induced dynamics in the transport pathway. Our findings support a binding model of Tyt1 function in which an ordered sequence of substrate-induced structural changes reflects distinct conformational states of the transporter. This work identifies Tyt1 as the first functional bacterial NSS member putatively consisting of only 11 TMs and shows that Tyt1 is a suitable model for the study of NSS dynamics with relevance to structure/function relationships of human NSSs, including the dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and γ-aminobutyric acid transporters.

Na+/Cl--dependent neurotransmitter transporters fulfill an essential role in the nervous system by terminating synaptic transmission and recycling neurotransmitters for reuse (1Rudnick G. Clark J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 2Rudnick G. Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function and Regulation. 2nd. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2002Google Scholar). These proteins are secondary active transporters that utilize the Na+ electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane of the presynaptic neuron or glia to catalyze the (re)uptake of a variety of neurotransmitters from the extracellular milieu against their concentration gradient in a cotransport (symport) mechanism (3Gu H.

Hence they are referred to as neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs) 2The abbreviations used are: NSS, neurotransmitter:sodium symporter; DAT, dopamine transporter; GAT, γ-aminobutyric acid transporter; Mes, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; NET, norepinephrine transporter; SERT, serotonin transporter; TM, transmembrane domain; CL, Cys-less; WT, wild type; SGLT, sodium/glucose transporter; MelB, melibiose permease of Escherichia coli. (6Saier Jr., M.H. J. Cell Biochem. 1999; 75: 84-94Crossref Google Scholar). Substrates of NSSs include biogenic amines, such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, as well as amino acids (γ-aminobutyric acid, glycine, and proline) and osmolytes (betaine and creatine) (Ref. 7Masson J. Sagne C. Hamon M. El Mestikawy S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 439-464PubMed Google Scholar; for recent reviews, see Refs. 8Sonders M.S. Quick M. Javitch J.A. Curr. Opin.

Physiol. 2004; 447: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The transporters for the biogenic amines dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin (DAT, NET, and SERT, respectively) are of particular interest because they are targets for the action of numerous drugs, including the widely abused psychostimulants cocaine and amphetamine (10Amara S.G. Sonders M.S. Drug Alcohol Depend. 1998; 51: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), as well as for antidepressant drugs (11Iversen L. Br. J.

Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar)) have been elucidated in eukaryotic expression systems, these systems are not well suited for large scale expression and purification of these transporters (16Tate C.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 17Tate C.G. Haase J. Baker C. Boorsma M. Magnani F. Vallis Y. Williams D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1610: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To obtain information on the structure and function of membrane proteins, prokaryotic homologues can be extremely valuable because recombinant transporters can be expressed in bacteria in large quantities (18Rees D.C. Chang G. Spencer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 713-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a prerequisite for their subsequent purification and biochemical/biophysical analyses (19Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar, 20Chang G. Spencer R.H. Lee A.T. Barclay M.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1998; 282: 2220-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Recently the structure of a bacterial NSS homologue, LeuT of Aquifex aeolicus, was solved using such an approach (21Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). The availability of this structure is a major advance with wide ramifications for the field. The structure of LeuT is of a substrate-bound “closed” state blocking access of substrate to either side of the membrane. The structure provides only limited clues to the location of the transport pathway, and additional structural and functional information will be vital to determining the location of the transport pathway and the conformational changes involved in the transport cycle. Ironically LeuT was crystallized successfully in part because it is so tightly bound to substrate. Although this is a clear advantage for crystallization, it is a disadvantage for reconstitution and functional studies, which require addition and removal of substrates. Indeed the published value for transport velocity per milligram of protein with reconstituted LeuT (21Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar) is several orders of magnitude slower than that seen in other NSSs (e.g. ∼0.5 s-1 for human DAT (22Sonders M.S. Zhu S.J. Zahniser N.R. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 960-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ∼5 s-1 for rat GAT (23Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar)), suggesting the need for other bacterial NSS proteins that may be more amenable to studies of transporter dynamics. Here we report the functional characterization of a novel prokaryotic member of the NSS family, the Na+-dependent tyrosine transporter (Tyt1) of Fusobacterium nucleatum heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. This transporter is the first characterized NSS homologue predicted to have only 11 transmembrane segments and is therefore representative of more than 180 novel prokaryotic NSS members that can now be predicted also to function as sodium-dependent transporters. We also present biochemical studies which, interpreted in the structural context of a LeuT-based molecular model, serve to elucidate substrate-induced alterations in the transporter structure and identify elements of the transport pathway. Cloning of the tyt1 Gene—The gene of the proposed sodium-dependent tyrosine transporter (designated tyt1 hereafter) of F. nucleatum (GenBank™ accession number NP_602780) was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA generously provided by Dr. Susan Kinder Haake (UCLA School of Dentistry) using the following primers: tyt1_s, GTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCCATGGACAATTCGGAAAGGAAGTTTCAGTC (the NcoI restriction site is shown in italic); and tyt1_as, GCTCAGCTAATTAAGCTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTAAGCTTATCCAATACC (the HindIII restriction site is shown in italic). The resulting PCR product contained the entire tyt1 gene flanked by unique NcoI and HindIII restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Using these sites, the amplified fragment was introduced into a derivative of pT7-5 (24Quick M. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8597-8601Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the fidelity of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing (ABI 310 automated sequencer; Columbia University DNA facility). For overproduction of Tyt1 via the inducible T5 promoter, tyt1 was cut with NcoI/HindIII and subcloned into a similarly digested derivative of pQE60 (Qiagen) containing a 10-histidine coding region before the tyt1 start codon (N-terminal amino acid sequence of recombinant Tyt1: MS[H]10[D]4KAMDNS; native amino acid residues 1-4 of Tyt1 are underlined). The resulting plasmid was designated pQ2. Bacterial Strains—E. coli XL1Blue (recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 hsdR17 supE44 relA1 lac (F′proAB lacIqZΔM15 Tn10 (Tetr))) (Stratagene) served as host strain for basic cloning purposes and plasmid isolation. E. coli CY15212 (SVS1144 mtr aroP tnaB271::Tn5) (25Yanofsky C. Horn V. Gollnick P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6009-6017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as parental strain for the engineering of a suitable E. coli host, MQ614 (CY15212 tyrP1 pheP::cat) that is devoid of all known intrinsic aromatic amino acid uptake systems (see below). E. coli MQ614 harboring the indicated plasmids was used for the in vitro characterization of tyrosine transport kinetics and biochemical studies. Generation of E. coli MQ614—Chromosomal gene disruption in E. coli CY15212 (mtr- aroP- tnaB-) was performed according to the method of Datsenko and Wanner (26Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar) using the “gene disruption kit” obtained from the Yale E. coli Stock Center. For each disruption cycle cells of CY15212 (and derivatives) were transformed with pKD46 as the Red-recombinase expression plasmid by electroporation. After antibiotic screening of successful clones, the antibiotic resistance gene was eliminated by transforming the cells with the FLP helper plasmid pCP20. Chromosomal deletions of the tyrP and pheP genes were sequentially introduced using the following primers: tyrP_s, GCAGATATCACTCATAAAGATCGTCAGGACAGAAGAAAGCGTGAAAAACAGAACCCGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC; tyrP_as, CCCCACTTCTGGTAACAACCCTGCCGCAATCAAAAATTGCACGCCCATATGAATATCCTCCTTA; pheP_s, CCTCAACAAAAAAGACACACAGGGGAAAGGCGTGAAAAACGCGTCAACCGTATCGGAAGGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC; pheP_as, GCAGAGATAGTTGCCGAACGGATAGAGCAGCGCCTTAAACTGTGTTTCACGCCCCCATATGAATATCCTCCTTA (P1 and P2 sites are shown in italic), and pKD3 as template plasmid. After isolating the genomic DNA from the respective E. coli knock-out strain (DNeasy kit, Qiagen) the elimination of the target gene was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR-amplified DNA fragments that enclosed the target region. Genomic DNA of the parental strain CY15212 served as a control. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed replacement of the two intrinsic cysteine residues in Tyt1 (Cys-18 and Cys-238) was performed using a two-step PCR protocol (27Quick M. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1728-1734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with pQ2 as template. For each pair of mutagenic primers the sense primer is presented with the altered nucleotides underlined: C18A, GGTTTCATTTTAACTGCTGTTGGATCTGC; C238F, GGAATGATAGTCTTCGGAGCATACTTAG. The resulting PCR fragments were digested with NcoI/HindIII and inserted individually into similarly cut pQ2 to generate pQ2-C18A or pQ2-C238F (encoding Tyt1 with a single cysteine at amino acid position 238 or 18, respectively). After verification of the DNA integrity by sequencing of the resulting plasmids, a cysteine-free version of Tyt1 (Tyt1-CL) was engineered by combining the corresponding fragments of pQ2-C18A and pQ2-C238F using a suitable restriction enzyme combination. Substitution of Gly-24 with Asp was performed in a single step PCR using mutagenic oligo G24D, CAGTCCATGGACAATTCGGAAAGGAAGTTTCAGTCAAAAATAGGTTTCATTTTAACTTGTGTTGGATCTGCTGTTGACATGG (altered nucleotides are underlined; the NcoI restriction site is shown in italic), with pQ2 as template. The modified tyt1 gene was introduced by means of an NcoI/HindIII digest into pQ2, and its correctness was verified by sequencing. Transport Assay—Active transport was measured in E. coli MQ614 (aroP mtr tnaB tyrP1 pheP::cat) transformed with derivatives of pQ2 encoding Tyt1 with the indicated amino acid replacements. The cells were grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani medium (28Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. Overnight cultures were diluted 50-fold and were allowed to grow to an optical density at 420 nm of 1.0 followed by induction of gene expression by addition of 0.15 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min and washed four times with 50 mm Tris/Mes, pH 7.5, at 4 °C to eliminate Na+ contamination (29Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4631-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For routine uptake experiments, cells were diluted in 50 mm Tris/Mes, pH 8.5 to a total protein concentration of 0.125 mg/ml. Transport of 0.1 μm l-[ring-3,5-3H]tyrosine (54 Ci/mmol), l-[1-14C]tyrosine (434 Ci/mol) (Moravek Biochemicals), or [ring-3,5-3H]tyramine (50 Ci/mmol) (American Radio-labeled Chemicals, Inc.) was assayed in the presence of 10 mm NaCl (unless otherwise noted) at 23 °C for the indicated time periods using a rapid filtration method (30Quick M. Tebbe S. Jung H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Kinetics of sodium-dependent tyrosine transport of Tyt1 wild type and variants were determined by measuring the initial portion of the time course at different l-tyrosine concentrations (i.e. 10 s). The maximal velocity (VmaxTyr) and apparent affinity constant at half-maximum velocity (K0.5Tyr) of tyrosine transport was determined by varying the l-[1-14C]tyrosine concentration from 0.01 to 5 μm in the presence of 10 mm NaCl. For the determination of the apparent Na+ activation constant (K0.5Na+) of tyrosine transport (0.1 or 1 μm final l-[1-14C]tyrosine concentration), the NaCl concentration was increased from virtually Na+-free to 10 mm and was replaced with equimolar Tris/Mes to maintain a constant molarity of 60 mm. Inhibition of Tyrosine Transport by Thiol Reagents—E. coli MQ614 harboring pQ2 or derivatives encoding Tyt1 wild type (WT), Tyt1-CL, Tyt1-C18A, or Tyt1-C238F was cultivated and treated as described above (see “Transport Assay”). Prior to transport, cells were incubated in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) for 5 min in the presence or absence of substrate at 23 °C. The NEM concentration for each cysteine-containing Tyt1 variant was chosen to inhibit tyrosine transport by ∼95% in the absence of substrate. Unbound NEM was removed by washing the cells three times with the incubation buffer (without NEM) followed by a wash with 50 mm Tris/Mes, pH 7.5. For transport studies treated cells were diluted in 50 mm Tris/Mes, pH 8.5, and uptake of 0.1 μm l-[1-14C]tyrosine was measured for 1-min time intervals in the presence of 10 mm NaCl as described above. Data Analysis—All experiments were repeated at least three times with cells from different cultures. Figures are based on data obtained from a typical experiment, and, unless otherwise noted, data points represent the mean of a triplicate determination ±S.D. (note that error bars are not always detectable due to the size of the symbols). Data fits of kinetic analyses were performed using the non-linear regression algorithm in Prism (Version 4.03, GraphPad Software, Inc.), and errors represent the S.E. of the fit. The sequences of 252 prokaryotic NSS proteins were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information RefSeq data base through a PSI-BLAST (position-specific iterated basic local alignment search tool) search. Initial predictions of the number and location of the TM segments in these 252 prokaryotic NSS proteins were obtained from topology predictions with the algorithms HMMTOP (31Tusnády G.E. Simon I. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 849-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar) and TMHMM (32Sonnhammer E.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1998; 6: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar). These predictions were corrected by visual inspection of the predicted TM boundaries based on a complete alignment of prokaryotic and eukaryotic NSS members. 3T. Beuming, L. Shi, J. A. Javitch, and H. Weinstein, submitted. Of the 252 prokaryotic NSS proteins that were considered, ∼28% (71 including TnaT and LeuT) were predicted to have TMs 1-12, whereas ∼72% (181 including Tyt1; see below) were predicted to have TMs 1-11 but lack a 12th TM. This is in marked contrast with eukaryotic NSS proteins where virtually all members have 12 TMs (data not shown). It was not previously known whether NSS proteins can function without TM12 and thus whether this large set of prokaryotic NSS sequences encode pseudogenes or functional proteins. To determine whether prokaryotic NSS proteins with either 11 or 12 TMs belong to different subfamilies, the prediction results were plotted on a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) calculated with a maximum parsimony method (PHYLIP package, see leg-end to Fig. 1). Most of the 71 prokaryotic 12-TM transporters are clustered in three groups, two of seven (groups 1 and 2) and one of 52 (group 3), rather than distributed throughout the entire tree. In addition, although the 11-TM NSS proteins are relatively diverse, the node support for the 12-TM members is strong (bootstrap value of 89% for the major 12-TM cluster). Thus, the number of TMs is a conserved property of distinct subfamilies of prokaryotic NSS proteins as there are very few examples of homologues that are very similar in sequence but different in the number of TMs. Notably the majority of archaeal sequences (12 of 17) have 12 TMs. To compare the sequence similarity between the 12-TM and 11-TM subfamilies, pairwise sequence identities were cal culated from the alignment of these 252 prokaryotic NSS proteins. For the 11-TM and 12-TM subfamilies, the average similarity within the group is similar (33% in 11-TM and 35% in 12-TM subfamilies). The 11-TM and 12-TM subfamilies exhibit the same level of intragroup similarity (33% in 11-TM and 35% in 12-TM subfamilies). However, the average similarity is significantly lower (24%) between the two subfamilies, suggesting again that NSS proteins with 11 and 12 TMs represent distinct subfamilies. Two bacterial members of the 12-TM family, TnaT (33Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Goldberg N.R. Ueda K. Beppu T. Beckman M.L. Das S. Javitch J.A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12703-12709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and LeuT (21Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), have been shown to be sodium-dependent tryptophan and leucine transporters, respectively. However, it was not known whether the ∼70% of prokaryotic NSS proteins with 11 TM segments are functional transporters. Fig. 2 shows a sequence alignment of representative members of the two classes, illustrating the absence of TM12 in Tyt1 of F. nucleatum (34Kapatral V. Anderson I. Ivanova N. Reznik G. Los T. Lykidis A. Bhattacharyya A. Bartman A. Gardner W. Grechkin G. Zhu L. Vasieva O. Chu L. Kogan Y. Chaga O. Goltsman E. Bernal A. Larsen N. D'Souza M. Walunas T. Pusch G. Haselkorn R. Fonstein M. Kyrpides N. Overbeek R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2005-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This protein was suggested to be a sodium-dependent tyrosine transporter of the oral pathogen F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum (The Institute for Genomic Research locus FN1989, chromosome position 492571-493887) based on its linkage to a catabolic enzyme (tyrosine phenol-lyase, β-tyrosinase, 4.1.99.2) open reading frame (The Institute for Genomic Research locus FN1988, chromosome position 491058-492440). After cloning of the tyt1 gene into a pT7-5 expression plasmid derivative (24Quick M. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8597-8601Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), initial transport measurements were inconclusive due to high endogenous aromatic amino acid uptake activity (i.e. Phe, Tyr, and Trp) observed in several E. coli K12 and B strains tested (data not shown). Expression of tyt1 from the inducible T5 promoter in a pQE60 derivative revealed only marginal tyrosine accumulation above background (data not shown). To generate a suitable host strain for detailed kinetic and biochemical studies, we used E. coli CY15212, a strain already deficient in the three aromatic amino acid uptake systems, Mtr, AroP, and TnaB (25Yanofsky C. Horn V. Gollnick P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6009-6017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as the parental strain for the subsequent disruption of the tyrP and pheP genes. As shown in Fig. 3, disruption of the two additional genes in E. coli MQ614 abolished the endogenous tyrosine uptake activity observed in CY15212. Transforming MQ614 with pQ2, a pQE60 derivative containing the tyt1 gene under control of the T5 promoter, resulted in robust [3H]tyrosine accumulation after induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. To optimize the experimental conditions for active transport measurements we tested the effect of increasing the pH gradient (Δμ˜H+) and the membrane potential (ΔΨ) by decreasing the external pH of the uptake buffer and/or adding 20 mm lactate, methods generally used to stimulate secondary active transport processes (35Konings W.N. Barnes Jr., E.M. Kaback H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5857-5861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kaback H.R. Barnes Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5523-5531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Barnes Jr., E.M. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 1190-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Surprisingly at pH 6.5 the uptake activity of MQ614 transformed with pQ2 was indistinguishable from MQ614 transformed with the control plasmid (Fig. 4A). In contrast, tyrosine transport was dramatically stimulated by increasing the pH with an optimum of pH 8.5 (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4C shows the effect of varying, simultaneously, the NaCl concentration and the pH. Increasing the NaCl concentration to 100 mm (the concentration used in Fig. 4, A and B) inhibited Tyt1-catalyzed transport at both pH values tested (Fig. 4C). Therefore, with the exception of the analysis of the ion dependence on active tyrosine transport (see Fig. 5), all subsequent uptake experiments were performed at pH 8.5 in the presence of 10 mm NaCl. Under such conditions, with 100 nm [3H]tyrosine, the initial rate of tyrosine transport was ∼1500 pmol × mg of cell protein-1 × min-1, whereas the steady state of tyrosine accumulation reached about 500 pmol × mg of total cell protein-1 after 1 min (see also Fig. 8A).FIGURE 5Ion dependence of tyrosine transport by Tyt1. A, stimulation of active tyrosine transport by increasing NaCl concentrations. Initial rates of 1 μm (▪) or 0.1 μm (▵, inset) l-[1-14C]tyrosine transport were measured by varying the NaCl concentration from virtually Na+-free to 10 mm (equimolar replacement of NaCl with Tris/Mes). The half-maximum activation constant (K0.5Na+) was determined by a least squares fit of the data as 0.75 ± 0.03 mm NaCl (Hill coefficient of 2 ± 0.2) and 1.4 ± 0.1 mm (Hill coefficient of 1.9 ± 0.2) at tyrosine concentrations of 0.1 or 1 μm, respectively.

Cells of E. coli MQ614 producing Tyt1-WT, -CL, -C18A, or -C238F were cultivated and treated for transport as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Prior to uptake measurements, cells were incubated with NEM in the absence (none) or presence of 10 μm l-tyrosine (Y), 10 mm NaCl (Na), or 10 mm NaCl, 10 μm l-tyrosine (Na+Y) for 5 min at 23 °C. The concentration of NEM was adjusted for each NEM-sensitive Tyt1 variant (Tyt1-WT and -C18A: 1 mm; -C238F: 1.5 mm) to produce ∼95% reduction of active tyrosine transport in the absence of substrate compared with non-treated cells. As control, cells expressing Tyt1-CL were treated with 1.5 mm NEM.

https://openalex.org/W2024997708,"The Wnt gene family encodes secreted signaling molecules that play important roles in tumorgenesis and embryogenesis. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway regulates target gene expression via the stabilization and nuclear translocation of the cytoplasmic pool of beta-catenin. The activation of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is also known to regulate the stabilization and subsequent nuclear translocation of beta-catenin in several epithelial cell models. We now report that molecular and pharmacological inhibition of ILK activity in mammalian cells directly modulates Wnt signaling by suppressing the stabilization and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, as well as beta-catenin/Lef-mediated transcription. Inhibition of ILK activity, but not phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) or MEK activities suppresses nuclear beta-catenin stabilization in cells stably expressing Wnt3a as well as in cells exposed to either Wnt3a conditioned media or purified Wnt3a. Furthermore, ILK inhibition reverses the Wnt3a-induced suppression of beta-catenin phosphorylation that accompanies beta-catenin stabilization. In addition, we show that ILK can be identified in a complex with Wnt pathway components such as adenomatous polyposis coli and GSK-3. Upon treatment of L cells with Wnt3a-CM, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3beta) becomes highly phosphorylated on Ser 9, which is completely abolished upon inhibition of ILK activity. However, acute exposure of L cells to purified Wnt3a does not result in the stimulation of GSK-3beta Ser 9 phosphorylation, despite beta-catenin stabilization. Together our data demonstrate that ILK activity can modulate acute Wnt3a mediated beta-catenin phosphorylation, stabilization and nuclear activation in a PI3K-independent manner, as well as the more prolonged PI3K-dependent secondary effects of Wnt signaling on GSK-3 phosphorylation. Finally, we suggest that a novel small molecule inhibitor of ILK, QLT-0267, may be a useful tool in the regulation of pathological Wnt signaling."

https://openalex.org/W1972247867,"A gene critical to esophageal cancer has been identified. Functional studies using microcell-mediated chromosome transfer of intact and truncated donor chromosomes 3 into an esophageal cancer cell line and nude mouse tumorigenicity assays were used to identify a 1.61 Mb tumor suppressive critical region (CR) mapping to chromosome 3p14.2. This CR is bounded by D3S1600 and D3S1285 microsatellite markers. One candidate tumor suppressor gene, ADAMTS9, maps to this CR. Further studies showed normal expression levels of this gene in tumor-suppressed microcell hybrids, levels that were much higher than observed in the recipient cells. Complete loss or downregulation of ADAMTS9 gene expression was found in 15 out of 16 esophageal carcinoma cell lines. Promoter hypermethylation was detected in the cell lines that do not express this gene. Re-expression of ADAMTS9 was observed after demethylation drug treatment, confirming that hypermethylation is involved in gene downregulation. Downregulation of ADAMTS9 was also found in 43.5 and 47.6% of primary esophageal tumor tissues from Hong Kong and from the high-risk region of Henan, respectively. Thus, this study identifies and provides functional evidence for a CR associated with tumor suppression on 3p14.2 and provides the first evidence that ADAMTS9, mapping to this region, may contribute to esophageal cancer development."

The oncoprotein has the capacity to promote expansion of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and induces leukemia in association with other genetic alterations. Here, we show that RUNX1-ETO undergoes degradation in response to treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors, one of which, depsipeptide (DEP), is currently undergoing phase II clinical testing in a variety of malignancies. These compounds induce turnover of RUNX1-ETO without affecting the stability of RUNX1-ETO partner proteins. In addition, RUNX1-ETO physically interacts with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). DEP treatment interrupts the association of RUNX1-ETO with HSP90 and induces proteasomal degradation of RUNX1-ETO. DEP and the HSP90 antagonist 17-allylamino-geldanamycin (17-AAG) both triggered RUNX1-ETO degradation, but without any additive or cooperative effects. These findings may stimulate the development of more rational and effective approaches for treating t(8;21) patients using histone deacetylase inhibitors or HSP90 inhibitors."

Buckwalter J.A. Brandt K.D. Fries J.F. Ann. Intern. Med. 2000; 133: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). More than 20 million individuals in the United States alone have symptomatic OA, and it has been estimated that many more, greater than 50% of people over 65 years of age and 80% of those over age 75, have radiographic evidence of this disease (2Brandt K.D. Diagnosis and Nonsurgical Management of Osteoarthritis. 2nd Ed. Professional Communications, Inc, West Islip, NY2000Google Scholar). Yet, despite the widespread incidence of the disease in the human population, the etiology of OA is still largely unknown. OA is characterized by a slow focal destruction of articular cartilage, causing a roughening and thinning of the weight-bearing regions of the articular surface resulting in progressive immobility and pain. Articular cartilage is the tissue that provides shock-absorptive resiliency as well as low friction articulation to joints. It contains only a single cell type, the chondrocyte, which is responsible for the homeostasis of the tissue by synthesizing extracellular matrix that surrounds the cells and provides the important biophysical characteristics of the tissue. However, chondrocytes are also capable of producing catabolic factors capable of destroying the matrix components. Thus, extracellular matrix synthesis and degradation are dynamic processes that must be balanced by the chondrocytes for proper homeostasis of the tissue. In osteoarthritic cartilage, this balance appears to be shifted toward degradation, resulting in progressive loss of matrix due to up-regulation of proteolytic activities such as matrix metalloproteinases and aggrecanases. There is some debate whether osteoarthritis is a noninflammatory arthrosis or an inflammatory arthritis; however, synovial inflammation has been documented in OA (3Farahat M.N. Yanni G. Poston R. Panayi G.S. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1993; 52: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and inflammatory cytokines, especially interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), have been implicated as important mediators of the disease (4Hedbom E. Hauselmann H.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 5Aigner T. Kurz B. Fukui N. Sandell L. Curr. Opin.

These proinflammatory cytokines are known to be major regulators of chondrocytic expression of downstream proteases (such as aggrecanases and collagenases) that are ultimately involved in matrix breakdown resulting in the formation of osteoarthritic lesions (6Goldring M.B. Curr. Rheumatol. Rep. 2000; 2: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 8Fernandes J.C. Martel-Pelletier J. Pelletier J.P. Biorheology. 2002; 39: 237-246PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, these cytokines themselves, or components of their intracellular signaling pathways, constitute possible therapeutic intervention points that could mitigate the destruction of articular cartilage in OA. One group of signaling proteins that are shared by both the IL-1 and TNF signaling pathways are the members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of intracellular serine/threonine kinases. In the course of their convergence on the activation of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factor, both the IL-1 and TNF pathways reportedly signal through PKC family members in various cell types (9Nee L.E.

Rikihisa Y. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4132-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The PKC family is made up of several isoforms that are divided into three basic classes (“conventional,” “novel,” and “atypical”), by virtue of the structure of their regulatory domains and (consequently) their methods of activation (14Toker A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1134-D1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conventional or cPKC isoforms contain two characteristic membrane targeting domains called C1 and C2 that are capable of binding diacylglycerol (or the synthetic analog phorbol ester) or calcium, respectively, ultimately resulting in activation of the kinase. The novel or nPKC family members also contain these domains, but they are reversed in their orientation, and the C2 is modified such that it is unresponsive to calcium. The human atypical or aPKC group consists of only two members, ζ and ι (called λ in mouse), both of which lack a C2 domain and possess only a modified C1 domain. Atypical PKC isoforms are insensitive to both diacylglycerol and calcium but are activated by phosphatidylserine. In an effort to gain understanding of the pathological processes that underlie the development and progression of OA, we performed experiments to identify transcriptional alterations in articular chondrocytes that distinguish patients with end stage OA from normal subjects. This work revealed that PKCζ was the only member of the protein kinase C family with dysregulated expression in chondrocytes from human osteoarthritic cartilage. PKCζ has been implicated previously in the NF-κB signaling pathway in some cell types, but its function in chondrocytes has not been well characterized. In this study, we utilized chondrocyte-based assay systems to investigate the role of PKCζ on TNFand IL-1-mediated activation of NF-κB, and on the consequent proteoglycan degradation that results from the activation of the NF-κB pathway. We find that NF-κB activation by TNF and IL-1 in chondrocytes requires PKCζ activity and, most importantly, that inhibition of PKCζ blocks cytokine-mediated up-regulation of aggrecanase expression and the resulting destruction of articular cartilage extracellular matrix proteoglycans that is a hallmark of the OA disease process. Thus, PKCζ constitutes a pivotal signaling molecule in the catabolic pathways initiated by the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF in articular chondrocytes and may represent an important therapeutic target.

Primary Chondrocyte Isolation and Culture—Bovine cartilage was obtained from the metacarpophalangeal joint of calves (2–10 days old), and chondrocytes were isolated by serial enzymatic digestion using Pronase (1 mg/ml, 37 °C for 30 min) and collagenase (1 mg/ml, 37 °C for overnight) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10 mm HEPES, and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The digest was filtered through a 70-μm nylon cell strainer (Falcon) and processed as described (24Arai M. Anderson D. Kurdi Y. Annis-Freeman B. Shields K. Collins-Racie L.A. Corcoran C.

Cells were resuspended in growth media (HL-1 media, Cambrex catalog number 77201) containing 2 μm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml ascorbate, antibiotics, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and aliquoted into 15-ml Falcon centrifuge tubes at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells per tube. The tubes were centrifuged at 200 × g at room temperature to allow formation of cell pellets and subsequently incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with low oxygen tension (5% O2) to retain their differentiated chondrocytic phenotype and to maximize the production of extracellular matrix (25Domm C. Schunke M. Christesen K. Kurz B. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2002; 10: 13-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). For inhibitor studies, chondrocyte pellets were weaned from the serum gradually by replacing the media every 3–4 days with decreasing concentrations of FBS (5, 2.5, and 0%). Chondrocytes were then cultured in pellet form for 3 weeks in the absence of serum to allow the accumulation of the proteoglycanand collagen-containing extracellular matrix. Chondrocyte cell pellets were preincubated for 2 h with inhibitors prior to cytokine stimulation for 18 h. The level of sulfated glycosaminoglycan in the culture media and cartilage/pellet extracts was determined by the dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay (26Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2879) Google Scholar). Shark and whale chondroitin sulfate (Fluka Biochemika, Switzerland) was used as a standard. Cytotoxicity testing was performed for each of the inhibitors at the concentrations used in the pellet culture assays by measuring lactate levels in culture media as an indicator of cellular metabolism and viability using a kit from Sigma. Isolation of RNA from Primary Cartilage Tissue and from Chondrocytes in Culture—RNA was isolated from human osteoarthritic articular cartilage samples obtained from patients (n = 18, mean age = 66.2 years, range 49–84 years) undergoing total knee replacement surgery (New England Baptist Hospital) or from nonosteoarthritic cartilage obtained from above-knee amputations (n = 10, mean age = 71.6 years, range 43–100) (Clinomics). The OA cartilage samples were obtained as whole joints within2hof surgery, and the articular cartilage was shaved from the joint surfaces taking great care to avoid any pannus, fibrotic tissues, subchondral bone, and other noncartilaginous regions of the joint (27Shibakawa A. Aoki H. Masuko-Hongo K. Kato T. Tanaka M. Nishioka K. Nakamura H. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2003; 11: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Nonosteoarthritic cartilage samples were obtained from individuals without a clinical diagnosis nor symptoms of OA, and the specimens were evaluated histologically to confirm the classification prior to inclusion in this study. Cartilage pieces were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until processed for RNA isolation. The frozen cartilage was pulverized using a Spex Certiprep freezer mill (model 6750) at 15 Hz two times for 1 min each under liquid nitrogen. The frozen powdered cartilage was resuspended in 4 m guanidinium isothiocyanate (Invitrogen) containing 8.9 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and homogenized on ice with a Polytron homogenizer at maximum speed setting twice for 1 min each time, with a 1 min “rest” between homogenizations. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was saved. The gelatinous pellet was resuspended in guanidinium isothiocyanate/2-mercaptoethanol and homogenized a second time as described above. The pellet was then discarded, and the two resulting supernatant fractions were combined and incubated with Triton X-100 (2% final concentration) and sodium acetate (pH 5.5, 1.5 m final concentration) sequentially for 15 min each. The samples were extracted once with an equal volume of acid phenol chloroform, pH 4.5, and twice with acid phenol, pH 4.5, phenol, pH 7.5, chloroform mix (1:1:1). RNA was subsequently precipitated by the addition of isopropyl alcohol, and further purified using an RNeasy mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA quantity and purity were measured by ultraviolet absorbance at A260/A280, and RNA quality was assessed by the RNA6000 assay using the Agilent BioAnalyzer 2100 (Palo Alto, CA). RNA yields averaged between 5 and 10 μg of total RNA per g of cartilage tissue. For isolation of RNA from chondrocyte pellet cultures and from chondrocytes in monolayer culture, no pulverization was required. Pellets were digested with collagenase (2.5 mg/ml, Sigma), and RNA was subsequently prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primary chondrocytes and chondrocytic cell lines in monolayer culture were lysed by direct addition of TRIzol reagent followed by standard TRIzol RNA purification methodologies. Microarray Analysis of Osteoarthritic and Normal Cartilage—Gene expression changes in RNA from lesional (n = 14) and adjacent nonlesional (n = 13) osteoarthritic cartilage compared with nonosteoarthritic cartilage (n = 10) were analyzed using the Human Genome U95Av2 (HG-U95Av2) GeneChip® Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) for expression profiling. The HG-U95Av2 chip contains 25-mer oligonucleotide probes representing ∼12,000 primarily full-length sequences (∼16 probe pairs/sequence) derived from the human genome. For each probe that is designed to be perfectly complementary to a target sequence, a partner probe is generated that is identical except for a single base mismatch in its center. These probe pairs allow for signal quantitation and subtraction of nonspecific noise. RNA was extracted from individual articular cartilage tissue samples, converted to biotinylated cRNA, and fragmented according to the Affymetrix protocol. The fragmented cRNAs were diluted in 1× MES buffer containing 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA and 500 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin and denatured for 5 min at 99 °C followed immediately by 5 min at 45 °C. Insoluble material was removed from the hybridization mixtures by a brief centrifugation, and the hybridization mixture was added to each array and incubated at 45 °C for 16 h with continuous rotation at 60 rpm. After incubation, the hybridization mixture was removed, and the chips were extensively washed and stained with streptavidin (R)-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) using the GeneChip® Fluidics Station 400 following the manufacturer's specifications. The raw fluorescent intensity value of each transcript was measured at a resolution of 6 μm with a Hewlett-Packard Gene Array Scanner. GeneChip® software 3.2 (Affymetrix), which uses an algorithm to determine whether a gene is “present” or “absent,” as well as the specific hybridization intensity values or “average differences” of each gene on the array, was used to evaluate the fluorescent data. The average difference for each gene was normalized to frequency values by referral to the average differences of 11 control transcripts of known abundance that were spiked into each hybridization mixture according to the procedure of Hill et al. (28Hill A.A. Hunter C.P. Tsung B.T. Tucker-Kellogg G. Brown E.L. Science. 2000; 290: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). First, the frequency of each gene was calculated and represents a value equal to the total number of individual gene transcripts per 106 total transcripts. Transcripts which were called present by the GeneChip® software in at least one of the arrays for both arthritis and normal cartilage, were included in the analysis. Second, for comparison between arthritis and normal cartilage, a t test was applied to identify the subset of transcripts that had a significant (p < 0.05) increase or decrease in frequency values. Third, average fold changes in frequency values across the statistically significant subset of transcripts were required to be 2.0-fold or greater. These criteria were established based upon replicate experiments that estimated the intra-array reproducibility. Quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan®)—RNA for TaqMan® analysis (ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was isolated from primary cartilage tissue as described above and then further purified with two more rounds of phenol/chloroform extraction followed by RNeasy (Qiagen) column binding and elution. To ensure the elimination of genomic DNA, RNA was treated with DNase (Qiagen) during RNeasy column purification (as recommended by the supplier), and following the RNA purification any residual genomic DNA was removed using DNA-free (Ambion, Austin, TX), following that manufacturer's instructions. For comparison of PKCζ and PKCι mRNA levels in human OA chondrocytes, human primary chondrocytes were isolated as described above for bovine primary chondrocytes. The primary chondrocytes were plated in a 24-well format (2 × 106/well) in DMEM/F-12 + 10% FBS + 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin for 2 days. The cells were lysed, and RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). 200 ng of RNA was used for each TaqMan assay in the TaqMan one-step RT-PCR method (Applied Biosystems). The human PKCζ and PKCι probe/primer sets were “Assays on Demand” from Applied Biosystems, assay identification Hs00177051_m1 and Hs00702254_s1, respectively. Assay mixtures and cycling conditions were per the manufacturer's recommendation. Oligonucleotide primers and fluorescent-labeled TaqMan probes for bovine ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5, and GAPDH cDNA sequences were designed using Primer Express 1.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Sequences for primers and probes were as follows: bADAMTS-4 forward, 5′-TGTGTGGTGGGGATGGTT-3′, reverse, 5′-GCACCAGGATGTGGGTG-3′, and probe, 5′-FAM-CTGGCTCCTTCAAAAAATTCAGGTACGGA-TAMRA-3′; bADAMTS-5 forward, 5′ATTTCGGCTCCACGGAAGAT-3′, reverse, 5′-TTCTGTGATGGTGGCTGAGG-3′, and probe, 5′-FAM-ATTGACGCATCCAAACCCTGGTCCA-TAMRA-3′; bGAPDH forward, 5′-AAAGTGGACATCGTCGCCAT-3′, reverse, 5′-GACTGTGCCGTTGAACTTGC-3′, and probe, 5′-FAM-TTCACTACATGGTCTACATGTTCCAGTATGATTCCA-TAMRA-3′. TaqMan PCR analysis was performed using the Applied Biosystems ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (TaqMan). PCRs for all samples were performed in duplicate (20 ng of DNase-treated purified total RNA) using TaqMan one-step PCR master mix reagent kit (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's protocol. Thermocycler conditions comprised an initial reverse transcription step with incubation at 48 °C for 30 min, followed by AmpliTaq Gold enzyme activation at 95 °C for 10 min, and finally PCR amplification performed at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. Threshold cycle (CT) values were obtained for ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5, and the values were divided by CT values for GAPDH to obtain the relative expression level of aggrecanases normalized to GAPDH expression. Phosphoprotein Analysis of PKCζ—For the chondrocyte cell line, T/C-28a2 cells (23Goldring M.B. Birkhead J.R. Suen L.F. Yamin R. Mizuno S. Glowacki J. Arbiser J.L. Apperley J.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 2307-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Mary Goldring) were plated in a 24-well format in DMEM/F-12 + 10% FBS + 1% antimycotic antibiotic solution and grown to confluence. After the cells became confluent, they were changed to serum-free medium, allowed to adapt to serum-free conditions overnight, and were then stimulated with 20 ng/ml recombinant human IL-1β (R & D Systems) for varying lengths of time (0–30 min). The cells were immediately lysed at the conclusion of each time point with 1× Cell Lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies). PKCζ was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates with a monoclonal antibody to p62 Lck ligand (BD Transduction Laboratories). The immunoprecipitated proteins were then run on 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and Western analysis was performed using either a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes PKCζ phosphorylated at position Thr410 (Cell Signaling Technologies) or with a monoclonal antibody raised to the carboxyl-terminal 20 amino acids of PKCζ (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The C-20 antibody recognizes total PKCζ regardless of its phosphorylation state. For bovine primary chondrocytes, primary bovine chondrocytes were isolated from fresh bovine metacarpophalangeal joints as described above. The primary chondrocytes were plated in a 24-well format (2 × 106 cells/well) in DMEM/F-12 + 10% FBS + 1% antimycotic antibiotic solution for 2 days and then switched to serum-free media overnight prior to cytokine induction. The cells were treated with IL-1α (20 ng/ml) for various time points; the cells were lysed, and the lysate was analyzed as described above for the T/C-28a2 cells. Western blots were visualized using a goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate followed by detection using the ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Band intensities were determined by scanning the developed Western blots with a Gel Doc 2000 PC using the Quantity One quantitation software (Bio-Rad). The degree of phosphorylation for each sample was determined by calculating the ratio of phospho-PKCζ to total PKCζ. Immunodetection of Aggrecan Cleavage Product—Detection of aggrecan cleavage sites in pellet culture conditioned media was performed using neoepitope monoclonal antibody Agg-C1 (anti-NITGE373, detects aggrecanase cleavage at aggrecan interglobular domain site (24Arai M.

https://openalex.org/W2087305746,"Reports that the adhesion-associated molecule p130Cas/BCAR1 promotes resistance to tamoxifen suggested that adhesion-mediated signalling may be altered by tamoxifen treatment. We find that p130Cas/BCAR1 phosphorylation is enhanced in tamoxifen-treated estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The effects of estrogen and tamoxifen were assessed independently and in combination, and the results demonstrate that tamoxifen antagonizes estrogen regulation of p130Cas/BCAR1 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation correlates with tamoxifen ER antagonist effects, as phosphorylation effects are replicated by the pure antiestrogen ICI 182, 780. Correspondingly, phosphorylation is not changed in ER-negative cells exposed to tamoxifen. We show that deletion of the p130Cas/BCAR1 substrate domain substantially reduces tamoxifen-induced phosphorylation of p130Cas/BCAR1 and confers enhanced sensitivity to tamoxifen. P130Cas/BCAR1 forms a phosphorylation-dependent signalling complex with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src kinase that promotes adhesion-mediated cell survival. Therefore, we examined the kinetics of p130Cas/BCAR1, Src and FAK phosphorylation over a 14-day time course and find sustained phosphorylation of these molecules after 7 days exposure to tamoxifen. Inhibition of Src kinase is shown to reduce tamoxifen-promoted p130Cas/BCAR1 phosphorylation and reduce cell viability. Stimulation of the Src/FAK/p130Cas/BCAR1 adhesion signalling pathway in tamoxifen-treated MCF-7 cells does not cause increased migration; however, there is Src-dependent phosphorylation of the cell survival molecule Akt. Correspondingly, Akt inhibition reduces cell viability in cells treated with tamoxifen. We propose that prolonged activation of adhesion-dependent signalling may confer a survival advantage in response to additional cellular insults or alternatively, may poise cells to develop a migratory phenotype in response to additional cellular cues."

Recently, we have shown that Chk2 associates with the oncogenic Wip1 (PPM1D) phosphatase and that Wip1 acts as a negative regulator of Chk2 during DNA damage response by dephosphorylating phosphorylated Thr-68 in activated Chk2 (Fujimoto, H., Onishi, N., Kato, N., Takekawa, M., Xu, X. Z., Kosugi, A., Kondo, T., Imamura, M., Oishi, I., Yoda, A., and Minami, Y. (2006) Cell Death Differ. 13, 1170-1180). Here, we performed structure-function analyses of Chk2 and Wip1 by using a series of deletion or amino acid-substituted mutant proteins of Chk2 and Wip1. We show that nuclear localization of both Chk2 and Wip1 is required for their association in cultured cells and that the serine-glutamine (SQ)/threonine-glutamine (TQ) domain of Chk2, containing Thr-68, and the N-terminal domain of Wip1, comprising about 100 amino acids, are necessary and sufficient for the association of both molecules. However, it was found that an intrinsic kinase activity of Chk2, but not phosphatase activity of Wip1, is required for the association of fulllength Chk2 and Wip1. Interestingly, we also show that the mutant Wip1 proteins, bearing the N-terminal domain of Wip1 alone or lacking an intrinsic phosphatase activity, exhibit dominant negative effects on the functions of the wild-type Wip1, i.e. ectopic expression of either of these Wip1 mutants inhibits dephosphorylation of Thr-68 in Chk2 by Wip1 and anti-apoptotic function of Wip1. These results provide a molecular basis for developing novel anti-cancer drugs, targeting oncogenic Wip1 phosphatase.

It has also been reported that mice deficient for Wip1 show defects in spermatogenesis, lymphoid function, and cell cycle regulation (44Choi J. Nannenga B. Demidov O.N. Bulavin D.V. Cooney A.

In addition, a recent study using Wip1-deficient mice has revealed that blocking its function results in enhanced apoptosis in Ras and Erbb2-induced breast tumors and impairs tumor formation (45Harrison M.

We have also shown that Wip1 associates with Chk2 both physically and functionally in the nuclei of human cells (48Fujimoto H. Onishi N. Kato N. Takekawa M. Xu X.Z. Kosugi A. Kondo T. Imamura M. Oishi I. Yoda A. Minami Y. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1170-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Wip1 dephosphorylates Thr-68 in activated Chk2 and inactivates Chk2 kinase. Interestingly, Wip1 appears to dephosphorylate preferably a phosphorylated serine or threonine followed by a glutamine in Chk2 as well as Chk1 and p53 (39Lu X. Nannenga B. Donehower L.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1162-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 48Fujimoto H. Onishi N. Kato N. Takekawa M. Xu X.Z. Kosugi A. Kondo T. Imamura M. Oishi I. Yoda A. Minami Y. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1170-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of Wip1 expression by RNA interference results in abnormally sustained Thr-68 phosphorylation and kinase activation of Chk2 and enhanced apoptosis in response to DNA damage. These results indicate that Wip1 acts as a negative regulator of Chk2 during DNA damage responses. However, it remains largely unknown about the structure-function relationship between Chk2 and Wip1 during DNA damage responses.As an attempt to understand the structure-function relationship between Chk2 kinase and Wip1 phosphatase, we generated a series of Chk2 and Wip1 mutant proteins. Here we show that Chk2 and Wip1 associate directly in vitro and that the SQ/TQ domain of Chk2 and the N-terminal domain of Wip1, comprising about 100 amino acids (aa), are necessary and sufficient for the association between Chk2 and Wip1 in vivo.It was also found that an intrinsic kinase activity and the NLS sequence of Chk2, but not a phosphatase activity of Wip1, are required for the association of full-length Chk2 and Wip1. Interestingly, expression of the mutant Wip1 protein bearing the N-terminal domain of Wip1 alone or of the phosphatase-deficient mutant Wip1 protein inhibits both suppression of Thr-68 phosphorylation in Chk2 and anti-apoptotic function mediated by the wild-type Wip1, indicating a dominant negative function of these Wip1 mutants in the regulation of Chk2. We discuss the possible application of our findings to develop novel anti-cancer drugs targeting Wip1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructions—Mammalian expression plasmids pEBG-Chk2(WT) (encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HA-Chk2), pcDNA-FLAG-Wip1(WT), and pcDNA-FLAG-Wip1(D/A) were constructed as described previously (48Fujimoto H.

Base-substituted and/or internal deletion mutants were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using pEBG-Chk2 and pcDNA-FLAG-Wip1 as templates (48Fujimoto H. Onishi N. Kato N. Takekawa M.

Prokaryotic expression vectors were constructed in pGEX (GE Healthcare) or pMAL-C2 (New England Biolabs). A plasmid expressing a tamoxifen-regulated form of Wip1, pECE-HA-Wip1(1-516)-ER, was constructed by ligation of the cDNA encoding for amino acids 1-516 of Wip1 at the 3′ end to a cDNA encoding a mutated ligand-binding domain of estrogen receptor (ER) in pECE-HA vector (49Tran H.

Primer sequences and detailed cloning strategies are available upon request.Antibodies, Cells, and DNA Transfection—The mouse monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma) recognizes the FLAG peptide sequence (DYKDDDDK). The mouse monoclonal antibody 16B12 (Babco) and rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody Y-11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) recognize the peptide sequence (YPYDVPDYA) derived from the human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Chk2 antibody and rabbit polyclonal anti-Wip1 antibody were prepared as described (48Fujimoto H. Onishi N. Kato N. Takekawa M. Xu X.Z. Kosugi A. Kondo T. Imamura M. Oishi I. Yoda A. Minami Y. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1170-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Chk2 (Thr-68 and Ser-516) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling; mouse monoclonal anti-Chk2 antibody (DCS-270) was from Sigma; mouse monoclonal anti-Wip1 antibody (WC10) was from Trevigen, Inc.; goat polyclonal anti-GST antibody was from GE Healthcare; and Alexa Fluor 546 (goat anti-mouse IgG, red) and Alexa Fluor 488 (goat anti-rabbit IgG, green) were from Invitrogen. HEK293T (293T), A549, and MCF7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS). Transient cDNA transfection was performed using the calcium phosphate method (10Oishi I. Sugiyama S. Otani H. Yamamura H. Nishida Y. Minami Y. Mech. Dev. 1998; 71: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.In Vitro Binding Analyses—The GST or maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified by the use of glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) or amylose resin beads (New England Biolabs), respectively. Purified GST or GST fusion proteins (1 μg each) were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Then MBP-Chk2(WT) or -Chk2(SQ/TQ) (1 μg each) was applied to the GST fusion protein-immobilized beads equilibrated with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. Pelletized beads were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, eluted with Laemmli sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analyses.Preparation of Cell Lysates and Co-(immuno)precipitation/Immunoblot Analyses—The cells were solubilized with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and cell lysates were prepared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4°C. The pre-cleared supernatants were then co-(immuno) precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads or with antibodies conjugated to protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The (immuno)precipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins either from the co-(immuno)precipitation analysis or whole-cell lysates (WCLs) were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% PAGE), and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filters (Immobilon, Millipore). The membranes were immunoblotted with the respective antibodies, and bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against mouse or rabbit IgGs (Bio-Rad) using chemiluminescence reagents (Western Lightning, PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Immunofluorescence Analysis—293T cells grown on coverslips coated with rat tail collagen were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min at room temperature and then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. After blocking with PBS containing 10% (v/v) FCS for 30 min, cells were incubated with primary antibodies, anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2, 1:500), and/or anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Y-11, 1:200), in PBS containing 10% (v/v) FCS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated with secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 546 (goat anti-mouse IgG, 1:500) and/or Alexa Fluor 488 (goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:200) in PBS, 10% (v/v) FCS for 30 min at room temperature. After two washes with PBS, cells were mounted with Pristine Mount (Research Genetics) and analyzed with an inverted confocal laser microscope (Zeiss). The nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Nuclear foci of phosphorylated Chk2 were visualized by using anti-phospho-Chk2(Thr-68) antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions.In Vitro Phosphatase Assay—To prepare phosphorylated GST-HA-Chk2(WT), 293T cells were transfected with the expression vector encoding GST-HA-Chk2(WT). 24 h after transfection, cells were exposed to 10 Gy γ-irradiation and cultured for 1 h prior to harvest. Phosphorylated GST-HA-Chk2(WT) was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, washed five times with lysis buffer, washed once with phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 30 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% 2-mercaptoethanol), and resuspended in phosphatase buffer. The in vitro phosphatase reaction was initiated by addition of purified GST-Wip1(WT) to phosphorylated GST-HA-Chk2(WT) in the presence or absence of MBP-Chk2(SQ/TQ) or MBP and allowed to incubate for 3 h at 30°C. Pelletized beads were washed once with lysis buffer, eluted with Laemmli sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analyses.Apoptosis Assay—A549 or MCF7 cells grown on coverslips in 6-well plates were transfected with pEBG-Chk2(WT) (1 μg/well), pEBG-Chk2(SQ/TQ) (1 μg/well), pEBG-Chk2(DK) (1 μg/well), pEBG-Chk2(Δkinase) (1 μg/well), pcDNA-FLAG-Wip1(N) (1 μg/well), pcDNA-FLAG-Wip1(D/A) (1 μg/well), or pcDNA-FLAG-Wip1(WT) (0.1 μg/well), pEGFP (Clontech) (1 μg/well) alone or in combination. The total amount of plasmid DNAs in each transfection was adjusted to 2.1μg/well with pcDNA3 empty vector. 24 h after transfection cells were exposed to γ-irradiation (10 Gy). 10 h after γ-irradiation, cells were stained as described above. The fractions of apoptotic cells were determined by dividing the number of FLAG- and HA-positive cells that exhibit apoptotic morphology (round cell shape with condensed nucleus) by the number of FLAG- and HA-positive cells. At least 200 FLAG- and HA-positive cells were counted. The assays were performed in triplicate.RESULTSChk2 Associates with Wip1 in Vivo—We have previously reported that Chk2 associates with Wip1 when both molecules are expressed ectopically in 293T cells, and that endogenous Chk2 and Wip1 associate in MCF7 cells that express Wip1 at a higher level (48Fujimoto H. Onishi N. Kato N. Takekawa M. Xu X.Z. Kosugi A. Kondo T. Imamura M. Oishi I. Yoda A. Minami Y. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1170-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To confirm further their association in vivo, we examined the association of endogenous Chk2 and Wip1 in A549 cells that express Wip1 at relatively a lower level than MCF7 cells using anti-Chk2 and anti-Wip1 antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1A, endogenous Chk2 and Wip1 also associated in A549 cells. To examine whether Chk2 directly binds to Wip1, we performed in vitro binding analyses using maltose-binding protein (MBP)-Chk2(WT) and GST-Wip1(WT) purified from E. coli, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1B, MBP-Chk2(WT) associated specifically with GST-Wip1(WT), but not with GST, indicating that the Chk2 and Wip1 can associate directly.It has been shown that the Thr-68-phosphorylated Chk2 forms distinct nuclear foci in response to γ-irradiation (51Ward I.M. Wu X. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47755-47758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To examine the functional significance of the association between Chk2 and Wip1 in this γ-irradiation-induced formation of nuclear foci, wild-type (WT) or a phosphatase-deficient (D/A) Wip1 protein was expressed in A549 cells, and nuclear foci of phospho-Chk2 were monitored by immunofluorescence analysis using anti-phospho-Chk2(Thr-68) antibody following γ-irradiation. As shown in Fig. 1C, expression levels of Chk2 protein were unaffected in the presence or absence of transfected Wip1. However, ectopic expression of Wip1(WT), but not Wip1(D/A), resulted in decreased numbers of foci detected by anti-phospho-Chk2(Thr-68) antibody (Fig. 1C), suggesting that Wip1 phosphatase activity can counteract Chk2 phosphorylation. A similar result was obtained when MCF7 cells, transfected with Wip1(WT) or Wip1(D/A), were subjected to a similar immunofluorescence analysis following γ-irradiation (data not shown).The SQ/TQ Domain, Kinase Activity, and Nuclear Localization of Chk2 Are Required for the Association of Chk2 with Wip1 in Vivo—To determine a region(s) within Chk2 that is required for its association with Wip1 in vivo, we generated a series of truncated, internal deletion or amino acid-substituted mutant Chk2 constructs (Fig. 2A). GST-HA-tagged wild-type or the respective mutant Chk2 proteins were expressed transiently in 293T cells along with FLAG-Wip1(WT), and the transfected cells were"

https://openalex.org/W1999895549,"Detachment of normal epithelial cells from the extracellular matrix triggers apoptosis, a phenomenon called anoikis. Conversely, carcinoma cells tend to be relatively more anoikis-resistant than their normal counterparts, and this increased resistance represents a critical feature of the malignant phenotype. Mechanisms that control susceptibility and resistance to anoikis are not fully understood. It is now known that detachment of non-malignant epithelial cells triggers both pro- and antiapoptotic signals, and it is the balance between these signals and the duration of detachment that determine further fate of the cells. Detachment-induced antiapoptotic events delay anoikis and if cells reattach relatively soon after detachment they survive. Direct regulators of apoptosis responsible for this delay of anoikis are unknown. We found that detachment of non-malignant intestinal epithelial cells triggers upregulation of inhibitors of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, such as X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis-2 (cIAP2). We demonstrated that this upregulation requires detachment-dependent activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB. We further observed that various IAP antagonists accelerate anoikis, indicating that upregulation of the IAPs delays detachment-triggered apoptosis. We conclude that the IAPs are important regulators of the balance between detachment-triggered life and death signals. Perhaps, not by coincidence, these proteins are often upregulated in carcinomas, tumors composed of cells that tend to be anoikis-resistant."
https://openalex.org/W2025960588,"Progestin regulation of gene expression was assessed in the progestin-dependent murine tumor line C4HD which requires MPA, a synthetic progestin, for in vivo growth and expresses high levels of progesterone receptor (PR). By using suppressive subtractive hybridization, caveolin-1 was identified as a gene whose expression was increased with in vivo MPA treatment. By Northern and Western blot analysis, we further confirmed that caveolin-1 mRNA and protein expression increased in MPA-treated tumors as compared with untreated tumors. When primary cultures of C4HD cells were treated in vitro with MPA, caveolin-1 levels also increased, effect that was abolished by pre-treatment with progestin antagonist RU486. In addition, MPA promoted strong caveolin-1 promoter transcriptional activation both in mouse and human breast cancer cells. We also showed that MPA regulation of caveolin-1 expression involved in activation of two signaling pathways: MAPK and PI-3K. Short-term MPA treatment of C4HD cells led to tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 protein, where Src was the kinase involved. Additionally, we showed that MPA-induced association of caveolin-1 and PR, which was detected by coimmunoprecipitation and by confocal microscopy. Finally, we proved that MPA-induced proliferation of C4HD cells was inhibited by suppression of caveolin-1 expression with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to caveolin-1 mRNA. Furthermore, we observed that inhibition of caveolin-1 expression abrogated PR capacity to induced luciferase activity from a progesterone response element-driven reporter plasmid. Comprehensively, our results demonstrated for the first time that caveolin-1 expression is upregulated by progestin in breast cancer. We also demonstrated that caveolin-1 is a downstream effector of MPA that is partially responsible for the stimulation of growth of breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2034226710,"The continuous production of the CXC ligand 1 (CXCL1) chemokine by melanoma cells is a major effector of tumor growth. We have previously shown that the constitutive expression of this chemokine is dependent upon transcription factors nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), stimulating protein-1 (SP1), high-mobility group-I/Y (HMGI/Y), CAAT displacement protein (CDP) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of CXCL1 through PARP-1 in melanoma cells. In its inactive state, PARP-1 binds to the CXCL1 promoter in a sequence-specific manner and prevents binding of NF-κB (p65/p50) to its element. However, activation of the PARP-1 enzymatic activity enhances CXCL1 expression, owing to the loss of PARP-1 binding to the CXCL1 promoter, accompanied by enhanced binding of p65 to the promoter. The delineation of the role of NF-κB-interacting factors in the putative CXCL1 enhanceosome will provide key information in developing strategies to block constitutive expression of this and other chemokines in cancer and to develop targeted therapy."

At least 27 collagen types, which are formed from 42 distinct polypeptide chains, exist in vertebrates (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I.

In addition, more than 20 additional proteins that adopt collagen-like structures, such as collectins, ficolins, and scavenger receptors, are also found (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Collagen is an essential molecule in vertebrates, as it plays the dominant role in maintaining the structure of tissues. However, collagen and collagen-like proteins have many other important roles, such as cell adhesion, chemotaxis, cell migration, and the regulation of tissue remodeling during cell growth, differentiation, morphogenesis, and wound healing (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar).All collagen molecules consist of three polypeptide chains. These chains, called α chains, contain at least one domain composed of repeating Gly-Xaa-Yaa sequences (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I.

Three α chains, which are each coiled into a polyproline II-like left-handed structure, twist around each other to form a loose right-handed superhelix, the so-called collagen triple helix. The presence of the small glycine residue at every third position in collagen is essential, because the compact triple helix places every third residue near the superhelical central axis. Collagen also has a high imino acid content (∼20%) and typically contains Pro and (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4(R)Hyp) 2The abbreviations used are: 4(R)Hyp, (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline; 3(S)Hyp, (2S,3S)-3-hydroxyproline; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; ASU, asymmetric unit.2The abbreviations used are: 4(R)Hyp, (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline; 3(S)Hyp, (2S,3S)-3-hydroxyproline; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; ASU, asymmetric unit. in the Xaa and Yaa positions, respectively.

These structures, when combined with stability studies, have provided a detailed account of amino acid propensities for the collagen triple helix.In addition, quantum mechanical ab initio calculations have elucidated the specific roles of stereoelectronic effects, ring pucker, cis/trans stabilization, and φ/ψ dihedral angles in Pro and 4(R)Hyp residues and the effect of these parameters in the stability of the collagen triple helix (17Improta R.

These studies reveal that electronegative (4S) and 4(R) substituents on Pro residues strongly favor down ring and up ring puckering, respectively. Thus, collagen stability is linked to the interplay between the pyrrolidine ring pucker, φ/ψ dihedral angles, and the cis/trans conformation. An important conclusion from these combined studies is that down pucker is preferred in the Xaa positions, and up pucker is preferred in the Yaa positions of the collagen triple helix (17Improta R. Mele F. Crescenzi O. Benzi C. Barone V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7857-7865Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18DeRider M.L. Wilkens S.J. Waddell M.J. Bretscher L.E. Weinhold F.

Soc. 2003; 125: 6422-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).These studies are consistent with the finding that 4(R)Hyp, which prefers the up pucker conformation, is preferred in the Yaa position and, in fact, is necessary for the stabilization of the collagen triple helix. Because 4(R)Hyp residues adopt preferentially the up pucker, they preorganize the main chain dihedral angles in a conformation that favors triple helix structure (21Holmgren S.K. Taylor K.M. Bretscher L.E. Raines R.T. Nature. 1998; 392: 666-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 22Holmgren S.K. Bretscher L.E. Taylor K.M. Raines R.T. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 63-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The importance of this stability is reflected in the finding that Gly-Xaa-4(R)Hyp triplets account for ∼40% of the amino acid sequence of collagens (23Ramshaw J.A.M. Shah N.K. Brodsky B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). 4(R)Hyp residues are formed from post-translational modification of Pro residues in unfolded collagen, as mediated by prolyl 4-hydroxylases (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 2Myllyharju J.

The important role played by 4(R)Hyp in collagen structure/function is further underscored by the finding that knocking out the prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is lethal (28Winter A.D. Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).In addition to prolyl 4-hydroxylation, two additional post-translational modifications mediated by hydroxylases are observed and important in collagen, the formation of hydroxylysine and (2S,3S)-3-hydroxyproline (3(S)Hyp). The hydroxylation of lysine residues, in the sequence Gly-Xaa-Lys, is carried out by one of three well characterized lysyl hydroxylases (29Yeowell H.N. Walker L.C. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 212-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This modification allows for the formation of intermolecular collagen cross-links and the attachment of carbohydrate units to lysyl hydroxyl groups. Hydroxylation of Pro residues in the Xaa positions to 3(S)Hyp is mediated by the recently characterized prolyl 3-hydroxylase enzymes (30Vranka J.A. Sakai L.Y. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23615-23621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The occurrence of 3(S)Hyp is significantly less frequent than that of 4(R)Hyp in the total amino acid content of collagens. The fibrillar collagens, types I-III, contain a single 3(S)Hyp residue per chain, and higher modification levels are typically restricted to collagen types IV and V and are, thus, most abundant in basement membrane collagens (31Rhodes R.K. Miller E.J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3442-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 32Kefalides N.A. Int. Rev. Connect. Tissue Res. 1973; 6: 63-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Acetyl-3(S)Hyp-O-methylester strongly favors a down puckered ring conformation (20Jenkins C.L. Bretscher L.E. Guzei I.A. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6422-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), similar to the preferred pucker for the Xaa position of the collagen triple helix. Because of this, it was predicted that placing 3(S)Hyp in the Xaa position, similar to placing 4(R)Hyp in the Yaa position, should preorganize the main chain dihedral angles properly for triple helix formation. Indeed, it was thought that a triple helix with 3(S)Hyp residues in the Xaa position would be more stable than one with Pro residues at this position, as Pro does not favor one pucker type (up or down) over the other. Thus, it was a surprise when it was found that peptides with sequences containing long stretches of (3(S)Hyp)-(4(R)Hyp)-Gly do not form stable triple helices (33Mizuno K. Hayashi T. Peyton D.H. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 282-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, when Raines and co-workers (20Jenkins C.L. Bretscher L.E. Guzei I.A. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6422-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) examined this issue via host guest peptides, specifically, with (Pro-4(R)Hyp-Gly)3-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp-Gly-(Pro-4(R)Hyp-Gly)3, they found that the presence of 3(S)Hyp residues embedded in the Xaa position of this peptide only decreased the transition midpoint temperature (Tm) value of the triple helix formation by 3 °C compared with a peptide with a Pro in the corresponding position. Nonetheless, the presence of the 3(S)Hyp in the Xaa position was clearly destabilizing rather than stabilizing. This finding leads to the suggestion that the presence of 3(S)Hyp in collagen functions to modulate the stability of basement membranes to allow for the meshwork-like structures they form. On the other hand, 3(S)Hyp may locally destabilize areas of the collagen network to allow for protein-protein interactions. Whatever its role, 3(S)Hyp is clearly an integral part of the collagen triple helix in fibrillar and basement membrane collagens and is also present at low levels in other collagen molecules such as type X collagen (34Bos K.J. Rucklidge G.J. Dunbar B. Robins S.P. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Currently, there is no structure available for a collagen peptide containing the triplet sequence Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp, and no structure of 3(S)Hyp has been determined in the context of a peptide or protein. We were interested in determining whether a peptide containing multiple 3(S)Hyp residues embedded in the Xaa positions could form a collagen triple helix or would, instead, form an altered conformation. To address this issue, we determined the crystal structure of the collagen-like peptide H-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)3-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)2-(Gly-Pro-4-(R)Hyp)4-OH. Surprisingly, our structure showed that this peptide forms a triple helix that conforms to 7/2 superhelix symmetry, similar to that of other collagen peptide-like structures. Moreover, the 3(S)Hyp residues in the Xaa position of our structure assumed a down pucker conformation essentially identical to that adopted by Pro residues in other structures with Pro-4(R)Hyp-Gly sequences (6Berisio R.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15812-15822Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The φ/ψ dihedral angles of the Gly, Xaa, and Yaa residues were also similar to those observed in other peptides. This suggests that, although the presence of the 3(S)Hyp in the Xaa position is slightly unfavorable for the stability, a collagen sequence containing such a modification can fold into a collagen triple helix with standard 7/2 superhelix symmetry.MATERIALS AND METHODSPeptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized with an ABI433A synthesizer. Couplings were carried out on an ABI344 synthesizer using H-O-t-butyl-l-trans-4-hydroxyproline-2-chlorotrityl resin (AnaSpec, Inc. San Jose, CA) and using Fmoc-amino acids (Fmoc-Gly-OH, Fmoc-3(S)Hyp, and Fmoc-4(R)Hyp(t-butyl)-OH). HATU (O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1, 3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (Perseptive Biosystems) (4.0 equivalents))/diisopropylethylamine mediated peptide couplings. The peptide was cleaved from the resin and purified by preparative high pressure liquid chromatography (Vydac® C18, 5 μm, 300 Å, 250 × 50 mm, W. R. Grace, Columbia, MD). All synthesized peptides were characterized by electrospray/quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-tof micro, Waters Associates) and amino acid analysis.Crystallization and Data Collection—The purified and lyophilized peptide H-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)3-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)2-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)4-OH was dissolved at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in water. The peptide was crystallized at 4 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. For crystallization, 2 μl of the peptide solution was mixed with 2 μl of the reservoir solution (25% of polyethylene glycol 4000). The crystals appeared as very thin plates in a period of 1-2 weeks. Data collection at the synchrotron enabled us to index the full cell of the crystals as monoclinic, space group P21, with a = 18.12, b = 19.45 Å, and c = 81.50 Å and β = 91.26°.For cryoprotection, glycerol was added to the drop to a final concentration of ∼20%, and the crystals were flash-frozen in a nitrogen cryostream. The crystals diffracted to beyond 2.0 Å resolution. However, the mosaic spreads observed for these crystals, even ones shot at room temperature, were extremely high (>2.5°), suggesting that this was an intrinsic property of the crystals. The best data were obtained using 20% glycerol as a cryoprotectant and collecting the x-ray intensity data in 0.5° wedges. Despite the small cell edges, data collection using wedges >0.5° resulted in severe overlap because of the high mosaic spread. Data were collected at the Advanced Light Source Beamline 8.2.1 at 100 K, processed with MOSFLM software, and scaled with SCALA software (35Collaborative Computational Project X Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19704) Google Scholar, 36Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCCP4 and ESF-EAMCB Newsletter Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar). The mosaic spread estimated for these data were ∼4.0°, and the resulting Rsym was very high (>15%). When weak and poorly measured data were removed (data with an I/σI < 2.0), the Rsym improved significantly but was still high (see Table 1). These were the best data that could be obtained and were thus used for structure determination and refinement. We believe the rather poor data readily explains the relatively high Rwork/Rfree, which given the resolution, would be expected to be lower (see below). However, extensive omit maps, including composite omit maps calculated throughout the refinement process, clearly reveal the goodness of the model (see below).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement parametersData collectionData collection siteALS BL 8.2.1Data collection temperature (K)100Resolution (Å)19.5-1.80Total reflections (No.)13,394Unique reflections (No.)5,300Overall Rsym (%)a∑∑|Ihkl - Ihkl(j)|∑Ihkl, where Ihkl(j) is observed intensity and Ihkl is the final average value of intensity.10.4 (39.2)bValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.Completeness (%)97.1 (94.1)Overall I/σ(I)5.5RefinementRwork/Rfree (%)c∑||Fobs| - |Fcalc||/∑|Fobs|, and Rfree = ∑||Fobs| - |Fcalc||/∑|Fobs|, where all reflections belong to a test set of 10% randomly selected data.

Vitagliano L. Mazzarella L. Zagari A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Only one clear solution was obtained, consistent with the presence of one H-(Gly-Pro-4-(R)Hyp)3-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)2-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)4-OH triple helix in the crystallographic asymmetric unit (ASU). The solution was optimized by rigid body refinement (38Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar). Multiple cycles of simulated annealing, xyzb refinement and rebuilding in O software resulted in an Rwork/Rfree of 29.7/32.8% to 1.80 Å resolution (38Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

Multiple omit maps were calculated throughout the refinement process to confirm the correctness of the model. Notably, electron density for the hydroxyl moieties were clearly observed for all 3(S)Hyp and 4(R)Hyp residues. The current model has excellent stereochemistry (40Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) (Table 1).Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Differential scanning calorimetry experiments were performed with a model CSC6100 Nano II differential scanning calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences Corp., Lindon, UT) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 135 mm NaCl. The scan rate was 0.5 K/min in all experiments. The calorimetric transition enthalpies were obtained by integration of the area under the excess heat capacity peaks, employing a sigmoidal base line to take the small heat capacity changes between the triple helical and unfolded state into account. To measure the heat capacity, a partial specific volume, 0.705 ml/g, was used for all peptides. Concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThermal Stability of the H-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)3-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)2-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)4-OH Peptide—The thermal stability of the peptide H-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)3-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4-(R)Hyp)2-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)4-OH was compared with the peptides H-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)9-OH and H-(Gly-Pro-4(R)-Hyp)4-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)4-OH using differential scanning calorimetry. At a scanning rate of 0.5 K/min, the transition midpoint temperature (Tm)of H-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)9-OH at a concentration of 2.7 mm was 52 °C. The Tm of H-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)4-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)4-OH at a concentration of 2.1 mm was also 52 °C, and for H-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)3-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)2-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)4-OH, a Tm of 51 °C was determined at a concentration of 1.6 mm. The Tm values of these three peptides were not significantly different. However, the transition enthalpies varied significantly. The ΔHo for H-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)9-OH (350 kJ/mol trimer) was significantly larger than that of H-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)4-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)-(Gly-Pro-4(R)-Hyp)4-OH (210 kJ/mol trimer) and H-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)3-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)2-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)4-OH (200 kJ/mol trimer) (Fig. 1). The decrease in ΔHo of the 3(S)Hyp-containing peptides is compensated by a decrease in the transition entropy; therefore, the Tm values are very similar. The decrease of the transition enthalpy could be due to weaker hydrogen bonds or differences in the unfolded state. Further studies will be required to determine the cause of these thermodynamic differences.Overall Structure of H-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)3-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)2-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)4-OH Peptide—The structure of the H-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)3-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)2-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)4-OH peptide was determined by molecular replacement (see “Materials and Methods”) and refined to an Rfree of 29.4% to 1.80 Å resolution (Table 1). The crystallographic ASU consists of one complete triple helix (Fig. 2). Density is weak for the triplet repeats at the N- and C-terminal ends of each chain, indicating higher flexibility of these residues. The current triple helical structure includes residues 3-27 of the A chain, 1-27 of the B chain, and 1-27 of the C chain. It also contains 152 water molecules. The packing of the triple helices in this structure appears to be pseudotetragonal (Fig. 3).FIGURE 2Overall structure of the H-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)3-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)2-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)4-OH peptide.

https://openalex.org/W2024970357,"We have recently identified ZNF185 as a gene that is downregulated in prostate cancer (PCa), in part via epigenetic alteration, and maybe associated with disease progression. In this study, we cloned the ZNF185 cDNA from normal human prostate tissues and investigated its biological function. We show that ZNF185 is a novel actin-cytoskeleton-associated Lin-l 1, Isl-1 and Mec-3 (LIM) domain-containing protein that localizes to F-actin structures, and is enriched at focal adhesions. We find that the NH(2)-terminal region, which we designate the actin-targeting domain, facilitates ZNF185 binding to actin in vitro and is both necessary and sufficient to mediate actin-cytoskeleton targeting of ZNF185, whereas the LIM domain, which is localized in the COOH-terminus is dispensable for this phenomenon. Interestingly, ectopic expression of full-length ZNF185, but not a mutant lacking the actin-targeting domain, could suppress proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of PCa cells. Together, our data suggest that ZNF185 may function as a tumor-suppressor protein by associating with the actin-cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2073371349,"Nucleic acid aptamers to HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) are potent inhibitors of DNA polymerase function in vitro, and they have been shown to inhibit viral replication when expressed in cultured T-lymphoid lines. We monitored RT inhibition by five RNA pseudoknot RNA aptamers in a series of biochemical assays designed to mimic discrete steps of viral reverse transcription. Our results demonstrate potent aptamer inhibition (IC50 values in the low nanomolar range) of all RT functions assayed, including RNA- and DNA-primed DNA polymerization, strand displacement synthesis, and polymerase-independent RNase H activity. Additionally, we observe differences in the time dependence of aptamer inhibition. Polymerase-independent RNase H activity is the most resistant to long term aptamer suppression, and RNA-dependent DNA polymerization is the most susceptible. Finally, when DNA polymerization was monitored in the presence of an RNA aptamer in combination with each of four different small molecule inhibitors, significant synergy was observed between the aptamer and the two nucleoside analog RT inhibitors (azidothymidine triphosphate or ddCTP), whereas two non-nucleoside analog RT inhibitors showed either weak synergy (efavirenz) or antagonism (nevirapine). Together, these results support a model wherein aptamers suppress viral replication by cumulative inhibition of RT at every stage of genome replication. Nucleic acid aptamers to HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) are potent inhibitors of DNA polymerase function in vitro, and they have been shown to inhibit viral replication when expressed in cultured T-lymphoid lines. We monitored RT inhibition by five RNA pseudoknot RNA aptamers in a series of biochemical assays designed to mimic discrete steps of viral reverse transcription. Our results demonstrate potent aptamer inhibition (IC50 values in the low nanomolar range) of all RT functions assayed, including RNA- and DNA-primed DNA polymerization, strand displacement synthesis, and polymerase-independent RNase H activity. Additionally, we observe differences in the time dependence of aptamer inhibition. Polymerase-independent RNase H activity is the most resistant to long term aptamer suppression, and RNA-dependent DNA polymerization is the most susceptible. Finally, when DNA polymerization was monitored in the presence of an RNA aptamer in combination with each of four different small molecule inhibitors, significant synergy was observed between the aptamer and the two nucleoside analog RT inhibitors (azidothymidine triphosphate or ddCTP), whereas two non-nucleoside analog RT inhibitors showed either weak synergy (efavirenz) or antagonism (nevirapine). Together, these results support a model wherein aptamers suppress viral replication by cumulative inhibition of RT at every stage of genome replication.

RT possesses both DNA- and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase functions, as well as RNase H activity to degrade the RNA strand in DNA/RNA heteroduplex replication intermediates. The enzyme is an asymmetric heterodimer composed of 66-kDa (p66) and 51-kDa (p51) subunits. The subunits associate initially as a p66 homodimer prior to removal of the C terminus of one of the two subunits by the viral protease (1Graves M.C. Meidel M.C. Pan Y.C. Manneberg M. Lahm H.W.

The catalytic sites for both polymerase and RNase H function reside in the large subunit, whereas the small subunit contributes to primer/template binding and provides structural support for the large subunit (3Jacobo-Molina A.

Its essential role in viral replication and the early availability of anti-RT drugs have made RT a featured target for clinical treatment of HIV infection. Eleven of the twenty FDA-approved anti-HIV compounds are RT inhibitors, which are themselves grouped into two classes, nucleoside analog RT inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside analog RT inhibitors (NNRTIs), based on their mode of action. The eight approved NRTIs are chain terminators that prevent the completion of viral genome replication following their incorporation by RT during DNA polymerization. The three NNRTIs, on the other hand, inhibit catalytic function directly by binding to RT near the polymerase active site and disrupting the local enzyme geometry (5Esnouf R. Ren J. Ross C. Jones Y. Stammers D. Stuart D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 6Spence R.A. Kati W.M. Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A.

BMJ. 2004; 328: 249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, drug toxicity, adherence issues, and the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains necessitate the continued search for novel classes of HIV inhibitory compounds. Nucleic acid aptamers are one such class of molecules to have demonstrated significant antiviral efficacy in recent years (10Joshi P.J. Fisher T.S. Prasad V.R. Curr. Drug Targets Infect. Disord. 2003; 3: 383-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Held D.M. Kissel J.D. Patterson J.T. Nickens D.G. Burke D.H. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 89-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). RNA and DNA aptamers generated by in vitro selections for binding to HIV-1 RT were first described as potent inhibitors of RT polymerase function over a decade ago (12Tuerk C. MacDougal S. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6988-6992Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 13Schneider D.J. Feigon J. Hostomsky Z. Gold L.

Subsequent biochemical probing (15Green L. Waugh S. Binkley J.P. Hostomska Z. Hostomsky Z. Tuerk C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and crystallographic studies (4Jaeger J. Restle T. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4535-4542Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) of a canonical RNA aptamer revealed a pseudoknot fold, which binds to the enzyme at a site overlapping that of the primer/template substrate binding cleft. Wohrl and colleagues (16Wohrl B.M. Krebs R. Goody R.S. Restle T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) used an RNA aptamer in a trap assay to block multiple turnover of single nucleotide incorporation by HIV-1 RT. Together, these observations led to introduction of the term “primer/template analog RT inhibitors” (TRTIs) to describe RT-inhibiting aptamers as a class (17Fisher T.S. Joshi P. Prasad V.R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4068-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).It is important to establish the molecular basis for the antiviral action of nucleic acid aptamers. The most potent RNA aptamers inhibit polymerase function in vitro with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range (12Tuerk C. MacDougal S. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6988-6992Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 14Burke D.H. Scates L. Andrews K. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 650-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and suppress viral replication when expressed in cultured lymphocytes (18Chaloin L. Lehmann M.J. Sczakiel G. Restle T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4001-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 19Joshi P. Prasad V.R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6545-6557Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Joshi P.J. North T.W. Prasad V.R. Mol. Ther. 2005; 11: 677-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PCR-based analysis of DNA extracted from aptamer-protected cells suggests that aptamers disrupt reverse transcription at one or more steps early in the process, as evidenced by the inability to detect viral genomic DNA beyond the formation of the minus strand strong stop product (19Joshi P. Prasad V.R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6545-6557Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether viral escape from aptamer inhibition in these early stages would allow full replication, or if instead subsequent steps are similarly sensitive.The process by which the HIV-1 RNA genome is copied to double-stranded DNA involves multiple steps requiring recognition of multiple nucleic acid substrates and performance of two distinct enzymatic activities by the viral RT (see Fig. 1A). Kinetic analyses of primer-template recognition by RT (21Lanchy J.M. Ehresmann C. Le Grice S.F. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7178-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22Thrall S.H. Krebs R. Wohrl B.M. Cellai L. Goody R.S. Restle T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13349-13358Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have clearly demonstrated that the enzyme performs DNA synthesis much more efficiently from DNA-primed templates than from RNA-primed templates. Because RNA aptamers are competitive inhibitors of primer/template substrate binding by the enzyme, we reasoned that nucleic acid substrate composition should directly affect the susceptibility of the enzyme to aptamer inhibition at different stages of genome replication. To better understand the point(s) at which RNA aptamers to RT most effectively inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcription, we performed a comprehensive biochemical analysis of RT inhibition by five RNA aptamers using in vitro assays that mimic various major steps of reverse transcription (see Fig. 1A). We demonstrate direct and potent inhibition of each RT function assayed, including RNase H activity. RNA-primed DNA polymerization is especially susceptible to aptamer inhibition to a degree not previously appreciated, as is distributive synthesis on both RNA and DNA templates. Our results suggest that the differential susceptibility of RT to aptamer inhibition is a direct function of primer-template backbone composition and enzymatic efficiency in accordance with previously established kinetic parameters. Furthermore, we propose that the multistep nature of HIV-1 reverse transcription enhances the susceptibility of RT to aptamer TRTIs because of the many binding and dissociation events required for completion of genome replication. Finally, we tested an aptamer in combination with two NNRTIs and two NRTIs and found that combinations that included the aptamer and an NRTI (AZTTP or ddCTP) display significant synergy for the inhibition of DNA polymerization by HIV-1 RT.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReverse Transcriptase Cloning, Expression, and Purification— DNA fragments encoding the large (p66) and small (p51) subunits of HIV-1 strain HXB2 reverse transcriptase were amplified by PCR from plasmid pHIV-gpt (23Page K.A. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5270-5276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagents Program (ARRRP)) and inserted into pET-200/D-TOPO expression vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21 Star™ (DE3) (Invitrogen). p66- and p51-expressing bacterial lines were grown separately in 500 ml of Luria Broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin in a shaking incubator at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2-3 h once the cells reached an A600 of 0.4-0.6. Cells were harvested, and pellets were stored at -80 °C for one to several days before purification. Frozen cell pellets containing expressed p66 and p51 subunits were thawed and resuspended together in a total of 40 ml of ice-cold 10 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 40 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 5% glycerol. The combined slurry was sonicated on ice to disrupt cell membranes and to release the soluble RT protein, and centrifuged 30 min at 14,000 rpm (Beckman JA-17 rotor) to pellet insoluble cell debris. Clarified lysate was passed over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen), washed with 150-200 ml of wash buffer (20 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 0.01% Triton X-100), and eluted with 10 ml of elution buffer (500 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4). Imidazole-eluted RT was further purified on a Sephadex G-100 Superfine gel-filtration column equilibrated with wash buffer, and the recovered RT was concentrated on a second nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column as described above. RT recovered from the second nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (6-8 ml) was dialyzed against a 1-liter solution of 400 mm NaCl, 32 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, and 0.016% Triton X-100 at 4 °C once overnight and again for 24 h with one change of buffer. Following dialysis, a 0.6 volume of 100% glycerol was added to the recovered sample to bring the final glycerol concentration to 50%. Enzyme aliquots were stored at -20 °C. Absorbance at 280 nm was used to determine the final protein concentration using a molar absorbance value of 263010 m-1 cm-1. This value corresponds to the recombinant heterodimer, including N-terminal fusion tags, and was calculated as described (24Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5022) Google Scholar), essentially by summing contributions to ϵ280 from tryptophan, tyrosine, and half cystine residues.RNA Aptamers—RNA aptamers 70.5, 70.8, 80.55, and 80.93 were previously identified by in vitro selection from random pools (14Burke D.H. Scates L. Andrews K. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 650-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). RNA for these four aptamers was generated by in vitro transcription from PCR templates using recombinant T7 RNA polymerase and purified on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. 70.5, 5′-gggaaaagguaagucauacacaagaUCCGAGGCAGAACGGGAAAAUCUGCGAAGUAACUGUGGAAUCCGUGACCUUUGACGUGAAAACCGCGAgggcauaagguauuuaauuccaua-3′; 70.8, 5′-gggaaaagguaagucauacacaagaCGAGACAAGUACCGAAAAAGAGAUCUGGCAGUGUCACAACCAGGAAAAAGACACGACGAACACGCCGCACgggcauaagguauuuaauuccaua-3′; 80.55, 5′-gggcauaagguauuaauuccauaAUGGCUCACCACAAGGGGAACGUUGAUGAAAUAGAGUUUAUCCCUUGGACUCACGCCGGCCGUGCUCCACACAAUCCAuugauucggaugcugccgguagcucaacucg-3′; and 80.93, 5′-gggcauaagguauuaauuccauaCCUCUCCACGACAAAUCCUUAUCGCAUGCAUGAGGGAGACCAGACAAGCAUGUACAAUCACCAAGUUAUGAUAGUUCGAGuugauucggaugcugccgguagcucaacucg-3′. Sequences derived from 70N or 80N primer binding sequences are shown in lowercase letters, and nucleotides of Stem I of the pseudoknots are underlined (see Fig. 1B). Aptamer T1.1 (5′-GGGAGAUUCCGUUUUCAGUCGGGAAAAACUGAA-3′) is derived from an earlier in vitro selection for RT aptamers (12Tuerk C. MacDougal S. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6988-6992Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The RNA sequence used here is identical to the variant used previously for co-crystallization with HIV-1 RT (4Jaeger J. Restle T. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4535-4542Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).General Methods for Assessing Aptamer Inhibition of Reverse Transcriptase Activities—For each of the assays described below, RT-incorporated Cy3-labeled dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) or 5′ Cy3-labeled DNA or RNA primers (Integrated DNA Technologies) were used to monitor RT enzymatic function. Each reaction was carried out in reaction buffer containing 75 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 ng/μl bovine serum albumin. Purified RT was used at a final concentration of 3 nm in all assays unless otherwise noted. Reaction times varied from three to 10 min depending on the rate of product formation in the absence of inhibitor; in general, reactions were allowed to proceed until maximum product formation was reached within the linear phase of the reaction (see Fig. 6A), because this allowed for a maximal dynamic range for assessing inhibition. Reactions were quenched at the specified time with two volumes of 95% formamide, 50 mm EDTA, and then heated for 2 min at 90 °C prior to electrophoresis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Gels were scanned for fluorescence using a Fujifilm FLA5000 imaging system, and RT activity data were collected using Fujifilm Multi Gauge V2.3 image analysis software. IC50 values for aptamer inhibition were obtained by fitting data to a sigmoidal dose-response curve with GraphPad Prism software using Equation 1,Y=100/(1+10logIC50-X)(Eq. 1) where Y is the measured fraction product formation at a given inhibitor concentration, and X is the log of the inhibitor concentration. All enzyme activity inhibition assays from which IC50 values were calculated were performed in triplicate. Data were also fit to the quadratic Equation 2 to better reflect the similar aptamer and RT stoichiometries of the inhibition reactions,Y=1-((A+B+Kd)-((A+B+Kd)2-4AB)1/2)/2B(Eq. 2) where Y is the measured fraction product formation at a given inhibitor concentration (A), and B is the RT concentration for the experiment. Curves fit using both of the above equations yielded 50% maximal inhibition (IC50) at identical locations on the X axis.FIGURE 6Aptamer potency over time. Product formation by HIV-1 RT was monitored for each of the reactions described above in the absence of aptamer (A), or in the presence of 10 nm (B), or 30 nm aptamer T1.1 (C). All assays were performed under the same conditions used to determine IC50 values (see “Experimental Procedures” for individual assay conditions). RT activity for each assay is normalized relative to product formation at 30 min for the no-aptamer control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DNA-primed DNA- and RNA-dependent DNA Polymerase Assays—An 18-nt DNA primer corresponding to the tRNA3Lys primer sequence (5′-Cy3-GTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCA-3′) was extended by a single nucleotide (ddCTP) on either a synthetic DNA or RNA 40-nt template corresponding to the HXB2 primer binding sequence (DNA version of the template: 5′-CAGTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGTGGCGCCCGAACAGGGAC-3′, nucleotides complementary to primer are underlined). Master mixes for 50 reactions were assembled by combining 30 nm primer, 45 nm template, and 0.02 mm ddCTP in reaction buffer, heated at 90 °C for 90 s, and cooled at room temperature for 10 min to anneal the primer/template. 5-μl aliquots were distributed into individual reaction tubes. 1 μl of serially diluted aptamer in reaction buffer was added to each reaction tube to yield final aptamer concentrations of 0, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, or 100 nm. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 4 μlofRT and incubated at 37 °C for 3 min. Reactions were quenched and analyzed as described above. In a head-to-head comparison, we observe identical rates of product formation for reactions with dCTP and ddCTP (supplemental Fig. S1B).RNA-primed RNA-dependent DNA Polymerase Assay— RNA-primed reactions from an RNA template were prepared and carried out essentially as the DNA-primed reactions except that dCTP (instead of ddCTP) was used at 5 mm, and the primer, template, and RT were used at 300, 450 and 30 nm, respectively, to account for the reduced affinity for RNA-primed complexes (22Thrall S.H. Krebs R. Wohrl B.M. Cellai L. Goody R.S. Restle T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13349-13358Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).RNA-primed DNA-dependent DNA Polymerase Assay—The 18-nt RNA primer (without Cy3 label) used in the RNA-primed RNA-dependent DNA polymerase assay was extended to completion on the 40-nt DNA template used in the DNA-primed DNA-dependent DNA polymerase assay. Reactions were assembled by mixing 300 nm primer, 450 nm template, 0.1 mm each of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and dCPT, and 0.02 mm Cy3-dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) in reaction buffer. Individual reaction aliquots (including aptamer) were prepared as described above. Reactions were quenched after 8 min at 37 °C, and full-length product formation was monitored according to incorporation of Cy3-labeled deoxycytidine.Distributive and Strand Displacement DNA Synthesis Assays—The 5′-Cy3-labeled 18-nt DNA primer used in the DNA-primed DNA polymerase assays described above was extended to completion on either a 103-nt DNA template corresponding to the HXB2 5′-long terminal repeat) U5 and primer binding sequences (5′-AAGTAGTGTGTGCCCGTCTGTTGTGTGACTCTGGTAACTAGAGATCCCTCAGACCCTTTTAGTCAGTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGTGGCGCCCGAACAGGGAC-3′) or a 106-nt RNA template of identical sequence (generated by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase) with three appended 5′-guanosines, which were added to the RNA sequence for efficient in vitro transcription. The DNA-dependent DNA polymerase assay was also performed in the presence of a 70-nt blocking DNA oligonucleotide (BO) (5′-CACACTGACTAAAAGGGTCTGAGGGATCTCTAGTTACCAGACTCACACAACAGACGGGCACACACTACTT-3′) complementary to the 5′ 70 nt of the template strand (underlined in sequence of template, above) to monitor strand displacement DNA synthesis. Reactions were assembled and initiated as described for the DNA-primed DNA polymerase assays above (0.02 mm dNTPs instead of ddCTP) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min before quenching and electrophoresis. Titration with varying concentrations of BO shows the 60 μm BO to be essentially saturating. DNA-dependent DNA polymerization in the absence of BO proceeded to completion more rapidly than did strand displacement; these assays were quenched after 3 min at 37 °C.Polymerase-independent RNase H Activity Assay—A 43-nt, fluorescently labeled RNA oligonucleotide corresponding to the 5′-end of the HXB2 RNA genome (5′-Cy3-GGUCUCUCUGGUUAGACCAGAUCUGAGCCUGGGAGCUCUCUGG-3′) was subjected to RNase H cleavage by RT when annealed to a DNA oligonucleotide complementary to the 5′ 53 nt of the HXB2 genomic RNA (5′-CCCTAGTTAGCCAGAGAGCTCCCAGGCTCAGATCTGGTCTAACCAGAGAGACC-3′). Reactions were assembled by mixing 30 nm RNA and 60 nm DNA complement in reaction buffer, and individual reaction aliquots (including aptamer) were prepared as described above. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 4μl of RT, incubated at 37 °C for 3 min, and quenched and analyzed as described for the above assays.Aptamer Inhibition Time Courses—A 30-min time course for each of the above RT activity assays was performed in the absence or presence (10 or 30 nm) of aptamer T1.1. All assays were prepared using the conditions described above but scaled up to an 80-μl final volume, from which 10-μl aliquots were removed and added to 20 μl of quench solution at the indicated time points. Data collection was performed for each assay as described above. Curves were fit with GraphPad Prism software using Equation 3,Y=Ymax(1-e-kt)(Eq. 3) where Y is product formation over time (t), which proceeds to a defined maximum (Ymax) with a rate constant (k).Aptamer/Small Molecule Synergy Assays—The 5′-Cy3-labeled 18-nt DNA primer described above was extended to completion on the 103-nt DNA template in the presence of increasing concentrations of nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV), azidothymidine triphosphate (AZTTP), or dideoxycytidine triphosphate (ddCTP) using the reaction conditions described above for distributive synthesis. Final RT concentration for these assays was increased from 3 to 10 nm to boost the signal. Inhibition was monitored using increasing concentrations of aptamer T1.1 in combination with the small molecule inhibitor at 100-fold excess (for NVP, AZTTP, or ddCTP) or 10-fold excess (EFV) over aptamer. IC50 values obtained from the combined aptamer/small molecule inhibition assays and from each individual inhibitor were inserted into the Berenbaum (25Berenbaum M.C. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1977; 28: 1-18PubMed Google Scholar) equation (Equation 4) to calculate an interaction index (I50) value,I50=D(1)/D50(1)+D(2)/D50(2)(Eq. 4) where D(1) and D(2) are the IC50 values for the two inhibitors when assayed in combination, and D50(1) and D50(2) are the IC50 values for each inhibitor when assayed individually.RESULTSRNA Aptamer Inhibition of Reverse Transcriptase at Discrete Steps of Viral Genome Replication—RT inhibition was measured in eight assays representative of discrete major functions performed by RT during viral genome replication (Fig. 1A). To ensure that comparisons of IC50 values across the eight assays are meaningful, and to avoid sequence-specific effects that might skew the analysis, all DNA polymerization experiments employed a primer sequence corresponding to the 3′ 18 nt of the host cell tRNA3Lys that primes viral genome replication during viral infection and a template sequence corresponding to the viral genome sequence immediately 5′ of the primer binding sequence (Fig. 1A). Likewise, all assays were performed using identical RT, primer-template, and dNTP concentrations (unless noted), and for similar lengths of time such that in each case product formation was confined to the linear phase. To ascertain the generality of the results, five different RNA aptamers (Fig. 1B) were tested individually for RT inhibition in each assay. Two aptamers (70.5 and T1.1) conform to the sequence constraints that define the Family 1 (Tuerk-type) pseudoknots, and the other three (70.8, 80.55, and 80.93) form related but structurally distinct pseudoknots (12Tuerk C.

Half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of single nucleotide incorporation by RT in DDDP-dp and RDDP-dp reactions occurs at low nanomolar concentrations (5-43 nm) for each of the five aptamers (Fig. 2, A and B, and Table 1), consistent with values obtained from earlier studies performed with this class of RNA pseudoknots (12Tuerk C.

https://openalex.org/W2135909066,"Vascular endothelial senescence is involved in human atherosclerosis. Telomerase activity is known to be critical in cellular senescence and its level is modulated by regulation of telomerase catalytic subunit (telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)) at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Since the cardioprotective effect of estrogen itself has not been ruled out, we examined that of raloxifene, which has been classified as a selective estrogen receptor modulator, on the proliferation and telomerase activity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Raloxifene, like estrogen, clearly induced the telomerase activity and human TERT (hTERT) expression via estrogen receptor (ER) α and ERβ. Treatment with raloxifene for 5 days significantly induced cell growth, and either cotreatment with a telomerase inhibitor, 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine, or transfection with hTERT-specific small interfering RNA significantly attenuated the raloxifene-induced cell growth. Raloxifene also induced the phosphorylation of Akt, and pretreatment with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, significantly attenuated the raloxifene-induced telomerase activity. In addition, raloxifene induced both the phosphorylation of hTERT and IκB. Moreover, cotreatment with an IκBα phosphorylation inhibitor, BAY-11–7082, or a specific NFκB nuclear translocation inhibitor, SN50, significantly attenuated the raloxifene-induced telomerase activity and the association of NFκB with hTERT. These results show that raloxifene induced the up-regulation of telomerase activity not only by the transcriptional regulation of hTERT but also by post-translational regulation of the phosphorylation of Akt and hTERT and the association of hTERT with NFκB in HUVECs. Thus, the up-regulation of telomerase activity in vascular endothelial cells might be one mechanism contributing to the potential atheroprotective effect of raloxifene.

The risk of cardiovascular disease steeply increases after menopause. Many epidemiological and basic studies have shown that estrogen has the significant function in the vasculature of preventing the primary development of cardiovascular disease in women (1Stampfer M.J.

Med. 1999; 340: 1801-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2509) Google Scholar). In the Women's Health Initiative, a large prospective randomized controlled study, although women on the conjugated equine estrogen-medroxyprogesterone acetate arm had an increase in the relative risk of cardiovascular events and breast cancer (3Writing Group for the Women's Health Initiative InvestigatorsJ. Am. Med. Assoc. 2002; 288: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (14017) Google Scholar), the more recent reports indicated that on women on the conjugated equine estrogenonly treatment arm experienced a significant increase in the risk of stroke compared with women treated with placebo but did not show an increase in cardiovascular disease (4Women's Health Initiative Steering CommitteeJ. Am. Med. Assoc. 2004; 291: 1701-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (4166) Google Scholar). Thus, the cardioprotective effect of estrogen itself has not been ruled out by the results of the Women's Health Initiative study. Recently, we reported that medroxyprogesterone acetate attenuates the induction of both endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) 2The abbreviations used are: eNOS, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; ER, estrogen receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; TERT, telomerase reverse transcriptase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TRAP, telomeric repeat amplification protocol; CSS, charcoal-stripped serum; RT, reverse transcription; E2, estradiol; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; KO, knock-out. activity and NO production by estrogen in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (5Oishi A.

Thus, it is possible that progestin has adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. Therefore, there is a need for an ideal estrogen analog that does not require the addition of progestin to protect the uterine endometrium. Raloxifene is a nonsteroidal benzothiophene that has been classified as a selective estrogen receptor modulator based on the fact that it exerts estrogen-agonistic effects on bone (6Delmas P.D. Bjarnason N.H. Mitlak B.H. Ravoux A.C. Shah A.S. Huster W.J. Draper M. Christiansen C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 1641-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar) and lipid metabolism (7Walsh B.W. Kuller L.H. Wild R.A. Paul S. Farmer M. Lawrence J.B. Shah A.S. J. Am. Med.

Assoc. 1999; 281: 2189-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar). However, its ability to protect against cardiovascular disease has yet to be proven. We demonstrated previously that the effects (and the mechanisms thereof) of raloxifene on vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells were similar to those of estrogen. For instance, in vascular endothelial cells, raloxifene induces eNOS phosphorylation, as estrogen does. Its effect is mediated by estrogen receptor (ER) α via a transcription-independent mechanism, a so-called nongenomic mechanism, and is differentially mediated by an Akt- and ERK-dependent cascade (9Hisamoto K. Ohmichi M. Kanda Y. Adachi K. Nishio Y. Hayakawa J. Mabuchi S. Takahashi K. Tasaka K. Miyamoto Y. Taniguchi N. Murata Y. J. Biol.

Fujiwara N. Taniguchi N. Murata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3459-3467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In vascular smooth muscle cells, raloxifene exerts an antiproliferative effect on cells treated with platelet-derived growth factor mediated by ERα, as estrogen does, in part via a transcription-dependent mechanism, a so-called genomic mechanism (11Takahashi K. Ohmichi M. Yoshida M. Hisamoto K. Mabuchi S. Arimoto-Ishida E. Mori A. Tsutsumi S. Tasaka K. Murata Y. Kurachi H. J. Endocrinol. 2003; 178: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and in part via a nongenomic mechanism (12Mori-Abe A. Tsutsumi S. Takahashi K. Toya M. Yoshida M. Du B. Kawagoe J. Nakahara K. Takahashi T. Ohmichi M. Kurachi H. J. Endocrinol. 2003; 178: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The incidence of atherosclerosis increases with age. Aging is associated with endothelial dysfunction. On a cellular level, aging leads to an irreversible state of cell cycle arrest known as senescence (13Goldstein S. Science. 1990; 249: 1129-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that an important factor in regulating cellular life span is the telomere length (14Buys C.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1282-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Telomerase, an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, catalyzes the addition of telomeric repeat sequences to chromosome ends and delays the development of senescence (14Buys C.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1282-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It was reported that telomerase inactivation precedes the aging of vascular endothelial cells (15Vasa M. Breitschopf K. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 540-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and cells with senescence-associated phenotypes are present in human atherosclerotic lesions (16Minamino T. Miyauchi H. Yoshida T. Ishida Y. Yoshida H. Komuro I. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1541-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), the catalytic subunit of telomerase, in endothelial cells was reported to cause resistance to the induction of apoptosis (17Yang J. Chang E. Cherry A.M. Bangs C.D. Oei Y. Bodnar A. Bronstein A. Chiu C.P. Herron G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26141-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Thus, endothelial cell senescence induced by telomere shortening may contribute to atherogenesis. We reported that raloxifene induces eNOS phosphorylation via the Akt cascade (9Hisamoto K. Ohmichi M. Kanda Y. Adachi K. Nishio Y. Hayakawa J. Mabuchi S. Takahashi K. Tasaka K. Miyamoto Y. Taniguchi N. Murata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47642-47649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). NO was reported to activate telomerase and delay endothelial cell senescence (15Vasa M. Breitschopf K. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 540-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In addition, it was reported that the region surrounding Ser-824 in hTERT conforms to a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by Akt and that Akt kinase enhances human telomerase activity through phosphorylation of hTERT (18Kang S.S. Kwon T. Kwon D.Y. Do S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13085-13090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). These considerations led us to examine whether raloxifene up-regulates telomerase activity and to attempt to clarify the molecular mechanism involved. In the present report, we show that raloxifene up-regulates telomerase activity not only by transcriptional regulation of hTERT but also by post-translational regulation of the phosphorylation of hTERT and the association of hTERT with NFκB. Materials—3′-Azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT) and LY294002 were obtained from Sigma. BAY-11–7082 and SN50 were obtained from Calbiochem. Anti-phospho-Akt substrate, anti-Akt, anti-phospho-Akt, anti-phospho-ERK, and anti-phospho-IκB antibody were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-hTERT, anti-NFκB antibody, scramble (control) siRNA, ERα siRNA, and ERβ siRNA were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). ICI 182780 was obtained from Tocris (Ballwin, MO). The cell titer 96-well proliferation assay kit was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay kit (TRAPeze) was obtained from Chemicon (Billerica, MA). Isolation of Endothelial Cells—Umbilical cords were obtained from term deliveries. The umbilical cord vein was filled with trypsin solution and incubated for 30 min to cause the release of endothelial cells. The detached endothelial cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and re-suspended in endothelial cell growth medium-2 (HUMEDIA EG-2) (Kurabo, Osaka, Japan) for cell culture. Cell Culture—Freshly isolated or commercially obtained (Kurabo) endothelial cells were grown in HUMEDIA EG-2, containing 2% fetal calf serum, hydrocortisone, hFGF-2, hVEGF, IGF-1, heparin, penicillin/streptomycin, and amphotericin B, as supplied by the manufacturer. Cells were cultured in 75-cm2 cell culture dishes (Falcon) or 6-well plates (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). There were no differences in ER expression patterns or estrogen responsiveness between freshly isolated and commercially available endothelial cells (data not shown). Unless otherwise indicated, experiments were performed on cells that had previously undergone three passages (i.e. 10 population doublings). To induce quiescence of human HUVECs by growth factor withdrawal, cultures were transferred 3 days after plating to a basal medium containing ascorbic acid, heparin, and serum-free or 1% charcoal-stripped serum (CSS) but lacking any other growth factor supplements and maintained under these conditions for 48 h. TRAP Assay—Endothelial cells were harvested by trypsinization and lysed at 4 °C in cell lysis buffer. Aliquots of the cleared lysate equivalent to 1.5 μg of protein were assayed for telomerase activity by a modified telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAPeze), which is based on the method originally described by Kim et al. (19Kim N.W. Wu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2595-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Telomerase activity was calculated from the ratio of the intensity of the telomeric repeat ladder (starting at 50 bp) to that of the 36-bp internal control. Results, expressed in arbitrary units, were normalized to the signal obtained from an extract of 500 HeLa cells routinely assayed in parallel. Telomerase activity is expressed quantitatively, which reflects a ratio of the TRAP product ladder bands to internal control band and calculated according to the formula supplied in the manufacture's manual, by using Image J Imaging System Software Version 1.3 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The reliability and linearity of total product generated as a measure of telomerase activity have been confirmed by other investigators (20Holt S.E. Norton J.C. Wright W.E. Shay W. Methods Cell Sci. 1996; 18: 237-248Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). siRNA Transfection—Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was synthesized by Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Cells in 2-ml aliquots were plated in a 6-well plate at a concentration expected to provide 30–40% confluence 24 h later. At that time, hTERT or scramble (control) siRNA was diluted with 200 μl of Opti-MEM (Sigma). Three micrograms of PolyMag (OZ Biosciences) were placed in a microtube. Three micrograms of the siRNA solution were added to the PolyMag solution and mixed immediately by vigorous pipetting. After 20 min of incubation, 200 μl of serum- and supplement-free Opti-MEM were added, and the solution was added to the cell culture plate. The cell culture plate was placed on a magnetic stirring plate for 20 min. The medium was changed to HUMEDIA EG-2, and the culturing was continued for 24 h. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cells were cultured in Medium 199 (Sigma) containing 1% CSS with vehicle or 10 nm raloxifene in the presence or absence of 100 nm AZT. The medium was changed every day throughout the culture period. The number of viable cells was counted by the trypan blue exclusion test at days 3 and 5 (5 wells in each group and for each time point). The cell condition and responsiveness are better when the cells are maintained in 1% serum than when they are starved for serum, as reported previously (21Kurz D.J. Hong Y. Trivier E. Huang H.L. Decary S. Zang G.H. Luscher T.F. Erusalimsky J.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 748-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, even when HUVECs were maintained with serum starvation, similar data were obtained. Cell Viability Assay—The growth of cells was arrested by incubation in phenol red-free Medium 199 containing 10% CSS for 48 h followed by culturing with serum-free phenol red-free Medium 199 containing 10% CSS with vehicle or 10 nm raloxifene for 3 days. The number of surviving cells was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 485 nm of the dissolved formazan product after addition of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxylmethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt for 3 h as described previously (22Hayakawa J. Ohmichi M. Kurachi H. Kanda Y. Hisamoto K. Nishio Y. Adachi K. Tasaka K. Kanzaki T. Murata Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5988-5994PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis of RNA—Total cellular RNA was isolated using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). The expression of hTERT mRNA and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR amplification as described previously (23Kyo S. Takakura M. Kanaya T. Zhuo W. Fujimoto K. Nishio Y. Orimo A. Inoue M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5917-5921PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hTERT mRNAs were amplified using the primer pair 5′-CGGAAGAGTGTCTGGAGCAA-3′ and 5′-GGATGAAGCGGAGTCTGGA-3′. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using a RNA PCR kit version 2 (TaKaRa, Osaka, Japan) with random primers. Serially diluted cDNA reverse-transcribed from 1 μg of RNA was first amplified by RT-PCR to generate standard curves. The correlation between the band intensity and dose of cDNA template was linear under the conditions described below. Typically, 2-μl aliquots of the reverse-transcribed cDNA were amplified by 28 cycles of PCR in 50 μl of 1× buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm KCl) containing 1 mm each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa), and each specific primer at 0.2 μm. Each cycle consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s. PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel. The efficiency of cDNA synthesis from each sample was estimated by PCR with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific primers as described previously (23Kyo S. Takakura M. Kanaya T. Zhuo W. Fujimoto K. Nishio Y. Orimo A. Inoue M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5917-5921PubMed Google Scholar). Animal Study—Female Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks, 180–200 g) were ovariectomized via dorsal approach. One week after the operation, ovariectomized rats were divided into three groups: vehicle, 17β-E2 and raloxifene. Ovariectomized rats were treated with 17β-E2 (0.1 mg/kg/day) or raloxifene (1.0 mg/kg/day) by subcutaneous injection for 7 days. Animals were killed by an overdose of pentobarbital after the designated treatment period. Aortas were removed and were opened longitudinally and endothelium scraped with a scalpel blade. Total RNA was extracted from endothelium using Tri-Reagent, and then we performed RT-PCR and PCR to detect the change of rat TERT (rTERT) expression. The primers used in this study were as follows: rTERT forward primer, 5′-CAGGGTAAGCTGGTGGA-3′; rTERT reverse primer, 5′-GCAGGAAGTGCAGGAAG-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) forward primer, 5′-GTGATGGGTGTGAACCACGAG-3′; and GAPDH reverse primer, 5′-CAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAGCT-3′. The minimum of three animals was included in each group. Western Blot Analysis—The cells were incubated in phenol red-free medium without serum for 16 h and then treated with various agents. They were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and the protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blocking was done in 10% bovine serum albumin in 1× Tris-buffered saline. Western blot analyses were performed with various specific primary antibodies. For detection of phosphorylated hTERT or detection of the association of hTERT with NFκB p65, cell lysates were prepared using HNTG buffer. The lysates were incubated with anti-hTERT antibody overnight and then immunoprecipitated for 2 h with protein G-Sepharose. Immune complexes were washed with ice-cold HNTG buffer, electrophoresed, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Akt substrate or anti-NFκB p65 antibody. Immunoreacted bands in the immunoblots were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse immunoglobulin by using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting system. Statistics—Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Raloxifene Induces Endothelial Cell Proliferation via the Regulation of Telomerase Activity and hTERT Expression—We first examined whether raloxifene regulates the proliferation of HUVECs. The number of cells was significantly increased by incubation with 10 nm raloxifene (Fig. 1A). We then treated HUVECs with 10 nm raloxifene in the presence of AZT, an inhibitor of reverse transcriptase (24Kondo S. Tanaka Y. Kondo Y. Hitomi M. Barnett G.H. Ishizaka Y. Liu J. Haqqi T.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3876-3882PubMed Google Scholar), to test whether telomerase activity was involved in the induction of endothelial cell proliferation by raloxifene. Although AZT alone did not affect the cell proliferation, AZT significantly inhibited the induction of proliferation by raloxifene (Fig. 1A). Next, to examine whether raloxifene or estrogen induced the telomerase activity, HUVECs were treated with 10 nm raloxifene or 10 nm estrogen for 24 h and subjected to quantitative TRAP assays to assess the telomerase activity. Treatment with either raloxifene or estrogen significantly increased the telomerase activity (Fig. 1B). Moreover, we used hTERT-specific (hTERT) siRNA to examine whether the transcriptional activation of hTERT was involved in the induction of endothelial cell proliferation by raloxifene. We confirmed that the expression of hTERT in HUVECs transfected with hTERT siRNA was significantly lower than that in HUVECs transfected with scramble siRNA (Fig. 1C). Whereas transfection with scramble siRNA had no effect on the induction of cell proliferation by raloxifene, transfection with hTERT siRNA significantly inhibited the induction of cell proliferation by raloxifene (Fig. 1D). Raloxifene Induces Telomerase Activity via ERα and ERβ— We next examined whether the ER is involved in the raloxifene-induced telomerase activation. HUVECs were treated with 10 nm raloxifene in the presence or absence of ICI 182780 and subjected to quantitative TRAP assays to assess the telomerase activity. Treatment with ICI 182780 clearly attenuated the raloxifene-induced telomerase activation, suggesting that the ER is involved in the induction of telomerase activity by raloxifene (Fig. 2A). Next we examined which subtype of ER is involved in the raloxifene-induced telomerase activation. HUVECs express both ERα and ERβ (Fig. 2B, lane 1). We confirmed that the expression of ERα and ERβ in HUVECs transfected with ERα-specific (ERα) siRNA and ERβ-specific (ERβ) siRNA were significantly lower than that in HUVECs transfected with scramble siRNA (Fig. 2B). Moreover, transfection with either ERα siRNA or ERβ siRNA significantly reduced the E2 induced ERE-tk109-luc (ERE-tk-luc) reporter activity (28Mabuchi S. Ohmichi M. Kimura A. Ikebuchi Y. Hisamoto K. Arimoto-Ishida E. Nishio Y. Takahashi K. Tasaka K. Murata Y. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1302-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting that these constructs blocked the functional estrogen receptors (data not shown). Raloxifene-induced telomerase activity was attenuated by transfection with ERα siRNA or ERβ siRNA (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that both ERα and ERβ are involved in the induction of telomerase activity by raloxifene. Raloxifene Induces hTERT mRNA Expression in Endothelial Cells and in Vivo—Semiquantitative RT-PCR assays were performed to examine whether or not the raloxifene-induced increase in the telomerase activity was due to an increase in the expression of hTERT mRNA. Treatment of HUVECs with 10 nm raloxifene or 10 nm estrogen for 24 h increased the amount of hTERT mRNA (Fig. 3A). Moreover, raloxifene as well as estrogen upregurated the expression of rTERT mRNA in endothelium of ovariectomized rat (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the up-regulation of telomerase activity by raloxifene and estrogen was, at least in part, due to an increase in the expression of hTERT mRNA. Raloxifene Induces Telomerase Activity via the PI3K/Akt Cascade—Telomerase activity may also be regulated by post-translational modifications of the enzyme. It has been reported that the region surrounding Ser-824 in hTERT conforms to a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by Akt and that Akt kinase enhances human telomerase activity through the phosphorylation of hTERT (18Kang S.S. Kwon T. Kwon D.Y. Do S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13085-13090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined whether raloxifene induces the phosphorylation of Akt. Cells were treated with 10 nm raloxifene for various times, and the cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then subjected to Western blotting with anti-phospho-Akt or anti-Akt antibody. Although raloxifene did not affect the total amount of Akt (Fig. 4A, bottom panel), it induced transient phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 4A, top and middle panels), with a maximum effect at 30 min. Next, we examined whether raloxifene induces the phosphorylation of hTERT at the putative Akt phosphorylation site. For this, cells were treated with 10 nm raloxifene for the indicated times and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-hTERT antibody and then subjected to Western blotting with anti-phospho-Akt substrate antibody (Fig. 4B). Although raloxifene did not affect the expression of α-tubulin (Fig. 4B, lower panel), the increase by raloxifene of the phosphorylation of hTERT at the putative Akt phosphorylation site reached a peak at 30 min and declined thereafter (Fig. 4B, top and middle panels). To examine whether the PI3K/Akt cascade is involved in the raloxifene- and estrogen-induced telomerase activation, HUVECs were treated with 10 nm raloxifene or 10 nm estrogen in the presence or absence of LY294002 and subjected to quantitative TRAP assays to assess the telomerase activity. LY294002 clearly attenuated both the raloxifene- and estrogen-induced telomerase activation (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the PI3K/Akt cascade is involved in the induction of telomerase activity by raloxifene and estrogen. Raloxifene Induces Telomerase Activity by Increasing the Association of NFκB with hTERT—It has been reported that IGF-1 and IL-6 activate telomerase activity via PI3K/Akt/NFκB in a human multiple myeloma cell line (27Akiyama M. Hideshima T. Hayashi T. Tai Y.T. Mitsiades C.S. Mitsiades N. Chauhan D. Richardson P. Munshi N.C. Anderson K.C. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3876-3882PubMed Google Scholar), and NFκB was reported to be a post-translational modifier of telomerase that functions by controlling the intracellular localization of hTERT (29Akiyama M. Hideshima T. Hayashi T. Tai Y.T. Mitsiades C.S. Mitsiades N. Chauhan D. Richardson P. Munshi N.C. Anderson K.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 18-21PubMed Google Scholar). NFκB is regulated through its association with an inhibitory cofactor, IκB, which sequesters NFκB in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of IκB by upstream kinases promotes its degradation, allowing NFκB to translocate to the nucleus with hTERT (30Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, hemicentin is secreted from muscle and gonadal leader cells and assembles at multiple locations into discrete tracks that constrict broad regions of cell contact into adhesive and flexible line-shaped junctions.

ECM networks act as scaffolds for cell adhesion and migration and direct assembly of the cytoskeleton. Network geometry varies from tissue to tissue and is determined by the availability of ECM components in addition to the mechanism of their assembly. Several common themes have emerged in the assembly of ECM molecules like collagens, laminins, and fibronectins (1Schwarzbauer J.E. Sechler J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 2Wierzbicka-Patynowski I. Schwarzbauer J.E. J.

ECM molecules can be assembled into polymers inside the cell and activated before or after secretion as a result of proteolytic processing or interaction with cell surface receptors. Activation changes the structure of specific domains and results in increased homophilic interactions or heterophilic interactions with other ECM proteins as molecules assemble into higher order structures. Hemicentins are a family of secreted ECM proteins first identified in Caenorhabditis elegans with two orthologs in most vertebrate genomes including human and mouse (6Vogel B.E. Hedgecock E.M. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 883-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hemicentins are characterized by a single highly conserved von Willebrand A (VWA) domain near the amino terminus, followed by a long stretch (>40) of tandem immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, multiple tandem epidermal growth factors (EGFs), and a single fibulin-like carboxyl-terminal (FC) domain (6Vogel B.E. Hedgecock E.M. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 883-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol.

In C. elegans, hemicentin is secreted by bodywall muscle and gonadal leader cells and assembles at multiple distant locations, where it forms an oriented track-like geometry whose apparent function is to constrict broad regions of cell contact into discrete line-shaped junctions (6Vogel B.E. Hedgecock E.M. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 883-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is nothing known about the mechanism of hemicentin recruitment to cell surfaces or about its assembly there. Hemicentin tracks anchor mechanosensory neuron and uterine cells at hemidesmosome-mediated attachments and are required for cellularization of germ cells and migration of somatic male gonadal cells (6Vogel B.E. Hedgecock E.M. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 883-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hemicentin expression by the proximal gonadal cell in hermaphrodites (i.e. the anchor cell) is controlled by the fos-1 transcription factor, and accumulation of hemicentin on the anchor cell surface promotes anchor cell invasion into vulval epithelium to form a functional connection between the uterus and vulva (9Sherwood D.R. Butler J.A. Kramer J.M. Sternberg P.W. Cell. 2005; 121: 951-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To understand the role of individual hemicentin structural domains in hemicentin function and assembly, we have expressed hemicentin and hemicentin fragments as green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged fusion proteins in C. elegans and present data that suggest the function of the VWA domain is to target hemicentin to sites of assembly. The carboxyl-terminal EGF/FC domain contains a motif sufficient to bind existing hemicentin polymers in wild-type animals, suggesting that this is likely to constitute an assembly domain. Based on this data we suggest a multistep model for hemicentin assembly similar to that of other extracellular matrix components, involving cell binding, activation, and propagation (1Schwarzbauer J.E. Sechler J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Deletion Constructs—Deletion constructs were made using AvrII, KpnI, BamHI, NotI, and ApaI restriction sites to linearize a full-length GFP::hemicentin gene (6Vogel B.E. Hedgecock E.M. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 883-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), SOE-PCR to splice together fragments from different regions of the hemicentin gene (10Horton R.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 1995; 3: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and homologous recombination in Escherichia coli to combine overlapping linear DNA fragments into a circular construct expressing ampicillin resistance (11Chartier C. Degryse E. Gantzer M. Dieterle A. Pavirani A. Mehtali M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4805-4810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constructs were microinjected at a concentration of 10 mg/ml with pRF4 (plasmid containing a rol-6 dominant mutation) at 100 mg/ml into wild-type C. elegans, and wild-type males were used to mate the transgenes into him-4 (rh319) or him-4 (hd99) mutant animals. The him-4 (hd99) allele contains a deletion of 1156 bp, which removes F15G9::12,861–14,017, nucleotides encoding the hemicentin initiator methionine, signal sequence, and 611 bp of 5′-regulatory sequence. him-4 (rh319) has been described previously (6Vogel B.E. Hedgecock E.M. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 883-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescent images were collected with an LSM 410 confocal microscope (Zeiss). Custom Antibodies—A cDNA fragment encoding hemicentin amino acids 1–433 was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR and cloned into the pET-41 EK/LIC expression vector (Novagen). The clones were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. at 25 °C. The GST fusion protein was purified with GST-binding resin (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polyclonal antisera were produced in rabbits immunized with hemicentin::GST fusion protein by Proteintech (Chicago, IL). Western Blots—Worms were collected from a 60-mm plate in M9 buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. After electrophoresis through (3–8%) NuPAGE-Tris acetate gels (Invitrogen), proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20) (pH 7.4) and incubated with rabbit primary anti-GFP antibodies (Molecular Probes) followed by a polyclonal goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce). After washing, bound antibody was detected by Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Full-length C. elegans hemicentin comprises 5198 amino acids and contains a VWA domain followed by 48 tandem Ig modules, 3 EGF modules, and a FC module. To test the function of these domains in hemicentin assembly, we designed several hemicentin based constructs with various domains deleted or mutated (Fig. 1) and introduced them into hemicentin containing wild-type animals and hemicentin-deficient (him-4(rh319)) mutant animals. Each construct contains a signal sequence followed by GFP and is under the control of endogenous him-4 5′-regulatory sequences (F15G9 8056–13,471) with the exception of unc-54::1–433, which is under the control of the muscle-specific unc-54 promoter (13Okkema P.G. Harrison S.W. Plunger V. Aryana A. Fire A. Genetics. 1993; 135: 385-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constructs 1–433, unc-54::1–433 and D42A contain nucleotides encoding the initiator methionine up to but not including the first Ig module. Construct 1–1492 includes nucleotide sequences from the initiator methionine to Ig11. Construct 434–5198 includes all hemicentin sequence encoding Ig1 onward. Construct 1–4837 is missing the sequence that encodes amino acids following the last Ig (Ig48) and 4838–5198 contains only sequence encoding amino acids that follow Ig48 (Fig. 1). Expression of each of these constructs is detected by Western blot with anti-GFP antibodies and observed sizes match predicted sizes (Fig. 2). The observed size of full-length hemicentin::GFP matches the predicted molecular weight based on amino acid sequence of ∼600 kDa, suggesting that the most abundant form of hemicentin present in wild-type animals is a full-length monomer that does not appear subject to either extensive proteolysis or post-translational modification. As shown previously, hemicentin can assemble into fine, regularly spaced tracks that pivot and flex during foraging. These tracks are not associated with cell surfaces other than at attachment points at the pharyngeal basement membrane at one end and between lateral and medial bodywall muscle cells at the other end (6Vogel B.E. Hedgecock E.M. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 883-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length GFP::hemicentin can assemble into tracks in the presence or absence of endogenous hemicentin (Fig. 3; Ref. 6Vogel B.E. Hedgecock E.M. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 883-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When we expressed constructs 434–5198 and 4838–5198 we found that these constructs are sufficient to bind to existing hemicentin tracks found in wild-type animals but cannot assemble into tracks in him-4 (rh319) mutant animals that lack endogenous hemicentin (Fig. 3, B, C, E, and F). Constructs 1–433 and 1–1492 lack this region and are not able to bind to existing hemicentin tracks in wild-type animals or form tracks on their own in a him-4 (rh319) mutant background (Fig. 3, D and G). A larger hemicentin construct that is missing only this region (1–4837) retains the ability to bind to tracks in a wild-type background but cannot assemble into tracks in the absence of existing hemicentin (Fig. 3, H and I), indicating that the sequences 4838–5198 are sufficient, but not necessary, for hemicentin track binding activity. Constructs that subdivided this region by expressing the EGF and FC modules individually as GFP fusion proteins were also tested but these did not localize to specific structures and instead were found in the fluid of the pseudocoelomic (body) cavity (not shown). Interestingly, the localization of constructs to hemicentin tracks was most striking in younger animals (L2–L3 larvae) and decreased in older animals. The expression of all constructs in wild-type animals did not result in detectable dominant negative phenotypes. Although constructs located near the amino-terminal were not able to bind to hemicentin tracks (Fig. 3, D and G), we observed that they did have the ability to bind to cell surfaces where hemicentin tracks normally assemble in wild-type animals including mechanosensory neurons, uterine attachments, and germ cell surfaces (Fig. 4). This was true for constructs containing the first 1492 amino acids (Fig. 4, J–L) as well as constructs limited to the first 433 amino acids of hemicentin (Fig. 4, D–F). Even in hemicentin mutant (him-4 (rh319) and him-4 (hd99)) backgrounds, the first 433 amino acids were still able to bind to uterine attachments and germ cell surfaces (Fig. 4, H and I) suggesting that these hemicentin fragments were not binding to endogenous hemicentin but binding directly to cell surface molecules or extracellular molecules associated with those cell surfaces. 1–433 and 1–1492 constructs were expressed under control of endogenous him-4 5′-regulatory sequences and under the control of the muscle-specific unc-54 promoter to determine whether the accumulation of 1–433 on mechanosensory neurons, uterine attachments and germ cell surfaces was the result of targeting of secreted hemicentin from muscle cells or low levels of expression in those tissues. We found that accumulation of the 1–433 construct on these tissues was still strong even under the muscle-specific unc-54 promoter (Fig. 4, M–O). To determine whether the VWA motif or other sequences within hemicentin 1–433 were important for cell surface localization, we introduced a mutation in the conserved metal ion-dependent adhesion site (14Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The conserved sequence DXTXS was mutated by substituting an alanine codon for the aspartate codon. When expressed in transgenic animals, the ability of this construct (D42A) to bind cell surfaces was dramatically reduced (cf Fig. 4, D–F and P–R), although similar protein levels were detected in both strains (Fig. 2). Because the first 433 amino acids of hemicentin seemed to be sufficient for targeting to cell surfaces, we deleted this domain to determine whether this domain was necessary for hemicentin targeting. We found that a construct without the VWA domain (434–5198) retained the ability to target cell surfaces in the presence or absence of endogenous hemicentin, suggesting the presence of an additional cell binding domain in hemicentin (Fig. 4, S–U). Extracellular matrix proteins assemble into networks with a variety of geometries that provide structural and regulatory information to cells to pattern tissue histogenesis and morphogenesis. In C. elegans, hemicentin assembles into discrete tracks that contract broad regions of cell contact into discrete line-shaped junctions. To understand the mechanism of hemicentin assembly, we expressed fragments of hemicentin as GFP fusion proteins in wild-type and hemicentin-deficient animals. Below, we discuss our findings and present a model for the assembly of hemicentin that incorporates this data. The EGF/FC Modules Constitute an Assembly Domain of Hemicentin—A construct containing GFP fused to the EGF/FC modules of hemicentin (4838–5198) binds to hemicentin containing structures that are present in wild-type animals (Fig. 3). Hemicentin is found in flexible structures that extend from bodywall muscle cell surfaces to the pharynx basement membrane and is not associated with cell surfaces other than at these attachment sites. Because hemicentin and fibulin are the only proteins that have been identified in these structures (15Muriel J.M. Dong C. Hutter H. Vogel B.E. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 4223-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), this observation raises the possibility that one function of the EGF/FC modules are to mediate direct hemicentin-hemicentin or hemicentin-fibulin interaction. Even with the EGF/FC modules missing, other hemicentin-hemicentin binding sites are still present that can bind to EGF/FC modules present in endogenous hemicentin molecules that are found in the flexible tracks of wild-type animals. It is not surprising for an extracellular matrix molecule to have multiple self-assembly domains, because a minimum of two self-assembly domains are required for assembly into a polymer larger than a dimer. Fibronectin, for example, assembles into large, complex fibrillar structures and has at least four self-assembly domains (2Wierzbicka-Patynowski I. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3269-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We speculate that the large number of Ig domains found in hemicentin reflect not only homophilic interactions but interactions with other binding partners. The Ig domains in perlecan, for example, are known to be involved in direct protein-protein interactions with multiple partners including nidogen and fibulin-2 (16Hopf M. Gohring W. Mann K. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the combination of EGF and FC modules seems to form a single functional unit, because we could not subdivide this region into smaller functional domains. This combination is also found in the two vertebrate hemicentins as well as all five fibulin family members (8Argraves W.S. Greene L.M. Cooley M.A. Gallagher W.M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). This striking similarity has resulted in occasional reference to human hemicentin-1 as fibulin-6. A C. elegans fibulin-1 ortholog co-assembles with hemicentin on mechanosensory neurons, uterine attachments, and flexible tracks (15Muriel J.M. Dong C. Hutter H. Vogel B.E. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 4223-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that like hemicentin, fibulin uses the EGF/FC modules to interact directly with hemicentin as the 2 molecules co-assemble at these sites. A mutation in the last EGF of human hemicentin-1 was found linked to the disease phenotype in a familial case of agerelated macular degeneration (17Schultz D.W. Klein M.L. Humpert A.J. Luzier C.W. Persun V. Schain M. Mahan A. Runckel C. Cassera M. Vittal V. Doyle T.M. Weleber R.G. Francis P.J. Acott T.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3315-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Based on data presented here, we suggest that the effect of this dominant mutation is likely to interfere with the hemicentin assembly process. The VWA Domain of Hemicentin Is a Cell-targeting Domain—VWA domains are known to be frequently involved in mediating divalent cation-dependent interactions between proteins assembled into multiprotein complexes. A VWA domain containing fragment of hemicentin (1–433) targets to uterine attachments and germ cell surfaces in the presence or absence of endogenous hemicentin (Fig. 4). Targeting occurs when 1–433 is expressed under the control of endogenous hemicentin regulatory sequences or when expressed under the control of the muscle-specific unc-54 promoter. It is likely that this is a key domain in targeting hemicentin to different sites of assembly and that hemicentin binds to cell surface receptors or other extracellular matrix protein found at assembly sites. The binding is likely to be dependent on divalent cations because the cell-targeting activity of 1–433 is dramatically reduced when a point mutation is introduced into the highly conserved divalent cation binding sequences of the VWA domain metal-ion dependent adhesion site. Structurally, the VWA domain is the most highly conserved region of hemicentin. This raises the possibility that the VWA domain has a similar function, that of targeting hemicentins to cell surfaces in vertebrate organisms as well. Another molecule, G7c or NG37, has been identified in vertebrate genomes that has a VWA motif very similar to the VWA found in hemicentins (6Vogel B.E. Hedgecock E.M. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 883-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3369-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 18Kumanovics A. Lindahl K.F. Immunogenetics. 2001; 53: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and may indicate that this domain targets the secreted G7c/NG37 molecule to hemicentin binding cell surfaces as well. The observation that a hemicentin construct where amino acids 1–433 have been deleted still binds to uterine attachments and germ cell surfaces even in the absence of endogenous hemicentin suggests the possibility of a second cell binding site located elsewhere in the molecule. This is not unexpected for a large extracellular matrix molecule, many of which have multiple cell binding domains. Fibronectin, for example, has multiple cell binding sites that bind to distinct members of the integrin family of adhesion receptors (1Schwarzbauer J.E. Sechler J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Model for Hemicentin Assembly—We have summarized the results and incorporated these observations into a model of hemicentin assembly (Fig. 5). Step 1 (secretion): in C. elegans, hemicentin is secreted from muscle and gonadal leader cells. Potential intramolecular interactions between the carboxyl-terminal EGF/FC modules and other domains within hemicentin may result in newly secreted hemicentin forming compact “blocked” structures where the EGF/FC modules are sequestered, preventing hemicentin assembly in ectopic locations. Steps 2 (nucleation) and 3 (activation): the blocked molecule encounters a cell surface or ECM molecule that binds to the VWA and/or sites in the Ig domain, causing the monomer to unfold, exposing homophilic binding sites in the carboxyl-terminal EGF/FC modules and elsewhere in the molecule. Step 4 (propagation): additional hemicentin molecules are added to the nascent structure as carboxyl-terminal EGF/FC modules bind to homophilic binding sites. At this point, we cannot determine whether additional hemicentin molecules are added in a parallel or anti-parallel orientation. The next step in the assembly of hemicentin is likely to involve direct interactions with other hemicentin molecules and possibly other ECM components (Step 5). An obvious candidate to interact with hemicentin is fibulin, which, as mentioned above, also contains EGF/FC motifs and has been shown recently to co-assemble with hemicentin in flexible tracks and hemidesmosome-mediated uterine and mechanosensory neuron attachments (15Muriel J.M. Dong C. Hutter H. Vogel B.E. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 4223-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. Xuehong Xu for valuable help and advice and Dr. A.

https://openalex.org/W2010109196,"The transcriptional ETS2 repressor factor (ERF) is phosphorylated by Erks both in vivo and in vitro. This phosphorylation determines the subcellular localization and biological function of ERF. Here, we show that active and inactive Erk2 proteins bind ERF with high affinity through a hydrophobic pocket formed by the αF and αG helices and the activation loop of Erk2. We have identified two FXF motifs on ERF that mediate the specific interaction with Erks. One of these motifs is utilized only by active Erks, whereas the other mediates the association with inactive Erks but also contributes to interaction with active Erks. Mutation of the phenylalanines of these motifs to alanines resulted in decreased association and phosphorylation of ERF by Erks both in cells and in vitro. ERF proteins carrying these mutations exhibited increased nuclear accumulation and increased inhibition of cellular proliferation. Expression of ERF regions harboring these motifs could inhibit Erk activity in cells. Our data suggest that, in the proper context, FXF motifs can mediate a strong and specific interaction not only with active but also inactive Erks and that these interactions determine protein function in vivo.

Athanasiou M.A. Beal Jr., G.J. Fisher R.J. Blair D.G. Mavrothalassitis G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4781-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that ERF interacts with and is phosphorylated by Erks in vitro and in vivo on multiple sites (2Le Gallic L. Sgouras D. Beal Jr., G. Mavrothalassitis G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4121-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation determines its subcellular localization. In serum-starved cells, ERF is not phosphorylated and located within the nucleus. Upon serum induction, ERF is phosphorylated and exported into the cytoplasm. The absolute correlation between Erk activity and ERF phosphorylation and cytoplasmic location is reinforced by the sensitivity of ERF localization and phosphorylation to specific MEK inhibitors. Phosphorylation-deficient ERF proteins with phosphorylation sites mutated to alanine localize in the nucleus, arrest fibroblasts at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle in a retinoblastoma-dependent manner, and can suppress ras-induced tumorigenicity. This indicates that ERF is a bona fide effector of ras, mediating cell cycle progression-specific signals (2Le Gallic L. Sgouras D. Beal Jr., G. Mavrothalassitis G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4121-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated ERF shuttles continuously between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In fibroblasts, both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of ERF occur in the nucleus. Whereas ERF nuclear import does not appear to be affected by phosphorylation, ERF nuclear export is dependent on extensive Erk phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of ERF and its export from the nucleus closely follow the appearance of active Erk in the nucleus and may serve as a continuous monitor of Erk-mediated receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Thus, ERF appears to be a very sensitive monitor of Erk activity that can affect cell cycle progression, providing another link between the Ras/Erk pathway and this fundamental cellular process (3Le Gallic L. Virgilio L. Cohen P. Biteau B. Mavrothalassitis G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1206-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The region of ERF required for its specific interaction with Erks has been narrowed to the central part of the protein (amino acids 316-416) (2Le Gallic L. Sgouras D. Beal Jr., G. Mavrothalassitis G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4121-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The MAPK family of serine/threonine protein kinases is a major kinase family involved in multiple cellular processes and thus is a major target for therapeutic intervention. There is a plethora of cellular targets reported to be phosphorylated by one or more members of this kinase family. Given the homology among MAPKs and the number of proteins reported to be phosphorylated by these kinases, there is considerable interest and effort in understanding the specific structural requirements for the kinase-substrate interaction that determine the specificity of a kinase for a given protein (4Pawson T. Nash P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047PubMed Google Scholar, 5Biondi R.M. Nebreda A.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Kinases interact directly with their substrates or indirectly through scaffold proteins, forming tight complexes. These interactions involve specific sequences on the substrates known as docking sites (6Holland P.M. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R329-R331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These docking sites are thought to favor substrate phosphorylation by increasing the local concentration of the kinase. The first docking motif that was identified was the c-Jun δ-domain (7Kallunki T. Su B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Moore G. Davis R. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Similar to the δ-domain, D-domains were also identified in a number of transcription factors that are regulated by ERK, JNK, and/or p38 MAPKs (for review, see Refs. 8Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.H. Galanis A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar and 9Tanoue T. Nishida E. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). They are characterized by the presence of an LXL motif adjacent to a basic region. In some instances, the LXL motif is replaced by a hydrophobic amino acid triplet. The pointed domain found in other ETS domain proteins also contains a characteristic LXL motif adjacent to a conserved phenylalanine (10Seidel J.J. Graves B.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Another MAPK docking motif is the FXF motif first identified in the ETS domain protein LIN1 (11Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), which appears to be conserved in a number of MAPK substrates. The FXF motif is thought to be Erk-specific, although it was also found to contribute to the phosphorylation of Sap1 by p38α (12Galanis A. Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 965-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Finally, there is a characteristic acidic amino acid region in MAPKs (the CD-domain) that interacts with a basic region on the associated protein (13Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). MAPK substrates often contain more than one docking motif, often of a different kind, forming a modular docking system (12Galanis A. Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 965-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This system is believed to determine both kinase specificity and phosphoacceptor site definition. However, docking domains can facilitate association with all three MAPK subfamilies. Either these motifs are necessary but not sufficient to provide the specificity observed by MAPK subfamily members, or small differences within the motifs and the surrounding region may be critical but as yet uncharacterized specificity determinants. In this study, we have identified the structural determinants on ERF that mediate a highly specific interaction with Erks. Our data suggest that ERF can physically associate not only with active but also inactive Erks, but not with members from other MAPK subfamilies. The same areas of both active and inactive Erk2, around the αF and αG helices and the activation loop, mediate interaction with ERF. Two FXF motifs on ERF, adjacent to structurally flexible polyserine and polyglycine stretches, are required for its effective association with Erk. Interestingly, the association of ERF with active Erk is significantly stronger than that with inactive Erk and involves a different FXF motif than the one utilized by inactive Erk. In addition, the overall protein sequence and structure surrounding these motifs are important for this interaction. An extensive 100-amino acid region of ERF harboring the two FXF motifs is required for the effective and selective inhibition of cellular Erk activity. Mutation of the FXF motifs alters ERF cellular function, suggesting that the ERF-Erk association is required for the effective in vivo phosphorylation and regulation of ERF by the Erk kinases. Our data provide insights into the specificity mechanisms of these multisubstrate kinases. Cell Lines—Ref1 (rat embryo fibroblasts) and COS-7 cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. NIH-3T3 cells (Swiss mouse embryonic fibroblasts) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% calf serum. For low serum growth assays, NIH-3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 or 0.2% calf serum and 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7). Cells were transfected either with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol or with calcium phosphate. Plasmids—The pGEX-4T-1 vector (GE Healthcare) was used to generate glutathione S-transferase (GST)-ERF chimeras with standard recombinant DNA techniques. Briefly, the pGST257-425 plasmid was constructed by inserting the 502-bp Sau3AI/Sau3AI ERF fragment (amino acids 257-425) into the BamHI site of the pGEX-4T-1 vector. The pGST257-293 plasmid (amino acids 257-293) was generated by removing the ApaI/EcoRI fragment of pGST257-425.

The pGST313-425 plasmid (amino acids 313-425) was generated by removing the 170-bp BamHI/PstI fragment of pGST257-425. The pGST350-425 plasmid (amino acids 350-425) was generated by removing the 290-bp BamHI/NcoI fragment of pGST257-425. The pGST294-385 plasmid (amino acids 294-385) was generated by removing the 110-bp NaeI/EcoRI fragment of pGST257-385.

The pGST313-385 plasmid (amino acids 313-385) was generated by removing the 110-bp NaeI/EcoRI fragment of pGST257-385. The pGST313-352 plasmid (amino acids 313-352) was generated by removing the 210-bp NcoI/SmaI fragment of pGST294-352. The pGST350-385 plasmid (amino acids 350-385) was generated by removing the 290-bp BamHI/NcoI fragment of pGST257-385. The D66 expression plasmid (amino acids 257-425/Δ295-312) was generated by inserting the 330-bp PstI/SalI fragment of pGST257-425 into the EcoRI/SalI site of pGST257-293. The ASA expression plasmid, carrying mutations of Phe303 and Phe305 to alanines, and the AKA expression plasmid, carrying mutations of Phe375 and Phe377, were generated using the GeneEditor system (Promega) on the pGST257-425 plasmid according to the manufacturer's protocol. The ASA/AKA expression plasmid was generated by replacing the 200-bp NcoI/NheI fragment of the ASA expression plasmid with the respective region of the AKA expression plasmid. The pGST-RD plasmid (amino acids 473-548) was generated by inserting the SmaI/BstEII fragment of ERF into the SalI site of pGEX-4T-1. The pGFP-D66, pGFP-ASA, pGFP-AKA, and pGFP-ASA/AKA plasmids were constructing by replacing the 425-bp BstXI/NheI fragment of pGFP-ERF (2Le Gallic L. Sgouras D. Beal Jr., G. Mavrothalassitis G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4121-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with the respective fragments from the D66, ASA, AKA, and ASA/AKA expression plasmids. The pCMV-HA-ERF plasmid was generating by inserting the 1935-bp SmaI/BstEII fragment of the human ERF cDNA into the unique BamHI site of the pCMV-HA vector (14van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), which is immediately after the hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The resulting HA-tagged ERF protein contains the GPPS tetrapeptide between the HA tag and the initiating methionine of the ERF protein. The HA-D66, HA-ASA, HA-AKA, and HA-ASA/AKA expression plasmids, expressing HA-tagged versions of the mutant ERF proteins, were generated by replacing the same 425-bp BstXI/NheI fragment of the pCMV-HA-ERF plasmid. The pEBG294-385, pEBG257-352, pEBG257-385, and pEBG294-425 plasmids were constructed by cloning the corresponding BamHI/NotI fragments of pGST294-385, pGST257-352, pGST257-385, and pGST294-425 into the pEBG vector (15Sanchez I.

Fusion Protein Production, Purification, and Interaction Assays—Bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, expression of the fusion protein was induced in bacteria by 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at room temperature for 2 h. Bacteria were lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline, and Triton X-100 was added at a final concentration of 1% to facilitate solubilization of proteins. The extract was incubated overnight with glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C; the beads were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline; and when needed, the protein was eluted with 100 mm glutathione. The proteins were at least 99% pure as estimated by SDS electrophoresis. To determine protein-protein interactions, 3-5 μgof glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST fusion proteins were incubated with 100 ng of bacterially expressed purified Erk2 proteins in 50 μl of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were washed four times with the same buffer, and the remaining proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Erk or anti-p38 (New England Biolabs Inc.), anti-phospho-Erk (Sigma), or anti-GST (GE Healthcare) antibody. For interaction with Erk proteins from cellular extracts, cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 100 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm orthovanadate, and 1 μg/ml microcystin and diluted 4-fold with the same buffer without Triton X-100; 3-5 μg of glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST fusion proteins were added; and ERF-associated proteins were analyzed as described above.

Cobb, manuscript in preparation. In Vitro Kinase Assays—MAPK assays were performed either with in vitro translated full-length ERF protein or with purified GST-ERF-(257-425) protein. Briefly, [35S]Met-labeled ERF protein was produced in a cell-free in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega) as described previously (1Sgouras D.N. Athanasiou M.A. Beal Jr., G.J. Fisher R.J. Blair D.G. Mavrothalassitis G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4781-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). After 60 min, the kinase was added to the reaction and incubated for an additional 15 min at 30 °C, and the proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis. ERF phosphorylation was determined by the mobility shift of the protein after autoradiography. Alternatively, the recombinant proteins were incubated in 40 mm NaHEPES (pH 8.0), 2 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm orthovanadate, 20 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 100 μm ATP, and 5μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at 30 °C, and the proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography. Rsk kinase assays were performed as described previously (24Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation, Immunofluorescence, Subcellular Localization, and 5-Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Incorporation—Co-immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (2Le Gallic L. Sgouras D. Beal Jr., G. Mavrothalassitis G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4121-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with plasmid expressing tagged proteins. 24 h after transfection, the cells were serum-deprived for 4 h; incubated with 20% serum for 15 min; and lysed in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 100 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm orthovanadate, and 1 μg/ml microcystin. The tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with 1μgof rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) or 1μg of mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The precipitated complexes were washed three times and analyzed by electrophoresis. The presence of ERF, Erk, and phospho-Erk in the complexes was detected by immunoblotting using antibody S17S (1Sgouras D.N. Athanasiou M.A. Beal Jr., G.J. Fisher R.J. Blair D.G. Mavrothalassitis G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4781-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-Erk antibody (New England Biolabs Inc.), and mouse anti-phospho-Erk monoclonal antibody YT (Sigma), respectively. Subcellular localization of phosphorylated ERF was determined by immunofluorescence using anti-phospho-ERF antibody P3-4 as described previously (3Le Gallic L. Virgilio L. Cohen P. Biteau B. Mavrothalassitis G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1206-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For enhanced phospho-ERF signal in the simultaneous detection of phospho-ERF and total ERF, immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (3Le Gallic L. Virgilio L. Cohen P. Biteau B. Mavrothalassitis G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1206-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but the P3-4 antibody was used at a dilution of 1:20, whereas the S17S antibody was used at 1:150. The localization of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-ERF fusion proteins was determined either by direct GFP fluorescence or using anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Clontech) at 1:50 dilution on formaldehyde-fixed cells. Samples were scanned on the xy plane with a Leica TCS SP confocal microscope with a ×63 oil submersion objective. Images were electronically merged with Leica LCS Version 2.5 confocal software. BrdUrd incorporation assays were performed as described previously (2Le Gallic L. Sgouras D. Beal Jr., G. Mavrothalassitis G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4121-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were transfected with an ERF expression plasmid and a GFP expression plasmid to mark the transfected cells. 24 or 48 h after transfection, BrdUrd was added at a final concentration of 50 μm for 4, 8, or 16 h. Cells were fixed with 3.5% formaldehyde and stained with mouse anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at 1:100 dilution. GFP-positive cells were scored with rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Clontech) at 1:250 dilution. We have shown previously that ERF specifically interacts with and is phosphorylated by Erks in cells and in vitro in a cell-free system (2Le Gallic L. Sgouras D. Beal Jr., G. Mavrothalassitis G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4121-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, it was not clear whether this specificity was mediated by direct interaction of the two proteins and, if so, the nature of the structural determinants of this interaction. Thus, we first determined regions on Erk that may mediate ERF-specific phosphorylation. We utilized Erk2 chimeras with other MAPKs and determined their ability to phosphorylate ERF produced in a cell-free system. Activated Erk2 readily phosphorylated ERF, whereas 10-20-fold higher amounts of activated p38 MAPK were required to achieve comparable phosphorylation under these conditions (Fig. 1A, compare 250 ng of p38 with 25 and 12.5 ng of Erk2). The Erk2-p38 chimeras PIVECTP and EIIPIVE (19Wilsbacher J.L. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16988-16994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which have domains I-IV and CT and domains II-IV of p38, respectively, could bind to Erk2 substrates specifically (25Nichols A. Camps M. Gillieron C. Chabert C. Brunet A. Wilsbacher J. Cobb M. Pouyssegur J. Shaw J.P. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24613-24621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and could also readily phosphorylate ERF. In contrast, the Erk2/5 (22English J.M. Pearson G. Baer R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3854-3860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and Erk2/3 (23Robinson M.J. Xu B. Stippec S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5094-5100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) hybrids, which have domains I-IV from Erk2 and the substrate recognition domains of Erk5 and Erk3, respectively, were unable to phosphorylate ERF. This was also true for the kinase-dead K52R mutant of Erk2 and the Erk2 deletion mutant Δ241-271, which fails to interact with MEK1 (21Robinson F.L. Whitehurst A.W. Raman M. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14844-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), further suggesting a direct interaction with and phosphorylation by Erk2 (Fig. 1B). The basic ΦXΦ (8Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.H. Galanis A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and FXF (11Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) motifs have been identified previously to mediate specific substrate interaction with Erks. The ERF sequence harbors four FXF motifs and an inverted basic ΦXΦ motif adjacent to Erk phosphorylation sites (Fig. 2A). However, neither the two optimal FXFP motifs found in the N-terminal portion of the protein nor the inverted basic ΦXΦ motif at the C terminus is within the region spanning amino acids 316-416, previously identified to mediate ERF-Erk interaction (2Le Gallic L. Sgouras D. Beal Jr., G. Mavrothalassitis G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4121-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Utilizing segments of the ERF protein expressed as GST fusion proteins in bacteria, we determined their interaction with bacterially expressed Erk2 via pulldown assays. Erk2 could phosphorylate all of the GST-ERF fusion proteins as evidenced by the mobility shift of the proteins (Fig. 2B), 4S. Polychronopoulos, M. Verykokakis, M. N. Yazicioglu, M. Sakarellos-Daitsiotis, M. H. Cobb, and G. Mavrothalassitis, unpublished data. consistent with the distribution of the phosphorylation sites on ERF and the distribution of putative interaction motifs. However, neither the 256-amino acid N-terminal segment (data not shown) nor the 78-amino acid C-terminal segment (GST-RD) (Fig. 2C) could form stable complexes with Erk2 regardless of phosphorylation state (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the middle portion of the protein from amino acids 257 to 424 could effectively associate with Erk2 in a phosphorylation state-independent manner. Interestingly, the association with activated Erk2 appeared to be stronger than that with inactive Erk2 (Fig. 2C, GST257-425 lanes). The Erk2-p38 hybrids PIVECTP and EIIPIVE, which have the catalytic center of p38 MAPK, could also phosphorylate ERF (Fig. 1B) and could physically interact with the same region of ERF. In contrast, wild-type p38 could not associate with ERF (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the Erk2 specificity is mediated by interactions outside the catalytic center. To further define the region mediating ERF-Erk2 interaction, we generated a number of ERF deletion mutations and tested them by GST pulldown assays. Our data suggest that the region spanning amino acids 294-385 is the minimal region on ERF required for ERF-Erk interaction (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, although both active and inactive Erk2 could interact with this region, they appear to have distinct requirements. Thus, the region between amino acids 294 and 313 affected the interaction with activated Erk2, but not with non-phosphorylated inactive Erk2 (compare deletions Δ257-425 and D66, Δ294-425 and Δ313-425, and Δ294-385 and Δ313-385) (Fig. 3A, upper panel). The region between amino acids 352 and 385 affected primarily interaction with Erk2 (compare deletions Δ257-385 and Δ257-352, Δ294-385 and Δ294-352, and Δ313-385 and Δ313-352) (Fig. 3A, middle panel, and supplemental Fig. S1). In addition to the differences in structural requirements, our data suggest that activated Erk2 had a higher affinity for ERF than did inactive Erk2 (Fig. 2C) (2Le Gallic L. Sgouras D. Beal Jr., G.

https://openalex.org/W1970876619,"Tripeptidylpeptidase II (TPP II) is an exopeptidase of the subtilisin type of serine proteases, a key component of the protein degradation cascade in many eukaryotes, which cleaves tripeptides from the N terminus of proteasome-released products. The Drosophila TPP II is a large homooligomeric complex (∼6 MDa) that is organized in a unique repetitive structure with two strands each composed of ten stacked homodimers; two strands intertwine to form a spindle-shaped structure. We report a novel procedure of preparing an active, structurally homogeneous TPP II holo-complex overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Assembly studies revealed that the specific activity of TPP II increases with oligomer size, which in turn is strongly concentration-dependent. At a TPP II concentration such as prevailing in Drosophila, equilibration of size and activity proceeds on a time scale of hours and leads to spindle formation at a TPP II concentration of ≥0.03 mg/ml. Before equilibrium is reached, activation lags behind assembly, suggesting that activation occurs in a two-step process consisting of (i) assembly and (ii) a subsequent conformational change leading to a switch from basal to full activity. We propose a model consistent with the hyperbolic increase of activity with oligomer size. Spindle formation by strand pairing causes both significant thermodynamic and kinetic stabilization. The strands inherently heterogeneous in length are thus locked into a discrete oligomeric state.

Eventually, all proteins are channeled through the proteolytic degradation cascade. One cellular strategy to cope with the complexity of a crowded cytosol is sequestration of proteolytic substrates into large protein nanocompartments. In eukaryotes, the proteolytic cascade starts with ATP-dependent cleavage of ubiquitinylated proteins by the 26 S proteasome, the paradigm of a self-compartmentalized protease (1Baumeister W. Walz J.

TPP II is a serine protease belonging to the family of subtilases, and it cleaves tripeptides processively from the N terminus of larger peptides (18Balow R.M. Ragnarsson U. Zetterqvist O. J. Biol.

Moreover, the first two residues of the catalytic triad are interrupted by an insert of ∼200 amino acids that, like the C-terminal half of the polypeptide, is not homologous to any protein present in the data base. The gene for TPP II has been found exclusively in eukaryotes, and the protein has been isolated from rat, human (21Balow R.M. Tomkinson B. Ragnarsson U. Zetterqvist O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2409-2417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Drosophila (22Renn S.C. Tomkinson B. Taghert P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19173-19182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and Arabidopsis (23Book A.J. Yang P.Z. Scalf M. Smith L.M. Vierstra R.D. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 1046-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The monomer molecular masses range from 138 kDa for the human, mouse and rat to 150 kDa for plant, worm, and insect homologues. In contrast to pyrolysin and STABLE, and its eukaryotic functional relatives, TPP II is organized into a large assembly comprising 40 subunits (24Rockel B. Peters J. Müller S.A. Seyit G. Ringler P. Hegerl R. Glaeser R.M. Baumeister W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10135-10140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which is unique in several respects. Oligomeric protease complexes generally have a self-contained and, therefore, discrete subunit architecture, either circular, with up to four rings stacked, as in the 20S-proteasome (1Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar), tetragonal, as in TET (25Borissenko L. Groll M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), or spherical, as in the Tricorn capsid (26Walz J. Tamura T. Tamura N. Grimm R. Baumeister W. Koster A.J. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 59-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The basic architecture of the TPP II holo-complex, however, is a stack of dimers in twisted strands that appear not to be subject to any geometrical constraints limiting their subunit number (24Rockel B. Peters J. Müller S.A. Seyit G. Ringler P. Hegerl R. Glaeser R.M. Baumeister W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10135-10140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, because of mass action equilibria, the length of single strands should be intrinsically heterogeneous, and this is indeed observed under different conditions in vitro (24Rockel B. Peters J. Müller S.A. Seyit G. Ringler P. Hegerl R. Glaeser R.M. Baumeister W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10135-10140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Harris J.R. Tomkinson B.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5979-5984Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in vivo, TPP II is composed of two stacks of 10 dimers each, forming a twisted, spindle-shaped structure as shown for Drosophila TPP II by cryo-electron microscopy (24Rockel B. Peters J. Müller S.A. Seyit G. Ringler P. Hegerl R. Glaeser R.M. Baumeister W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10135-10140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The cryo-electron microscopy structure also reveals a reciprocal interaction of two terminal dimeric subunits that may stabilize the spindle. The strands appear to enclose a novel variant of a proteolytic nanocompartment, a tunnel having lateral openings on one side, reminiscent of an arcade (24Rockel B. Peters J. Müller S.A. Seyit G. Ringler P. Hegerl R. Glaeser R.M. Baumeister W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10135-10140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The TPP II holo-complex has been reported to decay under conditions such as dialysis (29Macpherson E. Tomkinson B. Balow R.M. Hoglund S. Zetterqvist O. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or freezing/thawing (30Tomkinson B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), with a concomitant decrease of activity. In the latter case, the activity dropped to about one-tenth and recovered to some extent upon partial reassembly. This hinted at a correlation between oligomeric state and specific activity and elicited speculations on a regulation of the enzyme activity via association/dissociation (2Tomkinson B. Lindas A.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Macpherson E. Tomkinson B. Balow R.M. Hoglund S. Zetterqvist O. Biochem.

To obtain clues as to the biological meaning of the enormous size of the TPP II holo-complex as well as its supposedly size-dependent activity, we have studied the stability of the spindle-shaped complex as well as the time course of assembly and activation using TPP II overexpressed recombinantly in Escherichia coli in its native form. The relationship between oligomer size and specific activity established here led us to propose a model of assembly and activation of the TPP II holo-complex. Strains and Cloning—E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was used for expression of TPP II. From a Drosophila expressed sequence tag clone (Umea Drosophila Stock Center, University of Umea, Sweden) the structural gene for TPP II was cloned between the NdeI and the NotI sites of the vector pET-30b (Novagen). Cells were grown on LB agar plates containing kanamycin (30 μg/ml). Expression in E. coli—Single colonies were inoculated into Terrific broth (TB)-rich medium supplemented with 30 mg/liter kanamycin, and precultures were grown at 37 °C for 12 h. 5 ml of preculture was transferred into 500 ml of fresh medium (Terrific broth) and grown with vigorous shaking at 37 °C to an A600 of 2.5. After cooling down to 18 °C, the cultures were induced with 0.1 mm IPTG and grown at 18 °C for 24 h. Activity Measurements—Exopeptidase activity measurements of TPP II were carried out at 30 °C. The fluorogenic substrate Ala-Ala-Phe-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AAF-AMC, Bachem) was used at a concentration of either 0.2 mm or 2.0 mm in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 5% glycerol, 5% Me2SO, 0.1 mm bestatin. 50-μl reactions were stopped after 30 s to 10 min with 450 μl of 100 mm Tris/Cl, pH 9.5, 1% SDS. The release of AMC was measured in an SFM25 fluorometer (Kontron Instruments) at λex360 nm and λem460 nm calibrated using free AMC. SDS-PAGE and Densitometric Evaluation—For SDS-PAGE, the buffer system of Schägger and Jagow (31Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) was used. The acrylamide concentration was 9%. Samples were mixed with 0.2 volume of 5% SDS, 100 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.5, 50 mm DTT, 50% glycerol and solubilized at 70 °C for 5 min. Cross-linked samples were centrifuged at 19,000 × g prior to loading. Dilute samples were subjected to precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration) on ice. For native PAGE, samples were mixed with gel loading buffer to give final concentrations of 40 mm Tris/Cl, pH 6.8, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 2.5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (w/v), bromphenol blue, and subjected to electrophoresis on Novex® Pre-Cast 4-12% Tris/glycine gels (Invitrogen) using 1× Tris/glycine native running buffer (25 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.5, 190 mm glycine). Electrophoresis was performed overnight at 4 °C. Staining was performed with colloidal Coomassie (Coomassie BioSafe, Bio-Rad). Bands were scanned on an HP 1680 Pro Scanner and evaluated using the software Image (National Institutes of Health). For calibration of the TPP II concentration, 0.5-3 μg of purified TPP II were loaded on the same gel. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Kinetic Studies—Induced E. coli cultures were harvested at different times and suspended in 1-3 volumes of 80 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 10 mm DTT. These suspensions were frozen dropwise in liquid nitrogen, and the resulting beads were stored at -80 °C. For cell disruption, thawed out samples were sonicated in an ice/water bath in 15-ml Falcon tubes using a sonicator (Bransonic, cylindrical tip, 1-cm diameter, 3 × 5 pulses, setting “8” at 50% pulse duration), centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant was subjected to chromatography on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column at room temperature using 80 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, 5% glycerol as running buffer at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions eluted were immediately subjected to activity assays. For assembly studies, crude extract from cells harvested after 2 h of induction was thawed on ice and incubated at 30 °C for different periods of time, and 200 μl of sample was then subjected to size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) on Superose 6 (Amersham Biosciences). Activity was assayed immediately after elution. From the specific activity of fully assembled TPP II, the concentration of TPP II in the cell extract was calculated and adjusted to 0.1 mg/ml before incubation using the phosphate buffer. Purification of TPP II—TPP II was initially purified from E. coli using the method described for native Drosophila TPP II (28Rockel B. Peters J. Kuhlmorgen B. Glaeser R.M. Baumeister W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5979-5984Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and an additional run on Superose 6 was performed to separate dissociated complexes from intact material. Later, the following novel method was used: E. coli crude extract was prepared by passage of the cells suspended in 1 volume of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mm DTT, through a Cell Disrupter (EmulsiFlex-C5 Homogenizer, Avestin) twice. Then the crude lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min, and the sediment was resuspended in 3 volumes of 100 mm potassium phosphate, 5 mm DTT. After centrifugation as before, 1 m triethanolamine, pH 7.7, was added to the supernatant to 100 mm final concentration, then polyethyleneimine (PEI) was added until no more precipitate was formed (0.2-0.4% final concentration, depending on the individual preparation), and the pH was adjusted to 8.9 using dilute KOH. After centrifugation at 19,000 × g, the sediment was discarded, and 1.2 volumes of saturated ammonium sulfate were added to the supernatant. After incubation on ice for 15 min, the sample was centrifuged at 4 °C/19,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed completely in a brief second centrifugation step and discarded, and the sediment was dissolved in 80 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 2 mm DTT. The sample was then incubated at 30 °C for 20 min to reduce the amount of spindles carrying extensions, and then 500 μl of sample was loaded on a Superose 6 column, using 80 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 2 mm DTT as running buffer at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions eluting between 6.8 and 10 ml were collected and stored at room temperature. The peak fraction was collected between 7.2 and 8.8 ml. For storage of more than 2 days at room temperature, 3 mm sodium azide (final concentration) was added. The protein concentration in the eluate was typically 0.7 to 1 mg/ml. Guanidine Titration—To TPP II purified as described above, 6 m GdnHCl was added dropwise to a final concentration of 550 mm during 20 min at 25 °C. The sample was then separated on a Superose 6 column as described above. Chemical Cross-linking—To PEI-treated crude extract, 1 m triethanolamine/phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, was added to a final concentration of 100 mm, and the pH was adjusted to pH 8.3. The sample was kept on ice, and then the homobifunctional cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce) dissolved in Milli-Q grade water (Millipore) to a concentration of 50 mm was added in five increments during 10 min to a final concentration of 2.5 mm. After another 5 min, 20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.5, was added to bind excess reagent, and the samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE (see above). Determination of Kinetic Constants—For the determination of Km, samples were incubated in the presence of 0.005 to 2 mm AAF-AMC, 5% Me2SO, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm bestatin, at 30 °C for up to 2 min, and reactions were terminated as described above. For determination of Vmax, the protein concentration was determined using the Bradford-assay (Bio-Rad) or by densitometric quantitation of Coomassie-stained bands on SDS-acrylamide gels. Electron Microscopy—For negative staining, carbon-coated copper grids were incubated for 1 min on a drop of protein sample solution and then consecutively transferred to two drops of 40 mm ammonium sulfate, pH 7.5, for washing. Staining was performed by incubation on a drop of 2% uranyl acetate for 1 min. Recombinant Expression and Purification of TPP II—Compared with eukaryotic sources, the expression of TPP II in E. coli has the advantage of high yields of recombinant protein. Because the expression yield of soluble protein significantly depended on the conditions of growth and induction, we optimized the conditions with respect to growth medium, temperature, incubation time, and concentration of inducing agent (isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)). At the temperature of 30 °C a significant fraction of protein was present as insoluble precipitate in overexpressing E. coli cells. The reduction of temperature and of IPTG concentration improved the yield of soluble protein. We found that 18 °C/0.1 mm IPTG resulted in optimal expression with minimal insoluble TPP II. Under these conditions, an induction time of 20 h is required to obtain full specific enzymatic activity of TPP II in the crude lysate. SDS-PAGE of the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1A) revealed that the 150-kDa protein was strongly overexpressed in E. coli. Because a major fraction of TPP II was not present in spindle form but as incompletely assembled large oligomers, a procedure was developed that permitted the purification of intact spindle complexes at high yield and conformational homogeneity. Because TPP II largely associates with cell debris in highly concentrated E. coli lysates, a significant enrichment of TPP II was achieved by passing the sediment through a second cycle of disruption and using only the supernatant of the second sedimentation (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Treatment with PEI at pH 8.9 caused TPP II to dissociate into small oligomers, mainly tetramers. Ensuing ammonium sulfate precipitation (see “Experimental Procedures”) reconstituted the TPP II holo-complex, which was efficiently separated from E. coli proteins by SEC on Superose 6 (Fig. 1B). The purity of the TPP II preparation (Fig. 1A, lane 6) was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis of faint bands visible in overloaded lanes (data not shown), which demonstrated these to be TPP II fragments, probably generated by proteolytic nicking. The elution peak of the holo-complex at 7.5 ml, corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of ∼10-20 MDa, indicated that a significant fraction of the complex was present as particles larger than spindles. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of spindles having extensions of one or both of their component strands and single strands in addition to spindles (Fig. 1C). Upon incubation of the peak fraction collected at 7.2-8.0 ml at room temperature for at least 3 days, most of the material was converted to spindles. The fraction collected at 8.0-8.8 ml (Fig. 1D) consists essentially of spindles that are morphologically indistinguishable from the native protein complex isolated from Drosophila (Fig. 1E). The formation of extended particles is attributable to the extremely high concentration of TPP II in the ammonium sulfate precipitate. Whereas the concentration was ∼10 mg/ml in the sample loaded on SEC, it was reduced to ∼1 mg/ml in the peak fraction. Size equilibration of TPP II oligomers is a very slow process, particularly at relatively high concentration, but the upper marginal concentration for the stability of non-extended spindles may be roughly estimated to be 1-3 mg/ml. The protein expressed in soluble form amounted to ∼7.5% of total E. coli soluble protein. For comparison, the native protein makes up ∼0.05% of soluble protein in Drosophila egg lysate. The yield of purified TPP II was 15-20 mg/liter of growth medium, or 1.5-2 mg/g of cells. In contrast, the yield of purified native TPP II was only ∼0.005 mg/g of Drosophila eggs, which is comparable to other eukaryotic sources. 3J. Peters, unpublished data. Enzymological Characterization of Recombinant TPP II—In addition to the morphology, the enzymological properties of native and recombinant TPP II were compared, using AAF-AMC as substrate. The Km was determined to be 0.44 ± 0.05 mm for the recombinant and 0.47 ± 0.07 mm for the native enzyme. The Vmax values were 22300 ± 880 pmol × μg-1 × min-1 and 21800 ± 730 pmol × μg-1 × min-1, respectively. The inability to cleave succinyl-AAF-AMC (specific activity, <0.1% of exopeptidase activity) indicates the absence of contaminating nonspecific endoproteinase activities in the recombinant enzyme preparations. Building Blocks of the TPP II Complex—It was suggested for human TPP II that dimers are the building blocks of the holo-complex (27Harris J.R. Tomkinson B. Micron and Microscopica Acta. 1990; 21: 77-89Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Indeed, the three-dimensional structure determined by cryo-electron microscopy shows the dimer to be the repeating structural unit of a TPP II strand, and it was suggested that assembly proceeds via successive concatenation of dimers into strands (24Rockel B. Peters J. Müller S.A. Seyit G. Ringler P. Hegerl R. Glaeser R.M. Baumeister W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10135-10140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, intermediates of TPP II ranging in size between dimers and the holo-complex have not as yet been investigated. The presence of trimeric intermediates cannot be excluded a priori. Also, tetramers, the most abundant small complex (see Figs. 1B and 3 below), might dimerize into octamers as opposed to reacting with dimers to form hexamers. SEC cannot resolve trimers in the presence of dimers and tetramers. Therefore, to verify that assembly/disassembly intermediates of TPP II strands are multiples of two, we used chemical cross-linking in combination with SDS-PAGE to determine the population of these oligomeric states under conditions causing fragmentation of the TPP II complex. For this purpose, crude extract was subjected to partially dissociating PEI/pH 8.9 treatment as in the purification procedure but cross-linked with a lysine-specific bifunctional reagent (see “Experimental Procedures”) and subjected to SEC and subsequently denaturing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). The three major bands observed in the molecular mass range of 300-900 kDa were assigned to dimers, tetramers, and hexamers of TPP II, respectively (Fig. 2B). Trimers were only detected in trace amounts, and this was probably attributable to incomplete cross-linking of tetramers. Notably, octamers were not detected in significant amounts with respect to hexamers (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Chemical cross-linking of partially dissociated TPP II complex.

Tetramers were likewise obtained by native PAGE of the purified holo-complex (data not shown), which confirms that, under dissociating conditions, tetramers are the most stable oligomeric form of Drosophila TPP II. In contrast, human TPP II migrated as a dimer in native PAGE (30Tomkinson B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).

In contrast to LHC II, the red-most Chl subband of CP29 is due to a monomeric Chl a. The two Chls b in CP29 exhibit marked differences: a Chl b absorbing at ∼650 nm is not excitonically coupled to other Chls. Based on this finding, the refractive index of its microenvironment can be determined to be 1.48. The second Chl b in CP29 (absorbing at ∼640 nm) is strongly coupled to Chl a.

Higher plants possess a complex light-harvesting antenna system for both photosystems, I and II. In photosystem II, the trimeric light-harvesting complex (LHC II), 2The abbreviations used are: LHC II, main light-harvesting complex associated with photosystem II; Chl, chlorophyll; PCP, peridinin-chlorophyll a protein; TPEF, (stepwise) two-photon-excited fluorescence from higher excited states; EET, excitation energy transfer; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. harboring almost 50% of the total chlorophyll (Chl) a and b in the thylakoid membranes, comprises the most peripheral antenna. The monomeric minor antenna complexes CP29, CP26, and CP24 (lhcb4–6 gene products) are connected to LHC II and are located proximal to the core antenna complexes, CP43 and CP47, which surround the reaction center; for a recent review see Ref. 1Dekker J.P. Boekema E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1706: 12-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar. In contrast to LHC II, for which very recently high resolution x-ray structural analyses have been obtained (2Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 3Standfuss J. Terwischa van Scheltinga A.C. Lamborghini M. Kühlbrandt W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), no such high resolution structures of the minor complexes are available yet. Their structures are assumed to be comparable with that of the monomeric subunits of LHC II but with lower Chl content: According to present knowledge CP29 binds six Chls a and two Chls b (4Sandona D.

Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 71: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, currently no high resolution structure for CP47 is available. However, x-ray structural analyses of three-dimensional crystals of oxygen evolving PS II core complexes from the thermophilic cyanobacteria Thermosynechococcus elongatus (6Zouni A. Witt H.-T. Kern J. Fromme P. Kraus N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar, 7Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S.

A. 2003; 100: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) at medium resolution have been obtained. According to the most recent analysis at 3.0 Å resolution (8Loll B. Kern J. Saenger W. Zouni A. Biesiadka J. Nature. 2005; 438: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar), 16 Chl a molecules are bound to cyanobacterial CP47. Purified CP47 from spinach was found to bind 15 ± 1 Chls a and 3–4 β-carotenes (10Huyer J. Eckert H.-J. Irrgang K.-D. Miao J. Eichler H.-J. Renger G. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2004; 108: 3326-3334Crossref Google Scholar), which is in good agreement with the recent structural analyses of its cyanobacterial homologues (6Zouni A. Witt H.-T. Kern J. Fromme P. Kraus N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar, 7Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S.

The amino acid sequences of the CP47 apoproteins from spinach and T. elongatus are 73% identical. Analysis of putative Chl a ligands of spinach CP47 and comparison with CP47 of T. elongatus reveal that all but Asp-188 (which is swapped for a glutamate residue in plant CP47) are conserved (data not shown). Because the transmembrane topology is predicted to be conserved and the environment of the pigment coordinating amino acids is very similar, or even identical, it is suggested that distances and relative orientation of the chlorin rings as well as the orientation of the Qx and Qy transition dipole moments are analogous in cyanobacterial and plant CP47 (11Loll B. Kern J. Zouni A. Saenger W. Biesiadka J. Irrgang K.-D. Photosyn. Res. 2005; 86: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Hence, it is highly likely that certain Chls a, with center-to-center distances on the order of 10 Å, in spinach CP47 show strong excitonic interactions. In plant antenna complexes absorption subbands of individual Chls a and b show strong spectral overlap (a phenomenon also referred to as spectral congestion), in particular in the red-most (Qy) absorption range. This issue strongly hinders the assessment of the extent of excitonic coupling in these pigment-protein complexes and its role in efficient light harvesting. The absorption subbands of the 42 Chls a and b in LHC II are represented in the Qy spectral range between 620 and 690 nm. Certainly, progress in crystal structure analyses, as achieved most recently for LHC II (2Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 3Standfuss J. Terwischa van Scheltinga A.C. Lamborghini M. Kühlbrandt W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), permits more adequate modeling of the intricate absorption substructure. However, an assignment of individual pigments (at their respective binding sites) to spectral substructures, relevant to understand excitation energy transfer (EET) ultimately ending in the photochemical reaction centers, is still very fragmentary. Moreover, the question as to what extent the available crystal structures reflect the pigment arrangement in native LHCs also has apparently no trivial answer (Ref. 12Leupold D. Voigt B. Beenken W. Stiel H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, cf. also Ref. 3Standfuss J. Terwischa van Scheltinga A.C. Lamborghini M. Kühlbrandt W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). One possibility to disentangle the “spectral congestion” with special regard to Qy transition dipole coupling between Chls is to search for fingerprints of excitonic coupling outside the Qy range. We have recently been able to detect weak fluorescence from higher excited (most probably Bx) states, elicited by stepwise two-photon excitation in the Qy range (TPEF), from Chl a and Chl b in solution as well as from pigment-protein complexes (13Leupold D. Teuchner K. Ehlert J. Irrgang K.-D. Renger G. Lokstein H. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1580-1585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Stepwise absorption of two photons (in contrast to simultaneous two-photon excitation) requires a sufficient excited state absorption in the Qy range. This condition is warranted for monomeric (uncoupled) Chls (14Leupold D. Struck A. Stiel H. Teuchner K. Oberländer S. Scheer H. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1990; 170: 478-484Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) as well as strongly excitonically coupled (Bacterio) Chls (15Leupold D. Stiel H. Teuchner K. Nowak F. Sandner W. Ücker B. Scheer H. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1996; 77: 4675-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the latter case this step is a one-exciton to bi-exciton transition (15Leupold D. Stiel H. Teuchner K. Nowak F.

Moreover, in a first attempt to analyze TPEF spectra with regard to excitonic Chl-Chl coupling, it was demonstrated that the red-most Qy absorption subband of LHC II (at ∼680 nm) is dominated by excitonically coupled Chls a with additional contributions from adjacent Chl b, which is in line with previous studies (16Schubert A.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). On the other hand, for the structurally related complex, CP29, no indication was found that the red-most absorption band is due to excitonic coupling; in particular, no contribution of Chl b to it was detectable, in accordance with previous reports (5Pieper J. Irrgang K.-D. Rätsep M. Voigt J. Renger G. Small G.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 71: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12Leupold D. Voigt B. Beenken W. Stiel H.

We report here an extended TPEF study on the peridinin-Chl a protein (PCP) from the dinoflagellate Amphidinium carterae and the plant complexes LHC II, CP29, and CP47, representing peripheral, proximal, and core antenna complexes. TPEF spectra were obtained at varying excitation wavelengths in the Chl a/b Qy range. The results of global analyses of TPEF line shapes based on corresponding standard shapes for monomeric Chls in a proteinaceous environment will be discussed with respect to strong excitonic coupling of pigments. Sample Preparation and Characterization—PCP was a kind gift from Dr. R. G. Hiller (Macquarie University) and was isolated from A. carterae as described previously (20Sharples F.P. Wrench P.M. Ou K. Hiller R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PCP was diluted prior to the measurements in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm KCl, pH 7.5. CP29 and CP47 (co-purifying with CP29) were isolated from spinach as described (5Pieper J. Irrgang K.-D. Rätsep M. Voigt J. Renger G. Small G.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 71: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10Huyer J. Eckert H.-J. Irrgang K.-D. Miao J. Eichler H.-J. Renger G. J. Phys. Chem.

Crude CP47 obtained after the first and second chromatography were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 30 mm NaCl, 0.025 w/v % n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, 2 mm benzamidine, and 5 mm ϵ-aminocaproate, concentrated, and loaded onto a Mono Q HR (5/5) connected to an FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). CP47 was eluted from the column using a linear gradient of 50–300 mm NaCl in equilibration buffer, dialyzed overnight, and concentrated. LHC II was prepared as described previously (13Leupold D. Teuchner K. Ehlert J. Irrgang K.-D. Renger G. Lokstein H. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1580-1585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Pigment-protein complexes were characterized by Western blotting using peptide-directed and monoclonal antibodies, reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry analyses as described previously (10Huyer J. Eckert H.-J. Irrgang K.-D. Miao J. Eichler H.-J. Renger G. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2004; 108: 3326-3334Crossref Google Scholar). The following Web-based protein analysis programs were used: BLAST (au.expasy.org/tools/blast/) for similarity searches, ClustalW (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) for alignments, and Predictprotein (www.predictprotein.org) to analyze transmembrane regions. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Lambda 900 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer). All samples were adjusted to an optical density = 0.1 cm–1 at the excitation wavelength. Absorption spectra were measured before and after the TPEF spectroscopy experiments to exclude sample degradation. Fluorescence Measurements—The setup for TPEF spectroscopy has been described in detail previously (13Leupold D. Teuchner K. Ehlert J. Irrgang K.-D. Renger G. Lokstein H. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1580-1585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21Teuchner K. Ehlert J. Freyer W. Leupold D. Altmeyer P. Stücker M. Hoffmann K. J. Fluoresc. 2000; 10: 275-281Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The 100-fs tuneable laser pulses had ∼10 nm spectral width (full width at half maximum); excitation photon flux density was 1028 cm–2 s–1 for measurements of the TPEF band shapes and between 2 × 1026 and 6 × 1028 cm–2 s–1 for measurement of intensity dependence of the TPEF signal. The fluorescence band shapes were spectrally corrected for the instrumental response. All measurements were performed at room temperature. Fluorescence Data Evaluation—TPEF spectra were evaluated using the program LorFit version 3.0. 3J. Ehlert, unpublished results. The non-linear fitting procedure is based on a simplex algorithm according to Nelder and Mead (22Nelder J.A. Mead R. Comput. J. 1965; 7: 308-313Crossref Google Scholar). All TPEF spectra were subjected to a global analysis procedure (i.e. a simultaneous fit of all data sets of the respective antenna complex with the same model functions and set of parameters). Lorentz-shaped profiles were assumed for all subbands. Fit parameters were peak positions, spectral widths, and amplitudes of the subbands. The TPEF line shape of PCP was used as a model function for monomeric Chl a in a proteinaceous environment for all other antenna complexes investigated. Thus, the free parameter space in the respective analyses is drastically reduced, resulting in very stable (against variation of the starting parameters) non-linear fits for CP47, CP29, and LHC II. Additionally, to improve the individual fits a variable amount of a spectrally broad (wavelength-independent) background had to be taken into account. This background most probably results from an onset of white light-like continuum generation. Peridinin Chlorophyll a Protein—PCP was chosen as a suitable system to obtain the TPEF line shape of monomeric Chl a in a proteinaceous environment. PCP contains only two Chls a per eight peridinins in each monomeric subunit of the trimeric complex (23Hofmann E. Wrench P.M. Sharpless F.P. Hiller R.G. Welte W. Diederichs K. Science. 1996; 272: 1788-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The Chls are well separated (by 17 Å) so that excitonic coupling is negligible (23Hofmann E. Wrench P.M. Sharpless F.P. Hiller R.G. Welte W. Diederichs K. Science. 1996; 272: 1788-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is generally assumed that there is no absorption of peridinin in the Chl Qy absorption range. Fig. 1 shows the TPEF spectra of Chl a in PCP excited by 100-fs laser pulses with peak wavelengths at 660, 670, and 680 nm (full width at half maximum 10 nm). The spectra are all characterized by a pronounced peak and a clearly resolved red-shifted shoulder. Results of a global analysis of the TPEF line shapes are also shown; the experimental spectra can be well reproduced by a superposition of two Lorentzians with maxima at 446.9 nm (assigned to the 0–0 transition) and 473.8 nm, the latter corresponding to a vibronic (0–1) structure. Additionally, a spectrally constant background had to be included. A closer inspection of the spectra reveals a moderate bathochromic shift (∼2–3 nm) of the TPEF peak of monomeric Chl a in PCP in comparison to monomeric Chl a in solution (cf. Ref. 13Leupold D. Teuchner K. Ehlert J. Irrgang K.-D. Renger G. Lokstein H. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1580-1585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The shift is obviously due to interaction of the Chl with the protein environment. It appears to be reasonable to assume that a similar shift occurs when Chl b is inserted into a proteinaceous matrix. Hence, applying the same shift to the TPEF line shape of dissolved Chl b provides a model function that can be used as a first approximation for TPEF of monomeric Chl b in pigment-protein complexes. These model functions were used to analyze the TPEF spectra of Chls in the plant antenna complexes CP47, CP29, and LHC II. CP47—CP47 (and CP43) form the core antenna of photosystem II in all oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. Because CP47 binds only Chl a it is a suitable pigment-protein complex to study excitonic coupling between Chls a by analyses of TPEF spectra. TPEF spectra of CP47 were measured at excitation wavelengths of 640, 650, 660, 670, and 680 nm. Two typical spectra, obtained at the blue and the red edges of the Qy absorption region, are shown in Fig. 2. A global analysis of all five TPEF spectra using the model function for monomeric Chl a in a proteinaceous environment obtained from PCP (see above) indicates that for a satisfactory fit an additional broad band (peaking at 448.2 nm) is required. The latter band contributes to a varying extent to the overall TPEF line shape at different excitation wavelengths. The broad, rather unstructured additional band is interpreted to represent the contribution of strongly excitonically coupled Chls a to the overall TPEF signals. The band exhibits a minor red-shift with respect to the 0–0 transition of monomeric Chl a (see above). In each of the five investigated TPEF spectra (excited by pulses with 10 nm full width at half maximum) contributions from both monomeric as well as excitonically coupled Chls a were resolved. A low temperature (77 K) absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic study together with Monte Carlo simulations (24de Weerd F.L. van Stokkum I.H.M. van Amerongen H. Dekker J.P. van Grondelle R.

Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar) provided indications for strong excitonic coupling between certain Chls a in CP47. Investigations using nonlinear polarization spectroscopy in the frequency domain in the Qy range are also consistent with the existence of strong excitonic Chl a/a coupling in CP47. 4B. Voigt, K.-D. Irrgang, G. Renger, D. Leupold, and H. Lokstein, unpublished results. A particularly remarkable feature is the dominant contribution of monomeric Chl a to the TPEF spectrum excited at 680 nm. Our results suggest that the 680-nm centered band in CP47 has to be assigned to an uncoupled Chl a. This band, however, does not appear to be the terminal state of the intra-complex EET in CP47 (24de Weerd F.L. van Stokkum I.H.M. van Amerongen H. Dekker J.P. van Grondelle R. Biophys.

A schematic representation of the strongly excitonically coupled Chls a in the 3.0 Å structural model of cyanobacterial CP47 (8Loll B. Kern J. Saenger W. Zouni A. Biesiadka J. Nature. 2005; 438: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar) is given in Fig. 6a: Chls a11, 12, and 13 (according to the designation in Ref. 8Loll B. Kern J. Saenger W. Zouni A. Biesiadka J. Nature. 2005; 438: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar) form a trimer; Chls a25 and 26 form a dimer. Most probably, the strongly coupled trimer is responsible for the red-most shifted subband (peaking at 683 nm) in the Qy spectral region. CP29—CP29 is one of the minor, monomeric LHCs of photosystem II in higher plants. The TPEF spectra of CP29, measured at five different excitation wavelengths between 640 and 680 nm, as well as the results of a global analysis of the data, are shown in Fig. 3. The following results were obtained by the global analysis. i) Two-step excitation at 640 and 650 nm (i.e. in the absorption region of the two Chls b) gives rise to strikingly different TPEF spectra. ii) Two-step excitation of CP29 at 660, 670, and 680 nm (in the Chl a absorption region) results in TPEF line shapes that can be simulated using components that reflect monomeric Chl a and excitonically coupled Chls a/b, with decreasing weight of the latter toward the red edge. The different TPEF line shapes observed upon excitation in the Chl b region can be explained by different excitonic coupling strengths of the two Chl b molecules in CP29 to neighboring Chl(s) a. Obviously, the Chl b excited at 640 nm is strongly coupled to Chl a, giving rise to the dominant broad TPEF band centered at 483.8 nm (note the red shift as compared with TPEF of monomeric Chl b; compare also the legend to Fig. 3). Excitonic coupling of the 640-nm absorbing Chl b with Chl a in CP29 has been demonstrated also by nonlinear polarization spectroscopy in the frequency domain experiments (19Voigt B. Irrgang K.-D. Ehlert J. Beenken W. Renger G. Leupold D. Lokstein H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3049-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the TPEF line shape obtained upon 640-nm excitation also a certain contribution from monomeric Chl a is resolved. The latter observation is most probably due to ultrafast EET from the first excited singlet state (S1) of the initially excited Chl b to S1 of a neighboring Chl a and subsequent absorption of a second photon by that Chl a. In marked contrast to the results obtained with 640-nm excitation, two-photon excitation at 650 nm (in the absorption region of the other Chl b) results in a TPEF spectrum that can be predominantly assigned to monomeric Chl b. No indication for excitonic coupling of this Chl b was obtained. A certain contribution of TPEF attributable to monomeric Chl a can be explained as the result of ultrafast EET as in the case of 640-nm excitation (see above). The results obtained upon excitation in the Chl a region are in line with previous studies suggesting that a monomeric Chl a is the origin of the red-most Qy subband of CP29 (see Ref. 19Voigt B. Irrgang K.-D. Ehlert J. Beenken W. Renger G. Leupold D. Lokstein H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3049-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar and references therein). This interpretation is further corroborated by the intensity dependence of 680-nm-excited TPEF of CP29 (see below). LHC II—TPEF spectra of trimeric LHC II have been measured at various excitation wavelengths in the range of Chl a/b Qy absorption. Fig. 4 shows TPEF spectra obtained upon excitation at 640, 650, 660, and 680 nm. In addition, the results of a global analysis of the data are depicted. The following results are particularly remarkable. i)Stepwise two-photon excitation at 640 nm results in a TPEF line shape that is dominated by a response due to excitonically coupled Chls a and b. Therefore, the absorption in the range ∼640 nm is mainly due to Chl b molecule(s) that is (are) a component of a heterodimer or an oligomeric cluster. There is also indication of a minor contribution from monomeric Chl b (in contrast to the TPEF spectra obtained upon 640-nm excitation of CP29, see above) as well as from monomeric Chl a (which can be explained by ultrafast EET to the latter as in the case of CP29; see above).ii)Excitation at 650 nm results in TPEF emission that can be assigned to originate from both, monomeric Chl b as well as monomeric Chl a. Obviously, the observation of TPEF emanating from Chl a is again (as for CP29) the result of ultrafast EET from S1 of Chl b to Chl a and subsequent absorption of a second photon by this Chl a. Most interestingly, there is no unequivocal indication of a TPEF contribution from excitonically coupled Chls. This differs somewhat from the explanation of the 650-nm-excited TPEF of LHC II that was presented previously (13Leupold D. Teuchner K. Ehlert J. Irrgang K.-D. Renger G. Lokstein H. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1580-1585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The previous interpretation, however, was based on a much smaller data set without employing global analysis of the data. Stepwise two-photon excitation at wavelengths ≥660 nm (Fig. 4 shows two typical spectra obtained upon excitation at 660 and 680 nm) results in TPEF line shapes that predominantly arise from the Chl b region (representing excitonically coupled as well as monomeric Chls b; the mechanism underlying the latter emission, however, is not yet understood). This is clearly different from the behavior of CP29 (compare Fig. 3). Particularly remarkable is the significant contribution of heterodimer/-oligomer-derived TPEF upon 680-nm excitation. This is in line with the intensity dependence of the TPEF signal of LHC II (see below) as well as with several studies indicating strong excitonic coupling between Chls in the longest wavelength range of LHC II (16Schubert A. Beenken W. Stiel H. Voigt B. Leupold D. Lokstein H. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1030-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Krikunova M. Voigt B. Lokstein H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, high resolution three-dimensional structural analyses of LHC II have become available (2Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 3Standfuss J. Terwischa van Scheltinga A.C. Lamborghini M. Kühlbrandt W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) allowing an unambiguous assignment of all eight Chls a and six Chls b to their respective binding sites. Moreover, their mutual distances have been determined with unprecedented accuracy as well as the orientations of their transition dipole moments, thus allowing more precise estimations of excitonic interaction strength between neighboring pigments (2Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). Indeed, strong excitonic Chl a-a (Chls a611 and a612, in their notation) as well as Chl a-b (a604 and b606, a603 and b609) interactions have been inferred from the structural data (2Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). A schematic representation of the strongly excitonically coupled Chls a in the 2.72 Å structural model of LHC II (2Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar) is given in Fig. 6b. The strongly excitonically coupled Chls a611/a612, located at the surface of the monomeric LHC II subunit (as well as of the LHC II-trimer), has been inferred to be of paramount importance for efficient EET in the photosystem II peripheral antenna system (13Leupold D. Teuchner K. Ehlert J. Irrgang K.-D. Renger G. Lokstein H. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1580-1585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Schubert A. Beenken W. Stiel H. Voigt B.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2281-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Intensity Dependence of the TPEF Signal Amplitude—TPEF emission from monomeric Chls a and b (in organic solvents) exhibits a quadratic dependence of signal amplitude on excitation intensity. This behavior can be modeled with a reasonable parameter set as outlined in Ref. 13Leupold D. Teuchner K. Ehlert J. Irrgang K.-D. Renger G. Lokstein H. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1580-1585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar. A similar behavior has been observed for certain excitation wavelengths (corresponding to absorption of Chls that are not excitonically coupled) in PCP, CP47, and CP29. The dependence of the TPEF signal amplitude on excitation intensity for CP47 and CP29 (with intensity variation over two orders of magnitude, in both cases for the excitation wavelength 680 nm) is shown to fit a straight line in the log/log plot in Fig. 5. This observation provides additional evidence that the red-most spectral form in the Qy absorption region of CP29 is due to a monomeric Chl a, being in line with the well established fact of non-interacting Chls a in PCP. LHC II shows a markedly different behavior: in the given excitation intensity range a deviation from the quadratic response is observed (Fig. 5). This is consistent with an ∼2-fold-enhanced Chl a absorption cross-section (as compared with monomeric Chl a) at ∼680 nm (16Schubert A. Beenken W. Stiel H. Voigt B. Leupold D. Lokstein H. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1030-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The experimentally determined intensity dependence of the TPEF of LHC II can be readily simulated by taking into account this increased absorption cross-section. Moreover, any significant contribution of exciton-exciton annihilation to the measured intensity dependence can be excluded.3 Implications for Excitation Energy Transfer—Although two-photon-excited fluorescence from higher excited (Bx) states (TPEF) of Chls a and b has a rather low quantum yield on the order of 10–4 (13Leupold D. Teuchner K. Ehlert J. Irrgang K.-D. Renger G. Lokstein H. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1580-1585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) it is nevertheless possible to detect this emission, even from isolated photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes. Excitation via consecutive two-step absorption of photons elicited by tunable 100-fs pulses, is based on the existence of Chl a and bS0 → S1 (Qy) absorption bands with significant S1 → Sx excited state absorption in the same spectral range. It is very important to note that the selective Soret region excitation of Chls accomplished via this route circumvents any excitation of fluorescence-emitting components of these complexes other than Chl a/b and/or of sample impurities that might confound the extremely weak Bx fluorescence. This problem would arise in case of direct one-photon excitation into transition(s) of the Chl a/b Soret range. The potential of the information contained in TPEF profiles is mainly due to its reflection of excitonic coupling of Chls in the Qy absorption range. The representation of the putative strongly coupled Chls in the recent structural models of CP47 (8Loll B. Kern J. Saenger W. Zouni A. Biesiadka J. Nature. 2005; 438: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar) and LHC II (2Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 6, a and b. Investigations in the Qy region directly are less informative because of the issue of severe spectral congestion. From the TPEF profiles of CP47 and CP29 Chl a excitonic coupling and Chl a/b heterodimeric/-oligomeric coupling, respectively, can be deduced. However, in both cases a subband centered at about 680 was found to be due to monomeric Chl a. This band is also the red-most Qy absorption subband in the case of CP29. In contrast, for LHC II the TPEF spectra suggest that the corresponding subband at 680 nm reflects strong excitonic coupling of two Chls a with inclusion of adjacent Chl(s) b. TPEF also indicates that heterodimeric/-oligomeric coupling is dominant in the absorption region around 640 nm in CP29 and LHC II, whereas monomeric Chl b absorbs around 650 nm. These findings are consistent with fs pump-probe data obtained with CP29 (25Gradinaru C.C. Pascal A.A. van Mourik F. Robert B. Horton P. van Grondelle R. van Amerongen H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1143-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26Croce R. Müller M.G. Bassi R. Holzwarth A.R. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2508-2516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Whereas the ultrafast absorption kinetics upon 653-nm excitation could be readily simulated assuming Förster-type EET, similar simulations fail for 640-nm excitation in CP29. The measured EET kinetics are ∼7 times faster than values calculated for Förster-type EET (27Cinque G. Croce R. Holzwarth A.R. Bassi R. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1706-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). According to the results presented in the current study, the transient absorption changes upon 640-nm excitation of CP29 mainly reflect exciton relaxation, consistent with previous studies (19Voigt B. Irrgang K.-D. Ehlert J. Beenken W. Renger G. Leupold D. Lokstein H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3049-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The finding that one of the two Chls b in CP29 (which has an absorption maximum of 652 nm at room temperature) is monomeric (not coupled excitonically to other Chls) allows the determination of the refractive index n of its microenvironment. Comparison with a plot of the Chl b Qy absorption maxima versus solvent polarizability (Lorentz-Lorenz factor) for a wide range of solvents 5I. Eichwurzel, H. Stiel, A. Scherz, H. Scheer, and D. Leupold, unpublished results. (compare also Ref. 28Eichwurzel I. Stiel H. Teuchner K. Leupold D. Scheer H. Salomon Y. Scherz A. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 72: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) resulted in n = 1.48 for the environment of this particular Chl b. A value of n = 1.5 has been obtained previously as a result of EET simulations in CP29 (25Gradinaru C.C. Pascal A.A. van Mourik F. Robert B. Horton P. van Grondelle R. van Amerongen H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1143-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Using an analogous approach as employed by us (but based on xanthophyll absorption) in LHC II a n = 1.54 was deduced (29Gruszecki W.I. Grudzinski W. Banaszek-Glos A. Matula M. Kernen P. Krupa Z. Sielewiesiuk J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Precise knowledge of n is crucial to calculate reliable rate constants for Förster-type EET kinetics due to inverse fourth-power dependence on n (for a detailed discussion see, for instance, Ref. 30Knox R.S. van Amerongen H. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2002; 106: 5289-5293Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Concluding Remarks—The present study shows that stepwise TPEF of Chls a and b is a suitable experimental tool to gain information on excitonic coupling of pigments in photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes, in particular under conditions of severe “spectral congestion”, cf. also Ref. 31Leupold D. Lokstein H. Scheer H. Grimm B. Porra R. Rüdiger W. Scheer H. Chlorophylls and Bacteriochlorophylls: Biochemistry, Biophysics, Functions, and Applications. 25. Springer, Dordrecht2006: 413-430Google Scholar). The TPEF line shapes, measured as a function of excitation wavelength in the Qy range, allow distinction between monomeric pigments, homodimers/-oligomers, and heterodimers/-oligomers in that particular spectral region. Future studies of TPEF may profit from a variation of excitation pulse duration: Laser pulses in the ps range can be used to improve spectral resolution (due to their much narrower pulse widths). On the other hand, pulses shorter than 100 fs would be of advantage to minimize the competing EET processes, in particular among Chl S1 states.

https://openalex.org/W2085755885,"The 'human topoisomerase I (htopoI) damage response' was reported to be triggered by various kinds of DNA lesions. Also, a high and persistent level of htopoI cleavage complexes correlated with apoptosis. In the present study, we demonstrate that DNA damage-independent induction of cell death using colcemid and tumor necrosis factor alpha is also accompanied by a strong htopoI response that correlates with the onset of apoptotic hallmarks. Consequently, these results suggest that htopoI cleavage complex formation may be caused by signaling pathways independent of the kind of cellular stress. Thus, protein interactions or signaling cascades induced by DNA damage or cellular stress might lead to the formation of stabilized cleavage complexes rather than the DNA lesion itself. Finally, we show that p53 not only plays a key role in the regulation of the htopoI response to UV-C irradiation but also to treatment with colcemid."
