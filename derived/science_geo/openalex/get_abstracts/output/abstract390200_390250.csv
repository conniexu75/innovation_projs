https://openalex.org/W1982334431,"Physiological Stat3 signaling is temporally restricted. In cancer, Stat3 activity is often persistently elevated and fosters progression through its effects on tumor cells and their microenvironment. This report identifies the reciprocal positive regulation of S1PR1 and Stat3 in tumors as a mechanism by which tumor cells and their environment crosstalk to maintain Stat3 activity. This persistent loop is required for tumor progression and metastasis and could be a potential therapeutic target to block oncogenic Stat3 signaling. Interleukin-6 (IL-6)-Janus kinase (JAK) signaling is viewed as crucial for persistent signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) activation in cancer. However, IL-6–induced STAT3 activation is normally transient. Here we identify a key mechanism for persistent STAT3 activation in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. We show that expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1), a G protein–coupled receptor for the lysophospholipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), is elevated in STAT3-positive tumors. STAT3 is a transcription factor for the S1pr1 gene. Reciprocally, enhanced S1pr1 expression activates STAT3 and upregulates Il6 gene expression, thereby accelerating tumor growth and metastasis in a STAT3-dependent manner. Silencing S1pr1 in tumor cells or immune cells inhibits tumor STAT3 activity, tumor growth and metastasis. S1P-S1PR1–induced STAT3 activation is persistent, in contrast to transient STAT3 activation by IL-6. S1PR1 activates STAT3 in part by upregulating JAK2 tyrosine kinase activity. We show that STAT3-induced S1PR1 expression, as well as the S1P-S1PR1 pathway reciprocal regulation of STAT3 activity, is a major positive feedback loop for persistent STAT3 activation in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment and for malignant progression."

https://openalex.org/W2079903460,"Minicircle DNA vectors are superior to plasmids for long-term transgene expression but are not in widespread use because of a laborious production process. Kay et al. present an improved protocol for generating minicircles that makes them a viable alternative to plasmids for gene transfer studies. Minicircle DNA vectors allow sustained transgene expression in quiescent cells and tissues. To improve minicircle production, we genetically modified Escherichia coli to construct a producer strain that stably expresses a set of inducible minicircle-assembly enzymes, ΦC31 integrase and I-SceI homing endonuclease. This bacterial strain produces purified minicircles in a time frame and quantity similar to those of routine plasmid DNA preparation, making it feasible to use minicircles in place of plasmids in mammalian transgene expression studies."
https://openalex.org/W2128776645,"Metabolic interactions between multiple cell types are difficult to model using existing approaches. Here we present a workflow that integrates gene expression data, proteomics data and literature-based manual curation to model human metabolism within and between different types of cells. Transport reactions are used to account for the transfer of metabolites between models of different cell types via the interstitial fluid. We apply the method to create models of brain energy metabolism that recapitulate metabolic interactions between astrocytes and various neuron types relevant to Alzheimer's disease. Analysis of the models identifies genes and pathways that may explain observed experimental phenomena, including the differential effects of the disease on cell types and regions of the brain. Constraint-based modeling can thus contribute to the study and analysis of multicellular metabolic processes in the human tissue microenvironment and provide detailed mechanistic insight into high-throughput data analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2030274279,"Understanding how molecular dynamics leads to cellular behaviours that ultimately sculpt organs and tissues is a major challenge not only in basic developmental biology but also in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Here we use live imaging to show that the basal surfaces of Drosophila follicle cells undergo a series of directional, oscillating contractions driven by periodic myosin accumulation on a polarized actin network. Inhibition of the actomyosin contractions or their coupling to extracellular matrix (ECM) blocked elongation of the whole tissue, whereas enhancement of the contractions exaggerated it. Myosin accumulated in a periodic manner before each contraction and was regulated by the small GTPase Rho, its downstream kinase, ROCK, and cytosolic calcium. Disrupting the link between the actin cytoskeleton and the ECM decreased the amplitude and period of the contractions, whereas enhancing cell-ECM adhesion increased them. In contrast, disrupting cell-cell adhesions resulted in loss of the actin network. Our findings reveal a mechanism controlling organ shape and an experimental model for the study of the effects of oscillatory actomyosin activity within a coherent cell sheet."
https://openalex.org/W2065748927,"IRGM is a human GTPase that triggers autophagy in response to pathogen infection. On Mycobacteria infection, IRGM binds the mitochondrial cardiolipin to induce mitochondrial fission and a general autophagy response. It can also trigger autophagy-independent mitochondria-mediated cell death. IRGM, a human immunity-related GTPase, confers autophagic defence against intracellular pathogens by an unknown mechanism. Here, we report an unexpected mode of IRGM action. IRGM demonstrated differential affinity for the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin, translocated to mitochondria, affected mitochondrial fission and induced autophagy. Mitochondrial fission was necessary for autophagic control of intracellular mycobacteria by IRGM. IRGM influenced mitochondrial membrane polarization and cell death. Overexpression of IRGMd, but not IRGMb splice isoforms, caused mitochondrial depolarization and autophagy-independent, but Bax/Bak-dependent, cell death. By acting on mitochondria, IRGM confers autophagic protection or cell death, explaining IRGM action both in defence against tuberculosis and in the damaging inflammation caused by Crohn's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2046784759,"Macrophage-derived radicals generated by the NADPH oxidase complex and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) participate in cytotoxic mechanisms against microorganisms. Nitric oxide (•NO) plays a central role in the control of acute infection by Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, and we have proposed that much of its action relies on macrophage-derived peroxynitrite (ONOO− + ONOOH) formation, a strong oxidant arising from the reaction of •NO with superoxide radical (O2̇̄). Herein, we have shown that internalization of T. cruzi trypomastigotes by macrophages triggers the assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex to yield O2̇̄ during a 60–90-min period. This does not interfere with IFN-γ-dependent iNOS induction and a sustained •NO production (∼24 h). The major mechanism for infection control via reactive species formation occurred when •NO and O2̇̄ were produced simultaneously, generating intraphagosomal peroxynitrite levels compatible with microbial killing. Moreover, biochemical and ultrastructural analysis confirmed cellular oxidative damage and morphological disruption in internalized parasites. Overexpression of cytosolic tryparedoxin peroxidase in T. cruzi neutralized macrophage-derived peroxynitrite-dependent cytotoxicity to parasites and favored the infection in an animal model. Collectively, the data provide, for the first time, direct support for the action of peroxynitrite as an intraphagosomal cytotoxin against pathogens and the premise that microbial peroxiredoxins facilitate infectivity via decomposition of macrophage-derived peroxynitrite.

Macrophages represent one of the first lines of defense against invading intracellular pathogens through their ability to recognize, ingest, and destroy microorganisms. The detection of infectious agents by pattern recognition receptors initiates signal transduction pathways, which leads to activation of the membrane-bound NADPH oxidase and induction of nitric-oxide synthase 2 (iNOS), 2The abbreviations used are iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; •NO, nitric oxide; O2̇̄, superoxide radical; •OH, hydroxyl radical; •NO2, nitrogen dioxide radical; CO3̇̄, carbonate radical; DHR, dihydrorhodamine; NBT, nitro blue tetrazolium; DAF-2DA, 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate; DPI, diphenyliodonium; l-NMMA, NG-monomethyl-l-arginine; TcCPX, T. cruzi cytosolic tryparedoxin peroxidase; MPO, myeloperoxidase; DMPO, 5,5-dimethylpyrroline-N-oxide; SOD, superoxide dismutase; dPBS, Dulbecco's PBS; DIC, differential interference contrast; RH 123, rhodamine 123. central components of oxidative-killing mechanisms. The NADPH oxidase complex is inactive in resting phagocytes and assembles upon stimulation, resulting in formation of antimicrobial superoxide radicals (O2̇̄) within the phagosome (1Babior B.M. J.

The univalent reduction of oxygen by NADPH oxidase occurs immediately after phagocytosis, yielding high rates of O2̇̄ for at least 90 min (3Alvarez M.N. Trujillo M. Radi R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 359: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Superoxide radical production can also result in the formation of H2O2 in the phagocytic vacuole either by spontaneous or extracellular SOD-catalyzed dismutation (4De Groote M.A. Ochsner U.A.

Macrophage cytotoxicity is enhanced by the presence of proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, which are secreted by natural killer cells (NK) in the first instance and by CD4+ T helper-1 (Th1) cells once a specific immune response against the pathogen is established (6Aliberti J.C.

Immun. 1996; 64: 128-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following cytokine activation, macrophages produce large amounts of nitric oxide (•NO) because of induction of iNOS (8Xie Q.W. Whisnant R.

In general terms, neither O2̇̄ nor •NO has been shown to be particularly cytotoxic per se, although the concomitant production of both radicals potentiates cytotoxicity (11Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L.

We and others have proposed that the concerted actions of phagosomal NADPH oxidase and iNOS leads to the formation of peroxynitrite, 3The term peroxynitrite refers to the sum of peroxynitrite anion (ONOO−) and peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH), pKa = 6.8 (20Radi R.

Because of its negative charge, the O2̇̄ radical (pKa = 4.8) remains within this organelle, whereas •NO, being a hydrophobic radical, diffuses from the cytosol or phagosomal membrane-associated iNOS (18Vodovotz Y. Russell D. Xie Q.W. Bogdan C. Nathan C. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2914-2925PubMed Google Scholar) into the phagocytic vacuole. The reaction between •NO and O2̇̄ yields peroxynitrite (19Nauser T. Koppenol W. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2002; 106: 4084-4086Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 20Radi R. Peluffo G. Alvarez M.N. Naviliat M. Cayota A. Free Radic. Biol.

Radi R. ACS Chem. Biol. 2009; 4: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite and peroxynitrite-derived radicals are capable of reacting with different biological targets including protein amino acid residues (e.g. thiol oxidation (22Quijano C. Alvarez B.

Med. 1996; 21: 855-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), reactions that can ultimately promote cell death by either apoptotic or necrotic pathways (27Szabó C. Ischiropoulos H. Radi R. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 662-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). The role of various oxidative mechanisms in the microbicidal activity of macrophages depends on a number of factors including, in the case of the oxidative mechanisms, a dynamic balance between the activation state of macrophages and the sensitivity of targets cells to oxidants (12Nathan C. Shiloh M.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 8841-8848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 28Piacenza L. Peluffo G. Alvarez M.N. Kelly J.M. Wilkinson S.R. Radi R. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the actual formation of peroxynitrite in the phagosome at levels that could be cytotoxic to invading microorganisms has remained elusive. Although in simple biochemical systems the reaction of •NO with O2̇̄ is very efficient, approaching the diffusion-controlled limit (21Ferrer-Sueta G. Radi R. ACS Chem. Biol. 2009; 4: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), in biological systems, competition reactions (e.g. SOD-catalyzed O2̇̄ dismutation) (4De Groote M.A. Ochsner U.A. Shiloh M.U. Nathan C. McCord J.M. Dinauer M.C. Libby S.J. Vazquez-Torres A. Xu Y. Fang F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 13997-14001Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), rapid diffusion of •NO across biomembranes (29Quijano C. Romero N. Radi R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 39: 728-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and temporal mismatch between •NO and O2̇̄ production (30Eu J.P. Liu L. Zeng M. Stamler J.S.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7536-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), among other factors, can preclude peroxynitrite formation. In addition, once formed, much of the peroxynitrite may be decomposed by reacting with noncritical targets and antioxidant enzymes (i.e. peroxiredoxins) (reviewed in Ref. 21Ferrer-Sueta G. Radi R. ACS Chem. Biol. 2009; 4: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), and therefore its potential cytotoxic effects are attenuated or even fully neutralized. Trypanosoma cruzi is an obligate intracellular pathogen responsible for Chagas disease. It has been estimated that 8 million people are currently infected by the parasite, with 20% of Latin America's population (109 million) at risk resulting in 41,000 new cases each year (33Rassi Jr., A. Rassi A. Marin-Neto J.A. Lancet. 2010; 375: 1388-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). Moreover, the disease is spreading worldwide as a result of migration (mammalian hosts and insect vectors), HIV co-infection, blood transfusion, and organ transplantation. During its life cycle, T. cruzi undergoes extensive morphological and biochemical changes; non-infective epimastigotes proliferate in the gut of the insect vector where they differentiate into the infective metacyclic trypomastigotes. When initially infecting a host, the metacyclic form invades mainly host macrophages, where they can be destroyed by host immune mechanisms, including phagocytosis, or transformed into replicative intracellular amastigotes. After several cycles of binary division, host cell disruption occurs, and infective forms access the bloodstream and are able to invade cells from any tissue, such as the myocardium, smooth muscle, and central nervous system. Biologically relevant levels of peroxynitrite are cytotoxic to non- infective epimastigote parasites (14Denicola A. Rubbo H. Rodríguez D. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments have revealed that peroxynitrite addition to T. cruzi epimastigotes results in severe alterations of energy charge, calcium homeostasis, and depletion of trypanothione, the main low molecular weight thiol found in trypanosomatids (34Thomson L. Denicola A. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have shown that macrophage-derived peroxynitrite has the capacity to diffuse and exert cytotoxicity against epimastigotes in co-culture experiments (13Alvarez M.N. Piacenza L. Irigoín F. Peluffo G. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 432: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Additionally, parasites overexpressing peroxiredoxins, antioxidant enzymes known to readily detoxify peroxynitrite (35Trujillo M. Budde H. Piñeyro M.D. Stehr M. Robello C. Flohé L. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34175-34182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 36Chen L. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 795-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and recently revealed as virulent factors in the human infection (37Piacenza L. Zago M.P. Peluffo G. Alvarez M.N. Basombrio M.A. Radi R. Int. J. Parasitol. 2009; 39: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), are resistant to this reactive species (28Piacenza L. Peluffo G. Alvarez M.N. Kelly J.M. Wilkinson S.R. Radi R. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As early as 1974, the central role of macrophage phagocytosis in the control of T. cruzi infection was determined (38Kierszenbaum F. Knecht E. Budzko D.B. Pizzimenti M.C. J. Immunol. 1974; 112: 1839-1844PubMed Google Scholar). Later, the importance of macrophages in in vivo infection was evidenced by experiments in which resistance to T. cruzi was associated with the production of IFN-γ and IL-12 in animal models (39Torrico F. Heremans H. Rivera M.T. Van Marck E. Billiau A. Carlier Y. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3626-3632PubMed Google Scholar, 40Oliveira M.A. Santiago H.C. Lisboa C.R. Ceravollo I.P. Trinchieri G. Gazzinelli R.T. Vieira L.Q. Exp. Parasitol. 2000; 95: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, early treatment with IFN-γ was able to reverse the course of infection (41McCabe R.E. Mullins B.T. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2384-2388PubMed Google Scholar, 42Wirth J.J. Kierszenbaum F. J.

Med. 1987; 166: 1734-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), presumably by controlling the early replication of parasites in host macrophages, with the participation of •NO (44Muñoz-Fernández M.A. Fernández M.A. Fresno M. Immunol. Lett. 1992; 33: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 45Roman-Campos D. Duarte H.L. Sales Jr., P.A. Natali A.J. Ropert C. Gazzinelli R.T. Cruz J.S. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2009; 104: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Macrophage-derived O2̇̄ production triggered by T. cruzi is a matter of debate, with discussion centered on the ability of trypomastigotes to activate NADPH oxidase (41McCabe R.E. Mullins B.T. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2384-2388PubMed Google Scholar, 46Cardoni R.L. Antunez M.I. Morales C. Nantes I.R. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1997; 56: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 47Tanaka Y. Tanowitz H. Bloom B.R. Infect. Immun. 1983; 41: 1322-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In regard to the modulation of •NO production, contradictory results have been reported; although a negative regulation of iNOS induction by epimastigotes has been proposed (48Stempin C. Giordanengo L. Gea S. Cerbán F. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2002; 72: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar, 49Stempin C.C. Garrido V.V. Dulgerian L.R. Cerbán F.M. Acta Trop. 2008; 106: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), experiments performed with trypomastigotes have shown potentiation of cytokine-mediated iNOS induction (50Bergeron M. Olivier M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 6271-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the occurrence of O2̇̄, •NO, and their reaction product, peroxynitrite, and how these reactive species participate independently or synergically in the ability of host macrophages to control T. cruzi infection require an unambiguous analysis. In this work, we first studied whether T. cruzi infection of activated macrophages results in the simultaneous production of •NO and O2̇̄ and leads to the intraphagosomal formation of peroxynitrite. We then evaluated the capacity of peroxynitrite versus that of •NO and O2̇̄ (and H2O2) alone to efficiently serve as cytotoxins to control the load of internalized parasites. Finally, we tested the role of the cytosolic parasite peroxiredoxin in neutralizing the effects of host cell-derived oxidants in vitro and in vivo with the possible consequent promotion of infectivity. The data presented herein assist in understanding the mechanisms of oxidant-dependent killing of internalized pathogens.

Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Briefly, epimastigotes were collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at 25 °C, washed three times in 10 ml of triatomine artificial urine medium (TAU: 190 mm NaCl, 17 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 8 mm phosphate, pH 6, and 0.035% sodium bicarbonate), and resuspended at a cell density of 3–5 × 108 cells ml−1. After 2 h of incubation at 28 °C, parasites were diluted in TAU-3AAG medium (TAU, pH 6, supplemented with three amino acids: 10 mm l-proline, 50 mm sodium l-glutamate, 2 mm sodium l-aspartate, and 10 mm glucose) at 3–5 × 106 cells ml−1. Cells were incubated for 96 h at 28 °C in 75-cm2 culture flasks in a horizontal position to allow adhesion of epimastigotes to the flask surface, an important step in enabling parasites to be transformed into the infective metacyclic trypomastigote stage (54Bonaldo M.C. Souto-Padron T. de Souza W. Goldenberg S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1349-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The murine macrophage cell line J774A.1 (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC-TIB-67)) was cultured in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units ml−1), streptomycin (100 mg l−1), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Macrophages were cultured in 24-well plates, and O2̇̄ production was assayed by chemiluminescence studies as described previously (13Alvarez M.N. Piacenza L. Irigoín F. Peluffo G. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 432: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, macrophages were incubated under different experimental conditions in Dulbecco's PBS (dPBS), pH 7.3, containing 5 mm glucose, 1 mm l-arginine, and 100 μm luminol; the time course of luminol chemiluminescence was followed for 100 min in a luminescence plate reader at 37 °C (Lumistar, BMG Labtechnologies). Macrophages were seeded in Lab-Tek tissue culture chamber slides (Nunc) and infected with T. cruzi metacyclic trypomastigotes (5:1, parasite:macrophage ratio) in dPBS containing 1 mg/ml NBT (55Baehner R.L. Boxer L.A. Davis J. Blood. 1976; 48: 309-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Slides were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, rinsed in warmed dPBS, fixed for 10 min in 4% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature, and stained with DAPI (5 μg ml−1). Cells that contained formazan-stained inclusions within phagocytic vacuoles were observed by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, and internalized trypomastigotes were evidenced by colocalization of the formazan deposits with DAPI fluorescence. Macrophage mitochondrial respiration and respiratory burst were evaluated using a high resolution electrode, Oxygraph 2K (Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria). Cells were cultured in 6-well plates and challenged with opsonised zymosan (56Baxter M.A. Leslie R.G. Reeves W.G. Immunology. 1983; 48: 657-665PubMed Google Scholar) or T. cruzi metacyclic trypomastigotes in DMEM. Interaction was synchronized by plate centrifugation (800 × g, 5 min), and following a 15-min incubation at 37 °C non-internalized zymosan or parasites were removed. Macrophages were resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in DMEM, and O2 consumption was recorded at 37 °C. The rate of oxygen consumption was calculated using DatLab 4.3 software (Oroboros Instruments) and was expressed as nmol O2 min−1/106 cells. Oxygen consumption inhibited by 1 mm potassium cyanide corresponds to mitochondrial respiration. The cyanide-insensitive fraction was inhibited by 100 μm DPI and corresponds to NADPH oxidase activity (57Hancock J.T. Jones O.T. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The induction of the macrophage iNOS was triggered by incubating the cells with 200–300 units ml−1 IFN-γ (Calbiochem) plus 3 μg ml−1 LPS (Sigma) for 5 h (3Alvarez M.N. Trujillo M. Radi R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 359: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). •NO production by unstimulated or IFN-γ/LPS-activated macrophages was evaluated in tissue culture. Cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/well in the presence or absence of T. cruzi epimastigotes or chemically differentiated metacyclic trypomastigotes (see above). Following incubation (for 24 h), supernatants were collected, and the concentration of nitrite (NO2−) was determined spectrophotometrically at 540 nm using the Griess method with NaNO2 as the standard (3Alvarez M.N. Trujillo M. Radi R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 359: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 58Granger D.L. Taintor R.R. Boockvar K.S. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 142-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophage-•NO production was also evaluated using the cell-permeable fluorescence probe 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF-2DA) (59Nakatsubo N. Kojima H. Kikuchi K. Nagoshi H. Hirata Y. Maeda D. Imai Y. Irimura T. Nagano T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). After 5 h of incubation with the iNOS inducers, the medium was replaced with dPBS with 5 mm glucose and 1 mm l-arginine containing 5 μm DAF-2DA. Probe oxidation was followed in a fluorescence plate reader at 37 °C (Fluostar, BMG Labtechnologies) with filters at λex = 485 nm and λem = 520 nm. Under our experimental conditions, the peroxynitrite-dependent reactions (60Roychowdhury S. Luthe A. Keilhoff G. Wolf G. Horn T.F. Glia. 2002; 38: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) did not interfere with the fluorophore. Macrophages were seeded in 6-well plates (5 × 106 cells/well) and infected at a 10:1 parasite:macrophage ratio. After 3 h of infection total RNA was extracted using the PureLinkTM Micro-to-MidiTM Total RNA purification system (Invitrogen), and a cDNA copy was obtained using the SuperScriptTM III first-strand system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). iNOS mRNA in each condition was amplified using the primers 5′-CTAAGAGTCACCAAAATGGCTCCC-3′ and 5′-ACCAGAGGCAGCACATCAAAGC-3′, which yielded an 875-bp band of murine iNOS. The housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was amplified to verify equal cDNA loading in each condition with the primers 5′-CTGAGAACGGGAAGCTTGTC-3′ and 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3′, which yielded a 600-bp band. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out using 5 μg of cDNA at an annealing temperature of 58 °C. PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel, fragments were visualized with ethidium bromide, and gels were registered with a digital Polaroid camera. Mice neutrophils, used as a positive control for MPO detection, were purified from peripheral blood as described (61Luo Y. Dorf M.E. Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2001; (Chapter 3, Unit 3.20, doi: 10.1002/0471142735.im0320s22)Google Scholar). For protein extraction, neutrophils and J774A-1 macrophages were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma). For immunoblotting, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore). The membrane was incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-human MPO antibody (Calbiochem) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody as the secondary antibody. The blots were developed with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The nitrocellulose membrane was stripped and reblotted with anti-actin antibody (Sigma). Metacyclic trypomastigotes were incubated for 20 min in dPBS, pH 7.4, containing 50 μm DHR for intracellular probe incorporation and washed twice in dPBS before the assay. Macrophages were infected with DHR-loaded metacyclic trypomastigotes for 30 min at 37 °C and washed in dPBS to remove non-internalized parasites. Intracellular rhodamine 123 (RH 123, oxidation product of DHR) formation under the different macrophage stimulation conditions was measured in a fluorescence plate reader at 37 °C (Fluostar, BMG Labtechnologies) with filters at λex = 485 nm and λem = 520 nm (3Alvarez M.N. Trujillo M. Radi R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 359: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To evaluate rhodamine localization, cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy, and digital photographs of infected macrophages were recorded. Macrophages cultured in Lab-Tek glass chamber slides were exposed to different conditions and then fixed in 4% formaldehyde at room temperature for 5 min. They were then rinsed in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS prior to primary antibody exposition. Immunodetection of iNOS expression was performed using a rabbit anti-iNOS (1:100) (Sigma). After copious washes, the slides were then incubated for 1 h with a secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen) diluted 1:500 in 0.005% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS. Immunodetection of 5,5-dimethylpyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO)-nitrone protein adducts on internalized parasites was performed using a rabbit anti-DMPO-nitrone serum that binds to the one-electron oxidation"
https://openalex.org/W2033643156,"Refined cancer models are required if researchers are to assess the burgeoning number of potential targets for cancer therapeutics in a clinically relevant context that allows a fast turnaround. Here we use tumor-associated genetic pathways to transform primary human epithelial cells from the epidermis, oropharynx, esophagus and cervix into genetically defined tumors in a human three-dimensional (3D) tissue environment that incorporates cell-populated stroma and intact basement membrane. These engineered organotypic tissues recapitulated natural features of tumor progression, including epithelial invasion through basement membrane, a complex process that is necessary for biological malignancy in 90% of human cancers. Invasion was rapid and was potentiated by stromal cells. Oncogenic signals in 3D tissue, but not 2D culture, resembled gene expression profiles from spontaneous human cancers. We screened 3D organotypic neoplasia with well-characterized signaling pathway inhibitors to distill a clinically faithful cancer gene signature. Multitissue 3D human tissue cancer models may provide an efficient and relevant complement to current approaches to characterizing cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2140389587,"In protein conformational disorders ranging from Alzheimer to Parkinson disease, proteins of unrelated sequence misfold into a similar array of aggregated conformers ranging from small oligomers to large amyloid fibrils. Substantial evidence suggests that small, prefibrillar oligomers are the most toxic species, yet to what extent they can be selectively targeted and remodeled into non-toxic conformers using small molecules is poorly understood. We have evaluated the conformational specificity and remodeling pathways of a diverse panel of aromatic small molecules against mature soluble oligomers of the Aβ42 peptide associated with Alzheimer disease. We find that small molecule antagonists can be grouped into three classes, which we herein define as Class I, II, and III molecules, based on the distinct pathways they utilize to remodel soluble oligomers into multiple conformers with reduced toxicity. Class I molecules remodel soluble oligomers into large, off-pathway aggregates that are non-toxic. Moreover, Class IA molecules also remodel amyloid fibrils into the same off-pathway structures, whereas Class IB molecules fail to remodel fibrils but accelerate aggregation of freshly disaggregated Aβ. In contrast, a Class II molecule converts soluble Aβ oligomers into fibrils, but is inactive against disaggregated and fibrillar Aβ. Class III molecules disassemble soluble oligomers (as well as fibrils) into low molecular weight species that are non-toxic. Strikingly, Aβ non-toxic oligomers (which are morphologically indistinguishable from toxic soluble oligomers) are significantly more resistant to being remodeled than Aβ soluble oligomers or amyloid fibrils. Our findings reveal that relatively subtle differences in small molecule structure encipher surprisingly large differences in the pathways they employ to remodel Aβ soluble oligomers and related aggregated conformers.

IntroductionA central tenet of protein folding is that a given amino acid sequence encodes a single folded structure (1Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5079) Google Scholar). By analogy, one would expect that a given protein sequence would encode a single misfolded structure (e.g. a single amyloid fibril conformation). Instead, each protein sequence encodes numerous aggregated isoforms that possess unique secondary and tertiary structures (2Frost B. Ollesch J. Wille H. Diamond M.I. J. Biol.

Previous work has firmly established that small, prefibrillar conformers (herein referred to as soluble oligomers) of diverse polypeptides are the most toxic aggregates both in vitro and in vivo (11Campioni S.

However, elucidating the structural attributes of such toxic conformers that differentiate them from their non-toxic counterparts has proven difficult (see Refs. 11Campioni S. Mannini B. Zampagni M.

Chem. 2007; 2: 1674-1692Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar, and references therein). A general conclusion of these studies is that many small molecules redirect the aggregation cascade rather than inhibiting it completely (26Kodali R. Wetzel R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In hindsight, this finding is logical based on the large amount of buried surface area within protein aggregates compared with the small size of inhibitor molecules (27Roberts B.E. Shorter J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Wells J.A. McClendon C.L. Nature. 2007; 450: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). Therefore, using small molecules to alter the nucleation pathway by disrupting specific intermolecular contacts or promoting atypical ones appears to be a more feasible approach to preventing formation of toxic aggregates than antagonizing all possible intermolecular contacts.Much less is known about the capacity of small molecules to remodel mature protein aggregates (see Refs. 12Ladiwala A.R. Lin J.C. Bale S.S. Marcelino-Cruz A.M. Bhattacharya M. Dordick J.S. Tessier P.M. J. Biol.

This is surprising because it is more complex to understand how small molecules alter the aggregation of monomers where proteins necessarily undergo conformational change (unless prevented by small molecules) than it is in the reverse direction where mature aggregated conformers can be isolated that do not change structurally during experimentally relevant time scales. Nevertheless, difficulties in forming homogeneous populations of different aggregated conformers and discriminating between them have hampered mechanistic studies of protein disaggregation.

In fact, these and related studies suggest that conversion of soluble oligomers into high molecular weight aggregates may be a common remodeling pathway employed by other small molecules. Nevertheless, small molecules may neutralize the toxicity of mature Aβ soluble oligomers via other mechanisms as well (38Necula M. Breydo L. Milton S. Kayed R. van der Veer W.E. Tone P. Glabe C.G.

Herein, we demonstrate that diverse aromatic small molecules utilize three independent pathways to remodel mature Aβ soluble oligomers into benign conformers with highly dissimilar biochemical properties.DISCUSSIONOur findings illuminate multiple pathways employed by small molecules to remodel soluble oligomers of Aβ42 (Fig. 8). Indeed, even in the absence of small molecule antagonists, we have reported previously that Aβ soluble oligomers are not committed to a single nucleation pathway (12Ladiwala A.R. Lin J.C. Bale S.S. Marcelino-Cruz A.M. Bhattacharya M. Dordick J.S. Tessier P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 24228-24237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Instead, soluble oligomers can mature into multiple Aβ conformers (fibrillar intermediates and non-toxic oligomers) that possess highly dissimilar biochemical properties, and each conformer can be formed in a specific manner via simple changes in agitation. This multifaceted capacity of Aβ soluble oligomers to mature into different isoforms is consistent with our findings that small molecules can remodel soluble oligomers into conformers with significantly different sizes and structures. That only four of the small molecules investigated in this work remodel mature Aβ fibrils (whereas all seven remodel soluble oligomers) highlights the conformational plasticity of soluble oligomers to evolve into diverse conformers.Our results for Class I molecules confirm that converting soluble oligomers into large, unstructured aggregates is a common pathway for remodeling toxic oligomers. We reason that it is simpler to promote nonspecific intermolecular interactions between Aβ peptides within soluble oligomers than it is to promote specific ones necessary for fibril formation or to prevent all possible intermolecular interactions. Studies of small molecule inhibitors of protein aggregation also support our findings because many such antagonists promote alternative, unstructured aggregates rather than preventing condensation of protein monomers (30Wang H. Duennwald M.L. Roberts B.E. Rozeboom L.M. Zhang Y.L. Steele A.D. Krishnan R. Su L.J. Griffin D. Mukhopadhyay S. Hennessy E.J. Weigele P. Blanchard B.J. King J. Deniz A.A. Buchwald S.L. Ingram V.M.

Wanker E.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar).Nevertheless, we found that a Class II molecule (methylene blue) selectively converts soluble oligomers into fibrils, which is consistent with previous work (38Necula M. Breydo L. Milton S. Kayed R. van der Veer W.E. Tone P. Glabe C.G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8850-8860Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Importantly, methylene blue fails to remodel amyloid fibrils within 24 h or accelerate aggregation of freshly disaggregated Aβ within 4 h (longer times not tested). Thus, the primary activity of methylene blue is to accelerate the conversion of Aβ oligomers into fibrillar conformers. Because a key structural difference between Aβ soluble oligomers and fibrils is the presence of β-sheets, it is possible that Class II molecules facilitate mature self-stacking interactions between residues necessary for β-sheet formation. Alternatively, Class II molecules may accelerate conversion of soluble oligomers into fibrils by inhibiting nonspecific interactions sampled within Aβ soluble oligomers that govern assembly of non-toxic oligomers.The conformational specificity of methylene blue to remodel Aβ soluble oligomers into fibrils makes it and related variants potential drug candidates to evaluate the hypothesis that Aβ soluble oligomers are the primary cellular insult in Alzheimer disease. The therapeutic activity of many small molecules for remodeling toxic Aβ oligomers is limited because they do not cross the blood-brain barrier. In contrast, methylene blue crosses the blood-brain barrier, and possesses many other desirable drug properties, including high solubility and low toxicity (46Peter C. Hongwan D. Küpfer A. Lauterburg B.H. Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 2000; 56: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 47Küpfer A. Aeschlimann C. Wermuth B. Cerny T.

Indeed, methylene blue and derivatives of it are currently being evaluated as therapeutic candidates to treat Alzheimer disease (49Gura T. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 894Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Given that many small molecule antagonists fail to disaggregate mature Aβ soluble oligomers and fibrils into low molecular weight species (including the Class I and II molecules studied here), the activity of Class III molecules is intriguing. Tannic acid was the most active small molecule we studied (which is consistent with previous work (41Ono K. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Yamada M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1690: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 50Boyé-Harnasch M. Cullin C. J. Biotechnol. 2006; 125: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 51Kocisko D.A. Baron G.S. Rubenstein R. Chen J. Kuizon S. Caughey B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 10288-10294Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar)), and it appears that its large size enciphers this activity. However, the remarkable disaggregation activity of piceid is more difficult to explain. Piceid was found previously to partially disaggregate oligomers and amyloids of a more soluble Aβ peptide fragment (residues 25–35; neither Aβ conformer was confirmed with A11 or OC antibodies) (40Rivière C. Delaunay J.C. Immel F. Cullin C. Monti J.P. Neurochem. Res. 2009; 34: 1120-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, its disaggregation activity for A11-positive soluble oligomers and OC-positive fibrils of Aβ42 was unexpected not only because the full-length peptide is significantly more aggregation-prone, but also because piceid is closely related to another polyphenol (resveratrol) that converts Aβ oligomers and fibrils into large off-pathway aggregates (12Ladiwala A.R. Lin J.C. Bale S.S. Marcelino-Cruz A.M. Bhattacharya M. Dordick J.S. Tessier P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 24228-24237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Because piceid is identical to resveratrol except for the 3-O-β-glucosidic moiety, it appears that the sugar moiety is an important determinant of its disaggregation activity. Future structure-activity analysis is necessary to resolve whether the stilbenoid backbone is important for the disaggregation activity of piceid and whether other phenolic glycosides possess similar disaggregation activity.Are there additional pathways by which aromatic small molecules remodel toxic soluble oligomers into non-toxic assemblies? Indeed, we expect that several other pathways are possible. For example, soluble oligomers could be converted into various types of fibrillar conformers other than fibrils or precipitated into large aggregates without structural changes (thereby reducing toxicity due to increased size). Moreover, some aromatic small molecules modify polypeptides covalently (52Zhu M. Rajamani S. Kaylor J. Han S. Zhou F. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26846-26857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 53Meng X. Munishkina L.A. Fink A.L. Uversky V.N. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 8206-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and are likely to remodel mature soluble oligomers through unique pathways not considered here.A puzzling finding of our work is that Class IA polyphenols selectivity remodel Aβ soluble oligomers and fibrils into indistinguishable, unstructured aggregates with identical dose dependence. A simple explanation would be that soluble oligomers and fibrils possess common structural features recognized by Class IA molecules. However, we were unable to demonstrate a single biochemical property shared by these two conformers. We find that Aβ soluble oligomers are A11-positive, OC-negative, ThT-negative, SDS-soluble, highly toxic and largely unstructured, whereas fibrils possess the “opposite” properties (i.e. they are A11-negative, OC-positive, ThT-positive, SDS-insoluble, mildly toxic and β-sheet rich). Because polyphenols are suspected to antagonize π-stacking interactions between aromatic side chains in amyloids (54Gazit E. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), it may be that such side chains stack in soluble oligomers (despite that they lack mature β-sheets detectable by circular dichroism) as they do in Aβ fibrillar oligomers and fibrils (21Wu J.W. Breydo L. Isas J.M. Lee J. Kuznetsov Y.G. Langen R. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 6071-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 55Margittai M. Langen R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 41: 265-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Such stacking interactions between aromatic side chains of Aβ may render soluble oligomers and fibrils sensitive to being remodeled by polyphenols. It is also possible that Class IA molecules recognize other structural motifs that may be common to soluble oligomers and fibrils, such as sheet-like structures in both prefibrillar oligomers (α-pleated (56Armen R.S.

Biophys. 2008; 41: 265-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) or anti-parallel (60Tycko R. Sciarretta K.L. Orgel J.P. Meredith S.C. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6072-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) β-sheets), although additional analysis is needed to test these speculative hypotheses.A striking finding of our work is that non-toxic oligomers are more resistant to being remodeled by diverse aromatic small molecules than all other Aβ conformers, including highly stable Aβ fibrils. A possible explanation is that non-toxic oligomers lack aromatic stacking interactions, which allows them to more effectively evade the remodeling activity of the small molecules studied in this work. This hypothesis would also predict that substituting aromatic amino acids for non-aromatic ones would desensitize soluble oligomers to the remodeling activity of polyphenols. However, it is also possible that Aβ non-toxic oligomers are simply more stable than other Aβ conformers (61Lee S. Fernandez E.J. Good T.A. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which would also explain their increased resistance to being remodeled by diverse aromatic molecules.It is notable that two oligomeric forms of a non-disease associated protein (HypF) have been reported to also possess unique toxicities (11Campioni S. Mannini B. Zampagni M. Pensalfini A. Parrini C. Evangelisti E. Relini A. Stefani M. Dobson C.M. Cecchi C. Chiti F. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Similar to Aβ soluble and non-toxic oligomers reported here, the N-terminal domain of HypF (denoted HypF-N) forms two oligomeric forms, one of which is toxic. Chiti and co-workers (11Campioni S. Mannini B. Zampagni M. Pensalfini A. Parrini C. Evangelisti E. Relini A. Stefani M. Dobson C.M. Cecchi C. Chiti F. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the toxic conformer is less structured, which is generally consistent with our findings that soluble oligomers are less stable than non-toxic oligomers (as judged by SDS resistance). However, both HypF-N oligomers bind ThT and possess extensive β-sheets, confirming that they are fibrillar intermediates rather than prefibrillar oligomers. In contrast, we find that Aβ soluble and non-toxic oligomers possess random coil structures (as judged by circular dichroism) and, thus, the relevance of these and related (62Nekooki-Machida Y. Kurosawa M. Nukina N. Ito K. Oda T. Tanaka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 9679-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) observations remains to be evaluated for Aβ soluble and non-toxic oligomers. We expect that future site-specific structural studies of Aβ toxic and non-toxic oligomers will illuminate the structural differences between these oligomers that confer their unique toxicities and susceptibilities to being remodeling by aromatic small molecules. IntroductionA central tenet of protein folding is that a given amino acid sequence encodes a single folded structure (1Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5079) Google Scholar). By analogy, one would expect that a given protein sequence would encode a single misfolded structure (e.g. a single amyloid fibril conformation). Instead, each protein sequence encodes numerous aggregated isoforms that possess unique secondary and tertiary structures (2Frost B. Ollesch J. Wille H. Diamond M.I. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2073935838,"Binding of target-derived neurotrophins to Trk receptors at nerve terminals is required to stimulate neuronal survival, differentiation, innervation and synaptic plasticity. The distance between the soma and nerve terminal is great, making efficient anterograde Trk transport critical for Trk synaptic translocation and signaling. The mechanism responsible for this trafficking remains poorly understood. Here we show that the sorting receptor sortilin interacts with TrkA, TrkB and TrkC and enables their anterograde axonal transport, thereby enhancing neurotrophin signaling. Cultured DRG neurons lacking sortilin showed blunted MAP kinase signaling and reduced neurite outgrowth upon stimulation with NGF. Moreover, deficiency for sortilin markedly aggravated TrkA, TrkB and TrkC phenotypes present in p75(NTR) knockouts, and resulted in increased embryonic lethality and sympathetic neuropathy in mice heterozygous for TrkA. Our findings demonstrate a role for sortilin as an anterograde trafficking receptor for Trk and a positive modulator of neurotrophin-induced neuronal survival."

To address these questions, we purified dynein from wild-type mice and the Legs at odd angles mutant mice. Using biochemical, single-molecule, and live-cell-imaging techniques, we find a marked inhibition of motor run-length in vitro and in vivo, and significantly altered motor domain coordination in the dynein from mutant mice. These results suggest a potential role for the dynein tail in motor function, and provide direct evidence for a link between single-motor processivity and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2069724914,"Exploratory behaviors during learning determine what is studied and when, helping to optimize subsequent memory performance. To elucidate the cognitive and neural determinants of exploratory behaviors, we manipulated the control that human subjects had over the position of a moving window through which they studied objects and their locations. Our behavioral, neuropsychological and neuroimaging data indicate that volitional control benefits memory performance and is linked to a brain network that is centered on the hippocampus. Increases in correlated activity between the hippocampus and other areas were associated with specific aspects of memory, which suggests that volitional control optimizes interactions among specialized neural systems through the hippocampus. Memory is therefore an active process that is intrinsically linked to behavior. Furthermore, brain structures that are typically seen as passive participants in memory encoding (for example, the hippocampus) are actually part of an active network that controls behavior dynamically as it unfolds."
https://openalex.org/W2020238484,"IL-22 has a pathogenetic role in psoriasis, where it is responsible for the altered proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes and induces inflammatory molecules. The IL-22-induced effects are mediated by STAT3, whose activity is proportional to acetylation in lysine (Lys)685 and phosphorylation in tyrosine (Tyr)705. Lys 685 acetylation of STAT3 is inhibited by sirtuin (SIRT)1, a class III deacetylase promoting keratinocyte differentiation. Due to the opposite effects of IL-22 and SIRT1, we investigated whether IL-22-induced effects in keratinocytes could be regulated by SIRT1 through control of STAT3. We found that SIRT1 opposes the IL-22-induced STAT3 activity by deacetylating STAT3 and reducing STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation. By controlling STAT3, SIRT1 also influences the IL-22-induced expression of molecules involved in proliferation and inflammation as well as proliferation and migration processes in cultured keratinocytes. Although SIRT1 levels were similar in keratinocytes of healthy individuals and patients with psoriasis, they were reduced in psoriatic skin lesions, with the lymphokine IFN-γ inhibiting SIRT1 expression. Concomitantly, IFN-γ enhanced basal acetylation of STAT3 and its phosphorylation induced by IL-22. In conclusion, STAT3-dependent IL-22 signaling and effects in keratinocytes are negatively regulated by SIRT1. In skin affected by psoriasis, SIRT1 is down-regulated by IFN-y, which thus renders psoriatic keratinocytes more prone to respond to IL-22.—Sestito, R., Madonna, S., Scarponi, C., Cianfarani, F., Failla, C.

Proteasome dysfunction has been observed in experimental cardiomyopathies and implicated in human congestive heart failure. Measures to enhance proteasome proteolytic function are currently lacking but would be beneficial in testing the pathogenic role of proteasome dysfunction and could have significant therapeutic potential. The association of proteasome activator 28 (PA28) with the 20S proteasome may play a role in antigen processing. It is unclear, however, whether the PA28 plays any important role outside of antigen presentation, although up-regulation of PA28 has been observed in certain types of cardiomyopathy. Here, we show that PA28α overexpression (PA28αOE) stabilized PA28β, increased 11S proteasomes, and enhanced the degradation of a previously validated proteasome surrogate substrate (GFPu) in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. PA28αOE significantly attenuated H2O2-induced increases in the protein carbonyls and markedly suppressed apoptosis in cultured cardiomyocytes under basal conditions or when stressed by H2O2. We conclude that PA28αOE is sufficient to up-regulate 11S proteasomes, enhance proteasome-mediated removal of misfolded and oxidized proteins, and protect against oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes, providing a highly sought means to increase proteasomal degradation of abnormal cellular proteins.—Li, J., Powell, S.

https://openalex.org/W2045506400,"Cyclic AMP is known to affect RAF–MEK–ERK signalling, but the precise mechanism has remained unknown. An interaction between AKAP-Lbc and the scaffolding protein KSR1 is now shown to tie cAMP production to ERK pathway regulation. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades propagate a variety of cellular activities1. Processive relay of signals through RAF–MEK–ERK modulates cell growth and proliferation2,3. Signalling through this ERK cascade is frequently amplified in cancers, and drugs such as sorafenib (which is prescribed to treat renal and hepatic carcinomas) and PLX4720 (which targets melanomas) inhibit RAF kinases4,5. Natural factors that influence ERK1/2 signalling include the second messenger cyclic AMP6,7. However, the mechanisms underlying this cascade have been difficult to elucidate. We demonstrate that the A-kinase-anchoring protein AKAP-Lbc and the scaffolding protein kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR-1) form the core of a signalling network that efficiently relay signals from RAF, through MEK, and on to ERK1/2. AKAP-Lbc functions as an enhancer of ERK signalling by securing RAF in the vicinity of MEK1 and synchronizing protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of Ser 838 on KSR-1. This offers mechanistic insight into cAMP-responsive control of ERK signalling events."

Here, we demonstrate that de novo lipogenesis, an insulin-dependent process driven by the multifunctional enzyme fatty-acid synthase (FAS), maintains endothelial function by targeting endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) to the plasma membrane. In mice with endothelial inactivation of FAS (FASTie mice), eNOS membrane content and activity were decreased. eNOS and FAS were physically associated; eNOS palmitoylation was decreased in FAS-deficient cells, and incorporation of labeled carbon into eNOS-associated palmitate was FAS-dependent. FASTie mice manifested a proinflammatory state reflected as increases in vascular permeability, endothelial inflammatory markers, leukocyte migration, and susceptibility to LPS-induced death that was reversed with an NO donor. FAS-deficient endothelial cells showed deficient migratory capacity, and angiogenesis was decreased in FASTie mice subjected to hindlimb ischemia. Insulin induced FAS in endothelial cells freshly isolated from humans, and eNOS palmitoylation was decreased in mice with insulin-deficient or insulin-resistant diabetes. Thus, disrupting eNOS bioavailability through impaired lipogenesis identifies a novel mechanism coordinating nutritional status and tissue repair that may contribute to diabetic vascular disease."

In this study, we show that phosphorylation of CLEC-2 by the snake toxin rhodocytin is abolished in the absence of the tyrosine kinase Syk but is not altered in the absence of the major platelet Src family kinases, Fyn, Lyn, and Src, or the tyrosine phosphatase CD148, which regulates the basal activity of Src family kinases. Further, phosphorylation of CLEC-2 by rhodocytin is not altered in the presence of the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2, even though PLCγ2 phosphorylation and platelet activation are abolished. A similar dependence of phosphorylation of CLEC-2 on Syk is also seen in response to stimulation by an IgG mAb to CLEC-2, although interestingly CLEC-2 phosphorylation is also reduced in the absence of Lyn. These results provide the first definitive evidence that Syk mediates phosphorylation of the CLEC-2 hemITAM receptor with Src family kinases playing a critical role further downstream through the regulation of Syk and other effector proteins, providing a new paradigm in signaling by YXXL-containing receptors."

We show that the “on” and “off” conformations of the allosteric switch can also be attained in RasG12V and RasQ61L. Although both mutants have similarly impaired active sites in the on state, RasQ61L stabilizes an anti-catalytic conformation of switch II in the off state of the allosteric switch when bound to Raf.

Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), and of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) 2The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GppNHp, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; PDB, Protein Data Bank; Raf_RBD_CRD, construct containing the two Ras binding domains of c-Raf, the Ras binding domain (RBD), and the cysteine-rich domain (CRD). that increase the intrinsically slow GTPase activity of Ras for timely depletion of Ras-GTP (9Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmüller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). We have recently discovered a mechanism through which the active site of Ras can be modulated by ligand binding at an allosteric site near the Ras-membrane interface, suggesting a GAP-independent mechanism through which hydrolysis rates could be increased (10Buhrman G. Holzapfel G. Fetics S. Mattos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4931-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The binding of calcium and a negatively charged ligand, mimicked in our Ras-GppNHp crystal structure by an acetate molecule, promote a network of H-bonding interactions that connect the allosteric site to switch II, resulting in a disorder to order transition that positions key residues for catalysis (10Buhrman G. Holzapfel G. Fetics S. Mattos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4931-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Thus, an “on” state of the allosteric switch implies increased hydrolysis rates associated with signaling being turned off. When the allosteric switch is “off,” GTP hydrolysis is impaired and signaling remains on. The active site residues are situated primarily in the so-called switch I, switch II, and the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) composed of residues 30–40, 60–76, and 10–17, respectively (11Milburn M.V. Tong L. deVos A.M. Brünger A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.H. Science. 1990; 247: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). In particular, mutants of residues Gly12 in the P-loop and Gln61 in switch II are often highly oncogenic and have been the focus of numerous structural biology (12Franken S.M. Scheidig A.J.

The dissociative-like reaction mechanism observed in the presence and absence of GAP (22Du X. Black G.E. Lecchi P. Abramson F.P. Sprang S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Admiraal S.J. Herschlag D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 8160-8166Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Stabilization of this charge in the GAP-catalyzed reaction is aided by the arginine finger (Arg789), which GAP inserts in the active site, and the ordering of both switch I and switch II at the Ras/RasGAP interface (9Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmüller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). The Ras-GppNHp crystal form in which wild type and most mutant Ras proteins have been studied until recently have symmetry of the space group P3221, and the active site has a conformation similar to that found in the Ras-GppNHp-RasGAP complex (25Buhrman G. de Serrano V. Mattos C. Structure. 2003; 11: 747-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The structures of RasG12V and RasQ61L in this crystal form reveal active sites that are very similar in conformation to the wild type structure and give insight into how these mutants interfere with the GAP-catalyzed reaction (13Krengel U.

These structures do not account for an effect on the active site configured by the allosteric switch and the resulting consequences for intrinsic hydrolysis in the Ras-Raf complex. All known effector protein-binding sites on Ras overlap with that for GAPs and most interact with micromolar affinities similar to that for the Ras/RasGAP interaction (5Pacold M.E. Suire S.

The striking exception is the effector Raf, which mediates signaling through the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signal transduction cascade linked directly to the control of cell proliferation (2McCubrey J.A. Steelman L.S. Chappell W.H. Abrams S.L. Wong E.W. Chang F. Lehmann B. Terrian D.M. Milella M. Tafuri A. Stivala F. Libra M. Basecke J. Evangelisti C. Martelli A.M. Franklin R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1263-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). The Raf-binding site overlaps with that for GAP through switch I but not switch II (4Thapar R. Williams J.G. Campbell S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 1391-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), yet its affinity to Ras is 3.5 nm (29Minato T. Wang J. Akasaka K. Okada T. Suzuki N. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20845-20851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 3 orders of magnitude greater than the 2 μm Ras affinity for p120GAP (27Martin G.A. Viskochil D. Bollag G. McCabe P.C.

Marshall M.S. Scolnick E.M. Sigal I.S. Gibbs J.B. Nature. 1988; 335: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Thus, although effectors such as PI3K could be easily displaced by GAP, we propose that the timing of the Ras/Raf interaction is controlled by intrinsic hydrolysis where switch I is modulated by the binding of Raf, and switch II is positioned for catalysis by the allosteric switch (10Buhrman G. Holzapfel G. Fetics S. Mattos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4931-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In this case, switch I residue Tyr32 is situated in a position similar to that of the GAP arginine finger, where it interacts with a water molecule (WAT189) that bridges it to the γ-phosphate of GTP (PDB code 3K8Y). Gln61 is positioned by the allosteric switch to interact with this same water molecule, which could receive a proton and develop a partial positive charge near the β-γ-bridging oxygen atom of GTP during catalysis. We propose that WAT189, aided by Tyr32 and Gln61, is a critical element in stabilizing the transition state of the reaction catalyzed by Ras in the absence of GAP when the allosteric switch is in the on state (10Buhrman G. Holzapfel G. Fetics S. Mattos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4931-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The details of the mechanism proposed based on this active site conformation were derived from our structure of wild type Ras-GppNHp obtained from a crystal of symmetry R32, where switch I and active site water molecules are as found in the Raps-GppNHp-RafRBD complex (30Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Block C. Janknecht R. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Our published structure of RasQ61L-GppNHp in this crystal form has a switch II that closes over the nucleotide with Leu61 at the center of a hydrophobic cluster that isolates the γ-phosphate from bulk solvent (31Buhrman G. Wink G. Mattos C. Structure. 2007; 15: 1618-1629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Based on this structure, we predicted that the hydrolysis rate in RasQ61L is severely impaired by Raf. We suggested then that it is in the presence of Raf that this mutant exerts its potently transforming phenotype, because Raf stabilizes a switch I conformation that is critical to the hydrophobic cluster. In this work, we provide evidence that our interpretation of the role of Raf in relation to the RasQ61L mutant is functionally relevant in cells. We use structural analysis and in vitro hydrolysis experiments to show that the G12V and Q61L mutations perturb the on state active site in similar ways but that in the presence of Raf the accessibility to a catalytically competent, albeit impaired, conformation is greatly diminished in RasQ61L but unaffected in RasG12V under conditions lacking an activator of the allosteric switch. We then show that RasG12V and RasQ61L exhibit distinct behavior in terms of MEK and ERK but not Akt phosphorylation in signaling involving the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways in NIH-3T3 cells. Structural features of switch I, switch II, and the allosteric switch in the two mutants correlate with their behavior in vivo. Taken together, the structural biology, kinetics, and cell biology experiments presented here point to the Ras-Raf complex as timing the signal through the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, modulated by the Ras allosteric switch. C-terminally truncated H-Ras, consisting of residues 1–166, cloned into the pET21 expression vector was used for generating the RasG12V mutant with the QuikChange II kit from Stratagene, following the manufacturer's instructions. RasQ61L had been obtained previously in our laboratory (31Buhrman G. Wink G. Mattos C. Structure. 2007; 15: 1618-1629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Expression, purification, and nucleotide exchange for loading the GTP analog GppNHp in both RasG12V and RasQ61L were as described previously for the wild type protein (25Buhrman G. de Serrano V. Mattos C. Structure. 2003; 11: 747-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Crystals of RasG12V-GppNHp with the allosteric switch in either the on or off states were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method in 24-well plates with drops containing 3 μl of protein and 3 μl of reservoir solutions. In both cases, crystals grew in about 2 weeks at 18 °C. The protein was prepared in stabilization buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm DTT) at 12 and 14.4 mg/ml for the on and off states, respectively. For crystals of the on state, the reservoir solution consisted of 500 ml of 200 mm calcium acetate and 20% PEG 3350 (Hampton Research PEG Ion Screen number 28). Crystals were transferred to a solution containing stabilization buffer plus 15% glycerol, 20% PEG 3350, and 200 mm calcium acetate before flash freezing for data collection. For crystals in the off state, the reservoir solution contained 400 μl of 200 mm calcium chloride, 20% PEG 3350 (Hampton Research PEG Ion Screen number 7), 120–160 μl of stabilization buffer, and 0–30 μl of 50% PEG 3350. Prior to flash freezing, crystals were placed in a solution consisting of 80% PEG Ion Screen number 7 (Hampton Research) and 20% PEG 400. Crystals of RasQ61L-GppNHp with the allosteric switch in the on state were obtained by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method in 96-well plates (3-well Intelli-PlateTM, ARI) with drops containing 1 μl of protein and 1 μl of reservoir solutions. The protein was at a concentration of 12 mg/ml in stabilization buffer. The reservoir solution contained 365 mm calcium acetate and 24% PEG 3350 in stabilization buffer. Crystal trays were set using a Phoenix crystallization robot (ARI). Crystals grew in about 1 week at 18 °C and were transferred to a buffer containing 80% reservoir solution and 20% PEG 400 before flash freezing for data collection. Synchrotron data were collected for the three structures at a temperature of 100 K and x-ray wavelength of 1.0 Å at the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) beamline, Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne, IL. Data were processed with HKL2000 (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar) and structures refined with PHENIX (33Adams P.D.

The c-Raf construct used to test the effects of Raf on the hydrolysis rates of RasG12V and RasQ61L includes both the Ras binding domain and cysteine-rich Ras-binding domain (residues 52–184) fused at the N terminus to residues 1–56 of the immunoglobulin-binding domain of streptococcal protein G (GB1).

The standard deviations from the mean are given in each case. Because the rates of intrinsic hydrolysis for RasG12V and RasQ61L are too slow for the reaction to go to completion in the time frame where single turnover conditions are unaffected, mutant hydrolysis experiments were run side by side with wild type Ras hydrolysis, and the final count for mutant hydrolysis was obtained by counting the total radioactivity of a given aliquot, without charcoal treatment, normalized by 100% wild type Ras hydrolysis counts.TABLE 2Hydrolysis rates for Ras, RasG12V, and RasQ61L in the absence and presence of RafRasRaf_RBD_CRD1/t0Standard deviationRate WT/Rate measuredmin−1Wild typeNo0.015650.001711Yes0.016000.001801G12VNo0.001370.0003311Yes0.001360.0003711Q61LNo0.000610.0000226YesNot measurableaThe radioactivity counts measured for RasQ61L in the presence of Raf do not change with time in the first 40 min where one would expect a linear response and are within the background level obtained in control experiments where Ras is replaced by Raf in our protocol.

NIH-3T3 cells were serially infected with retrovirus bearing empty pBM-IRES-Puro vector or vector carrying the indicated full-length H-Ras variants and selected using puromycin prior to each experiment, as described previously (35Kaur H.

Blots comparing lysates prepared on the same day were performed in parallel and exposed at the same time. The Fluor S-Max system (Bio-Rad), which gives a linear response with respect to light output, was used, and band intensity was quantified using local background subtraction. The data were first normalized by an appropriate loading control and then further normalized to evaluate the consistency of relative trends across independent experiments, according to the procedures described in detail previously (36Wang C.C. Cirit M. Haugh J.M. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5: 246Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The allosteric switch, consisting of a shift in Helix3/Loop7 that triggers ordering of switch II in the on state, can be modulated in wild type Ras-GppNHp crystals by the binding of calcium acetate from the crystallization mother liquor (PDB code 3K8Y) (10Buhrman G. Holzapfel G. Fetics S. Mattos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4931-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The off state, with a disordered switch II, is obtained by growing crystals in conditions containing calcium chloride instead (PDB code 2RGE) (31Buhrman G. Wink G. Mattos C. Structure. 2007; 15: 1618-1629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This modulation can similarly be achieved in the RasG12V and RasQ61L mutants by growing crystals with symmetry R32 in the presence of calcium chloride to yield the off state and in the presence of calcium acetate to promote the on state of the allosteric switch. We have already published the crystal structure of RasQ61L-GppNHp in which the allosteric switch is off (PDB code 2RGD). Here, we present the crystal structures of RasG12V-GppNHp in the on state (1.30 Å resolution) and in the off state (1.84 Å resolution), as well as the structure of RasQ61L-GppNHp in the on state (1.32 Å resolution). These structures, together with the previously published ones mentioned above, provide a comprehensive picture of how the oncogenic mutants impair the active site and a model through which the Q61L mutation obstructs the equilibrium between the on and off states of the allosteric switch in Ras. The crystal structure of RasG12V-GppNHp in the presence of calcium acetate has all of the features of the on state of the allosteric switch except in the local surroundings of the active site, where critical elements are perturbed. A bound calcium acetate at the remote allosteric site positions Loop7 and Helix3 with Arg97 at the center of an H-bonding network such that Val103 from Loop7 and several residues in Helix3 move away from switch II as described for the wild type structure (Fig. 1) (10Buhrman G. Holzapfel G. Fetics S. Mattos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4931-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This allows the placement of the C-terminal portion of switch II such that Arg68 is at the center of a second H-bonding network that modulates the conformation of the N-terminal portion of the switch, including catalytic residue Gln61. The result is that the main chain conformation of the entire switch II in RasG12V-GppNHp is the same as in the wild type structure (Fig. 2a). The side chain of Gln61, however, cannot adopt the conformation seen in the wild type due to steric hindrance with the Val12 side chain. Instead it is rotated about χ2 to interact with the nucleophilic water molecule WAT175, as observed in the structures solved from crystals of symmetry P3221 (PDB code 1CTQ) and in the Ras-RasGAP complex (PDB code 1WQ1). Interestingly, the side chain of Glu62 is disordered in RasG12V, whereas in the wild type it is highly ordered and interacts through water molecule WAT176 with Gln61 to help position it near the bridging water molecule WAT189 (10Buhrman G.

However, structural components that enable IP3R1 and TRPC3 channels to communicate locally are unclear. Caveolae are plasma membrane microdomains that can compartmentalize proteins. Here, we tested the hypothesis that caveolae and specifically caveolin-1 (cav-1), a caveolae scaffolding protein, facilitate functional IP3R1 to TRPC3 coupling in smooth muscle cells of resistance-size cerebral arteries. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), which disassembles caveolae, reduced IP3-induced ICat activation in smooth muscle cells and vasoconstriction in pressurized arteries. Cholesterol replenishment reversed these effects. Cav-1 knockdown using shRNA attenuated IP3-induced vasoconstriction, but did not alter TRPC3 and IP3R1 expression. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the cav-1 scaffolding domain (CSD) sequence (amino acids 82–101) also attenuated IP3-induced ICat activation and vasoconstriction. A cav-1 antibody co-immunoprecipitated cav-1, TRPC3, and IP3R1 from cerebral artery lysate. ImmunoFRET indicated that cav-1, TRPC3 channels and IP3R1 are spatially co-localized in arterial smooth muscle cells. IP3R1 and TRPC3 channel spatial localization was disrupted by MβCD and a CSD peptide. Cholesterol replenishment re-established IP3R1 and TRPC3 channel close spatial proximity. Taken together, these data indicate that in arterial smooth muscle cells, cav-1 co-localizes SR IP3R1 and plasma membrane TRPC3 channels in close spatial proximity thereby enabling IP3-induced physical coupling of these proteins, leading to ICat generation and vasoconstriction.

https://openalex.org/W1976369464,"Tight junctions are multiprotein complexes that form the fundamental physiologic and anatomic barrier between epithelial and endothelial cells, yet little information is available about their molecular organization. To begin to understand how the transmembrane proteins of the tight junction are organized into multiprotein complexes, we used blue native-PAGE (BN-PAGE) and cross-linking techniques to identify complexes extracted from MDCK II cells and mouse liver. In nonionic detergent extracts from MDCK II cells, the tight junction integral membrane protein claudin-2 was preferentially isolated as a homodimer, whereas claudin-4 was monomeric. Analysis of the interactions between chimeras of claudin-2 and -4 are consistent with the transmembrane domains of claudin-2 being responsible for dimerization, and mutational analysis followed by cross-linking indicated that the second transmembrane domains were arranged in close proximity in homodimers. BN-PAGE of mouse liver membrane identified a relatively discrete high molecular weight complex containing at least claudin-1, claudin-2, and occludin; the difference in the protein complex sizes between cultured cells and tissues may reflect differences in tight junction protein or lipid composition or post-translational modifications.

Our results suggest that BN-PAGE may be a useful tool in understanding tight junction structure. Tight junctions are multiprotein complexes that form the physiologic barrier to the paracellular movement of water, ions, and solutes between epithelial and endothelial cells. This structure encircles the apical end of the lateral membrane of epithelial cells and can be visualized by transmission electron microscopic analysis as a series of close membrane appositions. However, the fine structure of tight junctions is best revealed by freeze fracture electron microscopy, where the sites of membrane apposition appear as a network of anastomosing transmembrane protein strands that interact between adjacent cells. In unfixed tissue, these continuous strands appear as rows of 10 nm particles (reviewed in Ref. 1Anderson J.M. News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 16: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), suggesting that the transmembrane protein components of the tight junction are organized into large repeating protein complexes. Defining the nature of these complexes is critical to understanding how the selective barrier properties of the tight junction are created, regulated, and altered in disease. Although several tight junction transmembrane proteins have been identified, including the members of the Marvel domain-containing family (occludin (2Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A.

In this study, we use BN-PAGE to demonstrate that in MDCK II cells a homodimer is the favored oligomeric unit for claudin-2 (cldn2) but that in the same cell line both claudin-4 (cldn4) and occludin are monomers. Formation of the cldn2 dimer is not dependent on extracellular domains or on the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain, suggesting that dimerization is mediated by one or more of the transmembrane domains. Consistent with this idea, we found that dimerization does not require cell surface localization and thus does not represent trans-interactions between cells. Additionally, we demonstrate that in mouse liver, cldn2, along with at least cldn1 and occludin, is present in a high molecular weight protein complex. Antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc./Invitrogen, except the M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma), the ZO-1 rat monoclonal R40.76 (a gift from Bruce Stevenson, (22Stevenson B.R.

Tet-Off MDCK II cells and inducible cell lines expressing cldn2, cldn4, and chimeras have been described previously (23Van Itallie C. Rahner C. Anderson J.M. J. Clin.

Amino-terminally His6- and FLAG-tagged cldn2 constructs were generated using PCR and cloned into pTRE (Clontech) and pcDNA 3.1 (Clontech); primers used were for His6 tag, 5′-cgaattcaccatggcgtactaccatcaccatcaccatcacaccggtggtatggcctcccttggcgt-3′, and for FLAG tag, 5′-gaattcgatctacccatggactacaaagacgatgacgacaagatggcctcccttggcgt-3′. Cldn2 mutants were generated using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit; the cldn2 A3 mutants were made by replacing the highly conserved 49GLW51 in the first extracellular domain with AAA using the primers 5′-attgtgacggcggttggcttttccaaggccgccgccatggagtgtgcgacacacagcacaggc-3′ and 5′-gcctgtgctgtgtgtcgcacactccatggcggcggccttggaaaagccaaccgccgtcacaat-3′ (all QuikChange primers are sense, followed by antisense sequences). The cldn2 cysteine to serine mutants were created first by separately replacing perimembrane cysteines in the second (TM2Cys → Ser) and fourth (TM4 Cys → Ser) transmembrane domains with serines. C104S was created using primers 5′-ctctgtggtgggcatgagaagcaccgtgtt-3′ and 5′-aacacggtgcttctcatgcccaccacagag-3′, and subsequently C104S,C108S was made using 5′-agatgcaccgtgttcagccaggattc-tcgag-3′ and 5′-ctcgagaatcctggctgaacacggtgcatct-3′. C182S,C185S was made using 5′-agccggagtcatccttagcttttccagctcgcccc-3′ and 5′-ggggcgagctggaaaagctaaggatgactccggct-3′. Stable cell lines were generated in MDCK II Tet-Off cells by cloning mutant claudin cDNAs into pTRE and co-transfection with pSV Zeo with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen); stable cell clones were selected using 1 mg/ml Zeocin; at least duplicate cell lines expressing each transgene were isolated. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA 3.1 His- and FLAG-tagged claudins using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science); cells were collected 2–3 days after transfection. Tet-Off MDCK II cells were plated in duplicate 150 mm dishes and cultured for 8d; cells were washed and scraped in cold PBS; plasma membranes were enriched by a modification of the method of Boone et al. (26Boone C.W. Ford L.E. Bond H.E. Stuart D.C. Lorenz D. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 41: 378-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized after incubation in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2 supplemented with protease inhibitors (Halt protease inhibitor mixture, Thermo Scientific), washed with 10 mm Tris, 1 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, and the pellets resuspended in 50% sucrose in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2. Aliquots of 0.8 ml were transferred to 2-ml ultracentrifuge tubes and overlaid with 0.8 ml of 42.9% sucrose and 0.5 ml of 20% sucrose. Sucrose step gradients were centrifuged at 100,00 × g for 60 min in a Beckman TLS-55 rotor; the band at the 20/42.9% interface was collected and stored on ice overnight. The sample was diluted 10-fold with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g, and the resulting pellet extracted twice by incubation on ice for 20 min with 4 m urea in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The insoluble material after each extraction and two subsequent washes with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, was collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in 1% dodecyl maltoside (DDM, Anatrace, Maumee, OH) in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1× native-PAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min in a TLA100 rotor (Beckman Coulter), and 0.1 volume native-PAGE 5% G-250 sample additive (Invitrogen) was added. Cells were washed with PBS or HBSS and resuspended in 1% DDM, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, incubated on ice for 20 min, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatants were prepared for BN-PAGE. When tagged claudins were purified by affinity chromatography, cells were resuspended in 1% DDM, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl and clarified as above before incubation with FLAG affinity resin (Sigma) or Talon resin (Clontech) according to the manufacturers' directions. Tagged claudins were eluted from affinity resins using either FLAG peptide (Sigma) or 250 mm imidazole as appropriate. His-tagged cldn2 was eluted from Talon resin and incubated with 2 mm NHS-diazirine (SDA), NHS-LC-diazirine or Sulfo-NHS-SS-diazirine (S-SDAD) (Thermo Scientific) for 30 min. Samples were quenched with 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, dialyzed against four changes of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.3% DDM in Slide-a-Lyzer mini dialysis cups (Thermo Scientific), and 15 μl transferred to glass slides; drops were constrained within circles drawn with a wax pencil. Cross-linking was performed by exposing drops to UV light at 350 nm for the indicated times. Equal volumes of SDS sample buffer were added to terminate the cross-linking, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred, and immunoblotted as described below. His-tagged cldn2 and cldn4 were eluted from Talon resin and incubated with 100 μm glutaraldehyde for the indicated times (27Azem A. Tsfadia Y. Hajouj O. Shaked I. Daniel E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1804: 768-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar); SDS was added to one sample before addition of glutaraldehyde to disrupt oligomeric organization. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, and samples were processed for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described below. MDCK II cells induced to express VSV-g-tagged cldn2 with and without mutation of perimembrane cysteines to serines were treated overnight with the palmitoylation inhibitor, 2-bromopalmitate, as described previously (28Van Itallie C.M. Gambling T.M. Carson J.L. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS, and incubated with 2 mg/ml dithiobismaleimidoethane (DTME, Thermo Scientific) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cross-linker was quenched with 2 mm cysteine in Dulbecco's PBS, and cells were extracted with SDS sample buffer lacking reducing agents. Samples subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described below. Mouse liver membranes were prepared with a simplified method based on that of Goodenough and co-workers (29Stevenson B.R. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). One mouse liver was minced with razor blades and incubated with 1 mm NaHCO3 supplemented with protease inhibitors for 10 min on ice and homogenized using a glass/Teflon homogenizer. The resulting homogenate was filtered through four layers of cotton gauze and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded and the soft pellet made 50% sucrose by addition of 3 volumes of 67% sucrose in 1 mm NaHCO3. Aliquots of 0.8 ml were placed at the bottom of each of four 2-ml ultracentrifuge tubes and overlaid with 0.8 ml of 42.9% sucrose and 0.5 ml of 20% sucrose. Samples were centrifuged in a Beckman Coulter TLS-55 rotor at 100,00 × g for 60 min, the upper interfaces collected, combined, and diluted 10-fold with 1 mm NaHCO3, and the diluted material centrifuged at 4000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 1% dodecyl maltoside in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl and incubated on ice for 20 min. Resuspended pellets were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble material, and the resulting supernatant prepared for BN-PAGE. Samples were electrophoresed on duplicate gels; one was stored at 4 °C, and the second was transferred and immunoblotted for cldn1 as described previously. The position of the immunoreactive band was determined and the corresponding region excised from the duplicate BN gel; the excised band was forced three times through a 30-gauge needle and electroeluted overnight in 25 mm Tricine, 3.75 mm imidazole, 5 mm aminocaproic acid, pH 7.0, for 16 h at 100 V using an Elutrap (Schleicher & Schüll). Following brief voltage reversal (200 V, 20 s), the electroeluted material was removed, precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid, washed three times with cold acetone, and air-dried. The pellet was resuspended in 4× SDS/Laemmli sample buffer, incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and briefly sonicated. Aliquots were electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with cldn1, cldn2, and occludin antibodies. BN electrophoresis was performed using native-PAGE Novex BisTris gels (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions; the protocols are based on techniques developed by Schagger and von Jagow (15Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Gels were transferred for 60 min at 30 V to PVDF membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore) in Tris-glycine buffer containing 20% methanol and 0.1% SDS. Membranes were fixed in 8% acetic acid for 15 min, air-dried, destained in 100% methanol for 20 s, washed with H2O, and incubated in blocking buffer (10% NFDM in PBS) for 60 min. Immunoblotting for BN-polyacrylamide gels was performed as described previously (30Van Itallie C.M. Fanning A.S. Bridges A. Anderson J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 3930-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), except HRP-coupled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) were used, and detection was performed using SuperSignal West chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific). SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, IR detection, and immunofluorescence were all performed as described previously (30Van Itallie C.M. Fanning A.S. Bridges A. Anderson J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 3930-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Recombinant aquaporin Z was extracted from bacterial pellets with 1% DDM, purified on Talon resin, dialyzed, electrophoresed on BN-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue; aquaporin Z plasmid construct was generously provided by Dr. Michael Wiener, University of Virginia. To analyze the oligomeric organization of endogenous claudins in cultured epithelial cells (MDCK II), we used sucrose density fractionation to enrich tight junction-containing membranes and extracted these fractions with 4 m urea to remove peripheral membrane proteins. Protein pellets were dissolved in the nonionic detergent DDM, and samples were subjected to BN-PAGE. Immunoblot analysis of BN-polyacrylamide gels transferred to PVDF membranes revealed that cldn1, -2, -7 and occludin were easily detectable (Fig. 1A). When compared with soluble molecular weight markers, cldn2 migrated at ∼112 kDa. There are considerable pitfalls in molecular weight estimation using BN-PAGE (31Wittig I. Beckhaus T. Wumaier Z. Karas M. Schägger H. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2010; 9: 2149-2161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) especially for small membrane proteins (32Heuberger E.H. Veenhoff L.M. Duurkens R.H. Friesen R.H. Poolman B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), partially because unit of mass includes the protein, variable amounts of bound Coomassie dye, and an unknown amount of lipid and partly because electrophoresis of soluble protein markers variably deviates from that of membrane proteins of known molecular weight in BN-PAGE. We applied a correction factor to obtain the protein alone based on an estimate of dye binding of 0.56 g/g protein (32Heuberger E.H. Veenhoff L.M. Duurkens R.H. Friesen R.H. Poolman B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (observed range is about 0.35–0.6 g/g (31Wittig I. Beckhaus T. Wumaier Z. Karas M. Schägger H. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2010; 9: 2149-2161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)); after this correction, the approximate molecular mass for the protein component of the complex was ∼62 kDa. This size is consistent with either a dimer or trimer of cldn2. Similar analysis suggested cldn1 and cldn7 were either dimers or trimers, whereas endogenous occludin (correction: 130 × 0.56 = 65 kDa) appeared to migrate as a monomer. These relative molecular weight assumptions were substantiated by comparison with that of aquaporin Z electrophoresed in parallel in BN-PAGE. Aquaporin Z (monomer = 25 kDa) is known from crystallographic studies to assemble as a tetramer (33Jiang J. Daniels B.V. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 454-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); its apparent molecular mass in BN-PAGE was 185 kDa; correction for the bound Coomassie dye (185 × 0.56 = 103 kDa) resulted in a calculated molecular mass consistent with a protein tetramer containing four 25-kDa monomers (supplemental Fig. 1). The various claudins had slightly different electrophoretic mobility; the reason for this is unclear but may be result from differences in protein molecular weights, isoelectric points, and associated lipids or due to difference in protein interactions (homo- or hetero-oligomerization). The extraction and BN-PAGE was repeated using different nonionic detergents with similar results, although use of digitonin resulted in slightly higher molecular weight complexes (data not shown), consistent with other reports that digitonin removes less associated lipid from membrane protein complexes than does DDM (34Reisinger V. Eichacker L.A. Proteomics. 2007; 7: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Despite several attempts, we were unable to detect endogenous cldn4 after BN-PAGE from wild-type MDCK II cells. To determine whether induced cldn2 in stably transfected MDCK cells showed the same oligomeric organization as the endogenous cldn2, we next performed BN-PAGE on DDM-extracted MDCK Tet-Off cells induced to express mouse cldn2 by removal of doxycyline. To distinguish cross-linking of subunits within a complex versus freely diffusing uncomplexed proteins, duplicate samples were first treated with 1% SDS to denature and thus dissociate oligomers (Fig. 1B, left panel). When induced mouse cldn2 was extracted in DDM, it migrated at approximately the same molecular mass as endogenous canine cldn2, whereas SDS-treated cldn2 migrated at ∼55 kDa, and when corrected for bound detergent (55 × 0.56 = 31 kDa) approximates a monomer, suggesting that the 112-kDa band most likely represents a cldn2 dimer and not trimer. Because of the high level of transgene induction, the endogenous cldn2 was not detected at the exposure times employed (data not shown). In contrast to the results seen with cldn2, BN-PAGE analysis of induced human cldn4 resulted in identical migration behavior for DDM- and SDS-treated samples (Fig. 1B, right panel), suggesting that in MDCK cells, cldn4 exists as a monomer. To test if the cldn2 complex visualized by BN-PAGE likely represented a homodimer or a complex containing cldn2 and a different protein, HEK cells were transiently transfected with His6-tagged cldn2 and FLAG-tagged cldn2 separately or together (Fig. 1C). FLAG- and His-tagged cldn2 migrated identically to wild-type cldn2 in BN-PAGE when expressed either transiently or stably (data not shown). All transfected HEK cells showed approximately equal levels of cldn2 expression (Fig. 1C, lysates, top left); untransfected HEK cells do not express endogenous claudins (data not shown). The FLAG antibody did not recognize His-tagged cldn2 (Fig. 1C, lane 2) in cells transfected with His-tagged cldn2 alone (lysates, bottom left). DDM extract of transfected cells was purified on metal affinity resin; only extracts from cells transfected with His-tagged cldn2 were specifically eluted with imidazole (Fig. 1C, upper right panel). Only when FLAG-tagged cldn 2 was co-transfected with His-tagged cldn2 did it specifically elute from metal affinity resin (Fig. 1C, lane 3, lower right panel), suggesting that the FLAG-tagged protein was retained on the resin via an interaction with the His-tagged protein (lane 3). In contrast, there was no apparent interaction between His- and FLAG-tagged cldn2 when separately transfected cells were co-cultured (Fig. 1C, lane 4) or supernatants of separately transfected cells were mixed before incubation with affinity resin (lane 5). These results suggest that dimerization is not due to transcellular interactions between proteins expressed in apposing cells or as an artifactual interaction formed during isolation. Because FLAG-His dimers depend on co-transfection, it is possible that dimers form during synthesis or trafficking. Chemical cross-linking is a commonly used method to define protein-protein interactions within oligomers. We used two separate approaches to determine whether chemical cross-linking could confirm the existence of cldn2 dimers in DDM extracts and perhaps identify other higher molecular weight complexes. First, we used a series of photoactivatable succinimidyl ester diazirine (SDA) cross-linkers to probe for cross-linking between His-tagged cldn2, which had been induced in MDCK II cells, extracted in DDM, and purified by metal affinity resin chromatography (Fig. 2A). As reported previously, we variably observed a low background of SDS-resistant dimer even in the absence of cross-linking (12Mitic L.L. Unger V.M. Anderson J.M. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Incubation of purified cldn2 with SDA, NHS-LC-diazirine, or S-SDAD resulted in increased levels of dimeric cldn2, with only very minor appearance of higher molecular weight bands. Of note, although in particular after S-SDAD, as much as 15–20% of cldn2 appears as dimer, most cldn2 migrates as monomer; the reason for this limited cross-linking is unclear. There was little time-dependent increase in UV cross-linking; it seems likely that the rate-limiting step is the first amine-dependent cross-linking and that the UV-dependent cross-linking is relatively efficient and rapid. Glutaraldehyde-dependent cross-linking has often been used to obtain information about subunit number or proximity, and although highly efficient, its lack of chemical specificity can at times produce oligomers of questionable biologic relevance (35Payne J.W. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, despite this lack of specificity, the efficiency of glutaraldehyde cross-linking suggested that it might provide a useful approach to identify potential higher order cldn2 oligomers from DDM-extracted MDCK cells (Fig. 2B, panel a, top left panel). Time-dependent glutaraldehyde cross-linking of purified cldn2 resulted in conversion of most cldn2 to a dimer with no increase in any specific higher molecular weight species; preincubation of DDM-extracted purified cldn2 with 1% SDS prior to cross-linking prevented cross-linking to a dimer. There was, however, loss of some fraction of the immunoreactive cldn2 signal after extended incubation in glutaraldehyde, consistent with nonspecific cross-linking to nonclaudin protein contaminants, to insoluble aggregates, or to sizes exceeding resolution on the gel. In contrast to glutaraldehyde-dimerized cldn2, purified DDM-extracted cldn4 inducibly expressed in MDCK cells was not cross-linked by glutaraldehyde (Fig. 2B, top right panel). The conversion of cldn2 monomer to dimer is presented graphically in Fig. 2B, panel b, bottom panel, supporting a kinetic plateau of cross-linking at a dimer. Together these cross-linking studies support a dimer as the fundamental oligomeric state of cldn2. Because cldn2 forms dimers and cldn4 does not, we used previously generated MDCK II cell lines inducibly expressing chimeras between cldn2 and cldn4 (24Van Itallie C.M. Colegio O.R. Anderson J.M. J.

https://openalex.org/W2068196634,"FimX is a multidomain signaling protein required for type IV pilus biogenesis and twitching motility in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. FimX is localized to the single pole of the bacterial cell, and the unipolar localization is crucial for the correct assembly of type IV pili. FimX contains a non-catalytic EAL domain that lacks cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) phosphodiesterase activity. It was shown that deletion of the EAL domain or mutation of the signature EVL motif affects the unipolar localization of FimX. However, it was not understood how the C-terminal EAL domain could influence protein localization considering that the localization sequence resides in the remote N-terminal region of the protein. Using hydrogen/deuterium exchange-coupled mass spectrometry, we found that the binding of c-di-GMP to the EAL domain triggers a long-range (∼ca. 70 Å) conformational change in the N-terminal REC domain and the adjacent linker. In conjunction with the observation that mutation of the EVL motif of the EAL domain abolishes the binding of c-di-GMP, the hydrogen/deuterium exchange results provide a molecular explanation for the mediation of protein localization and type IV pilus biogenesis by c-di-GMP through a remarkable allosteric regulation mechanism."

Three distinct NPs (ANP, BNP, and CNP) can selectively activate natriuretic peptide receptors, NPR-A and NPR-B, raising the cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels. Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) was found to rapidly cleave ANP, but the functional consequences of such cleavages in the cellular environment and the molecular mechanism of recognition and cleavage remain unknown. Here, we show that reducing expression levels of IDE profoundly alters the response of NPR-A and NPR-B to the stimulation of ANP, BNP, and CNP in cultured cells. IDE rapidly cleaves ANP and CNP, thus inactivating their ability to raise intracellular cGMP. Conversely, reduced IDE expression enhances the stimulation of NPR-A and NPR-B by ANP and CNP, respectively. Instead of proteolytic inactivation, IDE cleavage can lead to hyperactivation of BNP toward NPR-A. Conversely, decreasing IDE expression reduces BNP-mediated signaling. Additionally, the cleavages of ANP and BNP by IDE render them active with NPR-B and a reduction of IDE expression diminishes the ability of ANP and BNP to stimulate NPR-B. Our kinetic and crystallographic analyses offer the molecular basis for the selective degradation of NPs and their variants by IDE. Furthermore, our studies reveal how IDE utilizes its catalytic chamber and exosite to engulf and bind up to two NPs leading to biased stochastic, non-sequential cleavages and the ability of IDE to switch its substrate selectivity.

Type 1 cadherins of adherens junctions show specific homophilic adhesion that plays a major role in developmental tissue segregation. The desmosomal cadherins, desmocollin and desmoglein, occur as several different isoforms with overlapping expression in some tissues where different isoforms are located in the same desmosomes. Although adhesive binding of desmosomal cadherins has been investigated in a variety of ways, their interaction in desmosome-forming epithelial cells has not been studied. Here, using extracellular homobifunctional cross-linking, we provide evidence for homophilic and isoform-specific binding between the Dsc2, Dsc3, Dsg2, and Dsg3 isoforms in HaCaT keratinocytes and show that it represents trans interaction. Furthermore, the cross-linked adducts are present in the detergent-insoluble fraction, and electron microscopy shows that extracellular cross-linking probably occurs in desmosomes. We found no evidence for either heterophilic or cis interaction, but neither can be completely excluded by our data. Mutation of amino acid residues Trp-2 and Ala-80 that are important for trans interaction in classical cadherin adhesive binding abolished Dsc2 binding, indicating that these residues are also involved in desmosomal adhesion. These interactions of desmosomal cadherins may be of key importance for their ordered arrangement within desmosomes that we believe is essential for desmosomal adhesive strength and the maintenance of tissue integrity."
https://openalex.org/W1969326426,"Acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM) to form the bioactive lipid ceramide (Cer). Notably, aSMase exists in two forms: a zinc (Zn(2+))-independent lysosomal aSMase (L-SMase) and a Zn(2+)-dependent secreted aSMase (S-SMase) that arise from alternative trafficking of a single protein precursor. Despite extensive investigation into the maturation and trafficking of aSMase, the exact identity of mature L-SMase has remained unclear. Here, we describe a novel mechanism of aSMase maturation involving C-terminal proteolytic processing within, or in close proximity to, endolysosomes. Using two different C-terminal-tagged constructs of aSMase (V5, DsRed), we demonstrate that aSMase is processed from a 75-kDa, Zn(2+)-activated proenzyme to a mature 65 kDa, Zn(2+)-independent L-SMase. L-SMase is recognized by a polyclonal Ab to aSMase, but not by anti-V5 or anti-DsRed antibodies, suggesting that the C-terminal tag is lost during maturation. Furthermore, indirect immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that mature L-SMase colocalized with the lysosomal marker LAMP1, whereas V5-aSMase localized to the Golgi secretory pathway. Moreover, V5-aSMase possessed Zn(2+)-dependent activity suggesting it may represent the common protein precursor of S-SMase and L-SMase. Importantly, the 65-kDa L-SMase, but not V5-aSMase, was sensitive to the lysosomotropic inhibitor desipramine, co-fractionated with lysosomes, and migrated at the same M(r) as partially purified human aSMase. Finally, three aSMase mutants containing C-terminal Niemann-Pick mutations (R600H, R600P, ΔR608) exhibited defective proteolytic maturation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that mature L-SMase arises from C-terminal proteolytic processing of pro-aSMase and suggest that impaired C-terminal proteolysis may lead to severe defects in L-SMase function."

IntroductionIn many species, oocytes stop their meiotic cell cycle at the first prophase, during which time they grow by accumulation of proteins and mRNAs necessary for subsequent developmental processes. In response to hormonal stimulation, e.g. progesterone in frogs, the immature oocytes resume meiosis to mature, a process called oocyte maturation (1Nagahama Y. Yamashita M. Dev. Growth Differ. 2008; 50: S195-S219Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The final inducer of oocyte maturation is the maturation-promoting factor (MPF), 2The abbreviations used are: MPFmaturation-promoting factorCPEcytoplasmic polyadenylation elementCPEBCPE-binding proteinCPSFcleavage and polyadenylation specificity factorDAZLDeleted in Azoospermia-like proteinEBextraction bufferGVBDgerminal vesicle breakdownIPimmunoprecipitationRINGOrapid inducer of G2-M in oocytes. which consists of cyclin B-bound cdc2. In Xenopus, MPF is stockpiled in immature oocytes as an inactive form called pre-MPF, and its activation induces oocyte maturation. In addition to the activation of pre-MPF, the normal progression of oocyte maturation, including the transition from meiosis I to meiosis II without intervening DNA synthesis, is ensured by the continued synthesis of cyclin B1 protein, which depends on the translational activation of cyclin B1 mRNA stored in the oocytes (2Belloc E. Méndez R. Nature. 2008; 452: 1017-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One of the mechanisms that regulate the translational activation of mRNA is cytoplasmic polyadenylation, in which cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA plays a critical role (3Mendez R. Richter J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 4Richter J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 279-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In fact, the translational activation of cyclin B1 mRNA during oocyte maturation is under the CPE-mediated control, which involves dynamic changes in interactions among several key proteins, including CPE-binding protein (CPEB), Symplekin, Maskin, cleavage, and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), PARN, and GLD2 (4Richter J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 279-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 5Radford H.E. Meijer H.A. de Moor C.H. Biochim. Biophys.

RNA. 2005; 11: 1117-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Besides cyclin B1 mRNA, mos and wee1 mRNAs also carry the CPE sequence in the 3′-UTR, and their translation is regulated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation. However, the timings of translational activation are different in the mRNAs during oocyte maturation (7de Moor C.H. Richter J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8Charlesworth A. Welk J. MacNicol A.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 706-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Charlesworth A.

Yamashita M. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 865-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Accordingly, oocytes must have additional mechanisms that define the precise timing of translational activation of each CPE-containing mRNA during oocyte maturation. Indeed, it has been shown that the Musashi-binding element (11Arumugam K. Wang Y. Hardy L.L. MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the Pumilio-binding element (10Nakahata S. Kotani T. Mita K. Kawasaki T. Katsu Y. Nagahama Y. Yamashita M. Mech.

MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. Dev.

MacNicol A.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2010; 77: 662-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These cis-elements are recognized by trans-acting proteins specific to each element as follows: Musashi for Musashi-binding element, Pumilio for Pumilio-binding element, and an unidentified protein for translational control sequence. However, these proteins have not yet been fully characterized biochemically.Pumilio homologs have been identified in various organisms, from yeast to humans, and constitute a large and evolutionarily conserved protein family, the Puf family (15Wickens M. Bernstein D.S. Kimble J. Parker R. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 150-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, the Puf family consists of two members, Pumilio1 (Pum1) and Pumilio2 (Pum2) (16Spassov D.S. Jurecic R. Gene. 2002; 299: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Spassov D.S. Jurecic R. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2003; 30: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Kurisaki I. Iwai T.

Nagahama Y. Yamashita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20945-20953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) resembles human and mouse Pum1 rather than Pum2, it should be Xenopus Pum1. Xenopus Pum1 is bound to cyclin B1 mRNA in immature oocytes (12Nakahata S. Katsu Y. Mita K. Inoue K. Nagahama Y. Yamashita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20945-20953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Injection of anti-Pum1 antibody or overexpression of Pum1 protein has a significant impact on the timing of oocyte maturation and cyclin B1 synthesis specifically, suggesting the involvement of Pum1 in translational control of cyclin B1 mRNA (10Nakahata S. Kotani T. Mita K. Kawasaki T. Katsu Y. Nagahama Y. Yamashita M. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 865-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition to Pum1, Xenopus oocytes contain another member of the Puf family, Pum2, which was reported to regulate the translation of mRNA encoding rapid inducer of G2-M in oocytes (RINGO), a cyclin B1-like molecule responsible for inducing oocyte maturation, in cooperation with Deleted in Azoospermia-like protein (DAZL) (20Padmanabhan K. Richter J.D. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that Pum1 and Pum2 contribute to oocyte maturation by controlling the translation of different target mRNAs. However, little is known about their biochemical characteristics, including expression patterns, their biochemical modifications, and their interacting proteins during oocyte maturation. In this study, we biochemically characterized Pum1 and Pum2 in Xenopus oocytes by using newly produced antibodies that discriminate between Pum1 and Pum2.DISCUSSIONUsing newly produced antibodies that can discriminate between Pum1 and Pum2, we biochemically characterized these proteins in Xenopus oocytes. Co-IP experiments revealed that both Pum1 and Pum2 interact with other key proteins responsible for cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translational control, including CPEB, Maskin, Symplekin, CPSF, PARN, GLD2, and DAZL, in immature oocytes in an RNA-independent manner (Figs. 4, D–I, and 5, A–H) but that Pum1 and Pum2 do not form a complex (Fig. 4, C–E). These findings indicate that oocytes have at least two types of protein complex that act as a machinery for controlling translation of mRNAs in oocytes; one type contains Pum1 and the other contains Pum2, both of which include CPEB, Maskin, Symplekin, CPSF, PARN, GLD2, and DAZL as common components. Pum1 and Pum2 may confer the ability to select mRNAs on each machinery, enabling the Pum1-containing machinery to control cyclin B1 mRNA and the Pum2-containing machinery to control RINGO mRNA. In this context, it should be noted that Pum2 was reported to regulate RINGO mRNA in collaboration with DAZL but not with CPEB (20Padmanabhan K. Richter J.D. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In disagreement with this, we found in this study that Pum2 interacts with CPEB and DAZL (Figs. 2B and 4E). Moreover, we found that Pum1 binds to RINGO mRNA in immature oocytes by experiments using GST pulldown and IP followed by RT-PCR (Fig. 4, A and B), whereas we were unable to detect the interaction of Pum2 with RINGO mRNA by similar experiments with oocytes overexpressing GST-Pum2 for GST pulldown and with anti-Pum2 antibody for IP. 3R. Ota, T. Kotani, and M. Yamashita, unpublished data. Thus, our finding that Pum1, but not Pum2, interacts with RINGO mRNA apparently conflicts with the notion that Pum2 regulates the translation of RINGO mRNA (20Padmanabhan K. Richter J.D. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The discrepancy might be due to the difference in antibodies and tags used in the two studies, anti-human Pum2 antibody and Myc-tagged Pum2 in the previous study versus anti-Xenopus Pum2 antibody and GST-tagged Pum2 in our study.Consistent with previous reports (10Nakahata S. Kotani T. Mita K. Kawasaki T. Katsu Y. Nagahama Y. Yamashita M. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 865-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 20Padmanabhan K. Richter J.D. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), anti-Pum1N and anti-Pum2N antibodies accelerated progesterone-induced GVBD when injected into oocytes (Fig. 3). A previous explanation was that anti-Pum1 antibody and anti-Pum2 antibody affected the translation of cyclin B1 mRNA and RINGO mRNA, respectively. However, we found that Pum2 is not associated with RINGO mRNA in immature oocytes as opposed to a previous finding that Pum2 is a partner of RINGO mRNA (20Padmanabhan K. Richter J.D. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Our finding raises the possibility that anti-Pum2 antibody accelerates oocyte maturation by enhancing the translational activation of an unidentified mRNA(s) other than RINGO mRNA.Pum1 is phosphorylated during oocyte maturation (Fig. 1C). Although its biological meaning is uncertain, the coincidence of Pum1 phosphorylation, CPEB dissociation from Pum1, and cyclin B1 synthesis (Fig. 2C) suggests that Pum1 phosphorylation induces a conformational change in the complex consisting of Pum1 and CPEB that targets CPEB for dissociation and degradation, the process required for translational activation of cyclin B1 mRNA (30Mendez R. Barnard D. Richter J.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1833-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).Besides cyclin B1 mRNA, RINGO mRNA is assumed to be a target of Pum1 (Fig. 4, A and B). However, the timing of translational activation of RINGO is apparently earlier than cyclin B1 during oocyte maturation (20Padmanabhan K. Richter J.D. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Then, how is Pum1 involved in the translational activation that occurs at different timings? A hint to resolve this issue might be the finding that the interaction between Pum1 and RINGO mRNA existing in immature oocytes was aborted in mature oocytes, a situation apparently different from the case of Pum1 and cyclin B1 mRNA, in which the interaction is sustained during oocyte maturation (Fig. 4B). It is conceivable that Pum1 contributes to the selection of mRNAs for the translation control machinery but that the mechanisms controlling target mRNAs vary from mRNA to mRNA; the translation of cyclin B1 mRNA is controlled with continuous association of Pum1 with the mRNA during oocyte maturation, whereas the translation of RINGO mRNA is controlled via the dissociation of Pum1 from the mRNA.Pum2 is phosphorylated and dissociates from CPEB during oocyte maturation (Figs. 1C and 2, A and B), but the relationship between the two events is unclear. Thus, the biological significance of Pum2 phosphorylation is completely unknown at present. Nevertheless, the fact that Pum2 phosphorylation occurs at earlier timing than Pum1 phosphorylation suggests that mRNAs regulated by Pum2-containing translation control machinery are translated earlier than cyclin B1 mRNA regulated by Pum1-containing machinery. Some mRNAs, including mos, D7, and G10, have a CPE in their 3′-UTR and undergo polyadenylation and translational activation earlier than cyclin B1 mRNA during oocyte maturation (9Charlesworth A. Cox L.L. MacNicol A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17650-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the interaction of these mRNAs with Pum2 by GST pulldown assay and IP/RT-PCR assay, but we were unable to detect an interaction. We also attempted to identify Pum2-associated mRNAs by sequencing cDNA clones in a library constructed from anti-Pum2 immunoprecipitates, and we discovered cyclin A2 and cdc20/fizzy, both of which harbor a CPE and a Pumilio-binding element in their 3′-UTRs, in the library; however, their association with Pum2 in oocytes was not confirmed by the IP/RT-PCR or UV cross-linking assay.3 In mammals, Pum2 has been reported to regulate several mRNAs, including those encoding Erk2 and p38α (members of the MAPK family), in human embryonic stem cells (31Lee M.H. Hook B. Pan G. Kershner A.M. Merritt C. Seydoux G. Thomson J.A. Wickens M. Kimble J. PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: e233Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and those encoding the initiation factor eIF4E and the voltage-gated sodium channel Scn1a in mouse neurons (32Vessey J.P. Schoderboeck L. Gingl E. Luzi E. Riefler J. Di Leva F. Karra D. Thomas S. Kiebler M.A. Macchi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 3222-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, a gene homologous to Scn1a is not found in the X. laevis genome. Erk2 and eIF4E are continuously expressed during oocyte maturation (33Git A. Allison R. Perdiguero E. Nebreda A.R. Houliston E. Standart N. RNA. 2009; 15: 1121-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 34Cao Q. Richter J.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3852-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and p38α does not play a role in Xenopus oocyte maturation (35Perdiguero E. Pillaire M.J. Bodart J.F. Hennersdorf F. Frödin M. Duesbery N.S. Alonso G. Nebreda A.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5746-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it is unlikely that the translation of mRNAs encoding Erk2, p38α, eIF4E, and Scn1a are regulated by Pum2 in Xenopus oocytes, in contrast to mammalian cells. Although RINGO mRNA has been reported to be a target of Pum2 in Xenopus oocytes (20Padmanabhan K. Richter J.D. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), our findings seem to contradict this idea as already noted. Therefore, it remains a mystery what mRNAs are regulated by the Pum2-containing machinery in Xenopus. In humans, 61 mRNAs have been reported to be potential targets of Pum2 and DAZL (36Fox M. Urano J. Reijo Pera R.A. Genomics. 2005; 85: 92-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Some of them might be regulated by Pum2 also in frogs. Identification of target mRNAs of Pum2 and evaluation of the biological significance of Pumilio phosphorylation in translational activation of their target mRNAs should provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying the temporal control of translational activation of mRNAs during Xenopus oocyte maturation.In this study, we obtained results strongly suggesting the release of PARN from some, but not all, of cyclin B1 mRNAs during oocyte maturation (Fig. 5I). This finding implies that cyclin B1 mRNAs stockpiled in oocytes are not uniform and that their translation is controlled differently during the processes of oocyte maturation, fertilization, and embryogenesis. Indeed, cyclin B1 mRNA has been reported to be enriched in the mitotic spindle pole (37Blower M.D. Feric E. Weis K. Heald R. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), with which Maskin and CPEB are also associated (38Barnard D.C. Cao Q. Richter J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 7605-7615Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The spindle-associated cyclin B1 mRNAs may be controlled differently from those dispersed in the cytoplasm or those localized to other cytoskeletal components. For example, oocyte maturation includes several morphological changes accompanying the progression of meiosis from prophase I to metaphase II, such as GVBD, chromosome condensation, and spindle formation (39Kotani T. Yamashita M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 252: 271-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is plausible that these events are induced by spatially controlled translation of cyclin B1 mRNAs localized to the nuclear envelope, chromosomes, and spindle microtubules, respectively. Further studies are required to disclose the molecular mechanisms that enable the translational activation of localized mRNAs at specific timings (40Yasuda K. Kotani T. Ota R. Yamashita M. Dev. Biol. 2010; 348: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). IntroductionIn many species, oocytes stop their meiotic cell cycle at the first prophase, during which time they grow by accumulation of proteins and mRNAs necessary for subsequent developmental processes. In response to hormonal stimulation, e.g. progesterone in frogs, the immature oocytes resume meiosis to mature, a process called oocyte maturation (1Nagahama Y. Yamashita M. Dev. Growth Differ. 2008; 50: S195-S219Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The final inducer of oocyte maturation is the maturation-promoting factor (MPF), 2The abbreviations used are: MPFmaturation-promoting factorCPEcytoplasmic polyadenylation elementCPEBCPE-binding proteinCPSFcleavage and polyadenylation specificity factorDAZLDeleted in Azoospermia-like proteinEBextraction bufferGVBDgerminal vesicle breakdownIPimmunoprecipitationRINGOrapid inducer of G2-M in oocytes. which consists of cyclin B-bound cdc2. In Xenopus, MPF is stockpiled in immature oocytes as an inactive form called pre-MPF, and its activation induces oocyte maturation. In addition to the activation of pre-MPF, the normal progression of oocyte maturation, including the transition from meiosis I to meiosis II without intervening DNA synthesis, is ensured by the continued synthesis of cyclin B1 protein, which depends on the translational activation of cyclin B1 mRNA stored in the oocytes (2Belloc E. Méndez R. Nature. 2008; 452: 1017-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One of the mechanisms that regulate the translational activation of mRNA is cytoplasmic polyadenylation, in which cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA plays a critical role (3Mendez R. Richter J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 4Richter J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 279-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In fact, the translational activation of cyclin B1 mRNA during oocyte maturation is under the CPE-mediated control, which involves dynamic changes in interactions among several key proteins, including CPE-binding protein (CPEB), Symplekin, Maskin, cleavage, and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), PARN, and GLD2 (4Richter J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 279-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 5Radford H.E. Meijer H.A. de Moor C.H. Biochim. Biophys.

RNA. 2005; 11: 1117-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Besides cyclin B1 mRNA, mos and wee1 mRNAs also carry the CPE sequence in the 3′-UTR, and their translation is regulated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation. However, the timings of translational activation are different in the mRNAs during oocyte maturation (7de Moor C.H. Richter J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8Charlesworth A. Welk J. MacNicol A.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 706-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Charlesworth A.

Yamashita M. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 865-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Accordingly, oocytes must have additional mechanisms that define the precise timing of translational activation of each CPE-containing mRNA during oocyte maturation. Indeed, it has been shown that the Musashi-binding element (11Arumugam K. Wang Y. Hardy L.L. MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the Pumilio-binding element (10Nakahata S. Kotani T. Mita K. Kawasaki T. Katsu Y. Nagahama Y. Yamashita M. Mech.

MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. Dev. Biol. 2008; 317: 454-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) in the 3′-UTR play important roles as cis-elements in the temporal control of translation of mos, cyclin B1, and wee1 mRNA, respectively, during Xenopus oocyte maturation (14MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2010; 77: 662-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These cis-elements are recognized by trans-acting proteins specific to each element as follows: Musashi for Musashi-binding element, Pumilio for Pumilio-binding element, and an unidentified protein for translational control sequence. However, these proteins have not yet been fully characterized biochemically.Pumilio homologs have been identified in various organisms, from yeast to humans, and constitute a large and evolutionarily conserved protein family, the Puf family (15Wickens M. Bernstein D.S. Kimble J. Parker R. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 150-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, the Puf family consists of two members, Pumilio1 (Pum1) and Pumilio2 (Pum2) (16Spassov D.S. Jurecic R. Gene. 2002; 299: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Spassov D.S. Jurecic R. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2003; 30: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Kurisaki I. Iwai T.

Han J.Y. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2008; 75: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Because a Pumilio homolog that we previously identified in Xenopus (12Nakahata S. Katsu Y. Mita K. Inoue K. Nagahama Y. Yamashita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20945-20953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) resembles human and mouse Pum1 rather than Pum2, it should be Xenopus Pum1. Xenopus Pum1 is bound to cyclin B1 mRNA in immature oocytes (12Nakahata S. Katsu Y. Mita K. Inoue K. Nagahama Y. Yamashita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20945-20953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Injection of anti-Pum1 antibody or overexpression of Pum1 protein has a significant impact on the timing of oocyte maturation and cyclin B1 synthesis specifically, suggesting the involvement of Pum1 in translational control of cyclin B1 mRNA (10Nakahata S. Kotani T. Mita K. Kawasaki T. Katsu Y. Nagahama Y. Yamashita M. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 865-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition to Pum1, Xenopus oocytes contain another member of the Puf family, Pum2, which was reported to regulate the translation of mRNA encoding rapid inducer of G2-M in oocytes (RINGO), a cyclin B1-like molecule responsible for inducing oocyte maturation, in cooperation with Deleted in Azoospermia-like protein (DAZL) (20Padmanabhan K. Richter J.D. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that Pum1 and Pum2 contribute to oocyte maturation by controlling the translation of different target mRNAs. However, little is known about their biochemical characteristics, including expression patterns, their biochemical modifications, and their interacting proteins during oocyte maturation. In this study, we biochemically characterized Pum1 and Pum2 in Xenopus oocytes by using newly produced antibodies that discriminate between Pum1 and Pum2. In many species, oocytes stop their meiotic cell cycle at the first prophase, during which time they grow by accumulation of proteins and mRNAs necessary for subsequent developmental processes. In response to hormonal stimulation, e.g. progesterone in frogs, the immature oocytes resume meiosis to mature, a process called oocyte maturation (1Nagahama Y. Yamashita M. Dev.

https://openalex.org/W2059153946,"Neurite outgrowth is essential for development of the nervous system. Neurotrophins including BDNF are among extracellular signals that regulate neurite outgrowth. The ERK1/2 pathway contributes to intracellular signaling networks transducing the pro-neuritic effects of BDNF. In the nucleolus, RNA polymerase-1 (Pol1)-mediated transcription regulates ribosomal biogenesis, enabling cellular protein synthesis and growth. Hence, we tested the possibility that Pol1 is an effector for pro-neuritic signals such as BDNF. We report that Pol1-mediated nucleolar transcription was increased by BDNF in an ERK1/2-dependent manner in rat forebrain neurons. Conversely, in cultured hippocampal neurons, knockdown of a Pol1 coactivator, transcription initiation factor 1A (TIF1A), attenuated BDNF- or ERK1/2-induced neurite outgrowth. Also, upon overexpression, a constitutively active mutant of TIF1A strongly promoted neurite outgrowth, including increases in total neurite length and branching. Finally, overexpression of wild-type TIF1A enhanced the pro-neuritic effects of ERK1/2 activation. These observations indicate that the Pol1-mediated nucleolar transcription regulates neurite outgrowth and serves as a major pro-neuritic effector of the BDNF-activated ERK1/2 pathway. Thus, development of the nervous system appears critically dependent on the nucleolus."

Phosphorylation of ATF1 at Ser-63 in its kinase-inducible domain by serine/threonine kinases enhances its transactivation activity by promoting recruitment of the coactivator CREB-binding protein/p300 (21Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). ATF1 is overexpressed in lymphomas and transformed lymphocytes (22Hsueh Y.P. Lai M.Z. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5675-5683PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that ATF1 may contribute to the growth of these tumor cells. ATF1 is up-regulated in metastatic melanoma cells, and inhibition of ATF1 suppresses their tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in nude mice (23Jean D. Tellez C. Huang S. Davis D.W. Bruns C.J. McConkey D.J. Hinrichs S.H. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2721-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Constitutive activation of ATF1 mediates EWS-ATF1 (Ewing sarcoma protein), transforming phenotypes and unique features of clear cell sarcoma (24Brown A.D. Lopez-Terrada D. Denny C. Lee K.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1749-1756PubMed Google Scholar). However, the upstream kinases and the role of ATF1 in proliferation and cell transformation have not been completely elucidated. Flavonoids are ubiquitously found in fruits and vegetables as well as popular beverages, including wine, tea, and coffee (25Hollman P.C. Katan M.B. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1999; 37: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Flavonoids also exhibit antioxidant, antitumor, and anti-inflammatory effects (25Hollman P.C. Katan M.B. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1999; 37: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). In particular, their antitumor activity has attracted much attention as a possible dietary prevention strategy against carcinogenesis (26Zhou Q. Yan B. Hu X. Li X.B. Zhang J. Fang J. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2009; 8: 1684-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 27Li Z.D. Hu X.W. Wang Y.T. Fang J. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 1999-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our recent study demonstrated that kaempferol is a natural compound that specifically inhibits RSK2 N-terminal kinase activity (28Cho Y.Y. Yao K. Pugliese A. Malakhova M.L. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4398-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Eriodictyol is a major flavonoid extracted from Yerba Santa (Eriodictyon californicum) and has a similar structure to kaempferol. Eriodictyol is found in lemon, lime, sour orange, and peppermint. Research data have shown that eriodictyol also exerts antioxidant, antitumor, and anti-inflammatory effects (29Clavin M. Gorzalczany S. Macho A. Muñoz E. Ferraro G. Acevedo C. Martino V. J. Ethnopharmacol. 2007; 112: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting that eriodictyol might also inhibit cell proliferation and transformation. However, the underlying mechanism and target protein(s) of eriodictyol have not yet been clarified. In this study, we show that ATF1 is a novel substrate of RSK2. The phosphorylation of ATF1 at Ser-63 by RSK2 induces ATF1 transactivation and transcriptional activity. Inhibition of RSK2 activity by eriodictyol suppressed ATF1 activities and RSK2-ATF1-mediated cell transformation. These results demonstrate that the inhibition of RSK2 activity by eriodictyol modulates RSK2-ATF1 signaling in cell proliferation and transformation. Therefore, we suggest that eriodictyol is a potential natural compound for chemoprevention. Eriodictyol (>95% purity), Tris, NaCl, and SDS were from Sigma. CNBr-Sepharose 4B, glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and the chemiluminescence detection kit were from Amersham Biosciences. The protein assay kit was from Bio-Rad. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from New England Biolabs. G418 and the luciferase assay substrate were from Promega. Eagle's minimal essential medium was from Invitrogen. Antibodies for Western blot analysis were from Cell Signaling Technology, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Abcam, and Millipore. Culture of JB6 Cl41 cells and RSK2+/+ and RSK2−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) was described previously (13Cho Y.Y. Yao K. Kim H.G. Kang B.S. Zheng D. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8104-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Transfection of the various expression vectors and luciferase reporter plasmids was conducted using jetPEI (Polyplus Transfection, New York, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eriodictyol was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; 50 mm stock solution), aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C. Eriodictyol was mixed with complete cell culture medium at various doses, and the final DMSO concentration was not >0.1% of the total media volume. Proliferation of JB6 Cl41 cells and viability of RSK2+/+ and RSK2−/− MEFs were measured using the MTS assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmids for GST-tagged or His-tagged fusion proteins including ATF1 and ATF1-S63A were purified from BL21 bacteria using glutathione-Sepharose 4B or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads. The purified fusion proteins (1 μg; ∼90% purity) were used for in vitro kinase assays with 20 ng of active RSK2 (Millipore) and visualized by autoradiography or Western blotting as described (28Cho Y.Y. Yao K. Pugliese A. Malakhova M.L. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4398-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cell cycle was analyzed by propidium iodide staining using the FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) as described by Ahmad et al. (30Ahmad N. Feyes D.K. Nieminen A.L. Agarwal R. Mukhtar H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1881-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). To screen for protein-binding partners, we used the mammalian two-hybrid assay following the Promega CheckMateTM mammalian two-hybrid system protocol as described previously (11Cho Y.Y. He Z. Zhang Y. Choi H.S. Zhu F. Choi B.Y. Kang B.S. Ma W.Y. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3596-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The relative luciferase activity was calculated using the pG5-luciferase basal control by transfection of pG5-luciferase/pACT-mock/pBIND-RSK2 and normalized against Renilla luciferase activity, which included the pBIND vector. JB6 C141 cells (6 × 104) were cultured in 12-well plates for 24 h before transfection. The p5×Gal4-luciferase reporter plasmid was transfected with pcDNA4-RSK2 and the expression vector for Gal4-ATF1 or Gal4-ATF1-S63A. Cells were cultured for 36 h and then disrupted for firefly luciferase activity analysis. The reporter gene vector phRL-SV40 (Promega) was cotransfected into each cell line, and the transfection efficiencies were normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity generated by this vector. The effects of eriodictyol on EGF-induced transformation were investigated in JB6 C141 cells as described by Colburn et al. (31Colburn N.H. Wendel E.J. Abruzzo G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 6912-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Colonies were counted under a microscope with the Image-Pro Plus software program (Version 6, Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Sepharose 4B beads (0.3 g) were washed with 30 ml of 1 mm HCl three times for 5 min each by gentle inversion and then incubated with 3 mg of eriodictyol or DMSO in coupling buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3 and 0.5 m NaCl (pH 8.3)) at 4 °C overnight. The samples were washed five times with coupling buffer and incubated with blocking buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) at 4 °C overnight. The samples were alternatively washed with 0.1 m acetic acid buffer (pH 4.0) and with 0.1 m Tris-HCl and 0.5 m NaCl (pH 8.0) three times and then resuspended in 1 ml of PBS for use. For pulldown assays, eriodictyol-Sepharose 4B beads (100 μl, 50% slurry) were combined with purified RSK2 or a cellular supernatant fraction of JB6 C141 cells (500 μg) overnight. Bound RSK2 proteins were visualized by Western blotting as described (28Cho Y.Y. Yao K. Pugliese A. Malakhova M.L. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4398-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A focus formation assay using NIH3T3 cells was conducted according to standard protocols (24Brown A.D. Lopez-Terrada D. Denny C. Lee K.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1749-1756PubMed Google Scholar). Foci were fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet and counted using the Image-Pro Plus software program (Version 6). To build a model of the active form of the RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain, we conducted homology modeling based on the active conformation of the RSK1 N-terminal kinase domain, which was crystallized with the inhibitor staurosporine at a resolution of 2.00 Å (Protein Data Bank code 2z7r). ClustalW was used to align the RSK2 and RSK1 sequences, wherein they were shown to possess an identity of 85% and a similarity of 90% (32Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F. Wallace I.M. Wilm A. Lopez R. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 2947-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (21916) Google Scholar). Using Modeller 9v4 (33Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10294) Google Scholar), we created a template structure of RSK2 based on the active structure of RSK1. To ensure an adequate bound protein form, waters and staurosporine were added from the crystal structure of RSK1 using MAESTRO 9.0 and were allowed to relax with OPLS_2005 force field. This was performed using MacroModel 9.7 following standard minimization procedures (34Schroginger Suite Induced Fit Docking Protocol, Glid Version 5.5, Prime version 2.1. Schrondinger, LLC, New York2009Google Scholar). Kaempferol and eriodictyol were both built and minimized and underwent extensive conformational searches followed by subsequent minimization using MacroModel to determine the lowest energy conformations for docking. Staurosporine as the reference compound was subjected to similar strategies except starting from its crystallized bound orientation. The Induced Fit module was used for docking because both ligand and binding site residue flexibility are provided for, thereby mimicking reality (34Schroginger Suite Induced Fit Docking Protocol, Glid Version 5.5, Prime version 2.1. Schrondinger, LLC, New York2009Google Scholar). The recommended parameters for induced fit docking were used where the receptor and ligand van der Waals scaling was kept at 0.50 with a total number of poses as 20. Only residues within 5.0 Å were refined. Glide redocked the ligands, using standard precision, into the structures within 30.0 kcal/mol of the best active-site orientation and only within the top 20 structures. To identify novel substrate(s) of RSK2, we conducted a mammalian two-hybrid assay with 32 transcription factors (11Cho Y.Y. He Z. Zhang Y. Choi H.S. Zhu F. Choi B.Y. Kang B.S. Ma W.Y. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3596-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We found that the luciferase activity representing the binding of RSK2 and ATF1, a member of the CREB/ATF transcription factor family, was ∼7-fold higher than that of the mock control. This binding was slightly higher than RSK2 binding with known protein partners such as ATF4 (∼5-fold) and E2F6 (∼5.5-fold) (Fig. 1A). To confirm the binding of RSK2 and ATF1, pACT-ATF1 and pcDNA4-RSK2 were introduced into 293T cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-VP16 antibody. Co-immunoprecipitated RSK2 was detected with anti-His antibody by Western blotting (Fig. 1B, upper panel). Furthermore, endogenous ATF1 co-precipitated with endogenous RSK2 (Fig. 1B, lower panel), indicating that RSK2 and ATF1 are binding partners. To determine whether RSK2 phosphorylates ATF1, we conducted an in vitro kinase assay with a commercially available active RSK2 protein and purified GST-ATF1 (35Zheng D. Cho Y.Y. Lau A.T. Zhang J. Ma W.Y. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7650-7660Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and [32P]ATP. The results indicated that RSK2 phosphorylated ATF1 (Fig. 1C). To identify the amino acid(s) phosphorylated by RSK2, we searched the RSK2 phosphorylation consensus sequence of ATF1 using the Group-based Prediction System (Version 2.1) (Fig. 1D). The data indicated that Ser-63 of ATF1 had a 3.182 score/cutoff value for RSK2 compared with a 1.756 score/cutoff value for MSK1 (mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1), which is a known kinase of ATF1 (Ser-63) (Fig. 1D, table). To confirm this prediction, we conducted an in vitro kinase assay with GST-ATF1 and active RSK2. The results indicated that RSK2 phosphorylated ATF1 at Ser-63 (Fig. 1D, lower left panel). We confirmed that RSK2 phosphorylated ATF1 at Ser-63 using an in vitro kinase assay and a point mutant of ATF1 with Ser-63 replaced with alanine (His-ATF1-S63A) (35Zheng D. Cho Y.Y. Lau A.T. Zhang J. Ma W.Y. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7650-7660Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and active RSK2 and [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 1D, lower right panel). Overall, these results demonstrate that ATF1 is phosphorylated at Ser-63 by RSK2. We have demonstrated that RSK2 plays an important role in proliferation and transformation and that RSK2 protein abundance is higher in human skin cancer tissues compared with normal skin (28Cho Y.Y. Yao K. Pugliese A. Malakhova M.L. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4398-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that kaempferol inhibits RSK2 N-terminal kinase activity (13Cho Y.Y. Yao K. Kim H.G. Kang B.S. Zheng D. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8104-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 28Cho Y.Y. Yao K. Pugliese A. Malakhova M.L. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4398-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Eriodictyol is a flavanone extracted from Yerba Santa, a plant native to North America, and has a structure similar to that of kaempferol (supplemental Fig. 1). We hypothesized that eriodictyol might also inhibit RSK2 N-terminal kinase activity. We built a model of the RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain based on the crystal structure of the active form of RSK1 complexed with staurosporine at a resolution of 2.00 Å (Protein Data Bank code 2z7r). We found that the preference of binding was staurosporine > kaempferol > eriodictyol, with binding affinities of −11.514, −9.216, and −8.816 kcal/mol, respectively. We observed that eriodictyol docked nicely into the ATP-binding active site of RSK2 (Fig. 2A, left panel). Furthermore, we discovered that important hydrogen bonds are formed between the inhibitor and hinge region (i.e. backbone of Asp-148 and Leu-150) and with the aspartic acid of the DFG motif in the back cleft of the active site (Asp-211) (Fig. 2A, right panel). By comparing the docking of kaempferol and eriodictyol, we found that the aromatic substituent group of eriodictyol was rotated out of plane (supplemental Fig. 2). This rotation might be due to the lack of the double bond and hydroxyl group in eriodictyol (supplemental Fig. 1). To verify binding of eriodictyol with RSK2, we conducted a pulldown assay with eriodictyol-conjugated beads and commercially available active RSK2. The results indicated that eriodictyol bound with RSK2 (Fig. 2B, upper panel). To identify the specific binding domain, we used purified truncated and full-length RSK2 proteins (28Cho Y.Y. Yao K. Pugliese A. Malakhova M.L. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4398-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and eriodictyol-conjugated beads. The results demonstrated that eriodictyol bound strongly with the N-terminal kinase domain of RSK2 (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Notably, we confirmed in cell lysates that eriodictyol bound with endogenous RSK2 (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrated that eriodictyol is a natural compound that binds with the RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain. To verify the effect of eriodictyol on RSK2 activity, we conducted an in vitro kinase assay with GST-ATF1, active RSK2, [γ-32P]ATP, and different doses of eriodictyol. The autoradiography results demonstrated that eriodictyol inhibited RSK2-mediated ATF1 phosphorylation dose-dependently (Fig. 2D). To determine the significance of ATF1 phosphorylation at Ser-63, we analyzed the transactivation activity of WT and mutant (S63A) ATF1. As expected, ATF1-S63A suppressed transactivation activity (Fig. 3A), indicating that Ser-63 is important in regulating ATF1 activity. To examine the effect of RSK2 on ATF1 transactivation, we rescued RSK2 expression in RSK2−/− MEFs by transduction of pBabe-puro-RSK2-WT and found that phosphorylated and total ATF1 and RSK2 expression was restored (Fig. 3B). We further found that the suppressed ATF1 transactivation in RSK2−/− MEFs was restored in rescued RSK2−/−/RSK2 cells to almost the same level as in RSK2+/+ MEFs (Fig. 3B, lower panel). Furthermore, when we treated JB6 cells with nontoxic doses of eriodictyol (supplemental Fig. 3), EGF-induced transactivation was suppressed (Fig. 3C), and ATF1 transcriptional activity was inhibited (Fig. 3D). Overall, these results indicate that RSK2 plays an important role in the regulation of ATF1 activity by phosphorylating ATF1 at Ser-63. To examine the role of RSK2-ATF1 signaling in cell proliferation and transformation, we analyzed the level of EGF-induced phosphorylation of ATF1 when treated with different doses of eriodictyol. EGF-induced RSK phosphorylation was not affected by eriodictyol (Fig. 4A). However, EGF-induced phosphorylation of ATF1 at Ser-63 and total c-Fos protein abundance were decreased dose-dependently by eriodictyol (Fig. 4A). In addition, eriodictyol had no effect on phosphorylation of MEK-ERK signaling, including MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 (Fig. 4B). Eriodictyol did not affect phosphorylation of p38, JNKs, or Akt (Fig. 4C). The proliferation of JB6 Cl41 cells was decreased dose-dependently by eriodictyol (Fig. 5A, left panel), an effect that is probably associated with its inhibition of the G1/S cell cycle transition (right panel). We compared the effect of eriodictyol on proliferation of RSK2+/+, RSK2−/−, and rescued RSK2−/−/RSK2 MEFs. We found that eriodictyol inhibited proliferation in RSK2+/+ MEFs (Fig. 5B, left panel). However, eriodictyol had no effect on proliferation of RSK2−/− MEFs (Fig. 5B, middle panel). Importantly, rescued RSK2−/−/RSK2 cells regained sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of eriodictyol on proliferation to the same degree as RSK2+/+ MEFs (Fig. 5B, right panel). We confirmed that eriodictyol was not cytotoxic in MEFs up to 25 μm (supplemental Fig. 3B). Furthermore, additional results indicated that eriodictyol inhibited EGF-induced cell transformation dose-dependently (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that eriodictyol suppresses RSK2 N-terminal kinase activity, resulting in the suppression of EGF-induced cell proliferation and transformation.FIGURE 5Eriodictyol inhibits proliferation and transformation of JB6 Cl41 cells. A, eriodictyol inhibits cell proliferation by causing arrest at the G0/G1 cell cycle. Left panel, eriodictyol inhibits proliferation. JB6 Cl41 cells (1 × 103 cells/well) were treated with the indicated doses of eriodictyol, and proliferation was measured at the indicated time points using the MTS assay. Data are shown as means ± S.D. from triplicate independent experiments. *, significant (p < 0.05) difference in proliferation compared with the DMSO-treated control. Right panel, JB6 Cl41 cells were treated with EGF and eriodictyol for 18 h, and cell cycle distribution was measured by flow cytometry with propidium iodide. Data are expressed as the percentage of cells in G1/G0, S, or G2/M and are shown as means ± S.D. of values from triplicate experiments. *, significant (p < 0.05) change in G0/G1 and S phase cell cycle distribution compared with the EGF-stimulated group. B, eriodictyol-mediated inhibition of proliferation is attenuated in RSK2 deficiency. RSK2+/+ (left panel), RSK2−/− (middle panel), and WT RSK2-transfected RSK2−/− (right panel) MEFS were treated with the indicated doses of eriodictyol, and viability was assessed at the indicated time points by the MTS assay. Data are shown as means ± S.D. of values from triplicate experiments. *, significant (p < 0.05) change in viability compared with untreated control. C, eriodictyol suppresses EGF-induced anchorage-independent colony formation in soft agar. Cells (8 × 103) were exposed to EGF (10 ng/ml) with various doses of eriodictyol in 1 ml of 0.3% Eagle's basal medium-agar containing 10% FBS. Cells were cultured, and colonies were counted using a microscope and the Image-Pro Plus computer software program (Version 6). Data are shown as means ± S.D. of values from triplicate experiments. *, significant (p < 0.05) decrease in colony number compared with the untreated control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To explore the role of ATF1 in EGF-induced transformation, we established JB6 Cl41 mouse epidermal skin cells stably expressing ATF1 or ATF1 shRNA and conducted an anchorage-independent cell transformation assay in soft agar (Fig. 6A). EGF induced more colony formation in ATF1-overexpressing JB6 Cl41 cells compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig. 6A and supplemental Fig. 4A). In contrast, knockdown of ATF1 inhibited EGF-induced colony formation in soft agar (Fig. 6A and supplemental Fig. 4A), indicating that ATF1 plays an important role in EGF-induced transformation of JB6 Cl41 cells. We confirmed the relationship of colony formation with ATF1 protein level by Western blotting (Fig. 6A). To further examine the role of endogenous RSK2-ATF1 signaling in cell transformation, we conducted a RasG12V-mediated focus formation assay in NIH3T3 cells (13Cho Y.Y. Yao K. Kim H.G. Kang B.S. Zheng D. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8104-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We introduced various combinations of RasG12V, RSK2, ATF1, ATF1 shRNA, RSK2 siRNA, and eriodictyol into NIH3T3 cells, and focus formation was measured. The results indicated that RasG12V induced focus formation and that RasG12V/RSK2 substantially enhanced focus formation (Fig. 6B and supplemental Fig. 4B). RasG12V/RSK2-induced focus number was increased more by co-introduction of RasG12V/RSK2/ATF1, and knockdown of RSK2 or ATF1 by siRNA or shRNA suppressed focus formation (Fig. 6B and supplemental Fig. 4B). Furthermore, eriodictyol suppressed focus formation in a manner similar to knockdown of RSK2 (Fig. 6B and supplemental Fig. 4B). To examine the role of ATF1 mutation at Ser-63 in cell transformation, we introduced combinations of RasG12V, ATF1, ATF1-S63A, and ATF1 shRNA into NIH3T3 cells, and focus formation was measured. The results indicated that RasG12V/ATF1 enhanced focus formation compared with RasG12V alone, whereas ATF1-S63A or ATF1 shRNA attenuated RasG12V induced focus formation (Fig. 6C). To confirm ATF1 phosphorylation by combinational coexpression of RasG12V, RSK2, and ATF1, we conducted Western blotting using NIH3T3 cells. We confirmed that the transfected expression vectors were well expressed, and the ATF1-S63A mutation inhibited phosphorylation of ATF1 at Ser-63, which was enhanced by RasG12V or RasG12V/RSK2 (supplemental Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results indicate that ATF1 mutated at Ser-63 might act as a dominant-negative mutant. Overall, these results indicate that RSK2-ATF1 signaling plays an important role in neoplastic cell transformation. When cells are stimulated with tumor promoters, EGF or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, phosphorylation of RSK is increased within 5 min, and stable expression of RSK2 in JB6 C141 cells significantly enhances colony formation in either the presence or absence of tumor promoters (13Cho Y.Y. Yao K. Kim H.G. Kang B.S. Zheng D. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8104-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Moreover, RSK2 is overexpressed in skin tumor tissues and many cancer cell lines compared with normal skin and cells (28Cho Y.Y. Yao K. Pugliese A. Malakhova M.L. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4398-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). RSK2 plays a critical role in FGFR3-induced hematopoietic transformation (36Kang S. Elf S. Dong S. Hitosugi T. Lythgoe K. Guo A. Ruan H. Lonial S. Khoury H.J. Williams I.R. Lee B.H. Roesel J.L. Karsenty G. Hanauer A. Taunton J. Boggon T.J. Gu T.L. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 2105-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, proliferation is suppressed in RSK2−/− MEFs compared with RSK2+/+ MEFs, and the effect is associated with an impairment of the G1/S cell cycle transition (13Cho Y.Y. Yao K. Kim H.G. Kang B.S. Zheng D. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8104-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our previous study indicated that RSK2 might have multiple substrates involved in cell proliferation and carcinogenesis (11Cho Y.Y. He Z. Zhang Y. Choi H.S. Zhu F. Choi B.Y. Kang B.S. Ma W.Y. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3596-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). ATF1 is a transcription factor of the CREB family (15Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar), and tumors highly express the ATF1 protein. Expression of ATF1 is up-regulated in lymphomas (22Hsueh Y.P. Lai M.Z. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5675-5683PubMed Google Scholar) and melanomas (23Jean D. Tellez C. Huang S. Davis D.W. Bruns C.J. McConkey D.J. Hinrichs S.H. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2721-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and contributes to the growth of these cancers. Constitutive activation of ATF1 mediates EWS-ATF1, transforming the phenotype's unique features of clear cell carcinoma (24Brown A.D. Lopez-Terrada D. Denny C. Lee K.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1749-1756PubMed Google Scholar, 37Zucman J. Delattre O. Desmaze C. Epstein A.L. Stenman G. Speleman F. Fletchers C.D. Aurias A. Thomas G. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that ATF1 is a novel substrate of RSK2 (Fig. 1) and that RSK2 phosphorylated ATF1 at Ser-63, which is a key amino acid for regulation of ATF1 transcriptional and transactivation activities (Figs. 1D and 3). We found that knockdown of RSK2 inhibited RSK2-mediated ATF1 cell transformation (Fig. 6B) and that eriodictyol-mediated proliferation was suppressed in RSK2+/+ MEFs but not in RSK2−/− MEFs (Fig. 5B), indicating that RSK2-ATF1 signaling plays an important role in cell proliferation and transformation. Recently, we found that kaempferol binds and inhibits RSK2 N-terminal kinase activity by occupying the ATP-binding pocket (28Cho Y.Y. Yao K. Pugliese A. Malakhova M.L. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4398-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Eriodictyol is a natural chemical compound found in many plants, and its structure is very similar to that of kaempferol (supplemental Fig. 1). We found that eriodictyol also strongly bound with the N-terminal kinase domain of RSK2 (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, ATF1 is involved in skin cancer and melanoma development (23Jean D. Tellez C. Huang S. Davis D.W. Bruns C.J. McConkey D.J. Hinrichs S.H. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2721-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suggesting that RSK2-ATF1 signaling is involved in skin carcinogenesis. We demonstrated that RSK2 regulated ATF1 activity (Fig. 3B) and that eriodictyol inhibited EGF-induced cell transformation in soft agar (Fig. 5C). These results paralleled the knockdown effect of RSK2 in cell transformation induced by constitutively active RasG12V (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, RasG12V/RSK2/ATF1-mediated focus formation was inhibited by eriodictyol (Fig. 6B), indicating that eriodictyol is a potential chemopreventive agent that can modulate RSK2 kinase activity by binding to the RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain. Activation of CREB family members is induced by various stimuli, including growth factors, stress signals, neurotransmitters, and other agents (15Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). The transactivation domain of ATF1 consists of a kinase-inducible domain and a glutamine-rich constitutive activation domain (Q2). Because ATF1 phosphorylation promotes recruitment of CREB-binding protein/p300, a core protein in the transcriptional machinery, leading to enhancement of transactivation and transcriptional activity (21Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar), our finding that RSK2 phosphorylates ATF1 at Ser-63 in the kinase-inducible domain is important. Furthermore, ATF1 can be phosphorylated at Ser-63 by PKA (16Liu F. Thompson M.A. Wagner S. Greenberg M.E. Green M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6714-6720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I/II (16Liu F. Thompson M.A. Wagner S. Greenberg M.E. Green M.R. J. Biol.

In response to EGF or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulation, ATF1 can also be phosphorylated by MSK1/2 (18Gupta P. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50550-50556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 39Arthur J.S. Cohen P.

Biol. 2002; 22: 2871-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), but in MSK1/MSK2 double knock-out embryonic fibroblasts, mitogen-induced phosphorylation of ATF1 at Ser-63 is reduced but not totally abolished (40Wiggin G.R. Soloaga A. Foster J.M. Murray-Tait V. Cohen P. Arthur J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2871-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), suggesting phosphorylation by additional kinases. We found that ectopic expression of ATF1 in JB6 Cl41 cells stimulated EGF-induced transformation and ATF1 activation (Figs. 3C and 6A) and that knockdown of ATF1 inhibited cell transformation (Fig. 6A). We also found that ectopic expression of RasG12V/RSK2 enhanced focus formation (Fig. 6B) and that knockdown of ATF1 in RasG12V/RSK2-overexpressing cells suppressed focus formation (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, eriodictyol treatment showed an effect that was similar to knockdown of RSK2 and ATF1 in focus formation (Fig. 6B). Importantly, rescue of RSK2 in RSK2−/− MEFs recovered ATF1 phosphorylation at Ser-63 and ATF1 transactivation activity (Fig. 3B), indicating that the RSK2-ATF1 signaling pathway plays an important role in cell transformation and that eriodictyol is a potential natural chemopreventive compound for targeting RSK2.

We now report that in vitro selection of HIV-1 variants resistant to sifuvirtide in the presence of increasing concentrations of sifuvirtide has led to several specific mutations in the gp41 region that had not been previously reported. Many of these substitutions were confined to the N-terminal heptad repeat region at positions 37, 38, 41, and 43, either singly or in combination. A downstream substitution at position 126 (N126K) in the C-terminal heptad repeat region was also found. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have further identified the critical amino acid substitutions and combinations thereof in conferring the resistant genotypes. Furthermore, the mutant viruses demonstrated variable degrees of cross-resistance to enfuvirtide, some of which are preferentially more resistant to sifuvirtide. Impaired infectivity was also found for many of the mutant viruses. Biophysical and structural analyses of the key substitutions have revealed several potential novel mechanisms against sifuvirtide. Our results may help to predict potential resistant patterns in vivo and facilitate the further clinical development and therapeutic utility of sifuvirtide.

The envelope glycoprotein (Env) of HIV-1 is critical in mediating viral entry into the target cells, and it represents a major target for the development of novel antiretroviral therapeutics. The entry process starts with the binding of gp120 to a cellular receptor, CD4, and subsequently with a chemokine receptor, CCR5 or CXCR4, on the surface of the target cells (1Melikyan G.B. Retrovirology. 2008; 5: 111Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These interactions trigger a cascade of conformational changes that lead to the formation of a prehairpin intermediate of gp41 in which the hydrophobic N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) 2The abbreviations used are: NHR, N-terminal heptad repeat; CHR, C-terminal heptad repeat; 6-HB, six-helix bundle. is exposed and allows the fusion peptides to insert into the target cell membrane (1Melikyan G.B.

This transient gp41 intermediate then refolds into a stabilized trimer of hairpins, also called the six-helix bundle (6-HB) structure, which brings the viral envelope and the target cell membrane into close proximity, thus facilitating the completion of the fusion process (1Melikyan G.B.

Structure and function studies indicate that the 6-HB core consists of a parallel trimeric coiled-coil of NHR with the C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) wrapped on the outside in an antiparallel fashion (5Chan D.C.

We have previously characterized a new generation peptide-based fusion inhibitor known as sifuvirtide, which has an improved stability, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral potency, as compared with enfuvirtide (29He Y.

In this report, we describe the in vitro selection and characterization of HIV-1 variants with relative resistance to sifuvirtide. We derived resistant variants of HIV-1 NL4-3 by serial passage in the presence of increasing concentrations of sifuvirtide. By sequencing analysis of resistant variants, we have identified several novel specific mutations in the NHR and CHR regions in gp41 associated with observed resistant phenotypes. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have further identified the critical amino acid substitutions in conferring the resistant genotypes to sifuvirtide and cross-resistance to enfuvirtide. Finally, biophysical and structural analyses of these substitutions have revealed several potential mechanisms against sifuvirtide. These results may help to predict potential patterns of resistance in vivo and may facilitate the further clinical development and therapeutic utility of sifuvirtide. MT4 cells were seeded at 3 × 105/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum on a 96-well plate. Serial dilutions of wild-type virus, molecular clone NL4-3, were added and followed by incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 5 days. The concentration of sifuvirtide required to inhibit 50% viral infection was calculated based on the cytopathic effect. For selection of sifuvirtide-resistant virus, we initially used 7.8 ng/ml sifuvirtide for wild-type virus, which can inhibit virus replication by about 90%. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 until extensive cytopathic effect was observed, and supernatants were used for the next passage in MT4 cells with 1.5–2-fold increasing concentrations of sifuvirtide. During the course of selection, wild-type virus was used without sifuvirtide as a parallel control. After 15 passages, the virus isolates were able to grow at a sifuvirtide concentration up to 5 μg/ml. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). The full-length gp41 gene was amplified from cellular DNA with primers (forward primer, 5′-TGGAGGAGGCGATATGAGGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GATAGTAGGAGGCTTGGTAG-3′) using the Platinum® TaqDNA polymerase high fidelity PCR system (Invitrogen). The PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gel and then purified by the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). PCR products were sequenced and analyzed by BioEdit software (available on the World Wide Web). Plasmid pNL4-3 containing the full-length genome of HIV-1 (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health) was digested with restriction endonucleases NheI and BamHI to release the fragment containing the full-length gp41 and cloned into the vector pVAX1/lacZ (Invitrogen). Mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) verified by direct sequencing, and the fragments containing mutations were cloned back to original NL4-3. The virus stock for wild type and mutant viruses containing various mutations were produced by transfecting 293T cells using FuGENE®6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). The supernatants containing infectious wild-type and mutant viruses were harvested after a 48-h incubation. The concentration of p24 of each virus was measured by an HIV-1 antigen kit (Vironostika, Netherlands) and stored at −80 °C until use. We used TZM-bl cells (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health) to study viral infectivity. These cells are genetically engineered to stably express high levels of CD4 and HIV-1 co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 and also to contain the luciferase and β-galactosidase genes under the control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter. Approximately 3 × 104 cells/well were plated on a 96-well plate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine and penicillin/streptomycin and then incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Serial dilution of sifuvirtide or enfuvirtide was added to the cells. One nanogram of p24 equivalent viral stock was added, and each concentration of sifuvirtide or enfuvirtide was assayed in triplicate. Forty-eight hours postinfection, 50 μl of supernatants were discarded, and 50 μl of Bright Glo reagent (Promega) was added to the each well. After a 5-min incubation at room temperature to allow cell lysis, 100 μl of cell lysate was transferred to 96-well black solid plates for measurements of luminescence using a Berthold Centro LB 960 luminometer (Berthold Technologies). Nonlinear regression curves were generated, and 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated using Prism software version 4.0 (GraphPad Software). Sifuvirtide peptide was kindly provided by Dr. Genfa Zhou (FusoGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tianjin, China). C34, N36, and mutant N peptides were synthesized by a standard solid-phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) method using a ThuraMed TETRAS synthesizer (Louisville, KY). All peptides were acetylated at the N termini and amidated at the C termini. The peptides were purified to homogeneity (>95% purity) by HPLC (Agilent 1200) and further analyzed by laser desorption mass spectrometry (Waters, Milford, MA). The concentration of peptides was determined by UV absorbance and a theoretically calculated molar extinction coefficient ϵ (280 nm) of 5500 mol/liter−1 cm−1 and 1490 mol/liter−1 cm−1 based on the number of tryptophan residues and tyrosine residues (all of the tested peptides contain Trp and/or Tyr). Native PAGE was carried out to determine the 6-HB formation between the C and N peptides as described previously (30Liu S. Zhao Q. Jiang S. Peptides. 2003; 24: 1303-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The ability of various mutant N peptides to form 6-HB with C34 was measured by an ELISA (31Jiang S. Lin K. Zhang L. Debnath A.K. J. Virol. Methods. 1999; 80: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) with modification. The secondary structure of the peptides and their mixtures was analyzed by CD spectroscopy as described previously (32Liu S. Jing W. Cheung B. Lu H. Sun J. Yan X. Niu J. Farmar J. Wu S. Jiang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9612-9620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 33Zhu Y. Lu L. Xu L. Yang H. Jiang S. Chen Y.H. J. Virol. 2010; 84: 9359-9368Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The structural modeling of interaction between mutant N peptides (including Q41K, Q41H, Q41R, N43K, I37T, and V38A) and C peptide (C34 or mutant N126K) was based on the trimeric structure recently obtained from HIV-1 HXB2 (Protein Data Bank code 2X7R) (34Buzon V. Natrajan G. Schibli D. Campelo F. Kozlov M.M. Weissenhorn W. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000880Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The updated structure contains both fusion peptide and membrane-proximal external regions of gp41 and represents the most complete example of interaction between the N peptide and C peptide (34Buzon V. Natrajan G. Schibli D. Campelo F. Kozlov M.M. Weissenhorn W. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000880Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The 6-HB for each mutant peptide was constructed through symmetry operation in alignment mode using the automated protein modeling program on the SWISSMODEL protein-modeling server (35Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). HIV-1 isolates resistant to sifuvirtide were generated and selected by serial passage of molecular clone HIV-1 NL4-3 through MT-4 cells with increasing concentrations of sifuvirtide. A total of 12 independent cultures were conducted with a starting concentration of sifuvirtide at 7.8 ng/ml, which is sufficient to inhibit about 90% of virus replication. About 1 ng of p24 equivalent of HIV-1 NL4-3 was added to the MT-4 cells 1 h before the addition of sifuvirtide. Half of the culture medium was replaced every other day, and sifuvirtide with appropriate concentration was maintained in the culture medium throughout the passage process. Cells were routinely monitored for cytopathic effect. Supernatant in which the cytopathic effect was present was collected and continued to culture with a 2-fold higher concentration of sifuvirtide. After 9–15 passages, all 12 HIV-1 isolates continued to replicate in the presence of sifuvirtide up to 5 μg/ml, although variability existed among different isolates on the detectable levels of cytopathic effect. The marked increase in sifuvirtide concentration suggests the presence of highly resistant variants in the viral culture. To study the genetic changes associated with resistance to sifuvirtide, proviral DNAs from infected cells of all 12 independent cultures at the last passages were subjected to PCR to amplify the entire gp41 region. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 1, several amino acid substitutions were identified in the NHR region, some of which have been identified previously against C34, SC34, and SC34-EK (36Izumi K. Kodama E. Shimura K. Sakagami Y. Watanabe K. Ito S. Watabe T. Terakawa Y. Nishikawa H. Sarafianos S.G. Kitaura K. Oishi S. Fujii N. Matsuoka M. J. Biol.

No substitutions were found in the pocket-binding domain despite the ubiquitous presence of sifuvirtide (Fig. 1, top). These substitutions are located at positions 37, 38, 41, and 43, either singly or in combination. Notably, all substitutions at position 37 involve the change of isoleucine to threonine (I37T, 6 of 12) (1a, 1b, 1c, 2c, 3b, and 4b), whereas the substitution at position 43 produces the change from asparagine to lysine (N43K, 5 of 12) (1b, 1c, 2c, 3a, and 4a). Substitutions at position 38 are more variable, from valine to either methionine (V38M, 2 of 12) or alanine (V38A, 1 of 12). Substitutions at position 41 are unique in that many of the mutants bear positively charged residues, such as arginine (Q41R, 2 of 12), lysine (Q41K, 2 of 12), or histidine (Q41H, 1 of 12), which have only been reported a few times among over 2229 standard HIV-1 sequences in the data base (available on the World Wide Web). Furthermore, analysis of combinational substitutions revealed that double mutations at positions 37 and 43 (I37T/N43K) are the most frequent, having been identified in three (1b, 1c, and 2c) of the 12 independent cultures (Fig. 1). The paired substitutions have so far not been reported in naturally infected or treated patients or in any in vitro culture resistant to other peptide-based fusion inhibitors against HIV-1. Triple mutations were also identified in two cultures (3b and 4a), both of which share the positively charged residues at position 41 (Fig. 1). Sporadic mutations at positions 71 and 113 involving alanine to threonine (A71T) and asparagine to aspartic acid (N113D), respectively, were identified only for clone 1c (data now shown). Last, a downstream substitution from asparagine to lysine at position 126 within the CHR region was also observed in five of the 12 cultures (1a, 1c, 2c, 3b, 3c, and 4a) (data not shown). Codon changes at the nucleotide level leading to the non-synonymous substitutions shown in Fig. 1 are listed in boldface italic type in Table 1. No preferences were found toward either transition or transversion.TABLE 1Amino acid substitutions and corresponding codon changes in 12 independent culturesCulture numberAmino acid substitution(s)Codon change1aI37T/N126KATA→ACA/AAT→AAA1bI37T/N43KATA→ACA/AAT→AAA1cI37T/N43K/A71T/N113D/N126KATA→ACA/AAT→AAA/GCT→ACT/AAT→GAT/AAT→AAG2aV38MGTG→ATG2bQ41HCAG→CAC2cI37T/N43K/N126KATA→ACA/AAT→AAA/AAT→AAG3aN43KAAT→AAA3bI37T/V38A/ Q41R/N126KATA→ACA/GTG→GCG/CAG→CGG/AAT→AAA3cQ41R/N126KCAG→CGG/AAT→AAA4aV38M/Q41K/N43K/N126KGTG→ATG/CAG→AAG/AAT→AAA/AAT→AAA4bI37TATA→ACA4cQ41KCAG→AAG Open table in a new tab To study which mutation(s) play the dominant role in conferring observed resistance to sifuvirtide, we have introduced each individual mutation, as well as double and multiple mutations, into the NHR region of gp41 and further cloned into the backbone of wild-type molecular clone pNL4-3. All 12 mutant clones identified in the culture (1a–4c), as well as some additional single mutants, were constructed to study the relative contribution of individual mutations to the overall resistance. A total of 22 mutant clones were constructed, and their sequences were confirmed by sequencing before generating the viral stock for infection analysis (Table 2). Fig. 2 shows the drug sensitivity data to sifuvirtide of nine representative mutant clones. It is evident that among all of the single mutants, there is a clear trend of increase in the level of resistance from Q41H, V38M, I37T, V38A, N43K, Q41R, and Q41K relative to the wild-type NL4-3 (Table 2 and Fig. 2). Substitutions at position 41 result in dramatic differences in resistance, with Q41K the strongest, Q41R intermediate, and Q41H the least resistant (Fig. 2 and Table 2). For the double mutants, both I37T/N43K and I37T/V38A demonstrated significant increases in resistance (Fig. 2 and Table 2, middle). However, substitution N43K clearly contributes more than V38A in the context of I37T background. Last, triple and multiple substitutions have clear added benefit to the viruses upon challenge by sifuvirtide. Most notable is the substitution N126K, which elevates the resistance level dramatically in the context of I37T/N43K, whereas the impact of sporadic substitutions, such as A71T and N113D, is rather minimal (Table 2, bottom). It should be noted that mutants with substitutions identical to culture 3b and 4a and other clones bearing substitutions in addition to that at position 41 (Q41K or Q41R) resulted in defective viruses, which failed to infect the target cells despite multiple attempts (Table 2, bottom).TABLE 2Resistance of mutant viruses to sifuvirtide and T20SifuvirtideEnfuvirtideMutant virusesIC50 (S.D.)ResistanceIC50 (S.D.)Resistancenm-foldnm-foldNL4–32.87 (0.36)1.00229.44 (30.11)1.00I37T15.31 (0.38)5.331677.75 (379.55)7.31V38A18.17 (1.28)6.333520.67 (481.12)15.34V38M9.22 (1.53)3.211549.89 (111.69)6.76Q41K114.92 (5.67)40.043889.44 (1711.46)16.95Q41H5.28 (3.32)1.84800.22 (444.04)3.49Q41R80.96 (9.71)28.214093.93 (715.51)17.84N43K27.61 (1.67)9.621462.02 (262.25)6.37A71T5.71 (1.02)1.99301.57 (24.27)1.31N113D1.95 (1.43)0.68298.2 (112.13)1.30N126K10.83 (1.47)3.77471.24 (57.3)2.05I37T/V38A126.59 (30.98)44.108301.35 (2246.29)36.18I37T/N43K277.85 (25.96)96.802182.47 (696.63)9.51I37T/N43K/A71T248.61 (2.58)86.622973.93 (417.3)12.96I37T/N43K/N126K439.18 (30.05)153.011916.4 (937.08)8.35I37T/N43K/N113D256.51 (29.3)89.374629.89 (372.13)20.18I37T/N43K/A71T/N126K419.97 (125.79)146.322014.38 (339.55)8.78I37T/N43K/A71T/N113D/N126K590.06 (114.53)205.584807.87 (189.89)20.95V38A/Q41RV38M/Q41KI37T/V38A/Q41RV38M/Q41K/N43KI37T/V38A/Q41R/N126K Open table in a new tab Taken together, our results suggest that resistance to sifuvirtide is most likely a result of multiple different substitutions, either alone or in combination, leading to different resistance mechanisms. Single substitution at position 41 (Q41K or Q41R) and double substitutions I37T/N43K or I37T/V38A in combination with N126K are probably the key mutations responsible for observed increases in resistant phenotype. A cross-resistance study was further conducted against the clinically approved peptide-based inhibitor enfuvirtide. All mutant clones, together with wild-type molecular clone NL4-3, were subjected to serial concentrations of either enfuvirtide or sifuvirtide in the cell supernatant. Their sensitivity to inhibitions by either enfuvirtide or sifuvirtide and -fold increases relative to wild-type NL4-3 are summarized in Table 2. In terms of absolute molar concentration, sifuvirtide is close to 80-fold more potent than enfuvirtide in inhibiting wild-type NL4-3, consistent with our previous observation (29He Y. Xiao Y. Song H. Liang Q. Ju D. Chen X. Lu H. Jing W. Jiang S. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11126-11134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). For cross-resistance analysis, we focused more on the -fold increases and investigated whether the same substitutions resulted in different resistance variation against sifuvirtide and enfuvirtide. For all mutants with single substitutions, there is a good correlation between -fold increases for sifuvirtide and enfuvirtide. The most evident are the Q41K and Q41R substitutions, which result in double-digit increases toward both sifuvirtide (40.04 and 28.21) and enfuvirtide (16.95 and 17.84) (Table 2, top). Q41H substitution, despite being at the same location, had only minimal impact on cross-resistance (1.84 versus 3.49) (Table 2, top). Substitutions at position 37, 38, or 43 share a similar level of cross-resistance at the single-digit level, although the V38A mutant is probably more resistant to enfuvirtide than to sifuvirtide (15.34 versus 6.33), whereas the N43K mutant seems to be more resistant to sifuvirtide (9.62 versus 6.37) (Table 2, top). Downstream substitutions, such as A71T and N113D, have negligible impact on overall resistance, whereas minor increases in cross-resistance were observed for the mutant with N126K substitution (3.77 versus 2.05) (Table 2, top). For mutants with double substitutions, I37T/V38A resulted in similar level of increase in resistance to sifuvirtide and cross-resistance to enfuvirtide (44.10 versus 36.18) (Table 2, middle), which is quite comparable with resistance conferred by single substitutions Q41K and Q41R (see above). Substitution I37T/N43K, however, preferentially shows more resistance to sifuvirtide than cross-resistance to enfuvirtide, and the difference reached over more than 10-fold (96.80 versus 9.51) (Table 2, middle). For mutants with triple substitutions, it is clear that the additional downstream substitution of N126K in the context of I37T/N43K has led to three-digit increases in resistance against sifuvirtide but only minimal cross-resistance to enfuvirtide (153.01 versus 8.35) (Table 2, bottom). Although additional single A71T or N113D substitution had no added resistance to sifuvirtide, there was a trend toward more cross-resistance to enfuvirtide (Table 2, bottom). Finally, increases in resistance for mutants with four or more substitutions are quite comparable with those of triple mutants, although both a slightly higher resistance and cross-resistance were noticed for the mutant with I37T/N43K/A71T/N113D/N126K substitutions in combination (Table 2, bottom). To measure the infectivity of mutant clones, we have performed an infection assay in the absence of sifuvirtide or other inhibitors using the TZM-bl reporter cell line. One nanogram of p24 equivalent of each mutant virus, together with wild-type NL4-3, was used to infect the target cells, and luciferase activity was measured 2 days after infection. Infectivity of NL4-3 was normalized to 100%, and the relative infectivity of other mutants was calculated accordingly. For mutants with single substitutions, I37T resulted in an ∼50% increase in infectivity, whereas Q41H remained similar to that of the wild-type NL4-3 (Fig. 3). In contrast, other mutant viruses revealed variable and diminished infectivity. Some substitutions, such as Q41K, Q41R, and V38M, severely"
https://openalex.org/W2044511581,"Human serum albumin (HSA) is the dominating protein in human plasma. Many bacterial species, especially streptococci, express surface proteins that bind HSA with high specificity and affinity, but the biological consequences of these protein-protein interactions are poorly understood. Group G streptococci (GGS), carrying the HSA-binding protein G, colonize the skin and the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, mostly without causing disease. In the case of bacterial invasion, pro-inflammatory cytokines are released that activate the epithelium to produce antibacterial peptides, in particular the chemokine MIG/CXCL9. In addition, the inflammation causes capillary leakage and extravasation of HSA and other plasma proteins, environmental changes at the epithelial surface to which the bacteria need to respond. In this study, we found that GGS adsorbed HSA from both saliva and plasma via binding to protein G and that HSA bound to protein G bound and inactivated the antibacterial MIG/CXCL9 peptide. Another surface protein of GGS, FOG, was found to mediate adherence of the bacteria to pharyngeal epithelial cells through interaction with glycosaminoglycans. This adherence was not affected by activation of the epithelium with a combination of IFN-γ and TNF-α, leading to the production of MIG/CXCL9. However, at the activated epithelial surface, adherent GGS were protected against killing by MIG/CXCL9 through protein G-dependent HSA coating. The findings identify a previously unknown bacterial survival strategy that helps to explain the evolution of HSA-binding proteins among bacterial species of the normal human microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W1971299133,"Homomeric P2X3 receptors are present in sensory ganglia and participate in pain perception. Amino acid (AA) residues were replaced in the four supposed nucleotide binding segments (NBSs) of the human (h) P2X3 receptor by alanine, and these mutants were expressed in HEK293 cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes. Patch clamp and two-electrode voltage clamp measurements as well as the Ca(2+) imaging technique were used to compare the concentration-response curves of the selective P2X1,3 agonist α,β-methylene ATP obtained at the wild-type P2X3 receptor and its NBS mutants. Within these NBSs, certain Gly (Gly-66), Lys (Lys-63, Lys-176, Lys-284, Lys-299), Asn (Asn-177, Asn-279), Arg (Arg-281, Arg-295), and Thr (Thr-172) residues were of great importance for a full agonist response. However, the replacement of further AAs in the NBSs by Ala also appeared to modify the amplitude of the current and/or [Ca(2+)](i) responses, although sometimes to a minor degree. The agonist potency decrease was additive after the simultaneous replacement of two adjacent AAs by Ala (K65A/G66A, F171A/T172A, N279A/F280A, F280A/R281A) but was not altered after Ala substitution of two non-adjacent AAs within the same NBS (F171A/N177A). SDS-PAGE in the Cy5 cell surface-labeled form demonstrated that the mutants appeared at the cell surface in oocytes. Thus, groups of AAs organized in NBSs rather than individual amino acids appear to be responsible for agonist binding at the hP2X3 receptor. These NBSs are located at the interface of the three subunits forming a functional receptor."

Loss of MYCBP2 constitutively activated p38 MAPK and increased expression of several proteins involved in receptor trafficking. Surprisingly, loss of MYCBP2 inhibited internalization of transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1) and prevented desensitization of capsaicin-induced calcium increases.

Whereas growth regulation of cortical axons by MYCBP2 does not involve p38 MAPK (8Bloom A.J. M. B. Sanes J.R. Diantonio A. Genes & Development. 2007; 21: 2593-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), MYCBP2-dependent axonal overgrowth of spinal cord motor neurons and sensory dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons was regulated by p38 MAPK-mediated alterations in microtubule stability (11Lewcock J.W.

Besides its role in the regulation of neuronal growth, also a function of MYCBP2 in neuronal transmission has been demonstrated. In C. elegans and drosophila loss-of-function mutations in the MYCBP2 orthologs decreased the number of synaptic vesicles at cholinergic and GABAergic synapses in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner (9Nakata K.

More recently, it was shown that the MYCBP2 ortholog in C. elegans, RPM-1, prevents in central neurons activity-dependent internalization of AMPA receptors by inhibiting p38 MAPK signaling through ubiquitylation of MAPK kinase kinase 12 (MAPKKK12), (14Park E.C. Glodowski D.R. Rongo C. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Loss of RPM-1 caused constitutive activation of p38MAPK leading to an increased internalization of the AMPA receptor ortholog GLR1. Interestingly, in mammals down-regulation of MYCBP2 had an opposite effect on neuronal transmission. Here, down-regulation of MYCBP2 in the spinal cord of adult rats increased pain-like (nociceptive) behavior in a model for acute and inflammatory pain, suggesting an enhanced neuronal signaling (3Ehnert C.

In this study, we investigated the consequences of the loss of mammalian MYCBP2 on neuronal functions in peripheral sensory neurons. We found that MYCBP2-deficiency causes constitutive p38 MAPK activation which, surprisingly, prevented activity-induced internalization of the transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1). This finding contrasts the role of MYCBP2 and p38 MAPK in AMPA receptor internalization in C. elegans (14Park E.C. Glodowski D.R. Rongo C.

Thus, our findings suggest that p38 MAPK fulfills receptor-dependent versatile roles in the regulation of receptor internalization. Mouse anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4 (IB4) were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against phospho-(Thr-180/Tyr-182) p38 MAPK, total p38, α-p38, γ-p38, myosin Va, and myosin VI were from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). The TRPV1 antibody showing the partial colocalization was from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany), the antibody showing the TrpV1-internalization was from Osenses (Flagstaff Hill, Australia). The antibody against HSP90 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. SB203580 was from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). A targeting vector was constructed from a 8.7-kb PCR product from a 129/SV BAC clone and subsequently used to generate the MYCBP2-targeted allele mice (genOway, Lyon, France). In the verified fragment was a LoxP site cloned in the EcoRI site between exon 11 and 12. Then a LoxP-FRT-neo-FRT site was inserted with AvrII between exons 10 and 11. Thus, exon 11 was flanked by loxP sites (Fig. 1A). Exon 11 encodes 13 amino acid N-terminal of the RCC1-like domain, a highly conserved domain necessary for MYCBP2 function (6D'Souza J. Hendricks M.

Pierre S. Potstada W. Scholich K. Cell Signal. 2009; 21: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which carries the ubiquitin ligase activity, were deleted. Genomic DNA was extracted from spinal cords and DRGs using the peqGold Tissue DNA Mini Kit (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany). 1 μg of total DNA were used to amplify exon 11 of MYCBP2 with the primers 5′-GCAAGGGATATCTGCAGTTGGACACC and 3′-GGAACCTCGAGTAGCCATATTGGCTAGC. RNA was extracted from DRGs using RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Monheim, Germany). Total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription (RT) using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) and a specific primer (5′-CCTTTCCCTCCTTGGTTCAT-3′). cDNA was amplified using the primers 5′-GAGACACTGGAACAGGA and 3′-CGTTCGTTTCCTCTTCTACC. The Panorama antibody microarray for cell signaling contained 726 different antibodies spotted in duplicate on nitrocellulose-coated glass from Sigma-Aldrich. Data generation was done by Microbiochips (Paris, France). Briefly, 1 mg of DRG lysates from Cre-negative or Cre-positive MYCBP2lox/lox mice were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively, and then hybridized to the slides according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each block of the grid contained 2 spots of Anti CY3/5 used as positive controls and for grid positioning. In several blocks, there are also 2 spots of BSA used to check for nonspecific signal. The corresponding signals were about the background level. The positive controls showed nearly saturated signal. The intensity of each spot was calculated from the median value of the pixels contained in the spot. Local background was systematically subtracted to the signal to obtain a net signal. Each antibody was spotted in duplicate on each array. To clearly identify these values, background proximity cut-off was calculated as follows: Mean (of pixels) Local Background ± 3 SD. In all experiments the ethics guidelines for investigations in conscious animals were obeyed and the procedures were approved by the local Ethics Committee. The investigator was unaware of the treatments or the genotypes during all behavioral experiments. Rotarod test: Motor coordination was assessed with a Rotarod Treadmill for mice (Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy) at a constant rotating speed of 32 rpm. All mice had five training sessions before the day of the experiment. The fall-off latency was averaged from five tests. The cut-off time was 90 s. Hanging wire test: For the hanging wire test animals were placed in the middle of a cage wire-lid for 5 s. Then the wire-lid was inverted, hold at about 30 cm height and the fall-off latencies were recorded (24Sango K. McDonald M.P. Crawley J.N. Mack M.L. Tifft C.J. Skop E. Starr C.M. Hoffmann A. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Proia R.L. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The cut-off time was set at 90 s. Thermal thresholds were determined using the tail-flick test (25Le Bars D. Gozariu M. Cadden S.W. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 597-652PubMed Google Scholar), the hot-plate test (26Tegeder I. Del Turco D. Schmidtko A. Sausbier M. Feil R. Hofmann F. Deller T. Ruth P. Geisslinger G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3253-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and the radiant heat (Hargreaves) test (27Hargreaves K. Dubner R. Brown F. Flores C. Joris J. Pain. 1988; 32: 77-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4319) Google Scholar) as described previously. For cold plate testing the mice were placed on a cold steel plate (5 + 0.5 °C) and the pain related behavior (licking flinching, rearing, jumping) was assessed during a 2 min interval. Mechanical thresholds of the plantar side of a hind paw were determined using a plantar aesthesiometer (Dynamic Plantar Aesthesiometer, Ugo Basile) or von Frey hairs. Here, a steel rod (2 mm diameter) was pushed against the paw with ascending force (0–5 g over a 10-s period, time resolution 0.1 s) until a strong and immediate withdrawal occurred. The paw withdrawal latency was taken to be the mean of at least four consecutive trials with at least 20 s in-between. Von Frey hair testing was performed as described previously (28Decosterd I. Woolf C.J. Pain. 2000; 87: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). Formalin test: 20 μl of a 5% formaldehyde solution (formalin) was injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into the dorsal surface of one hindpaw. The time spent licking the formalin-injected paw and the number of flinches was recorded in 5 min intervals up to 45 min after formalin injection. Thermal hyperalgesia was determined following baseline measurements 4, 6, and 8 h after formalin injection. For intrathecal (i.th.) delivery of drugs, a spinal catheter was constructed by inserting a slim polytetrafluoroethylene tube (OD 0.2 mm, ID 0.1 mm, length 2 cm, SUBL-60, Braintree Scientific, Braintree, USA) for 1 cm into a wider polyethylene tube (OD 0.61 mm, ID 0.28 mm, length 9 cm, neoLab, Heidelberg, Germany) and fixation of both tubes with cyanacrylate glue (Stabiloplast, Renfert, Hilzingen, Germany). A 2 cm longitudinal skin incision was made in anesthetized mice above the pelvic girdle and the muscles were bluntly dissected from the vertebrae to expose the L4 and L5 spinous processes. The L5 spinous process and the intervertebral ligament were cut carefully, and a small hole was made on the dura with a 27-gauge needle. Then the slim part of the catheter was inserted 1 cm, so that the tip reached about L1. The sign of a sudden tail or hind limb movement verified the proper localization of the catheter. Using cyanacrylate glue, the hole on the dura was covered and the catheter was fixed on the bone. After muscle suture, the catheter was tunneled under the skin through a trocar and pulled out from the dorsal neck area. Finally, the skin incision was sutured and the end of the catheter was sealed by melting. After surgery, mice were caged individually for 3 days to recover. Only mice without disturbances of neurological functions were used for behavioral experiments. 12-μm tissue slices and neurons from adult DRG cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeablized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min and blocked for 1 h in 3% BSA in PBS. Primary and secondary antibody incubations were done in PBS containing 1% BSA for 1 h each. The samples were washed three times with PBS prior mounting. Costaining with TrpV1 and both myosins, all produced in rabbit, were possible using the TSA Fluorescence System from Perkin Elmer (Waltham, MA). For analysis a Zeiss ApoTom fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany) was used. Colocalization was evaluated using the Intensity Correlation Analysis of the software Image J 1.43m. The Pearson correlation (Rr), the Mander's colocalization coefficient (R) and split coefficients of the Mander′s overlap the (M1, M2) were calculated. The ratio of the positive pixels in both channels was between 0.87 andf 1.02. TRPV1 internalization was assessed as described previously (16Pierre S.C. Häusler J. Birod K. Geisslinger G. Scholich K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3031-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, images for each experimental condition were taken and internalization occurrence was assessed by generating linear densitometric profiles of the cells using the ImageJ 1.60 software. Cells were judged to show internalization if the difference of TRPV1 signals of cytoplasm and plasma membrane decreased to less than double of the signal strength in the cytoplasm of unstimulated SNS-Cre-MYCBP2lox/lox cells. 20–30 dorsal root ganglions (DRG) were prepared from adult mice and pooled in ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). Then the DRGs were transferred to Neurobasal-Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 500 units/ml collagenase (Biochrome AG, Berlin, Germany) and 2.5 units/ml dispase II (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The dissociated tissues were washed twice with medium containing 10% FCS and once with HBSS. Afterward the cells were incubated in 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) for 10 min at 37 °C and washed again three times in medium before plating poly-l-lysine-covered coverslips in Neurobasal-Medium containing B27, glutamine, and 10% FCS. After 2 h, the medium was changed to Neurobasal Medium without FCS. The neurons were used for calcium imaging the next day. Calcium-imaging experiments were performed with primary dorsal root ganglion cells after 1 day in culture. Prior determination of intracellular calcium levels ([Ca2+]i), cells were incubated with 5 μm of Fura-2-AM (Biotrend, Cologne, Germany) in Neurobasal medium containing 0.02% Pluronic F-127 (Biotium) for 30 min. Fura-2 loaded cells were transferred to the perfusion-chamber continuously superfused with Hepes-buffered ringer-modified saline containing 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm d-glucose, 1.25 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, at room temperature (20–22 °C). Images were taken with an Axioscope 2 upright microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using a 10× Achroplan water immersion objective (Zeiss). The microscope was equipped with an Imago CCD camera, a polychrome IV monochromator (all TILL Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany). Images were acquired and processed using Tillvision software. [Ca2+]i was expressed as the ratio of the background-subtracted fluorescence emission at 510 nm (filter type LP 440) due to excitation at 340 nm and 380 nm using the Polychrom IV Monochromator (Till Photonics). For desensitization experiments cells were 4 times stimulated with 0.2 μm or twice with 0.5 or 1 μm Capsaicin/Ringer delivered via bath application for 10 s with a washing step of 12 or 15 min in between. Desensitization experiments using mustard oil included two stimulations for 30 s with 100 μm mustard oil with a washing step of 8 min. In all experiments included control stimulations with 50 mm KCl for 10 s were performed except when 4 capsaicin-stimulations were used. For the dose-response experiment the time of washing between the indicated stimulations were 15min. The baseline (first 3 min of each measurement) was used to calculate the increase in ratio (Δratio) for each cell. To investigate the consequences of a MYCBP2 deficiency in neurons of adult mice, we generated conditional MYCBP2-knock-out mice utilizing the Cre-Lox system to delete exon 11 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The generation of these mice was necessary, since constitutive MYCBP2 knock-out mice die at birth because of incorrect formation of neuromuscular junctions at the lung diaphragm (7Burgess R.W. Peterson K.A. Johnson M.J. Roix J.J. Welsh I.C. O'Brien T.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 1096-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Bloom A.J. M. B. Sanes J.R. Diantonio A. Genes & Development. 2007; 21: 2593-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Conditional MYCBP2 knock-out mice were generated by mating MYCBP2-floxed mice to mice expressing Cre-recombinase under control of the Nestin promoter (23Tronche F. Kellendonk C. Kretz O. Gass P. Anlag K. Orban P.C. Bock R. Klein R. Schütz G. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar) or to mice expressing Cre-recombinase under control of the promoter of the sodium channel Nav1.8 (SNS) (22Agarwal N. Offermanns S. Kuner R. Genesis. 2004; 38: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B; supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). In Nestin-Cre mice Cre-recombinase expression is found in all neurons, while in SNS-Cre mice Cre-recombinase expression is restricted to nociceptive and thermoreceptive neurons of the dorsal root ganglia, trigeminal ganglia as well as a small proportion of proprioceptive neurons (22Agarwal N. Offermanns S. Kuner R. Genesis. 2004; 38: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 23Tronche F. Kellendonk C. Kretz O. Gass P. Anlag K. Orban P.C. Bock R. Klein R. Schütz G. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). However, because Cre-positive Nestin-MYCBP2lox/lox mice showed a lethal phenotype, only the adult SNS-MYCBP2lox/lox mice were used in the following studies. Because MYCBP2 negatively controls neuronal growth, we stained terminals of the primary afferents in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord using the lectin Griffonia simplicifolia IB4 to investigate morphological consequences of the MYCBP2-deficiency. IB4 recognizes small-diameter, non-myelinated DRG neurons, which includes the sensory and thermosensitive neurons, whose central axons terminate in inner lamina II of the spinal cord (29Silverman J.D. Kruger L. J. Neurocytol. 1990; 19: 789-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In accordance with the known function of MYCBP2 in restricting neuronal growth, the medial region of lamina II was enlarged in spinal cords of SNS-MYCBP2-knock-out mice (Fig. 1, C and D). However, the neuronal overgrowth had no behavioral consequences in two tests addressing the motor abilities of mice, the rotarod and the hanging wire test (Fig. 1E and supplemental Fig. S3A). Also, no differences between SNS-MYCBP2 knock-out mice and Cre-negative littermate control mice were seen in basal thermal pain thresholds as determined by the radiant heat, hot plate, and the cold plate test (Fig. 1F and supplemental Fig. S3B) or in basal mechanical thresholds as determined with a plantar aesthesiometer or von Frey hairs (Fig. 1G and supplemental Fig. S3D). Taken together, the data show that neither the overgrowth of the central terminals nor the loss of MYCBP2 causes fundamental changes in basal functions of the sensory neurons. To investigate physiological consequences of MYCBP2 deficiency in peripheral nociceptive neurons, we tested pain thresholds of SNS-MYCBP2-deficient mice in an inflammatory model. In the early phase of the formalin test, the nociceptive behavior did not differ between both animal groups (Fig. 2A). However, duration of the formalin-induced thermal hyperalgesia was prolonged in the MYCBP2-deficient animals (Fig. 2B). 6 and 8 h after formalin injection paw withdrawal latencies of SNS-MYCBP2 knock-out mice were significantly lower as compared with Cre-negative control mice (Fig. 2B). Next, we studied the effect of the MYCBP2-deficiency on protein expression in DRGs, to determine the mechanistic basis for the increased duration of hyperalgesia in MYCBP2-deficient cells. Protein expression was determined by hybridizing DRG protein extracts from Cre-positive SNS-MYCBP2 knock-out mice and Cre-negative littermate control mice to an antibody microarray covering 750 proteins. 28 proteins showed a change of expression with a net log of 0.5 or more. Out of these, 11 proteins were involved in cytoskeletal-dependent processes including receptor trafficking, vesicle transport or growth regulation (Table 1). Another 10 proteins were involved in the regulation of gene expression, and 7 proteins were related to general signaling events or ubiquitylation. Because MYCBP2 has recently been described to regulate receptor trafficking and the antibody array suggests changes in the trafficking machinery, we studied whether this property of MYCBP2 underlies the prolonged hyperalgesia. The antibody array suggests increased protein levels of myosin Va and myosin VI in MYCBP2-deficient DRGs, which are both known to be involved in receptor internalization and recycling (30Bridgman P.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1045-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 31Röder I.V. Petersen Y. Choi K.R. Witzemann V. Hammer 3rd, J.A. Rudolf R.

A significant up-regulation of both myosin isoforms in DRGs of SNS-MYCBP2-knock-out mice was detected in the array by two different antibodies against each protein and was confirmed by Western blot analyses (Fig. 3, A and B). To study whether or not an altered regulation of activity-dependent receptor internalization is involved in the increased duration of thermal hyperalgesia, we first studied the effect of MYCBP2 deficiency on the well characterized ion channel TRPV1, which is a receptor for noxious heat. TRPV1 is selectively activated by capsaicin, undergoes activity-induced desensitization and partially colocalized with both myosin isoforms in neuronal DRG cultures from adult Cre-negative SNS-MYCBP2 knock-out mice (Fig. 3, C and D). Notably, the colocalization frequency of TRPV1 and both myosins increased significantly after capsaicin-induced TRPV1 internalization indicating the participation of both myosins in internalization/r"
https://openalex.org/W2042247749,"Plasmodium IMC1 (inner membrane complex 1) proteins comprise components of the subpellicular network, a lattice of intermediate filaments that form a structural part of the pellicle in the zoite stages of malaria parasites. Family members IMC1a and IMC1b are differentially expressed in sporozoites and ookinetes, respectively, but have functionally equivalent roles affecting cell morphology, strength, motility, and infectivity. Because of the coincident effects of previous imc1 gene disruptions on both zoite shape and locomotion, it has been impossible to ascribe a direct involvement in motility to these proteins. We show here that a third family member, IMC1h, has a distinct differential expression pattern and localizes to the pellicle of both ookinetes and sporozoites. Knock-out of IMC1h mimics the loss-of-function phenotypes of IMC1a and IMC1b in their respective life stages, indicating that IMC1 proteins could be operating co-dependently. By generating double null mutant parasites for IMC1h and IMC1b, we tested this hypothesis: double knock-out exacerbated the phenotypes of the single knock-outs in terms of ookinete strength, motility, and infectivity but did not further affect ookinete morphology. These findings provide the first genetic evidence that IMC1 proteins can function independently of each other and contribute to gliding motility independently of cell shape."
https://openalex.org/W2023580584,"SNF1-related protein kinases 2 (SnRK2s) are plant-specific enzymes involved in environmental stress signaling and abscisic acid-regulated plant development. Here, we report that SnRK2s interact with and are regulated by a plant-specific calcium-binding protein. We screened a Nicotiana plumbaginifolia Matchmaker cDNA library for proteins interacting with Nicotiana tabacum osmotic stress-activated protein kinase (NtOSAK), a member of the SnRK2 family. A putative EF-hand calcium-binding protein was identified as a molecular partner of NtOSAK. To determine whether the identified protein interacts only with NtOSAK or with other SnRK2s as well, we studied the interaction of an Arabidopsis thaliana orthologue of the calcium-binding protein with selected Arabidopsis SnRK2s using a two-hybrid system. All kinases studied interacted with the protein. The interactions were confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay, indicating that the binding occurs in planta, exclusively in the cytoplasm. Calcium binding properties of the protein were analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy using Tb(3+) as a spectroscopic probe. The calcium binding constant, determined by the protein fluorescence titration, was 2.5 ± 0.9 × 10(5) M(-1). The CD spectrum indicated that the secondary structure of the protein changes significantly in the presence of calcium, suggesting its possible function as a calcium sensor in plant cells. In vitro studies revealed that the activity of SnRK2 kinases analyzed is inhibited in a calcium-dependent manner by the identified calcium sensor, which we named SCS (SnRK2-interacting calcium sensor). Our results suggest that SCS is involved in response to abscisic acid during seed germination most probably by negative regulation of SnRK2s activity."
https://openalex.org/W1992415594,"Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters are crucial for efficient synaptic transmission. The transporter GAT-1 mediates electrogenic cotransport of GABA, sodium, and chloride. The presence of chloride enables the transporter to couple the transport of the neurotransmitter to multiple sodium ions, thereby enabling its accumulation against steep concentration gradients. Here we study the functional impact of mutations of the putative chloride-binding residues on transport by GAT-1, with the emphasis on a conserved glutamine residue. In contrast to another putative chloride coordinating residue, Ser-331, where mutation to glutamate led to chloride-independent GABA transport, the Q291E mutant was devoid of any transport activity, despite substantial expression at the plasma membrane. Low but significant transport activity was observed with substitution mutants with small side chains such as Q291S/A/G. Remarkably, when these mutations were combined with the S331E mutation, transport was increased significantly, even though the activity of the S331E single mutant was only ∼25% of that of wild type GAT-1. Transport by these double mutants was largely chloride-independent. Like mutants of other putative chloride coordinating residues, the apparent affinity of the active Gln-291 single mutants for chloride was markedly reduced along with a change their anion selectivity. In addition to the interaction of the transporter with chloride, Gln-291 is also required at an additional step during transport.

We found in hyperosmotic stress-induced HCE cells that Plk3 transferred to the nuclear compartment and was colocalized with ATF-2 in nuclei.

IntroductionHyperosmotic stresses are considered as environmental hazards and pathological conditions from increased extracellular hyperosmolarity occurring in diabetes mellitus, uremia, heat shock, fatal burns, infections, and dehydration after exercise. Hyperosmotic stress extracts water out of cells, resulting in cell shrinkage. To restore the volume, the cells undergo a regulatory volume increase occurred within several minutes by uptake inorganic ions and water (1Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M. Völkl H. Waldegger S.

These stresses are ionizing radiation, reactive oxygen species, methyl-methane-sulfonate, UV irradiation, and hypoxia (15Ouyang B. Pan H. Lu L. Li J. Stambrook P. Li B. Dai W. J. Biol.

In previous studies, we found that stress stimulation activates Plk3 to phosphorylate c-Jun protein at Ser-63 and Ser-73, subsequently resulting in activation of apoptotic responses in various cells (16Wang L. Dai W. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32121-32127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, it is still not clear how Plk3 functionally regulates these transcription factors in response to various stress stimulation and how Plk3 interacts with other transcription factors to form heterodimeric AP-1 complexes in addition to the c-Jun protein.The AP-1 transcription factor complex acts as a central switch to convert extracellular signals into genetic responses and to determine cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The AP-1 complex consists of homodimers and heterodimers formed by a group of transcription factors, such as those members in the Jun, Fos, and ATF families (18Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar, 19Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). The AP-1 complex formed by ATF-2 and c-Jun transcription factors is one of the main components in response to hyperosmotic stress stimulation. Recent studies indicate that the AP-1 complex is formed by heterodimer of ATF-2 and c-Jun instead of ATF-2/ATF-2 or c-Jun/c-Jun homodimers in human cells (20Liu H. Deng X. Shyu Y.J. Li J.J.

Biol. 2010; 396: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It has also shown that there are unique structures within these transcription factor proteins, including DNA recognition segments and the basic leucine zipper domain that are responsible for protein-DNA interactions and for forming functional dimers of the AP-1 complex, respectively (21Carrillo R.J.

Composition, regulation, and function of AP-1 complex are different depending on the cellular context and activation of various MAPKs. In corneal epithelial cells, activation of JNK and p38 result in increase in cell mobility and apoptosis (27Lee J.H. Kim M. Im Y.S. Choi W. Byeon S.H. Lee H.K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

In previous studies, we reported that Plk3 is involved in UV irradiation- and hypoxia-induced cell death by activation of c-Jun in cornea epithelial cells (16Wang L. Dai W. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32121-32127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Wang L. Gao J. Dai W. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25928-25935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated whether hyperosmotic stress induces Plk3 activation, which subsequently alters corneal epithelial cell function through activation of ATF-2 in formation of AP-1 complex. Our results revealed that Plk3 is a newly recognized component in signaling pathways to transmit extracellular hyperosmotic stress signals and to regulate ATF-2 in AP-1 complex in addition to the existing kinase cascade pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCulture of Corneal Epithelial CellsPrimary HCE cells and human telomerase-immortalized corneal epithelial cells were cultured in a serum-free keratinocyte medium (defined keratinocyte-SFM; Invitrogen), and a human corneal epithelial (HCE) cell line was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 μg/ml insulin in an incubator supplied with 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The medium was replaced every 2 days, and the cells were subcultured by treatment of cells with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA. For experiments of hyperosmotic stress stimulation, various concentrations of sorbitol, sucrose, NaCl, and glucose were added to the culture media following a time course. Osmotic pressures of hyperosmotic media were measured by using a vapor pressure osmometer (VAPRO5520).Gene Transfection and Recombinant ProteinsVarious constructs encoding full-length Plk3 (pEGFP-Plk3-FL, amino acids 1–646) and its mutants, including constitutively active Plk3 kinase domain (pEGFP-Plk3-KD, containing amino acids 1–334), inactive Plk3 kinase domain mutant (pEGFP-Plk3T219E, containing the Plk3 kinase domain mutated by substitute of the threonine 219 with a glutamate), and kinase-defective Plk3K52R (a full-length mutant of Plk3 that contains a substitution of the lysine 52 with an arginine), were transfected in corneal epithelial cells for 16–20 h using Lipofectamine reagents (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis and immunocomplex kinase assays. Transfections of JNK1-specfic siRNA (Qiagen; SI02758637), p38-specific siRNA (Qiagen; SI00605157), and Plk3-specific siRNA (Qiagen; SI02223473 and SI02223466) were done by adding respective JNK1-, p38-, and Plk3-specific siRNAs with a final concentration of 25 nm mixed with 12 μl of HiPerFect in 100 μl of serum-free culture medium. Transfection mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The mixture was evenly dropped into cultured cells. Transfected cells were cultured under normal growth conditions for 48–84 h before performing experiments. Control cells were transfected with nonsilencing siRNA using the same method as described above. Recombinant fusion proteins including active Plk3 (Plk3a), Plk3 mutant (Plk3 K52R), ATF-2, and ATF-2 mutant (ATF-2T69A/T71A, a generous gift from Dr. Ze'ev Ronai at the Burnham Institute for Medical Research) were expressed using the baculoviral expression system and purified from Sf9 insect cells according to Invitrogen protocol. Briefly, Sf9 cells (ATCC) infected with Plk3 or ATF-2 baculovirus were cultured in Grace's insect cell culture medium. Infected cells were harvested on day 3 and lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μm pepstatin A, 10 units/ml aprotinin). The cell lysates were incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resins for 3 h at 4 °C. Fusion proteins were eluted from nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resins by using the lysis buffer containing 200 mm imidazole after extensive wash of the resins with the lysis buffer. Fusion proteins were purified by dialyzing in a storage buffer (25 mm Tris, pH7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 50% glycerol) and stored at 80 °C for subsequent uses. A cAMP response element (CRE) promoter report system was used to determine ATF-2/AP-1 transcription activity following the company's protocol (Promega, WI). Luc2 (Photinus pyralis, the reporter activity) and hRluc (Renilla reniformis, the internal control) activities were determined by a Lumat LB 9507 tube luminometer (Berthold, Germany).Immunocytochemistry ExperimentsImmunostainingCorneal epithelial cells were grown on glass slides. After different treatments, HCE cells were rinsed twice with PBS, fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, and then permeabilized with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS-T) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were blocked by incubation with 10% normal horse serum or 10% normal goat serum in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature, followed by double immunostaining with the corresponding antibodies. The cells were washed with PBS and stained with DAPI. Pictures were captured by a Nikon fluorescent Ti microscope. The image data were analyzed using a Nikon NIS element software program.Immunoprecipitation and Immunocomplex Kinase AssayCorneal epithelial cells (5 × 107) were rinsed with PBS and incubated in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 250 μm 4-nitrophenyl-phosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) on ice for 30 min. The cell lysates were spun at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and incubated at 4 °C overnight with antibodies against Plk3, JNK, and p38, respectively (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunocomplexes were recovered by incubation with 50 μl of 10% protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunocomplex beads were rinsed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer and then subjected to immunoblotting and kinase assay. To measure activities of Plk3, JNK, and p38, immunocomplex kinase assays were carried out by incubation of immunoprecipitated Plk3, JNK, or p38 with ATF-2 fusion protein in 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm MnCl2, 25 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) for 30 min at 37 °C. Kinase reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer and boiling for 5 min. Equal volumes of the samples were displayed on 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by exposure on x-ray films. For cold kinase assay, [γ-32P]ATP was omitted from the kinase buffer. Western blot assay was performed by harvesting 5 × 105 cells in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing: 137 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 Tris, pH 7.5. Cell lysates were rinsed by ice-cold PBS and precleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min. The samples were denatured by adding an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer and boiling for 5 min. The samples were loaded into a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and fractionated by electrophoresis. Proteins in the gel were electrotransferred to PVDF membrane. The membrane was exposed to the blocking buffer (5% nonfat milk in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with respective antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with TBS-T buffer, the membrane was incubated with HRP-linked secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Expression of proteins was detected with a Western blot detection kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).DISCUSSIONHyperosmotic stress is one of the environmental stresses that can delay the corneal epithelial wound healing process, resulting in compromising physiological function of the cornea. In various cell types, hyperosmotic stress activates stress-induced MAPK cascades including JNK and p38 signaling pathways (5Burg M.B. Ferraris J.D. Dmitrieva N.I. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 1441-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 8Corrales R.M. Luo L. Chang E.Y. Pflugfelder S.C. Cornea. 2008; 27: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 31Huang Z.

Johnson G.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Cells respond to hyperosmotic stress through activation of signaling pathways, resulting in further activation of downstream transcription factors, such as ATF-2. We found that hyperosmotic stresses that were generated by increased concentrations of different extracellular solutes including sorbitol, sucrose, glucose, and NaCl indeed activated ATF-2 in human corneal epithelial cells. However, suppression of JNK and p38 by knocking down JNK and p38 mRNA or by applications of inhibitors could not completely prevent hyperosmotic stress-induced ATF-2 phosphorylation as would be expected, which suggests that there are other players in the hyperosmotic stress-induced pathways to activate ATF-2 in human corneal epithelial cells (Fig. 1). To answer this possibility, we explored hyperosmotic stress-induced alternative pathways and revealed a novel pathway involving Plk3. By using a three-step immunoprecipitation/immunodepletion procedure, we were able to remove activities of both JNK and p38 from hyperosmotic stress-induced cells. We found in human corneal epithelial cells that Plk3 activated by high concentrations of sorbitol, sucrose, glucose, and NaCl is able to phosphorylate ATF-2 that is an important transcription factor to form heterodimers of AP-1 complex. In fact, Plk3 phosphorylates ATF-2 in the absence of JNK/p38 activities at the specific site of Thr-71 in hyperosmotic stress-induced human corneal epithelial cells.To further characterize the hyperosmotic stress-induced ATF-2 phosphorylation through activation of Plk3 pathway, cDNAs encoding full-length Plk3 and Plk3 mutants were introduced in hyperosmotic stress-induced cells. The results of transfection experiments showed that full-length Plk3 and constitutive active Plk3 kinase domain mutant enhanced ATF-2 phosphorylation in hyperosmotic stress-induced cells, whereas kinase domain silencing Plk3 mutant had no effect on hyperosmotic stress-induced ATF-2 phosphorylation, although the exogenously expressed protein of kinase-domain silencing Plk3 mutant was markedly increased in the transfected cells. In addition, suppression of Plk3 mRNA expression with specific siRNA clearly inhibited hyperosmotic stress-induced ATF-2 phosphorylation. These results provide further evidence that hyperosmotic stress-induced ATF-2 phosphorylation was indeed mediated by the Plk3 pathway. Furthermore, protein interaction between Plk3 and ATF-2 is verified by two-step experiments. First, using respective antibodies in coimmunoprecipitation experiments can bi-directionally pull down both Plk3 and ATF-2 proteins. Second, both Plk3 and ATF-2 proteins can be colocalized in the nuclei of hyperosmotic stress-induced human corneal epithelial cells. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that hyperosmotic stress-activated Plk3 is an important event upstream of ATF-2 to phosphorylate ATF-2 in the formation of AP-1 complex that determines cell differentiation and apoptosis in human corneal epithelial cells (17Wang L. Gao J. Dai W. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25928-25935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).The effect of hyperosmotic stress on the activation of Plk3 subsequently resulting in ATF-2 phosphorylation is consistent with previous findings indicating that Plk3 is an important mediator of the cellular response to genotoxic stress. Furthermore, the effect of hyperosmotic stress-activated Plk3 on ATF-2 function was examined by using the AP-1-specific CRE reporter. Activated Plk3 phosphorylated ATF-2 and increased CRE promoter activity. Transfection of a mutant of ATF-2 (ATF-2T69A/T71A) effectively suppressed the effect of hyperosmotic stress-activated Plk3 on CRE promoter activity (Fig. 3). The study results provide new evidence to reveal that Plk3 plays a novel role to mediate the effect of hyperosmotic stress on AP-1 activation in addition to the previous findings that Plk3 is involved in UV irradiation and hypoxic stress-induced signaling pathway to activate c-Jun, the other member in formation of the AP-1 complex (16Wang L. Dai W. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32121-32127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Wang L. Gao J. Dai W. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25928-25935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, the findings of the present study have physiological significance because corneal epithelium forms the outer layer of the eye and is exposed to harsh environmental conditions including hyperosmotic stresses. It is no doubt that the finding of hyperosmotic stress-induced Plk3 activation that phosphorylates ATF-2 and elicits AP-1 transcription activity provides new insight of the novel mechanisms. These mechanisms involve hyperosmotic stress-induced molecular responses that alter expression levels of the important genes to determine human corneal epithelial cell fate.The other responses that cells respond to hyperosmotic stress include activation of sodium-potassium cotransporter, ion channels, and water channels, leading to regulation volume increase. In these processes, numerous proteins and signaling pathways could be activated by hyperosmotic stresses (5Burg M.B. Ferraris J.D. Dmitrieva N.I. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 1441-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The regulation of ATF-2 phosphorylation in response hyperosmotic stress is mostly studied through activation of the p38 pathway (33Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar, 34Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 35van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). It has been shown that growth factors can induce ATF-2 phosphorylation through activation of Src and the p38 signaling pathway (36Ouwens D.M. de Ruiter N.D. van der Zon G.C. Carter A.P. Schouten J. van der Burgt C. Kooistra K. Bos J.L. Maassen J.A. van Dam H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3782-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of inhibiting Src on hyperosmotic stress-induced phosphorylation of ATF-2 with PP2, a potent inhibitor of Src (5Burg M.B. Ferraris J.D. Dmitrieva N.I. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 1441-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 37Lee M. Kim J.Y. Anderson W.B. J. Biol.

PP2 had no effect on either hyperosmotic stress-induced AFT-2 phosphorylation or Plk3 activity, suggesting that Plk3-activated ATF-2 is independent of the Src-mediated pathway. In addition, hyperosmotic stress could induce a DNA double-strand break and activate ATF-2 through activation of ATM/ATR (39Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar, 40Cortez D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37139-37145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It has been shown that caffeine is an effective inhibitor to suppress ATM/ATR activity in various cell types including corneal epithelial cells (41Wang L. Lu L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In our study, application of caffeine to human corneal epithelial cells did not have inhibitory effects on either hyperosmotic stress-induced ATF-2 phosphorylation or Plk3 activity, suggesting that hyperosmotic stress-induced Plk3 activation that subsequently phosphorylates ATF-2 is an independent event from ATM/ATR activity (Fig. 7). These data support the notion that hyperosmotic stress-induced activation of Plk3 is one of the novel signaling pathways that lead to ATF-2 phosphorylation in human corneal epithelial cells. IntroductionHyperosmotic stresses are considered as environmental hazards and pathological conditions from increased extracellular hyperosmolarity occurring in diabetes mellitus, uremia, heat shock, fatal burns, infections, and dehydration after exercise. Hyperosmotic stress extracts water out of cells, resulting in cell shrinkage. To restore the volume, the cells undergo a regulatory volume increase occurred within several minutes by uptake inorganic ions and water (1Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M. Völkl H. Waldegger S.

Cell shrinkage and increased ionic strength ultimately alternate cellular architecture compartments, denature proteins, and disturb cell function (4Westfall P.J. Patterson J.C. Chen R.E. Thorner J.

In addition, a persistent increase in hyperosmotic stress induces DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis (5Burg M.B. Ferraris J.D. Dmitrieva N.I. Physiol.

In the front of the eye, corneal epithelial cells are exposed to these environmental hazards and often injured by hyperosmotic stresses, resulting in delay of wound healing and development of dry eye and other eye diseases (8Corrales R.M.

Activation of procarboxypeptidases is initiated by proteolytic cleavage at the C-terminal end of the propeptide by trypsin. Here, we demonstrate that subsequent cleavage of the propeptide by chymotrypsin C (CTRC) induces a nearly 10-fold increase in the activity of trypsin-activated CPA1 and CPA2, whereas CPB1 activity is unaffected. Other human pancreatic proteases such as chymotrypsin B1, chymotrypsin B2, chymotrypsin-like enzyme-1, elastase 2A, elastase 3A, or elastase 3B are inactive or markedly less effective at promoting procarboxypeptidase activation.

Chymotrypsin C (CTRC) 3The abbreviations used are: CTRCchymotrypsin CCPAcarboxypeptidase A. is a digestive protease synthesized and secreted by pancreatic acinar cells as an inactive precursor (chymotrypsinogen C), which becomes activated in the duodenum after trypsin cleaves the Arg29–Val30 peptide bond at the C-terminal end of the propeptide. The severed propeptide remains attached to CTRC through a disulfide bond. CTRC exhibits chymotrypsin-like substrate specificity as it cleaves after Phe, Tyr, Leu, Met, Gln, and Asn amino acid residues (1Folk J.E. Schirmer E.W. J. Biol.

In the pancreatic juice of ruminants chymotrypsinogen C is found in ternary complex with procarboxypeptidase A (proCPA) and proproteinase E or in binary complex with proCPA (5Brown J.R. Cox D.J.

Recently, we identified human CTRC as a specific regulator of activation and degradation of human cationic trypsinogen and trypsin (8Nemoda Z. Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11879-11886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 9Szmola R. Sahin-Tóth M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11227-11232Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, CTRC stimulates autoactivation of cationic trypsinogen by processing the trypsinogen activation peptide to a shorter form that is more susceptible to tryptic activation. Mutation A16V, which changes the first amino acid in the trypsinogen activation peptide, accelerates CTRC-mediated processing, and carriers of this mutation are at risk of developing chronic pancreatitis (8Nemoda Z. Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11879-11886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). CTRC can also cleave the Leu81–Glu82 peptide bond within the calcium binding loop of cationic trypsin, when calcium concentrations are low, and the binding loop is unoccupied. The combination of this cleavage and an autolytic cleavage at Arg122 results in the degradation and complete inactivation of cationic trypsin (9Szmola R. Sahin-Tóth M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11227-11232Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). CTRC-mediated trypsin degradation is inhibited by calcium, which at millimolar concentrations stabilizes the calcium binding loop. Genetic evidence suggests that trypsin degradation is an important protective mechanism in the pancreas, as loss-of-function variants of CTRC increase the risk for chronic pancreatitis (10Rosendahl J.

Compelled by these observations, we have initiated a systematic investigation into novel regulatory roles of CTRC in digestive enzyme activation and degradation. Here, we present studies on the function of CTRC in promoting activation of human proCPA1 and proCPA2. Pancreatic procarboxypeptidases are the precursors to digestive exopeptidases responsible for removal of C-terminal residues from their dietary protein and peptide substrates (13Avilés F.X. Vendrell J. Guasch A. Coll M. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Vendrell J. Querol E. Avilés F.X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 284-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A-type carboxypeptidases (encoded by the CPA1 and CPA2 genes in humans) act on aromatic and aliphatic amino acid residues exposed by the action of chymotrypsins and elastases, whereas the B-type carboxypeptidase (encoded by the CPB1 gene) hydrolyzes C-terminal Lys and Arg residues generated by tryptic cleavages. Procarboxypeptidases contain a 94–96-amino acid-long N-terminal propeptide, which acts as a strong inhibitor of the enzymes, thereby maintaining their zymogen state. The propeptide consists of an inhibitory globular domain linked through an α-helical connecting segment (helix α3) to the enzyme core (Fig. 1). Seminal studies on the activation mechanism of bovine, porcine, rat, and human procarboxypeptidases elucidated that activation is initiated by tryptic cleavage at the C terminus of the connecting segment, which destabilizes helix α3 and leads to the dissociation of the inhibitory domain (13Avilés F.X.

In the case of proCPA2 and proCPB, trypsin produced a monophasic activation curve, suggesting that trypsin alone was sufficient to cause propeptide dissociation and complete enzyme activation. In contrast, tryptic activation of proCPA1 was found biphasic, indicating that multiple proteolytic cleavages of the propeptide were necessary for the development of full CPA1 activity (13Avilés F.X. Vendrell J. Guasch A. Coll M. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Vendrell J. Guasch A. Coll M. Villegas V. Billeter M. Wider G. Huber R. Wüthrich K. Avilés F.X. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1992; 373: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In porcine proCPA1, these cleavages occurred at a slow rate, and some were assumed to result from atypical trypsin activity at noncanonical sites (19Vendrell J. Cuchillo C.M. Avilés F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6949-6953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the critical role of trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase were also shown in several studies to catalyze procarboxypeptidase activation to varying degrees; however, neither the mechanism nor cleavage sites involved in these alternative activation pathways have been clarified (16Uren J.R. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4483-4492Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Chapus C. Kerfelec B. Foglizzo E. Bonicel J. Eur. J.

To date, no convincing attempt has been made to reconcile all biochemical data and define the likely physiological mechanism of procarboxypeptidase activation in the gut. Here, we describe that CTRC is a potent co-activator of human proCPA1 and proCPA2, as it facilitates dissociation of the propeptide and thereby increases carboxypeptidase activity by almost an order of magnitude. CTRC exerts its effect by proteolyzing the α-helical connecting segment of the propeptide, which becomes accessible only after tryptic activation. Because other human pancreatic proteases are much less effective at promoting procarboxypeptidase activation, CTRC emerges as a novel physiological co-activator of human proCPA1 and proCPA2. Cell culture media and a Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent were obtained from Invitrogen. Carboxypeptidase substrates N-[4-methoxyphenylazoformyl]-l-phenylalanine and N-[4-methoxyphenylazoformyl)-l-arginine were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Human cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1) and proelastase 2A (ELA2A) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by ecotin affinity chromatography as described (25Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22750-22755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 26Sahin-Tóth M. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Sahin-Tóth M. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 12: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Trypsinogen was activated to trypsin with human enteropeptidase (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Human CTRC, chymotrypsinogen B1 (CTRB1), chymotrypsinogen B2 (CTRB2), chymotrypsin-like enzyme-1 precursor (CTRL1), proelastase 3A (ELA3A), and proelastase 3B (ELA3B) were expressed in HEK 293T cells and purified from the conditioned medium by ecotin affinity chromatography (9Szmola R. Sahin-Tóth M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11227-11232Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Lengyel Z. Pál G. Sahin-Tóth M. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 12: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). CTRC, CTRL1, and ELA3B were purified as zymogens, whereas CTRB1, CTRB2, and ELA3A were purified after activation with trypsin. Human SPINK1 (serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1) was expressed in HEK 293T cells and purified on a bovine trypsin affinity column (29Király O. Boulling A. Witt H. Le Maréchal C. Chen J.M. Rosendahl J. Battaggia C. Wartmann T. Sahin-Tóth M. Férec C. Hum. Mutat. 2007; 28: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Chymotrypsinogens and proelastases were activated with immobilized bovine trypsin (Pierce; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the trypsin-containing beads were removed by centrifugation. Protease concentrations were determined by active site titration with ecotin. Ecotin was expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (30Pál G. Sprengel G. Patthy A. Gráf L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 31Pál G. Szilágyi L. Gráf L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues were numbered starting with the initiator methionine of the primary translation product; according to the recommendations of the Human Genome Variation Society. The open reading frame of the human preproCPA2 contains two methionines at its N terminus (Met-Ala-Met-Arg-). Experimental evidence as to which methionine is used for translation initiation is lacking. Alignment with other mammalian CPA2 preproenzymes indicates that only the second methionine is conserved. Therefore, we arbitrarily designated the second methionine as the first amino acid residue of human preproCPA2. The cDNA for human preproCPA1 was amplified by PCR from IMAGE clone 3949850 (GenBankTM accession no. BC005279) using the CPA1-XhoI sense primer (5′-TTT AAA CTC GAG ACC TTC CCT CCC GGC AGC AGC ATG-3′ (where the XhoI site is underlined)) and the CPA1-BamHI antisense primer (5′-TTT AAA GGA TCC GCA AGC CCC AGG ATT CTG TTC CTG-3′ (where the BamHI site is underlined)). The PCR product was digested with XhoI and BamHI and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(−) vector. The cDNA for human preproCPA2 was amplified by PCR from IMAGE clone 3950117 (GenBankTM accession no. BC014571) using the CPA2-NheI sense primer (5′-AAA TTT GCT AGC ACT CCA GGA AAA CCC ATG GCC ATG AGG-3′ (where the NheI site is underlined)) and the CPA2-EcoRI antisense primer (5′-AAA TTT GAA TTC AAA CCA AAG AGA TTT TAA TGG CTC TTG-3′ (where the EcoRI site is underlined)). The PCR product was digested with NheI and EcoRI and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(−) vector. The cDNA for human preproCPB1 was amplified by PCR from IMAGE clone 4422620 (GenBankTM accession no. BC015338) using the CPB1-XhoI sense primer (5′-AAA TTT CTC GAG TCA GAC ACA ATG TTG GCA CTC TTG GTT CTG GTG-3′ (where the XhoI site is underlined)) and the CPB1-BamHI antisense primer (5′-AAA TTT GGA TCC TCT CAA CTA GTA CAG GTG TTC CAG GAC GTA-3′ (where the BamHI site is underlined)). The PCR product was digested with XhoI and BamHI and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(−) vector. Construction of pcDNA3.1(−) expression plasmids harboring the human CTRC; CTRB1; and CTRB2, ELA3A, ELA3B, and SPINK1 cDNAs was reported previously (9Szmola R. Sahin-Tóth M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11227-11232Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 29Király O. Boulling A. Witt H. Le Maréchal C. Chen J.M. Rosendahl J. Battaggia C. Wartmann T. Sahin-Tóth M. Férec C. Hum. Mutat. 2007; 28: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cDNA for human CTRL1 precursor was PCR-amplified from IMAGE clone 5748224 (GenBankTM accession no. BC039716) with the CTRL1 EcoRI sense primer (5′-AAA TTT GAA TTC TCT GCC ACG ATG TTG CTG CTC AGC CTG-3′ (where the EcoRI site is underlined)) and CTRL1 BamHI antisense primer (5′-AAA TTT GGA TCC GTG AGC TCA GTT GTA GGC TAT GAC CTG-3′ (where the BamHI site is underlined)). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(−) vector. The pTrapT7 bacterial expression plasmids harboring the human PRSS1 and ELA2A cDNAs were described earlier (25Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22750-22755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 26Sahin-Tóth M. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 27Szepessy E. Sahin-Tóth M. Pancreatology. 2006; 6: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Missense mutations in proCPA1 and proCPA2 were generated by overlap extension PCR mutagenesis and cloned in the appropriate expression plasmids. HEK 293T cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS, and 4 mm l-glutamine in 75 cm2 flasks to 95% confluence. Transfections were carried out using 30 μg of plasmid DNA and 75 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. After 16–20 h, cells were washed with Opti-MEM medium and covered with 20 ml of the same medium. Conditioned media were harvested after a 48-h incubation; replaced with 20 ml of fresh Opti-MEM and harvested again at 96 h. Conditioned media were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and loaded directly onto a MonoQ column through the pump of a Pharmacia FPLC system. The column was developed with a NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m over 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min). Fractions (1 ml) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The purest fractions (>90%) were used for experiments. Concentrations of the purified zymogen solutions were estimated from their ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm, using extinction coefficients calculated with the web-based ProtParam tool. CPA1 and CPA2 activity were determined using the N-[4-methoxyphenylazoformyl]-l-phenylalanine substrate at 60 μm final concentration (32Mock W.L. Liu Y. Stanford D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The assay mix contained 4 μl of CPA1/CPA2 enzyme (80 nm, final concentration), 86 μl of assay buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.05% Tween 20) and 10 μl of 0.6 mm substrate dissolved in assay buffer. CPB1 activity was measured with N-[4-methoxyphenylazoformyl)-l-arginine under the same conditions (33Mock W.L. Stanford D.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 1193-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The decrease in absorbance was followed at 350 nm for 2 min in a SPECTRAmax Plus 384 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Rates of substrate consumption obtained in mOD·min−1 units (OD, optical density) were converted to nm·s−1 values using an extinction coefficient of 19,000 m−1 cm−1 corrected for the shorter path length of the microplate wells. Note that addition of ZnCl2 (100 μm concentration) had no effect on the enzyme activity; therefore, it was omitted from the routine assay conditions. Digestion reactions were stopped by adding 0.17% TFA (final concentration) and stored frozen. Prior to mass spectrometry, samples were desalted by micro solid-phase extraction using C4 ZipTips (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Briefly, C4 ZipTips were wetted with 80% acetonitrile and then equilibrated with 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA. Proteins were bound to the resin by pipetting the samples through the tips several times, and the tips were washed with 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA by pipetting this solution through the tip twice. Proteins were eluted with 10 μl 80% acetonitrile into Eppendorf tubes and transferred to 96-well plates (Advion, Ithaca, NY). High resolution mass spectra were acquired with direct infusion at a flow rate of 10 μl/min on a LTQ-OrbitrapTM hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a TriVersa NanoMate ion source (Advion). Electrospray ionization was carried out at 1.7 kV using the NanoMate, with the LTQ heated capillary set to 150 °C. Mass spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode over the range m/z 300–2000 at a resolution of 60,000 (∼1 mass spectrum/s). Mass accuracy after internal calibration was within 4 ppm. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using XCalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Experimental mass values were assigned to specific peptide sequences by PAWS software (Genomic Solutions, Holliston, MA). Human proCPA1 and proCPA2 were expressed in transiently transfected HEK 293T cells and purified from the conditioned medium as described under “Experimental Procedures.” N-terminal sequencing of the mature zymogens yielded homogeneous sequences of Lys-Glu-Asp-Phe-Val for proCPA1 and Leu-Glu-Thr-Phe-Val for proCPA2, which corresponded to the N termini expected after removal of the secretory signal peptide (34Catasús L.

Puigserver A. Billeter M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6651-6657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Catalytic parameters were determined for the fully activated CPA1/CPA2 enzymes on the N-[4-methoxyphenylazoformyl]-l-phenylalanine substrate (supplemental Table S1). The kcat/Km values were comparable with or higher than those reported in the literature for native or recombinant human CPA1/CPA2 using small substrates (36Peterson L.M. Sokolovsky M. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2501-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 37Laethem R.M. Blumenkopf T.A. Cory M. Elwell L. Moxham C.P. Ray P.H. Walton L.M. Smith G.K. Arch. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Procarboxypeptidases (2 μm concentration) were incubated with human cationic trypsin (100 nm concentration), and the digestion products were visualized by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2, trypsin converted the zymogen bands to a carboxypeptidase band and a smaller band (∼12 kDa) corresponding to the released N-terminal propeptide. The reaction was nearly complete within 5 min, and both bands appeared stable up to 80 min showing no signs of further degradation. N-terminal sequencing of the propeptides showed the same N termini as observed for the intact proenzymes, confirming that trypsin only cleaved at the C-terminal end of the propeptides. N-terminal sequencing of the CPA1 and CPA2 bands revealed homogeneous sequences of Ala-Arg-Ser-Thr-Asp and Ser-Gly-Asn-Phe-Asn, respectively, indicating that trypsin digested the Arg110–Ala111 (proCPA1) and Arg112–Ser113 (proCPA2) peptide bonds, known sites of tryptic activation (19Vendrell J. Cuchillo C.M. Avilés F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6949-6953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Reverter D. Ventura S. Villegas V. Vendrell J. Avilés F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3535-3541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To confirm the importance of these sites, Arg110 in proCPA1 and Arg112 in proCPA2 were mutated to Gln. As expected, these mutations dramatically reduced the rate of activation of both proenzymes by trypsin (Fig. 2). Mass spectrometry of the CPA1/CPA2 propeptides, on the other hand, showed that the C-terminal amino acid after a 5-min trypsin activation was mainly Arg108, consistent with tryptic cleavages of the Arg108–Ser109 (proCPA1) and Arg108–Arg109 (proCPA2) peptide bonds (supplemental Tables S2–S4). Propeptide forms ending in Arg110 (CPA1, CPA2) and Arg112 (CPA2) were also detected in lower amounts. Taken together with the N-terminal sequencing results (see above) and considering the protective effects of the R110Q (proCPA1) and R112Q (proCPA2) mutations, these observations suggest that trypsin acts in a sequential manner. First, it cleaves proCPA1 after Arg110, followed by cleavage after Arg108. In proCPA2, trypsin cleaves first after Arg112 and subsequently at Arg110 and Arg108, in agreement with previously published data (23Reverter D. Ventura S. Villegas V. Vendrell J. Avilés F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3535-3541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, trypsin removes two amino acids (Ser109–Arg110) from proCPA1 and four amino acids (Arg109–Arg110-Glu111–Arg112) from proCPA2 and generates stable, 92-amino acid-long propeptides from both human proenzymes (Fig. 1). Note that in proCPA2 helix α3 of the connecting segment is longer by a turn than in proCPA1; however, the α3 helices in the two proenzymes are trimmed to the same length as a result of tryptic activation. Activation of proCPA1 or proCPA2 with human cationic trypsin resulted in the rapid appearance of carboxypeptidase activity, which reached a plateau at ∼10 min and remained stable afterward (Fig. 3). Addition of relatively low concentrations of CTRC (50 nm) to trypsin-activated CPA1 or CPA2 caused a sudden and dramatic increase in carboxypeptidase activity, which was 8–10-fold higher than the activity obtained after trypsin-mediated activation alone (Fig. 3). Incubation of proCPA1 or proCPA2 with CTRC alone yielded no measurable carboxypeptidase activity, indicating that CTRC-mediated activation was dependent on prior tryptic activation of the carboxypeptidase zymogens. As expected, mutation of the catalytic serine 216 to alanine in CTRC abolished the activating effect of CTRC (data not shown). The observations suggest that trypsin-mediated activation of proCPA1 or proCPA2 does not result in complete dissociation of the inhibitory propeptide and subsequent cleavage(s) by CTRC are required for the complete elimination of inhibition and development of full carboxypeptidase activity. CTRC had no effect on the activity of CPB1 activated with trypsin (data not shown). The partial (∼10%) activity of trypsin-activated proCPA1/proCPA2 suggests that the trypsin-severed propeptide is still bound to the enzyme; however, either its binding affinity is weakened resulting in partial dissociation, or the propeptide underwent a conformational change partially exposing the active site. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we measured the concentration dependence of enzyme activity of trypsin-activated proCPA1/proCPA2. If the 10% activity is due to a conformational change of the bound propeptide, the concentration-activity relationship should be linear. On the other hand, if the 10% activity is due to weakened binding and partial dissociation of the propeptide, the concentration-activity relationship would show a square-root function; in agreement with the law of mass action. The experimental data shown in Fig. 4 clearly supported the latter case. In contrast, the concentration-activity relationships for CPA1/CPA2 fully activated with trypsin and CTRC gave completely linear functions (supplemental Fig. S1). The equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) for the binding of the CPA1/CPA2 propeptides were estimated from Fig. 4 as 0.8 nm. CTRC alone did not cleave the intact proCPA1 and proCPA2 zymogens to any detectable extent, as judged by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). In contrast, addition of CTRC to trypsin-activated CPA1/CPA2 resulted in relatively rapid degradation of the propeptide (Fig. 5). Catalytically impaired carboxypeptidase variants were also produced by mutating Arg237 in CPA1 and Arg235 in CPA2 to Ala. Arg237 corresponds to Arg127 in the mature CPA1 enzyme; and mutation of this amino acid in rat CPA1 was previously shown to decrease catalytic activity by four orders of magnitude (39Phillips M.A. Fletterick R.

The trypsin-processed propeptides of the R237A proCPA1 and R235A proCPA2 mutants were also readily degraded by CTRC (Fig. 4), indicating that CPA1/CPA2 activity is not required for propeptide degradation. To determine CTRC cleavage sites in the propeptides, the digestion product mixtures were analyzed by mass spectrometry. These efforts were hampered by the fact that CPA1/CPA2 removed C-terminal amino acids exposed by CTRC-mediated cleavages. Therefore"

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, such down-regulation is achieved through the Rad53 kinase-dependent block of origins of replication. We have identified the Rad53 phosphorylation sites on Dbf4, the activator subunit of the essential S phase Dbf4-dependent kinase, and generated a non-phosphorylatable Dbf4 mutant (dbf4(7A)). We show here that dbf4(7A) is a bona fide intra-S phase checkpoint bypass allele that contributes to abrogating the Rad53 block of origin firing in response to genotoxic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2012304127,"RNA 3′-phosphate cyclase (Rtc) enzymes are a widely distributed family that catalyze the synthesis of RNA 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate ends via an ATP-dependent pathway comprising three nucleotidyl transfer steps: reaction of Rtc with ATP to form a covalent Rtc-(histidinyl-N)-AMP intermediate and release PPi; transfer of AMP from Rtc to an RNA 3′-phosphate to form an RNA(3′)pp(5′)A intermediate; and attack by the terminal nucleoside O2′ on the 3′-phosphate to form an RNA 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate product and release AMP. The chemical transformations of the cyclase pathway resemble those of RNA and DNA ligases, with the key distinction being that ligases covalently adenylylate 5′-phosphate ends en route to phosphodiester synthesis. Here we show that the catalytic repertoire of RNA cyclase overlaps that of ligases. We report that Escherichia coli RtcA catalyzes adenylylation of 5′-phosphate ends of DNA or RNA strands to form AppDNA and AppRNA products. The polynucleotide 5′ modification reaction requires the His309 nucleophile, signifying that it proceeds through a covalent RtcA-AMP intermediate. We established this point directly by demonstrating transfer of [32P]AMP from RtcA to a pDNA strand. RtcA readily adenylylated the 5′-phosphate at a 5′-PO4/3′-OH nick in duplex DNA but was unable to covert the nicked DNA-adenylate to a sealed phosphodiester. Our findings raise the prospect that cyclization of RNA 3′-ends might not be the only biochemical pathway in which Rtc enzymes participate; we discuss scenarios in which the 5′-adenylyltransferase of RtcA might play a role.

In the first step, RtcA reacts with ATP and a divalent cation to form a covalent Rtc-AMP intermediate and liberate PPi. Adenylate is linked via a phosphoamide bond to the His309 Nϵ atom (13Tanaka N. Smith P. Shuman S. Structure. 2010; 18: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the second step, the adenylate is transferred from RtcA-AMP to the RNA 3′-phosphate terminus to form an activated phosphoanhydride intermediate, RNA(3′)pp(5′)A. In the third step, the terminal RNA ribose 2′-OH attacks the 3′-phosphate of RNA(3′)pp(5′)A to generate an RNA 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate product and release AMP. The RNA cyclase pathway is reminiscent of the three nucleotidyl transfer steps catalyzed by RNA and DNA ligases, also via enzyme-AMP and polynucleotide-adenylate intermediates (14Shuman S. Lima C.D.

The cyclase and ligase pathways differ in that: (i) ligases rely on lysine rather than histidine as the nucleophile for enzyme adenylylation during step 1; (ii) ligases transfer the adenylate to a polynucleotide 5′-phosphate end during step 2 to form an A(5′)pp(5′)RNA/DNA intermediate; (iii) attack by a nucleoside 3′-OH on the adenylylated end during ligation step 3 generates a 3′,5′-phosphodiester linkage between two polynucleotide ends rather than a cyclic phosphodiester terminus on one polynucleotide. The lack of structural similarity between RNA cyclases and RNA/DNA ligases, either globally or with respect to their active site architectures (13Tanaka N. Smith P. Shuman S.

Despite the depth of understanding of RtcA structure and mechanism (12Billy E. Hess D. Hofsteenge J. Filipowicz W. J. Biol.

RNA. 2009; 15: 1865-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the physiological role of RNA cyclase remains mysterious. RtcA is inessential in E. coli (11Genschik P. Drabikowski K. Filipowicz W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25516-25526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Budding yeast have no active RNA cyclase in their proteomes (22Billy E. Wegierski T. Nasr F. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2115-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because RtcA-type enzymes were purified based on their cyclization activity in vitro (9Vicente O. Filipowicz W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 11Genschik P. Drabikowski K. Filipowicz W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25516-25526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it is naturally assumed that cyclization is their true function, indeed their only function. In the present study, we test this view and query whether the catalytic repertoire of RNA cyclase overlaps that of RNA/DNA ligases. We report that E. coli RtcA catalyzes adenylylation of 5′-phosphate ends of DNA or RNA strands to form AppDNA and AppRNA products. We delineate the reaction requirements and demonstrate the capacity of RtcA to adenylylate the 5′-phosphate at a 3′-OH/5-PO4 nick in duplex DNA. Whereas RtcA executes the first two steps of the polynucleotide ligase pathway, it is unable to convert the nicked DNA-adenylate into a sealed phosphodiester. Wild-type E. coli RtcA and mutant H309A were produced as N-terminal His10-tagged fusion proteins and purified from soluble bacterial extracts by sequential Ni-agarose, anion-exchange, and gel-filtration chromatography steps as described (13Tanaka N. Smith P. Shuman S. Structure. 2010; 18: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Wild-type Chlorella virus DNA ligase and mutant K27A were produced as N-terminal His10-tagged fusions and purified from soluble bacterial extracts by Ni-agarose and phosphocellulose chromatography (23Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The polynucleotide substrates used in the adenylylation assays were 5′-32P end-labeled and then gel-purified as described (24Shuman S. Ru X.M. Virology. 1995; 211: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Adenylylation reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 6.0), 1 mm DTT, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 3 pmol (300 nm) 5′-32P-labeled 12-mer DNA oligonucleotide 5′-pCAATTGCGACCC (or other polynucleotides as specified), and RtcA as specified were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were quenched by adding 5 μl of 90% formamide, 50 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue. The samples were heated at 95 °C for 1 min and then analyzed by electrophoresis (at 7 W for ∼100 min) through a 15-cm 24% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea in 0.45 mm Tris borate, 1.2 mm EDTA. The radiolabeled products were visualized by autoradiography. The extents of DNA adenylylation were quantified by scanning the gel with a Fujix BAS2500 imager. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 6.0), 1 mm DTT, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 300 nm 12-mer DNA substrate, and either 80 nm RtcA (RtcA+) or no added enzyme (RtcA−) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Aliquots (2 μl) of the reaction mixtures were then subjected to digestion with various analytical enzymes, either calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIP), nuclease P1, or nucleotidyl pyrophosphatase (NPPase). The CIP reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 unit CIP (New England Biolabs) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Nuclease P1 reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 1 mm ZnCl2, and 0.1 unit nuclease P1 (Sigma) were incubated for 20 min at 50 °C. For double digestions with nuclease P1 and CIP, the samples were initially digested with nuclease P1 as described above, then the reactions were adjusted to CIP buffer and subsequently treated with CIP as above. For double digestions with nuclease P1 and NPPase, the P1-treated samples were adjusted to 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl and then incubated with 0.001 unit NPPase (Sigma) for 20 min at 37 °C. For triple digestions, the P1/NPPase double-digested samples were adjusted to CIP buffer and then incubated with 0.1 unit CIP for 1 h at 37 °C. The digestion reactions were quenched by adding 2 μl of 5 m formic acid. Aliquots (6 μl) of the quenched samples were then spotted on a polyethyleneimine (PEI)-cellulose TLC plate (Merck) alongside unlabeled marker nucleotides CTP, CDP, and CMP. Ascending TLC was performed with 0.75 m LiCl as the mobile phase. The radiolabeled species were visualized by autoradiography of the TLC plate. Unlabeled marker nucleotides were located by UV illumination. An in vitro adenylylation reaction mixture (70 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 50 μm [α-32P]ATP, 250 μm pyrophosphate, and 16 μm RtcA was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The resulting RtcA-[32P]AMP complex was recovered by centrifugal gel filtration through a 0.5-ml spin desalting column (7-kDa cutoff; Pierce) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 6.0), 1 mm DTT. The gel filtrate was stored at −80 °C. An aliquot of the gel filtrate was analyzed by electrophoresis through a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. The RtcA-[32P]AMP adduct was quantified by scanning the gel with a Fujix BAS-2500 imager in parallel with serial dilution of the [α-32P]ATP stock solution. [32P]AMP transfer reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 6.0), 1 mm DTT, 200 fmol (20 nm) RtcA-[32P]AMP, and either 1 pmol (100 nm) cold 5′-phosphate-terminated 12-mer DNA (5′-pCAATTGCGACCCOH), 1 pmol (100 nm) cold 5′-hydroxyl-terminated 12-mer DNA (5′-HOCAATTGCGACCCOH), or no added polynucleotide were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were quenched with formamide-EDTA, and the reaction products were resolved by urea-PAGE. Reaction of purified recombinant E. coli RtcA with a 5′-32P-labeled 12-mer DNA oligonucleotide in the presence of ATP and magnesium resulted in conversion of the radiolabeled substrate to a novel product that migrated ∼1.5 nucleotide steps slower during electrophoresis through a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1A). The extent of product formation was proportional to the level of input RtcA; virtually all of the substrate was converted to the larger product at saturating enzyme (Fig. 1, A and B). From the slope of the titration curve, we estimated that ∼4 pmol of product was generated per pmol of RtcA (Fig. 1B). By contrast, RtcA mutant H309A, which lacks the histidine to which AMP becomes covalently attached during the RNA 3′-cyclization pathway (12Billy E. Hess D. Hofsteenge J. Filipowicz W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34955-34960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Tanaka N. Smith P. Shuman S. Structure. 2010; 18: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), was unreactive with the 5′-32P-labeled 12-mer DNA at a level of input protein that was saturating for product formation by wild-type RtcA (Fig. 1A). We surmise that the novel reaction evinced by this experiment entails transfer of adenylate from the RtcA-AMP covalent intermediate to the DNA 5′-monophosphate to form a DNA-adenylate, A(5′)pp(5′)DNA (Fig. 1B). Similar experiments performed with a 5′-32P-labeled 12-mer RNA oligonucleotide revealed an RtcA concentration-dependent conversion of the pRNA substrate to a single, slower migrating product (supplemental Fig. S1). About 2.5 pmol of this RNA product was formed per pmol of RtcA (supplemental Fig. S1). RtcA-H309A was unable to perform the putative RNA 5′-adenylylation reaction. These results reveal the capacity of RtcA to catalyze a ligase-like 5′-end activation reaction at either pDNA or pRNA ends. In the experiments here and below, we used the 12-mer pDNA substrate to characterize the 5′-adenylylation activity of RtcA. The kinetic profile of the reaction of 80 nm RtcA with 300 nm pDNA in the presence of ATP and magnesium revealed steady accumulation of product between 1 and 10 min; the reaction reached an end point at 20–30 min with 96% conversion to AppDNA (Fig. 2A), signifying that the input RtcA had catalyzed multiple rounds of product formation. The rate of product formation (i.e. the slope of the curve), declined progressively as the substrate was consumed (Fig. 2A). Omission of ATP resulted in a different kinetic pattern, whereby an end point was achieved within minutes with only 11–12% conversion of pDNA to AppDNA (Fig. 2A). ATP-independent transadenylylation reflects a single-turnover reaction catalyzed by the substantial fraction of preadenylylated RtcA in the enzyme preparation (13Tanaka N. Smith P. Shuman S. Structure. 2010; 18: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). From the extent of AppDNA formed by 80 nm total RtcA protein in the −ATP reaction, we estimated that active RtcA-AMP comprised at least 45% of the RtcA preparation. Omission of magnesium also curtailed the reaction at a low end point, but there appeared to be a biphasic kinetic pattern, whereby an initial burst of adenylylation (to ∼12% conversion at 3 min) was followed by a slower accumulation of product, to an extent of 26% at 30 min (Fig. 2). The pH profile of the multiturnover 5′-adenylation reaction of E. coli RtcA was noteworthy for its optimum at mildly acidic pH (5.5–6.0 in Tris acetate buffer) and a sharp decline in product formation at alkaline pH (≥8.0 in Tris-HCl) (Fig. 2B). The multiturnover RNA 3′-cyclization reaction of RtcA displays a very different pH profile, with a sharp optimum at pH 8.0–8.5 and virtually no activity at pH ≤6.0 (11Genschik P. Drabikowski K. Filipowicz W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25516-25526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the case of the single-turnover 5′-adenylylation reaction of RtcA (without ATP or magnesium), the yields of AppDNA were similar across the entire range tested, from pH 4.5 to 9.5 (data not shown). In subsequent experiments, we assayed multiturnover 5′-adenylylation at pH 6.0. Single-turnover 5′-adenylylation was performed at pH 6.0 or 7.4. The results in Fig. 2A highlight the importance of ATP and magnesium in promoting a multiturnover process of 5′-adenylylation under conditions of pDNA excess, presumably via their contributions to the reaction of RtcA apoenzyme with ATP to regenerate the RtcA-AMP intermediate. They also suggest that ATP and magnesium are not strictly essential for the subsequent step of adenylate transfer from RtcA-AMP to the pDNA end. We verified this inference by examining the adenylylation reaction in the absence of magnesium and ATP under conditions in which the concentration of RtcA-AMP was in 12-fold excess over that of the pDNA substrate (supplemental Fig. S2). AppDNA accumulated with pseudo-first-order kinetics (kobs 0.18 min−1), and the reaction reached an end point at 20–40 min with 95% conversion of pDNA to AppDNA (supplemental Fig. S2). We considered the possibility that the RtcA preparation might contain residual divalent cations, but found that the extent of AppDNA formation under single-turnover conditions in RtcA-AMP excess was unaffected by inclusion of 10 mm EDTA in the reaction mixture (data not shown). The identity of the putative AppDNA product was verified by digestion of the product with various hydrolytic enzymes, CIP, NPPase, or nuclease P1, singly or sequentially. The 32P-labeled digestion products were analyzed by ascending PEI-cellulose TLC in parallel with untreated input pDNA substrate and untreated RtcA reaction product (Fig. 3). The pDNA substrate (lane 2) and the RtcA product (lane 1) remained at the chromatographic origin, as expected for polyanionic oligonucleotides. Whereas the 5′-[32P]phosphate of the pDNA substrate was converted quantitatively by CIP to 32Pi (lane 4), the RtcA reaction product was resistant to CIP (lane 3), signifying that the product 5′-end was blocked. Digestion of the substrate with nuclease P1 (which cleaves the 3′-O-P bond) liberated a single species, predicted to be 5′-dCMP, that co-migrated with the marker mononucleotide 5′-CMP (lane 6) and was quantitatively converted by CIP to 32Pi (lane 8). By contrast, nuclease P1 digestion of the RtcA reaction product liberated a single species (lane 5; migrating slightly faster than 5′-dCMP), that was resistant to CIP (lane 7). However, when the nuclease P1-digested RtcA product, predicted to be a dinucleotide App(dC), was treated with NPPase, it was converted to a CIP-sensitive species (lane 9; co-migrating with the 5′-dCMP mononucleotide) that was hydrolyzed quantitatively to 32Pi during subsequent CIP treatment (lane 11). These results are fully consistent with our designation of the RtcA reaction product as A(5′)pp(5′)DNA. A series of 5′-32P-labeled DNAs of varying length, but common 5′-nucleotide sequence, were tested as substrates for RtcA at equivalent oligonucleotide concentrations. Enzyme titration experiments revealed similar specific activities for 21-mer, 18-mer, 15-mer, and 12-mer pDNAs (Fig. 4). By contrast, 9-mer and 6-mer pDNAs were 2-fold and 4-fold less reactive, respectively, than the 12-mer substrate (Fig. 4). The proposed reaction scheme for 5′-adenylylation by RtcA, based on the stimulation of the multiturnover reaction by ATP and the requirement for the His309 nucleophile, is that an AMP covalently attached to RtcA is the source of the blocking nucleotide of the AppDNA product. We tested this prediction by adenylylating RtcA in vitro by reaction with [α-32P]ATP in the presence of magnesium and 250 μm PPi. (PPi enhances the yield of AMP labeling by virtue of converting preformed cold RtcA-AMP to RtcA apoenzyme (13Tanaka N. Smith P. Shuman S. Structure. 2010; 18: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).) The RtcA-[32P]AMP intermediate was recovered by gel filtration under native conditions, and the level of radiolabeled enzyme was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis and quantification of the covalent RtcA-[32P]AMP adduct. The isolated RtcA-[32P]AMP intermediate was then incubated with either cold 5′-monophosphate-terminated 12-mer DNA (5′-pCAATTGCGACCCOH), cold 5′-OH-terminated 12-mer DNA (5′-HOCAATTGCGACCCOH), or no added polynucleotide. The products of these reactions were analyzed by urea-PAGE (Fig. 5). The salient finding was that RtcA-[32P]AMP transferred the labeled adenylate to the pDNA strand to yield a [32P]AMP-labeled oligonucleotide product (lane 2) that co-migrated with the AppDNA species formed by reaction of cold RtcA with 5′-32P-labeled 12-mer DNA (lane 1). The formation of the [32P]AMP-labeled oligonucleotide depended on inclusion of the 12-mer pDNA strand (lane 4). Moreover, RtcA-[32P]AMP was unreactive with an otherwise identical 12-mer DNA with a 5′-OH terminus (lane 3). These results support the following two-step reaction pathway.RtcA+ATP→RtcA−AMP+PPiREACTION 1RtcA−AMP+pDNA→AppDNA+RtcAREACTION 2The results also establish the specificity for a terminal phosphomonoester as the nucleophile in the second step of the 5′-adenylylation reaction, the same requirement that pertains to the second adenylate transfer step of the 3′-phosphate cyclization pathway. The capacity of RtcA to catalyze ligase-like 5′-end-activation reactions raises the question of whether RtcA might also be capable of phosphodiester synthesis, akin to the third step of the ligase pathway. A corollary issue is whether the 5′-adenylyltransferase activity of RtcA is restricted to single-stranded pDNA and pRNA acceptors or more broadly accepting of duplex structures such as those repaired by canonical DNA ligases. We addressed these questions by presenting RtcA with a singly nicked 36-bp duplex formed by annealing a 5′-32P-labeled 18-mer strand and an unlabeled 18-mer 3′-OH strand to a complementary 36-mer (Fig. 6). Control experiments verified that reaction of this nicked duplex with Chlorella virus DNA ligase resulted in efficient conversion of the radiolabeled 18-mer pDNA strand into a sealed 36-mer product (Fig. 6, compare lanes 1 and 5). By contrast, reaction of RtcA with the nicked duplex resulted in near quantitative conversion of the labeled pDNA strand to a novel species that migrated ∼1.5 nucleotide steps slower during urea-PAGE, said species corresponding to a 5′-adenylylated 18-mer AppDNA (Fig. 6, lane 3). There was no detectable 36-mer ligation product in the RtcA reaction. To verify the identity and integrity of the putative nicked DNA-adenylate formed by RtcA, we reacted the RtcA product with a mutated version of Chlorella virus DNA ligase (K27A) that lacks the lysine to which AMP is covalently attached during the ligase adenylylation reaction (23Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The K27A protein is inert in sealing a 5′-PO4/3′-OH nick (Fig. 6, lane 2) but is active in catalyzing phosphodiester synthesis at a preadenylylated nick (23Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The instructive finding was that the K27A ligase sealed the adenylylated nick formed by RtcA to yield a 36-mer ligation product (Fig. 6, lane 4). Thus, we conclude that RtcA can generate the same covalently activated nick as DNA ligase but cannot proceed with phosphodiester synthesis (at least not under the conditions surveyed here). We report here a novel polynucleotide 5′-adenylylation activity of E. coli RtcA that highlights its similarities to RNA and DNA ligases, notwithstanding the lack of structural homology between the cyclase and ligase protein families. It is now evident that RtcA does not discriminate strictly between polynucleotide 3′-monophosphate and polynucleotide 5′-monophosphate ends as nucleophiles capable of attacking the AMP phosphate of the RtcA-AMP intermediate. Whereas an activated RNA(3′)pp(5′)A is thought be a transient intermediate that is instantly converted via intramolecular attack to an RNA 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate end product (7Filipowicz W. Strugala K. Konarska M. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 1316-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Genschik P. Drabikowski K. Filipowicz W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25516-25526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the activated A(5′)pp(5′)DNA/RNA species reported here is itself a stable end product, reflecting the absence of a vicinal hydroxyl nucleophile in cis. The versatility of RtcA in generating AppDNA and AppRNA strands in excellent yield recommends its use as a reagent for polynucleotide synthesis and RNA cloning, especially in strategies that employ preadenylylated linkers to selectively tag one RNA end (25Pfeffer S. Sewer A. Lagos-Quintana M. Sheridan R. Sander C. Grässer F.A. van Dyk L.F. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Chien M. Russo J.J. Ju J. Randall G. Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. Simon V. Ho D.D. Zavolan M. Tuschl T. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). The liberal use of either DNA or RNA strands for 5′-adenylylation has interesting implications for the mode of polynucleotide acceptor recognition. The crystal structures of the RtcA-AMP intermediate and the RtcA apoenzyme revealed an oxyanion-binding pocket adjacent to the adenylate site that was proposed to mediate the binding of the 3′-monophosphate and penultimate phosphodiester of the RNAp substrate for the cyclization reaction (13Tanaka N. Smith P. Shuman S. Structure. 2010; 18: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Palm G.J. Billy E. Filipowicz W. Wlodawer A. Structure. 2000; 8: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A parsimonious view of the present findings with respect to 5′-adenylylation is that pDNA/RNA strands bind to this same site on the enzyme, albeit with opposite polarity, such that the sites occupied by two sulfates in the RtcA-AMP structure (13Tanaka N. Smith P. Shuman S. Structure. 2010; 18: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) would demarcate the positions of the 5′-monophosphate and adjacent phosphodiester in the 5′-adenylyltransferase substrate. A definitive evaluation of this model must await co-crystallization of RtcA with bound polynucleotide substrates or adenylylated polynucleotide products/intermediates. The biological functions and physiological substrates of RNA cyclases are uncharted. The present study raises the interesting prospect that cyclization of RNA 3′-ends might not be the only biochemical pathway in which they participate. We envision a number of biological scenarios in which the 5′-adenylyltransferase of RtcA might play a role. These include: (i) adenylylation of DNA or RNA 5′-ends as a means of protecting them against exonucleolytic decay, analogous to the function of the eukaryal mRNA cap; (ii) installing an inverted 5′-adenylate as a “mark” that targets RNA or DNA molecules for downstream events, e.g. localization, translation, recombination, etc; or (iii) the generation of AppDNA or AppRNA ends that serve as substrates for subsequent DNA/RNA sealing reactions catalyzed by separate repair enzymes. Finally, it is now apparent that Nature has evolved at least two distinct structural solutions to the chemical steps of 5′-nucleotidylation, exemplified by the ligase/capping enzyme superfamily and the Rtc superfamily, respectively, both of which rely on covalent catalysis via a phosphoramidate enzyme-NMP intermediate.

https://openalex.org/W2089387031,"ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels are the target of a number of pharmacological agents, blockers like hypoglycemic sulfonylureas and openers like the hypotensive cromakalim and diazoxide. These agents act on the channel regulatory subunit, the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR), which is an ABC protein with homologies to P-glycoprotein (P-gp). P-gp is a multidrug transporter expressed in tumor cells and in some healthy tissues. Because these two ABC proteins both exhibit multispecific recognition properties, we have tested whether SUR ligands could be substrates of P-gp. Interaction with P-gp was assayed by monitoring ATPase activity of P-gp-enriched vesicles. The blockers glibenclamide, tolbutamide, and meglitinide increased ATPase activity, with a rank order of potencies that correlated with their capacity to block KATP channels. P-gp ATPase activity was also increased by the openers SR47063 (a cromakalim analog), P1075 (a pinacidil analog), and diazoxide. Thus, these molecules bind to P-gp (although with lower affinities than for SUR) and are possibly transported by P-gp. Competition experiments among these molecules as well as with typical P-gp substrates revealed a structural similarity between drug binding domains in the two proteins. To rationalize the observed data, we addressed the molecular features of these proteins and compared structural models, computerized by homology from the recently solved structures of murine P-gp and bacterial ABC transporters MsbA and Sav1866. Considering the various residues experimentally assigned to be involved in drug binding, we uncovered several hot spots, which organized spatially in two main binding domains, selective for SR47063 and for glibenclamide, in matching regions of both P-gp and SUR.

ABC 8The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; KATP channel, ATP-sensitive K+; SUR, sulfonylurea receptor; TM(D), transmembrane (domain); NBD, nucleotide binding domain; P-gp, P-glycoprotein. proteins form a large superfamily of mostly membrane proteins. They present as common characteristics a nucleotide binding domain able to hydrolyze ATP, which includes the sequence motifs Walker A and B and the signature C (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3350) Google Scholar). As membrane active transporters, they are expressed in virtually all branches of the living reign, and they exhibit a very broad diversity of transported substrates, handled in either the direction of influx or efflux (2Holland I.B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). In higher mammals, they are involved in various pathophysiological situations and genetic diseases (3Vasiliou V. Vasiliou K. Nebert D.W. Hum. Genomics. 2009; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The KATP channel results from the constitutive association of four pore-forming Kir6.x subunits and four regulatory SUR subunits (4Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement 4th, J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar, 5Antcliff J.F. Haider S. Proks P. Sansom M.S. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In various combinations of the SUR isoforms, SUR1, SUR2A, and SUR2B, and the Kir6 isoforms, Kir6.1 and Kir6.2, these channels are present in most excitable cells, including neuronal, cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and endocrine cells (6Shi N.Q. Ye B. Makielski J.C. J Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2005; 39: 51-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), where they serve to couple membrane electrical properties to intracellular metabolism. SUR, a member of the ABCC/MRP (multidrug resistance-associated protein) subfamily of ABC proteins, is the site of action of numerous drugs that cause either closing (KATP channel blockers) or opening (KATP channel openers) of the Kir6.x potassium pore (7Moreau C. Prost A.L. Dérand R. Vivaudou M. J Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2005; 38: 951-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Blockers include antidiabetic drugs, sulfonylureas like glibenclamide as well as non-sulfonylureas like meglitinide. Openers present interesting therapeutic opportunities, in particular for their antihypertensive and cardioprotective properties; a few, like diazoxide, pinacidil, nicorandil, and minoxidil, are in clinical use as treatment against hypertension, angina pectoris, and alopecia, respectively (8Jahangir A. Terzic A. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2005; 39: 99-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Among ABC proteins of higher organisms, SUR stands out because its only known function is that of a channel regulator, whereas most others are active (or passive in the case of CFTR) transporters. However, SUR possesses strong sequence homologies with other eukaryotic ABC proteins, like the multidrug resistance transporters MRP1 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), suggesting that these proteins could share some structural and pharmacological properties (9Moreau C. Gally F. Jacquet-Bouix H. Vivaudou M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Indeed, SUR is the target of a panel of structurally unrelated ligands, like P-gp and other multidrug transporters. Multispecific drug recognition by P-gp is still a misunderstood molecular property despite a mass of published data, including extensive mutational analyses (10Shilling R.A. Venter H. Velamakanni S. Bapna A. Woebking B. Shahi S. van Veen H.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 195-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as well as a pharmacophore model of some of its known ligands (11Garrigues A. Loiseau N. Delaforge M. Ferté J. Garrigos M. André F. Orlowski S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1288-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because binding of SUR ligands has also been linked to some particular residues (12Moreau C. Jacquet H. Prost A.L. D'hahan N. Vivaudou M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6644-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 13Ashfield R. Gribble F.M. Ashcroft S.J. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), it is of interest to compare the ligand recognition features of these two ABC proteins, with the aim of gaining new insights into both of them. In addition, regulation of several ABC transporters by KATP channel modulators has been reported; CFTR is inhibited by glibenclamide and less potently by a few other KATP channel blockers and openers (14Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. J Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 573-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Glibenclamide also inhibits MRP1 (15Payen L. Delugin L. Courtois A. Trinquart Y. Guillouzo A. Fardel O. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and P-gp (16Golstein P.E. Boom A. van Geffel J. Jacobs P. Masereel B. Beauwens R. Pflugers. Arch. 1999; 437: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and it appears to be a substrate of the latter. These observations are of interest because they can complete the pharmacological toolbox of researchers (glibenclamide is now the most widely used blocker of CFTR channels), and they can point to potential side effects and altered biodisposition. This is specially important for P-gp, which is an essential gatekeeper at the blood-brain barrier as well as in cancer cells (17Fromm M.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 18Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 361-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). In this work, we have therefore focused on P-gp and examined whether representative compounds among KATP channel blockers and openers could interact with P-gp. As blockers, we used glibenclamide, as a reference, and its two moieties, tolbutamide and meglitinide; as openers, we used diazoxide, SR47063, a derivative of cromakalim, and P1075, a derivative of pinacidil. Our findings demonstrate that these molecules bind to and are possibly transported by P-gp. They imply a possible structural similarity between SUR and P-gp, which could extend to a mechanistic similarity, in line with our recent work (12Moreau C. Jacquet H. Prost A.L. D'hahan N. Vivaudou M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6644-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Bienengraeber M. Alekseev A.E. Abraham M.R. Carrasco A.J. Moreau C. Vivaudou M. Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1943-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) suggesting that KATP channel openers and blockers interact with SUR much like transport substrates would, although intrinsic active transport by SUR has not yet been demonstrated. In an effort to rationalize the observed data and in the absence of high resolution crystallographic data, we built new homology models of human P-gp and SUR, based on multiple alignments with the bacterial ABC transporters MsbA and Sav1866, whose structures have been solved by x-ray crystallography in different conformations (20Ward A. Reyes C.L. Yu J. Roth C.B. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19005-19010Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 21Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. Nature. 2006; 443: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), and on mouse P-gp, whose structure has been recently solved in one conformation (22Aller S.G. Yu J. Ward A. Weng Y. Chittaboina S. Zhuo R. Harrell P.M. Trinh Y.T. Zhang Q. Urbatsch I.L. Chang G. Science. 2009; 323: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). Highlighting the various residues known to be implicated in drug binding specificity helped to delineate different hot spots for drug binding in the P-gp and SUR structures. Their three-dimensional arrangement revealed two main binding domains for the drugs verapamil/SR47063 and for vinblastine/glibenclamide in P-gp and their counterpart for binding of SR47063 and of glibenclamide in SUR. In this work, we used structural models derived from comparative modeling because they offer the advantage, in contrast to crystallographic structures, of allowing interpretation of a huge amount of binding data and addressing the multispecific character of these ABC proteins. Homology modeling also allowed us to interpret the results in various protein conformations, in relation to the enzymatic turnover. The MDR cell line used, DC-3F/ADX, was selected from spontaneously transformed Chinese hamster lung fibroblast DC-3F on the basis of resistance to actinomycin D. This resistance is due to overexpression of the pgp1 gene. The DC-3F/ADX cells and DC-3F cells, their drug-sensitive parental counterparts, were cultured, harvested by scraping, and washed in PBS in the presence of antiproteases. The cells in suspension were then disrupted by sonication. The resulting centrifuged supernatant was layered on a sucrose cushion to isolate the total membrane vesicle fraction. Membrane protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method. In vesicles prepared from DC-3F/ADX, P-glycoprotein accounts for about 12–15% of total membrane proteins, whereas P-gp cannot be detected in the control vesicles prepared from the DC-3F cells (23Garrigos M. Belehradek Jr., J. Mir L.M. Orlowski S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1034-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed using DC-3F cells as a control and DC-3F/ADX cells as a P-gp test. Because SUR displays ATPase activity modulated by its ligands (19Bienengraeber M. Alekseev A.E. Abraham M.R. Carrasco A.J. Moreau C. Vivaudou M. Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1943-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), our results could be tainted by the unlikely presence of different amounts of SUR in DC-3F and DC-3F/ADX cells. The effect would be negligible, however, because the ATPase activity of SUR is >100-fold less than that of P-gp (24de Wet H. Fotinou C. Amad N. Dreger M. Ashcroft F.M. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 2654-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 25de Wet H. Mikhailov M.V. Fotinou C. Dreger M. Craig T.J. Vénien-Bryan C. Ashcroft F.M. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 3532-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Schwanstecher M. Sieverding C. Dörschner H. Gross I. Aguilar-Bryan L. Schwanstecher C. Bryan J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5529-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The experiments are based on the enzymatic determination of the ATPase activity of native membrane vesicles containing high amounts of P-glycoprotein, measured at 37 °C by using a standard coupled enzyme assay, comprising an ATP-regenerating system and continuous spectrophotometric detection of NADH absorbance at 340 nm, which allows the monitoring of NADH consumption in the reaction medium, which is stoichiometric to ADP production. The reaction medium contained 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgATP, supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml pyruvate kinase, 1 mm phosphoenol pyruvate, 0.1 mg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 0.5 mm NADH. ATPase activity was determined with about 20 μg/ml membrane proteins. The assay medium was supplemented with 10 mm sodium azide, 0.5 mm ouabain, and 1 mm EGTA, to inhibit the H+-ATPases, Na+/K+-ATPase, and Ca2+-ATPases, respectively. The residual ATPase activity measured in the presence of the specific inhibitors of these enzymes and in the absence of any added drug was essentially due to the basal activity of P-glycoprotein. MgATP concentration was kept throughout the experiments at the subsaturating level of 1 mm because we have previously reported that the Km value of P-gp for MgATP remains essentially unchanged and independent of transported substrates (23Garrigos M. Belehradek Jr., J. Mir L.M. Orlowski S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1034-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Orlowski S. Mir L.M. Belehradek Jr., J. Garrigos M. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 28Garrigos M. Mir L.M. Orlowski S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 664-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Shown error bars represent S.E. values, computed from measurements performed in 5–14 experiments using up to four distinct vesicle preparations. Model fitting to the ATPase activity values normalized to the basal values was done with Origin 5.0 software using a standard Hill equation, |f¯(Ligand)|=A0+Vmax⋅|Ligand|h/(|Ligand|h+K1/2h)(Eq. 1) where A0 is the basal activity in the absence of ligand, K½ is the concentration for half-maximal activation (or inhibition), and h (or −h) is the Hill coefficient. Although activity versus concentration curves often show an inhibition at the highest concentrations, we fitted these curves using only one high affinity specific binding site because (i) this inhibition may be due to a nonspecific membrane perturbation by amphiphilic drugs, rather than to a low affinity specific binding site, and (ii) curve fitting using a two-site binding model would require twice as many parameters as a single-site model, producing more uncertainty and no more qualitative information about the mutual relationships exhibited by the compounds tested. (See, for example, the parameters determined in Fig. 4 compared with those in supplemental Fig. S1, A and B, the two last fits depending on the level of the maximal inhibition expected (experimentally unattainable in the usable drug concentration range).) Overall, the single-site binding model yielded estimates of the apparent affinities of various P-gp substrates consistent with both the K½ values characterizing basal ATPase activity stimulation and the Ki values characterizing the inhibition of ATPase activity stimulated by reference P-gp substrates (11Garrigues A. Loiseau N. Delaforge M. Ferté J. Garrigos M. André F. Orlowski S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1288-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 27Orlowski S. Mir L.M. Belehradek Jr., J. Garrigos M.

To test a range of concentrations for a given compound, aliquots were sequentially added to the same optical cuvette under continuous stirring. Dilution effects were taken into account for the final ATPase activity calculations. Chemicals (from Sigma except where stated) and stock solution concentrations were as follows: diazoxide, 100 mm; glibenclamide, 100 mm; meglitinide (4-[2-(5-chloro-2-methoxybenzamido)ethyl]benzoic acid; Aventis (Frankfurt, Germany)), 100 mm; P1075 (N-cyano-N′-(1,1-dimethylpropyl)-N′-3-pyridylguanidine; Leo Pharmaceutical Products (Copenhagen, Denmark)), 150 mm; progesterone, 30 mm; SR47063 (4-(2-cyanimino-1,2-dihydro-1-pyridyl)-2,2-dimethyl-6-nitrochromene; Sanofi Recherche (Montpellier, France)), 150 mm; tolbutamide, 100 mm; verapamil, 150 mm; vinblastine, 100 mm. All stocks were prepared in DMSO except for progesterone, which was dissolved in ethanol. Compounds were added to the reaction medium directly from stock solutions or from dilutions either in DMSO or ethanol or in distilled water. The maximal amount of DMSO added was ∼2% for the last point of the dose-response measurements of the lowest affinity compounds. The effect of such concentrations of vehicle was assessed by testing increasing amounts of DMSO on control vesicles (with and without the non-P-gp ATPase inhibitors mentioned above) and on P-gp-containing/enriched vesicles (with and without the P-gp substrate verapamil) (data not shown). In all cases, DMSO, at the concentrations reached in our experiments, did not modify ATPase activity in any significant manner. At higher concentrations, the effects remained moderate because 6% DMSO augmented P-gp ATPase activity by 6% (n = 4). Absorbance spectra for all tested compounds (data not shown) revealed that only SR47063, which has an absorbance peak at 328 nm, absorbed significantly at our assay wavelength of 340 nm. The resulting interference decreased the signal/noise ratio at the highest SR47063 concentrations used but would not alter the slope of the signal, which is the parameter used to measure the ATPase rate. Amino acid sequences of 42 human and 2 bacterial, Sav1866 (accession number Q99T13) and MsbA (accession number A1A9J1), transmembrane ABC proteins were used for a phylogenetic reconstruction. The Protein Knowledgebase (UniProtKB; available on the World Wide Web) (30Bairoch A. Apweiler R. Wu C.H. Barker W.C. Boeckmann B. Ferro S. Gasteiger E. Huang H. Lopez R. Magrane M. Martin M.J.

Saier Jr., M.H. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were used to retrieve fasta files, Swiss-Prot accession codes, synonyms, and TCDB classification numbers (see supplemental Table S1). Because some ABC proteins are monomeric (full-size transporters) whereas others are dimeric (half-size transporters), and because some of them exhibit an additional N-terminal TMD0 domain, we used the “Conserved Domain Database” of NCBI (available on the World Wide Web) (32Marchler-Bauer A. Anderson J.B. DeWeese-Scott C. Fedorova N.D. Geer L.Y. He S. Hurwitz D.I. Jackson J.D. Jacobs A.R. Lanczycki C.J. Liebert C.A. Liu C. Madej T. Marchler G.H. Mazumder R. Nikolskaya A.N. Panchenko A.R.

This roughly corresponds to one monomer of the dimeric proteins (plus or minus a dozen residues), and amino acid sequences with a size of about 600–650 residues were selected for the phylogenetic study, thereby excluding the TMD0 sequences (supplemental Table S1). Multiple-amino acid sequence alignment was performed with DIALIGN (33Morgenstern B. Dress A. Werner T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 12098-12103Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A maximum likelihood tree was constructed using PhyML (34Guindon S. Gascuel O. Syst. Biol. 2003; 52: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (14112) Google Scholar), and we made 100 bootstrap replicates (35Felsenstein J. Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Efron B. The Jackknife, the Bootstrap and Other Resampling Plans. Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Philadelphia, PA1982Crossref Google Scholar) to assess confidence in the results. Indeed, this statistic technique is used to improve the robustness of a constructed tree and to inform about its reliability. As a general rule, if the bootstrap value for a given branch is found to be higher than 90%, then the topology of that branch is considered as “correct.” The phylogenetic tree was edited using TreeViewX (available on the World Wide Web) (37Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar); in this representation, each branch length reflects a statistical distance between the considered sequence and its “common ancestor.” The alignment of SUR, P-gp, Sav1866, and MsbA, shown in supplemental Fig. S2, was edited using Jalview Software (38Clamp M. Cuff J. Searle S.M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 426-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). The secondary structures, derived from the three-dimensional model of P-gp, were added manually above the alignment. PSI-BLAST (39Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59413) Google Scholar) against the Protein Data Bank was used to select the templates for the homology modeling of P-gp and SUR1. This analysis confirmed that MsbA and Sav1866 have the closest sequences to these two mammalian ABC proteins. MsbA and Sav1866 share 28–31% identity with P-gp and 20–21% with SUR1 (see the legend to supplemental Fig. S2). After the withdrawal of the first crystallographic MsbA structures, the new structures deposited were proposed to represent three distinct putative functional conformations of this representative ABC transporter (20Ward A. Reyes C.L. Yu J. Roth C.B. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19005-19010Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), the open inward-facing, the closed inward-facing, and the outward-facing conformations. They were thus used as templates to rebuild three structural models for the human P-gp (see Table 1); the outward-facing conformation also used Sav1866 as a template, allowing a two-template homology modeling. The recent crystallographic structure of mouse P-gp allowed us to rebuild another model for the human P-gp in the open inward-facing conformation based on a single pairwise alignment (87% sequence identity between human and mouse P-gp). For SUR1, only the outward-facing conformation was built using a two-template reconstruction from both St-MsbA and Sav1866 (Table 1), hence giving a higher confidence than a monotemplate homology modeling.TABLE 1Reconstructed P-gp models and their corresponding templatesTemplates (PDB code)ResolutionModelsÅEc-MsbA (3B5W)5.3Pgp (open inward-facing conformation)Vc-MsbA (3B5X)5.5Pgp (closed inward-facing conformation)Sav1866 (2HYD)3.0Pgp (outward-facing conformation)St-MsbA (3B60)3.7Pgp (outward-facing conformation)Mouse Pgp (3G5U)3.8Pgp (open inward-facing conformation)Sav1866 (2HYD)3.0SUR1 (outward-facing conformation)St-MsbA (3B60)3.7SUR1 (outward-facing conformation) Open table in a new tab For each modeling procedure, 10 models were generated with the Modeler 9v6 software (40Sali A. Potterton L. Yuan F. van Vlijmen H. Karplus M. Proteins. 1995; 23: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar), with refinement settings “slow” and the “automodel” procedure. The templates, which were either the N- and C-terminal halves of the mouse P-gp structure or half-size bacterial transporters, do not contain the domain TMD0, the first intracellular loop and the linker region. Hence, these regions were excluded from modeling. A scoring program was applied to each generated model, and the best scored model among the 10 was selected. We have used a combination of the scoring programs available under Modeler, GA341 score and DOPE (Discrete Optimized Protein Energy) score. The stereochemical qualities of the models were checked using programs for analyzing and validating protein structures: Procheck (41Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R.

Proteins. 2008; 71: 261-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The three modeled P-gp conformations were placed in a “native-like” environment in order to analyze the interactions of the protein with model phospholipids arranged in a double layer membrane. We chose 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine because it is the most prominent lipid in mammalian cell membranes. The procedure included a first step of solvation, realized by the Solvate program (available on the World Wide Web), and then successive steps allowed by the VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) software (46Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (37444) Google Scholar), using the “solvation box” and the “membrane builder” procedures. The structures of glibenclamide and SR47063 were minimized and aligned under SYBYL (Tripos, St. Louis, MO) with the structures of vinblastine and verapamil, respectively, using procedures and data from Garrigues et al. (11Garrigues A. Loiseau N. Delaforge M. Ferté J. Garrigos M. André F. Orlowski S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1288-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Hydrophobicity and hydrogen bond potential areas were calculated using the MOLCAD routine of SYBYL. The compounds were superimposed manually, and consensus groups were selected. The compounds were then aligned using the multifit command of SYBYL. Throughout this work, the ATPase activity of P-gp-enriched vesicles was used as a reporter of the function of native P-gp. This assay has been validated thoroughly in earlier works (11Garrigues A. Loiseau N. Delaforge M. Ferté J. Garrigos M. André F. Orlowski S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1288-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 28Garrigos M. Mir L.M. Orlowski S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 664-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To further ascertain its suitability in our experimental settings, tests were performed using the P-gp substrates verapamil, progesterone, and vinblastine (Fig. 1A and Table 2). Our results are fully consistent, qualitatively and quantitatively, with the expected effects of these substrates on P-gp ATPase activity (28Garrigos M. Mir L.M. Orlowski S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 664-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Verapamil and progesterone increased ATPase activity, with a K½ of 1.3 and 17 μm, respectively, with no obvious cooperativity (Hill coefficients nearing 1). This activation declined at higher concentrations, a phenomenon that could be consistent with the presence of both high and low affinity sites as well as wi"
https://openalex.org/W2021469995,"5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) is the essential enzyme for the biosynthesis of leukotrienes, important mediators of inflammation. This study investigated whether variants of 5-LO exist in human leukocytes. 5-LO mRNA isoforms that are consistent with alternative splicing were identified by RT-PCR in a cell line or cell type-specific pattern. All evaluated cells expressed mRNA containing all 14 exons of 5-LO with the expected splicing sites. Individual isoforms that retained intron 10 (α-10), lacked exon 13 (Δ-13), and lacked exons 10 and 13 (Δ-10,13) or that lacked the first 96 base pairs of exon 10 (Δ-p10) were identified. Immunoreactive bands coeluting with the cloned α-10 and Δ-13 isoforms were measured in primary neutrophils and in Raji cells. When expressed in HEK293 cells, alternative proteins were without catalytic activity. However, when coexpressed with the active full-length 5-LO, alternative isoforms significantly decreased the biosynthesis of 5-LO products by up to 44%, as assessed by reverse-phase HPLC analysis. Additionally, in stimulated neutrophils the full-length active 5-LO was detected by immunoblot in both nuclear and non-nuclear compartments, while the Δ-13 isoform was only detected in the nuclear fraction. These alternative 5-LO isoforms may represent a new mechanism for the regulation of the 5-LO pathway and lipid mediator biosynthesis.—Boudreau, L. H., Bertin, J., Robichaud, P.

Due to the relative simplicity of complex II substrates and their similarity to other biologically abundant small molecules, substrate specificity presents a challenge in this system. In order to identify determinants for on-pathway catalysis, off-pathway catalysis, and enzyme inhibition, crystal structures of Escherichia coli menaquinol:fumarate reductase (QFR), a complex II superfamily member, were determined bound to the substrate, fumarate, and the inhibitors oxaloacetate, glutarate, and 3-nitropropionate. Optical difference spectroscopy and computational modeling support a model where QFR twists the dicarboxylate, activating it for catalysis.

Off-pathway catalysis, such as the conversion of malate to oxaloacetate or the activation of the toxin 3-nitropropionate may occur when inhibitors bind with a similarly activated bond in the same position. Conversely, inhibitors that do not orient an activatable bond in this manner, such as glutarate and citrate, are excluded from catalysis and act as inhibitors of substrate binding. These results support a model where electronic interactions via geometric constraint and orbital steering underlie catalysis by QFR.

Complex II superfamily enzymes provide a crucial link between oxidoreduction reactions in the membrane bilayer and in the soluble milieu (1Cecchini G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 77-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). During aerobic respiration in Escherichia coli, the complex II enzyme succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase oxidizes succinate and reduces ubiquinone. In bacterial anaerobic respiration with fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor, the reaction proceeds in the opposite direction, and the complex II homolog menaquinol:fumarate oxidoreductase (QFR) 4The abbreviations used are: QFRquinol:fumarate reductase3-NP3-nitropropionateBistris propane1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propanePDBProtein Data BankTLStranslation-liberation-screw. oxidizes menaquinol and transfers the electrons to fumarate. Complex II superfamily members contain either three or four polypeptide chains (Fig. 1A): two soluble subunits (the flavoprotein, FrdA, and the iron protein, FrdB, in E. coli QFR) and either one or two integral membrane subunits (FrdC and FrdD in the E. coli QFR). Although there are significant differences in the integral membrane subunits across the family, complex II enzymes all share a high percentage of sequence identity in the soluble subunits, including the flavoprotein, where the kinetically challenging oxidoreduction of fumarate and succinate takes place (1Cecchini G. Annu. Rev.

Numerous molecules, including metabolic intermediates and ingested toxins, structurally resemble succinate and fumarate. Some of these are excluded from the active site, whereas others act as inhibitors (Fig. 1B). Several of these come from normal respiratory processes. For example, oxaloacetate is a Krebs cycle intermediate and acts as a tight, slow binding inhibitor of complex II, possibly as a regulatory mechanism (2Ackrell B.A. Kearney E.B. Mayr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2021-2027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ackrell B.A. Cochran B. Cecchini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It has additionally been proposed that oxaloacetate can be formed through off-pathway catalysis by complex II when fumarate hydration to malate is followed by oxidation to oxaloacetate (3Ackrell B.A. Cochran B. Cecchini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4Belikova Y.O. Kotlyar A.B. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Oxaloacetate binding to the complex II active site results in a charge transfer complex between the oxaloacetate carbonyl and the FAD hydride that can be monitored spectroscopically (4Belikova Y.O. Kotlyar A.B. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 5Huang L.S. Shen J.T. Wang A.C. Berry E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Along with physiological regulation from metabolites, complex II activity may be affected by overproduction of dicarboxylates that result from dysfunction of cellular catabolic pathways. For example, mutation of glutaryl-CoA decarboxylase can lead to elevated levels of the dicarboxylates glutarate and 3-hydroxyglutarate (Fig. 1B), and this has been associated with glutaric acidemia type I, which has symptoms that include cerebral swelling and motor defects (6Kölker S. Koeller D.M. Sauer S. Hörster F. Schwab M.A. Hoffmann G.F. Ullrich K. Okun J.G. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2004; 27: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Respiratory chain deficiency correlates with glutaric acidemia type I, and complex II inhibition is observed in cell culture upon application of glutarate (7Ullrich K. Flott-Rahmel B. Schluff P.

Ingested toxins offer a third source of complex II inhibitors, often with severe health consequences. The fungus Arthrinium sphaerospermum produces the secondary metabolite 3-nitropropionate (3-NP), an irreversible complex II inhibitor (Fig. 1B) (8Alston T.A. Mela L. Bright H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1977; 74: 3767-3771Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 9Bush M.T. Touster O. Brockman J.E. J. Biol.

When ingested, 3-NP can induce striatal brain lesions similar to those observed in patients with Huntington disease, an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by dyskinesia, cognitive defects, and psychological pathologies (11Beal M.F. Brouillet E. Jenkins B.G. Ferrante R.J. Kowall N.W. Miller J.M. Storey E. Srivastava R. Rosen B.R. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4181-4192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, 3-NP is commonly used to recapitulate a subset of the pathologies of Huntington disease in animal models (11Beal M.F. Brouillet E. Jenkins B.G. Ferrante R.J. Kowall N.W. Miller J.M. Storey E. Srivastava R. Rosen B.R. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4181-4192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of 3-NP inhibition of complex II is under debate. Previously, 3-NP has been proposed to form a covalent adduct with either FAD (8Alston T.A. Mela L. Bright H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1977; 74: 3767-3771Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), an active site cysteine residue (12Coles C.J. Edmondson D.E. Singer T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5161-5167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or a catalytic arginine near the dicarboxylate binding site (13Huang L.S. Sun G. Cobessi D. Wang A.C. Shen J.T. Tung E.Y. Anderson V.E. Berry E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5965-5972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The formation of any of these adducts probably requires a single enzyme turnover but has not been determined conclusively (12Coles C.J. Edmondson D.E. Singer T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5161-5167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3-NP has also been proposed to act as a non-covalent inhibitor of complex II enzymes (14Sun F. Huo X. Zhai Y. Wang A. Xu J. Su D. Bartlam M. Rao Z. Cell. 2005; 121: 1043-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). To study the details of complex II catalysis and inhibition at the flavoprotein active site, the E. coli QFR was co-crystallized with the substrate, fumarate, and the inhibitors, oxaloacetate, glutarate, and 3-NP. Mass spectrometry and optical spectroscopy allowed unambiguous confirmation of the covalent 3-NP adduct and the proposal of a possible reaction mechanism. The implications for fumarate turnover and the mechanisms of inhibition are discussed. E. coli QFR was produced in E. coli strain DW35 (ΔfrdABCD, sdhC:kan) containing the pH3 (frdA+B+C+D+) plasmid. Cells were grown under microaerophilic conditions in Terrific Broth medium as described previously (15Luna-Chavez C. Iverson T.M. Rees D.C. Cecchini G. Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 19: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Membranes were isolated as described (15Luna-Chavez C. Iverson T.M. Rees D.C. Cecchini G. Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 19: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and were resuspended in a solution of 20 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) and solubilized with C12E9 detergent (Anatrace, Maumee, OH) added to a final concentration of 2% (w/v). Purification of QFR was performed in the presence of 0.05% (w/v) C12E9 as described (15Luna-Chavez C. Iverson T.M. Rees D.C. Cecchini G. Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 19: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), using Q-Sepharose anion exchange (GE Healthcare), POROS anion exchange (Applied Biosystems), and size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex S-200 column (GE Healthcare). In order to measure full succino-quinone reductase or succino-oxidase activity of QFR, it is necessary to remove any tightly bound oxaloacetate, which co-purifies with the as-isolated enzyme (3Ackrell B.A. Cochran B. Cecchini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To activate the enzyme, QFR was diluted to 5 mg of protein/ml in 30 mm Bistris propane, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% C12E9, and 3 mm malonate and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The enzyme was then concentrated with a Centricon YM30 filtration apparatus, and the concentrated protein was passed through a PD-10 gel filtration column to remove malonate. Activated enzyme was then stored at 4 °C until used. The standard assay medium at 30 °C contained 50 mm Bistris propane, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.006% C12E9, pH 8.0. Succino-oxidase activity of QFR was measured with the electron acceptor potassium ferricyanide as described previously (16Maklashina E. Hellwig P. Rothery R.A. Kotlyar V. Sher Y. Weiner J.H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26655-26664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In order to determine apparent affinity constants for the dicarboxylates used in this study, inhibition of the ferricyanide reductase activity was determined as previously described (17Maklashina E. Iverson T.M. Sher Y. Kotlyar V. Andréll J. Mirza O. Hudson J.M. Armstrong F.A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Cecchini G. J. Biol.

Optical properties of all of the bound ligands were measured with an Agilent 8453 diode array UV-visible spectrophotometer 1 min after the addition to isolated enzyme in 30 mm Bistris propane, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Anapoe C12E9. Optical spectra were recorded at 25 °C in 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Thesit using 1.25 mg/ml isolated and activated E. coli QFR. Upon the addition of the ligand, a spectrum was recorded, and the spectrum of oxidized enzyme was subtracted. Each spectrum represents the addition of the different ligands at the concentration of, 5 mm fumarate, 50 μm oxaloacetate, 4 mm malonate 12 mm glutarate, 50 mm citrate, and 0.1 mm 3-NP, which was added from an alkaline solution. The spectra were recorded 10 min after the addition of the ligand. Inhibition of the enzyme by 3-NP was determined as described by adding a final concentration of 0.2 mm 3-NP from a pH 10.0 solution to activated QFR (pH 8.0) and measuring kinetic and optical properties at pH 8.0. QFR at (10 mg/ml) in 20 mm glycine, pH 10.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% C12E9 was incubated with 1 mm 3-NP for 1 h on ice in a buffer consisting of 20 mm glycine, pH 10.0, and 0.05% (w/v) C12E9 detergent and was incubated on ice for 1 h. The QFR subunits were separated on a NuPAGE SDS gel (Invitrogen). The 66-kDa FrdA subunit was manually excised and digested with trypsin for 2 h at 37 °C. The resulting peptide mixture was separated with a microcapillary HPLC system (Eksigent 1D Plus with an AS1 autosampler) using an 11 cm × 100-μm C18 reversed phase column (Jupiter C18, 5 μm; Phenomonex) packed directly into a nanospray emitter tip. Using a nanospray source, this was interfaced with either a nominal mass resolution LTQ or high resolution LTQ orbitrap (Thermo Fisher) mass spectrometer, where data-dependent tandem (MS/MS) and MSn spectra were collected throughout a 90-min separation. These spectra were searched against an E. coli protein data base considering potential amino acid mass differentials corresponding to 3-NP adducts using SEQUEST (Thermo Electron) (18Yates 3rd, J.R. Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Schieltz D. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 1426-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Subsequent injections targeting potentially modified peptides were also performed; this included the targeting of normal and stable isotope-labeled 3-NP adducts, using the LTQ orbitrap. Later, it was determined that adduct formation could occur at physiological pH. As a result, the analysis of 15N-labeled 3-NP adduct was performed with a modified preincubation procedure, where 10 mg/ml QFR was incubated with 1 mm 15N-labeled 3-NP in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% C12E9. 3-Bromopropionic acid (250 mg, 1.63 mmol), Na15NO2 (206 mg, 2.94 mmol, 98% 15N), phloroglucinol (227 mg, 1.80 mmol), and DMF (3.3 ml) were added to a flame-dried round bottom flask. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 22 h and then poured onto ice water and extracted with diethyl ether. The combined organic layers were dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated. A portion of the residue was sublimed (80 °C, 1 Torr) to yield 16 mg of the yellow crystalline product. Label incorporation, sample purity, and confirmation of structure were determined by NMR: 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 4.66 (td, J = 6.0, 2.4 Hz, 2H), 3.06 (td, J = 6.4, 4.0 Hz, 2H); 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3) ppm 174.3, 69.3, 30.6; 15N NMR (60 MHz, CDCl3) ppm 379.5. All crystallizations of QFR used the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 22 °C, and crystallization conditions modified from those previously described (19Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1961-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). QFR was co-crystallized with fumarate in 12.5% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, 85 mm MgCH3COO, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.8, 0.1% DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm fumarate. QFR was co-crystallized with oxaloacetate in 12% PEG 5000 monomethyl ether, 125 mm MgCH3COO, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.8, 0.1% DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm oxaloacetate. QFR was co-crystallized with glutarate in 14.5% PEG 8000, 125 mm MgCH3COO, 95 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.8, 0.1% DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm glutarate. For co-crystallization of QFR with 3-NP, prior to crystallization, QFR was incubated with a 3-fold molar excess of 3-NP on ice for 1 h at pH 10.0. Crystals were grown in 10% PEG 5000 monomethyl ether, 250 mm MgCH3COO, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.8, 0.1% DTT, and 0.1 mm EDTA.

Because crystals were isomorphous with crystals from known structures of QFR, rigid body refinement was performed with CNS (23Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Iterative rounds of model rebuilding were performed in O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta. Crystallogr.

Omit maps, starting with segments of 50 amino acids in the initial stages of refinement and eventually progressing to 250 amino acid segments, were used extensively to minimize electron density map bias to the starting model. Refinement and map calculations were performed with Refmac5 (22Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr.

Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2006; 62: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) in all the structures. TLS refinement parameters were determined with the TLSMD server (29Painter J. Merritt E.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2006; 39: 109-111Crossref Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Figs. 1A and 2 were created in the program PyMOL. QFR co-structures with fumarate, glutarate, oxaloacetate, and citrate were prepared for modeling with Maestro (Schrödinger LLC) (30Friesner R.A. Murphy R.B. Repasky M.P. Frye L.L. Greenwood J.R. Halgren T.A. Sanschagrin P.C. Mainz D.T. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 6177-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (3921) Google Scholar) by creating a file with only the flavoprotein subunit, the iron protein subunit, and covalently linked FAD. Protons were added to the QFR structure with Maestro, and the resultant structure was minimized using the molecular mechanics force field, OPLS_2005. Ligands were prepared using the Ligprep module by adding explicit hydrogen atoms. These ligands were then reinserted into the active site of the minimized protein. The Glide XP subroutine in Maestro was used for ligand docking, and the free energy of binding was estimated with the extended precision scoring function (Glide XP) (30Friesner R.A. Murphy R.B. Repasky M.P. Frye L.L. Greenwood J.R. Halgren T.A. Sanschagrin P.C. Mainz D.T. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 6177-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (3921) Google Scholar). During this phase of the calculation, flexibility of the ligand was allowed, whereas the protein was held rigid. QFR activity can be inhibited both in vivo and in vitro by dicarboxylates or carboxynitro molecules structurally similar to fumarate (Fig. 1B). In this study, we investigate the determinants for binding and catalysis by identifying the interactions between QFR and the substrate fumarate or the inhibitors oxaloacetate, glutarate, and 3-nitropropionate. Co-crystallization of QFR with fumarate resulted in the appearance of clear electron density within the enzyme active site. This density is consistent with an alignment of the C2–C3 double bond parallel to the C(4a)–N5 bond of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD (31Lancaster C.R. Kröger A. Auer M. Michel H. Nature. 1999; 402: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Notably, a torsioned conformation of fumarate is observed (Fig. 2A), where the carboxylates are oriented 54° relative to one another, compared with the 0° orientation found in planar molecules. Torsion of fumarate is predicted to have a significant electronic effect, with the C2 carbon bearing the twisted carboxylate becoming a better hydride acceptor because electrons are better allowed to localize to the carbonyl (31Lancaster C.R. Kröger A. Auer M. Michel H. Nature. 1999; 402: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 32Leys D. Tsapin A.S. Nealson K.H. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Van Beeumen J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Hydride transfer thus presumably occurs between N5 of FAD and C2 of fumarate, and the distance between these atoms is 4 Å. Subsequent proton transfer is predicted to occur between the side chain of Arg-A287 and the C3 of fumarate. Of note, an ordered water molecule mediates the interaction between the C3 position of fumarate and the proton shuttle, Arg-A287. Seven putative hydrogen-bonding contacts stabilize fumarate in this torsioned conformation (Fig. 2A). The possibility of enzymatic turnover or photoreduction during data collection precludes positive identification of this dicarboxylate as fumarate with crystallography alone. To support the assignment of the ligand as fumarate (rather than citrate from the crystallization conditions or the product succinate), optical difference spectra were collected. The binding of fumarate to QFR results in the appearance of peaks at 390 and 500 nm in the FAD absorption spectrum (Fig. 3). The addition of QFR to the crystallization buffer induced optical changes that indicate replacement of oxaloacetate with citrate. Upon the addition of 5 mm fumarate, the concentration used during co-crystallization, a typical optical spectrum reflecting the replacement of citrate with fumarate was observed (data not shown). The structure of QFR in complex with oxaloacetate shows that this dicarboxylate inhibitor binds to QFR with a position similar to that of fumarate (Fig. 2B). In this binding mode, the C2–C3 bond is parallel to C(4a)–N5 of the FAD isoalloxazine ring, similar to the orientation of the C2–C3 double bond of fumarate in the co-structure of fumarate with QFR. In addition, the oxaloacetate carbonyl is positioned laterally, such that C2=O carbonyl is nearly parallel with the adjacent N5–C(5a) bond. This structural feature possibly underlies the charge transfer interaction, which results in the formation of a broad peak in the optical spectrum centered at 550 nm (Fig. 3). Interestingly, although the apparent affinity of oxaloacetate to QFR is much greater than that of fumarate, only three putative hydrogen bonds stabilize oxaloacetate in this binding position (Fig. 2B). This suggests that the charge transfer interaction makes a major contribution to binding affinity. Differences in inhibition between succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase and QFR have mechanistic implications because each of these enzymes optimally catalyzes the reaction in one direction. As a result, we tested the effects of 3-NP addition on both wild-type QFR and the FrdA E49Q variant of QFR, which has previously been shown to have altered catalytic efficiency for fumarate reduction and succinate oxidation (17Maklashina E. Iverson T.M. Sher Y. Kotlyar V. Andréll J. Mirza O. Hudson J.M. Armstrong F.A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11357-11365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Crystals of the FrdA E49Q variant of QFR in complex with 3-NP exhibited superior diffraction as compared with crystals of wild-type QFR in complex with 3-NP. As a result, crystals of the mutant enzyme were used for all subsequent structural analyses. In the structure of 3-NP with the E49Q variant of QFR, electron density contiguous with Arg-A287 is evident, consistent with the formation of a covalent adduct between 3-NP and Arg-A287. This density is in the same location as the ordered solvent molecule observed in the co-structure between QFR and fumarate (Fig. 2A). Proposed adducts from the literature were used as starting models to interpret the active site density, including 3-NP as a non-covalent inhibitor (14Sun F. Huo X. Zhai Y. Wang A. Xu J. Su D. Bartlam M. Rao Z. Cell. 2005; 121: 1043-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), 3-NP forming an adduct to Arg-A287 (13Huang L.S. Sun G. Cobessi D. Wang A.C.

Chem. 1979; 254: 5161-5167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mixed states combining these possibilities. A 3-NP adduct to Arg-A287 modeled as a five-membered 2,4,5-triazole structure best explains the density (Fig. 2C), in close agreement with the crystal structure of avian complex II in complex with 3-NP (13Huang L.S.

Notably, the side chain of adducted Arg-A287 displays an extended conformation when compared with the position of Arg-A287 from citrate-bound QFR (PDB entry 2B76) (17Maklashina E. Iverson T.M. Sher Y. Kotlyar V. Andréll J. Mirza O. Hudson J.M. Armstrong F.A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Cecchini G. J. Biol.

An electrostatic contact between the terminal carboxylate of 3-NP and the N5 of FAD stabilizes the adduct. Further, the triazole ring makes putative hydrogen bond contacts to three side chains in the active site, with likely hydrogen-bonding contacts between the NH1 of the adduct and the Oϵ1 atom on Gln-A230, between the NH2 of the adduct and the Oϵ1 carbonyl atom on Glu-A245, and between the N13 of the adduct and the Nη2 of Arg-A390. Although the structure of the FrdA E49Q variant of QFR in complex with 3-NP demonstrates that the binding mode is distinctly different from that of fumarate, in"
https://openalex.org/W2134985774,"Bacteria employ a modified two-component system for chemotaxis, where the receptors form ternary complexes with CheA histidine kinases and CheW adaptor proteins. These complexes are arranged in semi-ordered arrays clustered predominantly at the cell poles. The prevailing models assume that these arrays are static and reorganize only locally in response to attractant binding. Recent studies have shown, however, that these structures may in fact be much more fluid. We investigated the localization of the chemotaxis signaling arrays in Bacillus subtilis using immunofluorescence and live cell fluorescence microscopy. We found that the receptors were localized in clusters at the poles in most cells. However, when the cells were exposed to attractant, the number exhibiting polar clusters was reduced roughly 2-fold, whereas the number exhibiting lateral clusters distinct from the poles increased significantly. These changes in receptor clustering were reversible as polar localization was reestablished in adapted cells. We also investigated the dynamic localization of CheV, a hybrid protein consisting of an N-terminal CheW-like adaptor domain and a C-terminal response regulator domain that is known to be phosphorylated by CheA, using immunofluorescence. Interestingly, we found that CheV was localized predominantly at lateral clusters in unstimulated cells. However, upon exposure to attractant, CheV was found to be predominantly localized to the cell poles. Moreover, changes in CheV localization are phosphorylation-dependent. Collectively, these results suggest that the chemotaxis signaling arrays in B. subtilis are dynamic structures and that feedback loops involving phosphorylation may regulate the positioning of individual proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2047349968,"Protein function depends on conformational flexibility and folding stability. Loose packing of hydrophobic cores is not infrequent in proteins, as the enhanced flexibility likely contributes to their biological function. Here, using experimental and computational approaches, we show that eukaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channels are characterized by loose packing of their extracellular domain β-sandwich cores, and that loose packing contributes to their ability to rapidly switch from closed to open channel states in the presence of ligand. Functional analyses of GABA(A) receptors show that increasing the β-core packing disrupted GABA-mediated currents, with impaired GABA efficacy and slowed GABA current activation and desensitization. We propose that loose packing of the hydrophobic β-core developed as an evolutionary strategy aimed to facilitate the allosteric mechanisms of eukaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W2118480554,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) play an integral role in protein synthesis, functioning to attach the correct amino acid with its cognate tRNA molecule. AaRSs are known to associate into higher-order multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complexes (MSC) involved in archaeal and eukaryotic translation, although the precise biological role remains largely unknown. To gain further insights into archaeal MSCs, possible protein-protein interactions with the atypical Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus seryl-tRNA synthetase (MtSerRS) were investigated. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed arginyl-tRNA synthetase (MtArgRS) as an interacting partner of MtSerRS. Surface plasmon resonance confirmed stable complex formation, with a dissociation constant (K(D)) of 250 nM. Formation of the MtSerRS·MtArgRS complex was further supported by the ability of GST-MtArgRS to co-purify MtSerRS and by coelution of the two enzymes during gel filtration chromatography. The MtSerRS·MtArgRS complex also contained tRNA(Arg), consistent with the existence of a stable ribonucleoprotein complex active in aminoacylation. Steady-state kinetic analyses revealed that addition of MtArgRS to MtSerRS led to an almost 4-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of serine attachment to tRNA, but had no effect on the activity of MtArgRS. Further, the most pronounced improvements in the aminoacylation activity of MtSerRS induced by MtArgRS were observed under conditions of elevated temperature and osmolarity. These data indicate that formation of a complex between MtSerRS and MtArgRS provides a means by which methanogenic archaea can optimize an early step in translation under a wide range of extreme environmental conditions."

IntroductionProtein phosphorylation is one of the most important processes for cellular regulation and signal transduction in eukaryotic cells. The enzymes responsible for catalyzing this reaction are protein kinases, which catalyze phosphate transfer reactions from ATP to serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues in target substrate and provide key mechanisms for control of cellular signaling processes (1Adams J.A. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2271-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The activities of many protein kinases are themselves regulated by phosphorylation (2Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Most protein kinases are activated through phosphorylation of amino acid residue(s) within the activation loop. This can be carried out by an upstream kinase as part of a signaling cascade, or a kinase can autophosphorylate its own activation loop by either an intramolecular (cis) or intermolecular (trans) mechanism (3Lochhead P.A. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: pe4Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Intramolecular autophosphorylation is a first-order reaction and can be described by the single exponential kinetic equation. In contrast, intermolecular autophosphorylation involves in a bimolecular autocatalytic event, and hence there are more variations in overall mechanisms. One important question for trans-autophosphorylation to address is what molecular mechanism might be involved in the initiation of autocatalytic reaction. Uncovering the answers would provide a better understanding of the regulation of a protein kinase and some important clues for development of specific kinase inhibitors that selectively block autoactivation of protein kinases (4Deacon S.W. Beeser A. Fukui J.A. Rennefahrt U.E. Myers C. Chernoff J. Peterson J.R. Chem. Biol. 2008; 15: 322-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 5Oliver A.W. Knapp S. Pearl L.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).There are three possible mechanisms through which an unphosphorylated kinase can be activated by trans-autophosphorylation of a critical residue in the activation loop. The first possibility is that the unphosphorylated kinase is completely inactive, and its activation is catalyzed by a small quantity of contamination, the phosphorylated active kinase in Reaction 1, E*+E→k+0E*+E*REACTION 1 where E and E* represent unphosphorylated and phosphorylated enzyme, respectively. In this case, phosphorylation by an upstream kinase is required to initiate kinase autoactivation. A second possible mechanism is one in which unphosphorylated kinase itself has inherent catalytic activity that slowly generates the phosphorylated kinase molecule by an intramolecular reaction, and once the activated kinase is formed, the activation is accelerated by the intermolecular reaction shown in Reaction Scheme 1. E→keE*E*+E→k+0E*+E*REACTION SCHEME 1The third limiting mechanism is an inter-initiation model in which unphosphorylated kinase molecule, which has residual activity catalyzes the initial phosphorylation in an intermolecular manner shown in Reaction Scheme 2. E+E→keE*+E*E*+E→k+0E*+E*REACTION SCHEME 2 A considerable ingenious procedure is therefore required to distinguish between these mechanisms on the basis of various lines of experimental evidence.The p21-activated protein kinase 2 (PAK2) 2The abbreviations used are: PAK2p21-activated kinase 2MESG7-methyl-6-thioguanosinePKpyruvate kinaseLDHlactate dehydrogenaseMLCtidesynthetic peptide, KKRPQRATSNVFAAbantibody. is a serine/threonine kinase regulated by the small GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac, and is involved in the regulation of various cytoskeletal functions, including cell motility and membrane blebbing during apoptosis (6Molli P.R.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). PAK2 consists of a C-terminal kinase domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain containing a GTPase binding domain (GBD) and an autoinhibitory domain (AID). PAK2 is activated by the binding of active Cdc42 and Rac to the GBD, resulting in a conformational change and a subsequent autophosphorylation on several serine and/or threonine residues. Upon activation, PAK2 from human is autophosphorylated at seven sites, six of which have been identified as serine residues in the N-terminal regulatory domain (10Gatti A. Huang Z. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8022-8028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The only phospho-threonine, pThr402, is in the C-terminal kinase domain, and the PAK2 activation was showed to coincide with the phosphorylation of this threonine residue (12Yu J.S. Chen W.J. Ni M.H. Chan W.H. Yang S.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although autophosphorylation of some N-terminal regulatory sites occurs in cis, phosphorylation of the activation loop threonine (Thr402) is an inter-molecular process (13Wu H. Wang Z.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41768-41778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of the activation loop is clearly a critical step in the activation of the PAK kinases, although how the first molecule of active PAK2 is formed remains obscure.In this study, we developed a new kinetic approach to distinguish effectively between cis- and trans-pathways in an autocatalytic reaction. The mechanism of the autophosphorylation reaction of PAK2 has been further examined using this approach. We demonstrated that the unphosphorylated PAK2 has an activity inherent in itself by which it can self-activate, and that autophosphorylation of Thr402 obeys a two-step mechanism of cis initiation, followed by trans amplification. That is, the unphosphorylated PAK2 undergoes an intramolecular autophosphorylation on Thr402 to produce the first fully activated PAK2, and this newly formed active PAK2 then phosphorylates other PAK2 molecules at Thr402 in an intermolecular manner. On the basis of the kinetic equation of the substrate reaction, all microscopic kinetic constants for the cis and trans autophosphorylation at Thr402 of PAK2 have been estimated quantitatively.DISCUSSIONThe autophosphorylation of the activation loop is a critical step in the activation of PAK2 kinase, but the molecular details of this process remain poorly understood. To further this understanding, we have undertaken a detailed kinetic study of PAK2 activation mechanism. Analyses of the time courses of substrate reaction during PAK2 autoactivation suggest that autophosphorylation of Thr402 in PAK2 obeys a two-step mechanism of cis initiation, followed by trans amplification, and binding of the exogenous substrate MLCtide at the active site of PAK2 completely abolish the PAK2 autophosphorylation at site Thr402. Compared with the conventional method of taking aliquots at time intervals during the activation process and assaying for the enzyme activity or modification extend, the advantage of the present method is not only its continuous nature and usefulness in the study of fast modification reactions, but its convenience in the study of substrate effects on modification reaction. This new method would be particularly useful when the regulatory mechanism of the reversible phosphorylation reaction toward certain enzymes is being assessed.Ligand-induced autophosphorylation of protein kinase is considered to be a trigger of intracellular signal transduction (2Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 3Lochhead P.A. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: pe4Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation can be achieved via two basic routes: intramolecular (in cis) and intermolecular (in trans) reactions. There is an abundance of structural data for protein kinases, which have provided insight into how the kinase transforms from an inactive state into an active state by trans-autophosphorylation. However, how a protein kinase autophosphorylates its activation loop in cis remains obscure. In the inactive state, the nonphosphorylated activation loop often folds back into the active site and sterically blocks substrate binding. This raises the question of how protein kinases that become self-activated by autophosphorylation of their activation loops in cis overcoming these steric constraints (3Lochhead P.A. Sci.

Most of the kinases that autophosphorylate their activation loops in cis require protein binding partners, which temporally regulates the conformation of protein kinases and promote their activation (25Lochhead P.A.

For example, autophosphorylation of the critical activation loop tyrosine of DYRK is intramolecular and mediated by the nascent kinase passing through a transitory intermediate form (27Lochhead P.A. Sibbet G. Morrice N. Cleghon V. Cell. 2005; 121: 925-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In contrast, GSK-3β is not activated during protein translation but requires the binding and activity of the molecular chaperone, heat shock protein 90 kDa (Hsp90), which mediates a cis autophosphorylation event in the activation loop of GSK-3β (at Tyr216) in response to growth factors (25Lochhead P.A.

Therefore, we propose that binding of Cdc42 to the N-terminal regulatory domain of PAK2 does more than just relieve inhibitory constraints imposed on the catalytic domain by the inhibitory switch, and may also provide an essential chaperone-like function that transiently coverts the intermediate form of PAK2 into an intramolecular kinase capable of autophosphorylating the activation loop threonine in the protein kinase domain. IntroductionProtein phosphorylation is one of the most important processes for cellular regulation and signal transduction in eukaryotic cells. The enzymes responsible for catalyzing this reaction are protein kinases, which catalyze phosphate transfer reactions from ATP to serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues in target substrate and provide key mechanisms for control of cellular signaling processes (1Adams J.A. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2271-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The activities of many protein kinases are themselves regulated by phosphorylation (2Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Most protein kinases are activated through phosphorylation of amino acid residue(s) within the activation loop. This can be carried out by an upstream kinase as part of a signaling cascade, or a kinase can autophosphorylate its own activation loop by either an intramolecular (cis) or intermolecular (trans) mechanism (3Lochhead P.A. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: pe4Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Intramolecular autophosphorylation is a first-order reaction and can be described by the single exponential kinetic equation. In contrast, intermolecular autophosphorylation involves in a bimolecular autocatalytic event, and hence there are more variations in overall mechanisms. One important question for trans-autophosphorylation to address is what molecular mechanism might be involved in the initiation of autocatalytic reaction. Uncovering the answers would provide a better understanding of the regulation of a protein kinase and some important clues for development of specific kinase inhibitors that selectively block autoactivation of protein kinases (4Deacon S.W.

The first possibility is that the unphosphorylated kinase is completely inactive, and its activation is catalyzed by a small quantity of contamination, the phosphorylated active kinase in Reaction 1, E*+E→k+0E*+E*REACTION 1 where E and E* represent unphosphorylated and phosphorylated enzyme, respectively. In this case, phosphorylation by an upstream kinase is required to initiate kinase autoactivation. A second possible mechanism is one in which unphosphorylated kinase itself has inherent catalytic activity that slowly generates the phosphorylated kinase molecule by an intramolecular reaction, and once the activated kinase is formed, the activation is accelerated by the intermolecular reaction shown in Reaction Scheme 1. E→keE*E*+E→k+0E*+E*REACTION SCHEME 1The third limiting mechanism is an inter-initiation model in which unphosphorylated kinase molecule, which has residual activity catalyzes the initial phosphorylation in an intermolecular manner shown in Reaction Scheme 2. E+E→keE*+E*E*+E→k+0E*+E*REACTION SCHEME 2 A considerable ingenious procedure is therefore required to distinguish between these mechanisms on the basis of various lines of experimental evidence.The p21-activated protein kinase 2 (PAK2) 2The abbreviations used are: PAK2p21-activated kinase 2MESG7-methyl-6-thioguanosinePKpyruvate kinaseLDHlactate dehydrogenaseMLCtidesynthetic peptide, KKRPQRATSNVFAAbantibody. is a serine/threonine kinase regulated by the small GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac, and is involved in the regulation of various cytoskeletal functions, including cell motility and membrane blebbing during apoptosis (6Molli P.R.

PAK2 consists of a C-terminal kinase domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain containing a GTPase binding domain (GBD) and an autoinhibitory domain (AID). PAK2 is activated by the binding of active Cdc42 and Rac to the GBD, resulting in a conformational change and a subsequent autophosphorylation on several serine and/or threonine residues. Upon activation, PAK2 from human is autophosphorylated at seven sites, six of which have been identified as serine residues in the N-terminal regulatory domain (10Gatti A. Huang Z. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8022-8028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

The only phospho-threonine, pThr402, is in the C-terminal kinase domain, and the PAK2 activation was showed to coincide with the phosphorylation of this threonine residue (12Yu J.S. Chen W.J. Ni M.H. Chan W.H. Yang S.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although autophosphorylation of some N-terminal regulatory sites occurs in cis, phosphorylation of the activation loop threonine (Thr402) is an inter-molecular process (13Wu H. Wang Z.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41768-41778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of the activation loop is clearly a critical step in the activation of the PAK kinases, although how the first molecule of active PAK2 is formed remains obscure.In this study, we developed a new kinetic approach to distinguish effectively between cis- and trans-pathways in an autocatalytic reaction. The mechanism of the autophosphorylation reaction of PAK2 has been further examined using this approach. We demonstrated that the unphosphorylated PAK2 has an activity inherent in itself by which it can self-activate, and that autophosphorylation of Thr402 obeys a two-step mechanism of cis initiation, followed by trans amplification. That is, the unphosphorylated PAK2 undergoes an intramolecular autophosphorylation on Thr402 to produce the first fully activated PAK2, and this newly formed active PAK2 then phosphorylates other PAK2 molecules at Thr402 in an intermolecular manner. On the basis of the kinetic equation of the substrate reaction, all microscopic kinetic constants for the cis and trans autophosphorylation at Thr402 of PAK2 have been estimated quantitatively.

Compared with the conventional method of taking aliquots at time intervals during the activation process and assaying for the enzyme activity or modification extend, the advantage of the present method is not only its continuous nature and usefulness in the study of fast modification reactions, but its convenience in the study of substrate effects on modification reaction. This new method would be particularly useful when the regulatory mechanism of the reversible phosphorylation reaction toward certain enzymes is being assessed.Ligand-induced autophosphorylation of protein kinase is considered to be a trigger of intracellular signal transduction (2Nolen B.

There is an abundance of structural data for protein kinases, which have provided insight into how the kinase transforms from an inactive state into an active state by trans-autophosphorylation. However, how a protein kinase autophosphorylates its activation loop in cis remains obscure. In the inactive state, the nonphosphorylated activation loop often folds back into the active site and sterically blocks substrate binding. This raises the question of how protein kinases that become self-activated by autophosphorylation of their activation loops in cis overcoming these steric constraints (3Lochhead P.A. Sci.
