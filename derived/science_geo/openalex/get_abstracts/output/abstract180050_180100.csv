However, little information is known regarding the scientific rationale for using probiotics as alternative medicine. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mechanisms of probiotic beneficial effects on intestinal cell homeostasis. We now report that one such probiotic,Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), prevents cytokine-induced apoptosis in two different intestinal epithelial cell models. Culture of LGG with either mouse or human colon cells activates the anti-apoptotic Akt/protein kinase B. This model probiotic also inhibits activation of the pro-apoptotic p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase by tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1α, or γ-interferon. Furthermore, products recovered from LGG culture broth supernatant show concentration-dependent activation of Akt and inhibition of cytokine-induced apoptosis. These observations suggest a novel mechanism of communication between probiotic microorganisms and epithelia that increases survival of intestinal cells normally found in an environment of pro-apoptotic cytokines.

Recent evidence clearly demonstrates that commensal bacteria regulate intestinal epithelial development and function (2Bry L. Falk P.G. Midtvedt T. Gordon J.I.

Probiotics, as described by Lilly and Stillwell (4Lilly D.M. Stillwell R.H. Science. 1965; 147: 747-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), are living microorganisms with low or no pathogenicity that exert beneficial effects on the health of the host. In human clinical trials the non-pathogenic Gram-positive commensalLactobacilli found in the human and mouse gastrointestinal tracts have been considered as probiotics with beneficial health effects, including enhanced lymphocyte proliferation (5Kirjavainen P.V., El- Nezami H.S.

It is effective in preventing and treating diarrhea (8Marteau P.R. de Vrese M. Cellier C.J. Schrezenmeir J. Am. J. Clin.

Therefore, manipulation of enteric microflora by selective living microorganisms termed probiotics are promoted by practitioners of alternative health measures. There is increasing evidence that probiotic Lactobacillusspecies play a role in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this disease, abnormal immune responses cause inflammation that appears to be stimulated by elements of the enteric microenviroment, including normal and pathogenic organisms (12Shanahan F. Science. 2000; 289: 1311-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Reduction of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria has been found in colonic biopsies of patients with IBD (13Fabia R. Ar'Rajab A.

Although conventional therapeutic strategies focus on suppression or modulation of host immunity, modification of enteric microflora by probiotics may have a role in treating IBD. Several Lactobacillus strains prevent or attenuate intestinal inflammation in the interleukin (IL)-10−/− mouse model, which spontaneously develops enterocolitis (15Madsen K.L. Doyle J.S. Jewell L.D.

Isolauri E. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2000; 30: 1804-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LGG has been suggested as adjunctive therapy for Crohn's disease (17Malin M. Suomalainen H. Saxelin M. Isolauri E. Ann. Nutr. Metab. 1996; 40: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Putative mechanisms of the action of probiotics include regulation of cytokine production (18Maassen C.B. van Holten-Neelen C. Balk F. den Bak-Glashouwer M.J. Leer R.J. Laman J.D. Boersma W.J. Claassen E. Vaccine. 2000; 18: 2613-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), such as stimulation of mononuclear cells to generate both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (19Miettinen M.

Gut. 1994; 35: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Yet almost nothing is known regarding the basic molecular mechanisms of probiotic regulation of intestinal epithelial health. Two common features of IBD involve increased cytokine production (26Breese E.J. Michie C.A. Nicholls S.W. Murch S.H. Williams C.B. Domizio P. Walker-Smith J.A. MacDonald T.T. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: 1455-1466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar,27Sartor R.B. Gastroenterol. Clin. N. Am. 1995; 24: 475-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and increased apoptosis of intestinal cells (28Iwamoto M. Koji T. Makiyama K. Kobayashi N. Nakane P.K. J. Pathol. 1996; 180: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We have reported that a central cytokine in the pathogenesis of IBD, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (27Sartor R.B. Gastroenterol. Clin. N. Am. 1995; 24: 475-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), regulates both anti- and pro-apoptotic signaling pathways, and the balance between these two kinds of signals determines the cell fate (29Yan F. John S.K. Polk D.B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8668-8675PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to investigate the effects of LGG on cytokine-regulated signaling pathways determining intestinal cell fate. We now report that LGG prevents cytokine-induced apoptosis in mouse or human intestinal epithelial cells. Culture of LGG with colon cells activates the anti-apoptotic Akt/protein kinase B. Further, this model probiotic inhibits activation of the pro-apoptotic p38/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase by TNF, IL-1α, or γ-interferon (IFN). Therefore, LGG promotes intestinal epithelial cell survival through regulation of both anti- and pro-apoptotic signal transduction pathways. These novel observations provide insight into the rationale for LGG as a potential treatment for IBD. LGG (American Type Culture Collection 53103) was incubated inLactobacillus MRS broth at 37 °C for 24 h, then diluted in MRS broth, and incubated at 37 °C to reach log phase with the density determined as 0.5 at A 600 (20Miettinen M. Vuopio-Varkila J. Varkila K. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 5403-5405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LGG was precipitated from MRS broth (1000 × g, 15 min) and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Heat-killed (hk) LGG was prepared by boiling LGG in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h and then washing it with phosphate-buffered saline. Lactobacillus acidophilus (American Type Culture Collection 393) andLactobacillus casei (American Type Culture Collection 4356) were cultured per ATCC guidelines. 107colony-forming units/ml LGG, L. casei, or L. acidophilus in RPMI cell culture medium were used to treat cells.Salmonella pullorum (provided by Andrew Neish, Emory University, Atlanta, GA) was prepared and incubated with cells as described (30Neish A.S. Gewirtz A.T. Zeng H. Young A.N. Hobert M.E. Karmali V. Rao A.S. Madara J.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Supernatant recovered from LGG culture broth (LGG-s) was generated by centrifuging (1000 × g, 15 min) and filtering (0.2 μm) LGG culture in MRS broth; then the filtrate was concentrated using Centricon Plus-20 (5–100 kDa, Millipore, Bedford, MA) by centrifugation (4000 × g, 1 h) following guidelines from the manufacturer. Protein concentrations were determined by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) using MRS broth as the control. LGG-conditioned cell culture medium (LGG-cm) was generated by incubating washed LGG (107 colony-forming units/ml) in RPMI cell culture medium at 37 °C for 2 h; the medium was centrifuged twice (1000 × g, 15 min) and then filtered (0.2 μm). Young adult mouse colon (YAMC) cells were grown in RPMI with 5% fetal bovine serum on collagen-coated culture dishes as described previously (31Kaiser G.C. Polk D.B. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Clonal cell lines stably expressing pFLAG-cDNA3-kinase-inactive (ki) kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) or pFLAG-cDNA3-wild-type KSR (provided by Richard Kolesnick, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY) were generated as described (32Yan F. Polk D.B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 963-969PubMed Google Scholar). The kiKSR plasmid expresses a kinase-inactive dominant-negative KSR as previously described (32Yan F. Polk D.B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 963-969PubMed Google Scholar, 33Zhang Y. Yao B. Delikat S. Bayuomy S. Lin X. Basu S. McGinley M. Chan-Hui P. Lichenstein H. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1997; 89: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Clonal cells were cultured in the presence of G418 (100 μg/ml) until 24 h prior to the experiments. The human colonic epithelial carcinoma cell line, HT 29 cells, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were serum-starved (0.5%) at 37 °C for 24 h before experiments. Lysates were prepared from cells treated with murine TNF, IL-1α, or γ-IFN (Pepro Tech, Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ) for the indicated times in the presence or absence of LGG, LGG-s, LGG-cm, hk-LGG, phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin (Sigma) or LY294002 or p38 inhibitors (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) SB203580 or SB202190. Cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into cell lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mmorthovandate, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate with leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (18 μg/ml), and 1% Triton X-100). The scraped suspensions were centrifuged (14,000 ×g, 10 min) at 4 °C, and protein content was determined using DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of cellular lysate protein were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-Akt, anti-Akt, anti-phospho-p38, anti-p38, anti-IκBα, anti-phospho stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK), anti-SAPK/JNK (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), or anti-phospho extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/ERK2/MAP kinase (Promega, Madison, WI) antibodies. YAMC and clonal cell lines were cultured on collagen-coated or HT29 cells on non-coated chamber glass slides and were prepared as described above. Following treatment, apoptotic cells were labeled by ApopTag in situ apoptosis detection kits (Intergen, Purchase, NY) using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase for detection of positive cells following guidelines from the manufacturer. Apoptotic cells were labeled by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-digoxigenin or anti-digoxigenin peroxidase conjugate and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as substrate and were then dehydrated and mounted using Vectashield mounting medium. Slides were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) by using 1 μg/ml DAPI in mounting medium. The cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy or differential interference contrast. Apoptotic terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling (TUNEL) positive cells were determined by counting at least 200 cells in randomly chosen fields and expressing them as a percentage of the total number of cells counted. Caspase activity was detected in living cells using the sulforhodamine multi-caspase activity kit (Biomol) following guidelines from the manufacturer. Active caspase enzyme in living cells was labeled with cell-permeable sulforhodamine-conjugated valylalanylaspartic acid fluoromethyl ketone, an inhibitor of caspase activity that binds to active caspase enzyme. Cells with increased caspase activity were detected by fluorescence microscopy. Pathological concentrations of TNF inhibit intestinal cell proliferation without inducing apoptosis in YAMC cells (29Yan F. John S.K. Polk D.B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8668-8675PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kaiser G.C. Polk D.B. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because dominant-negative kiKSR expression induces apoptosis in TNF-treated intestinal cells (29Yan F. John S.K. Polk D.B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8668-8675PubMed Google Scholar), we used kiKSR-expressing colon cells to test our hypothesis that probiotics prevent TNF-induced apoptosis through regulation of signal transduction pathways. We found that TNF-stimulated apoptosis detected by TUNEL staining in kiKSR-expressing YAMC cells was inhibited by co-culture with viable LGG but was not hkLGG (Fig. 1, A andB). Furthermore, in a model of human intestinal cell apoptosis the effect of a “cytokine mixture” combination of TNF, IL-1α, and γ-IFN is reversed by LGG (Fig. 1 D). DAPI staining shows nuclear condensation of the TUNEL-positive intestinal cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 1 A). To further demonstrate that the observed LGG effect is caused by the inhibition of apoptosis, we used a multi-caspase activity assay in living cells. The increased caspase activity of cells undergoing apoptosis is blocked by viable LGG (Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, cell survival is also enhanced by LGG-s, and this inhibitory effect on apoptosis is concentration-dependent (Fig. 1, A–D). The balance between anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic signal transduction pathways regulates the fate of cells exposed to various stimuli including TNF. Therefore, we studied the effects of LGG on signal transduction pathways that regulate cell fate. LGG or LGG-cm, but not heat-killed LGG, stimulates anti-apoptotic Akt activation determined by antibody against Ser(P)-473-Akt (Fig. 2 A). Akt activation is also enhanced by LGG-s in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2, B and C). This activation by either LGG or TNF is blocked by the PI 3-kinase inhibitors, LY294002 or wortmannin, but not by the MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059 (Fig. 2 D). Whereas kiKSR expression inhibits TNF activation of Akt, both LGG and LGG-cm stimulate Akt phosphorylation in these cells (Fig. 2 E), indicating that TNF and LGG utilize different mechanisms to activate PI 3-kinase upstream of Akt. Nuclear factor (NF) κB and ERK/MAP kinase activation are important TNF-activated antiapoptotic signal transduction pathways in intestinal cells (29Yan F. John S.K. Polk D.B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8668-8675PubMed Google Scholar). TNF stimulates both degradation of the inhibitor of κB and activation of ERK1/ERK2. However, LGG does not effect activation of either of these anti-apoptotic molecules (Fig. 2 F), which indicates that LGG inhibition of TNF-induced apoptosis is not caused by the disruption of TNF receptor binding activities. By using an antibody to phospho-p38 we determined that viable LGG inhibits TNF-induced activation of this pro-apoptotic MAP kinase (Fig. 3, A–C). Unlike Akt activation, inhibition of p38 is not reproduced by factors present in LGG-cm (Fig. 3, A and B). The cytokine-activated pro-apoptotic SAPK/JNK activities are not affected by LGG (Fig. 3 D). Collectively these data indicate that LGG promotes survival of intestinal epithelial cells exposed to inflammatory cytokines through activation of specific anti-apoptotic and inhibition of pro-apoptotic signals. These findings raise an important question. Is this anti-apoptotic response unique to LGG, or is it common to other probiotic commensal or non-pathogenic intestinal microflora? To address this question we studied the effects of two other Gram-positive strains of Lactobacillus, L. acidophilus and L. casei, known to enhance lymphocyte proliferation and immunity (5Kirjavainen P.V., El- Nezami H.S. Salminen S.J. Ahokas J.T. Wright P.F. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1999; 26: 131-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,6Gill H.S. Rutherfurd K.J. Prasad J. Gopal P.K. Br. J. Nutr. 2000; 83: 167-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or macrophage activation (34Perdigon G. de Macias M.E. Alvarez S. Oliver G. de Ruiz Holgado A.A. Infect. Immun. 1986; 53: 404-410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Whereas these two bacteria stimulate Akt activation, they show no inhibition of TNF-stimulated p38 (Fig. 4 A). Accordingly, their inhibitory effect on TNF-induced apoptosis is significantly reduced compared with LGG (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, we studied two Gram-negative bacteria derived from colon flora isolates, Salmonella typhimuriumPhoPc and S. pullorum, that have been shown to regulate TNF-stimulated signal transduction pathways in intestinal cells (30Neish A.S. Gewirtz A.T. Zeng H. Young A.N. Hobert M.E. Karmali V. Rao A.S. Madara J.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Neither of these attenuate TNF-induced apoptosis in colon cells (Fig. 4, C and D). Therefore, reversal of cytokine-induced apoptosis by LGG does not extend to all commensal or non-pathogenic intestinal microflora. This evidence suggests that a need for caution in selecting “probiotics” for clinical study is warranted and may explain variability in results of clinical trials investigating different probiotics. To determine the relative importance of Akt activation and inhibition of p38 activity in regulating the fate of intestinal cells exposed to TNF, we used pharmacological inhibitors. A blockade of Akt activation by PI 3-kinase inhibitors (as shown in Fig. 2 D) increases apoptosis in YAMC cells treated with TNF (Fig. 5, A and B), whereas inhibitors of p38 block apoptosis in TNF-treated kiKSR-expressing cells (Fig. 5, C and D). As expected, both p38 inhibitors reduce p38 activation at concentrations that were studied (Fig. 5 E). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of Akt and inhibition of p38 by LGG are central to its anti-apoptotic effect. The lumen of the gastrointestinal tract has evolved with a complex ecosystem that includes commensal and pathogenic bacteria with the capability of cross-species communication (3Hooper L.V. Wong M.H. Thelin A. Hansson L. Falk P.G. Gordon J.I. Science. 2001; 291: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar, 35Tieng V., Le Bouguenec C. du Merle L. Bertheau P. Desreumaux P. Janin A. Charron D. Toubert A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2977-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Lilly and Stillwell (4Lilly D.M. Stillwell R.H. Science. 1965; 147: 747-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) described microbes that had potential benefit to their hosts as probiotics. We have studied the relationships betweenLactobacillus GG, as a model probiotic, and the intestinal epithelial cell, the point of first contact with the host. Our novel findings demonstrate that LGG promotes the survival of intestinal epithelial cells through the activation of the anti-apoptotic Akt/protein kinase B and inhibition of the pro-apoptotic p38 MAP kinase. LGG produces a factor that activates Akt independent of bacterial cellular interaction. It is possible that other commensal organisms with potential probiotic activity (6Gill H.S. Rutherfurd K.J. Prasad J. Gopal P.K. Br. J. Nutr. 2000; 83: 167-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Neish A.S. Gewirtz A.T. Zeng H. Young A.N. Hobert M.E. Karmali V. Rao A.S. Madara J.L.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) could prevent cytokine-induced apoptosis. Although some of those we tested reduced apoptosis, none were as effective as LGG, and LGG appeared unique in its ability to block p38 MAP kinase activation. These findings extend our understanding of the complexity of the host commensal relationship and suggest that intestinal cell survival in its cytokine-rich environment may be regulated by the presence of beneficial microbes. This effect appears to require live bacteria, because either heat treatment (Figs. 2 and 3) or glutaraldehyde fixation (data not shown) prevents LGG regulation of Akt or p38 MAP kinase. The mechanisms by which intestinal bacteria modulate the inflammatory process are complex and incompletely understood. Probiotic bacteria interact with three components of the gastrointestinal tract including intestinal epithelial cells, luminal flora, and the mucosal immune cells. It is known that probiotic bacteria can regulate lymphocyte cytokine production (18Maassen C.B. van Holten-Neelen C. Balk F. den Bak-Glashouwer M.J. Leer R.J. Laman J.D. Boersma W.J. Claassen E.

Nonpathogenic Salmonellaspecies can regulate the immune response by blocking NFκB activation and IL-8 production (30Neish A.S. Gewirtz A.T. Zeng H. Young A.N. Hobert M.E. Karmali V. Rao A.S. Madara J.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). However, these Salmonella species do not alter apoptotic response to cytokine (Fig. 4, B andC), nor does LGG inhibit NFκB activation (data not shown). We did not detect NFκB activation by either inhibitor of κB degradation (Fig. 2 F) or NFκB p65 subunit nuclear translocation up to 6 h after LGG treatment (data not shown). Although we did not specifically study IL-8 secretion in our cells, it is increased in CaCo2 cells treated with Lactobacillus (38Haller D. Bode C. Hammes W.P. Pfeifer A.M. Schiffrin E.J. Blum S. Gut. 2000; 47: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). A commensal Bifidobacterium strain regulates intestinal cell gene expression (3Hooper L.V. Wong M.H. Thelin A. Hansson L. Falk P.G. Gordon J.I. Science. 2001; 291: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar) and promotes its own survival within the host (2Bry L. Falk P.G. Midtvedt T. Gordon J.I. Science. 1996; 273: 1380-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Clearly, the mechanisms of activating intestinal cell signal transduction pathways by commensal bacteria are relevant to the maintenance of this important physical and functional mucosal barrier. Our current understanding of cell survival suggests that the balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals generated by cytokines regulates apoptosis (39Budd R.C. J. Clin.

By contrast, other members of the MAP kinase family, including SAPK/JNK and p38 function as pro-apoptotic signals for a number of cell types (41Xia Z. Dickens M. Rainegeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5032) Google Scholar). KSR is an essential kinase in TNF signal transduction, determining intestinal epithelial cell fate by regulating the anti-apoptotic NFκB, ERK/MAP kinase, and Akt pathways (29Yan F. John S.K. Polk D.B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8668-8675PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither TNF activation of p38 MAP kinase nor SAPK/JNK is inhibited by disruption of KSR signaling. Despite blocking all the anti-apoptotic signals mediated through KSR, LGG still promotes intestinal cell survival (Fig. 1). This effect appears to require blocking p38 MAP kinase activation (Fig. 5 B), because Akt activation by the LGG supernatant is insufficient to fully reverse apoptosis (Fig. 1 B). Surprisingly, factors recovered from bacterial culture or conditioned cell culture media reduce apoptosis and activate Akt. Production of these factors does not require bacterial-intestinal cell contact. Previously studies have reported that some Lactobacillusstrains produce proteinaceous (23Bernet-Camard M.F. Lievin V. Brassart D. Neeser J.R. Servin A.L. Hudault S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2747-2753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or protease-insensitive (22Zamfir M. Callewaert R. Cornea P.C. Savu L. Vatafu I. De Vuyst L. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1999; 87: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) anti-bacterial compounds. However, we are unaware of reports indicating that bacterially produced factors regulate either Akt signal transduction or cell survival pathways. Thus far we have identified two proteins in LGG culture broth with molecular sizes of ∼80 and 42 kDa based on SDS-PAGE. These two factors are heat- and protease-sensitive, and their activities are recoverable by electroelution from polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). Clearly, recovery and further characterization of these factors is a high priority. Our evaluation of LGG as a model probiotic organism reveals an important and novel relationship between intestinal epithelial cell survival and selective microflora. Clearly, this single epithelial layer lining the intestine exists in a relatively hostile environment of pathogenic organisms, toxic waste by-products, and cytokines. This report adds to our understanding of the signal transduction pathways in the intestinal epithelial cell that are regulated by probiotics and commensal organisms to include intestinal cell survival in addition to intestinal homeostasis (3Hooper L.V.

Therefore, further studies of the molecular basis for probiotic regulation of intestinal epithelium are relevant to understanding normal development as well as the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.

Each complex contained three protein components: (i) a chimeric scaffoldin possessing an optional cellulose-binding module and two cohesins of divergent specificity, and (ii) two cellulases, each bearing a dockerin complementary to one of the divergent cohesins. The activities of the resultant ternary complexes were assayed using different types of cellulose substrates. Organization of cellulolytic enzymes into cellulosome chimeras resulted in characteristically high activities on recalcitrant substrates, whereas the cellulosome chimeras showed little or no advantage over free enzyme systems on tractable substrates. On recalcitrant cellulose, the presence of a cellulose-binding domain on the scaffoldin and enzyme proximity on the resultant complex contributed almost equally to their elevated action on the substrate. For certain enzyme pairs, however, one effect appeared to predominate over the other. The results also indicate that substrate recalcitrance is not necessarily a function of its crystallinity but reflects the overall accessibility of reactive sites.

A number of cellulolytic anaerobic microorganisms degrade plant cell wall cellulose by means of macromolecular complexes termed cellulosomes (1Schwarz W.H. Appl. Microbiol.

In addition to a collection of cellulases, these large complexes can also include enzymes specialized for the degradation of other plant cell wall polymers, such as hemicellulases and pectinases (9Blum D.L.

Bacterial cellulosomes are typically composed of a scaffolding protein containing several cohesin domains, which bind to the dockerin domains of the catalytic subunits. The complete dissociation of all known bacterial cellulosomes into individual components requires harsh treatments, such as elevated temperatures and/or the presence of chaotropic agents, thus reflecting the strength of the cohesin-dockerin interaction. In the case of Clostridium cellulolyticum and Clostridium thermocellum, the interaction is Ca2+-dependent (11Fierobe H.-P. Pagès S. Bélaı̈ch A. Champ S. Lexa D. Bélaı̈ch J.-P.

The scaffoldins produced by C. cellulolyticum and C. thermocellum contain multiple cohesin domains and a single family 3A cellulose-binding domain (CBD). 1The abbreviations used are: CBD, cellulose-binding domain; CBM, carbohydrate-binding module; BC, bacterial cellulose; BMCC, bacterial microcrystalline cellulose; PAS-cellulose, phosphoric acid swollen cellulose; DP, degree of polymerization The latter is located at the N terminus of the C. cellulolyticum scaffoldin, whereas the scaffoldin CBD from C. thermocellum adopts an internal position (14Pagès S.

Demain A.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It has been shown for both species that the cohesins can interact with any of the dockerin domains of the same species, suggesting a random incorporation of the catalytic subunits along the scaffoldin (16Pagès S.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The cohesin-dockerin interaction, however, is species-specific, at least between these two clostridia (19Pagès S. Bélaı̈ch A. Bélaı̈ch J.-P. Morag E. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In a previous study (20Fierobe H.-P. Mechaly A. Tardif C. Bélaı̈ch A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bélaı̈ch J.-P. Bayer E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21257-21261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), we exploited the species specificity of the cohesin-dockerin interaction to selectively incorporate desired enzymes into precise positions within chimeric cellulosome complexes. For this purpose, a chimeric scaffoldin containing an optional CBD and divergent cohesins from each species binds selectively the appropriate dockerin-containing enzymes. In this manner, two cellulases fromC. cellulolyticum, the family-5 CelA and the family-48 CelF, were engineered to bear the dockerin domain of CelS from C. thermocellum. The hybrid enzymes were then incorporated onto the chimeric scaffoldins together with the native CelA or CelF. It was observed that complexation induced enhanced levels of synergy, especially in the case of the heterogeneous enzyme mixtures (i.e. the native CelA and the hybrid CelF or vice versa). In the present report, the technology involving the use of cellulosome chimeras was further extended to study binary mixtures of all available cellulases from C. cellulolyticum bound to a chimeric scaffoldin. To increase the number of enzyme pairs that can be incorporated in the complex, the native dockerin of CelE, one of the two major enzymes of the cellulosomes (17Gal L. Pagès S. Gaudin C. Bélaı̈ch A. Reverbel-Leroy C. Tardif C. Bélaı̈ch J.-P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 903-909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (the other one being CelF), was also replaced by the dockerin of CelS from C. thermocellum. Thus three different dockerin-engineered hybrid cellulases (CelA, CelE, and CelF) are now available for combination with one of the five available wild-type cellulases (CelA, CelC, CelE, CelF, and CelG). In addition, the collection of the four previously described chimeric scaffoldins, containing either one or lacking a family-3A CBD, was extended to include a fifth chimeric scaffoldin that bears a family-3A CBD at both extremities. In total, 75 different chimeric cellulosomes were assembled in vitro by mixing the three types of components, and their activity was assayed on various cellulose substrates of different source, crystallinity, and ultrastructure.

The plasmid pJFCc, encoding Cel8C of C. cellulolyticumcontaining a His tag at the C terminus, was obtained by inserting the primer 5′-TCAGCTAAAAGTTAAACTGCTTAACCACCACCACCACCACCACTAGC-3′ into a BlpI site (the His tag is underlined in all sequences) located at the 3′-extremity of the coding sequence of pC17 (26Fierobe H.-P.

Replacement of the native dockerin of Cel9E by the dockerin of C. thermocellum Cel48S was performed by the overlap-extension PCR method (27Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The C. thermocellum dockerin-encoding region of pJFAt was amplified using the forward primer 5′-GATGAAAAGGGGCCAGAGATTGCCAAGACAAGCCCTAGCCCATC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCCCCCCTCGAGTTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTTCTTGTACGGCAAT GT-3′, thus introducing an XhoI site (boldface type) at the 3′-extremity of the coding sequence. The region coding for the C-terminal part of the catalytic domain of Cel9E (including the uniqueBamHI site in pETEc) was amplified using the forward 5′-GTCATATGCTTATGAATTCAG-3′ and reverse 5′-GATGGGCTAGGGCTTGTCTTGGCAATCTCTGGCCCCTTTTCATC-3′ primers. The two resultant overlapping fragments (overlapping regions in italics) were mixed, and a combined fragment was synthesized using the external primers. The fragment was cloned intoBamHI-XhoI linearized pETEc, thereby generating pETEt. pETscaf5 was constructed from pETCip1X (20Fierobe H.-P. Mechaly A. Tardif C. Bélaı̈ch A. Lamed R. Shoham Y.

The region encoding cohesin2-CBD from C. thermocellum was amplified using the forward 5′-GGGCGGCTCGAGGTTCCGTCAGACGGT-3′ and reverse 5′-GGGCGGCTCGAGTATTGCATTCGGATCATC-3′ primers, introducing anXhoI site (boldface) at both extremities of the coding sequence. The resulting fragment was cloned intoXhoI-linearized pETCip1X, thus generating pETscaf5. Positive clones were verified by DNA sequencing. DH5α and JM109Escherichia coli strains (Clontech, Palo Alto CA) were used as production hosts for pJF and pQE derivatives, respectively. For pET derivatives, BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI), was used as production host. E. coli was grown at 37 °C toA 600 = 1.5 in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with glycerol (12 g/liter) and the appropriate antibiotic. The culture was then cooled to 25 (5Ac, 5At, 8Cc, all cohesin(s)-containing proteins), 18 (48Fc and 48Ft), or 15 °C (9Ec, 9Et, and 9Gc), and isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside was added to a final concentration of 400 (5Ac, 5At, 8Cc, all cohesin(s)-containing proteins) or 40 μm (48Fc, 48Ft, 9Ec, 9Et, and 9Gc). After 16 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (3000 ×g, 20 min), resuspended in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and broken in a French press. The purification of His-tagged proteins (see Fig. 1) was performed on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (28Porath J. Carlsson J. Olsson I. Belfrage G. Nature. 1975; 258: 598-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar) (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). Scaf1, Scaf2, miniCipC1, and C2-CBDt were purified on Avicel PH101 (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) as described previously (18Yaron S. Morag E. Bayer E.A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Purification was achieved on Q-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5. The proteins of interest were eluted by a linear gradient from 0 to 400 mm NaCl in 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5. The concentration of purified proteins was routinely estimated by absorbance (280 nm) in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, using the program ProtParam tool (www.expasy.ch/tools/protparam.html) and also by quantitative amino acid analysis on a Beckman 6300 system (Fullerton, CA) using ninhydrin detection. The protein samples were dialyzed by ultrafiltration against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C. The β-glucosidase Novozyme 188 (Novozymes, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) produced by Aspergillus niger was purified by gel filtration as described previously (29Boisset C. Fraschini C. Schülein M. Henrissat B. Chanzy H. Appl. Environ.

The activity of the fractions was analyzed usingp-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma), and the purity was verified by SDS-PAGE (Phast System, AmershamBiosciences). Fractions containing a single band at around 100 kDa were pooled and concentrated using a PM10 membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with a cut-off of 10 kDa. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The cellulosome produced by C. cellulolyticum was purified as described previously (17Gal L. Pagès S. Gaudin C. Bélaı̈ch A. Reverbel-Leroy C. Tardif C. Bélaı̈ch J.-P. Appl. Environ.

The final protein concentration was determined as above. Samples (10 μm final concentration) were mixed at room temperature in 20 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.0, 10 mm CaCl2, and 100 mm NaCl, and 1–4 μl were subjected to PAGE (4–15% gradient) using a PhastSystem device (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins (10 μm final concentration) were mixed at room temperature in 20 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.01% NaN3, and incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots were pipetted at 0, 1, 6, and 24 h, and their residual activity toward carboxymethyl cellulose (Sigma) (8 g/liter) was determined as described previously (21Fierobe H.-P. Gaudin C.

The samples were also subjected to nondenaturing PAGE (4–15% gradient) and to SDS-PAGE (12.5%) after addition of loading buffer (25% v/v) and 5 min of boiling. An aqueous suspension of homogenized ribbons of bacterial cellulose (BC) was prepared from Nata de coco (Daiwa Fine Products, Singapore) as described previously (29Boisset C. Fraschini C. Schülein M. Henrissat B. Chanzy H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 1444-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Bacterial microcrystalline cellulose (BMCC) was prepared from BC as described previously (31Väljamäe P. Sild V. Nutt A. Pettersson G. Johansson G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The concentration was determined by dry weight and by neutral sugar analysis (32Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (41197) Google Scholar). Phosphoric acid swollen (PAS)-cellulose was obtained from Avicel PH101 according to Ref. 33Walseth C.S. Tech. Assoc. Pulp Pap. Ind. 1952; 35: 228-233Google Scholar. Relative crystallinity indices of the cellulose suspensions (20 ml, 1 g/liter) were verified by x-ray diffraction (31Väljamäe P. Sild V. Nutt A. Pettersson G. Johansson G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) after vacuum filtration and air drying. The celluloses were resuspended in 20 mm Tris maleate, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% NaN3. Aliquots (40 μl) of the protein samples (10 μm in 20 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.0, 10 mm CaCl2, and 100 mm NaCl) were incubated at 37 °C with 4 ml of substrate. The final protein concentration was thus 0.1 μm. At 0, 1, 6, and 24 h, 0.9-ml aliquots were centrifuged and examined for reducing sugars (34Park J.T. Johnson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 181: 149-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In selected experiments, purified β-glucosidase (see above) was added at a final concentration of 0.05 g/liter. In this case, aliquots were examined after centrifugation for reducing sugars (34Park J.T. Johnson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 181: 149-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and glucose content using the glucose oxidase method (35Huggett A.S.G. Nixon D.A. Lancet. 1957; 2: 368-370Abstract Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). The recombinant and engineered proteins (scaffoldins and enzymes), used in this study for incorporation into cellulosome chimeras, are presented in Fig. 1. Based on data published earlier (20Fierobe H.-P. Mechaly A. Tardif C. Bélaı̈ch A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bélaı̈ch J.-P. Bayer E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21257-21261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), which demonstrated that scaffoldins containing a single CBD (Scaf1, -2, and -3) induced higher stimulation than those lacking a CBD (Scaf4), a fifth hybrid scaffoldin, derived from Scaf3, was designed and produced in E. coli. The resultant protein (Scaf5) contained a second family 3A CBD, stemming from CipA of C. thermocellum and located at the C terminus. Thus, Scaf5 contains one family 3A CBD from both species. The replacement of the intrinsic dockerin domain of CelE fromC. cellulolyticum by the dockerin of CelS from C. thermocellum was also performed, thereby generating 9Et. For the purposes of this study, the enzymes are given a descriptive notation (see Fig. 1), whereby the initial number designates the corresponding glycosylhydrolase family (36Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Ohmiya K. Hayashi K. Sakka K. Kobayashi Y. Karita S. Kimura T. Genetics, Biochemistry and Ecology of Cellulose Degradation. Uni Publishers Co., Tokyo1999: 15-23Google Scholar); the capital letter refers to the original name of the C. cellulolyticum cellulase (i.e. CelE in this instance), and the lowercase letter indicates the origin of the dockerin domain (either C. cellulolyticum or C. thermocellum). Three hybridC. cellulolyticum cellulases, bearing a C. thermocellum dockerin, were therefore available, 5At, 9Et, and 48Ft, and can be complemented for assembly of chimeric complexes by one of the five available native cellulases 5Ac (21Fierobe H.-P.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6595-6601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C. cellulolyticum cellulases 5Ac and 8Cc were described previously as typical endoglucanases (21Fierobe H.-P. Gaudin C. Bélaı̈ch A.

Biochem. 1993; 217: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), whereas 9Gc is an unusual endocellulase, the activity pattern of which resembles that of the homologous enzyme Cel9A from Thermobifida fusca (24Gal L.

J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cellulosomal enzyme subunits 9Ec and 48Fc, however, were unambiguously identified as endo-processive cellulases (22Gaudin C. Bélaı̈ch A. Champ S. Bélaı̈ch J.-P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1910-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 37Reverbel-Leroy C. Pagès S. Bélaı̈ch A. Bélaı̈ch J.-P. Tardif C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 46-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, 9Ec (or 9Et) and 9Gc contain additional accessory domain(s) compared with the other cellulases used in the present study; 9Ec has a family-4 CBM and an Ig-like domain at the N terminus, whereas 9Gc contains a family-3C CBM between the catalytic domain and the C-terminal dockerin domain. Thus 15 different enzyme pairs can be incorporated onto each of the five hybrid scaffoldin leading to 75 different cellulosome chimeras. The various proteins were produced in E. coli and were purified by a two-step procedure. The first step involved affinity chromatography on either cellulose or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid according to the presence of a CBD or His tag, respectively; final purification was subsequently achieved by a chromatography on an anion exchanger. Prior to addition of the substrate, stoichiometric mixtures of two desired enzymes and a test scaffoldin were subjected to nondenaturing PAGE in order to verify complex formation. As described previously (20Fierobe H.-P. Mechaly A. Tardif C. Bélaı̈ch A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bélaı̈ch J.-P. Bayer E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21257-21261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), all ternary mixtures resulted in a single major band of altered mobility, indicating that complete or near-complete complex formation was observed in all cases. Enzyme pairs in the free state displayed little or no synergy on 3.5 g/liter Avicel, except the 48Ft + 9Gc pair for which the synergy reaches 2 (TableI). In contrast, most ternary complexes were found to be more active than the corresponding free enzyme pairs. The enhancement of the activity increased with incubation time to reach a maximum at 24 h, in the case of scaffoldins containing one or two CBDs, whereas for Scaf4-containing complexes the maximum enhancement was often reached after 6 h and remained constant until the end of the kinetic study (data not shown). The highest stimulation factors (SF, Table I), because of complexation, were observed for 5At and 9Gc bound to Scaf1 or Scaf2. In general, for a given enzyme pair, the same “hierarchy” between the scaffoldins in terms of activity enhancement was found: Scaf1 = Scaf2 > Scaf3 > Scaf5 ≥ Scaf4, thus indicating that the second family 3A CBD introduced in Scaf5 has a negative impact on the activity of the complexes, because Scaf3-containing complexes were more efficient. Lower but significant enhancements were observed for complexes containing Scaf4; the values varied from 3.5 (5At + 9Gc) to no enhancement for homogeneous enzyme pairs such as 9Et + 9Ec, indicating that in most cases bringing two different cellulases together is enough to trigger enhanced synergy. This suggests that the increase of activity observed when enzyme pairs are bound to Scaf2, for instance, is because of both the proximity of the catalytic domains in the complex and the presence of the family 3A CBD of the scaffoldin. To estimate the relative contribution of the CBD and the proximity in this type of complex, the data obtained with Scaf2 and -4 (Table I) were plotted in Fig.2 A. On the abscissaare reported the enhanced synergies exclusively due to enzyme proximity (SFScaf4), and the ordinates represent the calculated contribution of the CBD in Scaf2-based complexes (SFScaf2/SFScaf4). Many spots are located near or just above the diagonal line, indicating that both the CBD and the proximity of the enzymes contribute almost equally to the enhanced synergy observed for the Scaf2-based complexes. For selected enzyme pairs, however, one effect seemed to predominate over the other. For example, the inclusion of 48Ft and 8Cc into a Scaf4-based complex has no impact on the activity, and the observed enhancement when these cellulases are bound to Scaf2 would presumably reflect the presence of the CBD of the scaffoldin. On the other hand, the impact of the enzyme proximity is predominant when the cellulase pair 5At + 9Gc is attached to Scaf2, although the CBD still induces an additional 2-fold increase. An unexpected result concerns the homogeneous enzyme pair 5At + 5Ac, which, as previously reported (20Fierobe H.-P. Mechaly A. Tardif C. Bélaı̈ch A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bélaı̈ch J.-P. Bayer E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21257-21261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), is 30–40% more active when bound to Scaf4. On the basis of these data, the impact of the complexation of these two enzyme pairs was subjected to additional investigation.Table IReleased soluble sugars from Avicel (3.5 g/liter) after 24 h at 37 °C by cellulosome chimeras, free enzyme pairs, and free enzymesPairsScaf1Scaf2Scaf3Scaf4Scaf5Free enzyme pairsμmSF1-aStimulation Factor (SF) is the impact of the complexation of an enzyme pair on a given scaffoldin: SF = (released soluble sugars by ternary complex)/(released soluble sugars by the corresponding free enzyme pairs).μmSFμmSFμmSFμmSFμmsynergy1-bSynergy between enzymes in the free state: synergy factor = (released soluble sugars by a free enzyme pair)/(sum of released soluble sugars by corresponding enzymes alone).5At/5Ac701-cAverages of 2–6 e"

Cytotrophoblasts can function as stem cells for the development of the syncytiotrophoblast layer via cell fusion. An envelope gene of the human endogenous retrovirus family W (HERV-W) calledsyncytin is specifically expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer. Syncytin is a fusogenic membrane protein; therefore, it can mediate the fusion of cytotrophoblasts into the syncytiotrophoblast layer, which is essential for pregnancy maintenance. GCMa is a placenta-specific transcription factor and is required for placental development. To study the placenta-specific fusion mediated by syncytin, we tested whether GCMa is involved in this process by regulating syncytin gene expression. In this report, we demonstrate that GCMa was able to regulatesyncytin gene expression via two GCMa-binding sites upstream of the 5′-long terminal repeat of thesyncytin-harboring HERV-W family member in BeWo and JEG3 cells but not in HeLa cells. Furthermore, adenovirus-directed expression of GCMa enhanced syncytin gene expression and syncytin-mediated cell fusion in BeWo and JEG3 cells but not in HeLa cells. Therefore, the integration site of thesyncytin-harboring HERV-W family member in the human genome is close to the functional GCMa-binding sites by which GCMa can specifically transactivate syncytin gene expression in trophoblast cells.

Our results may help to explain the mechanism underlying the cell fusion event specific for syncytiotrophoblast formation. The human placenta contains a specialized cell type called a trophoblast, which is the first lineage to differentiate in embryo development and plays key roles during implantation and placentation. The human trophoblast cell can be further classified as cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. In the early gestation stage, cytotrophoblast stem cells facing the maternal decidua proliferate and fuse to form a syncytium, i.e. the syncytiotrophoblast. Later on, vascular spaces called trophoblastic lacunae appear in the syncytium around day 8–9. The cytotrophoblast layer under the syncytium can rapidly proliferate into these spaces, which results in the formation of the primary chorionic villi. Subsequently, proliferation of the cytotrophoblasts, growth of chorionic mesoderm (under the cytotrophoblast layer), and blood vessel development transform the primary villi into secondary and tertiary villi, which are composed of a core of mesenchyme cells surrounded by an inner layer of cytotrophoblasts and an outer layer of multinucleate syncytiotrophoblasts (1Benirschke K.

Placenta. 2001; 22: S83-S92Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The syncytiotrophoblast layer (syncytium) transports nutrients and gases and produces hormones such as placental lactogen and chorionic gonadotrophin, which are indispensable for the further progression of pregnancy (1Benirschke K. Kaufmann P. Pathology of the Human Placenta. 4th Ed. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2001: 49-56Google Scholar). Recently, a membrane protein termed syncytin has been demonstrated to mediate cell fusion of the human BeWo trophoblastic cell line (3Mi S. Lee X. Li X. Veldman G.M. Finnerty H. Racie L. LaVallie E.

These studies suggest that syncytin can mediate fusion of cytotrophoblasts into the syncytiotrophoblast layer, and the expression of syncytin is tightly regulated in a temporal and spatial manner to maintain an integral and functional syncytiotrophoblast layer. GCM (glial cell missing) was originally isolated from aDrosophila melanogaster mutant line that produces additional neurons at the expense of glial cells (6Hosoya T. Takizawa K. Nitta K. Hotta Y.

Altogether these GCM homologues form a novel family of transcription factors, which all share sequence homology in the amino-terminal region that constitutes the DNA-binding domain called the GCM motif. Although sequence homology is less preserved outside the GCM motif, a transactivation domain (TAD) has been identified in the extreme carboxyl terminus of GCM proteins (10Akiyama Y. Hosoya T.

Drosophila GCM mRNA is transiently detected in glial precursors and immature glial cells, except for mesectodermal midline glia during a short period of gliogenesis within the central nervous system (6Hosoya T.

Cell. 1995; 82: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In contrast, mouse GCMa mRNA is highly expressed in the labyrinthine trophoblast cells (13Basyuk E. Cross J.C. Corbin J. Nakayama H. Hunter P. Nait-Oumesmar B. Lazzarini R.A. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 214: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). GCMa is required for placental development because genetic ablation of mouseGCMa leads to a failure of labyrinth layer formation and the fusion of trophoblasts to syncytiotrophoblasts (14Anson-Cartwright L.

To study the placenta-specific fusion mediated by syncytin, we tested whether GCMa can activate the promoter activity of the long terminal repeats (LTRs) of the syncytin-harboring HERV-W family member to specifically drive syncytin expression in trophoblast cells. In this study, we demonstrated that GCMa recognizes two GCMa-binding sites (GBSs) in the upstream region of the 5′-LTR of the syncytin-harboring HERV-W family member, activatingsyncytin gene expression and consequently enhancing the syncytin-mediated cell fusion. Our data help to explain the regulatory mechanism underlying the placenta-specific trophoblastic fusion mediated by syncytin. The human syncytin and GCMa cDNAs were cloned by PCR using a human placental cDNA library as template. The syncytin cDNA fragment was radiolabeled and used to screen a λDASH II human genomic library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A genomic clone, L13, covering the entire proviral genome of the syncytin-harboring HERV-W family member was isolated and used to build promoter constructs (Fig. 1 A). The human BAC clone, 083M05 (GenBankTM accession no. AC000064), was used to isolate more distal genomic regions upstream and downstream of the proviral genome of the syncytin-harboring HERV-W family member (Fig. 1 A). A GCMa cDNA fragment containing an amino-terminal HA epitope sequence was subcloned into the pRcCMV plasmid (Invitrogen) to generate pCMVHAGCMa. Genomic fragments were subcloned into the pE1bCAT reporter plasmid, which is derived from pCAT3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) by insertion of the adenovirus E1B TATA box in front of the bacterial CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) gene. For simplicity, the range of genomic fragments used for these constructs was based on the numbering of nucleotide (nt) residues in the 083M05 BAC clone. Genomic fragments of nt 25468–30953 with deletions of GBS-(25538–25545), GBS-(28026–28033), or both were subcloned into pCAT3-Basic to generate deletion constructs pCATΔd-(25468–30953), pCATΔp-(25468–30953), or pCATΔdp-(25468–30953), respectively. The mammalian cell lines used in this study were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). BeWo cells were grown at 37 °C in F-12K, 15% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. JEG3 and HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C in minimum Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and the same antibiotics as mentioned above. BeWo or HeLa cells were transfected by using the Geneporter system (GTS, San Diego, CA). CAT assays were performed as described (16Chen H. Chong Y. Liu C.-L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1675-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The Student's t test was performed to determine statistical significance for differences between means of relative CAT activities. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. HAGCMa proteins in transfected cells were subject to immunoblotting with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The membranes were stripped in 62.5 mmTris-HCl (pH6.7), 100 mm 2-mercaptoethaniol, and 2% SDS at 50 °C for 30 min and reprobed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-actin antibody (Sigma). Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) were maintained as suspension cultures at 28 °C in Sf-900II SFM (Invitrogen), 0.125 μg/ml amphotericin B, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin. A GCMa cDNA fragment with a carboxyl-terminal FLAG epitope sequence was subcloned into the pVL1392 transfer plasmid (BD Biosciences). The resultant construct was cotransfected with Bsu36I-digested baculoviral genomic DNA (Novagen, Madison, WI) into Sf-9 cells to generate recombinant GCMa-FLAG baculoviruses, which were used to express GCMa-FLAG proteins. GCMa-FLAG proteins were purified by the FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody affinity column (Sigma). The electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed as described (16Chen H. Chong Y. Liu C.-L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1675-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. End-labeled DNA fragments or oligonucleotide probes were incubated with 20 ng of GCMa-FLAG proteins in a binding reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mmZnCl2, 4 mm spermidine, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.25 μg poly(dI-dC) and 7.5 μg of bovine serum albumin. After incubation, the reaction mixtures were analyzed by electrophoresis on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in running buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 190 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. Two oligonucleotides, dGCMa (5′-ACTTCTGTCCCTCATGGCCAGT-3′) and pGCMa (5′-TTCTGGGATGAGGGCAAAACG-3′), were synthesized. A mutant pGCMa oligonucleotide, Mut (5′-TTCTGGGATGATAGCAAAACG-3′), was also synthesized as a negative control. Antiserum against human GCMa was induced in guinea pigs using a His-tagged GCMa recombinant protein expressed in BL21(DE3). 1 μl of antiserum or normal serum was used for supershift experiments. DNase I footprinting analysis was performed essentially as described by Chen et al. (17Chen H. Chen C.L. Chou J.Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9615-9626Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Approximately 3 × 107 BeWo cells transfected with 20 μg of pCMVHAGCMa were subject to a ChIP assay as described by Boyd and Farnham (18Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). HAGCMa-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated by a rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and Protein A-agarose beads (Oncogene, Boston, MA). Specific sequences of regions upstream of the 5′-LTR of HERV-W in the immunoprecipitates were detected by PCR with specific primers. PCR products were analyzed on 2% MetaPhor agarose gels (FMC, Rockland, ME). Sequences of primers are 5′-CTCAGTCCGGCTTACAGTTTCGTTC-3′ and 5′-GAATAAGACGGCCTTCTGACCCTTC-3′ for region 22473–22371; 5′-GGCGTCAGATCCCATTACTCTAGG-3′ and 5′-AATAGAATGGGCCTGTGAGGCTGG-3′ for region 25461–25686; 5′-GCCCATTTCGATTGTAACATCTGCCAC-3′ and 5′-GCAAGATAATTGCTGTATCTCCAGGC-3′ for region 27800–28064. Recombinant HAGCMa adenoviruses (Ad-HAGCMa) were generated in CRE8 cells by cotransfection of the linearized transfer vector (pAdlox-HAGCMa) and the ψ5 genomic DNA (19Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For a control, an empty recombinant adenovirus (Adlox) was generated using a linearized pAdlox and ψ5 genomic DNA. Ad-HAGCMa and Adlox were grown and amplified in CRE8 cells for two consecutive cycles. Cells in culture plates were transduced with Ad-HAGCMa or Adlox at an multiplicity of infection of 100 or 200 at 37 °C for 90 min. After that, the virus was removed, and fresh culture media were added and incubated for an additional time until analysis. RNA was isolated using RNeasy reagents (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA (20 μg) were assayed for Northern analysis using human GCMa or β-actin cDNA probes. To detect syncytin transcripts, 15 μg of RNA from Ad-HAGCMa-transduced cells were analyzed by ribonuclease protection assays using the RPA III kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The syncytin riboprobe contains nucleotides 417–821 relative to the translation start site. A kit-provided β-actin riboprobe was used as an internal control. The protected syncytin bands were quantified by BAS-1500. HAGCMa and syncytin proteins in transduced cells were subject to immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody and a syncytin antibody, respectively. Antiserum against syncytin was induced in guinea pigs using a His-tagged surface protein (amino acids 21–215) expressed in BL21(DE3). 293 cells were transfected with the red fluorescent protein plasmid pDsRed1-N1 (Clontech) 24 h before cell fusion assay. HeLa, JEG3, or BeWo Cells were transduced with Adlox or Ad-HAGCMa. Four hour post-infection, cells were trypsinized, and 8 × 105 infected cells and 1 × 106transfected 293 cells were cocultured onto a 60-mm culture dish. After another 30 h at 37 °C, cell fusions were examined under an Olympus microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (DP50). Images were prepared for presentation using Adobe Photoshop® 6.0. Syncytin is encoded by the envelope (env) gene of an HERV-W family member with a genomic configuration of 5′-LTR-gag-pro-pol-env-LTR-3′ (Fig. 1 A) (4Blond J.L. Beseme F. Duret L. Bouton O. Bedin F. Perron H. Mandrand B. Mallet F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1175-1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the placenta-specific expression of syncytin, promoter analysis was performed to identify potential elements and transcription factors that could enhance the LTR promoter activity of thesyncytin-harboring HERV-W family member. For simplicity, we refer to the syncytin-harboring HERV-W family member as HERV-W for the rest of this report. A λDASH II genomic clone (L13) containing the HERV-W genome was isolated using the syncytin cDNA probe (Fig. 1 A). A human BAC clone, 083M05, which encompasses the L13 clone, was used together with L13 to build a series of promoter constructs covering genomic regions up to 14.8-kb upstream of the 5′-LTR and 5.1-kb downstream of the 3′-LTR of HERV-W (Fig. 1,A and B). The role of the placenta-specific transcription factor GCMa in the expression of syncytin gene was investigated, because GCMa is known to play an important role in murine placental development (14Anson-Cartwright L. Dawson K. Holmyard D. Fisher S.J. Lazzarini R.A. Cross J.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar,15Schreiber J. Riethmacher-Sonnenberg E. Riethmacher D. Tuerk E.E. Enderich J. Bosl M.R. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2466-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Transient expression experiments of the promoter constructs were performed in BeWo cells. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the CAT activity directed by pE1bCAT-(25468–30953) is higher than those of the other constructs examined. In addition, a statistically significant 3.3-fold transactivation by GCMa on pE1bCAT-(25468–30953) was observed when it was cotransfected with pCMVHAGCMa. This up-regulation was not due to a differential expression of HAGCMa proteins in transfected cells because comparable amounts of HAGCMa proteins were detected (Fig.1 C). When the pE1bCAT- (25468–30953) was divided into pE1bCAT-(25468–28066) and pE1bCAT-(28067–30953), transcriptional activation by HAGCMa was not observed with either construct. pE1bCAT-(28067–30953) contains the 5′-LTR; therefore, these results suggest that potential GBSs are present in nucleotides 25468–30953, which, in conjugation with 5′-LTR, can be up-regulated by HAGCMa. The positive effect of pCMVHAGCMa on pE1bCAT-(25468–30953) was also observed in another human trophoblastic cell line, JEG3 (data not shown). The optimal recognition sequence for the DNA binding domain ofDrosophila GCM is 5′-(A/G)CCC(T/G)CAT-3′ or its 5′-ATG(A/C)GGG(T/C)-3′ complement (10Akiyama Y. Hosoya T. Poole A.M. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14912-14916Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 12Schreiber J. Enderich J. Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2337-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Indeed, close scrutiny of GBS(s) in nucleotides 25468–30953 revealed two potential GBSs (25538–25545 and 28026–28033) upstream of the 5′-LTR of HERV-W. The sequences for GBS-(25538–25545) and GBS-(28026–28033) are TCCCTCAT and ATGAGGGC, respectively. To test whether GCMa directly binds the two potential GBSs, we performed EMSA with radiolabeled (25488–25587) and (27978–28077) DNA fragments and a recombinant GCMa-FLAG protein (Fig.2 A). GCMa-FLAG specifically bound to radiolabeled (25488–25587) and (27978–28077) DNA fragments (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and 8) because the unlabeled oligonucleotide pGCMa, consisting of the GBS-(28026–28033) at a 100-fold excess, competed with complex formation (Fig.2 B, lanes 3 and 9). However, a pGCMa mutant oligonucleotide, Mut, containing mutated nucleotide residues in GBS-(28026–28033) could not compete with complex formation (Fig.2 B, lanes 4 and 10). Furthermore, the GCMa antiserum, but not the control serum, was able to supershift the DNA-protein complex (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5,6, 11, and 12). These results suggest that GBSs are existent in (25488–25587) and (27978–28077) DNA fragments. To localize the binding sites of GCMa in (25488–25587) and (27978–28077) DNA fragments, DNase I footprinting analyses were performed using GCMa-FLAG and the radiolabeled probes of the two fragments. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the regions protected by GCMa-FLAG in both fragments encompass the GBS core sequence and some immediate 5′-flanking nucleotides (Fig. 2 C). We further verified the footprinting results by EMSA using GCMa-FLAG and labeled dGCMa and pGCMa oligonucleotides spanning the GCMa-FLAG-protected regions GBS-(25538–25545) and GBS-(28026–28033), respectively (Fig.2 D). Specific complexes were observed in lanes without pGCMa and dGCMa competitor oligonucleotides and in lanes with the Mut negative control oligonucleotide (Fig. 2 D, lanes 2, 5, 9, and 12). A supershifted complex was only observed using the GCMa antiserum (Fig. 2 D,lanes 7 and 14). Taken together, the EMSA and footprinting results suggest that GCMa specifically recognizes GBS-(25538–25545) and GBS-(28026–28033) in the 5′-flanking region of HERV-W 5′-LTR. Transient expression experiments were performed in BeWo cells, using GBS-deletion promoter constructs, to test whether transactivation of HERV-W 5′-LTR by GCMa depends on GBS-(25538–25545) and GBS-(28026–28033) (Fig.3 A). As shown in Fig.3 B, transcriptional activation by HAGCMa of both pCATΔd-(25468–30953) and pCATΔp-(25468–30953) was observed; however, this activation was lower than that observed with pCAT-(25468–30953). Moreover, transactivation was abolished in pCATΔdp-(25468–30953). In contrast, no transcriptional activation by HAGCMa of these constructs was observed in HeLa cells. These results suggest that transactivation of HERV-W 5′-LTR by GCMa depends on the two GBSs and is cell type-dependent. Because GBS-(25538–25545) and GBS-(28026–28033) could be functionally transactivated by GCMa, we further tested whether GCMa interacts with both sites in vivo by means of a ChIP assay. BeWo cells were transfected with pCMVHAGCMa, and the DNA-HAGCMa complexes were immunoprecipitated by anti-HA antibody for PCR analysis (Fig. 4 A). Positive signals were detected when regions 25461–25686 and 27800–28064 were amplified by PCR (Fig. 4 B). These two regions encompass GBS-(25538–25545) and GBS-(28026–28033), respectively. No signal was detected when a more distal upstream region, 22473–22731, was amplified. These results suggest that GCMa associates with the two GBSs in the 5′-flanking region of HERV-W 5′-LTR in the nuclei of BeWo cells. We next tested whether the expression of GCMa increases the synthesis of syncytin proteins. A recombinant HAGCMa adenovirus, Ad-HAGCMa, and an empty recombinant adenovirus, Adlox, were generated. Expression of HAGCMa in BeWo, JEG3, or HeLa cells transduced with Ad-HAGCMa was analyzed by Northern and Western analyses at different time points. As shown in Fig. 5 A, Northern analyses revealed that HAGCMa transcripts in HeLa and BeWo cells were detected from 16 h to at least 72 h post-transduction. In JEG3 cells, HAGCMa transcripts were detected from 24 to 72 h post-transduction. Correspondingly, increasing levels of HAGCMa protein were detected in the transduced cells (Fig. 5 A,lower panel). To investigate the effect of HAGCMa on syncytin expression, ribonuclease protection assays were performed to specifically detect the syncytin transcripts in Ad-HAGCMaC-transduced cells at 24 or 48 h post-transduction. In comparison with untransduced cells, the level of syncytintranscripts in transduced JEG3 and BeWo cells at 48 h post-transduction increased ∼4.2- and 3.4-fold, respectively (Fig.5 B). Interestingly, no syncytin transcript was detected in transduced HeLa cells in the presence of a higher level of the HAGCMa protein. Western analyses on the syncytin proteins in BeWo and HeLa cells, transduced with Ad-HAGCMa or Adlox, were performed at 40 h post-transduction. As shown in Fig. 5 C, HeLa cells transduced with the control virus Adlox or Ad-HAGCMa did not reveal any signals for syncytin proteins (lanes 3 and 4). However, two bands of 75 and 200 kDa were observed in Ad-HAGCMa-transduced BeWo cells (lane 2). The band of 75 kDa may represent the syncytin precursor, whereas the band of 200 kDa may represent trimeric syncytin (5Blond J.L. Lavillette D. Cheynet V. Bouton O. Oriol G. Chapel-Fernandes S. Mandrand B. Mallet F. Cosset F.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3321-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The endogenous syncytin proteins in the Adlox-transduced BeWo cells were detected after a longer exposure (data not shown). The results of ribonuclease protection assays and Western analyses also suggest that GCMa transactivates syncytin gene expression in a cell type-dependent manner. Cell fusion assays were performed to investigate the effect of GCMa-activated syncytin expression on cell fusion. 293 cells expressing red fluorescent protein were cocultured with Adlox- or Ad-HAGCMa-transduced cells and examined under fluorescence microscopy 30 h after coculture. In comparison with Adlox-transduced cells (Fig. 6, A–C), fusion events were significantly increased in Ad-HAGCMa-transduced BeWo and JEG3 cells (Fig. 6, E and F). No fusion events were observed in Ad-HAGCMa-transduced HeLa cells (Fig. 6 D). Taken together, our study indicates that GCMa up-regulatessyncytin gene expression via two GBSs upstream of the HERV-W 5′-LTR and consequently enhances syncytin-mediated cell fusion. The fusogenic activity of the syncytin protein has been demonstrated in a variety of primate cell lines including BeWo, COS, HeLa, and 293 (3Mi S. Lee X. Li X. Veldman G.M. Finnerty H. Racie L. LaVallie E. Tang X.Y. Edouard P. Howes S. Keith Jr., J.C. McCoy J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 5Blond J.L. Lavillette D. Cheynet V. Bouton O. Oriol G. Chapel-Fernandes S. Mandrand B. Mallet F. Cosset F.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3321-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization has revealed that the expression of the syncytin gene is restricted to the syncytiotrophoblast layer in human placenta (3Mi S. Lee X. Li X. Veldman G.M. Finnerty H. Racie L. LaVallie E. Tang X.Y. Edouard P. Howes S. Keith Jr., J.C. McCoy J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that syncytin can mediate fusion of cytotrophoblasts into the syncytiotrophoblast layer. Strict regulation ofsyncytin gene expression is important in maintaining an integral syncytiotrophoblast layer, because the overexpression of syncytin in cultured cells causes extensive cell fusion and leads to cell death. 2P. Chen and H. Chen, unpublished data. In this study, we identified GCMa as a transactivator for the trophoblast-specific expression of the syncytin gene. Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, GCMa associated with GBS-(25538–25545) and GBS-(28026–28033) in the 5′-flanking region of HERV-W 5′-LTR in vivo based on ChIP analysis. Second, the expression of GCMa specifically increased the levels of syncytin transcripts and proteins in trophoblastic cells. Third, syncytin-mediated cell fusion was increased after GCMa expression. Interestingly, expression of the syncytin gene was not detected in HeLa cells expressing a high level of GCMa protein. This suggests that regulation of syncytin expression by GCMa is cell type-dependent or that other placenta-specific factors may be involved in the trophoblast-specific expression ofsyncytin gene. Mutation analysis revealed that nucleotide residues 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8 in the optimal GCM recognition sequence (5′-ATG(A/C)GGG(T/C)-3′) are important for interaction with Drosophila GCM and mouse GCMa (12Schreiber J. Enderich J. Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2337-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that two GCMa binding sites in the 5′-flanking region of HERV-W 5′-LTR were responsive to GCMa. The proximal site, GBS-(28026–28033), is 34 bp upstream of the 5′-LTR, and its sequence matches the optimal binding sequence perfectly. The distal site, GBS-(25538–25545), is 2522-bp upstream of the 5′-LTR, and its sequence has a mismatch in position 8 in comparison to the optimal binding sequence. Correspondingly, GBS-(25538–25545) has a lower binding efficiency with GCMa in EMSA (Fig. 2 D, lanes 9–11). Deletion of GBS-(25538–25545) had less of an effect than deletion of GBS-(28026–28033) on the transcriptional activation by GCMa, suggesting that the two sites may contribute differentially to the promoter activity (Fig. 3 B). In fact, it has been shown that there are at least five GCM-binding sites in the 5′-flanking region of Drosophila GCM gene, each contributing differentially to the promoter activity of the GCM gene (20Miller A.A. Bernardoni R. Giangrande A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6316-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our Western analyses detected the syncytin precursor proteins and their trimers in Ad-HAGCMa-transduced BeWo cells (Fig. 5 C). Blondet al. (5Blond J.L. Lavillette D. Cheynet V. Bouton O. Oriol G. Chapel-Fernandes S. Mandrand B. Mallet F. Cosset F.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3321-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), using a mouse monoclonal anti-syncytin antibody, have also detected syncytin precursor proteins and their trimers in transient expression experiments. It is possible that the efficiency of post-translational cleavage of syncytin protein is too low to produce a detectable level of surface protein for our Western analyses. Further investigations into the biosynthesis of syncytin protein and syncytin-mediated cell fusion may help to clarify this possibility. GCMa is a placenta-specific transcription factor required for placental development (14Anson-Cartwright L. Dawson K. Holmyard D. Fisher S.J. Lazzarini R.A. Cross J.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 15Schreiber J. Riethmacher-Sonnenberg E. Riethmacher D. Tuerk E.E. Enderich J. Bosl M.R. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2466-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition, GCMa proteins have been immunolocalized in human syncytioblasts and cytotrophoblasts (21Nait-Oumesmar B. Copperman A.B. Lazzarini R.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study, two functional GBSs were identified upstream of the HERV-W 5′-LTR due to the integration of HERV-W in the human genome. We found that GCMa recognizes these two functional GBSs, induces the trophoblast-specific expression of the syncytin gene, and consequently enhances syncytin-mediated trophoblastic fusion. These events could ensure the formation of an integral syncytiotrophoblast layer only in the placenta. A recent clinical survey on the expression of syncytin in human placentas has revealed a lower syncytin mRNA level in patients with placental dysfunction, including preeclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome (22Knerr I. Beinder E. Rascher W. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 2002; 186: 210-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because syncytin is a target gene of GCM, this warrants an investigation into the role played by GCMa in the etiology of preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome.

https://openalex.org/W2137100240,"Chronic regional impairments of the lymphatic circulation often lead to striking architectural abnormalities in the lymphedematous tissues. Lymphedema is a common, disabling disease that currently lacks a cure. Vascular endothelial growth factors C and D mediate lymphangiogenesis through the VEGFR-3 receptor on lymphatic endothelia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential for lymphangiogenesis with VEGF-C. We developed a rabbit ear model to simulate human chronic postsurgical lymphatic insufficiency. Successful, sustained surgical ablation of the ear lymphatics was confirmed by water displacement volumetry. After complete healing, the experimental animals (n=8) received a single, s.c. 100 microg dose of VEGF-C in the operated ear; controls (n=8) received normal saline. Radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy was performed to quantitate lymphatic function. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed 7-8 days following treatment. After VEGF-C, there was a quantifiable amelioration of lymphatic function. IHC confirmed a significant increase in lymphatic vascularity, along with reversal of the intense tissue hypercellularity of untreated lymphedema. This study confirms the capacity of a single dose of VEGF-C to induce therapeutic lymphangiogenesis in acquired lymphedema. In addition to improving lymphatic function and vascularity, VEGF-C can apparently reverse the abnormalities in tissue architecture that accompany chronic lymphatic insufficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2016851491,"We recently demonstrated that depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) caused activation of MAPK (Chen, X., and Resh, M. D. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 34617–34623). MAPK activation was phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent and involved increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3K. We next determined whether MβCD treatment induced tyrosine phosphorylation of other cellular proteins. Here we report that cholesterol depletion of serum-starved COS-1 cells with MβCD or filipin caused an increase in Tyr(P) levels of a 180-kDa protein that was identified as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Cross-linking experiments showed that MβCD induced dimerization of EGFR, indicative of receptor activation. Reagents that block release of membrane-bound EGFR ligands did not affect MβCD-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, indicating that MβCD activation of EGFR is ligand-independent. Moreover, MβCD treatment resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR downstream targets and Ras activation. Incubation of cells with the specific EGFR inhibitor AG4178 blocked MβCD-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, SHC, phospholipase C-γ, and Gab-1 as well as MAPK activation. We conclude that cholesterol depletion from the plasma membrane by MβCD causes ligand-independent activation of EGFR, resulting in MAPK activation by PI3K and Ras-dependent mechanisms. Moreover, these studies reveal a novel mode of action of MβCD, in addition to its ability to disrupt membrane rafts. We recently demonstrated that depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) caused activation of MAPK (Chen, X., and Resh, M. D. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 34617–34623).

Moreover, these studies reveal a novel mode of action of MβCD, in addition to its ability to disrupt membrane rafts. Cholesterol is a membrane lipid that regulates both the flexibility and the mechanical stability of the membrane bilayer. It has also been shown that cholesterol plays a critical role in assembling membrane microdomains, such as rafts and caveolae, in a separate phase from the rest of the bilayer (1Simons K. Ikonen E.

Cholesterol and lipid rafts are involved in numerous cellular processes, including membrane protein segregation and concentration, protein and lipid sorting, and virus assembly and release (1Simons K.

However, excess cholesterol is toxic to cells and can contribute to the development of diseases such as atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease (5Simons M. Keller P. De Strooper B. Beyreuther K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9670-9678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated (15Chen X. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34617-34623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that cholesterol depletion by MβCD induced ERK activation via a PI3K-dependent pathway. How cholesterol removal regulated this pathway was not clear. We had observed that treatment of cells with MβCD caused an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3K. It was therefore of interest to determine whether cholesterol depletion by MβCD induces tyrosine phosphorylation of other cellular proteins. Here we show that MβCD treatment of cells induced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins. A combination of Tyr(P) antibody/agarose affinity purification and mass spectrometry was used to identify one of the proteins (180 kDa) as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). MβCD treatment induced tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream targets of EGFR, including SHC, PLC-γ, and Gab-1 as well as Ras activation. We conclude that cholesterol depletion from the plasma membrane triggers signal transduction through ligand-independent activation of the EGF receptor. Goat polyclonal anti-p-EGFR (Tyr-1173), rabbit polyclonal anti-EGFR (1005), anti-ERK2 (C-14), and anti-Gab-1 (H-198), and monoclonal anti-Tyr(P) (PY99) and anti-p-ERK (E-4) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-EGFR (neutralizing) and monoclonal anti-PLC-γ were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit anti-p-EGFR (Tyr-1068) and anti-p-EGFR (Tyr-845) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-SHC and mouse monoclonal anti-SHC were obtained from BD Biosciences. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). GM6001 was obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) was obtained from Pierce. Wortmannin, TPA, CRM197, cholesterol, filipin, and methyl-β-cyclodextrin were purchased from Sigma. Tyrphostin AG1478 was obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Epidermal growth factor was obtained from Calbiochem. Trappsol was obtained from Cyclodextrin Technologies Development Inc.(High Springs, FL). COS-1 cells, A431 cells, and 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (COS-1, A431) or with 10% calf serum (3T3 cells). COS-1 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cholesterol depletion of cells was performed as described previously (15Chen X. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34617-34623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then incubated with the indicated concentration of MβCD (dissolved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) or other indicated cholesterol depletion reagents for 1 h at 37 °C before lysis. For inhibitor experiments, serum-starved cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with indicated inhibitors in the presence of 2% MβCD prior to harvest. Six 100-mm plates of COS-1 cells were serum-starved and then treated with 2% MβCD for 1 h. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 250 μg/ml Pefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and then subjected to affinity purification using an anti-Tyr(P)/agarose conjugate. Samples were washed three times with RIPA buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Individual protein bands were excised and digested with trypsin, and the tryptic peptides were subjected to mass fingerprinting by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry by the Sloan-Kettering Microchemistry Facility. Top “major” experimental masses (m/z) were used to search a non-redundant human data base using the PeptideSearch algorithm. A molecular weight range twice the predicted weight was covered, with a mass accuracy restriction of 40 ppm or better, and a maximum of one missed cleavage site allowed per peptide. In addition, mass spectrometric based sequencing (electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry) of selected peptides was performed using a PE-SCIEX API300 triple quadrupole instrument, fitted with a continuous flow nano-electrospray source (“JaFIS”). Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer, and lysates were clarified at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies and protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Samples were washed three times with RIPA buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed using the indicated antibodies. Proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL Western blotting detection reagents following the manufacturer's instructions. Ras activation was assayed using a Ras Activation Assay Kit (Upstate Biotechnology) following the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence staining was carried out as described previously (16Okamura H. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26613-26618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were seeded onto 25-mm glass coverslips and serum-starved for 24 h before treatment with 1% MβCD for 2 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 3.7% formalin/PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton in PBS for 5 min, and incubated with anti-Tyr(P) monoclonal antibody for 45 min. Cells were washed four times with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min. Following four 5-min washes, cells were mounted on microscope slides and visualized with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. Cross-linking experiments were performed as described (17Adelsman M.A. Huntley B.K. Maihle N.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2533-2544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modification. COS-1 cells were grown to subconfluency and then serum-starved for 24 h. Cells were treated with 2% MβCD for 1 h at 37 °C or as indicated, then transferred to room temperature, and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer. The membrane-impermeable cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) was dissolved in PBS and added to a final concentration of 2 mm for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched for 5 min by the addition of 1 m glycine, pH 8.0 (final concentration of 50 mm). Cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 250 μg/ml Pefabloc), and the lysate was clarified at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were adjusted to SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, followed by immunoblotting with anti-EGFR polyclonal antibody. COS-1 cells grown in 100-mm culture dishes were treated with or without 2% MβCD for 1 h. The plasma membrane fraction was isolated as described previously (18Alland L. Peseckis S.M. Atherton R.E. Berthiaume L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16701-16705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suspended in a minimum of PBS. An aliquot was used for protein measurement. The rest of the pellet was extracted with 2:1 methanol/chloroform, followed by 0.5 ml of chloroform and 0.5 ml of water. The chloroform (lipid phase) was dried under nitrogen. The dry lipid was suspended in 2-propanol, and membrane cholesterol was assayed using the Sigma Infinity cholesterol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Our recent studies (15Chen X. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34617-34623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) showed that treatment of COS-1 cells with MβCD activated MAPK via a PI3K-dependent pathway. Moreover, MβCD-treated cells exhibited enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3K. We therefore examined whether tyrosine phosphorylation of other cellular proteins was increased in response to MβCD. COS-1 cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then were treated with 1% MβCD for 1 h at 37 °C. Cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and anti-Tyr(P) Western blotting. As shown in Fig.1 A, tyrosine phosphorylation levels of two prominent proteins, termed p180 and p130, were increased upon treatment with MβCD. Similar results were also observed in NIH 3T3 cells. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining of COS-1 cells with anti-Tyr(P) antibody revealed a striking increase in the levels of cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation upon treatment of MβCD, compared with control cells, particularly at the plasma membrane and in the perinuclear region (data not shown). These results demonstrate that MβCD can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. The next set of experiments was designed to identify the MβCD-induced phosphorylated proteins. Serum-starved COS-1 cells were treated with 2% MβCD for 1 h, and cell lysates were subjected to affinity purification using an anti-Tyr(P)/agarose conjugate. Bound protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. As shown in Fig. 1 B, an 180-kDa band was apparent in the lane from MβCD-treated cells. The p180 band was excised and digested with trypsin. Mass spectrometric fingerprinting analysis was performed as described under “Materials and Methods,” resulting in the identification of p180 as the EGFR. To confirm that Tyr(P) 180 was the EGFR, immunoprecipitation and Western blotting of lysates from MβCD-treated COS-1 cells was performed with anti-EGF receptor and anti-Tyr(P) antibodies. As depicted in Fig. 1 C, treatment of cells with MβCD clearly induced EGFR phosphorylation. Similar results were also observed using an anti-p-EGFR antibody, which recognizes only tyrosine-phosphorylated (Tyr-1173) EGFR. In human A431 cells, which express high levels of EGFR protein, MβCD strongly increased EGFR phosphorylation (Fig.1 D). Moreover, the MβCD-induced increase in EGFR phosphorylation was inhibited by AG4178, a specific inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity (19Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). It is important to note that these experiments were performed with serum-starved cells, implying that phosphorylation of EGFR induced by MβCD is ligand-independent (see below). We next examined the concentration dependence of MβCD on EGFR phosphorylation. Serum-starved COS-1 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of MβCD for 1 h at 37 °C and then lysed. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-pEGFR antibody. MβCD induced phosphorylation of EGFR in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2), with maximal EGFR phosphorylation occurring at 2% MβCD. Concentrations of MβCD above 2% resulted in loss of cell viability. Quantitation of cholesterol levels revealed that addition of 2% MβCD resulted in an ∼40% reduction in membrane cholesterol content (Fig.3 A). In order to determine whether depletion of cholesterol by MβCD was responsible for EGFR phosphorylation, MβCD was preincubated with or without 40 μg/ml cholesterol and then added to cells for 1 h. The effect of cholesterol on MβCD-induced EGFR phosphorylation was then assessed. As shown in Fig. 3 B, cholesterol addback inhibited MβCD-induced EGFR phosphorylation by 60–70%. Next we examined whether other cholesterol depletion agents can cause ligand-independent EGFR phosphorylation. COS-1 cells were incubated with 2-OH-propyl-β-cyclodextrin (Trappsol), which is as effective in depleting cell membrane cholesterol as MβCD (20Liao Z. Cimakasky L.M. Hampton R. Nguyen D.H. Hildreth J.E. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2001; 17: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), or filipin, a cholesterol-binding agent (21McGookey D.J. Fagerberg K. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1273-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Both Trappsol and filipin caused EGFR phosphorylation (Fig. 3, C and D). These data imply that cholesterol depletion from the cell membrane induces EGFR phosphorylation. It has been established previously that upon EGF binding, EGFR undergoes ligand-induced dimerization, a prerequisite for normal receptor signaling (22van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR induced by MβCD occurs in the absence of EGF addition. We therefore investigated whether MβCD can also cause EGFR dimerization, indicative of EGFR activation. Serum-starved COS-1 cells were stimulated with 2% MβCD for 1 h at 37 °C and then exposed to the membrane-impermeable cross-linker BS3. As shown Fig.4, MβCD increased dimerization of EGFR to a similar extent as 25 ng/ml EGF, implying that MβCD induced ligand-independent activation of EGFR. Previous studies (23Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 24Chen N. Ma W.Y. She Q.B. Wu E. Liu G. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46722-46728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25Lemjabbar H. Basbaum C. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) have reported that transactivation of EGFR can occur by release of membrane-anchored EGFR ligands; this event is mediated by activation of transmembrane metalloproteinases. We therefore performed two sets of experiments to determine whether MβCD activation of EGFR was truly ligand-independent. First, cells were treated with a neutralizing antibody that effectively blocks the ligand-binding site of the EGFR. As depicted in Fig.5 A, antibody addition nearly completely blocked phosphorylation of the EGFR by EGF but had no effect on EGFR phosphorylation induced by MβCD. Second, addition of the broad spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors GM6001 (Fig.5 B) or BB-94 (not shown) had no effect on MβCD-induced EGFR activation but blocked EGFR transactivation induced by TPA. A similar result was obtained with CRM197, a diphtheria toxin mutant that specifically blocks the action of HB-EGF (26Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1015-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). TPA-induced transactivation of EGFR was inhibited by CRM197, whereas no effect was observed in MβCD-treated cells (Fig. 5 B). Thus, MβCD-induced activation of EGFR does not involve release of membrane-bound ligands. An alternative possibility was that MβCD activates a Src-dependent EGFR phosphorylation and transactivation process (27Wu W.G.L. Gill G.N. Parsons S.J. Samet J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24252-24257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with MβCD followed by Western blotting with phospho-specific EGFR antibodies revealed increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of two major autophosphorylation sites Tyr-1173 and Tyr-1068 as well as Tyr-845, a site phosphorylated by Src (Fig. 5 C). Addition of PP2, a Src kinase inhibitor, caused a partial (about 50%) inhibition of MβCD-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr-845. However, PP2 had no effect on the MβCD-induced increase in pERK (Fig. 5 D), indicating that Src was not likely to be involved in MAPK activation by MβCD. It is well established that binding of EGF to EGFR causes ERK activation (22van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether ligand-independent phosphorylation of EGFR induced by MβCD is responsible for ERK activation. Serum-starved COS-1 cells were incubated with or without the specific EGFR inhibitor AG4178 during MβCD treatment. The levels of p-EGFR and p-ERK were then analyzed. Pretreatment with AG4178 almost completely blocked both EGFR phosphorylation and ERK activation induced by MβCD as well as EGF (Fig. 6). These data demonstrate that EGFR phosphorylation induced by MβCD mediates ERK activation. We next investigated whether ligand-independent EGFR activation by MβCD caused tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR targets SHC, PLC-γ, and Gab-1. Lysates from serum-starved COS-1 cells that were not treated or were treated with MβCD were immunoprecipitated with anti-SHC or PLC-γ or Gab-1 antibodies, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an anti-Tyr(P) antibody. As shown in Fig. 7, treatment of cells with MβCD induced tyrosine phosphorylation of all three SHC isoforms (p66, p52, and p46) as well as PLC-γ and Gab-1. MβCD-induced SHC, PLC-γ, and Gab-1 phosphorylation levels were reduced by about 90% in the presence of the EGFR inhibitor AG4178 (data not shown). Thus, ligand-independent activation of EGFR results in phosphorylation of downstream targets of EGFR. In order to monitor Ras activation, cells were treated with MβCD or EGF, and the amount of activated Ras was quantitated using a Ras binding domain-glutathione S-transferase pulldown assay. As depicted in Fig. 8, 2% MβCD induced a 10–13-fold activation of Ras, compared with 20-fold obtained with 25 ng/ml EGF. It is therefore likely that Ras-dependent pathways contribute to ERK activation by MβCD. Our previous study (15Chen X. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34617-34623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) established that MβCD induced ERK activation in a PI3K-dependent manner. We therefore performed experiments to determine at which stage in the signaling pathway PI3K was involved. The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin had no effect on MβCD-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, SHC, PLC-γ, and Gab-1 (data not shown). However, wortmannin did significantly inhibit MβCD-induced ERK activation. Wortmannin caused a 50% reduction in pERK levels in cells treated with 2% MβCD and a 75% reduction in pERK in cells treated with 1% MβCD (Fig. 9, A andB). In order to determine whether a Ras/Raf/MEK pathway was responsible for the residual pERK activity, we incubated MβCD-treated cells in the presence, absence, or combination of wortmannin and/or PD98059, a MEK inhibitor. As depicted in Fig. 9 B, the combination of wortmannin and PD98059 reduced pERK to basal levels. Taken together, these results suggest that both PI3K and Ras-dependent pathways contribute to the MβCD-induced activation of EGFR signaling. Cyclodextrins such as MβCD effectively remove cholesterol from the plasma membrane (8Yancey P.G. Rodrigueza W.V. Kilsdonk E.P. Stoudt G.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 13072-13077Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This property has made MβCD an extensively used agent to study the function of rafts, membrane microdomains whose integrity depends on the presence of cholesterol. In this report, we show that cholesterol depletion by MβCD also has a striking effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous cellular proteins. The data presented here clearly demonstrate that MβCD treatment results in activation of the endogenous EGFR, as evidenced by increased tyrosine phosphorylation and dimerization of EGFR, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream substrates of EGFR, including endogenous SHC, PLCγ, and Gab-1, and activation of ERK. All of these events were blocked by AG4178, a specific EGFR kinase inhibitor, implying that ΜβCD induced EGFR signal transduction. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol plays a critical role in MβCD-mediated EGFR activation. First, multiple cholesterol-binding reagents, including MβCD, filipin, and trappsol, caused EGFR phosphorylation (Fig. 3, C and D). Moreover, the MβCD effect on EGFR phosphorylation was blunted by preincubating MβCD with cholesterol (Fig. 3 B). Based on these results we conclude that cholesterol depletion by MβCD triggers EGFR signaling. The data presented in the current study, combined with our recent report (15Chen X. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34617-34623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), establish a mechanism whereby MβCD induces ERK activation, i.e. activation of EGFR. Moreover, this work sheds light on the signaling pathways that are induced as a result of MβCD-induced EGFR activation. Multiple lines of evidence implicate PI3K as being required for MβCD-induced ERK activation. For example, expression of a dominant-negative PI3K mutant blocks MβCD-induced ERK activation (15Chen X. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34617-34623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, the adaptor protein Gab-1, which links activated growth factor receptors to PI3K (30Rodrigues G.A. Falasca M. Zhang Z. Ong S.H. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 31Yart A. Laffargue M. Mayeux P. Chretien S. Peres C. Tonks N. Roche S. Payrastre B. Chap H. Raynal P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8856-8864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), is tyrosine-phosphorylated in MβCD-treated cells (Fig. 7 C). Moreover, both wortmannin and LY294002, specific PI3K inhibitors, reduce ERK activation by MβCD (15Chen X. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34617-34623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the extent of inhibition by wortmannin varied with the concentration of MβCD, with 75% inhibition of ERK activation obtained when cells were treated with 1% MβCD, and only 50% inhibition at 2% MβCD (Fig.9). These results imply that additional, PI3K-independent pathways are activated by increasing MβCD concentrations. We observed previously (15Chen X. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34617-34623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that transfection of cells with domin"
https://openalex.org/W2036454153,"Although loss of the inhibitor of apoptosis (LAP) protein DIAP1 has been shown to result in caspase activation and spontaneous cell death in Drosophila cells and embryos, the point at which DIAP1 normally functions to inhibit caspase activation is unknown. Depletion of the DIAP1 protein in Drosophila S2 cells or the Sf-IAP protein in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21 cells by RNA interference (RNAi) or cycloheximide treatment resulted in rapid and widespread caspase-dependent apoptosis. Co-silencing of dronc or dark largely suppressed this apoptosis, indicating that DIAP1 is normally required to inhibit an activity dependent on these proteins. Silencing of dronc also inhibited DRICE processing following stimulation of apoptosis, demonstrating that DRONC functions as an apical caspase in S2 cells. Silencing of diap1 or treatment with UV light induced DRONC processing, which occurred in two steps. The first step appeared to occur continuously even in the absence of an apoptotic signal and to be dependent on DARK because full-length DRONC accumulated when dark was silenced in non-apoptotic cells. In addition, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 resulted in accumulation of this initially processed form of DRONC, but not full-length DRONC, in non-apoptotic cells. The second step in DRONC processing was observed only in apoptotic cells. These results indicate that the initial step in DRONC processing occurs continuously via a DARK-dependent mechanism in Drosophila cells and that DIAP1 is required to prevent excess accumulation of this first form of processed DRONC, presumably through its ability to act as a ubiquitin-protein ligase."
https://openalex.org/W2131108901,"Current evidence supports the notion that the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) plays a major role in the neurotoxicity observed in the brain in Alzheimer's disease. However, the signal transduction mechanisms involved still remain unknown. In the present work, we analyzed the effect of protein kinase C (PKC) on some members of the Wnt signaling pathway and its implications for Abeta neurotoxicity. Activation of PKC by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate protected rat hippocampal neurons from Abeta toxicity. This effect was accomplished by inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) activity, which led to the accumulation of cytoplasmic beta-catenin and transcriptional activation via beta-catenin/T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor-1 (TCF/LEF-1) of Wnt target genes, which in the present study were engrailed-1 (en-1) and cyclin D1 (cycD1,). In contrast, inhibition of Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms activated GSK-3beta and offered no protection from Ab neurotoxicity. Wnt-3a and lithium salts, classical activators of the Wnt pathway, mimicked PKC activation. Our results suggest that regulation of members of the Wnt signaling pathway by Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms may be important in controlling the neurotoxic process induced by Ab."
https://openalex.org/W1510569968,"The nuclear co-activator PGC-1α is a pivotal regulator of numerous pathways controlling both metabolism and overall energy homeostasis. Inappropriate increases in PGC-1α activity have been linked to a number of pathological conditions including heart failure and diabetes mellitus. Previous studies (Puigserver, P., Adelmant, G., Wu, Z., Fan, M., Xu, J., O'Malley, B., and Spiegelman, B. M. (1999) Science286, 1368–1371) have demonstrated an inhibitory domain within PGC-1α that limits transcriptional activity. Using this inhibitory domain in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we demonstrate that PGC-1α directly associates with the orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor-α (ERR-α). The binding of ERR-α to PGC-1α requires the C-terminal AF2 domain of ERR-α. PGC-1α and ERR-α have a similar pattern of expression in human tissues, with both being present predominantly in organs with high metabolic needs such as skeletal muscle and kidney. Similarly, we show that in mice physiological stimuli such as fasting coordinately induces PGC-1α and ERR-α transcription. We also demonstrate that under normal conditions PGC-1α is located within discrete nuclear speckles, whereas the expression of ERR-α results in PGC-1α redistributing uniformly throughout the nucleoplasm. Finally, we show that the expression of ERR-α can dramatically and specifically repress PGC-1α transcriptional activity. These results suggest a novel mechanism of transcriptional control wherein ERR-α can function as a specific molecular repressor of PGC-1α activity. In addition, our results suggest that other co-activators might also have specific repressors, thereby identifying another layer of combinatorial complexity in transcriptional regulation.

Finally, we show that the expression of ERR-α can dramatically and specifically repress PGC-1α transcriptional activity. These results suggest a novel mechanism of transcriptional control wherein ERR-α can function as a specific molecular repressor of PGC-1α activity. In addition, our results suggest that other co-activators might also have specific repressors, thereby identifying another layer of combinatorial complexity in transcriptional regulation. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α estrogen-related receptor-α mitogen-activated protein kinase green fluorescent protein mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase Co-activators represent an important class of molecules that can regulate transcription although they are unable to directly bind to DNA. In general, co-activators are thought to modulate gene expression through specific protein-protein interactions with classic transcription factors that possess DNA-binding domains. Similarly, another class of molecules called co-repressors can interact with transcription factors and subsequently inhibit downstream activation of gene expression. Although regulation of co-activator or co-repressor activity is incompletely understood, a number of recent reports have suggested that co-activators can be post-translationally modulated by targeted ubiquination as well as by various intracellular signaling pathways (1Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). Given that a single co-activator can potentially interact with a number of different transcription factors, such regulation will undoubtedly be important in ultimately understanding the specificity of transcriptional regulation. The nuclear co-activator PGC-1α1 was initially identified as a PPAR-γ co-activator (3Puigserver P., Wu, Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3000) Google Scholar) but has since been recognize to function in cooperation with a number of other members of the nuclear receptor family including the glucocorticoid receptor, the thyroid hormone receptor, the mineralocorticoid receptor, and the estrogen receptor (4Knutti D.

Binding of PGC-1α to these nuclear receptors requires a leucine-rich protein interaction domain, termed an LXXLL motif, which is found adjacent to the N-terminal activation domain of the protein (5Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 6Tcherepanova I. Puigserver P. Norris J.D. Spiegelman B.M. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol.

Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). In the presence of DNA and transcriptional binding partners, a recent study (10Puigserver P. Adelmant G., Wu, Z. Fan M., Xu, J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that PGC-1α appears capable of further recruiting other transcriptional regulators such as CBP, SRC-1, and the RNA II polymerase machinery. This study also demonstrated an inhibitory domain within PGC-1α that under normal circumstances appears to repress transcriptional activity of the protein. This inhibitory domain was revealed in part by the observation that an N-terminal 400-amino acid fragment of PGC-1α fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain was significantly weaker at stimulating transcription than a construct containing only the N-terminal 200 amino acid activation domain (10Puigserver P. Adelmant G., Wu, Z. Fan M., Xu, J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Interaction with a nuclear receptor partner and DNA was demonstrated to activate PGC-1α transcriptional activity presumably due to a conformational change in the inhibitory domain of the molecule. Activation of PGC-1α appears to be increasingly important in a number of critical biological processes including cellular respiration and adaptive thermogenesis (11Knutti D. Kralli A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 360-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Experiments in white fat, skeletal muscle, fibroblasts, and heart have demonstrated that overexpression of PGC-1α is sufficient to induce mitochondrial biogenesis (3Puigserver P., Wu, Z. Park C.W.

Commun. 2002; 294: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, PGC-1α activation can dramatically alter cellular energy homeostasis and has been noted to regulate a host of intracellular enzymes involved in oxidative-phosphorylation, glucose metabolism, and mitochondrial energetics (11Knutti D. Kralli A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 360-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 16Scarpulla R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1576: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Consistent with a central role in metabolism, physiological stimuli such as cold, fasting, or exercise have been demonstrated to regulate the intracellular levels of PGC-1α (9Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J., Wu, Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar, 10Puigserver P.

Commun. 2000; 274: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Given the pleotropic effects of PGC-1α, it is not surprising that there are significant pathological effects when the co-activator is not properly regulated. For instance, continuous expression of PGC-1α in the myocardium results in a dilated cardiomyopathy (13Lehman J.J. Barger P.M. Kovacs A. Saffitz J.E. Medeiros D.M. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Similarly, activation of PGC-1α in the liver has been linked to hepatic gluconeogenesis (9Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J., Wu, Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar, 18Herzig S. Long F.

Nature. 2001; 413: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar), a metabolic response to starvation that is inappropriately stimulated in patients with diabetes. Fully understanding the regulation of PGC-1α activity will undoubtedly provide significant insight into cellular energy homeostatic control. In addition, PGC-1α would appear to be an attractive therapeutic target for a number of conditions including heart failure and diabetes that have an underlying metabolic component. Recent evidence suggests that in skeletal muscle, cytokine activation of the p38/MAPK pathway results in phosphorylation of PGC-1α with a concomitant increase in the half-life and hence activity of the protein (19Puigserver P. Rhee J. Lin J., Wu, Z. Yoon J.C. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Mootha V.K. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Similarly, in cardiac myocytes p38/MAPK activation has been demonstrated to potentiate PGC-1α-mediated co-activation (20Barger P.M. Browning A.C. Garner A.N. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44495-44501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Interestingly, another report based on genetic evidence postulated that a specific repressor of PGC-1α might exist (8Knutti D. Kressler D. Kralli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9713-971815Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In general, specific molecular repressors of co-activators have not been described. Nonetheless, this postulated repressor appeared to bind to a potential leucine-rich motif contained within the inhibitory domain of PGC-1α, which is distinct from the LXXLL motif that a variety of nuclear receptors interact with. The interaction of PGC-1α with this unidentified repressor has been postulated to be regulated in part by the p38/MAPK pathway (8Knutti D. Kressler D. Kralli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9713-971815Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 21Oberkofler H. Esterbauer H. Linnemayr V. Strosberg A.D. Krempler F. Patsch W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16750-16757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Consistent with these studies, we report here the identification of a specific PGC-1α repressor and demonstrate that this molecule is the orphan nuclear receptor ERR-α. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed using the Matchmaker GAL-4 Two-Hybrid System 3 along with a human heart pre-transformed Matchmaker library (Clontech). Screening was performed according to manufacturer's recommendations. The region of human PGC-1α used as bait corresponded to amino acids 199–406. To confirm interaction of PGC-1α and ERR-α in mammalian cells, HeLa cells were harvested 24 h after transfection in lysis buffer (20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 125 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na-pyrophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture) followed by vigorous vortexing, one freeze-thaw cycle, and then centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, 1 mg of protein lysate was used and immunoprecipitated for 3 h with 5.0 μl of Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Immunoprecipitated samples were washed three times in ice cold phosphate-buffered saline, re-suspended in SDS-sample loading buffer, and analyzed by Western blot analysis using enhanced chemiluminescence. Epitope-tagged full-length human PGC-1α and ERR-α were respectively prepared by PCR amplification from a human heart and skeletal muscle cDNA library (Clontech) followed by in-frame subcloning into a Myc- (Invitrogen) or FLAG-tagged (Stratagene) expression vector. Similarly, GFP-PGC-1α was created by an in-frame fusion of full-length PGC-1α (amino acids 1–794) with green fluorescent protein. Truncation mutants of ERR-α were created by PCR amplification using full-length ERR-α as a template. All constructs were confirmed by direct nucleotide sequencing. GAL4-PGC-1α containing full-length PGC-1α or GAl4-PGC120 containing only the first 120 amino acid N-terminal activation domain have been previously described (5Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar) and were a kind gift of Daniel Kelly (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Similarly, the constitutively active MEK3b and the wild type MEK6, both upstream activators of the p38/MAPK pathway, were gifts of Silvio Gutkind (National Institutes of Health). The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) promoter luciferase construct (pPL32-PEPCK-luciferase) consisting of the upstream elements (−467) of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter has been previously described (9Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J., Wu, Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar) and was a kind gift of D. Granger (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). HeLa cells and human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum. In general, cells were plated 24 h prior to transient transfection using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. To determine the distribution of expression for PGC-1α and ERR-α in human tissues we used a 12-lane MTN membrane (Clontech) containing 1 μg poly(A) + RNA from 12 different human tissues.32P-labeled probes corresponding to full-length ERR-α, the first 560 nucleotides of PGC-1α, and β-actin (Clontech) were hybridized by standard means. For RT-PCR determinations, RNA was obtained from livers of 8-week-old C57BL mice ad libitum fed or starved for 24 h prior to harvest. Primers for analysis included 5′-CAC GCA GCC CTA TTC ATT GTT CG-3′ and 5′-GCT TCT CGT GCT CTT TGC GGT AT-3′ for PGC-1α; 5′-GGC CTC TGG CTA CCA CTA CGG-3′ and 5′-CTG GGT CAG GCA TGG CGT ACA-3′ for ERR-α. Primers for β-actin were provided by the manufacturer (Clontech). Data is expressed as fluorescent intensity of PGC-1α or ERR-α normalized for β-actin expression. All experiments were performed using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega) with an internal Renilla-luciferase control plasmid to normalize for transfection efficiencies. In general, transfections contained the pGAL-luciferase (UAS)6 reporter (0.1 μg), pGAL-PGC-1α (full-length) or pGAL-PGC120 (1 μg), ERR-α (full-length) or AF2 truncated form (1 μg), and the internal control Renilla plasmid (0.001 μg). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and results, except were indicated, represent a single experiment performed in triplicate (mean ± S.D.) from at least three similar experiments. All experiments were performed in HeLa cells except where indicated. To gain further insight into the molecular regulation of PGC-1α we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using a region of PGC-1α (amino acids 199–406) that overlaps with the previously described inhibitory domain of the molecule. This region of PGC-1α lacks a classic LXXLL motif (amino acids 143–148) previously implicated in binding to a number of nuclear receptors (5Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 6Tcherepanova I. Puigserver P. Norris J.D. Spiegelman B.M. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol.

Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar) but does contain a leucine-rich motif (amino acids 209–213) that is required to bind the putative PGC-1α repressor (8Knutti D. Kressler D. Kralli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9713-971815Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 21Oberkofler H. Esterbauer H. Linnemayr V. Strosberg A.D. Krempler F. Patsch W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16750-16757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We identified a number of potential interacting partners including the cytoskeletal proteins filamin C, tropomyosin, and titin. The most abundant partner was, however, the nuclear orphan receptor ERR-α. Interestingly, ERR-α has been previously implicated in transcriptional regulation of genes involved in energy metabolism (22Sladek R. Bader J.A. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5400-5409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Vega R.B. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31693-31699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Very recently, using a similar strategy as we have described, another report has also demonstrated an interaction between ERR-α and PGC-1α (24Huss J.M. Kopp R.P. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40265-40274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). This study demonstrated that this interaction required the leucine-rich motif (amino acids 209–213) of PGC-1α and the AF2 domain of ERR-α. We have come to similar conclusions (data not shown), and as noted in Fig. 1, in vivo, full-length ERR-α co-immunoprecipitated with PGC-1α. There was a very weak interaction noted between PGC-1α and the AF2-deleted construct of ERR-α that lacked the terminal 15 amino acids, although this binding was substantially less than with the full-length protein. Thus, as recently described (24Huss J.M. Kopp R.P. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40265-40274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), high affinity binding to PGC-1α requires the AF2 domain of ERR-α. If ERR-α is a physiological regulator of PGC-1α we reasoned that the tissue distribution of the two molecules should be similar. As noted in Fig. 2 A, in human tissues, PGC-1α was most abundant in skeletal muscle and kidney, two tissue with high metabolic needs. Interestingly, ERR-α was similarly highly expressed in these two tissues. We next sought to understand if the physiological stimuli that regulate PGC-1α also affect ERR-α. It has been recently described that hepatic PGC-1α is strongly induced by starvation (9Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J., Wu, Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). We therefore took either ad libitum fed mice or subjected mice to 24 h of starvation and compared the levels of hepatic PGC-1α and ERR-α. As noted in Fig. 2 B, inset, similar to what has been previously reported for PGC-1α, levels of ERR-α rose significantly in fasting animals. In a group of six animals, levels of PGC-1α and ERR-α both rose ∼10-fold with starvation (ERR-α/β-actin, control = 0.39 ± 0.16 to fasting = 3.35 ± 0.68; PGC-1α/β-actin control = 0.63 ± 0.08 to fasting = 9.97 ± 1.69; arbitrary fluorescent units, n = 6 mean ± S.E.). Given that ERR-α and PGC-1α interact and appear to be coordinately expressed and regulated, we next sought to further understand the biological effects of this interaction. Expression of full-length PGC-1α fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP-PGC-1α) demonstrated that PGC-1α was predominantly expressed in nuclear speckles (Fig. 3 A). This result is consistent with previous studies (25Monsalve M., Wu, Z. Adelmant G. Puigserver P. Fan M. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 307-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) suggesting that PGC-1α also participates in mRNA processing, because a number of splicing factors have been demonstrated to co-localize with PGC-1α within these nuclear speckles. Interestingly, expression of ERR-α results in a significant alteration in PGC-1α distribution so that the protein was now seen to be widely and evenly distributed within the nucleoplasm (Fig. 3 B). As seen in Fig. 3 C, consistent with the observation that the p38/MAPK pathway regulates the half-life of PGC-1α (19Puigserver P. Rhee J. Lin J., Wu, Z. Yoon J.C. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Mootha V.K. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), expression of a constitutively active form of MEK3b resulted in a slight overall increase in GFP-PGC-1α intensity. Nonetheless, activation of the p38/MAPK pathway did not reverse the effects that ERR-α expression had on PGC-1α sub-cellular distribution. We next sought to understand the effects of ERR-α on PGC-1α-mediated co-activation. As noted in Fig. 4 A, full-length PGC-1α fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain (GAL4-PGC-1α) was able to activate transcription of a reporter construct. Expression of a truncated form of ERR-α lacking the AF2 domain and therefore unable to interact with PGC-1α had a slight stimulatory effect on GAL4-PGC-1α activity. The basis for this stimulatory effect is unknown. In contrast, as seen in Fig. 4 A, expression of full-length ERR-α significantly repressed PGC-1α activity in this one-hybrid assay. Consistent with previous studies (5Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 10Puigserver P. Adelmant G., Wu, Z. Fan M., Xu, J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), a truncated form of PGC-1α containing only the N-terminal activation was a more potent activator of transcription than the full-length PGC-1α construct. In contrast to the dramatic effects of ERR-α on full-length PGC-1α, ERR-α expression had only a small effect on this truncated PGC-1α construct that lacked the inhibitory domain of the molecule (Fig. 4 B). A similar 10–20% decrease in activity was also seen when ERR-α was co-expressed with a GAL4-VP16 construct containing the potent viral activation domain (Fig. 4 C). We next assessed the effects of activating the p38/MAPK pathway on ERR-α repression of PGC-1α. As noted in Fig. 4 D, transfection of a constitutively active MEK3b or overexpression of wild type MEK6 did not substantially alter or relieve the ERR-α-mediated repression of PGC-1α. Finally, we analyzed the effects of ERR-α on an authentic target promoter. A previous report (9Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J., Wu, Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that in hepatoma cells, the promoter of PEPCK is regulated by PGC-1α. This is consistent with the known effects of PGC-1α as a regulator of hepatic gluconeogenesis (9Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J., Wu, Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar, 18Herzig S. Long F. Jhala U.S. Hedrick S. Quinn R. Bauer A. Rudolph D. Schutz G. Yoon C. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Montminy M. Nature. 2001; 413: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 4 D, PGC-1α was able to function as a transcriptional co-activator of the PEPCK promoter. Although expression of ERR-α alone had no effect on the promoter, co-expression of ERR-α and PGC-1α resulted in a near complete repression of PGC-1α activity. Regulation of co-activator activity represents an area of emerging interest. Previous studies (1Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that co-activators are subject to a host of post-translational modifications that regulate their activity. Specific repressors of co-activators, however, have not, to our knowledge, been widely described. We have demonstrated in this report that the inhibitory domain of PGC-1α binds to the nuclear orphan receptor ERR-α and that this binding alters the nuclear distribution of PGC-1α and represses its ability to act as a co-activator. These results complement a recent study (24Huss J.M. Kopp R.P. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40265-40274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) that has also demonstrated an interaction between PGC-1α and ERR-α. The implications of these two studies fundamentally differ, however, because whereas the previous report assessed the ability of PGC-1α to co-activate ERR-α, we have concentrated on the ability of ERR-α to repress PGC-1α. This unique property of ERR-α is consistent with its unique binding site that lies within the inhibitory domain of PGC-1α rather than the classic LXXLL motif (amino acids 143–148), the site of interaction for all previous nuclear receptors. The inhibitory domain within the PGC-1α molecule has previously been demonstrated to be relieved when PGC-1α binds to other transcription factors and DNA (10Puigserver P. Adelmant G., Wu, Z.

Our results are consistent with these previous studies but suggest that repression of PGC-1α-mediated co-activation may also involve binding of additional proteins. Our studies are also consistent with recent speculation based predominantly on genetic arguments suggesting the existence of a specific molecular repressor of PGC-1α (5Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 21Oberkofler H. Esterbauer H. Linnemayr V. Strosberg A.D. Krempler F. Patsch W. J. Biol.

Given the importance of PGC-1α in a number of physiological and pathophysiological conditions, the interaction of ERR-α and PGC-1α would appear to represent a promising therapeutic target. We hypothesized that one potential regulator of the ERR-α-PGC-1α interaction might be the widely used anti-diabetic drug metformin, an agent that inhibits gluconeogenesis by an incompletely understood mechanism. Nonetheless, to date, we have been unable to observe any effect of metformin on either ERR-α transcript levels or repressor activity. 2M. Ichida, S. Nemoto, T. Finkel, unpublished observations. Two previous reports have demonstrated that upstream activation of p38/MAPK stimulates PGC-1α activity presumably by relieving the effects of the repressor (8Knutti D. Kressler D. Kralli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9713-971815Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 21Oberkofler H. Esterbauer H. Linnemayr V. Strosberg A.D. Krempler F. Patsch W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16750-16757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is important to note, however, that in these studies the postulated repressor was not directly identified. It should be noted that still other reports have noted a direct effect of p38/MAPK on PGC-1α protein levels (19Puigserver P. Rhee J. Lin J., Wu, Z. Yoon J.C. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Mootha V.K. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). These latter studies raise the possibility that the effects of p38/MAPK to augment PGC-1α function may not be mediated by altering the interaction with a repressor but rather via a direct on PGC-1α levels or activity. Our results do not support an effect of p38/MAPK on ERR-α-mediated repression, nor did we observe any effects on the overall degree of protein-protein interaction (data not shown). We cannot exclude the possibility that other repressors of PGC-1α could be identified that are regulated by the p38/MAPK pathway. The tissue expression pattern of ERR-α and PGC-1α are similar, suggesting that ERR-α may function in vivo as an important regulator of PGC-1α activity. Release of PGC-1α from ERR-α would presumably be stimulated by conditions that required an alteration in cellular energetics. It is tempting to speculate that the endogenous ligand of ERR-α might therefore somehow be linked to the energetic state of the cell. Previous reports (26Giguere V. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 220-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that ERR-α is also involved in regulating gene products linked to metabolism. Thus, whether PGC-1α and ERR-α appear bound to each other or free might provide a mechanism to coordinate and integrate a wide range of gene products involved in both glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Further studies aimed at understanding the regulation of this interaction should therefore provide important insight into cellular energetics."

We show that α-synuclein drastically lowers basal and staurosporine-stimulated caspase 3 immunoreactivity and activity. This is accompanied by lower DNA fragmentation and reduced number of terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive neurons. Interestingly, α-synuclein also diminishes both p53 expression and transcriptional activity. We demonstrate that the antiapoptotic phenotype displayed by α-synuclein can be fully reversed by the Parkinson's disease-associated dopamine derivative 6-hydroxydopamine. Thus, 6-hydroxydopamine fully abolishes the α-synuclein-mediated reduction of caspase 3 activity and reverses the associated decrease of p53 expression. 6-Hydroxydopamine triggers thioflavin T-positive deposits in α-synuclein, but not mock-transfected TSM1 neurons, and drastically increases α-synuclein immunoreactivity. Altogether, we suggest that α-synuclein lowers the p53-dependent caspase 3 activation of TSM1 in response to apoptotic stimuli and we propose that the natural toxin 6-hydroxydopamine abolishes this antiapoptotic phenotype by triggering α-synuclein aggregation, thereby likely contributing to Parkinson's disease neuropathology.

Parkinson's disease 6-hydroxydopamine phosphate-buffered saline terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staurosporine Parkinson's disease (PD)1 is one of the most common age-related neurodegenerative disease (1Langston J.W.

At the neuropathological level, this disease is mainly characterized by neuronal intracellular inclusions named Lewy bodies (3Bogdanovic N. J. Cell. Mol.

Most of PD cases are of sporadic origin, but relatively recently, it was reported that rare autosomal dominant forms of PD were due to two mutations borne by α-synuclein (6Polymeropoulos M.H.

Vyas S. Javoy-Agid F. Herrero M.T. Michel P.P. Marquez J. Mouatt-Prigent A. Ruberg M. Hirsch E.C. Agid Y. Histol. Histopathol. 1997; 12: 25-31PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hirsch E. Hunot S. Faucheux B.

This pathogenic phenotype could be due to intrinsic proapoptotic properties associated with α-synuclein that would be exacerbated by the aggregating process. Alternatively, the cell death associated with α-synuclein fibrillation could be due to the abolishment of an antiapoptotic tonus corresponding to the physiological function of α-synuclein. We have recently demonstrated that wild-type α-synuclein could protect neuronal cells from staurosporine-induced toxicity (16Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We also established that wild-type α-synuclein drastically inhibited the caspase 3 activation triggered by several apoptotic stimuli, including staurosporine, C2-ceramide, and etoposide in TSM1 transfected neuronal cells expressing wild-type α-synuclein (16Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Of most interest was the observation that the A53T mutation related with familial PD abolished this inhibitory control of caspase 3 activation (16Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Here we have further characterized the antiapoptotic function of α-synuclein, and we show for the first time that α-synuclein inhibition of the staurosporine-induced caspase activation in TSM1 neurons is associated with a drastic lowering of p53 expression and transcriptional activity. Furthermore, we establish that the dopamine-related and PD-associated toxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6OH-DOPA) abolishes the antiapoptotic tonus of α-synuclein by apparently triggering its aggregation. The implication of these observations for PD neuropathology is discussed. HEK293 cells expressing wild-type α-synuclein were obtained after transfection with 2 μg of wild-type or A53T-α-synuclein cDNA in pcDNA3 obtained as detailed previously (17Ancolio K. Alves da Costa C. Uéda K. Checler F. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 285: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Transfectants were screened for their α-synuclein-like immunoreactivity as described below. TSM1 neurons expressing α-synuclein were obtained and cultured as detailed previously (16Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein (50 μg) were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels for the detection of β-tubulin, α-synuclein, active caspase 3, and p53 and then wet-transferred to Hybond-C (Amersham Biosciences) membranes. After transfer, membranes were blocked with nonfat milk and incubated overnight with the following primary antibodies: anti-p53 (mouse monoclonal, Santa Cruz), anti-active caspase 3 (rabbit polyclonal, R & D System), anti-α-synuclein (rabbit polyclonal, Affiniti Laboratory). Immunological complexes were revealed with either an anti-rabbit peroxidase (Immunotech) or with anti-mouse peroxidase (AmershamBiosciences) antibodies depending on the host used for obtention of the primary antibodies described above, followed by electrochemoluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). All protein concentrations were determined as described previously (18Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Mattson M.P. Amson R. Telerman A. Ancolio K. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4043-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The PG13-luciferase and p21 waf-1 -luciferase p53 gene reporter constructs (provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein) have been described previously (19El-Deiry W. Kern S. Pietenpol J. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar, 20El-Deiry W. Tokino T. Velculescu V. Levy D. Parsons R. Trent J. Lin D. Mercer W. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7869) Google Scholar). One μg of PG13-luciferase or p21 waf-1 -luciferase cDNA were co-transfected with 1 μg of a β-galactosidase transfection vector (to normalize transfection efficiencies) in TSM1 neurons. Forty-eight hours after transfection, luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured as described previously (18Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Mattson M.P. Amson R. Telerman A. Ancolio K. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4043-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Caspase-3-like activity was fluorimetrically measured in absence or in the presence of the caspase 3 inhibitor, c-DEVD-al, as extensively detailed previously (18Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Mattson M.P. Amson R. Telerman A. Ancolio K. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4043-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). TSM1 cells were grown in six-well plates and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 0.5 μm staurosporine. Cells were rinsed and incubated for 1 min with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. Cells were then rinsed twice with PBS, harvested, and gently resuspended in PBS, placed on ice, and analyzed using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter scan flow cytometer (program CellQuest, Becton Dickinson). Red fluorescence due to propidium iodide staining of DNA was expressed on a logarithmic scale simultaneously to the forward scatter of the particles. A hundred-thousand events were counted on the scatter gate. The number of apoptotic cells is expressed as a percentage of the total number of events as extensively described previously (18Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Mattson M.P. Amson R. Telerman A. Ancolio K. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4043-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For DNA nick end labeling, cells were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS), rinsed in PBS, left overnight in 70% ethanol, and then processed for the dUTP nick end labeling TUNEL technique according to manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Staining was assessed with a peroxidase-conjugated antibody and revealed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate. The DNA label corresponds to black spots. All cells were additionally labeled with erythrosine B. For thioflavin T (Sigma) labeling, stably wild-type α-synuclein and mock-transfected cells were cultured on coverslips and treated or not with 0.2 mm6OH-DOPA. After 8 h of treatment, cells were fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS solution for 30 min, incubated 8 min with a 0.05% thioflavin T solution, and washed three times with PBS before mounting with a Vectashield mounting medium for fluorescence (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Images were analyzed using a Leitz Aristoplan Wetzlar Germany fluorescence microscope coupled to a numeric Nikon camera photo apparatus. Stably transfected TSM1 neurons overexpressing wild-type α-synuclein (Fig. 1 A) reduce by 40 and 60%, respectively, the basal and staurosporine (STS)-induced caspase 3-like activity (Table I). We established that these observations were not cell-specific as these results were also observed in HEK293 cells overexpressing α-synuclein (Table I). α-Synuclein-associated reduced caspase activation in TSM1 neurons was accompanied by a drastically lower immunoreactivity of active caspase 3 in both basal and STS-stimulated conditions (Fig. 1 B). This α-synuclein-induced lowering of caspase activity and immunoreactivity was indeed associated with a reduction of apoptotic cell stigmata. Thus, α-synuclein expression clearly reduced the number of apoptotic nuclei as shown by TUNEL analysis (Fig. 2 A) in both basal and STS-induced conditions. In the latter condition, α-synuclein reduces the number of TUNEL-positive neurons by about 75% (Fig. 2 B). This was correlated by an about 50% lowering of propidium iodide incorporation (Fig. 3), indicating a reduced DNA fragmentation in α-synuclein-expressing TSM1 cells.Table Iα-Synuclein (α-Syn) lowers basal and staurosporine-stimulated caspase 3 activity in TSM1 neurons and HEK293 cellsHEK293TSM1Mockα-Syn (%)Mockα-Syn (%)Basal23,735 ± 263215,036 ± 1206 (63.3)29,530 ± 556318,004 ± 4230 (61)STS52,109 ± 395234,924 ± 2997 (67)127,759 ± 339751,042 ± 4052 (40) Open table in a new tab Figure 2α-Synuclein (α-synor α-SYN on figure) expression decreases the number of basal and staurosporine-stimulated TUNEL-positive TSM1 neurons.

By means of a specific p53 reporter gene construct (19El-Deiry W. Kern S. Pietenpol J. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar), we established that α-synuclein-expressing cells display lower p53 transcriptional activity (Fig. 4 B). This was corroborated by a concomitant decrease in the promotor activation of p21 waf-1 (Fig. 4 C), a well characterized downstream effector gene of p53 (20El-Deiry W. Tokino T. Velculescu V. Levy D. Parsons R. Trent J. Lin D. Mercer W. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7869) Google Scholar). Interestingly, α-synuclein overexpression was also associated with a diminished p53-like immunoreactivity (Fig. 4 A), indicating that both p53 expression and transcriptional activity were reduced by α-synuclein expression in TSM1 neurons. Several lines of evidence indicate that 6OH-DOPA, a natural oxidized derivative of dopamine, could act as a cell toxin and could contribute to the neuronal degenerescence occurring notably in the substantia nigra of PD-affected brains. We established that 6OH-DOPA increased caspase 3 activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 5 A). Interestingly, 60H-DOPA abolishes the inhibitory control of caspase 3 activity by wild-type α-synuclein (Fig. 5 B). It should be noted here that we confirm that the A53T pathogenic mutation abolishes the α-synuclein-mediated inhibitory control of caspase 3 activity in both basal and staurosporine-stimulated conditions (TableII). However, this mutation does not appear to further potentiate the 6OH-DOPA-induced increase of caspase 3 activity observed in mock-transfected cells (Table II).Table IIEffect of 6OH-DOPA and staurosporine on caspase activity in wt- and A53T-α-synuclein (α-Syn) expressing neuronsMockα-SynA53T-α-SynBasal61,991 ± 1733 (n = 4)39,149 ± 1380 (n = 4)64,807 ± 1176 (n = 4)STS197,048 ± 18,449 (n = 3)61,195 ± 915 (n = 3)275,584 ± 9720 (n = 3)6OH-DOPA139,280 ± 6042 (n = 6)153,908 ± 11,210 (n = 6)121,552 ± 13,212 (n = 6) Open table in a new tab Interestingly, 6OH-DOPA reverses the α-synuclein-induced decrease in p53 immunoreactivity (Fig. 5 C). This effect was accompanied by a time- and dose-dependent increase of α-synuclein-like immunoreactivity (Fig. 6). It is important to note that staurosporine appeared unable to modify the α-synuclein immunoreactivity (Fig. 6). 6OH-DOPA treatment of TSM1 cells also led to thioflavin T-positive deposits in α-synuclein, but not mock-transfected TSM1 cells (Fig. 7), suggesting that the dopaminergic toxin could trigger α-synuclein aggregation, as suggested by previous reports (21Soto-Otero R.

Overall, our data suggest that α-synuclein displays neuronal p53-dependent control of caspase 3-like activity and that 6OH-DOPA could abolish this antiapoptotic phenotype by triggering α-synuclein aggregation.Figure 76OH-DOPA triggers thioflavin T-positive aggregates in α-synuclein-expressing TSM1 neurons.

Schmidt M.L. Lee V.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (5871) Google Scholar). This protein, when mutated, appears responsible for a subset of autosomal dominant forms of the disease (6Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos E.S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiadou A. Papapetropoulos T. Johnston W.G. Lazzarini A.M. Duvoisin R.C. Di lorio G. Golbe L.I. Nussbaum R.L.

Genet. 1998; 18: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have suggested that α-synuclein could modulate cell death, but data are somewhat puzzling in the field. For instance, it appears that α-synuclein expression is increased in the target injury model (23Kholodilov N.G. Neystat M., Oo, T.F., Lo, S.E. Larsen K.E. Sulzer D. Burke R.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2586-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), but is it a cell compensatory response, or alternatively is α-synuclein expression related with/responsible for the observed cellular toxicity? In line with an antiapoptotic physiological function of α-synuclein, it has been reported that α-synuclein was virtually always associated with normal neurons but not with those exhibiting apoptotic stigmata (24Kholodinov N.G., Oo, T.F. Burke R.E. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 275: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Leeet al. (25Lee M. Hyun D.-H. Halliwell B. Jenner P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) demonstrated that wild-type, but not mutated, α-synuclein delayed cell death triggered by serum withdrawal. Finally, Hashimoto et al. (26Hashimoto M. Hsu L.J. Rockenstein E. Takenouchi T. Mallory M. Masliah E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11465-11472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) observed that α-synuclein protected neuronal cells against oxidative stress. We have shown previously that in neurons, α-synuclein could protect cells from various proapoptotic stimuli and, more precisely, could drastically diminish the caspase 3 activation triggered by several proapoptotic effectors (16Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Particularly interesting was the fact that this antiapoptotic phenotype was abolished by the A53T mutation responsible for some familial cases of Parkinson's disease (16Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Here, we further establish that α-synuclein lowers the staurosporine-induced caspase activation, not only in neurons but also in human HEK293 cells. This lower cellular susceptibility to apoptotic effectors was also illustrated by a reduced DNA fragmentation and decreased number of apoptotic cells as shown by tunel analysis. We demonstrate for the first time that the antiapoptotic function of α-synuclein is mediated by a drastic decrease in both p53 immunoreactivity and transcriptional activity. The latter paradigm was further documented by the ability of α-synuclein to almost totally block the transcription of p21 waf-1 , a well established downtream target of p53 transcriptional activity (20El-Deiry W. Tokino T. Velculescu V. Levy D. Parsons R. Trent J. Lin D. Mercer W. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7869) Google Scholar). The involvement of p53 in the control of cell death in other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease is striking. Thus, p53 expression is associated with a decrease in the expression of the antiapoptotic protein presenilin 1 (27Roperch J.-P. Alvaro V. Prieur S. Tyunder M. Nemani M. Lethrosne F. Piouffre L. Gendron M.-C. Israeli D. Dausset J. Oren M. Amson R. Telerman A. Nature Medicine. 1998; 4: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Conversely, we showed that presenilin 2 and its mutated counterpart trigger p53-dependent caspase 3 activation in the same cell systems (18Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Mattson M.P. Amson R. Telerman A. Ancolio K. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4043-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, the p53 oncogene could be seen as a common denominator that mediates the cell death pathway that can be up- or down-regulated according to the physiopathological situation. It is interesting to underline the fact that each time α-synuclein was associated with a proapoptotic phenotype, it was in experimental conditions where the protein was highly overexpressed, i.e.in transgenic animals or in affected brains displaying Lewy bodies (13Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Quinn S.M. Zhang B. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 521-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar,28Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I.

Rockenstein E. Mante M. Mallory M. Masliah E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with the fact that several physiological functions of α-synuclein appeared impaired by aggregation as was shown for its chaperoning properties and ability to bind to vesicles (for reviews, see Refs. 31Suh Y.-H. Checler F. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 469-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar and 32Alves da Costa, C. (2002) Curr. Mol. Med., in pressGoogle Scholar). The fact that aggregation appears exacerbated by Parkinson's disease-associated pathogenic mutations clearly reinforces the view that aggregation is closely associated with the pathology. That this also impairs a physiological function controlled by α-synuclein remained a matter of speculation. Therefore, our demonstration that 6OH-DOPA abolished the antiapoptotic tonus triggered by α-synuclein (Fig. 5) appears of interest. It should be noted here that the extent of activation of caspase by 6OH-DOPA and stauroporine is similar in mock-transfected cells but that only 6OH-DOPA is able to reverse the antiapoptotic phenotype triggered by α-synuclein. The similar extent of caspase activation therefore indicates that the 6OH-DOPA-mediated effect is not due to a nonspecific toxic hyperactivation of caspase 3 that would have led to abolish α-synuclein inhibitory tonus. This is further emphasized by the fact that 6OH-DOPA, but not staurosporine, increases α-synuclein-like immunoreactivity (see “Results”). 6OH-DOPA is a selective catecholaminergic neurotoxin that is not only used as a pharmacological agent able to trigger PD-like stigmata (33Sauer H. Ortel W.H. Neuroscience. 1994; 59: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 34Przedborski S. Levivier M. Jiang H. Ferreira M. Jackson-Levis V. Donaldson D. Togasaki D.M.

Brain Res. 2002; 938: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) but also likely corresponds to a natural dopaminergic catabolite that accumulates in Parkinson's disease-affected brains (37Curtius H.C. Wolhensberger M. Steinmann B. Redweik S. J. Chromatogr. 1974; 99: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and that appears to strongly contribute to this pathology (38Irwin I. Langston J.W. Ellenberg J.H. Koller W.C. Langston J.W. Etiology of Parkinson's Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 153-201Google Scholar,39Jellinger K. Linert L. Kienzl E. Herlinger E. Youdim M.B.H. J. Neural. Transm. 1995; 46: 297-314Google Scholar). 6OH-DOPA abolishes in a time- and dose-dependent manner the α-synuclein-induced lowering in caspase 3 activity and p53 expression (Fig. 5). This was accompanied by a selective occurrence of thioflavin T-positive aggregates in α-synuclein-expressing neurons but not in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 6). Therefore, we propose that the physiological function of α-synuclein would be to control the level of caspase 3 activity through the regulation of p53 expression and transcriptional activity. We suggest that in Parkinson's disease, accumulation of 6OH-DOPA leads to α-synuclein aggregation, thereby impairing its physiological function and contributing to subsequent proapoptotic phenotype observed in this disease. The mechanism by which 6OH-DOPA abolished the antiapoptotic phenotype of α-synuclein remains to be established. However, it has been shown that 6OH-DOPA produces hydrogen peroxide upon autooxidation (21Soto-Otero R. Méndez-Alvarez E. Hermida-Ameijeira A. Munoz-Patino A.-M. Labandeira-Garcia J.-L. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and that this oxidant could generate free radicals able to trigger α-synuclein aggregation (22Kim K.-S. Choi S.-Y. Kwon H.-Y. Won M.-H. Kang T.-C. Kang J.-H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Another theoretical possibility could be the nitration of α-synuclein due to 6OH-DOPA reaction with nitric oxide (40Riobo N.A. Schöpfer F.J. Boveris A.D. Cadenas E. Poderoso J.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the latter hypothesis remains unlikely, because, in contrast to the in vitro conditions, the low physiological O2concentration should theoretically lead to nonsignificant above reaction (40Riobo N.A. Schöpfer F.J. Boveris A.D. Cadenas E. Poderoso J.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Particularly interesting was a recent paper indicating that α-synuclein toxicity could be selectively associated with dopaminergic cells in vivo, while the protein appears neuroprotective in other brain areas (41Xu J. Kao S.-Y. Lee F.J.S. Song W. Jin L.-W. Yankner B. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 600-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Our data agree with this hypothesis, since α-synuclein displays an antiapoptotic phenotype in TSM1 that is of neocortical origin (42Chun J. Jaenisch R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 304-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), i.e. not dopaminergic neurons. However, these cells could also respond to exogenous toxic stimulus such as 6OH-DOPA as likely dopaminergic neurons do. Thus, the cellular machinery underlying α-synuclein physiological function appears to occur in all neuronal cells. However, only neurons of the dopaminergic pathway altered in their dopamine/catabolites would lead to the selective neurodegenerative features occurring in Parkinson's disease. Whether the alteration of α-synuclein physiological function could contribute to other degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, where in some cases, Lewy bodies enriched in α-synuclein are numerous in nondopaminergic pathways, remains a possibility.

We have examined the effect of four of these mutations on AMPK activity. The mutant γ2 polypeptides are all able to form functional complexes following co-expression with either α1β1 or α2β1 in mammalian cells. None of the mutations caused any detectable change in the phosphorylation of threonine 172 within the α subunit of AMPK. Consequently, in the absence of an appropriate stimulus the mutant complexes, like the wild-type complex, exist in an inactive form demonstrating that the mutations do not lead to constitutive activation of the kinase. Three of the mutations we studied occur within the cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) domains of γ2. Two of these mutations lead to a marked decrease in AMP dependence, whereas the third reduces AMP sensitivity. These findings suggest that the CBS domains play an important role in AMP-binding within the complex. In contrast, a fourth mutation, which lies between adjacent CBS domains, has no significant effect on AMPK activity in vitro. These results indicate that mutations in γ2 have different effects on AMPK function, suggesting that they may lead to abnormal development of the heart through distinct mechanisms.

AMP-activated protein kinase AMP-activated protein kinase kinase the synthetic peptide HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR threonine residue 172 within the α subunit of AMPK cystathionine β-synthase The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)1 is the central component of a protein kinase cascade that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of energy metabolism (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). In response to activation following an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio, AMPK phosphorylates a number of downstream targets culminating in the switching off of energy (ATP)-utilizing pathways and the switching on of energy-generating pathways (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 2Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Activation of AMPK is complex and involves direct allosteric activation of the enzyme by AMP as well as phosphorylation, catalyzed by an upstream kinase, AMPK kinase (AMPKK) (3Hawley S.A.

AMPK is a heterotrimeric complex, consisting of a catalytic subunit (α) and two regulatory subunits (β and γ) (5Stapleton D. Gao G. Michell B.J. Widmer J. Mitchelhill K. Teh T. House C.M.

Although there is compelling evidence indicating that formation of the heterotrimeric complex is necessary for significant kinase activity (6Woods A. Cheung P.C.F. Smith F.C. Davison M.D. Scott J.

In addition, at present our understanding of the physiological relevance of the different subunit isoforms is very limited. Several groups have reported recently the identification of six different mutations in the γ2 subunit from patients with cardiac hypertrophy and associated electrophysiologic abnormalties (11Blair E. Redwood C. Ashrafian H. Ostman-Smith I. Watkins H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1215-1220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Gollob M.H. Green M.S. Tang A.S.L. Gollob T. Karibe A. Hassan A. Ahmad F.

Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). All six mutations result in amino acid substitutions and are located within the C-terminal half of the protein. The mutations lead to the development of aberrant conduction systems, including pre-excitation, characteristic of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (15Packard J.M. Graettinger J.S. Graybiel A. Circulation. 1954; 10: 384-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and in all but one case, the mutations also result in severe cardiac hypertrophy. No evidence of cardiac hypertrophy, however, was found in individuals carrying a mutation of arginine to glycine at residue 531 (R531G) (13Gollob M.H. Seger J.J. Gollob T.N. Tapscott T. Gonzales O. Bachiniski L. Roberts R. Circulation. 2001; 104: 3030-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). At present, the molecular mechanisms by which mutations in γ2 lead to abnormal conduction and hypertrophy are unknown. Interestingly, however, enlarged myocytes from an individual with a mutation in γ2 were found to have vacuoles containing glycogen derivatives, suggesting that the hypertrophy may be a result of increased carbohydrate storage (14Arad M. Benson D.W. Perez-Atayde A.R. McKenna W.J. Sparks E.A. Kanter R.J. McGarry K. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). A mechanism involving increased glycogen storage is attractive, because an arginine to glutamine mutation at residue 226 (R226Q) in the γ3isoform causes excess glycogen accumulation in pig skeletal muscle (16Milan D. Jeon J.T. Looft C. Amarger V. Robic A. Thelander M. Rogel-Gaillard C. Paul S. Iannuccelli N. Rask L. Ronne H. Lundström K. Reinsch N. Gellin J. Kalm E., Le Roy P. Chardon P. Andersson L. Science. 2000; 288: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Three AMPK γ isoforms have been identified and all share a highly conserved C-terminal region of ∼300 amino acids (9Cheung P.C.F. Salt I.P. Davies S.P. Hardie D.G. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Within this conserved region are four cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) domains (17Bateman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 12-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). CBS domains have been identified in a wide range of proteins, but their function remains unknown. Mutations within the single CBS domain of human cystathionine β-synthase, from which the acronym stems, cause homocystinuria (18Kluijtmans L.A. Boers G.H. Stevens E.M. Renier W.O. Kraus J.P. Trijbels F.J.M. van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. Blom H.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Four of the mutations in γ2, together with the R226Q mutation in the γ3 isoform in pig, occur within the CBS domains. These findings raise the possibility that the CBS domains in AMPK may have an important functional role. It was reported that AMPK activity in skeletal muscle isolated from pigs harboring the R226Q mutation in γ3 was lower than that in the corresponding wild-type pigs (16Milan D. Jeon J.T. Looft C. Amarger V. Robic A. Thelander M. Rogel-Gaillard C. Paul S. Iannuccelli N. Rask L. Ronne H. Lundström K. Reinsch N. Gellin J. Kalm E., Le Roy P. Chardon P. Andersson L. Science. 2000; 288: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). In that study, however, total AMPK activity, rather than γ3-specific activity was measured, making interpretation of the results difficult. In another study (19Hamilton S.R. Stapleton D. O'Donnell J.B. Kung J.T. Dalal S. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the arginine residue in γ1(Arg70) equivalent to Arg226 in γ3 was mutated to a glutamine residue in an effort to mimic the γ3 mutation. It was reported that this mutation caused a marked increase in AMPK activity and rendered it largely AMP independent (19Hamilton S.R. Stapleton D. O'Donnell J.B. Kung J.T. Dalal S. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The identification of mutations in γ2 that lead to severe heart defects in humans has important implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and ventricular pre-excitation. The lack of information regarding the impact of these mutations on AMPK activity prompted us to carry out our current study. We report here the effect of four different mutations in γ2, three that occur within the CBS domains and one that lies between adjacent domains, on the activity of AMPK in mammalian cells. None of the mutations in γ2 that we studied cause a detectable increase in the phosphorylation of threonine 172 within the α subunit of AMPK (Thr172) compared with wild-type γ2 complexes. Thus, in the absence of an appropriate stimulus to promote phosphorylation of Thr172, the mutant complexes, like the wild-type complex, exist in a relatively inactive form. These results demonstrate that the γ2 mutations do not lead to constitutive activation of the kinase. Two of the three mutations occurring within the CBS domains cause a marked decrease in AMP activation of the kinase, whereas a third mutation in the CBS domain leads to a doubling of the A 0.5 for AMP. In contrast, the leucine insertion mutation that occurs between CBS domains 1 and 2 has no significant effect on AMP sensitivity in vitro. These results suggest that the pathways by which mutations in γ2 lead to the pathogenesis of heart disease involve different mechanisms. Oligonucleotides spanning the sequence to be mutated, and including the appropriate base changes, were used to amplify cDNA encoding AMPK γ2(9Cheung P.C.F. Salt I.P. Davies S.P. Hardie D.G. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) using a PCR-based strategy as described previously (20Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). A sequence encoding a FLAG epitope tag (amino acid sequence DYKDDDDK) was inserted immediately after the initiating methionine codon to facilitate detection of the γ2 subunit. All cDNAs were cloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) and sequenced completely on both strands to ensure their authenticity. Plasmid DNA was prepared using a Qiagen maxi-prep kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. CCL13 cells were co-transfected with cDNA (10 μg/plasmid) encoding either α1 or α2, and β1 and γ2 (all cDNAs cloned into pCDNA3) by calcium phosphate precipitation (21Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). The α1 and α2 cDNAs encode a Myc epitope tag (amino acid sequence EQKLISEEDL) at the N terminus (20Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection by one of two methods. In the first method (rapid lysis), the culture medium was removed and 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) immediately added to the cells. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 1 min at 4 °C) and the supernatant fraction used for subsequent analysis. In some cases, cells were submitted to hyperosmotic stress, by addition of sorbitol (final concentration of 0.6 m) to the culture medium and incubated for 30 min immediately prior to lysis. In the second method, cells were allowed to become anoxic thereby leading to activation of AMPK in response to an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio. In this method, following removal of the culture media the cells were briefly rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were removed from the plate in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA and collected by centrifugation. The resulting cell pellet was re-suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. AMPK activity was determined in immune complexes isolated by immunoprecipitation from cell lysates using an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (clone 9E10 (22Evans G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar)). Cell lysates (0.1 ml for α1 containing complexes and 0.5 ml for α2 complexes) were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 10 μl of a 50% (w/v) slurry of anti-Myc antibody bound to protein G-Sepharose. Immune complexes were precipitated by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 1 min and washed 3 times with lysis buffer prior to assay. Kinase activity was measured by the incorporation of 32P-radiolabeled phosphate into the SAMS peptide as described previously (23Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of AMP as described in the figure legends. Activities are calculated as picomole of phosphate incorporated into the SAMS peptide per minute per mg of total protein. AMP dependence curves were generated using the equationv = b + {[(s ×b) − b] × [AMP]}/(A 0.5 + [AMP]), where sis the relative stimulation, b is the basal activity, andA 0.5 is the concentration of AMP giving half-maximal stimulation, using Graphpad Prism software. Proteins present in the immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked by incubation in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 5% low fat milk powder for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were probed with an anti-Myc (22Evans G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar), anti-AMPKβ (6Woods A. Cheung P.C.F. Smith F.C. Davison M.D. Scott J. Beri R.K.

The blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with either goat anti-mouse IgG (for anti-Myc and anti-FLAG blots) or donkey anti-rabbit IgG (AMPKβ and AMPK phospho-Thr172), followed by extensive washing. Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A mutation in Snf4 cDNA was introduced by PCR to alter arginine residue 294 to glycine. snf4Δ mutant yeast (strain MCY2634) were transformed with either wild-type or mutated Snf4 in pGAD424 (Clontech) and selected by growth on media lacking tryptophan. Transformants were patched onto solid media containing either 2% glucose, 2% raffinose or 5% glycerol, and growth was determined after 5 days incubation at 30 °C. Interactions using the two-hybrid system were performed following transformation of SFY526 yeast (Clontech) with Snf1 cDNA in pGBT9 (Clontech) and either wild-type or mutated Snf4 in pGAD424. Transformants were grown to mid-log phase in selective media (lacking tryptophan and leucine) containing either 2% glucose or 2% raffinose as the sole carbon source. β-Galactosidase activity was determined in permeabilized cells as described previously (6Woods A. Cheung P.C.F. Smith F.C. Davison M.D. Scott J. Beri R.K. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10282-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and expressed in Miller units (24Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed unpaired Student's ttest. In an attempt to elucidate the effect of mutations within the γ2 subunit of AMPK we determined AMPK activity following co-expression of wild-type and mutant forms of γ2 with either α1β1 or α2β1 in mammalian cells. The locations of these mutations within γ2 are shown in Fig. 1 A. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of the CBS domains of γ2 (19Hamilton S.R. Stapleton D. O'Donnell J.B. Kung J.T. Dalal S. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) reveals that three of the mutations, R302Q, H383R, and R531G, occur at, or adjacent, to the equivalent position of the R226Q mutation in pig γ3 (Fig. 1 B). The fourth mutation generates an insertion of a leucine residue (L ins) between residues 350 and 351 in the region linking CBS domains 1 and 2. In the absence of an appropriate stimulus AMPK exists in a relatively inactive form. Numerous studies have shown that activation of AMPK requires the phosphorylation of threonine 172 within the α subunit (Thr172) catalyzed by an upstream kinase, AMPKK (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that AMPK is activated by anoxia in cultured cells, which can occur as a consequence of the method used for harvesting the cells (25Daniel T.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 629-638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AMPK activity in anoxic cells was readily detected in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates for all the α1 complexes measured in the presence of 200 μm AMP (Fig. 2 A), although the activity of the R302Q, H383R, and R531G mutants was approximately half that of the wild-type enzyme. Similarly, following expression with α2, AMPK activity was present in all the γ2complexes and again the activity of the R302Q, H383R, and R531G mutants was reduced relative to the wild-type complex (Fig. 2 B). The lower activity of the α2 complexes compared with the α1 complexes is consistent with the results of a previous study examining the activity of γ1-containing complexes (20Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of the AMPK subunits present in the immunoprecipitates revealed similar levels of expression of the complexes indicating that the changes in activity were not because of differences in the level of expression, or association, of the different complexes. Furthermore, there was no obvious difference in the phosphorylation of Thr172, as judged by Western blotting, indicating that the reduction in activity of the mutant complexes is not because of decreased phosphorylation. As expected, virtually no AMPK activity or expression was detectable in immunoprecipitates isolated from untransfected cells. In contrast to anoxic cells, AMPK isolated from rapidly lysed cells is relatively inactive because the intracellular ratio of AMP/ATP remains low (25Daniel T.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 629-638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 3, the activity of α1-containing AMPK, measured in the presence of 200 μm AMP, isolated from rapidly lysed cells is very low in either wild-type or mutant γ2 complexes. Similar results were obtained for α2-containing complexes (results not shown). Consistent with the low activity of the complexes, no phosphorylation of Thr172 was detected in immunoprecipitates isolated from rapidly lysed cells, despite similar levels of expression of the complexes determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the γ2mutations do not have any significant effect on the phosphorylation and activation of AMPK by AMPKK under basal conditions. We next investigated the effect of the mutations on the allosteric activation of the kinase by AMP. Fig. 4,A and B, shows the activity of α1(Fig. 4 A) and α2 (Fig. 4 B) complexes isolated from anoxic cells measured in vitro in the presence or absence of 200 μm AMPK. Qualitatively similar results were obtained for both isoforms, although the degree of stimulation by AMP was slightly greater for the α1complexes compared with the α2 complexes. Based on these results, the activity of the kinase measured in the presence, relative to the absence, of 200 μm AMP is shown in TableI. As can be seen, the R302Q, H383R, and R531G mutations all cause a significant reduction in AMP stimulation measured at 200 μm AMP. This is particularly evident with the R531G mutation, which almost completely abolishes activation by AMP. In contrast, the L ins mutation did not cause a significant difference in AMP stimulation measured at 200 μm AMP. It is noteworthy that following expression with α1, the activity of the R531G mutant is increased relative to the other complexes when measured in the absence of AMP (Fig. 4 A). This is unlikely to be because of an increase in the phosphorylation state of Thr172 because we did not detect any change in phosphorylation of this residue between the different complexes (see Fig. 2 A). One potential explanation for the increased activity is that the R531G mutation reduces the inhibitory effect of ATP on the kinase. Previous studies have shown that the allosteric activation of AMPK is antagonized by ATP (4Hardie D.G. Salt I.P. Hawley S.A. Davies S.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) suggesting that both AMP and ATP bind at the same site. It is possible, therefore, that mutations that affect AMP-binding could also affect ATP binding. If this were the case for the R531G mutation it could account for the increased activity observed in the absence of AMP. We have not been able to address this possibility directly because of the fact that measurement of AMPK utilizes radiolabeled ATP in the assay, which raises a number of technical problems associated with varying ATP concentrations.Table IEffect of γ2 mutations on AMP dependenceγ2 MutationAMPK activity in the presence of 200 μm AMP (relative to activity in absence of AMP)α1α2Wild-type13.9 ± 2.010.3 ± 2.2R302Q3.0 ± 0.2 (***)1.6 ± 0.2 (**)H383R4.7 ± 0.5 (***)4.6 ± 0.6 (*)R531G1.1 ± 0.1 (***)0.9 ± 0.1 (**)L ins12 ± 0.8 (NS)1-aNS, not significant.6.2 ± 1 (NS)1-aNS, not significant.The activity of α1- and α2-containing complexes measured in the presence of 200 μm AMP relative to the absence of AMP is shown.

Significant differences from the corresponding wild-type values are shown in parentheses and denoted by: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.005, respectively. To investigate in more detail the effect of the mutations on AMP activation, α1 complexes were assayed over a range of AMP concentrations (Fig. 4 C) and the concentration of AMP giving half-maximal stimulation (A 0.5) was calculated. For the wild-type complex an A 0.5 of 77 ± 17 μm (n = 3) was determined. The R302Q mutation (A 0.5 76 ± 14 μm;n = 3) and L ins mutation (A 0.5109 ± 20 μm; n = 3) had no significant effect on this parameter. The H383R mutation, however, causes a large and statistically significant increase in theA 0.5 value (177 ± 13 μm;n = 3, p < 0.05) compared with the wild-type, accounting for the decrease in AMP stimulation observed at 200 μm AMP (Fig. 4 A and Table I). At 500 μm AMP the activity of the H383R mutant is similar to that of the wild-type (Fig. 4 C), indicating that although the AMP sensitivity is reduced, the AMP dependence is not significantly affected. The R531G mutation almost completely abolishes AMP stimulation and we were unable to determine accurately theA 0.5 for AMP for this complex. These results strengthen the hypothesis that the CBS domains play an important role in the allosteric activation of the kinase by AMP, but do not reveal the mechanism by which the L ins mutation alters AMPK function. We recently reported that AMPK is activated by two distinct pathways, one that involves changes in the AMP/ATP ratio and one that is independent of this ratio (26Fryer L.G. Patel A.P. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25226-25232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Hyperosmotic stress activates AMPK, concomitant with an increase in the phosphorylation of Thr172, without any detectable change in the AMP/ATP ratio (26Fryer L.G. Patel A.P. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25226-25232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The finding that two of the γ2 mutations have a marked effect on AMP dependence prompted us to investigate the activity of the γ2 complexes following hyperosmotic shock. Fig. 5 shows that hyperosmotic stress (0.6m sorbitol) increases α1 activity in both the wild-type and mutant complexes relative to control cells. None of the mutations had any detectable effect on Thr172 phosphorylation (data not shown). The effect of the mutations becomes evident, however, when comparing activity from hyperosmotically stressed cells in the presence and absence of AMP. The activity of the R302Q and R531G mutants is increased relative to wild-type when assayed in the absence of AMP, whereas the activity of the H383R and L ins mutants is the same as wild-type. The increased activity of the R302Q and R531G mutants may be because of a reduction in inhibition by ATP as described previously. In the presence of AMP, the activity of the R302Q, H383R, and R531G mutants is approximately half that of the wild-type and L ins complexes, similar to the situation observed in anoxic cells. AMPK is structurally and functionally related to the SNF1 kinase inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). Yeast contain a single α subunit (Snf1), a single γ subunit (Snf4), and three isoforms of the β subunit (Sip1, Sip2, and Gal83). Like the AMPK γ subunit isoforms, Snf4 contains four CBS domains. Alignment of the CBS domains in γ2 and Snf4 reveals that arginine 531 in γ2 is conserved in Snf4 (arginine 294), whereas the residues equivalent to arginine 302 and histidine 383 are not conserved (19Hamilton S.R. Stapleton D. O'Donnell J.B. Kung J.T. Dalal S. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We mutated arginine 294 to glycine in Snf4 and transformed a yeast snf4 deletion strain with wild-type or mutant Snf4. Both wild-type Snf4 and Snf4R294G were able to rescue the growth ofsnf4 yeast on glycerol and raffinose media (Fig. 6 A), indicating that the mutated Snf4 is capable of forming a functionally competent SNF1 complex in vivo. Snf4 interacts with Snf1, and this interaction is markedly increased in glucose-deprived cells (27Jiang R. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).

FGF-2 occurs in isoforms, at a low molecular weight of 18,000 and at least two high molecular weight forms (21,000 and 23,000), representing alternative translation products from a single mRNA. In addition to its role as an extracellular ligand, FGF-2 localizes to the nuclei of cells. Here we show differential localization of the 18- and 23-kDa isoforms in the nuclei of rat Schwann cells. Whereas the 18-kDa isoform was found in the nucleoli, nucleoplasm, and Cajal bodies, the 23-kDa isoform localized in a punctuate pattern and associates with mitotic chromosomes suggesting different functional roles of the isoforms. Moreover, we show here that the 23-kDa FGF-2 isoform co-immunoprecipitates specifically with the survival of motor neuron protein (SMN). SMN is an assembly and recycling factor of the splicing machinery and locates to the cytoplasm, the nucleoplasm, and nuclear gems, where it co-localizes with 23-kDa FGF-2.

The data show that nuclear localization is a general phenomenon for some growth factors, suggesting nuclear functions independent of the function as extracellular factors.FGF-2 is a member of the FGF family, which has been shown to mediate a variety of biological processes during development and in the adult organism, including mitogenesis, angiogenesis, chemotaxis, mesoderm induction, and differentiation of various mesoderm- and neuroectoderm-derived cells. FGF-2 as an extracellular ligand is able to bind to high affinity tyrosine transmembrane receptors (FGF receptors, FGFR). FGF-2 has been shown to bind to all four known FGFR, however, with distinct affinities (3Ornitz D.M., Xu, J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol.

The isoforms exert different biological effects when overexpressed in different cell types. Specific effects seen by the 23-kDa isoform but not the 18-kDa isoform after overexpression are reduced spreading of pancreatic cancer cells (4Escaffit F. Estival A. Bertrand C. Vaysse N. Hollande E.

We have previously shown that in PC12 cells and rat immortalized Schwann cells, cell growth and morphology are altered after transfection with constructs coding for 18- and 23-kDa FGF-2, respectively (9Meisinger C.

In this study we extend our previous data by analyses of subcellular localization and interaction of FGF-2 in immortalized rat Schwann cells.The FGF-2 isoforms are known to localize to the nucleus, however, the 18-kDa isoform has been found also in the cytoplasm (8Pasumarthi K.B.

The individual isoforms were reported to localize to the nucleoli (18Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B.

The aim of the present study was to analyze the localization of FGF-2 isoforms in more detail in other nuclear substructures by means of tagging with fluorescent proteins (EGFP and DsRed) and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the nuclear localization of FGF-2 isoforms. Our results revealed a differential localization of the isoforms in nuclear substructures of rat immortalized Schwann cells and, in addition, identified two nuclear localization sequences in the 23-kDa isoform. A further important and interesting result in our study is the first presentation of a co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization of the 23-kDa FGF-2 high molecular weight isoform with the survival of motor neuron protein (SMN), which is mutated in patients with spinal muscular atrophy. This study provides new insights into the physiological functions of FGF-2 in the nucleus.DISCUSSIONImmunolocalization studies and Western blotting after cell fractionation have previously demonstrated the existence of FGF-2 in the nucleus (10Grothe C.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 203-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In this study we labeled FGF-2 isoforms by fusion constructs with the red fluorescent protein DsRed. Because no specific antibodies against the individual isoform are available, we used this approach, although the possibility of artificial localization patterns because of overexpression of the tagged proteins cannot be completely excluded. One previous study shows a 18-kDa FGF-2/GFP fusion protein localizing to the nuclei in corneal endothelial cells, however, the nuclear substructures enriched in this isoform have not been described explicitly (28Choi J., Ko, M.K. Kay E.P. Mol. Vis. 2000; 6: 222-231PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate differential localization of FGF-2 isoforms in the nucleus, localization in nuclear bodies, and a specific protein-protein interaction of 23-kDa FGF-2. For several growth factors, apart from FGF-2, localization in the cell nucleus is well known including platelet-derived growth factor (29Collins T. Bonthron D.T. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1987; 328: 621-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), FGF-1 (30Zhan X., Hu, X. Friedman S. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, only limited information about their specific nuclear roles exists. Additionally, nuclear localization of the respective receptors has been described as in the case of FGFR-1 (34Stachowiak E.K. Maher P.A. Tucholski J. Mordechai E. Joy A. Moffett J. Coons S.

Nuclear EGF receptor acts as a putative transcription factor and binds to the promoter region of cyclin D1in vivo (37Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar).In this study, the 23-kDa FGF-2 isoform has been found to be putatively chromatin-associated. At present, it is unclear if specific chromatin components can be bound by FGF-2 in vivo, however, an association with histone H1 and an influence on chromatin compaction of the FGF-2 high molecular weight isoforms has been reported previously (12Bouche G. Gas N. Prats H. Baldin V. Tauber J.P. Teissie J. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6770-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 38Sun G. Doble B.W. Sun J.M. Fandrich R.R.

For the 18-kDa FGF-2 isoform we demonstrate in this study for the first time the localization in Cajal bodies. Recent data suggest a role of Cajal bodies in the maturation and transport of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (39Dundr M. Misteli T. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Sm proteins are transported in the nucleus, where they localize first to Cajal bodies, before they are transported through the nucleolus to splicing factor compartments (40Sleeman J.E. Lamond A.I. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1065-1074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).Many growth factors display sequences required for nuclear localization (1Jans D.A. Hassan G. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 400-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Removal of the NLS from FGF-1β leads to decreased mitogenic activity, whereas receptor binding and activation is not influenced. Addition of a heterologous NLS from histone H2 is able to restore the mitogenic function (41Imamura T. Engleka K. Zhan X. Tokita Y. Forough R. Roeder D. Jackson A. Maier J.A. Hla T. Maciag T. Science. 1990; 249: 1567-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). We show in this study that both FGF-2 isoforms localize to the nucleus, with the 18-kDa isoform possessing one and the 23-kDa displaying a second NLS: the N-terminal extension exclusively in the 23-kDa isoform and a common C-terminal sequence element in the 18-kDa core primary structure. This is in agreement with data showing that the N-terminal extension is able to target β-galactosidase to the nucleus (15Quarto N. Finger F.P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 147: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations of the second NLS in the 23-kDa sequence (R149G/R151G) override the effect of the N-terminal extension NLS, suggesting an effect on the overall structure of this isoform. It is possible, of course, that the other mutants also had an influence on FGF-2 structure, but they retained nuclear localization. Our data indicate that the 18-kDa FGF-2 core sequence is able to confer nucleolar localization, because the N-terminal constructs displayed no clear enrichment in the nucleoli. For FGF-3 it has been shown recently that a nucleolar binding partner NoBP is essential for itsnucleolar localization (42Reimers K. Antoine M. Zapatka M. Blecken V. Dickson C. Kiefer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4996-5007Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The localization of thenucleolar localization sequence in FGF-2 has to be determined in further studies.With regard to putative functions distinct effects of the isoforms have been shown, e.g. on neurite formation and survival of dopaminergic neurons after exogenous application of the isoforms (43Grothe C. Schulze A. Semkova I. Muller-Ostermeyer F. Rege A. Wewetzer K. Neuroscience. 2000; 100: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Examination of cell death rates and proliferation in Schwann cells stably overexpressing either the 18- or 21/23-kDa isoforms resulted in differential effects of both isoforms: the 18-kDa cells exhibited a significant increase of cell death but no higher proliferation rate in contrast to the high molecular weight isoforms (14Müller-Ostermeyer F. Claus P. Grothe C. Growth Factors. 2001; 19: 175-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).For the understanding of nuclear functions of FGF-2, identification of interacting proteins is a crucial step. A previously unknown protein, called FIF (FGF-2-interacting factor), has been found in a two-hybrid assay and the exclusive interaction with high molecular weight FGF-2 was determined in a co-immunoprecipitation analysis (44Van den Berghe L. Laurell H. Huez I. Zanibellato C. Prats H. Bugler B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1709-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that the N terminus of the 23-kDa high molecular weight isoform of FGF-2 contains arginine residues that are post-translationally dimethylated (24Klein S. Carroll J.A. Chen Y. Henry M.F. Henry P.A. Ortonowski I.E. Pintucci G. Beavis R.C. Burgess W.H. Rifkin D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3150-3157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The RG repeats of the N-terminal extension are substrates for protein-arginine methyltransferases (23Burgess W.H. Bizik J. Mehlman T. Quarto N. Rifkin D.B. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 45Pintucci G. Quarto N. Rifkin D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The product of the spinal muscular atrophy gene SMN is able to bind preferentially to dimethylarginine containing proteins, as shown for SmD1 and SmD3 (25Friesen W.J. Massenet S. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1111-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). These proteins possess C-terminal RG domains. Here we show specific binding of 23-kDa FGF-2 to SMN by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5, b and c) and, in addition, co-localization in nuclear gems (Fig. 3,g–i). This indicates a putative interaction with the N-terminal extension of the 23-kDa isoform or an indirect interaction in a common complex in nuclear gems. The majority of SMN is a cytoplasmic protein, where it is part of a complex with spliceosomal Sm proteins, Gemin-2 (formerly SIP1), and Gemin-3 and -4 (for review see Refs. 46Sendtner M. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2001; 14: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar and 47Terns M.P. Terns R.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R862-R864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, SMN can be detected in gems and Cajal bodies (26Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3555-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 48Hebert M.D. Matera A.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4159-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of both the 18-kDa FGF-2 isoform and SMN in Cajal bodies, we could not detect co-immunoprecipitation of these proteins. Therefore, direct or indirect interaction via bridging proteins of SMN with FGF-2 is probably confined to the 23-kDa isoform in nuclear gems. Different functional domains of SMN are responsible for known protein-protein interactions. The C terminus is responsible for Sm-protein binding (49Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) and oligomerization of SMN (50Lorson C.L. Strasswimmer J. Yao J.M. Baleja J.D. Hahnen E. Wirth B., Le, T. Burghes A.H. Androphy E.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), whereas an N-terminal region is responsible for SIP1 binding. For the putative direct interaction with FGF-2 the responsible domains have to be elucidated in further studies. Spinal muscular atrophy is associated with deletion and mutations of the SMN1 gene. Spinal muscular atrophy patients suffer from severe symptoms of motoneuron degeneration. However, SMN is ubiquitously expressed in most cell types examined. The reasons for specific symptoms only in motoneurons are not yet clear. The severity of the disease is correlated with the amount of functional SMN protein from the second (SMN2) gene. Blocking of the central interaction domain of SMN, the Tudor domain, prevents binding of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle core factors (Sm proteins) and abolishes assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein. Deletion of 27 residues from the N terminus of SMN leads to inhibition of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein assembly, splicing, and transcription (51Pellizzoni L. Baccon J. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1079-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 52Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar).The specific interaction of the 23-kDa FGF-2 isoform with SMN suggests a new role for nuclear FGF-2 in RNA metabolism. Although the physiological relevance of this interaction is not clear, it is worth noting in this context that FGF-2 mediates neurotrophic effects on motoneurons in vivo and in vitro (53Grothe C. Wewetzer K. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 40: 403-410PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the endogenous FGF-2 is up-regulated in motoneurons after peripheral nerve lesion (54Huber K. Meisinger C. Grothe C. J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 382: 189-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and iodinated FGF-2 is specifically transported by motoneurons (55Grothe C. Unsicker K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 32: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In a recent study SMN could be linked to a growth factor signal transduction pathway by interacting with the zinc finger protein ZPR1 (56Gangwani L. Mikrut M. Theroux S. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). ZPR1 binds to EGFR and redistributes to the nucleus and Cajal bodies together with SMN in mitogen-treated cells.FGF-2 bound to the extracellular side by FGF receptors can be internalized as a receptor-ligand complex, escape the desensitization processes, and can be transported to the nucleus (11Amalric F. Bouche G. Bonnet H. Brethenou P. Roman A.M. Truchet I. Quarto N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this study we cannot exclude the possibility that FGF-2, which lacks a classical export signal, is transported outside the cell and subsequently redirected to the nucleus. However, in addition to previous studies our data suggest the existence of independent nuclear growth factor functions. A number of mitogenic growth factors, growth-regulatory proteins, and growth factor receptors have been reported to be localized in the cell nucleus and its substructures: e.g.platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1),1 FGF-2, and ciliary neurotrophic factor (1Jans D.A. Hassan G. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 400-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Pederson T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The data show that nuclear localization is a general phenomenon for some growth factors, suggesting nuclear functions independent of the function as extracellular factors. FGF-2 is a member of the FGF family, which has been shown to mediate a variety of biological processes during development and in the adult organism, including mitogenesis, angiogenesis, chemotaxis, mesoderm induction, and differentiation of various mesoderm- and neuroectoderm-derived cells. FGF-2 as an extracellular ligand is able to bind to high affinity tyrosine transmembrane receptors (FGF receptors, FGFR). FGF-2 has been shown to bind to all four known FGFR, however, with distinct affinities (3Ornitz D.M., Xu, J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). FGF-2 exists in protein isoforms translated from a common messenger RNA by alternative use of AUG (18,000 isoform) and CUG (high molecular weight isoforms 21,000 and 23,000) start codons. The isoforms exert different biological effects when overexpressed in different cell types. Specific effects seen by the 23-kDa isoform but not the 18-kDa isoform after overexpression are reduced spreading of pancreatic cancer cells (4Escaffit F. Estival A. Bertrand C. Vaysse N. Hollande E.

Cattini P.A. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that in PC12 cells and rat immortalized Schwann cells, cell growth and morphology are altered after transfection with constructs coding for 18- and 23-kDa FGF-2, respectively (9Meisinger C.

Brain Res. Mol. 1998; 57: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this study we extend our previous data by analyses of subcellular localization and interaction of FGF-2 in immortalized rat Schwann cells. The FGF-2 isoforms are known to localize to the nucleus, however, the 18-kDa isoform has been found also in the cytoplasm (8Pasumarthi K.B. Kardami E. Cattini P.A. Circ.

The N terminus of the 23-kDa isoform exhibits a nuclear localization signal (NLS) (15Quarto N. Finger F.P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 147: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, because the 18-kDa isoform localizes also to the nucleus, a second NLS in the 18-kDa “core” sequence can be expected. The individual isoforms were reported to localize to the nucleoli (18Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 16Arese M. Chen Y. Florkiewicz R.Z. Gualandris A. Shen B. Rifkin D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1429-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to analyze the localization of FGF-2 isoforms in more detail in other nuclear substructures by means of tagging with fluorescent proteins (EGFP and DsRed) and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the nuclear localization of FGF-2 isoforms. Our results revealed a differential localization of the isoforms in nuclear substructures of rat immortalized Schwann cells and, in addition, identified two nuclear localization sequences in the 23-kDa isoform. A further important and interesting result in our study is the first presentation of a co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization of the 23-kDa FGF-2 high molecular weight isoform with the survival of motor neuron protein (SMN), which is mutated in patients with spinal muscular atrophy. This study provides new insights into the physiological functions of FGF-2 in the nucleus. DISCUSSIONImmunolocalization studies and Western blotting after cell fractionation have previously demonstrated the existence of FGF-2 in the nucleus (10Grothe C. Meisinger C. Holzschuh J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 203-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In this study we labeled FGF-2 isoforms by fusion constructs with the red fluorescent protein DsRed. Because no specific antibodies against the individual isoform are available, we used this approach, although the possibility of artificial localization patterns because of overexpression of the tagged proteins cannot be completely excluded. One previous study shows a 18-kDa FGF-2/GFP fusion protein localizing to the nuclei in corneal endothelial cells, however, the nuclear substructures enriched in this isoform have not been described explicitly (28Choi J., Ko, M.K. Kay E.P. Mol. Vis. 2000; 6: 222-231PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate differential localization of FGF-2 isoforms in the nucleus, localization in nuclear bodies, and a specific protein-protein interaction of 23-kDa FGF-2.

Epidemiological studies indicate an inverse relationship between moderate wine consumption and CAD mortality. Here, we demonstrate that preincubation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) with red wine, but not white wine, inhibits ligand binding and the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of the platelet-derived growth factor beta receptor (betaPDGFR), which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. As a consequence, red wine abrogates the ligand-induced recruitment of betaPDGFR-associated signaling molecules (RasGAP, SHP-2, PI3K, PLCgamma), PDGF-dependent downstream events such as Erk activation and induction of immediate early genes, and VSMC proliferation and migration. Wine analysis revealed flavonoids of the catechin family as major constituents of red wine, and these were identified as potent inhibitors of betaPDGFR signaling. Importantly, the concentrations of red wine/catechins shown to inhibit the PDGFR in vitro correlate with the serum levels after red wine consumption in humans. We conclude that nonalcoholic constituents of red wine, which accumulate during the ""mash fermentation,"" inhibit betaPDGFR activation and PDGF-dependent cellular responses in VSMCs. Therefore, catechin-mediated inhibition of betaPDGFR signaling offers a molecular explanation for the ""French paradox."""

Despite the importance of sphingosine kinase, very little is known regarding its structure or mechanism of catalysis. Moreover, sphingosine kinase does not contain recognizable catalytic or substrate-binding sites, based on sequence motifs found in other kinases. Here we have elucidated the nucleotide-binding site of human sphingosine kinase 1 (hSK1) through a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and affinity labeling with the ATP analogue, FSBA. We have shown that Gly82 of hSK1 is involved in ATP binding since mutation of this residue to alanine resulted in an enzyme with an ∼45-fold higher K m(ATP). We have also shown that Lys103 is important in catalysis since an alanine substitution of this residue ablates catalytic activity. Furthermore, we have shown that this residue is covalently modified by FSBA. Our data, combined with amino acid sequence comparison, suggest a motif of SGDGX 17–21K is involved in nucleotide binding in the sphingosine kinases. This motif differs in primary sequence from all previously identified nucleotide-binding sites.

Recent sequence analysis has indicated some weak structural similarity may exist in this region between the sphingosine kinases, diacylglycerol kinases, and part of the nucleotide-binding site of 6-phosphofructokinase (PFK) (26Labesse G. Douguet D. Assairi L. Gilles A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 273-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This may suggest this region is involved in nucleotide binding in sphingosine kinases and diacylglycerol kinases, although this has not been experimentally established. We have also recently shown that a further highly conserved glycine residue in hSK1, Gly113, may also be important in catalysis since mutation of this residue to alanine increases the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme, while mutation to aspartate is deleterious to catalytic activity (27Pitson S.M.

Here we have begun to examine the substrate-binding sites of sphingosine kinase in the hope of better understanding the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. We have identified key residues in the nucleotide-binding site in hSK1 through the use of site-directed mutagenesis and affinity labeling with the ATP analogue FSBA. d-erythro-Sphingosine was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). ATP, GTP, FSBA, and 8-N3ATP were from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]GTP were purchased from Geneworks (Adelaide, Australia), and sequencing grade modified trypsin from Promega (Annandale, Australia). hSK1 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF200328) was FLAG epitope-tagged at the 3′-end and subcloned into pALTER site-directed mutagenesis vector (Promega Corp.), as previously described (5Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A.B. Zebol J.R. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. D'Andrea R.J. Wattenberg B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33945-33950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA was prepared and used as template for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis as detailed in the manufacturer's protocol. The mutagenic oligonucleotides used to generate the point mutant constructs were as follows: for hSK1G26A, 5′-GAACCCGCGGGGCGCCAAGGGCAA-3′; hSK1G26D, 5′-GCTGAACCCCCGGGGCGACAAGGGCAA-3′; hSK1K27A, 5′-CGCGGCGGCGCCGGCAAGGCC-3′; hSK1K29A, 5′-GGCAAGGGCGCCGCCTTGCAG-3′; hSK1S79A, 5′-GTGGTCATGGCCGGCGACGGGCTG-3′; hSK1S79D, 5′-GTGGTCATGGATGGAGACGGCCTGATGCAC-3′; hSK1G80A, 5′-TCATGTCTGCAGACGGGCT-3′; hSK1G80D, 5′-TCATGTCTGACGACGGCCTGATGCAC-3′; hSK1G82A, 5′-GTCTGGAGATGCATTGATGCACG-3′; hSK1K103A, 5′-GCCATCCAGGCCCCCCTGTGT-3′; hSK1K103R, 5′-GCCATCCAGCGGCCGCTGTGTAGC-3′; hSK1G111A, 5′-AGCCTCCCTGCAGCCTCTGGCAA-3′; hSK1G111D, 5′-TCCCAGCAGACTCTGGCAA-3′ (substituted nucleotides underlined). The mutants were sequenced to verify incorporation of the desired modification and the cDNA subsequently subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) for transient transfection into HEK293T cells.

The oligonucleotides used to generate these mutant constructs were as follows: for hSK1Δ17–36, 5′-GCGGCAGGGCCGCGGGA-3′ and 5′-CACGTGCAGCCCCTTTTGG-3′; hSK1Δ72–96, 5′-GCGGCCCAGCTCCTCCGA-3′ and 5′-TGGGAGACCGCCATCCAGA-3′; hSK1Δ107–119, 5′-GCTACACAGGGGCTTCTGGA-3′ and 5′-TTGAACCATTATGCTGGCTATGA-3′; hSK1Δ165–198, 5′GAAGA-GGCGCAGCCCCGAA-3′ and 5′-CGTCTGGCAGCCTTGCGCA-3′; hSK1Δ338–344, 5′-CATACCTTTCCCATCCTTGGGC-3′ and 5′-ATGGTTAGCGAGGCCGTGCA-3′; hSK1Δ344–384, 5′-CAATTCCCCATCCACTGCAAAC-3′ and 5′-GACTACAAGGACGACGATGA-3′; hSK1Δ368–384, 5′-CTCCACGCAACCGCTGAC-3′ and 5′-GACTACAAGGACGACGATGA-3′. The PCR products were kinased, self-ligated, and then transformed into E. coli. The mutants were sequenced to verify incorporation of the desired deletions and the cDNA subsequently subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) for transient transfection into HEK293T cells. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T, ATCC CRL-1573) were cultured and transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (5Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A.B. Zebol J.R.

Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication (2 watts for 30 s at 4 °C) in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmEDTA, and protease inhibitors (Complete™; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein concentrations in cell homogenates were determined with either the Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma) or bicinchoninic acid (Pierce) reagents using bovine serum albumin as standard. The hSK1 cDNA was subcloned upstream of a C-terminal His6 tag in the baculovirus transplacement vector pFastBac1 (Invitrogen). Recombinant baculovirus expressing hSK1-His was generated in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Western blot analyses of infected cell lysates, with an anti-His monoclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences), was initially used to confirm expression. Sf9 cells (1–2 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with the recombinant baculovirus (1–5 MOI) for 72 h. Infected cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline and all subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 10 volumes of Buffer A, containing 50 mmNa2HPO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors (Complete™). Cells were sonicated for 10 s and the homogenate mixed with Tween 20 to a final concentration of 0.5%. Additional NaCl was added to a final concentration of 600 mm and after incubation on ice for 30 min, the homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was incubated with 0.5 ml of Buffer A-equilibrated Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) slurry per 500 ml of original Sf9 cell culture for 1 h at 4 °C with continuous mixing. Following centrifugation at 1000 × g, the Ni-NTA was then packed into columns and washed with 5 volumes of Buffer A. The columns were subsequently washed with 20 volumes of Buffer A containing 25 mm imidazole, and eluted with 2–3 volumes of 200 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. Sphingosine kinase activity was routinely determined using d-erythro-sphingosine and [γ-32P]ATP as substrates, as described previously (10Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Vandeleur L. Moretti P.A.B. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In some cases [γ-32P]GTP was used as the phosphate donor instead of [γ-32P]ATP. A unit of sphingosine kinase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1 pmol of S1P/min. Substrate kinetics in cell extracts were determined after the extracts were desalted in NAP-5 columns (AmershamBiosciences) to remove other possible phosphate donors. The kinetic data were analyzed using Michaelis-Menten kinetics with the non-linear regression program Hyper 1.1s. In all cases relative sphingosine kinase activities and substrate kinetic values were adjusted to account for the slightly different expression levels of the various mutant proteins following quantitative Western blotting. As detailed previously (27Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A.B. Zebol J.R. D'Andrea R.J. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the effect of mutations on gross folding of hSK1 was assessed by examining the interaction of the mutants with calcium/calmodulin (CaM), which is known to occur only with correctly folded hSK1 protein (10Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Vandeleur L. Moretti P.A.B. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells overexpressing wild type or mutant hSK1 were harvested and lysed as described above. The cell lysates were then centrifuged (13000 × g, 15 min at 4 °C) to remove cell debris. Aliquots of the supernatants were added to tubes containing CaM-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with binding buffer composed of 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm CaCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors (Complete™) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with continuous mixing. The CaM-Sepharose 4B beads were then pelleted by centrifugation (5000 × g, 5 min at 4 °C) and washed twice with binding buffer. hSK1 bound to the beads were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blotting via the FLAG epitope. Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) was used as a control for nonspecific binding to the Sepharose 4B beads. SDS-PAGE was performed on cell lysates using 12% acrylamide gels. Proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose and the membranes blocked overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk powder and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100. hSK1 expression levels in cell lysates were quantitated over a dilution series of the lysates with the monoclonal M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), with the immunocomplexes detected with both horseradish peroxidase anti-mouse (Pierce) IgG using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and alkaline phosphatase anti-mouse IgG (Selinus/Amrad, Melbourne, Australia) using an ECF kit (AmershamBiosciences) and a Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA) fluorimager. To test their ability to irreversibly inhibit sphingosine kinase activity FSBA and 8-N3ATP were added to either purified recombinant hSK1 or extracts of HEK293T cells overexpressing hSK1 or hSKK103R. FSBA was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (Me2SO) and added to a final concentration of 1 mm (1% (v/v) Me2SO) in reaction mixture containing hSK1 in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. This mixture was then incubated in the presence or absence of 2 mm ATP at 22 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then desalted in an NAP-5 column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove unreacted FSBA and assayed for sphingosine kinase activity. Similarly, 8-N3ATP (100 μm) was added to purified recombinant hSK1 in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol in the presence or absence of 2 mm ATP. The 8-N3ATP was then photoactivated by exposure to a 12-watt UV lamp (254 nm) for 90 s at a distance of 5 cm. The reaction mixture was then desalted, assayed for sphingosine kinase activity, and the residual activity compared with hSK1 treated in an identical manner, but without the addition of 8-N3ATP. FSBA (dissolved in Me2SO) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm (1% v/v Me2SO) in 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 15 μg of purified recombinant hSK1. This mixture was then incubated in the presence or absence of 20 mm ATP at 22 °C for 60 min and a further 16 h at 4 °C. The reaction was then stopped by the addition of 1 mm dithiothreitol. For analysis of the FSBA labeling of the whole hSK1 protein, this mixture was then acidified with acetic acid, purified on a Macrosphere C8 column (Alltech) using a linear (0–70%) acetonitrile gradient with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and then analyzed by mass spectrometry. FSBA labeling for peptide analysis was carried out in the same manner, except that after termination of the FSBA labeling step by the addition of dithiothreitol, 0.05% (w/v) SDS was added, and the mixture then heated at 100 °C for 6 min. This step proved essential for obtaining adequate yields of the labeled peptide. After cooling, 100 ng of trypsin was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h with shaking. A further 100 ng of trypsin was then added and the mixture again incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. Dithiothreitol (0.2 mm), solid urea to a final concentration of 8m, and 1 m guanidine hydrochloride were then added to the tryptic peptides. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 5 min) and the supernatant acidified with acetic acid. The peptides were then separated on a Macrosphere C8 column (Alltech) using an acetonitrile gradient (0–55%) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Whole-protein analysis and preliminary peptide analyses were performed on a PE/Sciex API-100 electrospray-ionization mass spectrometer (PE Biosystems, Melbourne, Australia) operating in positive-ion mode. Spectra of the proteins' ion series were converted to a true-mass scale using the instrument's software. Data files corresponding to peptide maps of hSK1 were interrogated by Sherpa software (University of Washington) for the presence of ions corresponding to FSBA-derivatized peptides. The derivatized adenosylbenzoylsulfonyl-peptides were further characterized using an electrospray-ionization quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF2, Micromass, Manchester, UK). The ion-series spectra for the analyzed peptides were converted to a true-mass scale using the instrument's software. In an attempt to more clearly define the essential domains required for catalysis and regulation of hSK1 we generated and analyzed a series of deletion mutants of this protein.

These conserved regions span residues 17–36, 72–96, 107–119, 165–198, and 338–344 of hSK1. Therefore, we generated deletion mutants of hSK1 where these five highly conserved regions were individually removed (hSK1Δ17–36, hSK1Δ72–96, hSK1Δ107–119, hSK1Δ165–198, and hSK1Δ338–344). In addition we generated and analyzed two truncation hSK1 mutants lacking the C-terminal 41 and 17 amino acids of this protein (hSK1Δ344–384 and hSK1Δ368–384, respectively). These hSK1 mutants were expressed in HEK293T cells and the cell lysates assayed for sphingosine kinase activity. Overexpression of wild type hSK1 routinely results in an elevation of sphingosine kinase activity in cell extracts of 1000-fold over extracts of cells transfected with a control plasmid. While protein expression levels of the hSK1 mutants with internal deletions were similar to that of the wild type hSK1 (Fig. 2), in no case did the extracts derived from mutant transfected cells exhibit sphingosine kinase activity greater than that of the endogenous levels present in HEK293T cells (data not shown). To assess the effect of these mutations on gross folding of hSK1 we exploited the known interaction of hSK1 with calmodulin (10Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Vandeleur L. Moretti P.A.B. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 26Labesse G. Douguet D. Assairi L. Gilles A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 273-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We have previously observed that this binding is sensitive to the folded state of hSK1 (10Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Vandeleur L. Moretti P.A.B. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This is demonstrated, for example, by the observation that when expressed in Escherichia coli, only catalytically active, but not inactive recombinant hSK1 is bound by immobilized calmodulin (10Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Vandeleur L. Moretti P.A.B. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This analysis showed that, unlike wild type hSK1, these hSK1 mutants could not bind specifically to calmodulin-Sepharose (Fig. 2). Since the mutagenesis did not alter any of the putative calmodulin-binding motifs in hSK1 this suggests that all of these mutations yielded misfolded hSK1 protein. Therefore, the lack of catalytic activity in these mutants probably reflects their inability to fold correctly, rather than necessarily indicating that the deleted regions are required for catalysis. Similar lack of activity was also observed for the hSK1Δ344–384truncation mutant lacking the C-terminal 41 amino acids (data not shown). The protein expression level of this mutant was comparable to wild type hSK1, but again, the lack of calmodulin binding suggested that this truncation yielded misfolded hSK1 protein (Fig. 2). In contrast, the hSK1Δ368–384 truncation mutant lacking the C-terminal 17 amino acids generated a correctly folded protein (Fig. 2) that possessed unaltered catalytic activity compared with wild type hSK1 (Fig. 3).Figure 3Site-directed mutagenesis of hSK1. HEK293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3 plasmids containing cDNAs of wild type hSK1 or the various hSK1 mutants, or empty vector alone (pcDNA3). The cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and analyzed for sphingosine kinase activity and expression levels of the FLAG-tagged hSK1 constructs. Sphingosine kinase activities are expressed relative to the activity of wild type hSK1 and are corrected for slight differences in their expression levels (lower panel).

https://openalex.org/W1968633443,"Proteins encoded by five of the six known Fanconi anemia (FA) genes form a heteromeric complex that facilitates repair of DNA damage induced by cross-linking agents. A certain number of these proteins, notably FANCC, also function independently to modulate apoptotic signaling, at least in part, by suppressing ground state activation of the pro-apoptotic interferon-inducible double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). Because certain FANCC mutations interdict its anti-apoptotic function without interfering with the capacity of FANCC to participate functionally in the FA multimeric complex, we suspected that FANCC enhances cell survival independent of its participation in the complex. By investigating this function in both mammalian cells and in yeast, an organism with no FA orthologs, we show that FANCC inhibited the kinase activity of PKR bothin vivo and in vitro, and this effect depended upon a physical interaction between FANCC and Hsp70 but not on interactions of FANCC with other Fanconi proteins. Hsp70, FANCC, and PKR form a ternary complex in lymphoblasts and in yeast expressing PKR. We conclude that Hsp70 requires the cooperation of FANCC to suppress PKR activity and support survival of hematopoietic cells and that FANCC does not require the multimeric FA complex to exert this function.

Whether any of the FA proteins has functions independent of the multimeric FA complex is currently the subject of debate. Certain FA proteins, particularly FANCC, also function independently to suppress apoptotic responses of hematopoietic cells to a variety of environmental cues. Down-regulation of FANCC expression inhibits clonal growth of normal erythroid and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells, and the disruption of the FANCC gene in mice renders hematopoietic progenitor cells hypersensitive to the apoptotic effects of interferon (IFN)-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (18Whitney M.A. Royle G.

Buchwald M. Blood. 1996; 88: 4558-4567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in CD34+ cells from FA-C patients (23Walsh C.E. Nienhuis A.W. Samulski R.J. Brown M.G. Miller J.L. Young N.S. Liu J.M. J. Clin.

Consequently, inactivating mutations of the FANCC gene account for the near universal development of bone marrow failure in FA-C patients. Recently, we found that the interferon-inducible double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) was constitutively activated in FA cells (25Pang Q. Keeble W. Diaz J. Christianson T.A.

Keeble W. Christianson T.A. Faulkner G.R. Bagby G.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4478-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), a cytoprotective factor known to suppress PKR activation (27Thulasiraman V. Xu Z. Uma S. Gu Y. Chen J.J. Matts R.L. Eur. J.

Consequently, we sought to formally test the influence of these two anti-apoptotic proteins on PKR activity in an in vivo context not confounded by the presence of any other FA proteins. We report here that FANCC and Hsp70 function cooperatively to suppress the kinase activity of PKR and do so independently of the FA protein complex. A high copy multigenic yeast vector that co-expresses human PKR (or its dominant negative mutant K296R) (for review see Ref. 34Katze M.G. Wambach M. Wong M.L. Garfinkel M. Meurs E. Chong K.

Biol. 1991; 11: 5497-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) under the control of a galactose-inducible (GAL) promoter and FANCC (or a FA-C patient-derived mutant L554P) under the yeast ADH1 promoter was created by subcloning the cDNA encoding full-length PKR (or K296R) and FANCC (or L554P) into a modified form of the yeast expression vector, pGST (35Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1646-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), in which the DNA sequence coding for the GST fusion protein has been removed. The resulting plasmids, pGAL-PKR, pGAL-K296R, pGAL-PKR-FANCC, and pGAL-PKR-L554P, were used individually to transform the Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrains H1816 and H1817 (36Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) using a Frozen-EZ yeast transformation kit (ZYMO Research). Strain H1816 carries a wild-type eIF-2αgene, whereas strain H1817 has a non-phosphorylatable mutant eIF-2α(S51A). Thus, H1816 cells carrying pGAL-PKR do not grow on synthetic galactose (SGAL) medium because of the inhibitory effect of PKR kinase phosphorylation on eIF-2α, but H1817 does grow on SGAL. Transformants of both strains were streaked on a glucose synthetic dextrose (SD)-agar plate and incubated for 3 days at 30 °C and replica-plated to both SD and SGAL-agar plate and incubated for 4 days at 30 °C. The H1817 transformants, which allow for high expression of both active and inactive PKR, were grown in 10 ml of SGAL medium for ∼15 h, harvested by centrifugation, washed once with ice-cold sterile water, and resuspended in 600 μl of Yeast Breakage Buffer (Qbiogene). Resuspended cells were added to a pre-chilled FastProtein RED tube (Qbiogene) and homogenized using a FastPrep FP120 Instrument (Qbiogene) at a speed of 6.0 ×g for 20 s at 4 °C. Aliquots of the resulting extracts containing 50 μg of total proteins were then treated with or without 100 units of λ-protein phosphatase (New England BioLabs) at 30 °C for 30 min prior to gel mobility analysis using a monoclonal antibody specific for PKR (Santa Cruz Technology). Whole cell lysates (1 mg of total protein) were pre-cleared with 50 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose suspension (Amersham Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. After separation of the protein A-Sepharose, the lysate was incubated with a monoclonal PKR antibody conjugated to agarose (Santa Cruz Technology) or a rabbit polyclonal eIF-2α antibody (Santa Cruz Technology), respectively, for 3–5 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose beads, recovered by centrifugation, and washed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. For immunoblotting, samples were heated in Laemmli SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the blots were incubated with second antibodies for 30 min at room temperature and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). GST-FANCC and GST-FANCCS249A have been described elsewhere (26Pang Q. Keeble W. Christianson T.A. Faulkner G.R. Bagby G.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4478-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These plasmids were transformed into yeast strain Sc334 (37Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) using a Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation kit (ZYMO Research). Expression and purification of the GST fusion proteins were carried out as described previously (38Pang Q. Fagerlie S. Christianson T.A. Keeble W. Faulkner G. Diaz J. Rathbun R.K. Bagby G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4724-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The indicated amounts of the FANCC or recombinant human Hsp70 (StressGen) suspended in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 5% glycerol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) were incubated with FANCC- and Hsp70-depleted whole cell lysates (200 μg) prepared from normal lymphoblasts at 30 °C for 10 min. 1 μg/ml of poly(I)·poly(C) (Amersham Biosciences) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were then added, and the mixtures were incubated for additional 10 min. The phosphorylated PKR and eIF-2α were isolated by immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal PKR antibody conjugated to agarose (Santa Cruz Technology) and a rabbit polyclonal eIF-2α antibody (Santa Cruz Technology), respectively and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Normal (JY) and mutant FA-C (HSC536N) lymphoblasts were maintained in RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Retroviral vectors expressing FANCC, a mutant FANCC containing a serine to alanine substitution at position 249 (S249A), and an antisenseHsp70 cDNA (asHsp) have been described previously (26Pang Q. Keeble W. Christianson T.A. Faulkner G.R. Bagby G.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4478-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These vectors were transduced into lymphoblasts as described previously (38Pang Q. Fagerlie S. Christianson T.A. Keeble W. Faulkner G. Diaz J. Rathbun R.K. Bagby G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4724-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Sets of isogenic lines were selected for G418 (300 μg/ml) resistance. Cells were stimulated with recombinant human IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) and TNF-α (10 ng/ml) (R & D Systems) for 24 h. For in vivo phosphate labeling, 20 × 106 lymphoblasts were treated with IFN-γ and TNF-α (10 ng/ml each) in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 15% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 2 h. Labeling was then performed in the same medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (150 μCi/ml) at 37 °C for 3 h. Whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously (20Rathbun R.K. Christianson T.A. Faulkner G.R. Jones G. Keeble W. O'Dwyer M. Bagby G.C. Blood. 2000; 96: 4204-4211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an agarose-conjugated anti-PKR monoclonal antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Western blot analysis was performed on these precipitates to determine the quantity of total PKR proteins precipitated by the antibody. Overexpression of human PKR in yeast cells results in autophosphorylation, phosphorylation of eIF-2α, inhibition of translation, and cell death (40Dever T.E. Chen J.J. Barber G.N. Cigan A.M. Feng L. Donahue T.F. London I.M. Katze M.G. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4616-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 41Williams B.R.G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). To test the effect of FANCC on PKR activity in vivo, we performed genetic analysis using a yeast (S. cerevisiae) strain in which the sole eIF-2α kinase GCN2 has been deleted (36Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). We used a high copy multigenic yeast vector that co-expresses human PKR (conditionally expressed by a galactose-inducible GALpromoter) and FANCC (constitutively expressed under the control of the yeast ADH1 promoter). Two isogenic strains were used to quantify the impact of human PKR and FANCC on cell survival: strain H1816 (which expresses a wild-type eIF-2α gene and is sensitive to PKR activation) and strain H1817 (which expresses a non-phosphorylatable mutant eIF-2α(S51A) and thus permits the survival of cells containing activated PKR) (36Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). H1816 yeast transformed with PKR-expressing plasmids grew well on SD minimal medium but as expected (36Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) was unable to grow on SGAL medium (Fig.1 A). Yeast transformants expressing a kinase-deficient PKR mutant, PKR(K296R) (34Katze M.G. Wambach M. Wong M.L. Garfinkel M. Meurs E. Chong K. Williams B.R. Hovanessian A.G. Barber G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5497-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), exhibited normal growth on both SD and SGAL media (Fig. 1 A). Co-expression of FANCC in H1816 cells reversed PKR-mediated growth inhibition as evidenced by the survival of colonies on SGAL medium (Fig. 1 A, lower plate). The co-expression of PKR with a patient-derived inactivating mutant L554P (a leucine-to-proline substitution at residue 554 of FANCC) (42Gavish H. dos Santos C.C. Buchwald M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) failed to rescue yeast growth (lower plate). All of the H1817 transformants showed similar growth rates on either SD or SGAL medium, confirming that the expression of these human proteins did not generally perturb normal yeast growth. PKR-mediated yeast cell death results from autophosphorylation of the kinase (43Taylor D.R. Lee S.B. Romano P.R. Marshak D.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Esteban M. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6295-6302Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 44Zhang F. Romano P.R. Nagamura-Inoue T. Tian B. Dever T.E. Mathews M.B. Ozato K. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24946-24958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Indeed, PKR immunoblots of H1817 lysates revealed an expected slower migrating band (45Romano P.R. Zhang F. Tan S.L. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Katze M.G. Dever T.E. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2282-2297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in yeast overexpressing PKR (Fig.1 B, lane 2), a band eliminated by the treatment of the extract with λ-phosphatase (lane 3). The kinase-deficient mutant K296R was not phosphorylated when overexpressed in yeast (lanes 4 and 5) as expected (46Taylor D.R. Tian B. Romano P.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Lai M.M. Mathews M.B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1265-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The co-expression of wild-type FANCC but not the inactive L554P mutant reduced PKR autophosphorylation as evidenced by a minimal PKR shift (also eliminated by λ-phosphatase treatment (lanes 6–9)). We conclude that FANCC inhibits PKR phosphorylation in yeast cells. We examined the interaction between FANCC and PKR to determine whether these proteins exist in the same protein complex. Immunoblot analysis of anti-PKR immunoprecipitates from H1817 yeast transformants demonstrated a detectable albeit weak protein complex formed between FANCC and PKR when co-expressed in yeast (Fig. 1 C, top panel, lane 9). However, higher amounts of mutant FANCC (L554P) protein were found in the anti-PKR immunoprecipitates (comparelane 9 with lane 10), indicating that the binding of FANCC per se is insufficient to modulate PKR activity. Because FANCC interacts with Hsp70 to protect hematopoietic cells from apoptosis induced by IFN-γ and TNF-α, both of which function as PKR activators (47Yeung M.C. Liu J. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 48Der S.D. Yang Y.L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), and because Hsp70 has been implicated in the repression of PKR and other eIF-2α kinases (26Pang Q. Keeble W. Christianson T.A. Faulkner G.R. Bagby G.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4478-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 27Thulasiraman V. Xu Z. Uma S. Gu Y. Chen J.J. Matts R.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 552-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Melville M.W. Tan S.L. Wambach M. Song J. Morimoto R.I. Katze M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3797-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Uma S. Thulasiraman V. Matts R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5861-5871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we reasoned that the binding of FANCC with yeast Hsc70 might represent the functional entity for PKR suppression. Indeed, PKR-Hsc70 association was detected in PKR transformants co-expressing the normal FANCC protein (Fig. 1 C, middle panel, lane 9) but not the mutant L554P FANCC protein (lane 10). To test biochemically the notion that FANCC acts in concert with Hsp70 to suppress PKR activation, we performed in vitro kinase assays using purified GST-FANCC proteins and cell extracts from normal lymphoblasts as sources of PKR and Hsp70 proteins. We first incubated extracts that were depleted of FANCC prepared using antibody affinity chromatography adsorption with increasing amounts of either GST-FANCC or a FANCC mutant GST-S249A known to be defective in interacting with Hsp70 (26Pang Q. Keeble W. Christianson T.A. Faulkner G.R. Bagby G.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4478-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) in the presence of dsRNA and [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixtures were immunoprecipitated with anti-PKR and anti-eIF-2α antibodies, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. We noted a dose-dependent inhibition of the phosphorylation of both PKR (Fig. 2 A) and eIF-2α (Fig. 2 B) by GST-FANCC (lanes 3–6) but not by mutant GST-FANCCS249A (lanes 7–10). Control reactions without GST-FANCC (lane 1) had no effect on PKR activation nor did GST alone (data not shown), indicating that the observed inhibition was mediated by exogenous GST-FANCC. Because FANCC-S249A, which fails to bind to Hsp70, failed to inhibit PKR activity, we suspected that the interaction between FANCC and Hsp70 is required for the suppression of PKR activity and phosphorylation of eIF-2α. To confirm the role of Hsp70 in mammalian cells, we performed a second kinase assay by incubating cell extracts depleted of both FANCC and Hsp70/Hsc70 with increasing amounts of recombinant Hsp70 and limiting amounts of GST-FANCC or GST-S249A proteins in the presence of dsRNA and [γ-32P]ATP. PKR was immunoprecipitated, and32P incorporation was detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 2 C, GST-FANCC had no effect on PKR phosphorylation in the absence of Hsp70 (Fig.2 C, upper panel, lane 1). In the presence of normal but not the mutant S249A FANCC, recombinant Hsp70 reduced the phosphorylation of PKR in a dose-dependent manner (compare lanes 2–5 with lanes 6–9). We conclude that the formation of an Hsp70·FANCC complex is required to suppress PKR activity. To demonstrate functional Hsp70-FANCC interactions in hematopoietic cells, we quantified IFN-γ/TNF-α-induced PKR phosphorylation and interactions among FANCC, Hsp70, and PKR in normal and FA-C patient-derived HSC536N lymphoblasts. We have already shown that the suppression of Hsp70 expression reduced FANCC·Hsp70 complex and further sensitized normal lymphoblasts to IFN-γ and TNF-α (26Pang Q. Keeble W. Christianson T.A. Faulkner G.R. Bagby G.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4478-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As expected, PKR phosphorylation was significantly increased in normal lymphoblasts, expressing an antisense HSP70 cDNA both in ground state (Fig. 3 A,lane 3) and in response to IFN-γ and TNF-α (lane 4). PKR was constitutively phosphorylated (lane 5) and hyperphosphorylated (lane 6) in untreated and IFN-γ/TNF-α-treated HSC536N lymphoblasts, respectively. However, the suppression of Hsp70 expression in HSC536N cells augmented phosphorylation of PKR neither in the ground state nor after treatment with IFN-γ and TNF-α (lanes 7 and 8), findings that are consistent with our previous observation that repression of Hsp70 expression did not further sensitize the mutant FA-C lymphoblasts to IFN-γ and TNF-α because interaction between Hsp70 and mutant FANCC (L554P) protein was already fully compromised (26Pang Q. Keeble W. Christianson T.A. Faulkner G.R. Bagby G.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4478-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The re-introduction of normal FANCC but not the defective Hsp70 interactor FANCC (S249A) into the mutant HSC536 cells fully suppressed PKR phosphorylation mediated by IFN-γ and TNF-α (lanes 9and 10). Both Hsp70 and PKR proteins were detected in anti-FANCC immune complexes in the mutant HSC536N and complemented (HSC536N/FANCC) lymphoblasts (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–4), but as observed in the anti-PKR immunoprecipitates of the yeast transformants (Fig. 1 C), we found significantly more PKR associated with mutant FANCC than with normal FANCC protein (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and4). Conversely, as was the case in yeast, more Hsp70 was found bound to normal FANCC (lanes 3 and 4) than with the L554P FANCC mutant protein (lanes 1 and2). Because the L554P substitution severely compromises the association of FANCC with Hsp70 (26Pang Q. Keeble W. Christianson T.A. Faulkner G.R. Bagby G.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4478-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), a functional interaction between the two proteins is a prerequisite for the formation of a ternary FANCC·Hsp70·PKR complex. The results suggested that the suppression of PKR activation requires physical association of Hsp70 with the kinase and that FANCC-Hsp70 interaction is required to facilitate the physical association of Hsp70 with PKR. To determine more precisely the PKR suppressive role of the FANCC-Hsp70-PKR interaction, we examined the formation of the ternary complex in lymphoblasts expressing antisense HSP70cDNAs that dramatically reduced the expression of the Hsp70 protein (26Pang Q. Keeble W. Christianson T.A. Faulkner G.R. Bagby G.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4478-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Suppression of Hsp70 reduced the formation of PKR·Hsp70 complexes in normal (JY) lymphoblasts (Fig. 3 C, comparelanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and4). Treatment of these lymphoblasts with IFN-γ and TNF-α increased the interaction between Hsp70 and PKR (compare lane 1 with lane 2). However, there was little detectable Hsp70 co-precipitated with PKR in extracts from the FA-C mutant HSC536N lymphoblasts, Hsp70 expression, and IFN-γ/TNF-α treatments (lanes 5–8) notwithstanding. Re-introduction of the normal FANCC (lane 9) but not the mutant FANCC-S249A known to be defective in interaction with Hsp70 (lane 10) restored the formation of the Hsp70·PKR complex to a level observed in normal (JY) lymphoblasts (lane 2). Levels of Hsp70 in PKR immunoprecipitates inversely correlated with phosphorylation (activation) of PKR as shown in Fig. 3 A. Interestingly, in normal lymphoblasts expressing antisense HSP70 cDNA, the amount of FANCC co-precipitated with PKR varied inversely with Hsp70 levels (Fig. 3 C, middle panel, comparelanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and4) and was actually increased in the mutant HSC536N cells (lanes 5–8). Expression of normal FANCC in these mutant lymphoblasts reduced the FANCC-PKR association (lane 9) but the expression of the FANCC-S249A mutant did not (lane 10). We conclude that a physical interaction of Hsp70 with PKR is required for the suppression of PKR kinase activity and that through a direct interaction with Hsp70, FANCC plays a role in facilitating the formation of the Hsp70·PKR complex. Promiscuous binding of PKR by FANCC in normal lymphoblasts with reduced Hsp70 expression (Fig.3 C, lanes 3 and 4) and in both yeast and human cells expressing mutant FANCC-L554P (Fig. 1 C,lane 10, and Fig. 3 C, lanes 5–8 and10) suggests that FANCC binds to PKR and then recruits Hsp70 to the molecule, resulting in the displacement of FANCC and inhibition of PKR. Because the release of FANCC from the ternary complex depends upon an initial association of Hsp70 with FANCC and because the inhibition of PKR is hsp70-dependent, abnormalities of either Hsp70 or FANCC that perturb this interaction would be expected to lead to the kind of constitutive PKR activation documented in FA-C cells (Fig. 3 A) (5Strathdee C.A. Gavish H. Shannon W.R. Buchwald M. Nature. 1992; 356: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Based on the results described here and on prior work clarifying the role of Hsp70 in regulation of PKR and other eIF-2α kinases (27Thulasiraman V. Xu Z. Uma S. Gu Y. Chen J.J. Matts R.L. Eur. J.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5861-5871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we propose a model for the role of FANCC and Hsp70 in PKR signaling in hematopoietic cells (Fig. 4). In response to environmental cues such as viral infection, growth-inhibitory cytokines (IFN-γ and TNF-α) or oxidative stress (e.g.reactive oxygen species), the pro-apoptotic kinase PKR becomes activated by autophosphorylation, leading to the phosphorylation of eIF-2α and cell death (49Jagus R. Joshi B. Barber G.N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Uncontrolled activation of PKR causes excessive cell death, leading to the universal hallmark of Fanconi anemia, bone marrow failure (50Fagerlie S. Lensch M.W. Pang Q. Bagby Jr., G.C. Exp. Hematol. 2001; 29: 1371-1381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These studies also resolve a current debate on the capacity of FANCC to function independently of the other FA proteins. That is, we observe an Hsp70-dependent anti-apoptotic function of FANCC that does not require the participation of any other FA protein, findings that align with the anti-apoptotic influence of FANCC in cells exposed to IFN-γ, TNF-α, and dsRNA (19Rathbun R.K.

Whether other classical functions of hsp70 require cooperative interactions of FANCC is unknown at this time, but the unexpected observation that high level binding of FANCC to PKR occurs in contexts in which Hsp70 is either absent or unattached to FANCC provides opportunities for probing PKR activation states in the context of this type of Fanconi anemia, one that can be now modeled in yeast. This model may facilitate the development of high throughput screening for prospective therapeutic agents.

In vertebrates and Drosophila, insulin-like signaling utilizes adaptor proteins that link activated growth factor receptors to intracellular signaling pathways (18Weinkove D. Leevers S.J.

Cell. 1999; 97: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Ligand binding activates the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin and IGF-I receptors, resulting in the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS). Phosphotyrosines on IRS act as binding sites for downstream targets of growth factor receptors such as PI3K and Ras/MAPK pathways. Biochemical and genetic studies in mammalian cells have shown that PI3K is a major component of signaling downstream from insulin and IGF-I receptors (21Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The PI3K adaptor subunits p85, p55, p50α, and p85β bind to phosphotyrosines within a YXXM motif on IRS and recruit the p110 catalytic subunit to the membrane for access to the lipid substrates. In addition, the interaction between the adaptor and catalytic subunits activates the p110 lipid kinase activity (22Holt K.H. Olson L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 42-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,23Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hirano M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We have investigated the functions of two C. elegans genes, one homologous to mammalian PI3K adaptor subunits namedaap-1 and the other homologous to IRS namedist-1. Genetic analysis demonstrates that aap-1and ist-1 both function in the daf-2/insulin-like pathway. The physical interactions between the PI3K catalytic and adaptor subunits are conserved in the worm homologs despite low sequence conservation in the intersubunit interaction domains. Previous studies have shown that dauer arrest in age-1 mutants is suppressed by a gain-of-function mutation in Akt/protein kinase B,akt-1(mg144gf) (5Paradis S. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Both ist-1 andaap-1 are required for akt-1(mg144gf) to suppress age-1 mutations. These findings indicate that the DAF-2/insulin receptor-like protein may activate both AGE-1 PI3K signaling and a parallel pathway that remains to be identified. Worm stocks were grown on nematode growth medium following established protocols (24Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following strains were used: N2 Bristol (wild type); GR1346 (sqt-1(sc13)age-1(mg44);akt-1(mg144)); GM9 (fer-15(b26);daf-2(m41)); GM7 (aap-1(m889);fer-15(b26);daf-2(m41)); and DR2227 (aap-1(m889);fer-15(b26)) (5Paradis S. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Life spans were determined as described previously (12Larsen P.L. Albert P.S. Riddle D.L. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1567-1583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the temperature-sensitive fer-15(b26) mutation to prevent progeny production in the test populations. Early L4 animals grown at 15 °C were transferred to 25.5 °C for sterilization and were scored daily for adult survival. Theaap-1 (Y110a7a.10) and ist-1(C54D1.3) gene structures were predicted using the GeneFinder and Blast gene prediction and analysis programs and were confirmed by sequencing partial cDNA clones (aap-1:yk442b3,ist-1:yk26d7, and yk110e3), which were obtained from the Genome Biology Laboratory at the National Institute of Genetics (Mishima Japan). The 5′ ends of these genes were cloned using 5′-RACE (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with total RNA obtained from a mixed population of wild-type (N2 Bristol) animals. The nucleotide coding sequences for aap-1 and ist-1 have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers AF209707 and AY064245, respectively. Sequence alignments were performed using GCG Pileup or SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool, smart.embl-heidelberg.de/), and the output was displayed using GCG Prettybox (GCG, Madison, WI). Theaap-1(m889) mutation was identified in a screen for long-lived mutants (28Muñoz M.I. Riddle D.L. Genetics. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and was back-crossed three times with thefer-15(b26) parent prior to analysis. To test whether the wild-type Y110A7A.10 sequence could rescue the 27 °C dauer arrest phenotype of theaap-1(m889) mutation, a 3.7-kb fragment including the Y110A7A.10 coding region and 963 bp of 5′ sequence were amplified from genomic DNA by nested PCR using outer primers GATATTCTCCACGAGTACCG and TGCTCATTGGACTTGTTGGC and inner primers GTCGTCAGCCGAGGAGCGCC and GGCCTGGTGGCTGGCAACGG. The PCR product was gel-purified and co-injected into the germ line ofaap-1(m889) with therol-6(s1006) marker plasmid. To test the Daf-c phenotype, Rol animals were placed at 27 °C, and both Rol and non-Rol progeny were scored. 42 Rol and 2 non-Rol progeny matured to the adult, whereas 52 non-Rol segregants that did not carry the transgenic array arrested at the dauer stage, demonstrating that the transgene complements the m889 mutation. An AAP-1 clone containing a COOH-terminal His6 tag was purified from bacterial lysates by binding to nickel-charged agarose beads (His-Bind Resin, Novagen, Madison, WI). The AAP-1-containing beads were incubated with crude extracts from bacteria expressing the NH2-terminal AGE-1-(1–268) fragment. After incubation with AGE-1-(1–268) lysate, the beads were pelleted and washed once with binding buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, 2% Triton X-100). The proteins bound to the beads were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the AGE-1-(1–268) fragment was detected with affinity-purified rabbit anti-AGE-1 polyclonal antibodies (1:300 dilution) using ECL detection (AmershamBiosciences) of horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:2500). For aap-1 and ist-1 RNA interference, a mixture of sense and antisense RNA (MEGAscript kit, Ambion, Austin, TX) of the aap-1 cDNA clone (yk442b3) or the ist-1 cDNA clone (yk26d7 or yk100e3) was injected at 1–5 μg/μl into L4 larvae and young adult hermaphrodites (25Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11651) Google Scholar). The injected animals were allowed to recover overnight at 15 °C and then shifted to 25 °C unless otherwise indicated to lay eggs. The injected parents were removed from the plate, and dauer arrest was assayed in the progeny 72 h later. Searches of the C. elegans genome sequence identified an open reading frame (Y110A7A.10) that contains the hallmarks of PI3K p50/p55 adaptor subunits, a pair of SH2 domains flanking a short inter-SH2 domain. We named this gene aap-1(AGE-1 adaptor protein). The mammalian PI3K adaptor subunits p85, p55 ,p50α, and p85β bind to phosphotyrosine within a YXXM motif in growth factor receptors and IRS (26Fantl W.J. Escobedo J.A. Martin G.A. Turck C.W. del Rosario M. McCormick F. Williams L.T. Cell. 1992; 69: 413-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). This binding is mediated by SH2 domains within the PI3K adaptor subunit. The SH2 domains in AAP-1 are most closely related in sequence to those in mammalian PI3K p85 and p55, suggesting that AAP-1 may have the same binding specificity as the mammalian proteins (Fig. 1, A andB). Although AAP-1 does not contain the extended amino terminus of p85, the worm genome does not contain any other p85-like genes, suggesting that AAP-1 is sufficient to provide adaptor subunit activity for AGE-1/p110. In mice, p50/p55α can compensate for the deletion of p85α in insulin-stimulated PI3K activation, although the absence of p85 causes altered glucose homeostasis (27Terauchi Y. Tsuji Y. Satoh S. Minoura H. Murakami K. Okuno A. Inukai K. Asano T. Kaburagi Y. Ueki K. Nakajima H. Hanafusa T. Matsuzawa Y. Sekihara H. Yin Y. Barrett J. Oda H. Ishikawa T. Akanuma Y. Komuro I. Suzuki M. Yamamura K. Kodama T. Suzuki H. Koyasu S. Tobe K. Fukui Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Binding by the adaptor subunit serves to stabilize and activate the PI3K p110 catalytic subunit. The intersubunit interactions are mediated by the p110 amino-terminal domain and the adaptor subunit inter-SH2 domain (22Holt K.H. Olson L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 42-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hirano M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The predicted intersubunit interaction domains of AAP-1 and AGE-1 are not well conserved with the Drosophilaand vertebrate homologs (data not shown). To determine whether AAP-1 binds to the AGE-1 amino terminus, this interaction was tested in vitro. When bound to beads, bacterially expressed AAP-1 co-precipitated an amino-terminal fragment of AGE-1-(1–268) containing the predicted interaction domain (Fig. 1 D). The AGE-1-(1–268) fragment did not bind to beads lacking AAP-1. This evidence indicates that the intersubunit interaction domains of PI3K are conserved in AGE-1 and AAP-1 despite low sequence conservation. An AAP-1::GFP translational fusion with 1.8 kb of upstream sequence (containing the presumptive promoter) was used to identify cells in which AAP-1 might function. Although AAP-1::GFP expression was weak, fluorescence was consistently observed in the intestine and in neurons and was occasionally observed in body wall muscles and the hypodermis (data not shown). Expression was observed at all developmental stages beginning with early embryos and continued through adulthood. AAP-1::GFP did not appear to perturbaap-1 or age-1 function in vivo, because AAP-1::GFP-containing animals appeared grossly normal and did not arrest at the dauer stage (data not shown). The expression pattern of aap-1 is similar to that of the age-1effectors akt-1, pdk-1, and daf-16, which are also widely expressed throughout development (5Paradis S. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 6Paradis S. Ailion M. Toker A. Thomas J.H. Ruvkun G.

Nature. 1997; 389: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). However, the GFP expression pattern may not represent the full expression pattern of the endogenous aap-1 gene. PI3K signaling by AGE-1 in C. elegans is required for wild-type adult lifespan and to bypass dauer larval arrest (4Morris J.Z. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1996; 382: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 12Larsen P.L. Albert P.S. Riddle D.L. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1567-1583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G.

Genetic analysis shows that a loss of aap-1gene activity also lengthens adult lifespan and causes dauer arrest, consistent with a function in the same pathway as age-1. Theaap-1(m889) mutation was identified in a selection for thermotolerant mutants (28Muñoz M.I. Riddle D.L. Genetics. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and was mapped to the left arm of chromosome I between unc-38 and dpy-5. An additional three-factor cross-mapped aap-1(m889) to a 0.34-map unit (242 kb) region between unc-38 andunc-63. The 41-kb YAC sequence between cosmid C30F8 andunc-63 contains 14 predicted genes includingY110A7A.10. The sequencing of Y110A7A.10 revealed an amber nonsense mutation in the m889 mutant at Trp-325 (TGG to TAG), which would result in a truncated protein that lacks the COOH-terminal 198 amino acids including the second SH2 domain (Fig.1 C). At 25.5 °C, aap-1(m889) mutant adults have a mean lifespan of 33 days, nearly twice as long as the controls (TableI). When grown at 27 °C,aap-1(m889) animals arrest development as dauer larvae (Table I). Dauer arrest at 27 °C is rescued by wild-type maternal aap-1 activity (data not shown), similar to the maternal rescue of age-1 mutations (13Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Genetics. 1998; 148: 703-717PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gottlieb S. Ruvkun G. Genetics. 1994; 137: 107-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DAF-16 forkhead-like transcription factor is necessary for dauer arrest and long lifespan in age-1 pathway mutants as well as the phenotypes of aap-1(m889) mutants (28Muñoz M.I. Riddle D.L. Genetics. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the presence of aap-1(m889) in a double mutant does not affect daf-2(m41) adult longevity. This is consistent with placing aap-1 into the same pathway as age-1.Table IThe aap-1 (m889) mutation causes dauer arrest and extends adult life spanGenotypeDauer larvae (27 °C)Adult life span (mean)1-aAll life span assays were done in thefer-15(b26) background to eliminate progeny from the survival tests.

Open table in a new tab To further support the hypothesis that aap-1 functions in the same pathway as age-1, we tested whether the loss of aap-1 function by RNA interference (RNAi) could enhance weak mutations in age-1 or in daf-2, encoding an insulin receptor-like protein that activates AGE-1 PI3K (1Kimura K.D. Tissenbaum H.A. Liu Y. Ruvkun G. Science. 1997; 277: 942-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar).aap-1(RNAi) did not cause any detectable phenotype in wild-type animals grown at 25.5 or 27 °C, the restrictive temperatures for many mutations in the daf-2pathway. However, we found that aap-1(RNAi) could enhance the phenotype of weak mutations in the daf-2pathway. age-1(hx546) is a weak allele ofage-1 that causes dauer arrest at 27 °C but not at 25.5 °C (17Dorman J.B. Albinder B. Shroyer T. Kenyon C. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1399-1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Apfeld J. Kenyon C. Nature. 1999; 402: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). aap-1(RNAi) dramatically enhanced dauer arrest at 25.5 °C in theage-1(hx546) background (Fig. 3 A).aap-1(RNAi) also enhanced dauer arrest indaf-2(e1370) mutants at a semi-permissive temperature (22 °C) (Fig. 3 B). Together, these results show that aap-1 potentiates signaling by thedaf-2/age-1 pathway. A TGF-β pathway also controls C. elegans dauer arrest in parallel to the daf-2/age-1 pathway (30Estevez M. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Albert P.S. Massague J. Riddle D.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 31Georgi L.L. Albert P.S. Riddle D.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 635-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The gene daf-1 encodes the type I TGF-β receptor essential for signaling through this pathway (31Georgi L.L. Albert P.S. Riddle D.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 635-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). aap-1(RNAi) in the daf-1(m40) mutant at semi-permissive temperature did not enhance dauer arrest, indicating thataap-1 activity is not required for signaling via the TGF-β branch of the dauer pathway (Fig. 3 B). A predicted protein distantly related to vertebrate IRS proteins was identified in the C. elegans genome (32Plowman G.D. Sudarsanam S. Bingham J. Whyte D. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13603-13610Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), which we named ist-1 (insulin receptorsubstrate). IRS proteins contain amino-terminal PH and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains for binding to activated insulin and IGF-I receptors (19White M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The IRS carboxyl terminus contains tyrosine substrates for insulin/IGF-I receptor kinase that upon phosphorylation act as docking sites for downstream effectors including PI3K and Ras/MAPK. The C. elegans IST-1 protein contains recognizable PH and PTB domains, although the overall sequence similarity is low. The PH domain of IST-1 is only 13–21% identical to the PH domains of other IRS proteins. The IST-1 PTB domain is better conserved and is 29% identical to the PTB domain of human IRS-1. IST-1 contains 22 tyrosines, some of which may recruit downstream proteins containing SH2 domain (Fig.2 C). There is a single YXXM motif for AAP-1/AGE-1 PI3K binding (Tyr-530). IRS proteins from other species also contain at least one YXXM binding site for PI3K. In addition, Tyr-321 in the PTB domain matches consensus binding sites for Grb-2 (YY/I/VXF/L/I/V) and SH-PTP2 (YV/IXV/I/L/P) (26Fantl W.J. Escobedo J.A. Martin G.A. Turck C.W. del Rosario M. McCormick F. Williams L.T. Cell. 1992; 69: 413-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 33Songyang Z. Shoelson S. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W. King F. Roberts T.

To date, neither protein has been implicated as a component of the DAF-2/insulin-like signaling pathway, although C. elegans homologs have been characterized (34Stern M. Marengere L. Daly R. Lowenstein E. Kokel M. Batzer A. Olivier P. Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1175-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 35Gutch M. Flint A. Keller J. Tonks N. Hengartner M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine whether IST-1 functions in the DAF-2 pathway, RNA interference was used to inactivate ist-1 function. As withaap-1, reduced ist-1 function is predicted to decrease daf-2 pathway activity, resulting in constitutive arrest at the dauer larval stage. Arrest at the dauer larval stage was not observed in wild-type animals withist-1(RNAi) when grown at either 27 or 25.5 °C (data not shown). However, ist-1(RNAi) enhanced dauer arrest in the age-1(hx546) background at 25.5 °C as observed with aap-1(RNAi) (Fig.3 A). This result is consistent with placing IST-1 in the DAF-2 pathway. Phosphorylation of IRS by the insulin receptor provides docking sites for downstream pathways including PI3K and Ras/MAP kinase pathways. To date, DAF-2/insulin receptor signaling has only been shown to act through the AGE-1/PI3K pathway. However, evidence suggests that DAF-2 also acts through a parallel AGE-1-independent pathway. A gain-of-function mutation in akt-1 suppresses dauer arrest in age-1 null mutants but not in daf-2 mutants (5Paradis S. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The akt-1(mg144gf) mutation contains an A183T substitution in the linker region between the PH and kinase domains and may activate the AKT-1 kinase activity in the absence of phospholipids. The inability of akt-1(mg144gf) to suppress daf-2 mutants has been postulated to suggest that signaling bifurcates downstream of DAF-2 to activate both AGE-1/PI3K and a parallel pathway. In addition, Gems et al. (3Gems D. Sutton A.J. Sundermeyer M.L. Albert P.S. King K.V. Edgley M.L. Larsen P.L. Riddle D.L. Genetics. 1998; 150: 129-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that some daf-2 mutants (e.g. e1370) have reduced signaling in both parallel pathways, whereas others (e.g. m41) are affected in only one. Class 1 mutants like m41 are dauer-constitutive, thermotolerant, and long-lived. Class 2 mutants exhibit these traits but are more pleiotropic with high levels of embryonic and L1 arrest, decreased adult motility, abnormal gonad morphology, and decreased broods. One scenario based on the modularity of insulin signaling in vertebrates is that IST-1 is necessary for the activation of parallel DAF-2 outputs. To test this possibility, ist-1 activity was inactivated inage-1(mg44);akt-1(mg144gf) double mutants. In this background, ist-1(RNAi) would cause dauer arrest only if IST-1 activates AGE-1-independent pathways. If the only function of IST-1 is to link AGE-1/PI3K to the DAF-2 receptor, akt-1(mg144gf) should suppress the phenotype of ist-1(RNAi) and then these animals will develop into fertile adults. In fact,ist-1(RNAi) caused significant dauer arrest inage-1(mg44);akt-1(mg144gf) mutants (Fig. 4). Interestingly,aap-1(RNAi) also mildly reversed theage-1(mg44);akt-1(mg144gf) phenotype. However, in this case, the majority of animals developed into dark sterile adults, an intermediate phenotype observed in animals with weakened DAF-2 pathway signaling (14Gottlieb S. Ruvkun G. Genetics. 1994; 137: 107-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observation thatist-1(RNAi) could revert theakt-1(mg144gf) phenotype inage-1(mg44) null mutants supports the hypothesis that the DAF-2 receptor can signal through multiple pathways. Using a combination of forward and reverse genetic approaches, we have demonstrated that the C. elegansDAF-2/insulin receptor utilizes an IRS-like protein, IST-1, and a PI3K p55-like adaptor subunit, AAP-1, to activate downstream signaling pathways. The description and characterization of these genes is necessary for understanding how signals are transduced from the DAF-2 receptor to AGE-1, the PI3K p110 catalytic subunit. Our results show that both AAP-1 and IST-1 are required for full DAF-2 pathway signaling. However, the relatively subtle phenotypes revealed by RNAi and by the aap-1(m889) mutation suggest that these genes may not be essential for DAF-2 pathway signaling under normal growth conditions. Mutations in aap-1 and ist-1 have not been identified in forward genetic screens for dauer arrest mutants. Theaap-1(m889) allele causes both developmental and lifespan phenotypes similar to those caused by mutations in otherdaf-2 pathway genes. In addition, the RNAi phenotypes provide support for placing aap-1 and ist-1 into the daf-2 pathway. RNAi can phenocopy the loss-of-function phenotypes of most genes. However, genes expressed in the C. elegans nervous system are usually resistant to RNAi. Bothdaf-2 and age-1 act in the nervous system to regulate dauer arrest and lifespan, although dauer arrest can be regulated by daf-2 pathway activity in some non-neuronal cell types such as intestine and muscle (36Apfeld J. Kenyon C. Cell. 1998; 95: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 37Wolkow C.A. Kimura K. Lee M. Ruvkun G. Science. 2000; 290: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The weak phenotypes resulting from aap-1 and ist-1 RNAi may reflect the inability to sufficiently remove the activities of the genes from the nervous system. An alternative explanation for the weak RNAi phenotypes we observed is that AAP-1 and IST-1 are dispensable for DAF-2 pathway signaling in otherwise wild-type backgrounds. This would suggest that the AGE-1/p110 catalytic subunit can be activated directly by the DAF-2 receptor or redundantly by another mechanism. The finding that null mutations in the Drosophila PI3K adaptor subunit Dp60 are not as severe as null mutations in the p110 catalytic subunit (Dp110) supports this view (38Britton J. Lockwood W. Li L. Cohan S. Edgar B. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 239-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). One explanation for these results may be that p110 has a low basal level of lipid kinase activity in the absence of receptor stimulation. In the fly and the worm, this low basal activity may be sufficient for normal or near-normal development under most conditions. Only when PI3K signaling is compromised in other ways,i.e. by mutations in the p110 catalytic subunit, is the requirement for the adaptor subunit revealed. In the mouse, signals from the insulin receptor are transduced via IRS to several redundant PI3K adaptor subunits p85α, p55α, p50α (all transcribed from the same gene), p85β, or p55PIK (39Fruman D. Meyers R. Cantley L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Recent genetic analysis of these adaptor proteins suggests that they act both positively and negatively with respect to insulin signaling. Knock-out mutants in either the gene encoding p85, p55, p50α, or p85β displayed increased insulin sensitivity as compared with wild type, suggesting that reductions in PI3K adaptor/regulatory protein activity is beneficial in this instance (27Terauchi Y. Tsuji Y. Satoh S. Minoura H. Murakami K. Okuno A. Inukai K. Asano T. Kaburagi Y. Ueki K. Nakajima H. Hanafusa T. Matsuzawa Y. Sekihara H. Yin Y. Barrett J. Oda H. Ishikawa T. Akanuma Y. Komuro I.

Cantley L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We find that the lack of aap-1 activity weakens the daf-2pathway, suggesting that negative inputs from PI3K adaptor subunits are not a general feature of insulin-like signaling pathways. The increased complexity and redundancy of the mammalian insulin pathways relative the C. elegans DAF-2 pathway may account for these phenotypic differences. We found that aap-1(RNAi) slightly enhanced dauer arrest in the age-1(mg44);akt-1(mg144gf) background. We had expected thataap-1(RNAi) would have no effect, becauseage-1(mg44) is a nonsense mutant that deletes the entire lipid kinase domain (4Morris J.Z. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1996; 382: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). In this background, aap-1activity should be dispensable. One explanation for this result is that AAP-1 weakly potentiates all signaling by the DAF-2 receptor, perhaps by competing with negative regulators for binding to the DAF-2. Our genetic experiments in theakt-1(mg144gf) background suggest that theC. elegans IRS homolog, IST-1, is necessary to activate an AGE-1-independent output of the DAF-2 receptor (Fig.5). In mammalian cells, IRS can couple to multiple outputs including the Ras/MAPK pathway and PI3K to mediate insulin receptor signaling (42White M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These proteins contain SH2 domains that recognize phosphotyrosines within specific amino acid motifs (33Songyang Z. Shoelson S. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R. Neel B. Birge R. Fajardo J. Chou M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar). For example, the p85 PI3K subunit binds to phosphotyrosine within a YXXM motif. The sequence of the Drosophila IRS protein, Chico, contains binding sites for PI3K, a known output ofDrosophila insulin signaling as well as potential GRB2/DRK and SH-PTP2 binding sites (20Bohni R. Riesgo-Escovar J. Oldham S. Brogiolo W. Stocker H. Andruss B.F. Beckingham K. Hafen E. Cell. 1999; 97: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). IST-1 contains a YXXM motif for PI3K binding and a potential SH-PTP2 consensus binding site (YV/IXV/I/L/P) (26Fantl W.J. Escobedo J.A. Martin G.A. Turck C.W. del Rosario M. McCormick F. Williams L.T. Cell. 1992; 69: 413-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). SH-PTP2 binding to IRS appears to attenuate responses of mammalian cells to insulin, suggesting that this protein could antagonize DAF-2 signaling in the worm (43Myers M. Mendez R. Shi P. Pierce J. Rhoads R. White M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26908-26914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In summary, we have characterized the genetic activities of theC. elegans homologs of mammalian PI3K adaptor/regulatory subunits, AAP-1, and IST-1. Reducing the functions of these genes in wild-type backgrounds did not disrupt development, suggesting that they may be dispensable for growth under normal conditions. However, anaap-1 nonsense mutation extends adult longevity. Both AAP-1 and IST-1 are required for development in the background of weak mutations in the insulin-like signaling pathway of the worm. By using a combination of reverse genetics and sensitized backgrounds, the roles of other proteins that potentiate signaling by the DAF-2 insulin pathway may be addressed. The aap-1 andist-1 cDNA clones were provided by Yuji Kohara (Genome Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima Japan), and pPD95.75 for constructing the AAP-1::GFP reporter was provided by Andy Fire (Carnegie Institution, Baltimore, MD).

The data presented here demonstrate that anginex is a powerful antiangiogenic agent with significant antitumor activity. The mechanism of action of anginex was found to be the induction of anoikis leading to apoptosis in angiogenically activated endothelial cells, resulting in an up to 90% inhibition of migration in the wound assay. Anginex inhibited angiogenesis as demonstrated in the in vitro mouse aortic ring assay. In addition, tumor-induced angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane was markedly inhibited. Anginex showed profound antitumor activity in the syngeneic mouse B16F10 melanoma model and in a xenograft human tumor model. Microvessel density determination as well as magnetic resonance imaging showed that the antitumor activity in these tumor models resulted from the antiangiogenic activity of anginex. A complete absence of toxicity was observed in these models. The data presented here demonstrate that anginex is a promising agent for further clinical development."
https://openalex.org/W2039458094,"The endocannabinoid system (i.e., the cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous ligands) plays an important role in the physiological control of intestinal motility. However, its participation in intestinal pathological states is still poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the possible role of the endocannabinoid system in the pathogenesis of paralytic ileus, a pathological state consisting of decreased intestinal motility following peritonitis, surgery, or other noxious situations. Ileus was induced by i.p. administration of acetic acid, and gastrointestinal propulsion was assessed by the charcoal method. Endocannabinoid levels were measured by isotope-dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, whereas cannabinoid CB1 receptors were identified by immunohistochemistry. Acetic acid administration inhibited gastrointestinal transit (ileus), and this effect was accompanied by increased levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide compared with control mice and by overexpression of CB1 receptors in myenteric nerves. Furthermore, acetic acid-induced ileus was alleviated by the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A and worsened by VDM11, a selective inhibitor of anandamide cellular uptake (and hence inactivation). From these findings, it can be concluded that the intestinal hypomotility typical of paralytic ileus is due, at least in part, to the enhancement of anandamide levels and CB1 expression during this condition, and that selective, nonpsychotropic CB1 receptor antagonists could represent new drugs to treat this disorder."

Mdm2 is also sumoylated in an in vitro system containing PIASxβ, PIAS1, and RanBP2. When several lysine residues of Mdm2 were sequentially mutated to arginine, the K182R mutant was not sumoylated in intact cells; however, in the in vitro system this mutant was sumoylated by PIAS1, PIASxβ, and RanBP2 as efficiently as the wild-type Mdm2 protein.

Only a Mdm2 protein bearing the K182R mutation is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Its ligase activity is dependent on the RING finger domain in its carboxyl terminus, because a mutation that disrupts this domain diminishes the ubiquitin ligase activity (2Honda R. Yasuda H.

Furthermore, when Akt kinase was activated by inositol 1,4,5-triposhpate (IP3) kinase, active Akt kinase phosphorylated Mdm2, resulting in activation of the ubiquitin ligase activity of Mdm2 and consequently the destabilization of p53 (15Zhou B.P.

SUMO is a ubiquitin-like protein, and mammals have three types of SUMO protein, i.e. SUMO-1, -2, and -3 (17Boddy M.N. Howe K. Etkin L.D. Solomon E. Freemont P.S.

In the latter, three enzymatic steps are necessary to ubiquitinylate the target protein (21Ciechanover A.

First, a ubiquitin moiety is activated by E1, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, in the presence of ATP and binds to a cysteine residue of the E1 enzyme through a thioester bond. The activated ubiquitin is then transferred to E2, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and then the ubiquitin-E2 complex binds to E3, the ubiquitin ligase, which then transfers the ubiquitin moiety to the target protein, or the ubiquitin moiety of the ubiquitin-E2 complex is transferred to E3, the ubiquitin ligase, and then the ubiquitin moiety is bound to the target protein. The sumoylation pathway in vitro requires the Sua1/Uba2 heterodimer as its E1 enzyme and Ubc9 as its E2 enzyme (24Okuma T. Honda R. Ichikawa G. Tsumagari N. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell. 2001; 107: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). PIAS1 and PIASy were shown to catalyze sumoylation of p53 and LEF-1, respectively (28Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 32Sachdev S. Bruhn L. Sieber H. Pichler A. Melchior F. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3088-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). PIAS1 and PIAS3 were initially cloned as transcriptional coregulators of the JAK-STAT pathway (33Liu B. Liao J. Rao X.

The PIAS family consists of at least the following six members: PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASxα, PIASxβ, PIASy, and a hypothetical protein (GenBankTM accession number CAB66507). All of them have RING finger-like domain, and their SUMO-E3 ligase activities are dependent on this domain (28Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 30Takahashi Y. Kahyo T. Toh-e A. Yasuda H. Kikuchi Y. J. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 107: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). More recently, RanBP2 was shown to be another type of SUMO-E3 ligase toward Sp100 or HDAC4 (35Picher A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 36Kirsh O. Seeler J.S. Pichler A. Gast A. Muller S. Miska E. Mathieu M. Harel-Bellan A. Kouzarides T. Melchior F. Dejean A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2682-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This protein is thought to act at the cytoplasmic filaments of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and to serve to modify substrates on their way to the nucleus. The SUMO-E3 ligase activity is found within a 33-kDa domain of RanBP2 (Ran BP2ΔFG) that lacks the RING finger-like domain, and this domain does not resemble any domain found in members of the PIAS family (35Picher A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). At least four kinds of functions have been proposed for protein sumoylation (37Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). One is a modulation of protein-protein interaction. When RanGAP1 is sumoylated, modified RanGAP1 can then bind to the RanBP2 (18Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 19Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F.

A. 1997; 94: 3736-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A second function is competition with ubiquitinylation, because sumoylation and ubiquitinylation share the same site (26Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). In this case, once a protein is sumoylated the ubiquitinylation does not occur any longer, and the protein thus remains stable. A third function is specification of the subcellular localization of a protein. For example, when the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is sumoylated, it becomes localized in PML bodies (39Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3117-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 40Ishov A.M. Sotnikov A.G. Negorev D. Vladimirova O.V. Neff N. Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. Strauss III, J.F.

Freemont P.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 381-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fourth function is the modification of the activities of other enzymes or factors that have biological functions (42Gostissa M. Hengstermann A. Fogal V. Sandy P. Schwarz S.E. Scheffiner M. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6462-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 43Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 23658-23663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The sumoylation of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) is a case in point (44David G. Neptune M.A. Depinho R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23658-23663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). When HDAC1 is sumoylated, its enzyme activity is increased. Concerning the sumoylation of Mdm2, the site and role of this modification have not yet been clarified (45Buschmann T. Fuchs S.Y. Lee C.G. Pan Z.Q. Ronei Z. Cell. 2000; 101: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 46Buschmann T. Fuchs S.Y. Lee C.G. Pan Z.Q. Ronei Z. Cell. 2001; 107: 549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Also, the SUMO-E3 for Mdm2 remains to be identified. Therefore, in this present study we sought to identify the SUMO-E3 for Mdm2. In addition to identifying E3 ligases for Mdm2, we also found the nuclear localization of Mdm2 to be important for the modification. Human SUMO-1 cDNA and human Ubc9 were obtained by the reverse transcription PCR method and were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) LysS. E. coli-expressing recombinant proteins were purified as described previously (24Okuma T. Honda R. Ichikawa G. Tsumagari N. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Human GST-Mdm2 and GST-tagged mutants, which were prepared by the PCR mutation method described previously (2Honda R. Yasuda H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), were expressed in a baculovirus expression system and purified by use of a glutathione-Sepharose4B resin as described earlier (12Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). U2OS cells were transfected with pFLAG-Mdm2, pFlag-SUMO1, pFlag-Flag-SUMO1, pEGFP-PIAS, or pEGFP-Mdm2 by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a 24 h-incubation, the cells were lysed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After the proteins had been transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, Western blotting using anti-Mdm2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-GFP antibody (MBL) was performed; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and ECL reagents (AmershamBiosciences) were used for detection, as described previously (1Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Logarithmically growing U2OS cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with wild-type Mdm2 or the mutants by using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were fixed for 20 min with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS (−), and washed 3 times with PBS (−). Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Microscopic observation was made using a Olympus LSC101. An in vitrosumoylation assay was done as described previously (28Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-Mdm2 or mutants were purified with glutathione-Sepharose4B, mixed with purified 0.36 μg of E1 (GST-Sua1/His-Uba2), 20 ng of Ubc9, 1.1 μg of SUMO-1, and a specified amount of GST-PIASxβ or RanBP2 and then incubated at 25 °C for 30 min in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 3 mm ATP in a 30-μl volume. Ubc9, SUMO-1, and RanBP2ΔFG were expressed in E. coli (BL21) by using the pET vector; E1, PIAS, and Mdm2 were expressed in Sf-9 cells by using a baculovirus protein expression system (Invitrogen). The glutathione-Sepharose4B resin was washed with 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 0.01% Brij. The resin was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted with anti-SUMO-1 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or anti-Mdm2 antibody. The most prominent form of Mdm2 in a cell migrates as a protein of ∼92 kDa in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, although the molecular mass calculated from its cDNA sequence is 55.2 kDa. This 92-kDa Mdm2 in a cell has been proposed to be its sumoylated form, and a smaller prominent Mdm2 with a molecular mass of about 75 kDa has been considered to be its non-modified form (45Buschmann T. Fuchs S.Y. Lee C.G. Pan Z.Q. Ronei Z. Cell. 2000; 101: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, another report indicated a 75-kDa protein to be translated from the second methionine of Mdm2 (47Perry M.E. Mendrysa S.M. Saucedo L.J. Tannous P. Holubar M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5733-5738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, when we started our study on the sumoylation of Mdm2, we addressed the issue as to whether this 92-kDa Mdm2 is a SUMO-modified form or not. When the Mdm2 in USO2 cells was immunoblotted with anti-Mdm2 antibody, the prominent Mdm2 protein showed a molecular mass of about 92 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 2). When FLAG-tagged Mdm2 was expressed in U2OS cells, the FLAG-Mdm2 showed a molecular mass of ∼93 kDa, which was bigger by 1 kDa than the Mdm2 in U2OS cells (Fig. 1, lane 3). This difference corresponds to the molecular mass of the FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK). To know whether this 92-kDa Mdm2 was sumoylated Mdm2, we expressed non-tagged Mdm2 in E. coli, which does not have a SUMO modification system. The prominently expressed Mdm2 that reacted with the anti-Mdm2 antibody migrated to the same place in the SDS gel as did the Mdm2 in U2OS cells (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and2). Furthermore, two minor anti-Mdm2-reacting proteins, whose molecular masses were ∼75 and 76 kDa, were detected in bothE. coli and U2OS cells (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and3). The faster migrating protein could be Mdm2 translated from the second ATG at codon 50 as described previously (47Perry M.E. Mendrysa S.M. Saucedo L.J. Tannous P. Holubar M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5733-5738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), although the nature of the slower migrating one is unknown. These data indicate that the most prominent cellular form of Mdm2, having a molecular mass of 92 kDa, is not its sumoylated form. The molecular mass of its sumoylated form on an SDS-PAGE gel would be expected to be ∼110 kDa. PIAS1 and PIASy have been shown to have SUMO-E3 activities (28Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 32Sachdev S. Bruhn L. Sieber H. Pichler A. Melchior F. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3088-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Therefore, we explored the possibility that PIAS family members can function as an E3 toward Mdm2. U2OS cells were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged Mdm2, FLAG-tagged SUMO-1, and a given GFP-PIAS protein; the sumoylation of Mdm2 was then checked by immunoblotting with the anti-Mdm2 antibody. In the case of no expression of PIAS proteins (Fig.2 A, lane 10), two proteins were detected by the anti-Mdm2 antibody; the faster migrating band was thought to be an endogenous Mdm2, and the slower migrating one was thought to be ectopically expressed FLAG-Mdm2 (as was shown in Fig.1). In contrast, when PIAS1 or PIASxβ was co-expressed with the Mdm2 plasmid and the FLAG-SUMO-plasmid, a band migrating more slowly than the Mdm2 bands appeared (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and8) and was suspected to be sumoylated Mdm2. To confirm that this anti-Mdm2 antibody-reactive band was indeed sumoylated Mdm2, we transfected the cells with FLAG-FLAG (2×FLAG)-tagged SUMO-1 in place of FLAG-tagged SUMO-1. The slower migrating band of Mdm2 was shifted to a higher molecular mass when 2×FLAG-tagged SUMO-1 was used than when FLAG-tagged SUMO-1 had been used (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 9). These results indicate that the slower migrating band was sumoylated Mdm2. In contrast, the expression of PIASxα did not enhance the sumoylation of Mdm2 (Fig. 2 A,lanes 4–6). Furthermore, when cells were transfected with the PIASxβ RING finger mutant (C362S or C362A), the sumoylation of Mdm2 was not enhanced (Fig. 2 B). In Fig. 2 C, the expression level of each PIAS protein is shown. Although the cells were transfected with the same amount of each PIAS protein, the expression levels of PIASxα and wild-type PIASxβ were lower than those of PIAS1, PIASxβ-CS and PIASxβ-CA. These data thus indicate that PIAS1 and PIASxβ enhanced the sumoylation of Mdm2 in intact cells in a RING finger-like domain-dependent manner. Next, we conducted in vitro sumoylation by using purified recombinant Mdm2 proteins as the substrate (Fig.3, A and B). To confirm that PIASxβ has indeed SUMO-E3 ligase activity toward the Mdm2, we prepared and purified the recombinant protein and checked its activity. In the absence of PIASxβ, no sumoylated Mdm2 bands were detected (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). In contrast, the addition of PIASxβ to the assay system enhanced the sumoylation of the Mdm2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 A,lanes 2–4). When we used PIAS1 in place of PIASxβ, similar results were obtained (data not shown). More recently, RanBP2 was shown to be another type of SUMO-E3 toward Sp100 or HDAC4 (35Picher A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 36Kirsh O. Seeler J.S. Pichler A. Gast A. Muller S. Miska E. Mathieu M. Harel-Bellan A. Kouzarides T. Melchior F. Dejean A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2682-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether RanBP2 might also function as a SUMO-E3 toward Mdm2. We performed an in vitro sumoylation assay in the presence or absence of GST-RanBP2ΔFG, which is the minimal fragment containing the SUMO-E3 ligase activity (35Picher A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). In the absence of RanBP2ΔFG, no sumoylated Mdm2 bands were detected by anti-SUMO-1 antibody (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). The addition of RanBP2ΔFG to the assay system enhanced the sumoylation of Mdm2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2–4). Thus, RanBP2 also functioned as a SUMO-E3 toward Mdm2. When a 10-fold greater amount of Ubc9 than the usual amount was added to this assay, the sumoylated band was detected even in the absence of RanBP2 (Fig. 3 B, lane 5). RanBP2 has been shown to be localized at nuclear pores. So next we examined the subcellular location of PIAS1 and PIASxβ. As shown in Fig. 4, both PIAS1 and PIASxβ, appearing as dot-like structures, were localized in nuclei. These data suggest that Mdm2 is sumoylated during nuclear translocation by RanBP2 and then further sumoylated in nuclei by PIASxβ or PIAS1. Next, to determine the sumoylation site of Mdm2, we mutated eight lysine residues of Mdm2 and then transfected U2OS cells with this mutant in the presence of GFP-PIASxβ and FLAG-tagged SUMO-1. This mutant, which we call 8KR (K182R/K185R/K334R/K336R/K338R/K344R/K346R/K422R), was not sumoylated in the U2OS cells (Fig.5 A, lanes 1 and2). Therefore, we tried to identify the responsible lysine residue(s) for the sumoylation. The K182R mutant was proven not to be sumoylated in the cells (Fig. 5 A, lanes 7 and8). This lysine 182 residue is in the nuclear localization signal (NLS), and the GFP-tagged K182R mutant was directly observed by fluorescence microscopy to be localized exclusively in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6). The lysine 185 is also localized in the NLS, but K185R was sumoylated just like the wild-type Mdm2 (Fig. 5 A, lanes 9–12). The wild-type Mdm2 and K185R mutant were localized in nuclei and not in the cytoplasm, but K182R/K185R was localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6). Furthermore, 2RTL (R181T/R183L), a mutant that has mutations in its NLS, was hardly sumoylated (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and4); this mutant was localized mainly in the cytoplasm (data not shown).Figure 6K182R mutant is exclusively localized in the cytoplasm. U2OS cells were transfected with wild-type pEGFP-Mdm2, pEGFP-K182R mutant, pEGFP-K185R mutant, or pEGFP-K182R/K185R mutant. The nuclei were stained with DAPI, and the localization of Mdm2 was detected by fluorescence microscopy.

The purified wild-type Mdm2 was sumoylated in the presence of PIAS1xβ in vitro, as was the K182R mutant (Figs. 3 A and 5, B and C). RanBP2 also functioned as a SUMO-E3 toward both wild-type Mdm2 and the mutantin vitro (Figs. 3 B and 5, B andC). Therefore, these data suggest that nuclear import is necessary for Mdm2 to be sumoylated. Here we showed that the sumoylation of Mdm2, a ubiquitin ligase toward p53, was enhanced in the presence of PIAS1, xβ, or RanBP2 acting as a SUMO-E3. We also showed that the K182R mutant, which was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, was not sumoylated in intact cells. Although sumoylation of the proteins has been shown to occur in the presence of SUMO-E1, E2, Ubc9, and SUMO in the absence of a SUMO-E3, recently the extent of the sumoylation was shown to increase markedly in the presence of the PIAS family or RanBP2 serving as a SUMO-E3 (28Kahyo T.

Seeler J.S. Pichler A. Gast A. Muller S. Miska E. Mathieu M. Harel-Bellan A. Kouzarides T. Melchior F. Dejean A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2682-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Mdm2 can be sumoylated in vitro without E3, but SUMO-E3 may function in vivo. To assess the possibility that PIAS family members function as a SUMO-E3, we transfected U2OS cells with Mdm2 and SUMO along with a PIAS family member and found that Mdm2 was clearly sumoylated in the presence of PIASxβ or PIAS1. Furthermore, PIASxβ mutants with a mutation in the RING finger like domain did not have SUMO-E3 activity. In the in vitroSUMO-conjugating system, both PIASxβ and RanBP2 functioned as a SUMO-E3 toward Mdm2; but in the case of p53 sumoylation, PIAS family members functioned as a SUMO-E3, but RanBP2 did not (28Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 35Picher A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). On the contrary, it has been shown that RanBP2 functions as a SUMO-E3 toward HDAC4 and Sp100 but that members of the PIAS family do not. Mdm2 is the first protein whose sumoylation is enhanced by both the PIAS family and RanBP2. This suggests that there are three kinds of sumoylated protein: 1) the protein sumoylated only by RanBP2 at the nuclear pore during import into the nucleus; 2) the protein sumoylated only in the nucleus by a PIAS; and 3) the protein sumoylated by RanBP2 and a PIAS at the nuclear pore during import into the nucleus and in the nucleus, respectively. The lysine residues of Mdm2 were sequentially mutated to arginine, and the sumoylation of the mutants was checked in the cells transfected with a PIAS or in vitro in the presence of a PIAS or RanBP2 as SUMO-E3. The K182R mutant was not sumoylated in intact cells. However, this mutant was sumoylated in vitro in the presence of the PIAS protein or RanBP2 as a SUMO-E3. K182 is in located in the NLS of Mdm2, and the K182R mutant was exclusively localized in the cytoplasm. Possibly, nuclear import is necessary for Mdm2 to be sumoylated (48Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), because PIAS1 and PIASxβ are localized in nuclei, and RanBP2 is in the nuclear pore. A recent paper (36Kirsh O. Seeler J.S. Pichler A. Gast A. Muller S. Miska E. Mathieu M. Harel-Bellan A. Kouzarides T. Melchior F. Dejean A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2682-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) indicated that HDAC4 was sumoylated in the presence of RanBP2 but not in the presence of PIAS and that the molecule with its NLS mutated was not sumoylated. We propose that Mdm2 is sumoylated when it enters the nucleus through the nuclear pore,where RanBP2 is and that Mdm2 is further sumoylated in the nucleus by PIAS protein. Furthermore, Lys-182 is not a lysine residue conforming to the consensus siteYKXE for protein sumoylation, where Yis a large hydrophobic residue and X is any amino acid residue. To elucidate the meaning of the sumoylation of Mdm2, it is important to know what kinds of signal can induce the sumoylation or de-sumoylation of Mdm2. The level of the sumoylation is a balance between the activities of sumoylation enzyme (E1, or Sua1/uba2, E2, or Ubc9, and maybe SUMO-ligase, the PIAS protein, or RanBP2) and SUMO-isopeptidase. Of the sumoylation enzymes, E1, Ubc9, and/or SUMO-ligase are possible candidates to be regulated in the course of signal exposure. There are several SUMO-isopeptidases reported to date (37Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Possibly one or more of them are responsible for removing the SUMO moiety from Mdm2, but the responsible enzymes remain to be identified. To further discuss the function of sumoylation of Mdm2, it is necessary to identify the sumoylated lysine residue(s) in Mdm2 without affecting the nuclear localization signal. However, because both RanBP2 and PIAS protein seem to function as a SUMO-E3 for Mdm2 and may sumoylate it at a different lysine residue(s), it may not be easy to identify which E3 sumoylates which residue. Because the sumoylation site of p53 sumoylated by E1 and E2 is the same as the site using E1, E2, and SUMO-E3 or PIAS1, 2T. Kahyo, R. Honda, G. Ichikawa, T. Nishida, and H. Yasuda, manuscript in preparation. the sumoylated site in Mdm2 could possibly be the same site detected by using E1 and E2 in vitro (49Bernier-Villamor V. Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D.

https://openalex.org/W2098963270,"Nitric oxide (NO) has multiple important actions that contribute to the maintenance of vascular homeostasis. NO is synthesized by three different isoforms of NO synthase (NOS), all of which have been reported to be expressed in human atherosclerotic vascular lesions. Although the regulatory roles of endothelial NOS (eNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) on the development of atherosclerosis have been described, little is known about the role of neuronal NOS (nNOS). Here, we show that nNOS also exerts important vasculoprotective effects in vivo. In a carotid artery ligation model, nNOS gene-deficient (nNOS-KO) mice exhibited accelerated neointimal formation and constrictive vascular remodeling caused by blood flow disruption. In a rat balloon injury model, the selective inhibition of nNOS activity potently enhanced vasoconstrictor responses to a variety of calcium-mobilizing stimuli, suppressed tissue cGMP concentrations, a marker of vascular NO production, and exacerbated neointimal formation. In both models, nNOS was absent before injury and was up-regulated only after the injury, and was predominantly expressed in the neointima and medial smooth muscle cells. These results provide the first direct evidence that nNOS plays important roles in suppressing arteriosclerotic vascular lesion formation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2058244846,"We have previously demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident molecular chaperones interact with apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB) during its maturation. The initial stages of apoB folding occur while it is bound to the ER membrane, where it becomes partially lipidated to form a primordial intermediate. We determined whether this intermediate is dependent on the assistance of molecular chaperones for its subsequent folding steps. To that end, microsomes were prepared from HepG2 cells and luminal contents were subjected to KBr density gradient centrifugation. Immunoprecipitation of apoB followed by Western blotting showed that the luminal pool floated at a density of 1.12 g/ml and, like the membrane-bound pool, was associated with GRP94, ERp72, BiP, calreticulin, and cyclophilin B. Except for calreticulin, chaperone/apoB ratio in the lumen was severalfold higher than that in the membrane, suggesting a role for these chaperones both in facilitating the release of the primordial intermediate into the ER lumen and in providing stability. Subcellular fractionation on sucrose gradients showed that apoB in the Golgi was associated with the same array of chaperones as the pool of apoB recovered from heavy microsomes containing the ER, except that chaperone/apoB ratio was lower. KBr density gradient fractionation showed that the major pool of luminal apoB in the Golgi was recovered from 1.02 < d < 1.08 g/ml, whereas apoB in ER was recovered primarily from 1.08 < d < 1.2 g/ml. Both fractions were associated with the same spectrum of chaperones. Together with the finding that GRP94 was found associated with sialylated apoB, we conclude that correct folding of apoB is dependent on the assistance of molecular chaperone, which play multiple roles in its maturation throughout the secretory pathway including distal compartments such as the trans-Golgi network."
https://openalex.org/W2090762954,"The ultimate goal of radiotherapy is to induce irreversible damages in genetically unstable, fast-growing cancer cells while minimizing the cytotoxic effects on host tissues. The satus of the tumor vasculature is particular because it is located within the tumor but mostly arises from host cells. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of low-dose irradiation on the function of endothelial cells lining tumor vessels. Using isolated arterioles mounted on a pressure myograph, we first documented that the nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasorelaxation that was defective in tumor vessels was completely restored following local tumor irradiation. Immunoblot analyses revealed that this was attributable to an increase in the abundance of the endothelial NO synthase while the expression of its physiological inhibitor, caveolin-1, was reduced. We further showed that the potentiation of the NO-dependent pathway induced a marked increase in tumor blood flow and oxygenation that determined the higher sensitivity of the tumor to further irradiation. Finally, we documented that the NO-mediated effects of irradiation on the tumor vasculature increased the delivery and expression of a reporter gene into the tumor. Thus, low-dose irradiation of endothelial cells within a tumor is a key determinant of the effectiveness of radiotherapy and may offer a new strategy to increase gene and/or drug delivery to the tumor."
https://openalex.org/W2015013519,"Ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) subunits contain a ∼400-residue extracellular N-terminal domain (“X domain”), which is sequence-related to bacterial amino acid-binding proteins and to class C G-protein-coupled receptors.

These ligand-gated channels are believed to be tetramers consisting of subclass-specific sets of homologous subunits, each ∼900–1300 amino acid residues in length (1Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D.

Previous studies have identified three segments in iGluR subunits that show sequence similarity to bacterial proteins involved in the transport of extracellular solutes (3O′Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O.

Two segments, S1 and S2, separated by the membrane-associated channel domain, form a two-lobed agonist-binding domain, which is homologous to bacterial polar amino acid-binding proteins (4Kuryatov A.

In addition, an N-terminal ∼400-residue segment preceding S1 shows sequence similarity to bacterial binding proteins specific for leucine (LBP) and leucine/isoleucine/valine (LIVBP) and to the N-terminal extracellular N-terminal segments of Class C G-protein-coupled receptors, which include the metabotropic glutamate receptors (3O′Hara P.J.

The three-dimensional structure of this domain has not been determined, but homology models predict an LIVBP-like structure consisting of two lobes surrounding a central cleft (8Masuko T. Kashiwagi K. Kuno T. Nguyen N.D. Pahk A.J. Fukuchi J. Igarashi K. Williams K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 957-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Paoletti P. Perin-Dureau F. Fayyazuddin A. Le Goff A. Callebaut I. Neyton J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 911-925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domains of human and rat AMPA receptor subunits are ∼95% identical. This high degree of sequence conservation is certainly indicative of an essential physiological function. In contrast to the agonist-binding domain and the transmembrane channel region, however, the functional role of this domain, which in AMPA and kainate receptors may represent up to 45% of the mature polypeptide, is poorly understood, hence it is referred to as the “X domain.” In principle, functional activities assigned to or suggested for the N-terminal domain fall into three different classes. First, this domain is implicated as a determinant in the assembly of oligomeric channels (10Leuschner W.D. Hoch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16907-16916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 11Kuusinen A. Abele R. Madden D.R. Keinänen K. J. Biol.

Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Second, the X domain may mediate the allosteric transitions involved in the channel activation, desensitization, or modulation by ions and drugs as has been observed for NMDA receptors (8Masuko T.

Neuron. 1998; 20: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Third, the X domain may provide docking sites for extracellular proteins, which serve to cluster the receptors or stabilize their localization. In support of the latter possibility is a recent report of an extracellular interaction of AMPA receptors with a synaptic protein Narp, although the detailed site of the interaction was not localized (18O'Brien R.J. Xu D. Petralia R.S. Steward O. Huganir R.L. Worley P. Neuron. 1999; 23: 309-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the function of the N-terminal domain in the AMPA receptors, we have examined the properties of GluR-D (GluR4) receptors carrying N-terminal deletions. We report that, surprisingly, homomeric AMPA receptors that lack the entire X domain form functional glutamate-gated channels in transfected HEK 293 cells. A closer analysis of the properties of the mutant channels shows that the assembly of homomeric receptors, transport to cell surface, ligand binding, agonist-triggered channel activation, and rapid desensitization can occur normally in the complete absence of the X domain. Standard molecular biological techniques were used to clone the cDNA encoding residues 22–902 of rat GluR-D (flip isoform; residues 1–21 code for the signal peptide; Ref. 19Sommer B. Keinänen K.

Arvola M. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). All N-terminal deletion constructs were built on this vector (wild-type GluR-D). The deletion mutants, created by PCR methodology, were used to replace the native region in wild-type GluR-D by appropriate restriction enzyme digest. All PCR-generated constructs were verified by sequencing. The recombinant baculovirus for the expression of GluR-D Δ402 was prepared by using Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) cultured in T75 flasks in serum-free SF-900II medium were infected with recombinant baculoviruses for FLAG-tagged full-length GluR-D (11Kuusinen A. Abele R. Madden D.R. Keinänen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28937-28943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and Δ402 and harvested 48 h later. Preparation of membranes, determination of [3H]AMPA (specific activity 60.0 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) binding by using a filtration assay, and displacement experiments using unlabeled compounds were performed as described previously (11Kuusinen A. Abele R. Madden D.R. Keinänen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28937-28943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Ligand binding data were analyzed by using the PRISM nonlinear curve-fitting software (GraphPad Inc.). HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution. Immediately prior to transfection they were replated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml. Transfection was done by using the calcium phosphate method, and the medium was changed the following day and the cells harvested 40 h following transfection. For patch clamp experiments the cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (pEGFP-C1, Clontech) for visualization with epifluorescence microscope. For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, and preblocked with 3% goat serum. For total staining, the cells were additionally incubated in 0.05% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline prior to blocking step. Cells were labeled with monoclonal anti-FLAG IgG (M1, Sigma; 5 μg/ml) followed by Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories; 7 μg/ml). Cells were examined using an Olympus Provis AX70 epifluorescence microscope and pictures collected by a Photometrics SenSys air-cooled CCD camera using Image ProPlus software. Transfected HEK 293 cells were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) at a density of 4 × 104 cells per well. Cells were fixed 40 h post-transfection by either 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (for surface labeling) or by 100% methanol at −20 °C (for total labeling). Following incubation in 3% goat serum to block nonspecific binding, the cells were labeled with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M1; 100 ng per well) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with 1% goat serum, and incubated with Eu3+-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Wallac; 25 ng per well) for 1 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, the cells were washed as above, rinsed with Tris-buffered saline, and Enhancement solution (Wallac; 100 μl per well) was added to form the fluorescent Eu3+-chelate. The samples were measured on a Wallac VICTOR2 instrument using excitation filter at 340 nm and emission filter at 615 nm settings and a delay time of 400 μs. The fluorescence values (recorded as cpm) for the surface and total labeling were corrected for the nonspecific background obtained from HEK 293 cells transfected for expression of non-FLAG-tagged GluR-D. Glutamate and AMPA currents were recorded from HEK 293 cells 48 h after transfection using the outside-out configuration of the patch clamp technique. Recording pipettes had a resistance of 3–5 MΩ, when filled with a solution containing (in mm): potassium-gluconate, 110; NaCl, 2.5; Hepes, 10; EGTA, 10, pH 7.3 (adjusted with KOH). The patches were continuously superfused with the extracellular solution containing (in mm): MgCl2, 1; NaCl, 150; KCl, 2.5; CaCl2, 2; Hepes, 10, pH 7.35 (adjusted with NaOH). Glutamate, AMPA, and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) were directly dissolved in extracellular solution. Cyclothiazide was added from a stock made in ethanol. All compounds were from Tocris Cookson. Rapid applications of agonists were made using the SF-77B perfusion fast step system with a narrow-mouthed theta tube (Warner Instrument Corporation). Rise time of glutamate currents was less than 1 ms. No currents were observed in untransfected cells or cells transfected with a nonrelevant cDNA construct. The currents were recorded using an EPC 9 patch clamp with Pulse and Pulsefit software (HEKA Electronics). Desensitization rate constant (τdes) was determined by fitting a single exponential to the decaying component of currents elicited by 5 mm glutamate. Concentration-response relationships were fitted with a logistic equation using Microcal Origin software. The data were compared using Student's t test. All data are given as mean ± S.E. To gain insight into how the N-terminal X domain contributes to the properties of AMPA receptors, we analyzed receptors mutated to eliminate all or parts of this domain. N-terminally FLAG-tagged GluR-D (flip isoform) and mutants lacking increasing lengths of the N-terminal segment (residues 22–541; signal peptide: 1–21; Fig.1 A) of GluR-D were transiently expressed in transfected HEK 293 cells. The expression of the mutant proteins was verified by immunoblotting, which showed the presence of FLAG-immunoreactive bands with electrophoretic mobilities consistent with the sizes inferred for the deletion constructs from the sequence and predicted glycosylation status (Fig. 1 B). The expression levels of the N-terminal deletion constructs Δ162, Δ303, and Δ366 were roughly equivalent to that of the full-length GluR-D, but the two smallest constructs, Δ402, lacking the entire X domain, and Δ541, which lacked the whole N-terminal extracellular domain (i.e.both the X domain and the ligand-binding S1 segment), were expressed often at a somewhat lower level (Fig. 1 B). The subcellular distribution of the deletion mutants was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Under permeabilized conditions, all constructs showed intracellular staining by anti-FLAG antibody (Fig.2). In contrast, only two constructs, the full-length GluR-D and Δ402, devoid of the entire X domain, were expressed on cell surface as indicated by specific immunostaining under nonpermeabilizing conditions (Fig. 2). Both stainings had a finely punctate appearance that was evenly distributed over the cell membrane. These findings imply that deletions within (the predicted) structural domains (X and S1S2) of the receptor, unlike a complete deletion of the X domain, block the transport of the receptor to cell surface, possibly due to incorrect folding. The latter possibility is consistent with our finding that none of the deletion mutants was stained by a monoclonal antibody Fab22, which recognizes a conformation-sensitive epitope within the X domain of GluR-D (20Jespersen L.K. Kuusinen A. Orellana A. Keinänen K. Engberg J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1382-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), although cells expressing the full-length GluR-D were intensely stained both intracellularly and on cell surface (results not shown). To complement the immunofluorescence studies, we used europium-labeled secondary antibody to quantitate the relative amounts of FLAG-tagged full-length GluR-D and Δ402 present on cell surface. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements indicated that 84 ± 14% (mean of surface labeling/total labeling ± S.D.; n = 4) of the full-length receptor and 66 ± 13% of Δ402 (n = 4) were accessible to Eu3+-labeled anti-mouse IgG in fixed cells under nonpermeabilizing conditions; the slight decrease is statistically not significant (in nonpairedt test). No significant surface labeling was obtained with receptor constructs that were negative in immunofluorescence microscopy (results not shown). The expression level of Δ402 was similar (105 ± 8%) to that of the full-length GluR-D as determined by europium labeling. Next, we wished to determine whether the presence or absence of the X domain has any influence on the interaction of the receptor with agonists and antagonist as determined by radioligand binding experiments. To obtain larger amounts of receptor protein to facilitate more accurate radioligand binding measurements, we used the baculovirus expression system to produce full-length GluR-D and GluR-D Δ402. Virally infected High Five insect cells produced GluR-D and GluR-D Δ402 as 110-kDa and 50-kDa FLAG-immunoreactive species (Fig.3 A). Consistent with results obtained with the soluble extracellular domains of GluR-D (11Kuusinen A. Abele R. Madden D.R. Keinänen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28937-28943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), deletion of the X domain did not have any significant effect on the binding affinity of [3H]AMPA (GluR-D:K d 42 ± 6 nm, n = 4; Δ402: K d 45 ± 3 nm,n = 3; Fig. 3 B). The expression level of Δ402 in High Five cells was consistently higher than that of the full-length receptors. The Bmax determined for [3H]AMPA binding in the membrane preparations was 12.1 pmol/mg of protein for GluR-D (n = 4), whereas for Δ402 membranes a Bmax value of 45.3 ± 4.5 pmol/mg of protein (n = 3) was obtained. No differences between GluR-D and Δ402 membranes were observed in the relative abilities of the unlabeled agonists (glutamate and kainate), and the unlabeled antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX) to inhibit [3H]AMPA binding. The apparent affinities of unlabeled glutamate (GluR-D: K i 0.20 ± 0.06 μm, n = 4; Δ402: K i0.26 ± 0.05 μm, n = 4), kainate (GluR-D: K i 2.10 ± 0.14 μm,n = 4; Δ402: K i 3.5 ± 1.8 μm, n = 3), or 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, a competitive antagonist (GluR-D:K i 0.55 ± 0.18 μm,n = 4; Δ402: K i 0.42 ± 0.16 μm, n = 4) (Fig. 3 C) are as indicated. These findings indicate that the presence or absence of the X domain in the native receptor does not have any significant effect on the interaction of agonists and competitive antagonists with the ligand binging domain. The unaltered membrane localization and ligand binding properties of Δ402 suggested the possibility that functional receptors may be formed by GluR-D subunits lacking the X domain. To investigate this, outside-out patches were pulled from HEK 293 cells transiently expressing the full-length GluR-D and Δ402. As expected, bothl-glutamate and AMPA triggered rapidly desensitizing currents in GluR-D-containing patches. Surprisingly, however, highly similar agonist responses were recorded from the Δ402-containing patches (Fig. 4 A). The glutamate sensitivity of Δ402 channels was also similar to that of wild-type channels (Fig. 4 A). However, further analysis revealed a slight change in desensitization kinetics: the rate of desensitization of glutamate responses was somewhat slower for the Δ402 channels (τdes 4.52 ± 0.31 ms,n = 5) than for GluR-D (3.47 ± 0.24 ms,n = 6; p = 0.024; Fig. 4 B). Responses of Δ402 channels to 1 mm glutamate were also fully blocked by the specific AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX (100 μm; Fig. 4 C), consistent with its unchanged antagonist binding characteristics. Finally, we studied the effect of cyclothiazide, an allosteric modulator of AMPA receptor desensitization, on GluR-D and Δ402. By using a filtration assay, we measured the inhibitory effect of cyclothiazide on [3H]AMPA binding to GluR-D and to Δ402 expressed on insect cell membranes. As shown in Fig.5 A, cyclothiazide caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of [3H]AMPA binding on both GluR-D (IC5011.1 ± 1.0 μm, n = 4) and Δ402 (IC50 10.3 ± 1.9 μm; n= 4) receptors. The IC50 values and the level of maximal inhibition (∼50%) are close to the previously reported value for the flip isoform of GluR-D (16 μm, ∼60%; Ref. 21Kessler M. Rogers G. Arai A. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 287: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate that the cyclothiazide binding site, and the structures mediating its allosteric effect on agonist binding, are present in the deletion construct as well. We then studied the effect of cyclothiazide current responses of GluR-D and Δ402 channels expressed in HEK 293 cells. Consistent with the ligand binding data, glutamate responses recorded from outside-out patches indicated that cyclothiazide removed desensitization of glutamate currents of GluR-D and Δ402 channels in a similar manner (Fig. 5 B). These findings clearly show that the Δ402 construct contains a functional cyclothiazide binding site, thus demonstrating that the X domain is not a critical participant in the allosteric transitions involved in homomeric GluR-D receptor desensitization or its regulation by cyclothiazide. Based on biochemical, cell biological, and electrophysiological analyses of native and recombinant iGluR, a number of different activities or potential physiological roles for the N-terminal X domain have been suggested. Our present analysis on the properties of GluR-DΔ22–402 receptors clearly exclude an essential role of the X domain in the assembly of homomeric channels, transport to cell surface, channel gating, rapid desensitization, and allosteric potentiation by cyclothiazide in AMPA receptors. It must be noted, however, that our study focuses on one AMPA receptor subunit, and the specific functions of the X domain are likely to vary among receptor subclasses, and possibly even among subunits. In the following, we discuss the possible functions of the N-terminal domain of GluR-D AMPA receptor in the light of the present results. Interestingly, the N-terminal domain is not present in the small kainate-binding proteins expressed in avian and amphibian species, which are otherwise homologous to iGluR subunits. These proteins do not seem to have a capacity to form active ligand-gated channels, even though their M1–M3 segment is able to mediate an ion conductance when artificially inserted into AMPA or kainate receptor subunits (22Villmann C. Bull L. Hollmann M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7634-7643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that the N-terminal domain might be essential for channel activity, possibly by participating in the conformational coupling between the ligand-binding domain and the channel domain. The identification of a prokaryotic glutamate-sensitive potassium channel (“GluR0”), which is distantly related to the core of iGluR subunits and has no X domain, demonstrates that a direct coupling between the ligand-binding S1-S2 domain and the ion channel gate can take place without an obligatory involvement of an N-terminal domain (23Chen G.Q. Cui C. Mayer M.L. Gouaux E. Nature. 1999; 402: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The overall sequence similarity between the prokaryotic channel and eukaryotic iGluR is fairly low, however, and even the ligand binding mechanism employed by GluR0 seems to profoundly differ that observed for the AMPA receptor (24Mayer M.L. Olson R. Gouaux E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is entirely possible that the mechanism of ligand-triggered activation of the GluR0 channels is also fundamentally different. However, our present results convincingly demonstrate that in a eukaryotic AMPA receptor, the neurotransmitter-binding domain can directly couple to and regulate the ion channel without an involvement of the N-terminal domain. Several studies have implicated the N-terminal domain of NMDA receptor subunits as a determinant or direct participant in some forms of desensitization. Glycine-independent desensitization of NMDA receptors was assigned to two regions in the NR2A subunit, the X domain and an area within the S1 segment (13Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Heinemann S.F.

Moreover, participation of the N-terminal domain in the regulation of NMDA receptor channel function by allosteric modulators, including Zn2+ ions (14Fayyazuddin A. Villarroel A. Le Goff A. Lerma J.

Neuron. 1994; 12: 1031-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), has been demonstrated. In some cases, this modulation has been shown to involve an direct allosteric interaction between the N-terminal domain and the agonist-binding domain (16Zheng F. Erreger K. Low C.M. Banke T. Lee C.J. Conn P.J. Traynelis S.F. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 894-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). So far, no studies have indicated any direct engagement of the X domain with allosteric modulation or desensitization of AMPA receptors. Indeed, mutagenesis experiments on AMPA receptors have localized structural determinants responsible for the rapid desensitization and its modulation by allosteric ligands exclusively in the S1 and S2 segments (27Partin K.M. Fleck M.W. Mayer M.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6634-6647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Stern-Bach Y. Russo S. Neuman M. Rosenmund C.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3052-3062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our present results do not exclude the possibility that the X domain can participate in the fine-tuning of channel responses, as shown by the minor difference in desensitization rates observed between the Δ402 and full-length GluR-D constructs. However, the presence of rapid desensitization in the Δ402 channels together with removal of desensitization by cyclothiazide of show that the N-terminal domain is not an obligatory participant in these processes. This is also consistent with a recent model for AMPA receptor desensitization, inspired and supported by high resolution structures of S1S2-ligand complexes, proposing that destabilization of a dimer interface between agonist-binding domains of neighboring subunits may underlie desensitization (23Chen G.Q. Cui C. Mayer M.L. Gouaux E. Nature. 1999; 402: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 30Armstrong N. Gouaux E.

Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested a role for the X domain in the assembly of multimeric channels (10Leuschner W.D. Hoch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16907-16916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 12Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y.

Neuron. 2001; 32: 841-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Furthermore, experiments performed with separately expressed extracellular domains of GluR-D subunit indicate that the X domain is able to form dimers, consistent with a role in the assembly (11Kuusinen A. Abele R. Madden D.R. Keinänen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28937-28943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A recent study suggests that the X domain participates in early dimerization of subunits, whereas the transmembrane part and the S2 segment are important in the formation of the functional tetramer assembly (12Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Our current findings show that functional homomoric AMPA receptors can assemble from subunits lacking the entire X domain. Furthermore, our data actually suggest that homomeric Δ402 receptors assemble at least as efficiently as wild-type GluR-D and thus argue against an assembly-promoting role for the X domain. In insect cells, the expression level of Δ402 was consistently higher as measured by the number of high affinity AMPA binding sites. In HEK 293 cells, transfected in parallel for expression of either Δ402 or full-length GluR-D channels, the currents recorded from outside-out patches were at the same level, even though immunoblots indicated that, in these cells, Δ402 polypeptide is expressed at a lower level than the full-length GluR-D subunit. It should be noted, however, that most native AMPA receptors are heteromeric assemblies, and while the assembly of homomeric GluR-D channels seems to occur apparently normally in the absence of the X domain, the assembly of heteromeric subunit combinations may well require participation of the N-terminal region. Interestingly, a recent elegant study provided evidence that the assembly of homomeric AMPA receptors is a stochastic process, whereas heteromeric channels assemble with a preferred subunit stoichiometry (33Mansour M. Nagarajan N. Nehring R.B. Clements J.D. Rosenmund C. Neuron. 2001; 32: 841-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Considering the highly conserved ligand-binding domain and transmembrane segments of AMPA receptor subunits, it will be of considerable interest to test whether the more variable N-terminal domain (see below) would be able to guide the preferential formation of subunit pairs in the heteromeric assembly process. The N-terminal domain is similar to bacterial amino acid-binding proteins and the N-terminal domain of mGluR and GABAB receptor subunits, which contain the neurotransmitter binding site (34Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 35Galvez T. Prezeau L.

Still, previous studies on chimeric receptors (5Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1345-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and soluble extracellular domains of AMPA receptor subunits (6Kuusinen A. Arvola M. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 7Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar,36Arvola M. Keinänen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15527-15532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) clearly exclude a direct participation of the N-terminal domain in agonist binding. Our previous analysis of soluble extracellular GluR-D constructs showed no differences in agonist binding affinities or kinetics between XS1S2 and S1S2 ligand-binding domains. In the intact receptor, however, structural constraints posed by domain and subunit interactions could be quite different, but the present results exclude any significant “allosteric” modulation of the ligand-binding domain by the X domain also in the full-length membrane-bound receptor. Only a few extracellular synaptic interactions of iGluRs have been described, perhaps due to the inapplicability of standard yeast two-hybrid technology to extracellular proteins. The recently described interaction between the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor and EphB receptor tyrosine kinase (37Dalva M.B. Takasu M.A. Lin M.Z. Shamah S.M. Hu L. Gale N.W. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 2000; 103: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), and the association of AMPA receptor subunits with Narp, a synaptic protein of the pentraxin family (18O'Brien R.J. Xu D. Petralia R.S. Steward O. Huganir R.L. Worley P. Neuron. 1999; 23: 309-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), have been reported to take place extracellularly, although the exact interaction sites have not been mapped within the iGluR ectodomains. Moreover, functional interactions of AMPA receptors with heparan sulfate containing proteoglycans present in the extracellular matrix have been suggested (38Sinnarajah S. Suppiramaniam V. Kumar K.P. Hall R.A. Bahr B.A. Vodyanoy V. Synapse. 1999; 31: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As a large protein domain, which is likely to protrude further away from the membrane than the ligand-binding domain, the X domain would be in an ideal position to participate in the aforementioned and other protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, the lower level of sequence similarity between the subunits within any iGluR subclass in the X domain (∼55–60% sequence identity for AMPA receptor subunits) than in the S1S2 domains (> 90%) could provide room for subunit-specific functions of the X domain. The present results do not address this issue, but by excluding an essential role in the core functions of the ligand-gated channel, our results highlight the possibility of specific protein interactions as one of the functions of the X domain. We conclude that the N-terminal X domain does not play a critical role in the formation of active glutamate-gated channels in homomeric GluR-D AMPA receptors. Furthermore, the ligand binding, allosteric transitions involved in the rapid activation and desensitization of AMPA receptor channel responses, as well as its regulation by cyclothiazide, can take place in the complete absence of the X domain."

In the United States and Western world as well as Asian countries, LC is the major leading cause of death by disease. Yet, no effective therapeutic agent is available for LC treatment. Laboratory cirrhotic rats produced by dimethylnitrosamine administrations simulate the clinical features of human LC such as mortality, ascites, hepatic parenchymal cell destruction, and formation of connective tissue and nodular regeneration, providing a preclinical model to evaluate therapeutic efficacy of drugs and the underlying mechanisms. Oltipraz [5-(2-pyrazinyl)-4-methyl-1,2-dithiol-3-thione] has been used clinically and is of little toxicity. Comprehensive mechanistic and phase IIa clinical studies supported the notion that oltipraz exerts chemopreventive effects against chemical carcinogenesis. We report here that oltipraz within the clinical dose range regenerates cirrhotic liver in the established LC rats as a result of reduction of the intensities of cirrhotic nodules, elimination of accumulated extracellular matrix, and inactivation of stellate cells, thereby improving survival rate. We also reveal that activation of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein by oltipraz inhibits transforming growth factor b1 gene expression in stellate cells, which provides a molecular target for pharmacological treatment of LC. Oltipraz is the first therapeutic agent that regenerates cirrhotic liver."

Senescence is dominant over the phenotype of indefinite division exhibited by tumor cell lines (1Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Science. 1983; 221: 964-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify senescence-related genes, MORF4,1 (MORtality Factor on chromosome 4) was cloned as a gene capable of inducing a senescent phenotype in a subset of immortal human cell lines (2Bertram M.J. Berube N.G. Hang-Swanson X. Ran Q. Leung J.K. Bryce S. Spurgers K. Bick R.J. Baldini Y. Ning L.J. Clark E.K. Parkinson E.K. Barrett J.C. Smith J.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Mol. Cell.

MORF4 is a member of a family of genes, and two of these, MRG15 and MRGX (MORF4-related genes on chromosomes 15 and X, respectively), which have a high degree of homology to MORF4, are expressed in human cells. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of the three predicted proteins has indicated the existence of helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper domains, features typical of those found in transcriptional regulators, as well as regions thought to be involved in protein-protein interaction. MRG15 has a 96% similarity to MORF4 in amino acid sequence but fails to induce senescence upon introduction into immortal cells. The most striking structural difference between the two proteins is the presence of an N-terminal extension in MRG15 that includes a chromodomain. This region and/or nine single amino acid changes could therefore be responsible for the differential behavior of the two proteins. The fact that MORF4 is a truncated protein raises the hypothesis that it could have a dominant negative effect when transfected into cells, resulting in loss of cell proliferation. Proteins containing a chromodomain characterized to date have been found to be chromatin remodeling factors involved in causing conformational changes in chromatin by ATP-dependent movement of nucleosomes and modification of histones (3Jones D.O.

Nature. 2000; 407: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Human MRG15 has overall similarity with the Drosophila msl-3 (male-specific lethal 3) protein, and several recent reports have shown that they are evolutionarily related (8Marin I. Baker B.S. Mol.

In Drosophila, msl-3 is required for dosage compensation by the transcriptional enhancement of genes on the male X chromosome (11Gorman M. Kuroda M.I. Baker B.S.

Although human orthologues of most of the members of the proteins involved in sex dosage compensation in flies exist (8Marin I. Baker B.S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 1240-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the processes they are involved in have not yet been elucidated. We have previously reported that MRG15 interacts with Rb and is involved in the activation of the B-myb promoter under E2F control (13Leung J.K. Berube N. Venable S. Ahmed S. Timchenko N. Pereira-Smith O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39171-39178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The action of Rb as a transcriptional repressor of E2F-responsive genes involved in G1/S transition explains in part its function as a tumor suppressor (14Hatakeyama M. Weinberg R.A. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1995; 1: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The G1/S Rb-dependent arrest is overcome during the normal cell cycle by phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin-dependent kinases, which results in destabilization of the Rb/E2F complexes. In this report we demonstrate that MRG15 associates with other nuclear proteins in at least two distinct complexes, MAF1 and MAF2 (MRG15-associated factors 1 and 2, respectively). MRG15 interacts with Rb in the MAF1 complex. PAM14, a novel protein isolated by us from a yeast two-hybrid screen using MRG15 and MRGX as bait, is another member of this complex. The MRG15 leucine zipper is necessary for the interaction with Rb as well as for activation of the B-myb promoter (13Leung J.K. Berube N. Venable S. Ahmed S. Timchenko N. Pereira-Smith O.M. J. Biol.

In addition we have found that the hMOF protein, a MYST histone acetylase (15Neal K.C. Pannuti A. Smith E.R. Lucchesi J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), is a MRG15 partner in MAF2. hMOF is homologous to theDrosophila MOF protein, which is also involved in the enhancement of transcription of genes on the X male chromosome by acetylation of histone H4 (16Hilfiker A. Hilfiker-Kleiner D. Pannuti A. Lucchesi J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2054-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 17Smith E.R. Pannuti A., Gu, W. Steurnagel A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Lucchesi J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Cells expressing an MRG15 mutant lacking the chromodomain failed to appropriately assemble the MAF2 complex. We detected a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity associated with wild type MRG15; however, a mutant construct minus the chromodomain did not have this activity. Additionally, the chromodomain-minus mutant failed to activate the B-myb promoter, suggesting that this complex is also involved in transcriptional regulation, in this case most likely through chromatin remodeling and histone acetylation. Thus both MAF1 1 and -2 can affect expression of the B-myb promoter and, thereby, cell cycle progression. The MRG15 cDNA was introduced into the BamH1/XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1 to generate pcDNA3.1 MRG15. The MRG15 open reading frame was then amplified from this construct using primers that resulted in the incorporation ofHindIII and BamH1 sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Primers were MRG15Hind, 5′-CCGAAGCTTCCACCATGGCGCCGAAGCAGGAC-3′, and MRG15Bam, 5′-GAGTGAGAGGTGCCGGATCCACAGTTTCCGATG-3′. After amplification, the amplicons were digested withHindIII and BamH1 and cloned directionally into the EGFP-N1 vector (Clontech), cut with the same enzymes. The MRG15 EGFP-N1 chromodomain-minus construct was obtained by amplifying the MRG15 EGFP-N1 construct with primers that amplified all but the chromodomain region (amino acids 26–62) and introduced aPstI site upon religation. Primers were MRG15chr-F, 5′-GCCCTGCAGCTCAAATACGTGGACACC-3′, and MRG15chr-R, 5′-GCCCTGCAGAAGAAGAGGCCCATGAAGC-3′. The MRG15 EGFP-N1 leucine zipper-minus was cloned by a similar strategy to the chromodomain-minus mutant. Primers used to generate the MRG15 luminous-EGFP-N1 construct were MRG15leu-F, 5′-GCCCTGCAGGCCAGCGATTATGAAGTG-3′, and MRG15leu-R, 5′-GCC- CTGCAGCTCATCCAGAGGTGTATA-3′. The MRG15-HA construct was obtained using the primers MRGHA-F, 5′-TATGGATCCTCCACCATGGCGCCGAAGCAGGACCCG-3′, and MRGHA-R, 5′-CTCATGGTAGCCTTTCGACACACAATGGGTATGCTGCAGGGYSYGCAGGGTCTGATGCGATCGGACATCAGA- TCTACT-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the BamH1 andXbaI sites of pcDNA3.1 Constructs were verified by sequencing and restriction enzyme analysis. The immortal cell lines EJ (bladder carcinoma-derived cells) and CMV-MJ-Hel1 (CMV-transformed human fibroblasts) were maintained in minimum essential medium with Hanks' salts supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable clones expressing PAM14-HA were obtained from EJ and CMV-MJ-Hel1 parental cell lines as previously described (13Leung J.K. Berube N. Venable S. Ahmed S. Timchenko N. Pereira-Smith O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39171-39178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cells stably expressing MRG15-HA were obtained by transfecting EJ cells with pcDNA3.1 MRG15-HA. 24 h post-transfection, 3,000–10,000 cells were plated into 60-mm dishes in minimum essential medium with Earl's salts supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and G418 (1 mg/ml). After a two-week incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, several clones were isolated and maintained in medium containing G418. MRG15-HA expression was verified by immunoblot analysis. Rabbit anti-MRG15 polyclonal antibody was raised against a peptide (amino acids 54–64) in the chromodomain region (Cocalico Biologicals Inc.). Polyclonal anti-hMOF was obtained as previously described (15Neal K.C. Pannuti A. Smith E.R. Lucchesi J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit anti-HA and rabbit anti-Rb were purchased from Santa Cruz. Mouse monoclonal anti-Rb and anti-E2F1 were from Neomarkers. Mouse monoclonal anti-HA CA125 and mouse anti-GFP were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared essentially as described by Timchenko et al. (18Timchenko N.A. Wilde M. Nakanishi M. Smith J.R. Darlington G.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 804-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol), passed through a 29 gauge needle 5 times on ice, and centrifuged at 1800 × g for 10 min. Supernatants (cytoplasmic fraction) were frozen at −70 °C or used immediately. Pellets were washed in buffer A and resuspended in buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25% sucrose), incubated for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged at 1800 × g for 10 min. For sucrose gradient analysis, buffer B was made with 10% sucrose. The supernatants were used immediately or frozen at −70 °C. All buffers were supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), and the proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (2 μm). 300–700 μg of protein from nuclear extracts was loaded on 5–20% linear sucrose gradients made in buffer Tris-HCl (25 mm). Samples were diluted with 1.5 volumes of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, before being loaded. Centrifugation was performed in a Beckmann SW50 at 36,000 rpm for 14 h. Fractions of 150-μl-200-μl were collected from bottom to top, and aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Cytochrome c(1.7 S), peroxidase (3.5 S), alkaline phosphatase (6.3 S), and catalase (11.2 S) were used as sedimentation coefficient standards. Cytochromec was detected by colorimetry, and the enzymatic activity of peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase,and catalase was determined in the fractions. Protein A/G BioMag beads (PolySciences) were preincubated with the corresponding antibodies for 30 min on ice. Nuclear extracts were diluted 1:3 in 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5. 200 μg of protein from nuclear extracts was incubated with 40 μl of beads for 1 h at 4 °C with constant rotation, These control beads were separated from the lysate, which was subsequently incubated with the antibody-bound beads for 3 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. Antibody-bound beads were separated from the remaining soluble proteins with a magnetic holder and washed twice in buffer B diluted 1: 3 with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. For the immunoprecipitations of the sucrose gradient fractions, nuclear extract obtained from EJ-MRG15-HA cells harvested from 32T-150 tissue culture flasks was loaded onto five 5–20% sucrose gradients, which were run simultaneously as described above. 175-μl fractions were collected from top to bottom. On a sixth gradient, peroxidase and catalase were loaded as sedimentation standards and fractionated. 24 fractions were obtained from each gradient. Fractions 5–10, corresponding to the position of peroxidase, and fractions 17–21, corresponding to the position of fractions just below catalase, from the five gradients were pooled. Protein concentration was raised to 0.5 mg/ml by addition of bovine serum albumin. Immunoprecipitation of the pooled fractions was performed with A/G beads preincubated with 50 μg of mouse anti-HA antibody after a preincubation with the same amount of beads in the absence of antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed, denatured, and loaded on a 7.5% gel. Western blots were performed with rabbit polyclonal anti-HA, anti-hMOF, and anti-Rb antibodies. 0.2 × 106 cells were plated on glass coverslips in 35-mm tissue culture dishes in minimum essential medium with Earl's salts plus fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 incubator. Transfections with the appropriate constructs were done as described above. Cells were fixed with formaldehyde (2%) and permeabilized with Triton-X100 (0.2%) for 10 min. Coverslips were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and blocked with 2% goat serum in PBS for 30 min. After incubation with the appropriate primary antibodies, immunostaining was performed using Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1: 500) from Molecular Probes. Staining with 1 mg/ml DAPI (4, 6-diamino-2-phenylindole) was done for 10 min. Coverslips were mounted on microscope slides with Prolong Antifade from Molecular Probes. Microscopy was performed using an Applied Precision Delta Vision microscope (Issaquah, WA) fitted with an Olympus I×70 microscope. Images were acquired via wide field sectioning using fluorescent light. The stacked images, usually 20–25 sections, were subjected to point spread function analysis for better image quality on Silicon Graphics software (SGI, Mountain View, CA). Magnification of all cells was maintained at ×600. PAM14-HA was seen as red, MRG15-GFP as green, 4_,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclear staining as blue. EJ cells transfected with either control pCDNA3.1 MRG-15-HA, or Tip60-HA constructs were assayed for histone acetyltransferase activity using the HAT Check kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were incubated with the first 23 amino acids of histone H4 conjugated to biotin and [14C]acetyl-CoA for one h at 30 °C. The mixture was added to streptavidin beads and rocked for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were subsequently washed four times with RIPA buffer, resuspended into 500 μl of HAT buffer, and 14C activity was measured with a scintillation counter. These utilized the B-myb promoter reporter constructs and the same experimental approach detailed previously (13Leung J.K. Berube N. Venable S. Ahmed S. Timchenko N. Pereira-Smith O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39171-39178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, expression plasmids were transfected into EJ cells, which were harvested 24 h later with reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a Monolight 2010 luminometer. The data were normalized to the amount of protein in the samples as determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Luciferase assays were performed in triplicate to verify reproducibility, and protein assays were performed in duplicate. From our previous work we had evidence of the presence of MRG15, PAM14-HA, and Rb in independent immunoprecipitates obtained using antibodies against either HA or Rb. This suggested they were present together in the same multiprotein complex (13Leung J.K. Berube N. Venable S. Ahmed S. Timchenko N. Pereira-Smith O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39171-39178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Using a cell line stably expressing PAM14 tagged with HA, we immunodepleted the tagged protein in nuclear extracts with an anti-HA antibody and determined that about 30% of MRG15 was still present in the supernatant (data not shown). Because this indicated that MRG15 could be associated with other proteins in more than one complex, we fractionated nuclear extracts from EJ cells stably expressing either MRG15-HA or PAM14-HA and CMV-MJ-Hel 1 cells stably expressing PAM14-HA by ultracentrifugation on 5–20% linear sucrose gradients. The presence of MRG15, PAM14, and Rb proteins was determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. In the stable clone expressing MRG15-HA, the anti-HA antibody demonstrated the existence of at least two different complexes containing MRG15: a more abundant component with a sedimentation coefficient of 3.5 S, MAF1, and a minor component with a sedimentation coefficient of 14 S, MAF2 (Fig. 1 a). In all the clones the same distribution of MRG15 was also detected by the anti-HA antibody, and PAM 14 and Rb were found only in the fractions that corresponded to MAF1 (Fig. 1, b and c). The peaks of Rb and MRG15 were not found in the same fraction in EJ-PAM14-HA cells (Fig. 1 b), which could be because of clonal variation. Alternatively, there may be more than one Rb/MRG15 complex in this clone. To eliminate the possibility that these two complexes were the result of the disassembly of a unique multiprotein complex during the preparation of the extract, we investigated the in vivodistribution of MAF1 and -2 by immunostaining and confocal microscopy. CMV-MJ-Hel 1 cells stably expressing PAM14-HA were transfected with a construct encoding MRG15-GFP. GFP was visualized directly and PAM14-HA by immunostaining with an anti-HA primary antibody and a secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Texas Red fluorescent dye. The images obtained by confocal microscopy demonstrated that MRG15 was present throughout the nucleus (Fig. 2 a), whereas PAM14 was more abundant in the perinuclear region (Fig. 2 b) where it co-localized with MRG15 (Fig. 2 c). The fact that there was no co-localization of MRG15 and PAM14 in the inner part of the nucleus supports the results from the fractionation studies indicating that MRG15 is present in at least two nuclear complexes. We have previously established that the MRG15 interaction with Rb in a nucleoprotein complex mediates the activation of the E2F-responsive promoter, B-myb (13Leung J.K. Berube N. Venable S. Ahmed S. Timchenko N. Pereira-Smith O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39171-39178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), most likely through derepression by the disruption of E2F-Rb complexes. The most common mechanism responsible for this effect is the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin-dependent kinases, which hyperphosphorylate Rb to the inactive form that loses affinity for E2F (14Hatakeyama M. Weinberg R.A. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1995; 1: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of Rb cosediment with MRG15 at the position of MAF1. To determine whether MRG15 associated preferentially with one of these forms of Rb, nuclear extracts of EJ MRG15-HA cells immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody were analyzed with an antibody that recognizes Rb in both states. Both forms of Rb were present in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3, lane 3), and some of the phosphorylated molecules were present in the non-precipitated proteins (Fig. 3, lane 1). The human MRG15 protein has an overall homology with the msl-3 protein from Drosophila(8Marin I. Baker B.S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 1240-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that is involved in dosage compensation by transcriptional enhancement of the genes present on the X male chromosome (12Gorman M. Franke A. Baker B.S. Development. 1995; 121: 463-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism requires the recruitment of the multiprotein MSL complex and two associated small RNA molecules, rho1 and rho2, to the X chromosome (9Pannuti A. Lucchesi J.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The MSL complex has multiple activities involved in chromatin remodeling, including histone acetylation via a histone acetyltransferase, MOF. A homologue to the Drosophila protein was recently found in humans, hMOF, a chromodomain protein belonging to the MYST family of acetyl transferases (15Neal K.C. Pannuti A. Smith E.R. Lucchesi J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). MRG15 and another human protein, the product of the msl-3L1 gene (19Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang R., J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar), have been proposed as proteins potentially able to interact with hMOF (15Neal K.C. Pannuti A. Smith E.R. Lucchesi J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We therefore used an anti-hMOF antibody in Western analysis of EJ-MRG15-HA nuclear extracts immunoprecipitated with either anti-HA or anti-Rb antibodies. The fractions obtained from sucrose gradient sedimentation were also analyzed. hMOF was detected only in the anti-HA immunoprecipitates and the sucrose gradient fractions corresponding to MAF2 but not MAF1 (Fig. 4, a and b) and was absent in the Rb immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4 a). To demonstrate that the proteins identified by Western analysis in the sucrose gradient fractions (Figs. 1 and 4) were indeed together in the proposed complexes (MAF1 and MAF2), we initially attempted immunoprecipitations of the individual fractions involving MAF1 and MAF2. Western analysis produced no results, most likely because of the low amount of protein present. We then decided to pool the fractions related to MAF1 and MAF2 from five gradients produced simultaneously prior to immunoprecipitation. We were successful in identifying the presence of MRG15 with Rb in MAF1 and hMOF in MAF2 (Fig. 5). We did not identify the presence of PAM14 because it was necessary to run a 7.5% gel to visualize MRG15, Rb, and hMOF, a percentage gel in which PAM14 is lost during electrophoresis. However, the data demonstrate that MRG15 associates with Rb in MAF1 and hMOF in MAF2. Leucine zipper and chromodomain regions are generally thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions. We have previously determined that the MRG15 leucine zipper was required for appropriate interaction with PAM14 and Rb (13Leung J.K. Berube N. Venable S. Ahmed S. Timchenko N. Pereira-Smith O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39171-39178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of both regions in the constitution of the MAF multiprotein complexes, we analyzed the sedimentation behavior of the protein members of the MAFs when EJ cells stably expressing PAM14-HA were transfected with plasmids containing either wild type MRG15-GFP or deletion mutants lacking either the leucine zipper or chromodomain regions. The absence of the leucine zipper caused disassembly of MAF1 by disrupting the association with Rb (Fig. 6) and the displacement of MRG15 to a lower position in the gradient. We did not detect PAM14 in any of the fractions, possibly because of the instability of this protein when it loses association with MRG15. The deletion of the leucine zipper resulted in no significant change in the MAF2 complex, whereas the absence of the chromodomain resulted in complete loss of the MAF2 complex. This indicates that the leucine zipper is necessary for the assembly of proteins in MAF1 and that the chromodomain is required for the assembly of MAF2. Because we had detected hMOF in immunoprecipitates as well as sucrose gradient fractions of MRG15, we performed a HAT activity analysis. Nuclear extracts from cells transfected with either empty vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), pcDNA3.1 MRG15-HA tagged at the C terminus, or a plasmid expressing a HA-tagged TIP60 protein (a known co-activator protein that has HAT activity) (19Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang R., J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar) were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and analyzed for HAT activity. The results, expressed as the percentage of the total HAT activity, indicate that in the case of MRG15-HA there was 2.2-fold increased HAT activity compared with empty vector, similar to the 2.7-fold activity observed with TIP60-HA (Fig. 7 a). Interestingly, immunoprecipitates of cells transfected with GFP N-terminal-tagged MRG15 protein did not associate with HAT activity (data not shown), suggesting that the N-terminal region of MRG15 is required for this association. We had previously demonstrated that MRG15 could activate the B-myb promoter and that the leucine zipper region was required for this derepression, most likely through interaction with Rb. We tested the chromodomain minus mutant in this assay to determine whether HAT activity was involved in affecting the activity of this promoter and indeed observed that the activation was abolished (Fig. 7 b). Collectively, these observations suggest that the B-myb promoter activity is dependent on both the interaction of MRG15 with Rb and the resulting inhibition of Rb-mediated transcriptional repression, as well as a HAT-associated activity acting most likely via histone acetylation. The MRG15 gene had been identified (2Bertram M.J. Berube N.G. Hang-Swanson X. Ran Q. Leung J.K. Bryce S. Spurgers K. Bick R.J. Baldini Y. Ning L.J. Clark E.K. Parkinson E.K. Barrett J.C. Smith J.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1475-1485Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar) as a member of a family of genes related to MORF4, a gene that induces replicative senescence in a subset of immortal cell lines. The MRG15 protein is very similar to the MORF4 protein except for the presence of an N-terminal extension that harbors a chromodomain and nine changes in amino acids, most of which are conserved. This strong homology suggests that MORF4 could have a dominant negative effect on MRG15 action when transfected into cells. Proteins containing a chromodomain are usually involved in chromatin remodeling that leads to transcriptional activation or repression of a large number of genes. This implicates MRG15 as a good target for involvement in the permanent growth arrest elicited by MORF4. Our previous findings have demonstrated that MRG15 is able to derepress transcription of the luciferase gene under the control of the B-myb promoter and that it associates with Rb and PAM14, a novel protein (13Leung J.K. Berube N. Venable S. Ahmed S. Timchenko N. Pereira-Smith O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39171-39178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this report we have established that MRG15 is present in two distinct nuclear protein complexes, MAF1 and MAF2, in association with proteins known to be involved in the transcriptional activation of genes. MRG15 has a leucine zipper and a chromodomain, motifs known to facilitate interaction with other proteins. The analysis by sucrose gradients of nuclear extracts from cells expressing deleted versions of the MRG15 protein, lacking one or the other of these domains, has shown that the leucine zipper is required for the appropriate assembly of proteins at MAF1 without a significant change in MAF2 constitution. In MAF1, MRG15 associates with Rb, whereas E2F1 is not part of the complex, suggesting a derepressive nature of this association. Thus MRG15 stimulation of the B-myb promoter most likely involves the disruption of Rb-E2F complexes. PAM14 is a novel coil-coil protein discovered in our laboratory by its ability to interact with MRG15 in the yeast two-hybrid system. Its interaction with MRG15 has been previously demonstrated by GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation (13Leung J.K. Berube N. Venable S. Ahmed S. Timchenko N. Pereira-Smith O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39171-39178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this report we have established that it is part of MAF1. In MAF2 we have found the association of MRG15 with the human hMOF, the Drosophila homologue of which has been shown to have histone acetyl transferase activity (17Smith E.R. Pannuti A., Gu, W. Steurnagel A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Lucchesi J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In addition, immunoprecipitates of MRG15 have an associated HAT activity. Expression of a chromodomain-minus mutant MRG15 protein resulted in loss of the MAF2 complex and HAT-associated activity. This mutant protein was also unable to positively affect the activity of the B-myb promoter. These results suggest that both MAF1 and MAF2 are needed for B-myb promoter activity, the former involving interaction with Rb through the leucine zipper domain of MRG15 and the latter possibly through relaxation of chromatin around the promoter via histone acetylation. Proteins containing a chromodomain, such as the Drosophila msl-3 protein, are components of multimeric complexes that modify chromatin structure via histone acetylation at target sites specified by the complex (3Jones D.O. Cowell I.G. Singh P.B. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 124-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 17Smith E.R. Pannuti A., Gu, W. Steurnagel A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Lucchesi J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Specifically, these msl proteins paint the Drosophila X chromosome in association with the rox RNAs (transcripts specific to the X chromosome) and the histone acetyltransferase MOF to cause hypertranscription in dosage compensation (17Smith E.R. Pannuti A., Gu, W. Steurnagel A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Lucchesi J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of the chromodomain in MRG15 suggests that it possesses the distinct potential to act in transcriptional regulation, perhaps through an interaction with specific RNAs or histone acetyltransferases. TheSaccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of MRG15, Eaf3p, is a component of the yeast NuA4 HAT complex that contains Esa1p, theS. cerevisiae homologue of MOF and Tip60 (20Eisen A. Utley R.T. Nourani A. Allard S. Schmidt P. Lane W.S. Lucchesi J.C. Cote J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3484-3491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Esa1p and the NuA4 complex are essential for cell division and viability in budding yeast (20Eisen A. Utley R.T. Nourani A. Allard S. Schmidt P. Lane W.S. Lucchesi J.C. Cote J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3484-3491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, the MRG15 protein may be a component of a HAT complex homologous to the yeast NuA4 complex. The role of PAM14 is not clear at this time, but by comparison with other nucleoprotein complexes that have been described, it could be acting as an adaptor protein, facilitating interaction between proteins in the MAF1 complex. The ability of MRG15 to increase B-myb promoter activity has implications for a potential role for MRG15 in cell cycle progression. The B-myb protein is an established transcriptional activator that promotes cell cycle progression through stimulation of multiple effectors of cell growth, including cyclin D1 and cdc2 (22Sala A. Watson R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Sala A. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10415-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of the B-myb gene has been demonstrated to promote bypass of p53-induced G1 arrest (23Sala A. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10415-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), suggesting that B-myb also induces cell growth through inhibition of growth inhibitory molecules. B-myb expression correlates with cell cycle progression in that it is repressed during G0 and early G1 phases but stimulated in late G1 and S phases (21Lin D. Fiscella M. O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Chen M. Luo L.L. Sala A. Travali S. Appella E. Mercer W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10079-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Significantly, this mRNA expression pattern is similar to that of MRG15, in that there is a ∼2-fold increase in MRG15 mRNA levels at 4–8 h postserum stimulation of normal quiescent fibroblasts, and these elevated mRNA levels persist up to 28 h poststimulation (9Pannuti A. Lucchesi J.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Young fibroblast cells 4–8 h poststimulation are in the early to mid-G1 phase of the cell cycle and enter S phase at 16 h postexposure to serum, with maximal DNA synthesis at 24 h poststimulation. Thus, like B-myb, MRG15 expression correlates with cell cycle progression and therefore represents a putative growth stimulatory factor. It is tempting to speculate that such potential proliferative functions of MRG15 are because of its ability to antagonize one or more activities of Rb in addition to chromatin remodeling. Western analysis of MRG15 protein levels has indicated that MRG15 protein levels decrease about 2–3-fold with increasing cell population doublings and cell senescence in normal human fibroblasts (data not shown). This further suggests that the function of MRG15 is correlated with cell cycle progression. The fact that the MRG15 transcripts and protein are expressed in a wide variety of tissues and are conserved across a large number of species suggests an essential function for this protein. Future studies aimed at examination of the effect of MRG15 on additional Rb/E2F-repressed promoters and identification of additional cellular factors within the MRG15 protein complexes should provide critical insight into the role of this protein in the cell cycle and other processes.

https://openalex.org/W2071007358,"Epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) are regulated by various intracellular and extracellular factors including divalent cations. We studied the inhibitory effect and mechanism of external Ni2+ on cloned mouse α-β-γ ENaC expressed inXenopus oocytes. Ni2+ reduced amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents of the wild type mouse ENaC in a dose-dependent manner. The Ni2+ block was fast and partially reversible at low concentrations and irreversible at high concentrations. ENaC inhibition by Ni2+ was accompanied by moderate inward rectification at concentrations higher than 0.1 mm. ENaC currents were also blocked by the histidine-reactive reagent diethyl pyrocarbonate. Pretreatment of the oocytes with the reagent reduced Ni2+inhibition of the remaining current. Mutations at αHis282and γHis239 located within the extracellular loops significantly decreased Ni2+ inhibition of ENaC currents. The mutation αH282D or double mutations αH282R/γH239R eliminated Ni2+ block. All mutations at γHis239eliminated Ni2+-induced inward current rectification. Ni2+ block was significantly enhanced by introduction of a histidine at αArg280. Lowering extracellular pH to 5.5 and 4.4 decreased or eliminated Ni2+ block. Although αH282C-β-γ channels were partially inhibited by the sulfhydryl-reactive reagent [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET), α-β-γ H239C channels were insensitive to MTSET. From patch clamp studies, Ni2+ did not affect unitary current but decreased open probability when perfused into the recording pipette. Our results suggest that external Ni2+ reduces ENaC open probability by binding to a site consisting of αHis282 and γHis239 and that these histidine residues may participate in ENaC gating.

Epithelial Na+ channels (ENaCs) 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; mENaC, mouse epithelial Na+channel; I-V, current-voltage relationship; K i, inhibitory constant; DEPC, diethyl pyrocarbonate; MTSET, 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide; WT, wild type; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; ASIC, acid-sensing ion channels; CNG, cyclic nucleotide-gated channel; ECL, extracellular loops mediate Na+ transport across high resistance epithelia and participate in the regulation of extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure. Molecular cloning has revealed that ENaC subunits (α, β, and γ) belong to a super gene family which is now often referred to as ENaC/Deg family and consist of ENaCs, degenerins (DEG and MEC), acid-sensing ion channels (ASIC), and FMRFamide-gated Na+channels (1Garty H.

These channel proteins are composed of subunits that share a common membrane topology with two transmembrane domains, intracellular N and C termini and large extracellular loops (ECL). Members of the ENaC/Deg family are Na+-selective and sensitive to the epithelial Na+ channel blocker amiloride, although differences in factors that activate, or gate, these channels have been reported (1Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Combined application of site-directed mutagenesis and oocyte expression has yielded important findings regarding structure and function relationships of ENaC (6Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. J. Physiol.

Variability in the ionic selectivity, conductance, and gating of ENaCs in both native tissues and expression systems has been observed (1Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). In part, the functional diversity of the Na+ channels may reflect the influence of intracellular and extracellular factors that regulate channel activity. Divalent cations are important regulators of many ion channels, especially voltage-gated and ligand-gated channels (28Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). Several cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, and Ba2+) were reported to block Na+ currents from the external side with low affinity and complex features in native tissues (29Palmer L.G. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 87: 191-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that external Ni2+stimulated short circuit currents in A6 monolayers (30Van Driessche W. Jans D. Erlij D. FASEB J. 2000; 14 (abstr.): 102Google Scholar) and blocked whole-cell currents in oocytes expressing rat α-β-γ ENaC (31Segal A. Cucu D. Van Driessche W. Weber W.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We report the inhibitory effects of extracellular Ni2+ on the whole-cell and single channel currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing α-β-γ mouse ENaC (mENaC), and the identification of two histidine residues within the extracellular domain as putative Ni2+ binding sites. Preliminary description of this work was presented in abstract form (32Sheng S. Kleyman T.R. Biophys. J. 2002; 82 (abstr.): 211Google Scholar, 33Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. FASEB J. 2002; 16 (abstr.): 478Google Scholar). Point mutations were generated in α, β, or γ mENaC cDNAs (34Ahn Y.J. Brooker D.R. Kosari F. Harte B.J. Li J. Mackler S.A. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F121-F129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cloned into pBluescript SK− vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using two-step PCR methods as described previously (19Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). cRNAs were synthesized with T3 RNA polymerase (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) and dissolved in nuclease-free water (Ambion Inc.). Stage V–VI Xenopusoocytes were treated with collagenase type IV (Sigma) to remove follicle cell layers and injected with 1–4 ng of cRNA for each mENaC subunit per cell in a total volume of 50 μl. Injected oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline. Two-electrode voltage clamp was performed 24–72 h after cRNA injection at room temperature (20–24 °C) as described previously (19Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The bath solution contained 110 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and the pH was adjusted to 7.40 with NaOH. Pipettes filled with 3 mKCl had a resistance of 0.5–2 megohms. Typically, oocytes were clamped from −140 to 60 mV in increments of 20 mV for 500 ms every 2 s. Amiloride at the concentration of 100 μm was added to the bath at the end of each experiment to determine the amiloride-insensitive current that was used to calculate amiloride-sensitive currents. Data acquisition and analyses were performed with pClamp 7.1 for Windows (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Vitelline membranes of oocytes were removed manually following incubation of the oocytes at room temperature in a hypertonic solution containing 200 mm sucrose. Oocytes were then transferred to a recording chamber with bath solution and allowed to recover for 30 min before clamping. The bath solution contained 110 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.40. For Na+ current recordings the pipette solution was identical to the bath solution, and for Li+ current recordings NaCl was replaced by LiCl. Glass pipettes with tip resistances of 5–20 megohms were used. Single channel currents were recorded in cell-attached configuration using PC ONE Patch Clamp amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN), DigiData 1322A interface, and Clampex 8.1 software (Axon). Inhibitors used in two-electrode voltage clamps (NiCl2, MgCl2, amiloride, diethyl pyrocarbonate, and sulfhydryl reagents) were prepared in the bath solution and delivered to the bath by gravity perfusion. To avoid hydrolysis, diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) and sulfhydryl reagents were prepared immediately prior to use. Whole-cell Na+ currents were recorded before and after external application of an inhibitor. The effects of a certain inhibitor on ENaC currents were defined by comparison of the amiloride-sensitive currents before and after perfusion of the inhibitor in the same oocyte. Dose-response relationship for Ni2+ inhibition of mENaC currents was obtained by plotting the relative currents measured at −100 mV and in increasing concentrations of NiCl2 (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 25, and 50 mm) against Ni2+concentrations using a semi-logarithmic scale. The relative currents represent the ratios of whole-cell amiloride-sensitive Na+currents in the presence of Ni2+ in bath solutions relative to the current measured immediately before application of Ni2+. The osmolarity of the bath solution containing NiCl2 was not adjusted. Non-linear least squares curve fitting was used to obtain the dose-response parameters. In most cases dose-response data were fitted with both one-site and two-site equations using software OriginPro 7.0 for Windows (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). The one-site Equation 1 is as follows: IR=Kin/(Cn+Kin)Equation 1 where I R is the relative current in the presence of a specific concentration of inhibitor;K i is the inhibition constant; C is the concentration of an inhibitor, and n represents Hill coefficient. The two-site Equation 2 is as follows:IR=1−{AC/(C+K1)+BC/(C+K2)}Equation 2 where I R and C are as defined for Equation 1; K 1 and K 2 are the K i values for two components in the dose-response curve; A and B are the fractions of each component, and their sum equals the total drop ofI R in the dose-response curve. The goodness of fitting of curves obtained from the one-site or two-site equation was compared by an F test designed to assess changes in both the sum-of-squares and degrees of freedom using Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego). Correlation coefficients (R 2) calculated from curve fittings were also used as a parameter of goodness of fitting. Pipette perfusion of Ni2+ in patch clamps was performed by applying either positive pressure to the perfusion vial or negative pressure to the pipette using 2PK+ Whole-cell/Patch Perfusion Kit (ALA Scientific Instruments Inc., Westbury, NY). Success of pipette perfusion was judged by examining the increase in pipette solution and additional noise in the recordings. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. in most figures. Student's t test was used to assess significance of difference between WT and mutant channels or between mutant channels. Non-linear curve fitting was performed as above with Origin 7.0 Pro. The effect of externally applied Ni2+ on whole-cell amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents was studied inXenopus oocytes expressing α-β-γ mENaC. Ni2+ inhibited amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents in a dose-dependent manner in the concentration range of 0.01–50 mm (Fig.1 A). At 50 mm, Ni2+ inhibited about 80% of the amiloride-sensitive current. The dose-response data were fitted reasonably well with the one-site equation described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig.1 C, dashed line). The estimated inhibitory constant (K i) and Hill coefficient were 0.58 ± 0.09 (n = 6) and 0.37 ± 0.01 mm(n = 6), respectively (TableI). However, the dose-response curve appeared to contain more than one component. Data were fitted with the two-site equation as described under “Experimental Procedures,” assuming that two classes of binding sites with different apparent affinities for Ni2+account for the inhibitory effect of Ni2+ on ENaC currents (Fig. 1 C, solid line). The non-linear least square fitting resulted in a higher correlation coefficient with the two-site equation (0.9958) than that obtained from fitting with the one-site equation (0.9545). According to the F test, the two-site equation was significantly better than the one-site equation to describe the data (p < 0.05). Two K i values were 0.05 ± 0.00 and 11.00 ± 1.60 mm (n = 6).Table IFitting parameters for Ni2+ dose-response curves with the one-site equationChannelnK iHill coefficientR 2mmα-β-γ60.58 ± 0.090.37 ± 0.010.9545 ± 0.0116αH381R-β-γ60.73 ± 0.150.42 ± 0.020.9891 ± 0.0022α-βH319R-γ80.82 ± 0.120.33 ± 0.020.9846 ± 0.0025α-β-γH338R60.97 ± 0.220.39 ± 0.030.9895 ± 0.0022α-βQ220H-γ61.03 ± 0.101-ap < 0.01 from Student's t tests between WT and the mutant channel.0.33 ± 0.010.9529 ± 0.0054Parameters were obtained from the best fitting of the dose-response data by non-linear least square method using Equation 1.

The current reduction by Ni2+ was accompanied by a moderate inward rectification as the concentration of Ni2+ exceeded 0.1 mm (Fig. 1, A andB). The current-voltage relationship curves (I-V) indicate that Ni2+ inhibition of ENaC currents was enhanced when oocyte membranes were depolarized. The Ni2+-induced current rectification is different from that induced by amiloride, which is generally considered as a pore blocker for ENaC and results in outward current rectification (35Palmer L.G. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 80: 153-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Warncke J. Lindemann B. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 86: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The Ni2+ inhibition of mENaC currents was fast with a maximal effect observed around 1 min after initiation of Ni2+ perfusion (Fig. 1 D). Removal of Ni2+ from the bath solution partially restored the Na+ currents when Ni2+ was applied at 1 mm. However, at a high concentration (50 mm) Ni2+ inhibition was not reversed by removal of Ni2+ from the bath for a period of 2 min (Fig.1 E). It was reported that external Ca2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, and Sr2+ blocked Na+ channels in toad urinary bladder with complex voltage dependence. The blocking effects were rather weak with calculated concentrations for half-maximal inhibition of greater than tens of millimolar (29Palmer L.G. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 87: 191-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the relatively high affinity Ni2+ inhibition of α-β-γ mENaC was unique among divalent cations, we examined several other divalent cations for their effects on α-β-γ mENaC. As shown in Fig. 2, external Mg2+ produced a weak inhibition of amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents with an estimated K i of 73.5 ± 10.9 mm (n = 5) and a Hill coefficient of 0.47 ± 0.05 (n = 5). Furthermore, current rectification was not observed in the presence of external Mg2+. The inhibition potency of external Mg2+on mENaC is similar to that observed in toad bladder (29Palmer L.G. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 87: 191-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that external Cd2+ moderately increased amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents at a concentration of 5 mm (24Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Kieber-Emmons T. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1326-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Schild et al. (13Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) reported that inward Li+ currents in oocytes expressing α-β-γ rat ENaC were insensitive to external Zn2+ even in the millimolar range, and a small current reduction (∼20%) was shown with 10 mm Zn2+. We observed no inhibition of amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents with 5 mmZn2+ in the bath solution. However, at low concentrations (0.01–1 mm), Zn2+ produced a moderate potentiation of the Na+ currents, similar in amplitude to the increase in Na+ currents observed with Cd2+. 2S. Sheng, C. J. Perry, and T. R. Kleyman, unpublished data. Therefore, among divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, Sr2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Ni2+), Ni2+ appears to be the most potent external inhibitor of ENaC. Nickel is a transition ion with polarizability between those of hard ions and soft ions. Nitrogen is considered as its most preferred ligand, although sulfur and oxygen can also coordinate Ni2+. Nickel is often coordinated by nitrogen atoms from histidine residues in nickel enzymes (37Jabri E. Carr M.B. Hausinger R.P. Karplus P.A. Science. 1995; 268: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ragsdale S.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 208-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Ermler U. Grabarse W. Shima S. Goubeaud M. Thauer R.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 749-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and it is conceivable that Ni2+binds to histidine residue(s) within ENaC subunits to exert its inhibitory effect on the channel. We therefore examined if the histidine-modifying reagent DEPC had any effect on α-β-γ mENaC expressed in oocytes and whether DEPC-modified channels exhibited an altered response to Ni2+. Perfusion of oocytes with bath solutions containing DEPC at concentrations of 0.1, 1, and 10 mm blocked amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents in a dose-dependent manner. The dose-response relationship was satisfactorily fitted with the one-site equation (R 2 = 0.998) (Fig.3 A). The estimatedK i was 0.45 ± 0.07 mm and the Hill coefficient was 0.99 ± 0.05 (n = 4). The Na+ currents were almost (∼94%) completely blocked by 10 mm DEPC. DEPC block was essentially irreversible. In contrast to Ni2+-induced inward rectification, the amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents in the presence of DEPC were linear in the range of −140 to 60 mV (Fig. 3 B). After perfusion of 1 mm DEPC, the remaining currents were essentially insensitive to Ni2+ (Fig. 3 C). The currents from oocytes pretreated with DEPC and perfused with Ni2+ did not exhibit rectification (Fig. 3 D). These results suggest that histidine residues within ENaC, accessible from extracellular space, participate in Ni2+ inhibition of ENaC. Our results suggest that Ni2+ is not a pore blocker of ENaC as it produced inward current rectification rather than outward rectification, and the inhibition of currents was only partially reversible following removal of Ni2+ from the bath. The experiments with DEPC suggested that histidine residues might be involved in Ni2+ block of ENaC currents. There are numerous histidine residues within the ECLs of each mENaC subunit, 6 in α mENaC, 11 in β mENaC, and 10 in γ mENaC. However, only one histidine is conserved within the ECLs of the three subunits (αHis381, βHis319, and γHis338). These conserved histidine residues were individually mutated to an arginine, and Ni2+ sensitivity of α-β-γ mENaCs containing a mutation within one subunit was examined and compared with wild type (WT) mENaC. Significant changes in Ni2+ sensitivity were not observed with channels containing a mutation of these conserved histidine residues, suggesting that these conserved histidine residues are not essential for Ni2+inhibition of ENaC (Table I). We previously identified an amiloride-binding domain within the ECL of α rat ENaC based on homology with an amiloride-binding site within an anti-amiloride antibody (14Ismailov I.I. Kieber-Emmons T.

Selected mutations within a six-residue tract (residues 278–283, WYRFHY), including αHis282, altered the amiloride sensitivity of channels composed solely of α-subunits reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers, although the amiloride sensitivity of α-β-γ ENaC containing an αHis282 mutation was unchanged (11Kosari F.

We examined whether αHis282 served as one of the Ni2+-binding ligands by generating point mutations at this site in α mENaC. As shown in Fig.4 A, all four mutations (αH282C, αH282R, αH282W, and αH282D) dramatically decreased Ni2+ inhibition as evidenced by the shift in the Ni2+ dose-response curves of the mutant channels to the right with respect to that of WT. The changes in Ni2+inhibition observed with these mutant channels were αH282D > αH282W > αH282R > αH282C. Only the dose-response data for αH282C-β-γ mENaCs were fitted reasonably well with the one-site equation that yielded parameters as follows:K i, 7.46 mm; Hill coefficient, 0.45; andR 2, 0.968. No inhibition of amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents by Ni2+ was observed in oocytes expressing αH282D-β-γ mENaCs. On the contrary, external Ni2+ induced a significant increase in αH282D-β-γ currents at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mm, with peak stimulation at 0.1 mm. At higher Ni2+concentrations, no change in Na+ currents was observed when compared with control currents. The data suggest that αHis282 participates in the binding of Ni2+to ENaC. Interestingly, inward current rectification was observed in the presence of Ni2+ with all four mutant channels despite significantly reduced Ni2+ inhibition of the Na+ currents (Fig. 4, B–E). For αH282D-β-γ mENaC, current rectification was evident in the absence of Ni2+ (Fig. 4 C). The above results encouraged us to examine whether an equivalent histidine residue in γmENaC (γHis239) was also involved in Ni2+ inhibition. The mutations γH239C, γH239R, and γH239D significantly attenuated Ni2+ inhibition (Fig.5). Surprisingly, Na+currents in oocytes expressing the mutant channels did not exhibit rectification in the presence of Ni2+ (Fig. 5,B–D), suggesting that γHis239 is required for Ni2+-induced current rectification. The double mutations (αH282R and γH239R) eliminated Ni2+ inhibition of Na+ currents (Fig.6 A); these channels did not display current rectification (Fig. 6 B). These results provided strong evidence that αHis282 and γHis239 provide Ni2+-binding sites and are primarily responsible for Ni2+ inhibition of ENaC currents. Introduction of a histidine residue at the corresponding site in β mENaC (βQ220H) resulted in a modest increase in Ni2+ K i, suggesting that this residue does not have an important role in Ni2+ inhibition of ENaC (Table I).Figure 6Double mutations (αH282R/γH239R) eliminated Ni2+ inhibition. A, dose response of Ni2+ on amiloride-sensitive Na+currents was examined in oocytes expressing αH282R-β-γH239R mENaCs. Relative currents in the presence of varying concentrations of external Ni2+ are displayed as filled squares(mean ± S.E., n = 5). Dashed line was from fitting the data with the one-site equation. The data could not be fitted with the two-site equation. B, I-V curves in the absence and presence of Ni2+ were generated same way as above, and symbols are identical to those in Fig. 4.

We have identified Giardia lambliahomologues of two members of the MAPK family ERK1 and ERK2. Functional characterization of giardial ERK1 and ERK2 revealed that both kinases were expressed in trophozoites and encysting cells as 44- and 41-kDa polypeptides, respectively, and were catalytically active. Analysis of the kinetic parameters of the recombinant proteins showed that ERK2 is ∼5 times more efficient than ERK1 in phosphorylating myelin basic protein as a substrate, although the phosphorylating efficiency of the native ERK1 and ERK2 appeared to be the same. Immunofluorescence analysis of the subcellular localization of ERK1 and ERK2 in trophozoites showed ERK1 staining mostly in the median body and in the outer edges of the adhesive disc and ERK2 staining in the nuclei and in the caudal flagella. Our study also showed a noticeable change in the subcellular distribution of ERK2 during encystation, which became more punctate and mostly cytoplasmic, but no significant change in the ERK1 localization at any time during encystation. Interestingly, both ERK1 and ERK2 enzymes exhibited a significantly reduced kinase activity during encystation reaching a minimum at 24 h, except for an initial ∼2.5-fold increase in the ERK1 activity at 2 h, which resumed back to the normal levels at 48 h despite no apparent change in the expression level of either one of these kinases in encysting cells. A reduced concentration of the phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 was also evident in these cells at 24 h. Our study suggests a functional distinction between ERK1 and ERK2 and that these kinases may play a critical role in trophozoite differentiation into cysts.

Naumovitz D. Ortega Y. Sterling C.R. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 67-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This flagellated protozoan undergoes complex life cycle stages while inside the host. Exposure to the highly acidic condition in stomach and proteases in the upper small intestine triggers excystation of trophozoites from the ingested cysts. Newly emerged trophozoites swim freely in the intestinal fluid and colonize the upper small intestine to replicate (2Thompson R.C. Reynoldson J.A. Mendis A.H. Adv. Parasitol. 1993; 32: 71-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 3Gillin F.D. Reiner D.S. McCaffery J.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 679-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). As enterocytes migrate to the tip of the villus and get sloughed off into the intestinal lumen, the attached trophozoites either reattach to new enterocytes to remain in the intestine or differentiate into infective cysts. Although the life cycle of this primitive eukaryote and physiological signals that regulate induction of excystation and encystation have been studied extensively, the molecular mechanisms by which trophozoites sense and respond quickly to the environmental signals in the intestine to initiate encystation remain largely unknown. Encystation is an adaptive process to cope with the depletion of nutrients, specifically cholesterol, in the presence of high bile concentration in the lower small intestine (4Kane A.V. Ward H.D. Keusch G.T. Pereira M.E.A. J. Parasitol. 1991; 77: 974-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 5Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Byrd L.G. Nash T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is accomplished in three steps as follows: (i) induction of the encystation-specific gene expression, specifically those that are necessary for the synthesis and processing of cyst wall proteins (CWP)1 (6Lujan H.D.

Cell Biol. 1990; 53: 142-153PubMed Google Scholar); and (iii) assembly of the extracellular cyst wall (12Erlandsen S.L. Macechko P.T. Van Keulen H. Jarroll E. J. Eukaryotic Microbiol. 1996; 43: 416-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 13Hehl A.B. Marti M. Kohler P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1789-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Encysting trophozoites undergo distinct morphological changes such as disappearance of the median bodies and disorganization of the adhesive disc and flagella. The attached trophozoites gradually round up and detach. They lose mobility and become refractile as the cyst wall is assembled. The vacuoles that lie beneath the trophozoite membrane become the periplasmic space separating the parasite from the cyst wall (14Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Unlike differentiating mammalian cells, giardial differentiation into cysts initiates in the cells arrested at G2 (15Bernander R. Palm J.E. Svard S.G. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). During encystation two rounds of DNA replication without an intervening cell division occur, and nuclear division precedes chromosomal duplication (15Bernander R. Palm J.E. Svard S.G. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The dramatic changes in the cytoskeleton reorganization and gene expression during encystation suggest the existence of an orchestrated signaling mechanism. We speculate that the activation or inactivation of microtubule-associated proteins and transcription factors by kinases might play an important role in differentiation of trophozoites into cysts in response to cholesterol starvation. A variety of critical cellular functions in eukaryotic cells are mediated through the MAP kinase pathway in response to extracellular stimuli (reviewed in Ref. 16Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). The mammalian MAP kinases p44 and p42, also known as ERK1 and ERK2, are serine/threonine kinases and are the two best-studied members of the MAP kinase family. Full activation of ERK1 and ERK2 requires dual phosphorylation at the serine and tyrosine residues at the TXY motif by MEK1/2 (17Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1280-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Upon activation, both ERK1 and ERK2 translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate a variety of proteins including transcription factors, such as AP-1 (19Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar), Elk1 (20Tian J. Karin M. J. Biol.

A differential expression and/or activity of various MAP kinase homologues has been observed in parasitic protozoa. The fluctuation of expression or activity of MAP kinases has also been implicated for proliferation, differentiation, or development in protozoan parasites. Studies have shown that the activity of KFR1, a MAP kinase homologue ofTrypanosoma brucei, is higher in the differentiating bloodstream form than the procyclic form (23Hua S.-B. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10797-10803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). LMAPK, a MAPK homologue of Leishmania major, is expressed in promastigotes and amastigotes, but the activity is detected only in amastigotes. Similarly, expression of PfMAP2, a MAPK homologue identified inPlasmodium falciparum, has been detected only in gametocytes of malaria parasites (24Ruben L. Kelly J.M. Chakrabarti D. Marr J. Nilsen T. Komuniecki R. Molecular and Medical Parasitology. Academic Press, New York2002: 241-276Google Scholar). Here we report functional characterization of giardial homologues of ERK1 and ERK2. Our study provides evidence of differential subcellular localization and activation of giardial ERK1 and ERK2 in trophozoites and in encysting cells. Our results indicate, for the first time, that giardial ERK1 and ERK2 possess functional differences, when they are thought to have overlapping functions, and that ERK1 and ERK2 may be regulated differentially. Unless specified, all materials were obtained from Sigma, Fisher, and Invitrogen. G. lamblia (WB clone C6, ATCC 50803) were maintained in TYI-S-33 medium with 10% bovine serum and bile (25Keister D.B. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1983; 77: 487-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Encystation was induced essentially as described by Kane et al. (4Kane A.V. Ward H.D. Keusch G.T. Pereira M.E.A. J. Parasitol. 1991; 77: 974-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, encystation was induced by growing trophozoites for one culture cycle in TYI-S-33. Media were poured off along with unattached trophozoites and replaced with encystation medium containing 10 mg/ml bovine bile at pH 7.8 and incubated at 37 °C for the time specified. Encystation medium was replaced with TYI-S-33 medium at 24 h, and incubation was continued for 48 h. Encysting cells were harvested at different time points by chilling and centrifugation and subsequently used for protein extraction. A 2.0-kb DNA fragment of ERK1 containing the entire open reading frame and a 530-bp fragment of ERK2 were obtained by PCR amplification of Giardia genomic DNA using primers (forward, 5′-CCCTAATTAAGCCAGTGACATA-3′, and reverse, 5′-AAGCCCGTAGCCCCAGTTC-3′ for ERK1 and forward, 5′-GCGGGCATGCTGATTGTGTTAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-ATAGACGACGATGATAAGAG for ERK2) designed using sequences available in theGiardia Genome Sequencing Data base (27, www.mbl.edu/Giardia/). The amplified fragments were sequenced, and the ERK2 fragment was used to screen a Giardia λZapII cDNA library. The full-length cDNA of the G. lamblia homologue of ERK2 was obtained by screening aGiardia λZAPII cDNA library using a [32P]dATP-labeled ERK2 probe amplified using a strand-specific primer as described previously (28Abel E.S.

Cloned fragments were sequenced using a capillary electrophoresis-based automated DNA sequencer (ABI Prism, 310 Genetic analyzer; ABI, Foster City, CA). Raw output was analyzed using ABI Prism sequence analysis software. The sequence identity was compared with the NCBI data base using PSI-BLAST. Multiple sequence alignment was done using MegAlign program from DNAstar (Madison, WI) software. Molecular three-dimensional models of gERK1 and gERK2 were generated using Geno3D on-line model analysis service, and pdb1erk and pdb2erk as templates, respectively (29Combet C. Jambon M. Deleage G. Geourjon C. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 213-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA fromGiardia was isolated using a standard protocol as described by Maniatis and co-workers (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E, F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.37-9.57Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted using an RNA isolation kit (Stratagene) according to the supplier's protocol.32P-Labeled Giardia ERK1 (gERK1) and ERK2 (gERK2) cDNA probes were used for Southern hybridization as described previously (31Chakrabarti R. McCracken J.B., Jr. Chakrabarti D. Souba W.W. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 153: 163-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For Northern blots, strand-specific probes were used (28Abel E.S.

The open reading frames of gERK1 and gERK2 were cloned into T7 polymerase-driven bacterial expression vectors pET41 (Novagen) and pET30Ek/LIC (Novagen), respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two primers (forward, 5′-AGTCCCATGGGAATGCCGCTGGCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-AGTGCGGCCGCTTACATCCACACAGA-3′) were designed to amplify gERK1 ORF (1.158 kb) containing NcoI and NotI sites for cloning into pET41. The ORF of gERK2 (1.086 kb) was cloned into pET30 by ligation-independent cloning method (27Smith M.W. Aley S.B. Sogin M. Gillin F.D. Evans G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) using primers (forward 5′-GACGACGACAAGATGTCTGACGACGAAT-3′ and reverse 5′-GAGGAGAAGCCCGGTTCACTCGTCTTCCTT-3′). Expression constructs were used to transform BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells. Transformed cells were induced with either 1.0 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (ERK1) or 0.5 mm (ERK2) isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C to overexpress recombinant gERK1 (75 kDa) and gERK2 (47 kDa) as glutathione S-transferase-tagged and His-tagged fusion proteins, respectively. Expressed proteins were purified through cobalt affinity column (TALON superflow resin, Clontech Laboratories) and used for in vitro kinase assays and generation of rabbit polyclonal antibodies through a commercial vendor (Cocalico, Reamstown, PA). The His tag (pET30 ERK2) and glutathioneS-transferase tag (pET41 ERK1) sequences added 6 and 31 kDa of molecular masses to the fusion proteins, respectively. Trophozoites or encysting cells at different time points were harvested, and crude cell extracts (50 μg) in Tris-HCl (100 mm, pH 7.0) were used for immunodetection of endogenous dephosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 using anti-gERK1 and anti-gERK2 polyclonal antibodies. Phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 in the crude extracts with or without treatment with λ phosphatase (2000 units for 30 min at 30 °C) were detected by an anti-phospho-ERK polyclonal antibody that recognized both ERK1 and ERK2 (Cell Signaling Technologies). Expression of CWP1 in encysting cells was detected by immunoblot analysis using anti-CWP1 monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Henry Stibbs, Waterborne Inc.). Positive signals were detected using a chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) and an anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. For immunoprecipitation (28Abel E.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10320-10329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), trophozoites or encysting cells were lysed in TAN buffer (10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Crude cell extracts were treated with rabbit serum followed by protein A-agarose beads to eliminate nonspecific binding of proteins to antibody. The protein A-agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated with the appropriate antibody. Protein-antibody complexes were captured by protein A-agarose beads, washed, and collected by centrifugation. Protein A-agarose beads bound to the immune complex were then resuspended in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.0, and used for subsequent experiments. Purified recombinant gERK1 and gERK2 (5 μg) or semi-compact protein A-agarose beads pellets of immunoprecipitated gERK1 and gERK2 (25 μl) were used in a 50-μl reaction containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 600 μm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2 (ERK2) or 10 mmMgCl2 (ERK1), 6 nm [γ-32P]ATP, and 100 μm of myelin basic protein (MBP). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 10 (ERK2) or 30 min (ERK1), and 30 μl (recombinant protein only) were spotted on phosphocellulose filter discs after addition of 5 μl of EDTA (100 mm) to stop the reaction. Filter discs were washed with 1% H3PO4, and bound radioactivity was detected in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). The remaining 20 μl of the reaction mix (recombinant protein) or the 50 μl of the reaction mix (immunoprecipitated protein) was combined with 4× Laemmli sample buffer and resolved in SDS-PAGE (12–14%). Phosphorylation of MBP was detected by autoradiography and PhosphorImager (AmershamBiosciences) analysis. Trophozoites (350–700 cells/ml) were cultured on 12-mm glass coverslips placed in 24-well tissue culture dishes and allowed to grow for 65–70 h in an AnaeroPack jar (Mitshubishi Gas Chemical Co.) at 37 °C. In some experiments, trophozoites were exposed to encystation medium, and cells were fixed after the specified time. Trophozoites or encysting cells attached on coverslips were fixed in 100% chilled methanol (−20 °C) for 10 min at −20 °C and further permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Permeabilized cells were blocked in blocking buffer (5% goat serum and 1% glycerol in PBS) and incubated with appropriate rabbit polyclonal antibody (ERK1 1:3000 and ERK2 1:6000 in blocking buffer). At the end of incubation, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with an Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, CA) secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer (1:100). Cells were washed in PBS and counterstained with DAPI (0.1 μm). Cells were washed in PBS and post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences), rinsed with PBS and mounted on Gelmount (Biomeda Corp.). Localization of the target proteins was detected in a Delta Vision Image Restoration Microscope using SoftWoRX image analysis software. DIC images of the localization were captured in a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. We have cloned giardial homologues of ERK1 (ORF 1.15 kb, 386 amino acids) by direct PCR amplification of the genomic DNA and ERK2 (ORF 1.086 kb, 362 amino acids) by screening a λZAPIIGiardia cDNA library. Upon screening the library using a 530-bp fragment as a probe, a 1.15-kb cDNA clone of ERK2 was obtained (GenBankTM accession number AY149274 for ERK1 and accession number AY149275 for ERK2). Multiple sequence analysis of the translated amino acid sequence of the ORF showed thatGiardia ERK1 had 51% identity with Dictyostelium discoideum ERK1, 49% identity with Chlamydomonas reinhardtii MAPK, 48% identity with Arabidopsis thaliana MAPK, 42% identity with Schizosaccharomyces pombe SPK1, and 43% identity with human ERK1 with a probability score between e-100 and 1e-76. The deduced amino acid sequence of Giardia ERK2 ORF exhibited 66% identity with D. discoideum ERK2, 59% identity with L. mexicana MAPK2, 57% identity with P. falciparumMAPK1, and 50% identity with human ERK8 with a probability score between e-131 and 2e-94. The gERK2 cDNA clone contains a short 9-bp 5′- and a 56-bp 3′-untranslated sequence that are typical for Giardiatranscripts. Multiple sequence alignment of the amino acid sequence of the ERK1/2 catalytic domain revealed that all 11 subdomains, characteristic of serine/threonine kinases, are present in both gERK1 and gERK2 (Figs. 1 A and2 A). This includes the consensus motif GXGXXGXV (Gly26–Val33 gERK1 and Gly25–Val32 gERK2) in subdomain I for anchoring non-transferable phosphates of ATP, the invariant Lys (Lys-48 ERK1 and Lys-47ERK2) and the surrounding region (Val45–Ser51, ERK1, Val44–Ser50 ERK2) in subdomain II for binding and orienting ATP for maximum enzymatic activity, and the glutamic acid (Glu66 ERK1, Glu65 ERK2) in the subdomain III involved in formation of a salt bridge with Lys48 and Lys47. The catalytic loops in both ERK1 and ERK2 are nearly 100% homologous with the HRDLKXXN motif (His143–Asn150 ERK1 and His138–Asn145 ERK2). The conserved TXY motif for dual phosphorylation (Thr191–Tyr193 ERK1 and Thr180–Tyr182 ERK2) for the activation of the enzyme is also present. Five other amino acids, Phe54(PheF53 gERK2), Arg62 (Arg61gERK2), His121 (His116 gERK2), Lys134 (Lys129 gERK2), and Cys157(Cys152 gERK2), considered to be the signature residues for MAPK as they are not shared by any other kinases including the CDKs (32Dorin D.

Molecular three-dimensional modeling of gERK1 and gERK2 revealed the presence of additional α-helices (Fig. 1, B and C, and Fig. 2, B and C) in giardial ERK1/2 when compared with rat extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pdb1erk) and phospho-ERK2 (pdb2erk) indicating significant structural differences between mammalian ERK1/2 and giardial ERK1/2. Functional implication of these additional α-helices is unclear at this moment.Figure 2Multiple sequence alignment and structural analysis of gERK2.

Northern blot analysis of gERK1 and gERK2 revealed that both are expressed as a single transcript of 1.3 kb for ERK1 and 1.2 kb for ERK2, respectively, in trophozoites (data not shown). Analysis of the protein products by Western blotting of cell extracts indicated that the expression of the 44-kDa gERK1 or the 41-kDa gERK2 did not fluctuate during growth and encystation (Figs. 8 and 9). The size of the native gERK1 and gERK2 was in agreement with the deduced amino acid sequences from the ORFs.Figure 9In vitro kinase assay with immunoprecipitated gERK2.

In vitro kinase assays revealed that both recombinant ERK1 and ERK2 were catalytically active (Fig. 3) and phosphorylated MBP with different efficiency (specific activities: 3.7 ± 0.3 nmol of phosphate/μmol of ERK1/s and 20.1 ± 0.06 nmol of phosphate/μmol of ERK2/s). Recombinant ERK2 was ∼5 times more efficient than ERK1 in incorporating phosphates into MBP and was capable of autophosphorylation (Fig. 3, E and C). No autophosphorylation was noted for gERK1, which suggests that gERK1 possibly can maintain a basal level of activity without being activated by phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A). This is apparently reflected into the lower efficiency of phosphorylation of MBP by the recombinant gERK1, and therefore, the activity of the recombinant gERK1 may not represent the full phosphorylating potential of the endogenous gERK1. At the standard reaction conditions using 5 μg of the enzyme and varying concentrations of MBP, the apparent K mvalues for the MBP were in the micromolar range (31.8 ± 8.5 μm ERK1 and 33.1 ± 7.3 μm ERK2) (Fig. 3, B, D and E), which are close to that reported for the mouse ERK2 (33Antonsson B. Marshall C.J. Montessuit S. Arkinstall S. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Both ERK1 and ERK2 preferred ATP to GTP as the phosphate donor (ERK1, Mg2+ATPKm265.5 ± 36.0 μm; ERK2, Mg2+ATPKm32.1 ± 2.5 μm); however, ERK2 was 8 times more efficient in utilizing ATP than ERK1. Giardial ERK1 and ERK2 also favored Mg2+ than Mn2+ as the divalent cation (ERK1, MgKm, 1.53 ± 0.4 mm; ERK2, MgKm, 0.265 ± 0.001 μm) (Fig. 3 E). Although the kinetic parameters for the recombinant gERK2 were comparable with that for the mammalian ERK2, the catalytic efficiency of the recombinant gERK1 was relatively poor. To determine the catalytic activities of the endogenous ERK1 and ERK2, we immunoprecipitated ERK1 and ERK2 from the trophozoite extracts using anti-gERK1 and -gERK2 rabbit polyclonal antibodies. The specificity of the anti-ERK1 and -ERK2 antibodies was determined previously by Western blot analysis of the purified recombinant enzymes and crude trophozoite extracts (Fig. 4 and5), which indicated a single peptide band of 75 kDa for the recombinant ERK1 and a 44-kDa polypeptide band for the endogenous ERK1 recognized by the antibody at a dilution of 1:4000 (Fig. 4, A and B). Similarly, anti-ERK2 antibody recognized a single major polypeptide band of 47 kDa for the recombinant ERK2 and a 41-kDa band for the endogenous ERK2 at a dilution of 1:30,000 (Fig. 5, A and B). Neither ERK1 nor ERK2 antibodies cross-reacted with the recombinant gERK2 or gERK1, respectively (data not shown). Immunoprecipitated ERK1 and ERK2 were subjected to in vitro kinase assays using MBP as the substrate. Results presented in Figs. 4 (C and D) and 5 (C and D) indicated that both endogenous ERK1 and ERK2 were catalytically active and capable of phosphorylating MBP.Figure 5Immunoblot analysis and kinase assay of immunoprecipitated ERK2.

Five classes of PLDs have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana, and Ca2+ and polyphosphoinositides have been suggested as key regulators for these enzymes. To investigate the catalysis and regulation mechanism of individual PLDs, surface-dilution kinetics studies were carried out on the newly identified PLDδ fromArabidopsis. PLDδ activity was dependent on both bulk concentration and surface concentration of substrate phospholipids in the Triton X-100/phospholipid mixed micelles.V max, K sA, andK mB values for PLDδ toward phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine were determined; phosphatidylethanolamine was the preferred substrate. PLDδ activity was stimulated greatly by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Maximal activation was observed at a PIP2 molar ratio around 0.01. Kinetic analysis indicates that PIP2 activates PLD by promoting substrate binding to the enzyme, without altering the bulk binding of the enzyme to the micelle surface. Ca2+ is required for PLDδ activity, and it significantly decreased the interfacial Michaelis constantK mB. This indicates that Ca2+activates PLD by promoting the binding of phospholipid substrate to the catalytic site of the enzyme.

Phospholipase D (PLD) 1The abbreviations used are: PLD, phospholipase D; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase1The abbreviations used are: PLD, phospholipase D; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase(EC 3.1.4.4) has drawn increasing attention in recent years because of its involvement in numerous cellular processes. PLD catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipids at the terminal phosphodiester bond, producing a free head group and phosphatidic acid. Activation of PLD in the cell generates signaling messengers and is involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including hormone action, meiosis, defense response, and vesicular trafficking (1Wang X. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 2Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 3Frohman M.A. Sung T.C. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The activity of PLD is tightly regulated, and its cellular regulation is often coordinated with the networks of other cellular signaling machinery. PLDs form a major family of phospholipases in plants (4Wang X. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 211-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). InArabidopsis, 12 PLD genes have been identified. These are tentatively grouped into five classes, PLDα (1,2, 3, and 4), -β(1 and 2), -γ (1,2, and 3), -δ, and -ζ (1 and 2), based on gene architecture, sequence similarity, domain structure, biochemical properties, and the order of cDNA cloning (5Qin C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). These PLDs display different dependences on two common cellular regulators, Ca2+ and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). The activity of PLDα is independent of PIP2 when assayed at millimolar concentrations of Ca2+, whereas PLDβ and -γ are PIP2-dependent and most active at micromolar levels of Ca2+ (6Qin W. Pappan K. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28267-28273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the most recently identified PLDζ1 does not require Ca2+ or any divalent cations for activity (5Qin C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Some of the PLDs also differ in substrate specificity. PLDζ1 selectively hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine (PC) (5Qin C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), whereas other PLDs are able to hydrolyze the common membrane lipids, PC, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylglycerol (7Pappan K. Austin-Brown S. Chapman K.D. Wang X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recent analyses on stress-induced lipid hydrolysis show that PLDα primarily uses PC as a substrate (8Zien C.A. Wang C. Wang X. Welti R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1530: 236-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 9Welti R. Li W. Li M. Sang Y. Biesiada H. Zhou H.E. Rajashekar C.B. Williams T.D. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31994-32002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), although it can hydrolyze other phospholipids in vitro (7Pappan K. Austin-Brown S. Chapman K.D. Wang X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that different PLDs are subjected to unique control, and their activation may lead to selective hydrolysis of different membrane lipids in the cell. Knowing the kinetic properties of individual PLDs will greatly help understand the catalysis, substrate selectivity, and mechanism of regulation by cellular effectors, such as Ca2+ and PIP2. Because PLDs act on substrates that form a lipid-water interface, both two-dimensional surface interactions and three-dimensional bulk interactions need to be considered in order to describe the action of these enzymes.

We report here the kinetic analysis of a recently identified PLD, PLDδ, from Arabidopsis (19Wang C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 20Katagiri T. Takahashi S. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 2001; 26: 595-605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like most plant PLDs, the activity of PLDδ requires Ca2+ and is stimulated by PIP2 (19Wang C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the PLDδ activity is distinctively different from other characterized ArabidopsisPLD in that it is activated by oleic acid (19Wang C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), is associated with the plasma membrane (19Wang C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and binds to microtubules (21Gardiner J.C. Harper J.D.I. Weerakoon N.D. Collings D.A. Ritchie S. Gilroy S. Cyr R.J.

Results presented here describe the interaction of PLDδ with lipid substrates, the substrate preference, and the mode of activation of PLDδ by Ca2+ and PIP2. All the phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar lipids. Dipalmitoylglycero-3-phospho-[methyl-3H]choline and dioleoylglycero-3-P-[ethanolamine-2-14C]ethanolamine were products of PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Full-length cDNAs of Arabidopsis PLDδ and PLDβ were cloned into pGEX-4T-1 and pGEX-2T-1 vectors (Amersham Biosciences) (19Wang C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Zheng L. Shan J. Krishnamoorthi R. Wang X. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), respectively, which produced a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion at the N terminus. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli JM109 and then into BL21 (Promega). All cell cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani medium with 50 mg/liter ampicillin. The transformed cells were grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of ∼1.0 at 600 nm. Five milliliters of the cells was transferred into a 1-liter flask with 200 ml of LB medium containing 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside and incubated overnight at room temperature. Then the cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.8 mmKH2PO4 (pH 7.3), with addition of 5 mm dithiothreitol and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The GST fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), following the manufacturer's instructions. The GST tag was removed by thrombin digestion at room temperature overnight with gentle shaking. The protein purity was checked on SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie Blue, and protein concentration was estimated by using a dye-binding protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Purified protein (0.1–0.5 μg) was used per reaction, depending on different enzymes and substrates, so that less than 5% of the substrate was hydrolyzed. Two μCi of [3H]PC or 0.5 μCi of [14C]PE was added to 1 μmol of cold PC or 1 μmol of cold PE in chloroform, respectively. The chloroform solutions were dried under a stream of nitrogen, and de-ionized water was added to give a final phospholipid concentration of 1 mm. The phospholipid suspension was probe-sonicated on ice until clear. To obtain the desired substrate concentration at the desired mole fraction, the phospholipid solution was diluted with Triton X-100 stock solution (40 mm) using the following formula: mole fractionphospholipid = [phospholipid]/([phospholipid] + [Triton X-100 (free)]); [Triton X-100 (free)] = [Triton X-100 (total)] − critical micelle concentration of Triton X-100 (0.24 mm) (23Lichtenberg D. Robson R.J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 737: 285-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). When the effect of PIP2 mole concentration was to be tested, PIP2 was added at this point, using the following formula: mole fractionPIP2 = [PIP2]/([total phospholipid] + [Triton X-100 (free)]). The Triton X-100/phospholipid mixture was vortexed briefly and let stand at room temperature for half an hour. The total phospholipid concentration in Triton X-100/phospholipid mixed micelles did not exceed 25 mol % to ensure that the structure of the mixed micelles was similar to the structure of pure Triton X-100. PLD activity was measured by following the release of [3H]choline from dipalmitoylglycero-3-phospho-[methyl-3H]choline or [14C]ethanolamine from dioleoyl-glycero-3-P-[ethanolamine-2-14C]ethanolamine. The basic assay mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 80 mm KCl, 200 μm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, the indicated concentrations of Triton X-100/phospholipid vesicles, and purified PLD protein, in a total volume of 100 μl. The reactions were initiated by adding enzyme proteins and were stopped by adding 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and then 100 μl of 2 m KCl. The release of the radiolabeled head groups into the aqueous phase was quantitated by scintillation counting. All assays were conducted for 15 min at 30 °C. The enzyme reactions were linear with time and protein concentration. To study the kinetic behavior of PLDδ, we used a detergent/phospholipid mixed micelle assay system, following the surface dilution model of enzyme kinetics (10Deems R.A. Eaton B.R. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9013-9020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Roberts M.F. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This model takes into account both two-dimensional surface interaction and three-dimensional bulk interaction between an enzyme and lipid substrate. Such consideration is critical in determining the kinetic parameters of these enzymes because lipid-dependent enzymes, such as PLD, catalyze reactions at a water-lipid interface (10Deems R.A. Eaton B.R. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9013-9020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The principle of the surface dilution model is presented in Equation 1 (24Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Bulk stepSurface stepE+A↔k−1k1EAEA+B↔k−2k2EAB↔k−3k3EA+Q(Eq. 1) According to this model, the action of enzyme (E) consists of two consecutive steps. First, the enzyme interacts non-catalytically with the surface of detergent/lipid mixed micelles (A). Subsequently, the enzyme-mixed micelle complex (EA) binds to an individual lipid substrate (B) at its catalytic site, which leads to the hydrolysis of substrate to product (Q). The first association depends on the bulk concentrations of both E and A, whereas the second step depends on the surface concentrations of EA andB. Here A represents the sum of the molar concentrations of detergent and lipid substrate, and B is the mole fraction of lipid substrate in the mixed micelle. Equation 2 is the rate expression for surface dilution kinetic model (10Deems R.A. Eaton B.R. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9013-9020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hendrickson H.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5734-5739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Carman G.M.

V max is the true V max when both the bulk concentration and the surface concentration of the lipid substrate approach infinity.K sA, which is equal tok −1/k 1 and expressed in bulk concentration terms, is the dissociation constant describing the interaction of the enzyme with the mixed micelles in the first binding step. K mB, equal to (k −2 +k 3)/k 2, defines the interfacial Michaelis constant for the second binding step and is expressed in surface concentration units, such as mole fraction. Triton X-100 is one of the most frequently employed detergents for surface dilution kinetics. It has been shown to form uniform mixed micelles with a variety of lipid molecules including PC (23Lichtenberg D. Robson R.J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 737: 285-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 25Robson R.J. Dennis E.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 1983; 16: 251-258Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar), PE (26Robson R.J. Dennis E.A.

Chem. 1975; 250: 8004-8009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By using purifiedArabidopsis PLDδ (Fig.1 A), the data show that Triton X-100 serves as a neutral dilutor at the concentration range (0.5–2.5 mm) employed in this study. Arabidopsis PLDδ was inactive toward vesicles composed of only PC or only PE, and it became active when Triton X-100 was included. When the molar concentration of substrate phospholipid was held at 0.1 mm, the optimal activity was achieved at around 0.5 mm Triton X-100 (Fig. 1 B). Afterward, PLDδ activity exhibited typical surface dilution effects in the presence of increasing concentrations of Triton X-100 in Triton X-100/phospholipids mixed micelles (Fig. 1 B). The enzyme activity decreased when the surface concentration of the lipid substrate in the mixed micelle was diluted by the addition of detergent as the bulk concentration of the substrate was kept the same. PLDδ activity was determined as a function of the sum of the molar concentrations of Triton X-100 and PC (A of Equation 2) at a series of mole fractions of PC (B of Equation 2) (Fig.2 A). The activity was dependent on the sum of molar concentrations of Triton X-100 and PC at each surface concentration. As the surface concentration of PC in the mixed micelles decreased, the apparent V maxdecreased. A double-reciprocal plot of the results in Fig.2 A indicates that PLDδ exhibits saturation kinetics when the bulk concentration of Triton X-100 and PC was varied at each fixed mole fraction of PC (Fig. 2 B). According to Equation 2, the replot of the 1/V intercepts versus1/B from Fig. 2 B should be linear; the intercept of the 1/V intercept axis is equal to 1/V max, and the intercept of the 1/Baxis is equal to −1/K mB. A replot of the data is linear (Fig. 2 C), and theV max and K mB are 1.0 μmol/min/mg and 0.13 mole fraction, respectively (TableI). Equation 2 also predicts that a replot of the slopes versus 1/B from Fig.2 B should be linear and cross the origin, and the slope of the replot is equal to K sA K mB/V max. Fig.2 D shows that such a replot was linear and passed the origin. By using the slope of the line in Fig. 2 D and the values for V max andK mB obtained in Fig. 2 C, the dissociation constant K sA for the Triton X-100/PC mixed micelle was calculated to be 1.5 mm (TableI).Table IKinetic parameters of PLDδ toward PC and PEPCPEV max (μmol/min/mg)1.01.5KsA(mm)1.53.5KmB (mole fraction)0.130.03V max/KmB7.750These parameters were calculated from panel C andpanel D of Fig. 2 (PC) and Fig. 6 (PE), according to Equation 2 of the surface dilution kinetic model.KsA is the dissociation constant describing the interaction of the enzyme with the mixed micelles, expressed in bulk concentration terms.V max is the true Vmax at an infinite mole fraction and an infinite bulk concentration of lipid substrate.KmB is the interfacial Michaelis constant, expressed in surface concentration units, mole fraction.

PIP2 is an important co-factor and regulator of various PLD activities (1Wang X. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 2Liscovitch M. Czarny M.

Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It is required forArabidopsis PLDβ and -γ activities but not for PLDα (6Qin W. Pappan K. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28267-28273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the above experiments, we have shown that PLDδ did not require PIP2 when assayed in the Triton X-100/PC mixed micelles. To test whether the previously reported PIP2-requiring PLDs are active toward the Triton X-100/PC mixed micelles, we measured and compared the activities of PLDβ and -δ as functions of PC mole fraction in the absence of PIP2 (Fig. 3 A). No activity was detected for PLDβ, showing that its PIP2requirement is not affected by the assay conditions. PLDβ became active when PIP2 was included in the detergent micelles (Fig. 3 B). PIP2 greatly stimulated PLDδ activity (Fig.3 B). When PLD activity was measured as a function of PIP2 mole fraction in the Triton X-100/PC/PIP2mixed micelles, the molar concentration of PC was set at 0.2 mm, and the PC mole fraction was set at 0.2. Dramatic increases of both PLDβ and PLDδ activities were observed when the PIP2 mole fraction increased, with the maximal activation achieved at PIP2 mole fraction around 0.01. TheK act for PLDβ and -δ were similar, around 0.002 to 0.003 mole fraction of PIP2 in the mixed micelles. To study the possible mechanism by which PIP2 stimulates the PLDδ activity, we compared the two constants,K sA and K mB, in the absence or presence of PIP2. For determining the effect of PIP2 on K sA, PLDδ activity was measured as a function of the sum of the molar concentrations of Triton X-100 and PC at three set mole fractions of PIP2 (0, 0.002, and 0.02) (Fig. 4 A) with the PC mole fraction fixed at 0.1. Although increasing molar ratio of PIP2 increased the apparent V max, it did not significantly change the apparentK sA (Fig. 4 A). This suggests that PIP2 does not affect the bulk binding of PLDδ to the mixed micelles. For examining the effect of PIP2 onK mB, PLDδ activity was measured as a function of the mole fraction of PC at the same three set PIP2 mole fractions (Fig. 4 B). The apparent interfacial Michaelis constant, K mB, decreased about 2–3-fold in the presence of PIP2, and the apparent V max increased with the increase of PIP2 mole fraction (Fig. 4 B). Overall, the specificity constant (apparentV max/K mB) increased up to 10-fold in the presence of 0.02 mole fraction of PIP2. These results suggest that PIP2 may activate PLDδ by increasing the affinity of its catalytic site to the phospholipid substrate but may not affect its binding to the Triton X-100/phoshpolipid mixed micelle surface. Ca2+ is another important regulator for plant PLD activity. The optimal Ca2+ concentration for PLDδ activity in the Triton X-100/PC mixed micelle system was around 1 mm, and this optimum was not affected by the presence of PIP2 in the mixed micelles (Fig. 5 A). To determine the effect of Ca2+ onK mB, PLDδ activity was measured as a function of the PC mole fraction in the mixed micelles at two Ca2+ concentrations, 0.2 and 1 mm (Fig.5 B). Apparent K mB at 1 mm of Ca2+ was nearly 3-fold lower than the apparent K mB at 0.2 mm of Ca2+ (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that Ca2+ may activate PLDδ by promoting the binding of the phospholipid substrate to the catalytic site of the enzyme. The substrate preference of PLDδ was studied by substituting PC with PE in the Triton X-100 mixed micelles and measuring the activity of PLDδ as a function of the sum of the molar concentrations of Triton X-100 plus PE (A) at a series of set mole fractions of PE (B). The PLDδ activity was dependent both on the sum of the bulk concentration of Triton X-100 and PE and on the surface concentration of PE in the mixed micelles (Fig. 6 A). As predicted by Equation 2, both the replot of 1/V intercepts (from Fig. 6 B) versus 1/B and the replot of the slopes versus 1/B were linear, with the latter going through the origin (Fig. 6, C andD). By using the two intercepts obtained from Fig.6 C and the line slope from Fig. 6 D, we calculated the V max, K sA, andK mB for PE to be 1.5 μmol/min/mg, 3.5 mm, and 0.03 mole fraction, respectively (Table I). The above results indicate that PLDδ follows the surface dilution kinetic model using two common phospholipid substrates, PC and PE, but the catalytic constants of these two phospholipids are quite different (Table I). The V max of PE is about 1.5-fold higher than that of PC, whereas the interfacial Michaelis constant, K mB, of PE is about 4–5-fold lower. Therefore, the specific constant (V max/K mB) of PE is about 7-fold higher than that of PC, suggesting that PE has a higher affinity to the catalytic site of the enzyme. On the other hand, the dissociation constant, K sA, of PE is similar to or slightly higher than that of PC. This suggests that PLDδ has similar affinities for binding sites to Triton X-100/PC and Triton X-100/PE mixed micelles. To confirm that PE indeed serves as a better substrate for PLDδ, we carried out side-by-side comparison toward the two substrates. In this analysis, PLDδ activity was measured as a function of the sum of the molar concentrations of Triton X-100 plus phospholipid, at a set phospholipid mole fraction of 0.1 (Fig.7 A). The apparent dissociation constants, K sA, of PC and PE were very similar, whereas the apparent V max of PE was about 3-fold higher than that of PC (Fig. 7 A). In Fig.7 B, PLDδ activity was measured as a function of the phospholipid mole fraction at a set phospholipid molar concentration of 0.1 mm. The apparent V max of PE was about 2-fold higher than that of PC, whereas the apparent interfacial Michaelis constant, K mB, of PE was much lower, around 4–5-fold smaller than that of PC. Therefore, the specificity constant (apparentV max/K mB) of PE was almost 9-fold higher than the specificity constant of PC. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 6, this indicates that PE is a preferred substrate for PLDδ, and it may have higher affinity to the catalytic site of the enzyme than PC. On the other hand, similar dissociation constants of PC and PE may suggest that PLDδ had similar affinities for Triton X-100/PC and Triton X-100/PE mixed micelles; hence the first binding step of PLDδ to the mixed micelle surface was nonspecific. The present study provides the first detailed kinetic description of a PLD on its interaction with lipids. The results help understand the mechanism behind the substrate selectivity and activity regulation of PLD. Activation of PLD in the cells is achieved by a number of regulators, which can vary from individual PLDs (1Wang X. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 2Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 3Frohman M.A. Sung T.C. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Among those, PIP2 is a universal activator of PLD. It is required by animal and yeast PLDs, and Arabidopsis PLDβ, -γ, and -ζ. Though not required, it stimulates greatly the activity of PLDα and -δ. Mutagenesis results have identified specific amino acid regions on mammalian (29Sciorra V.A. Rudge S.A. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5911-5921Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and plant (22Zheng L. Shan J. Krishnamoorthi R. Wang X. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) PLDs that are involved in PIP2 binding, but how PIP2 affects PLD catalysis is unclear. A previous study on a partially purified rat brain PLD fraction showed maximal PIP2 activation was observed at PIP2 molar ratio of 0.01, and theK act was calculated to be between 0.001 and 0.002 (30Chalifa-Caspi V. Eli Y. Liscovitch M. Neurochem. Res. 1998; 23: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which are similar to the results obtained in this study (Fig. 3 B). However, it was unknown which one of the kinetic constants was affected by PIP2. Results from this study show that PIP2 has no effect onK sA (Fig. 4 A) but significantly decreases K mB (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that PIP2 promotes lipid substrate binding to the active site of the enzyme, without affecting the bulk binding of PLDδ to the micelle surface. These results are consistent with the previous mutagenesis work showing that PIP2 binding enhances PC binding to the catalytic site of PLDβ (22Zheng L. Shan J. Krishnamoorthi R. Wang X. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Zheng L. Krishnamoorthi R. Zolkiewski M. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19700-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Those studies show that PIP2 binds to PLDβ at the C2 domain and the catalytic region, but Ca2+ modulates the binding differentially. In the absence or at low levels of Ca2+, PLDβ binds to PIP2 at the C2 domain. Higher concentrations of Ca2+ inhibit this binding but enhance the binding of PIP2 to the catalytic region, which promotes PC binding and catalysis (31Zheng L. Krishnamoorthi R. Zolkiewski M. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19700-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). One PIP2-binding site near the catalytic region has been identified in PLDβ (22Zheng L. Shan J. Krishnamoorthi R. Wang X. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It lies between the two HKDs and contains many basic side chains (Lys, Arg, and His), and these critical basic residues are conserved in PLDδ. This region is essential for PLDβ activity, and the deletion of this region abolished the phospholipid stimulation effect on PC binding to the enzyme (22Zheng L. Shan J. Krishnamoorthi R. Wang X. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although PIP2 binding itself is not required for PLDδ activity, this conserved region may also be responsible for the PIP2 stimulation effect observed for PLDδ. The different PIP2 requirements suggest that other unique factor(s) may help activate PLDδ. Oleic acid has been shown to be a specific stimulator for PLDδ but not for other ArabidopsisPLDs (19Wang C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The present data show that the oleic acid requirement by PLDδ can be substituted by Triton X-100, consistent with the hypothesis that oleic acid may affect substrate presentation and modulating PLD-substrate interaction. PLDδ, like most other plant PLDs, requires Ca2+ for activity. The only exception for the cation requirement to date isArabidopsis PLDζ1 that is Ca2+-independent and contains putative phox homology/pleckstrin homology domains (5Qin C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Instead, the majority of plant PLDs contains the Ca2+/phospholipid-binding C2 domain at their C terminus (5Qin C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The ability of the PLD C2 domain to bind Ca2+ has been demonstrated in the binding and structural studies onArabidopsis PLDα C2 and PLDβ C2 (31Zheng L. Krishnamoorthi R. Zolkiewski M. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19700-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, how Ca2+ affects PLD catalysis is unknown. The present data show that Ca2+ decreases the apparent interfacial Michaelis constant, K mB (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that it promotes lipid substrate binding to the active site of the enzyme. Another significant finding of this analysis is that PLDδ prefers PE to PC as substrate and the kinetic description of this preference. This PE selectivity of PLDδ is in contrast to the preference of many other PLDs for PC as substrate. For example, the cloned mammalian PLD1 and -2 and Arabidopsis PLDζ1 use only PC as substrate (3Frohman M.A. Sung T.C. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The most prevalent Arabidopsis PLD, PLDα, selectively hydrolyzes PC, as shown by lipid analysis in freezing-stressedArabidopsis (9Welti R. Li W. Li M. Sang Y. Biesiada H. Zhou H.E. Rajashekar C.B. Williams T.D. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31994-32002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Only Arabidopsis PLDγ1 was previously indicated to have a higher activity toward PE than PC, but the kinetics and the extent of preference are not known (7Pappan K. Austin-Brown S. Chapman K.D. Wang X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The present results show that PLDδ has similar dissociation constants,K sA, for the first binding step of PE and PC, but its specificity constant (V max/K mB) for PE is about 7–9-fold higher than that of PC. Thus, it is conceivable that when PLDδ is activated in the cell, its higher affinity to PE may result in selective hydrolysis of PE and PE-enriched membranes. As two major lipids in eukaryotic membranes, PC and PE differ greatly in their membrane-forming properties and possibly cellular functions. Unlike PC, PE is a non-laminar lipid and prefers hexagonal phase formation. PE concentrations in vesicles and membranes have been shown to affect the activities of various proteins, including G-protein (32Escriba P.V. Ozaita A. Ribas C. Miralles A. Fodor E. Farkas T. Garcia-Sevilla J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11375-11380Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), phospholipase C (33Irvine R.F. Letcher A.J. Dawson R.M.C. Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), mammalian PLD (34Nakamura S. Kiyohara Y. Jinnai H. Hitomi T. Ogino C. Yoshida K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4300-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and Arabidopsis PLDβ and -γ (7Pappan K. Austin-Brown S. Chapman K.D. Wang X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, the cellular function and the mode of action of PLDδ could be distinctively different from the PC-selective PLDs."

Among the substrates for SUMO modification in vertebrates are RanGAP1 and RanBP2/Nup358, two proteins previously implicated in nucleocytoplasmic transport. Sumoylated RanGAP1 binds to the nuclear pore complex via RanBP2/Nup358, a giant nucleoporin, which was recently reported to act as a SUMO E3 ligase on some nuclear substrates. However, no direct evidence for a role of the SUMO system in nuclear transport has been obtained so far. By the use of conditional yeast mutants, we examined nuclear protein importin vivo. We show here that cNLS-dependent protein import is impaired in mutants with defective Ulp1 and Uba2, two enzymes involved in the SUMO conjugation reaction. In contrast, other transport pathways such as rgNLS-mediated protein import and mRNA export are not affected.

Specific import and export pathways converge at the NPC and are defined by distinct interactions between individual proteins (nucleoporins or nups) and shuttling transport factors, the karyopherins (1Ryan K.J. Wente S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition, the small GTPase Ran and its effector proteins RanGAP1 (Ran GTPase-activating protein) and RanGEF (Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor) are needed to confer directionality to transport processes (2Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, RanGAP1 is found in the cytoplasm and at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC where it forms a stable complex with the nucleoporin RanBP2/Nup358 (3Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 4Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Binding of RanGAP1 to RanBP2/Nup358 depends on modification of RanGAP1 with SUMO-1, a small ubiquitin-like protein modifier (5Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). It was speculated that SUMO-dependent RanGAP1 localization at the NPC provides a means to temporally regulate nucleocytoplasmic trafficking (6Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Apart from nuclear transport, sumoylation of proteins has been implicated in a number of essential cellular functions such as signal transduction, chromosome stability, and cell cycle regulation (7Kretz-Remy C. Tanguay R.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). It is an evolutionary conserved process, which is similar to protein ubiquitinylation but nevertheless functionally distinct (9Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Unlike in the case of ubiquitin, SUMO modification does not lead to substrate degradation but rather has diverse effects on protein activity and intracellular localization (10Wilson V.G. Rangasamy D. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Three distinct steps can be distinguished in the SUMO modification pathway: 1) activation of SUMO, 2) transfer of SUMO to the conjugating enzyme, and 3) substrate modification. Since SUMO is synthesized as a precursor protein, a maturation step precedes the activation reaction. In yeast, C-terminal processing of the SUMO precursor is mediated by the processing protease Ulp1, which has an additional role in the deconjugation of SUMO-modified substrates (11Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Mature SUMO is activated by SUMO-activating enzyme, an E1-like heterodimeric protein complex composed of Uba2 and Aos1 (12Dohmen R.J. Stappen R. McGrath J.P. Forrova H. Kolarov J. Goffeau A.

Genet. 2000; 263: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Following activation, the SUMO moiety is transferred to Ubc9, the E2-like-conjugating enzyme (13Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 16Schwarz S.E. Matuschewski K. Liakopoulos D. Scheffner M. Jentsch S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Ubc9 then likely interacts with the recently identified E3-like proteins Siz1 and Siz2, which presumably mediate recognition and binding of substrate proteins (17Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A.

Since deletion ofSIZ1 and SIZ2 is not lethal in yeast, other E3-like proteins specific for SUMO might exist (17Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Post-translational SUMO modification is a reversible process, and it was found that the sumoylation status of proteins varies during the cell cycle (11Li S.J. Hochstrasser M.

SUMO-deconjugating enzymes have been identified in yeast and mammals (6Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The yeast Ulp1 and Ulp2 proteins are cysteine proteases that cleave SUMO from their substrates. Despite the fact that both enzymes are similar in their biochemical activity, they clearly differ in substrate specificity and function (11Li S.J. Hochstrasser M.

So far, RanGAP1 is the only component of the transport apparatus that has been found to be SUMO conjugatedin vivo (3Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). RanBP2/Nup358 can be sumoylated in vitro (21Saitoh H. Sparrow D.B. Shiomi T. Pu R.T. Nishimoto T. Mohun T.J. Dasso M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and recently, it was shown that RanBP2/Nup358 acts as an E3 ligase on some nuclear substrates (22Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations in the Drosophila UBC9 ortholog Semushispecifically block nuclear import of the transcriptional activator Bicoid (23Epps J.L. Tanda S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1277-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In budding yeast, the RanGAP1 ortholog Rna1 is not sumoylated (6Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) and other evidence for the involvement of the SUMO modification system in nuclear transport processes has not been reported. We have therefore started to investigate a putative role of the SUMO modification system in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and report here that in yeast SUMO conjugation is important for a specific nuclear protein import pathway.DISCUSSIONIn the present work, we have investigated nucleocytoplasmic transport in yeast mutants of the SUMO modification pathway in vivo. Our results show that in mutants deficient in SUMO conjugation such as ulp1 and uba2cNLS-dependent protein import is impaired (Fig.1 A). However, other nuclear transport pathways are not generally affected since nuclear uptake of another NLS, the rgNLS, is not perturbed and general mRNA export is not blocked (Fig. 2,A and B). It is interesting to note, that the cNLS import defect in ulp1 cells can be rescued by overexpression of mature SUMO from a plasmid (Fig. 1 B). In combination with data for the uba2 strain (Fig.1 A) this suggests that it is SUMO conjugation rather than SUMO precursor processing that is needed for protein import. Ulp1's other function as a deconjugating enzyme cannot be rescued by overexpression of mature SUMO. This implicates that SUMO deconjugation is not needed for cNLS-dependent protein import, which is consistent with our observation that a strain deleted forULP2 (ulp2Δ), the other SUMO-deconjugating enzyme, does not show an import defect or mislocalization of Srp1 (Fig.1 A and data not shown). What might be the reason for the observed cNLS import block? CNLS-dependent import is one of the best characterized nuclear transport pathways so far (38Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, nuclear uptake of cNLS-containing transport cargos is mediated by the importin α/β dimer, or Srp1/Kap95 in yeast (53Enenkel C. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16499-16502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 54Gorlich D. Kostka S. Kraft R. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Curr.

A. 1995; 92: 6532-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In the cytosol, where RanGTP levels are low, Srp1 binds the cNLS substrate and subsequently associates with Kap95 to translocate through the NPC. In the nucleus, Kap95 binds to RanGTP thereby releasing Srp1 and the NLS substrate. Therefore, a high nuclear RanGTP concentration fulfils two purposes: first, import complexes are dissociated on the nuclear side of the pore by binding of RanGTP to the importin-β like transport receptor, and second, export complexes between RanGTP binding exportins such as Cse1 and their respective export cargos can be formed. A nuclear accumulation of Srp1 inulp1 and uba2 strains might therefore reflect either a lack of dissociation of the import complex due to a low nuclear RanGTP concentration, a defect in export complex formation and/or a lack of export complex docking at the NPC. Since we observe that the importin-β subunit Kap95 is not mislocalized inulp1 and uba2 strains (Fig. 4) as can be observed in Ran machinery mutants such as rna1, in which both importin subunits are mislocalized (Figs. 3 and 4), we can exclude the possibility that nuclear RanGTP concentrations significantly fluctuate in ulp1 and uba2 mutants thereby perturbing nuclear transport processes. In line with these findings is our observation that other Ran-dependent transport processes such as rgNLS-dependent protein import and mRNA export are functional in ulp1 and uba2 strains. Taken together, these results suggest that at least in yeast, a defect in SUMO conjugation has no significant impact on the Ran machinery with respect to its function in nuclear transport. Apart from the fact that in higher eukaryotes sumoylated RanGAP1 and RanBP2 are NPC-associated, they have also been found to co-localize with kinetochores and mitotic spindles which might suggest a role in the re-establishment of the Ran gradient in cells with an open mitosis (58Joseph J. Tan S.H. Karpova T.S. McNally J.G. Dasso M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical data from yeast suggest that during translocation, Srp1 containing import and export complexes interact with a distinct subset of nucleoporins such as Nup1, Nup2, and Nup60 (45Allen N.P. Huang L. Burlingame A. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29268-29274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 46Belanger K.D. Kenna M.A. Wei S. Davis L.I. J.

These nups and another nucleoporin implicated in protein import, Nsp1 (60Mutvei A. Dihlmann S. Herth W. Hurt E.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 280-295PubMed Google Scholar, 61Nehrbass U. Fabre E. Dihlmann S. Herth W. Hurt E.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 62: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar), belong to the so-called FXFG class of nups, which have been shown to reside in the nuclear basket structure and close to the central transporter in the NPC, respectively (31Solsbacher J. Maurer P. Vogel F. Schlenstedt G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8468-8479Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 47Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J.

To investigate a possible role of the NPC for Srp1 export in ulp1 anduba2 strains, we tagged Nup2, a nucleoporin previously implicated in Srp1 export (31Solsbacher J. Maurer P. Vogel F. Schlenstedt G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8468-8479Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 39Booth J.W. Belanger K.D. Sannella M.I. Davis L.I. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1471-1480PubMed Google Scholar) with GFP and investigated its localization in living yeast. We find that Nup2 is not mislocalized inulp1 and uba2 cells at permissive and non-permissive temperatures, respectively (Fig. 5 and data not shown). We also do not observe gross structural alterations of the nuclear membrane, such as membrane blebbing or, pore clustering, at any temperature tested (data not shown). Surprisingly, in the case ofulp2Δ, an intranuclear pool of Nup2 can be observed (Fig.5, A and B). This result prompted us to investigate the stoichiometry of some of the nups known to interact with Srp1 during NPC translocation. Using Northern blot and immunoblot analysis, we find that mRNA and protein levels of Nup2 and Nsp1 are not altered in ulp1 and uba2 mutants suggesting that the stoichiometry of these nups is normal in these strains (data not shown). However, despite some intranuclear Nup2 protein inulp2Δ cells, we observe no transport defect in this strain (Fig. 1 A). This indicates that Ulp2 and hence deconjugation of SUMO substrates has no significant role in nucleocytoplasmic transport. Changes in NPC composition and/or architecture are known to impair nucleocytoplasmic trafficking (62Fabre E. Hurt E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 277-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Indeed, Srp1 is not only mislocalized to the nuclear interior in ulp1 cells but also at the NPC as we can show by immunofluorescence analysis and immunogold EM (Figs. 3 and 6). This finding might indicate that Srp1 is a target for SUMO modification and as a result can no longer efficiently bind at appropriate sites in the nuclear basket structure of the NPC in mutants compromised in SUMO conjugation. An alternative explanation is that another component of the transport machinery, possibly a nuclear pore protein involved in Srp1 export is somehow impaired in its function due to a lack of SUMO conjugation in these mutants. In immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies, we were not able to detect a SUMO modification on Srp1, the Srp1 export receptor Cse1 and nups involved in Srp1 export (data not shown). Extracts were prepared fromulp1, uba2, ulp2Δ, and wild type strains grown at permissive and non-permissive temperatures according to a protocol known to preserve SUMO conjugates (13Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Although we were not able to identify a SUMO-conjugated protein probably responsible for the observed mislocalization of Srp1, our results demonstrate for the first time a role for the SUMO conjugation system in a specific nuclear protein import pathway in yeast. Nuclear Srp1 mislocalization inulp1 and uba2 strains suggests an involvement of SUMO conjugation in Srp1 export. How the SUMO system might influence Srp1 export complex formation or possibly its interaction with the NPC is not clear at this point. However, there are intriguing parallels between yeast and higher eukaryotes since the nucleoporin RanBP2/Nup358 can be sumoylated in vitro (21Saitoh H. Sparrow D.B. Shiomi T. Pu R.T. Nishimoto T. Mohun T.J. Dasso M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that RanBP2/Nup358 has E3 ligase activity toward some cNLS-containing substrates and it was speculated that sumoylation and nuclear import might be coupled processes (22Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). RanBP2/Nup358 is a multifunctional nucleoporin since it has Ran-binding motifs, zinc-finger domains, and FG repeats (63Wu J. Matunis M.J. Kraemer D. Blobel G. Coutavas E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14209-14213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in the termination reaction of nuclear protein import (64Yaseen N.R. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26493-26502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, SENP2, an Ulp1 homolog in human cells has been shown to interact with Nup153, a nucleoporin in the nuclear basket structure of the NPC (50Hang J. Dasso M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19961-19966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Nup153 has no homolog in yeast but intriguingly, importin α/β-mediated protein import is strongly reduced in nuclei that lack Nup153. This defect is specific since another protein import pathway, transportin-mediated M9-NLS import is not perturbed (65Walther T.C. Fornerod M. Pickersgill H. Goldberg M. Allen T.D. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5703-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We have tested the yeast nups known to reside in the nuclear basket structure of the NPC for a modification with SUMO. However, we were not able to detect sumoylated Nup1, Nup2, Nsp1, and Nup60 (data not shown). Interestingly, the enzymes of the SUMO modification pathway are either mostly nuclear (Uba2, Aos1, Ubc9, and Ulp2) or NPC-associated (Ulp1) (12Dohmen R.J. Stappen R. McGrath J.P. Forrova H.

Genetics. 2001; 158: 95-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but whether mutations in these proteins might influence NPC structure and concomitantly nuclear transport is currently not known. Thus, the elucidation of the molecular details of SUMO's role in nuclear protein import and possibly NPC architecture remains a challenging task for future research. The nuclear pore complex (NPC) 1The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; NLS, nuclear localization signal; EM, electron microscopy; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier1The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; NLS, nuclear localization signal; EM, electron microscopy; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier can be considered as the gateway of bidirectional traffic between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Specific import and export pathways converge at the NPC and are defined by distinct interactions between individual proteins (nucleoporins or nups) and shuttling transport factors, the karyopherins (1Ryan K.J. Wente S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition, the small GTPase Ran and its effector proteins RanGAP1 (Ran GTPase-activating protein) and RanGEF (Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor) are needed to confer directionality to transport processes (2Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, RanGAP1 is found in the cytoplasm and at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC where it forms a stable complex with the nucleoporin RanBP2/Nup358 (3Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 4Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Binding of RanGAP1 to RanBP2/Nup358 depends on modification of RanGAP1 with SUMO-1, a small ubiquitin-like protein modifier (5Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). It was speculated that SUMO-dependent RanGAP1 localization at the NPC provides a means to temporally regulate nucleocytoplasmic trafficking (6Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Apart from nuclear transport, sumoylation of proteins has been implicated in a number of essential cellular functions such as signal transduction, chromosome stability, and cell cycle regulation (7Kretz-Remy C. Tanguay R.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). It is an evolutionary conserved process, which is similar to protein ubiquitinylation but nevertheless functionally distinct (9Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Unlike in the case of ubiquitin, SUMO modification does not lead to substrate degradation but rather has diverse effects on protein activity and intracellular localization (10Wilson V.G. Rangasamy D. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Three distinct steps can be distinguished in the SUMO modification pathway: 1) activation of SUMO, 2) transfer of SUMO to the conjugating enzyme, and 3) substrate modification. Since SUMO is synthesized as a precursor protein, a maturation step precedes the activation reaction. In yeast, C-terminal processing of the SUMO precursor is mediated by the processing protease Ulp1, which has an additional role in the deconjugation of SUMO-modified substrates (11Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Mature SUMO is activated by SUMO-activating enzyme, an E1-like heterodimeric protein complex composed of Uba2 and Aos1 (12Dohmen R.J. Stappen R. McGrath J.P. Forrova H. Kolarov J. Goffeau A. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18099-18109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 13Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Conditional uba2 mutants are deficient in SUMO conjugation and accumulate free SUMO (14Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 15Schwienhorst I. Johnson E.S. Dohmen R.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Following activation, the SUMO moiety is transferred to Ubc9, the E2-like-conjugating enzyme (13Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 16Schwarz S.E. Matuschewski K. Liakopoulos D. Scheffner M. Jentsch S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Ubc9 then likely interacts with the recently identified E3-like proteins Siz1 and Siz2, which presumably mediate recognition and binding of substrate proteins (17Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 18Takahashi Y. Kahyo T. Toh E.A. Yasuda H. Kikuchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48973-48977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Since deletion ofSIZ1 and SIZ2 is not lethal in yeast, other E3-like proteins specific for SUMO might exist (17Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Post-translational SUMO modification is a reversible process, and it was found that the sumoylation status of proteins varies during the cell cycle (11Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 19Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). SUMO-deconjugating enzymes have been identified in yeast and mammals (6Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The yeast Ulp1 and Ulp2 proteins are cysteine proteases that cleave SUMO from their substrates. Despite the fact that both enzymes are similar in their biochemical activity, they clearly differ in substrate specificity and function (11Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 15Schwienhorst I. Johnson E.S. Dohmen R.J. Mol. Gen.

Information about the involvement of the SUMO modification system in nuclear trafficking is limited. So far, RanGAP1 is the only component of the transport apparatus that has been found to be SUMO conjugatedin vivo (3Mahajan R. Del"
https://openalex.org/W2118771226,"An ectopic reentrance into the cell cycle with ensuing DNA replication is required for neuronal apoptosis induced by beta-amyloid. Here, we investigate the repertoire of DNA polymerases expressed in beta-amyloid-treated neurons, and their specific role in DNA synthesis and apoptosis. We show that exposure of cultured cortical neurons to beta-amyloid induces the expression of DNA polymerase-beta, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and the p49 and p58 subunits of DNA primase. Induction requires the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases. The knockdown of the p49 primase subunit prevents beta-amyloid-induced neuronal DNA synthesis and apoptosis. Similar effects are observed by knocking down DNA polymerase-beta or by using dideoxycytidine, a preferential inhibitor of this enzyme. Thus, the reparative enzyme DNA polymerase-beta unexpectedly mediates a large component of de novo DNA synthesis and apoptotic death in neurons exposed to beta-amyloid. These data indicate that DNA polymerases become death signals when erratically expressed by differentiated neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2126325717,"The fate of cellular mRNAs was analyzed in several cell lines of lymphoid origin, after induction of apoptosis by different mechanisms. Cytoplasmic mRNAs are specifically degraded as part of the early apoptotic response. This degradation is not species restricted and is independent of the cell line, the apoptotic stimulus, the intrinsic half-life of the mRNAs, and the transcriptional status of the gene (constitutive or inducible). mRNA degradation precedes DNA fragmentation and correlates with the appearance of phosphatidylserine in the outer cell membrane. In addition, apoptosis-induced mRNA degradation is an active process that can be dissected from other apoptotic hallmarks (degradation of annexin V, DNA, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase [PARP]), which suggests that apoptosis-induced mRNA degradation is controlled by a distinct signaling pathway. Furthermore, mRNA degradation also occurs in vivo, specifically during thymocyte apoptosis. Taken together, these data support the notion that degradation of mRNA is a general early apoptotic event that may become a new apoptotic hallmark."

The process begins with activation of ubiquitin by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1),1 followed by transfer of ubiquitin to E2, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. E2 shuttles the ubiquitin molecule to the substrate-specific ubiquitin ligase (E3), which then delivers the ubiquitin to the substrate to be degraded. Initially, it was thought that ubiquitination occurred only through a lysine-dependent ubiquitination pathway in which ubiquitin is covalently attached to the substrate protein via an amide linkage to the ε-amino group of an internal lysine (5Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6793) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that the N terminus of a protein substrate may also serve as the site of ubiquitination (6Aviel S. Winberg G. Massucci M. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23491-23499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 7Reinstein E. Scheffner M. Oren M. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), a pathway termed N terminus-dependent ubiquitination. Via either ubiquitination pathway, polyubiquitin chain formation continues by the conjugation of subsequent ubiquitin moieties to the attached ubiquitin, and the substrate-ubiquitin conjugate is then degraded by the 26 S proteasome in an ATP-dependent manner. Isopeptidases cleave the ubiquitin chain, and the single ubiquitin molecules are recycled (5Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6793) Google Scholar). Currently, the relative contribution of each of these two pathways is unknown.Among the short-lived proteins degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system are several transcription factors, including MyoD. MyoD, a nuclear basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor necessary for skeletal muscle differentiation (9Weintraub H. Davis R. Tapscott S. Thayer M. Krause M. Benezra R. Blackwell K.T. Turner D. Rupp R. Hollenberg S. Zhuang Y. Lassar A. Science. 1991; 251: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar), is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system both in vitro and in vivo (10Abu Hatoum O. Gross-Mesilaty S. Breitschopf K. Hoffman A. Gonen H. Ciechanover A. Bengal E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5670-5677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitination on the N terminus of MyoD appears to occur in preference to ubiquitination on internal lysines (8Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and MyoD appears to be ubiquitinated and degraded in the nucleus by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (11Floyd Z.E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22468-22475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).A nuclear ubiquitin-proteasome system may also be responsible for the degradation of several other transcription factors, including Smad2 and the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-ARNT-Sim homology domain dioxin receptor (12Lo R.S. Massague J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 13Roberts B.J. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36351-36356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), as the activated forms of these proteins require translocation into the nucleus for degradation. In addition, Far1, a protein required for establishing cell polarity of mating yeast and for bringing about cell cycle arrest, is ubiquitinated and degraded in the nucleus (14Blondel M. Galan J.-M.

Ligand-activated Smad3, although ubiquitinated in the nucleus, is also exported to the cytoplasm for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (20Fukuchi M. Imamura T. Chiba T. Ebisawa T. Kawabata M. Tanaka K. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1431-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar).Transport of cellular proteins, including transcription factors such as MyoD, into and out of the nucleus is facilitated by nuclear localization and nuclear export sequences (NLS and NES), which facilitate transport of such proteins across the nuclear envelope (21Kuersten S.

Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar) or as bipartite regions of basic residues separated by 10–12 nonbasic residues (26Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). Less is known about NES, but they are generally comprised of regions of hydrophobic amino acids.Thus, ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation occurs in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and both lysine-dependent and N terminus-dependent ubiquitination pathways exist for several proteins, including MyoD. The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship of these ubiquitin-mediated degradation pathways using NLS and NES mutants and inhibitors of nuclear uptake and export. Herein, we report that for MyoD, both the N terminus-dependent and the lysine-dependent pathways function within the nucleus, although the lysine-dependent pathway appears to be more active in the cytoplasm. The importance of this observation lies in the elucidation of alterations in cellular protein degradation in physiological and pathophysiological states.RESULTSMyoD is localized to the cell nucleus in growing myoblasts (29Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Thayer M.J. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Science. 1988; 4877: 405-411Crossref Scopus (581) Google Scholar) and in a variety of cells following transfection (11Floyd Z.E. Trausch-Azar J.S. Reinstein E. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22468-22475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To determine the subcellular localization of lysine-less MyoD (Lys → Arg mutations) and N-terminal-blocked (6× Myc-tagged) MyoD, MyoD constructs were transfected into HeLa cells and were visualized 24 h later by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1). Transfected cells were also treated either with MG132 or with LMB 2 h prior to fixation. MG132 inhibits the proteasome, whereas LMB inhibits CRM-1-dependent nuclear export to retain MyoD within the nucleus (30Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1, wild-type MyoD, lysine-less MyoD, and N-terminal-blocked MyoD were all localized to the nucleus under basal conditions as well as in the presence of MG132 or LMB. Thus, at steady state, MyoD and its lysine-less and N-terminal-blocked mutants were found exclusively in the cell nucleus.We next compared the rates of degradation of wild-type, lysine-less, and N-terminal-blocked MyoD in vivo. 16–24 h following transfection, HeLa cells were treated with CHX to inhibit further protein synthesis, and the amount of MyoD at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h was determined via Western blot analysis. MG132 or LMB was added together with CHX in replicate samples to determine the degradation rate of these proteins under conditions in which the proteasome or nuclear export was inhibited. As seen in Fig. 2, wild-type MyoD was degraded with at 12 of 0.8 ± 0.1 h, which was markedly increased to ∼11 ± 4 h in the presence of MG132. The half-life was slightly increased in the presence of LMB to 1.3 ± 0.2 h (legend to Fig. 2). The half-lives of lysine-less MyoD and N-terminal-blocked MyoD were significantly increased over the half-lives of wild type, with t 12 of ∼2.7 ± 0.6 h and 2.6 ± 0.6 h, respectively, as seen in TableI. As with wild-type MyoD, the half-lives of lysine-less MyoD and N-terminal-blocked MyoD were markedly increased by incubation with MG132, although they were minimally affected by incubation with LMB (data not shown). Together these data suggest that wild-type MyoD, lysine-less MyoD, and N-terminal-blocked MyoD are each degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system within the nucleus.Figure 2Half-life of wild-type MyoD with MG132. A, 24 h after transfection with wild-type MyoD, HeLa cells were treated with CHX or CHX plus MG132. Cells were lysed at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 3 h and were evaluated via SDS-PAGE gel and Western blot for MyoD. B, the pixels for each band were measured and normalized so that the number of pixels at t = 0 was 100%. The log10 of the % pixels was plottedversus time for each time point, and thet 12 was calculated as the log of 50% (1.7 h). The t 12 for MyoD was 0.8 h and 11.2 h when MG132 was added. Treatment of the cells with CHX plus LMB increased the t 12 to 1.3 h (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ILocalization and t12 of wild-type MyoD and N terminus-blocked and lysine-less MyoD mutantsLocalizationt 12hWild-type MyoDNucleus0.8 ± 0.1N terminus-blocked MyoDNucleus2.7 ± 0.6Lysine-less MyoDNucleus2.6 ± 0.624 h after transfection into HeLa cells, all constructs were localized to the nucleus.

Open table in a new tab Nuclear transcription factors, including MyoD, are synthesized in the cytoplasm and are targeted to the nucleus via NLS. To determine whether MyoD or its mutants are degraded within the cytoplasm either prior to nuclear uptake or during nucleocytoplasmic recycling, we sought to identify the NLS within MyoD to generate NLS-deficient mutants.Based on results from Vandromme et al. (31Vandromme M. Cavadore J. Bonnieu A. Froeschle A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4646-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we mutated the basic residues within two regions of MyoD (amino acid regions 110–112 and 130–135) to alanine, as Vandromme et al. report that deletion of both of these regions is necessary to prevent nuclear localization of MyoD. However, as seen in Fig. 3, substitution mutagenesis yielded distinctly different results. Mutagenesis of K102A, R103A, K104A, R110A, R111A, and K112A (MyoDNLS1) was sufficient to markedly inhibit nuclear import, whereas mutagenesis of K133A and R134A (MyoDNLS2) did not affect subcellular localization. Given these results, the entire amino acid sequence of MyoD was evaluated for additional basic residue-containing regions which may serve as NLS. Mutation of R117A, R119A, R120A, R121A, and K124A (MyoDNLS3) proved to be an additional NLS (Fig. 3). This same region was examined by Vandromme et al. (31Vandromme M. Cavadore J. Bonnieu A. Froeschle A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4646-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) using deletion mutagenesis and was found not to serve as an NLS. Inhibition of nuclear import of MyoDNLS3 (79% cytoplasmic) was comparable with that seen with MyoDNLS1 (83% cytoplasmic). Furthermore, mutation of both NLS1 and NLS3 (MyoDNLS1+3) did not inhibit import substantially more (i.e. ∼87% cytoplasmic) than that observed with the single mutation. Therefore it is likely that NLS1 and NLS3 represent subdomains of a single large targeting sequence (amino acid region 102–124) within MyoD. Evaluation of three additional regions in MyoD (R143A, K146A, and R151A; R220A and R221A; R235A, R238A, and K241A) failed to reveal any additional NLS.Figure 3Localization andt 12 of MyoD NLS mutants. Basic amino acids of putative NLS sequences in MyoD were mutated to alanines, and the effect on nuclear localization was determined by immunofluorescence. A total of six regions were mutated; MyoDNLS1 (amino acid region 102–112) and MyoDNLS3 (amino acid region 117–124) were found to be 83 and 79% in the cytoplasm, respectively. MyoDNLS1+NLS3 was found to be 87% cytoplasmic. MyoDNLS2 was 18% cytoplasmic. The rates of degradation of wild-type MyoD and its NLS mutants are described above, with the rate of MyoDNLS1+3not determined (ND).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The rates of degradation of several of these NLS mutants were examined. The t 12 of wild-type MyoD and MyoDNLS2, both of which localized to the nucleus (96 and 92% nuclear, respectively), were each found to be 0.8 ± 0.1 h. However, the t 12 of MyoDNLS1, MyoDNLS3, and MyoDNLS1+2, each of which localized predominately to the cytoplasm (83, 79, and 79% cytoplasmic, respectively), were found to be 1.3 ± 0.3, 1.2 ± 0.1, and 1.2 ± 0.2 h, respectively. Thus, it appears that the rate of MyoD degradation correlates with its subcellular localization, in that nuclear localization is associated with more rapid degradation.The NLS1 mutation identified above did not result in complete absence of MyoD from the nucleus. It may be that MyoD undergoes nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and that the mutagenesis of NLS1 causes MyoD to enter the nucleus more slowly than wild-type MyoD, or it may be that the rate at which MyoD exits the nucleus is accelerated when NLS1 is mutated. To test if MyoDNLS1 undergoes nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, 16–24 h after transfection of HeLa cells with MyoDNLS1, LMB was added, and MyoD localization was visualized via immunofluorescence. As seen in Fig. 4, incubation with LMB led to a dramatic accumulation of MyoDNLS1 within the nucleus (17–93% nuclear). This suggests that the MyoDNLS1 mutant cycles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, although it does not indicate whether MyoDNLS1 is entering the nucleus more slowly or exiting the nucleus more quickly than wild-type MyoD. Localization of this mutant to the nucleus in the presence of LMB was associated with a decrease in the half-life of MyoDNLS1(t 12 = 1.0 ± 0.1 h) compared with that seen in the absence of LMB (1.3 ± 0.3 h; Fig. 4).Figure 4Effect of LMB on MyoDNLS1.HeLa cells, transfected with MyoDNLS1, were treated 16–24 h after transfection with LMB for 2 h. LMB treatment led to 93% nuclear accumulation of the protein and to a slight decrease in the t 12 of MyoDNLS1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ability of MyoD to cycle in and out of the nucleus suggests either the presence of an intrinsic NES or of association with a chaperone (32Ossareh-Nazari B. Gwizdek C. Dargemont C. Traffic. 2001; 2: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that supports MyoD nuclear export. Typically, NES are regions high in leucine content.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1839-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), suggested a candidate NES within the N terminus region of MyoD. Thus, using the MyoDNLS1 mutant as a template, Leu-3, Leu-4, Leu-8, Ile-11, and Leu-13 were mutated to alanines (MyoDNLS1NES), and the construct was transfected into HeLa cells. A marked increase in nuclear localization of MyoD (17–42% nuclear) was observed (Fig. 5) consistent with the notion that amino acid sequence 3–13 contains a nuclear export signal. Two other regions high in leucine content were mutated on the MyoDNLS1 background (L268A, L269A, and L270A; L248A, L251A, and I254A) to identify other potential NES within MyoD; however, no others were identified.Figure 5Localization andt 12 of MyoD NES mutants. Leucines (or isoleucines) in possible NES regions were mutated to alanines on MyoDNLS1, and their localization in HeLa cells was visualized by immunofluorescence. A total of four regions were mutated. MyoDNLS1NES was found to be 42% in the nucleus. The half-life of the MyoDNLS1NES was 1.2 ± 0.2 h.

As expected, MyoDNES localized exclusively to the nucleus (100% nuclear) (Fig. 6). The half-life of MyoDNES(t 12 = 1.05 ± 0.04 h) decreased compared with that seen for MyoDNLS1 (t 12 = 1.3 ± 0.3 h) and slightly increased compared with that seen for wild-type MyoD (t 12 = 0.8 ± 0.1 h).Figure 6Localization andt 12 of wild-type MyoD and its NLS and NES mutants.

The t 12 of MyoDNLS1 was 1.3 ± 0.3 h, whereas thet 12 of MyoDNES was 1.05 ± 0.04 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Having identified the major NLS and NES signals in MyoD, we next sought to determine which degradation pathway (N terminus-dependent or lysine-dependent) predominates in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. To localize the various mutants to the cytoplasm or the nucleus, we prepared NLS1 or NES mutations on N-terminal-blocked MyoD and lysine-less MyoD.The N-terminal-blocked species of MyoD are degraded via the lysine-dependent pathway. The N-terminal-blocked NLS1 mutant (N-terminal-blocked MyoDNLS1) was degraded with a shorter t 12 (1.6 ± 0.3 h) compared with the N-terminal-blocked wild-type MyoD (2.7 ± 0.6 h), whereas the N-terminal-blocked NES mutant (N-terminal-blocked MyoDNES) was degraded with a t 12(2.8 ± 0.5 h) similar to the N-terminal-blocked wild-type MyoD (Fig. 7 A). As expected, N-terminal-blocked wild-type MyoD and N-terminal-blocked MyoDNES were nuclear, whereas N-terminal-blocked MyoDNLS1 was predominately cytoplasmic. The more rapid degradation of the N-terminal-blocked species localized to the cytoplasm (N-terminal-blocked MyoDNLS1) suggests that the lysine-dependent pathway may be more active for MyoD in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus.Figure 7Localization andt 12 of N-terminal-blocked and lysine-less MyoD mutants and their NLS and NES mutants. The same NLS1 and NES mutations were prepared on N-terminal-blocked and lysine-less MyoD. The constructs were transfected into HeLa cells and were visualized by immunofluorescence. A, N-terminal-blocked MyoDNLS1 was localized 75% to the cytoplasm, and N-terminal-blocked MyoDNES was localized 96% to the nucleus. The t 12 of N-terminal-blocked MyoD and its NLS1 and NES mutants were found to be 2.7 ± 0.6, 1.6 ± 0.3, and 2.8 ± 0.5 h, respectively. B, lysine-less MyoD and lysine-less MyoDNES were 100% nuclear, whereas lysine-less MyoDNLS1 was 40% cytoplasmic. The half-lives of the lysine-less MyoD and its NLS1 and NES mutants were 2.6 ± 0.6, 1.5 ± 0.4, and 5.8 ± 0.9 h, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The lysine-less species of MyoD are degraded via the N terminus-dependent pathway. Whereas lysine-less wild-type MyoD and lysine-less MyoD with the NES mutation (lysine-less MyoDNES) were both nuclear as expected, lysine-less MyoD with the NLS1 mutation (lysine-less MyoDNLS1) was only 40% cytoplasmic. This result is somewhat unexpected because the NLS1 mutation on either the wild-type MyoD or N-terminal-blocked MyoD background yielded species with 83 or 75% cytoplasmic localization, respectively (Figs. 3, 4, and 7 A). Lysine-less MyoDNLS1 had a shorter t 12 (1.5 ± 0.4 h) than lysine-less wild-type MyoD (2.6 ± 0.6 h). Lysine-less MyoDNES was degraded at a substantially slower rate (t 12 = 5.8 ± 0.9 h). The slower degradation of the lysine-less species localized to the nucleus (lysine-less MyoD and lysine-less MyoDNES) suggests that the N terminus-dependent pathway is less active in the nucleus.DISCUSSIONThe ubiquitin-proteasome system exists in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus and is responsible for the degradation of many short-lived cellular proteins. Ubiquitination of the target protein can occur on an ε-amino group of an internal lysine or on the N terminus of the protein tagged for destruction. MyoD, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is ubiquitinated and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the nucleus (11Floyd Z.E. Trausch-Azar J.S. Reinstein E. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22468-22475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of the protein occurs preferentially on the N terminus, leading to N terminus-dependent degradation. Blocking of the N terminus with a 6× Myc tag, via methylation, or through carbamylation of the α-amino group leads to preferential degradation by the lysine-dependent pathway (8Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Using NLS and NES mutants of N-terminal-blocked and lysine-less MyoD, we determined that the lysine-dependent pathway is more active in the cytoplasm, whereas both degradation pathways have equal activity in the nucleus.This determination was based on t 12 calculations of the different N-terminal-blocked and lysine-less mutants, and although the differences in the t 12 may be small, they are likely to be biologically significant because a 2–4-fold change in the half-life of a protein may underlie a significant change in a protein steady-state level and hence in a biological function. It should also be noted that only the subcellular localization andt 12 were assayed and that kinetic determinations of MyoD nucleocytoplasmic shuttling were not evaluated. Furthermore, it is certainly possible, if not likely, that these changes have multiple effects on MyoD, affecting such aspects as DNA binding, acetylation, and/or dimerization. Although the results presented herein are specific to MyoD, future studies will focus on these pathways of cellular localization and degradation and on how the pathways relate to other proteins degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.To determine the ability of the ubiquitin-proteasome system to degrade MyoD in the cytoplasm, the NLS of MyoD was mutated in an attempt to inhibit nuclear localization. NLS are characterized by single or bipartite regions of basic amino acids. In the present study NLS mutants of MyoD were prepared by mutagenesis of clusters of basic amino acids (Lys and Arg) to alanines. Among the six regions evaluated, MyoDNLS1 and MyoDNLS3 were found to significantly reduce nuclear localization of MyoD (17 and 21% nuclear, respectively). Mutation of NLS1 and NLS3 together did not significantly inhibit nuclear import to a greater degree than that seen with either single mutation alone. Therefore, it is likely that MyoD possesses one NLS signal (amino acid region 102–124) and that NLS1 and NLS3 function as subdomains of this sequence. These results differ from those previously reported by Vandromme et al. (31Vandromme M. Cavadore J. Bonnieu A. Froeschle A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4646-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) in which they identify two NLS regions (amino acid regions 100–112 and 130–135) that appear to function independently in that deletion of both regions is required to inhibit nuclear localization of MyoD. We find that substitution mutagenesis of NLS1 (amino acid region 102–112) alone is sufficient to inhibit import and that NLS2 (amino acid region 133–134) is not a nuclear targeting sequence. Furthermore, MyoDNLS1+2 was no more cytoplasmic than MyoDNLS1 alone (Fig. 3).Using MyoDNLS1 as a background, we identified a single NES signal w"
https://openalex.org/W2024102643,"MLN64 is a late endosomal membrane protein containing a carboxyl-terminal cholesterol binding START domain and is presumably involved in intracellular cholesterol transport. In the present study, we have cloned a human cDNA encoding a novel protein that we called MENTHO as an acronym for MLN64 N-terminal domain homologue because this protein is closely related to the amino-terminal half of MLN64. MLN64 and MENTHO share 70% identity and 83% similarity in an original protein domain encompassing 171 amino acids that we designated as the MENTAL (MLN64N-terminal) domain. By translation initiation scanning MENTHO is synthesized as two isoforms of 234 (α) and 227 (β) amino acids that can be phosphorylated. As MLN64, MENTHO is ubiquitously expressed and is located in the membrane of late endosomes, its amino and carboxyl-terminal extremities projecting toward the cytoplasm. We show that MENTHO overexpression does not rescue the Niemann-Pick type C lipid storage phenotype. However, MENTHO overexpression alters severely the endocytic compartment by leading at steady state to the accumulation of enlarged endosomes. These results indicate that in addition to its previously established function in addressing and anchoring proteins to the membrane of late endosomes, the MENTAL domain possesses an intrinsic biological function in endocytic transport. MLN64 is a late endosomal membrane protein containing a carboxyl-terminal cholesterol binding START domain and is presumably involved in intracellular cholesterol transport. In the present study, we have cloned a human cDNA encoding a novel protein that we called MENTHO as an acronym for MLN64 N-terminal domain homologue because this protein is closely related to the amino-terminal half of MLN64. MLN64 and MENTHO share 70% identity and 83% similarity in an original protein domain encompassing 171 amino acids that we designated as the MENTAL (MLN64N-terminal) domain. By translation initiation scanning MENTHO is synthesized as two isoforms of 234 (α) and 227 (β) amino acids that can be phosphorylated. As MLN64, MENTHO is ubiquitously expressed and is located in the membrane of late endosomes, its amino and carboxyl-terminal extremities projecting toward the cytoplasm. We show that MENTHO overexpression does not rescue the Niemann-Pick type C lipid storage phenotype. However, MENTHO overexpression alters severely the endocytic compartment by leading at steady state to the accumulation of enlarged endosomes. These results indicate that in addition to its previously established function in addressing and anchoring proteins to the membrane of late endosomes, the MENTAL domain possesses an intrinsic biological function in endocytic transport. steroidogenic acute regulatory protein StAR-related lipid transfer domain phosphate-buffered saline green fluorescent protein MLN64 N-terminal domain homologue MLN64 N-terminal domain low density lipoprotein Niemann-Pick type C MLN64 cDNA was identified from a breast cancer-derived metastatic lymph node cDNA library by differential hybridization using malignant (metastatic lymph node) versus nonmalignant (breast fibroadenoma and normal lymph node) tissues (1Tomasetto C. Regnier C. Moog-Lutz C. Mattei M.G. Chenard M.P. Lidereau R. Basset P. Rio M.C. Genomics. 1995; 28: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). MLN64 was shown to be amplified and overexpressed in 22.5% of the breast cancer cases tested, suggesting that overexpression of MLN64 could be of clinical relevance for breast cancer development and/or progression (2Bieche I. Tomasetto C. Regnier C.H. Moog-Lutz C. Rio M.C. Lidereau R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3886-3890PubMed Google Scholar,3Kauraniemi P. Barlund M. Monni O. Kallioniemi A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8235-8240PubMed Google Scholar). MLN64 cDNA encodes for a protein of 445 residues, which is composed of two distinct domains: an amino-terminal domain containing four potential transmembrane helices and a carboxyl-terminal StAR1-related lipid transfer (START) domain previously named StAR homology domain (SHD) (4Moog-Lutz C. Tomasetto C. Regnier C.H. Wendling C. Lutz Y. Muller D. Chenard M.P. Basset P. Rio M.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Recently, the three-dimensional structure of the START domain of MLN64 was solved, and its ability to bind cholesterol at an equimolar ratio was reported (5Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). START domains are found in distinct proteins; for most of which their function is still unclear (6Ponting C.P. Aravind L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 130-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). However among them, the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein has a well characterized function. StAR regulates the rate-limiting step of steroidogenesis, which is the transfer of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it is converted into pregnenolone (7Stocco D.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 193-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Unlike StAR, which is therefore a mitochondrial protein, we have shown that MLN64 is located in late endosomes (8Alpy F. Stoeckel M.E. Dierich A. Escola J.M. Wendling C. Chenard M.P. Vanier M.T. Gruenberg J. Tomasetto C. Rio M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4261-4269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This specific localization suggested that MLN64 is a transporter of cholesterol derived from low-density lipoprotein (LDL), a cholesterol-containing particle, which is endocytosed and transported to late endosomes where cholesterol is routed to different organelles (9Simons K. Ikonen E. Science. 2000; 290: 1721-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Among the known molecules involved in this pathway are the products of the causative genes for the Niemann-Pick C disease, NPC1 and NPC2. We have shown that MLN64 was colocalized with NPC1 on late endosomes. However, MLN64 overexpression failed to rescue the NPC phenotype that is characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol-loaded vesicles in patient fibroblasts (8Alpy F. Stoeckel M.E. Dierich A. Escola J.M. Wendling C. Chenard M.P. Vanier M.T. Gruenberg J. Tomasetto C. Rio M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4261-4269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To identify molecules involved in intracellular cholesterol vesicular traffic we have screened for novel MLN64-related protein. Homology searches using the whole human genome sequence data base revealed the presence of a potential protein corresponding to the MLN64 amino-terminal domain only. This part of MLN64 is an original domain since no other protein with such domain was described so far. We have shown that this domain is responsible for the specific localization of MLN64 protein in late endosomes and anchors the protein in the limiting membrane of late endosomes (8Alpy F. Stoeckel M.E. Dierich A. Escola J.M. Wendling C. Chenard M.P. Vanier M.T. Gruenberg J. Tomasetto C. Rio M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4261-4269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The finding of this novel protein suggests that the amino-terminal part of MLN64 could have an intrinsic function. In the present study we have cloned and characterized this novel protein that we have called MENTHO for MLN64 N-terminal domain homologue. Surgical specimens obtained at the Hôpitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg were frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction. The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium/Ham's F12 supplemented with 20 mmHepes, 2 mm glutamine, 10% calf serum, and 1% gentamycin. Transfection of CHO cells was done with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The COS simian kidney, the HeLa human cervix, and HEK293 human embryonic kidney cell lines were provided by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and routinely maintained in our laboratory and cultured as recommended. The human mammary epithelial cells, InfinityTM (hTERT-HME1), was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The NPC2 fibroblast strain was obtained from case 16 in Vanier et al. (10Vanier M.T. Duthel S. Rodriguez-Lafrasse C. Pentchev P. Carstea E.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 118-125PubMed Google Scholar) and transfected with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. Human lipoprotein-deficient serum and human LDL were prepared in the laboratory as described previously (10Vanier M.T. Duthel S. Rodriguez-Lafrasse C. Pentchev P. Carstea E.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 118-125PubMed Google Scholar). A specific cDNA probe for MENTHO was obtained by RT-PCR using the two following synthetic oligonucleotides (forward primer: 5′-ATG AAC CAC CTG CCA GAA GAC-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-TCA TAG TTC TAA AAG TGG TTT-3′) and total RNA extracted from human mammary tumors. Briefly, first strand cDNA synthesis was obtained using the reverse primer and AMV reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). This cDNA template was then amplified by PCR using forward and reverse primers. The amplified 661-bp fragment was used as a probe to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library constructed in the ZAPII vector. Briefly, 500,000 plaque-forming units were plated on LB agar and nylon filter replica (Hybond N; Amersham Biosciences) were hybridized at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× standard saline citrate (SSC), 0.4% Ficoll, 0.4% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 20 mmol/liter sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 0.5% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA for 16 h with the 32P-labeled probe (11Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar) diluted to 0.5–1× 106 cpm/ml. Stringent washes were performed at 60 °C in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. Filters were autoradiographed at −80 °C for 24 h. Positive plaques were subjected to a secondary screening in the same hybridization conditions. Pure plaques were directly recovered as bacterial colonies using the pBluescript/λ-ZAPII in vivo excision system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Six different clones containing the complete open reading frame of MENTHO were isolated. A construct allowing the expression of wild type MENTHO was generated. A 872-bp fragment corresponding to the complete putative open reading frame of MENTHO was amplified by PCR using a MENTHO cDNA comprising plasmid as template and the synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-GAG AGA ATT CAA CTT TAC TGT CGA CAG GGA GAC TCC-3′ and 5′-GAG AGA ATT CAA CTT TAC TGT CGA CAG GGA GAC TCC-3′ incorporatingEcoRI flanking sites. The PCR fragment was then digested byEcoRI and subcloned into the EcoRI site of the expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) thus generating the vector pSG5-MENTHO. Constructs allowing the expression of FLAG-tagged MENTHO protein were also generated. A 733-bp fragment was amplified by PCR using the synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-GAG AGT CGA CTA TGA ACC ACC TGC CAG AAG ACA TGG-3′ and 5′-TCT CGT CGA CGT AGT ACT CAT AGT TCT AAA AGT GG-3′, incorporating in-frame SalI restriction sites. The modified MENTHO cDNA fragment was released by SalI digestion and inserted in-frame behind the FLAG epitope cDNA sequence in the pRK7 vector (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) thus generating pRK7N-MENTHO. Similarly, a 769-bp fragment was amplified by PCR using the synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-GAG AGA ATT CTT CTC TTT AGG GAT GGT GAG GTT GG-3′ and 5′-GAG AGA ATT CGT TCT AAA AGT GGT TTC TCA CTG TC-3′, incorporatingEcoRI restriction sites, was after EcoRI digestion cloned in front of the FLAG cDNA sequence in the pRK5 vector (BD Pharmingen) thus generating the vector pRK5C-MENTHO. A vector construct allowing the expression of the MENTHO-EGFP fusion protein was generated. After PCR amplification using the synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-GAG ACA ATT GTT CTC TTT AGG GAT GGT GAG GTT GG-3′ and 5′-GAG ACA ATT GTA GTT CTA AAA GTG GTT TCT CAC TGT CC-3′, the modified MENTHO cDNA was digested by MunI and cloned in-frame into the EcoRI site of the pEGFP-N2 vector (BD Biosciences, Clontech) behind the EGFP cDNA sequence thus generating the vector pEGFPN-MENTHO. pSG5-MENTHO was used to generate mutated translation initiation sites. The first and second methionine have been mutated into phenylalanine (MENTHO ΔM1) and leucine (MENTHO ΔM8) respectively by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-GTA ACC CTC CTC CAG GTT TAA ACA CCT GCC AGA AGA C-3′ and 5′-CAC CTG CCA GAA GAC CTC GAG AAC GCT CTC ACC-3′, respectively. The Kozak sequence of the first translation initiation site of MENTHO has been mutated into a strong Kozak sequence by site-directed mutagenesis using pSG5-MENTHO as template and the synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-GTA ACC CTC CTC CAG GAT GGA CCA CCT GCC AGA AG-3′ thus generating MENTHO SK. The pSG5 MLN64 expression vector was already described (8Alpy F. Stoeckel M.E. Dierich A. Escola J.M. Wendling C. Chenard M.P. Vanier M.T. Gruenberg J. Tomasetto C. Rio M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4261-4269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). RNAs from cell lines and from surgical specimens were extracted using the single step procedure of Chomczynski and Sacchi (12Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar). RNAs were fractionated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gels (13Lehrach H. Diamond D. Wozney J.M. Boedtker H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4743-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar), transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham Biosciences), and immobilized by baking for 2 h at 80 °C. The rabbit polyclonal 1546 antibody (pAbMENTHO-Ct) was raised against the synthetic peptide AGSEEAEEKQDSEKPLLEL corresponding to residues 216–234 of human MENTHO. The peptide was coupled to ovalbumin through an additional amino-terminal cysteine residue and injected into New Zealand rabbits. Immunoreactive serum was affinity purified against the synthetic peptide coupled to sulfolink-coupling gel (Pierce) using conditions recommended by the manufacturer. HeLa and CHO cells were grown to 70% confluence on glass coverslips. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were fixed 10 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After blocking in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, cells were incubated at room temperature with the primary antibodies, pAbMENTHO-Ct alone or together with anti-MLN64 mAbMLN64-Ct, anti-lgp95 or anti-EEA1 (Mouse IgG1 clone 14, BD Bioscience, Le pont de Claix, France). Cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated 1 h with Alexa Fluor488-conjugated affinity-purified donkey anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and Cy3-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Cells were washed three times in PBS, and in some cases, nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst-33258 dye. Slides were mounted in Aqua Poly/Mount (Poly-sciences Inc., Warrington, PA). Observations were made with a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP1; Heidelberg, Germany) or with a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMLB 30T). Staining of acidic compartments of the cell was performed with Lysotracker Red (Molecular Probes, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Niemann-Pick C2 fibroblasts were grown on glass coverslips to 70% confluence and were transfected with the expression vector pRK7N-MENTHO with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. After transfection, cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum for 24 h and then changed to medium supplemented with 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum and 50 μg/ml human LDL for an additional 24 h of culture. Cells were then processed for immunofluorescence to identify transfected cells with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) as described above except that permeabilization with Triton X-100 was omitted. Staining of free cholesterol was performed after fixation using 50 μg/ml filipin (Sigma) for 30 min. CHO cells, on glass coverslips, were washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum. For endocytosis of antibodies, cells were incubated for 1 h with anti-FLAG M2 antibody 0.4 mg/ml. Anti-FLAG antibodies (4 mg/ml) were microinjected into the cell cytoplasm together with lysine-fixable dextran cascade blue (Molecular Probes, Inc.) with a microinjector (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Microinjections were followed by an incubation of the cells for 1 h in growing medium. Detection of either internalized or microinjected antibodies was performed by incubating fixed cells with the secondary antibody as described above. Plasmid DNAs were sequenced withTaq polymerase and dye-labeled dideoxynucleotide triphosphate for detection on an Applied Biosystems 373A automated sequencer. Searches of nucleotide and protein data bases were performed using the programs from the Wisconsin package, version 9.1 (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Alignments were performed with the Eclustalw program. The Protparam tool program of the Expasy Molecular Biology Server was used to obtain the molecular weight and the pHi of the protein (14Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Putative phosphorylation sites of MENTHO were predicted with the ScanProsite software (15Hofmann K. Bucher P. Falquet L. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). The transmembrane helices were predicted with the TMHMM program (16Sonnhammer E.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1998; 6: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar). The PostScript files from Eclustalw alignment results were generated with the ESPript program (17Gouet P. Courcelle E. Stuart D.I. Metoz F. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). The complete cDNA sequence encoding human MENTHO has been deposited in the GenBankTM/EMBL nucleotide sequence data base under accession number AJ492267. Cultured cells were washed with PBS and homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate). After centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C, the supernatant was conserved. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins were then directly, without boiling step, loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. After migration, proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The membrane was blocked in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and 3% nonfat dried milk and washed and incubated with anti-MENTHO antibody in PBST. After washing, the blot was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Affinipure goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Protein-antibody complexes were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (SuperSignal West Pico; Pierce). For calf intestinal phosphatase treatment, 15 μg of whole cell protein extracts were incubated in presence of 1 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C with 20 units of CIP (Promega, Madison, WI). Similar control protein extracts were incubated in the same conditions without CIP. Searches for MLN64 homologous sequences in the human genome sequence DNA data base identified a human potential cDNA encoding for a protein referenced as AAD15552 (GenBankTM accession no. AC006033). Besides its homology with the amino-terminal half of MLN64, no known protein domain or biological function was proposed for this potential protein. Using this potential cDNA sequence, we designed two 21 bp oligonucleotides as primers to amplify by RT-PCR a 661-bp specific cDNA from human mammary tumor total RNA. This probe was then used to screen a normal human fetal brain cDNA library. The screening of 5 × 105 clones allowed the isolation of 6 different clones whose sequencing allowed us to obtain the complete cDNA sequence corresponding to the putative AAD15552 protein (Fig. 1 A). This cDNA has a size of 1646 bp. A polyadenylation sequence (AATTAAA) is placed 12 bp before the poly(A). Two initiation codons (nucleotides 49–51 and 70–72) are in a favorable context for translation (18Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Therefore, translation at the first or second initiation codon present in the same open reading frame can give rise to two protein isoforms of 234 and 227 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1 A). Protein sequence alignment with MLN64 showed that this protein is highly conserved with the amino-terminal half of MLN64 (Fig. 2, A and C). Based on this result, we named this protein MENTHO as an acronym for MLN64 N-terminal domain homologue. The alignment of the human MLN64 and the human MENTHO showed that both proteins share an overall 75% similarity and 60% identity. The amino-terminal extremity of both proteins (between amino acid 1 and 47 of MENTHO) are divergent, sharing only 17% identity and 38% similarity (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, with the exception of the 17 last amino acids of MENTHO, the rest of the molecule from amino acid 48 to 218 is well conserved with 70% identity and 83% similarity (Fig. 2 A). Within this region, MENTHO sequence analysis predicted the presence of 4 transmembrane helices implicating amino acids 54–74, 94–116, 123–142, and 152–171, respectively (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that, like MLN64, MENTHO is a membrane-associated protein. In addition, the presence of four transmembrane helices implies that the amino and the carboxyl termini of the protein are on the same side of the membrane. The highly conserved region by MLN64 and MENTHO was designated as the MENTAL domain for MLN64 N-terminal domain (Fig. 2 A). At the nucleotide and protein levels, sequence comparison with sequences available in data bases showed that MENTHO is conserved in mammals and fish. Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) from different species including mouse, rat, cow and zebrafish showed at the nucleotide level an average score of 90% homology to the human MENTHO sequence. The murine MENTHO protein sequence (shown in Fig. 2) has been deduced from a compilation and translation of 3 overlapping murine EST sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers: BG084215, BC003334,AA261427). The protein is well conserved since human and mouse MENTHO proteins were shown to have an overall score of 97% identity and 99% similarity. We studied MENTHO expression in different normal, benign, and malignant tumor tissues. MENTHO mRNA was expressed at a basal level in normal tissues (placenta, lung, lymph node, and colon, not shown), in normal breast tissue (Fig. 1 B, lane 1), in normal breast epithelial cells (Fig. 1 B, lane 11) and in NPC2-deficient human fibroblasts. A similar level of expression was detected in benign, malignant and metastatic breast tumors (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2–9). Finally, MENTHO was also expressed at a basal level in colon and brain cancers (Fig. 1 B, lane 10 and not shown). Consistent with this wide tissue distribution, human ESTs corresponding to the MENTHO gene were found in many tissues including bone, brain, breast, heart, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, and ovary. We cloned the cDNA of MENTHO in a vector allowing the expression of the protein under its translation initiation and termination control sequences (pSG5-MENTHO). Protein extracts of COS cells transfected with the pSG5-MENTHO or with the empty vector were analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 3 A). To study the MENTHO protein, we have generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody, named pAbMENTHO-Ct, directed against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal end of MENTHO (residues 216–234). Using pAbMENTHO-Ct antibody, control COS cells transfected with the empty vector showed no signal while in COS cells transfected with pSG5-MENTHO 4 bands of different molecular weights were detected (Fig. 3 A,lanes 2 and 3). As MENTHO possesses two potential favorable initiation codons in the same open reading frame, we tested whether both were functional and whether we could assign some of the distinct immunoreactive bands to a specific isoform. In the pSG5-MENTHO expression vector, the first ATG (methionine 1) and the second ATG (methionine 8) codons were mutated into a phenylalanine and a leucine, respectively, thus generating the mutant proteins MENTHO ΔM1 and MENTHO ΔM8. Synthesis of the mutant proteins in transfected COS cells was tested by Western blot. MENTHO ΔM1 mutation resulted in the synthesis of two immunoreactive bands of low molecular weight (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). Similarly, MENTHO ΔM8 mutation resulted in the synthesis of two immunoreactive bands of high molecular weight (Fig. 3 B,lane 3). These data showed that, in COS cells, the two first initiation codons are functional and that two protein isoforms can be synthesized. These isoforms of 234 and 227 amino acids were named α and β, respectively. In addition, the level of protein translated from both sites is rather similar. We have observed that the resulting protein isoforms appear as doublets indicating the presence of a post-translational modification of both proteins. The first initiation codon of MENTHO is a weak Kozak sequence, the nucleotide in +4 position being an adenine (Fig. 3 C). In contrast the methionine 8 of MENTHO is a strong Kozak sequence. It is likely that the poor recognition of the first initiation codon allows the anchorage of the ribosome onto the second AUG of the mRNA. In order to verify this hypothesis, we have modified the first Kozak motif into a strong Kozak motif by mutating the adenine +4 into a guanine (mutant MENTHO SK). Transfection of MENTHO SK in COS cells resulted in the synthesis of only two immunoreactive bands corresponding to the α isoform (Fig. 3 B, lane 4). A slight increase of the molecular weight of these two forms was observed. In this construct the second amino acid, a glutamine was replaced by an aspartic acid and the modification of the nature of the second amino acid of the protein, which is now an acidic residue can explain the observed increased molecular weight of the α isoform. Indeed, acidic residues in proteins induce a retarded migration that has been attributed to the poor binding of SDS to the acidic region (19Dyrks T. Weidemann A. Multhaup G. Salbaum J.M. Lemaire H.G. Kang J. Muller-Hill B. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the MENTHO cDNA possesses two functional translation initiation sites leading to the synthesis of the MENTHO α (234 amino acids) and MENTHO β (227 amino acids) isoforms. Each isoform appears as several immunoreactive bands suggesting the presence of additional post-translational modifications. The analysis of the protein sequence of MENTHO revealed that it possesses numerous serine that can be phosphorylated by protein kinases (TableI). The treatment with phosphatase of protein extracts of COS cells transfected with an expression vector encoding for wild type MENTHO led to the disappearance of some of the immunoreactive bands on the behalf of others (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). To discriminate between the different isoforms, protein extracts of COS cells expressing the α (MENTHO ΔM8 and MENTHO SK) and β (MENTHO ΔM1) isoforms were dephosphorylated. For each construct, phosphatase treatments of the protein extracts led to the disappearance of the highest molecular weight form and to the intensification of the lowest molecular weight band (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3–8). These data showed that the different immunoreactive bands detected in cell synthesizing either the α or the β isoform correspond to phosphorylated and unphosphorylated proteins.Table IPutative phosphorylation sites of human MENTHO proteinAmino acidPositionProtein kinaseSerine21Protein kinase CSerine96Casein kinase IISerine193Protein kinase CSerine210Casein kinase IISerine227Protein kinase CProtein kinases potentially recognizing these sites are indicated. Open table in a new tab Protein kinases potentially recognizing these sites are indicated. Endogenous MENTHO protein was also detected in non-transfected HEK293 cells. Protein extracts from these cells were analyzed by Western blot using pAbMENTHO-Ct antibody. In these cells two immunoreactive bands were detected. The upper band having a molecular weight corresponding to the α isoform was predominant (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). This protein extract was treated with phosphatase prior to Western blot analysis. Phosphatase treatment led to a complete shift to a lower molecular weight of the two immunoreactive bands (Fig. 4,lanes 9 and 10). These results indicate that HEK293 cells synthesize mostly phosphorylated MENTHO protein. Moreover, despite the presence of a weak consensus Kozak sequence, the MENTHO α form is mostly synthesized in these cells (Fig. 3 A,lane 1 and Fig. 4, lane 9). Finally, MENTHO α and MENTHO β can be phosphorylated. The main isoform synthesized in HEK293 cells is the phosphorylated MENTHO α. The subcellular localization of MENTHO protein was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence experiments using CHO or HeLa cells transiently transfected with MENTHO-expressing vectors. Transfected CHO and HeLa cells showed a punctate cytoplasmic staining using pAbMENTHO-Ct antibody (Fig. 5 A, a andj), whereas no staining could be detected in non-transfected cells (data not shown). CHO cells were co-transfected with MENTHO- and MLN64-expressing vectors. Detection of MENTHO and MLN64 using specific antibodies in transfected cells showed that both signals"
https://openalex.org/W2027767811,"Factor IXa (FIXa) is known to have a binding site for heparin that has not been mapped by a mutagenesis study. By homology modeling based on structural data, we identified eight basic residues in the catalytic domain of FIXa that can potentially bind to heparin. These residues, Lys98, Lys126, Arg165, Arg170, Lys173, Lys230, Arg233, and Lys239(chymotrypsin numbering) were substituted with Ala in separate constructs in Gla-domainless forms. Following activation, it was found that all FIXa derivatives cleaved the chromogenic substrate CBS 31.39 with near normal catalytic efficiencies. Similarly, antithrombin inactivated FIXa derivatives with a similar second-order association rate constant (k 2) in both the absence and presence of pentasaccharide. In the presence of a full-length heparin, however, k 2 values were dramatically impaired with certain mutants. Direct binding studies revealed that the same mutants lost their affinities for binding to heparin-Sepharose. Both kinetic and direct binding data indicated that five basic residues of FIXa in the following order of importance, Arg233 > Arg165 > Lys230 > Lys126 > Arg170 are critical for binding to heparin. Consistent with these results, examination of the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of FIXa indicated that all five basic residues are spatially aligned in a manner optimal for interaction with heparin.

Similarly, antithrombin inactivated FIXa derivatives with a similar second-order association rate constant (k 2) in both the absence and presence of pentasaccharide. In the presence of a full-length heparin, however, k 2 values were dramatically impaired with certain mutants. Direct binding studies revealed that the same mutants lost their affinities for binding to heparin-Sepharose. Both kinetic and direct binding data indicated that five basic residues of FIXa in the following order of importance, Arg233 > Arg165 > Lys230 > Lys126 > Arg170 are critical for binding to heparin. Consistent with these results, examination of the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of FIXa indicated that all five basic residues are spatially aligned in a manner optimal for interaction with heparin. factor IX active factor IX active factor X γ-carboxyglutamic acid Gla-domainless factor IXa, factor IXa from which N-terminal residues 1–46 have been removed by the recombinant DNA methods factor X activating enzyme from Russell's viper venom antithrombin epidermal growth factor Factor IXa (FIXa)1 is a vitamin K-dependent coagulation serine protease, which upon binding to factor VIIIa on membrane surfaces in the presence of Ca2+ forms the intrinsic Xase complex and rapidly activates factor X to factor Xa (FXa) during the blood coagulation process (1Mann K.G.

FIXa plays a key role in hemostasis, and its deficiency is associated with the life-threatening disease hemophilia B (4Yoshitake S. Schach B.G. Foster D.C. Davie E.W. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3736-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The zymogen FIX circulates in plasma as a single-chain glycoprotein with 415 amino acids (4Yoshitake S. Schach B.G. Foster D.C. Davie E.W. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3736-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). It can be converted to a functionally active form by either one of two physiological activators, the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex or factor XIa (1Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 2Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 5Lindquist P.A.

In addition, FIX can also be activated by a specific enzyme from Russell viper venom (RVV-X) (5Lindquist P.A. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1902-1909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage by all three activators at two sites on the activation peptide (Arg145-Ala and Arg180-Val) removes a short peptide, thereby converting the zymogen to an active enzyme consisting of a light and a heavy chain held together by a single disulfide bond. Similar to other vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteases, the N-terminal light chain of FIXa contains the non-catalytic γ-carboxyglutamic (Gla) domain and two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains (6Stenflo J. Blood. 1991; 78: 1637-1651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of FIXa, with a trypsin-like primary specificity pocket, is located on the C-terminal heavy chain of the molecule (7Hopfner K.-P. Lang A. Karcher A. Sichler K. Kopetzki E. Brandstetter H. Huber R. Bode W. Structure. 1999; 7: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The Gla and EGF1 domains of FIXa are involved in the Ca2+-dependent interaction with factor VIIIa on membrane surfaces (6Stenflo J.

Recent mutagenesis data have indicated that the protease domain of FIXa also interacts with factor VIIIa (9Mathur A. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18477-18486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The role of the EGF2 domain in the function of FIXa is not well understood. However, a recent mutagenesis study demonstrated that the EGF2 domain is required for the structural integrity and localization of FIXa to membrane surfaces (10Wilkinson F.H. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5734-5741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The proteolytic activity of FIXa is primarily regulated by antithrombin (AT). Similar to its reaction with other coagulation proteases, AT by itself is a poor inhibitor of FIXa unless it binds to heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (11Damus P.S. Hicks M. Rosenberg R.D. Nature. 1973; 246: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Heparin accelerates the rate of inactivation of coagulation proteases, including thrombin, FXa, and FIXa by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude (12Olson S.T. Björk I. Berliner L.J. Thrombin: Structure and Function. Plenum Press, New York1992: 159-217Crossref Google Scholar). It is well established that full-length heparin accelerates the AT inactivation of thrombin by a template mechanism (13Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this mechanism of inactivation, the polysaccharide binds both to the protease and the serpin to enhance the rate of encounter complex formation (template mechanism). In inactivation of FIXa and FXa, however, the cofactor effect of a full-length heparin at physiologic levels of Ca2+ is mediated by a 200–300-fold enhancement by the heparin-induced conformational activation of the serpin and an additional several hundred-fold enhancement by a template mechanism (13Olson S.T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have been mapped by mutagenesis studies. These residues are shown to be clustered in similar three-dimensional locations in the catalytic domains of both coagulation proteases (21Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar,22Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). This site in thrombin, which is referred to as “anion binding exosite 2” contains 11 basic residues. The structural data indicate that eight of the basic residues of this region are also conserved at the same or similar three-dimensional locations in FIXa (7Hopfner K.-P. Lang A. Karcher A. Sichler K. Kopetzki E. Brandstetter H. Huber R. Bode W. Structure. 1999; 7: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To determine the contribution of each one of these residues to binding of FIXa to heparin, we generated eight separate mutants in which these residues were substituted with Ala. The mutants in the chymotrypsin numbering system (21Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), K98A, K126A, R165A, R170A, K173A, K230A, R233A, and K239A, which correspond to FIX numbering (mature peptide) (4Yoshitake S. Schach B.G. Foster D.C. Davie E.W. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3736-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) K265A, K293A, R333A, R338A, K341A, K390A, R393A, and K409A, were expressed in human 293 cells and purified to homogeneity. Following activation by RVV-X, the properties of the mutant enzymes were characterized with respect to their ability to cleave chromogenic substrates, directly bind heparin, and react with AT in both the absence and presence of full-length heparin or the high affinity pentasaccharide fragment of heparin. Both kinetic and direct binding data indicated that five basic residues, Lys126, Arg165, Arg170, Lys230, and Arg233, are critical for binding to heparin. Structural data suggest that all five residues are spatially aligned adjacent to each other (7Hopfner K.-P. Lang A. Karcher A. Sichler K. Kopetzki E. Brandstetter H. Huber R. Bode W. Structure. 1999; 7: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), thus forming a basic exosite capable of interaction with heparin. The wild type, K98A, K126A, R165A, R170A, K173A, K230A, R233A, and K239A mutants of FIX in Gla-domainless forms (GD-FIX) were constructed by PCR mutagenesis methods as described previously (23Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All FIX derivatives were expressed in the RSV-PL4 universal expression/purification vector system as described (23Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This vector contains the sequence of the transferrin signal peptide for secretion, the sequence of a 12-residue epitope for the Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody HPC4 for purification, and a neomycin gene for G418 selection in mammalian cells (23Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following transfer of vectors into mammalian cells, G418-resistant clones were selected and examined for FIX expression by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the HPC4 monoclonal and a goat polyclonal antibody against human FIX purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). A high expressing clone for each derivative was identified and expanded; 20 liters of cell culture supernatant were collected, concentrated, and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using the HPC4 monoclonal antibody linked to Affi-gel 10 (Bio-Rad) as described (23Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human plasma AT, FIXa, and factor X activating enzyme from RVV-X were purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. Unfractionated heparin (heparin sodium injection, USP, 10,000 units/ml) from beef lung and the active AT-binding pentasaccharide fragment of heparin (fondaparinux sodium) were purchased from Quintiles Clinical Supplies (Mt. Laurel, NJ). Heparin-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, the chromogenic substrate CH3SO2-d-Leu-Gly-Arg-pNA (CBS 31.39) was purchased from Diagnostica Stago (Asnieres, France), and Polybrene was purchased from Sigma. Factor IX derivatives (∼250 μg) in 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl (TBS buffer) containing 5 mm Ca2+ were converted to their activated forms with 25 μg of RVV-X for 3 h at 37 °C as described previously (24Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23807-23814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The activation mixtures were applied on a 1-ml heparin-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 2 ml of the same buffer followed by elution with a step gradient of 0.1–0.5 M NaCl using increments of 10 mm salt. At each step, 1 ml of buffer was used to elute proteins. Twenty-five microliters from each fraction was transferred to a 96-well plate, and the amidolytic activities of the GD-FIXa derivatives toward the cleavage of the chromogenic substrate CBS 31.39 (1 mm final) were monitored at 405 nm at room temperature in a V max kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.02% NaN3, 5 mm CaCl2, and their active site concentrations were determined by titration with a known concentration of AT in the presence of pentasaccharide as described (25Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The steady-state kinetics of hydrolysis of CBS 31.39 (0.04–5 mm) by FIXa derivatives (5–10 nm) were studied in TBS containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 33% ethylene glycol, and 5 mmCa2+. The rate of hydrolysis was measured at 405 nm at room temperature as described above. The apparent K m andk cat values for substrate hydrolysis were calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the catalytic efficiencies were expressed as the ratios ofk cat/K m. The rate of inactivation of FIXa derivatives by AT in both the absence and presence of heparin and the pentasaccharide fragment of heparin was measured under pseudo first-order rate conditions by a discontinuous assay as described previously (20Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the absence of a cofactor, each FIXa derivative (20 nm) was incubated with AT (0.5–1.0 μm) in TBS containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 5 mm CaCl2 for 45–90 min. All reactions were carried out in 50-μl volumes in 96-well polystyrene assay plates at room temperature. In the presence of pentasaccharide, the reaction conditions were the same except that FIXa derivatives were incubated with AT (200 nm) in complex with a saturating concentration of pentasaccharide (1 μm) for 1–5 min. In the presence of full-length heparin, each FIXa derivative (20 nm) was incubated with 200 nm AT in the presence of catalytic levels of heparin (0.6–50 nm) for 10 s to 6 min in the same TBS buffer system. The reactions were stopped by addition of 50 μl of CBS 31.39 (final concentration of 1.0 mm) in TBS containing 1 mg/ml Polybrene. The remaining enzyme activity was measured with a V maxkinetics microplate reader at 405 nm as described above. The observed pseudo first-order rate constants (k obs) were determined by fitting the time-dependent change of the protease activity to a first-order rate equation, and second-order rate constants (k 2) were obtained from the slopes of linear plots of k obs versus the concentrations of AT-heparin complexes as described (16Rezaie A.R. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12083-12090Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The AT-heparin complex concentrations were calculated from the dissociation constant for the AT-heparin interaction and total concentrations of AT and heparin using the quadratic equation (26Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Noting the experimental conditions described above (200 nm AT) and a lowK D for the interaction of heparin with AT (10–20 nm), the calculated concentrations of the AT-heparin complexes were in close proximity to the concentrations of free heparin. The ENZFITTER (R.J. Leatherbarrow, Elsevier, Biosoft) computer program was used to fit data to appropriate equations. All values are the average of at least 3 independent measurements ± S.E. Wild type and the Ala substitution mutants of FIX in Gla-domainless forms were expressed in 293 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Wild type and mutant molecules were separated from the cell culture supernatants by single step immunoaffinity chromatography using the HPC4 monoclonal antibody as described previously (23Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified proteins under non-reducing conditions indicated that the isolated proteins are relatively pure and that they all migrate with similar and expected molecular masses of ∼60 kDa, suggesting that 293 cells properly processed the recombinant proteins (Fig. 1). The rationale for generating the mutants in Gla-domainless forms was to eliminate the possible interference of the anionic Gla domain with heparin binding to FIXa as previously demonstrated for other vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteases, FXa and activated protein C (27Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16824-16827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Gla-domainless forms (EGF1, EGF2, and catalytic domains) of all vitamin K-dependent plasma proteins express well in mammalian cells by our universal expression/purification vector system and are then conveniently purified to homogeneity in a single step by the Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody, HPC4 (23Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This antibody recognizes a 12-residue epitope that is fused to the N-terminal end of the EGF1 domain in the expressed proteins. This modification has not adversely affected the catalytic properties of these enzymes in solution (23Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rezaie A.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21752-21757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As shown below, this appears to be also true for FIXa because both plasma-derived FIXa and recombinant GD-FIXa exhibited essentially identical kinetic properties with respect to amidolytic activity toward the chromogenic substrate CBS 31.39 and reactivity with AT in both the absence and presence of polysaccharides. All GD-FIX derivatives were activated with RVV-X, and their affinity for heparin was evaluated by a NaCl gradient elution of the enzymes from the heparin-Sepharose column as described (28Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The NaCl gradient elution profiles of all GD-FIXa derivatives are shown in Fig. 2. The K98A, K173A, and K239A mutants interacted with the heparin column with normal affinities. This was evidenced by the observation that, similar to wild type GD-FIXa, peak activities for all three mutant enzymes were eluted at a similar NaCl concentration of 0.4 m. However, all other mutants required lower concentrations of salt to be eluted from heparin-Sepharose (Fig. 2). The concentration of NaCl required to elute the peak activity of the other five mutants ranged from K126A (0.26 m) and R165A (0.22 m) to R170A (0.30 m), K230A (0.23 m), and R233A (0.21m). As shown below, the degree of loss of the affinity of mutants for the heparin column correlated well with the extent of impairments in the template effect of a full-length heparin-catalyzed AT inhibition of these mutants. Active peak fractions of GD-FIXa derivatives (Fig. 2) were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed in TBS containing 0.1 m NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2. Purification of activated proteins on the heparin-Sepharose column resulted in separation of high molecular weight contaminants observed with certain GD-FIX derivatives shown in Fig. 1, and thus all of the following experiments were carried out with essentially pure enzymes (data not shown). The active site concentrations of GD-FIXa derivatives were determined by stoichiometric titration with known concentrations of AT in the presence of pentasaccharide. The assay was also calibrated with known concentrations of plasma-derived FIXa. Kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate CBS 31.39 by FIXa derivatives are presented in Table I. FIXa cleaved this chromogenic substrate with a high efficiency in the presence of 33% ethylene glycol. Relative to wild type, similar k cat of substrate hydrolysis was observed with all GD-FIXa derivatives. TheK m value for the K98A mutant was improved 2–3-fold. All other derivatives exhibited K m values of 2.1–3.7 mm, suggesting that the mutagenesis of these basic residues may have no significant adverse effect on the catalytic pocket of FIXa derivatives. This is a reasonable assumption because all mutants are solvent-exposed in the crystal structure of FIXa (7Hopfner K.-P. Lang A. Karcher A. Sichler K. Kopetzki E. Brandstetter H. Huber R. Bode W. Structure. 1999; 7: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and similar results have been observed for the analogous substitution mutants of thrombin and FXa in previous studies (17Sheehan J.P.

Similar to improvement in the amidolytic activity, the reactivity of K98A with AT was improved 2–3-fold in both the absence and presence of cofactors (Table II). Relative to wild type, there were insignificant changes in the reactivity of all other GD-FIXa derivatives with AT in the absence and presence of pentasaccharide (Table II). At physiological levels of Ca2+, both plasma-derived FIXa and GD-FIXa exhibited similar second-order association rate constants (k 2) in reaction with AT in the presence of heparin (Fig. 3 A). However, the cofactor effect of heparin in accelerating the AT inhibition of mutant proteases was impaired to varying degrees. Relative to GD-FIXa, the heparin-catalyzed k 2 values were improved for K98A and minimally affected for the K173A and K239A mutants (TableII). On the other hand, a significant decrease in thek 2 values was observed for all other mutants, ranging from a minimum of an ∼4-fold decrease for R170A to a maximum of ∼27-fold decrease for R233A (Fig. 3 B and Table II).Table IIKinetic constants for the AT inhibition of FIXa derivatives in the absence and presence of heparin and pentasaccharidek 2,uncat (102m−1 s−1)k 2,penta(104m−1s−1)k 2,H (107m−1 s−1)Fold template k 2,H/k 2,pentapFIXa1.8 ± 0.24.3 ± 0.21.3 ± 0.03302 ± 21GD-FIXa1.4 ± 0.18.3 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.07193 ± 13K98A3.9 ± 0.422.0 ± 3.06.1 ± 0.2277 ± 47K126A1.4 ± 0.23.8 ± 0.20.23 ± 0.0161 ± 6R165A1.6 ± 0.43.8 ± 0.40.09 ± 0.00124 ± 3R170A1.8 ± 0.18.2 ± 0.60.37 ± 0.0145 ± 4R173A1.0 ± 0.13.4 ± 0.20.92 ± 0.04271 ± 28K230A0.9 ± 0.32.2 ± 0.20.11 ± 0.00150 ± 5R233A1.2 ± 0.12.8 ± 0.30.06 ± 0.00121 ± 3K239A1.3 ± 0.14.6 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.05217 ± 16The inactivation rates in the absence of the cofactors (k 2,uncat) were determined from the residual activities of the FIXa derivative (20 nm) after incubation at room temperature with AT (0.5–1.0 μm) for 45–90 min in TBS buffer, containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, as described under “Experimental procedures.” The k 2,penta values were determined by the same procedures except that 20 nm enzyme was incubated with 200 nm AT for 1–5 min in the presence of 1 μm pentasaccharide.

Analysis of the kinetic data of Table II suggests that the catalytic effect of heparin in the AT inhibition of FIXa derivatives is mediated through both the conformational activation of the serpin by the pentasaccharide fragment of heparin and a template mechanism mediated through the long chain heparin bridging the two proteins in one complex. Assuming that the active conformer of AT, whether it is activated by heparin or the pentasaccharide fragment of heparin, makes a similar contribution to the rate-accelerating effect of the protease inhibition (13Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it may be possible to estimate the extent of the template effect of a full-length heparin in the reaction. This can be done by dividing the k 2 values in the presence of heparin to the same values in the presence of the pentasaccharide. These values are calculated and presented in the last column of TableII. Analysis of these data suggests that heparin accelerates the AT inhibition of wild type FIXa 200–300-fold through a conformational activation of AT and 200–300-fold through the template mechanism. This is essentially the same result we previously reported for the heparin-catalyzed AT inhibition of Gla-domainless FXa or FXa in the presence of physiological concentrations of Ca2+ (16Rezaie A.R. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12083-12090Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, AT regulates the proteolytic activities of both FIXa and FXa by a similar mechanism. The direct binding and kinetic data both indicated that five basic residues Lys126, Arg165, Arg170, Lys230, and Arg233 constitute a basic exosite in the catalytic domain of FIXa that can bind to heparin. The location and relative orientation of these residues in the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of FIXa are shown in Fig. 4 (7Hopfner K.-P. Lang A. Karcher A. Sichler K. Kopetzki E. Brandstetter H. Huber R. Bode W. Structure. 1999; 7: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The order of importance of these residues for binding heparin is: Arg233 > Arg165 > Lys230 > Lys126 > Arg170. Although these residues are located apart from each other in the linear sequence of FIXa they are, nonetheless, spatially aligned adjacent to each other on the three-dimensional structure of the molecule. Arg233 appears to make the greatest contribution to the binding of FIXa to heparin. This residue, together with Lys230, is located on the C-terminal α-helix of FIXa. Previous studies have indicated that basic residues of the same α-helix in both FXa (Lys236 and Arg240) and thrombin (Arg233, Lys236, and Lys240) are also the most critical residues for binding to heparin (17Sheehan J.P. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1994; 91: 5518-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 19Gan Z.-R., Li, Y. Chen Z. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol.

In these latter two proteases, two basic residues of the 99-loop (Arg93 and Arg97 in thrombin and Arg93 and Lys96 in FXa) are also part of the heparin binding exosites (20Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 30He X., Ye, J. Esmon C.T. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8969-8976Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Indeed, mutation of the single residue Arg93 nearly eliminated all cofactor effect of a full-length heparin in accelerating the AT inhibition of thrombin (30He X., Ye, J. Esmon C.T. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8969-8976Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the case of FIXa, however, the 99-loop has a single basic residue (Lys98) that is not involved in an interaction with heparin. Instead, the basic charge of this residue appears to contribute to the low reactivity of FIXa with AT and its poor catalytic efficiency toward the chromogenic substrate CBS 31.39. This is derived from the observation that the kinetic properties of the K98A mutant are improved at least 2–3-fold in all reactions studied. In agreement with these results, a previous study showed that exchanging several residues of the 99-loop (encompassing Lys98) between FIXa and FXa switches the specificity of these enzymes (31Hopfner K.-P. Brandstetter H. Karcher A. Kopetzki E. Huber R. Engh R.A. Bode W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6626-6635Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This was judged by an improvement in the catalytic activity of FIXa but impairment in the activity of the homologous FXa mutant (31Hopfner K.-P. Brandstetter H. Karcher A. Kopetzki E. Huber R. Engh R.A. Bode W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6626-6635Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Results of the current study suggest that Lys98 may have been a key contributor to specificity changes of the 99-loop swap mutants of FIXa and FXa in that previous study. Arg165 and Arg170, the other two residues of FIXa critical for binding to heparin, are located on the 162–170-helix. The homologous residues in FXa (Arg165 and Lys169) also bind to heparin (20Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Previous mutagenesis studies have indicated that Arg165 plays a key role in the cofactor-dependent interactions of FIXa (9Mathur A. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18477-18486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and FXa (20Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) with their natural substrates. Thus, mutation of this residue in FIXa dramatically impaired the factor VIIIa-dependent activation of factor X in the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade (9Mathur A. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18477-18486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Similarly, the analogous mutant of FXa (and also Lys169) exhibited a severe catalytic defect during prothrombin activation in the presence of factor Va in the prothrombinase complex (20Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It appears, therefore, basic residues of the 162-loop in both FIXa and FXa can bind to heparin as well as their specific cofactors and/or substrates in the activation complexes. However, relative to interaction of FXa with heparin, we predict that residues of the 162-loop of FIXa would make a greater contribution to the binding energy of the interaction because both mutants of FIXa bound more weakly to heparin-Sepharose than the analogous mutants of FXa. This was evidenced by their elution from the heparin column at lower ionic strengths. Thus, in contrast to NaCl concentrations of 0.22m (Arg165) and 0.30 m(Arg170), which were required to elute the FIXa mutants in the current study (Fig. 2), a higher salt concentration of 0.35m was required in a previous study to elute the mutants of FXa from the same type of heparin column (20Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It should be noted that wild type Gla-domainless forms of both proteases were eluted at ∼0.4m NaCl, suggesting that they have similar affinities for heparin (20Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It is known that in the purified system therapeutic doses of heparin can directly inhibit factor X activation by the intrinsic Xase complex independent of AT but have no effect on the activation of prothrombin by the prothrombinase complex (32Barrow R.T. Parker E.T. Krishnaswamy S. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26796-26800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which heparin differentially affects properties of these two homologous procoagulant activation complexes is not known. The results presented above suggest that the binding of heparin to the 162-loop of FIXa may interfere with the assembly of the intrinsic Xase complex. However, because heparin has a lower affinity for the 162-loop of FXa, it may not efficiently compete with factor Va/prothrombin for binding to this site of the protease and thus is unable to directly inhibit the prothrombinase complex. In support of this hypothesis, a recent study demonstrated that a hypersulfated heparin, which has an improved affinity for interaction with these proteases, is effective in directly inhibiting both the intrinsic and prothrombinase complexes independent of membrane surfaces (33Anderson J.A.M. Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Guo Y.S. Hirsh J. Ghazarossian V. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9755-9761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These results can best be described by a model in which hypersulfated heparin disrupts the assembly of activation complexes by competing with specific cofactors and/or substrates of FIXa and FXa for binding to the 162-loop of these procoagulant proteases.

We previously reported, using a new phage display strategy based on designed combinatorial V gene libraries, the humanization of mouse monoclonal antibody LM609 directed to human integrin alpha(v)beta3. In the present study, we describe the in vitro affinity maturation of humanized LM609 by using a phage display strategy for the sequential and parallel optimization of three complementarity determining regions of the antibody molecule. The evolved Fab had an affinity of 150 pM and was converted into IgG1 by use of a new mammalian expression vector. The resulting whole antibody, designated JC-7U IgG1, was found to selectively target human KS in a nude mouse model and inhibit tumor growth at a therapeutically relevant dose. Because of its high affinity and its high degree of humanization, JC-7U IgG1 is an excellent drug candidate for therapeutic applications that involve integrin alpha(v)beta3 as the molecular target. Of particular interest is therapy for KS, breast cancer, melanoma, and other cancers in which integrin alpha(v)beta3 is expressed on both angiogenic endothelial cells and tumor cells, which would allow a dual antiangiogenic and antitumor strike with a single drug."

It is estimated that at least 35% of human genes are alternatively spliced, although this is based on conservative estimates and it may be that alternative splicing is more the rule than the exception in the post-transcriptional processing of pre-mRNA transcripts (6Graveley B.R.

Studies of the mechanisms employed by mammalian cells to differentially regulate splicing indicate that the selection of splice sites is influenced by proteins that bind to non-splice site RNAcis-elements and recruit or block spliceosome assembly. Such RNA cis-elements include exonic and intronic splicing enhancers (ESEs 1The abbreviations used are: ESE, exonic splicing enhancer; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; ESS, exonic splicing silencer, ISE, intronic splicing enhancer; ISS, intronic splicing silencer; ISAR, intronic splicing activator and repressor; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; PTB, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein; UTR, untranslated region; nt, nucleotide or ISEs) as well as exonic and intronic splicing silencers (ESSs or ISSs) that enhance or block splicing to neighboring splice sites. A number of ubiquitous RNA-binding proteins have been demonstrated to alter alternative splice site choice. Examples include the SR proteins (8Ge H. Manley J.L.

While most proteins demonstrated to modulate splicing of mammalian transcripts are not differentially expressed, several mammalian tissue-specific RNA-binding proteins that function as splicing regulators have recently emerged (30Jensen K.B.

Alternatively spliced mammalian transcripts generally contain several cis-elements in introns and exons with positive or negative functions (enhancers and silencers) that modulate splicing. Such observations have led to models of combinatorial control, whereby regulation of alternatively spliced mammalian transcripts is achieved through the net influence of several proteins that bind to different cis-elements flanking regulated splice sites (1Black D.L. Cell. 2000; 103: 367-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 5Smith C.W. Valcarcel J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). While some of the regulatory proteins implicated in splicing regulation are ubiquitously expressed, it appears that cell-type specific regulatory factors may often tip the balance in favor of specific splicing patterns in cells that express them. A functionally relevant example of alternative splicing involves the mutually exclusive splicing of exons IIIb and IIIc of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). Inclusion of the 148-nt IIIb exon or the 145-nt IIIc exon in the region encoding the second half of the third extracellular ligand binding domain results in either FGFR2-IIIb or FGFR2-IIIc, respectively (Fig. 1). For a given cell type the splicing pattern is exclusive and only one of the isoforms is expressed (34Yan G. Fukabori Y. McBride G. Nikolaropolous S. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4513-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar,35Miki T. Fleming T.P. Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Ron D. Aaronson S.A.

Although both receptors bind FGF-1 with equivalent affinity, they otherwise display distinct and exclusive differences in binding to most other FGFs thus far characterized (36Ornitz D.M. Xu J.

McKeehan W.L. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2205-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A nearly identical sequence in human transcripts termed IAS3 displays the same splicing regulatory activities (43Del Gatto F. Plet A. Gesnel M.C. Fort C. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5106-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 45Le Guiner C. Plet A. Galiana D. Gesnel M.C. Del Gatto-Konczak F. Breathnach R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43677-43687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The function of IAS3 was proposed to involve formation of an RNA secondary structure with another element upstream in the same intron termed IAS2 (43Del Gatto F. Plet A. Gesnel M.C. Fort C. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5106-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A rat sequence that is identical to IAS2 is likewise predicted to form a secondary structure with ISAR and evidence has been put forth that suggests this secondary structure also is involved in splicing regulation of rat transcripts (46Jones R.B. Carstens R.P. Luo Y. McKeehan W.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3557-3565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although this rat element has previously been referred to as rIAS-2, we will henceforth refer to the element as ISE-2 to conform with a convention using “ISE” to refer to intronic sequences that positively regulate splicing. The ability of ISE-2 and/or ISAR to regulate FGFR2 splicing has thus far only been demonstrated in cells that express FGFR2-IIIb. It is therefore of great interest to identify proteins that interact with these elements as they may include proteins that are exclusively expressed in cell types that splice exon IIIb. Given data that suggest that these elements function through formation of an RNA secondary structure, it is important to perform a systematic analysis of the precise sequence and structural requirements of these elements that are required for their ability to regulate splicing. In this study, we make use of cell lines, DT3 and AT3, that have previously been used to study FGFR2 splicing regulation (26Carstens R.P. Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell.

DT3 cells exclusively express FGFR2-IIIb and AT3 cells express FGFR2-IIIc and transfected minigenes that recapitulate the splicing pattern of the endogenous FGFR2 gene transcript have been described (40Carstens R.P. McKeehan W.L. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2205-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We performed a comparative sequence analysis of elements that are related to ISE-2 and ISAR. We found that these intronic sequences are highly conserved among vertebrates. Furthermore, we found related sequences in the corresponding intron of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). The predicted secondary structures by these related sequences form 17–21-nt base-paired stems containing short internal loops or bulges. In the case of rat FGFR2 ISE-2 and ISAR elements, we found that deletion of sequences that form a bulge in a predicted 18-nt stem does not impair the function of these elements in FGFR2 splicing regulation. We then determined the effect of replacing each element with unrelated sequences that would also form a complementary stem. Surprisingly, we found that these unrelated sequences were equally capable of mediating cell-type-specific splicing regulation of exons IIIb and IIIc. Thus, we conclude that the sequences of ISE-2 and ISAR themselves are not required for the function of these elements. Rather, the function of these elements can be recapitulated by any RNA sequences that form related RNA secondary structures. Thus, a non-sequence-specific RNA secondary structure constitutes the functional element that mediates splicing regulation by ISE-2 and ISAR. All plasmids and minigene constructs employed standard cloning techniques as previously described (40Carstens R.P. McKeehan W.L. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2205-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The pI-11-FS and pI-11-NC-W/W37 (the latter previously denoted as pI-11-FS-NC-SAR-20) splicing constructs were obtained as previously described (40Carstens R.P. McKeehan W.L. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2205-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). pI-11-pPANC-W/W37 was created as a modification of pI-11-NC-W/W37 by inserting a PacI restriction site directly 5′ to the identified ISE-2 region (5′- ACACCCGTAAAAAGGTACAA-3′) and AscI and BspEI sites were inserted immediately 3′ of this ISE-2 region. By convention all minigenes derived from pI-11-PANC are described with a suffix in which sequences in the position of ISE-2 precede sequences in the position of ISAR, separated by a hash mark. Sequences inserted in these positions are as summarized in Fig. 3 A. Thus, minigenes in which ISAR is modified (pI-11-PANC: W/M2, W/M3, W/B37, W/G19, W/B19, W/W19, and W/WS) were achieved by deleting the 37-nucleotide sequence containing ISAR (W37 or SAR-20) from pI-11-pPANC-W/W37 with NotI andClaI and inserting annealed oligonucleotides with complementary NotI and ClaI sites, as represented by the following oligonucleotide pairs: M2: Mut2-F, 5′-GGCCGCCAAAGAGAACGGACTCTGTGGGCTGAAAGATCCATGTAT-3′and Mut2-R, 3′-CGATACATGGATCTTTCAGCCCACAGAGTCCGTTCTCTTTGGC-3′; M3: Mut3-F, 5′-GGCCGCCAAAGAGAACGGACTCTGTGGGCTGATTTTTCACGCTAT-3′ and Mut3-R, 5′-CGATAGCGTGAAAAATCAGCCCACAGAGTCCGTTCTCTTTTGGC-3′; B37: Blu-F, 5′-GGCCGCAACTGGTGGCCTAACTACGGCTACACTAGAAGGACACAT-3′and Blu-R, 5′-CGATGTGTCCTTCTAGTGTAGCCGTAGTTAGGCCACCACTTGC-3′; G19: Globin-F, 5′-GGCCGCACCTATGTCTCCACATGCCAT-3′ and Globin-R, 5′-CGATGGCATGTGGAGACATAGGTGC-3′; B19: Blue19-F, 5′-GGCCGCCCGTATCGTAGTTATCTACAT-3′and Blue19-R, 5′-CGATGTAGATAACTACGATACGGGC-3′; W19: SAR-38-F, 5′-GGCCGCTGTGGGCATTTTTCCATGTAT-3′and SAR-38-R, 5′-CGATACATGGAAAAATGCCCACAGC-3′; WS-F, 5′-GGCCGCCCATGGAAAAATGCCCACAAAT-3′and W'-R, 5′-CGATGTGTGGGCATTTTTCCATGGGC-3′. The ISE-2 mutant constructs (pI-11-pPANC: M2′/W37, M3′/W37, B37′/W37, G19′/W37, B19′/W37, and W37S/W37) were created by deleting ISE-2 from pI-11-pPANC-W/W37 withPacI and AscI and inserting annealed oligonucleotides with complementary PacI and AscI sites, as represented by the following oligonucleotide pairs: M2′: M2′-F, 5′-TAACCATGGATCTTTGCCCACAAGG-3′ and M2′-R, 5′-CGCGCCTTGTTGGCAAAGATCCATGGTTAAT-3′; M3′: M3′-F, 5′-TAACGCGTGAAAAATGCCCACAAGG-3′and M3′-R, 5′-CGCGCCTTGTGGGCATTTTTCACGCGTTAAT-3′; B37′: IS-BLU-F, 5′-TAAGTGTCCTTCTAGTGTAGCCGTAGTTAGGCCACCACTTGG-3′ and IS-BLU-R, 5′-CGCGCCAAGTGGTGGCCTAACTACGGCTACACTAGAAGGACACTTAAT-3′; G19′: Globin'-F, 5′-TAAGGCATGTGGAGACATAGGTGGG-3′and Globin'-R, 5′-CGCGCCCACCTATGTCTCCACATGCCTTAAT-3′; B19′: BLU19′-F, 5′-TAATGTAGATAACTACGATACGGGG-3′and BLU19′-R, 5′-CGCGCCCCGTATCGTAGTTATCTACATTAAT-3′; W37S: W37′-F, 5′-TAACTGTGGGCTGATTTTTCCATGTGG-3′and W37′-R, 5′-CGCGCCACATGGAAAAATCAGCCCACAGTTAAT-3′. Plasmids pI-11-pPANC: M2′/M2, M3′/M3, B37′/B37, G19′/G19, B19′/B19, and W37S/WS were generated by deleting wild type ISE-2 (W) from pI-11-pPANC: W/M3, W/M4, W/B37, W/G19, W/B19, and W/WS with PacI and AscI and inserting, respectively, annealed oligonucleotides corresponding to M2′, M3′, B37′, G19′,B19′, and W37S as described above. Minigene pI-11-PANC-del-AN (13Chou M.Y. Rooke N. Turck C.W. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) was generated by digesting pI-11-PANC-W/W37 withAscI and NotI to delete sequences between these sites in intron 8, followed by gel purification, blunting of the digested ends with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), and religation using methods previously described (40Carstens R.P. McKeehan W.L. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2205-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Minigene pI-11-PANC-del-AN (17Ashiya M. Zhang L. Grabowski P.J. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1995; 33: 215-216PubMed Google Scholar) was generated by digesting pI-11-PANC-W/W37 withAscI and NotI to delete sequences between these sites in intron 8 and replacing with the following annealed oligos: FGFR2-AN-F, 5′-CGCGCCGC-3′ and FGFR2-AN-R, 5′-GGCCGCGG-3′. All plasmid minigene constructs were prepared with Qiagen plasmid maxi kits. Sequences of all the minigenes were confirmed by sequence analysis using the University of Pennsylvania sequencing facility. Complete human and mouse genomic sequence data corresponding to the intron between exons IIIb and IIIc of FGFR1 and FGFR2 was obtained from public sequencing projects through the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The same sequences from rat and frog (Xenopus laevis) were obtained using long distance PCR with primers corresponding to exons IIIb and IIIc from each species, cloning into PCR-Blunt-Zero (Invitrogen), and sequencing. Identification of conserved intronic sequences was carried out using multiple alignment comparisons (Megalign; DNASTAR) and by visual inspection. AT3 and DT3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (LTI). Transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's recommendations. Selection was performed using Geneticin (Invitrogen) at an active concentration of 400–500 μg/ml until isolated colonies were obtained, and no cells remained from a control transfection with a plasmid lacking neomycin resistance. Pooled colonies were then harvested for RNA preparation. Total cellular RNA and RT-PCR was performed as previously described with several exceptions described below (40Carstens R.P. McKeehan W.L. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2205-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Primers PI-11(-H3)-F (5′-GCTGGAATTCGAGCTCACTCTCTTC-3′) and PIP11-R (5′-CCCGGGACTAGTAAGCTTAGGCTCTTGGCGTT-3′) were used for analysis of the transfected minigenes and were complementary to sequences in the upstream and downstream adenoviral exons contained in all minigenes. PCR amplifications were performed using conditions previously described but with cycles consisting of initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 25–30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55° for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. After completion of the final cycle, there was a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. In all PCR reactions, a water and −RT control were included and were negative in all presented data. The PCR products were digested with either AvaI or HincII (New England Biolabs) restriction endonucleases. Aliquots representing equal amounts of each digested or undigested PCR reaction mixtures were directly loaded on non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed at 110 V for 3–4 h, followed by drying and autoradiography (Amersham Biosciences Hyperfilm-MP). Quantification of data was performed with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Because equal amounts of AvaI- and HincII-digested PCR products were loaded onto each gel, quantification of cDNAs containing exon IIIB (UBD or UCD, respectively, where U and D are the 5′ and 3′ exons of pI-11) was obtained by using the quantification of the band at 286 bp, which remained following HincII digestion as the numerator. The denominator consisted of the sum of both bands (286 and 283) that remained following AvaI andHincII digestion (UBD + UCD). When these results were also expressed with the contribution of products with IIIB and IIIC skipped, the average value of the 138-bp band was also used in the sum of the denominator (UBD + UCD + UD), corrected for molar equivalents. Previous studies of rat and human FGFR2 splicing regulation have implicated several RNA cis-elements that are required for appropriate cell type-specific splicing of exons IIIb and IIIc (Fig.1). Within the intron between these two alternative exons, intron 8, the previously described ISAR in rat transcripts or IAS3 in human transcripts, is required for exon IIIb inclusion in cells that express FGFR2-IIIb (40Carstens R.P. McKeehan W.L. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2205-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 43Del Gatto F. Plet A. Gesnel M.C. Fort C. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5106-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We currently use ISAR to refer to a 20-nucleotide element located from 945 to 964-nt downstream of exon IIIb, which corresponds to the approximate location of IAS3 in human FGFR2. The human IAS2 is located over 700-nt upstream of IAS3 (43Del Gatto F. Plet A. Gesnel M.C. Fort C. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5106-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The rat ISE-2 sequence is located in the same approximate location as IAS2 in intron 8 (191–208-nt downstream of exon IIIb) (40Carstens R.P. McKeehan W.L. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2205-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,46Jones R.B. Carstens R.P. Luo Y. McKeehan W.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3557-3565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted secondary structure formed by ISE-2 and ISAR as well as the related structure from the homologous human elements is shown in Fig. 2 B. It is noteworthy that the ISE-2 and ISAR are separated by 736 nt suggesting that a loop of this size separates a putative stem formed between these elements (775 nt in human transcripts). ISE-1 and ISE-3 are also required for efficient exon IIIb splicing in DT3 cells. In order to further investigate the hypothesis that ISE-2 and ISAR function through formation of an RNA stem structure, we also obtained sequence from the same FGFR2 intron from mouse (Mus musculus) and frog (X. laevis) and identified highly similar sequences that correspond to these two elements. These sequences are aligned in Fig. 2 A and it can be seen that these intronic elements are highly conserved at the sequence level. For each organism the ability of the ISE-2 and ISAR element to form related secondary structures was determined using the Mfold version 3.1 program (48Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3232) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the human, mouse, and rat sequences predict a highly similar stem structure with slightly variant internal loops or bulges. The frog sequences displayed the greatest difference with the rat sequences of the ISE-2 and ISAR elements, yet when secondary structure was determined, they nonetheless also formed a similar secondary structure that, like the other sequences, consisted of two interrupted stems. Of note, the most highly similar structures were those of rat and mouse, which consisted of 18 Watson-Crick base-paired bases with a 2-nucleotide bulge. The only two bases that differed between rat and mouse ISE-2 or ISAR were the two nucleotides that comprised the non-base-paired bulge in each element. This observation, together with the more divergent internal loops contained within the human and frog secondary structures suggested that sequences and/or structures of these non-base-paired residues are not critical for their function. Alternative splicing of exons that represent homologues of exons IIIb and IIIc has been observed for FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3. The two members of the group with the highest level of sequence and genomic structural similarity are FGFR1 and FGFR2 (49Zhang Y. Gorry M.C. Post J.C. Ehrlich G.D. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 230: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, the exon and intron sizes in the genomic region that encodes exons IIIb, IIIc, and the constitutive upstream and downstream exons are highly similar. Alternative splicing of FGF-R1 IIIb and IIIc exons is highly regulated and cell types with exclusive expression of FGF-R1 (IIIb) have been described (50Beer H.D. Vindevoghel L. Gait M.J. Revest J.M. Duan D.R. Mason I. Dickson C. Werner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16091-16097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). FGFR1 and FGFR2 most likely arose from a gene duplication event of a single common ancestral gene that followed a previous exon duplication that gave rise to alternative exons IIIb and IIIc. We thus speculated that sequence elements that direct splicing regulation of FGFR1 exons IIIb and IIIc may be conserved between these gene paralogues. Sequence analysis of the intron between FGFR1 exons IIIb and IIIc from human, mouse, rat, and frog DNA revealed the presence of sequence elements highly similar to ISE-2 and ISAR in the same approximate locations within the intron (Fig. 2 A). Thus, for example, the rat intron separating exons IIIb and IIIc of FGFR1 is 1004 nt (compared with 1200 for FGFR2) and homologues to ISE-2 and ISAR are positioned between 126–143 and 696–717 downstream of exon IIIb, respectively. We used Mfold to determine whether these elements could also form similar secondary structures. As shown in Fig. 2 C, secondary structures that were similar to those formed with the FGFR2 elements were predicted. Thus, for example, the rat element contained a base-paired region at the base of the stem that was identical to that of FGFR2, whereas sequences that were not identical to the FGFR2 ISE-2 and ISAR elements nonetheless predicted a different base-paired region with an intervening small internal loop. In the case of the human structure, two additional small bulges were predicted in the top of the secondary structure that would be predicted to disrupt stem formation in this region, yet the extent of base pairing could be further extended to yield a total of 21 base-paired residues compared with 19 for the frog structure and 17 for the mouse and rat structures. Thus, in general, these phylogenetic comparisons were consistent with a hypothesis that ISE-2 and ISAR elements regulate splicing through formation of a secondary structure that arises through base pairing interactions between these elements. Furthermore, these results suggest that the sequences and/or structures that comprise these elements have been maintained through a long evolutionary history. In order to further investigate the sequences and/or structures of ISE-2 and ISAR that are required for splicing regulation we further modified a minigene, pI-11-FS, that was previously shown to recapitulate the splicing pattern of endogenous FGFR2 when stably transfected into AT3 and DT3 cells (40Carstens R.P. McKeehan W.L. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2205-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These minigenes contain a 1804 nt region of FGFR2 that includes exons IIIb and IIIc as well as flanking intron sequences upstream of exon IIIb, downstream"

However, the molecular mechanisms by which FGFs exert their effects on the lens remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that FGF-2 repressed the expression of lens-specific genes at the proliferative phase in primary cultured lens cells. Using transfected cells, we also found that the activity of L-Maf, a lens differentiation factor, is repressed by FGF/ERK signaling. L-Maf is shown to be phosphorylated by ERK, and introduction of mutations into the ERK target sites on L-Maf promotes its stabilization. The stable L-Maf mutant protein promotes the differentiation of lens cells from neural retina cells. Taken together, these results indicate that FGF/ERK signaling negatively regulates the function of L-Maf in proliferative lens cells and that stabilization of the L-Maf protein is important for lens fiber differentiation.

The anterior surface of the lens is covered by a simple epithelium, whereas the remainder and bulk of the lens is composed of elongated lens fibers (1McAvoy J.W. Chamberlain C.G. de Iongh R.U. Hales A.M. Lovicu F.J. Eye. 1999; 13: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). During embryonic development and throughout the life of the organism, fiber cells are added via differentiation of the lens epithelial cells. The proliferative epithelial cells in the anterior germinative zone move across the lens equator to the posterior transitional zone followed by withdrawal of cell cycling and differentiation into fiber cells. Fiber cell differentiation is characterized by cell elongation and the eventual degradation of all cellular organelles including the nucleus. These morphological changes are accompanied by specific activation of crystallin proteins as well as intermediate filament components such as filensin and CP49 (reviewed in Ref. 2Graw J. Dev. Genet. 1996; 18: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Molecular genetic approaches have also recently identified a number of signaling molecules and transcription factors that are critical for lens development. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs)1 regulate a diverse range of biological activities including adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 3Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). FGF signaling is one of the most important regulators of differentiation from lens epithelial cells into fiber cells. Using lens explant cultures, it has been demonstrated that FGF-1 and FGF-2 can stimulate both proliferation of lens epithelial cells and differentiation of lens fiber cells (4McAvoy J.W. Chamberlain C.G. Development. 1989; 107: 221-228PubMed Google Scholar,5Schulz M.W. Chamberlain C.G. de Iongh R.U. McAvoy J.W. Development. 1993; 118: 117-126PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in vivo gain-of-function studies have shown that misexpression of FGF-1, -4, -8, or -9 under the control of the lens-specific αA-crystallin promoter causes lens abnormalities and the so-called microphthalamia (small lens) phenotype (6Robinson M.L. Overbeek P.A. Verran D.J. Grizzle W.E. Stockard C.R. Friesel R. Maciag T. Thompson J.A. Development. 1995; 121: 505-514PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lovicu F.J. Overbeek P.A. Development. 1998; 125: 3365-3377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These FGFs effectively induce cell cycle withdrawal, loss of the characteristic cuboidal morphology, elongation of the cell shape, and accumulation of β-crystallin, resulting in premature differentiation of lens epithelial cells into fiber cells. In addition, a truncated form of FGF receptor (FGFR) lacking the cytoplasmic kinase domain inhibits fiber cell differentiation when expressed in transgenic mice under the control of a lens-specific promoter (7Robinson M.L. MacMillan-Crow L.A. Thompson J.A. Overbeek P.A. Development. 1995; 121: 3959-3967PubMed Google Scholar), and a secreted form of FGFR can cause a delay in fiber differentiation (9Govindarajan V. Overbeek P.A. Development. 2001; 128: 1617-1627PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these studies implicate FGFs as bifunctional molecules that regulate both proliferation and differentiation of the lens cells. The transcription factors that mediate FGF signaling in lens development and the molecular mechanisms used by FGFs to regulate the transcriptional factors remain to be identified. Several transcription factors, including Pax6, Sox2, Six3, c-Maf, and L-Maf, are known to be important in lens development and in regulating the expression of lens-specific genes such as crystallin genes (10Cvekl A.

Development. 2000; 127: 307-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of these factors, L-Maf is one of the most attractive candidates for mediating FGF signaling, because L-Maf has been identified as a lens-specific regulator of avian αA-crystallin expression (14Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and c-maf-deficient mice have defective lens fiber differentiation and loss of crystallin gene expression (16Kawauchi S.

Cordes S.P. Overbeek P.A. Barsh G.S. Development. 2000; 127: 307-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There results show that Mafs are critical for expression of crystallin genes and lens fiber differentiation. L-Maf is a basic region/leucine zipper transcription factor and regulates the expression of αA-crystallin by binding the lens-specific enhancer element αCE2 (14Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 18Matsuo I. Kitamura M. Okazaki K. Yasuda K. Development. 1991; 113: 539-550PubMed Google Scholar). In chicken, the expression of L-mafis initiated in the lens placode and is subsequently restricted to the developing lens (14Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 19Yoshida T. Yasuda K. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, ectopic expression of L-Maf induces the expression of several crystallin and filensin genes (14Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and promotes the formation of lens-like structures called lentoid bodies in retinal primary cultures. Furthermore, a dominant-negative form of L-Maf inhibits crystallin gene expression and proper lens cell differentiation (20Reza H.M. Ogino H. Yasuda K. Mech. Dev. 2002; 116: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, L-Maf is clearly important for crystallin gene expression and for lens development. To address the molecular mechanisms that determine how FGF signaling regulates transcription of the lens-specific genes in lens development, we investigated the effects of FGF signaling on the regulation of L-Maf function. Here we show that FGF-2 promotes proliferation of lens cells in the early stages of primary culture but represses expression of lens-specific genes at the same time points. In addition, FGF/ERK signaling represses activity of an L-Maf-dependent reporter in the lens cells. We also found that residues Thr-57 and Ser-65 of the L-Maf protein are important as phosphorylation sites for extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)in vitro. Mutations at either of these two sites caused an increased stability of the L-Maf protein, resulting in enhanced expression of δ-crystallin. These results indicate that FGF/ERK signaling controls terminal differentiation of the lens fiber cells through regulation of L-Maf stability. Lens cell cultures were prepared as previously described (18Matsuo I. Kitamura M. Okazaki K. Yasuda K. Development. 1991; 113: 539-550PubMed Google Scholar). Lens cells from 14-day-old chick embryos were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% chicken serum. When the cells reached confluence, they were harvested with trypsin and centrifuged to remove nonproliferative lens fiber cells. The cells were then cultured at a density of 1 × 105/30-mm dish to establish primary cultures. Transfection with plasmids or treatment with FGF-2 (human fibroblast growth factor-2, PeproTech House) were carried out 1 day after establishment of the primary cultures. Plasmids used to express FLAG epitope-tagged L-Maf (pEFX3-fg-L-Maf) constructs in lens cells have been described previously (14Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). pEFX-β-gal containing the human EF-1α promoter and β-galactosidase open reading frame inserts and pCAGGS-GFP carrying the cytomegalovirus enhancer, β-actin basal promoter, and green fluorescent protein open reading frame sequences were used as controls for normalization (14Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Single amino acid mutations of the L-Maf protein were carried out by subcloning anEcoRV-EagI fragment from pEFX3-fg-L-Maf, corresponding to the coding region of the N terminus of L-Maf, into pBluescript vector (pBsk-L-Maf). Point mutations were generated on pBsk-L-Maf using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using mutagenic oligonucleotide primers, as follows: S14A, 5′-GCT GCC CAC CGC CCC CCT CGC CAT CG-3′; T57A, 5′-CCC CTC TCA GCG CGC CGT GCT CCT CC-3′; S65A, 5′-CCG TGC CTT CCG CGC CCA GTT TCT GC-3′ (mutations are underlined). Mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis and then subcloned back into pEFX3-fg-L-Maf digested with EcoRV and EagI. pCAGGS-DN-L-Maf, an expression plasmid for a dominant-negative form of L-Maf, was described previously (20Reza H.M. Ogino H. Yasuda K. Mech. Dev. 2002; 116: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A plasmid encoding the S218/222E Δ32–51 mutant of MEK1 was purchased from Stratagene. Reporter constructs containing six copies of an αCE2 core sequence and the β-actin basal promoter (cαALuc) were described previously (14Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). tkLuc is a luciferase reporter plasmid carrying the viral thymidine kinase gene promoter (base pairs −197 to +56) (18Matsuo I. Kitamura M. Okazaki K. Yasuda K. Development. 1991; 113: 539-550PubMed Google Scholar). For UAS6βLuc, six copies of the upstream activation sequence fragment were inserted into the βLuc plasmid (14Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) at the 5′ end of the β-actin basal promoter and luciferase gene. To construct the GAL4-Elk1 expression plasmid, the coding sequence for the activation domain of human Elk1 (amino acids 307–428) (kindly provided by Dr. R. Treisman (21Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar)) was amplified by PCR, subcloned into pCMX-GAL4 (kind gift from Dr. K. Umesono), and digested withBamHI and EcoRV (pCMX-GAL4-Elk1). Primary lens cultures in 12-well dishes were transfected with 0.5 μg of DNA using DEMRI-C according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). After 4 h of transfection, the medium was replaced by fresh 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% chick serum medium. Cells were incubated for a further 48 h, and then whole cell lysates were prepared in extraction buffer (0.1 ml of 25 mm Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 15% glycerol, 2% CHAPS, 1% l-α-phosphatidylcholine, 1% bovine serum albumin, 4 mm EGTA, 8 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm p-amidinophenyl methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (APMSF, Wako)). The luciferase activities of the lysates were measured with a microtiter plate luminometer (Dynex). Transfection efficiency in each dish was normalized by the β-galactosidase activity. All luciferase activity values represent mean ± standard deviation of results obtained from duplicates of three independent transfection experiments. GST and GST-L-Maf proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α strain and then purified from the bacterial extracts using glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The recombinant L-Maf protein was incubated with purified ERK (New England Biolabs) in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl21 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij35) at 30 °C for 3 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared from the lens cell cultures as described previously (18Matsuo I. Kitamura M. Okazaki K. Yasuda K. Development. 1991; 113: 539-550PubMed Google Scholar). An equal amount of protein from each extract was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and was subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were incubated with the following primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer: anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Kodak, 1:8000), anti-GST (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1:8000), anti-L-Maf (1:1000 (14Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar)), anti-ERK (Promega, 1:1000), anti-phospho-ERK (Promega, 1:1000), and anti-δ-crystallin (1:1 (22Sawada K. Agata K. Yoshiki A. Eguchi G. Jpn. J. Ophthalmol. 1993; 37: 355-368PubMed Google Scholar)). After three washes in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20), membranes were incubated with the following secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase diluted in blocking buffer: anti-mouse IgG antibody (Dako, 1:1000), anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Dako, 1:1000). The signals were detected with an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The stability of the L-Maf was analyzed by incubating the cells for 3 h in the presence of proteasome inhibitor. The inhibitors used were LLnL (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-aldehyde, 20 μg/ml, BostonBiochem), MG132 (BostonBiochem, 50 μm), andclasto-lactacystin-β-lactone (lactastatin, BostonBiochem, 10 μm). After the treatment, cells were washed to remove inhibitors followed by further incubation in fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% chick serum for various periods. Then the whole cell extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis. Northern blot analyses were carried out as described previously (23Maegawa S. Yasuda K. Inoue K. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In brief, total RNA was isolated from the cultured lens cells, and equal amounts of RNA were separated on formaldehyde-agarose gels. After electrophoresis, RNA was blotted onto Biodyne A nylon membranes (Pall) and hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes. mRNAs were detected with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and visualized by reaction with the chemiluminescent substrate, disodium 3-(4-methoxysprio{1,2-dioxetane 3,2′(5′-chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7] decan}-4-yl)phenyl phosphate (Applied Biosystems) (Tropix). Immunostaining of primary cultured cells was carried out as described previously (19Yoshida T. Yasuda K. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The cells were fixed and incubated with the appropriate antibody: purified rabbit anti-L-Maf IgG (4McAvoy J.W. Chamberlain C.G. Development. 1989; 107: 221-228PubMed Google Scholar), 1:1000; AlexaFluor-488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes), 1:1000; AlexaFluor-594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), 1:1000. An Olympus AX70 confocal microscope was used to determine the localization of L-Maf, δ-crystallin, and phospho-ERK in lentoid bodies in primary cultured lens cells. The probe used for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay was 5′-CATTTCTGCTGACCACGTTGCCTTC-3′ (cαA). Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were labeled at the 3′ end using the Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dATP. Then, 5 pmol of probe was incubated with 1 pmol of L-Maf protein for 30 min at 30 °C in reaction buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 5 μg/μl poly (dI-dC)-poly (dI-dC)). The reaction mixture was loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was transferred to DEAE paper, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Previous studies had shown that FGF-1 and FGF-2 promote proliferation and differentiation of lens epithelial cells in explant cultures (4McAvoy J.W. Chamberlain C.G. Development. 1989; 107: 221-228PubMed Google Scholar, 24Li L. Zhou J. James G. Heller-Harrison R. Czech M.P. Olson E.N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying FGF signaling in lens development are yet to be elucidated. To address these mechanisms, we used primary cultures enriched for proliferating lens epithelial cells. Initially, we aimed to confirm whether FGF-2 regulates both proliferation and differentiation of the lens cells. Cell counts were performed at different times during culture with or without FGF-2 treatment. The number of FGF-2-treated lens cells was greatly increased on days 1 and 2 compared with the untreated control cells (Fig. 1 A). However, by days 3–6, neither the FGF-2-treated nor untreated lens cells showed significant proliferation. After 6 days of culture, we found abundant and large lentoid bodies in the FGF-2-treated lens cell cultures (Fig. 1 B). Lentoid bodies are clusters of differentiated fiber cells. These results demonstrate that FGF-2 promotes both proliferation and differentiation of primary cultured lens cells, which is consistent with previous results using lens explants (4McAvoy J.W. Chamberlain C.G. Development. 1989; 107: 221-228PubMed Google Scholar, 24Li L. Zhou J. James G. Heller-Harrison R. Czech M.P. Olson E.N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Next we examined the effect of FGF-2 on the expression of marker genes for lens fiber differentiation, crystallin genes and filensin gene. Primary lens cells were incubated with or without FGF-2, and then total RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern blot analysis. After day 3, expression of both crystallin and filensin genes was enhanced by the addition of FGF-2 (Fig. 1 C). Surprisingly, FGF-2 efficiently reduced the expression of δ-, αA-, βB1-crystallin, and filensin genes at earlier culture points (Fig. 1 C, days 1–2), which coincided with the period of lens cell proliferation (Fig. 1 A). These results suggest that FGF-2 represses lens-specific genes at early stages of culture when the lens epithelial cells are proliferating, whereas the same growth factor promotes lens fiber differentiation to augment crystallin gene expression and lentoid body formation at later stages of cell culture. On the basis of FGF-2 treatment, we then proposed that transcription factors regulating the expression of crystallins should function under the control of FGF-2. One of the attractive candidates for this regulation is lens-specific Maf (L-Maf), which binds to chicken αA-crystallin enhancer (αCE2) and regulates expression of the αA-, δ-, βB1-crystallin, and filensin genes (14Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 18Matsuo I. Kitamura M. Okazaki K. Yasuda K. Development. 1991; 113: 539-550PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a dominant-negative form of L-Maf that lacks its acidic domain (DN-L-Maf (20Reza H.M. Ogino H. Yasuda K. Mech. Dev. 2002; 116: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)) repressed expression of the αA-, δ-, βB1-crystallin, and filensin genes in primary cultured lens cells (Fig. 2 A) and chick embryos (20Reza H.M. Ogino H. Yasuda K. Mech. Dev. 2002; 116: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), showing that L-Maf is essential for the expression of the lens-specific genes. To assess the possibility that FGF signaling regulates the L-maf gene, we first examined the effect of FGF-2 on expression of L-maf mRNA. Lens cell primary cultures were incubated for 48 h with or without FGF-2, and then total RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern blot analysis. L-mafmRNA levels in the FGF-2-treated cells were comparable to those in the untreated control cells (Fig. 2 B), indicating that FGF-2 does not significantly affect transcription of the L-mafgene. We next examined the effect of FGF-2 on regulation of L-Maf at the protein level. Since we could not detect l-Maf protein by Western blot analysis (data not shown), we measured the transcriptional activity of L-Maf protein in primary cultured lens cells using a reporter gene construct containing six copies of a 25-bp L-Maf binding site in αCE2, β-actin basal promoter, and the luciferase coding sequence (cαALuc, Fig. 2 C). This construct was transiently transfected into the lens cells, which were incubated with or without FGF-2 for 48 h. Luciferase activities provided a measure of transcriptional activity. FGF-2 clearly repressed the expression of the reporter gene (Fig. 2 C), an effect that was dose-dependent (Fig. 2 D, left panel). This repression was not due to a general effect on transcription because a luciferase reporter driven by either a thymidine kinase promoter or a β-actin basal promoter alone was not affected by the addition of FGF-2 (tkLuc and βLuc, Fig. 2 C). We also examined the effect of a specific FGF receptor inhibitor, SU5402 (25Mohammadi M. McMahon G. Sun L. Tang C. Hirth P. Yeh B.K. Hubbard S.R. Schlessinger J. Science. 1997; 276: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). The reporter activity significantly increased in the presence of SU5402 (Fig. 2 D, right panel), indicating that inhibition of FGF signaling promotes expression of the reporter gene. Taken together, these results indicate that FGF signaling inhibits L-Maf-dependent transcription in the primary cultured lens cell, resulting in repression of the lens-specific genes at the early culture stage. ERK1 and ERK2, members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, play major roles in a variety of developmental processes and biological actions induced by FGF signaling (26Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar, 27Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Because activated ERK is detected in lens in vivo (28Lovicu F.J. McAvoy J.W. Development. 2001; 128: 5075-5084PubMed Google Scholar), FGF-2 may regulate L-Maf activity through ERK. To test this possibility, we first examined whether FGF signaling involves the ERK pathway in primary cultured lens cells. Because serum is a potent activator of the MAPK cascade, lens cells were serum-starved for 4 h followed by FGF-2 treatment for 1 h. In the whole cell extracts of unstimulated cultured lens cells, phosphorylated ERK was detected only as a weak band by Western blot analysis with an anti-phospho-ERK antibody (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). In contrast, phosphorylation of ERK was increased in the FGF-2-treated cells (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). This phosphorylation of ERK was clearly inhibited by addition of PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK1, the ERK kinase (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). These results demonstrate that FGF-2 promotes phosphorylation of ERK through MEK1 in lens cells. We next examined the effect of constitutively active MEK1 on the activity of L-Maf in the primary cultured lens cells using the cαALuc reporter (Fig. 3 B, left). Introduction of the constitutively active MEK1 caused a decrease in expression of the reporter gene. In contrast, MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 promoted expression of the reporter gene (Fig. 3 B), indicating that L-Maf activity in lens cells is regulated through the MEK1/ERK pathway. We also confirmed that the constitutively active MEK1 could activate Elk considerably, an ERK-regulated transcription factor, using the GAL4-Elk1 and UAS6βLuc reporter gene assay (Fig. 3 B,right), indicating that MEK1 is active in the cultured lens cells and the inhibitory effect of MEK1 is not ubiquitous to all transcription. These results indicate that MEK1/ERK mediates FGF-2 signaling to repress L-Maf-dependent transcription. We identified three putative MAPK target sites in the L-Maf acidic region. To test whether L-Maf is directly phosphorylated by ERK, we first performed in vitro phosphorylation analysis. When incubated with purified ERK, recombinant L-Maf protein was clearly phosphorylated (Fig. 4 A). To examine phosphorylation of L-Maf in living cells, we introduced an expression plasmid encoding wild-type L-Maf into the COS-7 monkey kidney cell line. Ectopically expressed L-Maf protein was detected as a 42-kDa band in COS-7 cells by Western blot analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 4 C). A 34-kDa band, which is approximately the same molecular size as the in vitro translated L-Maf protein, appeared when the cell lysate was treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, indicating that L-Maf is phosphorylated in living cells. To identify the ERK phosphorylation site, a series of L-Maf mutant proteins was made with substitutions to alanine residues at the three potential sites of Ser-14, Thr-57, or Ser-65 (designated as S14A, T57A, and S65A, respectively). The wild-type and mutant proteins were subjected to in vitro phosphorylation. Incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP was detected with the wild-type L-Maf protein and mutant S14A, suggesting that Ser-14 is not involved in phosphorylation by ERK (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, T57A and S65A mutants showed a significantly reduced phosphorylation signal. These results implicate Thr-57 and Ser-65 as important in the phosphorylation of L-Maf by ERK. We next evaluated the effects of mutating the phosphorylation sites on the transcriptional activation of L-Maf. The mutation on Ser-14 did not significantly affect the transcriptional activity of L-Maf (Fig. 5 A), whereas the T57A and S65A L-Maf mutants showed ∼5- and 7-fold higher levels of reporter activity than the wild-type protein, respectively. We also examined the importance of Thr-57 and Ser-65 for the ability of L-Maf to induce the expression of its in vivo target gene, δ-crystallin. When either T57A or S65A mutant L-Maf was introduced into primary cultured retinal cells, expression of endogenous δ-crystallin was significantly induced (Fig. 5 C), and the number of δ-crystallin-positive cells increased 3–4-fold compared with wild-type L-Maf (Fig. 5 C, TableI). To confirm that these mutational effects involve MEK1/ERK signaling, constitutively active MEK1 was cotransfected into cultured lens cells together with either wild-type or S65A mutant L-Maf. The transcriptional activity of endogenous L-Maf and overexpressed wild-type L-Maf were decreased by the co-expression of constitutively active MEK1 (Fig. 5 B), whereas S65A mutant L-Maf was not sensitive to MEK1 signaling. Taken together, these results indicate that the ERK phosphorylation sites at Thr-57 and Ser-65 are important for the transcriptional activity of L-Maf and that phosphorylation at these sites negatively regulates L-Maf function in lens cells.Table IMutation of MAPK target sites of L-Maf promotes lens differentiationOverexpressed L-MafNo. of δ-crystallin-positive cells/2.4 mm2Exp. 1Exp. 2Exp. 3Wild type8135S14A122614T57A204018S65A294713Mock000 Open table in a new tab To elucidate how L-Maf function is regulated by phosphorylation, we measured the DNA binding activity of phosphorylated or unphosphorylated L-Maf protein by an electrophoretic"
https://openalex.org/W2039183643,"The amyloid peptides Abeta1-42 and Abeta25-35 strongly inhibited the activity of constitutive neuronal and endothelial nitric oxide synthases (i.e., NOS-I and NOS-III, respectively) in cell-free assays. The molecular mechanism of NOS inhibition by Ab fragments was studied in detail with Abeta25-35. The inhibitory ability was mostly NADPH-dependent and specific for the soluble form of Abeta25-35. Optical, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy showed that the soluble, but not aggregated, Abeta25-35 interacted with NADPH, thus suggesting that a direct recruitment of NADPH may result in diminished availability of the redox cofactor for NOS functioning. To assess the physiological relevance of our findings, rat neuronal-like PC12 and glioma C6 cell lines were used as cellular models. After Abeta25-35 internalization into cells was verified, the activity of constitutive NOS was measured using the DAF-2DA detection system and found to be severely impaired upon Abeta25-35 uptake. Consistent with previous results on the molecular cross-talk between NOS isoforms, repression of constitutive NOS by Abeta25-35 resulted in enhanced expression of inducible NOS (NOS-II) mRNA in C6 cells. Our results represent the first evidence that amyloid fragments impair constitutive NOS activity in cell-free and cellular systems, providing a possible molecular mechanism for the onset and/or maintenance of Alzheimer's disease."

The expression of the various ppGalNAc transferase family members having different peptide and/or glycopeptide specificities therefore represents the initial step in the regulation or modulation ofO-glycan biosynthesis. Subsequent elongation ofO-linked glycans proceeds by the stepwise addition of single sugar residues via a series of substrate-specific Golgi resident transferases (32Brockhausen I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 67-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Depending on the initial and subsequent substitutions on the GalNAc residue (which may be further modulated by peptide sequence and glycosylation state), a bewildering array ofO-linked structures is possible (32Brockhausen I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 67-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar).Central to our understanding of the role and regulation of mucin-typeO-glycosylation is the quantitative determination of the site-specific glycosylation pattern of mucins and mucin-like domains and attempting to relate these patterns to the nature of the surrounding polypeptide sequence. A number of statistically based approaches have been reported that have attempted to predict sites ofO-glycosylation; however, these approaches are at best semiqualitative and are thus not capable of predicting the extent of site-specific glycosylation (33Elhammer A.P.

The results of these and other in vitro studies and the above statistical analyses all point to the roles of neighboring proline, serine, and threonine residues for enhancing the probability of O-glycosylation.

Our analysis of the glycosylation pattern of these mucins was found to support our earlier suggestions that the O-linked glycan side chain structures and side chain lengths of mucin appear to be modulated in vivo by the density of neighboring, presumably partially glycosylated, hydroxyamino acid residues in the polypeptide sequence. This effect was detected initially for the core-1 structures, formed by the transfer of β-Gal to GalNAc by the core-1 β3-galactosyltransferase (41Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26580-26588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and more recently for the peptide GalNAc residues (45Gerken T.A. Gilmore M. Zhang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7736-7751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).In this report we have extended our studies to the characterization of the in vitro glycosylation of the apoPSM tandem repeat domain by purified recombinant ppGalNAc transferases T1 and T2. The results show a wide range of rates of GalNAc incorporation with Thr residues incorporating GalNAc at a significantly higher rate than Ser residues. Kinetic models taking into account the reduction of the Ser and Thr first-order rate constants proportionally to the glycosylation status of neighboring residues were found to reasonably reproduce the experimental site-specific rates of GalNAc incorporation for both ppGalNAc transferases. These findings unambiguously confirm the important role that neighboring group glycosylation plays in modulating the initial step of mucin O-glycosylation. Furthermore, the positional weighting constants derived from the models may be used to infer information on the peptide/glycopeptide recognition sites on the different ppGalNAc transferases. This is the first report demonstrating the ability to kinetically model the site-specific glycosylation pattern of a heavily O-glycosylated mucin-like domain.DISCUSSIONStudies were undertaken to examine the activities of purified ppGalNAc transferases T1 and T2 against the porcine submaxillary mucin tandem repeat substrate whose in vivo glycosylation pattern has been extensively characterized (41Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26580-26588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 42Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 7736-7751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It was of interest to determine the extent that the single transferases could reproduce the observed in vivo glycosylation pattern and to determine whether the inverse correlations of glycosylation by GalNAc with hydroxyamino acid density and presumably glycosylation density would be reproduced in vitro. These studies have successfully addressed both issues, suggesting that ppGalNAc T1 is a major contributor to the mucin's glycosylation and confirming, by a kinetic modeling approach, that local glycosylation status can account for much of the glycosylation behavior of both transferases.Experimental evidence for neighboring glycosylation decreasing the rate of glycosylation has been reported previously (26Brockhausen I. Toki D. Brockhausen J. Peters S. Bielfeldt T. Kleen A. Paulsen H. Meldal M. Hagen F. Tabak L.A. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Hanisch F.G. Reis C.A.

Peter-Katalinic J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9946-9954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) for ppGalNAc T1 through T4 against a range of small glycopeptides substrates. However, these studies did not yield predictive rules, perhaps due to the presence of end effects due to the use of relatively short (5–25 residues) glycopeptide substrates. The present work was performed on the relatively intact oligomeric tandem repeat domains derived from PSM; therefore, end effects should be absent in the final analysis of the glycosylation of the isolated tandem repeat. An additional advantage of our approach is that the rate data for all of the Ser and Thr residues in the PSM tandem repeat are obtained under exactly identical conditions, thereby eliminating additional experimental variables that may interfere with their comparison.The demonstration that the time course of glycosylation of the PSM tandem repeat can be nearly completely accounted for on the basis of neighboring group glycosylation status, for both ppGalNAc T1 and T2, is particularly interesting as these results seem to contradict the many previous studies demonstrating that the ppGalNAc transferases possess clear substrate preferences related to peptide sequence and composition.

Statistical data base studies on O-glycosylation also demonstrate a high prevalence for Pro, Ser, and Thr residues neighboring the sites ofO-glycosylation (33Elhammer A.P. Poorman R.A. Brown E.

In addition, several ppGalNAc transferase isoforms have sufficiently different substrate specificities, such that unique transferase-specific peptide acceptors have been identified (13Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Mandel U. Mirgorodskaya E. Roepstorff P. Burchell J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Hollingsworth M.A. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Eiberg H. Steffensen R. Clausen H. J. Biol.

On the basis of this prior knowledge the only feasible explanation for the success of our modeling is that the PSM tandem repeat, having evolved to be efficientlyO-glycosylated, is composed of exceptionally good acceptor sites having nearly identical initial rates ofO-glycosylation (indeed as implemented in the model). Only under such conditions would the inhibitory effects of neighboring glycosylation be readily revealed. As we have discussed above, the observation that Ser2 and perhaps Thr79 are far less glycosylated than expected by our kinetic model suggests that these residues may be intrinsically poor acceptors. It is therefore anticipated that additional refinements in the model, taking into account rate constant decreases or enhancements due to specific neighboring residues or peptide sequences, may be required before the glycosylation of other mucin peptide domains can be successfully modeled by this approach.It should be noted that the inclusion into our model of the inhibitory effects of neighboring nonglycosylated hydroxyamino acid residues in fact introduces a sequence-specific component, effectively recognizing that ppGalNAc transferases may possess unfavorable hydroxyamino acid sequence motifs. On the basis of the modeling, ppGalNAc T2 clearly shows a highly specific sensitivity to the presence of neighboring hydroxyamino acid residues, particularly at the +1 position, which is only weakly observed for ppGalNAc T1. Whether other ppGalNAc transferases exhibit similar sensitivities remains to be determined. Although the above may appear to conflict with the statistical analysis of O-glycosylation sites which suggests the presence of Ser and Thr as predictors of O-glycosylation (33Elhammer A.P.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1365-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it has been shown that the association of Ser and Thr withO-glycosylation is the result of the statistical clustering of Ser and Thr residues (34Hansen J.E. Lund O. Tolstrup N. Gooley A.A. Williams K.L. Brunak S. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar).In summary, a kinetic model based on first principles has been described capable of reproducing the in vitro glycosylation of the PSM tandem repeat domain by both ppGalNAc T1 and T2. Key to the model is the reduction of the rate constant proportional to the neighboring residue glycosylation status. An analysis of the positional sequence weighting coefficients reveals that both ppGalNAc T1 and T2 possess sensitivities to the neighboring glycosylation state up to plus and minus 3 residues of the site of glycosylation, generally in keeping with previous O-glycosylation site analysis (33Elhammer A.P.

https://openalex.org/W2083846731,"The goal of this study was to examine the mechanism of magnesium binding to the regulatory domain of skeletal troponin C (TnC). The fluorescence of Trp29, immediately preceding the first calcium-binding loop in TnCF29W, was unchanged by addition of magnesium, but increased upon calcium binding with an affinity of 3.3 μm. However, the calcium-dependent increase in TnCF29W fluorescence could be reversed by addition of magnesium, with a calculated competitive magnesium affinity of 2.2 mm. When a Z acid pair was introduced into the first EF-hand of TnCF29W, the fluorescence of G34DTnCF29W increased upon addition of magnesium or calcium with affinities of 295 and 1.9 μm, respectively. Addition of 3 mm magnesium decreased the calcium sensitivity of TnCF29W and G34DTnCF29W ∼2- and 6-fold, respectively. Exchange of G34DTnCF29W into skinned psoas muscle fibers decreased fiber calcium sensitivity ∼1.7-fold compared with TnCF29W at 1 mm [magnesium]free and ∼3.2-fold at 3 mm [magnesium]free. Thus, incorporation of a Z acid pair into the first EF-hand allows it to bind magnesium with high affinity. Furthermore, the data suggests that the second EF-hand, but not the first, of TnC is responsible for the competitive magnesium binding to the regulatory domain. The goal of this study was to examine the mechanism of magnesium binding to the regulatory domain of skeletal troponin C (TnC). The fluorescence of Trp29, immediately preceding the first calcium-binding loop in TnCF29W, was unchanged by addition of magnesium, but increased upon calcium binding with an affinity of 3.3 μm. However, the calcium-dependent increase in TnCF29W fluorescence could be reversed by addition of magnesium, with a calculated competitive magnesium affinity of 2.2 mm. When a Z acid pair was introduced into the first EF-hand of TnCF29W, the fluorescence of G34DTnCF29W increased upon addition of magnesium or calcium with affinities of 295 and 1.9 μm, respectively. Addition of 3 mm magnesium decreased the calcium sensitivity of TnCF29W and G34DTnCF29W ∼2- and 6-fold, respectively. Exchange of G34DTnCF29W into skinned psoas muscle fibers decreased fiber calcium sensitivity ∼1.7-fold compared with TnCF29W at 1 mm [magnesium]free and ∼3.2-fold at 3 mm [magnesium]free. Thus, incorporation of a Z acid pair into the first EF-hand allows it to bind magnesium with high affinity. Furthermore, the data suggests that the second EF-hand, but not the first, of TnC is responsible for the competitive magnesium binding to the regulatory domain. The EF-hand is the most common Ca2+ binding motif found in nature (1Lewit-Bentley A. Rety S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). EF-hand proteins and their functions are numerous and diverse (for review see Ref. 2Kawasaki H. Kretsinger R.H. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 297-490PubMed Google Scholar). In general, EF-hand domains can be classified functionally into two groups, those that regulate cellular activities through a reversible change in structure upon Ca2+ binding and release (such as the N-terminal regulatory domain of troponin C (TnC) 1The abbreviations used are: TnC, intact chicken skeletal troponin C; Tn, troponin; TnCF29W, intact TnC mutant with the Phe29 → Trp mutation; G34DTnCF29W, intact TnCF29W mutant with the Gly34 → Asp mutation; TnC1–90F29W, isolated N-terminal domain representing residues 1–90 of TnCF29W; cTnCF27W, intact human cardiac TnC mutant with the Phe27 → Trp mutation; TnI, chicken skeletal troponin I; TnI-(96–148), chicken skeletal troponin I peptide corresponding to residues 96–148; CaM, calmodulin; CaMF19W, CaM mutant with the Phe19 → Trp mutation; pCa, -log[Ca2+]; [Ca2+]50, [Ca2+] that produced half-maximal force; DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; Quin-2, 2-((bis(carboxymethyl)amino)-5-methylphenoxy)-methyl)-6- methoxy-8-(bis(carboxymethyl)amino)-quinolineand both domains of calmodulin (CaM)) and those that simply buffer/transport Ca2+ (such as parvalbumin and calbindin D9K) or anchor protein complexes (such as the C-terminal domain of TnC). Often the nonregulatory EF-hand domains bind Mg2+ competitively and display higher Ca2+affinity than do the regulatory domains. However, it is becoming clear that regulatory EF-hand proteins, such as the N-terminal of CaM can also bind Mg2+ with a physiologically relevant affinity (3Tikunova S.B. Black D.J. Johnson J.D. Davis J.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3348-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,4Ohki S. Ikura M. Zhang M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4309-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to elucidate the mechanisms behind EF-hand Mg2+ binding. The canonical EF-hand consists of 29 consecutive residues, with two helices flanking a 12-residue loop. The chelating loop residues in positions 1(+x), 3(+y), 5(+z), 7 (−y), 9(−x), and 12 (−z) ligate Ca2+ through seven oxygen atoms arranged three dimensionally on the axes of a pentagonal bipyramid (for review see Refs. 5Strynadka N.C.J.

Proteins. 1999; 37: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Factors that control Ca2+ affinity are complex and involve residues within and outside of the Ca2+-binding loop (7Wang S.

The mechanisms utilized for EF-hand Mg2+ binding are less understood. The smaller Mg2+ cation is typically complexed by some of the same loop residues used for Ca2+ binding, although through six oxygen atoms arranged in an octahedral geometry (for review see Refs. 11Linse S. Forsen S. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1995; 30: 89-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar and12Falke J.J. Drake S.K. Hazard A.L. Peerson O.B. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1994; 27: 219-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Interestingly, synthetic EF-hand peptides were observed to bind Mg2+ when their Ca2+-binding loops contained a Z acid pair, chelating residues at loop positions +z and −z (13Procyshyn R.M. Reid R.E.

The metal binding properties of TnC have been studied extensively using various biophysical and biochemical techniques (15Potter J.D. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4628-4633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Johnson J.D. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3775-3777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Johnson J.D.

These studies have demonstrated that the two C-domain EF-hands have ∼10-fold higher Ca2+ affinity and greater than 100-fold slower Ca2+ exchange rates than the two N-domain EF-hands (18Johnson J.D. Charlton S.C. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3497-3502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Johnson J.D. Nakkula R.J. Vasulka C. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8919-8923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to Ca2+, the C-domain sites also competitively bind Mg2+ with a physiologically relevant affinity. Because of their high Ca2+ and Mg2+affinities and slow exchange rates, the C-domain sites are thought to play a structural role in muscle function by anchoring TnC into the Tn Complex. The N-domain sites of TnC are considered to be Ca2+-specific under physiological Mg2+concentrations, and generally accepted to be directly involved in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of muscle contraction (for review see Refs. 21Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar and 22Potter J.D. Johnson J.D. Chueng W.Y. Calcium and Cell Function. II. Academic Press, New York1982: 145-173Google Scholar). However, addition of Mg2+has been shown to decrease the Ca2+ sensitivity of the regulatory domain of fluorescent TnCs in isolation (19Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 1011-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Potter J.D. Robertson S.P. Johnson J.D. Fed. Proc. 1981; 40: 2653-2656PubMed Google Scholar, 24She M. Dong W.J.

Furthermore, several groups have demonstrated that increased [Mg2+] caused a decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity of Tn-regulated actomyosin ATPase and force development (26Zot A.S. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1966-1969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Morimoto S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1073: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 30Kerrick W.G.L.

Physiol. 1975; 66: 427-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The question whether Mg2+ competes with Ca2+ for the N-domain sites remains unresolved and controversial. Some research groups have suggested the presence of auxiliary Mg2+ binding sites in TnC (15Potter J.D. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4628-4633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Potter J.D. Robertson S.P. Johnson J.D. Fed. Proc. 1981; 40: 2653-2656PubMed Google Scholar), whereas others hypothesized Mg2+ as a direct Ca2+competitor for the N-terminal regulatory sites (19Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 1011-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27Morimoto S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1073: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 32Kohama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 88: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because TnC regulates muscle contraction as a part of the troponin complex and not in isolation, it is important to understand the interactions of TnC with TnI. The binding of TnI to TnC increases the Ca2+ sensitivity of the N- and C-domains of TnC ∼10-fold (15Potter J.D. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4628-4633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ramos C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18189-18195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). TnC and TnI interact in an antiparallel orientation (34Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H. da Silva A.C. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5725-5729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) such that the Ca2+-dependent binding of the N-terminal regulatory domain of TnC to the C-domain of TnI is an early step in the generation of force in skeletal muscle (21Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that region 96–116 of TnI interacts with actin and was largely responsible for the ability of TnI to inhibit the activity of the actomyosin ATPase that could be reversed upon TnC-Ca2+ binding (36Syska H. Wilkinson J.M. Grand R.J. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 37Talbot J.A. Hodges R.S. J. Biol.

Recent studies implicated additional residues within 116–148 of TnI as being important for the complete inhibitory activity and regulatory interactions with actin and TnC (39Pearlstone J.R. Sykes B.D. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7601-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 40Van Eyk J.E. Thomas L.T. Tripet B. Wiesner R.J. Pearlstone J.R. Farah C.S. Reinach F.C.

Thus, the Ca2+-dependent binding of the regulatory domain of TnC to TnI-(96–148) may be a good model system to study the Ca2+-dependent interactions between TnI and TnC. The F29W mutation in chicken skeletal TnC (TnCF29W) has been frequently used to study metal and ligand interactions with the regulatory N-domain sites of TnC (9Tikunova S.B. Rall J.A. Davis J.P.

TnCF29Wis a physiologically active protein that produced maximal isometric tension with a Ca2+ sensitivity indistinguishable from that of recombinant TnC, when reconstituted into skinned skeletal fibers (47Chandra M. da Silva E.F.

Interestingly, whereas Ca2+ causes a large increase in TnCF29W fluorescence, Mg2+ does not alter the fluorescence properties of Trp29 (44Li M.X. Chandra M. Pearlstone J.R. Racher K.I.

Previously, we have demonstrated that an endogenous Z acid pair was required for high affinity Mg2+ binding to the first EF-hand of fluorescent CaMF19W (3Tikunova S.B. Black D.J. Johnson J.D. Davis J.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3348-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We wanted to test if Mg2+ binding could be engineered into the first EF-hand of TnCF29W by substituting Gly in position 34 with Asp, thus introducing a Z acid pair (Fig. 1). We also wanted to determine how competitive Mg2+ binding to the first EF-hand of TnC would affect the physiological properties of G34DTnCF29W reconstituted into skinned skeletal muscle fibers. Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, EDTA, and EGTA were purchased from Sigma. Quin-2 was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. The TnI-(96–148) peptide was synthesized and purified by the Alberta Peptide Institute (Edmonton Alberta, Canada). The construction and expression of intact chicken skeletal TnCF29W and isolated N-domain residues 1–90, TnC1–90F29W, both in pET3a, have been described (44Li M.X. Chandra M. Pearlstone J.R.

Chicken skeletal fast TnI was prepared as described for the rabbit protein (51Mak A.S. Golosinska K. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14330-14334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The G34DTnCF29W mutant was constructed from the TnCF29W plasmid by primer-based site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The plasmids for TnCF29W and G34DTnCF29W were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen) and purified as described previously (9Tikunova S.B. Rall J.A. Davis J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6697-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS5 spectrofluorimeter at 15 °C. Trp fluorescence was excited at 275 nm and monitored at 345 nm as microliter amounts of CaCl2 or MgCl2 were added to 1 ml of each TnCF29W mutant (0.3 μm) in 200 mm MOPS (to prevent pH changes upon addition of metal), 90 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmDTT, pH 7.0, at 15 °C. The [Ca2+]free was calculated using the computer program EGCA02 developed by Robertson and Potter (52Robertson S. Potter J.D. Methods Pharmacol. 1984; 5: 63-75Google Scholar). The Ca2+ and Mg2+ affinities are reported as dissociation constantsK d(Ca) andK d(Mg), respectively. EachK d represents a mean of 3–5 titrations fit with a logistic sigmoid function mathematically equivalent to the Hill equation, as previously described (8Black D.J. Tikunova S.B. Johnson J.D. Davis J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13831-13837Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Tikunova S.B. Rall J.A. Davis J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6697-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Trp fluorescence was monitored as described in the previous paragraph. Microliter amounts of TnI-(96–148) were added to 1 ml of each TnCF29W mutant (0.6 μm) in 200 mm MOPS, 90 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm [Ca2+]free, 1 mmDTT, pH 7.0, at 15 °C. Each apparent peptide affinity represents a mean of 3 titrations fit with a logistic sigmoid function. Ca2+ and Mg2+ association (k on(Ca) andk on(Mg)) and dissociation rates (k off(Ca) and k off(Mg)) were measured using an Applied Photophysics Ltd. (Leatherhead, UK) model SX.18 MV stopped-flow instrument with a dead time of 1.4 ms at 15 °C. The samples were excited using a 150-watt xenon arc source. Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding kinetics of the N-terminal domain within intact TnCF29W and G34DTnCF29W were obtained utilizing Trp fluorescence changes excited at 275 nm with emission monitored through a UV transmitting black glass filter (UG1 from Oriel, Stratford, CT). Ca2+ dissociation rates in the absence of Mg2+ were also measured using the fluorescent Ca2+ chelator Quin-2. Whereas the fluorescence of Trp29 was selective for N-terminal Ca2+dissociation, Quin-2 fluorescence reported Ca2+dissociation from both the N- and C-domains within TnCF29W. However, the Ca2+ dissociation rate from the N-terminal domain within TnCF29W was easily distinguished from the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the C-terminal domain because the latter rate was >95-fold slower in the absence and presence of TnI-(96–148) or intact TnI. Quin-2 fluorescence was excited at 330 nm, with its emission monitored through a 510-nm broad band-pass interference filter (Oriel). Each data set represents an average of 10–15 traces, fit with a single exponential (variance <2 × 10−4). The curve fitting program (by P. J. King, Applied Photophysics Ltd.) uses the nonlinear Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The buffer used in all the Ca2+ stopped-flow experiments was 10 mm MOPS, 90 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.0. The Ca2+ and Mg2+ association rates were calculated using the equation k on =k off/K d, wherek off represents the concerted release of two Ca2+ or single Mg2+ ions andK d represents the binding event of two Ca2+ or one Mg2+ to the N-domain of TnC, as previously described (3Tikunova S.B. Black D.J. Johnson J.D. Davis J.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3348-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 8Black D.J. Tikunova S.B. Johnson J.D. Davis J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13831-13837Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Single fibers were isolated the day of use from bundles of rabbit psoas muscle that had been stored in a glycerinating solution at −20 °C no longer than 1 month. Solutions and the mechanical setup utilized for force measurements were as previously described (53Greaser M.L. Moss R.L. Reiser P.J. J. Physiol. 1988; 406: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Briefly, a single fiber was soaked in relaxing solution containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min to remove any residual sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum. The fiber was then tied down with pens in troughs attached to a servo-controlled DC torque motor (Cambridge Technologies, Watertown, MA) and an isometric force transducer (model 403A, Cambridge Technologies) as previously described (54Moss R.L. J. Physiol. 1979; 292: 177-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Fiber sarcomere length, width, and depth were measured with a video camera (Sony model XC-ST70) and an image analysis system (Simple PCI, Compix Inc., Cranberry Township, PA). Resting sarcomere length was set between 2.50 and 2.60 μm. The fiber was then activated in apCa (-log[Ca2+]) 4.0 solution and rapidly slackened after isometric force reached plateau. The analogue output of the force transducer was digitized using a DaqBoard/2000 and Daqview software (Iotech Inc., Cleveland, OH). The total force was measured between the plateau and baseline levels. The same procedure was utilized to obtain the resting force level of the fiber in apCa 9.0 solution. The active force generated by the fiber in the various pCa solutions was calculated as the total force minus the resting force. Three active force measurements were performed in pCa 4.0 with the final activation taken as the maximal force generated by the native fiber (i.e. prior to extraction of TnCendogenous), which led to an average force per cross-sectional area of 89 ± 4 kilo newton/m2. Force versus pCa was then established or the fiber was then soaked for 2 min in a TnC extraction solution containing 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.5 mmtrifluoperazine dihydrochloride at pH 7.0 (55Metzger J.M. Greaser M.L. Moss R.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 93: 855-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The average force in pCa 4.0 generated after TnCendogenousextraction was 5 ± 1% of the maximal force generated by the native fibers. The fiber was then washed three times in pCa 9.0 solution to remove any residual trifluoperazine dihydrochloride and then soaked for 2 min in a pCa 9.0 solution containing 16.7 μm recombinant TnCF29W or G34DTnCF29W. The maximal force generated by the recombinant TnCs averaged 93 ± 1 and 62 ± 5% for TnCF29Wand G34DTnCF29W, respectively. Because additional fibers reconstituted with 33.4 μm G34DTnCF29W or TnCF29W did not improve the maximal amount of force recovery or affect the force versus pCa relationship, these data were then combined with the 16.7 μm measurements. All of the reconstituted fibers were then exposed to a series of pCa solutions varying frompCa 9.0 to 3.0 and the active force versus pCa was measured. Every fourth activation was performed atpCa 4.0 to which each adjacent and randomized pCa was normalized. Because fibers reconstituted with recombinant TnC did not completely recover maximal force, force versus[Ca2+] curves were also performed on fibers in which TnC was partially extracted. Four fibers were soaked in TnC extraction solution for variable times to partially extract TnCendogenous. TnCF29W undergoes an ∼2.4-fold increase in Trp fluorescence upon Ca2+ binding to its N-domain sites at 15 °C (Fig.2 A). No change in Trp fluorescence was observed upon addition of 50 mmMg2+ to TnCF29W (Fig. 2 A). We previously demonstrated that high Mg2+ binding to the first EF-hand of CaM required the presence of an endogenous Z acid pair (3Tikunova S.B. Black D.J. Johnson J.D. Davis J.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3348-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). When a Z acid pair was introduced into the first EF-hand of TnCF29W (i.e. G34DTnCF29W), addition of Ca2+ led to an ∼2.2-fold increase in Trp fluorescence (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, G34DTnCF29W also underwent an ∼1.4-fold increase in its Trp fluorescence upon addition of Mg2+ (Fig. 2 B). These results demonstrate that substitution of Gly-34 with Asp in the first EF-hand of TnC led to Mg2+ binding to this EF-hand. Fig.3 A shows the Mg2+-dependent increase in Trp fluorescence of G34DTnCF29W (▴). G34DTnCF29W exhibited a half-maximal increase in Trp fluorescence at 295 ± 10 μm. However, addition of Mg2+ (up to 50 mm) caused no change in the Trp fluorescence signal of TnCF29W (Fig. 3 A, ▪). Thus, as expected, the G34D mutation in TnCF29W incorporates physiological Mg2+ binding to the first EF-hand of TnCF29W. Fig. 3 B shows that in the presence of 10 μm[Ca2+]free the Trp fluorescence signal of TnC1–90F29W (●), TnCF29W(▪), and G34DTnCF29W (▴) was greater than 90% saturated, which Mg2+ subsequently decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. Mg2+half-maximally decreased the Trp fluorescence of TnC1–90F29W, TnCF29W and G34DTnCF29W at 7.3 ± 0.8, 9 ± 1, and 1.9 ± 0.2 mm, respectively. Thus, the Ca2+-dependent fluorescence of TnC1–90F29W ,TnCF29W, and G34DTnCF29W was reversed by Mg2+ binding, presumably because of the closing of the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket of TnC and not because of any type of interference from Mg2+ binding to the C-terminal domain. Knowing the K d(Ca) for each N-terminal domain protein (determined as described later) and assuming competitive Mg2+ binding, the K d(Mg) of TnC1–90F29W, TnCF29W, and G34DTnCF29W was calculated to be ∼1.8 mm, 2.2 mm, and 303 μm, respectively. Thus, the calculated Mg2+ affinity for G34DTnCF29W was identical to that measured directly as described above. Furthermore, even though TnCF29W does not undergo a change in fluorescence upon Mg2+ binding (Fig.3 A, ▪) its N-terminal domain appears to bind Mg2+ and displace Ca2+. TableI summarizes the data for Mg2+ binding to TnCF29W and G34DTnCF29W.Table ISummary of Mg2+ binding to TnCF29W and G43D TnCF29W following the change in Trp fluorescenceDirect Mg2+bindingCompetitive Mg2+ binding kd,Mg(μm)K dn Hk offk on↑[Mg2+] 10 μm Ca2+↑[Ca2+] 3 mm Mg2+↑[Ca2+] 3 mm Mg2+ + TnI96–148μms−1×106m−1 s−1TnCF29WNA1-aNA, because TnCF29Wfluorescence was not affected by direct Mg2+ binding these values were not available (NA).NANANA220038006200G34DTnCF29W295 ± 101.03 ± 0.02570 ± 151.93035907141-a NA, because TnCF29Wfluorescence was not affected by direct Mg2+ binding these values were not available (NA). Open table in a new tab Fluorescence stopped-flow measurements were done to determine the rate of Mg2+ dissociation from G34DTnCF29W. Fig.3 C shows the time course of the EDTA-induced decrease in Trp fluorescence for G34DTnCF29W. At 15 °C, EDTA dissociated Mg2+ from G34DTnCF29W at 570 ± 15 s−1. There was no change in Trp fluorescence when the same experiment was performed with TnCF29W because Mg2+ binding to the N-terminal sites of TnCF29Wdoes not lead to a change in the Trp fluorescence. The Ca2+ binding affinities of TnCF29W and G34DTnCF29W were measured following the Ca2+ induced increases in Trp fluorescence in the absence and presence of 3 mm Mg2+ at 15 °C. Fig. 4 A shows that in the absence of Mg2+, TnCF29W (■) and G34DTnCF29W (▵) exhibited half-maximal Ca2+-dependent increases in Trp fluorescence at 3.3 ± 0.1 and 1.9 ± 0.1 μm Ca2+, respectively. Therefore, in the absence of Mg2+, G34DTnCF29W exhibited an ∼1.7-fold increase in its Ca2+ affinity, relative to that of TnCF29W. Fig. 4 A also shows that in the presence of 3 mmMg2+, TnCF29W (▪) and G34DTnCF29W(▴) exhibited half-maximal increases in Trp fluorescence at 5.9 ± 0.4 and 11.6 ± 0.9 μm Ca2+, respectively. Therefore, in the presence of 3 mmMg2+, G34DTnCF29W exhibited an ∼2-fold decrease in its Ca2+ sensitivity, relative to that of TnCF29W. Furthermore, 3 mm Mg2+shifts the Ca2+ sensitivity of TnCF29W and G34DTnCF29W ∼1.8- and 6-fold, respectively. Again, assuming competitive Mg2+ binding, theK d(Mg) of TnCF29W and G34DTnCF29W was ∼3.8 mm and 590 μm, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the direct and co"

Microbiol. 2001; 48: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The life cycle ofGiardia lamblia is initiated by excystation, a highly regulated differentiation which is required for transmission (3Boucher S-E.M. Gillin F.D. Infect.

Parasitol. 1998; 88: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that second messengers are central for its regulation. Cell signaling is poorly understood in the lower eukaryotes. Recently, we reported that protein kinase A activity may play a role in initiating excystation (8Abel E.S. Davids B.J. Robles L.D. Loflin C.E. Gillin F.D. Chakrabarti R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10320-10329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here, we tested thehypothesis that subsequent trophozoite emergence from the cyst wall and cytokinesis may require calcium signaling pathways. G. lamblia is a major cause of water-borne intestinal disease whose basic biology is not well understood, although a genome project is in progress (9Adam R.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 706-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 11Feely D.E. Erlandsen S.L. J.

Olsen G.E. Aley S.B. Adam R. Gillin F.D. Sogin M.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 189: 271-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of the parasite to undergo complex differentiations in response to signals from the host is key to its pathogenesis. Like most intestinal parasites, G. lambliahas a dormant cystic form that persists outside the host and is responsible for transmission when ingested (1Despommier D.D. Karapelou J.W. Parasite Life Cycles. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1987Google Scholar, 2Eichinger D. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 2001; 48: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 13Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Excystation in response to host gastrointestinal stimuli releases active trophozoites that colonize the small intestine and can cause disease (1Despommier D.D. Karapelou J.W. Parasite Life Cycles. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1987Google Scholar, 3Boucher S-E.M. Gillin F.D. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3516-3522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bingham A.K. Meyer E.A. Nature. 1979; 227: 301-302Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although exposure to gastric acid is required to trigger excystation ofG. lamblia (5Bingham A.K. Meyer E.A. Nature. 1979; 227: 301-302Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar), if the cyst wall should open in the stomach, the parasite within would be killed. On the other hand, upon passage into the small intestine, Giardia must quickly emerge from the cyst wall, polarize, and re-assemble its adhesive disc and flagella in order to attach and not be carried away by the flow of intestinal fluid. At the same time, the “excyzoite” is becoming metabolically active and dividing into two binucleate trophozoites (7Hetsko M.L. McCaffery J.M. Svard S.G. Meng T.-C. Que X. Gillin F.D. Exp. Parasitol. 1998; 88: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14Bernander R. Palm J.E.D. Svärd S.G. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Upon ingestion, G. lamblia cysts are exposed to extreme changes in osmolarity (from fresh water to isotonic conditions), to temperature increases of up to 33 °C, and to drastic decrease in pH (from ∼5 to 6 in fresh water to ∼2.0 in the human stomach). After the gastric acid is neutralized, the pH of the small intestine is slightly alkaline (∼7.5 to 8.0). Excystation in vitro models the passage of the cyst from fresh cold water through the human stomach and into the small intestine where resumption of trophozoite motility, emergence from the wall, cytokinesis, and attachment occur (3Boucher S-E.M. Gillin F.D. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3516-3522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Rice E.W. Schaefer III., F.W. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1981; 14: 709-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This paradigm allows dissection of responses to individual signals and crucial triggering and emergence stages. Although the external stimuli for giardial excystation are identified (5Bingham A.K. Meyer E.A. Nature. 1979; 227: 301-302Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15Rice E.W. Schaefer III., F.W. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1981; 14: 709-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanism(s) by which the signals are transduced are not known. We showed previously that exposure of cysts to the gastric pH and temperature that trigger excystation (“Stage I”) lead to decreased cytoplasmic pH, mRNA changes, and novel cytoplasmic re-arrangements that may establish cellular polarity (7Hetsko M.L. McCaffery J.M. Svard S.G. Meng T.-C. Que X. Gillin F.D. Exp. Parasitol. 1998; 88: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Signals modeling the small intestine (“Stage II”) then lead to degradation of cyst wall proteins and increased cytosolic pH (7Hetsko M.L. McCaffery J.M. Svard S.G. Meng T.-C. Que X. Gillin F.D. Exp. Parasitol. 1998; 88: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In cells of later diverging eukaryotes, the flow of information between the extra- and intracellular environment is frequently mediated by rapid, transient changes in free intracellular Ca2+. Ca2+ acts as a powerful second messenger, because its levels are regulated within narrow limits by channels, pumps, and specific Ca2+-binding proteins. Ca2+ is also sequestered within internal storage compartments, mainly the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1(16Chin D. Means A.R.

This pump also retrieves Ca2+ that has leaked into the cytosol and is critical for Ca2+ homeostasis and cell function (17Guerini D. Carafoli E. Carafoli E. Klee C. Calcium as a Cellular Regulator. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 249-278Google Scholar). Many of the actions of Ca2+ in later eukaryotes are mediated by the calcium-binding protein, CaM (16Chin D. Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). CaM and its signaling cascades are highly conserved from fungi to mammals, and blocking CaM signaling arrests these cells in the G1 or G2 phase of the cell cycle (20Wang J. Moreira K.M. Campos B. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21Joseph J.D. Means A.R. J. Biol.

However, giardial cysts are quadrinucleate, reported to be 16N, and to undergo two rounds of cytokinesis after excystation before re-entering the cell cycle (14Bernander R. Palm J.E.D. Svärd S.G. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Munoz et al. (22Munoz M.L. Weinbach E.C. Wieder S.C. Claggett C.E. Levenbook L. Exp. Parasitol. 1987; 63: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) have purified giardial (g)CaM and shown that it resembled bovine CaM biochemically. They also reported that CaM antagonists inhibit excystation of fecal Giardiacysts (23Bernal R.M. Tovar R. Santos J.I. Munoz M.D.L. Parasitol. Res. 1998; 84: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the roles of cytoplasmic Ca2+ homeostasis and CaM in giardial excystation. G. lambliatrophozoites (strain WB, clone C6, ATCC 50803) were cultured, encysted, and excysted as described (3Boucher S-E.M. Gillin F.D. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3516-3522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, trophozoites and incomplete cysts were lysed by incubation in double distilled water for 20 min at room temperature. Water-resistant cysts were washed and stored in distilled water at 4 °C overnight (pre-excystation). In Stage I of excystation, cysts were exposed to HCl, pH 4.0, with cysteine and reduced glutathione for 20 min at 37 °C. In Stage II, acid-treated cysts were washed and treated with trypsin in pH 8.0 bicarbonate-buffered Tyrode's solution for 60 min at 37 °C (7Hetsko M.L. McCaffery J.M. Svard S.G. Meng T.-C. Que X. Gillin F.D. Exp. Parasitol. 1998; 88: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Rice E.W. Schaefer III., F.W. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1981; 14: 709-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in TYI-S-33 growth medium at 37 °C for 30 min. Emerged motile trophozoites were enumerated in hemocytometer chambers using differential interference contrast microscopy. The percent excystation was calculated as the sum of the motile trophozoites and partially emerged trophozoites × 100, divided by the initial number of viable cysts with type I morphology (3Boucher S-E.M. Gillin F.D. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3516-3522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibitors were dissolved in double-distilled water, ethanol, or Me2SO and diluted into water (pre-excystation) or excystation solutions. Solvent was the control in each case. For initial screening and determination of 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of active compounds, each inhibitor was present for a 1-h preincubation at 4 °C and added again during Stages I and II of excystation, because cysts were pelleted between stages. Inhibitors were not included in the emergence step to avoid possible effects on trophozoites. Viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion and by differential interference contrast microscopy (3Boucher S-E.M. Gillin F.D. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3516-3522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the specific stage(s) at which each inhibitor acted, cysts were preincubated with the inhibitor (generally at greater than IC50 concentration) in water for 1 h at 4 °C, or during Stage I, or Stage II of excystation (8Abel E.S.

The % excystation in the presence of each agent was normalized to the solvent controls for each experiment. Data shown are mean (± S.D.) for at least two independent experiments. p values were calculated by paired two-tailed Student's t test with the normalized comparison value set at 100% for excystation in solvent controls (3Boucher S-E.M.

G. lamblia were cultured to the appropriate life cycle stages and then harvested and washed twice by centrifugation in HEPES buffered saline (HBS: 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and labeled by incubating in 2 ml of HBS containing 1 μmIndo-1/AM at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were then washed with HBS, suspended to 6 × 105, and seeded on 22-mm glass coverslips placed in a 37 °C chamber containing HBS. Groups of 15–30 G. lamblia were viewed using an inverted Nikon Diaphot microscope. Fluorometric measurements were collected using the DX-1000 System (Solamere Technology, Salt Lake City, UT), where the field was excited at 385 nm and the emission ratio was collected at 405 and 495 nm, as described previously (24Lorell B.H.

Ca2+concentrations were calculated using Equation 1, [Ca2+]i=Kd(R−Rmin)/(Rmax−R)(β)Equation 1 In this equation, R was the ratio at any time, andR min, R max, and β were determined by the ratio of fluorescence under Ca2+-depleted (+EGTA) and Ca2+-saturated (+ionomycin) conditions. The Ca2+ dissociation constant, K d, was determined for this dye and optics at 37 °C to be 250 nm. Pharmacological agents were diluted from 1000× stocks. Parasites were harvested by gentle scraping and resuspended at 107/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were labeled using 500 μm BODIPY-TG (26Zhong L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12994-12998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C in an 8-well chamber coverslip slide. The unattached cells were removed, and PBS was replaced with encystation medium and a coverslip. Live parasites were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with an argon-krypton (455:488) laser and appropriate filter set. Preliminary BLASTX annotation of single-pass reads in the Giardia Genome Project data base (www.mbl.edu/Giardia) indicated that clone EJ2820 contained a likely CaM homologue. Complete coding information for theGiardia calmodulin ORF was obtained by directed sequencing of EJ2820. We amplified the clone insert using PCR and primers specific to the Giardia sequences, and then sequenced this product completely using a LICOR automated scanner (27Middendorf L.R. Bruce J.C.

The sequence has since been confirmed by additional random sequence data from the genome project data base and by sequencing constructs. The CaM amino acid alignment was produced using the ClustalW WWW Service at the European Bioinformatics Institute (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw).

Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9589) Google Scholar). Plasmid pNLop2-GItetR was digested by XhoI andSalI and then self-ligated to generate pNLop2. The gCaM gene with its 5′-untranslated region was amplified from genomic DNA using PCR and oligonucleotides CM5NF (GGCGGCTAGCGGTAGAATTAAAATTCAGAA) and CMAUMR (GGCGCAATTGTTAGATGTATCGATACGTATCCCTCCTGCAGAGTATCTTTACGA), digested with NheI/MfeI, and ligated in place of the NheI/EcoRI-excised luciferase gene and 32-bp ran promoter and two copies of a 19-bp tet operator sequence in pNLop2 (30Sun C.H.

The resulting plasmid pNCM contains the gCaM gene controlled by its own promoter with an AU1 tag fused at the C terminus. Cells were transfected with pNCM and selected with G418 as described (31Sun C.H. Chou C.F. Tai J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and stable transfectants were maintained in G418 (600 μg/ml). pNCM transfectants were harvested after 24 h in growth or encystation media with G418, washed in PBS, and attached to glass coverslips (2 × 106 cells/coverslip), then fixed and stained for indirect immunofluorescence assay (8Abel E.S.

Cells were reacted with anti-AU1 monoclonal antibodies (Covance, Princeton, NJ, 1:300 in blocking buffer), which was detected with anti-mouse ALEXA 568 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, 1:500 in blocking buffer). Localization of gCaM was observed on a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with argon/krypton (455:488) and helium/neon (543:633) lasers and appropriate filter sets. Our initial findings that excystation was strongly (>70%) inhibited by decreasing free extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA (5 mm) or by buffering intracellular free Ca2+ with 5 mmBAPTA-AM (Calbiochem) suggested a central role for Ca2+homeostasis. BAPTA-AM crosses the plasmalemma because of its acetomethoxy group, which is hydrolyzed by cellular esterases. The charged BAPTA molecule is kept within the cytoplasm where it chelates cytosolic free Ca2+ (32Tsien R.Y. Carafoli E. Klee C. Calcium as a Cellular Regulator. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 28-54Google Scholar). We tested the hypothesis that Ca2+ homeostasis might be important for excystation and that Giardia may be particularly susceptible to perturbation of Ca2+ during the cellular activation that occurs late in excystation (Stage II). We found that verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker that should lower cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations (33Balakumaran A. Campbell G.A. Moslen M.T. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 139: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), strongly inhibited excystation. The IC50 for verapamil when it was present throughout excystation was 49 μm. No inhibition was observed when verapamil (100 μm) was present only during pre-excystation or Stage I, but it inhibited >75% in Stage II (Fig. 1 A). Ionomycin is a carboxylic ionophore (34Kachintorn U. Vongkovit P. Vajanaphanich M. Dinh S. Barrett K.E. Dharmasathaphorn K. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C15-C22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and A23187 is a Ca2+-selective carboxylic ionophore that stimulates Ca2+-dependent biological reactions without disturbing Na+ or K+ gradients (35Wentzell B. Epand R.M. FEBS Lett. 1978; 86: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These two Ca2+ ionophores should greatly increase cytoplasmic Ca2+ by allowing influx of Ca2+ from the medium. Ionomycin (1 μm) and A23187 (1 μm) were also most inhibitory in Stage II, although they also inhibited significantly in Stage I (Fig. 1, B and C). When each ionophore was present throughout excystation, the IC50for ionomycin was 38 nm and for A23187 the IC50was 126 nm. The idea that these inhibitors were acting specifically was supported by 45Ca uptake studies (data not shown). Ionomycin increased the rate of 45Ca uptake by ∼2.5-fold, relative to solvent controls. Measurements of intracellular Ca2+ levels (see below) confirmed that ionomycin functions as a Ca2+ ionophore inGiardia cysts and trophozoites, because we calibrated each trace with ionomycin to obtain the R max needed to calculate intracellular levels of Ca2+. In most eukaryotic cells, Ca2+ pump activity due to SERCA is specifically inhibited by the sesquiterpene lactone, TG (36Guerini D. Guidi F. Carafoli E. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The addition of 5 μm TG (Calbiochem) to Indo-1 loaded trophozoites, cysts, or excysting cells produced an immediate and sustained rise in Indo-1 fluorescence, corresponding to an increase in free intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 2 A). The traces shown in Fig. 2 A are qualitative in nature and do not allow for accurate comparisons across all stages, due to differences in calibration values (see “Experimental Procedures”). Therefore, we converted all fluorescence ratio data to nanomolar cytosolic Ca2+levels. Giardia maintain a low basal cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, ranging from 40 to 85 nm(data not shown). The data in Fig. 2 B show that the addition of TG caused significant increases in cytosolic Ca2+levels. The effect of TG did not depend on extracellular Ca2+, because similar data were obtained when Indo-1-labeled cells were resuspended briefly in Ca2+-free medium containing 0.3 mm EGTA (data not shown). This indicates that the source of the elevated Ca2+ is an intracellular Ca2+ store dependent on a TG-sensitive, presumably SERCA-like pump. Under the conditions of our experiments, we did not detect significant changes in the basal Ca2+ levels during excystation (data not shown). Excysting cells in all stages exhibited an increase in intracellular Ca2+ in response to TG. Moreover, the magnitude of peak TG-induced Ca2+ release increased with progression through excystation (Fig. 2 B). The peak effect of TG was lowest in the dormant cyst form (656 ± 66 nm), intermediate in Stage I (1158 ± 108 nm) and Stage II (1035 ± 92 nm) excysting cells, and greatest in newly excysted cells (1577 ± 116 nm), which were similar to trophozoites (1517 ± 234 nm). The effect of TG on cysts was significantly lower and on trophozoites and excyzoites was higher than in all other stages (p < 0.05). TG inhibition of excystation also increased during the course of differentiation. The IC50 for TG when present throughout excystation was 7 μm. TG at 10 μmsignificantly inhibited giardial excystation only during Stage II (Fig. 3). However, inhibition by TG was greater when it was present in both Stages I and II, in contrast to the other inhibitors that did not show any additive effects (not shown). The lower response of non-induced cysts to TG may be because this is a dormant form or because of lower penetration into the intact cyst wall. However, giardial cysts (Fig. 4) stained with fluorescent TG, which localized to a likely Ca2+storage compartment, resembling the ER (37McCaffery J.M. Gillin F.D. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 220-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), by confocal microscopy. Taken together, our data suggest that function of a TG-sensitive calcium storage compartment resembling the SERCA pump-leak system is important in regulation of giardial excystation.Figure 4Giardia cyst stained with BODIPY-labeled TG.

Differential interference contrast and confocal fluorescence image.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We found that three specific CaM inhibitors (38Gauthier M.L. O'Day D.H. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) blocked excystation (Fig. 5). The calculated IC50values are as follows: chlorpromazine 28 μm, trifluoperazine ∼15 μm (Fig. 5), and calmidazolium 1 μm (data not shown) (23Bernal R.M. Tovar R. Santos J.I. Munoz M.D.L. Parasitol. Res. 1998; 84: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 38Gauthier M.L. O'Day D.H. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), when present throughout excystation. These inhibitors may also primarily affect parasite emergence from the cyst wall, because they were most effective during the late stage that models cyst arrival in the host small intestine (Fig. 5). We sequenced a giardial CaM gene (GenBankTMAAK97377 ) from a genomic DNA clone identified by the Giardia Genome Project (Fig. 6). Searching this data base (www.mbl.edu/Giardia) for additional homologues by BLAST, using bovine CaM as the query sequence, did not reveal other giardial CaM homologues but only previously reported centrin/caltractin genes in the CaM family with p values <10−37 and 3 × 10−37 (39Meng T.-C.

Several A- or A-T-rich regions typical of giardial initiator sequences are upstream of the start of translation of gCaM and a slightly divergent putative giardial polyadenylation signal, GGTAAAT (consensus: AGTRAAY, overlaps with the stop codon (data not shown)), which is not unusual for Giardia(10Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the gCaM gene has a completely overlapping ORF, with no known homologues, on the opposite strand. Both the gCaM gene and the antisense ORF are transcribed during growth and differentiation (not shown). This is also not unusual forGiardia (40Knodler L.A. Svärd S.G. Silberman J.D. Davids B.J. Gillin F.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Southern analyses also showed thatGiardia CaM is a single copy gene (data not shown). This is important because the gCaM we cloned differs in amino acid composition from CaM purified from giardial extracts by Munoz et al.(22Munoz M.L. Weinbach E.C. Wieder S.C. Claggett C.E.

To understand how the functions of Gro/TLE proteins are regulated, it was asked whether their ability to mediate transcriptional repression might be controlled by cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation events. It is shown here that activation of p34cdc2 kinase (cdc2) with okadaic acid is correlated with hyperphosphorylation of Gro/TLEs.

Deletion of these sequences is correlated with loss of Gro/TLE phosphorylation by cdc2 in vitro and okadaic acid-induced Gro/TLE hyperphosphorylation in vivo. In addition, Gro/TLEs are phosphorylated during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and this is correlated with a decreased nuclear interaction. Finally, the transcription repression ability of Gro/TLEs is enhanced by pharmacological inhibition of cdc2.

By virtue of these multiple interactions, the general transcription repression activity of Gro/TLE proteins can be recruited in context-dependent manners to specific target genes. Transcriptional repression by Gro/TLE family members is thought to be mediated by at least two mechanisms. Oligomeric Gro/TLEs can interact with both histones (26Palaparti A. Baratz A. Stifani S. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1410-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), consistent with a process in which recruitment of Gro/TLEs to DNA may result in the removal of acetyl groups from the amino-terminal domains of histones. In turn, this is thought to result in the establishment of a compact chromatin structure that is not amenable to gene activation. In addition, recent work (31Yu X., Li, P. Roeder R.G. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4614-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) has raised the possibility that Gro/TLE proteins may target the activity of the basal transcriptional machinery through interaction with the TFIIE factor. This possibility is consistent with the observation that the protein TUP1, a general corepressor thought to represent the functional analog of Gro/TLEs in yeast (27Flores-Saaib R.D. Courey A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4189-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32Grbavec D., Lo, R. Liu Y. Greenfield A. Stifani S. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), interacts with RNA polymerase II holoenzyme components and can repress transcription in vitro (33Gromoller A. Lehming N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 34Redd M.J. Arnaud M.B. Johnson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11193-11197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Little is presently known about the mechanisms that control the transcription repression ability of Gro/TLEs. In that regard, recent studies (17Nuthall H.N. Husain J. McLarren K.W. Stifani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have implicated phosphorylation events induced by cofactor binding in promoting Gro/TLE activity. In particular, interaction of Gro/TLEs with the Hes and RUNX family members, Hes1 and RUNX1, results not only in the recruitment of Gro/TLEs to DNA but also in their hyperphosphorylation. Hes1-induced hyperphosphorylation is correlated with an increase in the affinity of Gro/TLEs with the nuclear compartment, likely the result of the establishment of a strong interaction with chromatin components. Protein kinase CK2 is involved in the Hes1-induced hyperphosphorylation of Gro/TLEs, and inhibition of protein kinase CK2 activity reduces the transcription repression ability of Gro/TLEs (17Nuthall H.N. Husain J. McLarren K.W. Stifani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These findings underscore the importance of phosphorylation events in the functions of Gro/TLE proteins. To examine further the mechanisms involved in the regulation of Gro/TLE activity, we have tested the possibility that these factors may be dynamically phosphorylated during the cell cycle. Our results show that Gro/TLEs are phosphorylated by p34cdc2 kinase (cdc2), a master regulator of the G2/M transition and entry into mitosis (35Ohi R. Gould K.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with the presence of conserved motifs resembling phosphorylation sites for cdc2 within all Gro/TLE family members. Our findings also suggest that mitotic phosphorylation of Gro/TLEs reduces their ability to mediate transcriptional repression by weakening their interaction with nuclei. Together, these observations provide new insights into the regulation of the phosphorylation state and functions of Gro/TLE proteins. Drosophila S2, rat ROS17/2.8, and human HEK 293 (“293A”), HeLa, and Jurkat cells were cultured as described previously (16McLarren K.W. Theriault F.M. Stifani S. J. Biol.

Cells were then collected, and whole-cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blotting analysis of either endogenous Gro/TLE or transfected GAL4bd-Gro/TLE1 proteins. Expression of GAL4bd-Gro/TLE1(full-length) was driven by the plasmid pcDNA3- GAL4bd-Gro/TLE1 as described previously (15Grbavec D., Lo, R. Liu Y. Stifani S. Eur. J.

For analysis of Gro/TLE1 deletion mutants, the plasmids pcDNA3-GAL4bd- Gro/TLE1(Δ258–268), GAL4bd-Gro/TLE1(Δ285–335), and GAL4bd-Gro/TLE1(Δ258–335) were obtained by first generating the sequences containing the appropriate deletions using PCR-based strategies (information on oligonucleotide primers is available upon request), followed by subcloning into pBluescript(SK) plasmid and DNA sequencing. The verified deletion products were then subcloned into pcDNA3- GAL4bd-Gro/TLE1 digested with BstEII and SacII, replacing the corresponding wild type sequence. HeLa cells were labeled with [32P]Pi as described previously (36Husain J., Lo, R. Grbavec D. Stifani S. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For cell synchronization at G2/M, exponentially growing HeLa cells were treated for 10–16 h with nocodazole as described (40Zieve G.W. Turnbull D. Mullins J.M. McIntosh J.R. Exp.

After this time, mitotically enriched cells that were loosely attached or floating were collected by gentle pipetting, whereas adherent cells were not collected. This protocol was shown to yield greater than 80% of cells with a DNA content corresponding to the G2/M phase, with most of these cells being in mitosis (42De Lucia F. Lorain S. Scamps C. Galisson F.

For phosphorylation assays with native Gro/TLE proteins, Drosophila Gro or human Gro/TLE1 was immunoprecipitated from S2 or HeLa whole-cell lysates, respectively, as described previously and in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 (17Nuthall H.N. Husain J. McLarren K.W. Stifani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 36Husain J., Lo, R. Grbavec D. Stifani S. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were washed with ice-cold buffer D (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100). Each kinase assay contained either roughly 50 ng of purified fusion protein or the product of one immunoprecipitation. Samples were resuspended in buffer E (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 200 μm ATP) containing 200 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 2 units of purified cdc2-cyclin B complex per reaction. After incubating for 30 min at 37 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and incubation at 65 °C for 5 min, followed by gel electrophoresis and either autoradiography or Western blotting analysis. Alternatively, the products of kinase reactions with bacterially purified fusion proteins were loaded onto SpinZyme phosphocellulose units (Pierce) and centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 30 s. The filters were then extensively washed with 75 mm phosphoric acid and dried. Bound radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. Preparation of whole-cell lysates was as described previously (17Nuthall H.N. Husain J. McLarren K.W. Stifani S. Mol. Cell.

Post-nuclear supernatant and nuclear fractions were prepared by first washing the cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, followed by resuspension for 10 s in ice-cold buffer A (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× “Complete” protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Cells were quickly collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 packed cell pellet volumes of buffer A, incubated on ice for 10 min, followed by trituration through a 25-gauge needle. The homogenate received 0.5 cell pellet volumes of buffer B (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 1m KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture) and was mixed thoroughly, followed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 1 min to remove debris. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 1,500 ×g for 15 min to yield a supernatant fraction (post-nuclear supernatant) and a crude nuclear pellet. The nuclear pellet was washed twice by resuspending in buffer A and centrifuging at 1,500 ×g for 15 min. This was followed by resuspension in 3–5 volumes of buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture). After centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 15 min, the supernatant fraction was collected (nuclear extract). Whole-cell lysates, post-nuclear supernatants, and nuclear extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by either autoradiography or Western blotting as described (16McLarren K.W. Theriault F.M.

Transcription assays were performed using 0.5 μg of reporter construct p5xGAL4UAS-tk-luciferase in the presence or absence of plasmids pcDNA3-GAL4bd, pcDNA3-GAL4bd-Gro/TLE1, or pGAL4bd-HDAC4 (46Wang A.H.

In each case, 0.5 μg of the β-galactosidase reporter plasmid, pRSV-βgal, was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were treated or not treated with roscovitine (10 μm) or olomoucine (20 μm), cultured for a further 24 h, and then subjected to determination of luciferase activity as described (15Grbavec D., Lo, R.

Because the functions of several transcription factors are negatively regulated during mitosis by phosphorylation mechanisms that control their interaction with chromatin and/or other nuclear structures, we examined whether Gro/TLEs are phosphorylated at mitosis. This possibility was also suggested by the presence of several possible phosphorylation sites for cdc2 within all Gro/TLE family members (38Stifani S. Blaumueller C.M. Redhead N.J. Hill R.E.

When the cells overexpressing PHGPx (L9 cells) were pretreated with diethyl maleate, which reduces PHGPx activity, PAF synthesis uponA23187 stimulation rose to levels seen in mock-transfected cells (S1 cells). Hydroperoxide levels, which are reduced in L9 cells, are involved in regulating PAF synthesis, because the addition of hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid increased PAF production inA23187-stimulated L9 cells to control cell levels. The activity of acetyl-CoA:1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine acetyltransferase, which is involved in the last step of PAF synthesis, is also reduced in L9 cells. p38 kinase inhibitors block acetyltransferase activity in normal A23187-stimulated cells, suggesting that p38 kinase is involved in regulating acetyltransferase activity. Recombinant active p38 kinase activates acetyltransferase, whereas alkaline phosphatase reverses this, suggesting p38 kinase directly phosphorylates acetyltransferase. p38 kinase phosphorylation is blocked in L9 cells, indicating that high hydroperoxide levels are needed for the activation of p38 kinase. Thus, intracellular hydroperoxide levels participate in regulating p38 kinase phosphorylation, which in turn controls the activation of acetyltransferase and thus the synthesis of PAF.

PAF is involved in numerous biological responses. Consequently, PAF is recognized as a major mediator that plays a central role in a variety of host defense system mechanisms and inflammatory diseases (1Patel K.D. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M.

In inflammatory cells, the remodeling pathway appears to be involved in synthesizing most of the PAF that is generated in response to a variety of stimuli. In this pathway, a phospholipase A2 (PLA2), such as cytosolic phospholipase A2, hydrolyzes 1-alkyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine to 1-alkyl-2-lyso-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lyso-PAF), thereby liberating arachidonic acid. Lyso-PAF is then acetylated by acetyl-CoA:lyso-PAF acetyltransferase to generate PAF. As acetyl-CoA:lyso-PAF acetyltransferase is unstable, it is difficult to purify, and consequently little is known about the enzyme. However, the use of rat spleen (5Lenihan D.J. Lee T.C. Biochem.

In aerobic cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as the superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxy radicals, are constantly formed as a result of mitochondrial respiration and reactions catalyzed by enzymes such as NADH/NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, monooxidases, and cyclooxygenase. The ROS-mediated damage to intracellular molecules is limited by cellular antioxidant enzymes such as phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx), classical glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase. The glutathione peroxidases, which include four different selenoenzymes, are known for their ability to reduce organic and inorganic hydroperoxides (12Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Annu. Rev.

Of these enzymes, PHGPx is capable of directly reducing peroxidized lipids that have been produced in cell membranes and lipoproteins (14Ursini F. Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Biochim. Biophys.

Although direct evidence for the involvement of GPx in the production of PAF is still lacking, it has been shown that selenium deficiency, which causes a drop in GPx activity along with a corresponding rise in hydroperoxide levels (23Bryant R.W.

Jaffe E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1006: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that oxidative stress could modulate PAF synthesis and/or that scavenger enzymes could regulate the activity of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of PAF. Supporting the latter option is that PHGPx can interact with biomembrane in which the synthesis of PAF occurs. On the basis of these observations, we asked whether PHGPx can regulate PAF synthesis. To do this, we used RBL-2H3 cells that overexpress the non-mitochondrial form of PHGPx and show here that PAF synthesis in these cells is significantly suppressed. Intracellular hydroperoxide levels are reduced in PHGPx-overexpressing cells, as is acetyltransferase activity. We found p38 kinase was not activated in stimulated PHGPx-overexpressing cells, and experiments showed that this MAPK directly phosphorylates acetyltransferase. Thus, hydroperoxide levels affect the intracellular signal transduction system involving p38 MAPK and thereby modulate PAF synthesis. Mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for phosphorylated ERK, p38 kinase, and phosphorylated MKK3/6 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phosphorylated p38 kinase-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc.

We used the previously established L9 cells, which overexpress non-mitochondrial PHGPx, together with the S1 control cell line (20Nomura K. Imai H. Koumura T. Kobayashi T. Nakagawa Y. Biochem.

Both lines were derived from the RBL-2H3 rat basophilic leukemia cell line and were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Aliquots of 1 × 106 cells/ml were transferred to fresh medium when the cells had reached semi-confluence. PAF accumulation was measured as the incorporation of [3H]acetic acid as described previously (28Nakagawa Y. Sugai M. Karasawa K. Tokumura A. Tsukatani H. Setaka M. Nojima S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, culture medium was removed from 1.7 × 106 cells in a 3.5-cm diameter dish and was replaced with 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (containing 1.3 mm Ca2+, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) that contained 370 kBq/ml [3H]acetic acid. Following a 10-min preincubation at 37 °C, cells were incubated with A23187 for the indicated period. The concentration of A23187 was 5 μm unless otherwise indicated. The incubation was terminated by adding 1.5 ml of methanol containing 2% acetic acid. The cells were harvested, and total lipids were extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (29Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42871) Google Scholar). Each extract was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, and the residues were then dissolved in a small amount of a 2:1 v/v mixture of chloroform and methanol and applied to a TLC plate (Silica Gel 60 F254). The plate was developed with a 65:35:6 v/v mixture of chloroform, methanol, and H2O. The products and standards were visualized with primulin reagent, and the products were identified by comparison with chromatographic standards. PAF was then scraped from TLC plate, and the radioactivity incorporated into PAF was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Acetyltransferase activity was determined according to the method described by Nakagawaet al. (28Nakagawa Y. Sugai M. Karasawa K. Tokumura A. Tsukatani H. Setaka M. Nojima S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 106cells) were stimulated with A23187 in 2 ml of HBSS, and the reaction was terminated by adding 0.5 ml of ice-cold 10 mm HEPES buffer. The cells were harvested and sonicated in HEPES buffer with a probe sonicator (20 s, 50 watts, model 5202; Ohtaka Works, Tokyo, Japan). The cell lysates (200 μl, about 100 μg of total protein) were then incubated with 200 μm[3H]acetyl-CoA (0.25 GBq/mmol) and 350 μmlyso-PAF in a total volume of 1 ml. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 20 min and terminated by adding 1.75 ml of ethanol containing 2% acetic acid. As described above, total lipids were extracted and dried, and the residues were dissolved in a small amount of chloroform and methanol, after which they were applied to a TLC plate (Silica Gel 60 F254). The plate was developed and PAF scraped from the TLC plate, and its radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Enzyme activities were calculated from the radioactivity of PAF. Cells (1.5 × 106 cells) were incubated with [1-14C]arachidonic acid (1.85 kBq, 0.42 μm) in 2 ml of culture medium for 24 h at 37 °C. Labeled cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. The cells were preincubated for 10 min in HBSS and then stimulated with 5 μmA23187 for 10 min. The release of radiolabeled arachidonic acid was determined as described previously (30Sakamoto H. Kitahara J. Nakagawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 106cells) were activated with A23187, harvested, washed with PBS, and lysed with lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 trypsin inhibitor unit/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate in PBS). Proteins (30 μg) from the lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel as described by Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar), after which they were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane filter (ATTO Instruments, Tokyo, Japan) at 2 mA/cm2 for 1 h in 100 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 5% (v/v) methanol in a protein-transfer system (ATTO), as described previously (22Sakamoto H. Imai H. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40028-40035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The PVDF membrane bearing the blotted proteins was blocked for 2 h by incubation with 3% (w/v) defatted milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) that contained 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T). The membrane was then incubated for 1.5 h with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phosphorylated p38 kinase or mouse monoclonal antibodies against phosphorylated ERK, p38 kinase, or phosphorylated MKK3/6 that had been diluted with TBS-T to an appropriate concentration. After the PVDF membrane had been washed twice with TBS-T, it was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies against rabbit or mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco). The binding of the antibodies to antigens on the PVDF membrane was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting analysis system (AmershamBiosciences). Cells (3 × 107 cells) were washed twice with PBS, harvested, and centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The pellets were suspended in 2 ml of sucrose buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm imidazole, and 0.1% (v/v) ethanol that contained 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm antipain, 10 μm chymostatin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 7.2)) and homogenized in a Teflon/glass Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. Subcellular fractions were obtained by differential centrifugation according to the method described by Arai et al. (19Arai M. Imai H. Koumura T. Yoshida M. Emoto K. Umeda M. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4924-4933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Proteins (50 μg) in either the mitochondrial or the microsomal fractions from quiescent cells were immediately incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a final volume of 40 μl containing 1 μm recombinant p38 kinase, 50 μm Mg2+, 50 μm ATP, and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). Recombination p38 kinase was activated by the incubation with ATP, which induces autophosphorylation of p38 kinase. To measure acetyltransferase activity, this mixture (40 μl) was incubated with 200 μm[3H]acetyl-CoA (0.25 GBq/mmol) and 350 μmlyso-PAF in a total volume of 700 μl. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 20 min and terminated by the addition of 1.75 ml of ethanol containing 2% acetic acid. As described above, total lipids were extracted, and the residues were dissolved in a small amount of chloroform and methanol before they were applied to a TLC plate (Silica Gel 60 F254). The plate was developed and PAF scraped from the TLC plate, and PAF radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Enzyme activities were calculated from the radioactivity of PAF. Concentrations of proteins were determined with Protein Assay Reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The production of PAF in RBL-2H3 cells that overexpress non-mitochondrial PHGPx (L9 cells) and in mock-transfected cells (S1 cells) was examined by incubating the cells with radioactive acetic acid and then determining the radioactivity of the resulting PAF (Fig. 1 A). S1 cells produced PAF when they were stimulated with A23187 as PAF levels were approximately four times higher in stimulated cells compared with unstimulated cells. In the cells overexpressing non-mitochondrial PHGPx, however, the production of PAF in response to A23187 stimulation was markedly inhibited (Fig. 1 A). To verify that PAF synthesis is suppressed in these cells because of the overexpression of PHGPx, we examined the effect of adding DEM (TableI). DEM reduces the activity of glutathione peroxidases such as classical glutathione peroxidase and PHGPx by lowering intracellular glutathione levels. In our experiments, DEM decreases intracellular glutathione levels in RBL-2H3 cells to about 5% that in untreated cells (30Sakamoto H. Kitahara J. Nakagawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). PAF synthesis in stimulated S1 cells was not altered by treatment with DEM, but in L9 cells, treatment with DEM markedly increased the production of PAF in response to A23187stimulation. The levels of PAF in DEM-treated L9 cells were 94% that in S1 cells. Thus, reduced PAF synthesis in L9 cells is indeed due to the excess PHGPx activity.Table IEffects of diethyl maleate on PAF synthesis by PHGPx-overexpressing cellsControl line of cellsPHGPx-overexpressing cellsdpm/10 6 cellsControl242 ± 33332 ± 1945 μmA23187, 10 min719 ± 92307 ± 70DEM + A23187695 ± 48656 ± 59Control cells (S1) and PHGPx-overexpressing cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with or without 1 mm DEM, after which they were labeled with [3H]acetic acid for 10 min. Labeled cells were stimulated with A23187 for 10 min, and PAF synthesis was determined. Data represent the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab Control cells (S1) and PHGPx-overexpressing cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with or without 1 mm DEM, after which they were labeled with [3H]acetic acid for 10 min. Labeled cells were stimulated with A23187 for 10 min, and PAF synthesis was determined. Data represent the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. To identify which step(s) of PAF synthesis is inhibited in L9 cells, the rate at which arachidonic acid is released from the membrane lipids, which indicates PLA2activity, and the activity of acetyl-CoA:lyso-PAF acetyltransferase were determined. S1 and L9 cells did not differ significantly in the release of arachidonic acid (Fig. 1 B). To clarify the effect on acetyltransferase activity of overexpressing PHGPx, we measured the activity of acetyltransferase in a cell-free system using cell lysates prepared from quiescent and A23187-stimulated cells. The cell lysates were incubated with lyso-PAF, the substrate of the acetyltransferase, and [3H]acetyl-CoA, whose radioactive acetyl group is transferred to lyso-PAF by the acetyltransferase. The radioactivity of the resulting PAF was then measured. In lysates of quiescent cells, the acetyltransferase activity of S1 and L9 cells did not differ significantly (Fig. 2 A). In the stimulated cell lysates, however, L9 cells showed little acetyltransferase activation, whereas in S1 cells, acetyltransferase activity increased over time, a maximum being reached within 5 min after A23187 stimulation, after which the activity slowly declined (Fig. 2 A). When we examined the effect of A23187 dose on acetyltransferase activity, we found maximal activity was observed in the lysate prepared from S1 cells stimulated with 5 μmA23187 but that the acetyltransferase activity remained profoundly suppressed in the L9 cell lysates regardless of the A23187concentrations we used (Fig. 2 B). Thus, acetyl-CoA:lyso-PAF acetyltransferase activity is inhibited in PHGPx-overexpressing cells. To determine whether insufficient levels of hydroperoxides in PHGPx-overexpressing cells could account for the suppression of PAF synthesis in these cells, we determined PAF levels in A23187-stimulated cells that had been preincubated with various concentrations of the fatty acid hydroperoxide 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HpETE), 15-HpETE, or of H2O2. Each hydroperoxide had no effect on PAF synthesis by S1 cells (Fig. 3,A, C, and E). In contrast, the addition of hydroperoxides significantly increased PAF synthesis in L9 cells and at a concentration of 0.1 ng/ml 12-HpETE, 0.05 ng/ml 15-HpETE, or 100 μm H2O2, synthesis had recovered to 90, 98, or 90% of the levels in stimulated S1 cells, respectively (Fig. 3, B, D, andF). Thus, inadequate levels of hydroperoxides in PHGPx-overexpressing cells inhibit PAF synthesis, apparently by blocking acetyltransferase activity. To determine the enzyme that is responsible for modulating acetyltransferase activity inA23187-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells, we examined the effect on PAF synthesis of pretreating RBL-2H3 cells with kinase inhibitors beforeA23187 stimulation. The inhibitors we chose selectively inhibit Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (KN-93), protein kinase C (H-7), MAPK/ERK kinase (PD98059 and U0126), and p38 kinase (SB203580 and SB202190). The PAF synthesis that occurs in RBL-2H3 cells after A23187 stimulation was abolished by treatment with the two p38 kinase blockers, but the other inhibitors had no effect (Fig. 4 A). The activation of acetyltransferase by A23187 treatment of RBL-2H3 cells was also almost totally suppressed by treatment with the two p38 kinase inhibitors but was unaffected by either of the ERK inhibitors (Fig. 4 B). Thus, p38 kinase is responsible for the activation of acetyltransferase in A23187-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. To determine whether the lack of acetyltransferase activity in PHGPx-overexpressing cells is due to insufficient activation of p38 kinase, we monitored the phosphorylation of p38 kinase in A23187-stimulated L9 cells by immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 5). We could not detect the phosphorylated form of p38 kinase in unstimulated S1 cells or L9 cells. However, A23187 stimulation of S1 caused the apparent phosphorylation of p38 kinase and its upstream activator MAPK kinases 3 and 6 (MKK3 and MKK6). In contrast, no such phosphorylation was observed in stimulated L9 cells. The levels of p38 expression did not differ in S1 cells and L9 cells, regardless of whether they had been stimulated or not. With regard to ERK1/2, A23187 stimulation equally enhanced its phosphorylation in both S1 cells and L9 cells. To verify our observations made with the whole cells, we assessed the effect on acetyltransferase activation of adding activated recombinant p38 kinase. To perform this experiment, we first had to obtain a source of acetyltransferase. To do this, we determined the subcellular localization of acetyltransferase in RBL-2H3 cells by fractionating them by differential centrifugation. The acetyltransferase activity in the individual subfractions was then determined and was found to be largely concentrated in the mitochondrial and microsomal fractions (Fig. 6 A). The subcellular distribution of acetyltransferase activity did not differ in S1 cells and L9 cells (data not shown). Consequently, we used the mitochondrial and microsomal fractions prepared from quiescent S1 cells and L9 cells as acetyltransferase sources (Fig. 6 B). When activated recombinant p38 kinase was added to the mitochondrial fraction prepared from quiescent S1 cells, the acetyltransferase activity was doubled, whereas the activity in the microsomal fraction was only moderately enhanced. With regard to L9 cells, both the basal level of acetyltransferase activity in the mitochondrial fraction and the enhancement of this activity by adding activated p38 kinase were similar to that seen in the S1 cell fractions. Thus, reduction of acetyltransferase activity in PHGPx-overexpressing cells is due to the blocking of the intracellular signal transduction pathway that leads to the activation of p38 kinase. p38 kinase most likely activates acetyltransferase by phosphorylating it. To test this, the mitochondrial fraction of S1 cells was incubated with alkaline phosphatase after adding the activated recombinant p38 molecules and performing the kinase reaction (Fig. 7). The alkaline phosphatase treatment reduced the acetyltransferase activity in p38 kinase-treated mitochondrial fractions to almost the same levels seen in the control mitochondrial fraction, which had been treated with neither p38 nor alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 7). Thus, p38 kinase-mediated phosphorylation of acetyltransferase can activate the enzyme. To investigate whether the phosphorylation of acetyltransferase participates in the activation of the enzyme in A23187-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells, we examined the effect of alkaline phosphatase on the activity of acetyltransferase in the mitochondrial fraction prepared from control and A23187-stimulated S1 cells (Fig. 8). The acetyltransferase activity ofA23187-stimulated cells was twice as high as the activity of the unstimulated cells, but treatment with alkaline phosphatase reduced this to untreated control cell levels. Furthermore, when unstimulated cells were treated with alkaline phosphatase, the basal level of acetyltransferase activity was reduced by 30%. Thus, phosphorylation of acetyltransferase is essential for both the activation of acetyltransferase in stimulated cells and the expression of the basal a"
https://openalex.org/W2015391499,"Abstract The Snf1 kinase complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains one of three possible β subunits encoded by either SIP1, SIP2, or GAL83. Snf1 kinase complexes were purified from cells expressing only one of the three β subunits using a tandem affinity purification tag on the C terminus of the Snf1 protein. The purified kinase complexes were enzymatically active as judged by their ability to phosphorylate a recombinant protein containing the Snf1-responsive domain of the Mig1 protein. The Snf1 kinase complexes containing Gal83 or Sip2 as the β subunit showed comparable and high levels of activity, whereas the Sip1-containing enzyme was significantly less active. Examination of the protein composition of the purified Snf1 enzyme complexes indicated that the Sip1 protein was present in substoichiometric levels. Increased gene dosage of SIP1 rescued the ethanol growth defect observed in cells expressing Sip1 as their only β subunit and increased the in vitro activity of Snf1 kinase purified from these cells. Our studies indicate that the reduced activity of Snf1-Snf4-Sip1 kinase is due to low level of Sip1 accumulation rather than a limited ability of the Sip1 form of the enzyme to direct phosphorylation of specific substrates."

Within the N-terminal domain are two nucleotide-binding folds, termed NBF-I1 and NBF-II, which exhibit high homology to RNA and DNA helicases from superfamilies 1 and 2 (22Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as predicted from sequence data (23Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), all of the expected DEAD-box helicase motifs (I through VI) are found in structurally homologous locations in SecA NBF-I and -II. As in the helicases, the nucleotide-binding site is at the NBF-I/NBF-II interdomain junction, and the conserved motifs juxtapose the binding site. A novel insertion in NBF-I (residues 220–380, Escherichia coli numbering), not present in helicases, was found in an early study of E. coli SecA to cross-link a precursor protein (24Kimura E. Akita M. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6600-6606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore is termed the preprotein cross-linking domain. The last 39 residues at the C terminus of SecA are disordered and not resolved in the crystal structure. Structures of DEAD-box helicases suggest that their mechanisms rely on regulated rigid body rearrangements of the two nucleotide-binding domains that require interdomain flexibility (22Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Consistent with the structural similarity between SecA and the helicases, numerous published data support the importance of interdomain interactions in the SecA mechanism. Schmidt et al. (25Schmidt M. Ding H. Ramamurthy V. Mukerji I. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15440-15448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) reported that several suppressors of protein secretion defects and azide-resistant mutants of SecA perturbed the SecA endothermic transition by weakening interdomain contacts. Several laboratories, including our own, have shown that any disruption of the C terminus of SecA, through truncation or partial unfolding, leads to enhanced ATPase activity (10Triplett T.L.

Deletion of a specific region of the C-terminal sequence (residues 783 to 795) recapitulates the ATPase activation observed in C-terminal truncated versions of SecA; this region has been termed by Economou and coworkers (15Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos T. Kuhn A. Politou A.S. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) the intramolecular regulator of ATP hydrolysis 1 (IRA1). These same researchers presented biochemical evidence that a region nearly coincident with NBF-II (amino acids 462 to 610, dubbed IRA2) regulates the nucleotide binding and release function of NBF-I (16Sianidis G. Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Boulias K. Repanas K. Kyrpides N. Politou A.S. Economou A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recent cross-linking and biochemical experiments by Economou and coworkers (17Baud C. Karamanou S. Sianidis G. Vrontou E. Politou A.S. Economou A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13724-13731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) suggest that binding of signal peptides occurs to a segment from residues 219 to 244 and that IRA1 regulates access to this binding site. Binding of SecB to the C-terminal region of SecA enhances its ATPase activity and promotes exchange with membrane-bound SecA (26Woodbury R.L. Topping T.B. Diamond D.L. Suciu D. Kumamoto C.A. Hardy S.J. Randall L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24191-24198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition to the domain reorganization within a SecA monomer, binding to phospholipids or signal peptides modulates SecA oligomerization with lipids favoring monomeric states and signal peptides shifting the equilibrium toward dimers (27Benach, J., Chou, Y.-T., Fak, J. J., Itkin, A., Nicolae, D. D., Smith, P. C., Wittrock, G., Floyd, D., Gierasch, L. M., and Hunt, J. F. (October 27, 2002) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M205992200Google Scholar). Clearly, a delicate balance of interdomain interactions poises SecA to undergo profound conformational change in a regulated way, depending upon binding to its many ligands. The ligand-modulated changes in interdomain packing in SecA necessarily require regions of sequence that are able to adopt alternate conformations in order to allow rigid body rearrangements. It is reasonable to anticipate that some regions of SecA will show enhanced mobility, enabling them to perform regulatory or linker roles in its mechanistic cycle. Static pictures of the SecA structure do not reveal the locations and dynamics of these functionally important regions. Therefore, we embarked on an effort using NMR to ask whether there are mobile regions in SecA and to understand their roles in its domain rearrangements. This approach had been productive in our previous work on GroES, where the GroEL-interactive regions emerged as ‘mobile loops’ that displayed narrow resonances in both one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra (28Landry S.J. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In examination of SecA, we indeed found several narrow resonances in NMR spectra, and we have been able to carry out sequence-specific assignment of these resonances. Strikingly, these regions have been assigned to residues within NBF-II (mobile region 1, residues 564 to 579) and the C terminus (mobile region 2, residues 864 to 901), both of which play critical roles in SecA function and both of which are structurally related to the proposed IRA regions. Unless specifically mentioned, standard laboratory reagents were purchased from Sigma or VWR. All deuterated or15N-labeled compounds were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA) or Isotec (Miamisburg, OH). SecA and variants were purified from overexpressing E. coli strains BL21.19 (pT7-SecA2, pT7-SecA95) kindly provided by D. Oliver (Wesleyan University) (29Mitchell C. Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar,30Rajapandi T. Oliver D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All proteins were purified as described previously (10Triplett T.L. Sgrignoli A.R. Gao F. Yang Y. Tai P.C. Gierasch L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19648-19655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Uniform 15N-labeled SecA protein was obtained by growing cells in M9 minimal medium containing15NH4Cl. The sample with reverse selective labeling of arginine residues was prepared by providing cells with 250 mg/liter culture of unlabeled arginine in addition to15NH4Cl. Purity of SecA was assessed by SDS-PAGE; samples of lower than 98% purity were found to aggregate during concentration. The principal impurities observed were proteolytic breakdown products (molecular masses 95, 75, 64, 43 kDa), most of which are less soluble than the intact protein. ATPase activity of purified SecA was verified to be comparable with literature values (10Triplett T.L. Sgrignoli A.R. Gao F. Yang Y. Tai P.C. Gierasch L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19648-19655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Proteins were concentrated using Centricon-30 or -50 (Millipore) to achieve millimolar concentration for NMR. Protein concentrations were measured via the Bradford assay. At least three individual preparations of fresh protein samples were used to confirm the reproducibility of the data. Samples for NMR spectrometry consisted of 0.8–1.2 mm SecA (monomer) in 25 mm KCl, 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0–7.7), and 10% D2O with or without 0.02% azide. Under these conditions, SecA is overwhelmingly in the dimer state (31Woodbury R.L. Hardy S.J.S. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).2 Spectra were obtained using Bruker AMX500 or Avance 600 NMR spectrometers at 25 °C. 1H chemical shifts were referenced with respect to the methyl protons of 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionate (TMSP) (0 ppm). Data were processed within the FELIX 97 program (Biosym Technologies, San Diego) running on a Silicon Graphics Indigo work station (Mountain View, CA).1H-15N HSQC experiments were recorded using the States-TPPI method (32Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar) with 32–64 scans; the spectral widths and number of points were 7000–8000 Hz × 1650–4000 Hz and 768 × 128 points in the 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively. The spectral widths and number of complex points in the F3, F2, and F1 dimensions, the number of scans per free induction decay, and the total measurement time of three-dimensional1H-15N TOCSY-HSQC and1H-15N NOESY-HSQC (32Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar) were 7000 × 1650 × 7000 Hz, 512 × 32 × 64, and 16 scans for ∼5 days. The mixing times were 29 ms for the TOCSY-HSQC and 70 ms for the NOESY-HSQC experiments. As a 204-kDa homodimer, SecA is beyond the size of proteins routinely assignable via NMR methods. A roughly spherical protein of M r 200 would typically be expected to have broad signals (>100 Hz), consistent with an overall correlation time (τc) of ∼100 ns (32Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar). This protein, however, contains a set of relatively narrow peaks superimposed on an envelope of broad, overlapping resonances in the one-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectra (Fig. 2). The narrow resonances indicate that this protein contains some significantly mobile residues. We localized the amino acid sequences corresponding to these resonances of SecA using methods of sequential assignment (32Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar, 33Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley and Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar), relying on1H-15N HSQC, 1H-15N TOCSY-HSQC, and 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC data obtained in 90% H2O/10% D2O on uniformly15N-labeled samples. The assignment was initiated by identifying unique spin systems (e.g. serine, threonine, alanine, glycine, and others) in the three-dimensional TOCSY data. Sequential connections between those specific residues or other spin systems (e.g. S-AMX, AMX-G, S-A, T-G, and S-G) were identified in the heteronuclear NOESY spectrum. Further sequential assignments of backbone amide resonances were tentatively made by additional NOEs extracted from the three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC data. We confirmed and extended our assignments using “reverse selective labeling of arginine” (34Rizo J. Liu Z.-P. Gierasch L.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 741-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), in which all residues but arginine are15N-labeled (Fig. 1 D, locations of assigned arginines indicated by open circles).Figure 1Assignment of two mobile regions in E. coli SecA by NMR.

The following example illustrates the approach used: The assignment of mobile region 1 was initiated by unique assignment of570QLRG573. Sequential Hα-HN, HN-HN, and Hβ-HN NOEs were used to define a Glu/Gln/Met-Leu/Ile-Arg sequence. In this case, the third residue was shown to be arginine by reverse labeling; other residue identifications were obtained from 1H-15N TOCSY-HSQC data. Search of the SecA sequence for a region consistent with these data yields two possible assignments (418MIR420 and570QLR572). A strong Hα-HN NOE between the arginine and an i+1 glycine residue uniquely identifies these resonances as the 570QLRG573 sequence. Another set of resonances correlated by Hα-HN, HN-HN, and Hβ-HN sequential NOEs consists of an arginine followed by a Lys/Glu/Gln/Met spin system, which itself has an Hα-HN NOE to an i+1 glycine residue. Only two regions of the SecA sequence fit these criteria (577RQG579 and786RQG788). Here and throughout this assignment procedure, we have made the plausible assumption that short segments of mobile residues separated by a short unassignable sequence in the context of a 901-amino acid dimer arise from a single, larger mobile region. For example, we found no other mobile residues in the vicinity of 786RQG788 and hence assigned this RQG sequence to residues 577–579. Similar logic allowed us to tentatively assign a Ser-Arg pair and an Arg-Ile/Leu pair to the564SRRI567 sequence. Thus we conclude that one mobile region comprises residues Ser564 to Gly579 (mobile region 1). In an analogous fashion, we assigned mobile region 2 to the extreme C terminus of the SecA protein (residues 864 to 901). Assigned sequences in this region included 864SA865,870LAAGTGER877,879VGRN882,888GSGKKYKQCHGRLQ901. We argue that this is one consecutive mobile region based on similar assumptions to those used for mobile region 1. As shown in Fig. 2, the HSQC spectrum of SecA upon addition of either Mg2+ alone or Mg/ATP-γS reveals significant chemical shift perturbation (both proton and nitrogen dimensions) to selected resonances, notably Arg566 and Arg572 in mobile region 1. Mg2+ is reported to bind to SecA directly, with its proposed site of binding involving Asp209 and Asp217 (E. colinumbering) (35van der Wolk J.P.W. Klose M. de Wit J.G. den Blaauwen T. Freudl R. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18975-18982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The former residue is part of the DEAD-box sequence of SecA (helicase motif II), 209DEVD212, the last residue of which interacts directly with Gln570 of helicase motif VI (and mobile region I) in the structures of both SecA (21Hunt J.F. Weinkauf S. Henry L. McNicholas P. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 297: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and UvrB (36Machius M. Henry L. Palnitkar M. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11717-11722Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 37Theis K. Chen P.J. Skorvaga M. van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6899-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Asp217 directly interacts with Arg566 of mobile region 1. The involvement of helicase motif VI in forming the nucleotide-binding site is consistent with the sensitivity of Gln570, Arg572, and Arg577 to addition of ATP-γS. Interestingly, in addition, significant chemical shift changes are observed for Arg566in mobile region 1 when ATP-γS binds, even though this residue does not directly contact the nucleotide, and for Lys894 and Lys891 in mobile region 2, the latter upon binding of ATP-γS but not Mg2+. Further insight into the spatial arrangement of the mobile regions was obtained through the use of Mn2+ ion as a paramagnetic broadening agent. Nuclei within ∼20 Å of the site of Mn2+ binding may be perturbed, and the effect is distance-dependent by an inverse third power (38Mildvan A.S. Engle J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 26: 654-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 39Dwek R.A. NMR in Biochemistry. Clarendon Press, Oxford1973Google Scholar, 40Grisham C.M.

Science. 1996; 273: 1547-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Mn2+ is nearly isosteric to Mg2+, thus its addition to SecA should broaden the signals of residues that are close in space to the Mg2+-binding site. Strikingly, addition of 2.0 μm Mn2+ causes significant line broadening and attenuation of cross peaks arising from both mobile regions of SecA (Fig. 3). In mobile region 2, the broadening was most pronounced for central residues (874–881), whereas residues throughout mobile region 1 were affected. The observation that Mn2+ addition differentially broadens signals from the SecA mobile regions argues that its influence arises from specific binding and not a nonspecific process (such as aggregation). Additionally, the signal from an internal standard (TMSP) was not broadened (data not shown), supporting the interpretation that the observed changes arise from specific binding. Because Mn2+ functionally substitutes for Mg2+in NTP binding to most ATPases and GTPases (42Wittinghofer A. Pai E.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 382-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 43Schweins T. Scheffzek K. Assheuer R. Wittinghofer A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we could explore nucleotide-induced domain rearrangements of SecA with the added Mn2+ reporting on the location of mobile regions 1 and 2 with respect to the nucleotide-binding site. Surprisingly, many (but not all) 1H-15N cross peaks in the HSQC spectrum arising from the mobile regions were restored to nearly their original intensity when AMP-PNP was added (Fig. 3 C), arguing that AMP-PNP reversed the influence of Mn2+. As indicated above, the observation that AMP-PNP restored the intensities of some, but not all, broadened signals points to a specific effect of this ligand. Our results reveal that there are two well defined regions of high mobility in SecA, such that narrow NMR resonances are observable despite the large size of this protein. Moreover, the locations of these regions are functionally provocative. Thus, SecA joins several multidomain proteins that have been found to have high mobility in functionally important regions (28Landry S.J. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Gierasch L.M.

Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). This region has direct contact with bound nucleotide in several helicases (Ref. 22Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar and references within), and the recent crystal structure of B. subtilis SecA confirms that the same role is played in SecA (21Hunt J.F. Weinkauf S. Henry L. McNicholas P. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 297: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Alignment of 30 different SecA sequences shows it to be one of the most conserved sequences in SecA (near 100%) (21Hunt J.F. Weinkauf S. Henry L. McNicholas P. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J.

The NK-1 receptor has been cloned in several species, among them the murine, the rat, and the human. The hNK-11 receptor is composed of 407 amino acids organized in 7 membrane-spanning segments. As for all other receptors from this superfamily, the molecular basis of the binding of the preferred endogenous ligand SP to the NK-1 receptor is far from being well understood. Structure-activity relationships in SP (amino acid substitutions or modifications) (1Quartara L. Maggi C.A. Neuropeptides. 1997; 31: 537-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) as well as in the NK-1 receptor (site-directed mutagenesis, construction of deleted or chimeric receptors) (2Fong T.M.

Beside these studies, a complementary and more direct approach to identify the key points in the interaction between a peptide and a protein is photoaffinity labeling (3Dorman G. Prestwich G.D.

All of these studies have used p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine ((p-Bzl)Phe) as the photoreactive probe that is activable at a wavelength of 365 nm. With analogs of SP incorporating (p-Bzl)Phe in the third or eighth position, Li et al. have shown that these two residues are in contact, respectively, with the N-terminal extracellular tail (residues 1–21) and residues 173–183 of the second extracellular loop of the murine NK-1 receptor (4Li Y.-M.

Using a photoreactive analog at position 8 of SP, Kage et al. reported the site of covalent attachment as Met181 in the rat (5Kage R. Leeman S.E. Krause J.E. Costello C.E. Boyd N.D. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22386-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). During the course of this study, Bremeret al. have reported that photoinsertion of a photoreactive analog of SP at position 3 is located both within the segments 173–177 of the second extracellular loop and 11–21 of the N terminus of the rat NK-1 receptor (8Bremer A.A. Leeman S.E. Boyd N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22857-22861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Li et al. have also identified Met174 as the site of covalent attachment of a photoreactive analog of SP at position 4 (9Li H. McDonald D.M. Hronowski X. Costello C.E. Leeman S.E. Boyd N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10589-10593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To define further the binding site for SP within the NK-1 receptor, we have synthesized photoreactive analogs, [BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phex, Met(O2)11)]SP, incorporating a biotinyl sulfone amino pentanoic acid (BAPA) derivative at the N terminus and the photoreactive amino acid (p-Bzl)Phe at position 4, 5, 6, 9, or 10 of the sequence of SP. We previously showed that the analog modified at position 7 has no affinity (μm) for the NK-1 receptor (6Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The peptide analogs of SP photoreactive at position 4, 5, 6, 9, or 10 have high affinity for the two binding sites associated with the NK-1 receptor transfected in chinese hamster ovary cells and are potent agonists in activating both phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and cAMP accumulation (11Sachon E. Girault-Lagrange S. Chassaing G. Lavielle S. Sagan S. J. Peptide Res. 2002; 59: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that these photoreactive analogs also give good yields of photolabeling of the NK-1 receptor transfected in chinese hamster ovary cells. We have used a methodology of photolabeling already described to identify the site of photoinsertion of SP analogs photoactivable at position 8, in the NK-1 receptor (6Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Lequin O. Bolbach G. Frank F. Convert O. Chassaing G. Lavielle S. Sagan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22386-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This methodology is based on the use of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads to purify the covalent ligand/receptor complex after enzymatic and/or chemical digestions and subsequent analysis by MALDI-TOF MS to identify the site of photoinsertion within the receptor (6Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Lequin O. Bolbach G. Frank F. Convert O. Chassaing G. Lavielle S. Sagan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22386-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The photoreactive peptide analogs of SP have been synthesized and characterized previously (11Sachon E. Girault-Lagrange S. Chassaing G. Lavielle S. Sagan S. J. Peptide Res. 2002; 59: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of the peptides gave the expected m/z of the protonated molecule (first isotope): 1890.90 expected, 1890.90 measured ([BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe4, Met(O2)11]SP); 1859.90 expected, 1859.90 measured ([BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe5, Met(O2)11]SP); 1859.90 expected, 1860.02 measured ([BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe6, Met(O2)11]SP); 1930.93 expected, 1931.05 measured ([BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe9, Met(O2)11]SP); 1874.90 expected, 1874.77 measured ([BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe10, Met(O2)11]SP). [[11-3H]Pro9]SP (60 Ci/mmol) was synthesized at Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (Saclay, France) according to Chassaing et al. (12Chassaing G. Lavielle S. Julien S. Marquet A. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 26: 623-626Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The chinese hamster ovary cell clone expressing the hNK-1 receptor (6 pmol/mg) has already been described (6Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Lequin O. Bolbach G. Frank F. Convert O. Chassaing G. Lavielle S. Sagan S.

Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were obtained from Dynal. Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the hNK-1 receptor are cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 100 international units/ml penicillin, 100 international units/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Cultures were kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Stable transfection was maintained by Geneticin (400 mg/liter). Membranes were prepared as described and were stored in 50 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol at −80 °C. Proteins in membranes are quantified using the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as reference. Membranes (10 μg of proteins) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with the photoreactive analogs at a concentration equal to their affinity (K i) previously determined in competition experiments with [11-3H][Pro9]SP, i.e. 5 nm for [BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe4, Met(O2)11]SP, 20 nm for [BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe5, Met(O2)11]SP, 0.5 nm for [BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe6,Met(O2)11]SP, 13 nm for [BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe9, Met(O2)11]SP, and 18 nm for [BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe10, Met(O2)11]SP in 100 μl of 50 mmTris-Cl buffer pH 7.4 containing 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 400 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The membrane preparations were then irradiated on ice for 40 min with a UV light at 365 nm (HPR 125-W lamp) at a distance of 6–10 cm. After irradiation, 900 μl of incubation buffer was added for 5 min at room temperature to wash out noncovalently bound photoaffinity ligands. Membranes were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm (MSE Micro Centaur) for 2 min, washed with 1 ml of incubation buffer, and centrifuged again. The photolabeled membranes were then subjected to a saturation binding experiment (Scatchard analysis). The pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of incubation buffer containing [11-3H][Pro9]SP (used at concentrations from 0.3 to 6 nm) for 10 min with or without the presence of 1 μm [Pro9]SP for determination of nonspecific binding. After incubation, membranes were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 2 min, washed with 1 ml of Tris buffer at 4 °C, and centrifuged again. The number of maximal binding sites remaining after photolabeling was calculated with respect to the number of maximal binding sites obtained with membranes incubated but not irradiated in the presence of the photoreactive peptides. Typically nonspecific binding represented between 1.3 and 10% of the total binding in saturation studies, whatever the photoreactive analog and with or without irradiation. Membranes (1 mg of proteins) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 100–500 nm concentrations of the photoaffinity ligands and irradiated on ice for 40 min at 365 nm (HPR 125-W lamp) at a distance of 6–10 cm. After irradiation, 10 μm[Pro9]SP was added for 10 min before centrifugation at 13,000 rpm (MSE Micro Centaur) for 2 min. The pellet was then washed with 1 ml of Tris buffer and centrifuged again. Photolabeled membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in 30 μl of denaturation buffer consisting of 17 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% SDS, and 50 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.4. After denaturation, photolabeled membranes were digested at room temperature with 100 μg of trypsin for 15 h as described (6Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Lequin O. Bolbach G. Frank F. Convert O. Chassaing G. Lavielle S. Sagan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22386-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The trypsin-digested covalent complexes were then purified with 100 μg of streptavadine-coated magnetic beads and subjected either to further digestion with endo-GluC or MALDI-TOF MS analysis as described (6Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Lequin O. Bolbach G. Frank F. Convert O. Chassaing G. Lavielle S. Sagan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22386-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After endo-GluC cleavage, samples were again purified with the magnetic beads and subjected either to further digestion with CBPY or MALDI-TOF MS analysis as described (6Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Lequin O. Bolbach G. Frank F. Convert O. Chassaing G. Lavielle S. Sagan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22386-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Finally, the purified samples could be further submitted to CNBr cleavage in 70% HCOOH (6Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) before MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Briefly, 70% HCOOH was added to the biotin-containing complexes bound to the beads. A few CNBr crystals were then added. Incubation was carried out overnight at room temperature, in the dark and under an argon atmosphere. Magnetic beads were then eliminated, and the supernatant was transferred into a new Eppendorf tube and evaporated in a speed-vacuum apparatus. Tris buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and new beads were then added at pH 7.4 to trap the ligand-receptor fragments complexes. Covalently bound peptides were eluted from the magnetic beads with 3 μl of the MALDI matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 4:1 (vol/vol) CH3CN/H2O (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) as described previously (6Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Girault S. Chassaing G. Bolbach G. Blais J.-C. Brunot A. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 2122-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). After 10 min incubation, 1 μl of bead-free supernatant was deposited on the sample holder for MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Mass spectra (averaged over 256 laser shots) were obtained in positive mode on a Voyager Elite (PerSeptive Biosystems) mass spectrometer in the reflector mode. Peptides for external calibration were deposited on the target close to the photolabeled samples. The deposit contains a few picomoles of neurotensin, and the accuracy in the mass range (800–4000 units) was estimated to be 20 ppm. For samples giving a very low ion signal (resulting from a loss in peptide quantities because of the combined and repeated digestions and purification steps), the final mass spectrum was obtained from the average of 5–10 mass spectra (256 laser shots each). Typically, the amount of peptide on these targets is expected to be in the low-femtomole range. Peptide receptor domains corresponding to the mass peaks obtained were identified by using the Protein Analysis WorkSheet (PAWS) freeware edition (Proteomics, www.proteomics.com) and applied to the hNK-1 receptor using the different cleavages. The synthesis and biological activity of all of these photoreactive analogs of SP have already been described (11Sachon E. Girault-Lagrange S. Chassaing G. Lavielle S. Sagan S. J. Peptide Res. 2002; 59: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These analogs are potent competitors of [[11-3H]Pro9]SP binding (K i value from 0.5 nm for [BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe6, Met(O2)11]SP to 19 nm for [BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe5, Met(O2)11]SP) to the NK-1 receptor more abundant binding site and all have agonist activity (11Sachon E. Girault-Lagrange S. Chassaing G. Lavielle S. Sagan S. J. Peptide Res. 2002; 59: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We first examined the efficiency of photolabeling with each of these photoreactive analogs of SP. The yield of covalent photoaffinity labeling was determined to be 68 ± 1% for [BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe4, Met(O2)11]SP, 54 ± 2% for [BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe5, Met(O2)11]SP, 37 ± 5% for [BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe6, Met(O2)11]SP, 50 ± 10% for [BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe9, Met(O2)11]SP, and 46 ± 7% for [BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe10, Met(O2)11]SP. These yields of photolabeling were sufficiently high to continue the analysis to identify the site of photoinsertion within the receptor. After irradiation, the covalent complex [BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phex, Met(O2)11]SP/NK-1 receptor was digested for 15 h with trypsin. We observed by MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the tryptic or combined trypsin/endo-GluC digests that the analogs photoreactive at position 4, 5, 6, 9, or 10 are cleaved by the chymotrypsin-like activity derived from trypsin (from Sigma) as previously described (data not shown) (6Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Lequin O. Bolbach G. Frank F. Convert O. Chassaing G. Lavielle S. Sagan S.

FEBS Lett. 1971; 16: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This cleavage even occurs with the sequencing-grade modified trypsin (from Promega) that should be extremely resistant to autolysis. For [BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe4, Met(O2)11]SP and [BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe5, Met(O2)11]SP, protonated molecules atm/z 1558.72 and 1527.74 (first isotope) were observed, respectively (shown only for the analog photoactivable at position 5, Fig. 1 a). They correspond to the N-terminal fragment 1–8 of these peptides. Similarly, for the analog [BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe6, Met(O2)11]SP, the N-terminal fragments 1–8 but also fragments 1–7, 1–6, and 1–5 were obtained (data not shown). In the following, the given m/z ratio refer to that of the first isotope. With the exception of [BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe5, Met(O2)11]SP, all of the other photoreactive analogs only yielded peaks corresponding to the initial peptide or fragments of the initial peptide after photolabeling, enzymatic cleavage, and purification via streptavidin-coated magnetic beads before MALDI-TOF MS analysis. With the analog [BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe5, Met(O2)11]SP and after trypsin treatment, reproducible MALDI mass spectra showed protonated molecules atm/z, 3031.23, 2868.25, and 2536.14 (data not shown, Table I). Controls (without photolabeling) confirmed that these ions are the main features of the photolabeling. Signals at m/z 3031.23 and 2868.25 can only correspond to the covalent attachment of the entire SP peptide analog to the receptor domains 168YSTTETMPSR177(measured 1171.34 units, expected 1171.52 units) and169STTETMPSR177 (measured 1008.39 units, expected 1008.46 units), respectively (Table I). The signal atm/z 2536.14 corresponds to the covalent attachment of the N-terminal fragment 1–8 of the photoreactive ligand to the receptor domain 169STTETMPSR177 (1008.45 measured, 1008.46 expected) (Table I). Subsequent cleavage of the tryptic fragments on magnetic beads with endo-GluC led to the identification in MALDI of new peptides and to the disappearance of the signal at 3031.24 (Fig. 1 b, Table I). Peaks atm/z 2450.1 and 2117.93 correspond to a unique receptor fragment, i.e. 173TMPSR177(590.19 measured, 590.29 expected) (Table I). When using the sequencing-grade modified trypsin (from Promega), the same results were obtained. Subsequent digestion with CBPY (Fig. 1 c) yielded new peptides in the MALDI mass spectra at m/z2294.22, 1961.95, 1874.92, and 1814.83, corresponding to the receptor domains 173TMPS176 (434.28 measured, 434.20 expected) and 173TMP175 (347.3 measured, 347.16 expected) linked to the entire sequence or to fragments 1–8 and 1–7 of the photoligand (Table I). Controls without UV irradiation only showed signals corresponding to the entire photoreactive peptide and the corresponding trypsin digestion-derived peptide fragments (Fig. 1 a). Because the identified photolabeled domain of the NK-1 receptor contains a methionyl residue, we carried out CNBr cleavage after digestion of the complex with trypsin/endo-GluC to restrict and to specify the site of photoinsertion. MALDI MS analysis of the peptide obtained after trypsin, endo-GluC, and CNBr cleavage (Fig. 1 d, Table I) led to the appearance of four new characteristic peaks at m/z 2402.05, 2386.06, 2070.07, and 2053.99 with a concomitant drop of the signals atm/z 2450.13 and 2117.95 observed in the corresponding experiments without CNBr treatment. These shifts of 48 units and 64 units, from both the entire photoreactive ligand and its N-terminal fragment linked to 173TMPSR177 after treatment with CNBr, suggested that the covalent link between [BAPA0, (p-Bzl)Phe5, Met(O2)11]SP and the NK-1 receptor occurred on the CγH2 of Met174, hampering the classic CNBr cleavage at the methionine carboxylic peptide bond. With a model compound, (C6H5)2C(OH)CH2SCH3, mimicking the covalent link between the benzophenone moiety of the photoreactive SP analog and the γ-methylene group of Met174 side chain in the NK-1 receptor, we have demonstrated that the corresponding ethylenic and epoxide or aldehyde derivatives can indeed be generated after CNBr/HCOOH treatment (15Sachon E.

In this study, we have obtained a covalent and irreversible linkage of the hNK-1 receptor only with the analog of SP photoactivable in position 5 of the sequence. All other photoreactive peptide analogs were found, by MALDI-TOF MS analysis, either entirely or as digestion fragments but not linked to any receptor segment. This result was unexpected because these peptides have high affinity for the NK-1 receptor and because good yields of photolabeling could be determined in saturation experiments by comparing [3H][Pro9]SP maximal binding in the presence of these photoactivable analogs with or without irradiation. This protocol was used to circumvent potential difficulties to wash out the noncovalently bound photoreactive peptides. These results support the idea that a covalent and specific link had been created between the photoreactive peptides and the NK-1 receptor, whereas the possibility of noncovalent binding artifact can be dismissed. Therefore it is likely that some reversion of the photolabeling reaction occurred. The hypothesis of such reversion of the photolabeling reaction is acceptable, considering the specificity of the benzophenone chromophore. It has been well established (16Stone P.G. Cohen S.G. J.

https://openalex.org/W2051945006,"Unsaturated fatty acids with odd-numbered double bonds, e.g. oleic acid, can be degraded by β-oxidation via the isomerase-dependent pathway or the reductase-dependent pathway that differ with respect to the metabolism of the double bond. In an attempt to elucidate the metabolic functions of the two pathways and to determine their contributions to the β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, the degradation of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA, a metabolite of oleic acid, was studied with rat heart mitochondria. Kinetic measurements of metabolite and cofactor formation demonstrated that more than 80% of oleate β-oxidation occurs via the classical isomerase-dependent pathway whereas the more recently discovered reductase-dependent pathway is the minor pathway. However, the reductase-dependent pathway is indispensable for the degradation of 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA, which is formed from 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA by Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase, the auxiliary enzyme that is essential for the operation of the major pathway of oleate β-oxidation. The degradation of 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA is limited by the capacity of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase to reduce 2-trans,4-trans-tetradecadienoyl-CoA, which is rapidly formed from its 3,5 isomer by Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase. It is concluded that both pathways are essential for the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids with odd-numbered double bonds inasmuch as the isomerase-dependent pathway facilitates the major flux through β-oxidation and the reductase-dependent pathway prevents the accumulation of an otherwise undegradable metabolite.

Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase The degradation of unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids by β-oxidation requires the involvement of auxiliary enzymes that act on preexisting double bonds. Even-numbered double bonds are reductively removed via two reactions that are catalyzed by the auxiliary enzymes 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.3.1.34) and Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (enoyl-CoA isomerase)1 (EC 5.3.3.8) (for review, see Ref. 1Schulz H. Kunau W.-H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 403-406Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Odd-numbered double bonds like the 9-cis double bond, which is present in oleic acid and in many other dietary fatty acids, are either isomerized or reduced during β-oxidation (for review, see Ref. 2Kunau W.-H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). As summarized in SchemeFS1, oleoyl-CoA (I) 2The roman numerals refer to the structures of oleate metabolites presented in Scheme FS1. is chain-shortened by two cycles of β-oxidation to 5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA (II). Dehydrogenation of the latter compound by long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (3Le W. Abbas A.S. Sprecher H. Vockley J. Schulz H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1485: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) produces 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (III), which can complete its pass through the β-oxidation cycle. The resultant 3-cis-dodecenoyl-CoA (VI), after isomerization to 2-trans-dodecenoyl-CoA (VII), can be completely degraded via the β-oxidation spiral. This pathway is referred to as the isomerase-dependent pathway because it only requires enoyl-CoA isomerase as an auxiliary enzyme. Most textbooks only mention this pathway when they discuss the β-oxidation of oleate or linoleate. However, the reductive removal of the double bond of 5-cis-enoyl-CoAs in mitochondria has been observed (4Tserng K.-Y. Jin S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11614-11620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was explained by a four-step reaction sequence (5Smeland T.E. Nada M. Cuebas D. Schulz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6673-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) that would convert 2,5-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (III) to 2-tetradecenoyl-CoA (XIV). The latter intermediate can be completely degraded via the β-oxidation spiral. The auxiliary enzymes required for this pathway are a novel enzyme, Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase (dienoyl-CoA isomerase) (6Luo M.J. Smeland T.E. Shoukry K. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2384-2388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in addition to 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase and enoyl-CoA isomerase. This pathway has been referred to as reductase-dependent pathway. Attempts to determine the relative fluxes through the reductase-dependent and isomerase-dependent pathways have not yet produced satisfactory answers for the degradation of typical long-chain dietary fatty acids. An estimate of the degradation of 5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA, an intermediate of oleate β-oxidation, via the reductase-dependent pathway yielded values of 86% and 65% for liver and heart mitochondria, respectively (7Tserng K.-Y. Jin S.-J. Chen L.-S. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, that study relied on the quantification of fatty acid metabolites in intact mitochondria. These metabolites are not true intermediates of β-oxidation but rather products that have leaked from the pathway, especially when functionally compromised mitochondria are involved (8Stanley K.K. Tubbs P.K. Biochem. J. 1975; 150: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Hence, it is very doubtful that these values are meaningful estimates of the flux through the reductase-dependent pathway. In fact, when the degradation of 2-trans,5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA, a medium-chain intermediate of linolenic acid metabolism, was studied with a soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria in the presence of NAD+, CoASH, and NADPH, 80% of the metabolite was observed to be degraded via the isomerase-dependent pathway (9Shoukry K. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6892-6899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The uncertainty about the contributions of the two pathways to the β-oxidation of long-chain dietary fatty acids prompted this study of the degradation of the oleate metabolite 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (III) by solubilized rat heart mitochondria. CoASH, NAD+, NADH, NADPH, dodecanoyl-CoA, decanoyl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA were purchased from Life Science Resources, Milwaukee, WI.

(16Linestead, R. P., Noble, E. G., and Boorman, E. J. (1931) J. Chem. Soc. 740–751Google Scholar). 5-cis-Tetradecenoic acid was a kind gift from Dr. Howard Sprecher, Ohio State University. 5-cis-Tetradecenoyl-CoA and 2-trans-dodecenoyl-CoA were synthesized from 5-cis-tetradecenoic acid and 2-trans-dodecenoic acid, respectively, by the mixed anhydride method as described by Fong and Schulz (17Fong J.C. Schulz H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Both products were purified by HPLC. For the synthesis of 2-trans-5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA, a solution of 5 μmol of 5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA in 30 ml of 0.1m potassium Pi (pH 9.0) was saturated with air for 30 min and dehydrogenated by acyl-CoA oxidase at room temperature. The near-complete conversion was achieved by the addition of 10–20 units of acyl-CoA oxidase in several aliquots over a period of 45 min. The progress of the conversion was monitored by HPLC. When a maximal conversion was achieved as indicated by the disappearance of 5-cis-tetradecaenoyl-CoA, the pH of the solution was adjusted to 1.5 with 6 N HCl to terminate the reaction. Precipitated protein was removed by filtering the solution through a 0.22-μm pore size membrane. After adjusting the pH to 4 with 4 N KOH, the solution was concentrated by passing it through a Sep-Pak C18cartridge and eluting it with a small volume of methanol, which subsequently was evaporated under reduced pressure. The resultant 2-trans-5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA was purified by HPLC. Fractions containing 2-trans-5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA were combined, concentrated as described above, and finally dissolved in deionized water. The pH of the final preparation was adjusted to ≈3–4, and the thioester concentration of this solution was determined spectrophotometrically by quantification of CoASH with Ellman's reagent (18Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar) after cleaving the thioester bond with NH2OH at pH 7.0 (17Fong J.C. Schulz H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The concentration of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA was calculated by subtracting the concentration of 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA from that of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA plus 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA. The concentrations of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA plus 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA and of 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA were determined by measuring the absorbance changes at 300 nm caused by their conversions in 0.1m potassium Pi (pH 8.0) to 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA on additions of 0.1 unit of dienoyl-CoA isomerase plus 0.05 unit of enoyl-CoA isomerase and of 0.1 unit of dienoyl-CoA isomerase, respectively. Concentrations of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA were calculated using an extinction coefficient of 28,000 M−1·cm−1 (19Cuebas D. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14140-14144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the synthesis of 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA, 5 μmol of 2-trans-5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA were incubated with 10 units of human peroxisomal enoyl-CoA isomerase in 30 ml of 0.1 m potassium Pi (pH 8.0) at room temperature. The conversion was monitored by HPLC. After completion of the reaction, NAD+, CoASH, 0.2 unit of enoyl-CoA hydratase, 0.4 unit of 3-hydroxyacy-CoA dehydrogenase, and 0.4 unit of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase were added to remove traces of 2-trans-5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA.l-3-Hydroxy-5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA was prepared by incubating 2 μmol of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA in 10 ml of 0.1 m potassium Pi buffer (pH 8.0) with 9 units of enoyl-CoA hydratase at room temperature and separating the product from the substrate by HPLC. For the synthesis of 3-keto-5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA, 1.5 μmol ofl-3-hydroxy-5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA in 10 ml of 20 mm potassium Pi buffer (pH 8.0) was incubated with 0.5 mm pyruvate and 0.5 mmNAD+ in the presence of 5 units ofl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and 7 units of lactate dehydrogenase at room temperature. The desired product was purified by HPLC. l-3-Hydroxydodecanoyl-CoA and 3-ketododecanoyl-CoA were synthesized from 2-trans-dodecenoyl-CoA andl-3-hydroxydodecanoyl-CoA, respectively, as described above for the corresponding longer chain acyl-CoAs. 2-trans,4-trans-Tetradecadienoyl-CoA was prepared by incubating 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA with dienoyl-CoA isomerase and purifying the product by HPLC. Rat heart mitochondria were isolated as described by Chappell and Hansford (20Chappell J.B. Hansford R.G. Birnie G.D. Subcellular Components. 2nd ed. Butterworth, London1972: 77-91Google Scholar) and stored at −70 °C. The thawed rat heart mitochondria were suspended in 0.2 m potassium Pi containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mmbenzamidine, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 30 min on ice. The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C for 30 min, and the supernatant was used for metabolic assays. Rates of degradation of 2-trans-5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA via the isomerase-dependent pathway were determined by incubating various amounts of the substrate in 0.2 m potassium Pi (pH 8) with an extract of solubilized rat heart mitochondria (0.1 mg/ml) in the presence of 1 mmNAD+ plus 0.3 mm CoASH and measuring the rate of NADH formation spectrophotometrically at 360 nm. An extinction coefficient of 4,140 M−1cm−1 was used to calculate rates. A concentration of 1 mm was chosen for NAD+ because it is saturating (21He X.-Y. Yang S.-Y. Schulz H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22Uchida Y. Izai K. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1034-1041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas 0.3 mm is the estimated concentration of free CoASH in mitochondria at state 3 respiration with palmitoyl-l-carnitine as substrate (23Hansford R.G. Johnson R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8361-8375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conversion of 2-trans-5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA to 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA was measured by incubating the substrate in 0.2 m potassium Pi (pH 8) with an extract of solubilized rat heart mitochondria (0.1 mg/ml) fortified with 0.1 unit of dienoyl-CoA isomerase. The absorbance change at 300 nm was recorded and an extinction coefficient of 28,000 M−1·cm−1 was used to calculate rates. When the time-dependent formation of metabolites was studied, 20 μm2-trans-5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA or 20 μm 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA was incubated in 0.2 m potassium Pi (pH 8.0) with an extract of solubilized rat heart mitochondria (0.1 mg/ml) in the presence of 1 mm NAD+, 0.3 mm CoASH, and 0.5 mm NADPH. Reactions were terminated by adjusting the pH to 1.5 with 6 N HCl. The pH was readjusted to 4.5 with 4 N KOH before the reaction mixtures were clarified by filtration through 0.22 μm pore size membranes and analyzed by HPLC. Extinction coefficients of 15,000, 19,650, and 28,800 M−1·cm−1 were determined at 254 nm for acyl-CoA thioesters that have a saturated α-carbon, one double bond, and two double bonds in conjugation with the thioester function, respectively. These extinction coefficients were used to calculate concentrations of metabolites from the peak areas of HPLC chromatograms. This approach is made possible by the fact that the total concentration of all acyl-CoA metabolites, except for newly formed acetyl-CoA, does not change during the course of the reaction and is equal to the starting concentration of the substrate, which was 20 μm. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1 μmol of substrate to product in 1 min. Acyl-CoA substrates were purified and metabolites were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC on a Waters μBondapak C18column (30 cm x 3.9 mm) attached to a Waters gradient HPLC system. The absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 254 nm. Separation of substrates and metabolites was achieved by washing the μBondapak C18 column with 50 mm ammonium phosphate (pH 5.5) containing 30% of acetonitrile/water (9:1, v/v) for 20 min and then eluting acyl-CoAs by linearly increasing the organic phase from 30% to 60% in 20 min at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. All samples were cleared of particulate matter by passing them through a 0.22-μm pore size membrane before they were injected into the HPLC system. Diluted samples were concentrated by passing them through Sep-Pak C18 cartridges and eluting them with small amounts of methanol, which subsequently were removed by evaporation under reduced pressure. 2-trans,5-cis-Tetradecadienoyl-CoA (III) is an intermediate that is formed during the β-oxidation of oleate and that can be further metabolized by either the isomerase-dependent pathway or the reductase-dependent pathway (see Scheme FS1). The kinetics of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA degradation via these two pathways were studied with rat heart mitochondria because of their minimal contamination with peroxisomes that are estimated to account for less than 3% of cardiac fatty acid β-oxidation (24Chu C. Schulz H. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Treatment of rat heart mitochondria with 1% Triton X-100 yielded a soluble extract that contained all β-oxidation enzymes required for the degradation of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (III) to decanoyl-CoA (X) and dodecanoyl-CoA (XVII). Because it had previously been determined that Triton X-100 at the applied concentration did not affect the activities of the enzymes of the β-oxidation spiral (25Fong J.C. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6917-6922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,26Luo M.J., He, X.-Y. Sprecher H. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 304: 266-271Google Scholar), it was only necessary to assess how Triton X-100 affects the activities of enoyl-CoA isomerase, 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, and dienoyl-CoA isomerase. Such tests revealed that none of these three auxiliary enzymes was negatively affected by 1% Triton X-100 (data not shown). When 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (III) was incubated with an extract of rat heart mitochondria in the presence of 1 mm NAD+ and 0.3 mmCoASH but in the absence of NADPH, it was possible to determine rates of β-oxidation via the isomerase-dependent pathway without interference from the reductase-dependent pathway by measuring spectrophotometrically the formation of NADH at 360 nm. The entry into the reductase-dependent pathway was determined separately by measuring at 300 nm the accumulation of 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (XII) in the absence of any cofactor. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 1. Specific activities for the isomerase-dependent pathway are based on initial velocity measurements that were linear during the first 2 min when, on the average, 1.5 mol of NADH were produced per mol of degraded 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (III). The conversion of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (III) to 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (XII) was measured 30 s after initiation of the reaction, when rates were linear. When the flux of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (III) through the isomerase-dependent pathways is compared with its entry into the reductase-dependent pathway, it is obvious that the former pathway is dominant and that the ratio of rates for the two pathways does not vary significantly over a considerable range of substrate concentrations (see Fig. 1). Consequently, the results that were obtained by studying the degradation of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA at one concentration may reflect the situation in intact mitochondria, for which the concentrations of true intermediates are unknown. In subsequent experiments we analyzed the time-dependent formation of metabolites that accumulate when 20 μm2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (III) was incubated with an extract of solubilized rat heart mitochondria in the presence of 1 mm NAD+, 0.3 mmCoASH, and 0.5 mm NADPH. Representative HPLC chromatograms are shown in Fig. 2. Product analysis 5 s after initiating the incubation revealed the rapid hydration of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (III) to 3-hydroxy-5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA (IV) (see Fig. 2 A). Because the hydration is freely reversible, both intermediates can enter either pathway. In addition, traces of 2-dodecenoyl-CoA (VII) and 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (XII) were detected. These two metabolites are committed to proceed through the isomerase-dependent pathway and reductase-dependent pathway, respectively. After 1 min of incubation, all intermediates of the isomerase-dependent pathway with the exception of 3-ketododecanoyl-CoA (IX) were present at detectable levels (see Fig. 2 B). Decanoyl-CoA was the final product of this metabolic sequence due to the absence of cofactors that are necessary for its further degradation by β-oxidation. Entry into the reductase-dependent pathway had also continued as indicated by the formation of more 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (XII), whereas dodecanoyl-CoA (XVII) remained undetectable (see Fig. 2 B). Five minutes after initiating the incubation, dodecanoyl-CoA (XVII), the end product of the reductase-dependent pathway under the prevailing experimental conditions, was present together with its precursor, 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (XII) (see Fig. 2 C). 3,5-Tetradecadienoyl-CoA was difficult to detect because it was insufficiently separated from 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA. However, it is unlikely to accumulate because of the high activity of dienoyl-CoA isomerase in the mitochondrial extract. After a total reaction time of 5 min, 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA had been completely metabolized, and all intermediates of the isomerase-dependent pathway had been converted to decanoyl-CoA (X). The small amount of material marked Δ2-C12-CoA was identified as a nonmetabolizable side product that seems to be formed from either 2,5-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (III) or 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (XII) in a time-dependent manner and that was eluted from the reverse-phase column together with Δ2-C12-CoA. The kinetics of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA degradation and metabolite formation are shown in Fig. 3. Most dramatic was the rapid hydration of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA to 3-hydroxy-5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA. This reaction preceded the slower dehydrogenation of the 3-hydroxy intermediate and the even slower appearance of the final product, decanoyl-CoA (C10-CoA). It was noted that the utilization of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA and 3-hydroxy-5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA followed a similar time course and that the concentrations of 2-dodecenoyl-CoA and 3-hydroxydodecanoyl-CoA changed almost in parallel (see Fig. 3). Thus, the two hydration reactions seem to be at or near equilibrium. The fact that the levels of 3-ketoacyl-CoAs and 3-cis-dodecenoyl-CoA were low or undetectable suggests that these intermediates are rapidly degraded. Taken together, the observed kinetics of intermediate formation and degradation point to the dehydrogenations of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs as the reactions that exert the greatest control over the flux through the isomerase-dependent pathway. The entry of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA into the reductase-dependent pathway was initially quite rapid as indicated by the formation of 2,4-tetradienoyl-CoA but declined as the concentration of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA decreased because of its hydration. However, dodecanoyl-CoA, the end product of this pathway, was formed very slowly with the result that only a fraction of its precursor, 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA, was converted to the final product during the five-minute incubation period, which was sufficient for the complete conversion of all intermediates of the isomerase-dependent pathway to the final product decanoyl-CoA. Thus, it seems that the NADPH-dependent reduction of 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA restricts the flux through the reductase-dependent pathway. 3,5-cis-Tetradecadienoyl-CoA is an assumed intermediate of oleate β-oxidation that we did not detect during the characterization of metabolites formed from 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA because it was not separated from its precursor by HPLC. In addition we asked whether 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA could be metabolized via the isomerase-dependent pathway in addition to being degraded by the reductase-dependent pathway. To address these issues, 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA was incubated with an extract of rat heart mitochondria in the presence of NAD+and CoASH, and its metabolites were analyzed by HPLC. Because the absence of NADPH prevents degradation via the reductase-dependent pathway, the flux through the isomerase-dependent pathway can be evaluated. As shown in Fig. 4 A,3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA was rapidly converted to its 2,4 isomer, but did not enter the isomerase-dependent pathway to a significant degree. After 5 min of incubation, a trace of decanoyl-CoA was detected (data not shown), which could have been formed either via the isomerase-dependent pathway as outlined in Scheme FS1 or more likely by direct β-oxidation of 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA. The rapid degradation of 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA via the reductase-dependent pathway was demonstrated by incubating it with an extract of rat heart mitochondria in the presence of all required cofactors including NAD+, CoASH, and NADPH. As shown in Fig. 4 B, 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA was rapidly converted to its 2,4 isomer, which was slowly reduced as indicated by the delayed appearance of dodecanoyl-CoA (C12-CoA) in the absence of significant amounts of downstream metabolites. This experiment demonstrates that 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA is only metabolized via the reductase-dependent pathway and additionally confirms the conclusion reached during the first part of this study that the reduction of 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA is the rate-limiting reaction in the reductase-dependent pathway. The metabolic studies described above were carried out with NAD+, CoASH, and NADPH as cofactors but in the absence of NADH and acetyl-CoA that are present in mitochondria. Because NADH and acetyl-CoA may inhibit β-oxidation enzymes and thereby the flux through the pathways, we assessed their effects on the degradation of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA. For this purpose, we determined the formation of decanoyl-CoA (C10-CoA) and dodecanoyl-CoA (C12-CoA) plus 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (Δ2,4-C14-CoA) as a function of the incubation time to measure fluxes through the isomerase-dependent pathway and reductase-dependent pathway, respectively. Shown in Fig. 5 are the results that were obtained when no NADH (Fig. 5 A), 0.17 mm NADH (Fig. 5 B), or 0.5 mm NADH (Fig. 5 C) was included in the incubation mixture in addition to the required cofactors NAD+, CoASH, and NADPH. When the product formation during the first 3 min was evaluated, the presence of NADH at the lower level resulted in slightly lower rates of β-oxidation but did not affect the relative flux through the reductase-dependent pathway of ∼10%. At the higher NADH concentration, the rate of product formation was further reduced, whereas the relative flux through the reductase-dependent pathway was only slightly increased to ∼15% of the total. Thus, NADH inhibits β-oxidation without significantly affecting the relative contributions of the two pathways to the degradation of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA. The effect of acetyl-CoA on the operation of the two pathways was also investigated. An increasing substitution of up to 80% of CoASH in the incubation mixture by acetyl-CoA did not affect the rate of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA β-oxidation, nor did it change the contributions of the two pathways to this process (data not shown). The demonstration that unsaturated fatty acids with odd-numbered double bonds can be degraded by two pathways, the isomerase-dependent pathway and the reductase-dependent pathway (5Smeland T.E. Nada M. Cuebas D. Schulz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6673-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), prompted the questions as to how much each pathway may contribute to the total flux through β-oxidation and what specific functions the two pathways may have. The focus of this investigation was the β-oxidation of unsaturated dietary fatty acids in mitochondria. Given that oleic acid is abundantly present in the human diet and only contains a 9-cis double bond, it was selected as the fatty acid best suited for this study. The oleate metabolite, 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA,served as the substrate for the required flux measurements and product determinations. Mitochondria from rat heart were used because of their minimal contamination by peroxisomes, which contain a β-oxidation system different from the mitochondrial one. Mitochondria were solubilized with Triton X-100 to obtain a system that, in contrast to intact mitochondria, would permit rate measurements of the individual pathways. The concentration of CoASH was fixed at 0.3 mmbecause this is its estimated concentration in mitochondria that rapidly oxidize fatty acids (23Hansford R.G. Johnson R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8361-8375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of NAD+ and NADPH were set at 1 mm and 0.5 mm, respectively, because these are saturating concentrations even though they are lower than their estimated intramitochondrial concentrations. When rates of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA degradation via the isomerase-dependent pathway were compared with rates of its entry into the reductase-dependent pathway, the former pathway was estimated to account for more than 85% of the β-oxidation of this metabolite of oleic acid. Similar results were obtained when the accumulation of products was determined. Decanoyl-CoA, which is formed via the isomerase-dependent pathway, accounted for 85% of the products formed from 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA. The ratio of substrate utilization via the two pathways varied little over a significant range of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA concentrations and hence may reflect the relative contributions of the two pathways to β-oxidation under a variety of conditions, including conditions that exist in intact mitochondria. However, intramitochondrial conditions may change during β-oxidation, especially as NAD+ is converted to NADH and CoASH to acetyl-CoA. Increased concentrations of NADH and acetyl-CoA may inhibit β-oxidation and thereby affect the relative contributions of the two pathways. This idea was tested by determining the effects that NADH and acetyl-CoA have on the formation of products via the two pathways. When 15% of the total NADH was in the reduced form, the relative contributions of the two pathways were unchanged, even though the total flux through β-oxidation was reduced. An increase of NADH to one-third of the total coenzyme level further reduced the rate of oxidation but only slightly increased the relative contribution of the reductase-dependent pathway from 10% to 15%. Because only 5% of the total NAD+ is estimated to be in the reduced state during fatty acid β-oxidation in actively respiring mitochondria (23Hansford R.G. Johnson R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8361-8375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is unlikely that NADH would significantly change the contribution of the reductase-dependent pathway to oleate β-oxidation. The same conclusion was reached with regard to the effect of acetyl-CoA. This product of β-oxidation affected neither the rate of the process nor the contributions of the two pathways even when it comprised 80% of the total CoA content of the system. A major reason for the limited flux through the reductase-dependent pathway is the rapid and dramatic decrease in the concentration of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA due to its hydration. The consequence is a greatly reduced rate of its isomerization to 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA, the first metabolite of the reductase-dependent pathway. Together, the results of this study lead to the conclusion that the reductase-dependent pathway only makes a minor contribution to the total β-oxidation of oleate. If the reductase-dependent pathway contributes little to the β-oxidation of oleate, what is its metabolic function? In an attempt to answer this question, we studied the degradation of 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA, the first metabolite of oleate with two conjugated double bonds. Although it was assumed that this oleate intermediate could be metabolized via the reductase-dependent pathway, it was uncertain whether it also could be degraded by way of the isomerase-dependent pathway. The results clearly demonstrate that 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA is rapidly converted to 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA, which is reduced by NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase before being degraded by β-oxidation to dodecanoyl-CoA. Because only a trace of decanoyl-CoA was detected, 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA is not a substrate of the isomerase-dependent pathway nor is its product, 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA, effectively degraded by direct β-oxidation. The first observation agrees with the previous conclusion that 3,5-dienoyl-CoAs cannot be metabolized via the isomerase-dependent pathway (9Shoukry K. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6892-6899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This is most likely due to the unfavorable energetics of the 3,5-dienoyl-CoA to 2,5-dienoyl-CoA conversion. Surprising was the observation that 2-trans,4-trans-tetradecadienoyl-CoA, in contrast to the medium-chain metabolite 2-trans,4-trans-octadienoyl-CoA (9Shoukry K. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6892-6899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), was not directly degraded by β-oxidation. It should be noted that 2-trans,4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA but not its 2-trans,4-cis isomer is a substrate, albeit a poor one, of direct β-oxidation (19Cuebas D. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14140-14144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most likely reason for the different reactivities of 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA and 2,4-octadienoyl-CoA is the involvement of two different sets of β-oxidation enzymes. 2,4-Octadienoyl-CoA is presumably hydrated by crotonase and the resultant 3-hydroxyoctanoyl-CoA is dehydrogenated by 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, because both of these enzymes are more active with short-chain and medium-chain substrates than with long-chain ones (17Fong J.C. Schulz H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21He X.-Y. Yang S.-Y. Schulz H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22Uchida Y. Izai K. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1034-1041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA would most likely be acted upon by long-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase and long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase of the trifunctional β-oxidation complex because crotonase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase exhibit little activity toward substrates with acyl chains having 14 carbon atoms (22Uchida Y. Izai K. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1034-1041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the equilibrium concentration of 3-hydroxy-4-enoyl-CoA formed by hydration of 2,4-dienoyl-CoAs is extremely low (equilibrium constant for the hydration is 0.003) (27Yang S.-Y. Cuebas D. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15390-15395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the 3-hydroxy intermediate would only be dehydrogenated at a measurable rate if the catalytic efficiency and concentration of the relevant 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase are sufficiently high. These conditions seem to be met for the matrix 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase acting on 3-hydroxyoct-4-enoyl-CoA but not for long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase catalyzing the dehydrogenation of 3-hydroxy-tetradec-4-enoyl-CoA. The general conclusion is that once 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA has been formed, it can be effectively degraded only via the reductase-dependent pathway. In the absence of this pathway, 3,5-dienoyl-CoAs would most likely accumulate and impair the oxidative function of mitochondria because of a decline of free CoA and possibly by inhibiting some of the enzymes of β-oxidation. The reductase-dependent pathway is, however, the major pathway for the β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids with conjugated double bonds. Such fatty acids, specifically conjugated linoleic acid, are constituents of the human diet because they are formed in ruminants and during the partial hydrogenation of fats. The most common conjugated linoleic acid is 9-cis,11-trans-octadecadienoic acid. β-Oxidation of this fatty acid is expected to produce 3-cis,5-trans-dodecadienoyl-CoA as an intermediate, which can only be degraded by way of the reductase-dependent pathway. As previously pointed out (28Liang X. Zhu D. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13830-13835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), β-oxidation of 9-cis,11-trans-octadecatrienoic acid also yields 2-trans,5-cis,7-trans-tetradecatrienoyl-CoA as an intermediate. This metabolite might be degraded in part via the reductase-dependent pathway that requires the participation of Δ3,5,7,Δ2,4,6-trienoyl-CoA isomerase, which is an inherent activity of dienoyl-CoA isomerase (15Zhang D. Liang X., He, X.-Y. Alipui O.D. Yang S.-Y. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13622-13627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Surprising and interesting was the observed accumulation of 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA during the β-oxidation of either 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA or 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA. This finding prompted the idea that the reaction catalyzed by 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase may limit the flux through the pathway even though the entry into this pathway is already restricted by competition with the dominant isomerase-dependent pathway. A previous evaluation of a possible control exerted by 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase over the β-oxidation of oleic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in cardiomyocytes came to the conclusion that an increase in the activity of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase in response to the treatment of rats with growth hormone did not result in higher rates of β-oxidation (29Nada M.A. Abdel-Aleem S. Schulz H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1255: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It is possible, however, that isolated and mostly quiescent cardiomyocytes are not suitable for such study because their low energy need severely restricts fatty acid oxidation, with the possible result that none of the reactions of β-oxidation is limiting the rate of the energy production. In summary, the reductase-dependent pathway only makes a minor contribution to the β-oxidation of oleic acid, which is mostly degraded via the classical isomerase-dependent pathway. However, the reductase-dependent pathway is essential for the degradation of 3,5-cis-tetradecadienboyl-CoA, which is formed from the oleate metabolite 2-trans,5-cis-teradecadienoyl-CoA by enoyl-CoA isomerase that functions in the isomerase-dependent pathway. The reductase-dependent pathway is also essential for the β-oxidation of conjugated linoleic acid like 9-cis,10-trans-octadecadienoic acid."

TAT-H3, produced by fusion of the protein transduction domain of human immunodeficiency virus-1 TAT to the syntaxin-H3 domain, was rapidly transduced into the subplasmalemmal region in living MIN6 cells. Immunoblotting analysis followed by immunoprecipitation on TAT-H3-treated MIN6 cells showed that TAT-H3 binds SNAP-25 and VAMP-2in vivo. Transduction of MIN6 cells with TAT-H3 caused a decrease in both the first and second phase of insulin release. We therefore quantitatively analyzed approaching, docking, and fusing of green fluorescent protein-labeled single insulin granules in TAT-H3-transduced MIN6 cells by evanescent wave microscopy. Under high glucose stimulation, TAT-H3 treatment not only reduced the fusion events from previously docked granules for the first 120 s (first phase of release) but also strongly inhibited the docking and fusion from newly recruited insulin granules after this point (second phase of release). During the second phase of release we observed a marked reduction in the accumulation of newly docked insulin granules; subsequently, fusion events were significantly decreased. TAT-H3 treatment by itself, however, did not alter the number of previously docked granules without stimulation. We conclude that introduction of the H3 domain into MIN6 cells inhibits biphasic insulin release by two mechanisms. 1) In the first phase of insulin release, the H3 domain interferes with previously docked granules to be fused, and 2) in the second phase of insulin release reduced fusion events result from a marked decline of newly docked granules. Thus, syntaxin-mediated SNARE assembly modulates insulin exocytosis in biphasic insulin release in a distinct way.

Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF)1 attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) are believed to be required for vesicular trafficking such as endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi, Golgi to the plasma membrane, and exocytosis in general (2Rothman J.E.

Syntaxin is a key component of the SNARE complex involved in synaptic vesicle docking and fusion, and it functions as an organizing center for exocytosis (4Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W.

Syntaxin 1 consists of four α-helical domains (Habc domain and SNARE motif (H3 domain)) and a short C-terminal transmembrane domain (6Chapman E.R., An, S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol.

The syntaxin-H3 domain contributes to one of the four α-helical bundles in the SNARE core complex; that is, one helix each from syntaxin-H3 and VAMP and two helices from SNAP-25 (8Sutton R.B.

Using this system, we were able to observe the motion of single insulin granules such as docking and fusion in the exocytotic process during physiological stimulation. The fluorescence imaging excited close to the plasma membrane (within ∼100 nm), allowing us to observe with high resolution the single insulin granules approaching, docking, and fusing with the plasma membrane. In the current study, in addition to the above-described system we used the powerful strategy of a protein transduction system; that is, the protein transduction domain (PTD) of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 TAT protein, which has been shown to cross biological membranes efficiently and independently via transporters and specific receptors and to promote delivery of peptides and proteins into cells (16Frankel A.D.

Cell. 1988; 55: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). We produced expression vectors encoding GFP- or syntaxin-H3-domain-fused TAT PTD. We found that TAT PTD fusion proteins rapidly transduced into nearly 100% of MIN6 β cells.In the present study, we used TAT PTD fusion protein and GFP-tagged single insulin granule analysis in living pancreatic β cells combined with evanescent wave microscopy to refine the in vivointeraction of syntaxin-mediated SNARE assembly and insulin exocytosis. Our results provide the new aspect showing that syntaxin-mediated SNARE assembly modulates docking and fusion of insulin granule in biphasic insulin release.DISCUSSIONThe importance of SNARE assembly in the secretory system has been suggested using permeabilized cells and electrophysiological analysis with a microinjection system (24Zhong P.

However, the physiological interaction of SNAREs in vivo with vesicular movement in the exocytotic process is yet to be determined because these systems are not suitable to resolve single granules approaching, docking, and fusing with plasma membrane during continuous secretagogue stimulation. Indeed, earlier experiments using these systems could reveal that the recombinant H3 domain inhibited neurotransmitter release by forming nonfunctional SNARE complexes (24Zhong P. Chen Y.A. Tam D. Chung D. Scheller R.H. Miljanich G.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4317-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25O'Connor V. Heuss C., De Bello W.M. Dresbach T. Charlton M.P. Hunt J.H.

A. 1997; 94: 12186-12191Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); however, these findings were limited to the analysis concerning rapid exocytosis from previously docked synaptic vesicles. To overcome these problems, we have established a GFP-labeled insulin granule system combined with evanescent wave microscopy, which is a powerful system that analyzes the single granule motion in biphasic insulin release as described previously (15Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nakamichi Y. Tanaka T. Ishida H. Nagamatsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3805-3808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the present study, we combined this image analysis system with the TAT PTD fusion protein system to quickly deliver the protein into living cells, which allowed us to clarify the SNARE function in docking and fusion of insulin granules that originated from both previously docked granules and newly recruited docked granules during continuous glucose stimulation. Thus, the present work extends previous investigations by imaging the docking and fusion of secretory granules, thereby revealing the interaction of syntaxin-mediated SNARE assembly and docking and fusion of newly recruited granules in living β cells.The SNARE motif (H3 domain) of syntaxin 1 contributes one helix to the four-helical bundle of the SNARE complex, composed of syntaxin 1, SNAP-25, and VAMP-2 (8Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). We examined how transduction of MIN6 cells with TAT-H3 affects the formation of the SNARE complex in living MIN6 β cells. The data obtained from immunoblot analysis followed by immunoprecipitation on TAT-H3-transduced MIN6 cells showed that TAT-H3 is able to bind SNAP-25 and VAMP-2 and form particular complexes, including binary and ternary SNARE complexes, that prevent assembling the functional SNARE complex with endogenous syntaxin 1. This finding is in agreement with previously reported in vitro binding studies (24Zhong P. Chen Y.A. Tam D. Chung D. Scheller R.H. Miljanich G.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4317-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25O'Connor V. Heuss C., De Bello W.M. Dresbach T. Charlton M.P. Hunt J.H. Pellegrini L.L. Hodel A. Burger M.M. Betz H.

Consistent with previous results that show the recombinant H3 domain inhibits the neurotransmitter release (24Zhong P. Chen Y.A. Tam D. Chung D. Scheller R.H. Miljanich G.P.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9142-9150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TAT-H3-transduced MIN6 cells exhibit a marked suppression of glucose-stimulated insulin release as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.To identify the mechanism by which introduction of the H3 domain into MIN6 cells inhibits insulin release (slight decrease in the first phase and marked decrease in the second phase), we monitored the behavior of single insulin granule movement using evanescent wave microscopy. The most marked effect of TAT-H3 treatment on docking and fusion of insulin granules was observed during the second phase of insulin release. Notably, our image analysis system allowed us to visualize that the supply of newly recruited granules to the plasma membrane was strongly inhibited by TAT-H3 treatment, which caused an eventual decrease in the number of granules docked to the plasma membrane during continuous glucose stimulation. As a result, fusion events in the second phase of insulin release were markedly diminished. Thus, our image analysis showed that TAT-H3 treatment prevents docking of newly recruited insulin granules to the plasma membrane, which subsequently reduced the fusion events in the second phase of insulin release.How does TAT-H3 inhibit the docking of newly recruited granules to the plasma membrane in the second phase of insulin release? Previous reports using in vitro binding studies demonstrated that disruption of the interaction between syntaxin and SNAP-25 by the recombinant H3 fragment caused the inhibition of the neurotransmitter release (24Zhong P. Chen Y.A. Tam D. Chung D. Scheller R.H. Miljanich G.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4317-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25O'Connor V. Heuss C., De Bello W.M. Dresbach T. Charlton M.P.

In the present study, we also found that TAT-H3 produced the assembled formation of a binary SNARE complex of H3 and SNAP-25. These results indicate that the H3 domain interferes with syntaxin binding to SNAP-25. Because the formation of a binary complex of syntaxin and SNAP-25 is essential before ternary SNARE assembly by the binding of VAMP-2 (34Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 35Fiebig K.M. Rice L.M. Pollock E. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the introduction of the H3 domain into cells inhibits the binding of endogenous syntaxin to SNAP-25, which prevents a subsequent binding of VAMP-2. As a result, the newly recruited insulin granules cannot dock to the plasma membrane. Of course, the possibility that the H3 domain interrupts the association of syntaxin and munc18-1 cannot be ruled out. The relationship between syntaxin 1 and munc18-1 might be important; munc18-1, a cytosolic partner of syntaxin 1, is known to function upstream of the SNARE complex and to act as a regulator of large dense-core vesicles docking (36Voets T. Toonen R.F. Brian E.C. de Wit H. Moser T. Rettig J. Sudhof T.C. Neher E. Verhage M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Possibly, the formation of the munc18-1 and syntaxin 1 complex in its closed configuration, which facilitates the docking of large dense-core vesicles (36Voets T. Toonen R.F. Brian E.C. de Wit H. Moser T. Rettig J. Sudhof T.C. Neher E. Verhage M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), is interrupted by the introduction of a large molar excess of the H3 domain into cells despite the fact that the H3 domain directly cannot bind munc18-1 (37Kee Y. Lin R.C. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 991-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).The transduction of MIN6 cells with TAT-H3 also inhibited fusion events in the first phase of insulin release from previously docked granules, although it did not have a marked effect during the second phase of insulin release. Because TAT-H3 treatment had no effect on 1) the number of granules previously docked to the plasma membrane without stimulation, 2) intracellular calcium concentrations, and 3) the fusion kinetics of individual insulin granule, TAT-H3-induced reduction of the fusion events from previously docked granules may result from an interference of the priming stage in insulin exocytosis. The recent model of the role of the SNARE complex in exocytosis suggests that SNARE complexes exist in a dynamic equilibrium between a loose, neurotoxin-sensitive state and a tight, neurotoxin-insensitive state (31Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2001; 30: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 38Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H.

Cell. 1999; 99: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Chen et al. (31Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2001; 30: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) suggest that SNAREs partially and reversibly assemble during MgATP-dependent priming in permeabilized PC12 cells. Therefore, when endogenous SNARE assembly forms a loose complex during the priming stage in insulin exocytosis, TAT-H3 may break into these flexible SNARE complexes, thereby replacing the endogenous syntaxin1 with exogenous TAT-H3. Indeed, in TAT-H3-treated MIN6 cells, a ternary SNARE complex (∼60 kDa) of TAT-H3, SNAP-25, and VAMP-2 was detected by immunoblotting analysis. We interpret the decreased fusion events from previously docked granules in the first phase of insulin release because such a nonfunctional SNARE complex cannot be disassembled in the α-SNAP/NSF-mediated process (37Kee Y. Lin R.C. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 991-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 40Hayashi T. Yamasaki S. Nauenburg S. Binz T. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that TAT-H3 inhibits the fusion from previously docked granules, possibly mediated by interrupting the priming stage.In conclusion, introduction of the syntaxin-H3 domain into MIN6 cells reduced the number of fusion events of insulin granules by two mechanisms, 1) interfering with previously docked granules to be fused during the first phase of insulin release and 2) strong inhibition of newly recruited granules to be docked to the plasma membrane during the second phase of insulin release. Thus, by combining a TAT fusion protein transduction system with real-time image analysis system using evanescent wave microscopy, we were able to reveal in vivointeraction of SNARE assembly and the exocytotic process of insulin granules, such as docking and fusion in biphasic insulin release. In pancreatic β cells, the hormone insulin is stored in large dense-core vesicles and is released by exocytosis when glucose levels rise (1Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Regazzi R. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 276-297Google Scholar). Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF)1 attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) are believed to be required for vesicular trafficking such as endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi, Golgi to the plasma membrane, and exocytosis in general (2Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar, 3Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Syntaxin is a key component of the SNARE complex involved in synaptic vesicle docking and fusion, and it functions as an organizing center for exocytosis (4Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar, 5Wu M.N. Fergestad T. Lloyd T.E., He, Y. Broadie K. Bellen H.J. Neuron. 1999; 23: 593-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Syntaxin 1 consists of four α-helical domains (Habc domain and SNARE motif (H3 domain)) and a short C-terminal transmembrane domain (6Chapman E.R., An, S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Fernandez I. Ubach J. Dulubova I. Zhang X. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Cell. 1998; 94: 841-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The syntaxin-H3 domain contributes to one of the four α-helical bundles in the SNARE core complex; that is, one helix each from syntaxin-H3 and VAMP and two helices from SNAP-25 (8Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar), suggesting the H3 domain is the most critical domain in the molecular function of syntaxin. SNAREs are expressed in pancreatic β cells (9Jacobsson G. Bean A.J. Scheller R.H. Juntti-Berggren L. Deeney J.T. Berggren P.O. Meister B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1340-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We and others previously demonstrated that the SNARE hypothesis may be applicable to insulin exocytosis in pancreatic β cells (11Nagamatsu S. Fujiwara T. Nakamichi Y. Watanabe T. Katahira H. Sawa H.

Soria B. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 860-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the precise interaction between the syntaxin-mediated SNARE complex and the dynamics of docking and fusing insulin granules in living pancreatic β cells remains unclear. Recently, we developed a new approach using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged insulin granule system combined with evanescent wave microscopy (15Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nakamichi Y. Tanaka T. Ishida H. Nagamatsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3805-3808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Using this system, we were able to observe the motion of single insulin granules such as docking and fusion in the exocytotic process during physiological stimulation. The fluorescence imaging excited close to the plasma membrane (within ∼100 nm), allowing us to observe with high resolution the single insulin granules approaching, docking, and fusing with the plasma membrane. In the current study, in addition to the above-described system we used the powerful strategy of a protein transduction system; that is, the protein transduction domain (PTD) of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 TAT protein, which has been shown to cross biological membranes efficiently and independently via transporters and specific receptors and to promote delivery of peptides and proteins into cells (16Frankel A.D.

Because TAT-H3 treatment had no effect on 1) the number of granules previously docked to the plasma membrane without stimulation, 2) intracellular calcium concentrations, and 3) the fusion kinetics of individual insulin granule, TAT-H3-induced reduction of the fusion events from previously docked granules may result from an interference of the priming stage in insulin exocytosis. The recent model of the role of the SNARE complex in exocytosis suggests that SNARE complexes exist in a dynamic equilibrium between a loose, neurotoxin-sensitive state and a tight, neurotoxin-insensitive state (31Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2001; 30: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 38Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H.

Neuron. 2001; 30: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) suggest that SNAREs partially and reversibly assemble during MgATP-dependent priming in permeabilized PC12 cells. Therefore, when endogenous SNARE assembly forms a loose complex during the priming stage in insulin exocytosis, TAT-H3 may break into these flexible SNARE complexes, thereby replacing the endogenous syntaxin1 with exogenous TAT-H3. Indeed, in TAT-H3-treated MIN6 cells, a ternary SNARE complex (∼60 kDa) of TAT-H3, SNAP-25, and VAMP-2 was detected by immunoblotting analysis. We interpret the decreased fusion events from previously docked granules in the first phase of insulin release because such a nonfunctional SNARE complex cannot be disassembled in the α-SNAP/NSF-mediated process (37Kee Y. Lin R.C. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 991-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 40Hayashi T. Yamasaki S. Nauenburg S. Binz T. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that TAT-H3 inhibits the fusion from previously docked granules, possibly mediated by interrupting the priming stage.In conclusion, introduction of the syntaxin-H3 domain into MIN6 cells reduced the number of fusion events of insulin granules by two mechanisms, 1) interfering with previously docked granules to be fused during the first phase of insulin release and 2) strong inhibition of newly recruited granules to be docked to the plasma membrane during the second phase of insulin release. Thus, by combining a TAT fusion protein transduction system with real-time image analysis system using evanescent wave microscopy, we were able to reveal in vivointeraction of SNARE assembly and the exocytotic process of insulin granules, such as docking and fusion in biphasic insulin release. The importance of SNARE assembly in the secretory system has been suggested using permeabilized cells and electrophysiological analysis with a microinjection system (24Zhong P. Chen Y.A. Tam D.

However, the physiological interaction of SNAREs in vivo with vesicular movement in the exocytotic process is yet to be determined because these systems are not suitable to resolve single granules approaching, docking, and fusing with plasma membrane during continuous secretagogue stimulation. Indeed, earlier experiments using these systems could reveal that the recombinant H3 domain inhibited neurotransmitter release by forming nonfunctional SNARE complexes (24Zhong P. Chen Y.A. Tam D. Chung D. Scheller R.H. Miljanich G.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4317-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25O'Connor V. Heuss C., De Bello W.M. Dresbach T. Charlton M.P. Hunt J.H.

A. 1997; 94: 12186-12191Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); however, these findings were limited to the analysis concerning rapid exocytosis from previously docked synaptic vesicles. To overcome these problems, we have established a GFP-labeled insulin granule system combined with evanescent wave microscopy, which is a powerful system that analyzes the single granule motion in biphasic insulin release as described previously (15Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nakamichi Y. Tanaka T. Ishida H. Nagamatsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3805-3808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the present study, we combined this image analysis system with the TAT PTD fusion protein system to quickly deliver the protein into living cells, which allowed us to clarify the SNARE function in docking and fusion of insulin granules that originated from both previously docked granules and newly recruited docked granules during continuous glucose stimulation. Thus, the present work extends previous investigations by imaging the docking and fusion of secretory granules, thereby revealing the interaction of syntaxin-mediated SNARE assembly and docking and fusion of newly recruited granules in living β cells. The SNARE motif (H3 domain) of syntaxin 1 contributes one helix to the four-helical bundle of the SNARE complex, composed of syntaxin 1, SNAP-25, and VAMP-2 (8Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). We examined how transduction of MIN6 cells with TAT-H3 affects the formation of the SNARE complex in living MIN6 β cells. The data obtained from immunoblot analysis followed by immunoprecipitation on TAT-H3-transduced MIN6 cells showed that TAT-H3 is able to bind SNAP-25 and VAMP-2 and form particular complexes, including binary and ternary SNARE complexes, that prevent assembling the functional SNARE complex with endogenous syntaxin 1. This finding is in agreement with previously reported in vitro binding studies (24Zhong P. Chen Y.A. Tam D. Chung D. Scheller R.H. Miljanich G.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4317-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25O'Connor V. Heuss C., De Bello W.M. Dresbach T. Charlton M.P. Hunt J.H. Pellegrini L.L. Hodel A. Burger M.M. Betz H.

Consistent with previous results that show the recombinant H3 domain inhibits the neurotransmitter release (24Zhong P. Chen Y.A. Tam D. Chung D. Scheller R.H. Miljanich G.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4317-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25O'Connor V. Heuss C., De Bello W.M. Dresbach T. Charlton M.P. Hunt J.H. Pellegrini L.L. Hodel A. Burger M.M. Betz H.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9142-9150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TAT-H3-transduced MIN6 cells exhibit a marked suppression of glucose-stimulated insulin release as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To identify the mechanism by which introduction of the H3 domain into MIN6 cells inhibits insulin release (slight decrease in the first phase and marked decrease in the second phase), we monitored the behavior of single insulin granule movement using evanescent wave microscopy. The most marked effect of TAT-H3 treatment on docking and fusion of insulin granules was observed during the second phase of insulin release. Notably, our image analysis system allowed us to visualize that the supply of newly recruited granules to the plasma membrane was strongly inhibited by TAT-H3 treatment, which caused an eventual decrease in the number of granules docked to the plasma membrane during continuous glucose stimulation. As a result, fusion events in the second phase of insulin release were markedly diminished. Thus, our image analysis showed that TAT-H3 treatment prevents docking of newly recruited insulin granules to the plasma membrane, which subsequently reduced the fusion events in the second phase of insulin release. How does TAT-H3 inhibit the docking of newly recruited granules to the plasma membrane in the second phase of insulin release? Previous reports using in vitro binding studies demonstrated that disruption of the interaction between syntaxin and SNAP-25 by the recombinant H3 fragment caused the inhibition of the neurotransmitter release (24Zhong P. Chen Y.A. Tam D. Chung D. Scheller R.H. Miljanich G.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4317-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25O'Connor V. Heuss C., De Bello W.M. Dresbach T. Charlton M.P.

In the present study, we also found that TAT-H3 produced the assembled formation of a binary SNARE complex of H3 and SNAP-25. These results indicate that the H3 domain interferes with syntaxin binding to SNAP-25. Because the formation of a binary complex of syntaxin and SNAP-25 is essential before ternary SNARE assembly by the binding of VAMP-2 (34Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 35Fiebig K.M. Rice L.M. Pollock E. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the introduction of the H3 domain into cells inhibits the binding of endogenous syntaxin to SNAP-25, which prevents a subsequent binding of VAMP-2. As a result, the newly recruited insulin granules cannot dock to the plasma membrane. Of course, the possibility that the H3 domain interrupts the association of syntaxin and munc18-1 cannot be ruled out. The relationship between syntaxin 1 and munc18-1 might be important; munc18-1, a cytosolic partner of syntaxin 1, is known to function upstream of the SNARE complex and to act as a regulator of large dense-core vesicles docking (36Voets T.

Possibly, the formation of the munc18-1 and syntaxin 1 complex in its closed configuration, which facilitates the docking of large dense-core vesicles (36Voets T. Toonen R.F. Brian E.C. de Wit H. Moser T. Rettig J. Sudhof T.C. Neher E. Verhage M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), is interrupted by the introduction of a large molar excess of the H3 domain into cells despite the fact that the H3 domain directly cannot bind munc18-1 (37Kee Y. Lin R.C. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 991-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The transduction of MIN6 cells with TAT-H3 also inhibited fusion events in the first phase of insulin release from previously docked granules, although it did not have a marked effect during the second phase of insulin release. Because TAT-H3 treatment had no effect on 1) the number of granules previously docked to the plasma membrane without stimulation, 2) intracellular calcium concentrations, and 3) the fusion kinetics of individual insulin granule, TAT-H3-induced reduction of the fusion events from previously docked granules may result from an interference of the priming stage in insulin exocytosis.

While only a small amount of prothrombin is activated at the moment of clotting, the remaining prothrombin is activated predominantly after clot formation (1Rand M.D. Lock J.B. van't Veer C. Gaffney D.P. Mann K.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 3432-3445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the recently proposed notion (2Bouma B.N. von dem Borne P.A.K. Meijers J.C.M. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 80: 24-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that activation of the extrinsic pathway is responsible for the rapid generation of a small amount of thrombin, which is sufficient for clot formation; however, activation of the intrinsic pathway is responsible for a massive production of thrombin mostly after clot formation, which effectively augments the antifibrinolytic properties of the clot. Such an intrinsic pathway-mediated thrombin burst is critically dependent on a feedback activation mechanism mediated by thrombin-catalyzed activation of factor XI (3Von dem Borne P.A.K. Meijers J.C.M. Bouma B.N. Blood. 1995; 86: 3035-3042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Von dem Borne P.A.K. Bajzar L. Meijers J.C.M. Nesheim M.E. Bouma B.N. J. Clin.

During coagulation, TAFI is proteolytically activated by thrombin in a TM-dependent manner to its active form, TAFIa, which inhibits fibrinolysis by removing the carboxyl-terminal lysine and arginine residues from partially degraded fibrin (5Nesheim M. Wang W. Boffa M. Nagashima M. Morser J. Bajzar L. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 6Bouma B.N. Marx P.F. Mosnier L.O. Meijers J.C.M. Thromb. Res. 2001; 101: 329-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As activation of TAFI requires exposure to relatively high concentrations of thrombin, the intrinsic pathway-mediated thrombin generation plays a pivotal role in the regulation of fibrinolysis (7Bouma B.N. Mosnier L.O. Meijers J.C. Griffin J.H. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).The accompanying paper (8Nagashima H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50439-50444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) demonstrates the differential actions on thrombin generation by two different anticoagulant protease inhibitors DX-9065a (9Hara T. Yokoyama A. Ishihara H. Yokoyama Y. Nagahara T. Iwamoto M. Thromb. Haemost. 1994; 71: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and argatroban (10Kikumoto R. Tamao Y. Tezuka T. Tonomura S. Hara H. Ninomiya K. Hijikata A. Okamoto S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Both theoretical and experimental approaches (8Nagashima H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50439-50444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) revealed that the thrombin inhibitor, argatroban, yielded a stronger inhibitory effect on thrombin generation than the fXa inhibitor, DX-9065a, while the two inhibitors prolonged clot time to a similar extent when coagulation was triggered by the extrinsic pathway stimuli of the same intensity. Since thrombin generation is known to be an important determinant of fibrinolytic resistance in clots formed during coagulation, the two compounds were compared by tPA-induced clot lysis assays. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that the two anticoagulant protease inhibitors exert differential effects on TAFI activation, thereby, differentially affecting fibrinolytic resistance of the clots formed under the influence of these inhibitors.DISCUSSIONTAFI is activated by relatively high concentrations of thrombin generated via an intrinsic pathway-mediated secondary burst of thrombin generation (2Bouma B.N. von dem Borne P.A.K. Meijers J.C.M. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 80: 24-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The present study examined the effects of DX-9065a and argatroban on TAFI activation in relation to the antifibrinolytic resistance of a clot formed during coagulation. The clot-to-lysis time, which was determined as the time required for clot dissolution after clot formation, was significantly shortened by argatroban but not by DX-9065a. The observed inhibitory effect of argatroban on TAFI activation (Fig. 2 B) can provide a clear explanation for why this compound accelerates dissolution of clots during tPA-induced fibrinolysis (Fig. 1 B).It has been reported previously that TM can accelerate thrombin-mediated TAFI activation by more than 1000-fold (12Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Fig. 4demonstrates such a TM-dependent activation of TAFI during plasma coagulation. Addition of TM at a concentration of 10 nm greatly enhanced TAFI activation in plasma at both high and low TF concentrations. However, when TM was not added to the plasma mixtures TAFI activity increased only marginally, and this could only be observed at the higher TF concentration (Fig. 5, open circles). Although assessed separately, TAFI activation (Fig. 5) and the corresponding clot-to-lysis times (indicated as the values without inhibitors in Fig. 4 B) showed a correlation such that an increase in TAFI activity was associated with increased clot-to-lysis times. The two compounds showed only a marginal difference in clot-to-lysis time when they were compared without TM at the lower TF concentration (Figs. 3 A and 4 B), the experimental conditions corresponding to those when TAFI was not activated to a significant extent (Fig. 5, open triangles). These observations are consistent with a view that the two compounds can produce differential fibrinolysis mainly through TAFI activation.As shown in Fig. 6, DX-9065a and argatroban differentially affected thrombin generation both in the absence and presence of TM, although the differences observed with the added TM were somewhat smaller than those seen without. Similarly, the relationship seen in the ETP-clot time curves obtained with varying tissue factor concentrations (see Fig. 4 in the accompanying paper (8Nagashima H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50439-50444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)) shows that the differences between the two compounds were less evident at lower tissue factor concentrations and, therefore, with smaller ETP values. However, the differential effects on ETP were still sufficiently evident with added TM (Fig. 6 B), in agreement with those effects observed on fibrinolysis as well as on TAFI activation in the presence of TM. Thus these observations support the view that thrombin generation is an important determinant for TAFI-mediated regulation of fibrinolysis.By virtue of the activation mechanism of TAFI by thrombin generation, one may choose two different approaches for anticoagulation therapy. One approach utilizes the anticoagulants, such as argatroban, that can accomplish not only anticoagulation but also suppression of TAFI activation leading to accelerated fibrinolysis of the clot formed during drug treatment. An alternative approach utilizes other anticoagulants, such as DX-9065a, that can accomplish anticoagulation with less effects on fibrinolysis as well as on TAFI activation. At least in theory, the former approach might serve to facilitate fibrinolytic therapy, whereas the latter approach would be associated with a reduced risk for bleeding complications. Earlier studies also showed that argatroban accelerates clot lysis both in vitro(14Tamao Y. Yamamoto T. Kikumoto R. Hara H. Itoh J. Hirata T. Mineo K. Okamoto S. Thromb. Haemost. 1986; 56: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and in vivo (14Tamao Y. Yamamoto T. Kikumoto R. Hara H. Itoh J. Hirata T. Mineo K. Okamoto S. Thromb. Haemost. 1986; 56: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Boeve T.J. Reed G.L. de Oliveira N.C. Titus J. Janssens S. Giugliano R.P. Torchiana D. Daggett W. Schwarz R. Jang I.K. J. Thromb. Thrombolysis. 1998; 6: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It seems probable that argatroban may result in clots that are more susceptible to fibrinolysis and, thereby, may be beneficial for fibrinolytic therapy. However, bleeding could be a serious drug-related complication associated with such a combination therapy.Previous data on animal experiments have demonstrated that synthetic, low molecular weight fXa inhibitors, such as DX-9065a, can exert antithrombotic effects with little prolongation of a bleeding time assay compared with the other currently used anticoagulant agents (16Morishima Y. Tanabe K. Terada Y. Hara T. Kunitada S. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 1366-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Tanabe K. Morishima Y. Shibutani T. Terada Y. Hara T. Shinohara Y. Aoyagi K.

Pharmacol. 2000; 395: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It seems possible that TAFI activation might contribute to clot protection particularly when blood is exposed to high concentrations of thrombomodulin and/or TF in the damaged tissues; situations that are conceivable in bleeding time assays. However, this explanation presently awaits further verification. So far there have been few studies that demonstrate the relationship between fibrinolysis and bleeding time assays. Thus further studies are needed to determine whether the TAFI-mediated inhibition of fibrinolysis is a mechanism for the lower bleeding times observed with the synthetic fXa inhibitors. Thrombin plays a central role in thrombosis and hemostasis. While only a small amount of prothrombin is activated at the moment of clotting, the remaining prothrombin is activated predominantly after clot formation (1Rand M.D. Lock J.B. van't Veer C. Gaffney D.P. Mann K.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 3432-3445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the recently proposed notion (2Bouma B.N. von dem Borne P.A.K. Meijers J.C.M.

During coagulation, TAFI is proteolytically activated by thrombin in a TM-dependent manner to its active form, TAFIa, which inhibits fibrinolysis by removing the carboxyl-terminal lysine and arginine residues from partially degraded fibrin (5Nesheim M. Wang W. Boffa M. Nagashima M. Morser J. Bajzar L. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 6Bouma B.N. Marx P.F. Mosnier L.O. Meijers J.C.M. Thromb. Res. 2001; 101: 329-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As activation of TAFI requires exposure to relatively high concentrations of thrombin, the intrinsic pathway-mediated thrombin generation plays a pivotal role in the regulation of fibrinolysis (7Bouma B.N. Mosnier L.O. Meijers J.C. Griffin J.H. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The accompanying paper (8Nagashima H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50439-50444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) demonstrates the differential actions on thrombin generation by two different anticoagulant protease inhibitors DX-9065a (9Hara T. Yokoyama A. Ishihara H. Yokoyama Y. Nagahara T. Iwamoto M. Thromb. Haemost. 1994; 71: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and argatroban (10Kikumoto R. Tamao Y. Tezuka T. Tonomura S. Hara H. Ninomiya K. Hijikata A. Okamoto S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Both theoretical and experimental approaches (8Nagashima H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50439-50444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) revealed that the thrombin inhibitor, argatroban, yielded a stronger inhibitory effect on thrombin generation than the fXa inhibitor, DX-9065a, while the two inhibitors prolonged clot time to a similar extent when coagulation was triggered by the extrinsic pathway stimuli of the same intensity. Since thrombin generation is known to be an important determinant of fibrinolytic resistance in clots formed during coagulation, the two compounds were compared by tPA-induced clot lysis assays. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that the two anticoagulant protease inhibitors exert differential effects on TAFI activation, thereby, differentially affecting fibrinolytic resistance of the clots formed under the influence of these inhibitors. DISCUSSIONTAFI is activated by relatively high concentrations of thrombin generated via an intrinsic pathway-mediated secondary burst of thrombin generation (2Bouma B.N. von dem Borne P.A.K. Meijers J.C.M. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 80: 24-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The present study examined the effects of DX-9065a and argatroban on TAFI activation in relation to the antifibrinolytic resistance of a clot formed during coagulation. The clot-to-lysis time, which was determined as the time required for clot dissolution after clot formation, was significantly shortened by argatroban but not by DX-9065a. The observed inhibitory effect of argatroban on TAFI activation (Fig. 2 B) can provide a clear explanation for why this compound accelerates dissolution of clots during tPA-induced fibrinolysis (Fig. 1 B).It has been reported previously that TM can accelerate thrombin-mediated TAFI activation by more than 1000-fold (12Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Fig. 4demonstrates such a TM-dependent activation of TAFI during plasma coagulation. Addition of TM at a concentration of 10 nm greatly enhanced TAFI activation in plasma at both high and low TF concentrations. However, when TM was not added to the plasma mixtures TAFI activity increased only marginally, and this could only be observed at the higher TF concentration (Fig. 5, open circles). Although assessed separately, TAFI activation (Fig. 5) and the corresponding clot-to-lysis times (indicated as the values without inhibitors in Fig. 4 B) showed a correlation such that an increase in TAFI activity was associated with increased clot-to-lysis times. The two compounds showed only a marginal difference in clot-to-lysis time when they were compared without TM at the lower TF concentration (Figs. 3 A and 4 B), the experimental conditions corresponding to those when TAFI was not activated to a significant extent (Fig. 5, open triangles). These observations are consistent with a view that the two compounds can produce differential fibrinolysis mainly through TAFI activation.As shown in Fig. 6, DX-9065a and argatroban differentially affected thrombin generation both in the absence and presence of TM, although the differences observed with the added TM were somewhat smaller than those seen without. Similarly, the relationship seen in the ETP-clot time curves obtained with varying tissue factor concentrations (see Fig. 4 in the accompanying paper (8Nagashima H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50439-50444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)) shows that the differences between the two compounds were less evident at lower tissue factor concentrations and, therefore, with smaller ETP values. However, the differential effects on ETP were still sufficiently evident with added TM (Fig. 6 B), in agreement with those effects observed on fibrinolysis as well as on TAFI activation in the presence of TM. Thus these observations support the view that thrombin generation is an important determinant for TAFI-mediated regulation of fibrinolysis.By virtue of the activation mechanism of TAFI by thrombin generation, one may choose two different approaches for anticoagulation therapy. One approach utilizes the anticoagulants, such as argatroban, that can accomplish not only anticoagulation but also suppression of TAFI activation leading to accelerated fibrinolysis of the clot formed during drug treatment. An alternative approach utilizes other anticoagulants, such as DX-9065a, that can accomplish anticoagulation with less effects on fibrinolysis as well as on TAFI activation. At least in theory, the former approach might serve to facilitate fibrinolytic therapy, whereas the latter approach would be associated with a reduced risk for bleeding complications. Earlier studies also showed that argatroban accelerates clot lysis both in vitro(14Tamao Y. Yamamoto T. Kikumoto R. Hara H. Itoh J. Hirata T. Mineo K. Okamoto S. Thromb. Haemost. 1986; 56: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and in vivo (14Tamao Y. Yamamoto T. Kikumoto R. Hara H. Itoh J. Hirata T. Mineo K. Okamoto S. Thromb. Haemost. 1986; 56: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Boeve T.J. Reed G.L. de Oliveira N.C. Titus J. Janssens S. Giugliano R.P. Torchiana D. Daggett W. Schwarz R. Jang I.K. J. Thromb. Thrombolysis. 1998; 6: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It seems probable that argatroban may result in clots that are more susceptible to fibrinolysis and, thereby, may be beneficial for fibrinolytic therapy. However, bleeding could be a serious drug-related complication associated with such a combination therapy.Previous data on animal experiments have demonstrated that synthetic, low molecular weight fXa inhibitors, such as DX-9065a, can exert antithrombotic effects with little prolongation of a bleeding time assay compared with the other currently used anticoagulant agents (16Morishima Y. Tanabe K. Terada Y. Hara T. Kunitada S. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 1366-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Tanabe K. Morishima Y. Shibutani T. Terada Y. Hara T. Shinohara Y. Aoyagi K.

It seems possible that TAFI activation might contribute to clot protection particularly when blood is exposed to high concentrations of thrombomodulin and/or TF in the damaged tissues; situations that are conceivable in bleeding time assays. However, this explanation presently awaits further verification. So far there have been few studies that demonstrate the relationship between fibrinolysis and bleeding time assays. Thus further studies are needed to determine whether the TAFI-mediated inhibition of fibrinolysis is a mechanism for the lower bleeding times observed with the synthetic fXa inhibitors. TAFI is activated by relatively high concentrations of thrombin generated via an intrinsic pathway-mediated secondary burst of thrombin generation (2Bouma B.N. von dem Borne P.A.K. Meijers J.C.M.

https://openalex.org/W2113652223,"We investigated whether changes in cardiac work or in Ca2+ fluxes may affect the expression of sarcolemmal or sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ channels (DHPRs and RyRs, respectively). Isolated rat hearts were perfused at low Ca2+ concentration (0.8 mM instead of 1.5 mM), at low preload (5 cm instead of 20 cm), in the presence of 100 nM nifedipine or with a cardioplegic solution. After 60 min, hypocalcemic perfusion produced significant reduction in [3H]-PN 200-110 and [3H]-ryanodine binding, due to approximately 30% reduction in Bmax (P<0.01), with unchanged Kd. Such modifications were reversible. Similar results were obtained in the nifedipine and cardioplegia groups. Low preload perfusion produced similar contractile effects as hypocalcemic perfusion, but it had no effect on radioligand binding. After hypocalcemic perfusion, DHPR and RyR gene expression, evaluated by RT-PCR, were not modified. Chelerythrine (protein kinase C inhibitor) and lavendustin C (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor), but not H-89 (protein kinase A inhibitor), abolished the effects of hypocalcemic perfusion on [3H]-PN 200-110 and [3H]-ryanodine binding. We conclude that reduced Ca2+ entry and/or intracellular Ca2+ cycling determines DHPR and RyR remodeling through posttranslational protein modifications. Both protein kinase C and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II appear to play a role in this phenomenon."

Among the crucial mediators of activity-dependent gene expression is the activation of voltage- and ligand-gated Ca2+channels and the subsequent influx of calcium (1West A.E. Chen W.G. Dalva M.B.

For example, in cultured cerebellar granule cells, it is established that a small rise in intracellular Ca2+concentrations (usually evoked by depolarizing concentrations of KCl) leads to cell survival, probably because of increased gene transcription (3Gallo V.

Epilepsy Res. 1999; 36: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, in T-lymphocytes, in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, one of the most important molecular switches for Ca2+-dependent gene transcription appears to be the serine-threonine phosphatase calcineurin (8Rao A.

Calcineurin can dephosphorylate transcription factors (e.g. NFAT) or can contrast the effects of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases on cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) 1The abbreviations used are: CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; PSD, post-synaptic density; RT, reverse transcription; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid by controlling the activity of protein phosphatase 1 (12Bito H.

Alongside components of the calcium signaling machinery, it is probable that other key cellular functions are affected by Ca2+influx at the transcriptional level. In neurons, the post-synaptic density (PSD) is a complex-scaffolding structure that plays a pivotal role in spatially organizing receptors and signaling effectors, thus leading to a broad functional organization of the synapse (20Kennedy M.B. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 26: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Because the PSD is a dynamic structure, it can be hypothesized that it could be modified to support changes in the neuronal activity that may occur. The family of MALS proteins (MALS-1–3, also known as mLin-7 or Veli) has emerged as a key component of the post-synaptic density (21Jo K. Derin R. Li M. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4189-4199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Misawa H. Kawasaki Y. Mellor J. Sweeney N. Jo K. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9264-9272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and is thought to play a role in the trafficking and docking of plasma membrane receptors, e.g. to the NR2B subunit of the glutamate NMDA receptor (23Setou M. Nakagawa T. Seog D.H. Hirokawa N. Science. 2000; 288: 1796-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), and play a role in neurotransmitter vesicle exocytosis (24Butz S. Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Because in cerebellar granule cells, depolarization by mimicking synaptic activity induces numerous changes that should influence the post-synaptic density (e.g. switches in glutamate receptor subtypes) (25Condorelli D.F.

Riva M.A. Brain. Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we have investigated whether such changes could be paralleled by changes in MALS levels. This would represent a way for extracellular stimuli to induce maturation and plasticity of synapses. We now report that MALS-1 and MALS-2 are tightly controlled at the transcriptional level by Ca2+ entry through L-type Ca2+ channels when cells are chronically depolarized. To strengthen this result, we have also shown that the physiological stimulus, i.e. activation of glutamate receptors, is capable of controlling MALS protein levels to the same extent. Calcineurin is the downstream effector of this effect because FK506 and cyclosporin A abolish Ca2+ influx-induced expression of MALS isoforms. Furthermore, the transcriptional activation of MALS-1 is rapid and does not require de novo protein synthesis, thereby suggesting that accumulation of this protein might precede other compositional changes at the PSD. Granule cells were dissociated from the cerebella of 7-day-old Wistar rats as described previously (3Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balazs R. Jorgensen O.S. J.

The following oligonucleotides were used as primers for PCR: MALS-1 forward, 5′-gcaatccgagaggtgtatc-3′, and reverse, 5′-tccttagcagccttgagaag-3′; MALS-2 forward, 5′-gtgtcccgggctgtgg-3′, and reverse, 5′-atctcctccagcacccg-3′; and actin forward, 5′-aagagaggcatcctgaccctgaagt-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTTCATGAGGTAGTCTGTCAGGTCC-3′. The conditions for the PCR reactions were as suggested from Promega for the Taq polymerase. PCR products were separated on 1.8% agarose gels. All of the reactions resulted in a single band with the exception of the MALS-1 experiments where RNA was extracted from tissues and where two bands corresponding to two splicing variants were amplified. The identity of the PCR-generated fragments was verified by DNA sequencing. Conditions used for semi-quantitative RT-PCR were: 93 °C (30 s) denaturation, 52 °C (30 s) annealing, 72 °C (45 s) extension during 25 cycles for MALS-1, and 93 °C (30 s) denaturation, 60 °C (30 s) annealing, and 72 °C (45 s) extension during 22 cycles for actin. Under these conditions, both reactions resulted in the linear phase of amplification, whereas the efficiency between MALS and actin was comparable and did not reach the plateau. For all experiments, 1 μg of cDNA was used as template, and reaction products were analyzed by 1.8% agarose gels. The bands were visualized with ethidium bromide, scanned, and then analyzed with NIH Image 1.62. Both pairwise and non-pairwise analyses using Student'st test were applied, and significance was set top < 0.001. Granule cells were resuspended at 5–10 × 106 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 75 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and subjected to five cycles of freeze and thaw. The particulate fraction was sedimented at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting protein pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, 10% sucrose and frozen at −70 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Proteins were separated on either 12% or linear 8–14% gradient acrylamide gels by using SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated with a polyclonal antibody that recognizes all three MALS isoforms (27Irie M. Hata Y. Deguchi M. Ide N. Hirao K. Yao I. Nishioka H. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2811-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), kindly donated by Professor Yutaka Hata (Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan), with a monoclonal antibody against PSD-95 (Affinity Bioreagents, Cambridge Biosciences) or a monoclonal antibody against actin (Sigma). Supernatant and membrane proteins displayed similar expression behaviors. MALS-1 appears to be the most expressed isoform of the MALS family of genes in the adult cerebellum (22Misawa H. Kawasaki Y. Mellor J. Sweeney N. Jo K. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9264-9272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and we set out to investigate whether in cerebellar granule cells its mRNA levels might have been modulated by chronic depolarization. Cells grown under depolarizing conditions for 3 days (25 or 40 mm) appeared to express significantly higher MALS-1 mRNA levels compared with cells grown in the presence of 5.3 or 10 mm KCl (Fig.1 A). Although the PCR primers were designed to be specific for the MALS-1 isoform, the similarity between MALS genes generated the possibility that MALS-2 might have been amplified as well by this set of primers. To rule out this hypothesis, the amplified PCR product was digested withXhoI, which should selectively cut the MALS-2 product. This procedure did not result in any apparent digestion fragments, confirming the sole presence of MALS-1. Furthermore, the PCR product was sequenced and shown to be MALS-1. The use of a primer located on the 3′-untranslated region revealed that the MALS-1 splice variant present in cerebellar granule cells corresponds to Lin-7Bb (data not shown) (27Irie M. Hata Y. Deguchi M. Ide N. Hirao K. Yao I. Nishioka H. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2811-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We then examined whether the presence of extracellular calcium was important to influence the up-regulation of MALS-1 gene and whether the effect could be observed after shorter treatments. This is important because in cerebellar granule cells depolarization via Ca2+ influx mediates the survival of cells, and although substantial cell death occurs only after 3 days in vitro(data not shown) (3Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balazs R. Jorgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Franklin J.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 501-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), 2D. Kramer and A. A. Genazzani, unpublished results.these results could still be indicative of this situation. Indeed, 6 h after the addition of 25 mm KCl where no cell death was observed, the up-regulation was detectable and the addition of EGTA to the extracellular medium prevented this change, although no differences were observed for actin (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, it would appear that cell survival does not play a role in this observation. To further characterize the possible mechanism by which Ca2+ controls MALS-1 up-regulation, cerebellar granule cells were cultured for 6 h in the presence of 25 mmKCl and in the presence of either L-type Ca2+ channel blockers or NMDA receptor antagonists. Nifedipine (1 μm) and diltiazem (1 μm) (data not shown) blocked the up-regulation induced by depolarization, whereas MK801 was unable to substantially affect MALS-1 mRNA (Fig.2 A). We next investigated whether MALS-1 mRNA could be regulated by calcineurin. Both FK506 and cyclosporin A, structurally different inhibitors of calcineurin (28Ho S. Clipstone N. Timmermann L. Northrop J. Graef I. Fiorentino D. Nourse J. Crabtree G.R. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1996; 80: S40-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), were able to selectively down-regulate the expression of MALS-1 (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that Ca2+ influx activates this phosphatase, which in turn is able to trigger the transcriptional machinery required for MALS-1. It has recently been reported that the immediate early gene Homer 1a, which also cooperates in shaping the post-synaptic density (29Xiao B. Tu J.C. Worley P.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), is up-regulated by an NMDA- and Ca2+-dependent mechanism in these cultures (30Sato M. Suzuki K. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3797-3805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This effect appeared to be independent of L-type Ca2+-channels but appears to be mediated by the activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (30Sato M. Suzuki K. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3797-3805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether this pathway could be responsible for MALS-1 up-regulation as well, we treated cells with the specific MEK inhibitor PD98059 (30 μm), which is able to revert the Homer1a up-regulation (30Sato M. Suzuki K. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3797-3805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, this drug was unable to influence MALS-1 expression induced by depolarization. This would suggest that neurons are capable of decoding differently the Ca2+ stimuli and can thereby alter the post-synaptic density accordingly. To support this finding, we attempted to induce Homer 1a expression either by depolarization or glutamate receptor stimulation, but no signal was detected. This might suggest that the pathway involved in Homer 1a regulation is developmentally regulated and is not present in the early stages of the culture. As a further control to strengthen the reliability of our model, we performed a RT-PCR with specific primers for NCX2, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger isoform that is selectively controlled by calcineurin (18Li L. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20903-20910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As expected, cells grown in 25 mm KCl expressed lower levels of this isoform (Fig.2 B). Surprisingly, our data suggest that the MAPK-signaling cascade might be involved in this down-regulation. It has been previously shown that the NCX2 down-regulation occurs in a fast manner with significant changes observable after 1 h (18Li L. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20903-20910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When a time course of MALS-1 up-regulation was performed, no changes at the mRNA level were observed after 1 h, suggesting that MALS-1 is not an immediate early gene (Fig. 2 C), whereas substantial up-regulation was observed after 6 h. To determine a relative level of change of MALS-1 expression according to the different treatments, we performed a densitometric analysis of the bands corresponding to MALS-1 expression in cells treated for 6 h. As a control, values were normalized over the correspondent actin product where the number of cycles for both genes corresponded to the linear phase of amplification. Although the actin density was approximately constant among treatments, the MALS-1/actin ratio increased under depolarizing conditions in all four independent cultures tested with a mean 2.8 ± 0.4-fold increase. The effect of depolarization was completely reversed by treatment with nifedipine, FK506, or cyclosporin A (all at 1 μm). Furthermore, these treatments decreased the relative MALS-1 expression compared with non-depolarized control cells. This finding supports earlier data showing that Ca2+- and calcineurin-dependent gene expression is active to a small degree also in basal culture conditions and can be blocked by L-type Ca2+ channel blockers and calcineurin inhibitors (17Guerini D. Wang X. Li L. Genazzani A. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3706-3712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Li L. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20903-20910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To establish whether the changes observed with RT-PCR corresponded to changes at the protein level and therefore could be physiologically relevant, we performed Western blotting with a polyclonal rabbit antibody that has been shown to recognize all three MALS isoforms (27Irie M. Hata Y. Deguchi M. Ide N. Hirao K. Yao I. Nishioka H. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2811-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As expected, only two bands were observed, the lowest corresponding to MALS-2 and MALS-3, which are known to have a smaller molecular weight, and the top band corresponding to MALS-1 (21Jo K. Derin R. Li M. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4189-4199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Irie M. Hata Y. Deguchi M. Ide N. Hirao K. Yao I. Nishioka H. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2811-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As predicted, MALS-1 underwent a developmental up-regulation, and its expression was highest in extracts from cells grown in K25. Protein expression was virtually abolished in cells grown in non-depolarizing KCl or in depolarized cells grown in the presence of 1 μm FK506 (Fig.3 A). Because we have previously shown that growing cells in the presence of FK506 does not affect neuronal survival (14Genazzani A.A. Carafoli E. Guerini D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5797-5801Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), this observation cannot be explained by a selective neuronal loss. Furthermore, it has been shown that the cells surviving in 5 mm KCl are morphologically indistinguishable from cells grown under depolarizing conditions (16Guerini D. Garcia-Martin E. Gerber A. Volbracht C. Leist M. Merino C.G. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1667-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The changes are protein-specific, because it has been previously shown that control proteins such as the ryanodine receptor or isoforms of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase pumps or of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, which are not transcriptionally regulated by calcineurin, show identical protein bands independently of treatments (16Guerini D. Garcia-Martin E. Gerber A. Volbracht C. Leist M. Merino C.G. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1667-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Guerini D. Wang X. Li L. Genazzani A. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3706-3712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, no changes in expression were observed when Western blots were probed with antibodies against the post-synaptic protein PSD-95 or with actin (Fig.3 A), suggesting that MALS-1 changes are specific and are not attributed to a broad rearrangement of the synapse regardless of treatments. Surprisingly, the band corresponding to the other two isoforms appeared to be regulated in similar fashion by Ca2+ and calcineurin, although the expression of these isoforms appeared to be highest after 3 days in culture and appeared to decline thereafter. Although the antibody might not necessarily recognize the three proteins to the same extent, it is apparent that relative MALS-1 expression is increased during development compared with the other two isoforms. The relative change in the proportion of MALS-1 present is in accord with previous protein analysis in whole brain homogenates during development (21Jo K. Derin R. Li M. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4189-4199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further confirm this finding, RT-PCR analysis of RNA extracted from cerebellum or cortex during different stages of development was performed. As expected, MALS-1 signal was increased significantly through development with the lowest signal observed in 1-day-old rats and the highest signal observed in adults (Fig. 3 B). This trend is highly suggestive of an increased expression with increased neuronal activity and parallels the data in the cell culture. Because the main input to cerebellar granule cells is represented by glutamatergic mossy fibers, it could be envisaged that the physiological synaptic stimulus in vivo would be represented by glutamate. To investigate this in our model, we treated cells for 6 h in the presence of glutamate (100 μm), NMDA (30 μm), or AMPA (100 μm) in Mg2+-free Locke's solution. These agonists were all capable of significantly up-regulating MALS-1 gene expression, and their effect could be blocked by FK506 (Fig.4 A). As expected, 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (30 μm) could revert the effect induced by AMPA. Although it is possible that a small amount of Ca2+ will flow through the AMPA receptor channel itself, it is probable that most of the Ca2+ influx induced by AMPA will be mediated by voltage-operated Ca2+-channels as suggested previously (31Murphy S.N. Miller R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8737-8741Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 32Copani A. Genazzani A.A. Aleppo G. Casabona G. Canonico P.L. Scapagnini U. Nicoletti F. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1199-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). NMDA receptor activation resulted in a similar time course compared with depolarization (Fig.4 B), suggesting that these two protocols of stimulation work through a similar mechanism. To further confirm the role of calcineurin, proteins were extracted from cells grown in the presence of either FK506 or cyclosporin A for 2 days (Fig. 5 A). Both drugs induced a significant reduction of the intensity of the bands corresponding to the MALS isoforms, paralleling observations obtained by RT-PCR. Furthermore, the blockade of l-type Ca2+ channels also abolished MALS expression. Because it appears that both the band specific for MALS-1 and the band representing MALS-2 and MALS-3 are sensitive to calcineurin inhibitors, we performed an RT-PCR experiment with primers specific for the MALS-2 isoform. Surprisingly, this isoform encoded by a different gene on a different chromosome appears to be controlled by calcineurin at the RNA level as well (Fig. 5 B). Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that other factors might be involved in the control of these two proteins because MALS-1 appears to increase during development, whereas MALS-2 undergoes a decrease (Fig. 3 A). Calcineurin could either participate in the control of MALS-1 transcription or could affect the stability of MALS mRNA. Although most effects attributable to calcineurin occur at the transcriptional level, mRNA stability has been shown to be affected in particular cell types (33Luo Z.D. Wang Y. Werlen G. Camp S. Chien K.R. Taylor P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 886-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To test which of these two modes of action accounts for the change in MALS-1 expression, we induced the expression of mRNA for 6 h in the presence or absence of 25 mm KCl and, thereafter, we added calcineurin inhibitors and the RNA polymerase inhibitor actinomycin D to monitor the decay in RNA. When normalized for cDNA amounts, MALS-1 signal decreased with time over a 6-h period. The decay of MALS-1 signal was not significantly different between control cultures and cultures grown in the presence of FK506 or cyclosporin A, thereby making it unlikely that mRNA stability is the major root of modulation (Fig.6 A). As a control, changes in actin mRNA were also investigated and a similar trend was observed with a decrease regardless of treatment (data not shown). Calcineurin could either directly influence one or more of the transcription factors responsible for MALS-1 up-regulation. It might influence its transcription indirectly by positively or negatively modulating the expression of a transcription factor not present under basal conditions, or it might influence the activity of a transcription factor not present under basal conditions but whose expression is dependent on Ca2+ influx. To determine which of these possibilities is most probable, we performed experiments in the presence of cycloheximide, thereby blocking protein synthesis. In the presence of cycloheximide and 25 mm KCl, the amount of mRNA encoding for MALS-1 increased significantly (Fig.6 B). Therefore, it would appear that the machinery responsible for activation of MALS-1 transcription is within neurons under basal conditions, and the effect by calcineurin is probably a dephosphorylation of a transcription factor such as NFAT or the control of MEF2 activity (8Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar, 34Mao Z. Wiedmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31102-31107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Furthermore, preliminary evidence from our laboratory indicates that these transcription factors are present either at the protein level 3L. Fresu and A. A. Genazzani, unpublished results.or at the RNA level, 4T. Ellis, T. Lori, and A. A. Genazzani, unpublished results.respectively. Nonetheless, at present it cannot be excluded that the ubiquitous transcription factor CREB might be involved in the control of MALS proteins. It is known that calcineurin can modulate the activity of the inhibitory peptide for protein phosphatase 1, and therefore, it could indirectly regulate the phosphorylation state of CREB (12Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Interestingly, initial bioinformatics investigation of theMALS-1 gene in the human genome revealed that NFAT, MEF2, and CREB binding sites exist in the putative promoter regions of bothMALS-1 and MALS-2 genes.Figure 6MALS-1 expression is not secondary to mRNA stability changes and does not require protein synthesis. A, cells grown for 6 h in the presence or absence of 25 mm KCl were subsequently treated with actinomycin D (ActD) in the presence or absence of FK506 or cyclosporin A for the indicated time points. B, cells were incubated for 6 h in complete medium supplemented with 25 mm KCl in the presence or absence of FK506, cyclosporin A, or the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) (5 μg/ml).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In conclusion, we have shown that MALS-1 and MALS-2 are regulated at the transcriptional level by Ca2+ influx feeding onto the activation of the Ca2+/CaM phosphatase calcineurin. The activation of both voltage-operated Ca2+ channels or more physiologically of glutamate receptors is sufficient to elicit an up-regulation. Nonetheless, MALS-1 expression appears to be more long lasting compared with MALS-2. An explanation for this could be that other transcription factors mediate the developmental profile of the expression of MALS isoforms and that calcineurin plays a permissive role. Although the full potential of MALS proteins is at present unknown, it has been shown to play a role in vesicle exocytosis (24Butz S. Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), protein trafficking (23Setou M. Nakagawa T. Seog D.H. Hirokawa N. Science. 2000; 288: 1796-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), and PSD assembly (21Jo K. Derin R. Li M. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4189-4199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it perhaps comes as no surprise that in the cerebellum its expression is mediated by synaptic activity. In other words, cerebellar neurons will react to the formation of new synapses by increasing MALS-1 expression and consequently increasing the capacity of the neuron to deal with new inputs. It is well documented that calcineurin activation requires protracted low elevations of calcium, which in vitro can be delivered by mild depolarization (19Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar) or glutamate receptor activation; therefore, it can be hypothesized that in vivo the inputs will generate such stimuli to increase MALS expression. Recently, it has been shown that Homer 1a, a natural dominant negative of the PSD, can be up-regulated as well in these cells, albeit only by NMDA activation (30Sato M. Suzuki K. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3797-3805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it would appear that Ca2+influx in the post-synaptic terminal is capable of shaping the future architecture of the post-synaptic density by altering transcription."
