https://openalex.org/W2509465044,"The long non-coding RNA X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) mediates the transcriptional silencing of genes on the X chromosome. Here we show that, in human cells, XIST is highly methylated with at least 78 N6-methyladenosine (m6A) residues—a reversible base modification of unknown function in long non-coding RNAs. We show that m6A formation in XIST, as well as in cellular mRNAs, is mediated by RNA-binding motif protein 15 (RBM15) and its paralogue RBM15B, which bind the m6A-methylation complex and recruit it to specific sites in RNA. This results in the methylation of adenosine nucleotides in adjacent m6A consensus motifs. Furthermore, we show that knockdown of RBM15 and RBM15B, or knockdown of methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3), an m6A methyltransferase, impairs XIST-mediated gene silencing. A systematic comparison of m6A-binding proteins shows that YTH domain containing 1 (YTHDC1) preferentially recognizes m6A residues on XIST and is required for XIST function. Additionally, artificial tethering of YTHDC1 to XIST rescues XIST-mediated silencing upon loss of m6A. These data reveal a pathway of m6A formation and recognition required for XIST-mediated transcriptional repression. The methylation of adenosine residues on the long non-coding RNA XIST is essential for X-chromosome transcriptional repression during female mammalian development. The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) known as XIST is required for the translational silencing of genes on one of the two X chromosomes during female mammalian development. Here, Samie Jaffrey and colleagues show that XIST is highly methylated, containing at least 78 N6-methyladenosine (m6A) residues throughout the length of the RNA. The XIST-binding protein RBM15 is shown to recruit the WTAP–METTL3 RNA m6A methyltransferase complex to XIST, and the nuclear m6A reader YTHDC1 is shown to activate gene-silencing mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2508644210,"The retention of episodic-like memory is enhanced, in humans and animals, when something novel happens shortly before or after encoding. Using an everyday memory task in mice, we sought the neurons mediating this dopamine-dependent novelty effect, previously thought to originate exclusively from the tyrosine-hydroxylase-expressing (TH+) neurons in the ventral tegmental area. Here we report that neuronal firing in the locus coeruleus is especially sensitive to environmental novelty, locus coeruleus TH+ neurons project more profusely than ventral tegmental area TH+ neurons to the hippocampus, optogenetic activation of locus coeruleus TH+ neurons mimics the novelty effect, and this novelty-associated memory enhancement is unaffected by ventral tegmental area inactivation. Surprisingly, two effects of locus coeruleus TH+ photoactivation are sensitive to hippocampal D1/D5 receptor blockade and resistant to adrenoceptor blockade: memory enhancement and long-lasting potentiation of synaptic transmission in CA1 ex vivo. Thus, locus coeruleus TH+ neurons can mediate post-encoding memory enhancement in a manner consistent with possible co-release of dopamine in the hippocampus. Projections from the locus coeruleus, an area typically defined by noradrenergic signalling, to the hippocampus drive novelty-based memory enhancement through possible co-release of dopamine. Memory retention can be enhanced when something novel or categorically relevant occurs shortly before or after the time of memory encoding, as in 'flashbulb memory'. Dopamine-based mechanisms originating in the ventral tegmental area have been implicated in the phenomenon. These authors suggest that projections from the locus coeruleus—typically defined by noradrenergic signalling—to the hippocampus drive this novelty-based memory enhancement through the possible local release of dopamine."
https://openalex.org/W2464525267,"Nanometre-scale graphitic capillaries with atomically flat walls are engineered and studied, revealing unexpectedly fast transport of liquid water through channels that accommodate only a few layers of water. Artificial nanometre-sized capillaries have enabled new research and led to the emergence of nanofluidics, but surface roughness in particular makes it very challenging to exactly control their dimensions. Andre Geim and colleagues now show that van der Waals assembly can produce narrow and smooth capillaries that have atomically flat top and bottom graphite sheets, separated by spacers made from a precisely controlled number of graphene layers. Water transport through the channels, which range in height from a single atomic plane to dozens of them, is unexpectedly fast and speeds up further in channels that accommodate only a few layers of water. The fabrication method is expected to give access to a wide range of capillaries with atomically precise sizes, and with permeation properties that are tunable by the choice of two-dimensional material used for creating the channel walls. Nanometre-scale pores and capillaries have long been studied because of their importance in many natural phenomena and their use in numerous applications1. A more recent development is the ability to fabricate artificial capillaries with nanometre dimensions, which has enabled new research on molecular transport and led to the emergence of nanofluidics2,3,4. But surface roughness in particular makes it challenging to produce capillaries with precisely controlled dimensions at this spatial scale. Here we report the fabrication of narrow and smooth capillaries through van der Waals assembly5, with atomically flat sheets at the top and bottom separated by spacers made of two-dimensional crystals6 with a precisely controlled number of layers. We use graphene and its multilayers as archetypal two-dimensional materials to demonstrate this technology, which produces structures that can be viewed as if individual atomic planes had been removed from a bulk crystal to leave behind flat voids of a height chosen with atomic-scale precision. Water transport through the channels, ranging in height from one to several dozen atomic planes, is characterized by unexpectedly fast flow (up to 1 metre per second) that we attribute to high capillary pressures (about 1,000 bar) and large slip lengths. For channels that accommodate only a few layers of water, the flow exhibits a marked enhancement that we associate with an increased structural order in nanoconfined water. Our work opens up an avenue to making capillaries and cavities with sizes tunable to ångström precision, and with permeation properties further controlled through a wide choice of atomically flat materials available for channel walls."

https://openalex.org/W2511373877,"Synaptic dysfunction occurs early in senile dementias, presumably as a result of decreased levels of functional synaptic proteins as found in autopsied brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Plasma neuronal-derived exosomes (NDEs) were recovered by precipitation and immunoabsorption from 12 patients with AD, 16 with FTD, and 28 controls in a cross-sectional study, and from 9 patients with AD, 10 with FTD, and 19 controls in a longitudinal study. Six synaptic proteins in NDE extracts were quantified by ELISAs and normalized for exosome amounts. NDE levels of synaptophysin, synaptopodin, synaptotagmin-2, and neurogranin were significantly lower in patients with FTD and AD than in controls, but those of growth-associated protein 43 and synapsin 1 were reduced only in patients with AD. Functionally relevant phosphorylation of synapsin 1 serine 9 was reduced in patients with FTD and AD, although total synapsin 1 protein was higher in FTD than in controls. NDE levels of synaptotagmin, synaptophysin, and neurogranin were decreased years before dementia in patients with FTD and AD. NDE levels of synaptopodin, synaptotagmin, and synaptophysin, but not of amyloid β-peptide 42 or P-T181-tau, were correlated significantly with cognition assessed by mini-mental state examination or AD assessment scale-cognitive subscale.

https://openalex.org/W2508602832,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) comprises a range of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication as well as by restricted and repetitive behaviours. ASD has a strong genetic component with high heritability. Exome sequencing analysis has recently identified many de novo mutations in a variety of genes in individuals with ASD, with CHD8, a gene encoding a chromatin remodeller, being most frequently affected. Whether CHD8 mutations are causative for ASD and how they might establish ASD traits have remained unknown. Here we show that mice heterozygous for Chd8 mutations manifest ASD-like behavioural characteristics including increased anxiety, repetitive behaviour, and altered social behaviour. CHD8 haploinsufficiency did not result in prominent changes in the expression of a few specific genes but instead gave rise to small but global changes in gene expression in the mouse brain, reminiscent of those in the brains of patients with ASD. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that neurodevelopment was delayed in the mutant mouse embryos. Furthermore, reduced expression of CHD8 was associated with abnormal activation of RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST), which suppresses the transcription of many neuronal genes. REST activation was also observed in the brains of humans with ASD, and CHD8 was found to interact physically with REST in the mouse brain. Our results are thus consistent with the notion that CHD8 haploinsufficiency is a highly penetrant risk factor for ASD, with disease pathogenesis probably resulting from a delay in neurodevelopment."
https://openalex.org/W2509062642,"Stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic condensates of stalled messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs) that form when eukaryotic cells encounter environmental stress. RNA-binding proteins are enriched for arginine methylation and facilitate SG assembly through interactions involving regions of low amino acid complexity. How methylation of specific RNA-binding proteins regulates RNA granule assembly has not been characterized. Here, we examined the potent SG-nucleating protein Ras-GAP SH3-binding protein 1 (G3BP1), and found that G3BP1 is differentially methylated on specific arginine residues by protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) 1 and PRMT5 in its RGG domain. Several genetic and biochemical interventions that increased methylation repressed SG assembly, whereas interventions that decreased methylation promoted SG assembly. Arsenite stress quickly and reversibly decreased asymmetric arginine methylation on G3BP1. These data indicate that arginine methylation in the RGG domain prevents large SG assembly and rapid demethylation is a novel signal that regulates SG formation."

Here, we identify Ewing tumor-associated antigen 1 (ETAA1), which has been linked to susceptibility to pancreatic cancer, as a new repair protein that is recruited to stalled forks by RPA. We demonstrate that ETAA1 interacts with RPA through two regions, each of which resembles two previously identified RPA-binding domains, RPA70N-binding motif and RPA32C-binding motif, respectively. In response to replication stress, ETAA1 is recruited to stalled forks where it colocalizes with RPA, and this recruitment is diminished when RPA is depleted. Notably, inactivation of the ETAA1 gene increases the collapse level of the stalled replication forks and decreases the recovery efficiency of these forks. Moreover, epistasis analysis shows that ETAA1 stabilizes stalled replication forks in an ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR)-independent manner.

Thus, our results reveal that ETAA1 is a novel RPA-interacting protein that promotes restart of stalled replication forks. The faithful replication of DNA is essential for the maintenance of genomic stability and the prevention of cancer-promoting mutations. Replication forks can be stalled by numerous obstacles on the DNA template, including unrepaired DNA damage, DNA-bound proteins, and secondary structures (1.Petermann E. Helleday T. Pathways of mammalian replication fork restart.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Stalled replication forks are able to restart once the obstacles are removed or become broken (collapse) into DNA double strand breaks, which pose the most serious threat to genome integrity when fork protection fails (2.Tercero J.A.

When replication forks stalled, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is generated and extended by minichromosome maintenance protein complex helicases (7.Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M.

The RPA-ssDNA complex recruits and activates ATR/ATRIP thereby eliciting checkpoint signaling (9.Zou L. Elledge S.J.

Here, we identified a new RPA interaction protein, ETAA1, whose gene variation has been associated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer (20.Childs E.J. Mocci E. Campa D. Bracci P.M. Gallinger S. Goggins M. Li D. Neale R.E. Olson S.H. Scelo G. Amundadottir L.T. Bamlet W.R. Bijlsma M.F. Blackford A. Borges M. et al.Common variation at 2p13.3, 3q29, 7p13, and 17q25.1 associated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer.Nat. Genet. 2015; 47: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). ETAA1 is recruited to stalled replication forks in response to replication stress, and the disruption of ETAA1 leads to fork collapse in an ATR-independent manner. These results suggest that ETAA1 is a new player involved in the stabilization of stalled replication forks. We transiently expressed FLAG-tagged RPA1 in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated the complexes with an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1A). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that, in addition to RPA2, RPA3, and the BLM complex, a novel protein, ETAA1, also immunoprecipitated with RPA1 (Fig. 1A). Immunoblotting confirmed this finding (Fig. 1B). To verify that ETAA1 indeed associates with the RPA complex, we performed a reciprocal immunoprecipitation using HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged ETAA1; immunoblotting revealed that RPA was present in the ETAA1-associated complexes (Fig. 1C). To further confirm this interaction, we also performed immunoprecipitations with anti-RPA2 and anti-ETAA1 antibodies, and we found that endogenous ETAA1 strongly associated with the RPA complex in vivo (Fig. 1, D and E). Together, these data suggest that ETAA1 is a bona fide RPA-associated protein. To examine the interaction during the cell cycle, cells were synchronized at the G1-S boundary by a double thymidine treatment or at metaphase by a nocodazole treatment and then released. ETAA1 showed the strongest interaction with RPA at S phase and the lowest at G2/M phase (Fig. 1, F and G), suggesting that ETAA1 may function with RPA in DNA replication. Additionally, the binding of RPA2 to ETAA1 was not changed after cells were exposed to HU (Fig. 1D). ETAA1 is expressed only in vertebrates. Sequence analyses showed that ETAA1 contains three conserved regions (Fig. 1H) as follows. The N-terminal conserved region contains no well known domains; the middle conserved region, RBM1, shows weak similarity to the RPA70N-binding motifs of ATRIP, MRE11, RAD9, and P53 (Fig. 1I) (21.Xu X. Vaithiyalingam S. Glick G.G. Mordes D.A. Chazin W.J. Cortez D. The basic cleft of RPA70N binds multiple checkpoint proteins, including RAD9, to regulate ATR signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 7345-7353Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar); and the C-terminal conserved region, RBM2, is similar to the RPA32C-terminal binding motifs of SMARCAL1, TIPIN, XPA, and UNG2 (Fig. 1J) (22.Feldkamp M.D. Mason A.C. Eichman B.F. Chazin W.J. Structural analysis of replication protein A recruitment of the DNA damage response protein SMARCAL1.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 3052-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23.Xie S. Lu Y. Jakoncic J. Sun H. Xia J. Qian C. Structure of RPA32 bound to the N terminus of SMARCAL1 redefines the binding interface between RPA32 and its interacting proteins.FEBS J. 2014; 281: 3382-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To identify the region(s) of ETAA1 responsible for its interaction with RPA, we generated a series of ETAA1 truncation mutants (Fig. 1H). As shown in Fig. 1, H and K, the N-terminal region (residues 1–438, containing the first conserved region) of ETAA1 is dispensable for its interaction with RPA. The mutant lacking the RBM1 motif (ΔRBM1) or the RBM2 motif (ΔRBM2) dramatically decreased the ETAA1-RPA interaction, thus indicating that both RBM1 and RBM2 regions of ETAA1 are important for binding to RPA. Moreover, deletion of both RBM1 and RBM2 motifs (ΔRBM12) completely lost its interaction with RPA. These results are consistent with the sequence analyses that ETAA1 contains two RPA-binding motifs, RBM1 and RBM2. To determine whether the interaction between RPA and ETAA1 is direct, we expressed and purified recombinant MBP-tagged RPA1, RPA2, RPA3, and GST-tagged ETAA1 from Escherichia coli. Pulldown experiments revealed that ETAA1 binds strongly with RPA1 and RPA2 but not with RPA3 (Fig. 1L), indicating that two independent ETAA1-binding sites exist on RPA1 and RPA2. Moreover, mapping analysis revealed that the RPA1 N-terminal region (residues 1–120) and RPA2 C-terminal region (residues 204–270) directly interacted with ETAA1 (Fig. 1L), thus agreeing that RBM1 and RBM2 of ETAA1 are RPA70N-terminal and RPA32C-terminal binding motifs, respectively. The RPA complex binds to ssDNA generated at stalled replication forks or DNA damage sites and forms an RPA-ssDNA platform, which facilitates the recruitment of many repair proteins. The interaction of ETAA1 and RPA suggests that ETAA1 may colocalize with RPA at ssDNA regions in vivo. As shown in Fig. 2A, FLAG-ETAA1 rarely formed foci in untreated cells. After HU treatment, ETAA1 was recruited to nuclear foci, where it colocalized with RPA, thus suggesting that ETAA1 localizes to stalled replication forks and may play a role in cellular responses to replication stress. We then determined whether the localization of ETAA1 at stalled replication forks was dependent on the RPA complex. As shown in Fig. 2B, ETAA1 exhibited dramatically decreased foci formation in RPA2-depleted cells but not in control cells after HU treatment, thereby indicating that ETAA1 is mainly recruited to stalled replication forks by the RPA complex. We then examined the dynamic recruitment of GFP-ETAA1 at microirradiation-induced DNA damage sites in time-lapse experiments. GFP-ETAA1 accumulated at laser tracks very quickly, within 1 s, and the signal peaked at ∼2 min and then persisted for more than 1 h (Fig. 2C and data not shown). To determine whether this recruitment was also dependent on RPA, we tested ETAA1 mutants lacking the RBM1 or RBM2 motif. Deletion of RBM1 or RBM2 did not affect ETAA1 recruitment at the early stage (<1 s) but significantly reduced its recruitment to and (or) retention on DNA damage sites at the late stage (Fig. 2C). The deletion of both RBM1 and RBM2 completely abolished the localization of ETAA1 to DNA damage sites (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the localization of ETAA1 at DNA damage sites is dependent on its interaction with RPA through the RBM1 and RBM2 motifs. The RPA complex plays a key role in replication and in stalled replication restart. Thus, we generated ETAA1-knock-out HCT116 cells using two different CRISPR target sites (Fig. 3A) and performed single DNA fiber analysis. Cells were pulse-labeled with CldU for 30 min and then incubated with HU (5 mm) and aphidicolin (5 μm) for 5 h to arrest replication forks. After a washout step, cells were incubated with IdU for 20 min. Restarted replication forks were visualized as tracks of CldU incorporation followed by tracks of IdU incorporation, whereas stalled or collapsed replication forks appeared as tracks of only CldU incorporation. We found that two ETAA1−/− clones both exhibited significantly decreased fork restart, as indicated by an approximate 2-fold reduction (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that ETAA1 promotes stalled fork restart upon replication stress. We also examined replication rate under normal conditions by measuring IdU track length (Fig. 3C). The ETAA1−/− cells showed similar track length as that of wild-type cells, indicating that ETAA1 is not required for normal replication. Combined treatment with HU and an ATR inhibitor exhausts RPA and triggers fork breakage, and it is accompanied by hallmarks of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) activity such as H2AX hyperphosphorylation (24.Toledo L.I. Altmeyer M. Rask M.B. Lukas C. Larsen D.H. Povlsen L.K. Bekker-Jensen S. Mailand N. Bartek J. Lukas J. ATR prohibits replication catastrophe by preventing global exhaustion of RPA.Cell. 2013; 155: 1088-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). We examined fork stability during replication stress in ETAA1-defective cells by measuring H2AX hyperphosphorylation using a previously described quantitative image-based cytometry (QIBC) method (24.Toledo L.I. Altmeyer M. Rask M.B. Lukas C. Larsen D.H. Povlsen L.K. Bekker-Jensen S. Mailand N. Bartek J. Lukas J. ATR prohibits replication catastrophe by preventing global exhaustion of RPA.Cell. 2013; 155: 1088-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). HU treatment induced H2AX hyperphosphorylation in ETAA1−/− cells but not in wild-type cells, a result similar to that induced in wild-type cells after treatment with both HU and an ATR inhibitor (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that ETAA1 has a similar function to that of ATR in preventing stalled fork collapse. Indeed, the loss of ETAA1 also caused hypersensitivity to HU and CPT (Fig. 3E), a topoisomerase I inhibitor that induces topoisomerase I-DNA adducts and blocks replication, thus further supporting a role for ETAA1 in fork protection upon replication stress. Although the expression of the wild-type ETAA1 completely rescued stabilization of stalled replication fork and CPT resistance in the ETAA1−/− cells, reconstitution with ETAA1 mutants lacking RBM1, RBM2, or both failed to do so (Fig. 3, F–H). This result suggests that the interaction of ETAA1 with RPA is important for its function in response to replication stress. Moreover, the combination of the ATR inhibitor and HU treatment induced a higher γH2AX signal in ETAA1−/− cells than in wild-type cells, or in ETAA1−/− cells treated with HU alone (Fig. 3D), suggesting that ETAA1 has an ATR-independent role in protecting the stalled replication forks. The RPA complex is a key player in initiating DNA-damage checkpoint signaling, replication fork stabilization, and DNA repair. The binding of RPA to ssDNA not only protects ssDNA from degradation by nucleases but also forms a platform facilitating the recruitment of many binding partners for diverse functions. Here, we identified a novel RPA-binding protein, ETAA1, which is required for the stability of the stalled replication fork. ETAA1 contains two RPA-binding motifs, RBM1 and RBM2. RBM1 shows weak similarity to the RPA70N-binding motif of ATRIP, MRE11, RAD9, and p53, whereas RBM2 is similar to the RPA32C-binding motifs of SMARCAL1, TIPIN, XPA, and UNG2. The presence of either RBM1 or RBM2 is sufficient for ETAA1 to bind RPA at ssDNA regions, although the signal is weaker, thus allowing one RPA complex to bind other proteins together with ETAA1. This implies that ETAA1 can be orchestrated with other RPA-binding proteins on the RPA-ssDNA platform, which coordinates different DNA damage responses. RPA complexes protect stalled replication forks through at least three mechanisms, First, RPA directly binds and protects ssDNA generated at stalled replication forks from nucleolytic digestion. ETAA1 probably does not contribute to this step because ETAA1 did not affect the ssDNA binding activity of RPA, and ETAA1−/− cells even showed more ssDNA-bound RPA under replication stress than did wild-type cells (Fig. 3D). Second, RPA activates the ATR-dependent DNA replication checkpoint to stabilize stalled replication forks. However, our epistasis analysis using an ATR inhibitor in ETAA1-null cells showed that ETAA1 and ATR function in two parallel pathways that protect stalled replication forks. Third, RPA recruits repair proteins, which remodel and protect stalled replication forks. Whether ETAA1 facilitates remodeling of stalled replication forks, thereby promoting fork stabilization, remains to be determined. Moreover, GFP-ETAA1 was recruited to laser-induced DNA damage sites in both G1 and G2/S phase cells (data not shown), thus suggesting that ETAA1 functions not only in stalled replication fork restart but also in other DNA repair pathways. Repair of the double strand breaks, which are commonly induced by laser treatment, also recruits RPA after end resection, which normally takes more than a few seconds. ETAA1 was recruited quickly to DNA damage sites (within 1 s), a result suggesting that ETAA1 may be recruited by RPA-independent mechanisms in the early stage after laser-induced DNA damage. The RPA-dependent and (or) independent functions of ETAA1 in other DNA damage repair processes require further study. In summary, we identified ETAA1 as a novel RPA-binding protein, which protects stalled replication forks and maintains genomic stability. Our results provide insights into the function of ETAA1 in preventing pancreatic cancer. HeLa, U2OS, and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen). HCT116 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). HEK293 suspension cells were cultured in Freestyle medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% FBS (Gibco) and 1% glutamine in an incubator with shaking at 130 rpm. The immunoprecipitation of the complexes was performed as described previously (25.Xing M. Yang M. Huo W. Feng F. Wei L. Jiang W. Ning S. Yan Z. Li W. Wang Q. Hou M. Dong C. Guo R. Gao G. Ji J. Zha S. Lan L. Liang H. Xu D. Interactome analysis identifies a new paralogue of XRCC4 in non-homologous end joining DNA repair pathway.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). MBP-tagged RPA proteins were expressed in E. coli. Cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin). After sonicating, the extract was centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 40 min. The supernatant was collected and incubated with amylose resins for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT), the protein-bound beads were incubated with the extract of E. coli cells expressing GST-ETAA1 for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing with binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT), the proteins were eluted with sample buffer (63 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.0025% bromphenol blue) and analyzed with SDS-PAGE. U2OS cells expressing GFP-ETAA1 were cultured at 37 °C in CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS in a temperature-controlled container in glass-bottom dishes (MatTek). Laser microirradiation was carried out with the MicroPoint Laser Illumination and Ablation System coupled to a Nikon eclipse Ti microscope with a plan fluor 60 × 0.5–1.25 oil iris immersion objective. Time-lapse images were acquired with ANDOR IQ3 software through an ANDOR IXON camera. ETAA1-deficient HCT116 cells were generated using CRISPR. Briefly, two guide sequences, AGGAAACACCAAGATATCTG and GCTACAAAAAAGCCAATCAA, targeting two different sites of the human ETAA1 gene were inserted into the pX330 vector (26.Cong L. Ran F.A. Cox D. Lin S. Barretto R. Habib N. Hsu P.D. Wu X. Jiang W. Marraffini L.A. Zhang F. Multiplex genome engineering using CRISPR/Cas systems.Science. 2013; 339: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (9981) Google Scholar). The guide sequence containing pX330 plasmids were transfected into HCT116 cells. Single colonies were picked after 8–10 days of incubation. The genomic fragments of the ETAA1 gene were amplified by PCR using the following primers: GAGCTAGATGTGATTCAAGAGC and CTGTCCGCTACATTTCTGAG. The products were digested with EcoRV and BslI, respectively. Colonies containing the expected PCR fragments were then sequenced and examined by Western blotting. The restart efficiency of stalled replication forks was determined by using DNA fiber assays as described previously (27.Davies S.L. North P.S. Hickson I.D. Role for BLM in replication-fork restart and suppression of origin firing after replicative stress.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Cells were first labeled with CldU (100 μm) for 30 min and then treated with HU (5 mm) and aphidicolin (5 μm) for 5 h. After being washed with PBS, cells were recovered in fresh medium with IdU (20 μm) for 20 min. Cells were then trypsinized and resuspended in PBS to a concentration of 2.5 × 105 cells/ml. Then the cells were diluted 1:4 with unlabeled cells at the same concentration, and 2.5 μl of cells was mixed with 7.5 μl of lysis buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS) on a clean glass slide. After the edges were dried for 3–5 min, the slides were tilted at 15° to horizontal, allowing the DNA to slowly flow down along the slide. The slides were then air-dried, fixed in 3:1 methanol/acetic acid, and refrigerated overnight. The slides were treated with 2.5 m HCl for 1 h, neutralized in 0.1 m Na3B4O7, pH 8.5, and rinsed three times in PBST (PBS buffer with 0.1% Tween 20). The slides were then blocked in blocking buffer (PBST buffer containing 1% BSA) for 20 min and incubated with rat anti-BrdU antibody (Abcam BU1/75, 1:200) in blocking buffer at 37 °C for 1 h. After three washes, with PBST, slides were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rat (Molecular Probes, 1:200 dilution) for 45 min. After additional washes, the slides were incubated with mouse anti-BrdU (BD Biosciences, B44, 1:40) for 1 h and then washed once with high-salt PBST (0.5 m NaCl) and three times with PBST. Then the slides were incubated with Alexa Fluor 549-conjugated anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, 1:200 dilution) for 45 min. After three washes with PBST, the slides were mounted in SlowFade Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). The slides were imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope with a 100× objective. U2OS or HCT16 cells were cultured on polylysine-coated coverslips 24 h before the experiments. After washing with PBS, the cells were pre-extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 in CSK buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, and 3 mm MgCl2). The cells were then washed three times with PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Before staining, the cells were permeabilized for 10 min with PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, and washed three times. For EdU staining, the cells were incubated with Click-iT reaction buffer (PBS with 50 μm Alexa Fluor® 488 azide, 10 mm sodium ascorbate, and 2 mm CuSO4) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, the cells were blocked with 5% BSA (Sigma) in PBS for 15 min. The primary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA and incubated with the cells for 90 min. After washing, secondary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA were added to the cells for 30 min. The cells were washed three times and mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with an LSM710 confocal microscope (Zeiss) using a 100×/1.4 NA objector. For immunoblotting, primary antibodies were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature in PBST containing 5% powder milk. Secondary peroxidase-coupled antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were incubated at room temperature for 45 min. ECL-based chemiluminescence was detected by using film. Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: RPA2/RPA32 (Bethyl, A300-244A, WB, 1:2000; IF, 1:500), ETAA1 (Abcam, ab192402, WB, 1:1000), H2AX-pS139 (Millipore, 05-636, IF, 1:5000), FLAG (MBL, M185–3L, WB, 1:2500; IF, 1:250). QIBC was performed as described previously (24.Toledo L.I. Altmeyer M. Rask M.B. Lukas C. Larsen D.H. Povlsen L.K. Bekker-Jensen S. Mailand N. Bartek J. Lukas J. ATR prohibits replication catastrophe by preventing global exhaustion of RPA.Cell. 2013; 155: 1088-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Briefly, images were acquired in an unbiased fashion with an Image Xpress Micro XL microscope (Molecular Devices) with a 10×/0.3 NA objective and a scientific CMOS camera. For every sample, 30–50 images were acquired, containing a total of 5000 to 10,000 cells per condition. After acquisition, the images were processed for automated analysis with the MetaXpress High Content Image Acquisition and Analysis software. Cell survival curves for HCT116 cells treated with HU and CPT were generated as described previously (28.Katsube T. Mori M. Tsuji H. Shiomi T. Shiomi N. Onoda M. Differences in sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents between XRCC4- and Artemis-deficient human cells.J. Radiat. Res. 2011; 52: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). An appropriate number of cells were plated in 6-well plates and cultured for 24 h, and then the indicated dose of HU or CPT was added to the medium. After an additional 9–14 days of incubation, the colonies were stained with methylene blue and counted. S. F., Y. Z., Y. X., S. N., W. H., and M. H. conducted the experiments. G. G., J. J., R.

https://openalex.org/W2528605706,"Alternative splicing (AS) is a central mechanism of genetic regulation which modifies the sequence of RNA transcripts in higher eukaryotes. AS has been shown to increase both the variability and diversity of the cellular proteome by changing the composition of resulting proteins through differential choice of exons to be included in mature mRNAs. In the present study, alterations to the global RNA splicing landscape of cellular genes upon viral infection were investigated using mammalian reovirus as a model. Our study provides the first comprehensive portrait of global changes in the RNA splicing signatures that occur in eukaryotic cells following infection with a human virus. We identify 240 modified alternative splicing events upon infection which belong to transcripts frequently involved in the regulation of gene expression and RNA metabolism. Using mass spectrometry, we also confirm modifications to transcript-specific peptides resulting from AS in virus-infected cells. These findings provide additional insights into the complexity of virus-host interactions as these splice variants expand proteome diversity and function during viral infection."

Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) is a legume lectin that recognizes terminal N-acetylgalactosaminides with high affinity. WFA preferentially binds the disaccharide LacdiNAc (β-d-GalNAc-[1→4]-d-GlcNAc), which is associated with tumor malignancy in leukemia, prostate, pancreatic, ovarian, and liver cancers and has shown promise in cancer glycobiomarker detection. The mechanism of specificity for WFA recognition of LacdiNAc is not fully understood. To address this problem, we have determined affinities and structure of WFA in complex with GalNAc and LacdiNAc. Affinities toward Gal, GalNAc, and LacdiNAc were measured via surface plasmon resonance, yielding KD values of 4.67 × 10−4 m, 9.24 × 10−5 m, and 5.45 × 10−6 m, respectively. Structures of WFA in complex with LacdiNAc and GalNAc have been determined to 1.80–2.32 Å resolution. These high resolution structures revealed a hydrophobic groove complementary to the GalNAc and, to a minor extent, to the back-face of the GlcNAc sugar ring. Remarkably, the contribution of this small hydrophobic surface significantly increases the observed affinity for LacdiNAc over GalNAc. Tandem MS sequencing confirmed the presence of two isolectin forms in commercially available WFA differing only in the identities of two amino acids. Finally, the WFA carbohydrate binding site is similar to a homologous lectin isolated from Vatairea macrocarpa in complex with GalNAc, which, unlike WFA, binds not only αGalNAc but also terminal Ser/Thr O-linked αGalNAc (Tn antigen).

Lectins are non-catalytic proteins with strict specificity for individual mono- or oligosaccharides, which can make them powerful tools for detecting changes in the carbohydrate structure in glycoproteins and glycolipids. Several lectins are currently used in histochemical analyses to identify malignant or premalignant cells (3.Mody R. Joshi S. Chaney W. Use of lectins as diagnostic and therapeutic tools for cancer.J.

The tetrameric WFH does not have mitogen activity but displays strong hemagglutination and leukoagglutination activity, whereas the dimeric WFA show phytogenic and hemagglutination activity (38.Sato, T., Chiba, Y., Tateno, H., Kaji, H., Goto, M., and Narimatsu, H., (June 26, 2014) Modified lectin derived from Wisteria floribunda, In Google Patents, publication number WO2014098112 A1 Japan,Google Scholar). The dimeric lectin is referred to WFM for its mitogenic capability. It is currently unclear whether these lectins represent different isoforms or entirely different lectins. A better understanding of WFA and the molecular basis for LacdiNAc-lectin recognition is of significant biomedical and immunological interest.

The synthesis reaction mix included 5 mm GlcNAcβ-pNP (15 mg), 10 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 10 mm MnCl2, 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 39 units of HP-21, and 46 units of CPG-13. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C. The additions of 12 units of HP-21 and 14 units of CPG-13 were made after 4 h, and an addition of 3 mm UDP-GlcNAc was made after 6 h. Capillary electrophoresis analysis (P/ACE MDQ system equipped with diode array detection, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) showed that the reaction was 85% complete after 23 h. The reaction mix was applied to a solid phase extraction cartridge (SepPak C18). Unbound material was removed by washing with water and then 20% methanol. The mix of GlcNAcβ-pNP/LacdiNAcβ-pNP was eluted with 50% methanol. Incubation at 4 °C in 50% methanol resulted in the selective precipitation of the LacdiNAcβ-pNP. The LacdiNAcβ-pNP was recovered by centrifugation, washed with 100% methanol, and solubilized in water. The interactions of sugar ligands with immobilized WFA were measured by SPR using a Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare). Immobilizations were carried out on research grade CM5 sensorchips at a protein concentration of 50 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, using the manufacturer's amine coupling kit. The amount of immobilized WFA was 3928 resonance units (RU), and the reference surface was blocked with ethanolamine alone. The binding analyses were carried out at 25 °C in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mm MnCl2 at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The data were analyzed with the T200 evaluation software, version 3.0. Lyophilized WFA (Vector Laboratories) was diluted to 1 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm Ca2+, and 0.1 mm Mn2+ and further purified using size exclusion chromatography BioSep SEC-s3000 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with the same buffer. Samples were concentrated to 15 mg/ml in the presence of either 5 mm LacdiNAc or 10 mm GalNAc for crystallization trials. Sitting drops were set up in a 16 °C room with 96-well plates using a Gryphon Xtallization Robot (Art Robbins Instruments, San Jose, CA). Crystals of WFA in presence of LacdiNAc appeared in >10% all screens tested.

However, the co-expansion and co-administration of these immune cells have not been explored. In this study we describe an efficient method to expand simultaneously both CIK and Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, termed as CIKZ cells, from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using Zometa, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin 2 (IL-2), anti-CD3 antibody and engineered K562 feeder cells expressing CD64, CD137L and CD86. A 21-day culture of PBMCs with this method yielded nearly 20,000-fold expansion of CIKZ cells with γδ T cells making up over 20% of the expanded population. The expanded CIKZ cells exhibited antitumor cytotoxicity and could be modified to express anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), anti-CEA CAR, and anti-HER2 CAR to enhance their specificity and cytotoxicity against CD19-, CEA-, or HER2-positive tumor cells. The tumor inhibitory activity of anti-CD19 CAR-modified CIKZ cells was further demonstrated in vivo in a Raji tumor mouse model. The findings herein substantiate the feasibility of co-expanding CIK and γδ cells for adoptive cellular immunotherapy applications such as CAR T-cell therapy against cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2514817004,"Analysis of fossil limb bones suggests that a mass-death deposit of the Devonian tetrapod Acanthostega may consist entirely of juveniles, throwing new light on the life history of this species and the evolution of terrestriality. Many aspects of the life and habits of the Devonian stem tetrapod Acanthostega remain obscure. Although it had limbs with digits, everything we know about it suggests that it was obligately aquatic. Here Sophie Sanchez and colleagues show that most known Acanthostega specimens come from a single mass-death assemblage, and that their state of ossification suggests that although the largest animal was at least six years old, they were all juveniles—no adults are known. The research provides a poignant snapshot into the life one of the earliest known tetrapods, but raises many questions about the evolution of life history in land vertebrates. The transition from fish to tetrapod was arguably the most radical series of adaptive shifts in vertebrate evolutionary history. Data are accumulating rapidly for most aspects of these events1,2,3,4,5, but the life histories of the earliest tetrapods remain completely unknown, leaving a major gap in our understanding of these organisms as living animals. Symptomatic of this problem is the unspoken assumption that the largest known Devonian tetrapod fossils represent adult individuals. Here we present the first, to our knowledge, life history data for a Devonian tetrapod, from the Acanthostega mass-death deposit of Stensiö Bjerg, East Greenland6,7. Using propagation phase-contrast synchrotron microtomography (PPC-SRμCT)8 to visualize the histology of humeri (upper arm bones) and infer their growth histories, we show that even the largest individuals from this deposit are juveniles. A long early juvenile stage with unossified limb bones, during which individuals grew to almost final size, was followed by a slow-growing late juvenile stage with ossified limbs that lasted for at least six years in some individuals. The late onset of limb ossification suggests that the juveniles were exclusively aquatic, and the predominance of juveniles in the sample suggests segregated distributions of juveniles and adults at least at certain times. The absolute size at which limb ossification began differs greatly between individuals, suggesting the possibility of sexual dimorphism, adaptive strategies or competition-related size variation."
https://openalex.org/W2516796413,"Induction of brown-like adipocytes (beige/brite cells) in white adipose tissue (WAT) suggests a new approach for preventing and treating obesity via induction of thermogenesis associated with uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). However, whether diet-derived factors can directly induce browning of white adipocytes has not been well established. In addition, the underlying mechanism of induction of brown-like adipocytes by diet-derived factors has been unclear. Here, we demonstrate that artepillin C (ArtC), which is a typical Brazilian propolis-derived component, significantly induces brown-like adipocytes in murine C3H10T1/2 cells and primary inguinal WAT (iWAT)-derived adipocytes. This significant induction is due to activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and stabilization of PRD1-BF-1-RIZ1 homologous domain-containing protein-16 (PRDM16). Furthermore, the oral administration of ArtC (10 mg/kg) for 4 weeks significantly induced brown-like adipocytes accompanied by significant expression of UCP1 and PRDM16 proteins in iWAT of mice, and was independent of the β3-adrenergic signaling pathway via the sympathetic nervous system. These findings may provide insight into browning of white adipocytes including the molecular mechanism mediated by dietary factors and demonstrate that ArtC has a novel biological function with regard to increasing energy expenditure by browning of white adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2508312440,"Background and Objective Iran’s health system has developed a Farsi edition of the Hospital Safety Index (HSI) and has integrated the related assessment program into the health information system. This article presents the results of the 2015 estimation of hospital safety from disasters in I.R.Iran using HSI. Methods We analyzed data from 421 hospitals that had submitted a complete HSI assessment form on the Ministry of Health and Medical Education Portal System. Data collection was based on the self-assessments of the hospital disaster committees. HSI includes 145 items categorized in three components including, structural, non-structural and functional capacity. For each item, safety status was categorized into three levels: not safe (0), average safety (1) and high safety (2). A normalized scoring scheme on a 100-point scale was developed. Hospitals were classified to three safety classes according to their normalized total score: low (≤34.0), average (34.01–66.0) and high (>66.0). Results The average score of all safety components were 43.0 out of 100 (± 11.0). Eighty-two hospitals (19.4%) were classified as not safe, and 339 hospitals (80.6%) were classified in the average safety category. No hospital was placed in the high safety category. Average safety scores were 41.0, 47.0, and 42.0 for functional capacity, non-structural safety, and structural safety respectively. The average safety score increased between 2012 and 2015, from 34.0 to 43.0. Conclusions Hospital safety in the event of disasters has improved in Iran in recent years and more hospitals have joined the HSI program. This is a result of continuous efforts invested in capacity building programs and promotion of the 2012 HSI estimation. The HSI should be maintained to monitor the progress of Iran’s health system in regards to hospital safety in the case of disasters. It is recommended that WHO continue advocacy of HSI, establish a HSI monitoring system, and add it to country profiles on WHO website."
https://openalex.org/W2508793624,"We report the use of a high-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging platform to identify and quantify pressure-dependent aqueous outflow system (AOS) tissue relationships and to infer mechanical stiffness through examination of tissue properties in ex vivo human eyes. Five enucleated human eyes are included in this study, with each eye prepared with four equal-sized quadrants, each encompassing 90 degrees of the limbal circumference. In radial limbal segments perfusion pressure within Schlemm’s canal (SC) is controlled by means of a perfusion cannula inserted into the canal lumen, while the other end of the cannula leads to a reservoir at a height that can control the pressure in the cannula. The OCT system images the sample with a spatial resolution of about 5 μm from the trabecular meshwork (TM) surface. Geometric parameters are quantified from the 2D OCT images acquired from the sample subjected to controlled changes in perfusion pressures; parameters include area and height of the lumen of SC, collector channel entrances (CCE) and intrascleral collector channels (ISCC). We show that 3D OCT imaging permits the identification of 3-D relationships of the SC, CCE and ISCC lumen dimensions. Collagen flaps or leaflets are found at CCE that are attached or hinged at only one end, whilst the flaps are connected to the TM by cylindrical structures spanning SC. Increasing static SC pressures resulted in SC lumen enlargement with corresponding enlargement of the CCE and ISCC lumen. Pressure-dependent SC lumen area and height changes are significant at the 0.01 levels for ANOVA, and at the 0.05 for both polynomial curves and Tukey paired comparisons. Dynamic measurements demonstrate a synchronous increase in SC, CCE and ISCC lumen height in response to pressure changes from 0 to 10, 30 or 50 mm Hg, respectively, and the response time is within the 50-millisecond range. From the measured SC volume and corresponding IOP values, we demonstrate that an elastance curve can be developed to infer the mechanical stiffness of the TM by means of quantifying pressure-dependent SC volume changes over a 2 mm radial region of SC. Our study finds pressure-dependent motion of the TM that corresponds to collagen leaflet configuration motion at CCE; the synchronous tissue motion also corresponds with synchrony of SC and CCE lumen dimension changes."
https://openalex.org/W2507437658,"TIPE2 (TNF-α-induced protein 8-like 2) is a novel death effector domain protein and is a negative regulator of the innate and adaptive immune response. Although it has been demonstrated that caspase-8 contributes to the negative regulation of TIPE2, the negative regulatory mechanism is not entirely understood. Here, we demonstrate that TIPE2 interacts with TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a crucial regulatory molecule of inflammatory and immune signals, and consequently acts as a powerful negative regulator of TAK1. The interaction between endogenous TIPE2 and TAK1 was observed in RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells and mouse primary cells derived from spleen and thymus. The TIPE2 amino acid 101–140 region interacted with TAK1 by binding to the amino acid 200–291 region of the internal kinase domain of TAK1. TIPE2 interfered with the formation of the TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex and subsequently inhibited activation of TAK1 and its downstream molecules. Importantly, silencing TIPE2 through RNA interference attenuated the inhibitory action of TIPE2 on LPS- and TNF-α-stimulated TAK1 activity. Exogenous TIPE2 101–140, the region that interacts with TAK1, also inhibited LPS- and TNF-α-stimulated NF-κB reporter activity. Interestingly, cell-permeable TIPE2 protein maintained its binding ability with TAK1 and exhibited the same inhibitory action of native TIPE2 on TLR4 signaling in vitro. Thus, cell-permeable TIPE2 protein is a potential candidate for intracellular protein therapy for TAK1-related diseases. The present study demonstrates that TIPE2 acts as a novel negative regulator of inflammatory and immune responses through TAK1 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2513482984,"Cellular signaling leading to the initiation of apoptosis typically results in the activation of caspases, which in turn leads to the proteolytic generation of protein fragments with new or altered cellular functions. Increasing numbers of reports are demonstrating that the activity of many of these proteolytically activated protein fragments can be attenuated by their selective degradation by the N-end rule pathway. Here we report the first evidence that selective degradation of a caspase product by the N-end rule pathway can be modulated by phosphorylation. We demonstrate that the pro-apoptotic fragment of the bone marrow kinase on chromosome X (BMX) generated by caspase cleavage in the prostate cancer-derived PC3 cell line is metabolically unstable in cells because its N-terminal tryptophan targets it for proteasomal degradation via the N-end rule pathway. In addition, we have demonstrated that phosphorylation of tyrosine 566 relatively inhibits degradation of the C-terminal BMX catalytic fragment, and this phosphorylation is crucial for its pro-apoptotic function. Overall, our results demonstrate that cleaved BMX is a novel N-end rule substrate, and its degradation exhibits a novel interplay between substrate phosphorylation and N-end rule degradation, revealing an increasing complex regulatory network of apoptotic proteolytic signaling cascades."
https://openalex.org/W2517693655,"The pleiotropic cytokine interleukin 2 (IL2) disrupts the blood-brain barrier and alters brain microcirculation, underlying vascular leak syndrome that complicates cancer immunotherapy with IL2. The microvascular effects of IL2 also play a role in the development of multiple sclerosis and other chronic neurological disorders. The mechanism of IL2-induced disruption of brain microcirculation has not been determined previously. We found that both human and murine brain microvascular endothelial cells express constituents of the IL2 receptor complex. Then we established that signaling through this receptor complex leads to activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor κB, resulting in expression of proinflammatory interleukin 6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1. We also discovered that IL2 induces disruption of adherens junctions, concomitant with cytoskeletal reorganization, ultimately leading to increased endothelial cell permeability. IL2-induced phosphorylation of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), a constituent of adherens junctions, leads to dissociation of its stabilizing adaptor partners, p120-catenin and β-catenin. Increased phosphorylation of VE-cadherin was also accompanied by a reduction of Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase 2, known to maintain vascular barrier function. These results unravel the mechanism of deleterious effects induced by IL2 on brain microvascular endothelial cells and may inform the development of new measures to improve IL2 cancer immunotherapy, as well as treatments for autoimmune diseases affecting the central nervous system. The pleiotropic cytokine interleukin 2 (IL2) disrupts the blood-brain barrier and alters brain microcirculation, underlying vascular leak syndrome that complicates cancer immunotherapy with IL2. The microvascular effects of IL2 also play a role in the development of multiple sclerosis and other chronic neurological disorders. The mechanism of IL2-induced disruption of brain microcirculation has not been determined previously. We found that both human and murine brain microvascular endothelial cells express constituents of the IL2 receptor complex. Then we established that signaling through this receptor complex leads to activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor κB, resulting in expression of proinflammatory interleukin 6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1. We also discovered that IL2 induces disruption of adherens junctions, concomitant with cytoskeletal reorganization, ultimately leading to increased endothelial cell permeability. IL2-induced phosphorylation of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), a constituent of adherens junctions, leads to dissociation of its stabilizing adaptor partners, p120-catenin and β-catenin.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) 3The abbreviations used are: BBB, blood brain barrier; VE-cadherin, vascular endothelial cadherin; BMEC, brain microvascular endothelial cell; VLS, vascular leak syndrome; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; MCP1, macrophage chemoattractant protein 1; IL2R, IL2 receptor; AJ, adherens junction; p120, p120-catenin; SHP2, Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase 2; HI-FBS, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; qPCR, quantitative real time PCR; vWF, von Willebrand factor; PECAM1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; ANOVA, analysis of variance. is formed by endothelial cells that line the microcirculation and are part of the “neurovascular unit” composed of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), astrocytes, and neurons (1.Abbott N.J. Rönnbäck L. Hansson E. Astrocyte-endothelial interactions at the blood-brain barrier.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (3736) Google Scholar). BMECs play an essential role in these functional units, even prompting neurological changes following endothelial activation. For example, BMECs are stimulated by inflammatory mediator interleukin 1β, causing fever and lethargy (2.Ridder D.A. Lang M.F. Salinin S. Röderer J.P. Struss M. Maser-Gluth C. Schwaninger M. TAK1 in brain endothelial cells mediates fever and lethargy.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 2615-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Likewise, IL2, the mainstay of the first effective cancer immunotherapy, induces neuropsychiatric changes in patients through a hitherto undefined mechanism (3.Denicoff K.D. Rubinow D.R. Papa M.Z. Simpson C. Seipp C.A. Lotze M.T. Chang A.E. Rosenstein D. Rosenberg S.A. The neuropsychiatric effects of treatment with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cells.Ann. Intern. Med. 1987; 107: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). This therapy consists of IL2-induced activation and proliferation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes that lead to remission of renal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma (4.Rosenberg S.A. IL-2: the first effective immunotherapy for human cancer.J. Immunol. 2014; 192: 5451-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). However, these beneficial effects of IL2 are curtailed by the development of brain edema, a prominent manifestation of vascular leak syndrome (VLS). Brain edema subsides upon cessation of IL2 immunotherapy, indicating its direct role in this serious complication. Thus, IL2-induced vascular permeability in the central nervous system and other organs represents an undesirable off-target effect (5.Saris S.C. Patronas N.J. Rosenberg S.A. Alexander J.T. Frank J. Schwartzentruber D.J. Rubin J.T. Barba D. Oldfield E.H. The effect of intravenous interleukin-2 on brain water content.J. Neurosurg. 1989; 71: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, IL2 plays a significant role in several chronic neurological autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (6.Ichinose K.

Disruption of the BBB is a critical step in development of these neurological conditions. However, the mechanism of adverse action of IL2 on the barrier function of brain microvascular endothelial cells remains unknown. The maintenance of BBB function is largely vested in BMEC intercellular junctions, a complex network of adhesive proteins organized into adherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions (9.Hatanaka K. Lanahan A.A. Murakami M. Simons M. Fibroblast growth factor signaling potentiates VE-cadherin stability at adherens junctions by regulating SHP2.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e37600Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). AJs are ubiquitously expressed in the vascular tree (10.Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. Adherens junctions in endothelial cells regulate vessel maintenance and angiogenesis.Thromb. Res. 2007; 120: S1-S6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and are of particular importance in microvascular circulation, which provides the largest surface area of exchange between blood and tissue (11.Hawiger J. Veach R.A. Zienkiewicz J. New paradigms in sepsis: from prevention to protection of failing microcirculation.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2015; 13: 1743-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, postcapillary venules comprise the main endothelial surface for activation and emigration of immune cells that mediate inflammatory reactions (12.Abu Taha A. Schnittler H.J. Dynamics between actin and the VE-cadherin/catenin complex: novel aspects of the ARP2/3 complex in regulation of endothelial junctions.Cell Adh. Migr. 2014; 8: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Formation of AJs is dependent on the homotypic interaction of cell surface transmembrane proteins termed cadherins whose cytoplasmic tails associate with intracellular binding partners termed catenins. Thus, the stability of AJs depends on complex formation between vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), p120-catenin (p120), β-catenin, and plakoglobin (9.Hatanaka K. Lanahan A.A. Murakami M. Simons M. Fibroblast growth factor signaling potentiates VE-cadherin stability at adherens junctions by regulating SHP2.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e37600Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, destabilization of AJs is due to a loss of p120 and β-catenin binding, which causes the internalization of VE-cadherin (13.Xiao K. Garner J. Buckley K.M. Vincent P.A. Chiasson C.M.

This process is induced by increased phosphorylation of VE-cadherin accompanied by a decrease in Src homology domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2), which maintains vascular barrier function (15.Ukropec J.A.

Immunol. 2014; 15: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In general, activation of endothelial cells results in expression of cell adhesion molecules along with proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, enhancing an autoregulatory feed-forward loop that leads to further recruitment of immune cells and escalation of the inflammatory response (18.Greenwood J. Heasman S.J. Alvarez J.I. Prat A. Lyck R. Engelhardt B. Review: leucocyte-endothelial cell crosstalk at the blood-brain barrier: a prerequisite for successful immune cell entry to the brain.Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 2011; 37: 24-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Genes encoding these mediators of inflammation are controlled by nuclear factor κB (NFκB), master regulator of immunity and inflammation. Increased expression of interleukin 6 (IL6), macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1/CCL2), intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 among others has been linked to the NFκB pathway (19.Kempe S. Kestler H. Lasar A. Wirth T.

Baltimore D. Activation of interleukin-6 gene expression through the NF-κB transcription factor.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2327-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In lymphocytes, IL2-evoked signaling mediated by its high affinity trimeric receptor (IL2Rαβγ) has been previously coupled to activation of the NFκB pathway (21.Arima N. Kuziel W.A. Grdina T.A. Greene W.C. IL-2-induced signal transduction involves the activation of nuclear NF-κB expression.J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 83-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we analyze the mechanism of IL2-induced activation of human and murine brain microvascular endothelial cells and the resulting disruption of BMEC barrier function. We report that IL2 induces activation of the NFκB pathway, leading to increased expression of proinflammatory mediators. In parallel, IL2 causes disruption of AJs through an increase in VE-cadherin phosphorylation. As a consequence, microvascular endothelial monolayer permeability was increased. Whereas IL2-induced disruption of the BBB changes the central nervous system milieu and leads to subsequent brain edema, our study may contribute to the development of new strategies for protecting brain function from this deleterious process.

Obtained values were normalized in reference to β-actin or TATA-binding protein detected with their cognate antibodies (Abcam) in cytosolic and nuclear extracts as indicated. Adherens junction protein complexes were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with antibodies against p120 or VE-cadherin. Species-specific IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a control. The lysates were precleared with protein A/G-agarose beads (Thermo) prior to addition of antibodies or control IgG. The immune complexes were then captured with protein A/G-agarose beads and analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting using antibodies against p120, VE-cadherin, and β-catenin with the LI-COR Odyssey infrared imaging system as described previously (25.Qiao H. Liu Y. Veach R.A. Wylezinski L. Hawiger J. The adaptor CRADD/RAIDD controls activation of endothelial cells by proinflammatory stimuli.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 21973-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cytokines and chemokines in tissue culture medium supernatants were assayed by cytometric bead array (BD Biosciences) in the Vanderbilt Flow Cytometry Shared Resource according to the manufacturer's instructions as described previously (25.Qiao H. Liu Y. Veach R.A. Wylezinski L. Hawiger J. The adaptor CRADD/RAIDD controls activation of endothelial cells by proinflammatory stimuli.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 21973-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). During time- and concentration-dependent titration experiments, supernatant samples were taken following stimulation as indicated. Cytokine and chemokine expression was also analyzed in medium from BMEC monolayers cultured in Transwell chambers for permeability experiments. Medium samples were taken from the upper chamber following stimulation as indicated but prior to addition of FITC-dextran tracer. Human hCMEC/D3 or murine bEnd.3 cells grown to confluence on Transwell permeability supports were stimulated with species-specific IL2 (BD Biosciences, Prometheus) or TNFα (Invitrogen) as indicated. After stimulation, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences), washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Invitrogen). For immunostaining, cells were blocked with 5% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) before overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibodies to NFκB p65 (Abcam) or VE-cadherin and p120 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen)-, Cy3-, or Cy5-labeled (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) secondary antibodies. F-actin polymerization was visualized in permeabilized cells with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled phalloidin (Cytoskeleton, Inc.). After staining, the semipermeable membranes were removed from the Transwell permeability supports and mounted on slides with ProLong Gold antifade reagent containing DAPI (Invitrogen) to counterstain nuclei. Images were captured and analyzed with MetaMorph software on an Axioplan widefield microscope in the Vanderbilt Cell Imaging Core facility using a ×63 oil immersion objective. Human hCMEC/D3 or murine bEnd.3 cells (1 × 105) were seeded onto 24-well Transwell semipermeable supports (Costar) precoated with type 1 collagen (Cultrex) and incubated until confluent. Upon confluence, as verified by microscopy, growth medium was exchanged for serum-depleted medium that comprised growth medium with a low concentration (0.5%) of HI-FBS. Following 24-h culture in low serum medium, cells were left unstimulated or stimulated for 24 h with species-specific 300 kilounits/ml IL2 or 30 ng/ml TNFα. In experiments utilizing neutralizing antibodies, species-specific murine anti-IL6 and anti-MCP1 (R&D Systems) and human anti-IL6 (R&D Systems) and anti-MCP1 (Sigma) were added concomitantly with IL2. Human anti-IL2Rβ antibody (R&D Systems) was added 30 min prior to IL2 stimulation. Antibody concentrations necessary for neutralization were calculated from the levels of cytokine/chemokine expression during titration of IL2. Monolayer permeability was assessed by detection of FITC-dextran in the lower chamber at various times after addition of 1 mg/ml 10-kDa FITC-dextran (Sigma) to the upper chamber. Human and murine BMECs were cultured and treated as described previously for permeability experiments. Following 24-h stimulation, the supernatant was removed from the Transwell chambers, and cellular detachment/apoptosis was measured using the trypan blue exclusion assay. Data analysis and statistical calculations were performed using Prism (GraphPad). Cytokine and chemokine levels in cultured cell supernatants and Western blotting quantification of comparative controls were analyzed using an unpaired t test with Welch's correction or Student's t test as indicated. Western blotting quantifications of multiple time points were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Quantification of real time PCR results was calculated as a -fold change in transcripts compared with non-stimulated samples, and statistical differences were determined by Student's t test. For permeability experiments, p values shown represent comparison of the area under the curve calculated for each experiment and/or condition analyzed by unpaired t test with Welch's correction. In all experiments, a p value of <0.05 was considered significant. In an effort to ensure that the endothelial cell phenotype was maintained in this study, we analyzed two well known markers specific for endothelial cells, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1) (26.Middleton J. Americh L. Gayon R. Julien D. Mansat M. Mansat P. Anract P. Cantagrel A. Cattan P. Reimund J.M. Aguilar L. Amalric F. Girard J.P.

Pathol. 2005; 206: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As expected, both human hCMEC/D3 and murine bEnd.3 cells constitutively expressed high levels of vWF and PECAM1 transcripts compared with human and murine non-endothelial cells (HEK cells and MEFs) when analyzed by qPCR (Fig. 1A). Our qPCR results in both human hCMEC/D3 and murine bEnd.3 cells complement previous characterization in terms of protein expression of vWF and PECAM1 (22.Weksler B.B. Subileau E.A. Perrière N. Charneau P. Holloway K. Leveque M. Tricoire-Leignel H. Nicotra A. Bourdoulous S. Turowski P. Male D.K. Roux F. Greenwood J. Romero I.A. Couraud P.O.

Frazier W.A. Down-regulation of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 results in thrombospondin-1 expression and concerted regulation of endothelial cell phenotype.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Next, we assessed IL2 receptor subunit expression by qPCR and Western blotting to ascertain whether BMECs can respond to IL2. The IL2 receptor complex comprises the high affinity trimeric configuration (IL2Rαβγ) or the intermediate affinity dimer (IL2Rβγ) (28.Minami Y. Kono T. Miyazaki T. Taniguchi T. The IL-2 receptor complex: its structure, function, and target genes.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 245-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We documented that IL2Rβ (CD122) and IL2Rγ (CD132) are expressed constitutively at both the transcript and protein levels. Conversely, these transcripts were barely detectable in control cell lines of human and murine origin (HEK cells and MEFs). IL2Rα (CD25) transcripts were only detected in BMECs, but not control cells, after agonist stimulation for 24 h and corroborated with detection of the protein by Western blotting (Fig. 1B). Without constitutive expression of CD25 and formation of the trimeric receptor complex, affinity for IL2 is reduced 10–100 times (29.Krieg C. Létourneau S. Pantaleo G. Boyman O. Improved IL-2 immunotherapy by selective stimulation of IL-2 receptors on lymphocytes and endothelial cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 11906-11911Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Therefore, we based our experimental protocol on using sufficiently high concentrations of IL2 to stimulate naïve BMECs and overcome their lower signaling capacity via the intermediate affinity receptor complex (IL2Rβγ). As compared with human hCMEC/D3 cells, murine bEnd.3 cells displayed significantly higher transcript levels of IL2Rβ, the receptor subunit most attributed to mediating positive signal transduction (28.Minami Y. Kono T. Miyazaki T. Taniguchi T. The IL-2 receptor complex: its structure, function, and target genes.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 245-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Ruiz-Medina B.E.

No significant difference between human and murine cells was detected in transcript levels of inducible IL2Rα subunit or constitutive IL2Rγ subunit. However, a trend toward higher expression of IL2Rγ was observed in murine bEnd.3 cells. Thus, these results establish the expression of the IL2 intermediate affinity receptor complex on both human and murine BMECs. We hypothesized that IL2-induced activation of BMECs entails signaling through the NFκB pathway akin to IL15 (31.Stone K.P. Kastin A.J. Pan W. NFκB is an unexpected major mediator of interleukin-15 signaling in cerebral endothelia.Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2011; 28: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used three experimental approaches to analyze NFκB signaling in IL2-stimulated BMECs and compared the results with those evoked by a known endothelial agonist, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent activator of the NFκB pathway (32.Cordle S.R. Donald R. Read M.A. Hawiger J. Lipopolysaccharide induces phosphorylation of MAD3 and activation of c-Rel and related NF-κB proteins in human monocytic THP-1 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11803-11810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, we determined that IκBα, the inhibitory protein responsible for sequestering NFκB p65 (RelA) in the cytoplasm, becomes degraded following IL2 stimulation in both human and murine BMECs (Fig. 2A). Due to the very rapid turnover kinetics of IκBα (33.Donald R. Ballard D.W. Hawiger J. Proteolytic processing of NF-κB/IκB in human monocytes. ATP-dependent induction by pro-inflammatory mediators.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we included the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide to prevent reaccumulation of newly synthesized IκBα. Constitutive turnover was measured following addition of cycloheximide and compared with degradation in BMECs stimulated with agonist. Stimulation with IL2 caused time-dependent degradation of IκBα with a loss of 30–70% of its basal level, mimicking IκBα degradation following activation with LPS. Notably, the kinetics of IκBα degradation was faster in hu"

Methods Electromagnetic field simulations are conducted to detail RF power deposition, transmission field uniformity and efficiency for local and body RF coil transmission. For both excitation regimes transmission field maps are acquired in a human torso phantom. For each transmission regime flip angle distributions and blood-myocardium contrast are examined in a volunteer study of 12 subjects. The feasibility of the local transceiver RF coil array for cardiac chamber quantification at 3 Tesla is demonstrated. Results Our simulations and experiments demonstrate that cardiac MR at 3 Tesla using four-channel surface RF coil transmission is competitive versus current clinical CMR practice of large volume body RF coil transmission. The efficiency advantage of the 4TX/4RX setup facilitates shorter repetition times governed by local SAR limits versus body RF coil transmission at whole-body SAR limit. No statistically significant difference was found for cardiac chamber quantification derived with body RF coil versus four-channel surface RF coil transmission. Our simulation also show that the body RF coil exceeds local SAR limits by a factor of ~2 when driven at maximum applicable input power to reach the whole-body SAR limit. Conclusion Pursuing local surface RF coil arrays for transmission in cardiac MR is a conceptually appealing alternative to body RF coil transmission, especially for patients with implants."
https://openalex.org/W2517479901,"Monitoring the environment with serine/threonine protein kinases is critical for growth and survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a devastating human pathogen. Protein kinase B (PknB) is a transmembrane serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as an essential regulator of mycobacterial growth and division. The PknB extracellular domain (ECD) consists of four repeats homologous to penicillin-binding protein and serine/threonine kinase associated (PASTA) domains, and binds fragments of peptidoglycan. These properties suggest that PknB activity is modulated by ECD binding to peptidoglycan substructures, however, the molecular mechanisms underpinning PknB regulation remain unclear. In this study, we report structural and genetic characterization of the PknB ECD. We determined the crystal structures of overlapping ECD fragments at near atomic resolution, built a model of the full ECD, and discovered a region on the C-terminal PASTA domain that has the properties of a ligand-binding site. Hydrophobic interaction between this surface and a bound molecule of citrate was observed in a crystal structure. Our genetic analyses in M. tuberculosis showed that nonfunctional alleles were produced either by deletion of any of single PASTA domain or by mutation of individual conserved residues lining the putative ligand-binding surface of the C-terminal PASTA repeat. These results define two distinct structural features necessary for PknB signal transduction, a fully extended ECD and a conserved, membrane-distal putative ligand-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2509545269,"Neurofibrillar tangles caused by intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau inclusion and extracellular amyloid β peptide deposition are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Tau contains one or two cysteine residues in three or four repeats of the microtubule binding region following alternative splicing of exon 10, and formation of intermolecular cysteine disulfide bonds accelerates tau aggregation. 8-Nitroguanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-nitro-cGMP) acts as a novel second messenger of nitric oxide (NO) by covalently binding cGMP to cysteine residues by electrophilic properties, a process termed protein S-guanylation. Here we studied S-guanylation of tau and its effects on tau aggregation. 8-Nitro-cGMP exposure induced S-guanylation of tau both in vitro and in tau-overexpressed HEK293T cells. S-guanylated tau inhibited heparin-induced tau aggregation in a thioflavin T assay. Atomic force microscopy observations indicated that S-guanylated tau could not form tau granules and fibrils. Further biochemical analyses showed that S-guanylated tau was inhibited at the step of tau oligomer formation. In P301L tau-expressing Neuro2A cells, 8-nitro-cGMP treatment significantly reduced the amount of sarcosyl-insoluble tau. NO-linked chemical modification on cysteine residues of tau could block tau aggregation, and therefore, increasing 8-nitro-cGMP levels in the brain could become a potential therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease."

Glycerophospholipids are major constituents of cellular membranes. More than 1000 molecular species of glycerophospholipids differ in their polar head groups and fatty acid compositions. They are related to cellular functions and diseases and have beenwell analyzed by mass spectrometry. However, intracellular imaging of fatty acids and glycerophospholipids has not been successful due to insufficient resolution using conventional methods. Here, we developed a method for labeling fatty acids with bromine (Br) and applied scanning X-ray fluorescence microscopy (SXFM) to obtain intracellular Br mapping data with submicrometer resolution. Mass spectrometry showed that cells took up Br-labeled fatty acids andmetabolized them mainly into glycerophospholipids in CHO cells. Most Br signals observed by SXFM were in the perinuclear region. Higher resolution revealed a spot-like distribution of Br inthe cytoplasm. Thecurrentmethodenabledsuccessful visualizationof intracellular Br-labeledfatty acids.

https://openalex.org/W2513365214,"The ways in which homeless individuals cope with stress may differ from those relied upon by the members of the general population and these differences may either be the result or the cause of their living conditions. The aim of the study was to determine the preferred coping style among the homeless and its relationship with alcohol dependence.The study included 78 homeless individuals and involved the collection of demographic, sociological, psychological and medical data from each participant. Coping styles relied upon when dealing with stressful situations were assessed using a Polish adaptation of the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations. Alcohol dependence was assessed using the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST) and a quantitative analysis of alcohol consumption.Men accounted for 91.93% of the study population. Nearly 75% of the subjects met the alcohol dependence criterion. Significant relationships were observed between the individual's age, preferred coping style and alcohol consumption level. As an individual's age increased, the use of emotion-oriented coping styles decreased, while an increase in alcohol consumption was associated with a more frequent use of emotion- and avoidance-oriented strategies.The findings of this study, similarly to those of many other studies of homeless individuals but investigating other areas (e.g. epidemiology of tuberculosis and traumatic injuries), are an exaggerated representation of associations observed in the general population. The results describe a group of people living on the margins of the society, often suffering from extremely advanced alcoholism, with clear evident psychodegradation. The presence of specific ways of coping with stress related to excessive alcohol consumption in this group of individuals may interfere with active participation in support programmes provided for the homeless and may further exacerbate their problems."
https://openalex.org/W2517918724,"Although Aedes fluviatilis is an anthropophilic mosquito found abundantly in urban environments, its biology, epidemiological potential and genetic characteristics are poorly understood. Climate change and urbanization processes that result in environmental modifications benefit certain anthropophilic mosquito species such as Ae. fluviatilis, greatly increasing their abundance in urban areas. To gain a better understanding of whether urbanization processes modulate the genetic structure of this species in the city of São Paulo, we used eight microsatellite loci to genetically characterize Ae. fluviatilis populations collected in nine urban parks in the city of São Paulo. Our results show that there is high gene flow among the populations of this species, heterozygosity deficiency and low genetic structure and that the species may have undergone a recent population expansion. There are two main hypotheses to explain these findings: (i) Ae. fluviatilis populations have undergone a population expansion as a result of urbanization; and (ii) as urbanization of the city of São Paulo occurred recently and was quite intense, the structuring of these populations cannot be observed yet, apart from in the populations of Ibirapuera and Piqueri parks, where the first signs of structuring have appeared. We believe that the expansion found in Ae. fluviatilis populations is probably correlated with the unplanned urbanization of the city of São Paulo, which transformed green areas into urbanized areas, as well as the increasing population density in the city."
https://openalex.org/W2519626381,"α1-Antitrypsin is a serine protease inhibitor produced in the liver that is responsible for the regulation of pulmonary inflammation. The commonest pathogenic genemutation yields Z-α1-antitrypsin, which has a propensity to self-associate forming polymers that become trapped in inclusions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is unclear whether these inclusions are connected to the main ER network in Z-α1-antitrypsin-expressing cells. Using live cell imaging, we found that despite inclusions containing an immobile matrix of polymeric α1-antitrypsin, small ER resident proteins can diffuse freely within them. Inclusions havemany features to suggest they represent fragmented ER, and some are physically separated from the tubular ER network, yetwe observed cargo to be transported between them in a cytosol-dependent fashion that is sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide and dependent on Sar1 and sec22B. We conclude that protein recycling occurs between ER inclusions despite their physical separation.—Dickens, J. A., Ordóñez, A., Chambers, J. E., Beckett, A.

https://openalex.org/W2518567858,"Live birth has emerged as a reproductive strategy many times across vertebrate evolution; however, mammals account for the majority of viviparous vertebrates. Marsupials are a mammalian lineage that last shared a common ancestor with eutherians (placental mammals) over 148 million years ago. Marsupials are noted for giving birth to highly altricial young after a short gestation, and represent humans' most distant viviparous mammalian relatives. Here we ask what insight can be gained into the evolution of viviparity in mammals specifically and vertebrates in general by analyzing the global uterine transcriptome in a marsupial. Transcriptome analyses were performed using NextGen sequencing of uterine RNA samples from the gray short-tailed opossum, Monodelphis domestica. Samples were collected from late stage pregnant, virgin, and non-pregnant experienced breeders. Three different algorithms were used to determine differential expression, and results were confirmed by quantitative PCR. Over 900 opossum gene transcripts were found to be significantly more abundant in the pregnant uterus than non-pregnant, and over 1400 less so. Most with increased abundance were genes related to metabolism, immune systems processes, and transport. This is the first study to characterize the transcriptomic differences between pregnant, non-pregnant breeders, and virgin marsupial uteruses and helps to establish a set of pregnancy-associated genes in the opossum. These observations allowed for comparative analyses of the differentially transcribed genes with other mammalian and non-mammalian viviparous species, revealing similarities in pregnancy related gene expression over 300 million years of amniote evolution."

Between 2007 and 2015, 828 stool samples from returning soldiers were enriched in nonselective broth and incubated on selective agars for Enterobacteriaceae expressing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), VRE and MRSA. Identification and resistance testing of suspicious colonies was performed using MALDI-TOF-MS, VITEK-II and agar diffusion gradient testing (bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, France). Isolates with suspicion of ESBL were characterized by ESBL/ampC disc-(ABCD)-testing and molecular approaches (PCR, Sanger sequencing). Among the returnees, E. coli with resistance against third-generation cephalosporins (37 ESBL, 1 ESBL + ampC, 1 uncertain mechanism) were found in 39 instances (4.7%). Associated quinolone resistance was found in 46.2% of these isolates. Beta-lactamases of the blaCTX-M group 1 predominated among the ESBL mechanisms, followed by the blaCTX-M group 9, and blaSHV. VRE of vanA-type was isolated from one returnee (0.12%). MRSA was not isolated at all. There was no clear trend regarding the distribution of resistant isolates during the assessment period. Compared with colonization with resistant bacteria described in civilians returning from the tropics, the colonization in returned soldiers is surprisingly low and stable. This finding, together with high colonization rates found in previous screenings on deployment, suggests a loss of colonization during the 8- to 12-week period between returning from the deployments and assessment."

In IDO-KO mice treated with CCl4, the number of several inflammatory cells and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines increased in the liver. In the results, activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and fibrogenic factors on HSCs increased after repetitive CCl4 administration in IDO-KO mice compared to WT mice. Moreover, the treatment with l-tryptophan aggravated the CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in WT mice.

https://openalex.org/W2520491064,"Ribose can be used for energy or as a component of several important biomolecules, but for it to be used in either capacity it must first be phosphorylated by ribokinase (RBSK). RBSK proteins are part of the phosphofructokinase-B (pfkB) family of carbohydrate kinases. Sequence comparisons of pfkB proteins from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana with the human and Escherichia coli RBSK identified a single candidate RBSK, At1g17160 (AtRBSK). AtRBSK is more similar to predicted RBSKs from other plant species and known mammalian and prokaryotic RBSK than to all other PfkB proteins in Arabidopsis. AtRBSK contains a predicted chloroplast transit peptide, and we confirmed plastid localization using AtRBSK fused to YFP. Structure prediction software verified that the AtRBSK sequence mapped onto a known RBSK structure. Kinetic parameters of purified recombinant AtRBSK were determined to be Kmribose = 150 μm ± 17 μm, KmATP = 45 μm ± 5.6 μm, and kcat = 2.0 s−1. Substrate inhibition was observed for AtRBSK (KiATP = 2.44 mm ± 0.36 mm), as has been demonstrated for other RBSK proteins. Ribose accumulated in Arabidopsis plants lacking AtRBSK. Such plants grew normally unless media was supplemented with ribose, which led to chlorosis and growth inhibition. Both chlorosis and ribose accumulation were abolished upon the introduction of a transgene expressing AtRBSK-MYC, demonstrating that the loss of protein is responsible for ribose hypersensitivity. Ribose accumulation in plants lacking AtRBSK was reduced in plants also deficient in the nucleoside ribohydrolase NSH1, linking AtRBSK activity to nucleoside metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2513369451,"The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the most highly associated susceptibility locus for late onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and augmenting the beneficial physiological functions of apoE is a proposed therapeutic strategy. In a high throughput phenotypic screen for small molecules that enhance apoE secretion from human CCF-STTG1 astrocytoma cells, we show the chrysanthemic ester 82879 robustly increases expressed apoE up to 9.4-fold and secreted apoE up to 6-fold and is associated with increased total cholesterol in conditioned media. Compound 82879 is unique as structural analogues, including pyrethroid esters, show no effect on apoE expression or secretion. 82879 also stimulates liver x receptor (LXR) target genes including ATP binding cassette A1 (ABCA1), LXRα and inducible degrader of low density lipoprotein receptor (IDOL) at both mRNA and protein levels. In particular, the lipid transporter ABCA1 was increased by up to 10.6-fold upon 82879 treatment. The findings from CCF-STTG1 cells were confirmed in primary human astrocytes from three donors, where increased apoE and ABCA1 was observed along with elevated secretion of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-like apoE particles. Nuclear receptor transactivation assays revealed modest direct LXR agonism by compound 82879, yet 10 μM of 82879 significantly upregulated apoE mRNA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) depleted of both LXRα and LXRβ, demonstrating that 82879 can also induce apoE expression independent of LXR transactivation. By contrast, deletion of LXRs in MEFs completely blocked mRNA changes in ABCA1 even at 10 μM of 82879, indicating the ability of 82879 to stimulate ABCA1 expression is entirely dependent on LXR transactivation. Taken together, compound 82879 is a novel chrysanthemic ester capable of modulating apoE secretion as well as apoE-associated lipid metabolic pathways in astrocytes, which is structurally and mechanistically distinct from known LXR agonists."
https://openalex.org/W2517238873,"Tubular epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been widely accepted as the underlying mechanisms of renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF). The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a vital role in tubular EMT process. The purpose of this study was to investigate the involved molecular mechanisms in TGF-beta-induced EMT and identify the potential role of glutathione S-transferase alpha 3 (GSTA3) in this process. The iTRAQ screening was performed to identify protein alterations of the rats underwent unilateral-ureteral obstruction (UUO). Protein expression of GSTA3 in patients with obstructive nephropathy and UUO rats was detected by immunohistochemistry. Protein and mRNA expression of GSTA3 in UUO rats and NRK-52E cells were determined by Western blot and RT-PCR. siRNA and overexpression plasmid were transfected specifically to assess the role of GSTA3 in RIF. The generation of ROS was measured by dichlorofluorescein fluorescence analysis. GSTA3 protein and mRNA expression was significantly reduced in UUO rats. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that GSTA3 expression was reduced in renal cortex in UUO rats and patients with obstructive nephropathy. Treating with TGF-β1 down-regulated GSTA3 expression in NRK-52E cells, which have been found to be correlated with the decreased expression in E-cadherin and megalin and increased expression in α-smooth muscle actin. Furthermore, knocking down GSTA3 in NRK-52 cells led to increased production of ROS and tubular EMT, whereas overexpressing GSTA3 ameliorated ROS production and prevented the occurrence of tubular EMT. GSTA3 plays a protective role against tubular EMT in renal fibrosis, suggesting GSTA3 is a potential therapeutic target for RIF."
https://openalex.org/W2507946820,"Disease-causing mutations in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) genes, including the V2 vasopressin receptor (V2R) gene, often cause misfolded receptors, leading to a defect in plasma membrane trafficking. A novel V2R mutation, T273M, identified in a boy with partial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), shows intracellular localization and partial defects similar to the two mutants we described previously (10). Although non-peptide V2R antagonists have been shown to rescue the membrane localization of V2R mutants, their level of functional rescue is weak. Interestingly, it has been reported that a non-peptide agonist, OPC51803, activates misfolded V2R mutants intracellularly without degradation, thus potentially serving as a therapeutic agent against NDI (14). In our current experiments, however, a peptide antagonist blocked arginine vasopressin (AVP)- or OPC51803-stimulated cAMP accumulation both in COS-7 and MDCK cells, suggesting that OPC51803 mainly stimulates cell surface V2R mutants. In addition, our analyses revealed that OPC51803 works not only as a non-peptide agonist that causes activation/β-arrestin-dependent desensitization of V2R mutants expressed at the plasma membrane but also as a pharmacochaperone that promotes the endoplasmic reticulum-retained mutant maturation and trafficking to the plasma membrane. The ratio of the pharmacochaperone effect to the desensitization effect likely correlates negatively with the residual function of the tested mutants, suggesting that OPC5 has a more favorable effect on the V2R mutants with a less residual function. We speculated that the canceling of the desensitization effect of OPC51803 by the pharmacochaperone effect after long-term treatment may produce sustainable signaling, and thus pharmacochaperone agonists such as OPC51803 may serve as promising therapeutics for NDI caused by misfolded V2R mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2516638500,"Major depressive disorder is often associated with deficits in social and cognitive functioning. Mice transgenic for acid sphingomyelinase (t-ASM) were previously shown to have a depressive-like phenotype, which could be normalized by antidepressant treatment. Here, we investigated whether t-ASM mice show deficits in social behavior and memory performance, and whether these possible deficits might be normalized by amitriptyline treatment. Our results revealed that ASM overexpression altered the behavior of mice in a sex-dependent manner. As such, t-ASM female, but not male, mice showed an impaired social preference and a depressive- and anxiogenic-like phenotype, which could be normalized by amitriptyline treatment. Both male and female t-ASM mice showed unaltered preference for social novelty, novel object recognition, and social and object discrimination abilities. Amitriptyline treatment impaired novel object recognition and object discrimination abilities in female, but not in male, wild-type mice, while female t-ASM mice showed unaltered novel object recognition and object discrimination abilities. This study suggests that female t-ASM mice represent a model of depression with comorbid anxiety and social deficits, without memory impairments. It further suggests that ASM overexpression has a protective role against the detrimental effects of amitriptyline on female, but not on male, non-social (object) memory."
https://openalex.org/W2515945356,"The Amazon River has the largest discharge of all rivers on Earth, and its complex plume system fuels a wide array of biogeochemical processes, across a large area of the western tropical North Atlantic. The plume thus stimulates microbial processes affecting carbon sequestration and nutrient cycles at a global scale. Chromosomal gene expression patterns of the 2.0 to 156 μm size-fraction eukaryotic microbial community were investigated in the Amazon River Plume, generating a robust dataset (more than 100 million mRNA sequences) that depicts the metabolic capabilities and interactions among the eukaryotic microbes. Combining classical oceanographic field measurements with metatranscriptomics yielded characterization of the hydrographic conditions simultaneous with a quantification of transcriptional activity and identity of the community. We highlight the patterns of eukaryotic gene expression for 31 biogeochemically significant gene targets hypothesized to be valuable within forecasting models. An advantage to this targeted approach is that the database of reference sequences used to identify the target genes was selectively constructed and highly curated optimizing taxonomic coverage, throughput, and the accuracy of annotations. A coastal diatom bloom highly expressed nitrate transporters and carbonic anhydrase presumably to support high growth rates and enhance uptake of low levels of dissolved nitrate and CO2. Diatom-diazotroph association (DDA: diatoms with nitrogen fixing symbionts) blooms were common when surface salinity was mesohaline and dissolved nitrate concentrations were below detection, and hence did not show evidence of nitrate utilization, suggesting they relied on ammonium transporters to aquire recently fixed nitrogen. These DDA blooms in the outer plume had rapid turnover of the photosystem D1 protein presumably caused by photodegradation under increased light penetration in clearer waters, and increased expression of silicon transporters as silicon became limiting. Expression of these genes, including carbonic anhydrase and transporters for nitrate and phosphate, were found to reflect the physiological status and biogeochemistry of river plume environments. These relatively stable patterns of eukaryotic transcript abundance occurred over modest spatiotemporal scales, with similarity observed in sample duplicates collected up to 2.45 km in space and 120 minutes in time. These results confirm the use of metatranscriptomics as a valuable tool to understand and predict microbial community function."

The mixture contained metals, perfluorinated compounds, PCB, dioxins, pesticides, heterocyclic amines, phthalate, PAHs and others, with a combined dose of 0.16 (Low dose), 0.47 (Mid dose) or 1.6 (High dose) mg/kg bw/day. The lowest dose was designed with the aim of obtaining plasma or urine concentrations in rats at levels approaching those observed in humans. Some single congeners were administered at doses representative of combined doses for chemical groups. With this baseline, we found effects on weight, histology and gene expression in the liver, as well as changes to the blood plasma metabolome in all exposure groups, including low-dose. Additional adverse effects were observed in the higher dosed groups, including enlarged kidneys and alterations to the metabolome. No significant effects on reproductive parameters were observed."

Therefore, in this study as first step, in solution and 1-D electrophoresis digestion approach combined with tandem mass spectrometry (nano LC-MS/MS) and computational bioinformatics for data mining was used to prepare a baseline proteomic catalogue of salivary gland proteins of sugar fed An. culicifacies mosquitoes. A total of 106 proteins were identified and analyzed by SEQUEST algorithm against mosquito protein database from Uniprot/NCBI. Importantly, D7r1, D7r2, D7r4, salivary apyrase, anti-platelet protein, calreticulin, antigen 5 family proteins were identified and grouped on the basis of biological and functional roles. Secondly, differential protein expression and annotations between salivary glands of sugar fed vs blood fed mosquitoes was analyzed using 2-Delectrophoresis combined with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The alterations in the differential expression of total 38 proteins was observed out of which 29 proteins like beclin-1, phosphorylating proteins, heme oxygenase 1, ferritin, apoptotic proteins, coagulation and immunity like, serine proteases, serpins, c-type lectin and protein in regulation of blood feeding behavior were found to be up regulated while 9 proteins related to blood feeding, juvenile hormone epoxide hydrolase ii, odorant binding proteins and energy metabolic enzymes were found to be down regulated. To our knowledge, this study provides a first time baseline proteomic dataset and functional annotations of An. culicifacies salivary gland proteins that may be involved during the blood feeding. Identification of differential salivary proteins between sugar fed and blood fed mosquitoes and their plausible role may provide insights into the physiological processes associated with feeding behavior and sporozoite transmission during the process of blood feeding."
https://openalex.org/W2520154016,"Although it has been recognized for a long time that the predisposition to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is determined by many risk factors and despite the common use of algorithms incorporating several of these factors to predict the overall risk, there has yet been no global description of the complex way in which CVD risk factors interact with each other. This is the aim of the present study which investigated all existing relationships between the main CVD risk factors in a well-characterized occupational cohort. Prospective associations between 12 behavioural and clinical risk factors (gender, age, parental history of CVD, non-moderate alcohol consumption, smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, sleep disorder, depression) were systematically tested using Cox regression in 10,736 middle-aged individuals free of CVD at baseline and followed over 20 years. In addition to independently predicting CVD risk (HRs from 1.18 to 1.97 in multivariable models), these factors form a vast network of associations where each factor predicts, and/or is predicted by, several other factors (n = 47 with p<0.05, n = 37 with p<0.01, n = 28 with p<0.001, n = 22 with p<0.0001). Both the number of factors associated with a given factor (1 to 9) and the strength of the associations (HRs from 1.10 to 6.12 in multivariable models) are very variable, suggesting that all the factors do not have the same influence within this network. These results show that there is a remarkably extensive network of relationships between the main CVD risk factors which may have not been sufficiently taken into account, notably in preventive strategies aiming to lower CVD risk."

Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the health care utilisation by age group, taking into account individual and regional factors. Zero-inflated Poisson regression model was used to predict the number of transitions.Mean age was 78.1 in men and 83.8 in women. In the last six months of life, 94.7% of the decedents had at least one consultation; 61.6% were hospitalised at least once, with a mean length of stay of 28.3 days; and nursing home stays were seen in 47.4% of the decedents. Over the same time period, 64.5% were transferred at least once, and 12.9% experienced at least one burdensome transition. Main predictors for transitions were age, sex and chronic conditions. A high density of home care nurses was associated with a decrease, whereas a high density of ambulatory care physicians was associated with an increase in the number of transitions.Health care utilisation was high in the last six months of life and a considerable number of decedents were being transferred. Advance care planning might prevent patients from numerous and particularly from burdensome transitions."
https://openalex.org/W2520665090,"Extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) are responsible for diverse infections including meningitis, sepsis and urinary tract infections. The alarming rise in anti-microbial resistance amongst ExPEC complicates treatment and has highlighted the need for alternative preventive measures. SslE is a lipoprotein secreted by a dedicated type II secretion system in E. coli that was first identified as a potential vaccine candidate using reverse genetics. Although the function and protective efficacy of SslE has been studied, the molecular mechanisms that regulate SslE expression remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we show that while the expression of SslE can be detected in E. coli culture supernatants, different strains express and secrete different amounts of SslE when grown under the same conditions. While the histone-like transcriptional regulator H-NS strongly represses sslE at ambient temperatures, the variation in SslE expression at human physiological temperature suggested a more complex mode of regulation. Using a genetic screen to identify novel regulators of sslE in the high SslE-expressing strain UTI89, we defined a new role for the nucleoid-associated regulator Fis and the ribosome-binding GTPase TypA as positive regulators of sslE transcription. We also showed that Fis-mediated enhancement of sslE transcription is dependent on a putative Fis-binding sequence located upstream of the -35 sequence in the core promoter element, and provide evidence to suggest that Fis may work in complex with H-NS to control SslE expression. Overall, this study has defined a new mechanism for sslE regulation and increases our understanding of this broadly conserved E. coli vaccine antigen."
https://openalex.org/W2529447822,"Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen, are among the most commonly used medications and produce their antiinflammatory effects by blocking cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. Their use is associated with increased risk of heart attacks caused by blocking COX-2 in the vasculature and/or kidney, with our recent work implicating the endogenous NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a cardiotoxic hormone whose effects can be prevented by L-arginine. The ibuprofen salt ibuprofen arginate (Spididol) was created to increase solubility but we suggest that it could also augment the NO pathway through codelivery of arginine. Here we investigated the idea that ibuprofen arginate can act to simultaneously inhibit COX-2 and preserve the NO pathway. Ibuprofen arginate functioned similarly to ibuprofen sodium for inhibition of mouse/human COX-2, but only ibuprofen arginate served as a substrate for NOS. Ibuprofen arginate but not ibuprofen sodiumalso reversed the inhibitory effects of ADMA and NG-nitro-L-argininemethyl ester on inducible NOS (macrophages) and endothelial NOS in vitro (aorta) and in vivo (blood pressure). These observations show that ibuprofen arginate provides, in one preparation, a COX-2 inhibitor and NOS substrate that could act to negate the harmful cardiovascular consequences mediated by blocking renal COX-2 and increased ADMA. While remarkably simple, our findings are potentially game-changing in the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug arena.—Kirkby, N. S., Tesfai, A., Ahmetaj-Shala, B., Gashaw, H.

We characterized factors associated with syphilis incidence, including reinfection, in a high-risk cohort in Peru. Methods Participants in the NIMH CPOL trial were assessed at baseline and 2 annual visits with HIV/STI testing and behavioral surveys. Participants diagnosed with syphilis also attended 4- and 9-month visits. All participants underwent syphilis testing with RPR screening and TPPA confirmation. Antibiotic treatment was provided according to CDC guidelines. Reinfection was defined as a 4-fold titer increase or recurrence of seroreactivity after successful treatment with subsequent negative RPR titers. The longitudinal analysis used a Possion generalized estimating equations model with backward selection of variables in the final model (criteria P <0.02). Results Of 2,709 participants, 191 (7.05%) were RPR-reactive (median 1:8, range 1:1–1:1024) with TPPA confirmation. There were 119 total cases of incident syphilis, which included both reinfection and first-time incident cases. In the bivariate analysis, the oldest 2 quartiles of age (incidence ratio (IR) 3.84; P <0.001 and IR 8.15; P <0.001) and being MSM/TW (IR 6.48; P <0.001) were associated with higher risk of incident syphilis infection. Of the sexual risk behaviors, older age of sexual debut (IR 12.53; P <0.001), not being in a stable partnership (IR 1.56, P = 0.035), higher number of sex partners (IR 3.01; P <0.001), unprotected sex in the past 3 months (IR 0.56; P = 0.003), HIV infection at baseline (IR 3.98; P <0.001) and incident HIV infection during the study period (IR 6.26; P = 0.003) were all associated with incident syphilis. In the multivariable analysis, older age group (adjusted incidence ratio (aIR) 6.18; P <0.001), men reporting having sex with a man (aIR 4.63; P <0.001), and incident HIV infection (aIR 4.48; P = 0.008) were significantly associated. Conclusions We report a high rate of syphilis reinfection among high-risk men who have evidence of previous syphilis infection. Our findings highlight the close relationship between HIV incidence with both incident syphilis and syphilis reinfection. Further studies on syphilis reinfection are needed to understand patterns of syphilis reinfection and new strategies beyond periodic testing of high-risk individuals based on HIV status are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2511687715,"Selective delivery of drugs to tumor cells can increase potency and reduce toxicity. In this study, we describe a novel recombinant chimeric protein, dsRBEC, which can bind polyIC and deliver it selectively into EGFR over-expressing tumor cells. dsRBEC, comprises the dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD) of human PKR (hPKR), which serves as the polyIC binding moiety, fused to human EGF (hEGF), the targeting moiety. dsRBEC shows high affinity towards EGFR and triggers ligand-induced endocytosis of the receptor, thus leading to the selective internalization of polyIC into EGFR over-expressing tumor cells. The targeted delivery of polyIC by dsRBEC induced cellular apoptosis and the secretion of IFN-β and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. dsRBEC-delivered polyIC is much more potent than naked polyIC and is expected to reduce the toxicity caused by systemic delivery of polyIC."
https://openalex.org/W2525240611,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by an inherited mutation in hemoglobin that leads to sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization and premature HbS denaturation. Previous publications have shown that HbS denaturation is followed by binding of denatured HbS (a.k.a. hemichromes) to band 3, the consequent clustering of band 3 in the plane of the erythrocyte membrane that in turn promotes binding of autologous antibodies to the clustered band 3, and removal of the antibody-coated erythrocytes from circulation. Although each step of the above process has been individually demonstrated, the fraction of band 3 that is altered by association with denatured HbS has never been determined. For this purpose, we evaluated the lateral diffusion of band 3 in normal cells, reversibly sickled cells (RSC), irreversibly sickled cells (ISC), and hemoglobin SC erythrocytes (HbSC) in order to estimate the fraction of band 3 that was diffusing more slowly due to hemichrome-induced clustering. We labeled fewer than ten band 3 molecules per intact erythrocyte with a quantum dot to avoid perturbing membrane structure and we then monitored band 3 lateral diffusion by single particle tracking. We report here that the size of the slowly diffusing population of band 3 increases in the sequence: normal cells<HbSC<RSC<ISC. We also demonstrate that the size of the compartment in which band 3 is free to diffuse decreases roughly in the same order, with band 3 diffusing in two compartments of sizes 35 and 71 nm in normal cells, but only a single compartment in HbSC cells (58 nm), RSC (45 nm) and ISC (36 nm). These data suggest that the mobility of band 3 is increasingly constrained during SCD progression, suggesting a global impact of the mutated hemoglobin on erythrocyte membrane properties."
https://openalex.org/W2528374905,"Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is essential for maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier. Absolute renal levels of VEGF-A change in patients with diabetic nephropathy and inflammatory kidney diseases, but whether changes in the renal splicing patterns of VEGF-A play a role remains unclear. In this study, we investigated mRNA splicing patterns of pro-angiogenic isoforms of VEGF-A in glomeruli and whole kidney samples from human patients with kidney disease and from mouse models of kidney disease. Kidney biopsies were obtained from patients with acute rejection following kidney transplantation, patients with diabetic nephropathy, and control subjects. In addition, kidney samples were obtained from mice with lupus nephritis, mice with diabetes mellitus, and control mice. The relative expression of each VEGF-A splice variant was measured using RT-PCR followed by quantitative fragment analysis. The pattern of renal VEGF-A splice variants was unchanged in diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis and was stable throughout disease progression in acute transplant rejection and diabetic nephropathy; these results suggest renal VEGF-A splicing stability during kidney disease. The splicing patterns were species-specific; in the control human kidney samples, VEGF-A 121 was the dominant isoform, whereas VEGF-A 164 was the dominant isoform measured in the mouse kidney samples."
https://openalex.org/W2518258943,"The cytoplasmic tail (gp41CT) of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) mediates Env incorporation into virions and regulates Env intracellular trafficking. Little is known about the functional impact of variability in this domain. To address this issue, we compared the replication of recombinant virus pairs carrying the full Env (Env viruses) or the Env ectodomain fused to the gp41CT of NL4.3 (EnvEC viruses) (12 subtype C and 10 subtype B pairs) in primary CD4+ T-cells and monocyte-derived-macrophages (MDMs). In CD4+ T-cells, replication was as follows: B-EnvEC = B-Env>C-EnvEC>C-Env, indicating that the gp41CT of subtype C contributes to the low replicative capacity of this subtype. In MDMs, in contrast, replication capacity was comparable for all viruses regardless of subtype and of gp41CT. In CD4+ T-cells, viral entry, viral release and viral gene expression were similar. However, infectivity of free virions and cell-to-cell transmission of C-Env viruses released by CD4+ T-cells was lower, suggestive of lower Env incorporation into virions. Subtype C matrix only minimally rescued viral replication and failed to restore infectivity of free viruses and cell-to-cell transmission. Taken together, these results show that polymorphisms in the gp41CT contribute to viral replication capacity and suggest that the number of Env spikes per virion may vary across subtypes. These findings should be taken into consideration in the design of vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2520517245,"Translational control is a strategy that various viruses use to manipulate their hosts to suppress acute antiviral response. Polydnaviruses, a group of insect double-stranded DNA viruses symbiotic to some endoparasitoid wasps, are divided into two genera: ichnovirus (IV) and bracovirus (BV). In IV, some Cys-motif genes are known as host translation-inhibitory factors (HTIF). The genome of endoparasitoid wasp Cotesia plutellae contains a Cys-motif gene (Cp-TSP13) homologous to an HTIF known as teratocyte-secretory protein 14 (TSP14) of Microplitis croceipes. Cp-TSP13 consists of 129 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 13.987 kDa and pI value of 7.928. Genomic DNA region encoding its open reading frame has three introns. Cp-TSP13 possesses six conserved cysteine residues as other Cys-motif genes functioning as HTIF. Cp-TSP13 was expressed in Plutella xylostella larvae parasitized by C. plutellae. C. plutellae bracovirus (CpBV) was purified and injected into non-parasitized P. xylostella that expressed Cp-TSP13. Cp-TSP13 was cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector and used to infect Sf9 cells to transiently express Cp-TSP13. The synthesized Cp-TSP13 protein was detected in culture broth. An overlaying experiment showed that the purified Cp-TSP13 entered hemocytes. It was localized in the cytosol. Recombinant Cp-TSP13 significantly inhibited protein synthesis of secretory proteins when it was added to in vitro cultured fat body. In addition, the recombinant Cp-TSP13 directly inhibited the translation of fat body mRNAs in in vitro translation assay using rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Moreover, the recombinant Cp-TSP13 significantly suppressed cellular immune responses by inhibiting hemocyte-spreading behavior. It also exhibited significant insecticidal activities by both injection and feeding routes. These results indicate that Cp-TSP13 is a viral HTIF."
https://openalex.org/W2512759098,"Antimicrobial peptides can be used as therapeutic agents against cancer cells. Warnericin RK and derivatives (WarnG20D and WarnF14V) were tested on various, solid tumor or leukemia, cancer cells. These peptides appeared to be cytotoxic on all the cell types tested, cancerous as well healthy, but very interestingly displayed no deleterious effect on healthy mononuclear cells. The mode of action of the peptide was proposed to be membranolytic, using chemical Raman imaging. Addition of peptide induced a large disorganization of the membrane leading to the loss of the content of inner compartments of Jurkat cell, whereas no effect was observed on the healthy mononuclear cells. The less hemolytic peptides WarnG20D and WarnF14V could be good candidates for the leukemia treatment."
