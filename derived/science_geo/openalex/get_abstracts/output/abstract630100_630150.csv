https://openalex.org/W2078908361,"Background Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in childhood worldwide, and causes significant impairments in overall functioning. In order to develop effective prevention and intervention programs, knowledge of the determinants that have an impact on the onset and development of ADHD symptoms is essential. So far, little is known about factors affecting ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents over time. Therefore, this study investigates potential psychosocial risk and protective factors for ADHD symptoms based on cross-sectional and longitudinal data of a German population-based study. Methods Data on children and adolescents (n = 1,384 aged 11 to 17 years) were collected at three measurement points (baseline, 1-year and 2-year follow-ups) covering a period of two years. We used latent growth modelling to investigate effects of parental mental health problems (risk factor) and self-efficacy, family climate and social support (protective factors) on symptoms of ADHD based on cross-sectional as well as longitudinal data. Sociodemographic factors, pre- and postnatal factors, and comorbid symptoms of internalizing and externalizing mental health problems were considered as covariates. Results At baseline, male gender, younger age, stronger aggressive behavior, and stronger parental mental health problems were related to more ADHD symptoms. Longitudinal analyses showed that female gender, migration status, increasing symptoms of generalized anxiety, increasing aggressive behavior and increasing parental mental health problems were associated with stronger increase of ADHD symptoms over time. However, improving family climate was related to decreasing ADHD symptoms over time. We further found moderator effects for social support. Conclusion The findings of the study provide important information concerning risk and protective factors in the context of ADHD. Hence, the results may be integrated into the planning and implementation of future prevention and early intervention strategies that target affected children and adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W2943735948,"Computer-aided polyp detection in gastric gastroscopy has been the subject of research over the past few decades. However, despite significant advances, automatic polyp detection in real time is still an unsolved problem. In this paper, we report on a convolutional neural network (CNN) for polyp detection that is constructed based on Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) architecture and which we call SSD for Gastric Polyps (SSD-GPNet). To take full advantages of feature maps' information from the feature pyramid and to acquire higher accuracy, we re-use information that is abandoned by Max-Pooling layers. In other words, we reuse the lost data from the pooling layers and concatenate that data as extra feature maps to contribute to classification and detection. Meanwhile, in the feature pyramid, we concatenate feature maps of the lower layers and feature maps that are deconvolved from upper layers to make explicit relationships between layers and to effectively increase the number of channels. The results show that our enhanced SSD for gastric polyp detection can realize real-time polyp detection with 50 frames per second (FPS) and can improve the mean average precision (mAP) from 88.5% to 90.4%, with only a little loss in time-performance. And the further experiment shows that SSD-GPNet has excellent performance in improving polyp detection recalls over 10% (p = 0.00053), especially in small polyp detection. This can help endoscopic physicians more easily find missed polyps and decrease the gastric polyp miss rate. It may be applicable in daily clinical practice to reduce the burden on physicians."
https://openalex.org/W2943263503,"Tumour cell immune evasion is a principal hallmark of successful metastasis. Tumour cells in the vasculature adopt a platelet cloak that efficiently suppresses the innate immune system by directly inhibiting Natural Killer (NK) cells, which normally function to neutralise spreading cancers. Here we describe two novel mechanisms of tumour cell evasion of NK cell anti-tumour functions. The first, an ‘immune decoy’ mechanism in which platelets induce the release of soluble NKG2D ligands from the tumour cell to mask detection and actively suppress NK cell degranulation and inflammatory cytokine (IFNγ) production, concomitantly. This represents a double-hit to immune clearance of malignant cells during metastasis. The second mechanism, a platelet-derived TGFβ-mediated suppression of the CD226/CD96-CD112/CD155 axis, is a novel pathway with poorly understood anti-cancer functions. We have demonstrated that platelets robustly suppress surface expression of CD226 and CD96 on the NK cell surface and their associated ligands on the tumour cell to further enhance NK cell suppression. These highly evolved mechanisms promote successful tumour immune evasion during metastasis and provide a unique opportunity for studying the complexity of cellular interactions in the metastatic cascade and thus novel targets for cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2970935231,"Between 2013 and 2017, targeted malaria elimination (TME), a package of interventions that includes mass drug administration (MDA)-was piloted in communities with reservoirs of asymptomatic P. falciparum across the Greater Mekong sub-Region (GMS). Coverage in target communities is a key determinant of the effectiveness of MDA. Drawing on mixed methods research conducted alongside TME pilot studies, this article examines the impact of the community engagement, local social context and study design on MDA coverage.Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using questionnaire-based surveys, semi-structured and in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, informal conversations, and observations of study activities. Over 1500 respondents were interviewed in Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. Interview topics included attitudes to malaria and experiences of MDA. Overall coverage of mass anti-malarial administration was high, particularly participation in at least a single round (85%). Familiarity with and concern about malaria prompted participation in MDA; as did awareness of MDA and familiarity with the aim of eliminating malaria. Fear of adverse events and blood draws discouraged people. Hence, community engagement activities sought to address these concerns but their impact was mediated by the trust relationships that study staff could engender in communities. In contexts of weak healthcare infrastructure and (cash) poverty, communities valued the study's ancillary care and the financial compensation. However, coverage did not necessarily decrease in the absence of cash compensation. Community dynamics, affected by politics, village conformity, and household decision-making also affected coverage.The experimental nature of TME presented particular challenges to achieving high coverage. Nonetheless, the findings reflect those from studies of MDA under implementation conditions and offer useful guidance for potential regional roll-out of MDA: it is key to understand target communities and provide appropriate information in tailored ways, using community engagement that engenders trust."
https://openalex.org/W2949453164,"The Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) causes tuberculosis (TB) in humans and various other mammals. The human-adapted members of the MTBC comprise seven phylogenetic lineages that differ in their geographical distribution. There is growing evidence that this phylogeographic diversity modulates the outcome of TB infection and disease. For decades, TB research and development has focused on the two canonical MTBC laboratory strains H37Rv and Erdman, both of which belong to Lineage 4. Relying on only a few laboratory-adapted strains can be misleading as study results might not be directly transferrable to clinical settings where patients are infected with a diverse array of strains, including drug-resistant variants. Here, we argue for the need to expand TB research and development by incorporating the phylogenetic diversity of the MTBC. To facilitate such work, we have assembled a group of 20 genetically well-characterized clinical strains representing the seven known human-adapted MTBC lineages. With the “MTBC clinical strains reference set” we aim to provide a standardized resource for the TB community. We hope it will enable more direct comparisons between studies that explore the physiology of MTBC beyond the laboratory strains used thus far. We anticipate that detailed phenotypic analyses of this reference strain set will increase our understanding of TB biology and assist in the development of new control tools that are broadly effective."

A major contributing factor to diabetes is unhealthy dietary behaviour. We conducted 38 semi structured interviews with patients, health professionals, policy-makers and researchers in Kathmandu, Nepal, to better understand the determinants of dietary behaviour amongst patients with diabetes and high blood glucose levels. We created a social ecological model which is specific to socio-cultural context with our findings with the aim of informing culturally appropriate dietary behaviour interventions for improving dietary behaviour. Our findings show that the most influential determinants of dietary behaviour include cultural practices (gender roles relating to cooking), social support (from family and friends), the political and physical environment (political will, healthy food availability) and individuals’ motivations and capabilities. Using these most influential determinants, we suggest potentially effective dietary interventions that could be implemented by policy makers. Our findings emphasise the importance of considering socio-cultural context in developing interventions and challenges one-size-fits-all approaches which are often encouraged by global guidelines. We demonstrate how multifaceted and multi layered models of behavioural influence can be used to develop policy and practice with the aim of reducing mortality and morbidity from diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2952178500,"In higher eukaryotes, gene architecture and structural properties of promoters have emerged as significant factors influencing variation in number of transcripts (expression level) and specificity of gene expression in a tissue (expression breadth), which eventually shape the phenotype. In this study, transcriptome data of different tissue types at various developmental stages of A. thaliana, O. sativa, S. bicolor and Z. mays have been used to understand the relationship between properties of gene components and its expression. Our findings indicate that in plants, among all gene architecture and structural properties of promoters, compactness of genes in terms of intron content is significantly linked to gene expression level and breadth, whereas in human an exactly opposite scenario is seen. In plants, for the first time we have carried out a quantitative estimation of effect of a particular trait on expression level and breadth, by using multiple regression analysis and it confirms that intron content of primary transcript (as %) is a powerful determinant of expression breadth. Similarly, further regression analysis revealed that among structural properties of the promoters, stability is negatively linked to expression breadth, while DNase1 sensitivity strongly governs gene expression breadth in monocots and gene expression level in dicots. In addition, promoter regions of tissue specific genes are found to be enriched with TATA box and Y-patch motifs. Finally, multi copy orthologous genes in plants are found to be longer, highly regulated and tissue specific."
https://openalex.org/W2935783037,"Introduction Accelerating progress in reducing child deaths is needed in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal child mortality target. This will require a focus on vulnerable children–including young children, those who are undernourished or with acute illnesses requiring hospitalization. Improving adherence to inpatient guidelines may be an important strategy to reduce child mortality, including among the most vulnerable. The aim of our assessment of nine sub-Saharan African and South Asian hospitals was to determine adherence to pediatric inpatient care recommendations, in addition to capacity for and barriers to implementation of guideline-adherent care prior to commencing the Childhood Acute Illness and Nutrition (CHAIN) Cohort study. The CHAIN Cohort study aims to identify modifiable risk factors for poor inpatient and post discharge outcomes above and beyond implementation of guidelines. Methods Hospital infrastructure, staffing, durable equipment, and consumable supplies such as medicines and laboratory reagents, were evaluated through observation and key informant interviews. Inpatient medical records of 2–23 month old children were assessed for adherence to national and international guidelines. The records of children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) were oversampled to reflect the CHAIN study population. Seven core adherence indicators were examined: oximetry and oxygen therapy, fluids, anemia diagnosis and transfusion, antibiotics, malaria testing and antimalarials, nutritional assessment and management, and HIV testing. Results All sites had facilities and equipment necessary to implement care consistent with World Health Organization and national guidelines. However, stockouts of essential medicines and laboratory reagents were reported to be common at some sites, even though they were mostly present during the assessment visits. Doctor and nurse to patient ratios varied widely. We reviewed the notes of 261 children with admission diagnoses of sepsis (17), malaria (47), pneumonia (70), diarrhea (106), and SAM (119); 115 had multiple diagnoses. Adherence to oxygen therapy, antimalarial, and malnutrition refeeding guidelines was >75%. Appropriate antimicrobials were prescribed for 75% of antibiotic-indicative conditions. However, 20/23 (87%) diarrhea and 20/27 (74%) malaria cases without a documented indication were prescribed antibiotics. Only 23/122 (19%) with hemoglobin levels meeting anemia criteria had recorded anemia diagnoses. HIV test results were infrequently documented even at hospitals with universal screening policies (66/173, 38%). Informants at all sites attributed inconsistent guideline implementation to inadequate staffing. Conclusion Assessed hospitals had the infrastructure and equipment to implement guideline-consistent care. While fluids, appropriate antimalarials and antibiotics, and malnutrition refeeding adherence was comparable to published estimates from low- and high-resource settings, there were inconsistencies in implementation of some other recommendations. Stockouts of essential therapeutics and laboratory reagents were a noted barrier, but facility staff perceived inadequate human resources as the primary constraint to consistent guideline implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2923394558,"Osteoglossiformes represents one of the most ancestral teleost lineages, currently widespread over almost all continents, except for Antarctica. However, data involving advanced molecular cytogenetics or comparative genomics are yet largely limited for this fish group. Therefore, the present investigations focus on the osteoglossiform family Arapaimidae, studying a unique fish model group with advanced molecular cytogenetic genomic tools. The aim is to better explore and clarify certain events and factors that had impact on evolutionary history of this fish group. For that, both South American and African representatives of Arapaimidae, namely Arapaima gigas and Heterotis niloticus, were examined. Both species differed markedly by diploid chromosome numbers, with 2n = 56 found in A. gigas and 2n = 40 exhibited by H. niloticus. Conventional cytogenetics along with fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed some general trends shared by most osteoglossiform species analyzed thus far, such as the presence of only one chromosome pair bearing 18S and 5S rDNA sites and karyotypes dominated by acrocentric chromosomes, resembling thus the patterns of hypothetical ancestral teleost karyotype. Furthermore, the genomes of A. gigas and H. niloticus display remarkable divergence in terms of repetitive DNA content and distribution, as revealed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). On the other hand, genomic diversity of single copy sequences studied through principal component analyses (PCA) based on SNP alleles genotyped by the DArT seq procedure demonstrated a very low genetic distance between the South American and African Arapaimidae species; this pattern contrasts sharply with the scenario found in other osteoglossiform species. Underlying evolutionary mechanisms potentially explaining the obtained data have been suggested and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2964840263,"Due to the ability of soil bacteria to solubilize minerals, fix N2 and mobilize nutrients entrapped in the organic matter, their role in nutrient turnover and plant fitness is of high relevance in forest ecosystems. Although several authors have already studied the organic matter decomposing enzymes produced by soil and plant root-interacting bacteria, most of the works did not account for the activity of cell wall-attached enzymes. Therefore, the enzyme deployment strategy of three bacterial collections (genera Luteibacter, Pseudomonas and Arthrobacter) associated with Quercus spp. roots was investigated by exploring both cell-bound and freely-released hydrolytic enzymes. We also studied the potential of these bacterial collections to produce enzymes involved in the transformation of plant and fungal biomass. Remarkably, the cell-associated enzymes accounted for the vast majority of the total activity detected among Luteibacter strains, suggesting that they could have developed a strategy to maintain the decomposition products in their vicinity, and therefore to reduce the diffusional losses of the products. The spectrum of the enzymes synthesized and the titres of activity were diverse among the three bacterial genera. While cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes were rather common among Luteibacter and Pseudomonas strains and less detected in Arthrobacter collection, the activity of lipase was widespread among all the tested strains. Our results indicate that a large fraction of the extracellular enzymatic activity is due to cell wall-attached enzymes for some bacteria, and that Quercus spp. root bacteria could contribute at different levels to carbon (C), phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) cycles."
https://openalex.org/W2942951865,"Watson for oncology (WFO) is a cognitive computing system providing decision support. We evaluated the concordance rates between the treatment options determined by WFO and those determined by a multidisciplinary team (MDT).We reviewed the medical charts of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer who visited the MDT at a single tertiary medical center from November 2016 to April 2017. WFO classified the treatment options for specific patients into three categories: 'Recommended', 'For consideration', and 'Not recommended'. Concordance rates between the WFO- and MDT-determined chemotherapy options, and the factors that potentially influence the concordance rate, were analyzed.Sixty-nine patients with colorectal cancer met with the MDT from Nov. 2016 to Feb. 2017. The mean age of the patients was 62 years (range: 34-86 years), and more patients were male (47/69) than female. Of the 69 patients, 51 (73.9%) were diagnosed with colon cancer, of whom 46.4% received the same regimen recommendation from WFO ('Recommended') as they did from the MDT. After inclusion of the 'For consideration' category from WFO, the concordance rate increased to 87.0%. The concordance rate between MDT and NCCN guidelines was 97.1%, and that between the WFO and NCCN guidelines was 88.4%. The concordance rates between WFO and MDT were significantly lower in patients with stage II, IIIC, or IV disease (P<0.001), and the colorectal cancer stage was the only statistically significant factor discriminating between WFO and MDT.The concordance rate between chemotherapy regimens for colorectal cancer determined by MDT versus WFO recommendations was 46.4%. After including the 'For consideration' category from WFO, the concordance rate increased to 88.4%. Further modification and improvement of the WFO prioritizing algorithm used to recommend treatment may increase the usefulness of WFO in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2942840449,"To study whether low dietary magnesium (Mg) intake and serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) predict the development of clinical knee osteoarthritis (OA).The cohort consisted of 4,953 participants of a national health examination survey who were free of knee and hip OA at baseline. Information on the incidence of knee OA leading to hospitalization was drawn from the National Care Register for Health Care. During the follow-up of 10 years, 123 participants developed incident knee OA. Dietary magnesium intake was assessed on the basis of a food frequency questionnaire from the preceding year. We used Cox's proportional hazards model to estimate the strength of the association between the tertiles of dietary Mg intake and incident knee OA, adjusted for baseline age, gender, energy intake, BMI, history of physical workload, leisure time physical activity, injuries, knee complaints, the use of Mg supplements, and serum hs-CRP levels.At baseline, dietary Mg intake was inversely associated with serum hs-CRP even after adjustment for all the potential confounding factors. During the follow-up, the adjusted hazard ratios (with their 95% confidence intervals) for incident knee OA in dietary Mg intake tertiles were 1.00, 1.28 (0.78-2.10), and 1.38 (0.73-2.62); the p value for trend was 0.31. Serum hs-CRP level at baseline did not predict incident knee OA.The results do not support the hypothesis that low dietary Mg intake contributes to the development of clinical knee OA, although Mg intake is inversely associated with serum hs-CRP level."
https://openalex.org/W3022966275,"Sulforaphane is a new and effective anti-cancer component that is abundant in broccoli. In the past few years, the patterns of variability in glucosinolate content and its regulation in A. thaliana have been described in detail. However, the diversity of glucosinolate and sulforaphane contents in different organs during vegetative and reproductive stages has not been clearly explained. In this paper, we firstly investigated the transcriptome profiles of the developing buds and leaves at bolting stage of broccoli (B52) to further assess the gene expression patterns involved in sulforaphane synthesis. The CYP79F1 gene, as well as nine other genes related to glucorahpanin biosynthesis, MAM1, MAM3, St5b-2, FMO GS-OX1, MY, AOP2, AOP3, ESP and ESM1 were selected by digital gene expression analysis and were validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Meanwhile, the compositions of glucosinolates and sulforaphane were detected for correlation analysis with related genes. Finally the RNA sequencing libraries generated 147 957 344 clean reads, and 8 539 unigene assemblies were produced. In digital result, only CYP79F1, in the glucoraphanin pathway, was up-regulated in young buds but absent from the other organs, which was consistent with the highest level of sulforaphane content being in this organ compared to mature buds, buds one day before flowering, flowers and leaves. The sequencing results also presented that auxin and cytokinin might affect glucoraphanin accumulation. The study revealed that up-regulated expression of CYP79F1 plays a fundamental and direct role in sulforaphane production in inflorescences. Two genes of MAM1 and St5b-2 could up-regulated glucoraphanin generation. Synergistic expression of MAM1, MAM3, St5b-2, FMO GS-OX1, MY, ESP and ESM1 was found in sulforaphane metabolism. This study will be beneficial for understanding the diversity of sulforaphane in broccoli organs."
https://openalex.org/W2949539950,"To determine the target of the recently identified lead compound NSC130362 that is responsible for its selective anti-cancer efficacy and safety in normal cells, structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies were conducted. First, NSC13062 was validated as a starting compound for the described SAR studies in a variety of cell-based viability assays. Then, a small library of 1,4-naphthoquinines (1,4-NQs) and quinoline-5,8-diones was tested in cell viability assays using pancreatic cancer MIA PaCa-2 cells and normal human hepatocytes. The obtained data allowed us to select a set of both non-toxic compounds that preferentially induced apoptosis in cancer cells and toxic compounds that induced apoptosis in both cancer and normal cells. Anti-cancer activity of the selected non-toxic compounds was confirmed in viability assays using breast cancer HCC1187 cells. Consequently, the two sets of compounds were tested in multiple cell-based and in vitro activity assays to identify key factors responsible for the observed activity. Inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain (ETC) is a key distinguishing activity between the non-toxic and toxic compounds. Finally, we developed a mathematical model that was able to distinguish these two sets of compounds. The development of this model supports our conclusion that appropriate quantitative SAR (QSAR) models have the potential to be employed to develop anti-cancer compounds with improved potency while maintaining non-toxicity to normal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2944021611,"In vitro multi-electrode array (MEA) technology is nowadays involved in a wide range of applications beyond neuroscience, such as cardiac electrophysiology and bio-interface studies. However, the cost of commercially available acquisition systems severely limits its adoption outside specialized laboratories with high budget capabilities. Thus, the availability of low-cost methods to acquire signals from MEAs is important to allow research labs worldwide to exploit this technology for an ever-expanding pool of experiments independently from their economic possibilities. Here, we provide a comprehensive toolset to assemble a multifunctional in vitro MEA acquisition system with a total cost 80% lower than standard commercial solutions. We demonstrate the capabilities of this acquisition system by employing it to i) characterize commercial MEA devices by means of electrical impedance measurements ii) record activity from cultures of HL-1 cells extracellularly, and iii) electroporate HL-1 cells through nanostructured MEAs and record intracellular signals."
https://openalex.org/W2899766107,"Natural resource rules exist to control resources and the people that interact with them. These rules often fail because people do not comply with them. Decisions to comply with natural resource rules often are based on attitudes about legitimacy of rules and the perceived risks of breaking rules. Trust in agencies promulgating rules in part may determine perceptions of legitimacy of the rule, and in turn depends on individuals' trust in different agency actors. The purpose of this research is to explore the relationship between fishing rule noncompliance and trust in scientists, a key group within management agencies. We interviewed 41 individuals in one rural fishing community in the Brazilian Pantanal from April to August, 2016, to assess (1) noncompliance rates, (2) noncompliance-related attitudes, and (3) the relationship between trust in scientists and noncompliance decisions in the region. We found that among study participants, noncompliance was common and overt. Trust in scientists performing research in the region was the best predictor of noncompliance rate with a fishing rule (nonparametric rank correlation ρ = -0.717; Probit model pseudo-R2 = 0.241). Baseline data from this research may help inform future interventions to minimize IUU fishing and protect the Pantanal fishery. Although our results are specific to one community in the Pantanal, trust in scientists is potentially an important factor for compliance decisions in similar situations around the world. These results build not only on compliance theory but also speak to the important role that many scientists play in rural areas where they conduct their research."
https://openalex.org/W2936672225,"Mild cognitive impairment is common in chronic HIV infection and there is concern that it may worsen with age. Distinguishing static impairment from on-going decline is clinically important, but the field lacks well-validated cognitive measures sensitive to decline and feasible for routine clinical use. Measures capable of detecting improvement are also needed to assess interventions. The objective of this study is to estimate the extent of change on repeat administration of three different forms of a brief computerized cognitive assessment battery (B-CAM) developed for assessing cognitive ability in the mildly-impaired to normal range in people living with HIV. We hypothesized no change over a six-month period in people on effective antiretroviral therapy.102 HIV+ individuals completed a set of computerized cognitive tasks on three occasions over a six-month period. Rasch analysis was used to determine if change over time (i.e. improvement due to practice) was uniform across tasks and to refine scoring in order to produce three forms of the B-CAM of equivalent level of difficulty. Group-based trajectory analysis (GBTA) was then applied to determine if performance at baseline influenced the magnitude of practice-related improvement on the battery as a whole over the course of follow-up.Two cognitive tasks (fluency and word recall) had different levels of difficulty across test sessions, related to the different forms of the tasks. These two items were split by testing session. For all other items, the level of difficulty remained constant across all three time points. GBTA showed that the sample was composed of three distinct groups of people with unique trajectories, defined mainly by level of cognitive ability at baseline. Only the highest group showed an apparent improvement over time, but this change fell within measurement error.Rasch analysis provides mathematical confirmation that these three forms of the B-CAM are of equivalent difficulty. GBTA demonstrates that no adjustment of the total score is required to correct for practice effects. Application of these modern statistical methods paves the way towards rapid and robust quantification of change in cognition."
https://openalex.org/W2946436458,"Purpose of this work was to assess feasibility of cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) at 7 T in a set of healthy, unfixed, porcine hearts using various parallel imaging acceleration factors and to compare SNR and derived cDTI metrics to a reference measured at 3 T. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 7T and 3T whole body systems using a spin echo diffusion encoding sequence with echo planar imaging readout. Five reference (b = 0 s/mm2) images and 30 diffusion directions (b = 700 s/mm2) were acquired at both 7 T and 3 T using a GRAPPA acceleration factor R = 1. Scans at 7 T were repeated using R = 2, R = 3, and R = 4. SNR evaluation was based on 30 reference (b = 0 s/mm2) images of 30 slices of the left ventricle and cardiac DTI metrics were compared within AHA segmentation. The number of hearts scanned at 7 T and 3 T was n = 11. No statistically significant differences were found for evaluated helix angle, secondary eigenvector angle, fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient at the different field strengths, given sufficiently high SNR and geometrically undistorted images. R≥3 was needed to reduce susceptibility induced geometric distortions to an acceptable amount. On average SNR in myocardium of the left ventricle was increased from 29±3 to 44±6 in the reference image (b = 0 s/mm2) when switching from 3 T to 7 T. Our study demonstrates that high resolution, ex vivo cDTI is feasible at 7 T using commercial hardware."
https://openalex.org/W2982309584,"Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate and quantify the effect of improved attenuation correction (AC) including bone segmentation and truncation correction on 18F-Fluordesoxyglucose cardiac positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging. Methods PET data of 32 cardiac PET/MR datasets were reconstructed with three different AC-maps (1. Dixon-VIBE only, 2. HUGE truncation correction and bone segmentation, 3. MLAA). The Dixon-VIBE AC-maps served as reference of reconstructed PET data. 17-segment short-axis polar plots of the left ventricle were analyzed regarding the impact of each of the three AC methods on PET quantification in cardiac PET/MR imaging. Non-AC PET images were segmented to specify the amount of truncation in the Dixon-VIBE AC-map serving as a reference. All AC-maps were evaluated for artifacts. Results Using HUGE + bone AC results in a homogeneous gain of ca. 6% and for MLAA 8% of PET signal distribution across the myocardium of the left ventricle over all patients compared to Dixon-VIBE AC only. Maximal relative differences up to 18% were observed in segment 17 (apex). The body volume truncation of -12.7 ± 7.1% compared to the segmented non-AC PET images using the Dixon-VIBE AC method was reduced to -1.9 ± 3.9% using HUGE and 7.8 ± 8.3% using MLAA. In each patient, a systematic overestimation in AC-map volume was observed when applying MLAA. Quantitative impact of artifacts showed regional differences up to 6% within single segments of the myocardium. Conclusions Improved AC including bone segmentation and truncation correction in cardiac PET/MR imaging is important to ensure best possible diagnostic quality and PET quantification. The results exhibited an overestimation of AC-map volume using MLAA, while HUGE resulted in a more realistic body contouring. Incorporation of bone segmentation into the Dixon-VIBE AC-map resulted in homogeneous gain in PET signal distribution across the myocardium. The majority of observed AC-map artifacts did not significantly affect the quantitative assessment of the myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W2942789718,"Older adults' discussions with family, or with physicians, or with both, about advance care planning (ACP) are increasingly regarded as important for the management of end-of-life care, and yet the factors that induce older adults to engage in ACP discussions are poorly understood. For example, in older adults, is stronger connectedness with family and friends (stronger ""networks"") associated with ACP discussions? By facilitating, or by impeding ACP discussions? We sought to evaluate the associations between ACP discussions and social networks in Japanese older adults.In July 2016 we conducted a cross-sectional survey on 355 community-dwelling patients aged ≥65 years visiting community hospital clinics in Fukushima, Japan. We used the Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-6, the shortest available LSNS scale) to assess social networks and recorded two components of social network structure, marital status (dichotomized as ""married"" vs. ""single / other"") and living status (""living with others"" vs. ""living alone""). One item asked if patients had had ACP discussions. We analyzed the LSNS-6 social network and marital and living status data in relation to the occurrence of ACP discussions using multiple logistic regression models with adjustments for possible confounding factors.Respondents' social network was ""limited"" in 16% of cases; 61% had had ACP discussions. Respondents with a limited social network had a significantly lower tendency to have had ACP discussions than respondents with an ""adequate"" social network (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.18-0.66; P < 0.001). Marital status and living status were not significantly associated with ACP discussion.Among Japanese older adults, weaker social networks may be associated with a lower tendency to discuss ACP. Our findings may help practitioners to quickly screen populations at risk for inadequate ACP discussion by using the LSNS-6."
https://openalex.org/W2945934135,"Grain-size is one of the yield components, and the first 14 days after pollination (DAP) is a crucial stage for wheat grain-size formation. To understand the mechanism of grain-size formation at the whole gene expression level and to identify the candidate genes related to grain pattern formation, cDNA libraries from immature grains of 5 DAP and 14 DAP were constructed. According to transcriptome analysis, a total of 12,555 new genes and 9,358 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained. In DEGs, 2,876, 3,357 and 3,125 genes were located on A, B and D subgenome respectively. 9,937 (79.15%) new genes and 9,059 (96.80%) DEGs were successfully annotated. For DEGs, 4,453 were up-regulated and 4,905 were down-regulated at 14 DAP. The Gene Ontology (GO) database indicated that most of the grain-size-related genes were in the same cluster. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database analysis showed that 130, 129 and 20 DEGs were respectively involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Expression levels of 8 randomly selected genes were confirmed by qRT-PCR, which was consistent with the transcriptome data. The present database will help us understand the molecular mechanisms underlying early grain development and provide the foundation for increasing grain-size and yield in wheat breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2979205798,"Autophagy is involved in cellular homeostasis and maintenance and may play a role in cardiometabolic health. We aimed to elucidate the role of autophagy in cardiometabolic traits by investigating genetic variants and DNA methylation in autophagy-related genes in relation to cardiovascular diseases and related traits. To address this research question, we implemented a multidirectional approach using several molecular epidemiology tools, including genetic association analysis with genome wide association studies data and exome sequencing data and differential DNA methylation analysis. We investigated the 21 autophagy-related genes in relation to coronary artery disease and a number of cardiometabolic traits (blood lipids, blood pressure, glycemic traits, type 2 diabetes). We used data from the largest genome wide association studies as well as DNA methylation and exome sequencing data from the Rotterdam Study. Single-nucleotide polymorphism rs110389913 in AMBRA1 (p-value = 4.9×10−18) was associated with blood proinsulin levels, whereas rs6587988 in ATG4C and rs10439163 in ATG4D with lipid traits (ATG4C: p-value = 2.5×10−15 for total cholesterol and p-value = 3.1×10−18 for triglycerides, ATG4D: p-value = 9.9×10−12 for LDL and p-value = 1.3×10−10 for total cholesterol). Moreover, rs7635838 in ATG7 was associated with HDL (p-value = 1.9×10−9). Rs2447607 located in ATG7 showed association with systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure. Rs2424994 in MAP1LC3A was associated with coronary artery disease (p-value = 5.8×10−6). Furthermore, we identified association of an exonic variant located in ATG3 with diastolic blood pressure (p-value = 6.75×10−6). Using DNA methylation data, two CpGs located in ULK1 (p-values = 4.5×10−7 and 1×10−6) and two located in ATG4B (2×10−13 and 1.48×10−7) were significantly associated with both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In addition one CpG in ATG4D was associated with HDL (p-value = 3.21×10−5). Our findings provide support for the role of autophagy in glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as blood pressure regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2925037156,"This article discusses the open-identity label, i.e., the practice of disclosing reviewers' names in published scholarly books, a common practice in Central and Eastern European countries. This study's objective is to verify whether the open-identity label is a type of peer-review label (like those used in Finland and Flanders, i.e., the Flemish part of Belgium), and as such, whether it can be used as a delineation criterion in various systems used to evaluate scholarly publications. We have conducted a two-phase sequential explanatory study. In the first phase, interviews with 20 of the 40 largest Polish publishers of scholarly books were conducted to investigate how Polish publishers control peer reviews and whether the open-identity label can be used to identify peer-reviewed books. In the other phase, two questionnaires were used to analyze perceptions of peer-review and open-identity labelling among authors (n = 600) and reviewers (n = 875) of books published by these 20 publishers. Integrated results allowed us to verify publishers' claims concerning their peer-review practices. Our findings reveal that publishers actually control peer reviews by providing assessment criteria to reviewers and sending reviews to authors. Publishers rarely ask for permission to disclose reviewers' names, but it is obvious to reviewers that this practice of disclosing names is part of peer reviewing. This study also shows that only the names of reviewers who accepted manuscripts for publication are disclosed. Thus, most importantly, our analysis shows that the open-identity label that Polish publishers use is a type of peer-review label like those used in Flanders and Finland, and as such, it can be used to identify peer-reviewed scholarly books."
https://openalex.org/W2996199462,"Dengue virus (DENV) transmission by blood transfusion is an important route of viral acquisition during outbreaks. The prevalence of DENV markers (viral RNA, NS1, anti-DENV IgM, and IgG) among blood donors in Central-West Brazil has never been evaluated. Our aim was to evaluate the full set of serological and molecular markers for DENV among blood donors of the Federal District of Brazil during an extensive outbreak in 2016. We found an anti-DENV IgM prevalence of 6.74% (n = 32/475). Of 475, 20 samples (4.21%) were also anti-DENV IgG positive. All samples were non-reactive for NS1 and DENV RNA. Our results imply that a significant proportion of the tested donors had experienced asymptomatic infection. More studies are necessary to evaluate the real prevalence of DENV viremia in blood donors from the Federal District of Brazil and if specific measures are needed to routinely test the blood donors for DENV RNA during outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2938129982,"Background Studies on adults have reported inverse association between the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) of adiponectin (HOMA-Adiponectin) and the insulin resistance assessed by the glucose clamp technique. To our knowledge, in the pediatric population this association has not been previously investigated. Objectives To evaluate the association between the HOMA-Adiponectin and the insulin resistance assessed by the glucose clamp technique in adolescents, and to compare the accuracy of HOMA-Adiponectin and HOMA-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) for identifying insulin resistance. Methods This was a cross-sectional study of 56 adolescents (aged 10–18 years). Insulin resistance was assessed using the HOMA-IR, HOMA-Adiponectin and the hyperglycaemic clamp technique. The clamp-derived insulin sensitivity index, HOMA-Adiponectin, and HOMA-IR were log-transformed to get closer to a normal distribution before analysis. Results In the multivariable linear regression analysis controlling for sex and Tanner stage, HOMA-Adiponectin was inversely associated with the clamp-derived insulin sensitivity index (unstandardized coefficient [B] = -0.441; P < 0.001). After additional adjustment for waist circumference-to-height ratio, this association remained significant (B = -0.349; P = < 0.001). Similar results were observed when HOMA-IR replaced HOMA-Adiponectin in the model (B = -1.049 and B = -0.968 after additional adjustment for waist circumference-to-height ratio); all P < 0.001. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting insulin resistance was 0.712 (P = 0.02) for HOMA-Adiponectin and 0.859 (P < 0.0001) HOMA-IR. Conclusions The HOMA-Adiponectin was independently associated with insulin resistance and exhibited a good discriminatory power for predicting it. However, it did not show superiority over HOMA-IR in the diagnostic accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2990469303,"Introduction Mozambique has made significant gains in addressing its HIV epidemic, yet adherence to visit schedules remains a challenge. HIV programmatic gains to date could be impaired if adherence and retention to ART remains low. We investigate individual factors associated with non-adherence to ART pick-up in Mozambique. Methods This was a retrospective cohort of patients initiating ART between January 2013 and June 2014. Non-adherence to ART pick-up was defined as a delay in pick-up ≥ 15 days. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. Adherence to ART pick-up was assessed using Kaplan Meier estimates. Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine factors associated with non-adherence. Results 1,413 participants were included (77% female). Median age was 30.4 years. 19% of patients remained adherent to ART pick-up during the evaluation period, while 81% of patients were non-adherent to ART pick-up. Probability of being non-adherent to ART pick-up by 166 days following initiation was 50%. In univariate analysis, being widowed was associated with higher adherence to ART pick-up than other marital status groups (p = 0.01). After adjusting, being ≥35 years (aHR: 0.843, 95% CI: 0.738–0.964, p = 0.012); receiving efavirenz (aHR: 0.932, 95% CI: 0.875–0.992, p = 0.026); and being urban (aHR: 0.754, 95% CI: 0.661–0.861, p<0.0001) were associated with improved adherence. Non-participation in a Community ART Support Group (CASG) was associated with a 43% increased hazard of non-adherence to ART pick-up (aHR 1.431, 1.192–1.717, p<0.0001) Conclusions Interventions should focus on the first 6 months following ARV initiation for improvements. Younger persons and widows are two target groups for better understanding facilitators and barriers to visit schedule adherence. Future strategies should explore the benefits of joining CASGs earlier in one´s treatment course. Finally, greater efforts should be made to accelerate the scale-up of viral load capacity and HIV resistance monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2923926220,"We compare the surgical outcomes of intermittent exotropia of the basic, pseudo-divergence excess (pseudo-DE) and true divergence excess (true DE) types. A study was performed with 342 patients who had undergone surgery for intermittent exotropia of the basic, pseudo-DE or true DE type with a postoperative follow-up period of 6 months or more. The main outcome measures were postoperative angles of deviation at distance and near, and surgical success rates. Surgical success was defined as alignment between exodeviation of 10 PD and esodeviation of 5 PD at distance and near. Additionally, survival curves of recurrence were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The postoperative angles of deviation at both distance and near in pseudo-DE type were significantly smaller than those in basic type at the final examination (p = 0.003, <0.001). The final surgical success rate in pseudo-DE (70.2%) was better than in basic (46.3%) or true DE (28.6%) (p = 0.003, 0.01). Reoperation for recurrent exotropia was performed in 27% of the basic, 17% of the pseudo-DE, and 35.7% of the true DE cases. According to a survival analysis for recurrence, patients with pseudo-DE showed lower incidence of recurrence than did patients with basic and true DE (p = 0.003, 0.02). In conclusion, the patients with intermittent exotropia of the pseudo-DE type showed better surgical outcomes than those with the basic or true DE type. Pseudo-DE also showed a lower recurrence rate than did the other 2 groups."
https://openalex.org/W2937572571,"Background NRF2 is a major transcription factor regulating the expression of antioxidative/detoxifying enzymes, involved in oncogenic processes and drug resistance. We aimed to identify molecular alterations associated with NRF2 activation in endometrial carcinoma (EC). Methods Ninety patients treated (2012–2017) for localized/locally advanced EC were included in this study. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples were processed for immunohistochemical (NRF2 and Mismatch Repair proteins) analyses. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of a panel of genes including POLE, TP53, NFE2L2, KEAP1 and CUL3 was performed using Ampliseq panels on Ion Torrent PGM (ThermoFisher). NRF2 activity was assessed by NQO1, GCLC, and AKR1C3 mRNA expressions, using TaqMan assays and quantitative RT-PCR. Results Tumors were classified as POLE exonuclease domain mutated (N = 3, 3%), MMR-deficient (MSI-like) (N = 28, 31%), TP53 mutated (Copy-number high-like) (N = 22, 24%), and other tumors (Copy-number low-like) (N = 32, 36%). NRF2 nuclear immunostaining did not correlate with NRF2 target genes expression. The 3 tumors with highest NRF2 target genes expression harbored oncogenic KEAP1 or NFE2L2 mutations. Low NQO1 mRNA and protein levels were observed in the TP53 mutated subgroup compared to others tumors (p < .05) and in silico analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas data further indicated that NQO1 mRNA levels were lower in serous compared to endometrioid copy-number high EC. Conclusion In contrast with previous reports based on immunohistochemistry, our study indicates that NRF2 activation is a rare event in EC, associated with NFE2L2 or KEAP1 mutations. The subset of aggressive EC with low NQO1 mRNA level might represent a specific subgroup, which could be sensitive to combination therapies targeting oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2940671027,"A large body of evidence has established a pattern of altered functioning in the immune system, autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis in chronic fatigue syndrome. However, the relationship between components within and between these systems is unclear. In this paper we investigated the underlying network structure of the autonomic system in patients and controls, and a larger network comprising all three systems in patients alone.In a sample of patients and controls we took several measures of autonomic nervous system output during 10 minutes of supine rest covering tests of blood pressure variability, heart rate variability and cardiac output. Awakening salivary cortisol was measured on each of two days with participants receiving 0.5mg dexamethasone during the afternoon of the first day. Basal plasma cytokine levels and the in vitro cytokine response to dexamethasone were also measured. Symptom outcome measures used were the fatigue impact scale and cognitive failures questionnaire. Mutual information criteria were used to construct networks describing the dependency amongst variables. Data from 42 patients and 9 controls were used in constructing autonomic networks, and 15 patients in constructing the combined network.The autonomic network in patients showed a more uneven distribution of information, with two distinct modules emerging dominated by systolic blood pressure during active stand and end diastolic volume and stroke volume respectively. The combined network revealed strong links between elements of each of the three regulatory systems, characterised by three higher modules the centres of which were systolic blood pressure during active stand, stroke volume and ejection fraction respectively.CFS is a complex condition affecting physiological systems. It is important that novel analytical techniques are used to understand the abnormalities that lead to CFS. The underlying network structure of the autonomic system is significantly different to that of controls, with a small number of individual nodes being highly influential. The combined network suggests links across regulatory systems which shows how alterations in single nodes might spread throughout the network to produce alterations in other, even distant, nodes. Replication in a larger cohort is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2942629597,"Hyperglycemia is common and associated with increased mortality after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Mechanisms behind ultra-acute hyperglycemia are not well known. We performed an explorative study to describe the changes in glucose metabolism mediators during the prehospital postresuscitation phase.We included patients who were successfully resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in two physician-staffed units. Insulin, glucagon, and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) were measured in prehospital and hospital admission samples. Additionally, interleukin-6 (IL-6), cortisol, and HbA1c were measured at hospital admission.Thirty patients participated in the study. Of those, 28 cases (71% without diabetes) had sufficient data for analysis. The median time interval between prehospital samples and hospital admission samples was 96 minutes (IQR 85-119). At the time of ROSC, the patients were hyperglycemic (11.2 mmol/l, IQR 8.8-15.7), with insulin and glucagon concentrations varying considerably, although mostly corresponding to fasting levels (10.1 mU/l, IQR 4.2-25.2 and 141 ng/l, IQR 105-240, respectively). GLP-1 increased 2- to 8-fold with elevation of IL-6. The median glucose change from prehospital to hospital admission was -2.2 mmol/l (IQR -3.6 to -0.2). No significant correlations between the change in plasma glucose levels and the changes in insulin (r = 0.30, p = 0.13), glucagon (r = 0.29, p = 0.17), or GLP-1 levels (r = 0.32, p = 0.15) or with IL-6 (r = (-0.07), p = 0.75), cortisol (r = 0.13, p = 0.52) or HbA1c levels (r = 0.34, p = 0.08) were observed. However, in patients who did not receive exogenous epinephrine during resuscitation, changes in blood glucose correlated with changes in insulin (r = 0.59, p = 0.04) and glucagon (r = 0.65, p = 0.05) levels, demonstrating that lowering glucose values was associated with a simultaneous lowering of insulin and glucagon levels.Hyperglycemia is common immediately after OHCA and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. No clear hormonal mechanisms were observed to be linked to changes in glucose levels during the postresuscitation phase in the whole cohort. However, in patients without exogenous epinephrine treatment, the correlations between glycemic and hormonal changes were more obvious. These results call for future studies examining the mechanisms of postresuscitation hyperglycemia and the metabolic effects of the global ischemic insult and medical treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2943070957,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in human infants. Bovine RSV infection of neonatal calves is pathologically and immunologically similar to RSV infection in infants, and is therefore a useful preclinical model for testing novel therapeutics. Treatment of severe RSV bronchiolitis relies on supportive care and may include use of bronchodilators and inhaled or systemic corticosteroids. Interleukin-17A (IL-17) is an inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in neutrophil recruitment and activation. IL-17 is increased in children and rodents with severe RSV infection; and in calves with severe BRSV infection. It is currently unclear if IL-17 and Th17 immunity is beneficial or detrimental to the host during RSV infection. Digoxin was recently identified to selectively inhibit IL-17 production by antagonizing its transcription factor, retinoid-related orphan receptor γ t (RORγt). Digoxin inhibits RORγt binding to IL-17 and Th17 associated genes, and suppresses IL-17 production in vitro in human and murine leukocytes and in vivo in rodent models of autoimmune disease. We demonstrate here that in vitro and in vivo digoxin treatment also inhibits IL-17 production by bovine leukocytes. To determine the role of IL-17 in primary RSV infection, calves were treated prophylactically with digoxin and infected with BRSV. Digoxin treated calves demonstrated reduced signs of clinical illness after BRSV infection, and reduced lung pathology compared to untreated control calves. Digoxin treatment did not adversely affect virus shedding or lung viral burden, but had a significant impact on pulmonary inflammatory cytokine expression on day 10 post infection. Together, our results suggest that exacerbated expression of IL-17 has a negative impact on RSV disease, and that development of specific therapies targeting Th17 immunity may be a promising strategy to improve disease outcome during severe RSV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2943603006,College students' study strategies were explored by tracking the ways they navigated the websites of two large (Ns of 1384 and 671) online introductory psychology courses. Students' study patterns were measured analyzing the ways they clicked outside of the regularly scheduled class on study materials within the online Learning Management System. Three main effects emerged: studying course content materials (as opposed to course logistics materials) outside of class and higher grades are consistently correlated; studying at any time except in the late night/early morning hours was strongly correlated with grades; students with higher Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores made higher grades but accessed course materials at lower rates that those with lower SATs. Multiple regressions predicting grades using just SATs and click rates accounted for almost 43 and 36 percent of the grade variance for the Fall and Spring classes respectively. Implications for using click patterns to understand and shape student learning are discussed.
https://openalex.org/W2988990404,"In two studies we provide a novel investigation into the effects of monetary switching costs on choice-inertia (i.e., selection of the same option on consecutive choices). Study 1 employed a static decisions-from-feedback task and found that the introduction of, as well as larger, monetary switching costs led to increases in choice-inertia. While experience and decreases in the similarity of options average payouts (expected value: EV) increased choice-inertia for the option with a higher EV (the EV maximizing option), switching costs increased choice-inertia for the inferior option (the lower EV option): The proportion of total participants showing choice-inertia for the EV maximizing option also increased with switching costs. Study 2 employed a dynamic decisions-from-feedback task where halfway through the task the EV maximizing option became the inferior option. The effect of switching costs increasing choice-inertia for both the EV maximizing and the inferior option was replicated with little impact of the change in options values being detected. In sum, decision makers appear to be sensitive to switching costs, and this sensitivity can bias them towards inferior or superior options, revealing the good and the bad of choice-inertia."

SRs and NSRs for local MRI staging of endometrial cancer were generated for all subjects. NSRs were generated during clinical routine practice. The same 41 uterine studies were reviewed by the same radiologist using structured reporting system after a period of time. Two radiologists compared SRs on the number of key features related to cancer staging and writing efficiency with NSRs together. Five gynecologists filled in questionnaires regarding satisfaction with content, clinical usefulness, report' quality and time consumption. Statistical analysis included Kendall's W test, paired-sample t test and Wilcoxon signed rank test.There was no significant difference in the number of key features in NSRs comparison to SRs (p = 0.055). A statistically significant difference was observed in the satisfaction with linguistic quality for NSRs versus SRs by three gynaecologists (reader 1: 4.02 vs. 4.63, p = 0.002; reader 3: 3.86 vs. 4.02, p = 0.035; reader 4: 4.05 vs. 4.27, p = 0.024). The radiologist spent less time finishing SRs compared with NSRs (727.22 ± 38.42 sec vs. 616.44 ± 60.00 sec, p = 0.037).The application of SRs significantly increased the value of female pelvic MRI reports by increasing radiologists' work efficiency and gynaecologists' satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W2923670562,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus that results in both tubular and glomerular injury. Low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress are two mechanisms known to drive the progression of DN. Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat containing family member X1 (NLRX1) is an innate immune receptor, uniquely located in mitochondria, that has been found to regulate inflammatory responses and to dampen renal oxidative stress by regulating oxidative phosphorylation. For this reason, we investigated the role of NLRX1 in the development of DN in a Type 1 Diabetes mouse model. We analyzed the effect of NLRX1 deficiency on diabetes development and the accompanied renal damage, inflammation, and fibrosis. We found that multiple low doses of streptozotocin induced body weight loss, polydipsia, hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and a mild DN phenotype in wildtype and NLRX1-deficient mice, without significant differences between these mouse strains. Despite increased NLRX1 expression in diabetic wildtype mice, NLRX1 deficiency did not affect the diabetic phenotype induced by streptozotocin treatment, as reflected by similar levels of polyuria, microalbuminuria, and increased renal markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in wildtype and NLRX1-deficient mice. The present findings show that NLRX1 does not mediate the development of streptozotocin-induced diabetes and diabetic-induced nephropathy in mice after multiple low doses of streptozotocin. This data implies that, while NLRX1 can be triggered by cellular stress, its regulatory and functional effects may be dependent on the specific physiological conditions. In the case of DN, NLRX1 may be neither helpful nor harmful, but rather a marker of metabolic stress."
https://openalex.org/W3004245976,"This study’s objective was to determine the accuracy of using current computed tomography (CT) scan and software techniques for rapid prototyping by quantifying the margin of error between CT models and laser scans of canine skull specimens. Twenty canine skulls of varying morphology were selected from an anatomy collection at a veterinary school. CT scans (bone and standard algorithms) were performed for each skull, and data segmented (testing two lower threshold settings of 226HU and -650HU) into 3-D CT models. Laser scans were then performed on each skull. The CT models were compared to the corresponding laser scan to determine the error generated from the different types of CT model parameters. This error was then compared between the different types of CT models to determine the most accurate parameters. The mean errors for the 226HU CT models, both bone and standard algorithms, were not significant from zero error (p = 0.1076 and p = 0.0580, respectively). The mean errors for both -650HU CT models were significant from zero error (p < 0.001). Significant differences were detected between CT models for 3 CT model comparisons: Bone (p < 0.0001); Standard (p < 0.0001); and -650HU (p < 0.0001). For 226HU CT models, a significant difference was not detected between CT models (p = 0.2268). Independent of the parameters tested, the 3-D models derived from CT imaging accurately represent the real skull dimensions, with CT models differing less than 0.42 mm from the real skull dimensions. The 226HU threshold was more accurate than the -650HU threshold. For the 226HU CT models, accuracy was not dependent on the CT algorithm. For the -650 CT models, bone was more accurate than standard algorithms. Knowing the inherent error of this procedure is important for use in 3-D printing for surgical planning and medical education."
https://openalex.org/W2924557636,"Background 
Maternity care services provide critical interventions aimed at improving maternal and newborn health. In this study, we examined determinants of antenatal care (ANC) content in Syria, together with changes over time.


Methods 
We analysed two national surveys conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics in Damascus (PAPFAM 2001 and MICS 2006). Findings of this initial analysis led to a qualitative study on adequacy of antenatal care content in two Syrian governorates, Aleppo and Latakia in 2010, which in turn informed further quantitative analysis. The perspectives and practices of doctors, women, midwives and health officials were explored using in-depth interviews. A framework approach was used to analyse the data.


Results 
The quantitative analysis demonstrated that women’s education level, the type of health facility they attended and whether they had experienced health complications were important determinants of adequacy of ANC content received. The qualitative study revealed that additional factors related to supply side and demand side factors (e.g. organization of health services, doctors' selective prescription of ANC tests and women's selective uptake of those tests), influenced the quality of ANC and explained some regional differences between Aleppo and Latakia.


Conclusions 
The percentage of women who received adequate ANC content was probably higher in Latakia than in Aleppo because women in Latakia were more educated, and because services were more available, accessible, and acceptable to them."

And the complex hydrodynamic coefficients and disturbances induced by beam waves are analyzed. Moreover, two stern flaps are designed for the system in the way of alternate flapping. In the controller design, the LQR method based on GA method is adopted to reduce the 3 DOF motion of the ship. Depending on the robust search mechanism and global optimum of GA, weighting parameters can be obtained to calculate the desired gain. Finally, the motion reduction and motion sickness incidence (MSI) results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed controller, and the comfort of passengers and crews can also be improved."

Methods Grounded theory (constructivist approach) was used to conceptualize the patterns of unmet care needs. Data collection methodology involved focus groups (n = 4) and interviews, in which a total of 52 people participated (patients, family members, and professionals). Results Based on the data analysis, three domains (family situation, role of the caregiver, and professional help) were identified, which illustrate the unmet needs. In particular, lack of information about the disease and available support available resulted in a deterioration mutual understanding between the patient, family, and the medical staff; also increased stress for the caregiver, and lowered quality of life for the caring family. Conclusion Family members expect health workers to provide them with support, which includes informing them about the possible help available from the health and social welfare systems."

https://openalex.org/W2938796677,"Estrogens play a significant role in breast cancer development and are not only produced endogenously, but are also mimicked by estrogen-like compounds from environmental exposures. We evaluated associations between estrogenic (E) activity, demographic factors and breast cancer risk factors in Non-Latina Black (NLB), Non-Latina White (NLW), and Latina women. We examined the association between E activity and Indigenous American (IA) ancestry in Latina women. Total E activity was measured with a bioassay in plasma samples of 503 women who served as controls in the San Francisco Bay Area Breast Cancer Study. In the univariate model that included all women with race/ethnicity as the independent predictor, Latinas had 13% lower E activity (p = 0.239) and NLBs had 35% higher activity (p = 0.04) compared to NLWs. In the multivariable model that adjusted for demographic factors, Latinas continued to show lower E activity levels (26%, p = 0.026), but the difference between NLBs and NLWs was no longer statistically significant (p = 0.431). An inverse association was observed between E activity and IA ancestry among Latina women (50% lower in 0% vs. 100% European ancestry, p = 0.027) consistent with our previously reported association between IA ancestry and breast cancer risk. These findings suggest that endogenous estrogens and exogenous estrogen-like compounds that act on the estrogen receptor and modulate E activity may partially explain racial/ethnic differences in breast cancer risk."
https://openalex.org/W2944203481,"The repeated use of a drug frequently leads to alterations in the response to that drug. We undertook this study to determine whether multiple exposures to the general anesthetic produced alterations in subsequent exposures to this anesthetic. For this study, adult male rats were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane for one hour. The rats were divided into 4 groups of 8 rats each. Groups 1-3 were transported between their homeroom and the anesthesia testing room and were handled in an identical manner weekly for a period of 12 weeks, but were anesthetized on different schedules. Group 1 was anesthetized weekly for 12 weeks, Group 2 on either a 3 or 4 week schedule and Group 3 was anesthetized a single time, at the end of the 12 week period. To receive anesthesia multiple times, animals were transported from their homeroom to the anesthesia location and handled repeatedly. We took into consideration of the frequency of anesthesia exposure and the stress involved. Rats in groups 2 and 3 were placed in the anesthesia chamber, with O2 but with no anesthetic, every week when they were not scheduled to receive anesthesia. In Group 4, rats were not transported or handled in any way and stayed in the home room for a period of 12 weeks. Rats in this group were anesthetized once, at the very end of the study. Recovery of the rat's righting reflex was used to assess the acceleration of recovery time from general anesthesia. Group 1 rats showed dramatically faster emergence from anesthesia after several rounds of anesthesia. Surprisingly, Groups 2 and 3 rats, treated in an identical manner as Group 1, but which were anesthetized on different schedules, also exhibited more rapid emergence from anesthesia, when compared to Group 4 rats, which were never handled or transported prior to a single anesthesia. These results suggest that the stress of transportation and handling altered responsiveness to anesthesia. Our results show that responsiveness to anesthetic agents can change over time outside of the normal developmental changes taking place in rats as they age."
https://openalex.org/W3022167515,"The self-synchronization of rotors mounted on different vibrating bodies can be easily controlled by adjusting the coupling parameters. To reveal the synchronization characteristics of a weakly damped system with two rotors mounted on different vibrating bodies, we propose a simplified physical model. The topics described in this paper are related to coupling dynamic problems between two vibrating systems. Both synchronization and vibratory synchronization transmission of the system are studied. The coupling mechanism between the two rotors is analyzed to derive the synchronization condition and the stability criterion of the system. The vibration of the system is described by an averaging method that can separate fast motion (high frequency) from slow motion (low frequency). Theoretical research shows that vibration torque is the key factor in balancing the energy distribution between the rotors. Taking the maximum vibration torque (MVT) as a critical parameter, we investigate the synchronization characteristics of the vibrating system in different cases. The curve of the maximum vibration torque (MVT) versus coupling frequency is divided into several parts by the coupling characteristic frequency and the input torque difference between the rotors. Simulations of the system with coupling frequencies from different parts are carried out. For the system with rotational frequencies larger than the natural frequencies, the coupling characteristic frequency or characteristic frequency curve should be considered. When the coupling frequency is close to the characteristic frequency or the vibration state is close to the characteristic frequency curve, self-synchronization of the two rotors can be obtained easily. Under certain conditions when the coupling effect between the rotors is strong enough, the rotors can maintain synchronous rotation even when one of the two motors is shut off after synchronization is achieved, which is called vibratory synchronization transmission. Vibratory synchronization transmission of the system occurs in a new synchronous condition, and the phase difference between the rotors takes on a new value, that is, the system approaches a new synchronization state."
https://openalex.org/W3023213270,"The regulation of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) enzymes is established in humans, but molecular mechanisms of its basal and xenobiotic-mediated regulation in cattle are still unknown. Here, ~10 kbp of the bovine CYP3A28 gene promoter were cloned and sequenced, and putative transcription factor binding sites were predicted. The CYP3A28 proximal promoter (PP; -284/+71 bp) contained DNA elements conserved among species. Co-transfection of bovine nuclear receptors (NRs) pregnane X and constitutive androstane receptor (bPXR and bCAR) with various CYP3A28 promoter constructs into hepatoma cell lines identified two main regions, the PP and the distal fragment F3 (-6899/-4937 bp), that were responsive to bPXR (both) and bCAR (F3 fragment only). Site-directed mutagenesis and deletion of NR motif ER6, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF-1) and HNF-4 binding sites in the PP suggested either the involvement of ER6 element in bPXR-mediated activation or the cooperation between bPXR and liver-enriched transcription factors (LETFs) in PP transactivation. A putative DR5 element within the F3 fragment was involved in bCAR-mediated PP+F3 transactivation. Although DNA enrichment by anti-human NR antibodies was quite low, ChIP investigations in control and RU486-treated BFH12 cells, suggested that retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) bound to ER6 and DR5 motifs and its recruitment was enhanced by RU486 treatment. The DR5 element seemed to be recognized mainly by bCAR, while no clear-cut results were obtained for bPXR. Present results point to species-differences in CYP3A regulation and the complexity of bovine CYP3A28 regulatory elements, but further confirmatory studies are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2942224475,"Although selective head-cooling has been reported to decrease scalp and tympanic temperature and improve sleep quality, whether head-cooling during sleep can improve sleep quality in women during the luteal phase has not been elucidated. This randomized, controlled crossover open trial aimed to investigate the effect of head cooling during sleep on sleep quality in women during the luteal phase. Female university students aged 19–25 years with increased daytime sleepiness during the luteal phase were recruited by poster advertisement at their university from May to June 2016 and from May to June 2017. Fourteen women aged 19–22 years participated in this study. The temperature-controllable cooling sheet containing tubes filled with circulating water was used for head-cooling, and the head-cooling and the controlled temperature were set at 25°C and 35°C, respectively. Electroencephalogram data were obtained using a single-channel portable electroencephalogram device. The difference in sleep-related variables and tympanic temperature between head-cooling and control were analyzed using a linear mixed model. The proportion of arousal was lower with head cooling than with the control. In contrast, the proportion of non-REM3 and the delta power were higher with head cooling than with the control. The proportion of non-REM2 and non-REM3 among sleep EEG stages were positively and negatively correlated with the mean tympanic temperature during sleep, respectively. However, arousal and REM were not correlated with tympanic temperature. We considered the reduction of arousal time by head-cooling might be related to scalp temperature rather than tympanic temperature. Further, our results suggested that head-cooling also improved subjective sleep comfort. In conclusion, head-cooling during sleep could improve sleep quality in young women during the luteal phase."
https://openalex.org/W2942350780,"Campylobacter transducer-like proteins (Tlps), also known as methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), are associated with virulence as well as niche and host adaptation. While functional attributes of these proteins are being elucidated, little has been published regarding their sequence diversity or chromosomal locations and context, although they appear to define invertible regions within Campylobacter jejuni genomes. Genome assemblies for several species of Campylobacter were obtained from the publicly available NCBI repositories. Genomes from all isolates were obtained from GenBank and assessed for Tlp content, while data from isolates with complete, finished genomes were used to determine the identity of Tlps as well as the gene content of putative invertible elements (IEs) in C. jejuni (Cj) and C. coli (Cc). Tlps from several Campylobacter species were organized into a nomenclature system and novel Tlps were defined and named for Cj and Cc. The content of Tlps appears to be species-specific, though diverse within species. Cj and Cc carried overlapping, related Tlp content, as did the three C. fetus subspecies. Tlp1 was detected in 88% of Cj isolates and approximately 43% of Cc, and was found in a different conserved chromosomal location and genetic context in each species. Tlp1 and Tlp 3 predominated in genomes from Cj whereas other Tlps were detected less frequently. Tlp13 and Tlp20 predominated in genomes from Cc while some Cj/Cc Tlps were not detected at all. Tlps 2–4 and 11–20 were less frequently detected and many showed sequence heterogeneity that could affect substrate binding, signal transduction, or both. Tlps other than Tlp1, 7, and 10 had substantial sequence identity in the C-terminal half of the protein, creating chromosomal repeats potentially capable of mediating the inversion of large chromosomal DNA. Cj and Cc Tlps were both found in association with only 14 different genes, indicating a limited genomic context. In Cj these Tlps defined IEs that were for the most part found at a single chromosomal location and comprised of a conserved set of genes. Cc IEs were situated at very different chromosomal locations, had different structures than Cj IEs, and were occasionally incomplete, therefore not capable of inversion. Tlps may have a role in Campylobacter genome structure and dynamics as well as acting as chemoreceptors mediating chemotactic responses."
https://openalex.org/W2956726272,"Eis (Enhanced Intracellular Survival) is an important aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferase enzyme contributing to kanamycin resistance in Mtb clinical isolates. Eis proteins from M. tuberculosis (RvEis) and M. smegmatis (MsEis) have 58% identical and 69% similar amino acid sequences and acetylate aminoglycosides at multiple amines. Both the Eis proteins are hexameric and composed of two symmetric trimers. RvEis has remarkable structural stability and heat-stable aminoglycoside acetyltransferase activity. Although the structure and biochemical properties of MsEis have been studied earlier, the detailed characterization of its acetyltransferase activity and structural stability is lacking. In this study, we have performed comparative analysis of structural stability and aminoglycoside acetyltransferase activity of RvEis and MsEis proteins. Unlike RvEis, MsEis undergoes a three-state unfolding induced by heat or chemical denaturants and involves self-association of partially unfolded oligomers to form high molecular weight soluble aggregates. MsEis is highly susceptible to chemical denaturants and unfolds completely at lower concentrations of GdmCl and urea when compared to RvEis. In contrast to RvEis, the oligomeric forms of MsEis are SDS sensitive. However, SDS treatment resulted in increased helix formation in MsEis than RvEis. MsEis shows lesser thermostable activity with a decreased efficiency of kanamycin acetylation in comparison to RvEis. Furthermore, overexpression of MsEis does not provide thermal resistance to M. smegmatis unlike RvEis. Collectively, this study reveals that homologous proteins from pathogenic and nonpathogenic mycobacteria follow different modes of unfolding and demonstrate differential structural stability and activity despite highly similar sequences and oligomeric organization."
https://openalex.org/W2924455696,"Traffic signals, i.e., iconic symbols conveying traffic rules, generally represent spatial or movement meanings, e.g., ""Stop"", ""Go"", ""Bend warning"", or ""No entry"", and we visually perceive these symbols and produce appropriate bodily actions. The traffic signals are clearly thought to assist in producing bodily actions such as going forward or stopping, and the combination of symbolic recognition through visual perception and production of bodily actions could be one example of embodied cognition. However, to what extent our bodily actions are associated with the symbolic representations of commonly used traffic signals remains unknown. Here we experimentally investigated how traffic symbol recognition cognitively affects bodily action patterns, by employing a simple stimulus-response task for traffic sign recognition with a response of either sliding or pushing down on a joystick in a gamepad. We found that when operating the joystick, participants' slide reaction in response to the ""Go"" traffic symbol was significantly faster than their push reaction, while their response time to the ""Stop"" signal showed no differences between sliding and pushing actions. These results suggested that there was a possible association between certain action patterns and traffic symbol recognition, and in particular the ""Go"" symbol was congruent with a sliding action as a bodily response. Our findings may thus reveal an example of embodied cognition in visual perception of traffic signals."
https://openalex.org/W2943700173,"Several signaling proteins require self-association of individual monomer units to be activated for triggering downstream signaling cascades in cells. Methods that allow visualizing their underlying molecular mechanisms will immensely benefit cell biology. Using enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) complementation, here I present a functional imaging approach for visualizing the protein-protein interaction in cells. Activation mechanism of an ER (endoplasmic reticulum) resident Ca2+ sensor, STIM1 (Stromal Interaction Molecule 1) that regulates store-operated Ca2+ entry in cells is considered as a model system. Co-expression of engineered full-length human STIM1 (ehSTIM1) with N-terminal complementary split eGFP pairs in mammalian cells fluoresces to form 'puncta' upon a drop in ER lumen Ca2+ concentration. Quantization of discrete fluorescent intensities of ehSTIM1 molecules at a diffraction-limited resolution revealed a diverse set of intensity levels not exceeding six-fold. Detailed screening of the ehSTIM1 molecular entities characterized by one to six fluorescent emitters across various in-plane sections shows a greater probability of occurrence for entities with six emitters in the vicinity of the plasma membrane (PM) than at the interior sections. However, the number density of entities with six emitters was lesser than that of others localized close to the PM. This finding led to hypothesize that activated ehSTIM1 dimers perhaps oligomerize in bundles ranging from 1-6 with an increased propensity for the occurrence of hexamers of ehSTIM1 dimer units close to PM even when its partner protein, ORAI1 (PM resident Ca2+ channel) is not sufficiently over-expressed in cells. The experimental data presented here provide direct evidence for luminal domain association of ehSTIM1 monomer units to trigger activation and allow enumerating various oligomers of ehSTIM1 in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2945519641,"Following the 2007-2009 financial crisis, governments around the world passed laws that marked the beginning of new period of enhanced regulation of the financial industry. These laws called for a myriad of new regulations, which in the U.S. are created through the so-called notice-and-comment process. Through examining the text documents generated through this process, we study the formation of regulations to gain insight into how new regulatory regimes are implemented following major laws like the landmark Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Due to the variety of constituent preferences and political pressures, we find evidence that the government implements rules strategically to extend the regulatory boundary by first pursuing procedural rules that establish how economic activities will be regulated, followed by specifying who is subject to the procedural requirements. Our findings together with the unique nature of the Dodd-Frank Act translate to a number of stylized facts that should guide development of formal models of the rule-making process."
