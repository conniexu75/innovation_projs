Recent experimental work is beginning to unpick essential functions that can be attributed to the stable microbiota of humans. To be able to manipulate the microbiome to improve health, we need to understand community structure and composition and we need models to quantify and predict stability. Coyte et al. applied concepts and tools from community ecology to gut microbiome assembly. Independently developed models converged on a surprising answer: A high diversity of species is likely to coexist stably when the system is dominated by competitive, rather than cooperative, interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2170856052,"Dinoflagellates are important components of marine ecosystems and essential coral symbionts, yet little is known about their genomes. We report here on the analysis of a high-quality assembly from the 1180-megabase genome of Symbiodinium kawagutii. We annotated protein-coding genes and identified Symbiodinium-specific gene families. No whole-genome duplication was observed, but instead we found active (retro)transposition and gene family expansion, especially in processes important for successful symbiosis with corals. We also documented genes potentially governing sexual reproduction and cyst formation, novel promoter elements, and a microRNA system potentially regulating gene expression in both symbiont and coral. We found biochemical complementarity between genomes of S. kawagutii and the anthozoan Acropora, indicative of host-symbiont coevolution, providing a resource for studying the molecular basis and evolution of coral symbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2140464228,"The clockwork of insulin release In healthy people, blood glucose levels are maintained within a narrow range by several physiological mechanisms. Key among them is the release of the hormone insulin by pancreatic β cells, which occurs when glucose levels rise after a meal. In response to insulin, blood glucose is taken up by tissues that need fuel, such as muscle. β cells can anticipate the body's varying demand for insulin throughout the 24-hour day because they have their own circadian clock. How this clock controls insulin release has been unclear. Perelis et al. now show that the activity of transcriptional enhancers specific to β cells regulates the rhythmic expression of genes involved in the assembly and trafficking of insulin secretory vesicles (see the Perspective by Dibner and Schibler).

https://openalex.org/W3104385482,"The kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet is a leading candidate in the search for a spin system with a quantum spin-liquid ground state. The nature of its ground state remains a matter of great debate. We conducted 17-O single crystal NMR measurements of the S=1/2 kagome lattice in herbertsmithite ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$, which is known to exhibit a spinon continuum in the spin excitation spectrum. We demonstrate that the intrinsic local spin susceptibility $\chi_{kagome}$ deduced from the 17-O NMR frequency shift asymptotes to zero below temperature T ~ 0.03 J, where J ~ 200 K is the Cu-Cu super-exchange interaction. Combined with the magnetic field dependence of $\chi_{kagome}$ we observed at low temperatures, these results imply that the kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet has a spin-liquid ground state with a finite gap."
https://openalex.org/W2131193827,"Getting rid of carbon dioxide In mammals, red blood cells deliver oxygen to tissues and remove carbon dioxide. Key to this essential process is a membrane protein called anion exchanger 1 (AE1) which transports bicarbonate (formed from carbon dioxide) out of red blood cells in exchange for chloride. This decreases the pH inside the blood cells, so that oxygen is released from hemoglobin and can diffuse into tissues. Arakawa et al. report the crystal structure of the transmembrane anion exchanger domain of AE1, which includes 14 transmembrane helices. The structure provides a basis for understanding the effects of mutations that lead to red blood cell diseases and also gives insight into the mechanism of ion transport. Science , this issue p. 680"
https://openalex.org/W2176106417,"Understanding the evolution of sex determination in plants requires identifying the mechanisms underlying the transition from monoecious plants, where male and female flowers coexist, to unisexual individuals found in dioecious species. We show that in melon and cucumber, the androecy gene controls female flower development and encodes a limiting enzyme of ethylene biosynthesis, ACS11. ACS11 is expressed in phloem cells connected to flowers programmed to become female, and ACS11 loss-of-function mutants lead to male plants (androecy). CmACS11 represses the expression of the male promoting gene CmWIP1 to control the development and the coexistence of male and female flowers in monoecious species. Because monoecy can lead to dioecy, we show how a combination of alleles of CmACS11 and CmWIP1 can create artificial dioecy."
https://openalex.org/W2191152768,"A visionary approach to transparency Cataracts are the most common cause of vision loss, especially in our ever-increasing elderly population. Cataracts arise when crystallin, a major protein component of the eye lens, begins to aggregate, which causes the lens to become cloudy. Makley et al. explored whether small molecules that reverse this aggregation might have therapeutic potential for treating cataracts, which normally require surgery (see the Perspective by Quinlan). They used a screening method that monitors the effect of ligands on temperature-dependent protein unfolding and identified several compounds that bind and stabilize the soluble form of crystallin. In proof-of-concept studies, one of these compounds improved lens transparency in mice. Science , this issue p. 674 ; see also p. 636"
https://openalex.org/W2179583229,"Coupling between the lower and upper atmosphere, combined with loss of gas from the upper atmosphere to space, likely contributed to the thin, cold, dry atmosphere of modern Mars. To help understand ongoing ion loss to space, the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft made comprehensive measurements of the Mars upper atmosphere, ionosphere, and interactions with the Sun and solar wind during an interplanetary coronal mass ejection impact in March 2015. Responses include changes in the bow shock and magnetosheath, formation of widespread diffuse aurora, and enhancement of pick-up ions. Observations and models both show an enhancement in escape rate of ions to space during the event. Ion loss during solar events early in Mars history may have been a major contributor to the long-term evolution of the Mars atmosphere."

More-complex interactions would expand the potential of the system for quantum simulation. A promising approach is to use polar molecules instead of atoms, which interact at much longer length scales. However, “packing” the lattice with molecules is tricky. Moses et al. introduced bosonic 87 Rb atoms and fermionic 40 K atoms into an optical lattice, combined them into molecules, and brought the molecules into their ground state, achieving a considerable lattice filling of 25%.

https://openalex.org/W2097463188,"The voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), found in the mitochondrial outer membrane, forms the main interface between mitochondrial and cellular metabolisms, mediates the passage of a variety of molecules across the mitochondrial outer membrane, and is central to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. VDAC1 is overexpressed in post-mortem brains of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. The development and progress of AD are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from the cytotoxic effects of accumulated amyloid β (Aβ). In this study we demonstrate the involvement of VDAC1 and a VDAC1 N-terminal peptide (VDAC1-N-Ter) in Aβ cell penetration and cell death induction. Aβ directly interacted with VDAC1 and VDAC1-N-Ter, as monitored by VDAC1 channel conductance, surface plasmon resonance, and microscale thermophoresis. Preincubated Aβ interacted with bilayer-reconstituted VDAC1 and increased its conductance ∼ 2-fold. Incubation of cells with Aβ resulted in mitochondria-mediated apoptotic cell death. However, the presence of non-cell-penetrating VDAC1-N-Ter peptide prevented Aβ cellular entry and Aβ-induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Likewise, silencing VDAC1 expression by specific siRNA prevented Aβ entry into the cytosol as well as Aβ-induced toxicity. Finally, the mode of Aβ-mediated action involves detachment of mitochondria-bound hexokinase, induction of VDAC1 oligomerization, and cytochrome c release, a sequence of events leading to apoptosis. As such, we suggest that Aβ-mediated toxicity involves mitochondrial and plasma membrane VDAC1, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis induction. The VDAC1-N-Ter peptide targeting Aβ cytotoxicity is thus a potential new therapeutic strategy for AD treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2179298384,"The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission, during the second of its Deep Dip campaigns, made comprehensive measurements of martian thermosphere and ionosphere composition, structure, and variability at altitudes down to ~130 kilometers in the subsolar region. This altitude range contains the diffusively separated upper atmosphere just above the well-mixed atmosphere, the layer of peak extreme ultraviolet heating and primary reservoir for atmospheric escape. In situ measurements of the upper atmosphere reveal previously unmeasured populations of neutral and charged particles, the homopause altitude at approximately 130 kilometers, and an unexpected level of variability both on an orbit-to-orbit basis and within individual orbits. These observations help constrain volatile escape processes controlled by thermosphere and ionosphere structure and variability."
https://openalex.org/W2104271456,"Planetary auroras reveal the complex interplay between an atmosphere and the surrounding plasma environment. We report the discovery of low-altitude, diffuse auroras spanning much of Mars’ northern hemisphere, coincident with a solar energetic particle outburst. The Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph, a remote sensing instrument on the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft, detected auroral emission in virtually all nightside observations for ~5 days, spanning nearly all geographic longitudes. Emission extended down to ~60 kilometer (km) altitude (1 microbar), deeper than confirmed at any other planet. Solar energetic particles were observed up to 200 kilo­–electron volts; these particles are capable of penetrating down to the 60 km altitude. Given minimal magnetic fields over most of the planet, Mars is likely to exhibit auroras more globally than Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2336510962,"Corticomotoneuronal (CM) cells in the primary motor cortex (M1) have monosynaptic connections with motoneurons. They are one of the few sources of descending commands that directly influence motor output. We examined the contribution of CM cells to the generation of activity in their target muscles. The preferred direction of many CM cells differed from that of their target muscles. Some CM cells were selectively active when a muscle was used as an agonist. Others were selectively active when the same muscle was used as a synergist, fixator, or antagonist. These observations suggest that the different functional uses of a muscle are generated by separate populations of CM cells. We propose that muscle function is one of the dimensions represented in the output of M1."
https://openalex.org/W2140325242,"Epilepsy and intellectual/developmental disabilities (ID/DD) have a high rate of co-occurrence. Here, we investigated gene mutations in Chinese children with unexplained epilepsy and ID/DD.We used targeted next-generation sequencing to detect mutations within 300 genes related to epilepsy and ID/DD in 253 Chinese children with unexplained epilepsy and ID/DD. A series of filtering criteria was used to find the possible pathogenic variations. Validation and parental origin analyses were performed by Sanger sequencing. We reviewed the phenotypes of patients with each mutated gene.We identified 32 novel and 16 reported mutations within 24 genes in 46 patients. The detection rate was 18% (46/253) in the whole group and 26% (17/65) in the early-onset (before three months after birth) epilepsy group. To our knowledge, we are the first to report KCNAB1 is a disease-causing gene of epilepsy by identifying a novel de novo mutation (c.1062dupCA p.Leu355HisfsTer5) within this gene in one patient with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE). Patients with an SCN1A mutation accounted for the largest proportion, 17% (8/46). A total of 38% (9/24) of the mutated genes re-occurred at least 2 times and 63% (15/24) occurred only one time. Ion channel genes are the most common (8/24) and genes related to synapse are the next most common to occur (5/24).We have established genetic diagnosis for 46 patients of our cohort. Early-onset epilepsy had the highest detection rate. KCNAB1 mutation was first identified in EIEE patient. We expanded the phenotype and mutation spectrum of the genes we identified. The mutated genes in this cohort are mostly isolated. This suggests that epilepsy and ID/DD phenotypes occur as a consequence of brain dysfunction caused by a highly diverse population of mutated genes. Ion channel genes and genes related to synapse were more common mutated in this patient cohort."

Americium (Am) is less widely discussed outside chemistry circles, but the separation of this heavier radioactive element from nuclear waste streams is a major goal of fuel reprocessing research. The trouble is that trivalent Am ions are hard to tease apart from similarly charged lanthanide ions. Dares et al. now show that terpyridyl ligands appended to an electrode can promote the oxidation of trivalent Am ions to the pentavalent and hexavalent states (see the Perspective by Soderquist). These more highly charged ions should be easier to isolate for the subsequent use of the Am in next-generation nuclear reactors. Science , this issue p. 652 ; see also p. 635"
https://openalex.org/W2154647971,"Background Recent studies reported seasonal differences in gene expression in white blood cells, adipose tissue, and inflammatory biomarkers of the immune system. There is no data on the seasonal variations of these biomarkers in the US general population of both children and adults. Then aim of this study is to explore the seasonal trends in complete blood count (CBC), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in a large non-institutionalized US population. Methods Seven cross-sectional data collected in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) during 1999–2012 were aggregated; participants reporting recent use of prescribed steroids, chemotherapy, immunomodulators and antibiotics were excluded. Linear regression models were used to compare levels of CBC and CRP between winter-spring (November-April) and summer-fall (May-October), adjusting for demographics, personal behavioral factors, and chronic disease conditions. Results A total of 27,478 children and 36,644 adults (≥18 years) were included in the study. Levels of neutrophils, white blood cell count (WBC), and CRP were higher in winter-spring than summer-fall (p≤0.05). Red blood cell components were lower in winter-spring than in summer-fall, while the opposite was seen for platelets. Conclusions This large population-based study found notable seasonal variations in blood cell composition and inflammatory biomarkers, with a more pro-inflammatory immune system seen in winter-spring than summer-fall. The red blood cell patterns could have implications for the observed cardio-vascular seasonality."

https://openalex.org/W2096280246,"Rainfall partitioning and redistribution by canopies are important ecohydrological processes underlying ecosystem dynamics. We quantified and contrasted spatial and temporal variations of rainfall redistribution for a juniper (Juniperus virginiana, redcedar) woodland and a tallgrass prairie in the south-central Great Plains, USA. Our results showed that redcedar trees had high canopy storage capacity (S) ranging from 2.14 mm for open stands to 3.44 mm for closed stands. The canopy funneling ratios (F) of redcedar trees varied substantially among stand type and tree size. The open stands and smaller trees usually had higher F values and were more efficient in partitioning rainfall into stemflow. Larger trees were more effective in partitioning rainfall into throughfall and no significant changes in the total interception ratios among canopy types and tree size were found. The S values were highly variable for tallgrass prairie, ranging from 0.27 mm at early growing season to 3.86 mm at senescence. As a result, the rainfall interception by tallgrass prairie was characterized by high temporal instability. On an annual basis, our results showed no significant difference in total rainfall loss to canopy interception between redcedar trees and tallgrass prairie. Increasing structural complexity associated with redcedar encroachment into tallgrass prairie changes the rainfall redistribution and partitioning pattern at both the temporal and spatial scales, but does not change the overall canopy interception ratios compared with unburned and ungrazed tallgrass prairie. Our findings support the idea of convergence in interception ratio for different canopy structures under the same precipitation regime. The temporal change in rainfall interception loss from redcedar encroachment is important to understand how juniper encroachment will interact with changing rainfall regime and potentially alter regional streamflow under climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2136164628,"Distant relatives can share gene function The plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Papaver rhoeas (poppy) shared a common ancestor approximately 140 million years ago. Because of this evolutionary distance, although many of their genes share function, the mechanisms that allow these genes to function are expected to have diverged. However, Z. Lin et al. found that a pair of genes that prevent self-fertilization in poppy can confer the same trait when expressed in Arabidopsis. This incompatibility was much more like that of poppy than that of incompatible close relatives of Arabidopsis. Thus, similar long-distance transfer of incompatibility, a trait of interest for plant breeding, may be useful between other distantly related species. Science , this issue p. 684"

We present observations of dust at altitudes ranging from 150 to above 1000 kilometers by the Langmuir Probe and Wave instrument on the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution spacecraft. Based on its distribution, we interpret this dust to be interplanetary in origin. A comparison with laboratory measurements indicates that the dust grain size ranges from 1 to 12 micrometers, assuming a typical grain velocity of ~18 kilometers per second. These direct observations of dust entering the martian atmosphere improve our understanding of the sources, sinks, and transport of interplanetary dust throughout the inner solar system and the associated impacts on Mars's atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2148230290,"CHARGE syndrome is a variable, multiple congenital malformation syndrome. Patients with CHARGE syndrome have frequent infections that are presumed to be due to anatomical anomalies of the craniofacial region and upper airway, and cranial nerve problems resulting in swallowing difficulties and aspiration. The possible contribution of immunological abnormalities to these infections has not been systematically studied even though immune deficiencies have been described in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, a condition which shares remarkable clinical overlap with CHARGE syndrome. We assessed the frequency and nature of immune dysfunction in 24 children with genetically proven CHARGE syndrome. All patients, or their parents, completed a questionnaire on infectious history. Their immune system was extensively assessed through full blood counts, immunoglobulin levels, lymphocyte subpopulations, peripheral B- and T-cell differentiation, T-receptor excision circle (TREC) analysis, T-cell function, and vaccination responses. All CHARGE patients had a history of infections (often frequent), mainly otitis media and pneumonia, leading to frequent use of antibiotics and to hospital admissions. Decreased T-cell numbers were found in 12 (50%) patients, presumably caused by insufficient thymic output since TREC amounts were also diminished in CHARGE patients. Despite normal peripheral B-cell differentiation and immunoglobulin production in all patients, 83% of patients had insufficient antibody titers to one or more early childhood vaccinations. Based on our results, we recommend immunological evaluation of CHARGE patients with recurrent infections."
https://openalex.org/W2274447103,"The heterotetrameric (ϵ-β4-μ4-σ4) complex adaptor protein 4 (AP-4) is a component of a non-clathrin coat involved in protein sorting at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Considerable interest in this complex has arisen from the recent discovery that mutations in each of its four subunits are the cause of a congenital intellectual disability and movement disorder in humans. Despite its physiological importance, the structure and function of this coat remain poorly understood. To investigate the assembly of the AP-4 coat, we dissected the determinants of interaction of AP-4 with its only known accessory protein, the ENTH/VHS-domain-containing protein tepsin. Using a variety of protein interaction assays, we found that tepsin comprises two phylogenetically conserved peptide motifs, [GS]LFXG[ML]X[LV] and S[AV]F[SA]FLN, within its C-terminal unstructured region, which interact with the C-terminal ear (or appendage) domains of the β4 and ϵ subunits of AP-4, respectively. Structure-based mutational analyses mapped the binding site for the [GS]LFXG[ML]X[LV] motif to a conserved, hydrophobic surface on the β4-ear platform fold. Both peptide-ear interactions are required for efficient association of tepsin with AP-4, and for recruitment of tepsin to the TGN. The bivalency of the interactions increases the avidity of tepsin for AP-4 and may enable cross-linking of multiple AP-4 heterotetramers, thus contributing to the assembly of the AP-4 coat. In addition to revealing critical aspects of this coat, our findings extend the paradigm of peptide-ear interactions, previously established for clathrin-AP-1/AP-2 coats, to a non-clathrin coat."

https://openalex.org/W2104974651,"The comprehensive assessment of climatic and hydrological droughts in terms of their temporal and spatial evolutions is very important for water resources management and social development in the basin scale. To study the spatial and temporal changes of climatic and hydrological droughts and the relationships between them, the SPEI and SDI are adopted to assess the changes and the correlations of climatic and hydrological droughts by selecting the Jialing River basin, China as the research area. The SPEI and SDI at different time scales are assessed both at the entire Jialing River basin and at the regional levels of the three sub basins. The results show that the SPEI and SDI are very suitable for assessing the changes and relationships of climatic and hydrological droughts in large basins. Based on the assessment, for the Jialing River basin, climatic and hydrological droughts have the increasing tendency during recent several decades, and the increasing trend of climatic droughts is significant or extremely significant in the western and northern basin, while hydrological drought has a less significant increasing trend. Additionally, climatic and hydrological droughts tend to increase in the next few years. The results also show that on short time scales, climatic droughts have one or two months lag impact on hydrological droughts in the north-west area of the basin, and have one month lag impact in south-east area of the basin. The assessment of climatic and hydrological droughts based on the SPEI and SDI could be very useful for water resources management and climate change adaptation at large basin scale."

In the present study, two full length cDNA encoding cecropin2 (Px-cec2) and cecropin3 (Px-cec3) were obtained from P. xylostella by integrated analysis of genome and transcriptome data. qRT-PCR analysis revealed the high levels of transcripts of Px-cecs (Px-cec1, Px-cec2 and Px-cec3) in epidermis, fat body and hemocytes after 24, 30 and 36 h induction of Metarhizium anisopliae, respectively. Silencing of Spätzle and Dorsal separately caused the low expression of cecropins in the fat body, epidermis and hemocytes, and made the P.xylostella larvae more susceptible to M. anisopliae. Antimicrobial assays demonstrated that the purified recombinant cecropins, i.e., Px-cec1, Px-cec2 and Px-cec3, exerted a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against fungi, as well as Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Especially, Px-cecs showed higher activity against M. anisopliae than another selected fungi isolates. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that cecropins exerted the vital morphological alterations to the spores of M. anisopliae.

https://openalex.org/W2108248112,"Noroviruses (NoVs) are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis, both in sporadic cases and outbreaks. Since the 1990s, the emergence of several GII.4 variants has been reported worldwide. To investigate the epidemic status of NoV, 6,724 stool samples collected from outbreaks in Yokohama, Japan, from the 2006-2007 to 2013-2014 seasons were assessed for NoVs. We genotyped one specimen from each GII outbreak and conducted a sequence analysis of the VP1 gene for several GII.4 strains. Of the 947 NoV outbreaks during our study, GII was detected in 835, and GII.4 was the predominant genotype of GII. Five different GII.4 variants, Yerseke 2006a, Den Haag 2006b (2006b), Apeldoorn 2007, New Orleans 2009, and Sydney 2012, were detected. During this study period, the most prevalent variant of GII.4 was 2006b, and in each individual season, either 2006b or Sydney 2012 was the predominant variant. Out of the 16 detected 2006b strains, 12 had some amino acid substitutions in their blockade epitope, and these substitutions were concentrated in three residues. Two of the 2006b strains detected in the 2012-2013 season had a S368E substitution, which is consistent with the amino acid residues at same site of NSW0514 (Sydney 2012 prototype). Among the 16 detected strains of Sydney 2012, a phylogenetic analysis showed that all five strains detected in Yokohama during the 2011-2012 season clustered away from the other Sydney 2012 strains that were detected in the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 seasons. These five strains and other Sydney 2012 strains in Yokohama had a few amino acid differences in the blockade epitopes compared with NSW0514. The amino acid substitutions observed in this study provide informative data about the evolution of a novel GII.4 variant."
https://openalex.org/W2116096474,"Transcriptomes and proteomes of Pseudomonas putida LS46 cultured with biodiesel-derived waste glycerol or waste free fatty acids, as sole carbon sources, were compared under conditions that were either permissive or non-permissive for synthesis of medium chain length polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHA). The objectives of this study were to elucidate mechanisms that influence activation of biopolymer synthesis, intra-cellular accumulation, and monomer composition, and determine if these were physiologically specific to the carbon sources used for growth of P. putida LS46. Active mcl-PHA synthesis by P. putida LS46 was associated with high expression levels of key mcl-PHA biosynthesis genes and/or gene products including monomer-supplying proteins, PHA synthases, and granule-associated proteins. 'Omics data suggested that expression of these genes were regulated by different genetic mechanisms in P. putida LS46 cells in different physiological states, when cultured on the two waste carbon sources. Optimal polymer production by P. putida LS46 was primarily limited by less efficient glycerol metabolism during mcl-PHA synthesis on waste glycerol. Mapping the 'Omics data to the mcl-PHA biosynthetic pathway revealed significant variations in gene expression, primarily involved in: 1) glycerol transportation; 2) enzymatic reactions that recycle reducing equivalents and produce key mcl-PHA biosynthesis pathway intermediates (e.g. NADH/NADPH, acetyl-CoA). Active synthesis of mcl-PHAs was observed during exponential phase in cultures with waste free fatty acids, and was associated with the fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. A putative Thioesterase in the beta-oxidation pathway that may regulate the level of fatty acid beta-oxidation intermediates, and thus carbon flux to mcl-PHA biosynthesis, was highly up-regulated. Finally, the data suggested that differences in expression of selected fatty acid metabolism and mcl-PHA monomer-supplying enzymes may play a role in determining the monomer composition of mcl-PHA polymers. Understanding the relationships between genome content, gene and gene product expression, and how these factors influence polymer synthesis, will aid in optimization of mcl-PHA production by P. putida LS46 using biodiesel waste streams."
https://openalex.org/W2158178602,"The chemokine Stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF1α, CXCL12) is currently under investigation as a biomarker for various cardiac diseases. The correct interpretation of SDF1α levels is complicated by the occurrence of truncated forms that possess an altered biological activity.We studied the immunoreactivities of SDF1α forms and evaluated the effect of adding a DPP4 inhibitor in sampling tubes on measured SDF1α levels. Using optimized sampling, we measured DPP4 activity and SDF1α levels in patients with varying degrees of heart failure.The immunoreactivities of SDF1α and its degradation products were determined with three immunoassays. A one hour incubation of SDF1α with DPP4 at 37°C resulted in 2/3 loss of immunoreactivity in each of the assays. Incubation with serum gave a similar result. Using appropriate sampling, SDF1α levels were found to be significantly higher in those heart failure patients with a severe loss of left ventricular function. DPP4 activity in serum was not altered in the heart failure population. However, the DPP4 activity was found to be significantly decreased in patients with high SDF1α levels.We propose that all samples for SDF1α analysis should be collected in the presence of at least a DPP4 inhibitor. In doing so, we found higher SDF1α levels in subgroups of patients with heart failure. Our work supports the need for further research on the clinical relevance of SDF1α levels in cardiac disease."

We combined size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with reversed-phase liquid chromatography multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (RPLC-MRM-MS) to characterize MSC components and free ARS proteins in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293T) cells. Crude cell extract and affinity-purified proteins were fractionated by SEC in non-denaturing state and ARSs were monitored in each fraction by MRM-MS. The eleven MSC components appeared mostly in earlier SEC fractions demonstrating their participation in complex formation. TARSL2 and AIMP2-DX2, despite their low abundance, were co-purified with KARS and detected in the SEC fractions, where MSC appeared. Moreover, other large complex-forming ARS proteins, such as VARS and FARS, were detected in earlier fractions. The MRM-MS results were further confirmed by western blot analysis. Our study demonstrates usefulness of combined SEC-MRM analysis for the characterization of protein complexes and in understanding the behavior of minor isoforms or variant proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2113403589,"With recent progress in the analysis of the salivary proteome, the number of salivary proteins identified has increased dramatically. However, the physiological functions of many of the newly discovered proteins remain unclear. Closely related to the study of a protein's function is the identification of its interaction partners. Although in saliva some proteins may act primarily as single monomeric units, a significant percentage of all salivary proteins, if not the majority, appear to act in complexes with partners to execute their diverse functions. Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and pull-down assays were used to identify the heterotypic complexes between histatin 5, a potent natural antifungal protein, and other salivary proteins in saliva. Classical protein-protein interaction methods in combination with high-throughput mass spectrometric techniques were carried out. Co-IP using protein G magnetic Sepharose TM beads suspension was able to capture salivary complexes formed between histatin 5 and its salivary protein partners. Pull-down assay was used to confirm histatin 5 protein partners. A total of 52 different proteins were identified to interact with histatin 5. The present study used proteomic approaches in conjunction with classical biochemical methods to investigate protein-protein interaction in human saliva. Our study demonstrated that when histatin 5 is complexed with salivary amylase, one of the 52 proteins identified as a histatin 5 partner, the antifungal activity of histatin 5 is reduced. We expected that our proteomic approach could serve as a basis for future studies on the mechanism and structural-characterization of those salivary protein interactions to understand their clinical significance."

https://openalex.org/W2336271843,"Since changes in lung microstructure are important indicators for (early stage) lung pathology, there is a need for quantifiable information of diagnostically challenging cases in a clinical setting, e.g. to evaluate early emphysematous changes in peripheral lung tissue. Considering alveoli as spherical air-spaces surrounded by a thin film of lung tissue allows deriving an expression for Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill transverse relaxation rates R2 with a dependence on inter-echo time, local air-tissue volume fraction, diffusion coefficient and alveolar diameter, within a weak field approximation. The model relaxation rate exhibits the same hyperbolic tangent dependency as seen in the Luz-Meiboom model and limiting cases agree with Brooks et al. and Jensen et al. In addition, the model is tested against experimental data for passively deflated rat lungs: the resulting mean alveolar radius of RA = 31.46 ± 13.15 μm is very close to the literature value (∼34 μm). Also, modeled radii obtained from relaxometer measurements of ageing hydrogel foam (that mimics peripheral lung tissue) are in good agreement with those obtained from μCT images of the same foam (mean relative error: 0.06 ± 0.01). The model’s ability to determine the alveolar radius and/or air volume fraction will be useful in quantifying peripheral lung microstructure."
https://openalex.org/W2108864812,"Background Climate change scenarios that include precipitation shifts and nitrogen (N) deposition are impacting carbon (C) budgets in arid ecosystems. Roots constitute an important part of the C cycle, but it is still unclear which factors control root mass loss and nutrient release in arid lands. Methodology/Principal Findings Litterbags were used to investigate the decomposition rate and nutrient dynamics in root litter with water and N-addition treatments in the Gurbantunggut Desert in China. Water and N addition had no significant effect on root mass loss and the N and phosphorus content of litter residue. The loss of root litter and nutrient releases were strongly controlled by the initial lignin content and the lignin:N ratio, as evidenced by the negative correlations between decomposition rate and litter lignin content and the lignin:N ratio. Fine roots of Seriphidium santolinum (with higher initial lignin content) had a slower decomposition rate in comparison to coarse roots. Conclusion/Significance Results from this study indicate that small and temporary changes in rainfall and N deposition do not affect root decomposition patterns in the Gurbantunggut Desert. Root decomposition rates were significantly different between species, and also between fine and coarse roots, and were determined by carbon components, especially lignin content, suggesting that root litter quality may be the primary driver of belowground carbon turnover."

The molecular mechanisms underlying HCV replication and pathogenesis remain unclear. The development of the subgenome replicon model system significantly enhanced study of HCV. However, the permissiveness of the HCV subgenome replicon greatly differs among different hepatoma cell lines. Proteomic analysis of different permissive cell lines might provide new clues in understanding HCV replication. In this study, to detect potential candidates that might account for the differences in HCV replication. Label-free and iTRAQ labeling were used to analyze the differentially expressed protein profiles between Huh7.5.1 wt and HepG2 cells. A total of 4919 proteins were quantified in which 114 proteins were commonly identified as differentially expressed by both quantitative methods. A total of 37 differential proteins were validated by qRT-PCR. The differential expression of Glutathione S-transferase P (GSTP1), Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 (UCHL1), carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), vimentin, Proteasome activator complex subunit1 (PSME1), and Cathepsin B (CTSB) were verified by western blot. And over-expression of CTSB or knock-down of vimentin induced significant changes to HCV RNA levels. Additionally, we demonstrated that CTSB was able to inhibit HCV replication and viral protein translation. These results highlight the potential role of CTSB and vimentin in virus replication."

The surface roughness values were measured by the non-contact three-dimensional morphology scanner, then the surface micromorphologies of surfaces in all groups were assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM); meanwhile, Image Pro-Plus 6.0 software was used to measure the relative percentage of open tubules on SEM images. The rest, one hundred twenty-eight teeth for bond strength test, were divided into eight groups according to the different treatments (A: only treated with the adhesive Adper Easy One, B: diamond bur polishing followed by the above adhesive, C-H: Er,Cr:YSGG laser irradiating at 1 W, 2 W, 3 W, 4 W, 5 W, 6 W output power, respectively, followed by the above adhesive), and each group was subsequently divided into two subgroups according to whether aging is performed (immediately tested and after thermocycling). Micro-shear bond strength test was used to evaluate the bond strength.The 4W laser group showed the highest roughness value (30.84±1.93μm), which was statistically higher than the control group and the diamond bur groups (p<0.05). The mean percentages ((27.8±1.8)%, (28.0±2.2)%, (30.0±1.9)%) of open tubules area in the 4W, 5W, 6W group were higher than other groups (p<0.05). The 4W laser group showed the highest micro-shear bond strength not only in immediately tested (17.60±2.55 PMa) but after thermocycling (14.35±2.08MPa).The Er,Cr:YSGG laser at 4W power can effectively improve the bonding property between non-carious sclerotic dentin and resin composites by increasing the roughness and mean percentage area of open tubules."
https://openalex.org/W2163175275,"Patterns of genetic variation in human populations across the African continent are still not well studied in comparison with Eurasia and America, despite the high genetic and cultural diversity among African populations. In population and forensic genetic studies a single sample is often used to represent a complete African region. In such a scenario, inappropriate sampling strategies and/or the use of local, isolated populations may bias interpretations and pose questions of representativeness at a macrogeographic-scale. The non-recombining region of the Y-chromosome (NRY) has great potential to reveal the regional representation of a sample due to its powerful phylogeographic information content. An area poorly characterized for Y-chromosomal data is the West-African region along the Bight of Benin, despite its important history in the trans-Atlantic slave trade and its large number of ethnic groups, languages and lifestyles. In this study, Y-chromosomal haplotypes from four Beninese populations were determined and a global meta-analysis with available Y-SNP and Y-STR data from populations along the Bight of Benin and surrounding areas was performed. A thorough methodology was developed allowing comparison of population samples using Y-chromosomal lineage data based on different Y-SNP panels and phylogenies. Geographic proximity turned out to be the best predictor of genetic affinity between populations along the Bight of Benin. Nevertheless, based on Y-chromosomal data from the literature two population samples differed strongly from others from the same or neighbouring areas and are not regionally representative within large-scale studies. Furthermore, the analysis of the HapMap sample YRI of a Yoruban population from South-western Nigeria based on Y-SNPs and Y-STR data showed for the first time its regional representativeness, a result which is important for standard population and forensic genetic applications using the YRI sample. Therefore, the uniquely and powerful geographical information carried by the Y-chromosome makes it an important locus to test the representativeness of a certain sample even in the genomic era, especially in poorly investigated areas like Africa."

Herein, the 'infrastructure impacts"" are referred to as infrastructure-sensitive changes in weather and climate patterns (extremes and non-extremes) that are modulated, among other factors, by changes in landscape, land use and land cover change. In this first report, the article argued for explicitly considering the well-established feedbacks triggered by infrastructure systems to the land-atmosphere system via landscape change. In this report by the ASCE Task Committee (TC), we present the results of this ASCE TC's survey of a cross section of experienced water managers using a set of carefully crafted questions. These questions covered water resources management, infrastructure resiliency and recommendations for inclusion in education and curriculum. We describe here the specifics of the survey and the results obtained in the form of statistical averages on the 'perception' of these managers. Finally, we discuss what these 'perception' averages may indicate to the ASCE TC and community as a whole for stewardship of the civil engineering profession. The survey and the responses gathered are not exhaustive nor do they represent the ASCE-endorsed viewpoint. However, the survey provides a critical first step to developing the framework of a research and education plan for ASCE. Given the Water Resources Reform and Development Act passed in 2014, we must now take into account the perceived concerns of the water management community."

The features of good targeting, optimal item infit and outfit, and no notable local dependence were found for each of the subscales. The rating scale was appropriate for the psychosocial subscale but a reduction to four response categories was required for the function subscale. No significant DIF were revealed for any demographic and clinical factors (e.g., age, gender, and strabismus types).The AS-20 was demonstrated by Rasch analysis to be a rigorous instrument for measuring health-related quality of life in Chinese strabismus patents if some revisions were made regarding the subscale construct and response options."

Microsatellites are the markers of choice for a variety of population genetic studies, and high quality markers can be discovered in non-model organisms, such as tuna, with these recent developments. Here, we use a high-throughput method to isolate microsatellite markers in albacore tuna, Thunnus alalunga, based on coupling multiplex enrichment and next-generation sequencing on 454 GS-FLX Titanium pyrosequencing. The crucial minimum number of polymorphic markers to infer evolutionary and ecological processes for this species has been described for the first time. We provide 1670 microsatellite design primer pairs, and technical and molecular genetics selection resulting in 43 polymorphic microsatellite markers. On this panel, we characterized 34 random and selectively neutral markers («neutral») and 9 «non-neutral» markers. The variability of «neutral» markers was screened with 136 individuals of albacore tuna from southwest Indian Ocean (42), northwest Indian Ocean (31), South Africa (31), and southeast Atlantic Ocean (32). Power analysis demonstrated that the panel of genetic markers can be applied in diversity and population genetics studies. Global genetic diversity for albacore was high with a mean number of alleles at 16.94; observed heterozygosity 66% and expected heterozygosity 77%. The number of individuals was insufficient to provide accurate results on differentiation. Of the 9 «non-neutral» markers, 3 were linked to a sequence of known function. The one is located to a sequence having an immunity function (ThuAla-Tcell-01) and the other to a sequence having energy allocation function (ThuAla-Hki-01). These two markers were genotyped on the 136 individuals and presented different diversity levels. ThuAla-Tcell-01 has a high number of alleles (20), heterozygosity (87-90%), and assignment index. ThuAla-Hki-01 has a lower number of alleles (9), low heterozygosity (24-27%), low assignment index and significant inbreeding. Finally, the 34 «neutral» and 3 «non-neutral» microsatellites markers were tested on four economically important Scombridae species-Thunnus albacares, Thunnus thynnus, Thunnus obesus, and Acanthocybium solandri."

Cytotoxic lymphocytes have the capacity to eliminate virally infected or otherwise compromised cells by releasing stored cytotoxins from granules and/or by engaging death receptors.

We find that perforin exhibits a complex binding mechanism, in which cooperation between monomers occurs during the binding process. Perforin binding and activity are enhanced if cholesterol is present in the membrane. Strikingly, we find that perforin binds membranes in the absence of calcium, and that the introduction of calcium to membrane-bound perforin results in perforin rearrangement in the membrane. The following reagents were used: 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) (catalog number 850345P, Avanti polar lipids); cholesterol (Chol) (catalog number C8667, Sigma-Aldrich); 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) (catalog number M5801, Sigma-Aldrich); 28% ammonium hydroxide solution (catalog number CAS 1336-21-6, Ajax Finechem); 30% hydrogen peroxide solution (catalog number 108597, Merck Millipore); CaCl2 (catalog number 10035-04-8, Ajax Finechem); HEPES (catalog number 7365-45-9, AMRESCO); EDTA (catalog number ED, Sigma-Aldrich); l-α-phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk (eggPC) (catalog number P3556, Sigma-Aldrich); methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) (Sigma-Aldrich); NaCl (catalog number 7647-14-5, AMRESCO); and Nystatin (Sigma-Aldrich). The following buffers were used: Hepes-buffered saline (HBS): 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl; HEPES-buffered saline with calcium (HBS-Ca2+): as above with 2 mm CaCl2; low salt buffer (LS): 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 30 mm NaCl; low salt buffer with calcium (LS-Ca2+): as per LS plus 2 mm calcium; HBS with EDTA: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA; HBSS: 10 mm HEPES, 0.2% (w/v) BSA in Hanks' balanced salts solution, pH 7.2; and HE: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.2% (w/v) BSA, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2. All buffers were prepared from double-distilled water (Milli-Q water) and then filtered through a 0.22-μm filter and degassed. Recombinant mouse perforin was produced as described previously (28Sutton V.R. Waterhouse N.J. Baran K. Browne K. Voskoboinik I. Trapani J.A.

The SLO expression plasmid, a gift from Prof. Bhakdi, was produced and purified as described previously (18Weller U. Müller L. Messner M. Palmer M. Valeva A. Tranum-Jensen J. Agrawal P. Biermann C.

Briefly, DMPC, eggPC, and cholesterol powder were dissolved to 5 mm stock solution in ethanol-free chloroform. Lipids were mixed at ratios of 40:60 (v/v) DMPC:Chol or 50:50 (v/v) eggPC:Chol. Chloroform was evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas, and remaining solvent was removed by a vacuum desiccator for 2 h. Lipids were then stored at −20 °C. On the day of use, lipids were rehydrated in 1 ml of HBS or HBS-Ca2+ to a final concentration of 0.5 mm at 37 °C for 1 h, vortexed for 2–5 min, and sonicated for 7 min 1–3 times at ∼50 °C. Liposome suspensions were stored at 4 °C for up to 7 days. Gold-coated sensors were cleaned by incubating in a solution of ammonium hydroxide:hydrogen peroxide:water (1:1:3 v/v) at 70 °C for 15–20 min as described previously (30Piantavigna S. McCubbin G.A.

The gold surface was then washed and modified with 1 mm MPA solution made up in propan-2-ol for at least 1 h at room temperature. QCM-D measurements were performed using an E4 system with flow cells (Q-Sense, Biolin Scientific, Gothenburg, Sweden) as described previously (21Stewart S.E. D'Angelo M.E. Piantavigna S. Tabor R.F.

Briefly, changes to the resonance frequency (Δf) and energy dissipation (ΔD) were measured simultaneously. All plots presented here are of the 7th harmonic unless stated. All experiments were conducted at 22 °C. A lipid bilayer was achieved by deposition of liposomes in HBS or HBS-Ca2+ until a change in frequency of 25–30 Hz (31Mechler A. Praporski S. Piantavigna S. Heaton S.M. Hall K.N. Aguilar M.I. Martin L.L. Structure and homogeneity of pseudo-physiological phospholipid bilayers and their deposition characteristics on carboxylic acid terminated self-assembled monolayers.Biomaterials. 2009; 30: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Lipid layers were washed with a low salt buffer (LS or LS-Ca2+) to encourage osmotic stress to burst any intact liposomes. After a baseline was established in the buffer, protein was added to the system at a rate of 50 μl/min. Once all the protein was used, the flow was stopped, and an equilibration period, with no flow, was monitored before a wash step was introduced to remove any unbound material from the surface with HBS or HBS-Ca2+ at 300–500 μl/min. Sheep erythrocytes were washed in 0.9% saline solution to remove any contaminating hemoglobin in the buffer. The erythrocytes were then counted and resuspended at 2 × 108 cells/ml. Perforin was serially diluted in HBS±Ca2+, and 2 × 107 cells were added to each dilution in a final volume of 200 μl. This was then incubated at 37 or 22 °C for 20 min, supernatant was collected, and its absorbance was measured at 405 nm to detect the release of hemoglobin. Jurkat cells were washed twice with HBSS and then resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in the same buffer. Cells were pretreated with 5 mm MβCD or nystatin for 30 min at 37 °C and then added to an equal volume of perforin diluted in HE with 5 mm MβCD or nystatin. Cell viability was determined by Trypan Blue dye exclusion following a further 30-min incubation at 37 °C. Change in mass (Δm) on the surface of the chip can be calculated according to the Sauerbrey equation (32Sauerbrey G. Verwendung von Schwingquarzen zur Wägung dünner Schichten und zur Mikrowägung.Z. Physik. 1959; 155: 206-222Crossref Scopus (9162) Google Scholar). Δm=-C(Δf/N)(Eq. 1) where C is the mass sensitivity constant (in this case 17.7 ng/cm2 for a chip with a fundamental frequency of 5 MHz), and N is the harmonic/overtone number (the 7th was used). The kinetic form of the Langmuir adsorption model provides the simplest descriptor for the dynamics of adsorption at a solid-solution interface (33Tabor R.F. Eastoe J. Dowding P.J. A two-step model for surfactant adsorption at solid surfaces.J. Colloid Interface Sci. 2010; 346: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Γmax=kads(1-θ)[M×Cb+kdesθ/kads(1-θ)+M]-kdesθ(Eq. 2) where Γmax is the maximum adsorbed material in mol/m2 (determined using the Sauerbrey equation for a saturating concentration), M is a mass transport factor that represents how quickly molecules can get to the surface in ms−1, kads is the rate of adsorption in ms−1, kdes is the rate of desorption in mol m−2 s−1, and Cb is the bulk concentration mol m−3. The fractional surface coverage, θ, is calculated by dividing the adsorbed amount at a given time and Γ(t) by the maximum adsorbed amount (Γmax). At low surface coverage, the adsorption process is assumed to be broadly controlled by diffusion of molecules to the surface, and so the initial slope of θ versus t, i.e. dθ/dt, is used to calibrate M (34Torn L.H. Koopal L.K. de Keizer A. Lyklema J. Adsorption of nonionic surfactants on cellulose surfaces: adsorbed amounts and kinetics.Langmuir. 2005; 21: 7768-7775Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To assess the binding and assembly of perforin, gold-coated sensors were modified with MPA and then treated with DMPC:Chol liposomes to form a lipid bilayer on each of the four sensors (31Mechler A. Praporski S. Piantavigna S. Heaton S.M. Hall K.N. Aguilar M.I. Martin L.L. Structure and homogeneity of pseudo-physiological phospholipid bilayers and their deposition characteristics on carboxylic acid terminated self-assembled monolayers.Biomaterials. 2009; 30: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A different concentration of perforin was introduced to each chamber, and changes in dissipation and frequency were monitored in real time. After the flow was stopped, changes in the dissipation and frequency were monitored for a further 20 min. An HBS-Ca2+ solution was introduced to remove non-specifically bound material. In this system, a decrease in frequency over time indicates that mass is accumulating on the surface of the lipid bilayer, and the change in frequency (Δf) is proportional to the accrued mass on the sensor according to the Sauerbrey equation (32Sauerbrey G. Verwendung von Schwingquarzen zur Wägung dünner Schichten und zur Mikrowägung.Z. Physik. 1959; 155: 206-222Crossref Scopus (9162) Google Scholar). Perforin showed a two-phase, concentration-dependent binding to the lipid layer (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, at higher concentrations (100 and 200 nm), Δf continued to increase after the flow of perforin-containing solution ceased. This was reproducible and may be due to a small amount of perforin binding during the equilibration period (as the chamber solution contains perforin). The perforin-lipid interaction appears to be very stable as there was no loss of mass evident during the subsequent wash step (Fig. 1A). Changes in dissipation (ΔD) in real time were also measured. Dissipation is a measure of the energy lost (dissipated) from the sensor. If the fluidity of the surface increases, it will be more energy-dissipating, and thus ΔD increases. By contrast, if the layer becomes more rigid, it will not absorb as much of the dissipating energy, and ΔD will remain constant or decrease. This allows us to assess how perforin changes the viscoelastic properties of the lipid layer, presumably as monomers oligomerize and insert. We observed a small initial increase in ΔD, followed by a decrease, and then finally a large and sustained increase, indicating that perforin binding and activity change the fluidity of the lipid layer in a multi-phase manner (Fig. 1A). Like Δf, ΔD also increased during the equilibration period, which indicates that protein already in the chamber continues to change the lipid layer. Perforin data plotted as Δf versus ΔD (Δf-ΔD or signature trace) show several transitions consistent with a multi-step process (Fig. 1B). The overall trend is upward and toward the right and is indicative of protein-protein and/or protein-lipid organization (35McCubbin G.A. Praporski S. Piantavigna S. Knappe D. Hoffmann R. Bowie J.H. Separovic F. Martin L.L. QCM-D fingerprinting of membrane-active peptides.Eur. Biophys. J. 2011; 40: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 36Praporski S. Ng S.M. Nguyen A.D. Corbin C.J. Mechler A. Zheng J. Conley A.J. Martin L.L. Organization of cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in sex steroid synthesis: protein-protein interactions in lipid membranes.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 33224-33232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The Δf-ΔD profile is complex and suggests that there are several processes occurring. Attributing specific steps to events or pore formation is difficult. However, along with protein-protein associations, there are regions where the Δf-ΔD trace reflects a decrease (or no change) in ΔD during an increase in Δf. These features indicate that the membrane is more rigid, possibly be due to protein insertion into the membrane and/or conformational changes in the protein structure. To further analyze changes in the frequency and dissipation data, the first derivative was analyzed for the concentrations of perforin shown in Fig. 1A. The first derivative emphasizes changes in the gradient of the frequency and dissipation. These changes reflect specific kinetic events during protein binding to the membrane, conformational changes to the protein on the membrane, or in some cases other effects such as densification or solvation. The first derivative of the frequency data (Δf′) shows two minima, indicating that two events occur as perforin interacts with membrane. The first minimum appears to become saturated at 100 nm perforin as there is no further increase in the rate with 200 nm perforin. The second minimum is strongly concentration-dependent and does not reach saturation (Fig. 1C). Similarly, the first derivative of ΔD (ΔD′) also shows two maxima and a minimum, which indicates that the viscoelasticity of the composite layer is changing due to perforin (Fig. 1C). A simple interpretation of the above results is that the first event represents initial binding of perforin monomers to the bilayer until a critical concentration is reached, which leads to the second, more rapid, event reflecting reor"

https://openalex.org/W2153276823,"Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) is a significant public health problem and the diagnosis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)—infected individuals is challenging. The use of mycobacterial culture remains an important complementary tool and optimizing it has important benefits. We sought to determine the effect of an increase in the number of specimens evaluated, addition of nutritional supplementation to the culture medium, sputum appearance and volume on diagnostic yield and time to detection of pulmonary TB among smear-negative, HIV-infected adults. Methods In this prospective study conducted at the Tshwane District Hospital and Academic TB Laboratory, Pretoria, South Africa we collected three sputum specimens an hour apart from presumptive TB cases at an antiretroviral treatment site. We analysed specimens from 236 patients. Specimen appearance and volume were recorded. All specimens were processed for culture using both standard and supplemented media. Results A single specimen identified 79% of PTB cases using standard media; the second and third specimens added 12.5% and 8.3% respectively. Media supplementation, sputum appearance and specimen volume had no effect on culture yield or contamination rates. The mean time to detection was reduced from 19.8 days in standard cultures to 11.8 days in nutrient supplemented cultures (p = 0.002). For every 1 ml increase in sputum volume, time to detection was decreased by a factor of 0.797 (p = 0.011). Conclusion Use of an inexpensive culture supplement substantially reduced time to detection and could contribute to reducing treatment delay among HIV-infected cases."
