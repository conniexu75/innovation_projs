https://openalex.org/W1976143157,"One of the most intriguing phenomena in physics is the localization of waves in disordered media. This phenomenon was originally predicted by Anderson, fifty years ago, in the context of transport of electrons in crystals. Anderson localization is actually a much more general phenomenon, and it has been observed in a large variety of systems, including light waves. However, it has never been observed directly for matter waves. Ultracold atoms open a new scenario for the study of disorder-induced localization, due to high degree of control of most of the system parameters, including interaction. Here we employ for the first time a noninteracting Bose-Einstein condensate to study Anderson localization. The experiment is performed with a onedimensional quasi-periodic lattice, a system which features a crossover between extended and exponentially localized states as in the case of purely random disorder in higher dimensions. Localization is clearly demonstrated by investigating transport properties, spatial and momentum distributions. We characterize the crossover, finding that the critical disorder strength scales with the tunnelling energy of the atoms in the lattice. Since the interaction in the condensate can be controlled at will, this system might be employed to solve open questions on the interplay of disorder and interaction and to explore exotic quantum phases."
https://openalex.org/W2155224358,"In 1958, Anderson predicted the localization of electronic wavefunctions in disordered crystals and the resulting absence of diffusion. It is now recognized that Anderson localization is ubiquitous in wave physics because it originates from the interference between multiple scattering paths. Experimentally, localization has been reported for light waves, microwaves, sound waves and electron gases. However, there has been no direct observation of exponential spatial localization of matter waves of any type. Here we observe exponential localization of a Bose-Einstein condensate released into a one-dimensional waveguide in the presence of a controlled disorder created by laser speckle. We operate in a regime of pure Anderson localization, that is, with weak disorder-such that localization results from many quantum reflections of low amplitude-and an atomic density low enough to render interactions negligible. We directly image the atomic density profiles as a function of time, and find that weak disorder can stop the expansion and lead to the formation of a stationary, exponentially localized wavefunction-a direct signature of Anderson localization. We extract the localization length by fitting the exponential wings of the profiles, and compare it to theoretical calculations. The power spectrum of the one-dimensional speckle potentials has a high spatial frequency cutoff, causing exponential localization to occur only when the de Broglie wavelengths of the atoms in the expanding condensate are greater than an effective mobility edge corresponding to that cutoff. In the opposite case, we find that the density profiles decay algebraically, as predicted in ref. 13. The method presented here can be extended to localization of atomic quantum gases in higher dimensions, and with controlled interactions."
https://openalex.org/W4251765607,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that participate in the spatiotemporal regulation of messenger RNA and protein synthesis. Aberrant miRNA expression leads to developmental abnormalities and diseases, such as cardiovascular disorders and cancer; however, the stimuli and processes regulating miRNA biogenesis are largely unknown. The transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family of growth factors orchestrates fundamental biological processes in development and in the homeostasis of adult tissues, including the vasculature. Here we show that induction of a contractile phenotype in human vascular smooth muscle cells by TGF-β and BMPs is mediated by miR-21. miR-21 downregulates PDCD4 (programmed cell death 4), which in turn acts as a negative regulator of smooth muscle contractile genes. Surprisingly, TGF-β and BMP signalling promotes a rapid increase in expression of mature miR-21 through a post-transcriptional step, promoting the processing of primary transcripts of miR-21 (pri-miR-21) into precursor miR-21 (pre-miR-21) by the DROSHA (also known as RNASEN) complex. TGF-β- and BMP-specific SMAD signal transducers are recruited to pri-miR-21 in a complex with the RNA helicase p68 (also known as DDX5), a component of the DROSHA microprocessor complex. The shared cofactor SMAD4 is not required for this process. Thus, regulation of miRNA biogenesis by ligand-specific SMAD proteins is critical for control of the vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype and potentially for SMAD4-independent responses mediated by the TGF-β and BMP signalling pathways. Abnormal microRNA (miRNA) processing is a contributing factor in development of cardiovascular disorders and cancer. In this work, SMAD proteins, which act as signalling molecules for the TGFβ/BMP family of growth factors, are found to have an additional role as regulators of miRNA processing. In human vascular smooth muscle cells, the induction of contractility by TGF-β/BMP is mediated by miR-21. The SMAD proteins promote enhanced processing of miR-21 from a primary copy of RNA (pri-miRNA) to precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) form. This occurs through a direct interaction of the SMAD proteins with the DROSHA miRNA processing complex. This work opens new avenues in the study of TGF-β family signalling pathways and miRNA biogenesis regulation. Some of the TGF-β family of growth factors are responsible for contractility in vascular smooth muscle cells. This paper demonstrates that in response to ligand, TGF-β and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) promote the processing of a microRNA, miR-21, which regulates several genes involved in contractility. This occurs through a direct interaction of TGF-β and BMP with the DROSHA miRNA processing complex."
https://openalex.org/W2093534366,"Animals from flies to humans are able to distinguish subtle gradations in temperature and show strong temperature preferences. Animals move to environments of optimal temperature and some manipulate the temperature of their surroundings, as humans do using clothing and shelter. Despite the ubiquitous influence of environmental temperature on animal behaviour, the neural circuits and strategies through which animals select a preferred temperature remain largely unknown. Here we identify a small set of warmth-activated anterior cell (AC) neurons located in the Drosophila brain, the function of which is critical for preferred temperature selection. AC neuron activation occurs just above the fly's preferred temperature and depends on dTrpA1, an ion channel that functions as a molecular sensor of warmth. Flies that selectively express dTrpA1 in the AC neurons select normal temperatures, whereas flies in which dTrpA1 function is reduced or eliminated choose warmer temperatures. This internal warmth-sensing pathway promotes avoidance of slightly elevated temperatures and acts together with a distinct pathway for cold avoidance to set the fly's preferred temperature. Thus, flies select a preferred temperature by using a thermal sensing pathway tuned to trigger avoidance of temperatures that deviate even slightly from the preferred temperature. This provides a potentially general strategy for robustly selecting a narrow temperature range optimal for survival."
https://openalex.org/W2118926211,"Innate immune defences are essential for the control of virus infection and are triggered through host recognition of viral macromolecular motifs known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an RNA virus that replicates in the liver, and infects 200 million people worldwide. Infection is regulated by hepatic immune defences triggered by the cellular RIG-I helicase. RIG-I binds PAMP RNA and signals interferon regulatory factor 3 activation to induce the expression of interferon-alpha/beta and antiviral/interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that limit infection. Here we identify the polyuridine motif of the HCV genome 3' non-translated region and its replication intermediate as the PAMP substrate of RIG-I, and show that this and similar homopolyuridine or homopolyriboadenine motifs present in the genomes of RNA viruses are the chief feature of RIG-I recognition and immune triggering in human and murine cells. 5' terminal triphosphate on the PAMP RNA was necessary but not sufficient for RIG-I binding, which was primarily dependent on homopolymeric ribonucleotide composition, linear structure and length. The HCV PAMP RNA stimulated RIG-I-dependent signalling to induce a hepatic innate immune response in vivo, and triggered interferon and ISG expression to suppress HCV infection in vitro. These results provide a conceptual advance by defining specific homopolymeric RNA motifs within the genome of HCV and other RNA viruses as the PAMP substrate of RIG-I, and demonstrate immunogenic features of the PAMP-RIG-I interaction that could be used as an immune adjuvant for vaccine and immunotherapy approaches."
https://openalex.org/W1861730929,"One promising approach to Alzheimer's disease treatment involves the use of drugs to reduce the rate of deposition of Aβ42, the 42-residue form of amyloid-β peptide, by curbing its generation. Certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs known as γ-secretase modulators or GSMs, including ibuprofen and sulindac, have this capacity but how they work is unclear. Now their target has been identified as a site on Aβ42 itself — rather than the presenilins or a core β-secretase component. By binding to Aβ42 these drugs inhibit not only its rate of production but also its aggregation. Selective lowering of Aβ42 levels (the 42-residue isoform of the amyloid-β peptide) with small-molecule γ-secretase modulators (GSMs), such as some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, is a promising therapeutic approach for Alzheimer’s disease1. To identify the target of these agents we developed biotinylated photoactivatable GSMs. GSM photoprobes did not label the core proteins of the γ-secretase complex, but instead labelled the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), APP carboxy-terminal fragments and amyloid-β peptide in human neuroglioma H4 cells. Substrate labelling was competed by other GSMs, and labelling of an APP γ-secretase substrate was more efficient than a Notch substrate. GSM interaction was localized to residues 28–36 of amyloid-β, a region critical for aggregation. We also demonstrate that compounds known to interact with this region of amyloid-β act as GSMs, and some GSMs alter the production of cell-derived amyloid-β oligomers. Furthermore, mutation of the GSM binding site in the APP alters the sensitivity of the substrate to GSMs. These findings indicate that substrate targeting by GSMs mechanistically links two therapeutic actions: alteration in Aβ42 production and inhibition of amyloid-β aggregation, which may synergistically reduce amyloid-β deposition in Alzheimer’s disease. These data also demonstrate the existence and feasibility of ‘substrate targeting’ by small-molecule effectors of proteolytic enzymes, which if generally applicable may significantly broaden the current notion of ‘druggable’ targets2."

https://openalex.org/W2004211429,"Background Many of the processes affecting genetic diversity act on local populations. However, studies of plant nucleotide diversity have largely ignored local sampling, making it difficult to infer the demographic history of populations and to assess the importance of local adaptation. Arabidopsis lyrata, a self-incompatible, perennial species with a circumpolar distribution, is an excellent model system in which to study the roles of demographic history and local adaptation in patterning genetic variation. Principal Findings We studied nucleotide diversity in six natural populations of Arabidopsis lyrata, using 77 loci sampled from 140 chromosomes. The six populations were highly differentiated, with a median FST of 0.52, and structure analysis revealed no evidence of admixed individuals. Average within-population diversity varied among populations, with the highest diversity found in a German population; this population harbors 3-fold higher levels of silent diversity than worldwide samples of A. thaliana. All A. lyrata populations also yielded positive values of Tajima's D. We estimated a demographic model for these populations, finding evidence of population divergence over the past 19,000 to 47,000 years involving non-equilibrium demographic events that reduced the effective size of most populations. Finally, we used the inferred demographic model to perform an initial test for local adaptation and identified several genes, including the flowering time gene FCA and a disease resistance locus, as candidates for local adaptation events. Conclusions Our results underscore the importance of population-specific, non-equilibrium demographic processes in patterning diversity within A. lyrata. Moreover, our extensive dataset provides an important resource for future molecular population genetic studies of local adaptation in A. lyrata."

https://openalex.org/W2048834380,"Uganda recently adopted artemether-lumefantrine (AL) as the recommended first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. However, AL has several limitations, including a twice-daily dosing regimen, recommendation for administration with fatty food, and a high risk of reinfection soon after therapy in high transmission areas. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) is a new alternative artemisinin-based combination therapy that is dosed once daily and has a long post-treatment prophylactic effect. We compared the efficacy and safety of AL with DP in Kanungu, an area of moderate malaria transmission.Patients aged 6 months to 10 years with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were randomized to therapy and followed for 42 days. Genotyping was used to distinguish recrudescence from new infection. Of 414 patients enrolled, 408 completed follow-up. Compared to patients treated with artemether-lumefantrine, patients treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine had a significantly lower risk of recurrent parasitaemia (33.2% vs. 12.2%; risk difference = 20.9%, 95% CI 13.0-28.8%) but no statistically significant difference in the risk of treatment failure due to recrudescence (5.8% vs. 2.0%; risk difference = 3.8%, 95% CI -0.2-7.8%). Patients treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine also had a lower risk of developing gametocytaemia after therapy (4.2% vs. 10.6%, p = 0.01). Both drugs were safe and well tolerated.DP is highly efficacious, and operationally preferable to AL because of a less intensive dosing schedule and requirements. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine should be considered for a role in the antimalarial treatment policy of Uganda.Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN75606663."

https://openalex.org/W2004573656,"Integration of the double-stranded DNA copy of the HIV-1 genome into host chromosomal DNA is a requirement for efficient viral replication. Integration preferentially occurs within active transcription units, however chromosomal site specificity does not correlate with any strong primary sequence. To investigate whether the nuclear architecture may affect viral integration we have developed an experimental system where HIV-1 viral particles can be visualized within the nuclear compartment. Fluorescently labeled HIV-1 virions were engineered by fusing integrase, the viral protein that catalyzes the integration reaction, to fluorescent proteins. Viral tests demonstrate that the infectivity of fluorescent virions, including the integration step, is not altered as compared to wild-type virus. 3-D confocal microscopy allowed a detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal distribution of the pre-integration complexes (PICs) within the nucleus at different moments following infection; the fluorescently labeled PICs preferentially distribute in decondensed areas of the chromatin with a striking positioning in the nuclear periphery, while heterochromatin regions are largely disfavored. These observations provide a first indication of how the nuclear architecture may initially orient the selection of retroviral integration sites."

https://openalex.org/W2026523028,"Heparanase is a heparan sulfate (HS) degrading endoglycosidase participating in extracellular matrix degradation and remodeling. Apart of its well characterized enzymatic activity, heparanase was noted to exert also enzymatic-independent functions. Non-enzymatic activities of heparanase include enhanced adhesion of tumor-derived cells and primary T-cells. Attempting to identify functional domains of heparanase that would serve as targets for drug development, we have identified heparin binding domains of heparanase. A corresponding peptide (residues Lys(158)-Asp(171), termed KKDC) was demonstrated to physically associate with heparin and HS, and to inhibit heparanase enzymatic activity. We hypothesized that the pro-adhesive properties of heparanase are mediated by its interaction with cell surface HS proteoglycans, and utilized the KKDC peptide to examine this possibility. We provide evidence that the KKDC peptide interacts with cell membrane HS, resulting in clustering of syndecan-1 and syndecan-4. We applied classical analysis of cell morphology, fluorescent and time-lapse microscopy and demonstrated that the KKDC peptide efficiently stimulates the adhesion and spreading of various cell types, mediated by PKC, Src, and the small GTPase Rac1. These results support, and further substantiate the notion that heparanase function is not limited to its enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2062167680,"We report results from the analysis of complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from 112 Japanese semi-supercentenarians (aged above 105 years) combined with previously published data from 96 patients in each of three non-disease phenotypes: centenarians (99-105 years of age), healthy non-obese males, obese young males and four disease phenotypes, diabetics with and without angiopathy, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease patients. We analyze the correlation between mitochondrial polymorphisms and the longevity phenotype using two different methods. We first use an exhaustive algorithm to identify all maximal patterns of polymorphisms shared by at least five individuals and define a significance score for enrichment of the patterns in each phenotype relative to healthy normals. Our study confirms the correlations observed in a previous study showing enrichment of a hierarchy of haplogroups in the D clade for longevity. For the extreme longevity phenotype we see a single statistically significant signal: a progressive enrichment of certain ""beneficial"" patterns in centenarians and semi-supercentenarians in the D4a haplogroup. We then use Principal Component Spectral Analysis of the SNP-SNP Covariance Matrix to compare the measured eigenvalues to a Null distribution of eigenvalues on Gaussian datasets to determine whether the correlations in the data (due to longevity) arises from some property of the mutations themselves or whether they are due to population structure. The conclusion is that the correlations are entirely due to population structure (phylogenetic tree). We find no signal for a functional mtDNA SNP correlated with longevity. The fact that the correlations are from the population structure suggests that hitch-hiking on autosomal events is a possible explanation for the observed correlations."
https://openalex.org/W1994012027,"Viruses adapt to their hosts by evading defense mechanisms and taking over cellular metabolism for their own benefit. Alterations in cell metabolism as well as side-effects of antiviral responses contribute to symptoms development and virulence. Sometimes, a virus may spill over from its usual host species into a novel one, where usually will fail to successfully infect and further transmit to new host. However, in some cases, the virus transmits and persists after fixing beneficial mutations that allow for a better exploitation of the new host. This situation would represent a case for a new emerging virus. Here we report results from an evolution experiment in which a plant virus was allowed to infect and evolve on a naïve host. After 17 serial passages, the viral genome has accumulated only five changes, three of which were non-synonymous. An amino acid substitution in the viral VPg protein was responsible for the appearance of symptoms, whereas one substitution in the viral P3 protein the epistatically contributed to exacerbate severity. DNA microarray analyses show that the evolved and ancestral viruses affect the global patterns of host gene expression in radically different ways. A major difference is that genes involved in stress and pathogen response are not activated upon infection with the evolved virus, suggesting that selection has favored viral strategies to escape from host defenses."
https://openalex.org/W2041973398,"Eye gaze is an important social cue which is used to determine another person's focus of attention and intention to communicate. In combination with a fearful facial expression eye gaze can also signal threat in the environment. The ability to detect and understand others' social signals is essential in order to avoid danger and enable social evaluation. It has been a matter of debate when infants are able to use gaze cues and emotional facial expressions in reference to external objects. Here we demonstrate that by 3 months of age the infant brain differentially responds to objects as a function of how other people are reacting to them. Using event-related electrical brain potentials (ERPs), we show that an indicator of infants' attention is enhanced by an adult's expression of fear toward an unfamiliar object. The infant brain showed an increased Negative central (Nc) component toward objects that had been previously cued by an adult's eye gaze and frightened facial expression. Our results further suggest that infants' sensitivity cannot be due to a general arousal elicited by a frightened face with eye gaze directed at an object. The neural attention system of 3 month old infants is sensitive to an adult's eye gaze direction in combination with a fearful expression. This early capacity may lay the foundation for the development of more sophisticated social skills such as social referencing, language, and theory of mind."

Mutations in the connection domain of HIV-1 RT can augment AZT resistance. It has been suggested that these mutations compromise RNase H cleavage, providing more time for AZT excision to occur. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we focused on connection mutations N348I and A360V that are frequently observed in clinical samples of treatment-experienced patients. We show that both N348I and A360V, in combination with TAMs, decrease the efficiency of RNase H cleavage and increase excision of AZT in the presence of the pyrophosphate donor ATP. The TAMs/N348I/A360V mutant accumulates transiently formed, shorter hybrids that can rebind to RT before the template is irreversibly degraded. These hybrids dissociate selectively from the RNase H-competent complex, whereas binding in the polymerase-competent mode is either not affected with N348I or modestly improved with A360V. Both connection domain mutations can compensate for TAM-mediated deficits in processive DNA synthesis, and experiments with RNase H negative mutant enzymes confirm an RNase H-independent contribution to increased levels of resistance to AZT. Moreover, the combination of diminished RNase H cleavage and increased processivity renders the use of both PPi and ATP advantageous, whereas classic TAMs solely enhance the ATP-dependent reaction. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that distinct, complementary mechanisms can contribute to higher levels of excision of AZT, which in turn can amplify resistance to this drug.

Approved RT inhibitors belong to two distinct classes: nucleoside analogue and nonnucleoside analogue RT inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs, respectively). NRTIs are synthetic derivatives of the natural deoxynucleosides. The triphosphate forms of NRTIs and cellular dNTPs serve as substrates for HIV-1 RT. In contrast to natural dNTPs, NRTIs lack the 3′-hydroxyl group of the sugar moiety. The incorporated monophosphate (MP) therefore acts as a chain terminator, which prevents phosphodiester bond formation with the next complementary nucleotide (6El Safadi Y. Vivet-Boudou V. Marquet R. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2007; 75: 723-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). NNRTIs are structurally diverse, and members of this family of compounds bind to a hydrophobic pocket (NNRTI-binding pocket) near the polymerase active site to act as allosteric inhibitors by blocking the chemical step (7Basavapathruni A.

Most importantly, many of these mutations, including mutations N348I, A360I/V, and A371V, in the connection domain of HIV-1 RT were identified in clinical samples of HIV-infected individuals. In addition, A371V and Q509L in the RNase H domain emerge under the selective pressure of AZT in cell culture (28Brehm J.H. Koontz D. Meteer J.D. Pathak V. Sluis-Cremer N. Mellors J.W. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 7852-7859Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The rare G333D/E polymorphisms have been associated with dual resistance to AZT and other NRTIs (29Zelina S. Sheen C.W.

Most mutations in the C-terminal domains of HIV-1 RT increase resistance to AZT in conjunction with classic TAMs. Nikolenko et al. (32Nikolenko G.N. Palmer S. Maldarelli F. Mellors J.W. Coffin J.M. Pathak V.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2093-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) postulated that AZT-mediated chain termination might be permanent when the RT-associated RNase H activity has completely degraded the template strand. Conversely, AZT resistance could be enhanced by diminishing RNase H cleavage, because the increase in the half-life of the RNA template provides more time for excision to occur (32Nikolenko G.N. Palmer S. Maldarelli F. Mellors J.W. Coffin J.M. Pathak V.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2093-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A recent study on N348I provided evidence to link diminished RNase H cleavage and increased rates of excision (26Yap S.H. Sheen C.W. Fahey J. Zanin M. Tyssen D. Lima V.D. Wynhoven B. Kuiper M. Sluis-Cremer N. Harrigan P.R. Tachedjian G. PLoS Med. 2007; 4: 1887-1900Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Additionally, RNase H-independent contributions to resistance may not be excluded, although increases in excision were exclusively observed with DNA·RNA substrates and not with DNA′DNA (26Yap S.H. Sheen C.W. Fahey J. Zanin M. Tyssen D. Lima V.D. Wynhoven B. Kuiper M. Sluis-Cremer N. Harrigan P.R. Tachedjian G. PLoS Med. 2007; 4: 1887-1900Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To address this problem, we have focused on the study of connection domain mutations A360V and N348I. The combined mutations were shown to cause marked increases in resistance to AZT, predominantly when present against a background of TAMs (33Nikolenko G.N. Delviks-Frankenberry K.A. Palmer S. Maldarelli F. Fivash Jr., M.J. Coffin J.M. Pathak V.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). N348I was also shown to confer low level resistance to AZT and NNRTIs in the absence of TAMs (26Yap S.H. Sheen C.W. Fahey J. Zanin M. Tyssen D. Lima V.D. Wynhoven B. Kuiper M. Sluis-Cremer N. Harrigan P.R. Tachedjian G. PLoS Med. 2007; 4: 1887-1900Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A360 is part of the RNase H primer grip motif that interacts with the nucleic acid substrate (34Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), whereas most other resistance-associated residues in the connection domain are not in contact with the substrate. Here we show that N348I and A360V compromise binding of transiently formed DNA·RNA hybrids selectively in the context of RNase H-competent complexes. Moreover, the mutant enzymes increase processive DNA synthesis and retain their ability to augment excision of AZT-MP against an RNase H-negative background in HIV-1 RT. Thus, connection domain mutations increase AZT resistance through both RNase H-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Prevalence and Resistance Correlates of Connection Domain Mutations—Amino acid substitutions in the connection domain of HIV-1 RT potentially associated with exposure to antiretroviral therapy were identified by determining the prevalence of substitutions in a total of 4208 individuals in British Columbia, Canada. This included 1606 treatment-naive individuals at the time of genotypic testing. In addition, genotype data from a further 2422 treatment-experienced individuals was available. Enzymes and Nucleic Acids—Heterodimeric HIV-1 RT (p66 and p51) were expressed and purified as previously described (35Le Grice S.F. Gruninger-Leitch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Mutant enzymes were generated through site-directed mutagenesis with the Stratagene QuikChange™ kit using the manufacturer's protocol. “WT RT” refers to the wild type enzyme, and “TAMs” refers to mutants that contain the following amino acid substitutions: M41L, D67N, L210W, and T215Y. This cluster is associated with high levels of resistance to AZT. TAMs/A360V contains in addition to these four changes the A360V connection domain mutation. The same nomenclature is applied to the other mutants used in this study: TAMs/N348I and TAMs/A360V/N348I. TAMs/E478Q and TAMs/A360V/N348I/E478Q are equivalent, RNase H-negative mutants (supplemental Fig. S1A). Nucleic acid substrates used in this study were derived from the HIV-1 primer binding site (PBS) region. RNA and DNA oligonucleotides used in this study were chemically synthesized and obtained from Invitrogen (supplemental Fig. S1B). The long RNA template PBS-250 was generated through in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (36Arts E.J. Li X. Gu Z. Kleiman L. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14672-14680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleic acid substrates were 32P-radiolabeled essentially as described previously (37Marchand B. Gotte M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35362-35372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5′-end labeling was performed with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas). Reactions were allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C. Labeled DNA or RNA was purified on 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 50 mm Tris borate, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 7 m urea and then eluted overnight in a buffer containing 500 mm ammonium acetate and 0.1% SDS. Multisite AZT-MP Excision and DNA Synthesis Assay—20 nm 5′-radiolabeled DNA primer PBS-28 (5′-CTTTCAGGTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCACTG-3′) was annealed to a 3-fold molar excess of complementary PBS-250 (as described above). In order to form the DNA·RNA hybrid duplex, the nucleic acid substrates were hybridized, in the presence of 50 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, by heating at 95 °C for 3 min followed by a gradual decrease to room temperature for 45 min. The hybridized DNA·RNA substrate was then incubated in a buffer containing 50 mm NaCl and Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 μm EDTA, 2 μm of each of the four dNTPs, 2 μm AZT-TP, and 400 nm RT (WT or mutant). Pyrophosphatase-treated ATP was added at a final concentration of 3.5 mm to each sample. 50 μm PPi was added in PPi-mediated excision reactions. Incorporation and excision of AZT-MP was initiated by the addition of 6 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped at various time points with 95% formamide containing trace amounts of xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue. Samples were resolved on a 12% polyacrylamide denaturing gel and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) using Quantity One and ImageQuant software. Enzyme Processivity—The reaction mixture was prepared as described above, without the addition of AZT-TP, ATP, or PPi. To ensure single turnover conditions, DNA synthesis was initiated in the presence of 2 mg/ml heparin (Bioshop) together with 6 mm MgCl2. Reactions were stopped at different time points. The amount of the full-length product (P), as well as the amount of the remaining, nonextended substrate (S) was measured after 3 h. Also, the total substrate (TS) was quantified as represented in the control reaction in the absence of MgCl2. The fraction of competent complex was derived from the term 1 - S/TS). This represents the fraction of enzyme-substrate complexes available for extension at equilibrium prior to initiation. The fraction of “processive complex” (i.e. the complexes that did not dissociate before the enzyme had reached the 5′-end of the template) was derived from the ratio P/TS. Therefore, the term (P/TS)/(1 - S/TS) or P/TS - S defines enzyme processivity, expressed as percentage of processive complex (see Table 4).TABLE 4Processivity valuesEnzymeProcessive complexaEnzyme processivity is expressed as “percentage of processive complex” as described under “Experimental Procedures.”%WT2.77TAMs2.09TAMs/A360V3.00TAMs/N34815.36TAMs/A360V/N34816.36a Enzyme processivity is expressed as “percentage of processive complex” as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab RNase H Activity—The 5′-radiolabeled RNA template was heat-annealed to a 2-fold molar excess of the complementary DNA primer to form the DNA·RNA substrate, as described above. 100 nm of the preformed substrate was incubated with 200 nm RT in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, and 100 μm EDTA. The reaction was started with 6 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C. RNase H cleavage was monitored over time, with reactions stopped and analyzed as described above. Band Shift Experiments—50 nm 5′-radiolabeled DNA primer (3′-CACCGCGGGCTTGTCCCTGGA-5′) was annealed to a 2-fold molar excess of a complementary 52-nucleotide RNA template (5′-GGAAAUCUCUAGCAGUGGCGCCCGAACAGGGACCUGAAAGCGAAAGGGAAAC-3′). The hybrid formed consists of a 21-bp double-stranded region with a 17-nucleotide-long overhang at the template 3′-end. As such, it will be referred to as the “21-bp hybrid duplex.” The hybrid was incubated with 100 nm WT RT and TAMs/A360V/N348I, respectively, in a buffer containing 50 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. RNase H cleavage was initiated at 37 °C after the addition of 6 mm MgCl2. Samples were loaded at various time points on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and analyzed as described above. Single Nucleotide Excision/Rescue Assay—A 5-fold molar excess of RT (250 nm final concentration) was incubated with the 12-bp duplex hybrid containing a purified primer chain-terminated with AZT or d4T, as described (38Gotte M. Arion D. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3579-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). 3.5 mm pyrophosphatase-treated ATP, 10 μm dTTP, 10 μm dGTP, and 20 μm ddCTP were also added to monitor rescue of AZT-terminated DNA synthesis. The combined excision of AZT-MP and rescue of DNA synthesis was allowed to proceed at 37 °C over time (up to 90 min). Excision products were separated by 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The results were quantified and plotted with Prism 4.0 software using the one-phase exponential association formula. Substrate Binding—The equilibrium dissociation constant for polymerase-competent complexes (Kd(pol)) was measured on the basis of published protocols (39Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Lanchy J.M. Ehresmann C. Le Grice S.F. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7178-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, the amount of product generated during a single turnover was quantified and plotted versus DNA·RNA substrate concentrations. Data points were fitted to the quadratic equation as described (35Le Grice S.F. Gruninger-Leitch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), which provides Kd(pol) values for the active RT·DNA·RNA binary complex. This analysis also determines the maximum concentration of the binary complex that is competent for nucleotide incorporation at saturating concentrations of DNA·RNA substrate, which is equivalent to the concentration of active enzyme. Initial experiments were therefore used to determine the amount of enzyme that was required to generate 150 nm maximum product for wild type and mutants. Briefly, the 5′-radiolabeled DNA primer (5′ AGGTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCAC-3′) was used to form either a 15-bp hybrid duplex with the RNA template (5′ ggaaaucucuagcaguggcgcccgaacag-3′) or a 21-bp hybrid duplex with RNA template (5′-ggaaaucucuagcaguggcgcccgaacagggacct-3′). The substrate was incubated with RT in a buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 100 μm EDTA. The concentration of the substrate ranged from 17 to 1000 nm, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 6 mm MgCl2, 20 μm dTTP, and 2 mg/ml heparin trap. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and analyzed as described above. A similar protocol was applied to measure the equilibrium dissociation constant for RNase H-competent complexes (Kd(RNase H)). In this case, we utilized 5′-end-labeled RNA templates and initiated the reaction in the absence of nucleotide substrate. The data were quantified using ImageQuant 5.2 and analyzed using Prism 4.0. In Vivo Prevalence of A360V—The in vivo prevalence of mutations in the connection domain of RT was studied in a large cohort of individuals from British Columbia, Canada, as a function of exposure to antiretroviral selection pressure. The populations studied included both treatment-experienced (n = 2422) and treatment-naive (n = 1606) individuals. Several positions in the connection domain, in particular Asn348 and Ala360, showed large increases in prevalence of amino acid substitutions in the treatment-experienced population (Table 1). Substitutions at codon 348 increased in prevalence from 0.8% in the untreated population to over 12.1% in the treatment-experienced populations (26Yap S.H. Sheen C.W. Fahey J. Zanin M. Tyssen D. Lima V.D. Wynhoven B. Kuiper M. Sluis-Cremer N. Harrigan P.R. Tachedjian G. PLoS Med. 2007; 4: 1887-1900Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar), whereas those at position 360 increased in prevalence from 21.4% to over 28.8%, suggesting a significant selective advantage. The increase in prevalence at codon 360 was driven in part by a modest increase in the prevalence of a common polymorphism A360T, but predominantly by an increase in the A360V substitution. Like the N348I mutation, A360V was observed in less than 1% of the untreated population (n = 15 of 1606) and increased to 8.5% after treatment (n = 205 of 2422). Other mutations (A360I and A360S) were observed only rarely. Furthermore, A360V was highly correlated with various mutations considered to be part of the TAMs cluster; for example, of the samples with A360V, 35% were associated with M41L, 21% with D67N, 30% with K70R, 17% with L210W, 42% with T215Y/F, and 17% with K219Q/E. In contrast, less than 20% of samples with the A360T had TAMs. A360V usually appeared late in therapy, on average 2.5 years after the onset of antiretroviral treatment, and typically appeared after TAMs selection. The A360V mutation appeared in over 120 TAM contexts, but the most common TAM patterns in which it appeared consisted of M41L/215Y or M41L/L210W/T215Y.TABLE 1Prevalence of mutations in the connection domain of RT in treated and untreated individualsRT codonPrevalence (untreated)aThe prevalence (in percentage) of amino acid substitutions in the HIV-1 RT from treatment-naive individuals (n = 1606).Prevalence (treated)bPrevalence (percentage) of amino acid substitutions in the HIV-1 RT from treatment-experienced individuals (n = 2422).Increase in prevalence%%%27752.9359.836.9028627.2732.725.452889.5314.104.573480.8012.1011.3035619.1227.188.073585.4210.855.433598.9016.367.4636021.3628.827.473715.3512.667.3138613.2618.004.74a The prevalence (in percentage) of amino acid substitutions in the HIV-1 RT from treatment-naive individuals (n = 1606).b Prevalence (percentage) of amino acid substitutions in the HIV-1 RT from treatment-experienced individuals (n = 2422). Open table in a new tab Connection Domain Mutations A360V and N348I Increase ATP-mediated Excision on DNA·RNA Substrates—The combination of A360V and N348I, when present against a background of TAMs was shown to amplify resistance to AZT but not to d4T (33Nikolenko G.N. Delviks-Frankenberry K.A. Palmer S. Maldarelli F. Fivash Jr., M.J. Coffin J.M. Pathak V.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The crucial role played by TAMs suggests that the combination of TAMs and connection domain mutations further increase efficiency of ATP-mediated AZT-MP excision. To address this question directly, we monitored DNA synthesis in the presence of AZT-TP and ATP on a relatively long RNA template that allows polymerization of 185 nucleotides. The reaction covers incorporation and excision of AZT-MP as well as the ensuing rescues of DNA synthesis. The data show that enzymes containing TAMs/A360V and TAMs/N348I, respectively, increased full-length product formation when compared with TAMs (Fig. 1). The efficiency of rescue of DNA synthesis follows the order WT RT < TAMs < TAMs/A360V < TAMs/N348I < TAMs/A360V/N348I. A360V and N348I Reduce RNase H Activity and Mediate the Accumulation of Truncated Substrates—N348I-containing mutant enzymes were shown to reduce RNase H activity (26Yap S.H. Sheen C.W. Fahey J.

Here, time course experiments were employed to compare RNase H cleavage efficiencies in the context of each of the mutant enzymes described above. Reactions were monitored ona5′-end-labeled RNA template (Fig. 2A).

https://openalex.org/W2041618720,"Background Reversible modification of proteins through the attachment of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifiers is an essential post-translational regulatory mechanism in eukaryotes. The conjugation of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins has been demonstrated to play roles in growth, adaptation and homeostasis in all eukaryotes, with perturbation of ubiquitin-mediated systems associated with the pathogenesis of many human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe the use of an HMM search of functional Pfam domains found in the key components of the ubiquitin-mediated pathway necessary to activate and reversibly modify target proteins in eight apicomplexan parasitic protozoa for which complete or late-stage genome projects exist. In parallel, the same search was conducted on five model organisms, single-celled and metazoans, to generate data to validate both the search parameters employed and aid paralog classification in Apicomplexa. For each of the 13 species investigated, a set of proteins predicted to be involved in the ubiquitylation pathway has been identified and demonstrates increasing component members of the ubiquitylation pathway correlating with organism and genome complexity. Sequence homology and domain architecture analyses facilitated prediction of apicomplexan-specific protein function, particularly those involved in regulating cell division during these parasite's complex life cycles. Conclusions/Significance This study provides a comprehensive analysis of proteins predicted to be involved in the apicomplexan ubiquitin-mediated pathway. Given the importance of such pathway in a wide variety of cellular processes, our data is a key step in elucidating the biological networks that, in part, direct the pathogenicity of these parasites resulting in a massive impact on global health. Moreover, apicomplexan-specific adaptations of the ubiquitylation pathway may represent new therapeutic targets for much needed drugs against apicomplexan parasites."
https://openalex.org/W1995627045,"Background Chromosomal instability (CIN), a feature widely shared by cells from solid tumors, is caused by occasional chromosome missegregations during cell division. Two of the causes of CIN are weakened mitotic checkpoint signaling and persistent merotelic attachments that result in lagging chromosomes during anaphase. Principal Findings Here we identify an autophosphorylation event on Mps1 that is required to prevent these two causes of CIN. Mps1 is phosphorylated in mitotic cells on at least 7 residues, 4 of which by autophosphorylation. One of these, T676, resides in the activation loop of the kinase domain and a mutant that cannot be phosphorylated on T676 is less active than wild-type Mps1 but is not kinase-dead. Strikingly, cells in which endogenous Mps1 was replaced with this mutant are viable but missegregate chromosomes frequently. Anaphase is initiated in the presence of misaligned and lagging chromosomes, indicative of a weakened checkpoint and persistent merotelic attachments, respectively. Conclusions/Significance We propose that full activity of Mps1 is essential for maintaining chromosomal stability by allowing resolution of merotelic attachments and to ensure that single kinetochores achieve the strength of checkpoint signaling sufficient to prevent premature anaphase onset and chromosomal instability. To our knowledge, phosphorylation of T676 on Mps1 is the first post-translational modification in human cells of which the absence causes checkpoint weakening and CIN without affecting cell viability."

https://openalex.org/W1984214673,"Major histocompatibility complex proteins are believed to undergo significant conformational changes concomitant with peptide binding, but structural characterization of these changes has remained elusive.Here we use molecular dynamics simulations and experimental probes of protein conformation to investigate the peptide-free state of class II MHC proteins. Upon computational removal of the bound peptide from HLA-DR1-peptide complex, the alpha50-59 region folded into the P1-P4 region of the peptide binding site, adopting the same conformation as a bound peptide. Strikingly, the structure of the hydrophobic P1 pocket is maintained by engagement of the side chain of Phe alpha54. In addition, conserved hydrogen bonds observed in crystal structures between the peptide backbone and numerous MHC side chains are maintained between the alpha51-55 region and the rest of the molecule. The model for the peptide-free conformation was evaluated using conformationally-sensitive antibody and superantigen probes predicted to show no change, moderate change, or dramatic changes in their interaction with peptide-free DR1 and peptide-loaded DR1. The binding observed for these probes is in agreement with the movements predicted by the model.This work presents a molecular model for peptide-free class II MHC proteins that can help to interpret the conformational changes known to occur within the protein during peptide binding and release, and can provide insight into possible mechanisms for DM action."
https://openalex.org/W2170996095,"Cytochrome P450 (P450) is a super-family of drug metabolizing enzymes. P450 enzymes have dual function; they can metabolize drugs to pharmacologically inactive metabolites facilitating their excretion or biotransform them to pharmacologically active metabolites which may have longer half-life than the parent drug. The variable pharmacological response to psychoactive drugs typically seen in population groups is often not accountable by considering dissimilarities in hepatic metabolism. Metabolism in brain specific nuclei may play a role in pharmacological modulation of drugs acting on the CNS and help explain some of the diverse response to these drugs seen in patient population. P450 enzymes are also present in brain where drug metabolism can take place and modify therapeutic action of drugs at the site of action. We have earlier demonstrated an intrinsic difference in the biotransformation of alprazolam (ALP) in brain and liver, relatively more alpha-hydroxy alprazolam (alpha-OHALP) is formed in brain as compared to liver. In the present study we show that recombinant CYP3A43 metabolizes ALP to both alpha-OHALP and 4-hydroxy alprazolam (4-OHALP) while CYP3A4 metabolizes ALP predominantly to its inactive metabolite, 4-OHALP. The expression of CYP3A43 mRNA in human brain samples correlates with formation of relatively higher levels of alpha-OH ALP indicating that individuals who express higher levels of CYP3A43 in the brain would generate larger amounts of alpha-OHALP. Further, the expression of CYP3A43 was relatively higher in brain as compared to liver across different ethnic populations. Since CYP3A enzymes play a prominent role in the metabolism of drugs, the higher expression of CYP3A43 would generate metabolite profile of drugs differentially in human brain and thus impact the pharmacodynamics of psychoactive drugs at the site of action."

Recently, mutations in TARDBP have been linked to familial and sporadic ALS. Methodology/Principal Findings To further examine the frequency of mutations in TARDBP in sporadic ALS, 279 ALS cases and 806 neurologically normal control individuals of European descent were screened for sequence variants, copy number variants, genetic and haplotype association with disease. An additional 173 African samples from the Human Gene Diversity Panel were sequenced as this population had the highest likelihood of finding changes. No mutations were found in the ALS cases. Several genetic variants were identified in controls, which were considered as non-pathogenic changes. Furthermore, pathogenic structural variants were not observed in the cases and there was no genetic or haplotype association with disease status across the TARDBP locus. Conclusions Our data indicate that genetic variation in TARDBP is not a common cause of sporadic ALS in North American."

Understanding the regulation of the complex is critical since defects in this complex cause muscular dystrophy in humans. To reveal new regulators of the Dg-Dys complex, we used a model organism Drosophila melanogaster and performed genetic interaction screens to identify modifiers of Dg and Dys mutants in Drosophila wing veins. These mutant screens revealed that the Dg-Dys complex interacts with genes involved in muscle function and components of Notch, TGF-beta and EGFR signaling pathways. In addition, components of pathways that are required for cellular and/or axonal migration through cytoskeletal regulation, such as Semaphorin-Plexin, Frazzled-Netrin and Slit-Robo pathways show interactions with Dys and/or Dg. These data suggest that the Dg-Dys complex and the other pathways regulating extracellular information transfer to the cytoskeletal dynamics are more intercalated than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2056337521,"To examine the accuracy and adequacy of lay media news stories about complementary and alternative medicines and therapies.A descriptive analysis of news stories about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the Australian media using a national medical news monitoring website, mediadoctor.org.au. Each story was rated against 10 criteria by two individuals. Consensus scores of 222 news articles reporting therapeutic claims about complementary medicines posted on mediadoctor.org.au between 1 January 2004 and 1 September 2007 were calculated. The overall rating score for 222 CAM articles was 50% (95% CI 47% to 53%). There was a statistically significant (F = 3.68, p = 0.006) difference in cumulative mean scores according to type of therapy: biologically based practices (54%, 95% CI 50% to 58%); manipulative body based practices (46%, 95% CI 39% to 54%), whole medical systems (45%, 95% CI 32% to 58%), mind body medicine (41%, 95% CI 31% to 50%) and energy medicine (33%, 95% CI 11% to 55%). There was a statistically significant difference in cumulative mean scores (F = 3.72, p = 0.0001) according to the clinical outcome of interest with stories about cancer treatments (62%, 95% CI 54% to 70%) scoring highest and stories about treatments for children's behavioural and mental health concerns scoring lowest (31%, 95% CI 19% to 43%). Significant differences were also found in scores between media outlets.There is substantial variability in news reporting practices about CAM. Overall, although they may be improving, the scores remain generally low. It appears that much of the information the public receives about CAM is inaccurate or incomplete."
https://openalex.org/W2069523823,"The level of dietary energy intake influences metabolism, reproductive function, the development of age-related diseases, and even cognitive behavior. Because males and females typically play different roles in the acquisition and allocation of energy resources, we reasoned that dietary energy intake might differentially affect the brains of males and females at the molecular level. To test this hypothesis, we performed a gene array analysis of the hippocampus in male and female rats that had been maintained for 6 months on either ad libitum (control), 20% caloric restriction (CR), 40% CR, intermittent fasting (IF) or high fat/high glucose (HFG) diets. These diets resulted in expected changes in body weight, and circulating levels of glucose, insulin and leptin. However, the CR diets significantly increased the size of the hippocampus of females, but not males. Multiple genes were regulated coherently in response to energy restriction diets in females, but not in males. Functional physiological pathway analyses showed that the 20% CR diet down-regulated genes involved in glycolysis and mitochondrial ATP production in males, whereas these metabolic pathways were up-regulated in females. The 40% CR diet up-regulated genes involved in glycolysis, protein deacetylation, PGC-1α and mTor pathways in both sexes. IF down-regulated many genes in males including those involved in protein degradation and apoptosis, but up-regulated many genes in females including those involved in cellular energy metabolism, cell cycle regulation and protein deacetylation. Genes involved in energy metabolism, oxidative stress responses and cell death were affected by the HFG diet in both males and females. The gender-specific molecular genetic responses of hippocampal cells to variations in dietary energy intake identified in this study may mediate differential behavioral responses of males and females to differences in energy availability."
https://openalex.org/W2035633331,"The GFP folding reporter assay [1] uses a C-terminal GFP fusion to report on the folding success of upstream fused polypeptides. The GFP folding assay is widely-used for screening protein variants with improved folding and solubility [2]–[8], but truncation artifacts may arise during evolution, i.e. from de novo internal ribosome entry sites [9]. One way to reduce such artifacts would be to insert target genes within the scaffolding of GFP circular permuted variants. Circular permutants of fluorescent proteins often misfold and are non-fluorescent, and do not readily tolerate fused polypeptides within the fluorescent protein scaffolding [10]–[12]. To overcome these limitations, and to increase the dynamic range for reporting on protein misfolding, we have created eight GFP insertion reporters with different sensitivities to protein misfolding using chimeras of two previously described GFP variants, the GFP folding reporter [1] and the robustly-folding “superfolder” GFP [13]. We applied this technology to engineer soluble variants of Rv0113, a protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis initially expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. Using GFP insertion reporters with increasing stringency for each cycle of mutagenesis and selection led to a variant that produced large amounts of soluble protein at 37°C in Escherichia coli. The new reporter constructs discriminate against truncation artifacts previously isolated during directed evolution of Rv0113 using the original C-terminal GFP folding reporter. Using GFP insertion reporters with variable stringency should prove useful for engineering protein variants with improved folding and solubility, while reducing the number of artifacts arising from internal cryptic ribosome initiation sites."
https://openalex.org/W2152993176,"Rapid proliferation is one of the important features of memory CD8(+) T cells, ensuring rapid clearance of reinfection. Although several cytokines such as IL-15 and IL-7 regulate relatively slow homeostatic proliferation of memory T cells during the maintenance phase, it is unknown how memory T cells can proliferate more quickly than naïve T cells upon antigen stimulation. To examine antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell proliferation in recall responses in vivo, we targeted a model antigen, ovalbumin(OVA), to DEC-205(+) dendritic cells (DCs) with a CD40 maturation stimulus. This led to the induction of functional memory CD8(+) T cells, which showed rapid proliferation and multiple cytokine production (IFN-gamma, IL-2, TNF-alpha) during the secondary challenge to DC-targeted antigen. Upon antigen-presentation, IL-18, an IFN-gamma-inducing factor, accumulated at the DC:T cell synapse. Surprisingly, IFN-gamma receptors were required to augment IL-18 production from DCs. Mice genetically deficient for IL-18 or IFN-gamma-receptor 1 also showed delayed expansion of memory CD8(+) T cells in vivo. These results indicate that a positive regulatory loop involving IFN-gamma and IL-18 signaling contributes to the accelerated memory CD8(+) T cell proliferation during a recall response to antigen presented by DCs."
https://openalex.org/W2132729317,"Background Can non-human animals comprehend and employ symbols? The most convincing empirical evidence comes from language-trained apes, but little is known about this ability in monkeys. Tokens can be regarded as symbols since they are inherently non-valuable objects that acquire an arbitrarily assigned value upon exchange with an experimenter. Recent evidence suggested that capuchin monkeys, which diverged from the human lineage 35 million years ago, can estimate, represent and combine token quantities. A fundamental and open question is whether monkeys can reason about symbols in ways similar to how they reason about real objects. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we examined this broad question in the context of economic choice behavior. Specifically, we assessed whether, in a symbolic context, capuchins' preferences satisfy transitivity - a fundamental trait of rational decision-making. Given three options A, B and C, transitivity holds true if A≥B, B≥C and A≥C (where ≥ indicates preference). In this study, we trained monkeys to exchange three types of tokens for three different foods. We then compared choices monkeys made between different types of tokens with choices monkeys made between the foods. Qualitatively, capuchins' preferences revealed by the way of tokens were similar to those measured with the actual foods. In particular, when choosing between tokens, monkeys displayed strict economic preferences and their choices satisfied transitivity. Quantitatively, however, values measured by the way of tokens differed systematically from those measured with the actual foods. In particular, for any pair of foods, the relative value of the preferred food increased when monkeys chose between the corresponding tokens. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate that indeed capuchins are capable of treating tokens as symbols. However, as they do so, capuchins experience the cognitive burdens imposed by symbolic representation."
https://openalex.org/W2118578633,"The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) supplies cytosolic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum for binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Its specificity therefore influences the repertoire of peptides presented by MHC molecules. Compared to human TAP, murine TAP's binding specificity has not been characterized as well, even though murine systems are widely used for basic studies of antigen processing and presentation.We performed a detailed experimental analysis of murine TAP binding specificity by measuring the binding affinities of 323 peptides. Based on this experimental data, a computational model of murine TAP specificity was constructed. The model was compared to previously generated data on human and murine TAP specificities. In addition, the murine TAP specificities for known epitopes and random peptides were predicted and compared to assess the impact of murine TAP selectivity on epitope selection.Comparisons to a previously constructed model of human TAP specificity confirms the well-established differences for peptide substrates with positively charged C-termini. In addition these comparisons show that several residues at the N-terminus of peptides which strongly influence binding to human TAP showed little effect on binding to murine TAP, and that the overall influence of the aminoterminal residues on peptide affinity for murine TAP is much lower than for the human transporter. Murine TAP also partly prefers different hydrophobic amino acids than human TAP in the carboxyterminal position. These species-dependent differences in specificity determined in vitro are shown to correlate with the epitope repertoire recognized in vivo. The quantitative model of binding specificity of murine TAP developed herein should be useful for interpreting epitope mapping and immunogenicity data obtained in humanized mouse models."
https://openalex.org/W2074880108,"Background The critical event in heart formation is commitment of mesodermal cells to a cardiomyogenic fate, and cardiac fate determination is regulated by a series of cytokines. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and fibroblast growth factors have been shown to be involved in this process, however additional factors needs to be identified for the fate determination, especially at the early stage of cardiomyogenic development. Methodology/Principal Findings Global gene expression analysis using a series of human cells with a cardiomyogenic potential suggested Gremlin (Grem1) is a candidate gene responsible for in vitro cardiomyogenic differentiation. Grem1, a known BMP antagonist, enhanced DMSO-induced cardiomyogenesis of P19CL6 embryonal carcinoma cells (CL6 cells) 10–35 fold in an area of beating differentiated cardiomyocytes. The Grem1 action was most effective at the early differentiation stage when CL6 cells were destined to cardiomyogenesis, and was mediated through inhibition of BMP2. Furthermore, BMP2 inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling that promoted CL6 cardiomyogenesis. Conclusions/Significance Grem1 enhances the determined path to cardiomyogenesis in a stage-specific manner, and inhibition of the BMP signaling pathway is involved in initial determination of Grem1-promoted cardiomyogenesis. Our results shed new light on renewal of the cardiovascular system using Grem1 in human."
https://openalex.org/W1973062643,"Here we report two unrelated Chinese families with congenital missing teeth inherited in an X-linked manner. We mapped the affected locus to chromosome Xp11-Xq21 in one family. In the defined region, both families were found to have novel missense mutations in the ectodysplasin-A (EDA) gene. The mutation of c.947A>G caused the D316G substitution of the EDA protein. The mutation of c.1013C>T found in the other family resulted in the Thr to Met mutation at position 338 of EDA. The EDA gene has been reported responsible for X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED) in humans characterized by impaired development of hair, eccrine sweat glands, and teeth. In contrast, all the affected individuals in the two families that we studied here had normal hair and skin. Structural analysis suggests that these two novel mutants may account for the milder phenotype by affecting the stability of EDA trimers. Our results indicate that these novel missense mutations in EDA are associated with the isolated tooth agenesis and provide preliminary explanation for the abnormal clinical phenotype at a molecular structural level."
https://openalex.org/W1976253283,"Background Members of the dynamin super-family of GTPases are involved in disparate cellular pathways. Dynamin1 and dynamin2 have been implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. While some models suggest that dynamin functions specifically at the point of vesicle fission, evidence also exists for a role prior to fission during vesicle formation and it is unknown if there is a role for dynamin after vesicle fission. Although dynamin2 is ubiquitously expressed, dynamin1 is restricted to the nervous system. These two structurally similar endocytic accessory proteins have not been studied in cells that endogenously express both. Methodology/Principal Findings The present study quantitatively assesses the dynamics of dynamin1 and dynamin2 during clathrin-mediated endocytosis in PC12 cells, which endogenously express both proteins. Both dynamin isoforms co-localized with clathrin and showed sharp increases in fluorescence intensity immediately prior to internalization of the nascent clathrin-coated vesicle. The fluorescence intensity of both proteins then decreased with two time constants. The slower time constant closely matched the time constant for the decrease of clathrin intensity and likely represents vesicle movement away from the membrane. The faster rate may reflect release of dynamin at the neck of nascent vesicle following GTP hydrolysis. Conclusions/Significance This study analyses the role of dynamin in clathrin-mediated endocytosis in a model for cellular neuroscience and these results may provide direct evidence for the existence of two populations of dynamin associated with nascent clathrin-coated vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1983318517,"Background L-arginine infusion improves endothelial function in malaria but its safety profile has not been described in detail. We assessed clinical symptoms, hemodynamic status and biochemical parameters before and after a single L-arginine infusion in adults with moderately severe malaria. Methodology and Findings In an ascending dose study, adjunctive intravenous L-arginine hydrochloride was infused over 30 minutes in doses of 3 g, 6 g and 12 g to three separate groups of 10 adults hospitalized with moderately severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria in addition to standard quinine therapy. Symptoms, vital signs and selected biochemical measurements were assessed before, during, and for 24 hours after infusion. No new or worsening symptoms developed apart from mild discomfort at the intravenous cannula site in two patients. There was a dose-response relationship between increasing mg/kg dose and the maximum decrease in systolic (ρ = 0.463; Spearman's, p = 0.02) and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.42; Pearson's, p = 0.02), and with the maximum increment in blood potassium (r = 0.70, p<0.001) and maximum decrement in bicarbonate concentrations (r = 0.53, p = 0.003) and pH (r = 0.48, p = 0.007). At the highest dose (12 g), changes in blood pressure and electrolytes were not clinically significant, with a mean maximum decrease in mean arterial blood pressure of 6 mmHg (range: 0–11; p<0.001), mean maximal increase in potassium of 0.5 mmol/L (range 0.2–0.7 mmol/L; p<0.001), and mean maximal decrease in bicarbonate of 3 mEq/L (range 1–7; p<0.01) without a significant change in pH. There was no significant dose-response relationship with blood phosphate, lactate, anion gap and glucose concentrations. All patients had an uncomplicated clinical recovery. Conclusions/Significance Infusion of up to 12g of intravenous L-arginine hydrochloride over 30 minutes is well tolerated in adults with moderately severe malaria, with no clinically important changes in hemodynamic or biochemical status. Trials of adjunctive L-arginine can be extended to phase 2 studies in severe malaria. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00147368"

https://openalex.org/W2044388070,"We previously documented a ten-fold increase in γcyto-actin expression in dystrophin-deficient skeletal muscle and hypothesized that increased γcyto-actin expression may participate in an adaptive cytoskeletal remodeling response. To explore whether increased γcyto-actin fortifies the cortical cytoskeleton in dystrophic skeletal muscle, we generated double knockout mice lacking both dystrophin and γcyto-actin specifically in skeletal muscle (ms-DKO). Surprisingly, dystrophin-deficient mdx and ms-DKO mice presented with comparable levels of myofiber necrosis, membrane instability, and deficits in muscle function. The lack of an exacerbated phenotype in ms-DKO mice suggests γcyto-actin and dystrophin function in a common pathway. Finally, because both mdx and ms-DKO skeletal muscle showed similar levels of utrophin expression and presented with identical dystrophies, we conclude utrophin can partially compensate for the loss of dystrophin independent of a γcyto-actin-utrophin interaction."

https://openalex.org/W2021934926,"Thus far, live attenuated SIV has been the most successful method for vaccinating macaques against pathogenic SIV challenge; however, it is not clear what mechanisms are responsible for this protection. Adoptive transfer studies in mice have been integral to understanding live attenuated vaccine protection in models like Friend virus. Previous adoptive transfers in primates have failed as transferred cells are typically cleared within hours after transfer.Here we describe adoptive transfer studies in Mauritian origin cynomolgus macaques (MCM), a non-human primate model with limited MHC diversity. Cells transferred between unrelated MHC-matched macaques persist for at least fourteen days but are rejected within 36 hours in MHC-mismatched macaques. Cells trafficked from the blood to peripheral lymphoid tissues within 12 hours of transfer.MHC-matched MCM provide the first viable primate model for adoptive transfer studies. Because macaques infected with SIV are the best model for HIV/AIDS pathogenesis, we can now directly study the correlates of protective immune responses to AIDS viruses. For example, plasma viral loads following pathogenic SIV challenge are reduced by several orders of magnitude in macaques previously immunized with attenuated SIV. Adoptive transfer of lymphocyte subpopulations from vaccinated donors into SIV-naïve animals may define the immune mechanisms responsible for protection and guide future vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2124289806,"Despite a substantial burden of non-bacteraemic methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) disease, most MRSA surveillance schemes are based on bacteraemias. Using bacteraemia as an outcome, trends at hospital level are difficult to discern, due to random variation. We investigated rates of nosocomial bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic MRSA infection as surveillance outcomes.We used microbiology and patient administration system data from an Oxford hospital to estimate monthly rates of first nosocomial MRSA bacteraemia, and nosocomial MRSA isolation from blood/respiratory/sterile site specimens (""sterile sites"") or all clinical samples (screens excluded) in all patients admitted from the community for at least 2 days between April 1998 and June 2006. During this period there were 441 nosocomial MRSA bacteraemias, 1464 MRSA isolations from sterile sites, and 3450 isolations from clinical specimens (8% blood, 15% sterile site, 10% respiratory, 59% surface swabs, 8% urine) in over 2.6 million patient-days. The ratio of bacteraemias to sterile site and all clinical isolations was similar over this period (around 3 and 8-fold lower respectively), during which rates of nosocomial MRSA bacteraemia increased by 27% per year to July 2003 before decreasing by 18% per year thereafter (heterogeneity p<0.001). Trends in sterile site and all clinical isolations were similar. Notably, a change in rate of all clinical MRSA isolations in December 2002 could first be detected with conventional statistical significance by August 2003 (p = 0.03). In contrast, when monitoring MRSA bacteraemia, identification of probable changes in trend took longer, first achieving p<0.05 in July 2004.MRSA isolation from all sites of suspected infection, including bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic isolation, is a potential new surveillance method for MRSA control. It occurs about 8 times more frequently than bacteraemia, allowing robust statistical determination of changing rates over substantially shorter times or smaller areas than using bacteraemia as an outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2026529669,"Allergic asthma is a complex process arising out of the interaction between the immune system and aeroallergens. Yet, the relationship between aeroallergen exposure, allergic sensitization and disease remains unclear. This knowledge is essential to gain further insight into the origin and evolution of allergic diseases. The objective of this research is to develop a computational view of the interaction between aeroallergens and the host by investigating the impact of dose and length of aeroallergen exposure on allergic sensitization and allergic disease outcomes, mainly airway inflammation and to a lesser extent lung dysfunction and airway remodeling.BALB/C mice were exposed intranasally to a range of concentrations of the most pervasive aeroallergen worldwide, house dust mite (HDM), for up to a quarter of their lifespan (20 weeks). Actual biological data delineating the kinetics, nature and extent of responses for local (airway inflammation) and systemic (HDM-specific immunoglobulins) events were obtained. Mathematical equations for each outcome were developed, evaluated, refined through several iterations involving in vivo experimentation, and validated. The models accurately predicted the original biological data and simulated an extensive array of previously unknown responses, eliciting two- and three-dimensional models. Our data demonstrate the non-linearity of the relationship between aeroallergen exposure and either allergic sensitization or airway inflammation, identify thresholds, behaviours and maximal responsiveness for each outcome, and examine inter-variable relationships.This research provides a novel way to visualize allergic responses in vivo and establishes a basic experimental platform upon which additional variables and perturbations can be incorporated into the system."
https://openalex.org/W1992214331,"Cohesin is the protein complex responsible for maintaining sister chromatid cohesion. Cohesin interacts with centromeres and specific loci along chromosome arms known as Chromosome Attachment Regions (CARs). The cohesin holocomplex contains four subunits. Two of them, Smc1p (Structural maintenance of chromosome 1 protein) and Smc3p, are long coiled-coil proteins, which heterodimerize with each other at one end. They are joined together at the other end by a third subunit, Scc1p, which also binds to the fourth subunit, Scc3p. How cohesin interacts with chromosomes is not known, although several models have been proposed, in part on the basis of in vitro assembly of purified cohesin proteins. To be able to observe in vivo cohesin-chromatin interactions, we have modified a Minichromosome Affinity Purification (MAP) method to isolate a CAR-containing centromeric minichromosome attached to in vivo assembled cohesin. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis of these minichromosomes suggests that cohesin assumes a rod shape and interacts with replicated minichromosome at one end of that rod. Additionally, our data implies that more than one cohesin molecule interacts with each pair of replicated minichromsomes. These molecules seem to be packed into a single thick rod, suggesting that the Smc1p and Smc3p subunits may interact extensively."

https://openalex.org/W2083133878,"Background The vast majority of human genes (>70%) are alternatively spliced. Although alternative pre-mRNA processing is modified in multiple tumors, alternative hyper-splicing signatures specific to particular tumor types are still lacking. Here, we report the use of Affymetrix Human Exon Arrays to spot hyper-splicing events characteristic of myasthenia gravis (MG)-thymoma, thymic tumors which develop in patients with MG and discriminate them from colon cancer changes. Methodology/Principal Findings We combined GO term to parent threshold-based and threshold-independent ad-hoc functional statistics with in-depth analysis of key modified transcripts to highlight various exon-specific changes. These denote alternative splicing in MG-thymoma tumors compared to healthy human thymus and to in-house and Affymetrix datasets from colon cancer and healthy tissues. By using both global and specific, term-to-parent Gene Ontology (GO) statistical comparisons, our functional integrative ad-hoc method allowed the detection of disease-relevant splicing events. Conclusions/Significance Hyper-spliced transcripts spanned several categories, including the tumorogenic ERBB4 tyrosine kinase receptor and the connective tissue growth factor CTGF, as well as the immune function-related histocompatability gene HLA-DRB1 and interleukin (IL)19, two muscle-specific collagens and one myosin heavy chain gene; intriguingly, a putative new exon was discovered in the MG-involved acetylcholinesterase ACHE gene. Corresponding changes in spliceosome composition were indicated by co-decreases in the splicing factors ASF/SF2 and SC35. Parallel tumor-associated changes occurred in colon cancer as well, but the majority of the apparent hyper-splicing events were particular to MG-thymoma and could be validated by Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization (FISH), Reverse Transcription–Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and mass spectrometry (MS) followed by peptide sequencing. Our findings demonstrate a particular alternative hyper-splicing signature for transcripts over-expressed in MG-thymoma, supporting the hypothesis that alternative hyper-splicing contributes to shaping the biological functions of these and other specialized tumors and opening new venues for the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches."

https://openalex.org/W2062350326,"Background Ecological and evolutionary changes in native populations facing invasion by exotic species are increasingly reported. Recently, it has been shown that competition with exotic rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) disrupts dominance hierarchies within groups of native Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). The genetic and molecular actors underlying phenotypic plasticity are poorly understood. Methodology Here, we aimed at identifying the genetic and molecular actors contributing to this plastic loss of dominance hierarchies as well as at identifying genes implicated in behaviours related to social dominance. By using microarrays, we compared the genome-wide gene transcription profiles in brains of dominant versus subordinate juvenile Atlantic salmon in presence or absence of a competitive rainbow trout. Principal Findings Adding the trout competitor resulted in dominant and subordinate salmon being more similar, both behaviourally and at the level of brain gene transcription patterns. Genes for which transcription levels differed between dominant and subordinate salmon in the absence of exotic trout were mainly over-expressed in dominant salmon and included genes implicated in protein turnover, neuronal structural change and oxygen transport. Conclusions/Significance Our study provides one of the few examples demonstrating a close interplay between behavioural plasticity and gene transcription, therefore contributing to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes in an ecologically relevant context."
https://openalex.org/W2094147358,"The skills used by winged insects to explore their environment are strongly dependent upon the integration of neurosensory information comprising visual, acoustic and olfactory signals. The neuronal architecture of the wing contains a vast array of different sensors which might convey information to the brain in order to guide the trajectories during flight. In Drosophila, the wing sensory cells are either chemoreceptors or mechanoreceptors and some of these sensors have as yet unknown functions. The axons of these two functionally distinct types of neurons are entangled, generating a single nerve. This simple and accessible coincidental signaling circuitry in Drosophila constitutes an excellent model system to investigate the developmental variability in relation to natural behavioral polymorphisms.A fluorescent marker was generated in neurons at all stages of the Drosophila life cycle using a highly efficient and controlled genetic recombination system that can be induced in dividing precursor cells (MARCM system, flybase web site). It allows fluorescent signals in axons only when the neuroblasts and/or neuronal cell precursors like SOP (sensory organ precursors) undergo division during the precedent steps. We first show that a robust neurogenesis continues in the wing after the adults emerge from the pupae followed by an extensive axonal growth. Arguments are presented to suggest that this wing neurogenesis in the newborn adult flies was influenced by genetic determinants such as the frequency dependent for gene and by environmental cues such as population density.We demonstrate that the neuronal architecture in the adult Drosophila wing is unfinished when the flies emerge from their pupae. This unexpected developmental step might be crucial for generating non-heritable variants and phenotypic plasticity. This might therefore constitute an advantage in an unstable ecological system and explain much regarding the ability of Drosophila to robustly adapt to their environment."
