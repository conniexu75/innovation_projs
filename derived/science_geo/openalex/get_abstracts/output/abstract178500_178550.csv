https://openalex.org/W2042827511,"A Bose-Einstein condensate represents the most 'classical' form of a matter wave, just as an optical laser emits the most classical form of an electromagnetic wave. Nevertheless, the matter wave field has a quantized structure owing to the granularity of the discrete underlying atoms. Although such a field is usually assumed to be intrinsically stable (apart from incoherent loss processes), this is no longer true when the condensate is in a coherent superposition of different atom number states. For example, in a Bose-Einstein condensate confined by a three-dimensional optical lattice, each potential well can be prepared in a coherent superposition of different atom number states, with constant relative phases between neighbouring lattice sites. It is then natural to ask how the individual matter wave fields and their relative phases evolve. Here we use such a set-up to investigate these questions experimentally, observing that the matter wave field of the Bose-Einstein condensate undergoes a periodic series of collapses and revivals; this behaviour is directly demonstrated in the dynamical evolution of the multiple matter wave interference pattern. We attribute the oscillations to the quantized structure of the matter wave field and the collisions between individual atoms."

https://openalex.org/W2082697543,"In mammals, peripheral circadian clocks are present in most tissues, but little is known about how these clocks are synchronized with the ambient 24-h cycles. By using rat-1 fibroblasts, a model cell system of the peripheral clock, we found that an exchange of the culture medium triggered circadian gene expression that was preceded by slow down-regulation of Per1 andPer2 mRNA levels. This profile contrasts to the immediate up-regulation of these genes often observed for clock resetting. The screening of factor(s) responsible for the down-regulation revealed glucose as a key component triggering the circadian rhythm. The requirement of both glucose metabolism and RNA/protein synthesis for the down-regulation suggests the involvement of gene(s) immediately up-regulated by glucose metabolism. An analysis with high density oligonucleotide microarrays identified >100 glucose-regulated genes. We found among others immediately up-regulated genes encoding transcriptional regulators TIEG1, VDUP1, and HES1, in addition to cooperatively regulated genes that are associated with cholesterol biosynthesis and cell cycle. The immediate up-regulation of Tieg1 and Vdup1 expression was dependent on glucose metabolism but not on protein synthesis, suggesting that the transcriptional regulators mediate the glucose-induced down-regulation of Per1 andPer2 expression. These results illustrate a novel mode of peripheral clock resetting by external glucose, a major food metabolite.

Almost all organisms on earth exhibit daily changes in a variety of physiological processes, such as gene expression, metabolism, and behavior (1Pittendrigh C.S. Annu. Rev.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Many of the daily changes persist under constant conditions with intrinsic period lengths (∼24 h) under the control of autonomous biological pacemakers called circadian clocks. The circadian clock can be reset by environmental time cues (such as light) to synchronize with the ambient 24-h cycles. In mammals, genetic and molecular analyses revealed transcription/translation-based negative feedback loop(s) that constitutes the core oscillator of the circadian clock. This loop involves a well concerted regulation of Per, Cry,Clock, Bmal genes and their products, resulting in robust oscillations of Per and Bmal mRNA levels in antiphase and of several output genes such as Dbp(4King D.P.

The core oscillatory mechanism seems to be common to both the central clock localized in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) 1The abbreviations used are: SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RT, reverse transcriptase; 3-OMG, 3-O-methylglucose; TIEG1, transforming growth factor β-inducible early gene 1; VDUP1, vitamin D3 up-regulated protein 1; HES1, hairy and enhancer of split 1; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein and peripheral clocks distributed in most tissues and cells (6Zylka M.J.

Science. 2001; 292: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). However, peripheral clocks are distinct from the central clock in that the circadian expression of the clock genes persists only for several days in culture (9Yamazaki S. Numano R. Abe M. Hida A. Takahashi R. Ueda M. Block G.D. Sakaki Y. Menaker M. Tei H. Science. 2000; 288: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). The cyclic gene expression in peripheral clocks is probably sustained by synchronization with some neural and/or humoral signals generated by the SCN in a circadian manner (9Yamazaki S. Numano R. Abe M. Hida A. Takahashi R. Ueda M. Block G.D. Sakaki Y. Menaker M. Tei H. Science. 2000; 288: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar, 10Brown S.A. Schibler U. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Recent studies showed that restricted feeding cycle synchronizes peripheral clocks independently of the central clock (12Damiola F., Le Minh N. Preitner N. Kornmann B. Fleury-Olela F. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2950-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar, 13Stokkan K.A. Yamazaki S. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Menaker M.

Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), suggesting that feeding may be a dominant time cue for peripheral clocks. These observations led to an interesting idea that the central clock indirectly synchronizes peripheral clocks by regulating feeding behaviors (12Damiola F., Le Minh N. Preitner N. Kornmann B. Fleury-Olela F. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2950-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar, 13Stokkan K.A. Yamazaki S. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Menaker M.

This model predicts peripheral clocks to be reset by feeding-associated events such as food processing, metabolite absorption, and/or change in hormone levels, but little is known regarding the molecular identity of the feeding signal to be sent to peripheral clocks. Cultured cells such as rat-1 fibroblasts have been used as a model for the study on the peripheral clock system, especially on the resetting mechanism (7Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U.

This is because circadian gene expression in these cells is induced not only by serum shock that was originally found to be effective (7Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U.

Here we demonstrate that in rat-1 fibroblasts, an exchange of the culture medium induced circadian expression of the clock genes, which was preceded by slow down-regulation, not by rapid up-regulation, of Per1 and Per2 mRNA levels. An addition of glucose to the culture medium was a key step in this novel type of rhythm induction, and the down-regulation ofPer1 and Per2 expression required ongoing RNA and protein synthesis. Microarray analysis revealed glucose-induced up- or down-regulation of many genes, some of which encode transcriptional regulators and may play an important role in the induction of circadian rhythm. All compounds including each component of DMEM were dissolved in water before their addition to the culture medium. Compositions of solutions were as follows (final concentrations in the culture medium): salts (0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.12 μm Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.41 mm MgSO4, 55 mm NaCl, 22 mm NaHCO3, and 0.45 mm NaH2PO4), glucose (2.8 mm), pyruvate (0.5 mm), amino acids (2 mml-glutamine, 0.2 mm glycine, 0.2 mml-serine, and 1× minimum essential medium amino acids solution (Invitrogen)), and vitamins (2× minimum essential medium vitamin solution (Invitrogen)). Rat-1 fibroblasts were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2, 95% air in DMEM containing 5.6 mm glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Because light/dark cycle did not affect circadian expression of clock genes in rat-1 fibroblasts, 2T. Hirota, T. Okano, and Y. Fukada, unpublished data. the cells were kept in darkness in the incubator and all of the manipulations were performed under the light condition. For the experiments, cells were plated at a density of ∼2.5 × 105 cells/35-mm dish for reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis or ∼1.2 × 106 cells/10-cm dish for microarray analysis. The cells reached confluence 2 days after the plating, and they were maintained for another day prior to the start of experiments (at time 0). In the experiments (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10), 10 × concentrated solution of compound(s) in one-ninth volume was added to the culture medium.Figure 9Immediate changes of Tieg1,Vdup1, and Hes1 mRNA levels after glucose or 3-OMG addition. At time 0, glucose (5.6 mmfinal concentration, solid lines) or 3-OMG (final 5.6 mm, dashed lines) solution was added to the culture medium. The cells were collected at indicated time points, and the relative mRNA levels of Tieg1, Vdup1,Hes1, and Gapdh were determined by RT-PCR analysis.

Results for serum-treated cells were similar to those previously reported for serum- or endothelin-1-treated rat-1 fibroblasts (7Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U. Cell. 1998; 93: 929-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar, 8Yagita K. Tamanini F. van Der Horst G.T.J. Okamura H. Science. 2001; 292: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The cultured cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, homogenized with 1 ml (for 35-mm dish) or 3 ml (for 10-cm dish) of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and stored at −80 °C until use. The extraction of total RNA and quantitative RT-PCR analysis were performed as described previously (23Hirota T. Kagiwada S. Kasahara T. Okano T. Murata M. Fukada Y. J. Biochem. 2001; 129: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) with some modifications (see “Supplemental Experimental Procedures”). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA by Oligotex-dT30 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and used to prepare cRNA sample as described in the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (Affymetrix). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA by SuperScipt Choice System (Invitrogen) with T7-(dT)24 primer (Amersham Biosciences). The product was used as a template to synthesize biotin-labeled cRNA byin vitro transcription with ENZO BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript-Labeling Kit (Affymetrix), and cRNA amplified was fragmented by heat treatment in the presence of KOAc and Mg(OAc)2. 15 μg of cRNA sample then was applied to GeneChip Rat Genome U34A Array (Affymetrix). Hybridization, washing, staining, and scanning were performed according to the GeneChip Manual. The raw data for each probe set were calculated from the scanned array image by using GeneChip Analysis Suite software (Affymetrix) and subsequently analyzed by using GeneSpring software (Silicon Genetics). To compare the data from different arrays, the signal intensity value for each probe set on each array was normalized as follows: negative control value (median intensity value of negative control genes included in the array) was subtracted from the raw values, and the calculated values were divided by their median value. The values below 0 were set to 0. The normalized values from four independent arrays were then averaged for each probe set at each time point, and they were compared between two time points (time 0 with 1 or 4 h) to select probe sets for up- or down-regulated genes with the following criteria: (i) the intensity exhibits 3-fold or greater change, (ii) the change is significant (mean ± S.E. at each time point do not overlap with each other), and (iii) the signal is marked as “present” by the GeneChip software in at least 2 of 4 arrays at the time point for the higher average intensity. Expressed sequence tags in the selected probe sets were characterized by searching GenBankTM data base using BLAST program. Nomenclature of the selected genes was updated by using OMIM and GenBankTMdatabases. Overlapping probe sets for the same gene were unified by leaving one that exhibited the strongest signal when their expression profiles were similar to each other. Hierarchical clustering of the selected probe sets was then carried out using Cluster program (24Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13268) Google Scholar) in uncentered correlation/average linkage clustering mode, and the result was visualized with the aid of TreeView program (24Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13268) Google Scholar). Functional assignment of the selected genes was performed by searching OMIM and PubMed databases. In a search for a stimulus that induces rhythmic expression of some clock genes in rat-1 fibroblasts, we unexpectedly found that an exchange of the culture medium to serum-free medium triggered circadian changes in mRNA levels of Per2,Dbp, Bmal1, and Cry1 genes (Fig.1 and Supplemental Fig. 1, medium change). The phase of the expression rhythm of each gene induced by the medium exchange was advanced by ∼4 h relative to that observed after a pulse treatment with 50% serum (Fig. 1 B and Supplemental Fig. 1B, compare solid lines withdashed lines). Notably, no immediate increase was observed in mRNA levels of Per1 and Per2 gene after the medium exchange, and this contrasted markedly with the rapid up-regulation of Per1 and Per2 expression after serum shock (Fig. 1 B). We further analyzed immediate changes of Per1, Per2, and Bmal1 mRNA levels after the medium exchange and found that these mRNA levels began to decrease 45–60 min after the treatment (Fig.2). These results indicate that the circadian rhythm is induced by the medium exchange in a manner quite different from that triggered by the serum shock and predict a novel mechanism of rhythm induction that is preceded by slow down-regulation of Per1 and Per2 expression. The exchange of the culture medium might have multiple effects on the cultured cells, and hence, we searched for factor(s) that causes the down-regulation ofPer1 and Per2 mRNA levels (Fig.3). An exchange of the culture medium with medium recovered from another culture dish had a minimal effect onPer1 and Per2 expression (Fig. 3 A), eliminating the possibility that the down-regulation was caused by any physical stimuli such as a transient change in temperature and/or pH of the medium or exposure of the cells to the air. We next screened the components of DMEM (salts, glucose, pyruvate, amino acids, and vitamins) by adding them separately to the culture medium and found that glucose remarkably reduced not only Per1 but alsoPer2 expression (Fig. 3 B) in a manner similar to that observed after the medium exchange (Fig. 3 A). These observations suggest glucose as a key molecule that induces the cellular circadian rhythm. We then examined whether the fresh supply of glucose can trigger the circadian gene expression as did the medium exchange (Fig. 4). After the addition of glucose solution (5.6 mm final concentration) to the culture medium, Per2, Dbp, and Bmal1 genes exhibited robust circadian expression with profiles nearly identical to those observed after the medium exchange (Fig. 4 B, compare solid lines with dashed lines), and the profiles were obviously different from those after the serum shock (Fig. 1 B, dashed lines). These results demonstrate that glucose can trigger circadian rhythm and suggest that the induction of circadian rhythm by the medium exchange is mainly attributed to the supply of glucose. We were interested in the molecular mechanism underlying the induction of circadian rhythm that is preceded by the down-regulation ofPer1 and Per2 expression, and we first investigated whether glucose itself or its metabolism is important for the down-regulation (Fig. 5 A). Among several glucose-related compounds examined, metabolizable carbohydrates such as galactose, fructose, and mannose reducedPer1 and Per2 expression to the level that was achieved by the glucose addition (Fig. 5 A). On the other hand, no significant change of the gene expression was observed with non-metabolizable mannitol and 3-O-methylgluc"

However, the significance and mechanism of the redox regulation remain elusive, mainly due to the technical limitations caused by rapid proton transfer in redox reactions and by the presence of many redox molecules within cells. Here we establish versatile methods for measuring redox states of proteins and their individual cysteine residues in vitro and in vivo, involving thiol-modifying reagents and LC-MS analysis. Using these methods, we demonstrate that the redox state of NF-κB is spatially regulated by its subcellular localization. While the p65 subunit and most cysteine residues of the p50 subunit are reduced similarly in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, Cys-62 of p50 is highly oxidized in the cytoplasm and strongly reduced in the nucleus. The reduced form of Cys-62 is essential for the DNA binding activity of NF-κB. Several lines of evidence suggest that the redox factor Ref-1 is involved in Cys-62 reduction in the nucleus. We propose that the Ref-1-dependent reduction of p50 in the nucleus is a necessary step for NF-κB activation. This study also provides the first example of a drug that inhibits the redox reaction between two specific proteins.

This study also provides the first example of a drug that inhibits the redox reaction between two specific proteins. The redox states of cysteine residues, which can change reversibly within cells, often greatly influence the various properties of proteins, such as protein stability, chaperone activity, enzymatic activity, and protein structure (1Bader M.

It has also been suggested that several transcription factors bind to their cognate sites in a redox-regulated manner. Well characterized cases include the prokaryotic transcription factors SoxR and OxyR, which function as oxidative stress sensors, their DNA binding activated through oxidation of critical cysteine residues (6Hidalgo E.

Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). In most cases, however, the roles and mechanisms of redox regulation are not fully defined because it is difficult to monitor the alteration of redox states of proteins mainly due to the rapid proton transfer in redox reactions. A few have directly quantified the redox state of cysteine clustered with iron or amounts of oxidized cysteines using physicochemical or biochemical techniques (3Mannick J.B. Hausladen A. Liu L.

Therefore, most researchers have chosen an indirect way of using cysteine-substitution mutant proteins (3Mannick J.B. Hausladen A. Liu L. Hess D.T. Zeng M. Miao Q.X. Kane L.S. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S.

Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). NF-κB is composed of two subunits, p50 and p65, both of which are members of the Rel family of transcription factors. NF-κB normally exists in the cytoplasm, forming an inactive ternary complex with the inhibitor protein IκBα. Following the application of appropriate stimuli, NF-κB is released from IκBα and translocates into the nucleus, where it binds DNA and activates transcription of target genes. Mechanisms of NF-κB activation have been extensively studied; however, it is largely unknown if, and how, the DNA binding step is activated in cells. Some reports have described that the DNA binding activity of NF-κB is regulated by redox potential in vitro(11Toledano M.B. Leonard W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4328-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 12Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T.

Recently, we reported an antiinflammatory drug that could allow us to solve this issue. The synthetic quinone derivative, (2E)-3-[5-(2,3-dimethoxy-6-methyl-1, 4-benzoquinoyl)]-2-nonyl-2-propenoic acid (E3330), is a novel anti-NF-κB drug that specifically suppresses DNA binding activity of NF-κB but not those of other inflammatory transcription factors, such as activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor of activated T cell (NF-AT), in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)- stimulated Jurkat cells (14Hiramoto M. Shimizu N. Sugimoto K. Tang J. Kawakami Y. Ito M. Aizawa S. Tanaka H. Makino I. Handa H. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 810-819PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, E3330 did not affect the DNA binding activity of purified NF-κB or several steps of NF-κB activation, including IκB degradation, p65 phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation of NF-κB (14Hiramoto M. Shimizu N. Sugimoto K. Tang J. Kawakami Y. Ito M. Aizawa S. Tanaka H. Makino I. Handa H. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 810-819PubMed Google Scholar). This led us to hypothesize that E3330 may target an unknown nuclear factor that stimulates the DNA binding activity of NF-κB. Consistent with this assumption, we purified and identified redox factor-1 (Ref-1) from Jurkat nuclear extracts as an E3330-binding protein that enhances DNA binding activity of NF-κB in an E3330-sensitive manner (15Shimizu N. Sugimoto K. Tang J. Nishi T. Sato I. Hiramoto M. Aizawa S. Hatakeyama M. Ohba R. Hatori H. Yoshikawa T. Suzuki F. Oomori A. Tanaka H. Kawaguchi H. Watanabe H. Handa H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Considering the specificity and affinity of the E3330-Ref-1 interaction (15Shimizu N. Sugimoto K. Tang J. Nishi T. Sato I. Hiramoto M. Aizawa S. Hatakeyama M. Ohba R. Hatori H. Yoshikawa T. Suzuki F. Oomori A. Tanaka H. Kawaguchi H. Watanabe H. Handa H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), E3330 is likely a selective inhibitor of Ref-1 activity. Ref-1 is a nuclear protein that was originally identified as a DNA repair enzyme with an apurinic (AP)-endonuclease activity (16Demple B. Herman T. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11450-11454Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 17Robson C.N. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5519-5523Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 18Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Ref-1 has been reported to stimulate activities of AP-1 as well as other transcription factors including p53 and hypoxia inducible factor-1α (18−24). In case of AP-1, it was well investigated by using in vitro cysteine point mutagenesis analysis that DNA binding activity of AP-1 is stimulated by the reducing activity of Ref-1. We have recently shown that Ref-1 enhances the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in vitro as well as NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation in vivo in an E3330-sensitive manner (15Shimizu N. Sugimoto K. Tang J. Nishi T. Sato I. Hiramoto M. Aizawa S. Hatakeyama M. Ohba R. Hatori H. Yoshikawa T. Suzuki F. Oomori A. Tanaka H. Kawaguchi H. Watanabe H. Handa H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, few analyses have been performed to determine if these processes involve redox reaction, and how these processes occur in cells. The existence of many redox regulatory molecules, such as thioredoxin (Trx), thioredoxin-reductase (TrxR), glutaredoxin, nucleoredoxin, and glutathione, makes it difficult to explore the specific redox regulation between proteins in eukaryotic cells. In order to overcome the difficulties associated with redox studiesin vivo, we utilized E3330 as a useful tool because E3330 is a Ref-1-specific inhibitor that specifically inhibits NF-κB activity but not the other transcription factors potentially regulated by Ref-1 as mentioned above. Using irreversible thiol-modifying reagents and LC-MS analysis, we evaluated here the redox states of NF-κB during its activation step in vivo. We provide evidence that Cys-62 of NF-κB p50 is selectively reduced by Ref-1 in the nucleus and that this reduction is a prerequisite for NF-κB activation in vivo. Thiol-modifying reagents, fluorescein-5-maleimide (F5M) and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan), respectively, dissolved in dimethylformamide to a final concentration of 200 mm and stored at −20 °C until use. LysC was obtained from Wako (Osaka, Japan). pET14b (Novagen)-based expression plasmids of full-length human p50 and Ref-1 have previously been described (15Shimizu N. Sugimoto K. Tang J. Nishi T. Sato I. Hiramoto M. Aizawa S. Hatakeyama M. Ohba R. Hatori H. Yoshikawa T. Suzuki F. Oomori A. Tanaka H. Kawaguchi H. Watanabe H. Handa H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). An expression vector of full-length human Trx was prepared by inserting the entire open reading frame amplified by polymerase chain reaction into the NdeI-BamHI sites of pET14b (Novagen). Each His-tagged protein was expressed inEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified under native conditions using Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) as instructed by the manufacturer. Purified proteins were dialyzed against dialysis buffer (HEPES pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA). For oxidation, p50 was further treated with 10 mm diamide for 30 min at 16 °C. For reduction, Ref-1 and Trx were treated with 0.3 mmTris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine-hydrochloride (TCEP) for 10 min at 37 °C. Diamide and TCEP were removed by an additional Ni-NTA agarose chromatography, and purified proteins were dialyzed against dialysis buffer. Native TrxR purified from bovine (4 unit/mg) was purchased from American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, Connecticut). Recombinant proteins were mixed in 100 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA). As a carrier protein, 100 μg of carbonic anhydrase was included in the reactions to help stabilize the recombinant proteins and to normalize the difference in protein concentrations. After incubation for various times at 37 °C, the reactions were used in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) or fluorescence assays. The DNA probe containing an NF-κB binding sequence was prepared as described (14Hiramoto M. Shimizu N. Sugimoto K. Tang J. Kawakami Y. Ito M. Aizawa S. Tanaka H. Makino I. Handa H. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 810-819PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions (8 μl) containing 2–4 μl of recombinant proteins, 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, 1 ng of32P-labeled DNA probe, and 300 ng of poly (dI-dC) in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 0.1 mKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 15% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. Reactions were then subjected to native 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) as described (14Hiramoto M. Shimizu N. Sugimoto K. Tang J. Kawakami Y. Ito M. Aizawa S. Tanaka H. Makino I. Handa H. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 810-819PubMed Google Scholar). To label reduced cysteines in vitro, protein samples were incubated with 0.3 mm F5M for 5 min on ice. F5M labeling was stopped by the addition of 100 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). Proteins were acetone-precipitated, suspended in SDS sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Fluorescence intensities of the proteins were quantified by scanning gels at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm using a fluorescence-image analyzer FLA2000 (Fuji Film). Data were analyzed with the Image Gauge software (Fuji Film). For fluorescence labeling in vivo, J-50 cells cultured under different conditions were incubated in medium containing 10 mm F5M for 5 min at 37 °C. All the subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm F5M, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and pellets were resuspended in 8 packed cell volumes of hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmF5M. After a 10-min incubation period, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.6%, and tubes were mixed vigorously for 10 s. Tubes were centrifuged for 5 s at 10,000 rpm, and supernatants (cytoplasmic fractions) were removed to separate vials. Nuclei were resuspended in 4 packed cell volumes of high salt buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm F5M. After a 20-min incubation period, tubes were centrifuged for 2 min at 15,000 rpm, and supernatants (nuclear fractions) were saved. F5M labeling reactions were stopped by adding 100 mm DTT to the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. Following immunoprecipitation using an anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and fluorescence intensities of proteins were analyzed as described above. NEM labeling was performed similarly to F5M labeling, except that the experiments were performed with 1 mm (in vitro) and 20 mm(in vivo) NEM. Proteins were acetone-precipitated, resuspended in a small volume of 8 m urea, and digested overnight at 37 °C with LysC in digestion buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 2 m urea, and 1 mm DTT. The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-coupled electron spray ionization time-of-flight MS system Mariner TK5000 (PerkinElmer) was used to analyze protein digests. Protein digests were initially separated on a protein/peptide ODS column with an inner diameter of 0.5 mm (PerkinElmer), using a linear gradient of 5–55% acetonitrile plus 1% formic acid at a flow rate of 5 μm/min. Peptide masses were analyzed online, using instrument settings for positive ion polarity at 3800 V spray tip potential, 130 V nozzle potential, 11.5 V skimmer 1 potential, 7.6 V quadrupole DC potential, 0.6 V deflection voltage, −37.5 V einzel lens potential, 700 V quadrupole RF voltage, 140 °C quadrupole temperature, 140 °C nozzle temperature, 700 V push pulse potential, 278 V pull pulse potential, 5 V pull bias potential, 4000 V acceleration potential, 1400 V reflector potential, and 2150 V detector voltage. RNP is defined as (MIred)/[(MIred) + (MIox)] × 100 (%), where MIred and MIox represent the mass intensities of NEM-labeled (MIred) and -unlabeled (MIox) peptides. MIred partially comprises the mass intensity of hydrolytic-NEM-labeled peptide (∼10% total NEM). For a single peptide, a series of RNP values were determined with respect to the number of protons within the peptide (1-5H+). The RNP values obtained from peptides protonated differently were usually fairly similar. Figs. 2 B and 4 B show the averages of three or more RNP values.Figure 4The reduced form of Cys-62 is critical for DNA binding by p50. Oxidized forms of p50 wild type (WT) and its mutants were incubated with increasing concentrations of TCEP for 1 h at 37 °C. Their DNA binding activities and redox states were analyzed by EMSA and fluorescence assays. C62S, C119S, C262S, and C273S represent p50 mutants carrying cysteine to serine substitutions at positions 62, 119, 262, and 273.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) pCAGGS/FLAG-His-p50 (5 μg) and pCV/neo (0.5 μg) were co-transfected into Jurkat cells (5 × 105cells) by electroporation. Cells were plated onto dishes containing RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.8% methylcellulose, and 300 μg/ml G418. After 3–4 weeks, G418-resistant clones were isolated, and expression of FLAG-His/p50 was examined by Western blotting using antibodies against p50 and FLAG. A FLAG-His/p50-expressing cell line of J-50 was maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum and 200 μg/ml G418. To measure the redox state of proteins, F5M, a maleimide derivative with a fluorescein group was employed as a thiol-modifying reagent. Maleimides irreversibly modify reduced, but not oxidized, cysteines rapidly at 4 °C at the physiological pH range (pH 6.5–8.0) where normal redox reactions can barely proceed. The thiol selectivity of maleimides is higher than those of other thiol-modifying reagents, such as iodoacetamides (25Richard P.H. Handbook of fluorescent probes and research chemicals. 6th Ed. Molecular probes, Inc., Eugene, OR1998: 47-62Google Scholar). Using F5M, the amount of proteins in the reduced state can be quantified as fluorescence intensity on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig.1 A). To assess this F5M-mediated thiol-trapping system, we initially examined a well characterized redox exchange reaction between Trx and TrxR in vitro (26Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). In the presence of NADPH, TrxR specifically reduces Trx at the two conserved cysteine residues, Cys-32 and Cys-35. A constant amount of oxidized Trx was incubated with increasing concentrations of TrxR for various times at 37 °C, and reactions were processed for F5M labeling at 4 °C. As shown in Fig. 1,B and C, the fluorescence intensity of Trx increased with time, depending on the concentration of TrxR. When both Cys-32 and Cys-35 of Trx were mutated to serine residues, fluorescence intensity did not increase to a detectable level over time. These results strongly suggest that the F5M labeling reaction is specific and permits the quantitative measurement of the protein redox states. We have previously shown using EMSA that Ref-1 stimulates DNA binding activity of p50/p50 homodimers and p50/p65 heterodimers, but not p65/p65 homodimers (15Shimizu N. Sugimoto K. Tang J. Nishi T. Sato I. Hiramoto M. Aizawa S. Hatakeyama M. Ohba R. Hatori H. Yoshikawa T. Suzuki F. Oomori A. Tanaka H. Kawaguchi H. Watanabe H. Handa H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Ref-1 activates DNA binding of NF-κB by affecting the p50 subunit. To directly determine whether Ref-1 reduces p50, we used the above F5M labeling method. Oxidized and reduced forms of p50 were prepared by incubating recombinant p50 with the oxidizing reagent diamide and the reducing reagent TCEP, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.2 A, the reduced form of p50 (lane 1) but not the oxidized form (lane 2) strongly bound to the DNA probe containing an NF-κB binding site. When oxidized p50 was incubated with increasing amounts of recombinant Ref-1 (lanes 3–5), Trx (lanes 6–7), or TrxR (lanes 9–11) for 1 min prior to EMSA or F5M labeling, only Ref-1 reduced p50 and reactivated its DNA binding activity. Even in the presence of NADPH, TrxR was unable to reduce p50 under these conditions (lane 12). The level of reduction correlated well with the level of DNA binding. To substantiate that redox exchange reactions occur between Ref-1 and p50, the redox states of both Ref-1 and p50 were monitored at different time points after mixing Ref-1 and oxidized p50. As shown in Fig.1 B, after 1 min, p50 was reduced to ∼50% of the level achieved after a 60-min incubation. Conversely, fluorescence intensity of Ref-1 was decreased to ∼60% in 1 min. We thus concluded that Ref-1 directly and rapidly reduces p50 by a redox exchange reaction. It has been suggested, but not proven, that inhibition of Ref-1 by E3330 occurs through the block of its redox activity (15Shimizu N. Sugimoto K. Tang J. Nishi T. Sato I. Hiramoto M. Aizawa S. Hatakeyama M. Ohba R. Hatori H. Yoshikawa T. Suzuki F. Oomori A. Tanaka H. Kawaguchi H. Watanabe H. Handa H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous results, E3330 suppressed Ref-1-dependent activation of DNA binding by oxidized p50 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 C, upper panel, lanes 1–6). Similarly, E3330 also inhibited the Ref-1-dependent reduction of oxidized p50 (lower panel). In contrast, E3330 did not affect redox states or DNA binding activity of the reduced form of p50. From these results, we conclude that E3330 inhibition is mediated by the block of Ref-1 redox activity. The above method is a convenient way to measure changes in the redox status of proteins. However, it may not be suitable in cases where proteins contain multiple reduced cysteines of which only a subset is subject to redox regulation because F5M labeling of non-target cysteines may cause a high basal level of fluorescence. Human p50 has seven cysteine residues at positions 62, 88, 119, 124, 162, 262, and 273. To identify cysteine residues of p50 that are reduced by Ref-1, we improved the above thiol-trapping method. The modified method comprises three steps: 1) irreversible labeling of reduced cysteines with another maleimide derivative, NEM, 2) digestion of NEM-labeled proteins by Lys-C endopeptidase, and 3) LC-MS analysis for the identification of NEM-labeled (reduced) and -unlabeled (oxidized) peptides. NEM was employed because F5M-labeled peptides could not be fully recovered from liquid chromatography, probably due to the hydrophobicity as a result of F5M labeling (data not shown). From the mass intensities of NEM-labeled and -unlabeled peptides (MIred and MIox), the fraction of reduced cysteine residues was estimated using the equation: MIred/(MIred + MIox) × 100 (%) or the ratio of NEM-labeled peptide (RNP). From the results shown in Fig. 2 A, we presumed that residues reduced by TCEP and Ref-1 should be functionally important. Recombinant p50 previously oxidized with diamide was incubated with TCEP or Ref-1 and processed as described above. Lys-C endopeptidase digests of p50 include three peptides containing a single cysteine residue and two with two cysteine residues (TableI). Fig.3 A shows representative mass spectra of the Cys-62-containing peptide. When oxidized p50 was left untreated, a large fraction of Cys-62 appeared to be fully oxidized because only the unlabeled peptide (53-77) was detected. Prior incubation with TCEP or Ref-1 resulted in the NEM-labeled peptide (53-77-NEM), indicating that Cys-62 was reduced by these reagents. The RNPs, obtained from their mass intensities, suggest that treatment of p50 with TCEP or Ref-1 resulted in ∼60 or ∼50% reduction of Cys-62 (Fig. 3 B).Table ICysteine-containing peptides of p50 resulting from Lys-C digestionPositionsSequenceNumber of NEM labeling (NEM Mw: 125.12)Theoretical mass (Z1)6253–77QRGFRFRYVCEGPSHGGLPGAS02722.33SEK12847.45880964.4987–95ICNYVGPAK11089.62119 12401430.64118–131HCEDGICTVTAGPK11555.7721680.90162150–194VFETLEARMTEACIRGYNPGLLV04988.48HPDLAYLQAEGGGDRQLGDREK15113.60262 27202542.25253–275IVRMDRTAGCVTGGEEIYLLCDK12667.3722792.50 Open table in a new tab Similarly, all cysteine-containing peptides were identified by LC-MS analysis. RNP values for these peptides are presented in Fig.3 B. For peptides containing two cysteines, RNPs were calculated for singly and doubly labeled peptides, respectively. All the cysteine residues were reduced by Ref-1 by varying degrees; however, the reduction of Cys-62 by Ref-1 was significant and highly sensitive to E3330 inhibition. For comparison, EMSAs for an identical set of reactions were performed (Fig. 3 C). The DNA binding activity of p50 correlated well with the redox states of Cys-62, indicating that Cys-62 plays a determinant role in DNA binding. Unexpectedly, TCEP did not reduce all the cysteine residues of p50. TCEP may be capable of reducing only the exposed cysteine residues under the non-denaturing condition. Consistent with this hypothesis, structural data show that thiol groups of Cys-88 and Cys-162, which were not reduced by TCEP in our experiments, are buried in the p50 protein (27Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The above results do not exclude the possibility that, in addition to Cys-62, other cysteines may play some role in redox regulation of p50. To address this issue, we carried out EMSA and fluorescence assays for point mutants of p50, whose cysteine residues at positions 62, 119, 262, and 273 were individually changed to serines (C62S, C119S, C262S, and C273S). Serine was chosen because it may mimic a reduced form of cysteine. Similar sets of the point mutants were previously described and analyzed by EMSA (12Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 28Toledano M.B. Ghosh D. Trinh F. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As observed for wild type p50, DNA binding activities of C119S, C262S, and C273S were not detectable under oxidized conditions and were strongly stimulated by TCEP in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.4). In sharp contrast, C62S showed strong DNA binding even in its oxidized form and was not affected by TCEP,i.e. by the redox states of the other cysteine residues. The results of EMSA are consistent with those of earlier reports (12Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 28Toledano M.B. Ghosh D. Trinh F. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell.

Taken together, it is very likely that Cys-62 alone is responsible for Ref-1-mediated reduction and activation of p50. Using these redox-monitoring methods, we investigated the possibility that the redox state of NF-κB is regulated during the activation processin vivo. We established a Jurkat cell line expressing p50 fused to FLAG and 6× His tags at the N terminus (J-50 cells) to obtain a sufficient quantity of homogenous NF-κB complex from cells. FLAG-His-p50 (FLAG-p50) behaved similarly to endogenous p50,i.e. it formed a ternary complex with p65 and IκBα in the cytoplasm, was translocated into the nucleus on PMA treatment concomitant with IκB degradation, and bound DNA as a heterodimer with p65 in a sequence-specific manner (data not shown). To visualize the overall redox state of NF-κB in cells, we modified the F5M labeling protocol as follows: J-50 cells were maintained with or without PMA for 30 min, labeled in situwith membrane-permeable F5M, lysed, an"

Dose- and time-dependence of inhibition showed that glycine oxidation was the most severely affected with aK 0.5 of 30 μm. Several mitochondrial proteins containing lipoic acid moieties differentially lost their reactivity to a lipoic acid antibody following HNE treatment. The most dramatic loss of antigenicity was seen with the 17-kDa glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC) H-protein, which was correlated with the loss of glycine-dependent O2 consumption. Paraquat treatment of pea seedlings induced lipid peroxidation, which resulted in the rapid loss of glycine-dependent respiration and loss of H-protein reactivity with lipoic acid antibodies. Pea plants exposed to chilling and water deficit responded similarly. In contrast, the damage to other lipoic acid-containing mitochondrial enzymes was minor under these conditions. The implication of the acute sensitivity of glycine decarboxylase complex H-protein to lipid peroxidation products is discussed in the context of photorespiration and potential repair mechanisms in plant mitochondria.

These two end products are commonly measured in studies of lipid peroxidation by the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) assay (1Hodges D.M. DeLong J.M. Forney C.F. Prange R.K. Planta. 1999; 207: 604-611Crossref Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). Interest in the biological effect of HNE was stimulated by studies showing cytotoxicity due to rapid reaction with sulfydryl groups via Michael addition (2Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5889) Google Scholar). A number of stress conditions, including cardiac reperfusion injury, increase ROS production and the rate of membrane peroxidation and ultimately lead to inhibition of the respiratory rate in mammals (3Lucas D.T. Szweda L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). HNE has been shown to directly inhibit respiration of isolated mammalian mitochondria through modification of the lipoic acid moieties of 2-oxo acid dehydrogenases, forming HNE-Michael adducts (Fig. 1) (4Humphries K.M. Yoo Y. Szweda L.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These targets have also been shown to be damaged in vivo under conditions that induce lipid peroxidation (5Lucas D.T. Szweda L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6689-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A range of biotic and abiotic stresses also raise ROS levels in plants due to perturbations of chloroplastic and mitochondrial metabolism and the generation of ROS in defense responses (6Van Camp W. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 330-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Such accumulation of ROS in plants will clearly result in a wide variety of deleterious effects through oxidation reactions involving proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Lipid peroxidation in plants has been known for many years, but direct evidence of the pathways involved and the identification of HNE production in plants has only been reported recently (7Takamura H. Gardner H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the exact molecular targets, the relative sensitivity of target enzymes, the mechanisms of repair, and the impact on plant function have not been extensively investigated. Research on the impact of plant lipid peroxidation on metabolism has centered on investigations of sensitive reactions in the chloroplast and the antioxidant systems present in this organelle (8Mano J. Ohno C. Domae Y. Asada K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 275-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 9Kraus T.E. McKersie B.D. Fletcher R.A. J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 145: 570-576Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the impact of lipid peroxidation on plant mitochondrial functions is still very limited. Recently we have shown that HNE specifically inhibits both pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDC) and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDC) complexes through modification of lipoic acid moieties (Fig. 1) in mitochondria from potato tubers. However, in photosynthetic plant tissues, these tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes are dwarfed by the presence of the glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC). This enzyme also contains a lipoic acid moiety, can account for up to 50% of matrix protein, and is responsible for the most prominent metabolic activity in the mitochondria of illuminated leaves, photorespiration (10Douce R. Bourguignon J. Neuburger M. Rebeille F. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 167-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). GDC is a multienzyme complex composed of four component enzymes, the P-, H-, T-, and L-proteins and is responsible for the conversion of glycine produced in the peroxisome to serine in the mitochondria during operation of the photorespiratory cycle (11Vauclare P. Diallo N. Bourguignon J. Macherel D. Douce R. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1523-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The H-protein plays a pivotal role as a mobile substrate that commutes between the other subunits, allowing its lipoic acid “arm” to visit the active sites of the other three components (10Douce R. Bourguignon J. Neuburger M. Rebeille F. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 167-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Here we show that HNE rapidly inhibits glycine-dependent respiration of isolated pea leaf mitochondria and that the site of this inhibition is the H-protein of GDC. This site is much more sensitive to oxidative damage than those of related 2-oxo acid dehydrogenases. Further, we show that in vivolipid peroxidation, induced by the herbicide paraquat and by the environmental stresses of chilling and water deficit, specifically inhibits the ability of mitochondria to oxidize glycine. GDC is, therefore, a major target for oxidative damage in leaf mitochondria. Tryquat 200 (Crop Care Australasia Pty. Ltd., Pinkenba, Australia) is a commercially available herbicide combination of paraquat (437.5 mg/L) and diquat (225 mg/L). Studies on the mode of action of these two components appear to indicate that both function identically (12Dodge A.D. Endeavour. 1971; 30: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and this combination is referred to here simply as paraquat. HNE was obtained from Calbiochem, and all other chemicals were at least reagent-grade. Pea (Pisum sativum L. cv Green Feast) plants were germinated in vermiculite and grown in controlled environment chambers with a light intensity of 700 μmol/m2/sec at 24 °C and 65% humidity for 10 days on a 16/8-hour day/night cycle. Mitochondria were isolated according to the methods of Day et al. (13Day D.A. Neuburger M. Douce R. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1985; 12: 219-228Crossref Google Scholar) and Zhang and Wiskich (14Zhang Q. Wiskich J.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) from ∼60 g of leaves. Leaves were disrupted with a Polytron (Kinematica, Kriens, Switzerland) in 250 ml of cold extraction medium (0.3 M sucrose, 25 mm tetra-sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm glycine, 1% (w/v) PVP-40, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 20 mm ascorbate, pH 7.5). The homogenate was filtered through 4 layers of miracloth and centrifuged for 5 min at 1100 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged for 20 min at 18,000 × g and the pellet resuspended in 200 ml of wash medium (0.3 M sucrose, 10 mm TES, 1 mmglycine, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5) and centrifuged for 5 min at 1100 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged for 20 min at 18,000 × g and the pellet resuspended in 10 ml of wash medium. 5-ml aliquots were then layered over 27.5 ml of solution (0.3 M sucrose, 10 mm TES, 1 mmglycine, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 28% (v/v) Percoll, and a linear gradient of 0–10% (w/v) PVP-40, pH 7.5) in a centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 40 min at 40,000 × g. The mitochondria were found as a tight light yellow-brown band near the bottom of the tube. The mitochondrial fraction was removed and diluted in 250 ml of wash medium and centrifuged at 31,000 × gfor 15 min. The supernatant was removed, and this wash was repeated. The final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in ∼1 ml of wash medium. Isolated pea mitochondria were treated with HNE and a number of co-factors and substrates before assays were carried out. Mitochondria for glycine oxidation assays were incubated for 60 min on ice with 10 mm glycine and 0.5 mm ATP to maximize GDC activity as described by Zhang and Wiskich (14Zhang Q. Wiskich J.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These mitochondria were then incubated with 250 μl of assay buffer, glycine (10 mm), NAD (0.5 mm), ATP (0.5 mm), ADP (0.25 mm), and various concentrations of HNE (1.5–250 μm) for 10 min. 750 μl of assay buffer was then added and electrode traces started, with additions of ADP at appropriate times. For pyruvate (+ malate) oxidation assays, mitochondria were incubated for 10 min with pyruvate (10 mm), malate (1 mm), NAD (0.5 mm), TPP (0.05 mm), CoA (0.06 mm), ATP (0.5 mm), ADP (0.25 mm), and HNE (1.5–250 μm). For 2-oxoglutarate oxidation assays, mitochondria were incubated with 2-oxoglutarate (10 mm), NAD (0.5 mm), TPP (0.05 mm), CoA (0.06 mm), ATP (0.5 mm), ADP (0.25 mm), and HNE (1.5–250 μm). Again, 750 μl of assay buffer was then added and electrode traces started, with additions of ADP at appropriate times. Plants were sprayed evenly with paraquat (662.5 mg/L), allowed to dry, and then returned to controlled environment chambers and exposed to light until harvest. For low temperature treatment, plants were placed at 4 °C for 36 h prior to harvest while maintaining a normal day/night light cycle. For drought treatment, plants were not watered for 7 days prior to harvest while maintaining a normal humidity, temperature, and day/night light cycle. O2 consumption was measured in an O2 electrode (Rank Bros., Cambridge, UK) in 1 ml of reaction medium containing 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm TES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mmKH2PO4, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgSO4, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Glycine (10 mm), pyruvate (10 mm), malate (0.5 mm), 2-oxoglutarate (10 mm), succinate (10 mm), NADH (1 mm), NAD (0.5 mm), TPP (0.05 mm), CoA (0.06 mm), ATP (0.5 mm), ADP (0.1–1 mm), and HNE (1.5–250 μm) were added as indicated. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Peterson (15Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7127) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. We used the method of Hodges et al.(1Hodges D.M. DeLong J.M. Forney C.F. Prange R.K. Planta. 1999; 207: 604-611Crossref Scopus (2812) Google Scholar), which takes into account the presence of anthocyanins and sucrose. Approximately 1 g of tissue was homogenized in 80% (v/v) ethanol and inert sand in a pestle and mortar, followed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. Six 1-ml aliquots of the supernatant were placed in 2-ml cryovials and 1 ml of −TBA solution (20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, 0.01% (w/v) butylated hydroxytoluene) was added to three tubes and +TBA (0.65% (w/v) thiobarbituric acid, 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, 0.01% (w/v) butylated hydroxytoluene) added to the other three. The samples were vortexed and heated to 95 °C for 25 min, followed by cooling on ice for 5 min. The samples were then spun at 3000 × g for 10 min and absorbances of each sample read at 440, 532, and 600 nm. The amount of MDA equivalents was calculated from Equation 1, MDA equivalents(nmol ml−1)=(A­B/157000)106Equation 1 where A = [(A532+TBA)-(A600+TBA)-(A532-TBA-A600-TBA)] and B = [(A440+TBA-A600+TBA)0.0571]. Mitochondria from in vitroassays were treated with cysteine (10 mm) to remove any unreacted HNE and spun at 17,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in the original mitochondria volume (20 μl). 5 μl of mitochondrial proteins were separated by electrophoresis under denaturing reducing conditions on 0.1% (w/v) SDS-12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Similarly, mitochondria from abiotic stress treatments were electrophoresed under denaturing, reducing conditions on 0.1% (w/v) SDS-12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). For immunoreaction experiments, proteins were electroblotted from SDS-PAGE gels onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocked. 1/10,000 dilution of the anti-lipoic acid serum (17Humphries K.M. Szweda L.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15835-15841Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), 1/1000 dilution of the anti-H-protein of GDC serum, and 1/50 dilution of the anti-alternative oxidase (AOX) serum (18Elthon T.E. Nickels R.L. McIntosh L. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 1311-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used as primary antibodies. Chemiluminescence was used for detection of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using a LAS 1000 (Fuji). The blots were quantified using the Image Gauge v3.0 software (Fuji) with the control band denoted as 100%; the other bands were calculated relative to that value. Two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/SDS-PAGE of pea mitochondrial samples was performed according to Millar et al. (19Millar A.H. Sweetlove L.J. Giege P. Leaver C.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1711-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Western blotting and detection were performed as above. Quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF MS/MS) was performed on an Applied Biosystems Q-STAR Pulsar using an IonSpray source. Proteins to be analyzed were cut from the two-dimensional PAGE gel, dried at 50 °C in a dry block heater, and stored at −70 °C. For the sequencing analysis, the proteins were digested with trypsin (19Millar A.H. Sweetlove L.J. Giege P. Leaver C.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1711-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) and injected in 50% acetonitrile, and selected doubly charged peptides were fragmented by N2 collision and analyzed by MS/MS. Mass spectra and collision MS/MS data were analyzed with BioAnalyst software (Applied Biosystems, Sydney, Australia). Data is presented as the m/z of the peptide followed by its charge state and the deduced amino acid sequence (X = undetermined; (L/I) = leucine or isoleucine residue indistinguishable on mass). Recent demonstrations of inhibition of lipoic acid-containing tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes by HNE, in both mammalian (4Humphries K.M. Yoo Y. Szweda L.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 17Humphries K.M. Szweda L.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15835-15841Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and plant (20Millar A.H. Leaver C.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) mitochondria, prompted us to investigate the effect of this lipid peroxidation product on the photorespiratory enzyme, GDC, in pea leaves. Isolated pea leaf mitochondria were incubated for 10 min in the presence of ADP, cofactors, various substrates (including glycine), and HNE at concentrations from 0 to 250 μm. Following incubation, O2 consumption was recorded (Fig.2 A). At concentrations up to 50 μm, HNE had no significant effect on pyruvate- or 2-oxoglutarate-dependent respiration but inhibited GDC by 75%. At 250 μm HNE, pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent respiration decreased by ∼45%, while glycine-dependent respiration was inhibited by more than 90%. To learn more about the nature of this inhibition, we incubated isolated mitochondria with 85 μmHNE in the presence of cofactors and various substrates for different lengths of time before measuring O2 consumption (Fig.2 B). After 30 min of incubation, 2-oxoglutarate-dependent respiration was decreased by ∼10%, pyruvate-dependent O2 consumption by ∼30%, and glycine-dependent respiration by more than 80%. The data presented in Fig. 2 B indicate that the inhibition of respiration by HNE increases with time. This means that oxidative damage will be cumulative in vivo. We also showed that free lipoic acid could protect these lipoic acid-containing proteins from inhibition by HNE. Inclusion of 500 μm free lipoic acid during incubation of isolated mitochondria with 85 μm HNE for 10 min decreased inhibition to only 20% (data not shown), compared with 80% inhibition in incubations without free lipoic acid (Fig. 2 A). Immunodetection of SDS-PAGE-separated pea mitochondrial proteins, with antibodies raised to lipoic acid, showed four protein bands of apparent molecular masses 78, 54, 50, and 17 kDa (Fig.3). Previous reports in potato identified these proteins, respectively, as the two acetyltransferase subunits of PDC, the succinyltransferase subunit of OGDC, and the H-protein of GDC. The GDC H-protein (∼17 kDa) can be distinguished from the acyl carrier protein (∼14 kDa) by size and antibody reaction and from the ∼ 50-kDa subunits of PDC and OGDC by comparison with the purified PDC and OGDC from potato (20Millar A.H. Leaver C.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Previous work on partially purified pea PDC has shown that this enzyme also contains two acetyltransferase subunits of ∼80 and 55 kDa (21Millar A.H. Leaver C.J. Hill S.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22Thelen J.J. Muszynski M.G. David N.R. Luethy M.H. Elthon T.E. Miernyk J.A. Randall D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21769-21775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and that a contaminating 50-kDa protein was likely to be the succinyltransferase of pea OGDC (21Millar A.H. Leaver C.J. Hill S.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To confirm that the lower of the two ∼50-kDa proteins in pea is indeed the succinyltransferase of OGDC and that the 17-kDa protein is the H-protein of GDC, we undertook two-dimensional gel separation and mass spectrometry identification of these lipoic acid-containing proteins. Three peptides derived from the 17-kDa protein (849.48 [M+2H]2+, (L/I)KPTSPDE(L/I)ESS(L/I)(L/I)GAK; 558.77 [M+3H]2+, XAPSHEWVK; 423.27 [M+2H]2+, XXSNV(L/I)DG(L/I)K) were identical to the H-protein sequence of GDC from P. sativum(GenBankTM accession number 1923203A). Three peptides derived from the 50-kDa protein (639.34 [M+3H]2+, PSEPQ(L/I)PPKER; 696.38 [M+2H]2+, DY(L/I)D(L/I)S(L/I)AVGTPK; 525.32 [M+2H]2+, APVVGGVVVPR) matched 73–85% with a dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase fromArabidopsis thaliana (GenBankTM accession numberT04814). Having confirmed these identities, aliquots of mitochondria were sampled during oxidation of different substrates in the presence of added HNE, treated with cysteine (10 mm) to quench any remaining HNE, separated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted, and probed with antibodies raised against lipoic acid and against the pea H-protein (Fig. 3). Anti-lipoic acid antibodies revealed a decrease in antigenicity of PDC and OGDC E2 subunits upon treatment with HNE, consistent with the declines in respiratory rate noted in Fig.2 A. The decline in lipoic acid antigenicity of the H-protein was much more rapid. A plot of anti-lipoic acid antibody reactivity of H-protein versus glycine-dependent respiration rates showed a strong positive correlation with an initial slope of 0.9 (r2 = 0.9352) (analysis not shown). This suggests that the amount of active lipoic acid associated with H-protein has a very high control coefficient over the activity of GDC in intact mitochondria. Immunoblotting with antibodies raised to the pea H-protein itself revealed that there was no direct loss of H-protein following HNE addition. At very high HNE concentrations, when nearly all lipoic acid had been modified, H-protein began to separate into several bands on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3), suggesting the formation of further modifications of H-protein polypeptides. These forms, which appear to have a higher molecular mass, may arise from the attachment of HNE to amino acid side chains of H-protein or covalent attachment of an unknown compound produced at high HNE concentrations. The exact nature of these modified forms of the H-protein is yet to be confirmed. The herbicide paraquat acts as an artificial electron acceptor from chloroplast Photosystem I (12Dodge A.D. Endeavour. 1971; 30: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and also inhibits and uncouples the mitochondrial electron transport chain (23Palmeira C.M. Moreno A.J. Madeira V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), thereby exacerbating the production of superoxide radicals in both locations. Through a cascade of reactions stimulated by transition metals (24Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 36-104Google Scholar) and by reaction with hydrogen peroxide, this produces hydroxyl radicals, which initiate lipid peroxidation (25Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 246-350Google Scholar). We used paraquat to induce oxidative stress in pea leaves. Pea plants sprayed with paraquat (662.5 mg/L) were maintained in the light, and leaves were harvested at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 h later. Leaves from all times points were used for TBARS assays to assess the abundance of lipid peroxidation end products (MDA equivalents). Leaves from 0, 2, 6, and 12 h were also used for isolation of mitochondria for assessment of respiratory activities (Fig.4). MDA equivalents remained relatively constant during the first 6 h before rising 4-fold and peaking at 10 h post-treatment. Pyruvate- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent respiration were unaffected by this treatment of leaves, but glycine-dependent respiration declined sharply to ∼40% of control after 12 h. Immunoblotting with the same antibodies used in Fig. 3 revealed no change in PDC or OGDC E2 subunit reactivity, whereas H-protein lipoic acid reactivity decreased to 44% of the control (Fig.5). The amount of H-protein per se did not change during the first 6 h but did decrease marginally between 6 and 12 h.Figure 5Effect of paraquat on anti-lipoic acid antibody, anti-H-protein, and anti-AOX antibody reactivity against pea mitochondrial proteins. Mitochondria were isolated from herbicide-treated pea plants at the times shown, and their proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Numbers on the left represent apparent molecular masses in kDa, those above the blots represent time of herbicide treatment, and those below the blots represent relative band intensity. The 78- and 54-kDa bands are the E2 subunits of PDC, the 50-kDa is the E2 of OGDC, and the 17-kDa (Lip A) is the H-protein of GDC, all using the anti-lipoic acid antibody (17Humphries K.M. Szweda L.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15835-15841Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The H-Pro panel (17 kDa) is the H-protein of GDC detected with an anti-H-protein antibody. The 31- and 32-kDa bands in the AOX panel are AOX proteins detected with the anti-AOX antibody (18Elthon T.E. Nickels R.L. McIntosh L. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 1311-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Concomitant with the appearance of MDA following paraquat treatment, AOX protein, which initially was expressed at very low levels, increased dramatically (Fig. 5). AOX is often proposed as a preoxidant defense in plants, induced to prevent radical formation from the mitochondrial electron transport pathway (26Maxwell D.P. Wang Y. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8271-8276Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 27Purvis A.C. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 165-170Crossref Google Scholar, 28Wagner A.M. Krab K. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 95: 318-325Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Its induction in pea leaves by paraquat application agrees with this idea, but apparently it was unable to protect GDC from damage. A number of environmental stresses have been shown to induce oxidative stress in plants. These include salinity (29Hernandez J.A. Corpas F.J. Gomez M. del Rio L.A. Sevilla F. Physiol. Plant. 1993; 89: 103-110Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 30Gomez J.M. Hernandez J.A. Jimenez A. del Rio L.A. Sevilla F. Free Radical Res. 1999; 31: S11-S18Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), chilling (31Prasad T.K. Anderson M.D. Martin B.A. Stewart C.R. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar), and water deficit (32Iturbe-Ormaetxe I. Escuredo Pedro R. Arrese-Igor C. Becana M. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 173-181Crossref Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the production of ROS under these conditions remains unclear, but measurements of both ROS and lipid peroxidation products, as well as responses of antioxidant enzymes, have confirmed the oxidative state of the exposed plants. We investigated the effect of two such environmental stresses on pea leaf mitochondria: low temperature and drought. For the low temperature treatment, plants were chilled at 4 °C for 36 h prior to harvest. For drought treatment, plants were water-restricted for 7 days prior to harvest. Leaves were subsequently harvested from three trays of plants from each treatment, as well as from three trays of 12-h paraquat-treated peas, and used for isolation of mitochondria for assessment of respiratory activities (Fig.6 B). Glycine-dependent respiration was significantly inhibited by all treatments: 58% by low temperature, 63% by water stress, and 72% by the herbicide treatment. These same mitochondria were also assayed for succinate/NADH-dependent O2consumption, with the treatment groups showing no significant difference to the control (p > 0.3, data not shown). Immunoblotting with the same antibodies used in Fig. 3 revealed only minor changes in PDC or OGDC E2 subunit reactivity, whereas H-protein lipoic acid reactivity decreased to 49% of the control in chilled plants, 17% in water-stressed plants, and 21% in the herbicide-treated plants. (Fig. 6 A). The amount of H-proteinper se did not change significantly in any of the treatments. The effect of these treatments on AOX protein was also examined. Its induction in pea leaves was associated with the oxidative conditions generated by the environmental stresses but, as in the herbicide-treated plants, its induction did not protect GDC from damage. Plant mitochondrial lipid peroxidation has been reported previously (33Vianello A. Macri F. Cavallini L. Bindoli A. J. Plant Physiol. 1986; 125: 217-224Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 34Vianello A. Macri F. Bindoli A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1987; 28: 1263-1270Google Scholar, 35De Santis A. Landi P. Genchi G. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), but the functional implications of this damage for mitochondrial operation was not clear from these studies. It has also been shown previously that HNE has a significant inhibitory effect on tricarboxylic acid cycle function through modification of lipoic acid moieties of key enzymes (4Humphries K.M. Yoo Y. Szweda L.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 17Humphries K.M. Szweda L.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15835-15841Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 20Millar A.H. Leaver C.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Here we have shown for the first time that HNE has an even greater inhibitory effect on the lipoic acid-containing enzyme, glycine decarboxylase, a key enzyme involved in photorespiration in photosynthetic plant tissues and essential for the regeneration of Calvin cycle substrates in the photorespiratory pathway. The effect of HNE was much more dramatic on glycine-dependent respiration than on tricarboxylic acid cycle-dependent respiration, suggesting that GDC is particularly sensitive to HNE modification and may be a key target during oxidative stress in photosynthetic plant tissues. Consistent with this suggestion, we observed a substantial decline in GDC activity following in vivo oxidative stress induced by paraquat treatment, by chilling, and by water deficit. Taken together, the results with isolated mitochondria and intact plants suggest that environmental stress leads directly to lipid peroxidation, the products of which can inhibit mitochondrial function and, in particular, photorespiratory metabolism. In pea plants treated with paraquat, MDA equivalents were detected only after several hours. Lipid peroxidation is expected to commence immediately following paraquat application; the delayed detection of MDA accumulation may indicate that different aldehyde end products take varying times to accumulate to measurable levels because of the presence and function of detoxification pathways in the plant. However, as time passes, these defenses are presumably overwhelmed and lipid peroxidation products rise sharply. The high degree of damage to the H-protein of GDC before MDA equivalents were detected by the methods employed here suggests extreme susceptibility of the H-protein subunit to low concentrations of lipid peroxidation end products, before dilution and/or detoxification takes effect. At this early time point, there were no noticeable effects on plant appearance by the treatments. In this context, GDC inhibition may be an early marker of oxidative damage in photosynthetic plant cells. Glycine metabolism by GDC is an essential step in the photorespiratory cycle, and its inhibition or suppression in leaves is lethal under ambient conditions (36Wingler A. Lea P.J. Quick W.P. Leegood R.C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. B. 2000; 355: 1517-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The extreme sensitivity of GDC to the treatments applied here suggests, therefore, that photorespiration is among the first casualties of oxidative damage in leaves. The mechanisms for detoxifying cytotoxic lipid peroxidation products in plants are only beginning to be understood. Recently, an aldehyde reductase (37Oberschall A. Deak M. Torok K. Sass L. Vass I. Kovacs I. Feher A. Dudits D. Horvath G.V. Plant J. 2000; 24: 437-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been identified in both the mitochondria and the cytoplasm that reacts with HNE. A glutathioneS-transferase, which uses HNE as a substrate, has been identified in mammalian mitochondria (38Ålin P. Danielson U.H. Mannervik B. FEBS Lett. 1985; 179: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 39Hubatsch I. Ridderstrom M. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and in the monocotSorghum bicolour (40Gronwald J.W. Plaisance K.L. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 877-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that a recently identified maize T cytoplasm cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) restorer gene, rf2, which encodes an aldehyde dehydrogenase, may act in mitochondria to remove the end products of lipid peroxidation such as MDA and HNE (41Liu F. Cui X.Q. Horner H.T. Weiner H. Schnable P.S. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1063-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 42Møller I.M. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the leaves of the pea plants used in the present study, the putative anti-oxidant protein, AOX, was induced about 6 h after herbicide treatment, coincidentally with the observed rise in MDA (Fig. 5). This suggests three things. First, it shows that nuclear-encoded mitochondrial defense proteins can be readily made and imported during the extreme oxidative stress following paraquat treatment, indicating that this treatment does not simply lead to rapid death and necrosis of the plant tissues studied. Second, this induction of AOX correlated with total cell lipid damage rather than the mitochondrial-specific damage of GDC, raising some questions about the degree to which AOX induction is due solely to radical formation in mitochondria. Third, it shows that such gene induction-based defense of mitochondria, at least as exemplified by AOX, is too slow to save highly susceptible sites such as the H-protein of GDC. However, induction of AOX may have helped to delay damage to the less susceptible tricarboxylic acid enzymes. We have previously postulated (20Millar A.H. Leaver C.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) that the well documented inhibition of PDC by phosphorylation in the light (43Budde R.J.A. Randall D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) might aid in saving the lipoic acid moieties of this enzyme during higher rates of lipid peroxidation likely to be experienced during photosynthesis. There would be no such reprieve for GDC, because glycine is likely to be the dominant respiratory substrate in the light under photorespiratory conditions. Rapid catalytic turnover of GDC will provide ready availability of the reduced form of lipoic acid, which is required for modification by HNE (4Humphries K.M. Yoo Y. Szweda L.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The identification of pathways for lipoic acid attachment to acyltransferase subunits in mitochondria (44Jordan S.W. Cronan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17903-17906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and the discovery of a pathway for de novo lipoic acid synthesis in plant mitochondria from photosynthetic tissues (45Gueguen V. Macherel D. Jaquinod M. Douce R. Bourguignon J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5016-5025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have largely been viewed in terms of the biogenesis of matrix enzymes. However, an enzyme able to remove damaged lipoic acid, regenerating the apoprotein and allowing reattachment of an unmodified lipoate to Lys-63 of P. sativum H-protein, a so-called but as yet undiscovered ‘lipoate lyase,‘ would allow this biogenesis pathway to play an equally vital role in damage repair. Such an approach would eliminate the need for complicated removal and reassembly of E2 subunits in large oligometric complexes and greatly reduce the cost of lipoic acid modification. We thank Dr. K.

The subsequent inflammatory defense reaction coordinates neutrophil recruitment and macrophage activation through release of TNFα, chemokines, oxygen radical products, and proteases.

LPS binds to soluble LPS-binding protein present in the alveolar fluid and is then transferred to CD14 expressed on alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells (2Martin T.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and, in conjunction with MD-2 signals via, at least, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). TLR4 initiates an IL-1β receptor-like signaling (7Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4344) Google Scholar) promoting NFκB activation. Currently, this is thought to involve the myeloid differentiation protein (MyD88) and MyD88-adapter-like (Mal) adapter molecules, recruitment and activation of IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK), and complexing with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which activates NFκB through activation of NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK) as reviewed in Refs. 8Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar and 9Beutler B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar. NFκB subsequently promotes the release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, neutrophil-recruiting chemokines, and matrix metalloproteases. However, mice lacking theIRAK gene remain partially responsive to IL-1 and LPS (10Swantek J.L. Tsen M.F. Cobb M.H. Thomas J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4301-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), suggesting that TLR4 signals via IRAK-dependent and -independent pathways to promote NFκB-mediated cytokine expression. GM-CSF, which was originally purified and cloned from lung tissue of endotoxin-treated mice, is a major survival and proliferative factor for hematopoietic cells and primes mature macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils, and respiratory epithelium for inflammatory effector functions (11Klein J.B. Buridi A. Coxon P.Y. Rane M.J. Manning T. Kettritz R. McLeish K.R. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast to almost all other tissues, low level basal GM-CSF is required for normal pulmonary physiology as mice deficient in GM-CSF develop fatal alveolar proteinosis that can be rescued by overexpression of the PU.1 transcription factor (12Shibata Y. Berclaz P.Y. Chroneos Z.C. Yoshida M. Whitsett J.A. Trapnell B.C. Immunity. 2001; 15: 557-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Since endogenous GM-CSF regulates the intensity of inflammation and strongly activates Akt and Erk kinases, we reasoned that these GM-CSF-regulated kinases might contribute to the lung LPS response (13Dijkers P.F. van Dijk T.B. de Groot R.P. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3334-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14Klein J.B. Rane M.J. Scherzer J.A. Coxon P.Y. Kettritz R. Mathiesen J.M. Buridi A. McLeish K.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4286-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In particular, Akt promotes NFκB activity by phosphorylating IκB kinase-α (IKK-α) in response to TNFα and platelet-derived growth factor (15Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar, 16Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar), which liberates the transcription factor from IκB to initiate nuclear translocation and DNA binding. In addition, Akt induces trans-activation of the p65/RelA subunit of NFκB in response to oncogenic Ras and IL-1β (17Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), a process required for full activation that is distinct from nuclear translocation and DNA binding. GM-CSF also promotes activation of Erk1/2 MAPK homolog, which belongs to a family of universal signal transduction molecules involved in a wide variety of biological responses including regulation of the AP-1 transcription factor complex. The MAPK homologs (Erk1/2, p38, and JNK) promote AP-1 expression and activity by direct phosphorylation. Since MAPK homologs display overlapping substrate specificities that respond in a cell type- and stimuli-specific manner (18Leppa S. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), we investigated the growth factor-regulated Erk1/2 and stress-activated p38 homologs. In the present study, we performed detailed kinetic analyses of the LPS response and report the in vivo activation of Akt and Erk1/2 kinases but not p38 in LPS-inflamed lungs, which is GM-CSF-dependent. Furthermore, the activation status of Akt and Erk1/2 temporally correlated with NFκB and AP-1 DNA binding activity, implicating the kinases as central signal transduction modules in LPS-induced lung inflammation. Our data indicate the molecular mechanisms by which GM-CSF augments innate immunity to Gram-negative pathogens but also suggest that anti-GM-CSF-mediated suppression of Akt and Erk may have clinical implications in inflammatory diseases characterized by exuberant cytokine and protease expression, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and asthma, in which LPS has been implicated. Specific pathogen-free male BALB/c mice aged 6–7 weeks old and weighing ∼20 g were obtained from the Animal Resource Center Pty. Ltd. (Perth, Australia), housed at 20 °C on a 12-h day/night cycle in sterile micro-isolators, and fed a standard sterile diet of Purina mouse chow with water allowed ad libitum. All animal handling and experimental procedures, which were performed aseptically, were approved by the Animal Experimental Ethics Committee of the University of Melbourne and conformed to International standards of animal welfare as specified in the National Health and Medical Research Committee (NHMRC) of Australia guidelines.

Inflammation was induced by transnasally instilling a maximally tolerated dose of LPS (10 μg of Escherichia ColiSerotype 026:B6, Sigma, in 35 μl of in PBS vehicle) into the lungs of groups of 8–10 mice anesthetized with 2% enflurane (Abbott) in air, which uniformly distributes LPS throughout the lungs (20Blyth D.I.

Total cell counts and viabilities were determined by ethidium bromide/acridine orange (Molecular Probes) fluorescent viability stains using Neubauer hemocytometer. Cytocentrifuge preparations (Shandon Cytospin 3) using 100 μl of BAL were differentiated according to standard morphological criteria counting at least 500 cells/(DiffQuik, Ziess, Axiolab, ×1000). Murine GM-CSF and TNFα levels were analyzed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmingen, limit of detection 10 ng/ml). Following lavage, the lungs were perfused via the right ventricle with 5 ml of PBS to remove intravascular leukocytes, removed, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground, and stored at −80 °C. For preparation of whole cell extracts, 10 mg of ground lung tissue was resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonident P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm benzamadine, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Following a 15-min incubation on ice, homogenates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min (16000 × g at 4 °C). For nuclear extraction, 10 mg of lung tissue was resuspended in 500 μl of nuclear lysis buffer 1 (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 15 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% Nonident P-40, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min on ice. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 800 × g for 30 s and lysed in 500 μl of nuclear lysis buffer 2 (50 mmHEPES (pH 7.6), 400 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Following a 30-min incubation on ice, the nuclei extract (supernatant) was retained following centrifugation for 10 min (800 × g at 4 °C). Protein concentrations from whole and nuclear extracts were determined using the Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad), and all extracts were stored at −80 °C. Total RNA was isolated from 10 mg of whole lung tissue according to the manufacturers' instructions using the Rneasy kit (Qiagen). The purified total RNA prep was used as a template to generate cDNA. The reaction mix containing 1 μg of RNA, 0.5 μg of random hexamers (Promega), 15 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase enzyme (Promega), and 20 units of Rnasin (Promega) in reverse transcriptase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm spermadine) was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction was terminated at 90 °C for 2 min and cooled to 4 °C. The quantitative PCR was performed by ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) using predeveloped Taqman probe/primer combinations for GM-CSF, 18 S rRNA, and TNFα optimized by the manufacturer. Taqman PCR was performed in 10-μl volumes using AmpliTaq Gold polymerase and universal reaction buffer (Applied Biosystems). Threshold cycle numbers were transformed using the ΔΔCt and relative value method as described by the manufacturer and were expressed relative to 18 S rRNA, which was used as a housekeeping gene by multiplexing single reactions. The data were then compared with levels in the PBS control group and are presented as fold increase over PBS alone. The following pairs of complimentary oligonucleotides with 4 nucleotide overhangs were used to generate double-stranded DNA for NFκB and AP1 binding sites: NFκB sense, 5′-CATGCAACAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAGG and NFκB antisense, 5′-CATGCCTCTCGGAAAGTCCCCTCTGTTG-3′; AP1 sense, 5′-CATGCGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′ and AP1 antisense, 5′-CTAGTTCCGGCTGACTCATCAAGCG-3′. Complimentary pairs of oligonucleotides (50 ng) were annealed and radiolabelled using 5 units of Klenow fragment (Promega) in the presence of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm dGTP, 0.2 mm dCTP, 0.2 mm dTTP, and 100 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (Geneworks). Labeled probes were then separated from unincorporated isotope by size exclusion chromatography using Microspin G-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were used in binding assays in 20-μl reactions and incubated at room temperature with labeled probe (50,000 cpm) in the presence of 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.05 mg/ml poly[dI-dC]·poly[dI-dC], 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 50 mm NaCl for 20 min. Following incubation, 15 μl of binding reaction was immediately resolved on a 7.5% gel slab (37.5 acrylamide: 1 bis-acrylamide) in 0.5× TBE at 200 V for 20–30 min. Gels were prepared 1 day prior to experiment and prerun for 30 min before binding reactions were loaded. Gels were then dried and exposed to autoradiography using an Intensifier screen at −80 °C. Densitometry was performed using Kodak EDAS 1D image analysis software. The specificity of the assay was confirmed in separate shift assays on the same nuclear extracts, demonstrating that antibody to the p50 subunit of NFκB supershifted both bands (not shown). Whole cell extracts (30 μg) were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer, denatured at 90 °C for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% gel slabs with 5% stacking gels at 200 V for 45 min. Resolved proteins were transferred onto Hybond polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using Trans-blot S.D. transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 10 V for 30 min. Following transfer, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated in blocking solution (Tris-buffered saline containing 5% (w/v) skim milk powder and 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The activation status of Akt, Erk1/2, and p38 was then assessed using phospho-specific antibodies (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), which recognize activated forms of these kinases. Actin levels were also assessed as a loading control using an antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) that reacts with a broad range of actin isoforms. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. Following primary incubation, membranes were washed three times in blocking solution and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG (Bio-Rad). A final wash over 30 min with six changes in wash buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20) was performed. Immunoreactive bands were finally visualized by autoradiography using chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) with exposure times of 30 s to 2 min. Densitometry was performed using Kodak EDAS 1D image analysis software. Zymography was used to assess protease expression in response to LPS treatment. Briefly, SDS-PAGE mini-gels (10%) were prepared with the incorporation of gelatin (2 mg/ml, Labchem) before casting. BALF (10 μl) was run into gels at a constant voltage of 200 V under non-reducing conditions. When the dye front reached the bottom, gels were removed and washed twice for 15 min in 2.5% Triton X-100 and incubated at 37 °C overnight in zymography buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm ZnCl2and 0.01% NaN3). The gels were then stained for 45 min with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Sigma) and extensively destained. Following destaining, zones of enzyme activity appeared clear against the Coomassie Blue background. BALF was also tested for net gelatinase activity using fluorescence-conjugated gelatin (Molecular Probes). The gelatin substrate (10 μg) was diluted in 50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% NaN3 and incubated at room temperature for 16 h with 100 μl of neat BALF. The digested substrate has absorption/emission maxima at 495 nm/515 nm, and its fluorescence intensity was measured in a microplate reader (Victor II, Wallac) to detect quantitative differences in activity. Trachea and main bronchi were isolated free of adherent connective tissue from untreated anesthetized mice and placed in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube containing 250 μl of RPMI. For vehicle treatments, 0.1% Me2SO (final v/v) was added. Wortmannin (Sigma) and U0126 (Cell Signaling) were added to a final concentration of 1 and 10 μm, respectively, for 30 min at 37 °C, rotating at 750 rpm in a thermo-mixer. Mouse serum (1%, final v/v) prepared in-house and LPS (1 μg/ml) were then added to individual tubes, and at 0, 15 min and 3 h, the trachea explants were briefly spun down, and the neat supernatant was retained for GM-CSF ELISA. Tracheas were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and protein extracts were prepared as detailed previously using 200 μl of lysis buffer. As all data were normally distributed, responses were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test. Unless otherwise specified, data were reported as mean ± S.E. Group sizes in all experiments were at least 8 based on power calculations made to detect a 15% difference from control forp < 0.05, the level of statistical significance. Note that all experiments were replicated at least three times with identical statistical outcomes. Consistent with previous studies (20Blyth D.I. Pedrick M.S. Savage T.J. Bright H. Beesley J.E. Sanjar S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 38-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), 10 μg of LPS/mouse caused marked neutrophilic inflammation but not lung hemorrhage or acute respiratory distress. Administration of anti-GM-CSF 3 h prior to LPS challenge markedly suppressed LPS-induced neutrophilia (>85%), whereas an equivalent dose of isotype control exerted no significant effect on neutrophil recruitment into the lavage of BALB/c mice (Fig.1 A). The degree of inhibition was equivalent to the suppression of neutrophilia observed in confirmatory experiments in GM-CSF−/− mice (Fig.1 B). Anti-GM-CSF recovered by BAL after instillation completely neutralized recombinant GM-CSF (rGM-CSF) but not rTNFα (Fig. 2 A). Anti-GM-CSF also blocked detection of secreted GM-CSF but not TNFα protein in LPS-challenged mice, which were markedly enhanced in saline- and LPS-treated mice (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Anti-GM-CSF neutralizes recombinant and endogenous GM-CSF present in BALF and inhibits expression of GM-CSF and TNF α transcript. As shown in A, ELISA was used to measure recombinant GM-CSF and TNFα prepared in the BALF of PBS (▪) or anti-GM-CSF-treated and LPS-exposed animals (▴) over the specified concentration range. B, endogenous secreted GM-CSF and TNFα secreted in BALF of PBS (clear bars) or LPS (black bars, 10 μg for 2 h)-challenged mice pretreated with and without 100 μg of anti-GM-CSF/mouse. #, p < 0.05; ANOVA/Dunnett's test, significantly different from saline and LPS group (n = 4). As shown in C, total RNA was isolated from PBS (clear bar) and LPS-challenged lungs (black bars, 10 μg for 2 h) pretreated in the absence or presence of anti-GM-CSF. RNA was reverse-transcribed using random hexamers and subjected to Taqman PCR to detect GM-CSF and TNFα transcript relative to 18 S rRNA by multiplexing single reactions. The data were then compared with levels in the PBS control group and are presented as fold increase over PBS alone. #, p < 0.05; ANOVA/Dunnett's test, significantly different from saline and LPS group (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To establish whether anti-GM-CSF exerted its inhibitory effect at the transcript level, real time fluorescence (Taqman) PCR was used to assess GM-CSF and TNFα transcript expression normalized to 18 S rRNA. Consistent with in vitro models (21Meja K.K. Seldon P.M. Nasuhara Y. Ito K. Barnes P.J. Lindsay M.A. Giembycz M.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 1143-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), LPS promoted expression of GM-CSF and TNFα mRNA in vivo (Fig.2 C). Neutralizing GM-CSF significantly inhibited expression of both GM-CSF and TNFα mRNA by ∼26 and 44% respectively, suggesting that GM-CSF may play a role in priming or promoting activation of the inflammatory transcriptional machinery responsible for coordinating gene expression. The discrepancy between TNFα protein and transcript implies that preformed TNFα stores may be secreted in an anti-GM-CSF-resistant manner and are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that protein synthesis inhibition dampens but does not completely abolish LPS-induced TNFα release in the lung in vivo (22Goncalves de Moraes V.L. Boris Vargaftig B. Lefort J. Meager A. Chignard M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1792-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Since MMPs contribute to the movement of neutrophils into the lung parenchyma and MMP9 expression in response to LPS is transcriptionally regulated by NFκB and AP-1 (23Kim H. Koh G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24Aljada A. Ghanim H. Mohanty P. Hofmeyer D. Tripathy D. Dandona P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 5988-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we investigated the secretion of MMP9 in the BALF of LPS-challenged mice by gelatin zymography (Fig.3 A). LPS potently stimulated protease release in the BALF as assessed by clear regions corresponding to zones of degradation. Major bands of protease activity were identified at ∼90 kDa, corresponding to the molecular size of latent MMP9 (92 kDa) and a major band activity band corresponding to the active form of MMP9 (86 kDa). Additionally, higher molecular size protease bands were observed, corresponding to previously described dimers or complexes of MMP9 (25Zheng T. Zhu Z. Wang Z. Homer R.J., Ma, B. Riese Jr., R.J. Chapman Jr., H.A. Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). We did not observe bands corresponding to MMP2 (72 kDa) or matrilysin (MMP7, 28 kDa). Anti-GM-CSF reduced the expression of MMP9 by about 50%. Net protease activity in neat lavagates was also assessed using gelatin conjugated to a fluorescence probe. Consistent with the zymography, LPS-induced net gelatinase activity was partially suppressed by prior treatment with anti-GM-CSF (Fig. 3 B). As expression of GM-CSF, TNFα, and MMP9 are under the regulation of multiple transcription factors including NFκB and AP-1 (26Coles L.S. Diamond P. Occhiodoro F. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14482-14493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Jongeneel C.V. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we examined their DNA binding activity by electromobility shift assay using nuclear extracts from LPS-challenged lungs. Their respective activities were assessed in a kinetic study in the absence or presence of neutralizing anti-GM-CSF (Fig.4 A) and presented graphically following densitometry analysis (Fig. 4 B). LPS induced the DNA binding activity of nuclear NFκB and AP-1, and maximal activity was maintained between 1 and 6 h. Importantly, anti-GM-CSF reduced the activity of NFκB by 30–40% during the maximal activation period, consistent with the decline in TNFα transcript and MMP9 expression. The baseline activity of AP-1 was slightly elevated by anti-GM-CSF mAb, possibly due to anti-GM-CSF antibody binding to Fc receptors on lung mast cells or macrophages (28Turner H. Cantrell D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Fc receptor signaling is known to feed into the Ras pathway for AP-1 activation (28Turner H. Cantrell D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but in the absence of concurrent basal NFκB activation (Fig. 1), this AP-1 response alone is clearly not sufficient to cause neutrophilic inflammation in vivo. This LPS-induced activation of AP-1 was suppressed by anti-GM-CSF, as maximal activation between 1 and 6 h was reduced by 50%. 1L-1β receptor activates NFκB by promoting the dissociation of IκB from NFκB, which is followed by the Akt-mediated trans-activation of p65/RelA for complete activation (7Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4344) Google Scholar). Similarly, TLR4 promotes IκB ubiqitination; however, the role of Akt in LPS-induced lung inflammation remains unclear. Furthermore, the activation of two MAPK homologs, Erk1/2 and p38, is known to be important in AP-1 regulation (18Leppa S. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar); however MAPK substrate specificities in our mouse model have not been established. Therefore, we examined Akt, Erk1/2, and p38 activity in whole lung extracts derived from LPS-challenged mice by Western analysis using phospho-specific antibodies that only recognize activated forms of their respective kinases. Kinase activity was assessed in a kinetic study over 24 h, and actin was also immunoblotted as an internal loading control (Fig.5 A). Densitometry analysis was performed, and activities were presented as a fold increase above baseline (Fig. 5 B). LPS rapidly induced activation of Akt and Erk1/2 within 15 min, suggesting that Akt and Erk are functional modules of the TLR4 signaling cas"

Using bisulfite genomic sequencing, we found that 32 CpGs, distributed within a 317-bp sequence of the proximal leptin promoter, were highly methylated in human preadipocytes (73.4% ± 9.0%). During maturation toward terminally differentiated adipocytes, this promoter region was extremely demethylated (9.4% ± 4.4%).

Whereas the methylated CpG within the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α recognition site down-regulated reporter expression, methylated CpGs proximal to the TATA motif and/or in a further upstream region abrogated promoter activity completely. These distinct promoter CpG sequences were found unmethylated in leptin-expressing mature adipocytes. As evidenced by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, nuclear protein complexes were specifically formed on methylated oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the dedicated promoter sequences, indicating that methyl-CpG binding proteins participate in transcriptional repression and regulation of the human leptin gene.

Terminal differentiation of precursor cells involves the coordinate expression of a subset of cell type-specific genes that gives rise to a new morphological and functional phenotype. Fibroblast-like cells derived from adipose tissue, which have undergone commitment to the adipose lineage, can be induced to differentiate into adipocyte phenotype by treatment with insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, glucocorticoid, and triiodothyronine (1Schmidt W. Poll-Jordan G. Loffler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15489-15495Google Scholar). Upon exposure to differentiation inducers, preadipocytes undergo several rounds of cell division (clonal expansion), become growth-arrested, and coordinately express adipocyte-specific genes (2Cornelius P.

In a previous study, we have shown that in LiSa-2 cells, a human liposarcoma cell line, the adipocyte-specific genesGLUT4, aP2, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and SCD1 were inducibly expressed as the response to hormonal agents of adipocyte differentiation in the absence of leptin gene expression (27Wabitsch M. Bruederlein S. Melzner I. Braun M. Mechtersheimer G. Moeller P. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 889-894Google Scholar). However, treatment of these cells with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-deoxycytidine led to leptin gene expression. This observation argues for a role of DNA demethylation in leptin gene expression during the process of adipocyte differentiation. The promoter regions of many eukaryotic genes contain stretches of CpG-rich sequences known as CpG islands. These are considered to be usually unmethylated in transcriptionally active genes (28Naveh-Many T. Cedar H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4246-4250Google Scholar). By contrast, the inactivation of the X-chromosome and genomic imprinting are established consequences of DNA methylation (29Bartolomei M.S. Tilghman S.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 493-525Google Scholar, 30Razin A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4905-4908Google Scholar, 31Riggs A.D. Pfeifer G.P. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 169-174Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that the extent of methylation of CpG islands in tissue-specific genes directly influenced their transcriptional activity (32Cedar H. Cell. 1988; 53: 3-4Google Scholar, 33Kitazawa S. Kitazawa R. Maeda S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28787-28793Google Scholar, 34Lu S. Davies P.J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4692-4697Google Scholar). As the first evidence of a developmentally regulated DNA demethylation in human adipocyte differentiation, we show that a highly methylated CpG island within the proximal promoter sequence of the silent leptin gene of human preadipocytes is unmethylated in terminally differentiated adipocytes expressing the leptin gene. We further show that distinct methylated CpG motifs in this proximal promoter sequence act as specific sites for methyl-CpG binding proteins that are involved in leptin gene repression. Preadipocytes were prepared from human adipose tissue samples by collagenase digestion and cultured according to an established protocol (35Hauner H. Entenmann G. Wabitsch M. Gaillard D. Ailhaud G.

Preconfluent cells were repeatedly subcultured in DMEM/Ham's F-12 (1:1) medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics.

Moeller P. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 889-894Google Scholar). For adipose differentiation, cells were subcultured in serum-free DMEM/Ham's F-12 (1:1) medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml transferrin, 15 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm HEPES, 33 μm biotin, 17 μmpantothenate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and further referred to as basal medium. Additionally, Lisa-2 cells were preincubated for 48 h in basal medium complemented with 0.5 μm 5-aza-dC. To induce adipose differentiation, basal medium of subconfluent cultures was supplemented with 1 nminsulin, 20 pm triiodothyronine, and 1 μmcortisol and further referred to as adipogenic medium. Media were changed twice a week. Cells were considered as differentiated adipocytes once their cytoplasm was loaded with lipid droplets. The oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table I. PCR primers were selected from the published human leptin gene promoter sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers U43589 and D62708) to amplify promoter fragments of different lengths. A sequence of 15 bases including the BglII restriction side (underlined) was attached to the 5′-end of the reverse primer, and 15 bases including the SacI restriction side were attached to the 5′-end of the forward primers to achieve suitable PCR products for subcloning into the promoterless pGL3basic vector. Primer pairs +52-bsm and −258-bsm and 5′- deleted bsm primer pairs (deleted sequence is indicated as italic type) for nested PCR were designed to amplify a fragment of the sense strand ofbisulfite-modified human leptin promoter DNA. PCR primer pairs for cDNA analysis were selected from the corresponding GenBankTM cDNA sequences using the GCG prime program package (Wisconsin Version 10.2, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, WI). Oligonucleotides for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were chosen from the human leptin gene promoter sequence. AGG sequences (underlined) were attached to the 5′-end for 32P labeling. The positions of 5-methyl-cytosine instead of cytosine are indicated as *C. PCR primers were custom-synthesized (MWG-Biotech). The defined methylated oligonucleotides were synthesized by ThermoHybaid.Table ISequences of oligonucleotides used in this studyOligonucleotide5′-sequence-3′template+59rTAATAGATCTACTAGAAGGAGGAAGGAGCGCGCDNA−258fTAGTGAGCTCTAATAGGATTTCTCGCTCCTACCDNA−199fTAGTGAGCTCTAATAGTGGCTCCTGGCGCDNA−174fTAGTGAGCTCTAATACCCTCGAGGCCCCGDNA−149fTAGTGAGCTCTAATACTGCGGGCCCAGGGCTAGDNA−106fTAGTGAGCTCTAATAGAGGGGCGGGGCGGGDNA−60fTAGTGAGCTCTAATAGGGCAGTTGCGCAAGTTGTGDNA−35fTAGTGAGCTCTAATAGCCGCTATAAGAGGGGCGGDNA−24fTAGTGAGCTCTAATAAGGGGCGGGCAGGCDNA+52r-bsm, +47r-bsmAAAAAAACRCRCCRTAACCTTACCTTACbsm-DNA−258f-bsm,−253f-bsmGGATTTTTYGTTTTTATTAGTTATTTTTAAbsm-DNALeptin-fGCCCTATCTTTTCTATGTCCcDNALeptin-rTCTGTGGAGTAGCCTGAAGcDNAC/EBPα-fTTCCCTTACCAGCCGCCGcDNAC/EBPα-rCATTGTCACTGGTCAGCTCCcDNAAp2-fATTCCGATCCCAATGAGCAAGcDNAAp2-rCGTGGGAGATGAGGTTGAAGcDNASp1-fACTACCAGTGGATCATCAGGGcDNASp1-rCTGACAATGGTGCTGCTTGGAcDNAβ-Actin-fTCTCTTCCAACCTTCCTTCCcDNAβ-Actin-rCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGCcDNATATAfAGGTGTGAT*CGGGC*CGCTATAAGAGGGGCNuclear extractTATArAGGGCCCCTCTTATAG*CGGCC*CGATCACANuclear extractC/EBPfAGGTGCGGGGCAGTTG*CGCAAGTTGTGATNuclear extractC/EBPrAGGATCACAACTTG*CGCAACTGCCCCGCANuclear extractMBD-200fAGGGTGCGCG*CGTGGCTCCTGG*CG*CGCCGAGGCNuclear extractMBD-200rAGGGCCTCGG*CGCGCCAGGAGCCA*CG*CGCGCACNuclear extractFor details, see “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab For details, see “Experimental Procedures.” Cells growing in the log phase were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in digestion buffer, consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K at 50 °C for 12 h. Following the phenol/chloroform extraction procedure, DNA was treated with DNase-free RNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), repeatedly phenol/chloroform-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated. PCR conditions were as follows: a mixture consisting of 100 ng of DNA, forward and reverse primers, 25 pmol each, 10 pmol of dNTPs, 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer, 25 pmol of MgCl2, and 2.5 unitsTaq polymerase (Qiagen) at a total of 50 μl was hot started at 95 °C and run for 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 95, 56, and 72 °C for 1 min at each temperature and a final elongation step for 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were resolved in a 1% low melting agarose gel with ethidium bromide staining and sized by comparison with a 100-bp DNA ladder. Expected bands were excised and eluted with the Wizard PCR Preps DNA Purification System (Promega). Cellular DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite using the CpGenome DNA Modification Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCRs were performed on modified DNA using the primers +52r-bsm and −258f-bsm. Nested PCRs were performed on 10 μl of the first PCR amplification product with the primers +47r-bsm and −253f-bsm. PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and inserted for sequencing into a pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). Plasmids were isolated with the Qiagen plasmid kit and custom sequenced using standard sequencing primers (MWG Biotech). Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) and treated with 1 μg/μl RNase-free DNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 5 μg of RNA were reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). PCRs were performed as described upon 1 μl of reverse transcription reaction using primer pairs listed in TableI. DNA fragments of the human leptin promoter corresponding to the region from +59 to −258 and a set of 5′- truncated promoter fragments were made via PCR using the primers listed in Table I. The agarose-gel-purified PCR products were cleaved with a mixture of 20 units each of SacI andBglII restriction enzymes in 50 μl of restriction buffer A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 6 h at 37 °C. The digests were purified by low melting agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated into the SacI/BglII site of the promoterless luciferase-reporter vector pGL3Basic (Promega). The inserted promoter fragments were reamplified by PCR using plasmid-specific PCR primers, and the sequence was confirmed on the specific patterns of different restriction enzyme digests (data not shown). Leptin promoter-pGL3Basic constructs were referred to as, for example, P-258 (i.e. the insert is the PCR product amplified with primer pair −258f and +59r). An expressing plasmid for C/EBPα was made by inserting the coding sequence of the human C/EBPα gene into the cloning site of the pcDNA3.1/V5-Topo vector (Invitrogen). 20 μg of plasmid DNA were incubated for 24 h without (mock methylated) and with 20 units ofSssI- or HhaI-methylase (New England Biolabs) in 400 μl of methylase buffer supplemented with 160 μm S-adenosylmethionine. After 4 h of incubation, 2 μl of S-adenosylmethionine solution (32 mm) were repeatedly added. The reaction was terminated by heating (60 °C, 10 min), and methylated plasmids were purified by the Wizard DNA Clean-Up System (Promega). The efficiency of CpG methylation of the inserted promoter constructs was tested as follows. 2 μg of plasmid DNA were digested with SacI/BglII. The inserts were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and completeness of methylation was proven by the inhibition of the digest with 5-methyl-cytosine-sensitive restriction enzymes (data not shown). 24 h prior to transfection, 5 × 104 LiSa-2 cells in 0.5 ml of basal medium were seeded into 24-well tissue culture plates. For each well, 0.5 μg of promoter-pGL3basic construct, 0.5 μg of C/EBPα expression vector, and 25 ng of pRL-CMV vector were diluted in 25 μl of serum-free DMEM medium and precomplexed with 2 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) in a total of 50 μl of DMEM and incubated for 30 min at 20 °C. The culture medium was replaced by 200 μl of serum-free DMEM, and the plasmid-LipofectAMINE complexes were added to the cells. Following 5 h of incubation at 37 °C, 400 μl of medium containing 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum were added. 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in passive lysis buffer (100 μl/well). Luciferase activity was determined using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) in the Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold). Quadruple independent experiments were made for the transfections. Luciferase activity was measured in doublets. The relative promoter activity is expressed as the ratio of light units of leptin promoter-driven fire fly luciferase gene and cytomegalovirus promoter-driven Renilla luciferase gene of the co-transfected pRL-CMV vector. Nuclear protein extract from rat liver (Geneka Biotechnology Inc.) or nuclear protein extract prepared according to the Dignam protocol from nondifferentiated Lisa-2 cells was used in the protein binding reactions (36Dignam J.D. Methods Ezymol. 1990; 182: 194-203Google Scholar). Complementary oligonucleotide probes (Table I) were annealed and end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow enzyme. The specific activity of the probes used in the assays was adjusted to 50,000 cpm/0.1 pmol DNA. TATA probes were incubated at 20 °C for 30 min with 1 μg of rat liver nuclear protein extract in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.2 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), and 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, in a total volume of 20 μl. For protein binding reactions on C/EBP probes, the binding buffer contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4% Ficoll, 0.2 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), and 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin. Protein binding reactions on MeCP-200 probes were performed essentially as previously described (15Park E.A. Roesler W.J. Liu J. Klemm D.J. Gurney A.L. Thatcher J.D. Shuman J. Friedman A.D. Hanson R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6264-6272Google Scholar), using nuclear extract from LiSa-2 cells. The methylated or unmethylated competitors were added in a 10- or 100-fold molar excess. Samples were loaded on 4.5% polyacrylamide gels and run at 10 V/cm for 2 h in 0.5× TBE buffer. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Densitometric analysis of the DNA-protein complexes was performed on the captured images using the ImageMaster VDS software (Amersham Biosciences). In this study, we used a 317-base pair DNA fragment, ranging from nt +59 to −258 of the human leptin promoter, to correlate the transcriptional activity of the leptin gene with the level of CpG methylation. 32 CpG dinucleotides are distributed within this sequence, particularly located in the GC-box at −19, −95, and −100; proximal to the TATA-box at −33 and −38; within the C/EBPα binding site at −51; and within six CpG motifs at positions −183, −186, −188, −200, −202, and −204. Fig. 1shows the result of a CpG plot calculation. This program defines a CpG island as a region where, over an average of 10 windows, the calculated percentage of CG composition is over 50%, and the calculated observed CpG distribution versus the expected is over 0.6 (37Rice P. Longden I. Bleasby A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 276-277Google Scholar). The program recognizes in the leptin promoter fragment a CpG island, sized from nt +3 to −211 with a CG composition of 73.8%, the average observed-to-expected ratio of CpGs being 0.87. Among other adipose tissue-specific proteins, leptin can be considered as a marker protein expressed in terminal differentiated adipocytes. To evaluate leptin mRNA expression and the presence of transcription factor mRNAs involved in the regulation of leptin promoter activity, reverse transcription-PCR experiments on preadipocyte and adipocyte RNA were carried out. The results are shown in Fig. 2. In preadipocytes, leptin mRNA was undetectable, C/EBPα message was found in traces, whereas AP-2α and Sp1 transcripts were found abundantly (gel image A). On culturing these cells for 20 days in adipogenic medium, the morphology changed to spheroid adipocytes loaded with lipid droplets, in which C/EBPα and leptin mRNAs were clearly detectable (gel image B). In a recent study, we postulated an association between DNA demethylation and leptin expression during hormone-induced adipocyte differentiation of LiSa-2 cells (27Wabitsch M. Bruederlein S. Melzner I. Braun M. Mechtersheimer G. Moeller P. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 889-894Google Scholar). Induction of leptin mRNA in LiSa-2 cells was only observed after preculturing the cells in basal medium supplemented with 5-aza-desoxycytosine (5-aza-dC). To confirm these findings, we determined the methylation pattern of the leptin promoter region of cultured human preadipocytes, in vitro-differentiated adipocytes, and differentiated LiSa-2 cells with and without 5-aza-dC treatment. Cellular DNA was treated with bisulfite, and the C to U converted leptin promoter sequence was PCR-amplified and sequenced. The promoter region investigated ranges from nt +47 to −253 and includes 32 CpG dinucleotides. As shown in Fig. 3, following adipose differentiation, the level of CpG methylation in the leptin promoter DNA decreased greatly from 73.4 ± 9.0% in leptin-nonexpressing preadipocytes to 9.4 ± 4.4% in leptin-expressing adipocytes. In LiSa-2 cells, the effect on demethylation caused by 5-aza-dC resembled that observed during preadipocyte differentiation. Upon 5-aza-dC treatment, promoter methylation declined in differentiated LiSa-2 cells from 48.1 ± 12.5 to 11.5 ± 11.0%. Two informative examples of sequencing chromatograms are shown in Fig.4. Fig. 4 (left) represents the human leptin promoter region from nt −14 to −59, including the core promoter and the upstream C/EBPα site. To demonstrate the correctness of sequencing, the published sequence of the leptin gene is superimposed (Fig. 4 (left), line A) on the corresponding DNA sequence of preadipocytes (Fig. 4(left), line B). In Fig. 4(left) line C, the sequencing chromatogram of bisulfite-modified preadipocyte DNA illustrates the CpG methylation status of this particular promoter region. The cytosines in the CpG dinucleotides at positions −19, −33, −38, and −51 remained and were therefore methylated in the original preadipocyte DNA. By contrast, in the modified DNA of differentiated adipocytes (Fig. 4(left), line D), all cytosines were converted to uracils (appearing after PCR as thymidines), indicating that the original promoter sequence was unmethylated. Fig. 4(right) represents the leptin promoter region from nt −175 to −215, including two CpG triplets at nt −183 to −188 and at nt −200 to −204, all of which were originally methylated in preadipocyte-derived DNA as documented in Fig. 4 (right),line C. After terminal differentiation, these CpG motifs were unmethylated as evidenced in the sequencing chromatogram (Fig. 4 (right), line D). To evaluate the effect of CpG methylation on the activity of the human leptin promoter to drive the expression of the luciferase reporter gene, a set of 5′-truncated promoter fragments, ranging from nt +59 up to −258 of the leptin gene, were inserted upstream of the luciferase gene into pGL3Basic vectors. In addition to the mock-methylated plasmid constructs, total CpG-methylated constructs were made by the action of SssI methylase. GCGC sequences in the fragments at positions +44, +42, +11, −51, −74, −85, −186, −188, −202, and −204 were methylated with HhaI methylase. Subsequently, plasmid constructs were transiently transfected into LiSa-2 cells. Fig. 5 shows leptin promoter activity in transfection experiments using construct P-258. Reporter expression increased 2-fold in cells cultured after transfection in adipogenic medium compared with those cultured in basal medium. Co-transfection with a C/EBPα-expressing vector markedly increased the reporter expression rate to about 30-fold, without an additional hormone effect. These results are in accordance with published data on co-transfection experiments to achieve leptin promoter expression in 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes (17Miller S.G. De Vos P. Guerre-Millo M. Wong K. Hermann T. Staels B. Briggs M.R. Auwerx J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5507-5511Google Scholar) and indicate that in LiSa-2 cells ectopic C/EBPα expression is needed for stimulation of leptin promoter activity too. Fig. 6 A shows the results of transient transfection experiments with the mock-methylated promoter-plasmid constructs or after methylation by HhaI- orSssI-methyltransferase. Construct P-106 containing the DNA binding sites for Sp1, C/EBPα, and the TATA-box, achieved the highest reporter activity of 103.9 relative light units. The additional AP-2 binding site in promoter fragment P-149 had no enhancing effect on promoter activity. In accordance with published data, the promoter fragment in construct P-106 can be considered as the minimal leptin promoter (17Miller S.G. De Vos P. Guerre-Millo M. Wong K. Hermann T. Staels B. Briggs M.R. Auwerx J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5507-5511Google Scholar). A decrease in promoter activity was observed using constructs, which were extended in their upstream sequences. The activity declined to about one-half of maximal activity when cells were transfected with P-174 and to about one-quarter using P-199. After lengthening the promoter fragment sequence up to nt −258, a 2-fold increase in reporter activity was observed compared with that of P-199, which approximated the levels of P-174 or P-60, respectively. Excluding the AP-2 and Sp1 binding sites by shortening the fragment sequence to nt −60, the promoter activity dropped to one-half of maximal activity. An additional, even more dramatic decrease in promoter activity was observed with construct P-35, which only consists of the TATA motif and downstream sequences. The decrease in promoter activity from 65.3 relative light units produced by P-60 compared with 15.9 produced by P-35 was a clear indication of the importance of the C/EBPα binding site for gene activation. The promoter activity of about 3 relative light units achieved by the TATA-less plasmid P-24, was just slightly above that produced by the promoterless pGL3Basic vector (<1.0 relative light units). SssI methylation of the CpGs in the leptin promoter constructs P-258 and P-199 dramatically decreased the promoter activity to values of the promoterless basic vector. This silencing effect ofSssI methylation was less extensively achieved by plasmids P-174 up to P-60. The promoter activity increased from 0.3 relative light units obtained by P-199 to 8.8 obtained by P-60. SssI methylation of the core promoter fragment P-35 decreased the basal expression from 15.9 relative light units to 0.8, stressing the importance of the methylated CpG at −33 and −38 proximal the TATA motif in transcriptional regulation. Except for promoter construct P-199, HhaI methylation of CpGs had a moderate effect on reporter gene expression. Using the construct P-258 and P-174 down to P-35, each methylated at the indicated CpGs of the leptin promoter region (Fig. 6 C), the reporter expression declined to about one-third compared with that obta"

H2O2 produced early activation of Akt/PKB and also DNA damage that was followed by stabilization of p53 levels, formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and generation of ceramide through activation of a glutathione-sensitive neutral sphingomyelinase. These events correlated with long term dephosphorylation and subsequent degradation of Akt. A membrane-targeted active Akt version attenuated apoptosis but not necrosis induced by H2O2 and was more resistant to dephosphorylation and proteolysis induced by apoptotic concentrations of H2O2. Proteolysis of Akt was prevented by exogenous addition of glutathione, indicating a role of ROS and ceramide in Akt degradation. However, Akt was degraded similarly in cells transfected with wild type and dominant negative p53 mutant, indicating that degradation of Akt under oxidative injury may be p53-independent. Specific inhibitors of caspase groups I and III prevented proteolysis of Akt/PKB and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in cells submitted to apoptotic but not necrotic H2O2 concentrations. Surprisingly, in caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells Akt was more sensitive to H2O2-induced degradation than the caspase-3 substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Moreover, the Akt/PKB double mutant Akt(D108A,D119A), which is not cleaved by caspase-3, and a triple mutant (D453A,D455A,D456A), which lacks the consensus sequence for caspase-3 cleavage, were also degraded in H2O2-treated cells. Our results suggest that strong oxidants generate intracellular ROS and ceramide which in term lead to down-regulation of Akt by dephosphorylation and caspase-3-independent proteolysis.

Mitochondrial and cytosolic superoxide dismutases convert superoxide into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a non-radical molecule that generates highly toxic hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction (1Fridovich I. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 893: 13-18Crossref Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Neurons of the central and peripheral nervous system are particularly sensitive to oxidative damage. Cell death derived from high ROS levels has been associated with a number of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (2Pettmann B. Henderson C.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 633-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) as well as the general decline of the central nervous system function frequently associated with senescence (3Serrano M. Blasco M.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 748-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In the nervous system, neurotrophins enhance tolerance to oxidative stress in both animal and cellular models (4Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 677-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3333) Google Scholar, 5Miller F.D. Kaplan D.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). A prominent mechanism involved in neurotrophin-induced cell survival includes activation of the PI3K and Akt/protein kinase B signaling pathway. The survival signal elicited by Akt proceeds through several mechanisms including inactivation of BAD and caspase-9, stimulation of nuclear factor-κB activity, inactivation of forkhead transcription factor, and phosphorylation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) kinases (for recent reviews, see Refs. 6Brazil D.P.

For instance, neuregulin prevents H2O2 induction of ROS in a PI3K-dependent manner (8Goldshmit Y. Erlich S. Pinkas-Kramarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46379-46385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and loss of oxidative stress tolerance with aging has been linked in part to reduced Akt kinase activity in old rats (9Ikeyama S. Kokkonen G. Shack S. Wang X.T. Holbrook N.J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Concerning neurodegeneration, we have reported previously the protective effect of active Akt1 against peptides of β-amyolid protein characteristic of senile plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients (10Martin D.

Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). When cells are exposed to oxidative injury they activate multiple signaling pathways that dictate whether those cells will ultimately tolerate or succumb to the insult. Akt/protein kinase B appears to be one such pathway that becomes activated by ROS-generating agents (10Martin D. Salinas M. Lopez-Valdaliso R. Serrano E. Recuero M. Cuadrado A. J.

Activation of Akt by ROS may reflect an attempt of the damaged cells to survive the oxidative insult. On the other hand, the best characterized signaling pathways that are activated by oxidative injury are those leading to cell death. Stress-triggered apoptosis induces cytochrome crelease from mitochondria and activation of caspase cascades that execute the apoptotic program (16Gross A. McDonell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J.

In addition, oxidative stress also produces genotoxic damage that results in stabilization of p53 levels and cell death (17Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4487) Google Scholar). The fact that oxidative stress activates contradictory signaling pathways of survival and death implies that there must be sophisticated cross-talk between these opposite signals that dictate cells fate. The regulation of the apoptosis machinery by Akt is being explored in detail and, as stated above, a number of Akt substrates have been identified as elements of the initiation and execution phases of apoptosis. In general, phosphorylation of these proteins leads to their inactivation. However, very little is known about the mechanism(s) employed by the apoptotic machinery to down-regulate the Akt survival signal. We and other groups and have reported the enhanced dephosphorylation of Akt at the critical residues Thr308and Ser473 by a ceramide-activated protein phosphatase/protein phosphatase 2A (18Salinas M. Lopez-Valdaliso R. Martin D. Alvarez A. Cuadrado A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 156-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 19Zhou H. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Pittman R.N. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5457-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The putative role of apoptotic proteases in degradation of Akt are more ill defined, but Akt appears to be a substrate of caspase-3 in vitro (21Rokudai S. Fujita N. Hashimoto Y. Tsuruo T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and caspase-3-dependent cleavage of Akt may be relevant in detachment-induced and Fas ligand-induced cell death (22Bachelder R.E. Wendt M.A. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34702-34707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Because cells submitted to prolonged oxidative stress ultimately die, despite the initial activation of Akt, the long term effects of these insults leading to down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway are particularly relevant and require further investigation. We have addressed this question in PC12 cells submitted to H2O2, a well reported activator of Akt which induces oxidative stress, senescence, and cell death. Our findings indicate that Akt is activated rapidly in response to H2O2, and apoptosis resumes at a time when Akt activity has been completely depleted by dephosphorylation and proteolysis. These results are relevant to an understanding of oxidative stress-induced cell death and for devising strategies that might promote cell survival in the nervous system under the presence of oxidative insults. PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum, 7.5% heat-inactivated horse serum, and 80 μg/ml gentamicin. Neuro 2A and MCF-7 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 80 μg/ml gentamicin. Transfections of PC12 and Neuro 2A cells were performed with the expression vectors pCEFL(X-)EGFP, pCEFL(X-)EGFP-Akt1, pCEFL(X-)myr-EGFP-Akt1 and pcDNA3HA-Akt1 (11Salinas M. Martin D. Alvarez A. Cuadrado A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), or with expression vectors pFLAG, pFLAGhAkt1, pFLAGhAkt1(D108A,D119A) and pFLAGhAkt1(D453A,D455A,D456A) (21Rokudai S. Fujita N. Hashimoto Y. Tsuruo T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), or with expression vectors pcDNA3-p53 and pcDNA3-p53(S15A) (gift of Dr. R. Sánchez-Prieto, Hospital Puerta de Hierro, Madrid; 24) using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). All reagents were purchased from Sigma except NGF, bacterial sn-1,2 diacylglycerol kinase (Calbiochem), C2-ceramide (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI), and ZVAD-fmk, Ac-YVAD-cmk, and Ac-DEVD-fmk (RBI, Natick, MA). MTT assays were performed as described previously (25Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3335) Google Scholar). For trypan blue staining, both detached and attached cells were resuspended in DMEM, mixed with an equal volume trypan blue stain (Biowhittaker, Walkersville, MD), and left at room temperature for 5 min. The percentage of stained cells was analyzed in a Neubauer chamber. In vitro Akt kinase assays were performed as described by Salinas et al. (18Salinas M. Lopez-Valdaliso R. Martin D. Alvarez A. Cuadrado A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 156-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS loading buffer, resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Ponceau-stained histone H2B bands were exposed to autoradiography, excised, and measured individually by Cerenkov counting. Immunoblots of the upper membrane portions were performed routinely using anti-Akt1C20 antibody to confirm equal amounts of kinase/reaction. Cells were processed as described by Salinaset al. (18Salinas M. Lopez-Valdaliso R. Martin D. Alvarez A. Cuadrado A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 156-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), resolved in SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. Blots were analyzed with the following antibodies: anti-Akt1 (1:500), anti-ERK2 (1:500), anti-p110 PI3K, anti-PARP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phospho-AktS473, anti-phospho-AktT308 (1:500) (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc, Beverly, MA), anti-PDI (gift of Dr. J. G. Castaño, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas, Madrid). Appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used to detect the proteins of interest by enhanced chemiluminescence. Densitometric analyses of representative immunoblots were performed with the NIH Image software. H2O2 concentration in stock solutions was standardized by determining the A 240 nm value (1 A 240 nm = 22.9 mmH2O2). In assays for H2O2 catabolism, 400,000 cells were incubated with 0.5 mm H2O2, and 100 μl of medium was collected at 20-min intervals. Medium from untreated cells was used to prepare a standard curve ranging from 1 mm to 16.75 μm. Samples and standards were diluted 1:10 with DMEM, and 50 μl of each was mixed with 150 μl of a modified ECL mix (0.55 mm p-coumaric acid, 2.5 mmluminol, and 1 μl/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Bio-Rad) as a source of peroxidase. Light emission was measured in a Optocomp I BG-1 luminometer (GEM Biomedical, Inc., Cambridge, UK). Assays were performed as described by Collinset al. (26Collins A.R. Dobson V.L. Dusinska M. Kennedy G. Stetina R. Mut. Res. 1997; 375: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. 400,000 cells were seeded in P60 dishes, serum starved for 16 h, treated for 30 min with different H2O2 concentrations, washed twice with PBS, detached with 1 ml of PBS, and pelleted at 500 ×g for 1 min at 4 °C. Then the cells were resuspended in 1% low melting point agarose (Biowhittaker) in PBS prewarmed to 37 °C. A 50-μl drop of cell suspension was laid on agarose-precoated slides. Quickly the drop was covered with a coverslip and left at 4 °C for 5 min. Then the coverslip was removed, and the cells were lysed by immersion of the slides in precooled, freshly prepared lysis buffer (2.5 m NaCl, 0.1 m EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100) for 1 h. After lysis, nuclei were submitted to alkaline pretreatment in electrophoresis buffer (0.3 m NaOH, 1 mm EDTA precooled at 4 °C) for 40 min and electrophoresed for 30 min at 25 V. The samples were neutralized by three washes of 5 min with 0.4m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Nuclei were stained by immersion in a solution containing 0.1 μg/ml DAPI in PBS for 5 min and gently washed three times with PBS. The coverslips were dried and mounted with FluorSave (Calbiochem). Analysis was performed in a Nikon Eclipse TE300 using a standard UV filter. The levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) were determined using the GSH-sensitive probe monochlorobimane (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) (27Rimpler M.M. Rauen U. Schmidt T. Moroy T. de Groot H. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 291-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 20,000 cells were seeded on 96-well plates and serum starved for 16 h. 200 μm BSO or H2O2 was added to the medium and incubated for the time indicated in Fig. 2. 100 μm monochlorobimane was added during the last 30 min. Plates were analyzed immediately using a Fluoroscan fluorometer (Labsystems Oy, Helsinki, Finland) (20-ms integration time, 390-nm excitation filter, and 485-nm emission filter). Basal autofluorescence was determined from cells that were not incubated with the probe and was subtracted to all samples. Fluorescence measured from untreated cells was considered as 100% GSH content. For mitochondrial membrane potential analysis cells were detached mechanically, washed once with DMEM at 37 °C, and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in DMEM containing 100 nm CM-H2XROS (Molecular Probes). Probe incorporation was measured using a 620/22 nm band pass filter (FL3-H). For annexin V-phycoerythrin (PE) and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) staining, cells were detached mechanically after treatments and washed twice with annexin-V binding buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2). Cells were resuspended in 100 μl of a 1:20 dilution of annexin V-PE (Bender MedSystems Diagnostics, Vienna, Austria) in annexin V binding buffer containing 2 μm 7-AAD and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Fluorescence was measured using band pass 620/22 nm and 575/24 nm filters. For analysis of ROS levels, 2 μm hydroethidine was added 1 h before analysis. Then cells were detached mechanically from the plate, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and analyzed immediately using a standard 575/24 nm band pass filter (FL2-H). All analyses were performed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The diacylglycerol kinase method was used (28Perry D.K. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 22-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 400,000 cells were serum starved for 16 h and treated with H2O2 or appropriate inhibitors for the times indicated in Fig. 3. Attached and detached cells were pelleted at 300 × g for 12 min. Cells were washed once with PBS, resuspended in 300 μl of PBS, and transferred to microfuge tubes. Lipids were extracted with 600 μl of chloroform, methanol, 1 n HCl (100:100:1). After agitation and centrifugation, the lower phase containing the chloroform-extracted lipids was transferred to a new microfuge tube. Chloroform was evaporated under a N2 stream. Dried lipids were resuspended in 300 μl of 0.1 n KOH in methanol and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to eliminate diacylglycerol. Then, 300 μl of PBS was added, and lipid extraction was repeated as indicated above. Lipids were resuspended in 100 μl of reaction buffer (150 μg/100 μl cardiolipin, 280 μm DTPA, 51 mm octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, 50 mm NaCl, 51 mm imidazol, 1 mm EDTA, 12.5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.7% glycerol, 70 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 500 μm ATP, 5 μCi/100 μl [γ-32P]ATP), and 35 ng of diacylglycerol kinase was added to each sample. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 170 μl of stop buffer (135 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) and 30 μl of 100 mm EDTA. Lipids were extracted again with 1 ml of chloroform, methanol, 1 n HCl (100:100:1), resuspended in 40 μl of chloroform, spotted onto silica gel TLC plates (Whatman Inc.), and resolved using chloroform:methanol:acetic acid (65:15:5) as solvent. Plates were measured in an Instant-Imager (Packard, Canberra, Australia). Quantification of ceramide mass was obtained by comparison with a standard curve ranging from 0 to 1,000 pmol of purified ceramide (Sigma), which was processed in parallel to the samples. Student's t test was used to assess differences in hydroethidine staining and accumulation of ceramide between control and H2O2-treated groups and between control and GSH-treated groups, respectively. Ap < 0.01 was considered significant. Unless indicated, all experiments were performed at least three times with similar results. The values in graphs correspond to the average of at least three samples. Bars indicate standard deviation. First we analyzed the effect of H2O2 on Akt kinase activity and the signaling mechanisms leading to Akt activation under our experimental conditions. Serum-starved PC12 cells were pretreated with vehicle, wortmannin, or LY294002 for 15 min and then incubated with H2O2 or NGF for 5 min. Akt activity was measured in in vitro immunocomplex kinase assays using histone H2B as substrate. As indicated in Fig.1 A, H2O2 and NGF stimulated Akt activity in PC12 cells, and the two structurally unrelated inhibitors of PI3 kinase, wortmannin and LY294002, dramatically prevented the activation of Akt by both inducers. Similar results were obtained when Akt activity was monitored as a function of phosphorylation at Ser473 or Thr308 with phospho-Akt-specific antibodies (data not shown). Therefore, our results indicate that H2O2 activates Akt in a PI3K-dependent manner. Then, Akt activation was monitored with phospho-Akt(T308)-specific antibodies in cells treated for 10 min and 3 h with H2O2 and NGF. As shown in Fig. 1 B, H2O2 induced a stronger activation of Akt than NGF after a 10-min stimulation. By contrast, after a 3-h stimulation, phospho-Akt was hardly detectable in H2O2-treated cells, whereas NGF-treated cells exhibited about half the phospho-Akt observed at 10 min. Similar results were obtained when active Akt was monitored with an antibody against phospho-Ser473 (data not shown). The different kinetics of Akt activation may be caused, at least in part, by a faster down-regulation of Akt activity in H2O2-treated cells (see below) or by a quick degradation of H2O2 by cell antioxidant enzymes that shut down this signal. Therefore, we determined the rate of H2O2 degradation under our experimental conditions. 400,000 serum-starved PC12 cells were incubated with 0.5 mm H2O2 for increasing time periods, and the H2O2 concentration remaining in the medium was measured by a chemiluminescent assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). An initial concentration of 0.5 mm H2O2 was reduced to less than 0.1 mm in 60 min (data not shown). We also tested the capacity of the H2O2 concentration still remaining in the medium to activate Akt. The conditioned medium from cells treated with 0.5 mm H2O2 was rapidly used to restimulate new serum-starved cells for 10 min. As a control we tested the effect on Akt activation of control, conditioned medium of parallel samples of H2O2 which was added to cell-free plates. As shown in Fig. 1 C, in cell-free medium 0.5 mm H2O2 was degraded in about 2 h because conditioned media from longer incubations were unable to stimulate phosphorylation/activation of Akt. By contrast, in the presence of PC12 cells, H2O2 exhibited a faster degradation kinetics, with lack of Akt stimulating activity in about 60 min. These results indicate that H2O2is metabolized quickly in the cell environment and establish a time frame to discriminate short term effects that are connected directly with the presence of H2O2 and long term effects that come into view at a time when H2O2 is no longer present. Despite the rapid elimination of most H2O2, cells underwent apoptosis and necrosis in the following 10–24 h (see below). Therefore we reasoned that in addition to activating Akt, H2O2 might also deliver a mark for long term induction of cell death, such as DNA damage. To test this hypothesis, serum-starved PC12 cells were submitted for 30 min to 0.5 and 1 mm H2O2. DNA integrity was analyzed by the comet assay as shown in Fig. 1, D and E. Besides activating Akt, these H2O2concentrations also produced strong genotoxic damage as evidenced by the long tails of electrophoresed chromatin. Moreover, pretreatment with LY294002 (Fig. 1, D andE) or with wortmannin (data not shown) did not significantly prevent nor enhance the DNA damage, suggesting that the PI3K/Akt pathway does not shield the cells from the initial genotoxic mark produced by H2O2. To test whether H2O2 could alter the cell redox status, we analyzed the intracellular level of GSH by the use of monochlorobimane (27Rimpler M.M. Rauen U. Schmidt T. Moroy T. de Groot H. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 291-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of fluorescent GSH-monochlorobimane adduct that is generated by the enzymatic action of intracellular glutathioneS-transferase was measured fluorometrically. Unspecific basal incorporation of the probe was determined in cells treated for 24 h with BSO, an irreversible inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione biosynthesis (29Anderson M.E. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 111–112: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Serum-starved PC12 cells were submitted to 0.5 mmH2O2 for the time periods indicated in Fig.2 A and incubated for the last 30 min with monochlorobimane. Within the first 3-h incubation, H2O2 depleted GSH to levels similar to those with a 24-h treatment with BSO. Because GSH is the major non-protein-reducing agent within the cell, these results indicate that H2O2 substantially reduces the cell capacity to maintain redox homeostasis. Most GSH depletion took place at a time point when H2O2 was no longer present, at least at a sufficient amount to elicit Akt activation (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that other secondary sources of oxidative stress might be responsible for the GSH loss. Therefore, we estimated mitochondria-generated oxygen free radicals. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) was estimated by flow cytometry in cells stained with CM-H2XROS, a reduced rosamine that is concentrated by the active mitochondria and upon oxidation fluoresces red (30Poot M. Pierce R.C. Cytometry. 1999; 36: 359-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, when serum-starved PC12 cells were submitted to 0.5 mm H2O2, an increasing fraction of the cell population was refractory to CM-H2XROS staining, indicating a gradual decay of ΔΨm. Interestingly, the increase in cells that were not stained by the probe inversely correlated with the progressive drop of GSH levels. We also analyzed the intracellular levels of ROS by flow cytometry of cells stained with hydroethidine, a fluorescent probe most sensitive for superoxide ion (31Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Lee C.C. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C, when cells were submitted to 0.5 mm H2O2 for 3 h, they exhibited an almost 2-fold increase in intracellular ROS. Taken together these results suggest that after H2O2induction of DNA damage, a secondary source of ROS production, including superoxide, is generated at least in part at the mitochondria. Because ceramide is a lipid second messenger of apoptosis in neural cells, we determined ceramide levels after H2O2 treatment of serum-starved PC12 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 A, a small increase in ceramide was detected during the first 30-min incubation with H2O2. Although this increase was not statistically significant in our assays, other groups have reported a similar increase in cells treated with other insults (32Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar, 33Spiegel S. Merrill Jr., A.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 34Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 73-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ceramide levels increased much more significantly up to 4–6-fold over that of untreated cells after a 3-h incubation. We analyzed the accumulation of ceramide in the presence of fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthase. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the H2O2-induced accumulation of this lipid was similar to that in the absence of fumonisin B1, indicating thatde novo synthesis did not contribute significantly to the observed elevation of ceramide levels. The increase in ceramide ran parallel to the decrease of GSH levels (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that the accumulated ceramide might come from the activation of a ROS-sensitive neutral sphingomyelinase as reported previously (35Liu B.

https://openalex.org/W2089178918,"Zinc is a structural component of many regulatory molecules including transcription factors and signaling molecules. We report that two alternate signaling pathways of protein kinase C (PKC) activation involving either the lipid second messengers (diacylglycerol and its mimetics, the phorbol esters) or reactive oxygen converge at the zinc finger of the regulatory domain. They all trigger the release of zinc ions. An increase in intracellular free Zn2+ was observed by confocal microscopy in intact cells treated with phorbol ester or by mild oxidation. The source of liberated Zn2+ was traced to PKC and particularly the zinc finger domains. The activated form of native PKCα contained significantly less Zn2+ than the resting form. Furthermore, purified recombinant PKC protein fragments shed stoichiometric amounts of Zn2+ upon reaction with diacylglycerol, phorbol ester, or reactive oxygen in vitro. Our results offer new insight into the regulation of PKC. Far from cementing rigid structures, zinc actually is the linchpin that orchestrates dynamic changes in response to specific signals, allowing kinase activity to be turned on or off.

Far from cementing rigid structures, zinc actually is the linchpin that orchestrates dynamic changes in response to specific signals, allowing kinase activity to be turned on or off. Zinc is essential to the structure of numerous signaling proteins. Transcription factors and signaling molecules share zinc finger structures as a common motif, although they differ in composition and function (1Ahmed S. Kozma R. Lee J. Monfries C. Harden N. Lim L. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The C2H2 zinc finger is believed to provide rigidity to transcription factors for proper DNA binding capacity. By comparison, the structure/function relationship of the components in the C3H1 zinc fingers of signaling molecules is not fully understood. We report here that Zn2+ ions of the cysteine-rich domain play a dynamic role in the function of protein kinase C.

Independent of this classic pathway, PKC is also controlled by a redox mechanism where oxidation converts the protein to the catalytically competent form (6Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl.

Calcium and phosphatidylserine are important for amplification of the diacylglycerol signal, whereas vitamin A, as we have shown recently, is needed for efficient redox activation of several PKC isoforms (9Imam A.

These 50 amino acid-long highly homologous stretches contain 6 conserved cysteine and 2 conserved histidine residues, tetrahedrically coordinated by two Zn2+ ions into a composite zinc finger (1Ahmed S. Kozma R. Lee J. Monfries C. Harden N. Lim L. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P., M. Nishizuka Y.

A. 1996; 93: 8312-8317Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We show that the diacylglycerol phorbol ester pathway and the alternate redox pathway converge at this zinc finger structure. The common event is the release of the chelated zinc ions. NIH 3T3 cells were grown to semi-confluence in minimum essential high glucose medium supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum. Trichoplusia ni insect cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in TNM-FH insect medium with 7% fetal bovine serum. At semi-confluence, the cells were infected with baculovirus constructs that harbored the full-length human PKCα or ζ-genes or empty vector. Cells were loaded with 1 μm N-(6-methoxy)-8-quinolyl-toluene sulfonamide (TSQ) (Molecular Probes) for 20 min, washed intensively with PBS, and moved to the stage of confocal laser scanning microscope LSM 510. Images were acquired with a Zeiss/LSM510 system equipped with the Enterprise UV laser. The 351-nm line was used for the excitation of TSQ, and fluorescence below 545 nm was captured. The focal plane was set close to the nuclear center. Fluorescence intensity was recorded on-line for several minutes to obtain background fluorescence, and after the addition of activator, the acquisition of images at 30-s intervals was continued for 30 min or longer until saturation was reached. Morphometric analysis was performed using the MetaMorph image analysis software. The confocal projection images present one section at 1.6-μm optical resolution in the Z direction at 630-fold optical magnification. Because laser irradiation may stimulate various changes in redox-sensitive systems, control-bleaching experiments were performed. Exposing the loaded cells three times for 45 s at the maximal laser power did not change TSQ fluorescence (35.9 ± 6.8 and 31.3 ± 7.5 units in the control and postbleached cells, respectively). To ascertain the specificity of TSQ for Zn2+, the specific zinc chelatorN,N,N′,N′-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) was used in competition experiments. TSQ was added to 2–10-μm protein solutions in phosphate-buffered saline to a final concentration of 10 μm. Protein solutions were excited at 334 nm, and fluorescence emission was recorded at 465 nm in a Jasco FP-777 spectrofluorometer. A standard zinc solution (Sigma) was used to calibrate the assay system. For zinc determination by 4-(2-pyridylazo-resorcinol) (PAR), 40 μm of solution of recombinant GST fusion protein in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, was mixed with 100 μm PAR and oxidized with indicated peroxide concentrations for 6 min at 37 °C or treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Optical density was read at 500 nm. Maximum zinc release was achieved by the addition of 500 μm p-hydroxy-mercuri-phenylsulfonate (PMPS). Suspensions of thymus or spleen cells of 4–6-week-old C57Bl/6 mice were activated by incubation with 166 μm PMA or 100 μmhydrogen peroxide for 15 min at 37 °C. Resting or activated cells were lysed at 0 °C in a standard lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% Triton X-100). PKCα was precipitated with PKCα-specific monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories), and the immunoprecipitates were collected on protein G-agarose beads of standard size or of average size of 34 μm in diameter for FACS analysis (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed once with lysis buffer and three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Samples were divided into two equal portions, which were analyzed for 1) PKC amount by Western blot and phosphotransfer activity as described previously (9Imam A. Hoyos B. Swenson C. Levi E. Chua R. Viriya E. Hammerling U. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 28-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and for 2) zinc content by a modified TSQ assay (vide infra). In the TSQ assay, the beads coated with PKC immunoprecipitates of activated cells were analyzed for residual zinc content in comparison with those of resting control cells. Beads were stained with 10 μm TSQ solution for 5 min in the cold and then inspected by confocal fluorescence microscopy as described above. After acquiring background fluorescence, the thiol-reactive reagent PMPS was added and the proportional increase in fluorescence emission caused by the displaced Zn2+ was recorded. The zinc content of non-activated cells was taken as reference point, and that of activated PKC samples was computed as a fraction thereof. Additionally, the 34-μm TSQ-stained beads were analyzed by the fluorescence-activated cell sorter. After determining background fluorescence emission, the beads were treated with PMPS and the proportional increase in fluorescence was measured by FACS. The reported values represent the fractions of zinc retained in the activated form compared with non-activated PKCα. Because no method exists to quantitatively separate activated PKC species from inactive forms, no attempts were made to determine molar ratios. The control- and PMA-treated insect cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 2% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. Formaldehyde excess was neutralized with 0.1 m glycine in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (w/v) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 10 min at room temperature. After the washing and blocking of nonspecific binding sites by 1% bovine serum albumin, the cells were stained for 1 h at room temperature with anti-PKCα antibody (Transduction Laboratories) followed by fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. The immunostained cells were observed in a confocal laser scanning microscope as described above with the modification that the 488-nm line was used for the excitation of fluorescein. Intact NIH 3T3 fibroblasts treated with PMA (Fig.1, A andB) as well as neonatal cardiomyocytes and COS cells (data not shown) released within minutes substantial amounts of Zn2+ as visualized by confocal microscopy using as indicator the membrane-permeable Zn2+-sensitive probe TSQ. The selective zinc-chelating agent TPEN quenched the TSQ fluorescence, indicating Zn2+ specificity (Fig. 1). To trace Zn2+ release to PKC, we probed T. ni insect cells infected with baculovirus constructs that harbored the full-length human PKCα or ζ-genes or empty vector. PMA produced a strong increase in fluorescence in the cells that overexpress PKCα but not in the cells expressing PKCα- or PKCζ-encoding genes or the empty vector (Fig. 1,C–F), in agreement with the known preference of PMA for the α-isoform (5Kazanietz M.G. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Kolch W. Mischak H. Wong G. Pettit G.R. Bruns J.D. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11590-11594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both α- and ζ-isoforms responded to hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1, E and F). Monitoring zinc release over time after peroxide administration revealed a noticeable signal in 60 s and a gradual increase to saturation within 15 min. PMA triggered the release of Zn2+ equally and rapidly in human PKCα-expressing insect cells. By comparison, PMA liberated a modest amount of Zn2+ in empty vector control insect cells, probably from insect PKC. The morphological appearance of TSQ staining changed from homogeneous cytoplasmic distribution of fluorescence in control toward a patchy distribution in PMA-treated cells, reminiscent of the vesicle-associated zinc accumulation seen in neurons (16Velazquez R.A. Cai Y. Shi Q. Larson A.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 6: 2288-2300Crossref Google Scholar). However, the TSQ fluorescence pattern did not overlap with that of PKC. As in mammalian cells, PMA caused PKCα to translocate to the plasma membrane as shown by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1 G). Different locations of TSQ and PKC indicate that released Zn2+ was responsible for enhanced TSQ fluorescence and not the binding of TSQ to PKC. Altogether, the results of Fig. 1 indicated that PKCα was the source of free intracellular Zn2+. The concept that zinc movements were important for PKC to gain enzymatic capacity was validated by comparing the Zn2+contents in resting and active PKC with the expectation that the former should contain more Zn2+. To test this assumption, native PKCα was immunoprecipitated from lysates of mouse splenocytes and thymocytes before and after PMA or hydrogen peroxide treatment. The immune complexes were collected on protein G coupled to agarose beads. Taking advantage of its hydrophobic nature, we loaded protein G-agarose beads with TSQ as a zinc-sensitive probe. Beads were analyzed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, the two methods giving concordant results. This assay system was validated by the addition of external Zn2+, which resulted in a strictly dose-dependent fluorescence emission. The fluorescence signal was quenched by TPEN. To measure the relative amounts of thiol-bound Zn2+ in PKC, we treated the precipitates with the thiol-reactive compound PMPS, which quantitatively displaced Zn2+ (17Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Schachman H.K. Ginsburg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14793-14803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The liberated Zn2+ partitioned to TSQ, increasing the fluorescence of the beads. Fig.2 displays the confocal images of TSQ-stained beads containing activated and resting PKC immunoprecipitates before and after PMPS addition together with control beads. Fig. 2, bar graphs, shows the results of quantitations of the confocal images by MetaMorph (Fig. 2 B) and of the FACS analyses (Fig. 2 D). Statistically significant differences in mean fluorescence values are evident. PMPS displaced far less Zn2+ from in vivo activated PKCα than from the resting protein. Phorbol ester caused a loss of approximately one-half of thiol-bound zinc contained in inactive PKC, whereas oxidation expelled over 80% of total extant zinc. PMA as well as peroxide was also capable of dissociating Zn2+by in vitro treatment of immunoprecipitates obtained from resting cells and less so from activated cells, supporting the data obtained in vivo (data not shown). Beads were tested in parallel for phosphotransferase activity and for PKC amount by Western blot to demonstrate equal loading (Fig. 2 C). Thus, the zinc content correlated inversely with PKC activity. To strengthen the finding that PKC was the principal source of liberated Zn2+ and to trace Zn2+ release to the zinc finger domain, we evaluated in vitro the GST fusion proteins containing the human PKCα C1A, PKCδ C1B, PKCζ C1, or cRaf C1 peptides (13Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P., M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), respectively, using a spectrofluorimetric quantitative assay based on TSQ as a probe. PKCα and PKCδ Cys domains released Zn2+ upon PMA treatment, whereas PKCζ and cRaf Cys domains did not. However, all of the proteins dissociated Zn2+ after H2O2 treatment. Detailed characteristics of the effect are presented for the PKCδ C1B peptide (Fig.3 A). Both 1.3-diolein and PMA triggered the release of stoichiometric amounts of zinc, each mole of lipid generating one equivalent of free Zn2+. Saturation was reached when approximately one-half of the available zinc was released. PMPS was used to determine total Zn2+ content in the GST fusion protein. The measured value was twice as high as that obtained by a saturating dose of PMA. However, the molar ratio of zinc to protein was below the theoretical value of 2.0, indicating that not all bacterially expressed molecules were faithfully folded and hence represented mixtures of active and inactive conformers. Oxidation by H2O2 also led to Zn2+ release from the protein that like PMA treatment reached saturation within a few minutes but freed almost twice as much Zn2+. Using the cRaf C1 domain as a control protein not known to bind PMA (18Ghosh S. Xie W.-Q. Quest A.F.C. Mabrouk G.M. Strum J. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10000-10007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we did not observe Zn2+ release with PMA, whereas oxidation was effective (Fig. 3 B). The results achieved with TSQ fluorimetry were confirmed by the commonly used colorimetric assay with PAR (17Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Schachman H.K. Ginsburg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14793-14803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To estimate the proportion of fully folded protein, the number of retinol binding sites was determined as described previously (12Hoyos B. Imam A. Chua R. Swenson C. Tong G.C. Levi E. Noy N. Hammerling U. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), yielding an average value of 0.25 or one-fourth of the theoretical value of 1. The total zinc content measured after PMPS treatment comprised also one-fourth of the theoretical value. Therefore, one-fourth of the bacterially expressed protein appears to represent the functional form. To clarify whether PMA and oxidation with hydrogen peroxide targeted the same or different zinc coordination centers, these two agents were tested alone and in combination. The results (Fig. 3 C) confirmed that each agent displaced half of the protein-bound zinc, whereas combined action caused total zinc release. Our results imply considerable plasticity of zinc ions in the PKC zinc finger. The function of zinc finger structures as redox-regulated reversible hinges was described for the bacterial chaperone Hsp 33 (19). In an oxidizing microenvironment, thiols were converted to disulfide, zinc became uncoupled, and the unfolding of the protein lead to the active enzyme (20Barbirz S. Jakob U. Glocker M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18759-18766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 21Jakob U. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38302-38310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although the Cys domains of mammalian serine/threonine kinases have long been known to serve as important regulation centers, the mechanism of such control has not been understood. We found that two chemically dissimilar activation signals and, more importantly, two alternate biochemical pathways converge at this structure and cause principally the same effect. It means that the release of Zn2+ ions from the molecule is of considerable importance, whether triggered by PMA or by reactive oxygen species. In both instances, our experiments suggest that the inactive kinase bound Zn2+ with an affinity exceeding that of our probes, TSQ and PAR. Upon oxidation or PMA binding to the Cys domain, the chelation status of Zn2+ was changed, allowing Zn2+ to partition to the probes. Our results are in complete agreement with those of Knapp and Kann (8Knapp L.T. Klann E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24136-24145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) who had previously underscored the importance of zinc release during PKC activation by the redox mechanism. We extend this concept to the classical pathway of PKC activation by lipid second messengers. The key conclusion is that both pathways converge on the zinc finger domains and cause in principle the same molecular event, the release of Zn2+. The most likely chemical targets of oxidation are the thiol groups of cysteines (8Knapp L.T. Klann E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24136-24145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 20Barbirz S. Jakob U. Glocker M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18759-18766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). As high affinity for zinc depends on the integrity of three S− anions, a loss of even one of these would destabilize the C3H1 zinc finger and allow precisely the kind of conformational changes that have been postulated by others for the initiation of PKC catalytic activity. These involve the removal of the regulatory N terminus from the catalytic domain, exposure of hydrophobic surfaces that facilitate translocation to membranes, and accessibility to substrate and cofactors (22Newton A.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 23Hurley J. Gobler J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Although a plausible mechanistic case can be made for redox activation of PKC, the impact of lipid second messenger on PKC structure is not intuitive. Our data implicate Zn2+ in a similar linchpin role in which its removal corresponds to the acquisition of catalytic capability. On crystallographic evidence, PMA probably affects His-269 in which it forms hydrogen links via Leu-251 and Leu-250 (14Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). PMA might therefore distort the tetrahedral symmetry by reducing the binding affinity of one Zn2+ ion. It is of interest that PMA, even in 10-fold molar excess, never liberated more than 1 of the 2 zinc equivalents contained in the composite zinc finger and so did mild oxidation. Because each agent given alone produced the release of one-half of the extant zinc, whereas the simultaneous exposure to low concentration of oxidizing agent and PMA caused 100% zinc release, the two triggers seem to target contralateral zinc ions. Altogether, the data presented above provide new insights into the role of Zn2+ in signaling processes and particularly in the regulation of protein kinase C. We demonstrate herein for the first time that a distinct protein, PKC, is the source of free Zn2+ in the cytoplasm. The two known activation mechanisms, lipid second messengers and mild oxidation, converge on the zinc finger domain and cause Zn2+ dissociation. Hence, far from forming a rigid structure, the zinc finger domain of PKC acts as a reversible hinge. The removal of the tetrahedrically coordinated zinc similar to pulling a linchpin allows the hinge to open and the PKC molecule to become functionally competent.

Kathryn Calame and Guy Vassort for helpful suggestions. We are especially grateful to John Waka and Scott A.

https://openalex.org/W2132678405,"Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-2 is a member of a family of intracellular proteins implicated in the negative regulation of cytokine signaling. The generation of SOCS-2-deficient mice, which grow to one and a half times the size of their wild-type littermates, suggests that SOCS-2 may attenuate growth hormone (GH) signaling. In vitro studies indicate that, while SOCS-2 can inhibit GH action at low concentrations, at higher concentrations it may potentiate signaling. To determine whether a similar enhancement of signaling is observed in vivo or alternatively whether increased SOCS-2 levels repress growth in vivo, we generated and analyzed transgenic mice that overexpress SOCS-2 from a human ubiquitin C promoter. These mice are not growth-deficient and are, in fact, significantly larger than wild-type mice. The overexpressed SOCS-2 was found to bind to endogenous GH receptors in a number of mouse organs, while phosphopeptide binding studies with recombinant SOCS-2 defined phosphorylated tyrosine 595 on the GH receptor as the site of interaction. Together, the data implicate SOCS-2 as having dual effects on GH signaling in vivo."

Although it is generally assumed that histone variants of germ line cells contribute to the restructuring of chromatin during spermatogenesis, their specific biological functions remain to be established. In contrast to other mammals, mature human sperm retains a set of core histones representing 10–15% of basic proteins (10Tanphaichitr N. Sobhon P. Taluppeth N. Chalermisarachai P. Exp. Cell Res. 1978; 117: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 11Gusse M. Sautiere P. Belaiche D. Martinage A. Roux C. Dadoune J.P. Chevaillier P. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1990; 265: 20662-20666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of these, histone H2B fraction (hSH2B) is the most abundant (10Tanphaichitr N. Sobhon P. Taluppeth N. Chalermisarachai P. Exp. Cell Res. 1978; 117: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 13Wattanaseree J. Svasti J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A complex composition of the hSH2B has been indicated (12Gatewood J.M. Cook G.R. Balhorn R. Schmid C.W. Bradbury E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20662-20666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although 17 replication-dependent H2B genes have been identified so far in the human genome (14Albig W. Trappe R. Kardalinou E. Eick S. Doenecke D. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), this complement contains neither testis- nor sperm-specific genes. We were particularly interested in the characterization of sperm H2B because of our recent finding that a H2B-related protein is an essential part of the telomere-binding complex in human sperm (15Gineitis A.A. Zalenskaya I.A. Yau P.M. Bradbury E.M. Zalensky A.O. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1591-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this paper, the hSH2B group has been characterized using a combination of biochemical and immunochemical techniques. Further, a gene for a novel human histone H2B variant belonging to this complement has been identified on chromosome 6. 2GenBankTM accession numberAF397301. Molecular cloning, followed by in vitro expression, resulted in a recombinant protein identical with one of the H2B variants isolated from mature sperm. This protein is 85% homologous to a major somatic H2B subtype and has over 93% homology with testis H2B of mouse and rat. We show that this novel human H2B gene is expressed exclusively in testis, and the protein is also found in sperm. Therefore, the protein is referred as hTSH2B (human testis/sperm-specific H2B). Selective extraction and immunochemical localization have revealed a specific distribution of H2B variants in sperm nuclei. hTSH2B was found only in a subpopulation of sperm cells, where it is located in chromatin domains in the basal area of nuclei. Sperm cells were collected by centrifugation from bulk human semen obtained from healthy fertile donors. Cells were washed with PBS and then in 0.25m sucrose, 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Both buffers contained the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone. Details of this procedure were described earlier (16Zalensky A.O. Yau P. Breneman J.W. Bradbury E.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 36: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 17Zalensky A.O. Breneman J.W. Zalenskaya I.A. Brinkley B.R. Bradbury E.M. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The extraction of total basic proteins from crude nuclei with 0.5n HCl was performed using the procedure described by Rogakou (18Rogakou E.P. Redon C. Boon C. Johnson K. Bonner W.M. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 38-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Before extraction, nuclei were incubated with 5% β-mercaptoethanol to disrupt the disulfide network formed by protamines. To reveal the subnuclear distribution of H2B histones, a three-step extraction procedure was used, as follows. First, nuclei were homogenized in Triton extraction buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1m NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5). Protein extraction was continued for 1 h with constant shaking. Triton-solubilized material was separated from nuclei by centrifugation. Following Triton extraction, nuclei were washed with 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, with nuclease digestion buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm DTT) and then resuspended in the latter buffer at a DNA concentration of 2 mg/ml. Micrococcal nuclease (Roche Diagnostics) was added (2 units/1 unitA 260 of DNA), and digestion was performed for 2 h at 37 °C. Digestion was stopped by the addition of EDTA, and the nuclease-solubilized material was separated from nuclei by centrifugation. The pellet remaining after nuclease digestion was salt-extracted in 0.6 m NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, overnight with constant shaking. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. All extraction buffers contained EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). A 0.6m NaCl nuclear extract obtained as described above was fractionated on a reverse phase C4 HPLC column (Vydac) using a gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) over 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Peak fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Genomic DNA was isolated from human sperm cells and purified as previously described (19Kozik A. Bradbury E.M. Zalensky A.O. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 51: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). hTSH2B was PCR-amplified from sheared human genomic DNA using a “touchdown” PCR method (20Roux K.H. Hecker K.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 67: 39-45PubMed Google Scholar), Thermozyme™ DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen), and the following primers (Invitrogen): 2B-5, CATATGCCGGAGGTGTCATCTAAAGGTGCTA; 2B-3, GGATCCTTACTTGGAGCTGGTGTACTTAGTGACAGCCTT. The annealing temperature was decreased incrementally from 70 to 62 °C over five cycles and then held at 56 °C for an additional 25 PCR cycles. The 393-bp TSH2B gene was ligated into pCR2.1 (Topo™TA Cloning® kit; Invitrogen) and transformed into Top10Escherichia coli (Invitrogen). Standard methods (21Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Strahl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar) were used to subclone the NdeI/BamHI TSH2B coding cassette from pCR2.1 into pET3a (Novagen). TSH2B-pET3a was confirmed by DNA sequencing and transformed into BL21(DE3) pLysS for isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible protein expression (Novagen). A 50-ml overnight culture was used to inoculate 2 liters of 2× YT medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (35 μg/ml). The culture was grown to an optical density of 0.5 (measured at 600 nm), induced with 230 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, and harvested by centrifugation. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, freeze-thawed, and homogenized. TSH2B inclusion bodies were isolated from the bacterial lysate and dissolved in unfolding buffer (7 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) (7 ml/liter of processed cells) according to a published method (22Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The dissolved crude protein was filtered and loaded onto a Superose 12 (Amersham Biosciences) fast protein liquid chromatography column (2.5 × 100 cm) in a running buffer of 7 m urea, 1.2m NaCl, 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA. Peak fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE, and the TSH2B fractions were combined, dialyzed against distilled water and lyophilized. The protein was then further purified by reverse phase HPLC as described above, but using a 30–60% gradient of acetonitrile over 60 min. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and pure hTSH2B fractions were combined and lyophilized. A panel of tissue-specific human First-Strand cDNA (Multiple-Choice™, Origene Technologies) was screened by PCR using 5 ng of library DNA and the 2B-5 2B-3 primer pair as described above. In addition, Titan reverse transcriptase-PCR (Roche Diagnostics) was performed using 100–300 ng of human testis and kidney mRNA (CLONTECH) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To examine TSH2B allelic variability in the human population, the following primers were used, which correspond to regions 100 bp upstream and 100 bp downstream of the TSH2B gene coding sequence (purchased from Invitrogen): hTSH2Bup, CGAGACTTGGAGCTGAGGTCATTTGGA; hTSH2Bdn, AACGAAGCCCACAGCTGTTTCAGTATG. Genomic DNA was isolated from sperm of eight unrelated subjects. PCR was conducted using the hTSH2Bup/dn primers and a “touchdown” thermal cycle program as described above. The PCR products from these reactions were purified using QIAquick Spin columns (Qiagen) and sequenced with the TH2Bup primer. Three electrophoretic systems have been used to analyze sperm proteins: acetic acid/urea (AU), acetic acid/urea/Triton (AUT), and SDS. AU PAGE was performed using 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 2.5 m urea (23Hurley C.K. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 80: 624-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and the protein samples contained 8 m urea. For AUT electrophoresis (24Zweidler A. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 17: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), the separation gel contained 15% acrylamide, 6.25 m urea and 5 mm Triton X-100 and was polymerized using thiourea and hydrogen peroxide (23Hurley C.K. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 80: 624-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was essentially as described by Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), but the concentration of Tris, pH 8.9, in the separation gel was increased to 0.75m. For two-dimensional separation, AU or AUT PAGE was used for the first dimension, and the proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue R250 (Sigma). Strips from stained AU or AUT gels were washed in water for 30 min and then in 62 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol for 60 min before application to the second dimension SDS gel. Coomassie-stained gel slices were destained with acetonitrile and 50 mmNH4HCO3 at a 1:1 ratio and were then dried using a speed vacuum centrifuge. Trypsin (Roche Diagnostics) was added in a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. The gel slices were extracted with 50% acetonitrile, 5% acetic acid for 45 min, and the supernatant was collected and lyophilized. All gel extracts were resuspended in a 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solution and further desalted using C18 ZipTips (Millipore Corp.). One microliter of desalted sample was mixed with 1 μl of a saturated solution (10 mg/ml) of R-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma), which was prepared by dissolving 10 mg in 1 ml of a 1:1 solution of acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. All mass spectrometry experiments were carried out on a PE Voyager DE-STR Biospectrometry work station equipped with an N2 laser (337 nm, 3-ns pulse width, 20-Hz repetition rate) in both linear and reflectron modes (PE Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The mass spectra of proteolytic digests were acquired in the reflectron mode with delayed extraction (DE). The m/z values of proteolytic peptides were calibrated externally with Calmix 1 (PE Biosystems). Immunoblotting was performed using a semidry system and 0.039 m glycine, 0.048 m Tris 0.0375% (w/v) SDS, 20% methanol as a transfer buffer at 0.8 mA/cm2 for 2.5 h. The efficiency of transfer to the Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) was checked using Ponceau S staining. The membrane was blocked overnight with 5% nonfat milk on PBST (Sigma). Primary antibodies were used at 1:3000 dilution in 1% milk, PBST, 350 mm NaCl. Secondary antibodies were used at 1:5000 dilution. Membranes were incubated with antibodies for 1 h and washed in PBST three times for 10 min each. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against purified calf thymus H2B were a gift from Dr. E. Bers (St. Petersburg University). Mouse monoclonal anti-tyrosine hydroxylase antibodies (TyH) were from Roche Diagnostics. In most experiments, anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Vector) were used as secondary antibodies, and immunodetection was performed with an ECL kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In some experiments, the localization of the anti-H2B reactive antigen was performed using ECL, and then the membrane was washed in PBST, additionally blocked for 1 h, incubated with mouse anti-TyH antibodies and horse anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Vector), and developed using a color reaction. For the immunofluorescence localization of histones, PBS-washed sperm cells were fixed with 0.5% formaldehyde in PBS for 5 min. The formaldehyde was washed off, and the cells were resuspended in PBS. Sperm nuclei were decondensed using DTT/heparin (17Zalensky A.O. Breneman J.W. Zalenskaya I.A. Brinkley B.R. Bradbury E.M. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Zalensky A.O. Tomilin N.V. Zalenskaya I.A. Teplitz R.L. Bradbury E.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, loaded onto a microscope slide, allowed to sit for 30 min, briefly washed with PBS, rinsed with water, and allowed to dry. Cells were permeabilized in ice-cold methanol for 30 min and dried again. Before the application of primary antibodies, cells were rehydrated in blocking solution (3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, 4× SSC) for 30 min. Monoclonal antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and anti-mouse antibodies labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Vector) were used at a 1:50 dilution in 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, 4× SSC. In some experiments, rabbit anti-H2B and anti-rabbit-FITC were used. The incubation time with antibodies was 45 min at 37 °C. Then the slides were washed at appropriate times in three changes of 0.1% Tween 20, 4× SSC for 5 min each. Nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide and observed using a fluorescent microscope. Images were captured by photography and scanned, and digital images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 software. The assay was performed as described previously (15Gineitis A.A. Zalenskaya I.A. Yau P.M. Bradbury E.M. Zalensky A.O. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1591-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 26Zalensky A.O. Tomilin N.V. Zalenskaya I.A. Teplitz R.L. Bradbury E.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5–1 ng of the labeled double-stranded (TTAGGG)12 probe was incubated with sperm nuclear extract (1–3 μg of total protein) in binding buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, 100–200 ng of denaturedHaeIII digest of E. coli DNA). In this work, we used extracts obtained with 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, which contain telomere-binding activity (15Gineitis A.A. Zalenskaya I.A. Yau P.M. Bradbury E.M. Zalensky A.O. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1591-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In some experiments, 1 μl of antibodies was added to the binding mixture. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the probes were loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide gel prepared in 0.5× TGE buffer (50 mm Tris base, 50 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA). After electrophoresis, gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. Total basic nuclear proteins were extracted with 0.5 n HCl and separated by two-dimensional PAGE (Fig.1 A). For better resolution of histones, we used AUT gel in the first dimension and SDS-PAGE in the second. Proteins separated by two-dimensional PAGE were immunoblotted with polyclonal antibodies to histone H2B (Fig.1 B). Several protein spots reacted with anti-H2B antibodies. Taking into account low cross-reactivity with other proteins including histone fractions in a control sample of total HeLa nuclear proteins, we suggest that all of these polypeptides are H2B-related. The electrophoretic mobilities of some of these fractions on SDS gel are close to that of somatic H2B, whereas others migrate more slowly, suggesting higher apparent molecular weights of sperm H2Bs (Fig.1 B). Thus, there are several unidentified proteins in human sperm that have common epitopes with somatic histone H2B. In this work, we identified, cloned, and characterized one protein from this complement. It was observed (8Unni E. Mayerhofer A. Zhang Y. Bhatnagar Y.M. Russell L.D. Meistrich M.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 27Mayerhofer A. Russell L.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 81BCrossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) that a monoclonal antibody against rat tyrosine hydroxylase (TyH) recognized an epitope within the rat and mouse testis-specific H2B (TH2B). This epitope is the peptide KGF, shared by TyH and rodent TH2Bs and localized in the N terminus of TH2B (Fig.2 B). Recently, Van Roijenet al. (28van Roijen H.J. Ooms M.P. Spaargaren M.C. Baarends W.M. Weber R.F. Grootegoed J.A. Vreeburg J.T. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 13: 1559-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) showed that anti-TyH also cross-reacted with a 17-kDa protein from human testis and sperm, but this histone was not characterized and its molecular identity remained unknown. Following up on these reports we searched for a protein homologous to rodent TH2B in the human genome. A BLAST search with the mouse nucleotide sequence corresponding to the TyH reactive peptide revealed a cDNA clone originating from a human testis library. In turn, this cDNA highlighted a genomic sequence on chromosome 6 as a top-ranked match. The complete coding sequence of this gene have been deposited into GenBankTM (accession number AF397301). We have demonstrated (see below) that this gene is specifically expressed in testis and that the corresponding protein is present in mature human sperm cells. Therefore, the protein is referred to as hTSH2B (human testis/sperm-specific H2B). Sequence alignment of hTSH2B with the human somatic H2B.1 revealed 85% identity with the highest conservation observed at the C-terminal region of the protein (Fig. 2 A). Within the first 25 N-terminal amino acids, 10 substitutions (40%) are found between the somatic and germ line proteins. Nine more substitutions are spread all over the central portion of the protein sequence. Human TSH2B shares a more extensive homology with testis H2B from both mouse (95%) and rat (93%) (Fig. 2 A). All testis histones have phenylalanine in position 16 (Fig. 2 B), which is likely to be crucial for recognition by the monoclonal anti-TyH antibodies. Importantly, amino acid sequence motifs in hTSH2B compared with somatic H2B provide six new potential sites for phosphorylation and a myristoylation site (Fig. 2 C). To determine the expression profile of the novel H2B gene, we looked for the presence of its messenger RNA in different human tissues. This was done by PCR using commercially available first-strand cDNA libraries from different human tissues (intestine, prostate, lung, ovary, muscle, and testis) and by reverse transcriptase-PCR using mRNA from kidney and testis. Fig. 3 shows that TSH2B is expressed exclusively in testis, a tissue enriched with spermatogenic cells. The coding sequence of human TSH2B was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA, cloned, and sequenced. It matched with a sequence in chromosome 6 identified above. In addition, a larger sequence (coding sequence plus 100 adjacent base pairs from 3′- and 5′-flanking regions of the hTSH2B gene) was PCR-amplified from genomic DNAs isolated from nine individuals and then sequenced. Genomic sequences isolated from four individuals (including the originally isolated clone) were identical. hTSH2B genes from five other individuals were identical among themselves but differed from the first group in three nucleotide substitutions within the coding region. All three single-nucleotide substitutions were silent and located in the last nucleotide of codons for Ile43, Ser66, and Lys127. Thus, the hTSH2B gene has allelic variants in the human population, but these single nucleotide polymorphisms do not change the protein sequence. To further characterize hTSH2B and identify this protein as a histone occurring in human sperm nuclei, we expressed this protein in E. coli. A two-step purification procedure results in the isolation of a single recombinant polypeptide (R-hTSH2B) with mobility close to the HeLa H2B histone as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig.3 A). It was demonstrated above (Fig. 1 B) that several H2B-related proteins are present in mature human sperm. To identify the hTSH2B expressed in vivo, we utilized its specific reactivity with anti-TyH antibodies. Preliminary experiments established the position of the anti-TyH-reacting H2B in a two-dimensional gel (shown byarrows in Fig. 1 B) and indicated that this H2B variant is enriched in 0.6 m NaCl sperm nuclear extract (data not shown). Therefore, the 0.6 m NaCl extract was used as the starting material for hTSH2B purification. Proteins were separated using reverse-phase HPLC and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-TyH antibodies (Fig. 3 B). A protein reacting with the anti-TyH antibodies was detected in a fraction eluted with 47% acetonitrile (Fig. 3 B, inset). Reprobing of the membrane with anti-H2B antibodies identified the same band. The polypeptide composition of partially purified hTSH2B (HPLC fraction 47; Fig. 3 B) is shown in Fig. 5 A,right lane. Both in vitro expressed R-hTSH2B and partially purified hTSH2B were separated using two-dimensional PAGE (Fig.4). AU PAGE was used as the first dimension (Fig. 4 A). The areas of AU gel corresponding to the core histones were cut out and subjected to SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. The second dimension gel was immunoblotted using anti-H2B and anti-TyH antibodies (Fig. 4 B). Antibodies against H2B (Fig. 4 B, top panels) recognize the somatic H2B of HeLa cells and both recombinant TSH2B and hTSH2B purified from sperm. Antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase recognize only the two latter proteins (Fig. 4 B, bottom panels). Since these proteins react with both antibodies, they belong to the H2B group and also have the unique anti-TyH epitope as expected from the sequence data (Fig. 2). The protein spots corresponding to R-hTSH2B, native hTSH2B, and HeLa H2B were cut from a stained two-dimensional gel proteolyzed and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Data analysis of the masses from the tryptic peptides was performed using Protein Prospector software (University of California, San Francisco). Five peptides withm/z values corresponding to the theoretically predicted peptides containing the unique N-terminal hTSH2B sequence (Fig. 2 A) and six peptides within amino acids 30–50 were found to be identical between the R-hTSH2B and native hTSH2B. An additional 15 peptides corresponding to the central and C-terminal regions of H2B shared by all three proteins were also identified. Therefore, the in vitro expressed R-hTSH2B matches with one of the H2B variants present in mature spermatozoa of humans (hTSH2B, shown in Figs. 1 B and 5). Interestingly, sperm hTSH2B is represented by two closely migrating polypeptides (Figs. 1 B and 4 B). At the present time, we do not know whether they result from sequence variants, different post-translational modifications, or partial degradation. The association of TSH2B with a particular chromatin domain may be indicative of its function. We were interested in whether hTSH2B is identical with the histone H2B variant previously described by us as a part of the telomere-binding complex in human sperm (15Gineitis A.A. Zalenskaya I.A.

Ectopic expression of p73 promotes transcription of p53 target genes and recapitulates the most characterized p53 biological effects such as growth arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation. Unlike p53-deficient mice that develop normally but are subject to spontaneous tumor formation, p73-deficient mice exhibit severe defects in the development of central nervous system and suffer from inflammation but are not prone to tumor development. These phenotypes suggest different biological activities mediated by p53 and p73 that might reflect activation of specific sets of target genes. Here, we have analyzed the gene expression profile of H1299 cells after p73α or p53 activation using oligonucleotide microarrays capable of detecting ∼11,000 mRNA species. Our results indicate that p73α and p53 activate both common and distinct groups of genes. We found 141 and 320 genes whose expression is modulated by p73α and p53, respectively. p73α up-regulates 85 genes, whereas p53 induces 153 genes, of which 27 are in common with p73α. Functional classification of these genes reveals that they are involved in many aspects of cell function ranging from cell cycle and apoptosis to DNA repair.

It has recently been shown that p73 can be acetylated in response to doxorubicin and selectively directed to activate specific target genes (19Costanzo A. Merlo P. Pediconi N. Fulco M. Sartorelli V.

More recent work has reported that p73 is required for p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage (20Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Crowley D. Sengupta S. Yang A. McKeon F. Jacks T.

Ectopic expression of p73 in p53−/−, and p53+/+ cells causes growth arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation, as does p53 (7Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A.

Biol. 2001; 21: 8461-8470Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These effects are achieved mainly through the activation of a plethora of specific target genes. Several reports show that p73 binds to p53 binding sites in vitro and in vivo and, consequently, activates p53 target genes (7Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A.

Nature. 1997; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Thus, transcriptional activation or repression of specific sets of target genes mediates the biological effects of both p53 and p73. The importance of functional and physical integrity of the transcriptional activation domain for p53 activity has been clearly demonstrated by the findings that mice carrying a p53 mutated in the N-terminal transactivation domain are prone to develop tumors, as do p53-deficient mice (26Jimenez G.S. Nister M. Stommel J.M. Beeche M. Bacarse E.A. Zhang X-Q. O'Gorman S. Whal G.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Major differences between p53 and p73 have been revealed by in vivo ablation of the genes. Thus, p53- and p73-deficient mice exhibit quite different phenotypes; p53-deficient mice develop normally but undergo spontaneous tumor formation (mainly sarcoma and lymphomas), whereas the p73 counterparts exhibit severe defects in the development of the central nervous system and suffer from inflammations (27Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D.

Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (4051) Google Scholar). Such differences are likely to depend also on activation or repression of different sets of target genes that need to be identified. Indirect support for such hypothesis has been provided by the recent findings that the potent transcriptional co-activator yes-associated protein (YAP) binds to the long forms of p73 and p63 but not to p53 (29Strano S. Munarriz E. Rossi M. Castagnoli L. Shaul Y. Sacchi A. Oren M. Sudol M. Cesareni G. Blandino G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15164-15173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The recent development of DNA microarrays has allowed global analysis of the pattern of activated or repressed genes in response to different types of stimuli, including p53 activation (30Zhao R.

Getz G. Domany E. Givol D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2225-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of this approach, we compared the gene expression profiles upon ponasterone A induction of p73α or p53 in the same cellular context, H1299. We found that p73α or wt-p53 expression modifies 141 and 320 genes, respectively. p73α up-regulates 85 genes, of which 25 are specific and 27 are in common with p53 regulation, whereas p53 induces 153 genes, of which 63 are specific. We will focus here on the p73 activated genes in response to ponasterone induction. Functional classification of these genes reveals that they are involved in many aspects of cell function ranging from cell cycle and apoptosis to DNA repair, including also several brain-specific genes involved in synaptic regulation. Furthermore, we report that p73α or p53 are recruited directly to some of the activated genes. Our findings indicate that, upon ectopic expression in the same cellular context, p73α promotes a specific transcriptional gene profile that only partially overlaps with that of p53. The H1299 cell line is derived from a human non-small cell lung carcinoma. H1299 cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Before transfection, the culture medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. H1299-pVgRXR cells were maintained in the same medium containing zeocin (100 μg/ml). The H1299-p73α and H1299-wt-p53 cell lines were maintained in medium containing zeocin and G418 (400 μg/ml). To induce expression of p73α or p53, ponasterone A, a synthetic analogue of ecdysone, was added to the medium (final concentration, 2.5 μm). Plasmids pVgRXR and pIND were from Invitrogen. pIND/p73α was prepared by cloning theBamHI/EcoRV fragment of human p73α, generated by PCR (the sequence of the oligonucleotides is available upon request), into pIND. pIND/wt-p53 was prepared by cloning theHindIII/XbaI fragment of human p53 (a kind gift of Dr. T. Unger) into pIND (33Wang Y. Blandino G. Oren M. Givol D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1923-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). H1299 cells were transfected with each plasmid using the calcium phosphate method. Clone selection was done with zeocin (100 μg/ml) for pVgRXR and with G418 (400 μg/ml) for pIND/p73α and pIND/wt-p53. Stable clones obtained by double selection were screened by immunoblotting using antibody Ab4 for p73 (Neomarker) and DO1 for p53. Total cell lysates were prepared as previously described (34Strano S. Munarriz E. Rossi M. Cristofanelli B. Shaul Y. Castagnoli L. Levine A.J. Sacchi A. Cesareni G. Oren M. Blandino G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29503-29512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and protein content was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Samples containing 50 μg of total protein were resolved by SDS-10% PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). For p73 detection, a p73 monoclonal antibody was used at a 1:200 dilution; for p53 detection, a mixture of p53 monoclonal antibodies DO1 and 1801 was used at a 1:40 dilution; for p21waf1 detection, a p21 polyclonal antibody (C19, Santa Cruz) was used at a 1:200 dilution. Cells (3 × 105) were seeded on 60-mm dishes, and 12 h later the medium was replaced by medium containing ponasterone A (2.5 μm final concentration). 24 h after ponasterone A addition, floating cells and attached cells were collected, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 5 ml of cold methanol for 30 min at −20 °C. After centrifugation and a further wash in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 μg/ml RNase and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and analyzed by cytofluorimetry with an Epics-XL analyzer (Coulter Corp.). Data were analyzed using the Cellfit program. Cells from H1299-pIND clone 1, H1299-p73α clones 9 and 11, and H1299-p53 clones 23 and 16 were harvested in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) at specific time points (0, 5, 9, 12, 24 h) after ponasterone A addition, and total RNA was isolated as per the manufacturer's instructions. Five micrograms of total RNA was reverse-transcribed at 37 °C for 45 min in the presence of random hexamers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR analyses were carried out by using oligonucleotides specific for the following genes: CaN19 (down, 5′-CTCTGAATTCGCCACAGATCCATGATGTGC; up, 5′-CTCTGCGGCCGCCAACAGACAAAAAAAGTTTAT TGAATACAAAAC); CaN19 (down, 5′-GTAAGGGGGAAATGAAGGAAC TTCT; up, 5′-ACAAAACTCAAAGGCATCAACAGTC); 14-3-3ς (down, 5′-TCTCAGTAGCCTATAAGAACGTGGTG; up, 5′-ATCTCGTAGTGGAAG ACGGAAAAGT); PIG3 (down, 5′-CCGGAAAACCTCTACGTGAA; up, 5′-CTCTGGGATAGGCATGAGGA); α1-antitrypsin (down, 5′-TTCTTCTCC CCAGTGAGCAT; up, 5′-GTGTCCCCGAAGTTGACAGT); p21waf1(down, 5′-CCTCTTCGGCCCGGTGGAC; up, 5′-CCGTTTTCGACCCTGAGAG); PTGF-β (down, 5′-GAGCTGGGAAGATTCGAACA; up, 5′-AGA TTCTGCCAGCAGTTGGT); JAG2 (down, 5′-CCTTAAGGAGTACCAGGCCAA; up, 5′-AAGTGGCGCTGTAGTAGTTCTCGT). The housekeeping aldolase A mRNA, used as an internal control, was amplified from each cDNA reaction mixture using the following specific primers: down, 5′-CGCAGAAGGGGTCCTGGTGA; up, 5′-CAGCTCCTTCTTCTGCTGCG. Amplified PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml) and visualized under UV light. Total RNA was isolated from H1299-PIND clone 1, H1299-p73α clone 9, and H1299-p53 clone 23 cells after the addition of ponasterone A for 0, 5, 9, 12, and 24 h. Biotin-labeled cRNA was synthesized and hybridized as described (35Kannan K. Kaminski N. Rechavi G. Jakob-Hirsch J. Amariglio N. Givol D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3449-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) to the Genechip HuGene FL array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), which contains probes for ∼11,000 mRNA species, and one chip was hybridized to cRNA from each time point. Scanned output files were visually inspected for hybridization artifacts. Arrays lacking significant artifacts were analyzed using Genechip 3.3 software (Affymetrix). Arrays were scaled to an average intensity of 1200/gene and analyzed independently. The expression value for each gene was determined by calculating the average of differences (perfect match intensity minus mismatch intensity) of the probe pairs in use for this gene. Ratios were determined by dividing the average difference of H1299-p73α or H1299-p53 for each time point with those of the 0-h time point. Clustering analysis was performed by the super-paramagnetic clustering method (36Blatt M. Wiseman S. Domany E. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1996; 76: 3251-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) on the 211 genes that were up-regulated more than 2-fold in at least 3 time points by the induction of p53 (153 genes) or p73α (85 genes), where 27 genes were common to both p73 and p53. The gene had to be “Present” in the Present/Absent call provided by Affymetrix software at least at one time point. Each gene was represented by eight components representing the ratio of the average difference value provided by the Affymetrix software at each time point divided by that of 0-h time point (before the addition of ponaterone). The 0-h time point was the average of the 0 h of the two cell lines and the eight components containing four from the p73α and four from the p53 induced cells, each at the indicated time point (5, 9, 12, and 24 h). Before clustering we normalized each row such that its mean vanishes, and its norm is one (35Kannan K. Kaminski N. Rechavi G. Jakob-Hirsch J. Amariglio N. Givol D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3449-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) as follows.A ij represents the ratios of the expression of genei (where i = 1–211), measured at experiment (and time point), j = 1–8. We subtract fromA ij its average <Ai> (see Equation 1) and divide the difference by ςi, its S.D. for gene i (see Equation 2); the resulting 8-component vector represents genei, and the resulting normalized matrix is denoted byB ij (see Equation 3). Ai=18∑j=18AijEquation 1 ςi2=18∑j=18AiAij2Equation 2 Bij=AijAiςiEquation 3 The clustering algorithm measured the distance between the genes using the regular Euclidean distance between their normalized values. Genes with similar expression profiles (over the eight time points) are represented by two nearby vectors and are placed in the same cluster. H1299-p73α clone 9 and H1299-wt-p53 clone 23 cells were treated with ponasterone A to induce the expression of p73α and wt-p53 for 24 h. DNA and proteins were cross-linked by the addition of formaldehyde (1% final concentration) 10 min before harvesting, and cross-linking was stopped by the addition of glycine pH 2.5 (125 μm final concentration) for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were scraped off the plates, resuspended in hypotonic buffer, and passed through a 26-gauge needle. Nuclei were spun down, resuspended in 300 μl of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and a protease inhibitor mixture), and sonicated to generate 500–2000-bp fragments. After centrifugation, the cleared supernatant was diluted 10-fold with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The cell lysate was precleared by incubation at 4 °C with 15 μl of protein G beads preadsorbed with sonicated single-stranded DNA and bovine serum albumin. The cleared lysates were incubated overnight with a mixture of anti-p73 polyclonal antibodies (C17 and C19) (Santa Cruz), anti-green fluorescent protein polyclonal antibody (Invitrogen), or anti-p53 (Ab7) or without any antibody. Immune complexes were precipitated with 30 μl of protein G beads preadsorbed with sonicated single-stranded DNA and bovine serum albumin. After centrifugation the beads were washed, and the antigen was eluted with 1% SDS, 100 mm sodium carbonate. DNA-protein cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4–5 h, and DNA was phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. Levels of CaN19, p21waf1, 14-13-3ς, PIG3, α1-antitrypsin, JAG2, and PTGF-β DNAs were determined by PCR using oligonucleotides spanning the p53/p73 binding sites. The following specific oligonucleotides were used: CaN19-up site (down, 5′-GTGTTCAAAGCCTGACACCTAACTT; up, 5′-TGGATCATAGCTCACTGTAATCTCG); CaN19-down site (down, 5′-AAGTAGCTGGGACTACAAGCGTATG; up, 5′-GGGATAGAAAAGCCCAGCTAAGATA); p21waf1-up site (down, 5′-CTATTTGGGACTCCCCAGTCTCTT; up, 5′-GGTTTACCTGGGGTCTTTAGAGGTC); p21waf1-down site (down, 5′-ATGTATAGGAGCGAAGGTGCA GAC; up, 5′-CCTCCTTTCTGTGCCTGAAACA); 14-3-3ς (down, 5′-CTGTACTTCAGCCTGGACATCAGAG; up, 5′-CCGACCTAATAGTTGAGCCAG GAT); PIG3 (down, 5′-CAGGACTGTCAGGAGGAGGCGAGTGATAAGG; up, 5′-GTGCGATTCTAGCTCTCACTTCAAGCAGAGG); JAG2 (down, 5′-ACTGCTGCCTTCTGGAAACTC; up, 5′-CAAGTGGTGAACAAGGGAGACT). Oligonucleotides specific for thymidine kinase promoter (down, 5′-GTGAACTTCCCGGAGGCGCAA; up, 5′-GCCCCTTTAAACTTGGTGGGC) were used as negative control. Inducible cell lines overexpressing p73α or p53 were generated in two steps. First, H1299 cells were transfected with pVgRXR followed by zeocin selection (33Wang Y. Blandino G. Oren M. Givol D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1923-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 34Strano S. Munarriz E. Rossi M. Cristofanelli B. Shaul Y. Castagnoli L. Levine A.J. Sacchi A. Cesareni G. Oren M. Blandino G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29503-29512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The resulting clones were transiently transfected with pIND/p73α or with pIND/wt-p53 plasmid and maintained in the presence of ponasterone A. The highest expressor of either p73α or wt-p53 was chosen and stably transfected with the above-mentioned plasmids or the pIND control vector followed by G418 selection. Western blot and immunostaining with an anti-p73 monoclonal antibody or with a mixture of anti-p53 DO1 and 1801 monoclonal antibodies were performed to screen for p73α- and p53-inducible expression and intracellular localization. As seen in Fig.1, A and B,upper panels), for 2 representative clones (H1299-p73α clone 9 and H1299-wt-p53 clone 23) expression of both p73α and p53 was induced by ponasterone A (2.5 μm). To verify whether the induced proteins were transcriptionally active we checked the expression of p21waf1 and found it induced by both p73α and p53 (Fig. 1, A and B, middle andlower panels). In addition, both of these proteins were predominantly nuclear, as expected (data not shown). Identical analyses performed in H1299-pIND cells revealed no p53 protein, since H1299 cells are p53 null, and no p21waf1 induction was shown upon ponasterone A (data not shown). With regard to endogenous p73α, H1299 cells express very low protein levels, undetectable by direct immunoblot (data not shown) and detectable only in p73 immunoprecipitates followed by Western blot with specific anti-p73 antibodies (34Strano S. Munarriz E. Rossi M. Cristofanelli B. Shaul Y. Castagnoli L. Levine A.J. Sacchi A. Cesareni G. Oren M. Blandino G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29503-29512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To further verify whether transcriptionally active p73α and p53 were capable of altering the growth of H1299 cells, we analyzed the cell cycle profile of each clone upon ponasterone A induction. We found that p73α or p53 expression causes an increase in the G1population accompanied by a decrease in the S phase population (Fig.2, Band C). No alterations in the cell cycle profile of H1299-pIND clone 1 cells were found (Fig. 2 A). H1299-pIND clone 1, H1299-p73α clone 9, and H1299-wt-p53 clone 23 cells were stimulated with ponasterone A and harvested in TRIzol reagent after 0, 5, 9, 12, and 24 h (Fig.1). To eliminate background noise in the analysis of the hybridization experiments, we chose a very stringent filter and considered only those genes that showed more than 2-fold induction or repression at 3 or more time points in the p73α or p53 clones over the average of the 0-h time points of the cell lines. By this criteria, 153 genes were found up-regulated by p53 and 167 genes were found down-regulated. In the p73α-expressing cells, 85 and 56 genes fulfilled the threshold criteria for up and down regulation, respectively. To characterize the global gene expression due to p53 or p73α activation we employed a scatter plot analysis of these genes at 5 and 24 h compared with the 0-h time point (before ponasterone A addition). We found that the expression level of this collection of genes changed very little in the control cell line (H1299-pIND clone 1) but showed extensive changes in the p53- and p73-expressing cell lines (data not shown). It also appears that in the p53 cell line there may be leaky expression of p53 since some of the genes showed increased expression even at 0 h (data not shown). Indeed, low level expression of p53 at 0 h, before induction, is detectable in Fig.1. Analysis of the genes whose expression was altered in both cell lines identified a group of common genes that were activated by both p53 and p73 and a group of genes that responded only to p53 or p73 (Fig.3). For example, 27 and 21 genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively, by both proteins using the filter of 2-fold change at three or more time points. These were defined as “common genes.” Fig. 3 shows that 65 genes (shaded circles) passed this filter for p53 but were up-regulated by p73 over 2-fold only once or twice (but not three times). Similarly 33 genes (shaded circles, Fig. 3 A) passed the filter for up-regulation by p73 and were also up-regulated more than 2-fold by p53 once or twice. These groups of genes therefore showed preference in their response to activation by either p73 or p53. Last, two groups of genes were up-regulated more than 2-fold at least at three time points by only one of the transcription factors and not even once by the other. p73 induced 25 such genes (denoted “p73”, see Table Iand Fig. 3 A), and p53 induced 63 such genes (denoted “p53”; see Fig.3 A).Table ITarget genes modulated by p73α and p53InducerAccession No.SymbolGene functionp73p53591224591224hhCell cyclep73AF001436CEP2Cdc42 effector protein 23.62.42.72.21.01.51.41.6p73X57348SFNStratifin (14–3-3 sigma)1.22.92.58.21.00.81.00.9p73M87068CAN19CaN192.03.53.47.91.51.21.21.4p73*W28729MCM3APMCM3-associated protein2.63.01.62.43.30.92.02.1p73*U47414CCNG2cyclin G22.12.32.33.81.61.93.81.8p73/p53AI304854CDKN1Bp27, Kip12.92.32.72.73.42.96.45.4p73/p53U03106CDKN1Ap21 WAF11.62.92.93.31.93.23.04.3DNA repairp73AL039458LIG1DNA ligase2.52.32.62.30.70.70.70.7p73*CAC004770FEN1/RAD2Endonuclease involved in base excision repair1.23.24.27.92.40.62.31.2p73/p53D42045SNM1DNA-cross-link repair geneSNM12.51.22.12.22.03.22.02.3p73/p53AF076838RAD17DNA damage G2checkpoint2.71.74.64.12.02.13.47.4Tumor suppressor/apoptosisp73AF010309PIG3Quinone oxidoreductase1.11.822.21.21.51.51.1p73U60060FEZ1Lung cancer tumor suppressor0.62.12.15.50.61.80.81.5p73*AL049783CG005Hypothetical tumor suppressor from BRCA2 region2.51.32.12.71.81.32.51.7p73/p53D86958RB1CC1Rb transcription regulator2.72.02.62.72.22.03.12.6p73/p53AF045581BAP1BRCA1-associated ubiquitin hydrolase3.81.93.54.23.82.04.93.4p73/p53U13897DLG1Homolog to Drosophilatumor suppressor2.21.82.53.82.52.13.33.5p73/p53AI813532TNFRSF1BTumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily2.42.81.72.51.62.82.72.6Growth factor/growth regulatorp73U20982IGFBP4Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 42.72.72.42.40.50.60.50.5p73/p53AB000584TGF-βTGF-β superfamily protein MIC11.45.15.311.73.48.78.85.3p73/p53M29053IL-7Interleukin 72.62.32.72.83.13.13.43.0p73/p53M34057LTBP1TGF-β-binding protein1.32.22.02.42.92.32.12.5Receptorp73X52425IL-4RInterleukin 4 receptor1.92.42.22.40.90.80.70.8p73AF065388TSPAN-1Tetraspan 1 cell adhesion differentiation2.03.42.42.21.71.61.21.4p73*CAF022853ABCC1MDR-associated protein2.42.22.33.01.41.52.51.6p7"
https://openalex.org/W1993159379,"Animal societies are stages for both conflict and cooperation. Reproduction is often monopolized by one or a few individuals who behave aggressively to prevent subordinates from reproducing (for example, naked mole-rats, wasps and ants). Here we report an unusual mechanism by which the dominant individual maintains reproductive control. In the queenless ant Dinoponera quadriceps, only the alpha female reproduces. If the alpha is challenged by another female she chemically marks the pretender who is then punished by low-ranking females. This cooperation between alpha and low-rankers allows the alpha to inflict punishment indirectly, thereby maintaining her reproductive primacy without having to fight."

In the present study, the specificity of the purified recombinant human heparanase was investigated for the first time using a series of structurally defined oligosaccharides isolated from heparin/heparan sulfate. The best substrates were ΔHexUA(±2S)-GlcN(NS,6S)-GlcUA-GlcN(NS,6S)-GlcUA-GlcN(NS,6S) and ΔHexUA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S)-GlcUA-GlcN(NS,6S) (where ΔHexUA, GlcN, GlcUA, NS, 2S, and 6S represent unsaturated hexuronic acid,d-glucosamine, d-glucuronic acid, 2-N-sulfate, 2-O-sulfate, and 6-O-disulfate, respectively). Based on the percentage conversion of the substrates to products under identical assay conditions, several aspects of the recognition structures were revealed. 1) The minimum recognition backbone is the trisaccharide GlcN-GlcUA-GlcN. 2) The target GlcUA residues are in the sulfated region. 3) The -GlcN(6S)-GlcUA-GlcN(NS)- sequence is essential but not sufficient as the cleavage site. 4) The IdoUA(2S) residue, located two saccharides away from the target GlcUA residue, claimed previously to be essential, is not indispensable. 5) The 3-O-sulfate group on the GlcN is dispensable and even has an inhibitory effect when located in a highly sulfated region. 6) Based on these and previous results, HexUA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S)-IdoUA-GlcNAc(6S)-GlcUA-GlcN(NS,±6S)-IdoUA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S) (where HexUA represents hexuronic acid) has been proposed as a probable physiological target octasaccharide sequence.

HS-GAG binds to and co-localizes with structural proteins, such as fibronectin and collagen in the ECM, providing a framework for matrix organization (for reviews, see Refs. 7Oldberg Å. Antonsson P.

Both cell surface and ECM HS-PGs also tether various growth/differentiation factors and cytokines as storage depots of bioactive signaling molecules. There is clear evidence that an association of a ligand with HS-GAGs can activate or stabilize the ligand and also facilitate signal transduction via its high affinity receptor (for reviews, see Refs. 10Stringer S.E. Gallagher J.T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 11Lyon M. Gallagher J.T.

Indeed, fine sulfation structures of HS-GAGs change during development, aging, or tumor progression to malignancy, and the abilities of specific ligands to bind HS-PGs are switched (15Jayson G.C.

Another way to alter the functional state of HS-PGs is to degrade and release HS-GAGs from the core proteins, which is achieved by the specific action of an endoglycosidase, heparanase (for reviews, see Refs. 19Bame K.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar and 20Parish C.R. Freeman C. Hulett M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1471: 99-108PubMed Google Scholar). Heparanase is the name of mammalian endoglucuronidase capable of specifically cleaving HS-GAGs and differs from bacterial eliminases such as heparinase and heparitinase (21Nakajima M. Irimura T., Di Ferrante N. Nicolson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2283-2290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extracellular heparanase has been implicated in basement membrane remodeling after injury or at inflammation sites by destroying HS-GAG chains and in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation by releasing growth factors that are bound to extracellular HS-PGs. There is also evidence that the heparanase activity correlates with the metastatic potential of tumor cells in animal models and increases in the sera of human patients with metastatic cancers (22Nakajima M. Irimura T., Di Ferrante D., Di Ferrante N. Nicolson G.L. Science. 1983; 220: 611-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 23Nakajima M. Irimura T. Nicolson G.L. J. Cell.

It became clear that heparanases previously purified from various sources are identical and that the heparanase is initially synthesized as an inactive 65-kDa glycoprotein and then processed into the active 50-kDa enzyme by cleavage of the N terminus peptide (for reviews, see Refs. 19Bame K.J.

A direct role of the heparanase in tumor cell invasion was confirmed by the transfection of the sense and antisense heparanase cDNA into cells, which acquired highly and poorly metastatic phenotypes, respectively (26Vlodavsky I.

Previously, several attempts were made to define the substrate specificity of the heparanase partially purified from different animal sources (for reviews, see Refs. 19Bame K.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar and 20Parish C.R. Freeman C. Hulett M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1471: 99-108PubMed Google Scholar). Most approaches have involved the structural analysis of the fragments generated by enzymatic cleavage of polymer HS from various tissues and heparin (Hep) polysaccharides derived from the lung and intestine. Specificity studies on human heparanase using structurally defined oligosaccharide substrates have been limited to those performed using partially purified enzyme preparations (33Thunberg L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18770-18777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In the present study, we systematically investigated the specificity of the purified recombinant human heparanase using a number of structurally defined oligosaccharides as substrates and revealed the hitherto unreported specificity of the enzyme, which will aid establishing the quantitative assay methods and designing inhibitors for new therapeutic strategies in highly metastatic cancer and other heparanase-related diseases, notably inflammatory or cardiovascular diseases.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, the substrate recognition by the homogenous recombinant human heparanase was examined in detail for the first time using a series of structurally defined oligosaccharides. The findings of the present study demonstrated the importance of the highly sulfated structure, which is located on both sides of the targeted GlcUA residue. Notably, the preferred sulfation positions by the heparanase were revealed; the enzyme cleaves in principle the glucuronidic linkage in the -GlcNAc(6S)-GlcUA-GlcN(NS)- sequence, although this sequence is not sufficient, and an additional sulfate group on this or adjacent sequence (see Hexa-15) appears to be required.The elucidated sequence requirement was in good agreement with the cleavage sequence, suggested based on the structures of the remnant cleavage sites found in the penta- and trisaccharides isolated from porcine intestinal native Hep-GAG after digestion with bacterial heparinase/heparitinases (36Yamada S.

Yoshida K. Sugahara K. Khoo K.H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), are of particular interest in view of the recognition sequence by porcine or mammalian heparanase. They are odd-numbered unlike other even-numbered oligosaccharides and appear to be derived from the reducing and nonreducing ends of the parent Hep-GAG chains as discussed previously (36Yamada S. Sakamoto K. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. Khoo K.H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 40Yamada S. Yamane Y. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1863-1871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), since they do not possess GlcN at the reducing terminus or ΔHexUA at the nonreducing terminus, respectively. The above mentioned oligosaccharides were most likely generated from the sequence of -HexUA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S)-IdoUA-GlcNAc(6S)-GlcUA*-GlcN(NS)-Ido- UA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S)- by the action of endogenous heparanase on the glucuronidic bond indicated by an asterisk. Although the unsaturated pentasaccharide is a major digestion product (40Yamada S. Yamane Y. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1863-1871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 53Chuang W.L. Christ M.D. Peng J. Rabenstein D.L.

Porcionatto M.A. Tersariol I.L. Pinhal M.A. Oliveira F.W. Moraes C.T. Dietrich C.P. J. Biol.

Based on these findings, the structural characteristics of the predominant saccharide sequence required for the substrate recognition by the heparanase in native Hep polysaccharides could be summarized as shown in Fig. 6 C. It is conceivable that human, porcine, and bovine heparanases are similar in their specificity. The proposed structure is consistent with the previous finding by Oldberg et al. (47Oldberg Å.

It should also be noted that rat parathyroid heparanase is strikingly different from our enzyme in that it works at neutral and slightly acidic pH values and does not cleave heparin (56Podyma-Inoue K.A.

Vlodavsky I. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18770-18777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 57Bai X. Bame K.J. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Esko J.D. J. Biol.

In the previous studies, which demonstrated the importance of IdoUA(2S), partially purified enzymes from human hepatoma and platelets (34Pikas D.S., Li, J. Vlodavsky I. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18770-18777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and cultured CHO cells were used (57Bai X. Bame K.J. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23172-23179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, the partially purified enzyme preparations might contain unidentified regulatory factors that interact with the 2-O-sulfate group and modulate the enzyme activity. The purified platelet heparanase was reportedly a 137-kDa protein (58Oosta G.M. Favreau L.V. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11249-11255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may suggest aggregation or complex formation with other protein(s). The 2-O-sulfate group in question appears to be nonessential for the enzyme action, as suggested previously (59Freeman C. Parish C.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1341-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), but may facilitate the enzyme action. Although the formation of intermediate HS breakdown products characteristic of the heparanase action was prevented in the HS 2-O-sulfotransferase-deficient CHO mutant cells, the heparanase transcript was not detected in the purified CHO cell mRNAs (19Bame K.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Therefore, the major enzyme responsible for degrading HS in CHO cells may be a distinct heparanase(s) (60Bame K.J. Hassall A. Sanderson C. Venkatesan I. Sun C. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 61Bame K.J. Venkatesan I. Stelling H.D. Tumova S. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Structural changes in HS in animal models of malignancy have been reported, showing a transformation-associated reduction in charge density of HS chains (for a review, see Ref. 62Sanderson R.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In metastasizing tumor cells, heparanase is highly expressed and degrades the ECM and vascular basement membranes (22Nakajima M. Irimura T., Di Ferrante D., Di Ferrante N. Nicolson G.L.

Med. 1999; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar), whereas less sulfated HS chains on the tumor cell surface may evade the attack of the heparanase secreted by the tumor cells themselves. Alternatively, heparanase plays critical roles in tumor growth and metastasis by releasing bioactive HS fragments from the tumor cell surface HS-PGs, which can serve as potent promoters of tumor progression. Being consistent with this concept, HS fragments generated from tumor cell surface HS-PGs by the treatment with bacterial heparinase promoted tumor cell growth mediated through basic fibroblast growth factor signaling pathways (63Liu D. Shriver Z. Venkataraman G., El Shabrawi Y. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 568-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In the transition to malignancy in human colon adenoma cells, the overall molecular organization of HS is preserved but distinctly modified in the sulfated domains, and it may contribute to the aberrant behavior of the cancer cells (15Jayson G.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 51-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Tetra-1, ΔHexUA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S)-GlcUA-GlcN(NS,6S), wasone of the best substrates among the oligosaccharides tested in the present study (Table I). This is the major tetrasaccharide product generated from commercial Hep preparations by the treatment with the bacterial heparinase (3.6 μmol from 100 mg of heparin) (38Yamada S. Murakami T. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8696-8705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 64Linker A. Hovingh P. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 127: 75-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Previous heparanase assay methods used heterogeneous Hep/HS polysaccharides as substrates (19Bame K.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Parish C.R. Freeman C. Hulett M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1471: 99-108PubMed Google Scholar). Since the number of the heparanase cleavage sites varies among different Hep/HS preparations, it has been difficult to make a precise comparison of the activities. The use of structurally defined Tetra-1 as a substrate makes it possible to develop a simple and quantitative assay to measure the heparanase activity, which will provide a powerful diagnostic method to assess the invasive state of the cancer.The findings of the present study also provided clues for developing specific inhibitors for the heparanase. The minimum heparanase recognition sequence contained neither GlcN(3S) nor IdoUA(2S), which are imperative elements for Hep/HS to interact with antithrombin III or basic fibroblast growth factor, respectively (for reviews, see Refs. 5Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholarand 12Conrad H.E. Heparin-Binding Proteins. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998: 301-349Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, it should be possible to design oligosaccharide analogs for developing potent heparanase-specific inhibitors by avoiding GlcN(3S) and IdoUA(2S) and hence harmful side effects that may be induced by inhibition or acceleration of those biologically active proteins. Thus, the findings of the present study will lead to a framework toward the development of HS-based anti-cancer or anti-inflammation therapeutics. Interactions between adherent cells and the extracellular environment influence maintenance of cellular functions such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HS-PGs)1 are covalently linked protein-HS glycosaminoglycan (GAG) conjugates found in extracellular matrix (ECM) and on the cell surface of most cells and have been demonstrated to be key components of the cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions (for reviews, see Refs. 1David G.

Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 269-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Most of the biological properties of HS-PGs are conferred by the HS moiety, which is a sulfated polydisperse copolymer of alternating GlcN and HexUA (GlcUA or IdoUA) residues (for reviews, see Refs. 5Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar and 6Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol.

HS-GAG binds to and co-localizes with structural proteins, such as fibronectin and collagen in the ECM, providing a framework for matrix organization (for reviews, see Refs. 7Oldberg Å. Antonsson P.

The present study demonstrates that Cr(VI) induces hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activity through the specific expression of HIF-1α but not HIF-1β subunit and increases the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in DU145 human prostate carcinoma cells. To dissect the signaling pathways involved in Cr(VI)-induced HIF-1 expression, we found that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling was required for HIF-1α expression induced by Cr(VI). Neither phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase nor extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity was required for Cr(VI)-induced HIF-1 expression. Cr(VI) induced expression of HIF-1 and VEGF through the production of reactive oxygen species in DU145 cells. The major species of reactive oxygen species responsible for the induction of HIF-1 and VEGF expression is H2O2. These results suggest that the expression of HIF-1 and VEGF induced by Cr(VI) may be an important signaling pathway in the Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis.

Most mutations of human cancer are because of the activation of oncogenes and the loss of function of tumor suppressor genes, which commonly induce new blood vessels (angiogenesis) for tumors to grow beyond a few millimeters in diameter (1Folkman J.

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a heterodimeric basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, composed of HIF-1α and HIF-1β/aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator subunits (4Wang G.L. Jiang B.H.

Although HIF-1α and VEGF are implicated in cancer development, the mechanisms of HIF-1α activation and stabilization of HIF-1α protein remain to be studied. The present study investigates Cr(VI)-induced expression of HIF-1α and VEGF in DU145 human prostate carcinoma cells and the role of individual reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cr(VI) is chosen, because it is a well established carcinogen (32Rojas E. Herrera L.A. Poirier L.A. Ostrosky-Wegman P. Mutat. Res. 1999; 443: 157-181Google Scholar). Cr(VI)-containing compounds are widely used in industry under many occupational settings and are found in the environment in the soil and water. Epidemiological studies have shown that workers in the chromate production industry have a consistently high risk for cancer than the general population. Cr(VI) compounds are also potential inducers of tumors in experimental animals (32Rojas E. Herrera L.A. Poirier L.A. Ostrosky-Wegman P. Mutat. Res. 1999; 443: 157-181Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis are not understood fully, ROS are considered to play an important role (33Shi X. Dalal N.S. Environ.

Previous studies have shown that upon reduction by cellular oxidants, Cr(VI) is able to generate a whole spectrum of ROS, i.e. O 2⨪, H2O2, and ⋅OH. It is well known that ROS play important roles in carcinogenesis induced by a variety of carcinogens. Through ROS-mediated reaction, Cr(VI) is able to activate p53 and induce apoptosis (37Wang S.

In the present study, we tested whether Cr(VI) is able to induce expression of HIF-1α and VEGF. The specific questions were as follows. (a) Is Cr(VI) able to induce HIF-1 and VEGF expression? (b) What are the up-stream signal pathways in Cr(VI)-induced expression of HIF-1α protein? (c) Are ROS species involved in Cr(VI)-induced HIF-1α and VEGF expression? (d) Which species among ROS play the critical roles in Cr(VI)-induced HIF-1α and VEGF expression? Potassium dichromate (Cr(VI)) was purchased from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). NADPH, superoxide dismutase, sodium formate, deferoxamine, diphenylene iodonium (DPI), and rotenone were purchased from Sigma. Catalase was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Hydroethidine (HE) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Antibodies against HIF-1α and HIF-1β were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The human VEGF immunoassay kit was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The human prostate cancer cell line DU145 was maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 3% chicken serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells form a monolayer at confluence. Trypsin (0.25%) EDTA solution was used to detach the cells from the culture flask for plating and passing the cells. The cells were plated in a 60-mm culture dish and treated with Cr(VI). Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm NaF) supplemented with 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm leupeptin, 2 mm aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 2 mm pepstatin A on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was harvested as the nuclear protein extract and stored at −70 °C. The protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Richmond, CA). The nuclear protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm glycine and 20% (v/v) methanol. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with antibodies against HIF-1α and HIF-1β. Protein bands were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and visualized through enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). DU145 cells were plated in a 6-well plate at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in MEM medium and incubated overnight before the cells were subjected to treatment. After treatment, the cell culture media were removed for storage at −80 °C. VEGF protein concentration in the media was determined by ELISA using a commercial kit (R & D Systems). Briefly, 200 μl of standards or cell culture supernatant were pipetted into the wells of a microplate that had been pre-coated with a monoclonal antibody specific for VEGF and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing away any unbound substances, an enzyme-linked polyclonal antibody against VEGF conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added to the wells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Following a wash, 200 μl of substrate solution was added to the wells and incubated for 30 min and then 50 μl of stop solution was added to stop color development. The optical density of each well was determined using a microplate reader at 450 nm. A mean value of duplicate samples for each experiment and two separate experiments were used for analysis. ESR spin trapping technique was used to detect free radical generation. This technique involves the addition-type reaction of a short-lived radical with a diamagnetic compound (spin trap) to form a relative long-lived free radical product (spin adduct), which can be studied by conventional ESR (46Britigan B.E. Rosen G.M. Thompson B.Y. Chai Y. Cohen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17026-17032Google Scholar). The intensity of the spin adduct signal corresponds to the amount of short-lived radicals trapped, and the hyperfine couplings of the spin adduct are generally characteristic of the original trapped radicals. All ESR measurements were conducted using a Varian E9 ESR spectrometer and a flat cell assembly as described (47Shi X. Dong Z. Huang C. Ma W. Liu K. Ye J. Chen F. Leonard S.S. Ding M. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 194: 63-70Google Scholar). Hyperfine couplings were measured (to 0.1 G) directly from magnetic field separation using potassium tetraperoxochromate (K3CrO8) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl as reference standards. Reactants were mixed in test tubes in a total final volume of 500 μl and transferred to a flat cell for ESR measurement. Cellular H2O2 was determined with a quantitative H2O2 assay kit (BIOXYTECH® H2O2-560TM; Portland, OR). The assay was performed according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. This assay is based on the oxidation of ferrous ions (Fe2+) to ferric ions (Fe3+) by H2O2 under acidic conditions. The ferric ion binds with the indicator dye xylenol orange to form a stable colored complex that can be measured at 560 nm. Briefly, cells were pretreated with Cr(VI) and with or without antioxidants. The aliquots of media were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min with 100 μl of a 10× xylenol orange stock solution (xylenol orange (10 μm), Fe(NH4)2(SO4)·6H2O (2.5 μm), H2SO4 (25 mm)) after which the absorbance was read at 560 nm. The concentration of H2O2 was determined from a standard curve (0–100 μm). HE is a specific dye for O 2⨪. HE is oxidized by O 2⨪ to ethidium that stains nucleus to form a bright fluorescent red (37Wang S. Leonard S.S. Ye J. Ding M. Shi X. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C868-C875Google Scholar, 39Ye J. Wang S. Leonard S.S. Sun Y. Butterworth L. Antonini J. Ding M. Rojanasakul Y. Vallyathan V. Castranova V. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34974-34980Google Scholar). DU145 cells were cultured in a 6-well plate at 5 × 105 cells/well 24 h before treatment. After the cells were treated with Cr(VI), HE was added into the cell culture 30 min before the treatment was completed. Then the cells were washed twice in 1× PBS buffer and harvested for flow cytometric analysis. For cellular image assay, the cells were plated onto a glass slip in the 12-well plate at 1 × 105 cells/well 24 h before treatment. HE was added into the cell culture 30 min before treatment was completed. After being stained, the cells were washed in PBS and fixed with 10% buffered formalin. The slip was mounted on a glass slide and observed using a Saratro 2000 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) laser scanning confocal microscope (Optiphot-2; Nikon, Melville, PA) fitted with an argon-ion lasser. Oxygen consumption measurements were carried out with a Gilson oxygraph equipped with a Clark microelectrode (Gilson Medical Electronic, Middleton, WI). These measurements were made from mixture containing 1 × 106 cells/ml and various treatments in a total volume of 1.5 ml. The oxygraph was calibrated with media equilibrated with oxygen of known concentrations. The dominant-negative form of HIF-1, HIF-1DN, was subcloned into pCEP4 as described previously (14Jiang B.H. Jiang G. Zheng J.Z. Lu Z. Hunter T. Vogt P.K. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 363-369Google Scholar). A VEGF reporter containing a 2.65-kbKpnI-BssHII fragment of the human VEGF gene promoter was cloned into the pGL2 basic vector as described previously (16Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Google Scholar). DU145 cells were cultured as described above. VEGF reporter plasmid (1.5 μg) was transfected into the cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), and the relative luciferase activity was assayed as described previously (14Jiang B.H. Jiang G. Zheng J.Z. Lu Z. Hunter T. Vogt P.K. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 363-369Google Scholar). Briefly, after transfection, cells were cultured in fresh medium for 12 h and then the cells were switched to medium in the absence or presence of 1.5 μm Cr(VI) for 24 h or were switched to the medium containing 1.5 μm Cr(VI) and superoxide dismutase (1000 units/ml), catalase (10,000 units/ml), or sodium formate (2 mm) as indicated for 24 h. The cells co-transfected with the dominant-negative form of HIF-1, HIF-1DN, were cultured in fresh medium for 12 h, followed by the incubation with the medium in the presence of 1.5 μm Cr(VI) for 24 h. Light production was measured for 15 s, and the values were corrected by subtracting the readings obtained with nontransfected cells and were normalized to the control in each experiment. To determine whether Cr(VI) could induce the expression of HIF-1 in DU145 cells, cells were exposed to Cr(VI) at different concentrations for 3 h, and total cellular protein extracts were prepared for immunoblot assays of HIF-1α and HIF-1β protein levels. As shown in Fig.1 A, the levels of HIF-1α protein in Cr(VI) exposed cells were increased markedly in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the levels of HIF-1β protein were not altered. The maximum induction of HIF-1α expression was caused by Cr(VI) at a concentration of 5 μm, whereas further increase in Cr(VI) concentration resulted in a slight decrease, possibly because of Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis. A time course study of the expression of HIF-1α revealed that Cr(VI) (5 μm) induced HIF-1α expression in a time-dependent manner, whereas it did not affect HIF-1β expression (Fig. 1 B). The maximum induction of HIF-1α expression in response to Cr(VI) occurred at 3 h after exposure and began to decrease after 6 h. To determine whether PI3K signaling pathway was required for HIF-1α expression, DU145 cells were treated with LY294002 or wortmannin, inhibitors of PI3K. The cells were then exposed to different concentrations of Cr(VI) for 3 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared for immunoblot assays for HIF-1α and HIF-1β protein levels. As shown in Fig.2, A and B, neither LY294002 nor wortmannin inhibited HIF-1α expression induced by Cr(VI), suggesting that PI3K activity is not required for induction of HIF-1α by Cr(VI). We also investigated whether MAPK activity was required for HIF-1α expression. Cells were pretreated with PD98059, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase, or SB202190, an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase. Cells were then treated with 5 μm Cr(VI). Protein levels were determined using Western blot. The results (Fig.2 C) indicated that PD98059 did not have any inhibitory effect on HIF-1α expression, whereas SB202190 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of HIF-1α expression induced by Cr(VI) (Fig. 2 D). These results suggest that p38 MAP kinase activity is required for HIF-1α expression, whereas mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase activity is not involved in HIF-1α activation. VEGF is regulated by HIF-1 in response to hypoxia. To investigate whether the induction of HIF-1 by Cr(VI) increased VEGF expression, the level of VEGF protein produced by DU145 cells was analyzed by ELISA. As shown in Fig.3, VEGF protein levels in untreated cells were increased over a period of 48 h. Treatment with 2.5 μm Cr(VI) markedly increased the induction of VEGF expression in a time-dependent manner. ROS are implicated to play a major role in Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis. To determine whether Cr(VI) could induce HIF-1α and VEGF expression though ROS, we examined the ROS generation in the Cr(VI)-treated cells. The ability of Cr(VI) to generate⋅OH radicals was examined using an ESR spin trapping method. DU145 cells alone did not produce any detectable amount of free radicals (Fig. 4 A). DU145 cells incubated with Cr(VI) generated a 1:2:2:1 quartet ESR spectrum (Fig. 4 B). The splittings of this spectrum were aH = aN = 14.9 G, where aN and aH denote hyperfine splittings of the nitroxyl nitrogen and α-hydrogen, respectively. Based on these splittings and the 1:2:2:1 line shape, this spectrum was assigned to the DMPO/⋅OH adduct (34Shi X.L. Dalal N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 627-634Google Scholar, 49Gao N. Ding M. Zheng J.Z. Zhang Z. Leonard S.S. Liu K.J. Shi X. Jiang B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31963-31971Google Scholar, 50Shi X. Ding M. Ye J. Wang S. Leonard S.S. Zang L. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. Chiu A. Dalal N. Liu K. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1999; 75: 37-44Google Scholar), which is evidence for ⋅OH radical generation. Addition of superoxide dismutase, an O 2⨪ scavenger, slightly decreased the DMPO/⋅OH adduct signal (Fig. 4 C). Catalase, an H2O2 scavenger, decreased the generation of ⋅OH radical induced by Cr(VI) (Fig.4 D). Sodium formate, a scavenger of ⋅OH radical, also reduced the intensity of DMPO/⋅OH signal (Fig. 4 E). Deferoxamine, a metal chelator, suppressed the DMPO/⋅OH signal with a concomitant generation of deferoxamine-derived free radical (Fig. 4 F). NADPH, a cofactor of certain flavoenzymes, which catalyzes the conversion from Cr(VI) to Cr(V), markedly enhanced the generation of both Cr(V) and ⋅OH radical (Fig. 4 G). To determine whether NADPH oxidase or the mitochondria electron transport chain could play an important role in Cr(VI)-induced ROS generation, DPI, NADPH oxidase inhibitor, and rotenone, a mitochondrial electron transport interrupter, were used. As shown in Fig. 4,H and I, both DPI and rotenone reduced ⋅OH radical generation induced by Cr(VI). These results indicated that both NADPH oxidase and the mitochondrial electron transport chain were involved in Cr(VI)-induced ROS generation. The ability of Cr(VI) to generate both H2O2 and O 2⨪ in DU145 cells was analyzed by quantitative H2O2 assay kit, which determines H2O2 generation. In the presence of Cr(VI), H2O2 generation was dramatically enhanced, whereas catalase markedly suppressed the formation of H2O2 induced by Cr(VI) (Fig.5). Specific fluorescent dye was used directly to visualize free radical generation inside the DU145 cells. HE, a specific fluorescent dye for O 2⨪, was used to detect the generation of O 2⨪ The cells were visualized with a laser scanning confocal microscope. When comparing to control, Cr(VI) markedly enhanced O 2⨪ radical production inside the cell, which exhibited a red or orange color after being oxidized by O 2⨪. Addition of superoxide dismutase decreased it (Fig.6 A). The generation of O 2⨪ was also examined by flow cytometry analysis of the stained cells. For O 2⨪ production, the relative fluorescence intensity increased from 200 to 550 after Cr(VI) treatment (Fig. 6 B). Because dye staining is not specific for the detection of O 2⨪, specific antioxidants and metal chelator were used to verify that O 2⨪ radicals were indeed detected. Superoxide dismutase, a specific scavenger of O 2⨪, decreased the relative fluorescence intensity from 550 to 350, whereas catalase, sodium formate, and deferoxamine had only minor effects (Fig.6 B). Because O 2⨪ is the one-electron reduction product of molecular oxygen, the O2consumption in cells treated with Cr(VI) was measured using an oxygraph. As shown in Fig. 7, Cr(VI) increased the O2 consumption, and addition of NADPH enhanced it.Figure 6Production of O 2⨪ in the DU145 cells. A, the cells were plated onto a glass slip in the 12-well plate at 1 × 105 cells/well 24 h before the treatment. The cells were incubated with 10 μmHE for 30 min, washed twice with 1× PBS, and fixed with 10% formalin in 1× PBS. The images of cells were captured with a confocal fluorescence microscope. B, DU145 cells were seeded in 6-well plate and cultured until 90% confluence. The cells were pretreated with or without antioxidants 30 min prior to the addition of 150 μm Cr(VI) and 5 μm HE for 30 min. The cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and collected for flow cytometric analysis. a, DU145 cells only; b, cells + Cr(VI);c, cells + Cr(VI) + superoxide dismutase (1,000 units/ml);d, cells + Cr(VI) + catalase (10,000 units/ml);e, cells + Cr(VI) + 5 mm sodium formate;f, cells + Cr(VI) + 2 mm deferoxamine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7Oxygen consumption in the cells.

As shown in Fig.8 A, treatment of cells with Cr(VI) at a concentration of 5 μm for 3 h induced HIF-1α expression. Catalase, a H2O2 scavenger, inhibited Cr(VI)-induced HIF-1α expression. Sodium formate, an⋅OH radical scavenger, slightly inhibited it. In contrast, treatment of cells with superoxide dismutase did not inhibit Cr(VI)-induced HIF-1α expression. The results indicated that H2O2 played a key role in Cr(VI)-induced HIF-1α expression. To further confirm the role of ROS in biological activity of HIF-1α induced by Cr(VI), the effects of various specific antioxidants on Cr(VI)-induced VEGF expression were determined using ELISA. Treatment of cells with Cr(VI) induced a significant increase in VEGF protein level secreted by the culture cells (Fig. 8 B). Pretreatment of cells with catalase decreased the VEGF protein level induced by Cr(VI), and sodium formate slightly inhibited it, whereas superoxide dismutase did not exhibit any effect on VEGF expression (Fig. 8 B). In contrast, deferoxamine, a metal chelator, enhanced the protein level of VEGF induced by Cr(VI). These results suggest that H2O2 generated by Cr(VI) plays an important role in Cr(VI)-induced HIF-1α and VEGF expression. We transfected a VEGF reporter containing a 2.5-kb fragment of the 5′ flanking region from the human VEGF gene to determine whether Cr(VI) induced transcriptional activation of VEGF in the cells. Cr(VI) increased the reporter activity by 50% in the presence of 1.5 μmCr(VI) (Fig. 9 A), and this induction and basal activity of the reporter were completely inhibited by catalase (Fig. 9 B). Superoxide dismutase and sodium formate exhibited some inhibition. Cotransfection of the dominant-negative form of HIF-1, HIF-1DN, also inhibited both induction and basal activity of the reporter. These results suggest that both H2O2 generation and HIF-1 are important for the transcriptional activation of VEGF. The results obtained from the present study show that Cr(VI) was able to induce HIF-1α and VEGF protein expression in dose- and time-dependent manner in DU145 cells, whereas HIF-1β protein levels were not affected by Cr(VI) treatment. It has been reported that HIF-1β is not affected significantly by cellular oxygen tension (5Jiang B.H. Semenza G.L. Bauer C. Marti H.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1172-C1180Google Scholar), whereas HIF-1α protein is degraded rapidly under normoxic conditions by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (51Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Google Scholar, 52Kallio P.J. Wilson W.J. O'Brien S. Makino Y. Poellinger L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6519-6525Google Scholar, 53Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Google Scholar). Cr(VI) may increase HIF-1α expression by a similar signal pathway as hypoxia. The functional HIF-1α·HIF-1β complex is regulated primarily by the abundance of the HIF-1α subunit. It is known that HIF-1 activates VEGF expression by binding directly to VEGF promoter in response to hypoxia. Similarly, the induction of HIF-1 by Cr(VI) resulted in an increased level of VEGF expression. HIF-1 and VEGF expression are associated with cancer progression and metastasis. There is a possibility that the induction of HIF-1 and VEGF may play a major role in Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis. The present study also shows that ROS were involved in Cr(VI)-induced HIF-1α and VEGF expression. Among them, we suggest that H2O2 plays a key role based on several lines of evidence as follows. (a) Treatment of cells with Cr(VI) caused an increase in the generation of H2O2using quantitative H2O2 assay. (b) ESR spin trapping measurements show that cells pretreated with Cr(VI) generated ⋅OH radical using H2O2 as a precursor. (c) Cr(VI) increased the rate of cellular oxygen consumption. (d) Catalase, a specific scavenger of H2O2, decreased the generation of ROS. (e) Catalase inhibited HIF-1α or VEGF expression induced by Cr(VI), whereas sodium formate, a scavenger of ⋅OH, showed little effect. (f) Superoxide dismutase did not inhibit Cr(VI)-induced HIF-1α and VEGF expression. Among these ROS, H2O2 appears to be the major species responsible for in Cr(VI)-induced HIF-1α and VEGF expression. Our results indicate the possibility that Cr(VI)-mediated HIF-1α and VEGF expression may be involved in carcinogenesis induced by this metal. The mechanism of ROS generation induced by Cr(VI) could be that in the presence of NADPH and several cellular flavoenzymes (such as glutathione reductase, lipoyl dehydrogenase, ferredoxin-NADP+, and NADPH oxidase), the mitochondria electron transport chain is able to reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(V). During the reduction process, molecular oxygen is consumed to generate O 2⨪, which subsequently is converted to H2O2 through superoxide dismutase dismutation. Indeed, the oxygen consumption assay shows that molecular oxygen is the original source of ROS generation in DU145 under Cr(VI) stimulation. The major pathways involved in ROS generation are both the flavoprotein-containing NADPH oxidase complex and the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This conclusion was supported by the inhibition of ROS generation by DPI, a flavoprotein inhibitor, as well as rotenone, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial electron transport chain as determined by ESR measurements. Previous studies have shown that both hypoxia and CoCl2elicited an increase in dichlorofluorescin fluorescence and that oxidation of the fluorescence probe increases prior to the stabilization of HIF-1α suggesting that ROS are required for stabilization and activation of HIF-1α (54Salnikow K. Su W. Blagosklonny M.V. Costa M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3375-3378Google Scholar). The antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate abolished the stabilization of HIF-1α in response to hypoxia and CoCl2, which suggests the involvement of ROS in stabilization and activation of HIF-1α. It has also been reported that treatment with exogenous H2O2 induced expression of HIF-1α, and catalase, an H2O2 scavenger, abolished H2O2-induced HIF-1α activation (55Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25130-25138Google Scholar). Other studies have found that mitochondria-derived ROS are both required and sufficient to initiate HIF-1α stabilization during hypoxia. Hypoxia increases mitochondrial ROS generation at ComplexIII, which causes accumulation of HIF-1α protein (55Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25130-25138Google Scholar). These results are consistent with our observations that catalase, a specific scavenger, abolished the expression of HIF-1α. Although oxygen sensor for HIF-1α expression is not yet known, the possible involvement of an NADPH oxidoreductase, such as flavoprotein, was proposed (56Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Google Scholar). O2-heme binding proteins and cytochrome P-450 were also proposed as possible oxygen sensors. Interestingly, in Hep3B hepatoma cells incapable of mitochondrial respiration, HIF-1 expression in the cells is inhibited in response to hypoxia (57Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11715-11720Google Scholar), indicating that ROS produced by the mitochondria may play an important role in inducing HIF-1 expression. The present study demonstrates that Cr(VI) is able to induce HIF-1α and VEGF expression through ROS-mediated reactions. Among these species, H2O2 plays a major role. The results obtained from the present study have demonstrated that neither PI3K nor MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway is involved in induction of HIF-α by Cr(VI). Instead, p38 pathway is required. Although the relationship between p38 and HIF-α has not been established, from the present study it appears that Cr(VI) induces generation of ROS, which cause p38 phosphorylation, leading to HIF-1α activation (Cr(VI) → ROS → p38 → HIF-1α). p38 is an oxidative stress-sensitive MAP kinase. Previous study from our laboratories has shown that Cr(VI) is able to cause p38 phosphorylation in mouse macrophase cell line RAW 264.7 cells (58Chen F. Ding M. Lu Y. Leonard S.S. Vallyathan V. Castranova V. Shi X. J. Environ. Pathol. Toxicol. Oncol. 2000; 19: 231-238Google Scholar). We have also shown that Cr(VI) is able to activate p38 in DU145 cells, and catalase inhibits Cr(VI)-induced p38 phosphorylation (data not shown). It may noted that many other mineral particles and chemical carcinogens, such as asbestos and silica, are reported to be capable of generating H2O2 upon stimulation of the cells (59Ding M. Shi X. Lu Y. Huang C. Leonard S. Roberts J. Antonini J. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9108-9114Google Scholar, 60Huang C. Ding M. Li J. Leonard S.S. Rojanasakul Y. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. Ju G. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22397-22403Google Scholar, 61Vallyathan V. Shi X. Environ. Health Perspect. 1997; 105: 165-177Google Scholar). It is possible that those agents may have the same function as Cr(VI); i.e. they may induce HIF-1α and VEGF expression through H2O2-mediated reaction. Because HIF-1α and VEGF are involved in cancer development, H2O2-induced HIF-1α and VEGF expression could be an important signal transduction pathway involved in carcinogenesis induced by these carcinogens. However, it should be noted that different agents may induce HIF-α and VEGF through different pathways. In our recent study (49Gao N. Ding M. Zheng J.Z. Zhang Z. Leonard S.S. Liu K.J. Shi X. Jiang B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31963-31971Google Scholar), we have shown that vanadate is able to induce HIF-α and VEGF through PI3K/Akt pathway. In Cr(VI)-induced HIF-α and VEGF induction, neither PI3K nor Akt is involved. Instead, p38 signaling plays a key role. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that Cr(VI) is able to increase the levels of HIF-1α and VEGF expression through p38 MAP kinase pathway. H2O2 generated during the Cr(VI) reaction is the major species responsible for Cr(VI)-induced expression of HIF-1α and VEGF. Further studies concerning the mechanism of HIF-1α and VEGF expression induced by Cr(VI) may yield important clues regarding the role of HIF-1α and VEGF in carcinogenesis induced by Cr(VI)."
https://openalex.org/W1980654745,"Vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) was originally described as a potent vascular permeability factor (VPF) that importantly contributes to vascular pathobiology. The signaling pathways that underlie VEGF/VPF-induced permeability are not well defined. Furthermore, endogenous vascular peptides that regulate this important VPF function are currently unknown. We report here that VPF significantly enhances permeability in aortic endothelial cells via a linked signaling pathway, sequentially involving Src, ERK, JNK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT. This leads to the serine/threonine phosphorylation and redistribution of actin and the tight junction (TJ) proteins, zona occludens-1 and occludin, and the loss of the endothelial cell barrier architecture. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) inhibited VPF signaling, TJ protein phosphorylation and localization, and VPF-induced permeability. This involved both guanylate cyclase and natriuretic peptide clearance receptors. <i>In vivo</i>, transgenic mice that overexpress ANP showed significantly less VPF-induced kinase activation and vascular permeability compared with non-transgenic littermates. Thus, ANP acts as an anti-permeability factor by inhibiting the signaling functions of VPF that we define here and by preserving the endothelial cell TJ functional morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2118814319,"The phosphorylation state of transcription factors is a critical determinant of their function. C/EBPβ occurs in cells as the transcriptional activator liver-enriched activating protein (LAP) and in the truncated form liver-enriched inhibitory protein (LIP) that inhibits transcription. Analysis of C/EBPβ phosphorylation by isoelectric focusing (IEF) shows that LAP is present in multiple forms, each with a different degree of phosphorylation in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts. Growth hormone (GH) treatment induces a new band near the negative pole, consistent with GH-promoted dephosphorylation of LAP. In addition, bands near the positive pole are rapidly and transiently induced, suggesting that GH also stimulates phosphorylation at some site(s) on LAP. C/EBPβ contains a highly conserved MAPK consensus site that corresponds to Thr188 in murine (m) LAP and Thr37 in mLIP. Immunoblotting with antiphosphopeptide antibodies specific for Thr188/37 of C/EBPβ (anti-P-C/EBPβ) shows that GH rapidly and transiently promotes phosphorylation of mLAP and mLIP on the MAPK site. MEK inhibitors prevent this GH-promoted phosphorylation of LAP and LIP, suggesting that such phosphorylation depends on GH-activated MAPK signaling. Mutation of Thr235 to Ala in the homologous MAPK site of human (h) LAP (hLAPT235A) inhibits transcription mediated by the c-fos promoter in response to GH, indicating that phosphorylation at the MAPK site is required for LAP to be transcriptionally active in the context of GH-stimulated activation of the c-fos promoter. Complexes bound to the c-fos C/EBP site transiently contain C/EBPβ phosphorylated at the MAPK site. As phosphorylation subsides, the binding of less transcriptionally active forms of LAP increases, consistent with the transient nature of c-fos stimulation by GH and other growth factors. Thus, both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of C/EBPβ, in response to a single physiological stimulus such as GH, coordinately modulate the ability of C/EBPβ to activate transcription by modulating its DNA binding activity and its transactivation capacity. The phosphorylation state of transcription factors is a critical determinant of their function. C/EBPβ occurs in cells as the transcriptional activator liver-enriched activating protein (LAP) and in the truncated form liver-enriched inhibitory protein (LIP) that inhibits transcription. Analysis of C/EBPβ phosphorylation by isoelectric focusing (IEF) shows that LAP is present in multiple forms, each with a different degree of phosphorylation in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts. Growth hormone (GH) treatment induces a new band near the negative pole, consistent with GH-promoted dephosphorylation of LAP. In addition, bands near the positive pole are rapidly and transiently induced, suggesting that GH also stimulates phosphorylation at some site(s) on LAP. C/EBPβ contains a highly conserved MAPK consensus site that corresponds to Thr188 in murine (m) LAP and Thr37 in mLIP. Immunoblotting with antiphosphopeptide antibodies specific for Thr188/37 of C/EBPβ (anti-P-C/EBPβ) shows that GH rapidly and transiently promotes phosphorylation of mLAP and mLIP on the MAPK site. MEK inhibitors prevent this GH-promoted phosphorylation of LAP and LIP, suggesting that such phosphorylation depends on GH-activated MAPK signaling. Mutation of Thr235 to Ala in the homologous MAPK site of human (h) LAP (hLAPT235A) inhibits transcription mediated by the c-fos promoter in response to GH, indicating that phosphorylation at the MAPK site is required for LAP to be transcriptionally active in the context of GH-stimulated activation of the c-fos promoter. Complexes bound to the c-fos C/EBP site transiently contain C/EBPβ phosphorylated at the MAPK site. As phosphorylation subsides, the binding of less transcriptionally active forms of LAP increases, consistent with the transient nature of c-fos stimulation by GH and other growth factors. Thus, both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of C/EBPβ, in response to a single physiological stimulus such as GH, coordinately modulate the ability of C/EBPβ to activate transcription by modulating its DNA binding activity and its transactivation capacity. Phosphorylation of transcription factors is a critical mode of regulation of gene expression (1Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation can modulate transcription factor activity by regulating subcellular localization (e.g. signal transducers and activators of transcription) (2Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R.

These possibilities are not mutually exclusive, and phosphorylation at multiple sites by different kinases, or dephosphorylation by activation of phosphatases or inactivation of kinases can result in dynamic regulation of transcription factors at multiple levels. The integration of multiple changes in phosphorylation is reflected in the functional activity of that transcription factor. C/EBPβ, a member of the bZIP family of transcription factors, is present in cells as three alternate translation products: 35- and 32-kDa proteins in murine cells known as LAP (liver-enriched activating protein) and a 20-kDa protein known as LIP (liver-enriched inhibitory protein) (13Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). The N-terminal region of LAP corresponds to the transactivation domain, whereas LIP lacks this transactivation domain and acts as an inhibitor of transcription (13Descombes P. Schibler U.

Thus, differential phosphorylation of C/EBPβ may account for its participation in a wide variety of biological effects. In vitro phosphorylation of rat C/EBPβ by PKA and/or PKC on Ser240, located in the DNA binding domain, is reported to attenuate site-selective DNA binding (28Trautwein C. van der Geer P. Karin M. Hunter T. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2554-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of C/EBPβ also decreases DNA binding (5Piwien-Pilipuk G.

Phosphorylation on Ser105 of rLAP or Thr235 of hLAP is also reported to be a key determinant of its transactivation capacity (7Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimoto T.

It has been postulated that C/EBPβ contains negative regulatory regions, and that phosphorylation(s) within these domains may regulate C/EBPβ function. Thus, C/EBPβ may be present in cells as a repressed transcription factor that becomes activated upon phosphorylation (31Kowenz-Leutz E. Twamley G. Ansieau S. Leutz A.

Acta. 1986; 823: 207-225PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, GH has been found to promote dephosphorylation of mLAP and mLIP (34Liao J. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Ross S.E. Hodge C.L. Sealy L. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31597-31604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The GH-induced dephosphorylation of C/EBPβ is mediated, at least in part, by GH-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling, resulting in inhibition of GSK-3 (5Piwien-Pilipuk G. Van Mater D. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19664-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of LAP leads to an increase in binding of LAP-containing complexes to C/EBP sites in the c-fos andaP2 promoters. Conversely, GSK-3-induced phosphorylation of LAP decreases binding to the c-fos C/EBP site (5Piwien-Pilipuk G. Van Mater D. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19664-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GH-promoted inhibition of GSK-3 is required for GH to stimulate c-fos promoter activity. The present study examines which among the multiple phosphorylation site(s) of LAP and LIP are functionally important for transcriptional activation, in the context of GH-stimulated c-fos promoter activation. By isoelectric focusing (IEF) LAP was found to be present in 3T3-F442A cells in several forms exhibiting different degrees of phosphorylation. IEF revealed that GH promotes not only dephosphorylation, but also a rapid and transient phosphorylation of murine C/EBPβ on Thr188 in mLAP and Thr37 in mLIP, sites that correspond to the same conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) consensus sequence in each form. Mutational analysis of hLAP at Thr235 (homologous to Thr188 in mLAP) indicates that this phosphorylation is critically important for LAP to be transcriptionally active in the context of the GH-stimulated c-fos promoter. Changes in DNA binding associated with changing levels of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated C/EBPβ may contribute to the transient pattern of GH-stimulated c-fos expression. Thus, C/EBPβ is a highly phosphorylated protein whose function is dynamically modulated by both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in response to a single physiological regulator. Murine 3T3-F442A preadipocyte fibroblasts, which are highly responsive to GH through endogenous GH receptors (36Schwartz J. Carter-Su C.

In some experiments, cell extracts were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 1 μl of anti-CEBPβ (1:10 final dilution), anti-P-CEBPβ (1:10 final dilution), or nonimmune (1:10 final dilution) antiserum prior to EMSA, as indicated in the figure legends. Complexes were separated by nondenaturing 7% PAGE followed by autoradiography. CHO-GHR cells (1 × 105 cells/35 mm well) were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation (41Chen D.

Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were deprived of serum by incubation in medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 18 h prior to treatment. Cell lysates were prepared as described previously (34Liao J. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Ross S.E. Hodge C.L. Sealy L. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol.

The luciferase values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Each condition was tested in duplicate in each experiment.

GH promotes a rapid and transient dephosphorylation of endogenous mLAP and mLIP in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes (34Liao J. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Ross S.E. Hodge C.L. Sealy L. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J.

Similar promotion of LAP and LIP dephosphorylation was also induced by insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin. 2A. Sieh, A. Sachdeva, and J. Schwartz, unpublished data. However, in all cases, a considerable amount of phosphorylated C/EBPβ is still evident on immunoblots. Because both LAP and LIP contain phosphorylation sites for multiple kinases, C/EBPβ may be present as multiple phosphorylated species not resolved by conventional SDS-PAGE. IEF was used to analyze C/EBPβ, because IEF separates proteins according to charge density in a pH gradient generated in the gel. mLAP overexpressed in 293T cells is resolved into at least 8 bands by IEF (Fig.1 A, lane 1). This suggests that overexpressed mLAP is present in multiple forms with different degrees of phosphorylation. As expected, overexpressed mLIP is detected as a single band that runs close to the negative pole (Fig.1 A, lane 2), consistent with LIP being a basic protein (isoelectric point = 10.42), which is not further resolved under the conditions of IEF used. Endogenous LAP from untreated 3T3-F442A fibroblasts can be resolved into at least 4 bands (Fig. 1 B, lane 1, bands b-e), indicating that endogenous mLAP is present in quiescent cells in multiple forms with different degrees of phosphorylation. The dense uppermost band at the basic end (Fig. 1 B,arrowhead) in this and subsequent figures is thought to correspond to the migration of endogenous LIP because it coincides with migration of overexpressed mLIP. The pattern of migration of mLAP on IEF changes in several ways upon treatment of the cells with GH. Some bands that migrate closer to the acidic end (positive pole) increase in intensity over 15–60 min (Fig.1 B, lanes 2–4, bands b-e). Other bands that migrate toward the acidic end are induced (bands f andg) by 15–30 min after GH treatment. These more acidic bands may correspond to more phosphorylated forms of LAP, because upon alkaline phosphatase treatment of control 3T3-F442A nuclear extracts bands b, c, d, and e are reduced in intensity, shifting to band a (Fig. 1 B,lane 6 versus 5). The new band a close to the basic end (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3–4, band a) appears after 30–60 min of GH treatment. The GH-induced banda is thought to correspond to a less phosphorylated or dephosphorylated form of LAP. In support of this, band acomigrates with the band that appears upon alkaline phosphatase treatment of control extracts (Fig. 1 B, lane 6, band a), suggesting that band a corresponds to a dephosphorylated form of mLAP.

However, ER81 is not only phosphorylated on MAPK sites but also at other sites that impact on its transactivation potential. Here we describe that the 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1), a protein kinase downstream of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subclass of MAPKs, binds to ER81, phosphorylates it, and enhances ER81-dependent transcription. Two in vivo RSK1 phosphorylation sites within ER81, Ser191 and Ser216, were identified, whose mutation to alanine reduces ER81 activity upon ERK-MAPK stimulation. Furthermore, RSK1 activates the ER81 cofactor CREB-binding protein and may thereby augment ER81-dependent transcription. Similar to RSK1, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates ER81 on Ser191/Ser216. Additionally, PKA targets ER81 on Ser334 in vivo. Surprisingly, phosphorylation of Ser334 severely reduces the DNA-binding ability of ER81 but also enhances the transactivation potential of ER81. These counteractive effects of PKA phosphorylation on ER81-dependent transcription may cause the selective up-regulation of promoters with high but not low affinity for ER81. Collectively, we have identified mechanisms for how two distinct signaling pathways with different effector protein kinases, RSK1 and PKA, converge on ER81, which may regulate ER81 function during development and tumorigenesis.

In addition to its ETS domain, ER81 possesses three further functional domains, an N-terminal and a C-terminal transactivation domain as well as a central inhibitory domain that regulates both transactivation domains (5Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Gene transcription mediated by ER81 is strongly stimulated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs),1 which involves phosphorylation of ER81 at multiple sites (5Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 6Bosc D.G. Goueli B.S. Janknecht R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6215-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ER81 is stimulated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), although it is at present unknown whether ER81 is directly phosphorylated by PKA in vivo and how this may affect its ability to up-regulate gene transcription (7Coutte L. Monte D. Imai K. Pouilly L. Dewitte F. Vidaud M. Adamski J. Baert J.L. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6278-6286Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Expression of ER81 is both developmentally and tissue-specifically regulated. For instance, high levels ofER81 expression are detectable in the adult brain, heart, or lung, whereas very little is found in liver or skeletal muscle (1Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2502-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 8Monte D. Coutte L. Baert J.L. Angeli I. Stehelin D. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 771-779PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, ER81 expression is undetectable during early embryogenesis yet at later stages is observable at various sites in the embryo, including the central nervous system, eye, heart, lung, salivary gland, kidney, and pituitary gland (9Chotteau-Lelievre A.

Desbiens X. Mech. Dev. 2001; 108: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An ER81knock-out mouse revealed that the ER81 protein is required for the proper connection of sensory and motor neurons in the developing spinal cord, and its absence causes severe motor discoordination (11Arber S. Ladle D.R. Lin J.H. Frank E. Jessell T.M. Cell. 2000; 101: 485-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar).ER81 expression has also been noted in breast tissue, and a subset of breast cancer cell lines even overexpresses ER81. In addition, ER81 expression is up-regulated in mammaries of mice specifically overexpressing the HER2/Neuproto-oncogene in this organ (6Bosc D.G. Goueli B.S. Janknecht R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6215-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12Baert J.L. Monte D. Musgrove E.A. Albagli O. Sutherland R.L. de Launoit Y. Int. J.

Biochem. 2002; 86: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the ER81 protein may be involved in breast tumor formation. Indeed, ER81 is a downstream target of the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase HER2/Neu, whose overexpression in ∼30% of human breast cancers is correlated to a poor prognosis, and ER81 may thus execute the deleterious effects of HER2/Neu in breast as well as in ovarian, gastric, and lung cancer (6Bosc D.G. Goueli B.S. Janknecht R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6215-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Hung M.C. Lau Y.K. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 51-59PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hynes N.E. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ER81 has been shown to up-regulate transcription of two matrix metalloproteinase genes, interstitial collagenase andmatrilysin, which may contribute to the high metastatic potential of HER2/Neu-overexpressing cancer cells through an enhanced ability to remodel the extracellular matrix (6Bosc D.G. Goueli B.S. Janknecht R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6215-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar,17Crawford H.C. Fingleton B. Gustavson M.D. Kurpios N. Wagenaar R.A. Hassell J.A. Matrisian L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1370-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).HER2/Neu elicits phosphorylation of ER81 via MAPKs, but not all ER81 phosphorylation sites are directly targeted by MAPKs (6Bosc D.G. Goueli B.S. Janknecht R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6215-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that protein kinases downstream of MAPKs may also phosphorylate ER81. One protein kinase family downstream of the ERK subclass of MAPKs is the 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) family. This family of serine/threonine protein kinases includes three isoforms (RSK1, RSK2, RSK3), all of which are activated through direct phosphorylation by ERK-MAPKs. RSKs contain an N-terminal and a C-terminal kinase domain, which are separated by a linker region. The activation of RSKs is thought to be a complex process; ERK-MAPK, which is constitutively bound to the C terminus of RSKs, phosphorylates RSKs upon mitogenic stimulation at several sites, including the activation domain of their C-terminal kinase domain. Then the activated C-terminal kinase phosphorylates the RSK linker region, thereby generating a docking site for 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 that in turn phosphorylates the activation loop of the N-terminal kinase domain. This generates a fully activated RSK molecule, which then, at least in part, translocates to the cell nucleus (18Richards S.A. Dreisbach V.C. Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7470-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Frödin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 20Frödin M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27168-27176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). There, the RSK N-terminal kinase domain can phosphorylate and thus regulate transcription factors such as c-Fos, the cAMP-response element-binding protein, or the estrogen receptor (22Chen R.H. Abate C. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10952-10956Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 23Joel P.B. Smith J. Sturgill T.W. Fisher T.L. Blenis J. Lannigan D.A. Mol. Cell.

Kornhauser J.M. Xia Z. Thiele E.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1946-1955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, RSKs may impact on chromatin structure by inducing the phosphorylation of histone H3 (26Sassone-Corsi P. Mizzen C.A. Cheung P. Crosio C. Monaco L. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Allis C.D. Science. 1999; 285: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar).The N-terminal kinase domain of RSKs is closely related to the catalytic subunit of PKA. Accordingly, RSKs and PKA may phosphorylate and thereby regulate the same substrates, most notably demonstrated for the transcription factor cAMP- response element-binding protein and its phosphorylation on serine 133 (24Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 27Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). However, the signal transduction pathways leading to the activation of PKA are different from those activating RSKs. Briefly, PKA is activated by many neurotransmitters and hormones, which bind to G-protein-coupled transmembrane receptors. This in turn leads to the activation of an adenylyl cyclase and the production of cAMP. cAMP binds to the regulatory subunits of PKA, which then dissociate from and thereby lead to the activation of the catalytic PKA subunits and also enable them to translocate to the cell nucleus (28Daniel P.B. Walker W.H. Habener J.F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 353-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).In this report, we describe that ER81-dependent transcription can be regulated by RSK1 and PKA. Furthermore, we have uncovered mechanisms how these two protein kinases distinctively affect ER81 function.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have identified RSK1 as an ER81-associated protein kinase that phosphorylates ER81 and enhances the transactivation potential of both ER81 and its cofactors CBP/p300. Furthermore, we have uncovered PKA phosphorylation sites in ER81 and unraveled how this affects DNA binding as well as transactivation mediated by ER81.RSK1 and PKA are related serine/threonine protein kinases (19Frödin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Both kinases phosphorylate basophilic motifs, characterized by an arginine at position n-3 and an arginine or lysine at positionn-5 in the case of RSK1, and in the case of PKA by arginines at positions n-3 and n-2 with respect to the phosphorylated serine/threonine residue (39Leighton I.A. Dalby K.N. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 45Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, deviations from these strict consensus motifs have often been observed; in particular, many PKA sites have only one arginine at positionn-3, and the arginine/lysine residue at n-5 is not essential for RSK1 phosphorylation. As such, the ER81 amino acids Phe-Arg-Arg-Gln-Leu-Ser191, Tyr-Gln-Arg-Gln-Met-Ser216, and Tyr-Gln-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ser334 all conform to the minimal requirements for being both RSK1 and PKA phosphorylation sites. However, whereas RSK1 readily phosphorylates Ser191, Ser216, and Ser334 in vitro, it appears to only phosphorylate Ser191 and Ser216 in vivo, indicating that access to Ser334 is restricted in full-length ER81 in vivo. One potential reason for this could be ER81-interacting proteins, including CBP/p300 or RSK1 itself, which prevent the N-terminal kinase domain of RSK1 from phosphorylating Ser334. In contrast, maybe due to its smaller size, PKA has access to Ser334 and can phosphorylate Ser334 both in vitro and in vivo. Further, Ser334 is even more efficiently phosphorylated by PKA in vivo than Ser191 and Ser216, possibly because only Ser334 is part of an optimal PKA target site, Arg-Arg-Xaa-Ser (45Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Phosphorylation of ER81 solely confined to Ser191/Ser216 has been shown to inhibit ER81 function (32Papoutsopoulou S. Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7300-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), explaining why the S191A/S216A mutant is more active than the wild type upon PKA phosphorylation. However, when additional phosphorylation occurs at the MAPK sites (Ser94, Thr139, Thr143, and Ser146), phosphorylation of Ser191/Ser216 actually promotes ER81-dependent transcription (6Bosc D.G. Goueli B.S. Janknecht R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6215-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which is why the S191A/S216A mutant of ER81 is less active than the wild type in the presence of RSK1 and/or BXB. Consistent with RSKs' inability to phosphorylate Ser334 in vivo, mutation of Ser334 to alanine has no effect on the transactivation potential of ER81 upon stimulation of the ERK-MAPK pathway.In contrast to RSK1, PKA readily phosphorylates Ser334 in vivo, thereby reducing ER81's DNA binding activity; a similar reduction of DNA binding activity has been observed upon PKA phosphorylation of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 and the ER81-related protein ERM within their DNA-binding domains (46Baert J.L. Beaudoin C. Coutte L. de Launoit Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1002-1012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 47Viollet B. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4208-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Consequently, at low intracellular concentrations of ER81, promoter occupancy by the S334A mutant of ER81 is much higher than for wild-type ER81, resulting in more transcription with the S334A mutant than with wild-type ER81. However, we observed that this does not hold true at high intracellular concentrations of ER81. If the intracellular concentration of ER81 is very high, the law of mass action predicts that even ER81 phosphorylated on Ser334 will effect a high degree of promoter occupancy. Therefore, at high concentrations of ER81, the difference in the abilities of wild-type ER81 and of the S334A mutant to bind to DNA becomes functionally irrelevant. As such, one will observe only a difference in transactivation potential, and this is smaller for the S334A mutant than for wild-type ER81. Thus, phosphorylation of ER81 on Ser334 has a dual function: reducing the DNA-binding ability of ER81 but enhancing its transactivation potential.Normal intracellular ER81 concentrations will probably never be as high as achieved upon transfection of 1000 ng of ER81 expression plasmid as utilized in Fig. 10 A. Therefore, PKA phosphorylation will effectively block DNA binding of ER81 to low affinity sites under physiological conditions, yet at high affinity sites, this reduction in DNA binding affinity may still be irrelevant, as long as the intracellular concentration of ER81 significantly exceeds the dissociation constant (K d) for such sites. Thus, PKA phosphorylation at Ser334 may enforce that ER81 only stimulates transcription from gene promoters containing high affinity DNA-binding sites, a means to ensure specificity of gene activation.CBP and p300 are cofactors that are essential during development and important for the function of a plethora of transcription factors, including ER81 (32Papoutsopoulou S. Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7300-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 41Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar, 42Janknecht R. Histol. Histopathol. 2002; 17: 657-668PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that RSK1 can stimulate the transactivation potential of CBP/p300, thereby potentially affecting gene activation mediated by many different transcription factors. Similar to RSK1, PKA can also stimulate the transactivation potential of CBP/p300 (48Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar, 49Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R.

As such, RSK1 and PKA may not only regulate ER81-dependent transcription by direct phosphorylation of ER81 but also by affecting the cofactors CBP/p300; to answer the question of whether this involves direct phosphorylation of CBP/p300, future studies should be directed at the mapping and mutation of respective phosphorylation sites in CBP/p300. Another way how RSK, potentially in conjunction with the acetyltransferases CBP/p300, can facilitate ER81-dependent transcription is by inducing histone acetylation, thereby loosening up the chromatin structure (26Sassone-Corsi P. Mizzen C.A. Cheung P. Crosio C. Monaco L. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Allis C.D. Science. 1999; 285: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Interestingly, regulation of transcription factor activity may not be the sole effect of RSK1-mediated phosphorylation; phosphorylation of the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β by RSK1 has been reported to promote its association with procaspases 1 and 8, thereby inhibiting their activation in response to proapoptotic stimuli (50Buck M.

Thus, PKA may impact on ERK-MAPK-triggered, ER81-dependent transcription in several ways: by reducing ER81 DNA binding through Ser334 phosphorylation, by enhancing ER81 transactivation potential through Ser334phosphorylation, by acting in concert with RSK1 to phosphorylate Ser191/Ser216, and by either stimulating or inhibiting the ERK-MAPK signaling pathway. How these different mechanisms of action will integrate to a net effect on ER81-dependent transcription is probably cell type-specific. This shows a novel way how neurotransmitters and hormones that activate PKA may attenuate or enhance the response of ER81 target genes to ERK-MAPK-activating growth factors.ER81 is highly expressed in the brain and also in the spinal cord, where it is required for the proper establishment of contacts between sensory and motor neurons (1Brown T.A.

In neuronal cells, Ca2+ influx through ion channels is a prominent way of relaying signals and memory formation. Ca2+ influx can funnel into both the ERK-MAPK and the PKA signaling pathways (60Bading H. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 253: 912-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 61Chawla S.

Thereby, ER81 activity could be regulated by Ca2+ in neuronal cells, which may be important for neuronal function and development.ER81 has been implicated in the development of breast cancer, since it is a downstream target of HER2/Neu (6Bosc D.G. Goueli B.S. Janknecht R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6215-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a proto-oncoprotein known to be capable of inducing breast cancer (15Hung M.C. Lau Y.K. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 51-59PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hynes N.E. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar), and since ER81 expression is even up-regulated in HER2/Neu-overexpressing mammary tumors (13Shepherd T.G. Kockeritz L. Szrajber M.R. Muller W.J. Hassell J.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1739-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). HER2/Neu is a receptor tyrosine kinase that can activate the Ras → Raf → MEK1/2 → ERK-MAPK pathway and therefore also RSKs. As such, RSK phosphorylation of ER81 may contribute to breast tumor formation upon HER2/Neuoverexpression. Notably, ER81 may also be activated through RSKs in tumors characterized by oncogenic Ras mutations, one of the most commonly observed mutations in cancer cells. On the other hand, activation of PKA by cAMP may act either positively or negatively on cell proliferation (65Cho-Chung Y.S. Pepe S. Clair T. Budillon A. Nesterova M. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 21: 33-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells, for instance, the PKA stimulator oxytocin inhibits cell proliferation (66Cassoni P. Sapino A. Fortunati N. Munaron L. Chini B. Bussolati G. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that one reason for this could be the reduction of ER81 DNA binding activity induced by Ser334phosphorylation and accordingly the suppression of ER81 target gene activity.In conclusion, we have unraveled how two distinct signaling pathways, the growth factor-activated ERK-MAPK pathway and the neurotransmitter/hormone-activated PKA pathway, converge on the transcription factor ER81 and modulate its activity in a complex manner. This knowledge may help us to understand how ER81 functions during ontogenesis and carcinogenesis. The transcription factor ER81 belongs to the family of ETS proteins that are characterized by a conserved, ∼85-amino acid-long, DNA-binding ETS domain and perform many essential functions in homeostasis, signaling response, and development (1Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2502-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 2Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sharrocks A.D. Nat.

In addition to its ETS domain, ER81 possesses three further functional domains, an N-terminal and a C-terminal transactivation domain as well as a central inhibitory domain that regulates both transactivation domains (5Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Gene transcription mediated by ER81 is strongly stimulated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs),1 which involves phosphorylation of ER81 at multiple sites (5Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 6Bosc D.G. Goueli B.S. Janknecht R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6215-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ER81 is stimulated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), although it is at present unknown whether ER81 is directly phosphorylated by PKA in vivo and how this may affect its ability to up-regulate gene transcription (7Coutte L. Monte D. Imai K. Pouilly L. Dewitte F. Vidaud M. Adamski J. Baert J.L. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6278-6286Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Expression of ER81 is both developmentally and tissue-specifically regulated. For instance, high levels ofER81 expression are detectable in the adult brain, heart, or lung, whereas very little is found in liver or skeletal muscle (1Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2502-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 8Monte D. Coutte L. Baert J.L. Angeli I. Stehelin D. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 771-779PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, ER81 expression is undetectable during early embryogenesis yet at later stages is observable at various sites in the embryo, including the central nervous system, eye, heart, lung, salivary gland, kidney, and pituitary gland (9Chotteau-Lelievre A. Desbiens X. Pelczar H. Defossez P.A. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 937-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 10Chotteau-Lelievre A. Dolle P. Peronne V. Coutte L. de Launoit Y. Desbiens X. Mech. Dev. 2001; 108: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An ER81knock-out mouse revealed that the ER81 protein is required for the proper connection of sensory and motor neurons in the developing spinal cord, and its absence causes severe motor discoordination (11Arber S. Ladle D.R. Lin J.H. Frank E. Jessell T.M. Cell. 2000; 101: 485-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). ER81 expression has also been noted in breast tissue, and a subset of breast cancer cell lines even overexpresses ER81. In addition, ER81 expression is up-regulated in mammaries of mice specifically overexpressing the HER2/Neuproto-oncogene in this organ (6Bosc D.G. Goueli B.S. Janknecht R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6215-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12Baert J.L. Monte D. Musgrove E.A. Albagli O. Sutherland R.L. de Launoit Y. Int. J.

https://openalex.org/W2070468104,"Recently, we have shown that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in bovine rod outer segment (ROS) is activated in vitro by tyrosine phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of the insulin receptor (Rajala, R. V. S., and Anderson, R. E. (2001) Invest. Ophthal. Vis. Sci. 42, 3110–3117). In this study, we have investigated the in vivo mechanism of PI3K activation in the rodent retina and report the novel finding that light stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the β-subunit of the insulin receptor (IRβ) in ROS membranes, which leads to the association of PI3K enzyme activity with IRβ. Retinas from light- or dark-adapted mice and rats were homogenized and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against phosphotyrosine, IRβ, or the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, and PI3K activity was measured using PI-4,5-P2 as substrate. We observed a light-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of IRβ and an increase in PI3K enzyme activity in isolated ROS and in anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-IRβ immunoprecipitates of retinal homogenates. The light effect was localized to photoreceptor neurons and is independent of insulin secretion. Our results suggest that light induces tyrosine phosphorylation of IRβ in outer segment membranes, which leads to the binding of p85 through its N-terminal Src homology 2 domain and the generation of PI-3,4,5-P3. We suggest that the physiological role of this process may be to provide neuroprotection of the retina against light damage by activating proteins that protect against stress-induced apoptosis. Recently, we have shown that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in bovine rod outer segment (ROS) is activated in vitro by tyrosine phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of the insulin receptor (Rajala, R.

Src homology 2 and 3, respectively phosphoinositide 3-kinase glutathione S-transferase insulin receptor β subunit rod outer segment(s) immunoprecipitate 5-P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 4,5-P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate retinal pigment epithelium Many cell proliferation and cell survival pathways are initiated upon activation of tyrosine kinase receptors, which transduce their signals by recruiting a variety of cytoplasmic signaling proteins (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar, 2Pawson T. Nash P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047PubMed Google Scholar). Many of the signaling proteins contain phosphotyrosine binding domains, Src homology 2 (SH2)1 domains, and Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, which are involved in mediating protein-protein interactions (4Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 5McGlade C.J. Ellis C. Reedijk M. Anderson D. Mbamalu G. Reith A.D. Panayotou G. End P. Bernstein A. Kazlauskas A. Waterfield M.D. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 991-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction between different phosphotyrosine binding and SH2 domain-containing proteins with activated receptors initiates cellular changes that take place in response to a wide range of extracellular signals (2Pawson T. Nash P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047PubMed Google Scholar). One of the SH2 domain-containing proteins, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), consists of an ∼85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85) and a ∼110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110), the latter being responsible for the phosphorylation of phosphoinositides at the D3 position and of serine residues in proteins (7Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A.

Cell. 1991; 65: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The p85 subunit contains an SH3 domain capable of binding to proline-rich sequences, a p110 binding domain, and two SH2 domains. PI3K was initially found to be associated with middle-T/pp60c-Src (9Yoakim M. Hou W. Liu Y. Carpenter C.L. Kapeller R. Schaffhausen B.S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5485-5491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pp60v-Src, and platelet-derived growth factor receptors in both normal and transformed NIH3T3 fibroblast cells (10Whitman H. Downes C.P. Keeler M. Keller T. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1988; 332: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 11Williams L.T. Science. 1989; 243: 1564-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). PI3K activity increases in response to platelet-derived growth factor binding to its receptor, in large part because the p85-p110 complex is translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, by the direct binding of the p85 SH2 domain to tyrosine-phosphorylated sites on the receptor (12Hu P. Mondino A. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7677-7688Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 13Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1451-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). PI3K activity is also regulated by activated receptor-tyrosine kinase substrates such as the insulin receptor substrate-1 (5McGlade C.J. Ellis C. Reedijk M. Anderson D. Mbamalu G. Reith A.D. Panayotou G. End P. Bernstein A. Kazlauskas A. Waterfield M.D. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 991-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, substantial evidence exists suggesting that the Class I p85-p110 complex of PI3K is a common element of numerous signaling pathways involving a large number of tyrosine kinases (14Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 15Fry M.T. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. 1998; 14: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and that a variety of stimuli can trigger distinct and specific biological responses in different cell types. We have reported that bovine rod outer segments (ROS) contain a Class I p85-p110 enzyme complex that is more active in light-adapted retinasin vitro (17Guo X.X. Ghalayini A.J. Chen H.M. Anderson R.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 1873-1882PubMed Google Scholar) and can be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in these membranes (18Guo X.X. Huang Z. Bell M.W. Chen H. Anderson R.E. Mol. Vis. 2000; 6: 216-221PubMed Google Scholar). We have identified a mechanism for regulation of PI3K activity in bovine photoreceptor cells through tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor β-subunit (IRβ) in vitro (19Rajala R.V.S. Anderson R.E. Invest. Ophthal. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3110-3117PubMed Google Scholar). The activation is mediated through direct binding of the N-terminal SH2 domain of p85 subunit of PI3K to the tyrosine-phosphorylated C terminus of the insulin receptor (19Rajala R.V.S. Anderson R.E. Invest. Ophthal. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3110-3117PubMed Google Scholar). The role of light in PI3K activation in vivo has not been investigated, although we have found that light stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in rat ROSin vivo (20Ghalayini A.J. Guo X.X. Koutz C.A. Anderson R.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 66: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, in vivolight-dependent association of Src with ROS (21Ghalayini A.J.

Ghalayini A.J. Guo X.X. Alvarez K.M. Anderson R.E. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that light-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in ROS in vivo is involved in the regulation of PI3K activity in retina. Polyclonal antisera to the p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K, and α1- and α3-Na+-K+-ATPase were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal anti-IRβ and anti-Tyr(P) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-opsin antibody (Rho 4D2) was a gift from Dr. Robert Molday (University of British Columbia). Mouse anti-opsin was a gift of Dr. Colin Barnstable (Yale University).

[γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Echelon Research Laboratories Inc. (Salt Lake City, UT) providedd-myo-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI-4,5-P2). All other reagents were of analytical grade from Sigma. Albino Sprague-Dawley rats were dark-adapted overnight and sacrificed either under dim red light or following 30 min of light exposure (300 lux). ROS were prepared on a discontinuous sucrose gradient from either dark- or light-adapted retinas as previously described (23Organisciak D.T. Xie A. Wang H.M. Jiang Y.L. Darow R.M. Donoso L.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 503: 773-779Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with some minor modifications (21Ghalayini A.J. Desai N. Smith K.R. Holbrook R.M. Elliott M.H. Kawakatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1469-1476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Retinas were homogenized in 4.0 ml of 47% sucrose solution containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) (buffer A). Retinal homogenates were transferred to 15-ml centrifuge tubes and sequentially overlaid with 3.0 ml of 42%, 3.0 ml of 37%, and 4.0 ml of 32% sucrose dissolved in buffer A. The gradients were spun at 82,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The 32%/37% interfacial sucrose band containing ROS membranes was harvested; diluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm orthovanadate (buffer B); and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min. The ROS pellets were resuspended in buffer B and stored at −20 °C. The non-ROS band designated Band II (37%/42%) was also saved for comparison with ROS. All procedures were carried out under dim red light for dark-adapted retinas and in room light for light-adapted retinas. All protein concentrations were determined by the BCA reagent from Pierce, following the manufacturer's instructions. Fresh bovine eyes were obtained from a local abattoir and placed on ice and retinas were dissected within 2 h. ROS were prepared from fresh retinas on a continuous sucrose gradient (25–50%) as previously described (19Rajala R.V.S. Anderson R.E. Invest. Ophthal. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3110-3117PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE cells) were prepared according to the method described by Saariet al. (24Saari J.C. Bunt A.H. Futterman S. Berman E.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1977; 16: 797-806PubMed Google Scholar). Retinal lysates or ROS were solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C in a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 20 min, and the solubilized proteins were precleared by incubation with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C with mixing. The supernatant was incubated with either anti-p85α (1:300), anti-Tyr(P) (4 μg), or anti-IRβ (4 μg) antibodies overnight at 4 °C and subsequently with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed twice with modified solubilization buffer (the 1% Triton X-100 was reduced to 0.1%, and glycerol was removed) and once with phosphorylation buffer without ATP (19Rajala R.V.S. Anderson R.E. Invest. Ophthal. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3110-3117PubMed Google Scholar). Precipitates were assayed for PI3K activity or subjected to immunoblot analysis. Proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and the blots were washed two times for 10 min with TTBS (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin in TTBS overnight at 4 °C. Blots were then incubated with anti-p85α (1:4000), anti-IRβ (1:1000), or anti-Tyr(P) (1:1000) antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Following primary antibody incubations, immunoblots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (either anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, or anti-Goat IgG) and developed by ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions. Enzyme assays were carried out essentially as previously described (25Kaplan D.R Whitman M. Schaffhausen B. Pallas D.C. White M. Cantley L.C. Roberts T.M. Cell. 1987; 50: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Briefly, assays were performed directly on immunoprecipitates in 50 μl of the reaction mixture containing 0.2 mg/ml PI-4,5-P2, 50 μm ATP, 0.2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5). The reactions were carried out for 15 min at room temperature and stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 n HCl followed by 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (1/1, v/v). Lipids were extracted and resolved on oxalate-coated TLC plates (silica gel 60) with a solvent system of 1-propanol, 2m acetic acid (65/35, v/v). The plates were coated in 1% (w/v) potassium oxalate in 50% (v/v) and then baked in oven at 100 °C for 1 h prior to use. TLC plates were exposed to x-ray film overnight at −70 °C, and radioactive lipids were scraped and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. GST-p85 fusion proteins were generated by PCR amplification of the indicated p85α regions and cloned into pGEX2T (Amersham Biosciences). The amino acids of bovine p85α present in each fusion protein are N-SH2 (residues 314–446) and C-SH2 (residues 614–724), based on the sequence published by Otsu et al. (26Otsu M. Hiles I. Gout I.

The sequence of each clone was verified by DNA sequencing. All inductions yielded proteins of the expected size as judged by Coomassie staining. Pull-down experiments were carried out as described (19Rajala R.V.S. Anderson R.E. Invest. Ophthal. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3110-3117PubMed Google Scholar) using 5 μg of GST fusion proteins that had been adsorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B matrix. ROS from dark- and light-adapted rats were incubated with GST/GST-p85 fusion proteins at 4 °C for 1.5 h, with continuous mixing. The Sepharose beads were washed three times in 500 μl of HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 30–60 s at 4 °C. GST-p85 fusion proteins and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer 5 min prior to 10% SDS-PAGE. After the SDS-PAGE, the gels were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-IRβ antibody. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA), using a PTC 100 programmable thermal controller (MJ Research, Inc., Watertown, MA). The reaction mixture contained site-directed mutagenesis buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 100 mm KCl, 100 mmNH4SO4, 20 mm MgSO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin), 1 mm deoxynucleotide mix (dATP, dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP), 50 ng of GST-pGEX vector containing either p85 (N-SH2) or p85 (C-SH2) fusion proteins, and 125 ng of sense and antisense primers with mutations, in a total volume of 50 μl, followed by the addition of 2.5 units ofPfu DNA polymerase. The mutant primers were R358A (sense, ACC TTT TTG GTA GCA GAC GCA TCT ACT AAA; antisense, TTT AGT AGA TGC GTC TGC TAC CAA AAA GGT) and R649A (sense, ACT TTT CTT GTC GCG GAA AGC AGT AAA CAG; antisense, CTG TTT ACT GCT TTC CGC GAC AAG AAA AGT). The extension parameters of site-directed mutagenesis were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 16 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 12 min (2 min/kb of plasmid length). Following temperature cycling, the reaction was placed on ice for 2 min, after which 10 units ofDpnI restriction enzyme were added, mixed, and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Transformation was carried out using 1 μl of theDpnI-treated reaction to Epicurean XL-blue supercompetent cells, and the reaction was placed on LB/Amp (100 μl/ml) plates. The cDNAs of all mutants were sequenced after PCR; the only mutations observed were those intentionally introduced to create each desired mutation. The clones were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm), and the expressed fusion proteins were purified through GST-Sepharose 4B matrix. Albino Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 g) purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN) were maintained for at least 2 weeks in dim cyclic light (12 h on; 12 h off; 5–10 lux). A breeding colony of FVB/N mice is maintained in our vivarium in cyclic light (12 h on; 12 h off; ∼400 lux). Light absorption by rhodopsin activates transducin, a G-protein, which in turn promotes cGMP hydrolysis by cGMP-phosphodiesterase, leading to hyperpolarization of rod photoreceptor cells (27Roof D. Makino C.L. Principles and Practice of Ophthalmology. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2000Google Scholar). FVB/N mice are homozygous for the Pdebrd1 mutation (formally known as rd1) in the cGMP-phosphodiesterase β-subunit. As a result, these mice undergo rapid photoreceptor degeneration beginning at postnatal day 9 (28Sidman R.L. Green M.C. J. Hered. 1965; 56: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 29Bowes C., Li, T. Danciger M. Baxter L.C. Applebury M.L. Farber D.B.

The retinas from adult FVB/N mice completely lack photoreceptors. On the day of an experiment, rats or mice were dark-adapted overnight, and half were subjected to normal room light (∼300 lux) for 30 min. Eyes were enucleated, and the retinas were quickly removed and homogenized by hand in homogenizing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The retina lysates were either used directly or for the preparation of ROS. The retina lysate or ROS was immunoprecipitated with anti-IRβ antibody, followed by either Western blotting with anti-IRβ or anti-Tyr(P) antibodies or measuring the PI3K activity using PI-4,5-P2 as substrate. All animal work was in strict accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the protocols were approved by the IACUC of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center and the Dean A. McGee Eye Institute. The data were analyzed by Student'st test, and statistical significance was set atp < 0.05. Intact ROS, some containing blebs of inner segments attached through the connecting cilium, were prepared by mechanical detachment from freshly dissected bovine retinas, as a suspension in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma) buffered with 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) (32Muresan V. Joshi H.C. Besharse J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 1229-1237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After gentle homogenization by five passes through a Pasteur pipette, cell fragments in suspension were allowed to adsorb for 3 min to a VectbondTM (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA)-treated glass slide. Adhered cell fragments were fixed for 5 min in methanol at −20 °C and washed three times with PBS before processing for immunostaining. To detect IRβ in the dissociated photoreceptors, slides were incubated with a mixture of mouse anti-IRβ (GR36;Calbiochem) and rabbit-anti-transducin α (SC-389; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:1000 and 1:800, respectively, in PBS containing 10% horse serum. The transducin α antibody was included to clearly identify intact ROS. To determine whether the anti-IRβ was specific, an identical antibody mixture was incubated with a blocking IRβ peptide antigen (SC-711P; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 24 h at 4 °C before incubation on the isolated photoreceptors. To demonstrate that the blocking peptide was specific to IRβ, additional slides were incubated with an antibody mixture containing mouse anti-opsin, rabbit anti-transducin α, and the IRβ blocking peptide, diluted 1:100, 1:800, and 1:200, respectively. Antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C and then washed with PBS. For fluorescent detection, slides were incubated with a mixture of Texas Red-anti-mouse and fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-rabbit antibodies (Vector Laboratories), each diluted 1:200 in PBS with 10% horse serum. Following incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cover-slipped in 50% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline. Antibody-labeled complexes were examined on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope equipped with a digital camera, and images were captured using Metamorph (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA) image analysis software. For quantitation, all images were captured using identical microscope and camera setting, so that intensities of the digital images quantitatively reflect antibody binding. To determine whether light has an effect on PI3K activity and the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, rats were dark-adapted overnight, and half were subjected to normal room light for 30 min. Retinas were removed quickly and homogenized, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tyr(P) or anti-p85 antibodies. PI3K enzyme activity was higher in anti-Tyr(P) IPs from whole retinas (Fig.1 A) and ROS (Fig.1 B) from light-adapted (L) rats, compared with those from dark-adapted (D) animals. In contrast, only a marginal increase in PI3K activity was observed in anti-p85 IPs of light-adapted retinas over dark-adapted retinas (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that light may induce the translocation of PI3K from cytoplasm to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the disk membrane. When retinal homogenates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRβ antibodies, PI3K activity was more than 4-fold higher in IPs from light-adapted rats compared with those from dark-adapted animals (Fig. 2, D and E). Western blot analysis of anti-IRβ IPs probed with anti-IRβ antibody indicated an equal amount of IRβ in both light- and dark-adapted rat retinas (Fig. 2 A). However, anti-IRβ IPs probed with anti-Tyr(P) (Fig. 2 B) and anti-p85 (Fig. 2 C) antibodies showed almost 2-fold greater phosphorylation of IRβ (quantitative analysis of bands was carried out using Image software 1.62 (National Institutes of Health; available on the World Wide Web at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/download.html) in light-adapted rat retinas and binding of p85, respectively. These results demonstrate light-induced phosphorylation of the IRβ, as well as light-induced binding of p85 to the insulin receptor. ROS membranes that were prepared on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient showed a greater PI3K enzyme activity in light-adapted rats compared with dark-adapted rats (Fig.3 D). Western blot analysis indicated an increased amount of p85 in light-adapted ROS compared with dark-adapted ROS (Fig. 3 A). The photoreceptor-specific protein opsin was used as internal control and indicated that an equal amount of protein was used in these analyses (Fig. 3 C). Arrestin is known to move from the inner segment to outer segment in light (33McGinnis J.F. Matsumoto B. Whelan J.P. Cao W. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 67: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 34Whelan J.P. McGinnis J.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 20: 263-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and its accumulation in the ROS was a positive control to verify that the retinas responded to light in a predictable manner (Fig. 3 B). These in vivo studies demonstrate the light-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRβ and the subsequent association of PI3K in ROS. Rats were dark-adapted overnight, and half were subjected to normal room light for 30 min. Retinas were quickly removed and homogenized, and ROS were prepared by discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Solubilized light- and dark-adapted rat ROS were incubated with GST-p85 (N-SH2) or mutant p85 (N-SH2, R358A) fusion proteins and subjected to GST pull-down assays. The bound proteins were run on 8% SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-IRβ antibodies. IRβ did not bind to the GST controls (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2) but did bind to the GST-p85 (N-SH2) fusion protein. Quantitatively, more IRβ was pulled down from light-adapted ROS than from dark-adapted ROS (lanes 3 and 4). Mutating Arg-358 in p85 to Ala-358 abolished all binding (lanes 5 and 6), demonstrating the requirement for the native N-SH2 motif. Western blots of the ROS preparations using the anti-IRβ antibody showed the presence of the insulin receptor in the membranes (lanes 7 and 8). Since p85 only interacts with phosphorylated IRβ, these results further confirm the light-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRβ in vivo. Since our previous studies had shown that C terminus SH2 and its mutant version (R649A) did not interact with bovine retinal IRβ in vitro(19Rajala R.V.S. Anderson R.E. Invest. Ophthal. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3110-3117PubMed Google Scholar), we did not test these fusion proteins in vivo. To assess the role of insulin in retinal IRβ phosphorylation, we measured IRβ activation in rats that were made insulin-deficient by the injection of streptozotocin. The state of diabetes was confirmed by measuring blood glucose levels (35Tabatabaie T. Waldon A.M. Jacob J.M. Floyd R.A. Kotake Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Retinas were removed from hyperglycemic (insulin-deficient animals) and control animals in normal room light. Samples were lysed in homogenizing buffer and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-IRβ antibody. PI3K activity and the phosphorylation of IRβ were examined in the IPs. There was no difference in the PI3K activity (Fig.5 B) or the degree of IRβ phosphorylation (Fig. 5 A) in control and insulin-deficient rats. These studies suggest that whereas insulin may be sufficient to activate insulin receptors in isolated ROS in vitro (19Rajala R.V.S. Anderson R.E. Invest. Ophthal. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3110-3117PubMed Google Scholar, 36Waldbillig R.J. Fletcher R.T. Chader G.J. Rajagopalan S. Rodrigues M. LeRoith D. Exp.

Eye Res. 1987; 45: 823-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it may not be required for the light-dependent activation of IRβ in vivo. We verified the presence of the insulin receptor in ROS by several approaches, to eliminate the possibility that our ROS preparations were contaminated with inner segment or RPE membranes. RPE cells were obtained from fresh bovine eyes, and ROS and Band II retinal membranes were prepared from light-adapted rat retinas by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation. Western blots of the three preparations were probed with two marker enzymes, the α1 and α3 isoforms of Na+-K+-ATPase. The α1 isoform is mainly present in RPE cells, whereas α3 is mainly found in inner segments; neither is present in ROS (38Wetzel R.K. Arystarkhova E. Sweadner K.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9878-9889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, the α1 isoform was present in RPE (lane 1) and Band II (lane 3) but not in the ROS fraction (lane 2). The α3 isoform was absent from RPE (lane 1) and rat ROS (lane 2) but was present in Band II from rat retina (lane 3). Similar blots probed with the anti-IRβ antibody indicated the presence of insulin receptors in all fractions (Fig. 6). To further demonstrate that insulin receptors are present in photoreceptor outer segments, we immunolabeled bovine ROS (containing some attached inner segment) with an anti-IRβ antibody. Immunostaining was found in both outer and inner segments (Fig.7 A). Inclusion of the IRβ-blocking peptide inhibited"

Although the production of H2S is regulated by Ca2+ and calmodulin in response to neuronal excitation, little is known about the molecular mechanism for the regulation in CBS activity. Here we show that four cysteine residues of CBS are involved in the regulation of its activity in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a modifying agent for cysteine residues, enhances CBS activity, whereasN-ethylmaleimide, an alkylating agent for cysteine residues, completely abolished the effect of SNP. Site-directed mutagenesis of the 13 cysteine residues of CBS identified four cysteine residues that are involved in the regulation of CBS activity by SNP, and two of the four residues are involved in the regulation of the basal CBS activity. The enhancement of CBS activity by SNP is independent of nitric oxide production. In the presence ofStaphylococcus aureus α-hemolysin, which permeabilizes the cell membrane, exogenously applied SNP enhances the activity of CBS in intact cells. The present study demonstrates a novel mechanism for the regulation of CBS activity and provides a possible therapeutic application of SNP for the diseases in which CBS activity is deficient.

Endogenous H2S in the brain is produced froml-cysteine by the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzyme, cystathionine β-synthase (CBS)1 (4Stipanuk M.H. Beck P.W. Biochem.

CBS is expressed in the brain, and a CBS activator,S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), enhances H2S production (6Abe K. Kimura H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations, together with our recent finding that endogenous H2S is under detectable levels in the brains of CBS knock-out mice, indicate that CBS is a major H2S-producing enzyme in the brain (7Eto K. Ogasawara M. Umemura K. Nagai Y. Kimura H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The production of H2S is regulated by a Ca2+- and calmodulin-mediated pathway that is activated in response to neuronal excitation (7Eto K. Ogasawara M. Umemura K. Nagai Y. Kimura H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Physiological concentrations of H2S specifically potentiate the activity of theN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and hippocampal long term potentiation is altered in CBS knock-out mice (6Abe K. Kimura H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,7Eto K. Ogasawara M. Umemura K. Nagai Y. Kimura H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H2S can regulate the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus (8Russo C.D. Tringali G. Ragazzoni E. Maggiano N. Menini E. Vairano M. Preziosi P. Navarra P. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 12: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition to the function in the brain H2S relaxes smooth muscle in synergy with nitric oxide (NO) by activating ATP-dependent potassium channels (9Hosoki R. Matsuki N. Kimura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 237: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 10Zhao W. Zhang J., Lu Y. Wang R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6008-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar). Based upon these observations it has been proposed that H2S may function as a neuromodulator, as well as a smooth muscle relaxant (6Abe K. Kimura H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hosoki R. Matsuki N. Kimura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 237: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), which is well known as an NO donor, activates guanylyl cyclase and relaxes smooth muscle (11Gruetter C.A. Gruetter D.Y. Lyon J.E. Kadowitz P.J. Ignarro L.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1981; 219: 181-186PubMed Google Scholar, 12Knowles R.G. Palacios M. Palmer R.M.J. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). SNP has also been used to detect cysteine, cystine, acetophenone, and sulfite in a reaction known as the Legal and Boedeker reaction, as well as secondary amines (13Van Rheenen D.L. Sipman C.B. J. Chromatogr. 1968; 37: 341-342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Georges R.J. Politzer W.M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1970; 30: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 15Leeuwenkamp O.R. Vermaat C.H.

The reactivity of SNP on cysteine residues modifies biological activity of proteins in an NO-independent manner. For example, SNP modifies NMDA receptors, whereas other NO donors,S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) andS-nitroso-l-glutathione do not (16Ogita K. Shuto M. Yoneda Y. Neurochem. Int. 1998; 33: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). SNP evokes the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P, but ferricyanide, a substance related structurally to SNP, also evokes the release of CGRP and substance P (17Garry M.G. Richardson J.D. Hargreaves K.M. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4329-4337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of CBS has two metabolic outcomes (2Warenycia M.W. Goodwin L.R. Benishin C.G.

In addition to the production of H2S CBS catalyzes the reaction with the substrate homocysteine to produce cystathionine (4Stipanuk M.H. Beck P.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar,18Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Skovby F. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease.

Loss of CBS activity causes homocystinuria, an autosomal recessive disease characterized by mental retardation, skeletal abnormalities, and vascular disorders with severe thromboembolic complications (18Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Skovby F. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1989: 693-734Google Scholar). Over 50 different missense mutations in CBS gene have been found in patients of homocystinuria (20Kraus J.P. Janosik M. Kozich V. Mandell R. Shih V. Sperandeo M.P. Sebastio G. Franchis R. Andria G.

Pyridoxine (vitamin B6), the precursor of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, has been tried for the therapy of homocystinuria (21Hu F.L., Gu, Z. Kozich V. Kraus J.P. Ramesh V. Shih V.E. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1993; 2: 1857-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Some patients respond to pyridoxine, whereas the remaining patients are non-responsive (22Shih V.E. Fringer J.M. Mandell R. Kraus J.P. Berry G.T. Heidenreich R.A. Korson M.S. Levy H.L. Ramesh V. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 34-39PubMed Google Scholar). A development of a new substance that enhances the activity of CBS has been needed for therapy. The present study shows that SNP enhances the activity of CBS and suggests that SNP may be useful for diseases in which CBS activity is deficient. SNP, SNAP, 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), potassium ferricyanide, sodium ferrocyanide, and NEM were purchased from Sigma. All the other chemicals were from Wako (Japan). Rats (Jcl; Sprague-Dawley) were purchased from Clea (Japan). Thirteen single point mutations, which substitute serine for cysteine, were introduced by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene) using rat CBS cDNA inserted in pME18s expression vector (DNAX Research Institute, Inc.) as a template. The sequence of each mutant was confirmed by sequencing. The carboxy-terminal truncation mutant of CBS (1–396) was described previously (7Eto K. Ogasawara M. Umemura K. Nagai Y. Kimura H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transferred into 100-mm dishes 12 h before transfection. Immediately before the transfection, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum was changed to serum-reduced medium (OPTI-MEM; Invitrogen), and cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNAs using 60 μg of LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) in 6.4 ml of medium for 5 h. After 48 h the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at 4 °C for 30 min with 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was assayed for CBS activity. The relative amount of CBS was measured by Western blot analysis using an antibody against CBS following SDS-7.5% PAGE. Rat brains were homogenized with a Teflon potter in lysis buffer followed by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min. The assay for the H2S-producing activity of CBS was performed as described previously (7Eto K. Ogasawara M. Umemura K. Nagai Y. Kimura H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 33 μg of brain extracts or 3 μg of COS-7 cell extracts was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 100 μl of a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.6), 2 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, and 1 mml-cysteine in the presence of 0.6 mm CaCl2 and 9.6 μm calmodulin, and the tubes were filled with N2 gas. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 100% trichloroacetic acid. H2S was measured by gas chromatography (Shimadzu, GC-14B gas chromatograph). To determine the cystathionine-producing activity of CBS (23Taoka S. Ohja S. Shan X. Kruger W.D. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25179-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), 66 μg of brain extract was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 200 μl of a reaction mixture containing 250 mm Tris (pH 8.6), 2 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, 30 mml-serine, and 15 mml-homocysteine in the presence or absence of 0.6 mm CaCl2 and 9.6 μm calmodulin. After the reaction was terminated by the addition of a mixture of water-saturated phenol and chloroform (1:1), cystathionine was extracted. The amounts of cystathionine were measured by HPLC as described previously (7Eto K. Ogasawara M. Umemura K. Nagai Y. Kimura H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A published method was used for the permeabilization of cells (24Fink D. Contreras M.L. Leikes P.I. Lazarovici P. Cell. Signal. 1989; 1: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA and equilibrated in suspension in a Ca2+-free basic salt solution (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 11 mm glucose, 0.75% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h. Cells were permeabilized by the addition of Staphylococcus aureus α-hemolysin, with an effective concentration of 50 or 100 units/106 cells/100 μl of Ca2+-free basic salt solution at 37 °C for 5 min. The permeabilized cells (106 cells/100 μl) were exposed to SNP at 37 °C for 5 min in the presence or absence of 2 mm Ca2+ and then sonicated after adding 2 μl of 10 m NaOH to terminate the reaction. The lysates were used to measure endogenous H2S by gas chromatography (7Eto K. Ogasawara M. Umemura K. Nagai Y. Kimura H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and for Western blot analysis using an antibody against CBS. Western blot analysis was performed according to the standard protocol described previously using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig antibody (AmershamBiosciences) as a secondary antibody and a chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for detection (7Eto K. Ogasawara M. Umemura K. Nagai Y. Kimura H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated by Coomassie dye binding (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. NO binds to the heme of CBS in reducing conditions and inhibits its enzymatic activity (25Taoka S. Banerjee R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2001; 87: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Because Ca2+ and calmodulin regulate CBS activity, the effect of NO on CBS activity in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin was examined (7Eto K. Ogasawara M. Umemura K. Nagai Y. Kimura H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was asked whether the NO donors, SNP, SIN-1, and SNAP (Fig. 1 A) modify the H2S-producing activity of CBS in cell lysates. Initially the effect of NO donors on CBS activity in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin was examined in the standard non-reducing conditions (7Eto K. Ogasawara M. Umemura K. Nagai Y. Kimura H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin, 300 μm SNP increases the production of H2S 3-fold (410 ± 42 pmol H2S/mg protein/min,n = 3) over control (139 ± 7 pmol H2S/mg protein/min, n = 3) (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the enhancing effect of SNP is not observed in the absence of Ca2+ and calmodulin. The other NO donors, SIN-1 and SNAP, do not have any effect on the H2S-producing activity of CBS, even though they release NO (data not shown) (Fig. 1 B). Compounds related structurally to SNP, ferricyanide and ferrocyanide, also have no effect on CBS activity (Fig. 1, A andB). These observations suggest that only SNP enhances H2S-producing activity of CBS and that this effect of SNP is independent of NO. The dose-response curve of SNP was examined by measuring the production of H2S. The enhancing effect of SNP on H2S production is increased in a dose-dependent manner and reaches the maximum level at 300 μm (Fig. 1 C). The enhancing effect is decreased at concentrations greater than 300 μm. Neither SIN-1 nor SNAP has any effect on CBS activity in the range of concentrations tested (Fig. 1 C). The enzymatic activity of CBS has two metabolic outcomes (2Warenycia M.W. Goodwin L.R. Benishin C.G. Reiffenstein R.J. Francom D.M. Taylor J.D. Dieken F.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 18Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Skovby F. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1989: 693-734Google Scholar). In addition to the production of H2S from cysteine, CBS catalyzes the reaction with substrate homocysteine to produce cystathionine. To examine whether SNP also enhances the cystathionine-producing activity of CBS, the effect of SNP on the production of cystathionine was measured in the presence or absence of Ca2+ and calmodulin. 300 μm SNP enhances the production of cystathionine 4-fold more greatly in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin (1400 ± 70 pmol cystathionine/mg protein/min, n = 3) than in the absence of Ca2+ and calmodulin (260 ± 10 pmol cystathionine/mg protein/min, n = 3) (Fig.2 A). In the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin 300 μm SNP enhances the production of cystathionine 2.4-fold more greatly than that without SNP (590 ± 98 pmol cystathionine/mg protein/min, n = 3). SIN-1, SNAP, ferricyanide, or ferrocyanide did not enhance the production of cystathionine (Fig. 2 A). The dose-response curve of SNP was also examined by measuring the production of cystathionine. The enhancing effect of SNP on cystathionine production is increased in a dose-dependent manner up to 800 μm (Fig. 2 B). Neither SIN-1 nor SNAP has any effect on CBS activity in the range of concentrations tested (Fig.2 B). These observations indicate that SNP enhances both the H2S- and cystathionine-producing activities of CBS, although the concentrations for the maximal responses are different between both pathways. Because the enhancement of CBS activity by SNP requires Ca2+ and calmodulin, there are two possible targets for SNP. One possibility is that SNP interacts with calmodulin and modifies the CBS activity. Alternatively, SNP interacts with CBS and enhances its activity. To address this problem the effect of SNP on a mutant form of CBS (1–396), which lacks the calmodulin binding domain but is constitutively active without calmodulin, was examined (7Eto K. Ogasawara M. Umemura K. Nagai Y. Kimura H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of the mutant CBS (1–396) in the absence of Ca2+and calmodulin was enhanced further by the application of 300 μm SNP (8565 + 1245 pmol H2S/mg protein/min,n = 3) to a level similar to that of the wild-type CBS in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin (8227 ± 50 pmol H2S/mg protein/min, n = 3) (Fig.3). These observations indicate that SNP does not interact with calmodulin to enhance CBS activity. Because SNP reacts with the thiol groups of sulfur-containing amino acids, especially cysteine (14Georges R.J. Politzer W.M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1970; 30: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), it is possible that the enhancement of CBS activity by SNP is induced by modifying the cysteine residues of CBS. To examine this possibility the effect of NEM, which alkylates thiol of cysteine residues, on the enhancement of CBS activity by SNP was investigated by measuring the production of H2S in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin. The enhancement of CBS activity by SNP (368.4 ± 13.7 pmol H2S/mg protein/min,n = 3) was suppressed by NEM in a dose-dependent manner, and 1 mm NEM completely suppressed the effect of SNP (119.7 ± 2.5 pmol H2S/mg protein/min, n = 3) (Fig.4, A and B). The basal CBS activity, however, was not changed by NEM (Fig.4 A). These observations suggest that NEM masks cysteine residues to hinder SNP from interacting with cysteine residues to suppress the enhancing effect of SNP on CBS activity. To identify cysteine residues of CBS that interact with SNP, the effect of SNP on 13 CBS mutants was examined. Each of the 13 cysteine residues of CBS was replaced with serine residue by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutants were expressed in COS-7 cells, and the expression levels of each mutant were examined by Western blot analysis (Fig.4 C). There were no significant differences in the expression levels of each mutant, and endogenous CBS in COS-7 cells was under the detectable level (Fig. 4 C). The enhancement of CBS activity by SNP was then examined by measuring the amounts of H2S produced by each CBS mutant. CBS activity enhanced by SNP was suppressed in C49S, C162S, C367S, and C476S mutants by 37, 33, 33, and 30% of the wild-type CBS, respectively (Fig.4 C). All the mutants, however, show similar basal H2S-producing activity to the wild-type CBS in the absence of SNP (Fig. 4 C). These observations suggest that at least four cysteine residues in CBS are involved in the modification by SNP to enhance CBS activity. Loss of CBS activity causes homocystinuria (18Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Skovby F. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1989: 693-734Google Scholar). Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) has been used for therapeutic trials of homocystinuria and has improved some cases, but the remaining patients are not pyridoxine-responsive (21Hu F.L., Gu, Z. Kozich V. Kraus J.P. Ramesh V. Shih V.E. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1993; 2: 1857-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 22Shih V.E. Fringer J.M. Mandell R. Kraus J.P. Berry G.T. Heidenreich R.A. Korson M.S. Levy H.L. Ramesh V. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 34-39PubMed Google Scholar). Because SNP enhances CBS activity, SNP can possibly be used for therapeutic purposes. As an NO donor SNP can be applied outside of the cells, but as a cysteine residue-modifying agent SNP must enter into the cells to interact with CBS. To examine the effect of exogenously applied SNP on CBS activity in intact cells, H2S production from cells expressing CBS was measured. S. aureus α-hemolysin, which makes pores with ∼2 nm diameter in the plasma membrane without the loss of intracellular proteins (24Fink D. Contreras M.L. Leikes P.I. Lazarovici P. Cell. Signal. 1989; 1: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), was used to introduce SNP into the cells. H2S production was ∼3-fold greater in cells incubated with SNP and 50 units of α-hemolysin (67.3 ± 6.5 nmol/106 cells, n = 3) greater than that in cells without the application of SNP (20.4 ± 2.0 nmol/106cells, n = 3) (Fig.5 A). SNP enhances CBS activity most effectively at 1 μm (Fig. 5 A). 50 units of α-hemolysin alone also induced Ca2+ influx and increased the production of H2S. This is probably because of the activation of CBS by increased intracellular Ca2+interacting with endogenous calmodulin (Fig. 5 A) and is consistent with our previous finding that H2S production is increased in the presence of Ca2+ ionophore A23187(7Eto K. Ogasawara M. Umemura K. Nagai Y. Kimura H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations show that SNP enhances Ca2+-dependent CBS activity in the presence of α-hemolysin in intact cells. To confirm the results obtained in vitro that the four cysteine residues are involved in the regulation of CBS activity by SNP, the endogenous H2S levels of cells that transiently express the four CBS mutants were measured. In the presence of α-hemolysin the application of SNP to cells expressing CBS mutant C49S, C476S, C162S, or C367S decreased the endogenous H2S levels by 61 (26.5 ± 5.0 nmol/106 cells, n= 3), 69 (20.9 ± 5.6 nmol/106 cells, n = 3), 96 (2.8 ± 0.5 nmol/106 cells), or 90% (6.4 ± 0.2 nmol/106 cells) of the wild-type CBS (67.3 ± 6.5 nmol/106 cells), respectively. These observations confirmed the result of the in vitro assay and indicate that the exogenously applied SNP enters into the cells in the presence of α-hemolysin and enhances the CBS activity by modifying the cysteine residues. The basal endogenous H2S levels in cells expressing C49S and C476S mutants were similar to those in cells expressing the wild-type CBS, whereas the basal H2S levels in cells expressing C162S and C367S mutants were much less than those in cells expressing the wild-type CBS (Fig. 5 B). The present study demonstrates that SNP enhances the H2S-producing activity of CBS by modifying cysteine residues of CBS via an NO-independent mechanism. This effect of SNP requires Ca2+ and calmodulin, but SNP does not interact directly with calmodulin (Fig. 3). We proposed recently a possible mechanism for the potentiation of the H2S-producing activity of CBS by Ca2+ and calmodulin that is similar to that proposed for the potentiation of CBS by AdoMet (7Eto K. Ogasawara M. Umemura K. Nagai Y. Kimura H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Shan X. Dunbrack R.L.J. Christopher S.A. Kruger W.D. Human Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 635-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this model the carboxy-terminal domain covers the catalytic domain of CBS in the absence of Ca2+ and calmodulin in the basal state. When Ca2+/calmodulin binds to the calmodulin binding consensus sequence, the catalytic domain is exposed by opening of the carboxy-terminal domain, and CBS becomes active (7Eto K. Ogasawara M. Umemura K. Nagai Y. Kimura H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taking this model into account, it is possible that SNP may not be able to access cysteine residues in the wild-type CBS in the absence of Ca2+ and calmodulin. This model is also supported by our observation that the CBS mutant (1–396), which lacks the carboxy-terminal domain to hinder the access of SNP, is activated further by SNP (Fig. 3). Under reducing conditions NO interacts with the heme group, and the CBS activity is reduced. However, the inhibition of CBS activity by NO is not observed in standard non-reducing conditions that were used in the present study (see also Refs. 23Taoka S. Ohja S. Shan X. Kruger W.D. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25179-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar and 25Taoka S. Banerjee R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2001; 87: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition to our observations, there are several examples in which SNP exerts its effects independently of NO. The release of CGRP and substance P from dorsal horn is evoked by SNP (17Garry M.G. Richardson J.D. Hargreaves K.M. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4329-4337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The release is also induced by photoinactivated SNP, as well as ferricyanide, which is structurally similar to SNP except that it lacks the coordinated NO, suggesting that its three-dimensional structure is necessary to evoke the release of CGRP and substance P. The binding of MK-801, an agonist of NMDA receptors, to NMDA receptors is inhibited by SNP and ferrocyanide but not by other NO donors such as SNAP andS-nitroso-l-glutathione (16Ogita K. Shuto M. Yoneda Y. Neurochem. Int. 1998; 33: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In contrast to the above data, the enhancing effect of SNP on CBS activity is not induced by ferricyanide or ferrocyanide (Fig. 1). These observations suggest that the coordinated NO of SNP may bind to the cysteine residues of CBS, and the remaining part of SNP may change the three-dimensional structure of CBS and modify CBS activity. Although both NEM and SNP modify cysteine residues, the specificity and the effect of modification is apparently different. NEM alkylates all cysteine residues, whereas SNP specifically modifies in a functional manner only four cysteine residues of CBS, Cys-49, Cys-162, Cys-367, and Cys-476 (Fig. 4). SNP enhances CBS activity, whereas NEM does not have any effect on basal CBS activity. Of the four cysteine residues modified by SNP, Cys-162 and Cys-367 in rat CBS correspond to Cys-165 and Cys-370 in human CBS, respectively, and both cysteine residues are changed to tyrosine by the mutations found in homocystineurea patients (20Kraus J.P. Janosik M. Kozich V. Mandell R. Shih V. Sperandeo M.P. Sebastio G. Franchis R. Andria G. Kluijtmans L.A.J. Blom H. Goers G.H.J. Gordon R.B. Kamoun P. Tsai M.Y. Kruger W.D. Koch H.G. Ohura T. Gaustadnes M. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 13: 362-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Mutants Cys-49 and Cys-476 have basal CBS activity similar to the wild-type CBS, whereas mutants Cys-162 and Cys-367 have a much lower basal CBS activity (Fig. 5). The human C52S mutant shows a reduced basal cystathionine-producing activity (27Ojha S., Wu, J. LoBrutto R. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4649-4654Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas the corresponding rat C49S has an H2S-producing activity similar to the wild-type CBS for H2S production (Fig. 4 C). This discrepancy may be because the present study was performed in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin, and H2S production was assayed rather than cystathionine production. In addition, to measure the amount of H2S, the enzyme assay was performed in anaerobic conditions in which the CBS activity is enhanced relative to the aerobic conditions (23Taoka S. Ohja S. Shan X. Kruger W.D. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25179-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The CBS activity is reduced severely in homocystinuria (21Hu F.L., Gu, Z. Kozich V. Kraus J.P. Ramesh V. Shih V.E. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1993; 2: 1857-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although the two mutants at Cys-162 and Cys-367 do not respond to SNP, approximately 50 other mutants have the intact cysteine residues and can respond to SNP (20Kraus J.P. Janosik M. Kozich V. Mandell R. Shih V. Sperandeo M.P. Sebastio G. Franchis R. Andria G. Kluijtmans L.A.J. Blom H. Goers G.H.J. Gordon R.B. Kamoun P. Tsai M.Y. Kruger W.D. Koch H.G. Ohura T. Gaustadnes M. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 13: 362-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that there may be an endogenous substance that interacts with Cys-162 or Cys-367 to regulate CBS activity and that both CBS mutants found in homocystinuria patients can not function properly because of a lack of the interaction with the possible endogenous regulator. Enhancement of CBS activity in vitro requires 300 μm SNP, whereas in intact cells the maximal effect is obtained at 1 μm (see Fig.1 C and Fig. 5 A). The difference of the potency of SNP between in vitro and in intact cells may be because thein vitro experiments was performed in the presence of 1 mm free cysteine, which compete with cysteine residues of CBS, whereas there is much less endogenous cysteine in intact cells. Alternatively, there may be a synergy between SNP and the endogenous regulator to enhance the CBS activity in intact cells. The requirement of the much lower dosage in vivo, however, may be an advantage for therapeutic applications. Another possible example of the disease in which the CBS activity may be deficient is Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma levels of homocysteine, which is a substrate for CBS to produce cystathionine, is high in AD patients (28Clarke R. Smith D. Jobst K.A. Fefsum H. Sutton L. Ueland P.M. Arch. Neurol. 1998; 55: 1449-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar), and the level of AdoMet, a CBS activator, is low in AD brains (29Morrison L.D. Smith D.D. Kish S.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 30Eto K. Asada T. Arima K. Makifuchi T. Kimura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2002; 293: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). AdoMet improves cognitive decline in patients with AD (31Bottiglieri T. Hyland K. Reynolds E.H. Drugs. 1994; 48: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Despite these observations little attention has been paid to CBS activity in AD. We have shown recently that brain H2S levels and CBS activities are decreased severely in AD patients (30Eto K. Asada T. Arima K. Makifuchi T. Kimura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2002; 293: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The present observations may provide a new approach for the therapy for these diseases in which CBS activity is deficient.

These included genes involved in adhesion, transcription, transport, and proliferation. The expression of mRNA encoding heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), a potent mitogen, was markedly increased by IGF-1R but not IR activation. This effect was dependent on MAPK, but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and did not require an autocrine loop through the epidermal growth factor receptor.

Both use similar signaling mechanisms, but in vivo the IGF-1R is associated with a more “mitogenic” response, whereas the IR is associated with a more “metabolic” response. This is graphically illustrated by the fact that mice in which the IR has been deleted transgenically are born of normal size but develop severe diabetes and fatal ketoacidosis shortly after birth (1Accili D.

Whereas tissue-specific expression could contribute to the differential biological functions of these receptors, both receptors actually show quite widespread expression, and thus it appears likely that at least some of the in vivo specificity relates to differential signaling properties of the receptors. Most previous studies examining this issue have compared cells overexpressing the IR with those expressing the IGF-1R or have used IR/IGF-1R chimeras. The majority of these studies indicate that activation of the IGF-1R is more mitogenic than the IR (4Lammers R. Gray A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A.

However, there are several problems associated with the use of these systems, including the formation of hybrid IR/IGF-1Rs and cross-reactivity (ligand binding to non-cognate endogenous receptors, which is likely to occur at the concentrations usually used in ex vivoexperiments), all of which may obscure any signaling specificity. In an attempt to overcome these problems, we have generated TrkC receptor chimeras, consisting of the extracellular domain of the TrkC receptor fused to the intracellular domain of the IR or the IGF-1R (9Kalloo-Hosein H.E. Whitehead J.P. Soos M. Tavaré J.M. Siddle K. O'Rahilly S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24325-24332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Expression of these receptors in cells without endogenous TrkC receptors allows specific stimulation of the receptors by neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) without any background signaling, hybrid formation, or non-cognate ligand binding. As the extracellular domains of the two chimeras are identical, any signaling differences observed are purely due to differences in the intracellular domains of the IRversus IGF-1R. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stably expressing these chimeras, we have reported previously (9Kalloo-Hosein H.E. Whitehead J.P. Soos M. Tavaré J.M. Siddle K. O'Rahilly S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24325-24332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that the intracellular domain of the IR couples more effectively to glycogen synthesis than the intracellular domain of the IGF-1R, whereas both appear to couple equally to DNA synthesis. The two receptors also appear to be equally efficient in protecting fibroblasts and adipocytes against apoptosis (10Urso B. Niesler C.U. O'Rahilly S. Siddle K. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the IR chimera (TIR) stimulated GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake to a greater extent than the IGF-1R chimera (TIGR). Differences were also seen in signaling immediately downstream of the receptors in adipocytes, with the IRS-1 signaling pathway being more effectively stimulated by the TIR chimera, and the Shc/MAPK signaling pathway being more stimulated by the TIGR chimera (11Urso B. Cope D.L. Kalloo-Hosein H.E. Hayward A.C. Whitehead J.P. O'Rahilly S. Siddle K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30864-30873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that intrinsic signaling differences between the two receptors do exist and are at least in part attributable to sequence differences in the intracellular domains of the IR and IGF-1R. In order to elucidate further the reasons for the different effects of insulin and IGF-1, we chose to compare the regulation of gene transcription by the two chimeric receptors in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, using microarray technology to gain a global perspective on transcriptional regulation. Overall, 3T3-L1 TIGR cells showed a greater transcriptional response than TIR cells. Of the differentially regulated mRNAs, the potent mitogen heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) was shown to be highly selectively up-regulated by TIGR chimeras. The basis for this selective effect on HB-EGF mRNA was explored further, because it was thought to represent an excellent candidate for the preferential mitogenic effects of the IGF-1R. Insulin (Actrapid) was supplied by Novo-Nordisk, and IGF-1 was supplied by GroPep. NT-3 was a generous gift from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and HB-EGF was supplied by Sigma. The inhibitors PD153035, PD98059, and wortmannin were all from Calbiochem. Cycloheximide and actinomycin-D were from Sigma. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and anti-active MAPK antibody (specific for dual-phosphorylated MAPK) and anti-Erk 1/2 antibody (which recognizes non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms) were purchased from Promega. Unless indicated otherwise, all cell culture and general purpose laboratory reagents were supplied by Sigma. 3T3-L1 TIR/TIGR preadipocytes were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. NIH-3T3 IR/IGF-1R cells and HaCat cells (12Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3493) Google Scholar) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Confluent 3T3-L1 TIR/TIGR cells were serum-starved overnight and then stimulated with 4 nm NT-3 for 4 h. Total RNA from stimulated and unstimulated cells was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). This RNA was then processed according to the protocol recommended by Affymetrix, using the Superscript Choice kit (Invitrogen) for double-stranded cDNA synthesis and the Enzo Bioarray kit for in vitrotranscription and labeling of cRNA. 15-μg samples of fragmented cRNA were hybridized for 16 h at 45 °C to MG-U74A mouse arrays (Affymetrix). Analysis of the scanned chips was carried out using Affymetrix Microarray Suite version 4.0, using default settings and a target intensity of 100 for each chip as a whole. Further analysis (sorting into groups) was carried out using a relational database program based on Filemaker Pro 5, developed for microarray analysis by G. Denyer. The program allowed the formation of clusters based on both data from the chips (mRNA intensity, fold change, etc.) and on known functionality (e.g. pathways, etc.). The clusters were combined in multiple comparison statements (AND/OR/NOT), and genes of interest were followed up by break out to web databases (e.g. SwissProt, BLAST, etc.) for the collection of sequence and functional information. In order to find transcripts expressed at a similar level in two chips, we first eliminated all transcripts that were classified by the Affymetrix software as increasing to or decreasing from a detectable signal. We also eliminated all those sequences that were more than 1.5-fold different between the two chips, unless they were undetectable in both. To find transcripts that were different between two chips, we selected for mRNAs that were classified as increasing to or decreasing from a detectable signal, with a difference of more than 2-fold. Transcripts were only included in the final lists if they fulfilled these selection criteria in two independent microarray experiments. Confluent cells were serum-starved and treated as indicated in the text. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini-kit from Qiagen and quantified by GeneQuant (AmershamBiosciences). Equal amounts of RNA were resolved by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis in MOPS buffer before transfer and cross-linking to Nytran N membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were hybridized to HB-EGF probe in Quickhyb solution (Stratagene) for 3–4 h at 65 °C. Membranes were then washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS (2 times for 15 min), followed by a final wash in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min (all at 65 °C), and subsequent visualization using a PhosphorImager (Fuji). HB-EGF probe was made by reverse transcriptase-PCR from a sample of total RNA extracted from 3T3-L1 TIGR cells stimulated with NT-3 for 4 h. The PCR product was gel-purified (QIAquick, Qiagen) and labeled with 32P using Ready-To-Go oligolabeling beads (Amersham Biosciences). The labeled probe was purified using Nick columns (Amersham Biosciences), and ∼10,000 cpm were used for a single hybridization. The probe was sequenced to verify its identity. Confluent cells were serum-starved overnight, before being treated as indicated in the text. They were then rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 30 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 2.5 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100). Cleared lysates were assayed for total protein concentration (Bio-Rad Dc kit), and equal amounts of total protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE (using 8% minigels) and transferred by electroblotting to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was then placed in blocking buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, detection was carried out with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse/rabbit antibody (Dako) and ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). HaCat cells were seeded into 12-well plates at equal density and allowed to grow to ∼80% confluency. They were then serum-starved for 24 h, followed by treatment for 16 h as described in the text. Culture medium was then replaced with serum-free medium containing 1 μCi/well [3H]thymidine for 4 h (37 °C), followed by two washes in ice-cold PBS and precipitation at 4 °C for 30 min in 10% trichloroacetic acid. Cells were then washed once in 5% trichloroacetic acid and solubilized first in 0.2 m NaOH and then in 0.4 m HCl. Lysates were combined for counting. We first compared transcript levels in NT-3-stimulated TIR/TIGR cells with levels of the same transcripts in untreated cells. Only genes/ESTs that were similar at base line in untreated TIGR and TIR cells according to our selection criteria (see “Experimental Procedures”) were considered further. From this set of transcripts with similar base-line levels, we selected those that were increased or decreased from base line in either cell line after chimeric receptor stimulation. This resulted in a list of 185 transcripts that were up-regulated and 38 that were down-regulated in either cell line. Fig. 1 shows the fold changes from base line for each of these genes/ESTs, represented as a scatter plot with the fold change from base line after TIGR stimulation along the horizontal axis, and that for TIR stimulation along the vertical axis. Simple inspection of this plot demonstrates clearly the greater effect of TIGR compared with TIR in terms of numbers of genes whose expression level increased and the extent of that change. Down-regulated genes, on the other hand, did not show such a bias. The bias toward TIGR-mediated stimulation was confirmed by linear regression analysis of the data that yielded a gradient of 0.66. As would be expected from the similarity of their receptors, insulin and IGF-1 do have overlapping effects, so we searched for transcripts that were similarly regulated by the two chimeric receptors after stimulation with NT-3, using stringent selection criteria (see “Experimental Procedures”). From a list of transcripts expressed at similar levels in TIR versus TIGR comparisons at base line and after stimulation of the chimeric receptors, we then selected only those genes that were increased or decreased from base line in TIR cells. This approach revealed 23 transcripts that were up-regulated similarly by the TIR and TIGR (TableI, part A). Some of these molecules have known roles in various processes including proliferation, gene expression from transcription to translation, protein modification and degradation, and cellular adhesion. In addition, two secreted products (protein related to DAN and cerberus, small inducible cytokine A2) were up-regulated by both TIR and TIGR stimulation. These could be involved in signaling to neighboring cells, thus adding another layer of complexity to the downstream effects of TIR/TIGR signaling. Fewer mRNAs (13Roudabush F.L. Pierce K.L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22583-22589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) were equally down-regulated by the two receptors, in agreement with the general expression patterns observed. These transcripts encoded proteins involved in metabolism, apoptosis, signaling, and vesicular transport (Table I, part B).Table IGenes regulated in a similar fashion by TIR and TIGR after 4 h stimulationIDDescriptionTIR4/TIR0FunctionA.

Of the 11 differentially regulated transcripts, 1 was an EST that was suppressed to a greater extent by the TIR. The remaining 10 were all increased to a greater extent by TIGR activation. The differentially regulated genes with known functions had roles in transcription, transport, adhesion, and proliferation.Table IIGenes differentially regulated by TIR/TIGR signaling after 4 h stimulationIDDescriptionTIGR4/TIR4TIGR4/TIGR0TIR4/TIR0FunctionL07264Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor4.46.41.6ProliferationX69902Integrin α63.43.92.3AdhesionM63801Connexin 432.41.71.0AdhesionU72680Ion channel homologue RIC4.84.02.5TransportAF087434NF-Atc isoform a3.52.31.4TranscriptionAW212475Unknown2.812.72.9MiscellaneousM88242griPGHS2.45.61.7MiscellaneousAI594427Unknown2.74.71.8MiscellaneousAF002719Secretory leukoprotease inhibitor4.02.41.3MiscellaneousAF087687Calcium-binding protein S100A13.42.3−1.6MiscellaneousAI644158Unknown4.1−1.7−5.9MiscellaneousGenes that were different at base line were first eliminated, and from the resulting list, genes were selected that were differentially regulated by TIR/TIGR signaling (see “Experimental Procedures” for details of selection criteria). Representative data are shown for genes that fulfilled these criteria in two independent experiments. Open table in a new tab Genes that were different at base line were first eliminated, and from the resulting list, genes were selected that were differentially regulated by TIR/TIGR signaling (see “Experimental Procedures” for details of selection criteria). Representative data are shown for genes that fulfilled these criteria in two independent experiments. Only a fraction of the 223 genes identified as being affected by TIR/TIGR activation were found to be equally or differentially regulated. The remainder fell outside the boundaries of our selection criteria, for example by being between 1.5- and 2-fold different in stimulated cells. The numbers of genes observed as being similarly or differentially regulated were small because we designed our selection criteria with high stringency to reduce the risk of false positive results. Representative genes from each of the three groupings (equally up-regulated, equally down-regulated, and differentially regulated) were examined by Northern blotting, and in each case those results confirmed the microarray data (data not shown). One of the genes selectively up-regulated by TIGR was the mitogen HB-EGF. We hypothesized that TIGR-specific up-regulation of HB-EGF could account for at least some of the more mitogenic effects of IGF-1R signaling, and we therefore chose to study the regulation of this gene in more depth. In order to verify the microarray data and obtain a more detailed view of HB-EGF gene regulation in response to TIR and TIGR signaling, a time course experiment was carried out. Confluent 3T3-L1 TIR and TIGR cells were serum-starved for at least 4 h, followed by stimulation with 4 nm NT-3 for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h. RNA extracts were Northern-blotted for HB-EGF (Fig.2 A). Three independent experiments confirmed the microarray result, showing a stimulation of HB-EGF gene transcription in TIGR but not TIR cells. The differences seen were not significant until the 4-h time point and continued up to 24 h, the last time point studied. We proceeded to determine whether the differences in HB-EGF expression observed in the cells expressing chimeric receptors would also be seen when insulin and IGF-1 holoreceptors were activated. NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing IR or IGF-1R were serum-starved for at least 4 h, followed by 4 h of stimulation with varying concentrations of insulin or IGF-1 (for NIH-3T3 IR or IGFR cells respectively). Equal amounts of RNA extracts were then Northern-blotted for HB-EGF. Three independent experiments showed that although insulin did cause an increase in HB-EGF transcription in this system, IGF-1 clearly stimulated HB-EGF transcription to a greater extent than insulin, at both 5 and 10 nm concentrations (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, the selective regulation of HB-EGF by chimeric receptors is also a property of whole IR/IGF-1Rs. In order to discern whether TIGR signaling was acting on transcription of HB-EGF or on the stability of its mRNA, we stimulated 3T3-L1 TIGR cells with NT-3 for 4 h and then incubated with actinomycin D (to block further RNA synthesis) with or without NT-3. HB-EGF mRNA levels at various time points after actinomycin D treatment were studied by Northern blotting to observe any effect of TIGR signaling on mRNA degradation. TIGR signaling did not have any effect on mRNA stability, with both NT-3-treated and -untreated samples degrading to ∼35% of their initial levels by 4 h (Fig.2 C). Thus it appears likely that TIGR signaling stimulates transcription of the HB-EGF gene. Finally, we determined whether the up-regulation of HB-EGF was a primary transcriptional response or a secondary effect. 3T3-L1 TIGR cells were stimulated with NT-3 for 4 h in the presence or absence of cycloheximide. Cycloheximide did not inhibit HB-EGF mRNA induction, and in fact caused a slight superinduction relative to NT-3 alone (Fig. 2 D). Therefore, TIGR-mediated up-regulation of HB-EGF is a primary transcriptional response that does not requirede novo protein synthesis. To determine whether the selective increase in HB-EGF mRNA was accompanied by a similarly selective release of HB-EGF bioactivity, we examined conditioned medium from cells expressing activated TIGR or TIR. Briefly, 3T3-L1 TIR or TIGR cells were stimulated with NT-3 for 24 h. Conditioned medium from these cells was used to treat HaCat cells (12Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3493) Google Scholar), a human keratinocyte cell line that expresses abundant EGF receptors (EGFR). TIGR-conditioned medium caused a significant increase in MAPK phosphorylation in HaCat cells, whereas TIR-conditioned medium had no significant effect (Fig.3, A and B). This pattern was mirrored almost exactly at the level of proliferation in HaCat cells, with TIGR-conditioned medium stimulating thymidine uptake to the same extent as seen for MAPK phosphorylation, whereas TIR-conditioned medium had no effect (Fig. 3 C). In the case of both MAPK phosphorylation and thymidine incorporation, this stimulatory effect was completely abrogated by concomitant treatment with the EGFR kinase inhibitor PD153035, indicating that the mitogenic activity in the medium is due to an EGFR ligand. It is, of course, possible that other EGFR ligands are contributing to this effect. Of the other members of the EGF family, only epiregulin was detectable in the microarray experiments, with EGF, transforming growth factor-α, amphiregulin, neuregulin, and betacellulin all being classed as absent by the Affymetrix software. Interestingly, the mRNA levels of epiregulin itself were also induced somewhat more by activated TIGR than TIR (3.8-fold), and epiregulin was only excluded from our list of differentially regulated genes by a narrow margin. However, TIR stimulation also induced expression of epiregulin mRNA, in contrast to the all-or-nothing response seen in the case of HB-EGF. Because the EGFR ligand detected correlates more with the expression of HB-EGF mRNA than epiregulin, it is highly likely to be HB-EGF, although a minor contributory role for epiregulin cannot be entirely ruled out.

Micromolar Ntp dose-dependently increased the mean open channel probability in ligand-free solution (P O(max)) and attenuated the ATP inhibition of KIR6.2/SUR1, but had no effect on homomeric KIR6.2 channels. Ntp (up to ∼10−4m) did not affect significantly the mean open or “fast,” K+ driving force-dependent, intraburst closed times, verifying that Ntp selectively modulates the ratio of mean burst to interburst times. Ctp and Rnp, a randomized Ntp, had no effect, indicating that the effects of Ntp are structure specific. Ntp opened KIR6.1/SUR1 channels normally silent in the absence of stimulatory Mg− nucleotide(s) and attenuated the coupling of high-affinity sulfonylurea binding with KATP pore closure. These effects resemble those seen with N-terminal deletions (ΔN) of KIR6.0, and application of Ntp to ΔNKATP channels decreased theirP O(max) and apparent IC50 for ATP in the absence of Mg2+. The results are consistent with a competition between Ntp and the endogenous N terminus for a site of interaction on the cytoplasmic face of the channel or with partial replacement of the deleted N terminus by Ntp, respectively. The KIR N terminus and the TMD0-L0 segment of SUR1 are known to control the P O(max). The L0 linker has been reported to be required for glibenclamide binding, and ΔNKIR6.2/SUR1 channels exhibit reduced labeling of KIR with 125I-azidoglibenclamide, implying that the KIR N terminus and L0 of SUR1 are in proximity. We hypothesize that L0 interacts with the KIR N terminus in ligand-inhibited KATP channels and put forward a model, based on the architecture of BtuCD, MsbA, and the KcsA channel, in which TMD0-L0 links the MDR-like core of SUR with the KIR pore.

A basic question in ion channel biology is how regulatory subunits modulate pore gating. Multiple solutions have evolved; for example, KV channels associate with and are regulated by small soluble cytoplasmic β-subunits (see, for example, Ref. 1Gulbis J.M. Zhou M. Mann S. MacKinnon R.

SUR-dependent channel stimulators, including Mg-ADP/ATP, other magnesium nucleotide diphosphates, and KATP channel openers like diazoxide, induce opposite changes in burst/interburst times (e.g. Ref.6Gillis K.D.

Different single channel transition schemes with ATP binding to closed, open, or both states have been proposed to account for KATP channel gating. Recent observations question models with interburst closed state-delimited binding of ATP (e.g.Refs. 7Li L. Geng X. Drain P. J. Gen.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11587-11592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These studies showed that KIR/SUR interactions 1) increase the τo, the K+ driving force-dependent mean open time, by ∼2.5-fold; 2) dramatically increase theP O(max) as a consequence of the reduced occupancy of the voltage-independent interburst closed state(s), an effect that is more marked for the SUR2 isoform; and 3) markedly decrease the apparent IC50(ATP), an effect that is more pronounced for SUR1. The results imply that association of KIR with SUR, presumably through an interaction involving its transmembrane M1 domain (11Schwappach B. Zerangue N. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 26: 155-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), increases theV m-dependent τo, which is relatively insensitive to perturbations of the cytoplasmic parts of KATP channel subunits (10Babenko A.P.

This suggests that interactions within the transmembrane electrical field can stabilize a conducting conformation of the pore, whereas separable cytoplasmic contacts between SUR and KIR6.2 can favor a long-lived closed conformation of the KIR 3This general formulation is independent of arguments about the degree of coupling between multiple “gates.” 3This general formulation is independent of arguments about the degree of coupling between multiple “gates.” and decrease the apparent K D for inhibitory ATP.Comparison of chimeric KIR6.2/SUR1∼SUR2A channels (10Babenko A.P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29122-29129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) specifies the lower P O(max) of β-cell channels (KIR6.2/SUR1), implying its participation in a regulatory contact. Additionally, the L0 linker has been reported to be necessary for the binding of the sulfonylurea glibenclamide (16Mikhailov M.V. Mikhailova E.A. Ashcroft S.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), which inhibits KATP channels. The necessity of the L0 linker for the transport functions of the multidrug resistanceprotein MRP1, an ATP-binding cassette protein closely related to SUR, has been elegantly demonstrated by Bakos et al. (17Bakos E. Evers R. Calenda G. Tusnady G.E. Szakacs G. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4451-4461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).N-terminal truncations (ΔN) of KIR6.2 provided the first evidence for involvement of the initial, “distal” half of the cytoplasmic N terminus of KIR in SUR-dependent interactions that control the ligand-sensitive kinetics of KATP channels (12Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Koster J.C. Sha Q. Shyng S. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515: 19-30Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). ΔN32KIR6.2, like ΔN44KIR6.2, produces ΔNKIR6.2/SUR1 channels with dramatically elongated bursts and apparently destabilized interburst closed state(s), but normal values of τo and intraburst τCf (12Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The ΔN32 deletion increases the IC50(ATP) of ΔNKIR6.2/SUR1 channels from ∼6 to ∼90 μm, without affecting the higher IC50(ATP) (∼0.2 mm) and much lowerP O(max) values of homomeric inward rectifiers (see also Ref. 18Koster J.C. Sha Q. Shyng S. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515: 19-30Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These findings suggest three things. First, the N terminus of KIR reduces the mean open channel probability (P O), the maximum of which is limited to τo/(τo + τCf), a value that must be set by contacts between a conserved domain(s) in SUR and a region(s) of KIR distinct from the first half of the N terminus. Second, deletion of up to 44 amino acids from the N terminus does not disrupt the ATP-binding site of KIR, which, in the KIR/SUR complex, is able to bind inhibitory ATP in both the open and closed states. Third, the N terminus facilitates transitions to interburst conformation(s), which may have the highest microaffinity for ATP, although contacts between the KIR N terminus and SUR are not sufficient to account completely for the enhanced apparent affinity for inhibitory ATP of KATP channelsversus homomeric KIR6.2ΔC35 pores. The conserved distal N terminus also participates in contacts that stabilize the ligand-sensitive closed state of KIR6.1-based channels. These “KNDP” channels normally require a stimulatory magnesium nucleotidediphosphate or hydrolyzable triphosphate and Mg2+ for their opening; however, truncation of the N terminus of KIR6.1 induces bursting of ΔNKIR6.1/SUR1 channels in nucleotide-free solutions (19Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49083-49092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The P O(max) of ΔNKIR6.1/SUR1 and ΔNKIR6.2/SUR1 channels is similarly reduced by ATP, indicating that both are ATP-sensitive (19Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49083-49092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These studies do not provide an explanation for the activity of the N terminus (i.e. whether a specific peptide sequence is needed, or whether a simple charge is sufficient), nor do they suggest which domains the N terminus might interact with during KATP channel gating.A functional role for the proximal half of the KIR N terminus has not been clarified by truncation mainly because deletions greater than ΔN44 fail to produce channels when coexpressed with SUR (12Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49083-49092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The SUR-dependent increase inP O(max), due to an increased occupancy of interburst closed state(s), observed in KIR6.2(R50Q/K185Q)/SUR1 channels with mutations in both submembrane segments (12Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) implies interactions between the proximal N- and C-terminal domains of KIR. 4This is consistent with the notion that size, rather than charge or hydrophobicity of the side chain of residue 50, is critical for the ATP inhibitory gating (43Proks P. Gribble F.M. Adhikari R. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 19-25Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 4This is consistent with the notion that size, rather than charge or hydrophobicity of the side chain of residue 50, is critical for the ATP inhibitory gating (43Proks P. Gribble F.M. Adhikari R. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 19-25Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The results are consistent with the proposed involvement of both the N and C termini in controlling what has been termed a “slow, cytoplasmic gate” in chimeric KIR6.1∼KIR6.2/SUR channels independently of whether the transmembrane core is from KIR6.1 or KIR6.2 (20Kondo C. Repunte V.P. Satoh E. Yamada M. Horio Y. Matsuzawa Y. Pott L. Kurachi Y. Recept. Channels. 1998; 6: 129-140PubMed Google Scholar, 21Takano M. Xie L.H. Otani H. Horie M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 512: 395-406Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Isolated proximal N-terminal fragments of KIR6.2 fused with GST will pull-down C-terminal peptides (22Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33393-33397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The tight binding of these domains is consistent with a role in channel assembly. Binding of the proximal C-terminal domain of KIR6.2 to SUR1 has also been proposed to determine their co-assembly (23Giblin J.P. Leaney J.L. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22652-22659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), although others (11Schwappach B. Zerangue N. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 26: 155-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), using a different biochemical assay, have concluded that the M1 helix of KIR and/or its N-terminal extension co-associates with SUR. It is unclear whether these stable intra- and intersubunit contacts specify channel dynamicsversus assembly.To search for interactions that control gating and that are presumably dependent on open versus closed states of the channel, we examined the effect of synthetic peptides on theP O(max) of KIR6.0/SUR1 channels and their inhibition by ATP and sulfonylureas and correlated these with the effect of ΔNKIR6.2 deletion on co-photolabeling of KIR by 125I-azidoglibenclamide bound to SUR1. Our findings suggest a model in which sequence-specific interactions between the first half of the N terminus of KIR6.0 and a cytoplasmic loop of SUR1 increase the occupancy of theV m-independent, interburst closed state(s) of KATP channels. Similar functional assays could be used to identify intersubunit interactions that control gating of other ion channels and electrogenic transporters.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that application of Ntp, a short peptide equivalent to the initial N terminus of KIR6.2, to the cytoplasmic face of intact KIR6.0/SUR1 channels increased their open probability. Application of Ntp to ΔNKIR6.0/SUR1 channels, the open probability of which is already at a maximal value as a consequence of truncating the N terminus, slightly reduced theirP O(max). Thus, the initial N terminus of KIR6.2, homologous in both KIR6.0 isoforms, can alter the stability of burst versus interburst conformation(s) of KIR6.0-based channels. The effects were SUR-dependent, as the N-terminal peptide did not alter the gating of homomeric KIR channels. The effects were selective, as Ntp did not significantly affect τCf or τo, characterizing the fast intraburst kinetics of heteromultimeric channels, or alter their responsiveness to the Mg− nucleotide-dependent stimulatory action of SUR. The effects of Ntp were relatively low-affinity, in agreement with the notion that hydrophilic peptides may adopt many conformations in solution, resulting in a lower effective concentration; with the observation that a synthetic peptide based on the hydrophilic N terminus of KVβ1.1, which shows only transient formation of local structures in solution, inactivates KV channels with micromolar affinity (29Wissmann R. Baukrowitz T. Kalbacher H. Kalbitzer H.R. Ruppersberg J.P. Pongs O. Antz C. Fakler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35521-35525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); and with the low secondary structure of the initial N terminus of KIR6.2 predicted previously (Fig.5) (30Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 717-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The results imply that the endogenous N terminus of KIR6.0 must participate in a dynamic binding/unbinding reaction that allows Ntp to compete for a contact site(s).The action of Ntp was rapidly reversible, apparently diffusion-limited, and sequence-specific. A randomized peptide of equivalent amino acid composition, solubility, and charge had no effect. There was no binding of ATP or sulfonylureas to Ntp, which could explain its effects on the ligand inhibition of KATP channels. Ntp increases theP O(max) under conditions (i.e. the absence of ATP) in which only a decrease in membrane phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate content is possible and could contribute to a slow rundown of channel activity (31Hilgemann D.W. Ball R. Science. 1996; 273: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Thus, although Ntp has multiple positively charged residues, it does not appear to act by neutralizing or screening negatively charged membrane phospholipids postulated to stabilize an ATP-insensitive open state of the inner gate of KIR6.2 independently of SUR (32Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G. Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). 6In this reference, partially purified preparations of the full-length C terminus of KIR6.2 fused with GST were reported to facilitate the decay of KATPcurrents. We have not seen such an effect of our synthetic peptides, including Ctp, which contains residues postulated to bind phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate. Therefore, modulation of KATP channels by Ntp appears to reflect competition for a cytoplasmic site on the KIR6.0/SUR1 complex.Several pieces of evidence suggest that the initial N terminus and a segment more proximal to M1 may interact with distinct cytoplasmic parts of the KIR6.2/SUR1 complex. The gain ofP O(max) determined for KATPchannels with double versus single R50Q and K185Q mutations first suggested that the proximal N- and C-terminal domains are close to each other (12Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).4 A fusion protein consisting of the first 53 residues from the N terminus of KIR6.2 linked to GST pulled down a C-terminal KIR6.2 fragment (residues 170–391) (22Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33393-33397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Based on the patterns of interaction of a series of shorter overlapping N terminus-GST fusion proteins with the C-terminal fragment, this approach suggested that amino acid segment 30–46 was necessary for stable interaction (note, however, that ΔN32KIR6.2 and ΔN44KIR6.2 readily co-assemble with SUR1 functional channels (12Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Koster J.C. Sha Q. Shyng S. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515: 19-30Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar)). A similar approach delineated several segments of the C terminus (33Jones P.A. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as candidates for interaction with the proximal N terminus (including Arg50), and one of these segments (residues 170–204) includes Lys185. An earlier analysis (20Kondo C. Repunte V.P. Satoh E. Yamada M. Horio Y. Matsuzawa Y. Pott L. Kurachi Y. Recept. Channels. 1998; 6: 129-140PubMed Google Scholar) of chimeric KIR6.1∼KIR6.2/SUR1 channels carrying overlapping segments of KIR N and C termini implicated amino acids 37–45 in controlling “spontaneous bursting” and implicated a single segment in the C terminus distinct from that delineated by the GST fusion protein method. Although these approaches imply the participation of a common proximal N-terminal segment in stable N/C-terminal associations, they have uncovered no specific interactions between the distal N terminus and the C terminus of either KIR6.1 or KIR6.2. We hypothesize that the SUR-dependent modulation of KATP channels by Ntp reflects a competition of Ntp with the initial N terminus of a closed KIR for a cytoplasmic site on a relaxed, non-stimulatory conformation of SUR1. Deletion of the N-terminal segment of KIR6.1 equivalent to Ntp destabilizes a permanently closed state of the KIR6.1/SUR complex. This implies that the initial KIR N terminus serves as an inhibitory linker between SUR and the cytoplasmic gate in both KNDP and KATP channels (19Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49083-49092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Shorter N-terminal truncations or concatenation of KIR subunits, which could change the position or mobility of the N terminus, produce partial effects (19Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49083-49092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We propose that by displacing the linker from SUR, Ntp interferes with its action in intact channels while partially mimicking it and thus slightly inhibiting ΔNKIRchannels. 7The smaller reverse effect on the ΔNKATP versus intact channels would be consistent with the lower coupling efficiency of the isolated peptideversus the endogenous N terminus. What cytoplasmic domain(s) of SUR1 is in proximity to the distal KIR N terminus? As illustrated in Fig. 5, the potential candidates are nucleotide-binding domains NBD1 and NBD2; the C terminus; and several loops, including the ∼100-residue-long L0 linker (14Tusnady G.E. Bakos E. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 15Raab-Graham K.F. Cirilo L.J. Boettcher A.A. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 41270-41278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mutations in the nucleotide-binding folds do not alter the spontaneous bursting of KATP channels or their inhibition by nucleotides or sulfonylureas in the absence of Mg2+, suggesting that they are unlikely to affect gating through contacts with the KIR N terminus. Similarly, mutations and truncations of the C terminus of SUR1 (26Sharma N. Crane A. Clement J.P., IV Gonzalez G. Babenko A.P. Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20628-20632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 35Sakura H. Trapp S. Liss B. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 521: 337-350Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) do not markedly alter the P o(max) (∼0.6) of KIR6.2/SUR1ΔC channels, indicating that this region is also an unlikely candidate. On the other hand, there is growing evidence for intersubunit interactions involving the L0 linker of SUR and the KIR N terminus that attenuate theP o. Analysis of SUR1 and SUR2 chimeras identified the TMD0-L0 segment as a critical determinant of the interburst kinetics (10Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11587-11592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) affected by deletion of the KIR N terminus (12Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The L0 sequences of SUR1 and SUR2 are not identical, and their differential interaction with the KIR N terminus is consistent with these results. Several lines of evidence suggest that the L0 linker and the distal KIR N terminus may be in close proximity. An ∼50-kDa fragment spanning the TMD0-L0 segment is the site of photolabeling of SUR1 with 125I-glibenclamide (28Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P., IV Boyd III, A.E.

The results imply that the L0 linker and the distal N terminus of KIR6.0 are in proximity.Our working model is illustrated in Fig. 5.

Mucosally produced IgA consists predominantly of dimers and some larger polymers, collectively called polymeric IgA (pIgA).1 IgA polymerization is regulated by the incorporation of the joining chain (J chain) in that its presence greatly stimulates polymerization (3Sørensen V.

Receptor-IgA complexes are internalized and then transcytosed to the apical surface, where secretory IgA (S-IgA) is released into the lumen by proteolytic cleavage of the receptor ectodomain (2Norderhaug I.N.

Cleavage of unoccupied receptor releases the five extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains (D1–D5), known as free secretory component (SC).IgM also has the ability to polymerize, mainly to pentamers with incorporated J chain and to hexamers without (3Sørensen V.

As for IgA, only J chain-containing IgM polymers bind the pIgR (11Brandtzaeg P. Prydz H. Nature. 1984; 311: 71-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 18Eskeland T. Brandtzaeg P.

Today. 1995; 16: 392-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). During evolution of IgG, the ability to form polymers, incorporate the J chain, and bind to the pIgR was lost. Thus, the IgM and IgA heavy chains (μ- and α-chain, respectively) have a number of features that are absent in IgG. Both IgM and IgA have a COOH-terminal extension of 18 amino acids called the secretory tailpiece, which includes a cysteine required for polymerization in the penultimate position (Cys-575 in μ tailpiece; Cys-495 in α tailpiece). Besides the secretory tailpiece cysteines, Cys-337 and Cys-414 are available for disulfide bonding in IgM. Whereas Cys-337 most likely forms intramonomeric bonds between two Cμ2 domains, Cys-414 (located in Cμ3) forms intermonomeric bonds (22Beale D. Feinstein A. Biochem. J. 1969; 112: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Davis A.C. Roux K.H. Pursey J. Shulman M.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 24Sitia R.

Conversely, Cys-309 in IgA (equivalent to Cys-414 in IgM) is used for covalent bonding to pIgR during transcytosis (27Fallgreen-Gebauer E. Gebauer W. Bastian A. Kratzin H.D. Eiffert H. Zimmermann B. Karas M. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe. Seyler. 1993; 374: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, during evolution of IgA the polymerization process has altered to favor dimerization rather than formation of larger polymers. Monomers are also secreted from IgA-producing plasma cells, whereas they are mainly retained and degraded in IgM-producing plasma cells (24Sitia R. Neuberger M. Alberini C. Bet P. Fra A. Valetti C. Williams G. Milstein C. Cell. 1990; 60: 781-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).J chain incorporation is an early event in IgA polymerization, and this peptide is found in all polymeric forms of this isotype (3Sørensen V. Rasmussen I.B. Sundvold V. Michaelsen T.E. Sandlie I. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,4Vaerman J.P. Langendries A. Vander Maelen C. Immunol. Invest. 1995; 24: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For IgM, however, the J chain is incorporated late in the polymerization process and is found only in pentamers (17Brewer J.W. Corley R.B. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mode of pIgR binding differs significantly between the two isotypes, and in some species (most notably the rabbit) the ability of the pIgR to bind pentameric IgM has been selectively lost (28Røe M. Norderhaug I.N. Brandtzaeg P. Johansen F.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6046-6052PubMed Google Scholar, 29Weicker J. Underdown B.J. J. Immunol. 1975; 114: 1337-1344PubMed Google Scholar). To address the structural basis for the disparate polymerization properties of IgA and IgM and their differential mode of interaction with pIgR, we made a series of domain swap mutants between human IgA1 and human IgM. Our results demonstrate that the COOH-terminal domains of IgA and IgM contain the most important structural elements involved in isotype-specific polymerization. We also found that swapping Cμ4 with Cα3 made IgM able to bind to the rabbit pIgR, indicating that the COOH-terminal domain is also most important for the differential receptor binding.DISCUSSIONIgA and IgM have unique motifs, not found in IgG, which allow them to form polymers and incorporate J chain. Such J chain-containing polymers are selectively transported by pIgR into exocrine fluids to form secretory antibodies (S-IgA and S-IgM). The extensive antigenic exposure of the mucosae underscores the need for a specific first-line defense. However, differences between IgA and IgM exist, both in the size of polymers formed and in their J chain incorporation and mode of interaction with the pIgR. To localize structural motifs that determine these differences, we made domain swap mutants between IgA and IgM heavy chains. The results clearly showed that the COOH-terminal domains (Cα3 and Cμ4) primarily direct the degree of polymer formation. Furthermore, we found that J chain incorporation was restricted to immunoglobulin pentamers containing Cμ4 but occurred in all polymeric forms of immunoglobulins containing Cα3. SC binding and pIgR-mediated transcytosis also demonstrated that the COOH-terminal domains contained the structural elements that determine differential interaction of J chain-containing pIgA and pentameric IgM with rabbit and human pIgR/free SC. However, the COOH-terminal domain was not the only determinant contributing to the functional properties of the chimeric immunoglobulins, because the pentameric AAM chimera showed increased binding to human pIgR/free SC compared with both IgM and IgA and a similar degree of covalent SC complexing as IgA.Structural Requirements for Immunoglobulin PolymerizationAlthough the structures of the α- and μ-chains clearly differ, the exact motifs directing the differential polymerization patterns observed for IgA and IgM remain elusive.

Recombinant human IgM engineered to contain an α tailpiece (IgMαtp) was found to polymerize like IgM, although with increased hexamer formation (30Sørensen V. Rasmussen I.B. Norderhaug L. Natvig I. Michaelsen T.E. Sandlie I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2858-2865PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the reciprocal mutation with μ tailpiece introduced into IgA led to the formation of some polymers larger than wild-type pIgA (37Sørensen V. Sundvold V. Michaelsen T.E. Sandlie I. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3448-3455PubMed Google Scholar). Both μ-tailpiece and α-tailpiece sequences induced formation of polymers including pentamers and hexamers when added onto IgG, and such polymerization was most efficient when the secretory tailpiece was introduced in conjunction with a Cys-414/Cys-309 homologue in Cγ2 (30Sørensen V. Rasmussen I.B. Norderhaug L. Natvig I. Michaelsen T.E. Sandlie I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2858-2865PubMed Google Scholar, 35Smith R.I. Coloma M.J. Morrison S.L. J.

These results suggested that although the secretory tailpiece is sufficient to drive the polymerization process, it does not by itself direct the number of monomers incorporated into the polymers. The analyses of the domain swap mutants described here were carried out to identify the constant region domain(s) that harbors the elements required for isotype-specific polymerization and pIgR-binding properties of polymeric immunoglobulins.Together with the light chain and the heavy chain variable domain, the first constant domain forms the so-called Fab portion of the immunoglobulin. The remainder of the heavy chain forms the so-called Fc portion believed to be responsible for most isotype-specific effector functions. To test whether the first constant domain could affect the polymerization pattern of the chimeric immunoglobulins, we exchanged the Cμ1 domain in IgM with the Cα1 domain, producing the AMMM chimera. We also made the same substitution in the MMMA chimera producing the AMMA variant. In both cases, the polymerization pattern of the resulting chimera was nearly identical to that of the parental immunoglobulin. Thus, our findings indicated that the first heavy chain domain does not influence the number of monomers linked during polymerization. This conclusion is supported by the observations that immunoglobulin light chains, which are normally bound to the Cμ1 domain, are not required for efficient polymerization of IgM (45Bornemann K.D. Brewer J.W. Beck-Engeser G.B. Corley R.B. Haas I.G. Jack H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4912-4916Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and that IgM lacking the Cμ1 domain is also secreted as polymers (46Kohler G. Potash M.J. Lehrach H. Shulman M.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Other studies have suggested that the Cμ2 region is not essential for IgM pentamer assembly, but the Cμ3 domain may play an important role in the polymerization (3Sørensen V. Rasmussen I.B. Sundvold V. Michaelsen T.E. Sandlie I. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 47Poon P.H. Morrison S.L. Schumaker V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8571-8577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that mutation of five amino acids flanking Cys-309 in IgA into the corresponding amino acids present in IgM, forming the so-called IgAalm mutant, resulted in only a small increase of trimers and tetramers (37Sørensen V. Sundvold V. Michaelsen T.E. Sandlie I. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3448-3455PubMed Google Scholar). The AMMA variant, which contained Cμ2 and Cμ3, formed some larger polymers as compared with IgA and the IgAalm mutant. Thus, other structural motifs in Cμ3 may be more important in pentamer formation than the Cys-309 region.We identified the Cα3 and Cμ4 domains as most important for isotype-specific polymerization. Whereas an IgA-like polymerization pattern was observed for the AMMA and MMMA variants, both the AAM and AMMM variants formed mainly pentamers and hexamers. This observation accorded with that of Yoo et al. (38Yoo E.M. Coloma M.J. Trinh K.R. Nguyen T.Q. Vuong L.U. Morrison S.L. Chintalacharuvu K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33771-33777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) on human IgA1-human IgG2 domain swap mutants, which suggested that the Cα3 domain is required for IgA-like polymerization. In the same study, murine IgG2b-human IgM chimeras provided evidence that both Cμ3 and Cμ4 are needed for IgM-like polymerization (38Yoo E.M. Coloma M.J. Trinh K.R. Nguyen T.Q. Vuong L.U. Morrison S.L. Chintalacharuvu K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33771-33777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The fact that our AAM chimera formed mostly pentamers and hexamers, similar to IgM, demonstrated the validity of using IgA-IgM chimeras to identify domains responsible for the differential polymerization pattern of IgA and IgM. Thus, Cα2 or Cμ3, but not Cγ2 (38Yoo E.M. Coloma M.J. Trinh K.R. Nguyen T.Q. Vuong L.U. Morrison S.L. Chintalacharuvu K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33771-33777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), could support IgM-like polymerization. Taken together, our results pointed to the COOH-terminal domain as the main focus for further studies of isotype-specific polymerization motifs.J Chain Incorporation and Interactions with Free SC or pIgR of Polymeric ImmunoglobulinsOnly J chain-containing polymeric immunoglobulins can bind to the pIgR (5Johansen F.E.

Immunol. 1976; 5: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and J chain-specific IgG antibodies or Fab fragments have been shown to inhibit binding of pIgA and pentameric IgM to free SC or the pIgR (10Brandtzaeg P. Scand. J. Immunol. 1975; 4: 837-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,14Vaerman J.P. Langendries A.E. Giffroy D.A. Kaetzel C.S. Fiani C.M. Moro I. Brandtzaeg P. Kobayashi K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the stoichiometry of J chain and λ light chain appeared to be similar for all recombinant immunoglobulin molecules except the AMMM chimera, which had a significantly reduced J chain content. Thus, J chain was abundantly present in pentamers from IgM as well as the AMMM and AAM variants but only at a low level in the AMMM variant. In IgA and the AMMA chimera, J chain was found in dimers and, especially with the AMMA chimera, also in larger polymers. Thus, isotype-specific J chain incorporation is determined by the COOH-terminal domain. Both Yoo et al. (38Yoo E.M. Coloma M.J. Trinh K.R. Nguyen T.Q. Vuong L.U. Morrison S.L. Chintalacharuvu K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33771-33777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and we (3Sørensen V. Rasmussen I.B. Sundvold V. Michaelsen T.E. Sandlie I. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have previously found that chimeras of IgM and IgG need motifs from Cμ3 as well as Cμ4 for efficient J chain incorporation. Our present results suggested that Cα2 and Cμ3 are almost interchangeable in this respect. The role of the Cμ1 domain in J chain incorporation remains to be elucidated.In a recent study, one extra Cα3 domain from IgA2 was added onto IgG1, and the resulting polymers resembled pIgA in that they incorporated J chain and bound to the human pIgR (48Chintalacharuvu K.R. Vuong L.U. Loi L.A. Larrick J.W. Morrison S.L. Clin. Immunol. 2001; 101: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that a predicted exposed loop of the Cα3 domain containing amino acids 402–410 (QEPSQGTTT), constitutes the pIgR binding site of pIgA (49Hexham J.M. White K.D. Carayannopoulos L.N. Mandecki W. Brisette R. Yang Y.S. Capra J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 747-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, a naturally occurring mutant (protein 511) that lacks 36 amino acids in Cα3 (including amino acids 402–410) was found to complex with iodinated rat free SC and to be transported from blood into bile in a manner indistinguishable from pIgA (50Switzer I.C. Loney G.M. Yang D.S. Underdown B.J. Mol. Immunol. 1992; 29: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To identify polymeric immunoglobulin domains involved in the pIgR binding sites, we exploited the fact that the rabbit receptor shows virtually no binding to human pentameric IgM but efficient binding to human pIgA, whereas human pIgR binds both ligands very efficiently. The recombinant rabbit-human chimeric free SC employed in our study (rD1-h SC) behaved like the rabbit receptor and was compared with the human counterpart. We found that all immunoglobulin variants bound quite well to human SC, except for the AMMM chimera, which had incorporated very little J chain. Both IgA and the AMMA chimera showed stronger binding to rD1-h SC than to human SC, in agreement with the higher level of binding shown by human pIgA for rabbit pIgR (28Røe M. Norderhaug I.N. Brandtzaeg P. Johansen F.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6046-6052PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggested that elements in Cα3 are responsible for this efficient binding, which was supported by the fact that not only IgM but also the AAM chimera showed weaker binding to rabbit than to human SC. Our transcytosis experiments confirmed the functionality of the recombinant polymeric immunoglobulins by showing efficient transport of IgA and the AMMA chimera in MDCK cells transfected with either human pIgR, rabbit pIgR, or recombinant rD1-h pIgR. Also, IgM and the AAM chimera were transported by human pIgR but virtually not at all by rabbit pIgR or rD1-h pIgR. As expected, no receptor variant was able to transport the AMMM chimera, which had a low J chain content and low SC/pIgR binding capacity. Surprisingly, despite showing a very high level of binding to human free SC, the AAM chimera was not transported more efficiently than IgM by the human pIgR.The Cys-414 residues of Cμ3 may form disulfide bonds between the monomers in IgM (23Davis A.C. Roux K.H. Pursey J. Shulman M.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas the homologous Cys-309 of Cα2 is not involved in similar bonding between IgA subunits but instead forms a disulfide bridge to human SC (9Krugmann S. Pleass R.J. Atkin J.D. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 244-249PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fallgreen-Gebauer E. Gebauer W. Bastian A. Kratzin H.D. Eiffert H. Zimmermann B. Karas M. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe. Seyler. 1993; 374: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the AMMA chimera, which contained Cys-414 in Cμ3, also formed covalent complexes with human free SC. Thus, the Cys-414 residues were presumably not involved in intermolecular bonds in the AMMA dimer but were available for SC binding. In the AAM chimera, the Cα2 domain Cys-309 could apparently not make intermonomer bonds, because, similar to IgA, pentameric AAM formed covalent complexes with free SC (Fig. 4). The failure of such intramolecular disulfide stabilization may explain why the AAM variant was secreted in only very small amounts. Our result clearly showed that pentamer formation in itself does not restrict covalent SC binding. For IgM, we noted only a weak covalent association of SC with the pentamers, probably because most of the Cys-414 residues were engaged in intermonomer bonds in IgM and therefore unavailable for bridging to Cys-467 of human SC (23Davis A.C. Roux K.H. Pursey J. Shulman M.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Wiersma E.J. Shulman M.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5265-5272PubMed Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether the covalent linking of SC to the AAM chimera made this pentamer more resistant to proteases, as has been shown for S-IgA (51Crottet P. Corthesy B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5445-5453PubMed Google Scholar). It is also possible that the presence of Cα2 enhanced the noncovalent interactions between the AAM chimera and human SC because of progressive interactions between D2 and or D3 of human SC and Cα2 (52Norderhaug I.N. Johansen F.E. Krajci P. Brandtzaeg P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3401-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).We have shown in this study, that the Cμ4 domain was sufficient for pentamer formation. Similarly, the Cα3 domain was sufficient for directing dimer formation. Cα3 also contained the unique motif for dimeric IgA to bind rabbit pIgR. Furthermore recombinant immunoglobulins containing Cμ4 failed to bind rabbit pIgR. We also produced a pentameric IgA-IgM chimeric variant that associated covalently with SC. Although such bonding did not increase ligand transport by human pIgR-transfected MDCK cells, it is known to stabilize S-IgA in secretions. At least 80% of all antibody-secreting plasma cells of the body are located in the gastrointestinal and respiratory mucosae, and most of them are committed to immunoglobulin A (IgA) production (1Brandtzaeg P.

Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 19: 481-508PubMed Google Scholar). All immunoglobulin isotypes consists of two heavy (H) and two light (L) chains, but for IgA, this H2L2 monomeric unit can polymerize further. Mucosally produced IgA consists predominantly of dimers and some larger polymers, collectively called polymeric IgA (pIgA).1 IgA polymerization is regulated by the incorporation of the joining chain (J chain) in that its presence greatly stimulates polymerization (3Sørensen V.

The recently demonstrated presence of a functional 26 S proteasome in Trypanosoma brucei led to the identification and isolation of genes encoding all 11 non-ATPase (Rpn) subunit proteins in the trypanosome 19 S regulatory complex. Using the technique of RNA interference, expression of individual RPNgenes was disrupted in the procyclic form of T. brucei, resulting, in each case, in intracellular accumulation of polyubiquitinated protein, cell arrest at the G2/M phase, and eventual cell death. With the exception of Rpn10, depletion of individual Rpn proteins disrupted also trypanosome 19 S complex formation, with the complex virtually depleted in the cell lysate. This functional and structural essentiality of 10 of the 11 Rpn proteins in T. brucei differs significantly from that observed in other organisms. When Rpn10 was deficient in trypanosomes, a 19 S complex without Rpn10 was still formed, whereas cell growth was arrested. This structural dispensability but functional indispensability of Rpn10 may constitute another unique aspect of the proteasomes in T. brucei.

RNA interference rapid amplification of cDNA ends ubiquitin-interacting motif The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in eliminating short-lived and misfolded proteins in the cytosol and nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Proteasomal substrates are generally marked for destruction through covalent attachment of polyubiquitin chains catalyzed by a series of enzymes, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and the ubiquitin ligase. The ubiquitinated protein is then degraded by the 26 S proteasome in an ATP-dependent manner (1Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar, 2Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome is composed of the 20 S catalytic complex capped at one or both ends by the 19 S regulatory complex, which binds, unfolds, and translocates polyubiquitinated protein into the interior of the 20 S complex, where proteolysis occurs. The 20 S complex of eukaryotes is a barrel-shaped ring structure with seven distinct α-subunits forming the two outer α-rings and seven distinct β-subunits forming the two inner catalytic β-rings. The 19 S complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is composed of six distinct ATPase (Rpt (regulatory particle triple-A ATPase)) subunits and at least 11 non-ATPase (Rpn (regulatory particle non-ATPase)) subunits (3Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the 20 S complex, whose structure and catalytic properties have been well understood, much less is known about the structural and functional organization of the 19 S complex. Nevertheless, the relative arrangement of several 19 S subunits has been deduced through assaying the protein-protein interactions (4Ferrell K. Wilkinson C.R.M. Dubiel W. Gordon C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 83-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 5Fu H. Reis N. Lee Y. Glickman M.H. Vierstra R.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7096-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The six Rpt subunits are present in a hexamer ring structure lying on top of the α-ring and interacting with Rpn1, Rpn2, and Rpn10 to form the “base” subcomplex in S. cerevisiae, whereas the rest of the eight Rpn subunits form a “lid” subcomplex in the 19 S complex (6Glickman M.H.

Arrangement of the eight Rpn subunits in the lid was tentatively mapped by a comparative alignment with the positions of their homologs in the COP9 signalosome (7Kapelari B. Bech-Otschir D. Hegerl R. Schade R. Dumdey R. Dubiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 8Bech-Otschir D. Seeger M. Dubiel W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 467-473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A drafted structural map of the yeast 19 S complex was recently deduced from combined data on genetic interactions and protein-protein interactions among the subunits (5Fu H. Reis N. Lee Y. Glickman M.H. Vierstra R.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7096-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), although the process of assembly remains unknown. Specific functions have been assigned to only a few subunits in the yeast 19 S complex (2Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). By gene deletion analysis in S. cerevisiae (9Burns N. Grimwade B. Ross-MacDonald P.B. Choi E.Y. Finberg K. Roeder G.S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1087-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), most 19 S subunit genes were found to be essential for the yeast, with only two exceptions, RPN9 andRPN10. The Δrpn9 cells grow normally at the permissive temperature, but display a strong growth defect at the nonpermissive temperature, and are arrested at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (3Glickman M.H.

The normally growing Δrpn10/Mcb1 mutant exhibits, however, a modest sensitivity to amino acid analogs and accumulates ubiquitin-protein conjugates, suggesting that this polyubiquitin-binding protein (Rpn10) may interact with only a subset of proteasomal substrates (12van Nocker S.

Conditional yeast mutants of several other subunits of the 19 S complex display distinct cell cycle defects (13Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C.

Finley D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4909-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Therpn12-1/nin1-1 mutant is arrested at both the G1/S and G2/M boundaries with reduced Cdc28 kinase activity (16Kominami K. DeMartino G.N. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Shimbara N. Fujimuro M. Yokosawa H. Hisamatsu H. Tanahashi N. Shimizu Y. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), whereas the rpn11/Mpr1-1mutant of S. cerevisiae displays a G2/M delay and altered mitochondrial morphology (17Rinaldi T. Ricci C. Porro D. Bolotin-Fukuhara M. Frontali L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2917-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). TheSchizosaccharomyces pombe Rpn11 homolog Pad1 was found to positively regulate Pap1-dependent transcription and was implicated in the maintenance of chromosome structure (18Shimanuki M. Saka Y. Yanagida M. Toda T. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 569-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the Rpn proteins may thus have functions unrelated to the function of the 26 S proteasome, and the complete functional profile of the 19 S complex remains unclear. Trypanosoma brucei, a parasitic protozoan and a causative agent of African sleeping sickness, is generally regarded as a relatively primitive eukaryote farther removed from mammals than yeast (19Sogin M.L. Gunderson J.H. Elwood H.J. Alonso R.A. Peattie D.A. Science. 1989; 243: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Gene expression in this organism depends primarily on post-transcriptional regulation (20Berberof M. Vanhamme L. Tebabi P. Pays A. Jefferies D. Welburn S. Pays E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2925-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Functions of the proteasomes inT. brucei differ significantly from those of other eukaryotic microorganisms (21Hua S.B., To, W.-Y. Nguyen T. Wong M.L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22To W.-Y. Wang C.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For instance, trypanosomes have the activated 20 S proteasomal complex as the dominant proteasomal species (22To W.-Y. Wang C.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which is absent in all other eukaryotic microbes investigated thus far, but finds a counterpart in mammals, playing an essential role in major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation (23Preckel T.

Science. 1999; 286: 2162-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Unlike mammals, however, there are apparently only seven α- and seven β-subunits in its 20 S complex reservoir, without detectable heterogeneous isomeric forms (24Huang L. Jacob R.J. Pegg S.C.-H.

There are only two catalytically active β-subunits (β2 and β5) in the trypanosome 20 S proteasome. 1C. C. Wang, unpublished data. The recently identified 26 S proteasome from trypanosomes consists of stable 20 S and 19 S complexes, but they are readily dissociated from each other upon cell lysis (25Li Z. Zou C.-B. Yao Y.

The six Rpt proteins in the 19 S complex are highly conserved and capable of complementing the corresponding yeast mutants, with the only exception of Rpt2 (25Li Z. Zou C.-B. Yao Y.

The down-regulated expression of each of the seven α-, seven β-, and six Rpt subunits in trypanosomes by RNA interference (RNAi)2 indicated that each protein plays an essential function in the growth and viability of this organism. Apparently, the depletion of each protein cannot be replaced by any other protein in the cell (25Li Z. Zou C.-B. Yao Y. Hoyt M.A. McDonough S. Mackey Z.B. Coffino P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15486-15498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), suggesting a rather simple family of genes encoding the proteasomal complex without the isogenes, whose protein products may exchange with the existing subunits in mammalian proteasomes, resulting in a heterogeneous population (2Voges D.

The trypanosome proteasome exists in a largely homogeneous population (24Huang L. Jacob R.J. Pegg S.C.-H. Baldwin M.A. Wang C.C. Burlingame A.L. Babbitt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28327-28339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which is also reflected by results from RNAi (25Li Z. Zou C.-B. Yao Y. Hoyt M.A. McDonough S.

It has the potential of being a simple model like the one from yeast for further in-depth investigation. In this study, we have identified and isolated the 11 full-length Rpn subunit genes from T. brucei and disrupted their expression individually to determine the effects on cell cycle progression, cell viability, and assembly of the 19 S complex. In contrast to observations obtained with yeast, each Rpn protein in T. brucei was found to be essential for cell viability. With the only exception of Rpn10, depletion of each of the other 10 Rpn proteins in trypanosomes disrupted also formation of the 19 S complex. The procyclic form of T. brucei strain 29-13, which contains the genes expressing T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline repressor (28Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. Paul T. Englund (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Atlanta Biologicals, Inc. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against α-tubulin and ubiquitin were purchased from Sigma and Zymed Laboratories Inc., respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antiserum against rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antiserum against mouse IgG, [35S]methionine, and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B were fromAmersham Biosciences. Protease inhibitor mixtures were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other chemicals used in this study were of the highest purity commercially available. Procyclic T. brucei cells were cultivated at 26 °C in Cunningham's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. G418 (15 μg/ml) and hygromycin B (50 μg/ml) were added to the culture medium to maintain the T7 RNA polymerase and tetracycline repressor gene constructs within the cells. Partial genomic sequences of the 11 T. brucei Rpn homologs were identified in the TIGR Trypanosome Genome Project Sequence Databases 3Available at www.tigr.org/tdb/mdb/tbdb/index.shtml. by the BLAST search program using the yeast RPN genes as queries. Based on the partial sequence information, gene-specific primers 4Sequence information is available upon request. were designed and employed in reverse transcription-PCRs for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). First-strand cDNAs were generated from the total RNA of T. brucei with an oligo(dT)15-adaptor primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. 5′-RACE was performed using a gene-specific antisense primer in combination with the splice leader sequence (TTAGAACAGTTTCTGTACTATATTG) known as the 5′-end of all mRNAs in T. brucei (29Campbell D.A. Thornton D.A. Boothroyd J.C. Nature. 1984; 311: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). 3′-RACE was carried out using a gene-specific sense primer in combination with the adaptor primer, which was introduced into cDNA during reverse transcription. The PCR fragments thus synthesized were cloned into the pGEM-T-easy vector (Promega) for sequencing. A pair of specific primers were then designed based on the sequence data and used to amplify the full-length cDNA, which was then sequenced for complete open reading frame identification. The 11 full-length T. brucei Rpn cDNAs were each amplified by PCR, and the encoded recombinant proteins were expressed with an added N-terminal His6 tag in Escherichia coli strain M15 cells using the pQE30 vector (QIAGEN Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. The recombinant Rpn proteins, expressed mostly as inclusion bodies in the transformedE. coli cell lysate, were each dissolved in 8 murea and purified through a Ni2+-agarose column (QIAGEN Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. The purified proteins, with their purity verified by SDS-PAGE (data not shown), were used to produce polyclonal antibodies in rabbit (Animal Pharm Services Inc., Healdsburg, CA). Only the antibodies against T. brucei Rpn10 and Rpn11 have now become available and were used in this investigation. Partial cDNA fragments (300∼500 bp in length) of the 11 T. brucei RPN genes were each amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers with XhoI andHindIII linkers4 and subcloned into the pZJM vector (30Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) by replacing the α-tubulin stuffer. For the control plasmid, the pZJM vector was digested withXhoI/HindIII, end-blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, and self-ligated. The construct was linearized with NotI so that it could be integrated into the rDNA spacer region of the T. brucei chromosome. Transfection of T. brucei by electroporation was essentially performed according to our previous procedures (25Li Z. Zou C.-B. Yao Y. Hoyt M.A. McDonough S. Mackey Z.B. Coffino P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15486-15498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The transfectants were selected with 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin and cloned by limiting dilution. For induction of RNAi, stable transfectants were cultured in the presence of 1.0 μg/ml tetracycline. Cell numbers were counted at different timed intervals using a hemocytometer. Total RNA was extracted from T. brucei cells using the TRIzol reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Thirty μg of total RNA was denatured, separated on 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Northern hybridization was carried out overnight at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1× Denhardt's solution, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. After stripping the probes, the same blots were rehybridized with an α-tubulin gene fragment to ensure equal RNA sample loading. For immunoblotting, 12.5 or 8.5% acrylamide gels following SDS-PAGE were blotted and stained as previously described (25Li Z. Zou C.-B. Yao Y. Hoyt M.A. McDonough S. Mackey Z.B. Coffino P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15486-15498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, T. brucei cells were incubated in methionine-free medium for 1 h and labeled with [35S]methionine (50 μCi/ml) at 26 °C for 4 h. The labeled cells were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, and 100 mm NaCl) and incubated in lysis buffer (25 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) for 30 min on ice. The cleared lysate, pre-absorbed with rabbit preimmune serum and protein A-Sepharose beads, was incubated with rabbit antiserum against T. brucei Rpt3 (25Li Z. Zou C.-B. Yao Y. Hoyt M.A. McDonough S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 15486-15498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) at 4 °C for 1 h and precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates thus collected were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the dried gels were autoradiographed. T. brucei cells were lysed by sonication in buffer A (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmATP, 1 mm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 20% glycerol, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 80,000 × g for 60 min. The proteasomal complexes, collected by an additional centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, were resuspended in buffer A containing 5% glycerol, with insoluble materials removed by centrifugation at 80,000 × g for 30 min. The cleared supernatant was overlaid on top of a stepwise gradient of 15∼50% glycerol and centrifuged in a Beckman TLS55 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 16 h. Fractions were collected dropwise from the bottom of the tube, separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunostained with the appropriate antibodies. The fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of propidium iodide-stained trypanosome cells was carried out as described previously (31Mutomba M.C., To, W.-Y. Hyun W.C. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, T. bruceicells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in ethanol at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were washed twice and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline. DNase-free RNase (10 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (20 μg/ml) were added to the suspension and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The DNA content of the propidium iodide-stained cells was analyzed with a FACScan analytical flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The percentage of cells in the G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell cycle was determined using ModFitLT Version 3.0 Software (BD Biosciences). The partial nucleotide sequences encoding 11 distinct T. brucei Rpn homologs were identified in the TIGR Trypanosome Genome Project Sequence Databases by the BLAST program using the 11 yeastRPN gene sequences as queries. Based on these partial sequences, Rpn-specific primers were designed and employed in 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions for the remainder of the 5′- and 3′-sequences in each of the 11 RPN genes. A pair of primers encompassing the entire coding region were designed and used to amplify the full-length cDNA of each of the 11 Rpn homologs, resulting in the cloning and sequencing of each of the 11 full-length Rpn cDNAs.

https://openalex.org/W2117529901,"We have investigated the role of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase gene (pkr) in the regulation of the heat shock response. We show that the pkr gene is essential for efficient activation of the heat shock response and that pkr disruption profoundly inhibits heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) synthesis and blocks the development of thermotolerance. Despite these profound effects, pkr disruption did not markedly affect the activation of heat shock factor 1 by heat and did not reduce the rate of transcription of the HSP70 gene after heat shock. However, despite the lack of effect of pkr disruption on HSP70 gene transcription, we found a significant decrease in the expression of HSP70 mRNA in pkr-/- cells after heat shock. Kinetic studies of mRNA turnover suggested a block in the thermal stabilization of HSP70 mRNA in pkr-/- cells. As the thermal stabilization of HSP70 mRNA is thought to involve cis-acting A+U rich (ARE) elements in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR), we examined a potential role for pkr in this process. We found that a reporter beta-galactosidase mRNA destabilized by introduction of a functional ARE into the 3'-UTR became stabilized by heat but only in cells containing an intact pkr gene. Our studies suggest therefore that pkr plays a significant role in the stabilization of mRNA species containing ARE destruction sequences in the 3'-UTR and through this mechanism, contributes to the regulation of the heat shock response and other processes."

Two subunits, TAP1 and TAP2, are necessary and sufficient for peptide binding and peptide translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. TAP1 and TAP2 contain an N-terminal hydrophobic membrane-spanning region and a C-terminal nucleotide binding domain. Tapasin is an endoplasmic reticulum resident protein that has been found associated with the TAP subunits and shown to increase expression levels of TAP. Here we investigated TAP-tapasin interactions and their effects on TAP function in insect cells. We show tapasin binding to both TAP1 and TAP2 and to the corresponding nucleotide binding domain-exchanged chimeras as well as to a truncated TAP1·TAP2 complex containing just the membrane-spanning regions of TAP1 and TAP2. However, tapasin interactions with either the truncated TAP construct containing just the nucleotide binding domain are not observed. Tapasin is not required for high affinity peptide binding to TAP1·TAP2 complexes, and in fact, the presence of tapasin slightly reduces the affinity of TAP complexes for peptides. However, at near physiological temperatures, both tapasin and nucleotides stabilize the peptide binding site of TAP1·TAP2 complexes against inactivation, and enhanced thermostability of both TAP subunits is observed in the presence of tapasin.

Peptides bound within a groove of the MHC class I heavy chain are presented to CD8 T lymphocytes (1Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) for immune surveillance against intracellular pathogens as well as some exogenous pathogens. Many class I-associated peptides are derived from proteasome-mediated proteolysis of cytosolic proteins. These peptides are translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). Subsequently, the peptides become bound to MHC class I heavy chain-β2microglobulin complexes (1Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The transport of peptides is an essential step, and hence, TAP is a primary component of the antigen presentation pathway (2Abele R. Tampe R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 68: 191-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assembly of peptides with newly synthesized class I molecules is assisted by many proteins. These include calreticulin (a chaperone), ERp57 (a thiol-dependent oxidoreductase), and tapasin. These components together with TAP and the MHC class I subunits, constitute a large complex called the “MHC class I peptide-loading complex” (4Cresswell P. Bangia N. Dick T. Diedrich G. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Upon binding to peptides, class I molecules are released from the assembly complex and transit to the cell surface (1Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). TAP comprises two subunits, TAP1 and TAP2, both of which are required for the transport function. Each subunit has one C-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and one N-terminal transmembrane region with several membrane-spanning domains (MSRs) (for review, see Refs. 2Abele R. Tampe R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar and3Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 68: 191-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TAP catalyzes transport of peptides across the ER membrane in an ATP-dependent manner. A broad range of peptides (9–15 amino acids in length) is translocated by TAP (2Abele R. Tampe R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 68: 191-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functions of TAP can be broken down as (i) sequestration of antigenic peptides on the cytosolic face of the ER membrane and (ii) binding and hydrolysis of ATP, which powers translocation of peptides across the ER membrane. At low temperatures, peptide binding to TAP does not require exogenous ATP (5Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P.

ATP is essential for peptide translocation by TAP, and non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs do not support peptide translocation (9Neefjes J.J. Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Science. 1993; 261: 769-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Tapasin is an ER-resident 48-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein found associated with TAP1·TAP2 complexes (10Li S. Sjogren H.O.

The presence of tapasin in mammalian cells increases expression levels of the TAP proteins (14Lehner P.J. Surman M.J. Cresswell P.

Lehner P.J. Hughes E.A. Surman M. Cresswell P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1858-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Tapasin also interacts with MHC class I molecules via residues in its N terminus (13Bangia N. Lehner P.J. Hughes E.A. Surman M. Cresswell P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1858-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Optimal peptide loading of many MHC class I molecules requires the presence of tapasin (for review, see Ref. 15Grandea III, A.G. Van Kaer L. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 194-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which tapasin enhances MHC-peptide assembly have been suggested to be distinct from the effect of tapasin on TAP function (14Lehner P.J. Surman M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The goals of the analyses described here were to investigate the interactions of tapasin with TAP subunits and domains, to study the effects of tapasin on TAP functions in peptide binding and translocation, and also to investigate the effect of tapasin on TAP complex stability. Using insect cell-reconstituted proteins, we analyzed binary interactions between tapasin and the TAP subunits and domains. Our studies provide evidence for tapasin interactions with the MSR of both TAP subunits and implicate tapasin in maintaining TAP complex stability at physiological temperatures. Baculoviruses encoding wild type TAP1 and TAP2 constructs were obtained from the Tampe lab (16Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampe R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Human TAP1 and TAP2 cDNAs for the other TAP constructs described here were obtained from Dr. John Trowsdale. Baculovirus constructs encoding the TAP chimeras (T1MT2C and T2MT1C) were previously described and contain residues 1–541 of TAP1 and 507–686 of TAP2 (T1MT2C) and residues 1–506 of TAP2 and 542–748 of TAP1 (T2MT1C), respectively (17Arora S. Lapinski P.E. Raghavan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7241-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Baculoviruses encoding the TAP membrane-spanning domains were made as follows. T1M encodes residues 1–471 of TAP1, tagged with an AU1 epitope tag on the N terminus. T2M encompasses residues 1–432 of TAP2, tagged with an AU5 epitope tag on the N terminus. PCR was used to engineer both constructs. The 5′ primers contained a BamHI site and a sequence encoding the AU1 tag and a BglII site and a sequence encoding the AU5 tag for generating T1M and T2M, respectively. The 3′ primers contained a stop codon at the desired locations and BamHI (for T1M) andBglII (for T2M) sites. The PCR products were ligated into pPCRscript (Stratagene), sequenced, and then excised and ligated into the BamHI and BglII sites of the baculovirus transfer vector pAcUW51 (Pharmingen), respectively. This vector was co-transfected with BaculoGold DNA (Pharmingen) into insect cells as described in the Pharmingen Baculovirus Expression Manual. Pure virus was isolated using plaque assays and further amplified by re-infection. TAP NBD constructs T1Ctr (residues 472–748 of TAP1) and T2Ctr (residues 433–686 of TAP2) were made as described previously (18Lapinski P.E. Miller G.G. Tampe R. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6831-6840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) but in a single virus. T1Ctr has a C-terminal hexahistidine tag, whereas the T2Ctr has a C-terminal Myc epitope tag. The T1Ctr-encoding construct that had been ligated into the BamHI site of pAcUW51 was excised and re-ligated into the BamHI site of pAcUW51, which had the T2Ctr-encoding construct cloned into theBglII site. Baculoviruses encoding both NBD constructs in a single virus were generated using this vector. The peptide translocation assays used an enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged version of TAP1 (TAP1-eGFP). The TAP1-eGFP fusion was constructed by bridge PCR. The first PCR amplified the TAP1 portion of the fusion construct using a 5′ primer with a BamHI site followed by a sequence complementary to the 5′ end of TAP1 and a 3′ primer with the last 15 nucleotides of the TAP1 sequence and the first 15 nucleotides of the eGFP sequence. The eGFP template was obtained from the pEGFP plasmid (Clontech). The second PCR used a 5′ primer that was complementary to the 3′ primer used for TAP1 amplification and a 3′ primer complementary to the 3′ end of the eGFP sequence followed by a BamHI site. Both these PCR products were gel-extracted and used as templates for a third PCR, which used the 5′ primer of the TAP1 PCR and the 3′ primer of the eGFP PCR. This bridge PCR product was gel-extracted, ligated into pPCRScript (Stratagene), and sequenced. The TAP1-eGFP fusion was then ligated into pAcUW51 (Pharmingen), which was used to generate virus. Human tapasin cDNA was obtained from Dr. Ping Wang (10Li S. Sjogren H.O. Hellman U. Pettersson R.F. Wang P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8708-8713Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). PCR was used to introduce BamHI sites on the 5′ and 3′ ends. The modified cDNA was ligated into pPCRscript, sequenced, and cloned into the BamHI site of the pAcUW51 vector. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated as described above. Cells were infected with multiple baculoviruses at multiplicity of infection levels between 1 and 80, established to optimize expression levels of proteins that were being analyzed. After 60 h of infection, the supernatants were removed and replaced with 2.5 ml of Grace's insect medium without l-methionine (Invitrogen) but containing 105 μCi of 35S-labeled methionine/cysteine (ICN). After incubation at 26 °C for 45 min, 3.5 ml of methionine-free Grace's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum was added, and cells were incubated overnight at 26 °C. For immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed on ice in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer, 10 mmTris, 130 mm NaCl, 1% digitonin, pH 7.5) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.308 μm aprotinin, 10.5 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, 1 mm benzamidine) for 1 h. Immunoprecipitation protocols were similar to those previously described (6Lapinski P.E. Neubig R.R. Raghavan M. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 7241-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) due to the presence of a C-terminal histidine tag. Cells were infected with appropriate baculoviruses (TAP1, TAP2 or TAP1, TAP2, tapasin) at multiplicity of infection values of 1–80 depending on the desired protein expression levels. To achieve equal levels of expression of TAP subunits in the presence or absence of tapasin, the multiplicity of infection values were typically lower for the TAP viruses when co-infected with the tapasin virus compared with that used in the TAP virus infections alone. Protocols for microsome preparations were similar to those described by Meyeret al. (16Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampe R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). TAP and tapasin expression in the microsomes was verified by immunoblotting analyses of the microsome preparations (6Lapinski P.E. Neubig R.R. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7526-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For this analysis, membranes were incubated in 15 ml of antibody buffer containing 50 μl of 148.3 hybridoma supernatant (16Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampe R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), 10 μl of 435.3 ascites fluid (20van Endert P.M. Tampe R. Meyer T.H. Tisch R. Bach J.F. McDevitt H.O. Immunity. 1994; 1: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and 7 μl of anti-tapasin antiserum (13Bangia N. Lehner P.J. Hughes E.A. Surman M. Cresswell P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1858-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Iodinated peptide-based translocation experiments with the model peptide RR[125I]YNASTEL were performed exactly as described (6Lapinski P.E. Neubig R.R. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7526-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The peptide binding assays with fluorescent peptides first described by Neumann and Tampe (21Neumann L. Tampe R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1203-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were carried out using procedures established in our laboratory with the model fluorescent peptide RRYQKCFITCTEL (6Lapinski P.E. Neubig R.R. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7526-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Different concentrations of the inhibitor peptides (5 nm to 500 μm) were mixed with a known concentration (40 nm) of RRYQKCFITCTEL, and the fluorescence emission signal was allowed to stabilize. 20 μl of microsomes expressing either TAP1·TAP2 or TAP1·TAP2-tapasin were added, and the decrease in fluorescence signal was monitored until the signal stabilized. The magnitude of quenching was calculated as described (6Lapinski P.E. Neubig R.R. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7526-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Fluorescence quenching was also monitored in the absence of added inhibitor peptide. The magnitude of the quenching signal was plotted as a function of the logarithm of the inhibitor peptide concentration. EC50 values were obtained by fitting the curve to a one-site competition equation using GraphPad Prism software. Microsomes expressing TAP1·TAP2 or TAP1·TAP2-tapasin were incubated for 1 h at 34 or 4 °C after which both sets of microsomes were incubated for 15 min on ice. Both sets of microsomes were tested for their ability to quench the fluorescence of 40 nmRRYQKCFITCTEL by estimating the quenching amplitudes. Similar sets of analyses were carried out in the absence of added exogenous nucleotide, or in the presence of 1 mm ATP, or 1 mm ADP, or 0.03 units/μl apyrase. Data were analyzed in two different ways. For each set of microsomes at 34 and 4 °C, the ratios of the quenching amplitudes in the presence of ATP relative to those obtained in the presence of no nucleotide, ADP, and apyrase were calculated. Second, for each nucleotide condition, the ratio of the quenching amplitude obtained at 34 °C was calculated relative to that obtained at 4 °C. Cells infected with baculoviruses encoding TAP1eGFP, TAP2 or TAP1eGFP, TAP2, tapasin combinations were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (ICN) 60 h post-infection as described above. 72 h post-infection, cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 1 h at 4 or 34 °C in peptide binding assay buffer (5 mm dithiothreitol in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4). Lysis of the cells was carried out in 1% digitonin for 1 h. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-TAP2 or anti-tapasin antisera as described above or with anti-GFP (Covance Scientific; 1 μl/immunoprecipitation). A control antibody (anti-Myc) was also used for the TAP1-eGFP·TAP2 infections. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by phosphorimaging analyses. The intensity of the bands corresponding to the TAP1-eGFP, TAP2, and tapasin were quantified using ImageQuant software. Ratios of the relative intensities of TAP1 at 4 and 34 °C were quantified for the anti-GFP and anti-tapasin-based immunoprecipitations. Ratios of the relative intensities of TAP2 at 4 and 34 °C were quantified for the anti-TAP2 and anti-tapasin-based immunoprecipitations. Metabolic labeling experiments were carried out to assess complex formation between TAP subunits or chimeras and tapasin. We infected Sf21 cells with baculoviruses encoding TAP subunits (TAP1, TAP2) or chimeras T1MT2C (which encodes the MSR of TAP1 and NBD of TAP2) and T2MT1C (which encodes the MSR of TAP2 and NBD of TAP1) in combination with tapasin. To establish complex formation between TAP subunits and tapasin, digitonin lysates of metabolically labeled cells from the different infections were immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against the TAP subunit, tapasin, or an irrelevant antibody control. Cells were lysed in 1% digitonin because interactions between TAP and tapasin are weak and are unstable in other detergents (12Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates using appropriate antibodies and separated by SDS-PAGE, and associating proteins were visualized. TAP-tapasin interactions could be best visualized by immunoprecipitations with an antiserum directed against residues in the cytoplasmic domain of tapasin (13Bangia N. Lehner P.J. Hughes E.A. Surman M. Cresswell P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1858-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (Fig.1, A–D, lane 3). In general, the anti-TAP antisera-based immunoprecipitations were more difficult to assess due to the presence of nonspecific bands that co-migrated in the vicinity of tapasin (Fig. 1, A–C,lane 5; highlighted withasterisks). We observed that TAP1 co-immunoprecipitated with tapasin in analyses with the anti-tapasin antibody (Fig. 1 A, lane 3(co-infection) compared with lane 2 (single infection with tapasin-encoding virus)). A nonspecific band (labeled as such) was also observed in all the immunoprecipitations with the anti-tapasin antibody. T1MT2C interaction with tapasin could also be visualized by the anti-tapasin immunoprecipitations (Fig. 1 B; lane 3 (co-infection) compared with lane 2 (single infection with tapasin-encoding virus)), although the presence of a band corresponding to T1MT2C in the control lanes 1 and6 suggests that there may be a low level of nonspecific precipitation of T1MT2C. Complex formation between TAP2 and tapasin was apparent in the analysis shown in Fig. 1 C by immunoprecipitations with both anti-tapasin (Fig. 1 C,lane 3 (co-infection) compared with lane 2(single infection with tapasin-encoding virus)) and anti-TAP2 antisera (Fig. 1 C, lane 4 (co-infection) compared withlane 5 (single infection with TAP2)). Likewise, complex formation between T2MT1C and tapasin was apparent in immunoprecipitations with both anti-tapasin (Fig. 1 D,lane 3 (co-infection) compared with lane 2(single infection with tapasin-encoding virus)) and anti-his antibodies (Fig. 1 D, lane 4 (co-infection) compared withlane 5 (single infection with T2MT1C)). To study the association of the MSRs or NBDs of the TAP subunits with tapasin, constructs encoding TAP membrane-spanning domains (T1M and T2M, respectively, of TAP1 and TAP2) alone or NBDs alone (T1Ctr and T2Ctr, respectively, of TAP1 and TAP2) were generated. The NBD constructs have been previously described (18Lapinski P.E. Miller G.G. Tampe R. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6831-6840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The construct with the TAP1 transmembrane regions (T1M) has an AU1 epitope at its N terminus and can be recognized by an anti-AU1 antibody. The TAP2 counterpart (T2M) has an N-terminal AU5 tag that can be recognized by an anti-AU5 antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses with anti-AU1 and anti-AU5 antibodies of cells infected with a baculovirus encoding both T1M and T2M revealed the presence of 2 proteins of ∼40 kDa (Fig.2 A, lanes 1 and2). Based upon the expected size, we predicted that the larger protein was T1M. Consistent with this expectation, more of the higher molecular weight protein was visualized in the AU1 immunoprecipitations compared with the AU5 immunoprecipitations. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses suggested that both T1M and T2M associated and that T2M was expressed in excess relative to T1M (Fig.2 A, lanes 1 and 2). Thus, the membrane-spanning domains of TAP1 and TAP2 associate even in the absence of the NBD, consistent with previous observations implicating membrane-spanning residues of TAP1 and TAP2 in the TAP1·TAP2 interaction interface (22Vos J.C. Spee P. Momburg F. Neefjes J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6679-6685PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the TAP NBDs do not form stable complexes under the conditions of these assays as previously demonstrated (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 3) (18Lapinski P.E. Miller G.G. Tampe R. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6831-6840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To investigate interactions of TAP MSRs and NBDs with tapasin, cells were co-infected with baculoviruses encoding tapasin along with viruses encoding the TAP MSR (T1M/T2M) or NBD (T1Ctr/T2Ctr). Metabolically labeled cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-AU1, anti-AU5, anti-tapasin, or irrelevant antibodies for MSR interactions with tapasin or with anti-His, anti-Myc, anti-tapasin, or irrelevant antibodies for NBD interactions with tapasin. For the former set of experiments, the anti-tapasin immunoprecipitation revealed tapasin and T2M as well as a faint signal for T1M, indicative of complex formation (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). The low signal for T1M compared with T2M is likely due to the reduced expression of T1M relative to T2M. The ratio of T1M/T2M intensities in the anti-tapasin immunoprecipitation was roughly in proportion to the levels at which the proteins were expressed. Tapasin-specific signals were also visualized in the anti-AU1 and anti-AU5-based immunoprecipitations. By contrast to the detectable interaction between T1M/T2M and tapasin, binding was not observable between either T1Ctr and tapasin and/or T2Ctr and tapasin in immunoprecipitations with anti-His, anti-Myc, or anti-tapasin antibodies (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1–3, respectively). Our observations that T1Ctr and T2Ctr cannot be co-immunoprecipitated with tapasin do not preclude the possibility that TAP NBD residues of intact TAP1·TAP2 complexes participate in TAP-tapasin interactions; rather, our data suggest that residues contained in TAP1 and TAP2 NBD are not sufficient to mediate stable binding to tapasin under the conditions of the analyses (Fig.2 C). Because T2Ctr in particular is quite unstable in solution, 2P. E. Lapinski and M. Raghavan, unpublished observations. we cannot exclude the formal possibility that folding constraints in the NBD account for the lack of observable interactions with tapasin. Tapasin-deficient 721.220 cells, when transfected with tapasin, show increased steady state levels of the TAP1 protein (14Lehner P.J. Surman M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This increase in TAP expression level quantitatively enhanced the amount of peptide translocated without increasing the intrinsic rate of peptide translocation (13Bangia N. Lehner P.J. Hughes E.A.

Previous work with homotetrameric β-glycosidase from hyperthermophilic Sulfolobus solfataricus (M r 226,760) has shown that addition of 0.05–0.1% SDS was associated with minimal secondary structure perturbations and increased activity. This work addresses the effects of SDS on β-glycosidase quaternary structure. In 0.1–1% SDS, the enzyme was dimeric, as determined by Ferguson analysis of transverse-gradient polyacrylamide gels. The catalytic activity of the β-glycosidase dimer in SDS was determined by in-gel assay. A minor decrease of thermal stability in SDS was observed after exposure to temperatures up to 80 °C for 1 h. An analysis of β-glycosidase crystal structure showed different changes in solvent-accessible surface area on going from the tetramer to the two possible dimers (A-C and A-D). Energy minimization and molecular dynamics calculations showed that the A-C dimer, exhibiting the lowest exposed surface area, was more stabilized by a network of polar interactions. The charge distribution around the A-C interface was characterized by a local short range anisotropy, resulting in an unfavorable interaction with SDS. This paper provides a detailed description of an SDS-resistant inter-monomeric interface, which may help understand similar interfaces involved in important biological processes. β-Glycosidases are fundamental, widely conserved enzymes.

Enzymes from hyperthermophiles are interesting for the possible biotechnological applications of their unusual stability toward a number of perturbing agents, including extremes of temperature, pH, ionic strength, and detergents. In particular, the structural determinants of protein resistance to denaturation and dissociation by SDS have recently become the focus of increasing attention, as SDS-resistant intermolecular interactions have been identified within the context of important biological functions. A correlation was found between the SDS stability of different heterodimeric products of the major histocompatibility complex class II polymorphic genes of the HLA complex and susceptibility to important human autoimmune diseases, such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) 1The abbreviations used are: IDDM, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; Aβ, amyloid-β; AD, Alzheimer's disease; apoE, apolipoprotein E; EM, energy minimization; MD, molecular dynamics; PDB, Protein Data Bank; PNPG, p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside; SAS, solvent-accessible surface; Sβgly, S. solfataricusβ-glycosidase; T, total acrylamide; C, N,N′-methylene-bis-acrylamide, as percent of total acrylamide; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (1Ettinger R.A.

Moreover, the isoform-specific formation of SDS-stable complexes was observed between amyloid-β (Aβ), a major component of extracellular senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the apolipoproteins apoE2 and apoE3 but not with apoE4, which is present with increased frequency in patients with sporadic and late-onset familial AD, and is considered a risk factor for the disease (2LaDu M.J.

Investigations of the mechanistic basis of these SDS-stable interactions have pinpointed some of the critical amino acid residues and the interactions involved (4Ettinger R.A. Liu A.W. Nepom G.T.

Proteins from hyperthermophilic organisms are ideally suited for the study of the structural determinants of protein stability, in view of their physicochemical resistance, higher phylogenetic proximity to eukaryotic enzymes, in comparison with prokaryotic counterparts, and high yields in recombinant expression systems. Among these, β-glycosidase from the hyperthermophilic Archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus (Sβgly) strain MT4 (8Nucci R. Moracci M. Vaccaro C. Vespa N. Rossi M. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1993; 17: 239-250PubMed Google Scholar) is one of the best characterized. It is a member of a large superfamily of enzymes, widely conserved among animals, plants, Archaea, and bacteria, some of which are responsible for the pathogenesis of important human diseases (9Schiffmann R. Brady R.O. Drugs. 2002; 62: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Sβgly is a homotetramer of four, non-covalently linked, identical subunits, each having a relative molecular mass of 56,690. It is highly thermostable, having a t12 of 85 h at 75 °C. The native enzyme has been crystallized, and its structure has been resolved at 2.6 Å (10Aguilar C.F. Sanderson I. Moracci M. Ciaramella M. Nucci R. Rossi M. Pearl L.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), consisting of a (β/α)8 barrel, typical of enzymes of glycosylhydrolase family 1 (11Henrissat B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the exposure of Sβgly to SDS in the concentration range of 0.05–0.1% resulted in an increase of its enzymatic activity at room temperature (12Nucci R. D'Auria S. Febbraio F. Vaccaro C. Morana A., De Rosa M. Rossi M. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1995; 21: 265-274Google Scholar). CD spectra in the far-UV region and infrared spectroscopy at pH 10.0 showed negligible effects of SDS on the secondary structure of the enzyme, whereas more significant changes were observed in the protein tertiary structure by near-UV CD analysis (13D'Auria S. Barone R. Rossi M. Nucci R. Barone G. Fessas D. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to investigate the consequences of the interaction of Sβgly with SDS at the level of its quaternary structure, activity, and thermostability. Ferguson analysis of polyacrylamide gels in SDS clearly documented that the enzyme in SDS dissociated into dimers, which were shown to be fully active and to retain most of the thermal stability of the native tetrameric enzyme. Calculations of the solvent-accessible surfaces, as well as energy minimization (EM) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the possible oligomerization states of Sβgly, based on the crystal structure of the tetrameric enzyme (10Aguilar C.F. Sanderson I. Moracci M. Ciaramella M. Nucci R. Rossi M. Pearl L.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), indicated that the interface between A-C (and B-D) monomers was stabilized by a network of polar interactions, characterized by an unfavorable interaction with SDS. On the basis of these observations, Sβgly can be envisioned as a dimer of SDS-resistant dimers. The detailed description presented of such an SDS-resistant inter-monomeric interface may be useful, on a comparative basis, for our understanding of similar inter-subunit and protein-protein interfaces involved in important biological processes and for protein engineering purposes. Homogeneous Sβgly was prepared as described previously (8Nucci R. Moracci M. Vaccaro C. Vespa N. Rossi M. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1993; 17: 239-250PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration was estimated by the optical absorbance at 280 nm, using a molar extinction coefficient of 9.5 × 105 cm−1 (8Nucci R. Moracci M. Vaccaro C. Vespa N. Rossi M. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1993; 17: 239-250PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity was measured using 4 mm p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (PNPG) as the substrate in a 1-ml final volume of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 405 nm. All the enzymatic assays were carried out in a thermostated Cary 1 spectrophotometer (Varian, Australia) at the temperature of 75 °C (8Nucci R. Moracci M. Vaccaro C. Vespa N. Rossi M. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1993; 17: 239-250PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic constants of Sβgly were measured in the temperature range from 30 to 80 °C (by stepwise increases of 10 °C), using PNPG concentrations in the range 0.1–20 mm in 1-ml reaction mixtures containing 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, in the presence or absence of 0.1% SDS. The experimental data were analyzed by using the data analysis and graphics program “Grafit” (Erithacus Software Ltd.). Thermal stability of Sβgly was measured incubating 0.41 μm of the homogeneous enzyme in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, at temperatures ranging from 30 to 80 °C (by stepwise increases of 10 °C) in a thermostated water bath, in the presence and absence of 0.1% SDS. At time intervals, aliquots containing 4.1 pmol of enzyme were withdrawn from the incubation mixture and assayed at 75 °C under the conditions described. SDS-PAGE was performed using the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), in a Hoefer SE 600 vertical slab gel apparatus. A linear vertical gradient gel, containing 4–10% total acrylamide (T), 2.7%N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (C, expressed as percent of total acrylamide), in 0.375 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, 0.1% SDS, was polymerized on a sheet of Gelbond PAG plastic backing (Bio-Whittaker). The acrylamide stock contained 29.8% (w/v) acrylamide, 0.2% (w/v) N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, and 1% (v/v) AcrylAide (Bio-Whittaker) to allow covalent bonding to the Gelbond PAG. Stacking gels contained 3.75% T, 0.125 mTris/HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS. Sβgly was dissolved in 0.01m Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 0.7 mβ-mercaptoethanol, 1.36 m glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue as tracking dye, with or without heating in a boiling water bath for 1 min. The electrode buffer contained 0.025 m Tris base, 0.19 m glycine, pH 8.2. Electrophoresis was conducted at 15 °C at 10 mA for 16 h. The following High Molecular Weight Standards for SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad) were used as calibration proteins (relative molecular masses in parentheses): skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain (205,000), Escherichia coli β-galactosidase (116,000), phosphorylase b (94,000), bovine serum albumin (67,000), ovalbumin (45,000), and carbonic anhydrase (30,000). The gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 25% (v/v) 2-propanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid, destained in 25% (v/v) methanol, 10% acetic acid, equilibrated in 0.7 m glycerol, and air-dried. Linear transverse-gradient polyacrylamide gels were prepared as described (15Gentile F. Veneziani B.M. Sellitto C. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), using a Hoefer SE 600 vertical slab gel apparatus. A linear vertical gradient was cast between two 160 × 180-mm glass plates positioned on one of their short sides as the base. After polymerization, the gel was turned 90° counterclockwise, so that the gradient was now perpendicular to the direction of electrophoresis (Fig. 2, panel A). The glass plates were held apart by three 1.5-mm-thick spacers as follows: a 20-mm-wide spacer along the base, to be left in place when turning the gel; a 20-mm-wide spacer on the right, to be removed when turning the gel in order to form a sample trough on the top of the gel and to be inserted at what was to become the left side of the gel; and a 10 mm-wide spacer on the left, to be removed upon turning the gel in order to leave an empty trough below the gel. The gels were polymerized on a sheet of Gelbond PAG adhering to one of the glass plates. The acrylamide stock contained 29.2% (w/v) acrylamide, 0.8% (w/v) N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide as cross-linker, without AcrylAide. Linear transverse-gradient gels containing 4–9% T from left to right, 2.7% C, in 0.375 mTris/HCl, pH 8.8, 0.1% SDS, were made from two solutions with compositions of the ends of the desired gradient, with the aid of a two-chamber gradient mixer. No stacking gel was used, but a sample gel containing 3.75% T in electrode buffer was created by positioning a plastic comb in the sample trough on top of the gel, 1 mm apart from the upper side of the gel. For electrophoresis in SDS, reference standards and Sβgly were subjected to electrophoresis altogether in alternate lanes of a couple of identical 20-lane gels. The electrode buffer contained 0.025 m Tris base, 0.19 mglycine, pH 8.2. Sβgly was dissolved in 0.01 m Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol, 1.36m glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue as tracking dye, without boiling. Native linear transverse-gradient polyacrylamide gels containing 4–7% T, 2.7% C, in 0.187 mTris/H2SO4, pH 9.0, were prepared in a similar manner, according to Neville (16Neville D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6328-6334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For electrophoresis in native conditions, reference standards and Sβgly were subjected individually to electrophoresis on a couple of identical 15-lane gels. The electrode buffer contained 0.065 m Tris base, 0.031 mboric acid, pH 9.3. Sβgly was dissolved in electrode buffer containing 1.36 m glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue. Both SDS and native electrophoresis were conducted at 15 °C at 10 mA, until the dye front reached the lower end on the left side of the gels. The gels were stained as described for analytical gels in SDS, equilibrated in 0.7 m glycerol, and dried under vacuum. The relative molecular mass (M) of Sβgly was determined by indirect comparison of the relative mobilities (R m) of Sβgly and those of calibration proteins, after electrophoresis in a linear transverse-gradient polyacrylamide gel. To determine theR m of a protein, its migration distance from the top of the separating gel to the center of the protein band (R p) was divided by the migration distance of the bromphenol blue tracking dye (R d). The %T along the linear transverse-gradient polyacrylamide gel was calculated by Equation 1, %T=(9.0(or7.0)−4.0)×D/W+4.0(Eq. 1) where W is the distance between the 4.0% T edge and the other edge (9.0% or 7.0%) of the gel, and D is the distance between the 4.0% T edge of the gel and the center of the protein zone. All distances were measured directly on the gels layered onto a square millimeter division; distances were read to the nearest 0.5 mm. From the R m values determined for each protein at different polyacrylamide concentrations, a Ferguson plot (100 × log(R m × 100) versus %T) was constructed (10 points per gel, 20 points per plot for gels in SDS; 15 points per gel, 30 points per plot for native gels), and the slope (retardation coefficient, K r) was calculated by least square regression analysis, using %T as the argument. For the calibration proteins, the relationship between relative molecular mass and K r, namely log M and log K r, was calculated by least square regression analysis, using log M as the argument. On the basis of this relationship and the measuredK r of Sβgly, the relative molecular mass of Sβgly was determined. The reference proteins used for the construction of Ferguson plots in the presence of SDS were the High Molecular Weight Standards for SDS-PAGE supplied by Bio-Rad, already described for analytical SDS-PAGE. The calibration proteins used for the construction of Ferguson plots in the absence of SDS were as follows (relative molecular masses in parentheses): bovine thyroglobulin (660,000); horse spleen apoferritin (481,000) (17de Haën C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); sweet potato β-amylase (224,000); and alkaline phosphatase (140,000). Two 80 × 60 × 1.5-mm minigels containing 5% T in 0.375 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.6, with or without 0.1% SDS, were prepared without plastic backing, using the mini-Protean apparatus (Bio-Rad). The electrode and sample buffers used for electrophoresis in SDS were the same described for SDS-PAGE in linear transverse-gradient polyacrylamide gels. As for native PAGE, the electrode buffer containing 0.005 m Tris base, 0.038 m glycine, pH 8.2, and Sβgly was dissolved in electrode buffer with 10% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue. At the end of electrophoresis, the gels were equilibrated in two changes of 0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, with or without 0.1% SDS, for 15 min each, and then incubated in 10% X-gal in 0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 10% (v/v) methanol, with or without 0.1% SDS, at 37 °C for 16 h. Structures were refined by MD and EM calculations using the AMBER 4.1 package (18Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1981; 2: 287-303Crossref Scopus (1112) Google Scholar, 19Weiner S.J.

Case D.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1986; 7: 230-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3604) Google Scholar), with the AMBER94 All-Atom parametrization (21Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz Jr., K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11640) Google Scholar). Preliminary MD and EM calculations were performed in vacuo, with a distance-dependent dielectric constant ε = r, to roughly reproduce solvation effects. In addition, a reduction from 1 to 0.2 of the absolute value of the total charge was used for acid and basic residues and for terminal NH3+ and COO− groups, to avoid overstabilization of H-bonds and salt bridges. For the same reason, very short preliminary EM (less than 1000 steps) and MD calculations (less than 50 ps) were performed to remove sterical strain only, switching to MD runs with explicit solvation as soon as stable structures were obtained. This whole procedure should prevent from obtaining artificially compact structures, with overwhelming patterns of polar interactions acting as driving forces for both intra- and intermolecular interactions. Final refinement steps were run in a periodic water box. An 8-Å cut-off for non-bonded interactions was used in all the calculations. MD runs were performed with a time step of 2 fs (1.5 fs for MD at 368 K), using the SHAKE procedure (22Ryckaert J.P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Comp. Phys. 1977; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (17193) Google Scholar) to constrain bond lengths, at temperatures of 300, 310, and 368 K and, in the case of simulations in water, a pressure of 1 atm. A coupling with an external bath of both heat and pressure (23Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F., Di Nola A. Haak J.M. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23947) Google Scholar) was applied, with time constants of 0.2 and 0.5 ps, respectively. The protocol used for starting model refinement included a preliminary EM in vacuo, followed by a 50-ps MD and a final EM to remove initial sterical strain. A 400-ps MD in a water box was then performed, and the structures corresponding to the last 200 ps of each trajectory were averaged for further analysis. The MD trajectories in water were sampled every 5 ps. The average and the final structure of the refinement procedure for each model were energy-minimized to obtain meaningful geometrical parameters in the structural validation and to perform those analyses for which either an average structure or a bundle of MD frames did not give a suitable representation of the system. The resulting structures were analyzed with the MOLMOL program (24Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar), which was also used to produce all the molecular plots. The NACCESS program was used for the calculation of solvent accessibilities and buried areas; in this analysis, the standard values of the atomic van der Waals radii included in the program were used, with a spherical probe radius of 1.4 Å. The Cartesian coordinates of the hydrogen atoms, missing in the reference crystallographic structure, were calculated with the HBPLUS program (25McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1885) Google Scholar), also used to perform further H-bond analysis. The migration of Sβgly in a 4–10% total acrylamide (T) linear vertical gradient polyacrylamide gel is shown in Fig.1. Sβgly migrated with an apparent relative molecular mass of about 160,000. On the other hand, Sβgly subjected to precipitation by the use of a 4:1:4 mixture of methanol/chloroform/water (26Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar) migrated with an apparent relative molecular mass of 57,000, in agreement with the mass spectrometric measurement of 56,690 of the Sβgly monomer. Thus, it appears that the species with the apparent relative molecular mass of 160,000 represented an oligomeric form of Sβgly, with persisting quaternary structure under the conditions used for SDS-PAGE (exposure to 1% SDS in the sample buffer and 0.1% SDS in the gel and electrode buffers), whereas exposure to a mixture of organic solvents resulted in the complete dissociation of Sβgly into monomers. Because a trimer, with a calculated M r of 170,070, was not predictable on the basis of the crystallographic symmetry (10Aguilar C.F. Sanderson I. Moracci M. Ciaramella M. Nucci R. Rossi M. Pearl L.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), such an oligomeric form may either be an anomalously fast migrating tetramer or an anomalously slow migrating dimer. Ferguson plots of the logarithm of the relative mobility (R m) of a protein at several different acrylamide concentrations against the gel concentration (T) provide an optimal means of determining the relative molecular mass of proteins exhibiting anomalous free mobility andR m. If the concentration of the cross-linker,i.e. N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, expressed as percentage of total acrylamide (C), is held constant, the values of the retardation coefficients (K r), calculated from the linear relationship between log R m and T for different proteins, are linearly related to their relative molecular masses (16Neville D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6328-6334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). For the determination of the relative molecular mass of Sβgly during electrophoresis in the presence of SDS, a Ferguson plot was constructed, using 100 log 100 R m versuslog M, for a set of reference proteins, ranging in relative molecular mass from 45,000 to 205,000, and for Sβgly itself, after electrophoresis in Tris/glycine according to Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), in the presence of 0.1% SDS, on two 4–9% T, 2.7% C transverse-gradient gels (4–10 points per gel, 8–20 points per plot). One such gel, in which the reference proteins and Sβgly occupy alternating lanes, is shown in Fig. 2, panel A, whereas the Ferguson plot is shown in Fig. 2, panel B. The values of K r found are reported in TableI. The K r values of the reference proteins were plotted against their respective values of M (Fig. 2, panel C), and the M of Sβgly was then interpolated from the mean square regression linking them. The Ferguson analysis indicated a relative molecular mass of 109,400 for Sβgly in the presence of 0.1% SDS, a value compatible with incomplete dissociation of Sβgly into dimers. All reference proteins, except the myosin heavy chain, had coinciding values of the apparent relative free mobility (Y 0) (i.e. the apparent relative mobility extrapolated to 0 acrylamide concentration), as it was expected on the base of previous descriptions of the behavior of a number of protein-SDS complexes (16Neville D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6328-6334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, Sβgly and the myosin heavy chain exhibited a lower value of Y 0, a circumstance also suggesting anomalous electrophoretic migration (16Neville D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6328-6334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IRetardation coefficients (Kr) of molecular mass marker proteins and S. solfataricus β-glycosidase in SDS-PAGE and native PAGEProteinMK rr aCorrelation coefficientsr for the least square regression analysis used to calculateK r values.SDS-PAGESkeletal myosin heavy chain205,000−10.810.984E. coli β-galactosidase116,000−9.550.988Phosphorylase b94,000−8.660.989Bovine serum albumin67,000−7.010.988Hen egg ovalbumin45,000−5.290.978S. solfataricusβ-glycosidase109,400bValues calculated on the basis of the measured K r of Sβgly, by least square regression analysis of the relationship between log M and logK r of the marker proteins.−8.740.991Native PAGEBovine thyroglobulin660,000−18.320.998Horse spleen apoferritin481,000−12.140.998Sweet potato β-amylase224,000−6.840.999Alkaline phosphatase140,000−5.840.976S. solfataricusβ-glycosidase233,800bValues calculated on the basis of the measured K r of Sβgly, by least square regression analysis of the relationship between log M and logK r of the marker proteins.−7.730.998a Correlation coefficientsr for the least square regression analysis used to calculateK r values.b Values calculated on the basis of the measured K r of Sβgly, by least square regression analysis of the relationship between log M and logK r of the marker proteins. Open table in a new tab For the determination of the relative molecular mass of Sβgly during electrophoresis under native conditions, i.e. in the absence of SDS, a Ferguson plot was constructed, using 100 log 100R m versus log M, for a set of reference proteins, ranging in relative molecular mass from 140,000 to 660,000, and for Sβgly itself, after electrophoresis in Tris/boric acid, in the absence of SDS, according to Neville (16Neville D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6328-6334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), on two 4–7% T, 2.7% C transverse-gradient gels per each standard and Sβgly (15 points per gel, 30 points per plot). The Ferguson plot is shown in Fig.3, panel A. The values ofK r found are reported in Table I. TheK r values of the reference proteins were plotted against their respective values of M (Fig. 3, panel B), and the M of Sβgly was then interpolated from the mean square regression linking them. The Ferguson analysis indicated a relative molecular mass of 233,800 for Sβgly in the absence of SDS, a value in good agreement with the calculated M r (226,760) of the Sβgly tetramer. The values of the apparent relative free mobilities (Y 0) of the reference proteins and Sβgly were ordered in parallel with their relative molecular masses, a circumstance often occurring in practice, because, if the surface charge density remains relatively constant, the larger molecules usually have a higher net charge and free mobility. Fig. 4 shows the results of the in-gel chromogenic reaction for 16 h of increasing amounts of Sβgly with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, after electrophoresis in 5% T polyacrylamide gels in 0.05 msodium phosphate, pH 6.5, both in the presence of 0.1% SDS and in its absence, under which conditions we have documented that the enzyme is in dimeric and tetrameric form, respectively. It appears that the enzymatic activity of Sβgly, as judged from the minimal amount of enzyme giving rise to an appreciable chromogenic reaction, was slightly higher in the presence of SDS (compare the lanes containing 0.10 μg of Sβgly). The lower intensity of the activity staining at the highest doses of Sβgly in the SDS-containing gel was possibly due to an effect of the detergent on the spectral properties of the chromogenic substrate. These results unequivocally proved that the dimeric form of Sβgly was f"

It is composed of two actin-depolymerization factor homology (ADF-H) domains that show ∼20% sequence identity to ADF/cofilin proteins. In contrast to ADF/cofilins, which bind both G-actin and F-actin and promote filament depolymerization, twinfilin interacts only with G-actin. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of twinfilin-actin monomer interaction, we determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal ADF-H domain of twinfilin and mapped its actin-binding site by site-directed mutagenesis. This domain has similar overall structure to ADF/cofilins, and the regions important for actin monomer binding in ADF/cofilins are especially well conserved in twinfilin. Mutagenesis studies show that the N-terminal ADF-H domain of twinfilin and ADF/cofilins also interact with actin monomers through similar interfaces, although the binding surface is slightly extended in twinfilin. In contrast, the regions important for actin-filament interactions in ADF/cofilins are structurally different in twinfilin. This explains the differences in actin-interactions (monomer versus filament binding) between twinfilin and ADF/cofilins. Taken together, our data show that the ADF-H domain is a structurally conserved actin-binding motif and that relatively small structural differences at the actin interfaces of this domain are responsible for the functional variation between the different classes of ADF-H domain proteins.

The structure and dynamics of actin filaments are regulated by a large number of actin-binding proteins (1Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Despite the large variation in the biochemical activities of these proteins, many of them interact with actin through a relatively small number of actin-binding motifs. The actin-depolymerization factor homology (ADF-H)1 domain is an ∼150-amino acid motif that is present in three phylogenetically distinct classes of actin-binding proteins: ADF/cofilins, Abp1/drebrins, and twinfilins. Although all these proteins appear to use the ADF-H domain for their interactions with actin, they are biochemically distinct and play different roles in actin dynamics (2Lappalainen P. Kessels M.M. Cope M.J. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1951-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). ADF/cofilins are small actin-binding proteins composed of a single ADF-H domain. They bind both actin monomers and filaments and promote rapid filament turnover in cells by depolymerizing/fragmenting actin filaments. ADF/cofilins bind ADP-actin with higher affinity than ATP-actin and inhibit the spontaneous nucleotide exchange on actin monomers (3Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 4Carlier M.F. Ressad F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33827-33830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Abp1/drebrins are relatively large proteins composed of an N-terminal ADF-H domain followed by a variable region and a C-terminal SH3 domain. Unlike ADF/cofilins, Abp1/drebrins interact only with actin filaments and do not promote filament depolymerization or fragmentation. Abp1/drebrins appear to be involved in endocytosis as well as in promoting neuronal plasticity in animals (5Kessels M.M. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Qualmann B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 6Hayashi K. Shirao T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3918-3925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, at least yeast Abp1 also activates the Arp2/3 complex and may therefore function as a link between endocytosis and actin polymerization (47Goode B.L. Rodal A.A. Barnes G. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Twinfilins are actin-binding proteins that are composed of two ADF-H domains. Mutations in budding yeast and Drosophila twinfilin genes result in defects in actin-dependent cell biological and developmental processes, indicating that twinfilin is intimately involved in the regulation of actin dynamics in these organisms (7Goode B.L. Drubin D.G. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Wahlstrom G. Vartiainen M. Yamamoto L. Mattila P.K. Lappalainen P. Heino T.I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 787-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Unlike ADF/cofilins and Abp1/drebrins, which interact with actin filaments, twinfilins bind only actin monomers (9Palmgren S. Vartiainen M. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 881-886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Twinfilins bind ADP-G-actin with ∼10-fold higher affinity than ATP-G-actin and prevent the nucleotide exchange on actin monomers (10Ojala P.J. Paavilainen V.O. Vartiainen M.K. Tuma R. Weeds A.G. Lappalainen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Analysis of yeast twinfilin suggested that this protein contributes to actin dynamics by localizing actin monomers, in their “inactive” ADP-form, to the sites of rapid actin assembly in cells. The localization of twinfilin at these regions is regulated by direct interactions between twinfilin and capping protein (11Palmgren S. Ojala P.J. Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although twinfilin is composed of two ADF-H domains, it appears to form a 1:1 complex with actin monomers (7Goode B.L. Drubin D.G. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Vartiainen M. Ojala P.J. Auvinen P. Peränen J. Lappalainen P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1772-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Analysis of mouse twinfilin demonstrated that the two ADF-H domains are biochemically different from each other. The C-terminal domain forms a stable (k off = 1.8 s−1), high affinity (K d = 0.05 μm) complex with ADP-actin, whereas the N-terminal domain forms a more transient (k off = 20 s−1), lower affinity (K d = 0.7 μm) complex with ADP-G-actin. Kinetic analysis further suggests that the actin monomer first associates with the N-terminal ADF-H domain and is then delivered to the C-terminal domain through a conformational change within the twinfilin molecule (10Ojala P.J. Paavilainen V.O. Vartiainen M.K. Tuma R. Weeds A.G. Lappalainen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). The atomic structures of four ADF/cofilin proteins have been determined by x-ray crystallography and NMR (13Hatanaka H. Ogura K. Moriyama K. Ichikawa S. Yahara I. Inagaki F.

To elucidate structural differences underlying the biochemical differences between the three ADF-H domain protein families, it will be essential to gain structural information also from the two other members of this family: Abp1/drebrin and twinfilin. Here, we present the crystal structure of the N-terminal ADF-H domain of mouse twinfilin. Furthermore, we mapped the actin monomer-binding site of this domain by site-directed mutagenesis. These data show that ADF/cofilins and twinfilin interact with G-actin through structurally similar interfaces but that the regions involved in F-actin binding in ADF/cofilin are not structurally conserved in twinfilin. The recombinant proteins containing the N-terminal ADF-H domain of mouse twinfilin (residues 1–142 and 1–174) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusions from the vector pGAT2 (17Peränen J. Rikkonen M. Hyvönen M. Kääriäinen L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The proteins were cleaved from GST by thrombin digestion and purified by gel filtration chromatography as described previously (10Ojala P.J. Paavilainen V.O. Vartiainen M.K. Tuma R. Weeds A.G. Lappalainen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). The site-directed mutations were introduced to the Twf1–174 construct using the PCR-based overlap extension method described by Higuchi et al. (18Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7368Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). To express an M1-T5 deletion of the domain, a fragment lacking the codons for the 5 N-terminal amino acids was amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides that create NcoI and HindIII sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the product, respectively. The fragment was digested withNcoI and HindIII and ligated into the pGAT2 vector, and the protein was expressed and purified as described above. All DNA constructs were sequenced to verify the correct sequence. Rabbit muscle actin was purified from acetone powder (19Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and labeled with 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl) as described in Detmers et al. (20Detmers P. Weber A. Elzinga M. Stephens R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 99-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications by Weeds et al. (21Weeds A.G. Harris H. Gratzer W. Gooch J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer by using calculated extinction co-efficients: ε280 = 26,1 mm−1 cm−1 (for the N-terminal ADF-H domain of twinfilin) and ε290–400 = 26,6 mm−1 cm−1 (for actin). The twinfilin1–142 construct was crystallized by mixing the protein solution (1 μl of 10 mg/ml in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5) with the reservoir solution (1.6m sodium citrate, 3% polyethylene glycol 400, 0.1m Na-Hepes, pH 7.5) and equilibrating against the reservoir buffer by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at +4 °C. Regular crystals of up to 0.3 mm appeared after 3–5 days, belonged to the space group P212121, and had cell constants a = 47.54 Å, b = 74.49Å, c = 76.95 Å, α = β = γ = 90o. V mcalculations indicated that there were most likely two monomers in the asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 44%. The gold-derivative crystals were prepared by soaking native crystals in well buffer supplemented with 0.1 m cyano-aurate for 24–48 h at +4 °C. The crystals were mounted in cryoloops directly from mother liquor and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. All data were collected at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Hamburg outstation on the wiggler beamline BW7B equipped with a Mar345 imaging plate scanner (22Silfhout R.G. Hermes C. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1995; 66: 1818-1820Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Images were processed with programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by single anomalous dispersion phasing. The gold positions were identified using the program SHELXS (24Sheldrick G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 628-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and refined with SOLVE (25Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 498-861Google Scholar). The program SHARP (26de la Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 472-494Crossref Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) was used to extend the phases and calculate the initial experimental map at a resolution of 2.5 Å. These maps were further enhanced by density modification. An initial model was carefully built into the experimental map using the program O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The model was then refined using the maximum likelihood target function with the phase probability distribution in CNS 1.1 (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.M. Gros P. Grossekunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). These coordinates were subsequently used as a molecular replacement search model for the 1.6-Å native data set. The refinement using data from 20 to 1.6 Å was completed by iterative cycles of model building and simulated annealing and conjugate gradient least squares coordinate and restrained B-factor refinement in CNS. During all steps, 9% of the data was used to calculate the free R-factor. The final model was analyzed with Procheck (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and CNS. The coordinates of the model were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB code 1M4J). The change in the fluorescence of NBD-labeled ADP-G-actin was used to monitor the binding of wild-type and mutant twinfilin domains to actin monomers as described (10Ojala P.J. Paavilainen V.O. Vartiainen M.K. Tuma R. Weeds A.G. Lappalainen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). ADP-actin was prepared by incubating NBD-actin with hexokinase-agarose beads (Sigma) and 1 mm glucose overnight as described (30Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Different concentrations (0–150 μm) of wild-type and mutant twinfilin domains were mixed with 0.2 μm ADP-G-actin (in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.08 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ADP, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm MgCl2). The normalized decrease of fluorescence, shown in Equation 1, E=(F−F0)(Fmax−F0)Equation 1 was measured with a BioLogic MOS250 fluorometer at each concentration of wild-type and mutant twinfilin ADF-H domains with an excitation at 482 nm and emission at 535 nm. The data were analyzed and fitted using Equation 2 E=12c+12z−12(c+z)∧2−4zEquation 2 where Equation 3 provides z=[Twf]tot[Act]totEquation 3 and Equation 4 provides c=1+Kd[Act]totEquation 4 Wild-type and mutant Twf1–174 proteins were used at a final concentration of 2 μm in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mmNaCl. The proteins were diluted into 0–7 m buffered urea and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. Fluorescence measurements were carried out at an excitation of 280 nm, and emission was monitored at 355 nm. The fluorescence change versus urea concentration was then plotted, and the midpoint of unfolding was determined. The structure of the N-terminal ADF-H domain of mouse twinfilin (Twf1–142) was determined at 1.6-Å resolution (Table I). The experimental single anomalous dispersion map showed two molecules in the asymmetric unit and allowed for a continuous chain trace, excluding the six N-terminal and three C-terminal residues, which were disordered. The N-terminal ADF-H domain of twinfilin consists of a five-stranded mixed β-sheet in which the four N-terminal strands are antiparallel and the two C-terminal strands run parallel to each other. These strands are surrounded by a pair of α-helices on both sides of the sheet (Fig. 1 A).Table ICrystallographic dataData CollectionResolution range (Å)20–1.6λ used for data collection (Å)0.8459Number of images used for integration210Oscillation range (o)0.5Number of reflections (measurements/unique)457961/34257Coverage [completeness] (last bin, 1.66–1.60 Å)93.0 (92.2)Overall 〈I〉/〈ς(I)〉 (last bin, 1.66–1.60 Å)13.0 (4.0)Multiplicity3.8Rsym (last bin, 1.66–1.60 Å)0.044 (0.255)Space groupP212121Unit cella = 47.5 Å, b = 74.5 Å, c = 77.0 Å, α = β = γ = 90.0°RefinementResolution range (Å)20.0–1.60Sigma cutoff (F)noneNumber of working set reflections29973Number of Rfree set reflections3313 (9%)Rcryst (%)23.2Rfree (%)25.1Number of atoms (p/w)2168/110R.m.s.d.aRoot mean square deviation.from ideal geometryBonds (Å)0.005Angles (o)1.2Dihedral angles (o)22.5Improper angles (o)0.8Ramachandran plotMost favorable (%)90.7Additionally allowed (%)9.3Generously allowed (%)0.0Disallowed (%)0.0a Root mean square deviation. Open table in a new tab Although twinfilin and ADF/cofilin display different biochemical activities and the ADF-H domains of twinfilin are only ∼20% identical to ADF/cofilins at the amino acid level, Twf1–142 superimposes well with the ADF/cofilin structures. An average root mean square deviation for all Cα atoms between Twf1–142 and yeast cofilin is 1.9 Å (Fig. 1 C). The orientation of helices α1, α2, and α3 as well as strands β1, β2, and β5 are especially well conserved between twinfilin and ADF/cofilin, whereas the orientations of helix α4 and strands β3 and β4 deviate between ADF/cofilin and Twf1–142. The long β-sheet composed of strands β3 and β4 protrudes away from the main protein body in all ADF/cofilin structures determined so far (13Hatanaka H. Ogura K. Moriyama K. Ichikawa S. Yahara I.

Genet. 2000; 41: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), whereas in Twf1–142, these strands and the loop connecting them are tilted toward the C-terminal end of helix α3 (Fig. 1 C,red arrow). Furthermore, the C-terminal helix, which is oriented roughly parallel to the strand β5 in ADF/cofilins, is tilted ∼25o in the N-terminal ADF-H domain of twinfilin (Fig.1 C, blue arrow). These structural variations are well defined in the electron density maps, are accompanied by several contacts to the main protein body, and are important for the integrity and activity of twinfilin as discussed below. A structure-based sequence alignment between Twf1–142 and yeast cofilin shows that the structurally most highly conserved regions between these molecules (α1, α2, α3, β1, β2, β4, β5) also display the most obvious sequence homology to each other (Fig.2). The hydrophobic core, including twinfilin residues Ala-9, Phe-17, Ala-20, Leu-28, Ile-30, Ile-32, Leu-37, Phe-56, Leu-60, Trp-83, Ile-86, Leu-108, Val-121, Val-129, Tyr-134, is well conserved between ADF/cofilins and Twf1–142. Furthermore, Trp-88 makes similar hydrogen bonding to Leu-58, Pro-59, and Pro-92 as the corresponding residues in ADF/cofilin molecules. It is also important to note that the regions important for actin monomer binding in ADF/cofilins, especially the long helix α3, are well conserved in the N-terminal ADF-H domain of twinfilin. Also, the Tyr-68 and Tyr-101 residues, which have been suggested to stabilize and orient this long actin-binding helix in ADF/cofilins (31Jiang C.J. Weeds A.G. Khan S. Hussey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9973-9978Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), are stacked against each other in a similar orientation to the corresponding invariable tyrosines in ADF/cofilins. In contrast, the C-terminal helix and the region surrounding the loop between strands β3 and β4 show a lower degree of sequence and structural conservation between ADF/cofilins and Twf1–142. Interestingly, these structurally less conserved regions have been shown to play an important role in actin filament binding in ADF/cofilin proteins (32Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Drubin D.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 33Ono S. McGough A. Pope B.J. Tolbert V.T. Bui A. Pohl J. Benian G.M. Gernert K.M. Weeds A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5952-5958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The N-terminal ADF-H domain of twinfilin is structurally similar to ADF/cofilins (Fig.1 C), and recent studies showed that these two proteins compete with each other in actin monomer binding (10Ojala P.J. Paavilainen V.O. Vartiainen M.K. Tuma R. Weeds A.G. Lappalainen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). This suggests that they interact with actin through at least partially overlapping interfaces. However, it is important to note that whereas ADF/cofilins bind both F- and G-actin, twinfilin interacts only with G-actin. To map the actin monomer-binding site on the surface of the N-terminal ADF-H domain of twinfilin, we introduced six mutations on the putative actin-binding surface of twinfilin. The mutagenesis was carried out for Twf1–174 construct (containing twinfilin residues 1–174) instead of Twf1–142 because Twf1–174 promotes a stronger change in the fluorescence upon binding to NBD-G-actin than Twf1–142. However, the extra residues in Twf1–174 do not contribute to actin binding because both of these constructs interact with actin monomers with nearly identical affinities (10Ojala P.J. Paavilainen V.O. Vartiainen M.K. Tuma R. Weeds A.G. Lappalainen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Five of the mutations in this study were alanine substitutions of surface residues at corresponding regions that have been shown to be important for actin monomer and/or actin filament binding in ADF/cofilin. The sixth mutation was the deletion of the 5 N-terminal amino acids that were disordered in our crystal structure. The N-terminal region of ADF/cofilins has been shown to play an essential role in interactions with actin (32Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Drubin D.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 34Guan J.Q. Vorobiev S. Almo S.C. Chance M.R.

Biol. 2000; 295: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The residues important for actin binding in ADF/cofilin as well as the twinfilin mutations generated in this study are shown in Fig. 2. The mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli as GST-fusion proteins, enriched with glutathione-agarose beads, separated from GST by thrombin digestion, and purified by gel filtration chromatography. All Twf1–174 mutant proteins were fully soluble and monomeric according to their elution positions and profiles in gel filtration chromatography. To determine the effects of these mutations for the overall stability of the molecule, a fluorescence-monitored urea denaturation assay was carried out for each protein (Fig.3). The behavior of the wild-type ADF-H domain and all mutant proteins is consistent with a simple two-state unfolding transition. The wild-type Twf1–174 and most of the mutants show a midpoint for the transition at ∼4 murea, indicating that these mutations do not significantly affect the stability of the protein. However, the mutant K135A,K136A showed a midpoint for the transition at 3.1 m urea and was therefore significantly less stable than the wild-type protein. However, these mutations do not affect the overall structure of the protein because the K135A,K136A mutant protein still binds to actin monomers with almost identical affinity to the wild-type Twf1–174(Table II).Table IIBiochemical properties of Twf1–174 mutant proteinsMid-point transition [urea]K D for ADP-G-actinmμmWild type4.20.7 (Ref. 10Ojala P.J.

Open table in a new tab The stability of the proteins was determined by fluorescence monitored urea denaturation assay. The K D values for binding to ADP-G-actin under physiological conditions (0.1 mm KCl, pH 7.5) were derived from the change in NBD-actin fluorescence. The fluorescence of NBD-G-actin is modulated upon binding to twinfilin and its individual ADF-H domains, thereby providing a means of determining the affinity of these proteins for actin monomers (10Ojala P.J. Paavilainen V.O. Vartiainen M.K. Tuma R. Weeds A.G. Lappalainen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Here, we determined the affinities of wild-type and mutant Twf1–174 proteins for G-actin under physiological conditions (0.1 m KCl, 1 mm MgCl2). In these assays, we used ADP-actin because twinfilin has been shown to bind ADP-G-actin with ∼10-fold higher affinity than ATP-G-actin (10Ojala P.J. Paavilainen V.O. Vartiainen M.K. Tuma R. Weeds A.G. Lappalainen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). The wild-type Twf1–174 and five of the mutant proteins (ΔM1-T5; Q76A,Q79A; K109A,K110A; E127A,D128A; K135A,K136A) resulted in 10–20% quenching of the NBD-fluorescence upon binding to actin monomers. However, whereas the quenching was almost saturated with 2 μm K135A,K136A mutant protein (Fig.4), much larger concentrations of the other four mutants were required for maximal fluorescence quenching (Fig. 4, insets). The affinity of the K135A,K136A mutant for ADP-G-actin (K D = 0.8 μm) is very similar to the one determined previously for the wild-type Twf1–174 for ADP-G-actin (K D = 0.7 μm, ref. 10Ojala P.J. Paavilainen V.O. Vartiainen M.K. Tuma R. Weeds A.G. Lappalainen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar), suggesting that these mutations do not interfere with the actin monomer binding activity. In contrast, the N-terminal deletion as well as three of the point mutation proteins (Q76A,Q79A; K109A,K110A; E127A,D128A) show over 5-fold decrease (K D = 4.5–7.3 μm) in the affinity for actin monomers. The R96A,K98A mutant does not result in a detectable quenching of NBD-actin fluorescence, suggesting that this mutant protein does not have significant affinity for ADP-G-actin (Fig. 4). It is also formally possible that the R96A,K98A mutant binds to G-actin but would be unable to quench NBD-fluorescence upon binding. However, previous mutagenesis studies demonstrated that corresponding residues in yeast twinfilin play an important role in actin monomer binding/sequestering activity (11Palmgren S. Ojala P.J. Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results suggest that five of the mutations introduced in this study (ΔM1-T5; Q76A,Q79A; R96A,K98A; K109A,K110A; E127A,D128A) disrupt the interaction between twinfilin and actin monomer, and only the mutant K135A,K136A does not interfere with actin binding (Table II). The analysis presented here demonstrates that ADF-H domains form a structurally conserved family of protein domains: the overall fold of the N-terminal ADF-H domain of twinfilin is similar to the known ADF/cofilin structures, and these proteins also show structural similarity to the repeated segments of the gelsolin family of actin filament severing/capping proteins (Fig.5). Although the main part of the Twf1–142 structure is very similar to ADF/cofilins, significant structural differences are seen at certain regions of these two biochemically distinct proteins (Fig. 1 C). Similarly, structural differences have been shown to exist between the repeated segments of gelsolin, each of which display discrete biochemical activities (36Burtnick L.D Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Analysis of the six site-directed Twf1–174 mutants demonstrates that the N-terminal ADF-H domain of twinfilin utilizes a similar interface for interactions with actin monomers as ADF/cofilins (Fig. 5 A). Because the electrostatic surface potentials on the actin monomer-binding surfaces of the N-terminal ADF-H domain of twinfilin and yeast cofilin are very similar to each other (Fig.5 B), we propose that these proteins also bind to the same site on the actin monomer. This is supported by the observation that twinfilin and ADF/cofilins compete with each other in binding to actin monomers (10Ojala P.J. Paavilainen V.O. Vartiainen M.K. Tuma R. Weeds A.G. Lappalainen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). However, it is important to note that the actin monomer-binding site of twinfilin is somewhat extended as compared with the one of ADF/cofilin because additionally, in Twf1–174, the residues Gln-76 and/or Gln-79, located in the loop between strands β3 and β4, are important for G-actin binding. Mutations at the corresponding region of ADF/cofilins do not result in defects in actin monomer binding (32Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Drubin D.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This region also maps outside the actin monomer-binding site of yeast cofilin determined using synchroton x-ray footprinting (34Guan J.Q. Vorobiev S. Almo S.C. Chance M.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5765-5775Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics simulation suggested that in ADF/cofilin-actin monomer complex, this region points away from the binding site on actin monomer toward the next subunit in the actin filament (37Wriggers W. Tang J.X. Azuma T. Marks P.W. Janmey P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 921-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, in Twf1–142, this loop is bent toward the C-terminal end of the helix α3. Assuming that the N-terminal ADF-H domain of twinfilin binds to an actin monomer in a similar orientation as modeled for cofilin by Wriggers et al. (37Wriggers W. Tang J.X. Azuma T. Marks P.W. Janmey P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 921-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the strands β3 and β4 in Twf1–142 are bent to place residues Gln-76 and Gln-79 close to the N and C termini of actin in subdomain 1. Therefore, it is possible that the small differences in the actin monomer interfaces between twinfilin and ADF/cofilins account for differences in the actin monomer interactions between these two proteins. ADF/cofilins interact with both actin monomers and filaments, whereas all twinfilins characterized so far bind only to actin monomers (3Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 9Palmgren S. Vartiainen M. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 881-886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The residues specific for F-actin binding in ADF/cofilins have been mapped to the strand β4 and to the C-terminal helix (32Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Drubin D.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 33Ono S. McGough A. Pope B.J. Tolbert V.T. Bui A. Pohl J. Benian G.M. Gernert K.M. Weeds A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5952-5958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the most pronounced structural differences between ADF/cofilin and Twf1–142 are found in these two regions: the loop connecting the strands β3 and β4 in Twf1–142is bent toward the C-terminal end of helix α3, and the C-terminal helix in Twf1–142 is tilted ∼25o as compared with the one in ADF/cofilins (Fig. 1 C). When ADF/cofilin molecule is replaced by Twf1–142 in the currently available ADF/cofilin-F-actin models (33Ono S. McGough A. Pope B.J. Tolbert V.T. Bui A. Pohl J. Benian G.M. Gernert K.M. Weeds A.G.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), the strands β3 and β4 of Twf1–142 point toward the actin filament, causing a steric hindrance. Thus, our data provide a structural explanation for the lack of actin filament binding activity in twinfilin. Taken together, these data suggest that the ADF-H domains form a structurally conserved actin-binding motif. Because the most ancient member of this family, ADF/cofilin, binds actin filaments, it is possible that during evolution, the actin filament binding activity was lost in twinfilin as a result of structural changes in the actin filament-binding site of this domain. This led to an evolution of a new family of actin monomer-binding proteins, which enabled more efficient and complex regulation of actin dynamics in cells. The ADF-H domain appears to be a specific ADP-actin-binding motif because at least ADF/cofilins and twinfilins bind ADP-actin with a significantly higher affinity than ATP-actin (10Ojala P.J. Paavilainen V.O. Vartiainen M.K. Tuma R. Weeds A.G. Lappalainen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar, 11Palmgren S. Ojala P.J. Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Lappalainen P. J.

Thus, the actin monomer binding properties of twinfilin are different from other actin monomer binding/sequestering proteins such as thymosin-β4 and profilin, which bind ATP-G-actin with higher affinity than ADP-G-actin (1Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ancient duplication of the ADF-H domain and subsequent modifications in the structure and actin binding properties of this domain were critical for the appearance of a specific ADP-actin monomer-binding/sequestering protein, twinfilin."
https://openalex.org/W1980049428,"Cell cycle G1 exit is a critical stage where cells commonly commit to proliferate or to differentiate, but the biochemical events that regulate the proliferation/differentiation (P/D) transition at G1 exit are presently unclear. We previously showed that MAT1 (ménageà trois 1), an assembly factor and targeting subunit of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK), modulates CAK activities to regulate G1 exit. Here we find that the retinoid-induced G1 arrest and differentiation activation of cultured human leukemic cells are associated with a switch to CAK hypophosphorylation of retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) from CAK hyperphosphorylation of RARα. The switch to CAK hypophosphorylation of RARα is accompanied by decreased MAT1 expression and MAT1 fragmentation that occurs in the differentiating cells through the all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-mediated proteasome degradation pathway. Because HL60R cells that harbor a truncated ligand-dependent AF-2 domain of RARα do not demonstrate any changes in MAT1 levels or CAK phosphorylation of RARα following ATRA stimuli, these biochemical changes appear to be mediated directly through RARα. These studies indicate that significant changes in MAT1 levels and CAK activities on RARα phosphorylation accompany the ATRA-induced G1 arrest and differentiation activation, which provide new insights to explore the inversely coordinated P/D transition at G1 exit.

These studies indicate that significant changes in MAT1 levels and CAK activities on RARα phosphorylation accompany the ATRA-induced G1 arrest and differentiation activation, which provide new insights to explore the inversely coordinated P/D transition at G1 exit. cyclin-dependent kinase proliferation/differentiation cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase ménage à trois 1 retinoic acid receptor α all-trans retinoic acid truncated ligand-dependent AF-2 domain of RARα wild type RARα retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein transcription factor IIH The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1-activating kinase (CAK), a trimeric CDK7-cyclin H-MAT1 (ménage à trois 1) complex, was originally implicated in cell cycle control by its ability to phosphorylate and activate CDKs (1Nigg E.A.

Recently, distinct regions of MAT1 have been shown to regulate CAK kinase and TFIIH transcription activities (16Busso D. Keriel A. Sandrock B. Poterszman A. Gileadi O. Egly J.M. J. Biol.

To date, comprehensive studies demonstrate that MAT1 regulates CAK substrate specificity and protein-protein interactions, i.e. MAT1 mediates the association of CAK with core TFIIH and shifts CAK substrate preference from CDK2 to the COOH-terminal domain (12Reardon J.T., Ge, H.

Indeed, a subclone of HL60 (designated HL60R) harbors a truncated AF-2 domain of RARα (RARαΔAF-2) and is resistant to differentiation induction by ATRA. However, introducing a normal RARα cDNA into these cells restores their differentiating response to ATRA (30Collins S.J. Robertson K.A. Mueller L. Mol. Cell.

Both the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation function AF-2 (located in the RARα E region) and the ligand-independent transcriptional activation function AF-1 (located in the RARα A/B region) are involved in cell differentiation (33Damm K.

Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular mechanisms whereby CAK phosphorylates RARα and its functional consequences remain unknown. The decision of cells to differentiate is commonly made in cell cycle G1 phase, and differentiation induction requires cell cycle arrest (35Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4985) Google Scholar, 36Studzinski G.P. Harrison L.E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 189: 1-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Zhu L. Skoultchi A.I.

Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), we investigated whether there was any correlation between CAK-RARα signaling and ATRA-induced differentiation in cultured human leukemic cells. We found that ATRA-induced MAT1 reduction and CAK hypophosphorylation of RARα are RARα-dependent and are associated with G1 arrest and differentiation activation. Human leukemic cells AML1 and Nalm6 (provided by Dr. Kohn), NB4 (provided by Dr. Lanotte), HL60, HL60R, REH, Jurkat, lymphoma U937, and human osteosarcoma U2OS cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Human diploid fibroblast IMR90 and human transformed embryonal kidney 293 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (Eagle) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human Ewing's sarcoma TC71, TC32, human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD), and human Ewing's/pPNET CHP100L cells are USC pathology cell lines and were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell lines were purchased from ATCC unless otherwise specified. ATRA and protease inhibitor MG-132 were from Sigma. Either 1 or 5 μm of ATRA were used to treat the cells, and similar effects were observed between the two concentrations. Immediately before labeling, subconfluent cells (5 × 105/ml) were adjusted to 1 × 106/ml and cultured in phosphate-free complete medium for 1 h. Then, 1 × 106/ml cells were incubated with 125 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (ICN) in the same medium for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed and harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclear protein extraction was performed at 4 °C using a modified high salt extraction buffer (41Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The same amounts of nuclear proteins from each sample were used for immunoprecipitation as described (8Wu L. Chen P. Shum C.H. Chen C. Barsky L.W. Weinberg K.I. Jong A. Triche T.J. Mol. Cell.

The resulting immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and autoradiographed. All anti-human polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies used in immunoprecipitation were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Western blotting was performed as described previously (8Wu L. Chen P. Shum C.H. Chen C. Barsky L.W. Weinberg K.I. Jong A. Triche T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 260-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All anti-human polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The rate of cell duplication determined by cell counting was described before (20Wu L. Chen P.

Cell cycle profile was analyzed as described before (20Wu L. Chen P. Hwang J.J. Barsky L.W. Weinberg K.I. Jong A. Starnes V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5564-5572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A direct immunofluorescence staining technique was applied to analyze myeloid differentiation marker CD11b. Cells were exposed to phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated CD11b antibodies at 4 °C for 30 min and fixed with fresh 1% paraformaldehyde. The antigens were then determined by a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The percentage of positive cells and the mean associated fluorescence were quantitated using a FACScan analyzer (CellQuest software V3.2). Control studies were performed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated and phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated antihuman CD45, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated and phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated non-binding mouse γ1(IgG1). All antibodies and mouse IgG were purchased from BD Biosciences. Subconfluent cells with or without ATRA treatment were fixed by methanol and stained with Wright-Giemsa (Sigma). The mature nuclear segmentation of leukemic cells was evaluated under a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. Images were color balanced in Adobe Photoshop. Since CAK interacts with and phosphorylates RARα in vitro (23Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether the ATRA-induced terminal differentiation of HL60 cells was associated with any changes of CAK-RARα signaling. HL60 cells following different periods of ATRA exposure were in vivo labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. We used CDK7 antibody to immunoprecipitate the CAK-bound RARα from the labeled cells for visualizing CAK-RARα signaling by autoradiography. As we expected, CAK interacted with and phosphorylated RARα in vivo because CDK7 antibody brought down phosphorylated RARα and autophosphorylated CDK7 simultaneously (Fig.1 A). We found that CAK hyperphosphorylated RARα in proliferating cells. However, CAK hyperphosphorylation of RARα was inhibited about 40% after 24 h of ATRA stimuli and then diminished to over 90% after 96 h of ATRA stimuli (densitometer results not shown) (Fig. 1 A). CAK activity as represented by CDK7 autophosphorylation also decreased significantly, showing a correspondence to decreased RARα phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A). Western analyses of CAK subunits and their associated RARα were performed by using this same blot. The results showed that RARα and CDK7 antibodies recognized RARα and CDK7, respectively, at the corresponding molecular weight positions of their phosphorylations (Fig.1 A). CDK7 polyclonal antibodies distinguished both forms of the autohyperphosphorylated CDK7 (P-K7) and the autohypophosphorylated CDK7 (K7). Following ATRA stimulation, the P-K7 diminished gradually, whereas the levels of K7 correspondingly increased (Fig.1 A). The dynamic levels of P-K7 and K7 corresponded well with the dynamic status of RARα hyperphosphorylation and RARα hypophosphorylation (Fig. 1 A). Hence, these results show that ATRA induces a switch to CAK hypophosphorylation of RARα in differentiating cells from CAK hyperphosphorylation of RARα in proliferating cells and that this reduced CAK phosphorylation of RARα is associated with a decreased CAK activity. Surprisingly, we observed a 30-kDa MAT1-associated fragment (M30) that was immunoprecipitated by CDK7 antibodies and recognized by MAT1 polyclonal antibodies in Western blotting (Fig. 1 A). This indicated that M30, together with MAT1, was within the CAK complex. We found that gradual diminution of M30 paralleled the developments of both RARα hypophosphorylation and CDK7 hypophosphorylation, whereas the levels of both cyclin H and RARα appear unrelated to this dynamic phosphorylation pattern (Fig. 1 A). The results suggest that ATRA-induced diminution of M30 within the CAK complex might be associated with the dynamic changes of CAK phosphorylation of RARα. We further monitored, in parallel, the relationship between CAK-RARα signaling and P/D transition. We found that the reduction in RARα phosphorylation was associated with the occurrence of pRb hypophosphorylation and G1 arrest after 48 h of ATRA stimuli (Fig. 1, A–C). Proliferation was halted after 72 h of either 1 or 5 μm of ATRA treatment, and then cell numbers remained stable (Fig. 1 D). During this period, differentiation proceeded as shown by CD11b expression and nuclear segmentation (Fig. 1, E and F). Interestingly, although we found pRb hypophosphorylation under ATRA stimuli (Fig.1 B), there was no change in either cyclin D1 expression or CDK4 phosphorylation by Western analyses (data not shown). Hence, these results indicate that ATRA concurrently induces CAK hypophosphorylation of RARα and cyclin D/CDK4-independent pRb hypophosphorylation. The dynamic switch to CAK hypophosphorylation of RARα was associated with the transition from actively proliferating cells to G1arrest that accompanies the terminal myeloid differentiation. The aforementioned results show that MAT1-associated M30 exists within CAK complex and that ATRA-induced diminution of M30 is associated with reduced CAK phosphorylation of RARα. Therefore we explored the following: (a) the relationship between MAT1 and M30; and (b) the origin of M30. By Western analyses of leukemic HL60 and NB4 cells, we found that M30 always was associated with MAT1 in proliferating cells. Total cellular MAT1 expression was inhibited about 50% after 48 h of ATRA stimuli (Fig.2, A and B). M30 was decreased significantly more, approaching 90–100% reduction after 48–72 h of ATRA stimuli (Fig. 2, A and B), which corresponded to the reduced levels of M30 within the CAK complex (Fig.1 A). In contrast to the reduction of MAT1/M30 by ATRA, the total CDK7 protein level remained unchanged (Fig. 2, A andB, densitometer results not shown). To investigate whether M30 is associated with MAT1 in other tumor cells, we analyzed several solid tumor and leukemic cell lines using Western blotting. We found that MAT1 antibodies recognized several fragments ranging from about 20 to 30 kDa in certain tumor cell lines. Further, not only was M30 consistently present but also MAT1 expression was enhanced in these tumor cells compared with normal IMR90 cells (Fig. 2, C andD). Because ATRA-induced diminution of MAT1/M30 is associated with G1 arrest and differentiation activation in differentiating cells (Figs. 1 and 2, A and B), these results suggest that the overexpressed MAT1 and the high levels of M30 in these tumor cells may be related to uncontrolled cell proliferation. We anticipated that M30 could be one of the following: (a) a degraded MAT1 fragment; (b) a splicing variant of theMAT1 gene; or (c) a new gene of sequence homology with MAT1. To address these issues we used multiple pairs of specific and degenerate MAT1 primers for reverse transcription-PCR detection of possible M30 mRNA. A splice variant appeared unlikely because we could not detect any fragments of different sizes that might correspond to this possibleMAT1 splice product (data not shown). We also used severalMAT1 fragments encompassing the MAT1 coding region to screen a cDNA library with low stringency hybridization. All positive clones retrieved from the screening were MAT1(data not shown). We performed Western analysis using three different MAT1 antibodies, recognizing full-length MAT1, NH2-terminal MAT1, and COOH-terminal MAT1. We found that whereas the full-length and NH2-terminal antibodies recognized M30, the COOH terminus antibody did not (Fig. 2 E, lanes 3), indicating that M30 is likely a COOH-terminal truncated MAT1. Recently, Egly's group identified a “minimal” MAT1 fragment that remains within the CAK complex after its spontaneous degradation (16Busso D. Keriel A. Sandrock B. Poterszman A. Gileadi O. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22815-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that the degraded MAT1 fragment may form ΔCAK in cells along with the wild type CAK complex in these leukemic cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that ATRA induces a proteasome-dependent degradation of retinoic acid receptors (42Zhu J. Gianni M. Kopf E. Honore N. Chelbi-Alix M. Koken M. Quignon F. Rochette-Egly C. de The H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14807-14812Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 43Kopf E. Plassat J.L. Vivat V. de The H. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33280-33288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, we wanted to determine whether ATRA-induced reduction of MAT1/M30 was similarly related to enhanced protein degradation. To test this, HL60 cells were incubated with or without ATRA for 48 h, and then cells were exposed either to vehicle or to protease inhibitor MG-132 for an additional 24 h before harvest. Since ATRA stimuli lead to RARα degradation but have no effect on the levels of CDK7 and cyclin H, we used RARα as a positive control, whereas CDK7 and cyclin H were used as negative controls in parallel. We found that the levels of MAT1, M30, and RARα decreased with ATRA stimuli (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2) but then could be overcome by the addition of MG-132 (Fig.3 A, lanes 3). In contrast, neither CDK7 nor cyclin H was affected by ATRA stimuli or MG-132 treatment (Fig.3 B, lanes 2 and 3). In an extension of this approach, we blocked the proteasome pathway first by treating HL60 cells with MG-132 for 8 h. We then added ATRA for an additional incubation of 60 h. Compared with the cells with ATRA stimuli alone (Fig. 3 C, lane 2), the cells with pretreatment of proteasome inhibitor blocked ATRA-induced MAT1/M30 degradation (Fig. 3 C, lane 3). These results demonstrate that ATRA inhibits MAT1 expression and M30 formation via an ATRA-induced proteasome pathway. Since CAK activity is MAT1 dose-dependent (8Wu L. Chen P. Shum C.H. Chen C.

Thus, we utilized HL60R cells, which harbor RARαΔAF-2 and are resistant to differentiation by ATRA (30Collins S.J. Robertson K.A. Mueller L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2154-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 31Robertson K.A. Emami B. Collins S.J. Blood. 1992; 80: 1885-1889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Robertson K.A. Emami B.

We first tested whether MAT1 expression and M30 formation would be inhibited by ATRA-activated proteasome pathway in HL60R cells. We treated HL60 and HL60R cells with ATRA for 48 h and then added MG-132 for an additional incubation of 24 h before harvest. Western analyses showed that in contrast to HL60 cells showing a reduction of MAT1/M30 by ATRA (Fig.4 A, lane 2) but an overcoming by MG-132 (Fig. 4 A, lane 3), there was virtually no change of MAT1/M30 in HL60R cells (Fig.4 A, lanes 5 and 6). Second, we compared MAT1 expression and M30 formation in HL60 and HL60R cells by Western analyses. In contrast to HL60 cells, HL60R cells retained high levels of MAT1/M30 under ATRA stimuli (Fig. 4 B). These results show that RARα activation by ATRA is required for inhibition of MAT1 expression and M30 formation. Next, we examined the relationship between the levels of MAT1/M30, CAK phosphorylation of RARα, and G1 arrest/differentiation activation in HL60R cells. Similarly in studies of CAK-RARα signaling as performed in HL60 cells (Fig. 1), we labeled HL60R cells in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate and immunoprecipitated CAK-bound RARα using CDK7 antibodies. We found no change in either CDK7 autophosphorylation or CAK phosphorylation of RARα following ATRA stimuli of the HL60R cells (Fig. 4 C). Further, Western analyses of this same blot showed that high levels of MAT1/M30 were retained in the CAK complexes and corresponded well to both CDK7 auto-hyperphosphorylation and RARα hyperphosphorylation (Fig.4 C). Also, as we expected that whereas CAK hyperphosphorylation of RARα was retained in HL60R cells, the cells remained virtually continuous cycling (Fig. 4 D) and proliferating (Fig. 4 E) without detectable CD11b expression (Fig. 4 F) or morphology change (Fig. 4 G) following ATRA stimuli. Thus, these results indicate that ATRA-induced RARα activation via the AF-2 domain of RARα is critical to the changes in MAT1/M30 levels and CAK activities on RARα phosphorylation that occur in the differentiating HL60 cells (Fig. 1). Moreover, in the ATRA-treated HL60R cells the lack of changes in MAT1/M30 levels or CAK activities on RARα phosphorylation is correlated with the absence of both G1 arrest and differentiation activation (Fig. 4). Hence, these results strengthen the observed associations between MAT1/M30 levels, CAK phosphorylation of RARα, and terminal myeloid differentiation. Because ATRA induces RARα degradation (42Zhu J. Gianni M. Kopf E. Honore N. Chelbi-Alix M. Koken M. Quignon F. Rochette-Egly C. de The H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14807-14812Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 43Kopf E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33280-33288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A), we investigated whether the reduction in CAK phosphorylation of RARα was related to the diminished levels of RARα substrate resulting from RARα degradation. Using Western analyses, we first monitored ATRA-induced RARα degradation in HL60 cells from 1 h to 8 days. We found that the onset of RARα degradation was evident after 7 h of ATRA stimuli, but afterward the RARα levels remained relatively stable for up to 8 days (Fig.5 A). RARα also maintained a relatively steady level within the CAK complex after its onset of degradation (Fig. 1 A). In contrast to this pattern of RARα degradation, the reduction in CAK phosphorylation of RARα was not observed until 24 h after ATRA stimuli; it then diminished about 70% to more than 90% after 48–96 h of ATRA stimuli (Figs.5 B and 1 A). These marked differences in the kinetics of degradation versus the pattern of CAK phosphorylation of RARα suggest that CAK phosphorylation regulation of RARα under ATRA stimuli is independent of RARα degradation. In a variety of different tissues P/D transition is a process of coordinating cell cycle arrest with differentiation activation. However, the physiological phenomena and the regulatory mechanisms that are involved in coordinating these inverse molecular events remain unclear. We present evidence to show an ATRA-induced transition from proliferating to differentiating cells, where the ATRA-mediated MAT1 reduction and CAK hypophosphorylation of RARα may be involved in coordination of G1 arrest and differentiation activation of these cultured leukemic cells.

Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) led us to determine whether there was any in vivo association between CAK phosphorylation of RARα and ATRA-induced differentiation of HL60 cells. Since RARα is also phosphorylated by protein kinase A and a variety of proline-directed protein kinases (23Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6452-6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), immunoprecipitation of in vivo phosphorylated RARα by RARα antibodies cannot distinguish the signaling specificity of RARα by CAK. Thus, our experimental strategy was to immunoprecipitatein vivo CAK-bound RARα using CDK7 antibodies, which not only ensures the specificity of RARα phosphorylation by CAK but also allows us to visualize RARα phosphorylation status and CAK activities simultaneously. By analyzing these immunoprecipitates, we observe that CAK interacts with and phosphorylates RARα in vivo (Figs.1 A, 4 C, and 5 B). ATRA-induced G1 arrest and differentiation activation are associated with markedly decreased CAK activities and CAK phosphorylation of RARα (Fig. 1). Similar events in P/D transition also were observed in ATRA-sensitive NB4 cells (data not shown). In contrast, we did not observe any such reduced CAK phosphorylation of RARα as well as its association with G1 arrest and differentiation activation in ATRA-treated HL60R cells that harbor RARαΔAF-2 (Fig. 4,C–G). Hence, our data indicate that ATRA-induced diminution of CAK activities on RARα phosphorylation is mediated directly via the RARα and suggest that in HL60 cells containing RARαWT, ATRA-induced CAK hypophosphorylation of RARα may coordinate G1 arrest with differentiation activation. What are the factors that mediate the switch to CAK hypophosphorylation of RARα in ATRA-induced differentiation of leukemic cells? Previous studies demonstrate that MAT1 determines CAK substrate specificity and further enhances CAK activities in either a dose-dependent manner or via MAT1-mediated protein-protein interactions (8Wu L.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5608-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). MAT1 mRNA is overexpressed in multiple tumor cell lines (46Yee A. Nichols M.A., Wu, L. Hall F.L. Kobayashi R. Xiong Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6058-6062PubMed Google Scholar), and differentiation induction by ATRA in NB4 cells is associated with reduction of MAT1 mRNA (47Liu T.X. Zhang J.W. Tao J. Zhang R.B. Zhang Q.H. Zhao C.J. Tong J.H. Lanotte M. Waxman S. Chen S.J. Mao M., Hu, G.X. Zhu L. Chen Z. Blood. 2000; 96: 1496-1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, MAT1 protein is overexpressed in multiple solid tumor cell lines and leukemic cell lines (Fig. 2, C and D). These data therefore indicate that high levels of both MAT1mRNA and MAT1 protein are associated with enhanced cell proliferation. Importantly, we consistently observe that a unique M30, likely derived from cleavage of MAT1, was produced along with MAT1 overexpression in tumor cell lines (Fig. 2, C andD). MAT1/M30 existing in proliferating cells but not in differentiating cells (Figs. 1 and 2, A and B) are immunoprecipitated together by CDK7 antibodies (Figs.1 A, 4 C, and 5 B). Thus, M30 may form a ΔCAK together with the exceeded CAK complexes formed by overexpressed MAT1 to alter CAK substrate specificity on RARα phosphorylation in these leukemic cells. Indeed, these high levels of MAT1/M30 were consistently associated with CAK hyperphosphorylation of RARα in the actively proliferating HL60 cells, but these levels were markedly diminished by ATRA stimuli and thus were associated with the reduced CAK phosphorylation of RARα in the differentiating cells (Figs. 1, and 2, A and B, and Fig. 5 B). In HL60 cells containing RARαWT, MAT1 overexpression and in particular the M30 formation are markedly diminished by ATRA (Figs. 1 A,2 A, 2 B, and 5 B) through a proteasome degradation pathway (Fig. 3). However, in clear contrast, there is no change of MAT1/M30 in the HL60R cells harboring RARαΔAF-2 following exposure to ATRA (Fig. 4, A–C). Thus, ATRA-activated RARα appears to modulate these dynamic changes of MAT1/M30 levels directly. These observations therefore suggest that the RARα-dependent MAT1 levels, and in particular the levels of the M30, might be important in regulation of CAK activities on RARα phosphorylation and that the ATRA-mediated proteasome degradation of MAT1/M30 may be a critical event in down-regulation of CAK-RARα signaling that is associated with G1 arrest and differentiation activation of these leukemic cells. Although ATRA-induced differentiation of leukemic cells is associated with degradation of RARα, we note that the pattern of RARα degradation either within or outside the CAK complex does not match the substrate stoichiometry of the gradually developing CAK hypophosphorylation of RARα (Figs. 1 A and 5). In contrast, gradually inhibited MAT1/M30 by ATRA parallel gradually developed CAK hypophosphorylation of RARα (Figs. 1 A and 5 B). As CAK activities are known to be MAT1 dose-dependent (8Wu L.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5608-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), these results therefore suggest that MAT1 reduction, rather than RARα degradation, may be a main factor to modulate CAK phosphorylation of RARα in ATRA-induced P/D transition. What is the significance of the diminished CAK phosphorylation of RARα that accompanies the ATRA-induced P/D transition in HL60 cells? Such decreased RARα phosphorylation might reflect a generalized decrease in CAK activity because the ATRA-induced cells proceed from actively proliferating to terminally differentiating. Indeed, as discussed above, the markedly decreased MAT1/M30 levels via the ATRA-activated protease pathway may reduce CAK activities on RARα phosphorylation. Alternatively, the decreased RARα phosphorylation might be more directly involved in regulating the molecular events that accompany terminal myeloid differentiation. This latter hypothesis might appear counterintuitive, because a previous study in Cos-1 cells indicated that CDK7 phosphorylation of RARα was associated with enhanced RARα transcriptional activity (23Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and thus reduced phosphorylation of RARα predicts reduced RARα activity. However, such reduced activity might indeed occur as a negative feedback mechanism during terminal myeloid differentiation. Alternatively, the functional significance of RARα phosphorylation might be markedly different in hematopoietic cells versus Cos-1 cells. In summary, we find that ATRA-induced cell cycle G1 arrest and differentiation activation of HL60 cells are associated with a markedly decreased CAK phosphorylation of RARα. An accompanying event is the ATRA-mediated degradation of MAT1/M30 via the proteasome pathway, which might play a critical role in modulating this decreased RARα phosphorylation by CAK. The potential role of MAT1/M30 in regulating CAK activity on RARα phosphorylation as well as the functional significance of the switch to CAK hypophosphorylation of RARα in coordinating G1 arrest and differentiation activation are currently being explored in our laboratory. The detailed molecular and biochemical pathways regarding MAT1-mediated CAK-RARα signaling in control of the transition from actively proliferating to terminally differentiating cells might provide a mechanistic insight into new approaches for leukemia therapy.

Nd1-S has the BTB/POZ domain but lacks the six kelch repeats. <i>Nd1-L</i> but not <i>Nd1-S</i> mRNA is detected ubiquitously in normal mouse tissues. Nd1-L and Nd1-S proteins can form a dimer through the BTB/POZ domain. Nd1-L colocalizes with actin filaments detected using a confocal microscope, and its kelch repeats bind to them <i>in vitro</i>. Overexpression of Nd1-L in NIH3T3 cells delayed cell growth by affecting the transition of cytokinesis. Furthermore, the overexpression prevented NIH3T3 cells from cell death induced by actin destabilization but not by microtubule dysfunction. These data suggest that Nd1-L functions as a stabilizer of actin filaments as an actin-binding protein and may play a role in the dynamic organization of the actin cytoskeleton."

At least four important regions have been identified within the proximal positive element: the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein site (−22 to −11); the E-box-Upstream Stimulatory Factor-binding site (−60 to −54); the G3T-Sp1-binding site (−87 to −78); and the HNF-5 site (−35 to −28) (15Cortese J.F.

The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), the E-box, and the G3T sites are highly conserved among the rat, mouse, and human (13Crabb D.W. Stein P.M. Dipple K.M. Hittle J.B. Sidhu R. Qulali M.

Biophys. 1995; 321: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have been reported to increase ADH enzyme activity, as well as its mRNA. Regulation of ADH gene expression is thought to occur through transcription factors binding to cis-acting elements, and C/EBPs belong to a family of transcription factors implicated in this process (6Potter J.J. Yang V.W. Mezey E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Potter J.J. MacDougald O.A. Mezey E. Arch. Biochem.

The C/EBPs are thought to be critical for cellular differentiation and function in a variety of tissues. So far, more than five members (gene products) of C/EBP family have been described, including C/EBPα, -β, -γ, -δ, and -ε (22Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 23Roesler W.J. Park E.A. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14950-14957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Specificity of gene control by C/EBPs is ensured through their ability to homo- and heterodimerize and to interact with other transcription factors. Two isoforms of C/EBPβ are generated from a single mRNA, the full-length 36-kDa protein termed “liver activating protein” (LAP) and the truncated protein termed “liver inhibitory protein” (LIP). Heterodimerization of LIP with the full-length LAP attenuates transcriptional activity, suggesting that LIP inhibits transcription (24Descombes P. Schebler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). C/EBPγ heterodimerization with C/EBPα and -β also attenuates transcription activation of target genes, suggesting dominant negative regulation of C/EBP transactivation by this factor (25Cooper C. Henderson A. Artandi S. Avitahi N. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4371-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). C/EBPδ can readily form heterodimers with C/EBPα and -β, and the transactivating efficiency is comparable with that of C/EBPα and -β homodimers (26Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKinght S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). Because previous reports using cell cultures suggest that the C/EBP site (6Potter J.J. Yang V.W. Mezey E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Potter J.J. MacDougald O.A. Mezey E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) is important in the hormonal regulation of the Class 1 ADH gene, the C/EBP family of transcription factors could also play a role in the mechanisms of ethanol regulation of ADH. In vivo, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of ADH gene expression by ethanol are still unclear. In the present study, we have investigated the expression of the hepatic Class 1 ADH gene in rats fed an ethanol-containing diet by continuous intragastric infusion and the possible involvement of cis-acting elements in the proximal promoter region of the gene. All chemicals unless otherwise specified were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Radionucleotides were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against C/EBPα, -β, -γ, -δ, -ε, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). All synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Experiments conformed to ethical guidelines for animal research established by our institution and received prior approval by our animal welfare committee. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Harlan Industries (Indianapolis, IN). The rats were surgically cannulated with an intragastric tube, allowed to recover, and infused with an ethanol-containing diet (13g/kg/day) as described previously (27Badger T.M. Crouch J. Irby D. Hakkak R. Shahare M. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1993; 264: 938-943PubMed Google Scholar). The control rats were infused the same diet except that ethanol was isocalorically replaced with carbohydrate. The rats were sacrificed following 38 to 42 days of continuous diet infusion and when their urine ethanol concentrations were high on the descending limb of an ethanol pulse, as previously described (11Badger T.M. Hoog J.O. Svensson S. McGehee R.E. Fang C. Ronis M.J.J. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 684-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Badger T.M. Crouch J.

Badger T.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 264: 944-950PubMed Google Scholar). Liver was collected and stored at −70 °C. Northern blot analysis was conducted as described previously (22Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). A 400-bp rat Class 1 ADH cDNA probe was used for the detection of ADH mRNA (2Estonius M. Danielesso O. Karlsson C. Persson H. Jornavall H. Hoog J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29Crabb D.W. Edenberg H.J. Gene. 1986; 48: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 18 S ribosomal RNA antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized (Bio Synthesis, Inc., Lewisville, TX) using the published sequences (30Buetler T.M. Gallagher E.P. Wang C. Stahl D.L. Hayes J.D. Eaton D.L. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1995; 135: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). All filters were probed with the synthetic 18 S rRNA anti-sense oligonucleotide as an internal control. Bands were quantitated by densitometry of the autoradiograph, and the ratio of ADH message to 18 S rRNA in the same sample was determined and expressed as relative RNA units or as percentage of that for the control. The amino acid sequence of alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) was used for the preparation of anti-peptide antibody targeted against a specific region of rat Class 1 ADH. The amino acid sequence225INKDKFAKAKELG238 is encoded in this gene. This peptide was checked for matching sequences in the Entrez protein sequence data library (NCBI) and found to be unique. An antisera against this sequence was produced in rabbits by Bioworld (Dublin, OH). Liver homogenates were resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to an Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking in TBST (10 mm Tris-buffered saline, 0.13 m NaCl, pH 7.6, 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20) plus 5% (w/v) milk powder. Membranes were incubated with primary antibody diluted to 1:1000 (ADH), 1:2500 (C/EBPs) in TBST plus 5% milk powder for 1.5–3 h (1.5 h for ADH, 3 h for C/EBPs) at room temperature with shaking. After washing three times in TBST, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBST plus 5% milk powder containing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary IgG (1:2500 for ADH, 1:5000 for C/EBPs). Membranes were washed three times in TBST and proteins visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence plus system (ECL Plus;Amersham Biosciences) and detected by autoradiography. Immunoquantitation was obtained by densitometric scanning of the resulting autoradiographs using a Bio-Rad GS525 molecular imager (Richmond, CA). ADH activities were measured in homogenates prepared from liver frozen in liquid nitrogen, essentially as described previously (11Badger T.M. Hoog J.O. Svensson S. McGehee R.E. Fang C. Ronis M.J.J. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 684-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Table I lists the synthetic oligonucleotides used in this study. The ADH-C/EBP probe contains two cis-acting elements (C/EBP-binding site −22 to −11 and EDBP-binding site −10 to −1). ADH-EDBP contains only the EDBP-binding site (−10 to −1); CYP2E1-EBP contains the C/EBP-binding site.Table ISequence of oligonucleotidesOligoSequence (5′ to 3′)Consensus C/EBPTGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCAACGTCTAACGCGTTAGACGT−22 −1ADH-C/EBPTGTGTGCAACTTTGGCCCAGTTACACACGTTGAAACCGGGTCAA−10 −1ADH-EDBPgatc TGGCCCAGTT gACCGGGTCAA cctg−68 −54CYP2E1-EBPTGATTATTGGCTGATACTAATAACCGACTAA−241FctgcAGATGCATAAACAGATTCAATTGGCA−34RCTTCCCTCCTGCAGTGAACTGGGCCAAACTCGAGCACAGATTTTATTTGCaThe mutated C/EBP site is underlined.A−5FCAGTTCACTGCAGGAGGGAAGAAA+450RCTAAATTCCCTGAAGCAAATTCCTCa The mutated C/EBP site is underlined. Open table in a new tab The nuclear extracts were isolated from livers frozen at −70 °C using the nuclear extraction kit from Sigma. Briefly, 100 mg of liver tissue were added into 1 ml of 1× lysis buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgC12, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. The tissue was homogenized for 40 s and centrifuged for 20 min at 11,000 ×g. The pellet was resuspended in 140 μl of extraction buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.42 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor. Incubation occurred while shaking for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min and snap freezing of the supernatant. EMSA were performed as described previously (31Chen B., He, L. Savell V.H. Jenkins J.J. Parham D.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3290-3298PubMed Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared by combining and heating equimolar amounts of complementary single-stranded DNA to 95 °C for 5 min in dH2O and cooling to room temperature overnight. The annealed oligonucleotides were diluted to a concentration of 10 μm and stored at −20 °C. EMSA were carried out in 20 μl containing 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mmdithiothreitol, 0.3 μg of bovine serum albumin, 7% glycerol, and 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The nuclear extracts were blocked with poly(dI-dC) for 15 min on ice. 0.1-μm end-labeled oligonucleotides were then added to the reactions and incubated for another 15 min on ice, after which 3 μl of loading buffer was added. The samples were loaded on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (acrylamid:bisacrylamide = 39:1) in low ionic strength Tris borate EDTA (unless otherwise specified). Serial amounts of nuclear extracts were tested in the experiment; in each reaction 10 μg was the ideal concentration. For the competition experiments, the unlabeled and labeled oligonucleotides were added to the reaction at the same time. For the supershift experiments, antibodies were added to the reaction, incubated 20 min at room temperature, and then the oligo was added to the reaction and incubated on ice for 15 min. The rat genomic DNA was extracted with the Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega). The PCR primers A−241F, A−34R, A−5F, and A+450R were synthesized based on the published rat Class1 ADH 5′-flanking sequence and coding region sequence (GenBankTM accession nos. M29516 and U10900) (Table I). The A−34R primer contains a 4-bp mutation in the C/EBP element. A−241F and A+450R primers were used to amplify the DNA template containing the proximal promoter region and subsequent sequence including the exon 1 region (−241 bp and subsequent 450 bp). A−34R and A−5F were used to construct the same length template containing the mutated C/EBP element. All of the cloned and mutated DNA fragments were sequenced. In vitro transcriptions were carried out in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 mmKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CTP, 0.5 mm GTP, 20 μmunlabeled UTP, 10 μCi of a [32P]UTP. The mixture was made, and the reactions were initiated by adding 90 μg of nuclear extract (with the antibody assay, 2 μl of the serum was added to the reaction at the same time with the nuclear extract). Incubations were carried out for 60 min at 30 °C, and reactions were terminated by adding 100 μl of a stop buffer containing 0.3 m Tris-HCl (pH7.4), 0.3 m sodium acetate, 0.5% SDS, 10 mmEDTA, 10 μg/ml tRNA. The mixture was extracted twice with 0.3m Tris-HCl(pH 7.4)-10 mm EDTA-saturated phenol. The aqueous layers were made to 0.5 mNH4OAc, and 2.5 volumes of ethanol were added to precipitate the transcripts. The pellets were suspended in 95% formamide, 18 mm EDTA, 0.025% SDS. The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and then analyzed in 5% denaturing acrylamide gel. Student's t test was used to determine whether group means differed at p <0.05. Fig. 1 shows the Northern (panel A) and Western (panel B) blots of individual liver samples from rats fed diets with either no ethanol (TEN) or ethanol. Panel C depicts the means ± S.E. for the mRNA, protein, and activities for ADH. As can be seen, feeding an ethanol-containing diet to rats resulted in increased liver ADH mRNA (3.9-fold), protein (3.28-fold), and activity (1.7-fold) levels when compared with rats fed diets with no ethanol. To examine the effects of ethanol on the hepatic expression of C/EBP family members, Western immunoblot analysis was employed by using antisera (described above) against C/EBPα, -β, -γ, -δ, and -ε. As shown in Fig. 2, extracts from control (TEN) and ethanol-treated rats did not differ significantly in immunoreactive C/EBPε. However, immunoblotting with anti-C/EBPβ produced two major bands. The top band migrated with the 36-kDa full-length C/EBPβ LAP, and the bottom band migrated with the 21-kDa truncated isoform LIP. Ethanol increased LAP 3.5-fold (p <0.05) and decreased LIP to non-detectable levels as compared with the control rats. Ethanol treatment also reduced the expression of immunoreactive C/EBPγ to non-detectable levels and increased the immunoreactive C/EBPα and -δ (p<0.05) as compared with controls. EMSA was performed using the end-labeled consensus C/EBP or ADH-specific C/EBP oligonucleotides (Table I) and hepatic nuclear extracts prepared from rats fed ethanol or control diets. The first 22 bp of the proximal promoter of the rat Class 1 ADH contains the C/EBP and EDBP sites (16Potter J.J. Mezey E. Cornelius P. Crabb D.W. Yang V.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The mean increase in nuclear protein binding to the consensus C/EBP site was 2.5-fold (p <0.05) greater in ethanol-fed rats than in rats fed no ethanol (data not shown). In EMSA using an ADH-specific C/EBP oligonucleotide, DNA-protein complexes were also detected as bands with retarded motility (Fig.3 A.) The nuclear protein binding fast migrating complex (LIP binding?) was lowered to be undetected when rats were fed ethanol diets. The mean nuclear protein binding to the C/EBP site (the medium migrating complex) increased 2.4-fold (p <0.05) in rats fed ethanol-containing diets compared with control rats (panel B). Not shown are similar nuclear protein binding experiments using the consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide and upstream stimulatory factor (USF) oligonucleotide where no ethanol effects were observed. The sequence specificity of the DNA-protein complexes formed with nuclear extracts from ethanol-treated rat livers was determined by competition experiments with labeled ADH-C/EBP oligonucleotide and labeled EDBP oligonucleotide in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled oligonucleotides. Fig.4 A shows that labeled C/EBP forms two complexes that could be competed away with the unlabeled ADH-C/EBP oligo (lanes 1–3). Using the EDBP site oligonucleotide as labeled probe in the EMSA, there is only one DNA-protein complex formed at the same position as the slow migrating complex, and this complex could be competed away by increasing amounts of unlabeled EDBP oligonucleotide (lanes 4–6). Together, these data suggest that the slow migrating complex contains EDBP and the medium migrating complex contains the C/EBPs. The difference in the mobility of the complexes formed with the C/EBP and EDBP sites is consistent with the difference in the molecular weight of the proteins binding to these two sites (16Potter J.J. Mezey E. Cornelius P. Crabb D.W. Yang V.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 33William S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 34Davydov I.V. Bohmann D. Krammer P.H. Li-Weber M. Gene. 1995; 161: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the antibody-specific EMSA, the C/EBP binding complex was completely supershifted by C/EBPβ antisera (lane 8), whereas antiserum against C/EBPα had no effect on the nuclear protein binding activity (lane 7). Because ethanol treatment significantly increased the binding of C/EBPs to a consensus C/EBP oligonucleotide, we studied binding to the putative C/EBP site of another gene previously reported to be regulated by ethanol, theCYP2E1 gene (35McGehee Jr., R.E. Ronis M.J.J. Badger T.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The CYP2E1-specific C/EBP oligonucleotide was studied using EMSA, and no differences between the ethanol-treated and control groups were detected (Fig. 4 B). In other experiments, 100-fold excess unlabeled putative CYP2E1 C/EBP was unable to compete for hepatic nuclear proteins binding to ADH-C/EBP oligos (data not shown). To determine the role of the C/EBP element in the transcriptional activity of the ADH proximal promoter, in vitro transcription was conducted using a template containing the −241 bp of the proximal promoter region and the subsequent sequence including exon 1 (450 bp). A second template was mutated only at the C/EBP site, and in vitrotranscription activity was studied in the intact and mutated templates in the presence and absence of hepatic nuclear extracts from control and ethanol-fed rats. The transcripts generated from the in vitro transcription were 450-bp long RNA. Data in Fig. 5 demonstrates that mutation of the C/EBP site blocked the ethanol-induced increase in in vitrotranscription activity when compared with the intact template (p <0.05). Similarly, mutation of the C/EBP site decreased the in vitro transcription activity observed with hepatic nuclear extracts from control rats (p <0.05). To further investigate the effects of LIP and C/EBPγ on transcriptional activity, hepatic nuclear extracts from the control rats were treated with antisera against LIP and C/EBPγ. Extracts from control rats were used because of the greater concentrations of LIP and C/EBPγ compared with ethanol-fed rats (Fig. 2). As can be seen in Fig. 6, the transcription activity was enhanced when the inhibitory influences of LIP and C/EBPγ were removed by β and γ antisera (p <-0.05). Blood and urine ethanol concentrations (UECs) cycle between 0 and 500 mg/dl, and these cycles reoccur about every 6 days in rats infused continuously with ethanol-containing diets (27Badger T.M. Crouch J. Irby D. Hakkak R. Shahare M. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1993; 264: 938-943PubMed Google Scholar, 36Tsukamoto H. French S.W. Reidelberger R.D. Largman C. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1985; 9: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Expression of ADH Class I mRNA and ADH activity are induced when the UECs reach levels greater than 300 mg/dl, and the UECs are abolished in rats treated with the ADH inhibitor, 4-methylpyrazole (11Badger T.M. Hoog J.O. Svensson S. McGehee R.E. Fang C. Ronis M.J.J. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 684-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These results suggest that ethanol cycles were caused by cyclic expression of ADH, which occurs in response to increasing ethanol levels, perhaps an example of time-dependent pharmacokinetics. Two important questions about the existence of ethanol pulses in the rat model concern the central cause of the pulses and the mechanism underlying induction of ADH by ethanol. The rat model of intragastric infusion of ethanol-containing diets offers an excellent opportunity to study the latter question. The genes encoding the Class 1 ADH are mainly expressed in the liver. There is only a single Class 1 ADH gene expressed in the rat liver. In this report, we studied hepatic Class I ADH mRNA, protein, and activity levels from rats fed an ethanol-containing diet by continuous intragastric infusion. Using Northern hybridizations under very stringent experimental conditions, we demonstrated a 4-fold increase in the level of rat Class I ADH mRNA in ethanol-infused rats compared with the control rats. Western immunoblot analysis was performed by using a rabbit antiserum raised against a peptide sequence that is highly specific for rat Class I ADH. Using this probe, there is only a single band on the Western blot, and it migrates at the same molecular weight as calculated for ADH. The mean level of rat Class 1 ADH enzyme increased 3.3-fold in ethanol-infused rats compared with the control rats. The ADH activity levels of ethanol-treated rats were 1.7-fold greater than controls. These results confirm our previous findings on ethanol induction of Class I ADH mRNA and activity and provide essential new data on the ADH protein not available in the original report. These data strengthen the argument that significant induction of ADH occurs at high UECs but beg the question as to the mechanisms underlying these effects. Because nuclear run-on assays suggested that ethanol increased ADH Class I mRNA by elevation of gene transcription (11Badger T.M. Hoog J.O. Svensson S. McGehee R.E. Fang C. Ronis M.J.J. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 684-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we studied possible mechanisms of ethanol-induced transcription of the ADH gene. The first 3 kb of the 5′-flanking region of rat Class I ADH gene has been characterized. Within the 241 bp upstream of the start site of transcription (the proximal positive element), there are several known regulatory sites, including the C/EBP site (−22 to −11) and the EDBP site (−10 to 0) (15Cortese J.F. Majewski J.L. Crabb D.W. Edenberg H.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21898-21906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C/EBP family of transcription factors has been implicated in cell differentiation and energy metabolism (37Landschulz W.H. Hohnson P.F. Adashi E.Y. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 786-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar,38McKnight S.L. Lane M.D. Gluechsohn-Waelsch S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2021-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These factors are expressed predominantly in cells with high gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis, most notably in liver and adipose tissue (38McKnight S.L. Lane M.D. Gluechsohn-Waelsch S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2021-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The C/EBPs are basic/leucine zipper transcription factors that interact with each other and with other protein families to regulate cellular transcription (33William S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 34Davydov I.V. Bohmann D. Krammer P.H. Li-Weber M. Gene. 1995; 161: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). C/EBP dimerization is a prerequisite to DNA binding (40Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 243: 1681-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), and heterodimerization of C/EBPs can either enhance or attenuate transcriptional activity. C/EBPβ and -δ enhance transcriptional activity, but LIP, as well as C/EBPγ, are dominant negative regulations of C/EBP transactivation (22Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 26Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKinght S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). Previous reports using cell cultures suggest that the C/EBP site (6Potter J.J. Yang V.W. Mezey E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Potter J.J. MacDougald O.A. Mezey E. Arch. Biochem.

However, there was no evidence available from in vivo studies to confirm these findings. In the present studies, protein expression levels in liver nuclear extracts from ethanol-fed rats demonstrated significant increases in C/EBPβ and -δ and decreases in LIP and C/EBPγ to undetectable levels as compared with rats not fed ethanol. Furthermore, antibody-specific shift assays confirmed binding of C/EBPβ to the ADH-C/EBP site. In vitro transcription assays confirmed that the hepatic nuclear extracts of ethanol-fed rats significantly enhanced transcriptional activity as compared with extracts from rats fed no ethanol. These data suggest that ethanol can maximize ADH expression by elevating the concentrations of proteins that enhance transcription while simultaneously reducing negative regulators of transcription. Taken together, these results provide a potential mechanism for ethanol-induction of ADH expression. Greater in vitro hepatic nuclear protein binding to Class I ADH-specific C/EBP sites was observed using hepatic nuclear extracts from ethanol-fed rats than those from control rats. This is a relatively specific event. The specificity was studied in several ways. First, the binding results using the consensus C/EBP oligonucleotides demonstrated significantly greater interactions with hepatic nuclear extracts from ethanol-treated rats than controls, whereas when the consensus upstream stimulatory factor and consensus Sp1 oligonucleotides were used, the nuclear protein binding of the ethanol-fed rats and control rats did not differ. Second, hepatic nuclear protein binding to the CYP2E1-specific C/EBP-binding site was equal in ethanol-treated and control groups. These results suggest that increased C/EBP-related transcription factors only bind and activate specific hepatic genes. Further evidence for specificity is provided by a study demonstrating lower promoter activity when there is a 4-bp mutation in the C/EBP-binding site (located between nucleotides −22 and −11 of rat Class 1 ADH gene) (15Cortese J.F. Majewski J.L. Crabb D.W. Edenberg H.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21898-21906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with this latter report. As far as we are aware, this is the first report to provide evidence that C/EBP-related transcription factors interact with the C/EBP site in the proximal promoter region of the Class I ADH gene in the liver of rats fed an ethanol-containing diet. Importantly, the liver tissue studied in this report was collected at a time following chronic ethanol feeding when the ethanol metabolism is predicted to be maximal. Thus, these ADH regulatory events are temporally linked to in vivo ethanol metabolism, thus providing valuable insights into the functional regulation of the principal ethanol metabolizing enzyme. The mechanism underlying the ethanol-induced expression of hepatic Class I ADH most likely involves regulation of these transcription factors. It is also important to note that similar effects were observed in rats infused with ethanol-containing diets for short periods (13 days), well before any demonstrated inflammation, necrosis, or fibrosis, suggesting that the effects on C/EBPs and ADH are not occurring secondary to chronic ethanol exposure (data not shown). Further studies into ethanol regulation of C/EBPs and other genes coordinately regulated by them are underway."

Serotonin treatment of rat uterine myometrial smooth muscle cells induced inositol phosphate (IP) turnover, which was abolished by the 5-HT2A receptor-specific antagonists ketanserin and spiperone. The phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitors U73122 and D609 attenuated serotonin-mediated-IP turnover with a corresponding inhibition of MMP-13 protein production. Subsequent recovery of both MMP-13 protein expression and IP generation was seen following the removal of D609. Protein kinase C (PKC) activators, the diacylglycerol analogue 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), mimicked the effect of serotonin on MMP-13 protein expression; prolonged PMA treatment (which down-regulates PKC) lowered MMP-13 protein levels. The PKC-specific inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I, calphostin C, CGP 41251, and the PKCδ-selective inhibitor rottlerin were able to suppress serotonin up-regulation of MMP-13.

Production of fibrillar collagens (Types I and III) is up-regulated 10-fold in the uterus during pregnancy (1Burgeson R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 2Harkness M.L.R. Harkness R.D. J. Physiol. 1954; 123: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These collagens possess a rigid superhelical structure, which is responsible for providing the tensile strength necessary to accommodate the force exerted by the growing fetus. After parturition, a precisely programmed non-necrotic and non-inflammatory process of connective tissue remodeling occurs, which results in the rapid and dramatic degradation of the collagen amassed and returns the uterus to reproductive competence (3Harkness R.D. Moralee B.E. J. Physiol. 1956; 132: 502-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This transition is initiated by the enzyme interstitial collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase-13; MMP-13),1 a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family. It acts as not only the rate-limiting step but also the committed step in the catalysis of the degradation of extracellular collagen (4Jeffrey J.J. Gross J. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Stricklin G.P. Bauer E.A. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1607-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The expression of MMP-13 occurs during postpartum involution and is not present either during the pregnancy or even within hours prior to parturition. The myometrial smooth muscle cell of the uterus has been identified not only as the source for MMP-13 (6Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Ehlich L.S. Jeffrey J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 129: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) but also that of its natural substrate, collagen (7Ross R. Klebanoff S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 50: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Thus, the myometrial smooth muscle cell provides an interesting paradigm for not only the synthetic needs of the uterus during pregnancy but also the degradative events that occur postpartum. Our laboratory has focused on MMP-13 and the regulatory mechanisms involved in the restructuring of the postpartum uterus by this critical enzyme. To this end, we have developed a primary cell culture system with rat myometrial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) that produce MMP-13 (8Roswit W.T. Rifas L. Gast M.J. Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,9Halme J. Tyree B. Jeffrey J.J. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 199: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We have found that the indoleamine serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is an obligate inducer of MMP-13 in both rat and human myometrial SMCs (8Roswit W.T. Rifas L. Gast M.J. Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Jeffrey J.J. Ehlich L.S. Roswit W.T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 146: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Nuclear run-on analysis demonstrated that serotonin treatment in rat myometrial SMCs increased MMP-13 gene transcription by 6-fold, which corresponded to maximal steady-state mRNA and protein production following exposure to serotonin (11Passaretti T.V. Wilcox B.D. Jeffrey J.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 120: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have determined that interleukin-1 (IL-1) is induced in a serotonin-dependent manner and is itself required for the production of MMP-13 (12Wilcox B.D. Dumin J.A. Jeffrey J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29658-29664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The requisite IL-1 presence acts to not only induce autocrine expression of the genes for IL-1α and β but also that of transin (rat stromelysin) and 92 kDa gelatinase (type IV collagenase), 2J. L. Sanchez and J. J. Jeffrey, unpublished data. 2J. L. Sanchez and J. J. Jeffrey, unpublished data. as well as the gene for IL-6. 3J. A. Dumin and J. J. Jeffrey, manuscript in preparation. 3J. A. Dumin and J. J. Jeffrey, manuscript in preparation. Interestingly, we have also found that serotonin acts to down-regulate the production of genes responsible for the hypertrophic nature of the uterus during pregnancy. Serotonin exerts negative regulatory effects upon the genes for types I and III collagen, fibronectin, and the anti-protease α2-macroglobulin (11Passaretti T.V. Wilcox B.D. Jeffrey J.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 120: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13Huang C. Jeffrey J.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Of particular note, a single serotonin receptor is responsible for mediating both the positive- and negative-regulated serotonin-dependent processes in myometrial smooth muscle cells: the 5-HT2Asubtype (14Rydelek-Fitzgerald L. Wilcox B.D. Teitler M. Jeffrey J.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 91: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although these divergent biochemical processes are mediated through a single receptor subtype, they possess different postreceptor mechanisms. Specifically, while the serotonin-dependent up-regulated genes, MMP-13, transin, 92 kDa gelatinase, IL-1, and IL-6, appear to require IL-1, the down-regulated genes, types I and III collagen, fibronectin, and α2-macroglobulin, are independent of IL-1 influence. Furthermore, phorbol esters, known activators of protein kinase C (PKC), mimic the effects of serotonin on the serotonin-dependent-induced genes while having no effect on the serotonin-dependent down-regulated genes (13Huang C. Jeffrey J.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar,15Wilcox B.D. Rydelek-Fitzgerald L. Jeffrey J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20752-20757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, 8-bromoadenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-bromo-cyclic AMP) mimics the effects of serotonin on the negatively regulated gene products for type I collagen and α2-macroglobulin (11Passaretti T.V. Wilcox B.D. Jeffrey J.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 120: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13Huang C. Jeffrey J.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Thus, the serotonin-mediated induction of MMP-13 and accompanying down-regulation of collagen appears to be via two distinct signaling pathways that must be stringently controlled to preserve the integrity of the uterus during pregnancy. The 5-HT2A receptor subtype possesses the 7 transmembrane domains characteristic of G-protein-coupled receptors. Binding of serotonin has been shown to increase intracellular Ca2+levels (16Nakaki T.

Like other G-protein-coupled receptors, this activation of PKC through the 5-HT2A receptor stimulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, leading to the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) (22Greene E.L.

Although many postreceptor signaling cascades have been described for the 5-HT2A receptor in other systems, little is known about the signaling pathway(s) involved in serotonin-mediated induction of MMP-13 in rat myometrial SMCs. This study indicates that serotonin-induced MMP-13 protein production requires the sequential activation of a phospholipase C pathway, protein kinase C, and ERK1/2.

Primary cell cultures of rat myometrial smooth muscle cells were obtained from 4-day postpartum uteri of Sprague-Dawley rats and used in all experiments. Uteri were minced, washed, and then incubated in 0.05% trypsin in DMEM containing 30 mm HEPES, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 200 μg/ml streptomycin for 1 h at 37 °C. The uterine tissue was then pipetted for ∼20 min/uterus with a 10-ml pipette and then centrifuged at 500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was retained, and the cells were pelleted following centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 10 min, rinsed, and recentrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min. The cells were then resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (v/v), 30 mm HEPES, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 200 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated at a density of 100,000 cells/cm2 and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (v/v), 30 mm HEPES, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 200 μg/ml streptomycin. Upon reaching confluence, the media was then changed to DMEM supplemented with 10% serotonin-free FBS (CS-FBS) (v/v) that had been adsorbed with dextran-coated charcoal (10Jeffrey J.J. Ehlich L.S.

Cells were labeled for 18–24 h with 0.25 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol in inositol-free and serum-free DMEM supplemented with 30 mmHEPES, 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 ng/ml LPS. Immediately prior to experimental treatments, cells were washed with 1–2 ml of inositol-free DMEM. Cells were pretreated in 0.5 ml of the same media containing 20 mm LiCl and, if necessary, the appropriate inhibitors and vehicles for the inhibitors for 30–60 min. 5 μm serotonin (or appropriate concentration of agonist) was then added to challenge the cells (1 h, 37 °C). After the appropriate incubation time had passed, the cells were washed with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and aspirated, and 0.75 ml of ice-cold 20 mm formic acid was then added to stop the reaction. The cells were then placed at −20 °C for ≥1 h. The formation of [3H]inositol phosphates (IP) in response to serotonin/agonist challenge was determined via ion column chromatography. Supernatant fractions were loaded on to AG1-8X dowex columns, and the total [3H]inositol fraction was eluted with 50 mm ammonia solution (pH > 9.0). The bound [3H]inositol phosphates were eluted with 2 mammonium formate. Total IP production was then estimated by determining the ratio of [3H]IP to [3H]inositol plus [3H]IP as described previously (26Conklin B.R. Chabre O. Wong Y.H. Federman A.D. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 31-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Berridge M.J. Downes C.P. Hanley M.R. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of myometrial smooth muscle cells upon reaching confluence were incubated with appropriate compounds, including vehicle controls, in inositol-free and serum-free DMEM for varying times dependent upon treatments, and the media was then removed. Each sample of media was incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 50-μl slurry of heparin-Sepharose beads in 0.05m Tris/0.01 m CaCl2/0.2m NaCl per 1.5–2.0 ml of media to preferentially bind the MMP-13 protein. Dextran sulfate (50 μg/ml 0.05 m Tris, 0.01 m CaCl2) was then used to elute the collagenase off the heparin-Sepharose beads. For protein extraction of PKC isoforms, cells were pretreated for 1 h with the inhibitors and the appropriate vehicle controls, followed by serotonin for 7.5 min, rinsed 2× with ice-cold PBS and scraped off 75 cm2 flasks with 700 μl of lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (5 mmbenzamidine, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm para-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 5 mm imidazole). The cells were then sonicated (for 40 s at 50% duty cycle and with pulsation) and spun at 4 °C for 45 min at 55,000 rpm. The cytosolic fraction (supernatant) was retained while the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer and 1% Triton X-100. The tubes were then vortexed, left on ice for 20 min, and spun at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 5 min. The membrane fraction (supernatant) was retained and the insoluble fraction (pellet) resuspended in 2× sample buffer. Protein determination assays were performed with the Pierce BCA protein assay kit or the Bio-Rad Laboratories protein assay. The ERK1/2 proteins were isolated from cells plated in 75-cm2 flasks. Inhibitors and vehicle controls were preincubated for 1 h, and then serotonin was added for 7.5 min, with the exception of the time course studies, and the cells were rinsed 2× with ice-cold PBS and then scraped with 250 μl of PBS. The cells were spun down for 30 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C and then lysed with hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 20 mm NaF, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors (3 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min on ice. The samples were spun at 13,000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C and the supernatant retained as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in high salt hypotonic buffer (hypotonic buffer as described above with 20% glycerol and 420 mm NaCl) and protease inhibitors and rocked overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the samples were spun at 4 °C for 10 min at 13,000 rpm and the supernatant retained as the nuclear fraction. Protein determination assays were performed as noted above. Protein samples were electrophoresed on 12% (MMP-13), 10% (pERK1/2), and 7.5% (PKC) SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions following protocols established by Towbin et al. (28Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and incubated with the appropriate primary antisera. MMP-13 antiserum was used at a 1:2500 dilution. All PKC antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY except for PKCε (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), PKCη and PKCζ (BioMol Research Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA). PKC isoform antibody dilutions were as follows: PKCα 1:1000, PKCβ 1:250, PKCγ 1:1000, PKCδ 1:500, PKCε 1:1000, PKCι 1:250, PKCλ 1:250, PKCη 1:250, and PKCζ 1:100. ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. ERK1/2 and pERK1/2 antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG were used as the secondary antisera at a 1:10000 dilution. The proteins were detected using a horseradish peroxidase substrate kit from Amersham Biosciences. Serotonin-mediated MMP-13 production occurs through the 5-HT2A receptor, and this receptor is known to mediate phospholipase C activation (18Conn P.J. Sanders-Bush E. Neuropharmacology. 1984; 23: 993-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Conn P.J. Sanders-Bush E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1985; 234: 195-203PubMed Google Scholar, 20Roth B.L. Nakaki T.

Pharmacol. 1987; 10: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that 5-HT2A receptor-selective agonists (1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane HCL (DOI) and quipazine) and antagonists (ketanserin and spiperone) can mimic and inhibit, respectively, the effects of serotonin on MMP-13 production (14Rydelek-Fitzgerald L. Wilcox B.D. Teitler M. Jeffrey J.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 91: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To determine if binding of serotonin to the 5-HT2A receptor (which ultimately results in MMP-13 up-regulation) induces PLC activity, rat uterine smooth muscle cells were challenged with serotonin (5 μm) or the 5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI (5 μm), and IP generation was quantified. Serotonin increased inositol phosphate production to levels ∼10-fold over basal (Fig. 1 A). This serotonin-mediated response was blocked in the presence of the 5-HT2A receptor-specific antagonists ketanserin (1 μm) or spiperone (1 μm) (Fig.1 B). The receptor agonist DOI mimicked the effects of serotonin on IP production (Fig. 1 A), an effect that was attenuated by spiperone (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that in rat myometrial smooth muscle cells, serotonin can activate PLC through the 5-HT2A receptor subtype. To further confirm the role of phospholipase C in the production of MMP-13, the PLC inhibitor U73122 and its inactive analogue U73343 were used to determine their effects on serotonin-induced inositol phosphate turnover. U73122 inhibited the release of inositol phosphates ∼50% while the inactive analogueU73343 had no effect (Fig. 1 D). This inhibitory response was dose-dependent with maximal inhibition at 20 μmU73122. At this same concentration, U73122 was able to attenuate the serotonin-dependent production of MMP-13 protein expression following serotonin treatment while U73343 did not exert a significant effect on MMP-13 protein levels (Fig. 1,E and F). The two bands seen in the MMP-13 standard are representative of the pro-form of MMP-13 and its active counterpart, which has approximately a 10-kDa loss in mass. Initially, we utilized the PC-PLC inhibitor tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate (D609) as a negative control for our PI-PLC activity assays. Interestingly, measurements of IP generation in the presence of serotonin revealed that D609 depressed inositol phosphate production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A); the maximal effect was seen at 250 μm. This inhibition maximally decreased IP turnover by ∼50% (Fig. 2, A and B), as seen with U73122. Similarly, MMP-13 protein production was attenuated by D609 and reached levels comparable to those of the negative control by 150 μm D609 (Fig. 2 C). Although the cells were viable after D609 treatment, we wanted to determine if there had been some detrimental effects to their cellular functions that might account for the inhibitory effects on IP production. To that end, we examined if the effects of D609 on serotonin-stimulated PLC activity and MMP-13 production were reversible. D609 was incubated overnight and then washed out of the cells prior to treatment with serotonin. Recovery of serotonin-mediated IP production was seen 1-day post-D609 treatment and IP turnover was higher than that of the control (Fig. 2 D,left). However, in the days following, the levels of IP production equalized between the cells that had been treated with D609 and controls. With respect to D609 effects on MMP-13 levels, protein production recovered within 6 h of D609 removal and serotonin challenge (Fig. 2 D, right). The particular control sample (+5HT) at 6 h with nearly undetectable MMP-13 production was likely due to the occasional differences seen in varying primary cell culture preparations. These results suggest that PC-PLC may regulate IP generation and MMP-13 production in rat uterine SMCs by an as yet unknown mechanism. The second messenger DAG, produced by the activation of phospholipase C, is a known activator of protein kinase C. To examine the role of PKC in MMP-13 production, cells were challenged with DOG, a cell-permeable DAG analogue, for 6 h. DOG was able to induce the production of MMP-13 to a level comparable to that of serotonin (Fig.3 A). Wilcox et al.(15Wilcox B.D. Rydelek-Fitzgerald L. Jeffrey J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20752-20757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that short-term exposure to phorbol myristate acetate mimics the effects of serotonin on MMP-13 protein production in myometrial smooth muscle cells. On the other hand, prolonged exposure to PMA is known to deplete PKC (29Johnson J.A. Adak S. Mochly-Rosen D. Life Sci. 1995; 57: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 30Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sako T. Ohshima S. Yoshizumi T. Sakurai M. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 1988; 156: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated for 24 h with 25 nm PMA to down-regulate phorbol ester-sensitive PKC isoforms and then challenged with either 5 μm serotonin or 25 nm PMA for 6 h. Control cells were not exposed to PMA and were treated in concert with the pretreated cells, and the media collected after 6 h. Acute exposure to PMA stimulates the production of higher levels of MMP-13 protein than that of the serotonin-stimulated response (Fig.3 A). However, cells that had been pretreated with PMA to deplete PKC protein expressed significantly lower levels of MMP-13 protein as compared with cells exposed to either serotonin or PMA for only 6 h. Following down-regulation with PMA, subsequent agonist challenge with either serotonin or PMA did not elicit a comparable response to that of controls. These results support a role for PKC in the regulation of MMP-13 expression in rat myometrial SMCs. PKC isoforms α, β, δ, ε, ζ have been identified in the myometrium of pregnant and non-pregnant rats. Since 4-day postpartum uteri are used to obtain our rat primary cultures of myometrial smooth muscle cells, we wanted to determine if there were any significant differences in PKC isoform expression in this cell system. The PKC isoforms that appear to be present in the cytosol of postpartum uteri are α, β, δ, ε, λ/ι, η, and ζ (Fig. 3 B). These isoforms represent all three classes of PKC, classical (α, β; cPKC), novel (δ, ε; nPKC) and atypical (λ/ι, ζ; aPKC). The PKC isoforms ι and δ appear to be the most highly expressed within the rat myometrium while the γ isoform was undetectable. The translocation of PKC isoforms from the cytosol to the membrane is considered to be a determinant of PKC activation (32Mosior M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25526-25533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To identify which PKC isoforms in particular participate in the signaling cascade initiated by serotonin, which results in MMP-13 production, we examined the expression of various PKC isoforms in both the cytosol and membrane fractions of cell lysates following serotonin treatment. Upon the addition of serotonin, there was a marked decrease (−21%) in PKCδ expression in the cytosolic fraction of cell lysates and a corresponding increase (+32%) in the membrane fraction (Fig.3 C). PKCε also showed a similar expression pattern following serotonin treatment with increased translocation to the membrane (+36%). On the other hand, PKCα expression was present in the cytosolic fractions of all the experimental treatments with an increase in expression after exposure to serotonin. However, PKCα expression was nearly undetectable in the membrane fractions of the cell lysates of rat myometrial smooth muscle cells. Neither PKCβ nor PKCι exhibited translocation from the cytosol to the membrane following serotonin treatment. These results are consistent with a role for the nPKC isoforms δ and/or ε in the signaling pathway from PLC to MMP-13 protein production. The PKC activator DOG up-regulated the production of MMP-13 in rat myometrial smooth muscle cells. Activation of PKC by acute exposure to PMA, and the depletion of PKC by prolonged PMA exposure resulted in the up-regulation and down-regulation, respectively, of MMP-13 protein levels. These factors then led to further examination of the role of PKC in this system. Bisindolylmaleimide I and CGP 41251, two potent staurosporine analogues that act as competitive inhibitors on the ATP-binding site of PKC and are more selective for the cPKCs, were able to inhibit the serotonin-mediated signal transduction pathway and attenuated the MMP-13 protein production at a concentration of 10 nm (Fig. 4, A andB).

The enforced production of glutamate racemase, however, resulted in suppression of cell proliferation. In the Escherichia coli JM109/pGR3 clone, the overproducer of glutamate racemase, the copy number (i.e. replication efficiency) of plasmid DNA declined dramatically, whereas the E. coli WM335 mutant that is defective in the gene of glutamate racemase showed little genetic competency. The comparatively low and high activities for DNA supercoiling were contained in the E. coli JM109/pGR3 and WM335 cells, respectively. Furthermore, we found that the DNA gyrase ofE. coli was modulated by the glutamate racemase of E. coli in the presence of UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine, which is a peptidoglycan precursor and functions as an absolute activator for the racemase. This is the first finding of the enzyme protein participating in both d-amino acid metabolism and DNA processing.

UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine fast protein liquid chromatography pyridoxal 5′-phosphate isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside Bacterial cell walls contain d-amino acids as essential components of peptidoglycans (alternatively, mureins).d-Glutamate is introduced into peptidoglycan through its addition to UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine (UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala),1a peptidoglycan precursor, by UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala:d-glutamate ligase (EC6.3.2.9). Glutamate racemase (EC 5.1.1.3) catalyzes the racemization of glutamate (1Ashiuchi M. Yoshimura T. Kitamura T. Kawata Y. Nagai J. Gorlatov S. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The genes encoding glutamate racemase are ubiquitously inherited in bacteria, and the Escherichia coli WM335 mutant, in which the enzyme gene was disrupted, requiredd-glutamate for growth (2Doublet P. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5772-5779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings indicate that glutamate racemase provides d-glutamate for peptidoglycan synthesis. Glutamate racemase and its gene hereafter are designated MurI and murI, respectively. The activity of glutamate racemase, however, usually cannot be detected in the cells of bacteria, except in a part of lactobacilli and bacilli (3Ashiuchi M. Tani K. Soda K. Misono H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Doublet et al. (4Doublet P. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) showed that MurI of E. coli catalyzed the glutamate racemization only in the presence of UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala and concluded that this peptidoglycan precursor is an absolute activator of the MurI enzyme. On the other hand, the fact that no ribosome-binding sequence is found upstream of the open reading frames in the murI genes of various bacteria and the initial codon of the open reading frames often includes the substitution of the usual ATG for the unusual TTG or GTG (5Yoshimura T. Ashiuchi M. Esaki N. Kobatake C. Choi S.-Y. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24242-24246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ashiuchi M. Soda K. Misono H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) suggests that the murI gene is translated on a specific mechanism that is still unidentified. It is generally assumed that MurI is strictly controlled so as to operate only during peptidoglycan synthesis (eventually during cell division). In E. coli clones, the enforced production of MurIs resulted in characteristic changes, such as aberration in nucleoid separation (7Balikó G. Venetianer P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6571-6577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and suppression of cell proliferation (6Ashiuchi M. Soda K. Misono H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Balikó G. Venetianer P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6571-6577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the attenuation of murI gene expression and the regulation of MurI production are physiologically significant. In the absence ofd-glutamate, the cells of the E. coli WM335 mutant formed filament elongates (2Doublet P. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5772-5779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as did the mutants defective in the genes involved in cell division. These observations imply that MurI plays a role in cell homeostasis other than in thed-glutamate supply. However, there have been surprisingly few examples focusing on the multifunctionality of MurI until now. In this study, the in vivo and in vitro effects of MurI on some DNA processing in E. coli were investigated. Here we report the novel function of glutamate racemase, i.e. the modulation of DNA gyrase activity. Supercoiled pBR322, calf thymus DNA topoisomerase I, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) were purchased from TaKaRa Shuzo. Relaxed pBR322 was prepared from supercoiled pBR322 with the DNA topoisomerase I by the method of Ferro and Olivera (8Ferro A.M. Olivera B.M. J. Biol.

E. coli JM109 was purchased from TaKaRa Shuzo. E. coli WM335 mutant was a kind gift from Prof. Dr. W. Messer of the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics. Vector plasmids pKK223-3 and pTrc99A, both of which contain an ampicillin (Amp) resistance gene, were obtained from Amersham Biosciences, and pACYC184 that carries a tetracycline (Tet) resistance gene was from Nippon Gene. Both plasmids pGR2 and pGR3 were constructed according to the strategy described previously (5Yoshimura T. Ashiuchi M. Esaki N. Kobatake C. Choi S.-Y. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24242-24246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used for analysis of the function of glutamate racemase. For the production of E. coli DNA gyrase (GyrAB), plasmid pGYRA, a pTrc99A having the gyrA gene, and plasmid pGYRB, a pTrc99A having the gyrB gene, were designed by the method of Mizuuchi et al. (10Mizuuchi K. Mizuuchi M. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9199-9201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain E. coliDNA toposiomerase IV (ParCE), plasmid pPARC, a pTrc99A having theperC gene, and plasmid pPARE, a pTrc99A having theparE gene, were prepared by the method of Kato et al. (11Kato J. Suzuki H. Ikeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25676-25684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli cells were transformed with the vector plasmid DNA by the CaCl2 method (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or the TSS method (13Chung C.T. Niemela S.L.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid copy numbers were determined densitometrically with a Digital Science EDAS 120 LE system (Invitrogen) by the method of Projan et al. (14Projan S.J. Carleton S. Novick R.P. Plasmid. 1983; 9: 183-190Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Glutamate racemase was assayed by the method described previously (3Ashiuchi M. Tani K. Soda K. Misono H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). One unit of MurI was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol ofl-glutamate per min. DNA gyrase was assayed as follows. The reaction mixture (20 μl) comprised 2 μmol of Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.4 μmol of KCl, 0.2 μmol of MgCl2, 0.1 μmol of ATP, 0.1 μmol of spermidine hydrochloride, 0.1 μmol of dithiothreitol, 2 nmol of EDTA, 0.2 mg of glycerol, 0.5 μg of relaxed pBR322, and enzyme. The enzyme was replaced with water in a blank. The reaction was essentially performed at 37 °C for 1 h and terminated by the phenol-chloroform extraction (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was electrophoresed in 1% (w/v) agarose gel (14 × 14 cm) submerged in TPE buffer (90 mm Tris-phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) at 4 V/cm at 25 °C for 2.5 h. Gel was stained with ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml). The activity was estimated from both an increase in the density of bands corresponding to the supercoiled DNA thus formed (10Mizuuchi K. Mizuuchi M. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9199-9201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a decrease in that of the relaxed DNA substrate, which were quantitated with the Digital Science EDAS 120 LE system. One unit of GyrAB was defined as the amount of enzyme that converted one-half of relaxed pBR322 into the supercoils per 30 min. DNA topoisomerases I (TopA) and IV (ParCE) were assayed in the absence (15Bhaduri T. Bagui T.K. Sikder D. Nagaraja V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13925-13932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the presence of ATP (11Kato J. Suzuki H. Ikeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25676-25684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. One unit of both topoisomerases was defined as the amount of enzyme required to fully relax 0.5 μg of supercoiled pBR322 per h. E. coli MurI was purified by the method described previously (1Ashiuchi M. Yoshimura T. Kitamura T. Kawata Y. Nagai J. Gorlatov S. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The specific activity was 9.6 units mg−1. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using its theoretical molar extinction (ε278 = 22,280 m−1cm−1) (1Ashiuchi M. Yoshimura T. Kitamura T. Kawata Y. Nagai J. Gorlatov S.

Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Since overproduction of DNA gyrase into an active form, i.e.a GyrA2B2 heterotetramer (molecular mass, 373,767 Da), results in strong inhibition of cell growth in bacteria,E. coli GyrAB was prepared by reconstitution of the A subunit (GyrA, 96,975 Da) and the B subunit (GyrB, 89,893 Da) (10Mizuuchi K. Mizuuchi M. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9199-9201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lyses with lysozyme and Brij-58, removal of the DNA extracted with streptomycin, and precipitation of proteins with ammonium sulfate were conducted according to the method of Nakanishi et al. (9Nakanishi A. Oshida T. Matsushita T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Ohnuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1933-1938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The GyrA preparation from E. coli JM109/pGYRA cells (110 mg of protein) was applied to a Bio-Rad Bio-Logic FPLC system equipped with a Bio-Scale DEAE anion-exchange column (volume, 20 ml; Bio-Rad) (3Ashiuchi M. Tani K. Soda K. Misono H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); the fraction eluted with 0.4 m NaCl contained only the GyrA protein. The GyrB preparation from E. coli JM109/pGYRB cells (88 mg of protein) was subjected to affinity chromatography on a novobiocin-Sepharose column (1.5 × 7 cm; volume, 12.5 ml) (9Nakanishi A. Oshida T. Matsushita T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Ohnuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1933-1938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); the fraction eluted with 2 m KCl plus 5 m urea contained only the GyrB protein. The enzyme was reconstituted by incubation of the purified GyrA and GyrB at an equimolar ratio at 25 °C for 30 min in the presence of 0.1 mm ATP. The specific activity was 3.8 × 104 units mg−1. Protein concentrations were determined using its theoretical molar extinction (ε278 = 248,200m−1 cm−1) (10Mizuuchi K. Mizuuchi M. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9199-9201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli ParCE was purified by the method of Kato et al. (11Kato J. Suzuki H. Ikeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25676-25684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity was 3.3 × 103units mg−1. Protein concentrations were determined using its theoretical molar extinction (ε278 = 229,920m−1 cm−1) (11Kato J. Suzuki H. Ikeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25676-25684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether the production of MurI affects DNA processing in E. coli, we first assayed the plasmid copy numbers in several E. coliclones. In this experiment, both plasmid pGR2, a pKK223-3 having themurI gene isolated from the E. coli chromosome, and plasmid pGR3, a pKK223-3 having the designed murI gene in which a typical ribosome-binding sequence was introduced (5Yoshimura T. Ashiuchi M. Esaki N. Kobatake C. Choi S.-Y. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24242-24246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were used. The plasmid pKK223-3, the multiplication of which is entirely dependent on the replication machineries of the host cells, i.e. the θ mechanism (16Inoue N. Uchida H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1208-1214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a control (usually over 20 copies). As shown in Fig. 1, the enforced production of MurI by the use of the plasmid pGR3 resulted in a dramatic decrease in the copy numbers in both E. coliJM109 and WM335 clone cells (one to several copies). The result also showed that a decreased plasmid copy number in the E. coliWM335 mutant was restored by complementation of the nativemurI gene with the plasmid pGR2. A decline in negative superhelicity of the plasmid in the MurI overproducer, E. coli JM109/pGR3, but not of those in E. coli JM109/pKK223–3 and JM109/pGR2 was observed by the use of chloroquine (data not shown), and this was consistent with what Balikó and Venetianer (7Balikó G. Venetianer P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6571-6577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) had proposed. It thus seems likely that the replication of ColE1-type plasmids such as pKK223-3 is difficult to complete properly in E. coli cells exhibiting aberration of the production of MurI due to deficiency in the controls of DNA superhelical density (11Kato J. Suzuki H. Ikeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25676-25684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MurI would also influence the replication of chromosome, since the overexpression and disruption of themurI gene allowed the appearance of abnormal cell growth in E. coli (2Doublet P. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5772-5779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ashiuchi M. Soda K. Misono H. Biosci. Biotechnol.

While examining characteristics of the E. coli WM335 mutant, we found that its genetic competence declined dramatically compared with that of E. coli JM109, which has an intact murI gene, and, further, that such a decline in genetic competence of the mutant was recovered by the complementation of the murI gene with the plasmid pGR2 (Table I). Chandler and Smith (17Chandlar M.S. Smith R.A. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 169: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) recently reported that, in bacteria, TopA catalyzing the reverse of the DNA gyrase reaction was essential for the development of genetic competence. The relationship between the development of the genetic competence and the intracellular activity for DNA supercoiling was demonstrated. Our results indicated that MurI affects the intracellular activity for DNA supercoiling.Table ICompetency of E. coli WM335 mutant defective in the glutamate racemase geneE. colirecipientsVectorsaFifteen ng of the DNA was used for the transformation experiment.CompetencyCaCl2bAn E. colitransformation method with CaCl2; Sambrook et al.(12).TSScAn E. colitransformation method with polyethylene glycol; Chung et al.(13).JM109pKK223–37.8 × 1031.2 × 105pACYC1844.0 × 1039.2 × 104WM335pKK223–307.8pACYC18405.4JM109/pGR2pACYC1842.2 × 1033.4 × 104WM335/pGR2pACYC1840.8 × 1026.6 × 102E. coli JM109 transformants with pKK223–3 or pACYC184,E. coli WM335 transformants with pKK223–3 or pACYC184, and both E. coli JM109/pGR2 and WM335/pGR2 transformants with pACYC184 were grown at 37 °C for 24 h on an LB plate (12Sambrook J.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5772-5779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing Amp or Tet, and an LB plate containing Amp, Tet, and 0.1 mm IPTG, respectively. Competency of each E. coli recipient was assessed on the basis of the number of colonies being formed. Data are representative of an average of eight independent experiments. The intracellular activity for DNA supercoiling was practically determined in the balance of the activities of TopA and GyrAB (18Snoep J.L. van der Weijden C.C. Andersen H.W. Westerhoff H.V. Jensen P.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1662-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and net DNA supercoiling activity of bacterial cells can be determined by using the DNA gyrase assay system because the cell extracts essentially contain both the activities of GyrAB, which introduces negative supercoils into DNAs, and of TopA, which unwinds the supercoiled DNAs. In this study, comparatively low and high DNA supercoiling activities were observed in the cells of E. coli JM109/pGR3 and WM335, respectively (Fig. 2). The supercoiling activity ofE. coli JM109/pGR3 cells was one-tenth that of E. coli JM109/pKK223-3 cells; the intracellular activities ofE. coli WM335 and E. coli WM335/pGR3 were 2-fold higher and 4-fold less than that of E. coli WM335/pGR2, respectively. In contrast, there was apparently little difference in the activities of TopA among the E. coli clones used: JM109/pKK223-3, 31 ± 7 (units mg−1); JM109/pGR2, 34 ± 12; JM109/pGR3, 39 ± 14; WM335/pKK223-3, 28 ± 13; WM335/pGR2, 30 ± 5; WM335/pGR3, 33 ± 6. It was thus suggested that MurI affects the intracellular activity of GyrAB inE. coli. To clarify if MurI modulates GyrAB, we followed a change in the apparent activity of GyrAB in the coexistence of various concentrations of MurI. Bovine serum albumin, instead of E. coli MurI, was added to the DNA gyrase assay system as a negative control (Fig.3, open diamonds). As shown in Fig. 3 A, GyrAB was inhibited by E. coli MurI in the presence of UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala (closed circles) but not both enantiomers of glutamate (open triangles and open squares). Fig. 3 A also reveals that GyrAB probably forms a 1:1 molar stoichiometric inactive complex with MurI activated by UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala. The apparent inhibition constant K i(app) of MurI against GyrAB was estimated to be 6.8 nm (Fig.3 B) On the other hand, E. coli MurI (0.5 nm) kept the activity of glutamate racemase even in the presence of a 250-fold molar excess of GyrAB. ParCE, a GyrAB paralogue, participates in the chromosome partitioning (11Kato J. Suzuki H. Ikeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25676-25684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that occurs after the DNA replication in cell division. The enzyme (20 nm), however, remained active when coexisting with abundant MurI (125 nm). These suggest that DNA gyrase is the target of glutamate racemase in E. coli. DNA gyrase (alternatively, bacterial DNA topoisomerase II) is a pivotal enzyme for various types of DNA processing, including DNA replication and gene expression, and the strict modulation of the intracellular activity is indispensable for proper cell division (10Mizuuchi K. Mizuuchi M. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9199-9201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first endogenous DNA gyrase modulator, designated as GyrI (9Nakanishi A. Oshida T. Matsushita T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Ohnuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1933-1938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was identified from E. coli; it was identical to the SbmC protein, which had been previously characterized as a member of the DNA repair system. Because glutamate racemase, however, has been classified into the group of d-amino acid-metabolic enzymes but not into that of DNA-processing proteins, such as the GyrI protein, and does not have any consensus sequences that can be observed in the DNA-binding motifs (3Ashiuchi M. Tani K. Soda K. Misono H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 5Yoshimura T. Ashiuchi M. Esaki N. Kobatake C. Choi S.-Y. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24242-24246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ashiuchi M. Soda K. Misono H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the discovery of the novel function of glutamate racemase as the endogenous inhibitor for DNA gyrase was quite unexpected. Nevertheless, the existence of such multifunctional glutamate racemases would be advantageous in the peculiar processes seen only during bacterial cell division, in which the synthesis of the peptidoglycan molecules (as an essential constituent of the septum and cell walls) follows DNA processing (e.g. the decatenation of daughter DNAs catalyzed by DNA gyrase) (11Kato J. Suzuki H. Ikeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25676-25684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), for example. In bacterial glutamate racemases, E. coli MurI is functionally particular; it is led into an active form by UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala (4Doublet P. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). E. coli MurI thus operates only during the peptidoglycan synthesis and changes again into an inactive form with exhaustion of UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala after peptidoglycan synthesis. As shown in Fig. 3 A, UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala was essential for the inhibition of GyrAB by E. coli MurI, suggesting that the function of DNA gyrase is suppressed by glutamate racemase at the early stage of the septation in E. coli cells. It seems likely that this step is important to avoid the appearances of abnormal DNA replication and decatenation due to excessive DNA gyrase activity. We have identified the glutamate racemase isozyme of Bacillus subtilis, YrpC (lately B. subtilis MurI), which was not modulated by UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala (6Ashiuchi M. Soda K. Misono H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Unlike E. coli MurI,B. subtilis MurI, whether coexisting with UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala or not, inhibited DNA gyrase. 2M. Ashiuchi, E. Kuwana, K. Komatsu, K. Soda, and H. Misono, manuscript in preparation. Although Doubletet al. (4Doublet P. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) previously mentioned a toxicity ofd-glutamate produced by glutamate racemase on the metabolism and growth of bacterial cells, our observations show that an active form of glutamate racemase itself but not its reaction product,i.e. d-glutamate, is required for the inhibition of DNA gyrase, a most crucial enzyme in bacterial cell homeostasis. Unlike usual amino acid racemases, glutamate racemase contains no coenzymes such as PLP (3Ashiuchi M. Tani K. Soda K. Misono H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). There is no sequence homology between glutamate racemase and usual amino acid racemases (6Ashiuchi M. Soda K. Misono H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The catalytic efficiency of glutamate racemase is exceedingly low compared with those of PLP-dependent amino acid racemases (5Yoshimura T. Ashiuchi M. Esaki N. Kobatake C. Choi S.-Y. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24242-24246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the orthologues of glutamate racemase have been found from various organisms, including peptidoglycan-less organisms such as archaea, plants, and humans (19Strausberg, R. (2000) The Human Tumor Gene Index for Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (CGAP) at National Cancer Institute(www.ncbi.nlm. nih. gov/ncicgap).Google Scholar). Most of these proteins, however, have not been characterized yet because of their loss of function as glutamate racemase. It was recently reported that the glutamate racemase orthologue-encoding gene was expressed to excess in human carcinoma (19Strausberg, R. (2000) The Human Tumor Gene Index for Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (CGAP) at National Cancer Institute(www.ncbi.nlm. nih. gov/ncicgap).Google Scholar), in which abnormal DNA replication frequently took place during cell division. On the other hand, among other PLP-independent amino acid racemases, the proline racemase from Trypanosoma cruziwas found to exhibit the function as an immune B-cell mitogen (20Reina-San-Martin B. Degrave W. Rougeot C. Cosson A. Chamond N. Cordeiro-Da-Silva A. Arala-Chaves M. Coutinho A. Minoprio P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Some PLP-independent amino acid racemases including glutamate racemase have possibly evolved from ancient proteins that had not been originally involved in amino acid metabolism. It remains to be investigated whether glutamate racemase-like proteins substantially modulate DNA topoisomerases, as their detailed structural analyses could provide insights into the molecular evolution ofd-amino acid-metabolic enzymes, deepen the understanding of the mechanism of cell division, and result in the design of novel pharmaceuticals."
https://openalex.org/W2050665761,"Chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate proteoglycans are distinguished by differences in their proportion of d-glucuronosyl andl-iduronosyl residues, the latter being formed by chondroitin-glucuronate 5-epimerase during or after glycosaminoglycan chain polymerization. To investigate the influence of the core protein on the extent of epimerization, we expressed chimeric proteins in 293 HEK cells constructed from intact or modified Met1–Gln153 of decorin (DCN), which normally has a single dermatan sulfate chain at Ser34, in combination with intact or modified Leu241–Ser353 of CSF-1, which has a chondroitin sulfate attachment site at Ser309. Transfected DCNM1-Q153, like full-length DCN, contained ∼20%l-iduronate. Conversely, transfected CSF-1L241-S353, attached C-terminally on the DCN prepropeptide, contained almost exclusively d-glucuronate. Transfected intact chimeric DCNM1-Q153–CSF-1L241-S353, with two glycosaminoglycan chains, also contained almost exclusivelyd-glucuronate in chains at both sites, as did chimeras in which alanine was substituted for serine at either of the glycosaminoglycan attachment sites. Nevertheless, undersulfated intact chimeric proteoglycan was an effective substrate for epimerization of glucuronate to iduronate residues when incubated with microsomal proteins and 3′-phosphoadenylylphosphosulfate. C-terminal truncation constructs were prepared from the full-length chimera with an alanine substitution at the CSF-1 glycosaminoglycan attachment site. Transfected truncations retaining the alanine-blocked site contained chains with essentially only glucuronate, whereas those further truncated by 49 or more amino acids and missing the modified attachment site contained chains with ∼15% iduronate. This 49-amino acid region contains a 7-amino acid motif that appears to be conserved in several chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. The results are consistent with a model in which the core protein, possibly via this motif, is responsible for routing to subcellular compartments with or without sufficient access to chondroitin-glucuronate 5-epimerase for the addition of chains with or without iduronate residues, respectively.

Glycoconjugate J. 1996; 13: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar and 2Prydz K. Dalen K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two types of galactosaminoglycans, chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate, are primarily distinguished by the absence or presence ofl-IdoUA residues, respectively. The C-5 inversion ofd-GlcUA to l-IdoUA occurs on the polymer level (3Malmström A. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3419-3425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and involves an abstraction of the C-5 hydrogen of the uronosyl residues (4Malmström A. Biochem. J. 1981; 198: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Sulfation at carbon atom 4 of adjacent galactosamine residues prevents back-epimerization to d-GlcUA (3Malmström A. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3419-3425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Malmström A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 161-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The responsible enzyme, chondroitin-glucuronate 5-epimerase (EC 5.3.1.19), has not yet been characterized at the molecular level. However, a two-base reaction mechanism was postulated, involving a monoproticl-ido-specific base and a polyproticd-gluco-specific base, during the action of the enzyme on an Escherichia coli-derived capsular polysaccharide (6Hannesson H.H. Hagner-McWhirter A. Tiedemann K. Lindahl U. Malmström A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The C-5 epimerization of the β1–4-linked GlcUA residues in heparan sulfate is accomplished by the action of a different enzyme (7Malmström A. Åberg L. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), named heparosanN-sulfate-glucuronate 5-epimerase (EC 5.3.1.17), which has been characterized by cDNA cloning (8Li J. Hagner-McWhirter A. Kjéllen L. Palgi J. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28158-28163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and kinetic studies (9Hagner-McWhirter A. Hannesson H.H. Campbell P. Westley J. Rodén L. Lindahl U. Li J.P. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Iduronic acid-containing glycosaminoglycans have a greater conformational flexibility than glycosaminoglycans composed only of GlcUA as the hexuronic acid moiety (10Ferro D.R. Provasoli A. Ragazzi M.

Additionally,l-IdoUA residues are more frequently 2-O-sulfated than d-GlcUA residues, allowing the appearance of clustered, highly charged domains along the glycosaminoglycan chain. Hence, the degree of epimerization is of functional relevance. For example, only dermatan sulfate and not chondroitin sulfate can stimulate thrombin inhibition by heparin cofactor II (15Linhardt R.J. al Hakim A. Liu J.A. Hoppensteadt D. Mascellani G. Bianchini P. Fareed J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1609-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 16Mascellani G. Liverani L. Bianchini P. Parma B. Torri G. Bisio A. Guerrini M. Casu B.

Biochem. 1994; 223: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and an altered dermatan sulfate structure may be of pathophysiological importance during the development of arteriosclerosis (18Shirk R.A. Parthasarathy N. San Antonio J.D. Church F.C. Wagner W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18085-18092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Various cell types synthesize simultaneously proteoglycans of the lectican family (reviewed in Ref. 19Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegård D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10116-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), which carry multiple chondroitin sulfate chains, and proteoglycans of the small leucine-rich protein family (reviewed in Ref. 20Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18843-18846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). DCN1 and biglycan are the most intensely studied members of the latter family. They carry either only one or two galactosaminoglycan chains, which, with some exceptions, are rich in l-IdoUA residues (21Hausser H. Schönherr E. Kresse H. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 22Cheng F. Heinegård D. Malmström A. Schmidtchen A. Yoshida K. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Whereas the variability of epimerization within the family of small leucine-rich proteoglycans may be explained by differences in the activity of chondroitin-glucuronate 5-epimerase, the reasons for the different extent of epimerization of proteoglycans being synthesized by the very same cell are not yet understood. Several not mutually exclusive hypotheses may explain the experimental findings. The respective core proteins may influence epimerase activity or may alter the degree of modification of the linkage region components GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl by phosphorylation and/or sulfation, which may be important for subsequent biosynthetic events (23Ueno M. Yamada S. Zako M. Bernfield M. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29134-29140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Alternatively, different proteoglycans may encounter different multicomponent complexes of synthesizing enzymes with different epimerase activities along their transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the trans-Golgi network. To address these possibilities, we generated chimeric core proteins composed of truncated forms of two proteoglycans, each characterized by the presence of a single glycosaminoglycan chain. TheN-terminal part of DCN, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan carrying a dermatan sulfate chain, was linked with the central portion of the proteoglycan form of CSF-1 (M-CSF), which is characterized by the presence of a single chondroitin sulfate chain (24Schwarz K. Breuer B. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22023-22028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Price L.K. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L. Stanley E.R. J. Biol.

Additional mutants, truncated in the CSF-1 moiety, were also generated. It was shown previously that individual MG-63 osteosarcoma cells can express simultaneously DCN and the proteoglycan form of CSF-1, which differ greatly in their d-GlcUA/l-IdoUA ratios (21Hausser H. Schönherr E. Kresse H. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). First, the cDNA for DCNM1-Q153, including 120 bp of the 5′-untranslated sequence and a stop codon, was amplified by PCR from full-length human cDNA (28Beavan L.A. Quentin-Hoffmann E. Schönherr E. Snigula F. Leroy J.G. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9856-9862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in pGem3Z by using the primer pair 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′ (T7-forward primer) and 5′-CTGAAGAGTTTTGGGCATTTTTTC-3′ (reverse and complement primer). Similarly, the cDNA for Leu241–Val554 of CSF-1 in pGem-T (27Partenheimer A. Schwarz K. Wrocklage C. Kölsch E. Kresse H. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5557-5565PubMed Google Scholar), including a downstream located part of the vector sequence, was amplified by using the T7-forward primer mentioned above and the reverse and complement primer 5′-CTGCACACAGTGGATCCAGG-3′. The purified amplicons were ligated after treatment with T4-kinase and used as template for the amplification of the chimeric cDNA with the primer pair 5′-ATGAAGGCCACTATCATCCTC-3′ and 5′-CGTCTATGATGCAGGGAGTGGAGA-3′, thereby introducing a stop codon after the codon for Ser353 of CSF-1. The PCR product was directly ligated via its A overhangs into the pCR3-Uni vector (Invitrogen) and used to transform competent E. coli DH5α. The cDNAs for truncated DCNM1-Q153 and truncated and mutant chimeras were generated by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), with the cDNA of the chimera serving as template and high purity salt-free quality oligonucleotides (MWG Biotech) as primers. The method uses forward and reverse primers that carry the base exchange in the center of their sequence and anneal to identical positions of the plasmid. High fidelity Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase was used for amplification. The PCR conditions were 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 14 min at 69 °C. After 30 PCR cycles, the methylated template was degraded by DpnI, and XL1-Blue supercompetent cells were transformed without prior ligation of the PCR product. The forward primers used to introduce stop codons or amino acid exchanges in the original chimera (full-length DCN cDNA in the case of DCNM1-Q153), respectively, were as follows: generation of DCNM1-Q153, 5′-GCCCAAAACTCTTCAGTAGCTGCGTGCCCATG; mutation S34A of the DCN moiety to eliminate the first glycosaminoglycan attachment site, 5′-CTAGAAGATGAGGCTGCTGGGATAGGCCCAG-3; mutation S309A of the CSF-1 sequence (designated S222A in the chimera) to remove the second glycosaminoglycan attachment site, 5′-CCCAGAAGAAGCCGCTGGAGAGGCCAG-3′. Truncated chimeras were generated by using the cDNA of the last mentioned chimera as template. The respective forward primers were as follows: truncation of the CSF-1 moiety at Lys250/Lys163 (the first number of the amino acid indicates the number in the full-length sequence of CSF-1 and the second one the number appearing in the chimeric protein): 5′-GCAGTGCCAAGTAGCGGCCACCCAG-3′; truncation at Val269/Val182, 5′-AGACCCCAGTTGTCTAGGACAGCACCATC-3′; at Gly290/Gly203, 5′-GGGGCCTCCAACCCCTAGATGGAGGATATTCTT-3′; at Pro318/Pro2315′-GATTCCCGTACCCTAGGGGACAGAGCTTTC-3′; at Gly329/Gly242, 5′-CTCCAGGCCAGGATAGGGCAGCATGCAGAC-3′, and at Ser341/Ser254, 5′-CCCGCCAGACCCAGCTAATTCCTCTCAGCATC-3′. For investigating the glycosaminoglycan chain of an isolated CSF-1L241-S353 fragment, the corresponding cDNA sequence was fused to the prepro-cDNA sequence of DCN to attach a proper secretory signal. First, the prepro sequence of DCN was amplified with the primer pair 5′-ATGAAGGCCACTATCATCCTCC-3′ and 5′-TTCTAGCATAAAGTCAAATAAGCCTCT-3′. For amplifying the CSF-1 moiety, the forward primer composed at its 5′-end 28 nucleotides of the 3′ sequence of the DCN prepro sequence: 5′-GAGAGGCTTATTTGACTTTATGCTAGAACTGCACACAGTGGATCCAG-3′. The second primer was 5′-TGATGCAGGGAGTGGAGAA-3′. Both amplicons served as template in a subsequent PCR reaction in which the primers were the forward primer for the amplification of prepro-DCN, and the reverse and complement primer was the one used for CSF-1 amplification. Upon purification by agarose gel electrophoresis, the PCR product was ligated into pGemT and subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen).

Cultured human 293 embryonic kidney cells, maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics, were transfected by using Lipofectin or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The cells were selected for neomycin resistance by adding 750 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and maintained in culture without further subcloning. The expression of human DCN cDNA in 293 cells has been described (29Kresse H. Liszio C. Schönherr E. Fisher L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18404-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Subconfluent 293 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate by incubation for 48 h as described previously (29Kresse H. Liszio C. Schönherr E. Fisher L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18404-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Secreted macromolecules were concentrated from the medium by ammonium sulfate precipitation (70% saturation). The precipitate obtained after ultracentrifugation was dissolved in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl and protease inhibitors and recentrifuged. Proteoglycans were isolated from the supernatant first by chromatography on DEAE-Trisacryl and then by high performance ion exchange chromatography on a BioGel SEC DEAE-5-PV column (Bio-Rad) with a discontinuous NaCl gradient exactly as described (30Glössl J. Beck M. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14144-14150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For controls, aliquots of the preparations were subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal rabbit antisera against human DCN (30Glössl J. Beck M. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14144-14150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or CSF-1 (24Schwarz K. Breuer B. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22023-22028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as appropriate. In all cases, complete immunoprecipitation of35S-labeled proteoglycans could be achieved, thereby verifying the absence of other proteoglycan species. However, some constructs were substituted with heparan sulfate instead of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains (up to 15% of 35S radioactivity). This is analogous to the observation that biglycan can also carry a heparan sulfate chain when expressed in 293 cells (31Kresse H. Seidler D.G. Müller M. Breuer E. Hausser H. Roughley P.J. Schönherr E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13411-13416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Additionally, not all potential glycosaminoglycan chain attachment sites were completely used. Therefore, chimeric proteins with two such sites were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% total acrylamide in the separation gel), and a separate lane was used to identify by fluorography proteoglycan isoforms with either two or only one glycosaminoglycan chain. Areas containing the two chain forms were cut out, mixed with 3 volumes of water, and thoroughly homogenized by pressing the gel several times through two syringes interconnected with a small Teflon tubing. The gel suspension was stirred for 12 h at 4 °C before the extract was rechromatographed on DEAE-Trisacryl M (Serva) to recover the proteoglycans as described (30Glössl J. Beck M. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14144-14150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The principle for the separation of DCN- and CSF-1-attached glycosaminoglycan chains was to block all free amino groups and then to digest the proteoglycan proteolytically and to biotinylate the newly formed amino groups. A protease was chosen that could not act N-terminally to the DCN-specific attachment site. After protease cleavage, therefore, only chains on the CSF-1 site will have newly exposed N termini available for biotinylation. After biotinylation, the two glycosaminoglycan chains were separated by affinity chromatography on avidin-Sepharose. In detail, the extracted proteoglycan was made 0.1% with SDS, dialyzed against water, and concentrated 10-fold under reduced pressure. A 100-μl sample of each was mixed with 100 μl of N-ethylmorpholine and 150 μl of freshly prepared dansyl chloride (25 mg/mlN,N-dimethylformamide). The sample was mixed end over end for 3 h at room temperature before the proteoglycan was precipitated with 1 ml of acetone. Upon centrifugation, the pellet was washed with 80% acetone and dried in air. Subsequently, the sample was redissolved in SDS sample buffer and subjected to gel electrophoresis, gel extraction, and DEAE-chromatography as described above. Appropriate aliquots were exhaustively digested with 1000 units of trypsin, and the radioactive degradation products were rechromatographed on DEAE-Trisacryl M. Glycosaminoglycan-containing peptides (50 μl) were mixed with 420 μl of H2O, 60 μl of 10-fold concentrated PBS, and 70 μl ofN-hydroxysuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)-6-hexane amidohexanoate (8 mg/ml N,N-dimethylformamide) and allowed to react for 16 h at 0 °C. The excess of reagents was removed by anion exchange chromatography. Appropriate fractions were then treated with 50 μl of streptavidin agarose (Sigma) and allowed to react for 3 h at 4 °C. The gel was then transferred into a Pasteur pipette and extensively washed with 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate to yield the unbound fraction. Bound (from the CSF-1 site) and unbound (from the DCN site) glycosaminoglycans were subsequently released by a β-elimination reaction using 0.1 m NaOH, 1 mNaBH4 for 48 h at ambient temperature. [35S]Sulfate-labeled proteoglycans were treated in parallel for 2 h at 37 °C with chondroitin ABC lyase (EC 4.2.2.4) from Proteus vulgaris (50 milliunits/assay), chondroitin ACI lyase (from Flavobacterium heparinum) or chondroitin ACII lyase (from Arthrobacter ausrescens; for both enzymes, the EC number is 4.2.2.5) (50 milliunits/assay), chondroitin B lyase (unclassified), also from F. heparinum (20 milliunits/assay), and buffer alone, respectively, under the conditions described by the manufacturer (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan). The final volume was 50 μl. Chondroitin ABC lyase represents a mixture of an endolyase and an exolyase, effectively cleaving glycosidic linkages of N-acetylgalactosamine to either d-GlcUA or l-IdoUA (32Hamai A. Hashimoto N. Mochizuki H. Kato F. Makiguchi Y. Horie K. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9123-9130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Chondroitin ACI lyase is better suited than chondroitin ACII lyase to cleave glycosidic bonds of N-acetylgalactosamine to d-GlcUA due to its endolytic action (33Hiyama K. Okada S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1976; 80: 1201-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In a complementary manner to the chondroitin AC lyases, chondroitin B lyase eliminates selectively linkages between sulfated N-acetylated galactosamine andl-IdoUA (34Ototani N. Yosizawa Z. Carbohydrate Res. 1979; 70: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Completeness of enzyme action was ascertained by analyzing parallel incubations being performed where standard conditions were employed or where the degrading enzyme was added a second time after the first incubation step, and incubation continued for an additional 2-h period. At the end of the incubation, heparin was added as carrier (50 μg/assay), and the samples were subjected either to size fractionation or to ethanol precipitation as described below. Size fractionation of oligosaccharides was done on a Superdex Peptide HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated and eluted with 0.5m NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 150 μl were collected, and small aliquots were taken for liquid scintillation counting or hexuronic acid determination. The column was calibrated with a chondroitin sulfate disaccharide, a trisulfated heparan sulfate trisaccharide, and a heparan sulfate dodecasaccharide fraction as described (35Hausser H. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The total amount of disaccharides released by chondroitin ABC lyase was taken as 100% of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate disaccharide units. In chondroitin AC lyase digests, the percentage of chondroitin sulfate disaccharide units was obtained by adding all radioactivity in disaccharides, 50% of the radioactivity in tetrasaccharides, and 33% of that in hexasaccharides and comparing this quantity with the amount of chondroitin ABC lyase-generated disaccharides. Analogous calculations were made for the dermatan sulfate disaccharide units in the products of chondroitin B lyase digestions. During the course of the study, it became apparent that a much simpler method yielded the same results with a variation of less than ±5%. The lyase-digested proteoglycan solution was mixed with 4 volumes of ethanol and stored overnight at −20 °C. After thawing and centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g, an aliquot of the supernatant was carefully removed and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. After two washing steps with ethanol, the pellet was solubilized in 1 m NaOH, and its radioactivity was also determined. When the two fractions were separately subjected to high performance gel filtration as described above, the ethanol-soluble fraction contained at least 95% di- and tetrasaccharides, whereas the ethanol-insoluble material was composed of hexa- and higher saccharides. The radioactivities of the ethanol supernatant and of the pellet were related to each other without using corrective factors. Fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (36Calabro A. Benavides M. Tammi M. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) after chondroitin ABC, ACII, and B lyase digestion, respectively, was used to determine the ratio of 4- and 6-sulfatedN-acetylgalactosamine-containing disaccharides in the chondroitin sulfate- and dermatan sulfate-containing domains of the glycosaminoglycan chains of the various chimeric proteins. Undersulfated DCN was prepared from the conditioned medium of 293 cells expressing the chimeric DCN/CSF-1 proteoglycan as described (37Greve H. Cully Z. Blumberg P. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12886-12892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used as a substrate for 5-glucuronate epimerase. Confluent cells in a 75-cm2 flask were incubated for 48 h with 8 ml of Waymouth MAB 87/3 medium, as formulated in the catalogue of Gibco, which was modified as follows. FeSO4, CuSO4, MnSO4, and ZnSO4 were omitted; MgSO4 was replaced by MgCl2; the glucose concentration was reduced to 1 mm; and the concentrations of cysteine and methionine were reduced to 1% of the original concentration. The medium was supplemented with 10 mm NaClO3, [6-3H]glucosamine (15 μCi/ml), 4% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, transferrin (2 μg/ml), sodium selenite (30 nm), and penicillin. The medium was then digested with 300 units of hyaluronate lyase fromStreptomyces hyalurolyticus (Sigma) for 2 h at 37 °C and subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on 0.5 ml of DEAE-Trisacryl M (Serva) column as described except that the starting buffer contained only 50 mm NaCl. The column was washed with buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, and proteoglycans were desorbed from the resin with 1.0 ml of 300 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2. The source of 5-glucuronate epimerase was a freshly prepared suspension in 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.5, of the 10,000 ×g pellet obtained from the postnuclear supernatant of 293 cells as described (7Malmström A. Åberg L. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The crude enzyme preparation (3.5 mg) was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 200 μl containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.5, 10 mmMnCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm3′-phosphoadenylylphosphosulfate (Sigma) and 100,000 cpm of the [3H]glucosamine-labeled substrate (6Hannesson H.H. Hagner-McWhirter A. Tiedemann K. Lindahl U. Malmström A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The same amount of 3′-phosphoadenylylphosphosulfate was added twice during the course of the incubation. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS followed by fluorography was performed as previously described (30Glössl J. Beck M. Kresse H. J. Biol.

It is unclear whether RyR isoforms are capable of forming heteromeric channels. To investigate their ability to form heteromeric channels, we co-expressed different RyR isoforms in HEK293 cells and examined their interactions biochemically and functionally. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that RyR2 is able to interact physically with RyR3 and RyR1 in HEK293 cells and that RyR1 does not interact with RyR3. Co-expression of a ryanodine binding deficient mutant of RyR2, RyR2 (I4827T), with RyR3 (wt) restored [3H]ryanodine binding to the mutant. Interactions between RyR isoforms were further assessed by complementation analysis using mutants RyR2 (I4827T), RyR2 (E3987A), RyR3 (I4732T), RyR3 (E3885A), and RyR1 (E4032A), all of which are deficient in caffeine response. Caffeine-induced Ca2+release was restored in HEK293 cells co-transfected with mutants RyR2 (I4827T) and RyR3 (E3885A), RyR2 (E3987A) and RyR3 (I4732T), or RyR2 (I4827T) and RyR1 (E4032A), but not with RyR1 (E4032A) and RyR3 (I4732T), indicating that mutants of RyR2 and RyR3, or RyR2 and RyR1, but not RyR1 and RyR3, are able to complement each other. Co-expression of RyR3 (wt) and a pore mutant of RyR2, RyR2 (G4824A), produced regulatable single channels with intermediate unitary conductances. These observations demonstrate that RyR2 is capable of forming functional heteromeric channels with RyR3 and RyR1, whereas RyR1 is incapable of forming heteromeric channels with RyR3.

These observations demonstrate that RyR2 is capable of forming functional heteromeric channels with RyR3 and RyR1, whereas RyR1 is incapable of forming heteromeric channels with RyR3. ryanodine receptor inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate phosphate-buffered saline wild type Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release picosiemens Ryanodine receptors (RyRs)1 belong to a superfamily of Ca2+ release channels, which also includes the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs). These channels are located in the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum of muscle or non-muscle cells and play an essential role in muscle contraction and Ca2+ signaling (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4451) Google Scholar). Three RyR isoforms, RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3, have been identified and characterized in mammalian tissues. They are the products of three distinct genes and share 66–70% amino acid sequence identity. Each RyR isoform exhibits a unique tissue distribution. RyR1 is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle, whereas RyR2 is predominantly expressed in heart and brain. RyR3 expression has been detected, although at a relatively low level, in a variety of tissues, including brain, diaphragm, and smooth muscles (2Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 3Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 4Ogawa Y. Kurebayashi N. Murayama T. Adv. Biophys. 1999; 36: 27-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, recent studies using RNase protection assays revealed that all three RyR genes are widely expressed and that some tissues express two or all three RyR isoforms (5Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). For instance, both RyR1 and RyR3 are expressed in the diaphragm, whereas all three RyR isoforms are detected in brain and smooth muscle tissues. The finding that multiple RyR isoforms are co-expressed in the same tissue raises a possibility that RyRs may exist as heteromeric channels in addition to homomeric channels. Early biochemical studies showed that the purified RyR1 from rabbit skeletal muscle is a homotetramer composed of four identical subunits each with a molecular mass of ∼400 kDa (6Lai F.A. Misra M., Xu, L. Smith H.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16776-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, RyR3 was purified from diaphragm skeletal muscle in which RyR1 was also expressed by immunoprecipitation using an RyR3-specific antibody. The purified RyR3 was shown to be devoid of RyR1 even though RyR1 is co-expressed with RyR3 in the same muscle fibers and in large excess (7Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24030-24037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 8Jeyakumar L.H. Copello J.A. O'Malley A.M., Wu, G.M. Grassucci R. Wagenknecht T. Fleischer S. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that RyR1 and RyR3, although co-localized, exist only in the form of homotetramers. The same has been shown to be true for the α- and β-RyRs, the non-mammalian counterparts of RyR1 and RyR3 (3Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 10Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of RyR3 from brain tissue using an RyR3-specific antibody did not co-precipitate RyR2 (the major RyR isoform expressed in the brain), demonstrating that RyR2 and RyR3 also exist as homotetramers in the brain (11Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the general belief that RyRs may exist only in the form of homotetramers in contrast to IP3Rs. Immunoprecipitation studies have shown that the type 1, 2, and 3 IP3R isoforms can form heteromeric channels among one another (12Monkawa T. Miyawaki A. Sugiyama T. Yoneshima H. Yamamoto-Hino M. Furuichi T. Saruta T. Hasegawa M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14700-14704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 13Wojcikiewicz R.J. He Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It is clear that RyR1 and RyR3 expressed in mammalian skeletal muscle or α-RyR and β-RyR expressed in non-mammalian skeletal muscle are incapable of forming heteromeric channels. The question of whether RyR2 and RyR3, or RyR2 and RyR1, are capable of forming heteromeric channel is, however, debatable, because it is unknown whether RyR2 and RyR3, or RyR2 and RyR1, expressed in the brain are co-localized in the same cells. All three RyR isoforms have also been detected in smooth muscle cells. Functional studies have shown that specific inhibition of either RyR1 or RyR2 synthesis abolished Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release triggered by depolarization and that abolition of RyR3 by gene knock-out enhances the activity of other RyR isoforms in vascular smooth muscle cells (14Coussin F. Macrez N. Morel J.L. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9596-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 15Lohn M. Jessner W. Furstenau M. Wellner M. Sorrentino V. Haller H. Luft F.C. Gollasch M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for these observations is that RyR isoforms form heteromeric channels in these cells. To test this possibility, we co-expressed different RyR isoforms in HEK293 cells and examined the existence of heteromeric RyR channels. To do so, we utilized c-Myc antibody epitope-tagged RyR2 or RyR3 and RyR mutants that are deficient in [3H]ryanodine binding or caffeine response, or have different single-channel conductances to distinguish the RyR isoforms structurally and functionally. These RyR isoforms, tagged or non-tagged, wt or mutants, were co-expressed in HEK293 cells, and the formation of heteromeric RyR channels was examined by immunoprecipitation, [3H]ryanodine binding, and single-channel recordings in planar lipid bilayers. Our results reveal for the first time that RyR2 are capable of forming functional heteromeric channels with RyR3 or RyR1 in HEK293 cells. [3H]Ryanodine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and ryanodine was obtained from Calbiochem. Anti-RyR antibody (anti-RyR (34C)) was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents Inc. Brain phosphatidylserine and soybean phosphatidylcholine were from Avanti Polar Lipids. Synthetic 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoethanolamine was obtained from Northern Lipids. 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPS) and other reagents were purchased from Sigma. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described previously (16Chen S.R.W., Li, X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol.

HEK293 cells grown on 100-mm tissue culture dishes for 18–20 h after subculture were transfected with 12–16 μg of wild type or mutant RyR cDNAs using Ca2+ phosphate precipitation (17Sambrook J.

The RyR2 (I4827T) and RyR3 (I4732T) mutations were generated by the overlap extension method using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (22Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). The NruI (14237)-NotI (vector) fragment that contains the RyR2 (I4827T) mutation was used to replace the corresponding wild type fragment in the full-length mouse RyR2 cDNA. The EcoRI (13422)-NotI (vector) fragment that contains the RyR3 (I4732A) mutation was used to replace the corresponding wild type fragment in the RyR3 cDNA without the RcoRI (11902)-EcoRI (13422) fragment, which was subsequently ligated back to form the full-length RyR3 (I4732A). Insertion of the c-Myc antibody epitope tag, EQKLISEEDL, in RyR3 after glutamate 4318, has been described previously (23Liu Z. Zhang J. Sharma M.R., Li, P. Chen S.R. Wagenknecht T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

TheBsu36I (13237)-EcoRV (13873) RyR2 cDNA fragment that contains the c-Myc tag was removed from the PCR product generated by the overlap extension method, and was used to replace the corresponding region in the BsiwI (8864)-NotI (vector) fragment, which was subsequently subcloned into the full-length RyR2 cDNA. All point mutations and insertions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Preparation of cell lysate from transfected HEK293 cells was performed as described previously (19Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), with some modifications. HEK293 cells grown for 24 h after transfection were washed three times with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl) plus 2.5 mm EDTA and were harvested in the same solution by centrifugation. Transfected HEK293 cells were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris/50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, 0.5% soybean phosphatidylcholine, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mix (1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 1 h. Cell lysate was obtained after removing the unsolubilized materials by centrifugation twice in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C each for 30 min. Cell lysates were incubated with protein G- or protein A-Sepharose (30 μl) that was pre-washed with PBS and pre-bound with 5–10 μg of anti-c-Myc, anti-RyR1 (13C2) (24Chen S.R. Airey J.A. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22642-22649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), anti-RyR2, or anti-RyR3 antibodies at 4 °C for 17–19 h. The anti-RyR2 antibody was produced in rabbits against a synthetic peptide, QKLRQLHTHRYGE, which corresponds to residues 4460–4472 of rabbit RyR2. Generation of the anti-RyR3 antibody was described previously (11Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The protein G- or protein A-agarose beads were washed with ice-cold lysis buffer three times, each time for 10 min. The immunocomplexes bound to the agarose beads were solubilized by addition of 30 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) plus 5% β-mercaptoethanol and were boiled at 100 °C for 2 min. The solubilized immunocomplexes (10–15 μl) were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE. The SDS-PAGE-resolved proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 45 mV for 18–20 h at 4 °C in the presence of 0.01% SDS according to Towbin et al. (26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked for 0.5 h with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk powder. The blocked membrane was incubated with primary antibodies, anti-RyR (34C), anti-RyR2, anti-RyR3, or anti-RyR3 (FP8) (16Chen S.R.W., Li, X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) for 2–4 h, washed three times each time for 15 min with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20. The membrane was then incubated with the secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (H&L) antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase for 30–40 min. After washing three times each time for 15 min, the bound antibodies were visualized by the alkaline phosphatase-mediated color reaction using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as the substrates. The c-Myc-tagged RyR proteins expressed in HEK293 cells were immunoprecipitated by protein G-agarose that was pre-bound with anti-c-Myc antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer. Equilibrium [3H]ryanodine binding was carried out in a binding mixture (300 μl) containing 15 μl of immunoprecipitates (agarose beads), 25 mm Tris/50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 500 mm KCl, 0.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm caffeine, 5 nm [3H]ryanodine, and the protease inhibitor mix was incubated at 37 °C for 2–3 h. The binding mix was filtered through Whatman GF/B filters presoaked with 1% polyethyleneimine. The filters were immediately washed four times with 5 ml of ice-cold washing buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 250 mm KCl. The radioactivity associated with the filters was then determined by liquid scintillation counting, while nonspecific binding was determined by measuring [3H]ryanodine binding in the presence of 50 μm unlabeled ryanodine. All binding assays were done in duplicate. Free cytosolic Ca2+concentration in transfected HEK293 cells was measured with the fluorescence Ca2+ indicator dye fluo-3-AM as described previously (19Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Recombinant RyR proteins were purified from whole cell lysate by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and were used for single-channel recordings as described previously (19Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using the computer program of Fabiato and Fabiato (27Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). To test the possibility that RyR2 is capable of forming heteromeric channels with RyR3, we first investigated whether RyR2 interacts with RyR3 physically. RyR2 and RyR3 have a comparable molecular weight and migrate similarly in SDS-PAGE. To facilitate specific detection and isolation of RyR2 and RyR3, we inserted a c-Myc tag into RyR2 and RyR3. The c-Myc-tagged RyR2, RyR2 (c-Myc), or c-Myc-tagged RyR3, RyR3 (c-Myc), was expressed in HEK293 cells either alone or in combination with the untagged RyR3 (wt) or untagged RyR2 (wt), respectively. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using the anti-c-Myc antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were separated and probed with either the anti-RyR (34C) antibody, which recognizes all three RyR isoforms, or an RyR3-specific antibody, anti-RyR3 (FP8). Fig.1 shows that the anti-c-Myc antibody was able to pull down the RyR2 (c-Myc) protein from a lysate of HEK293 cells transfected with RyR2 (c-Myc) (Fig. 1 A, lane 1), but not RyR3 (wt) protein from cells transfected with RyR3 (wt) (Fig. 1 A, lane 2), indicating that the anti-c-Myc antibody is specific. The anti-c-Myc antibody also pulled down a major band, which should contain the RyR2 (c-Myc) protein, from HEK293 cells co-transfected with RyR2 (c-Myc) and RyR3 (wt) (Fig.1 A, lane 3). The same anti-c-Myc immunoprecipitates were blotted with the anti-RyR3 (FP8) antibody (Fig.1 B). This antibody recognized a major band in the anti-c-Myc immunoprecipitate from HEK293 cells co-transfected with RyR2 (c-Myc) and RyR3 (wt) (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). No significant signal was detected by the anti-RyR3 (FP8) antibody in the immunoprecipitate from cells transfected with RyR2 (c-Myc) alone (Fig.1 B, lane 1). These data indicate that the anti-RyR3 (FP8) antibody is specific and that RyR3 (wt) was co-precipitated with RyR2 (c-Myc) by the anti-c-Myc antibody. It should be noted that caffeine and ryanodine induced Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores in HEK293 cells transfected with RyR2 (c-Myc) or RyR3 (c-Myc), indicating that both RyR2 (c-Myc) and RyR3 (c-Myc) are functional (Fig. 1, E andF). We also performed the reciprocal experiment in which the RyR3 (c-Myc) was immunoprecipitated by the anti-c-Myc antibody and the presence of RyR2 (wt) in the anti-c-Myc immunoprecipitates was detected by Western blotting using an RyR2-specific antibody. As shown in Fig.1 C, the anti-c-Myc antibody pulled down the RyR3 (c-Myc) (lanes 1 and 3) but not the RyR2 (wt) (lane 2). The anti-RyR2 antibody did not cross-react with the RyR3 (c-Myc) (Fig. 1 D, lane 1) but recognized a major band in the anti-c-Myc immunoprecipitate from HEK293 cells co-transfected with RyR2 (wt) and RyR3 (c-Myc). Several minor bands were also detected by the anti-RyR (34C) antibody in the anti-c-Myc immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 B, lane 3; Fig.1 C, lanes 1 and 3). They are most likely degradation or aggregation products of RyR3, because RyR2 (c-Myc) or RyR2 (wt) show a single band (Fig. 1 A, lane 1; Fig. 1 D, lane 3). Thus, although the anti-c-Myc antibody is unable to pull down RyR2 (wt), it is able to precipitate the RyR2 (wt) in the presence of RyR3 (c-Myc). Taken together, these results demonstrate that RyR2 and RyR3 interact physically with each other. [3H]ryanodine binding has been widely used as a functional assay for RyR channel activity, because ryanodine binds to the open state of the channel (28Tanna B. Welch W. Ruest L. Sutko J.L. Williams A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the RyR2·RyR3 complex observed in HEK293 cells is functional, we isolated the complex and determined its [3H]ryanodine binding capability. To specifically measure [3H]ryanodine binding to the RyR2·RyR3 complexes, but not to individual RyR2 or RyR3, we utilized a c-Myc-tagged RyR2 mutant, RyR2 (I4827T, c-Myc), that is equivalent to the central core disease mutation I4898T in RyR1 (29Lynch P.J. Tong J. Lehane M. Mallet A. Giblin L. Heffron J.J. Vaughan P. Zafra G. MacLennan D.H. McCarthy T.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4164-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It has been shown that mutant RyR1 (I4898T) does not bind [3H]ryanodine when expressed alone but displays significant [3H]ryanodine binding after co-expressed with wt RyR1 (29Lynch P.J. Tong J. Lehane M. Mallet A. Giblin L. Heffron J.J. Vaughan P. Zafra G. MacLennan D.H. McCarthy T.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4164-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), most likely as a result of formation of mutant RyR1 (I4898T)·wt RyR1 complexes. Similarly, we found that the RyR2 (I4827T, c-Myc) mutant isolated by anti-c-Myc immunoprecipitation showed no significant [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig.2 B), while [3H]ryanodine binding was readily detected in anti-c-Myc immunoprecipitates from HEK293 cells co-transfected with RyR2 (wt) and RyR2 (I4827T, c-Myc) (Fig. 2 B). It should be noted that mutant RyR2 (I4827T, c-Myc) is expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig.2 A) and that the lack of [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR2 (I4827T, c-Myc) is unlikely due to the lack of expression of the mutant. It should also be noted that the anti-c-Myc antibody does not precipitate [3H]ryanodine binding activity from HEK293 cells transfected with RyR2 (wt) alone (data not shown). We reasoned that, if RyR2 is capable of interacting with RyR3, co-expression of RyR3 (wt) with RyR2 (I4827T, c-Myc) should also be able to restore some [3H]ryanodine binding to the mutant. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the anti-c-Myc antibody was able to precipitate [3H]ryanodine binding activity from HEK293 cells co-transfected with RyR3 (wt) and RyR2 (I4827T, c-Myc). Because the anti-c-Myc antibody does not precipitate [3H]ryanodine binding activity from cells transfected with RyR3 (wt) alone (data not shown), the [3H]ryanodine binding detected in the immunoprecipitates must result from binding to the RyR3 (wt)·RyR2 (I4827T, c-Myc) complexes. These observations indicate that RyR2 and RyR3 can form a functional complex. The observed physical and functional RyR2-RyR3 interaction could occur between homomeric RyR2 and homomeric RyR3 channels or via the formation of heteromeric RyR2·RyR3 hybrid channels. To distinguish these possibilities, we made use of the RyR2 (I4827T) mutant and a Ca2+ sensing mutant of RyR3, RyR3 (E3885A) (20Chen S.R. Ebisawa K., Li, X. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14675-14678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Neither mutant when expressed alone in HEK293 cells exhibited caffeine-induced Ca2+ release (Fig.3, A and B). If RyR2-RyR3 interaction occurs only between homomeric RyR2 and homomeric RyR3 channels, the RyR2 (I4827T)·RyR3 (E3885A) mutant complex formed after co-expression in HEK293 cells should remain insensitive to caffeine. On the other hand, if RyR2-RyR3 interaction occurs between monomeric RyR2 and monomeric RyR3, co-expression of RyR2 (I4827T) and RyR3 (E3885A) in HEK293 cells may produce hybrid channels that are caffeine-sensitive, because these two mutations are located in different regions of RyR and one mutant may be able to complement the defect of the other. As shown in Fig. 3, HEK293 cells co-transfected with different ratios of RyR2 (I4827T) and RyR3 (E3885A) displayed caffeine-induced Ca2+ release (Fig. 3, C–E), indicating the formation of heteromeric RyR2·RyR3 hybrid channels. The immediate drops in fluorescence signals after addition of caffeine are due to fluorescence quenching by caffeine. To demonstrate the formation of RyR2·RyR3 heteromeric channels at the single-channel level, we utilized a pore mutant of RyR2, RyR2 (G4824A). We have shown that mutation RyR2 (G4824A) reduces the single-channel conductance by ∼97% and that co-expression of RyR2 (wt) and RyR2 (G4824A) mutant produces wt/mutant hybrid channels with intermediate single-channel conductances (21Zhao M., Li, P., Li, X. Zhang L. Winkfein R.J. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25971-25974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). If RyR2 is able to form single heteromeric channels with RyR3, one would expect that co-expression of RyR2 (G4824A) and RyR3 (wt) would also result in the synthesis of single hybrid channels with intermediate single-channel conductances. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the single-channel conductances of the co-expressed channels after incorporation into planar lipid bilayers. A total of 42 single channels were detected. Based on their single-channel conductances, they can be separated into six groups (Fig. 4), displaying single-channel conductances of 799 ± 1.9 picosiemens (pS) (n = 7), 524 ± 5.1 pS (n = 9), 267 ± 6.8 pS (n = 11), 178 ± 4.7 pS (n = 6), 77 ± 1.7 pS (n = 8), and 22 pS (n = 1), similar to those observed after co-expression of RyR2 (wt) and RyR2 (G4824A) (21Zhao M., Li, P., Li, X. Zhang L. Winkfein R.J. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25971-25974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The 799-pS (Fig. 4A) and the 22-pS (Fig. 4F) single channels most likely represent the homotetrameric RyR3 (wt) and the homotetrameric RyR2 (G4824A) mutant channels, respectively, whereas single channels with intermediate single-channel conductances most probably represent the RyR3 (wt)/RyR2 (G4824A) hybrid channels with different subunit ratios of RyR3 (wt) to RyR2 (G4824A). For instance, the 524-pS conductance may result from hybrid channels formed by three RyR3 (wt) and one RyR2 (G4824A) subunits (Fig. 4 B), whereas hybrid channels with one RyR3 (wt) and three RyR2 (G4824A) subunits may produce the 77-pS conductance (Fig. 4 E). The 267-pS (Fig.4 C) and 178-pS (Fig. 4 D) channels may be formed by two RyR3 (wt) and two RyR2 (G4824A) subunits arranged in two possible configurations (parallel and diagonal). These results clearly demonstrate that RyR2 and RyR3 are capable of forming single heteromeric channels. To assess whether RyR2·RyR3 heteromeric channels are regulatable, we examined the effect of Ca2+, ATP, caffeine, Mg2+, and ryanodine on single RyR3 (wt)/RyR2 (G4824A) hybrid channels with intermediate single-channel conductances. Fig.5 a shows the channel activity of a single RyR3 (wt)/RyR2 (G4824A) heteromeric channel with a unitary conductance of 269-pS (probably comprised of two RyR3 (wt) and two RyR2 (G4824A) subunits). The heteromeric channel was sensitive to Ca2+ (Fig. 5, b, c, andg), activated by ATP (Fig. 5 d) and caffeine (Fig.5 e), inhibited by Mg2+ (Fig. 5 f), and modulated by ryanodine (Fig. 5 h). Similar ligand responses were also observed in other single-hybrid channels with different unitary conductances (not shown). Hence RyR2 and RyR3 are able to form functional and regulatable single heteromeric channels in HEK293 cells. The finding that RyR2 interacts physically with RyR3 raises the question of whether RyR2 is also able to interact with RyR1. To address this question, we co-expressed RyR2 (c-Myc) and RyR1 in HEK293 cells and examined possible interactions between them by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Because RyR2 migrates faster than RyR1 in SDS-PAGE, RyR1-RyR2 interaction could be readily detected by immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 6 Ashows that the anti-c-Myc antibody did not pull down the RyR1 protein from HEK293 cells transfected with RyR1 alone (Fig. 6 A,lane 2), but an anti-RyR1 (13C2) antibody did (Fig.6 A, lane 1). The anti-c-Myc antibody also did not cross-react with RyR1 on Western blot (Fig. 6 A, lane 3). On the other hand, the anti-c-Myc antibody precipitated two RyR bands from HEK293 cells co-transfected with RyR2 (c-Myc) and RyR1 (Fig. 6 B, lane 2). The bottom band (indicated by an arrowhead), which was recognized by both the anti-RyR (34C) and the anti-c-Myc antibodies, corresponds to RyR2 (c-Myc), whereas the top band (indicated by an arrow), which was recognized by the anti-RyR (34C) antibody but not by the anti-c-Myc antibody, corresponds to RyR1 (Fig. 6 B, lanes 2and 4). These data indicate that RyR1 was co-precipitated with RyR2 (c-Myc) by the anti-c-Myc antibody. It should be noted that the anti-RyR1 (13C2) antibody, although raised against RyR1-specific sequence, exhibits some cross-reactivity with the RyR2 and RyR3 isoforms in both immunoprecipitation"

TLK19780, a non-peptide small molecule, is a new member of a novel class of anti-diabetic agents that function as activators of the insulin receptor (IR) β-subunit tyrosine kinase. In HTC-IR cells, 20 μm TLK19780 enhanced maximal insulin-stimulated IR autophosphorylation 2-fold and increased insulin sensitivity 2–3-fold. In contrast, TLK19780 did not potentiate the action of insulin-like growth factor-1, indicating the selectivity of TLK19780 toward the IR. The predominant effect of TLK19780 was to increase the number of IR that underwent autophosphorylation. Kinetic studies indicated that TLK19780 acted very rapidly, with a maximal effect observed 2 min after addition to insulin-stimulated cells. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, 5 μm TLK19780 enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose transport, increasing both the sensitivity and maximal responsiveness to insulin. These studies indicate that at low micromolar levels small IR activator molecules can enhance insulin action in various cultured cells and suggest that this effect is mediated by increasing the number of IR that are tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin.

When insulin binds to the α-subunit of the receptor, the β-subunit tyrosine kinase is activated, resulting in autophosphorylation of β-subunit tyrosine residues (3Kahn C.R.

After autophosphorylation, the activated receptor phosphorylates endogenous substrates, such as the insulin receptor substrates, IRS-1 and IRS-2 (4White M.F. Recent Prog. Horm.

We have determined that they act to increase the number of IR that are tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have observed that TLK19780, at nanomolar concentrations, acts directly on the cytoplasmic kinase domain of the IR, resulting in increased tyrosine kinase activity. This observation suggests that the IR β-subunit is the site of action of TLK19780. Additional studies in intact cells indicate that this compound increases the number of IRs that are activated by insulin.When employing insulin-sensitive cells, we observed that micromolar concentrations of TLK19780 plus insulin activated the IR to a greater degree compared with insulin alone. The original compound in this series, TLK16998, was a larger, more acidic molecule with a molecular mass of ∼1240 Da (13Manchem V.P. Goldfine I.D. Kohanski R.A. Cristobal C.P. Lum R.T. Schow S.R.

Accordingly, smaller and more active molecules were synthesized and tested for activity in an in vitro(biochemical) IR tyrosine kinase assay (13Manchem V.P. Goldfine I.D. Kohanski R.A. Cristobal C.P. Lum R.T. Schow S.R. Shi S. Spevak W.R. Laborde E. Toavs D.K. Villar H.O. Wick M.M. Kozlowski M.R. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 824-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Manchem V.P. Rao S.S.

Because TLK19780 was more potent than TLK16998 in vitro (13Manchem V.P. Goldfine I.D. Kohanski R.A. Cristobal C.P. Lum R.T. Schow S.R. Shi S. Spevak W.R. Laborde E. Toavs D.K. Villar H.O. Wick M.M. Kozlowski M.R. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 824-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it was tested here in cellular models. In the present study with HTC-IR cells, we found that TLK19780, at 20 μm (a concentration that had no IR agonist activity), increased maximal insulin-stimulated IR autophosphorylation by more than 2-fold. In contrast, at this same concentration, TLK16998 only increased insulin-stimulated IR autophosphorylation by ∼40% (13Manchem V.P. Goldfine I.D. Kohanski R.A. Cristobal C.P. Lum R.T. Schow S.R. Shi S. Spevak W.R. Laborde E. Toavs D.K. Villar H.O. Wick M.M. Kozlowski M.R. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 824-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Also, in 3T3-L1 cells, TLK19780 was more effective than TLK16998. As with TLK16998, TLK19780 had little or no effect on the related IGF-1 receptor. This observation demonstrates that reducing the size of the molecule can increase the potency of the molecule without a resulting in a loss of specificity toward the IR.The present studies employed HTC-IR cells, which are rat hepatoma cells transfected with and overexpressing modest amounts of human IR (14Sbraccia P.

These cells have been used previously to probe insulin action and insulin signaling, and to study IR activators (14Sbraccia P. Wong K.Y. Brunetti A. Rafaeloff R. Trischitta V. Hawley D.M.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2649-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the present study, we employed these cells for several reasons. First, IR autophosphorylation can readily be measured in these cells. Second, incubation conditions can be manipulated and kinetic analyses performed. Third, comparisons can be made with prior studies of IR activators.It is important to note that not only did TLK19780 potentiate IR autophosphorylation in HTC-IR cells but, in addition, similarly enhanced the effect of insulin on glucose transport in a classic insulin-sensitive cell, 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Although these cells are not as sensitive to insulin as isolated fat cells, they are very useful for the types of studies carried out here. The experiments with 3T3 L1 adipocytes indicated that the effect of TLK19780 was not cell line-specific and that the effect of TLK19780 to activate the IR was translated into enhanced insulin-mediated glucose transport. Other studies indicated that the effect of the compound did not potentiate IGF-I R action.The increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IR observed following treatment of HTC-IR cells with TLK19780 plus insulin could be due to either an increase in the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation per receptor or the number of IR that were tyrosine-phosphorylated. Two types of experiments were carried out to address this important question. First, cells were stimulated with insulin in the presence or absence of TLK19780, immunoabsorbed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and Western-blotted with anti-IR antibody. The results of these studies indicated that more IR contained phosphotyrosine when incubated with TLK19780 plus insulin than with insulin alone. In addition, studies were carried out with site-specific anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies that react only with IR phosphorylated on key tyrosine residues 1162/1163 and 1158. Prior investigations have indicated that phosphorylation of these tyrosine residues is necessary for IR activation (2Goldfine I.D. Endocr. Rev. 1987; 8: 235-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 3Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1066-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Unlike the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody there is only one antigenic site for these site-specific antibodies per β-subunit; therefore, the intensity of bands observed in immunoblots is directly related to the number of β-subunits phosphorylated at that particular site. The results of the present studies indicated that more IR were phosphorylated on these sites when incubated with TLK19780 plus insulin than with insulin alone. Therefore, these data indicate that a major mechanism by which TLK19780 enhances total IR autophosphorylation is by facilitating the tyrosine phosphorylation of additional IR.The time course of the effects of TLK19780 on the IR autophosphorylation was also investigated. Preincubation studies indicated that TLK19780 needed to be present for less than 5 min to exert its effect on subsequent stimulation of IR autophosphorylation by insulin. To understand more precisely the kinetics of TLK19780, the compound was added to the cell after insulin-stimulated IR autophosphorylation reached its maximal level. These experiments indicated that the compound could act after the addition of insulin, and reached a maximal effect at 2 min.The requirement for the continued presence TLK19780 to activate the IR after this compound had been added to cells was then studied. If TLK19780 was added to cells for 10 min, and removed prior to the addition of insulin, no effect was observed. This indicates that TLK19780 was needed during the phosphorylation process. However, when cells were stimulated with TLK19780 plus insulin and only the insulin removed, the presence of TLK19780 maintained a higher level of IR autophosphorylation than when insulin and the compound were both removed. These data indicate that TLK19780 can also modify the ability of the cell to “turn off” the insulin receptor signaling mechanism.For several reasons, we believe that the effects of TLK19780 are not due to inhibition of cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity. Experiments in a cell-free system using the purified IR cytoplasmic kinase domain (thus in absence of a tyrosine phosphatase) showed that TLK19780 enhanced tyrosine kinase activity. Thus TLK19780 can act directly on the IR. Additionally, for both insulin alone and insulin plus TLK19780, there was a rapid parallel increase in IR autophosphorylation followed by a parallel decrease in this function. If TLK19780 were acting solely by inhibiting tyrosine phosphatase activity, one would not expect the rapid increase in IR autophosphorylation that was observed. Rather, one would expect a time course exhibiting a much slower increase in autophosphorylation, followed by a slower rate of IR dephosphorylation. This latter type of time course was not observed however. Therefore, we believe that these data with TLK19780 are consistent with the notion that the compound acts both to expose the IR to autophosphorylation and to maintain IR phosphorylation.The effect of TLK19780 was highly specific for the IR, because it did not potentiate the effects of the closely related IGF-I receptor on glucose transport. This finding is in agreement with findings using the first generation compound, TLK16998, which also was highly specific for the IR (13Manchem V.P. Goldfine I.D. Kohanski R.A. Cristobal C.P. Lum R.T. Schow S.R. Shi S. Spevak W.R. Laborde E. Toavs D.K. Villar H.O. Wick M.M. Kozlowski M.R. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 824-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), suggesting that these compounds are not acting as phosphatase inhibitors. Because the β-subunits of each receptor are similar, it is likely that the conformational change in the IR β-subunit induced by insulin binding, as described by Ottensmeyer and co-workers (22Luo R.Z. Beniac D.R. Fernandes A. Yip C.C. Ottensmeyer F.P. Science. 1999; 285: 1077-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), is sufficiently different from the analogous change in IGF-I receptor to enable the IR to be a specific target of this class of IR activators.At low concentrations, TLK19780 did not directly activate the IR but rather potentiated the effect of insulin. However, at higher concentrations, there was a direct effect of this compound both on IR autophosphorylation and glucose transport.In summary, we report that a smaller IR activator molecule can be identified that has potent effects on the IR β-subunit at the level of IR activation. Because insulin resistance is a major feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus, it is likely that similar agents may eventually prove useful in the treatment of this disease. The cellular response to insulin is mediated through the insulin receptor (IR), 1The abbreviations used are: IR, insulin receptor; IR-CKD, IR-cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; IGF, insulin-like growth factor 1The abbreviations used are: IR, insulin receptor; IR-CKD, IR-cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; IGF, insulin-like growth factora tetrameric protein consisting of two identical extracellular α-subunits that bind insulin and two identical transmembrane β-subunits that have intracellular tyrosine kinase activity (1Moller D.E.

When insulin binds to the α-subunit of the receptor, the β-subunit tyrosine kinase is activated, resulting in autophosphorylation of β-subunit tyrosine residues (3Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1066-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). After autophosphorylation, the activated receptor phosphorylates endogenous substrates, such as the insulin receptor substrates, IRS-1 and IRS-2 (4White M.F. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 119-138PubMed Google Scholar, 5Virkamaki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated tyrosine residues on these substrates then bind to a variety of other substrates, and insulin action ensues (1Moller D.E. Flier J.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 938-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 2Goldfine I.D. Endocr. Rev. 1987; 8: 235-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 3Kahn C.R.

It is well established that insulin signaling, including activation of IR tyrosine kinase activity, is impaired in most patients with type 2 diabetes (7Thies R.S. Molina J.M. Ciaraldi T.P.

Pharmacological agents that enhance IR β-subunit tyrosine kinase activity could be useful in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (11Zhang B.B. Moller D.E. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Recently, we described a small non-peptide molecule, TLK16998, that interacts with the IR β-subunit and enhances insulin action in cultured cells (13Manchem V.P. Goldfine I.D. Kohanski R.A.

By employing HTC-IR cells (rat hepatoma cells transfected with and overexpressing modest amounts of human IR (14Sbraccia P. Wong K.Y. Brunetti A. Rafaeloff R. Trischitta V. Hawley D.M. Goldfine I.D.

Therefore, compounds of this class may be important as anti-diabetic agents. It would be important to understand the dynamics of how this class of molecules enhances the action of insulin on its receptor. Recently, second generation compounds of this class have been identified that are smaller, more potent, and orally available (16Manchem V.P. Rao S.S. Bajjalieh S. Spevak W.R. Shi S. Cristobal C.P.

In contrast, at this same concentration, TLK16998 only increased insulin-stimulated IR autophosphorylation by ∼40% (13Manchem V.P. Goldfine I.D. Kohanski R.A. Cristobal C.P. Lum R.T. Schow S.R.

Also, in 3T3-L1 cells, TLK19780 was more effective than TLK16998. As with TLK16998, TLK19780 had little or no effect on the related IGF-1 receptor. This observation demonstrates that reducing the size of the molecule can increase the potency of the molecule without a resulting in a loss of specificity toward the IR. The present studies employed HTC-IR cells, which are rat hepatoma cells transfected with and overexpressing modest amounts of human IR (14Sbraccia P. Wong K.Y. Brunetti A. Rafaeloff R. Trischitta V.

These cells have been used previously to probe insulin action and insulin signaling, and to study IR activators (14Sbraccia P. Wong K.Y. Brunetti A. Rafaeloff R. Trischitta V. Hawley D.M.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2649-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the present study, we employed these cells for several reasons. First, IR autophosphorylation can readily be measured in these cells. Second, incubation conditions can be manipulated and kinetic analyses performed. Third, comparisons can be made with prior studies of IR activators. It is important to note that not only did TLK19780 potentiate IR autophosphorylation in HTC-IR cells but, in addition, similarly enhanced the effect of insulin on glucose transport in a classic insulin-sensitive cell, 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Although these cells are not as sensitive to insulin as isolated fat cells, they are very useful for the types of studies carried out here. The experiments with 3T3 L1 adipocytes indicated that the effect of TLK19780 was not cell line-specific and that the effect of TLK19780 to activate the IR was translated into enhanced insulin-mediated glucose transport. Other studies indicated that the effect of the compound did not potentiate IGF-I R action. The increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IR observed following treatment of HTC-IR cells with TLK19780 plus insulin could be due to either an increase in the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation per receptor or the number of IR that were tyrosine-phosphorylated. Two types of experiments were carried out to address this important question. First, cells were stimulated with insulin in the presence or absence of TLK19780, immunoabsorbed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and Western-blotted with anti-IR antibody. The results of these studies indicated that more IR contained phosphotyrosine when incubated with TLK19780 plus insulin than with insulin alone. In addition, studies were carried out with site-specific anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies that react only with IR phosphorylated on key tyrosine residues 1162/1163 and 1158. Prior investigations have indicated that phosphorylation of these tyrosine residues is necessary for IR activation (2Goldfine I.D. Endocr. Rev. 1987; 8: 235-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 3Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1066-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Unlike the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody there is only one antigenic site for these site-specific antibodies per β-subunit; therefore, the intensity of bands observed in immunoblots is directly related to the number of β-subunits phosphorylated at that particular site. The results of the present studies indicated that more IR were phosphorylated on these sites when incubated with TLK19780 plus insulin than with insulin alone. Therefore, these data indicate that a major mechanism by which TLK19780 enhances total IR autophosphorylation is by facilitating the tyrosine phosphorylation of additional IR. The time course of the effects of TLK19780 on the IR autophosphorylation was also investigated. Preincubation studies indicated that TLK19780 needed to be present for less than 5 min to exert its effect on subsequent stimulation of IR autophosphorylation by insulin. To understand more precisely the kinetics of TLK19780, the compound was added to the cell after insulin-stimulated IR autophosphorylation reached its maximal level. These experiments indicated that the compound could act after the addition of insulin, and reached a maximal effect at 2 min. The requirement for the continued presence TLK19780 to activate the IR after this compound had been added to cells was then studied. If TLK19780 was added to cells for 10 min, and removed prior to the addition of insulin, no effect was observed. This indicates that TLK19780 was needed during the phosphorylation process. However, when cells were stimulated with TLK19780 plus insulin and only the insulin removed, the presence of TLK19780 maintained a higher level of IR autophosphorylation than when insulin and the compound were both removed. These data indicate that TLK19780 can also modify the ability of the cell to “turn off” the insulin receptor signaling mechanism. For several reasons, we believe that the effects of TLK19780 are not due to inhibition of cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity. Experiments in a cell-free system using the purified IR cytoplasmic kinase domain (thus in absence of a tyrosine phosphatase) showed that TLK19780 enhanced tyrosine kinase activity. Thus TLK19780 can act directly on the IR. Additionally, for both insulin alone and insulin plus TLK19780, there was a rapid parallel increase in IR autophosphorylation followed by a parallel decrease in this function. If TLK19780 were acting solely by inhibiting tyrosine phosphatase activity, one would not expect the rapid increase in IR autophosphorylation that was observed. Rather, one would expect a time course exhibiting a much slower increase in autophosphorylation, followed by a slower rate of IR dephosphorylation. This latter type of time course was not observed however. Therefore, we believe that these data with TLK19780 are consistent with the notion that the compound acts both to expose the IR to autophosphorylation and to maintain IR phosphorylation. The effect of TLK19780 was highly specific for the IR, because it did not potentiate the effects of the closely related IGF-I receptor on glucose transport. This finding is in agreement with findings using the first generation compound, TLK16998, which also was highly specific for the IR (13Manchem V.P. Goldfine I.D. Kohanski R.A. Cristobal C.P. Lum R.T. Schow S.R. Shi S. Spevak W.R. Laborde E. Toavs D.K. Villar H.O. Wick M.M. Kozlowski M.R. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 824-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), suggesting that these compounds are not acting as phosphatase inhibitors. Because the β-subunits of each receptor are similar, it is likely that the conformational change in the IR β-subunit induced by insulin binding, as described by Ottensmeyer and co-workers (22Luo R.Z. Beniac D.R. Fernandes A. Yip C.C. Ottensmeyer F.P. Science. 1999; 285: 1077-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), is sufficiently different from the analogous change in IGF-I receptor to enable the IR to be a specific target of this class of IR activators. At low concentrations, TLK19780 did not directly activate the IR but rather potentiated the effect of insulin. However, at higher concentrations, there was a direct effect of this compound both on IR autophosphorylation and glucose transport. In summary, we report that a smaller IR activator molecule can be identified that has potent effects on the IR β-subunit at the level of IR activation. Because insulin resistance is a major feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus, it is likely that similar agents may eventually prove useful in the treatment of this disease."

The maximal extent of this structural rearrangement is shown to be about 13 Å at the L4 loop and about 25° at the helix α3. Both the structural change and mutagenesis data suggest that Arg-65 and Glu-29 play an important role in the binding of the substrate. Interestingly, the AP3 binding mode turns out to be significantly different from that of the natural substrate, phospho-l-serine, and the HPSP·l-Ser·Pi structure provides a structural basis for the feedback control mechanism of serine.

In this paper, we present movement of the small helical domain in HPSP, and the complex structures provide a great deal of information about how AP3 interacts with HPSP at 2.5 Å resolution and the structural basis of the feedback control mechanism of serine at 2.8 Å. These structural studies on the HPSP protein may provide a clear mechanism and a framework for inhibitor design. We are grateful to Drs. W. Wang and D.

Despite considerable clinical and basic research efforts, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms whereby the Gram-negative bacterium Helicobacter pylori induces gastritis and peptic ulcers in humans is still elusive. Most H. pyloristrains secrete a cytotoxin, VacA, which causes extensive vacuolation in epithelial cells (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Papini E. Zoratti M. Cover T.L. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1757-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). VacA-induced vacuoles represent an aberrant intracellular hybrid compartment that forms as a result of a heterotypic fusion between late endosomes and lysosomes (2Papini E. de Bernard M. Milia E.

Little is known about the intracellular mechanisms that control VacA-induced reorganization of the late endosomal compartment. A role for several proteins involved in membrane trafficking, such as Rab7, Rac1, and dynamin, has recently been proposed (4Papini E. Satin B. Bucci C. de Bernard M. Telford J.L. Manetti R.

However, since none of these proteins nor their loss- or gain-of-function mutants mimic the VacA phenotype (4Papini E. Satin B. Bucci C. de Bernard M. Telford J.L. Manetti R. Rappuoli R. Zerial M.

Invest. 2001; 107: 363-370Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), other proteins and mechanisms relevant to late endosomal compartment biogenesis and function are likely to be involved.While the broad outline of the membrane traffic through the endocytic pathway from the plasma membrane to the late endosome fusion with the lysosomes (or vacuoles in yeast) is now well established, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the formation and sorting functions of the late endosomal compartment are poorly understood (for recent reviews, see Refs. 7Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 229-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar and 8Piper R.C. Luzio J.P. Traffic. 2001; 2: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Morphologically, late endosomes appear to contain multiple small vesicles, which originate by invagination and pinching off from the limiting membrane into the lumenal space. Because of this multivesicular appearance, late endosomes have also been referred to as multivesicular bodies (MVBs) 1The abbreviations used for: MVB, multivesicular body; PI, phosphoinositide; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; P, phosphate; P2, bisphosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type. 1The abbreviations used for: MVB, multivesicular body; PI, phosphoinositide; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; P, phosphate; P2, bisphosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type.; both terms are used herein interchangeably. Genetic studies in budding yeast have identified a set of genes, the class E VPS, that are essential in MVB formation (9Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 1998; 95: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy studies of class E vps yeast mutants have documented the presence of an enlarged, aberrant endosomal compartment comprised of stacked membranes (9Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 1998; 95: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). A central role among the class E proteins is assigned to Vps4p, an AAA ATPase, whose on/off membrane cycle coupled with ATP hydrolysis regulates the membrane association of other class E proteins (10Babst M. Wendland B. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2982-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). A regulatory role in MVB formation is also attributed to Fab1p lipid kinase and its product PtdIns-3,5-P2. Yeast cells that lack Fab1p function contain abnormally large vacuoles and, like the class E mutant strains, appear to be defective in the formation of MVBs (7Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 229-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 9Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 1998; 95: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Thus, genetic studies in yeast strongly suggest that the ability to properly invaginate endosomal membranes and to form MVBs is largely dependent on the correct function of Fab1 and Vps4 gene products.The structural and functional counterparts of yeast Vps4 and Fab1p in mammalian cells are the AAA ATPase SKD1 and the PI 5-/protein kinase PIKfyve, respectively (11Scheuring S. Bodor D. Rohricht R.A. Muller S. Beyer A. Kohrer K. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Shisheva A. Cell Biol. Int. 2001; 25: 1201-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mutations in their catalytic domains convert these proteins into dominant-negative mutants. Similar to the morphological changes observed in yeast, expression of ATPase-deficient SKD1E235Q or kinase-deficient PIKfyveK1831E in mammalian cells of kidney origin induces peripheral vacuoles and enlarged vesicles (13Bishop N. Woodman P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 14Yoshimori T. Yamagata F. Yamamoto A. Mizushima N. Kabeya Y. Nara A. Miwako I. Ohashi M. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y.

Expressed SKD1E235Q and PIKfyveK1831E typically localize on the membranes that outline dilated endomembrane structures. SKD1E235Q vesicles appear positive for markers of either the early or late endocytic compartments, whereas PIKfyveK1831E predominantly co-localizes with MVB markers and not with markers for the earlier compartments (13Bishop N.

These observations suggest that the two mutants dilate both distinct and overlapping endocytic structures. The dramatic vacuolation induced by PIKfyveK1831E is corrected by high levels of PIKfyveWT or PtdIns-3,5-P2, implying that PIKfyve-originated production of PtdIns-3,5-P2 maintains mammalian cell morphology and endocytic membrane homeostasis (15Ikonomov O.C.

The overall evolutionary conservation of the molecular events involved in endocytosis together with the conservation of SKD1 and PIKfyve cellular roles in yeast and mammals suggest that, like their yeast orthologs, mammalian SKD1 and PIKfyve may be functionally related. In this context we sought to examine, first, the functional relationship between the endocytic compartments defined by PIKfyve and SKD1 in mammalian cells and, second, to investigate the potential role of these enzymes in VacA-induced vacuolation. Our results suggest a functional connection between the two proteins, and indicate that PIKfyve, through PtdIns-3,5-P2 production, but not SKD1, negatively regulates the VacA-induced endomembrane vacuolation.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have previously observed that expression of enzymatically defective, dominant-negative mutants of PIKfyve and SKD1 in cells of kidney origin induce similar endomembrane vacuolation. The mutant proteins were found to populate related endocytic compartments as defined by the mannose 6-phosphate receptor marker (14Yoshimori T. Yamagata F. Yamamoto A. Mizushima N. Kabeya Y. Nara A.

Fig.1 illustrates typical images of the abnormal phenotypes in COS-7 cells transiently expressing SKD1E235Q or PIKfyveK1831E, where multiple enlarged vesicles and endomembrane vacuoles could be readily observed. To examine a possible functional relationship between these two proteins we co-expressed SKD1 and PIKfyve wild type proteins and/or their dominant-negative mutants in COS-7 cells. Co-expression of SKD1WT and PIKfyveWT did not change the typical localization pattern seen previously with the singly expressed proteins (14Yoshimori T. Yamagata F. Yamamoto A. Mizushima N. Kabeya Y. Nara A. Miwako I. Ohashi M. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 747-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 15Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Shisheva A. J. Biol.

Thus, pEGFP-SKD1WT showed the characteristic diffuse cytosolic and nuclear localization and co-expressed PIKfyveWT displayed the typical extranuclear scattered puncta on a background of a diffuse cytosolic signal (Fig.2, a and b). No noticeable morphological alterations were found in cells co-expressing the wild types (Fig. 2 c). However, co-expression of ATPase-deficient SKD1E235Q and PIKfyveWTresulted in several changes in protein localization as well as in cell morphology. Thus, in the presence of PIKfyveWT, the SKD1E235Q-positive structures appeared as fine perinuclear puncta (Fig. 2 d). This differed drastically from the SKD1E235Q-positive dilated vesicles and vacuoles observed previously by the singly expressed SKD1E235Q in cells of kidney origin and confirmed here (Refs. 13Bishop N. Woodman P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar and 14Yoshimori T. Yamagata F. Yamamoto A. Mizushima N. Kabeya Y. Nara A. Miwako I. Ohashi M. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 747-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar and Fig. 1,a and b). The PIKfyveWT-positive compartment also underwent a significant redistribution in the presence of co-expressed SKD1E235Q and was seen as perinuclear clusters, rather than scattered puncta (Fig. 2 e). In contrast to this PIKfyveWT-dependent inhibition of the SKD1E235Q-induced abnormal morphology, SKD1WT did not prevent the abnormal phenotype produced by dominant-negative PIKfyveK1831E. As demonstrated in Fig. 2,g–i, cells co-expressing SKDWT and PIKfyveK1831E produced a vacuolation similar to that observed upon expression of PIKfyveK1831E alone. Finally, the vacuolation in cells co-expressing the two dominant-negative mutants appeared as a sum of their individual abnormal phenotypes with only partial co-localization of the two proteins upon merging the images (Fig. 2, j–l, and not shown). These observations are consistent with the notion that expressed SKD1E235Q and PIKfyveK1831E dilate both overlapping and distinct populations of endocytic structures, which are functionally related. The fact that increased PIKfyve enzymatic activity could largely overcome the action of the ATPase-deficient SKD1 mutant, but not vice versa, indicates that the functions of the two proteins are not interchangeable. Rather, we speculate the two enzymes act on endosomal membranes in sequential fashion whereby the SKD1 ATPase activity most likely precedes PIKfyve action and appears important for the organization of the endocytic membranes defined by PIKfyve.Figure 2Expression of PIKfyveWTattenuates the abnormal morphology induced by SKD1E235Q. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with pEGFP-SKD1 and pCMV5-HA-PIKfyve cDNAs encoding the wild type or mutant proteins paired in the indicated combinations. Twenty-four hours posttransfection the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-HA antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Expression of the PIKfyve proteins was detected by Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (b,e, h, and k), that of SKD1 by the fluorescence signals of GFP (a, d, g, and j), and the vacuolation phenotype, by phase-contrast of the same fields (c, f, i, andl). Arrows in d–f demonstrate lack of a vacuolation phenotype in SKD1E235Q/PIKfyveWTco-expressing cell, and arrowheads indicate the presence of a vacuolation phenotype in a cell expressing only SKD1E235Q. Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The endomembrane vacuolation induced by the dominant-negative ATPase-deficient SKD1 or kinase-deficient PIKfyve, presented in Fig. 1, morphologically resembles the intracellular vacuolation caused by theH. pylori VacA toxin. Accumulated experimental evidence supports two hypotheses for the molecular mechanism of VacA action: the toxin forms anion-selective channels and/or interacts with protein targets that trigger the endogenous vacuolating mechanism (reviewed in Ref. 1Papini E. Zoratti M. Cover T.L. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1757-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this regard endosomal proteins, such as SKD1 and PIKfyve, whose dominant-interfering mutants mimic VacA vacuolation should be a central focus, since they are likely candidate down-stream targets of the VacA toxin. Therefore, we examined the effect of SKD1WTand PIKfyveWT expression on VacA-induced vacuolation. For this purpose transfected COS-7 cells were treated for 24 h with VacA and the number of the SKD1WT- or PIKfyveWT-expressing cells that displayed a vacuolated phenotype was assessed. As illustrated in Fig.3 A, expression of PIKfyveWT, but not SKD1WT, markedly inhibited the vacuolation induced by VacA. Quantitation of results from four separate experiments demonstrated that only 7 ± 1% of the PIKfyveWT-expressing cells developed vacuoles upon VacA treatment versus 60 ± 5% of the non-transfected cells in the same dish (Fig. 3 B). Under the same conditions VacA induced vacuolation in 58 ± 6% of the SKD1WT-transfected cells (Fig. 3 B). The potential role for PIKfyve in VacA-induced vacuolation was further supported by the detection of expressed EGFP-PIKfyveWT on the limiting membrane of VacA-induced vacuoles in cells where, occasionally, the abnormal phenotype failed to be corrected (not shown).Figure 3Expression of PIKfyveWT, but not SKD1WT, prevents H. pylori VacA-induced vacuolation. COS-7 cells were transfected with the indicated pEGFP-based constructs and intoxicated with VacA as specified under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells were fixed 24 h after VacA addition and observed by fluorescence (a andc) and phase-contrast microscopy of the same fields (b and d). A, shown are cells expressing SKD1WT (panel a) that display large perinuclear vacuoles similar to those of the non-transfected cells (panel b), a PIKfyveWT-expressing cell (panel c) that failed to be vacuolated by VacA, in contrast to the neighboring cells (panel d). Bar, 10 μm.B, quantitation of vacuolating effects of VacA from four independent experiments assessed by appearance of visible vacuoles through phase-contrast microscopy. The number of vacuole-positive cells is expressed as percentage of the total number of counted cells (>100 cells/condition/experiments) and presented as mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm the observed inhibition of VacA-induced vacuolation by PIKfyveWT in another cell system and to provide alternative quantification of this phenomenon, we examined the vacuolating effect of VacA in a HEK293 stable line inducibly expressing PIKfyveWT. These cells express ∼7–8-fold higher levels of PIKfyveWT versus the endogenous protein 24 h after induction of the protein expression with doxycycline as revealed by Western blotting analysis with anti-PIKfyve antibodies (Fig. 4 A). The expressed protein seems, at least in part, to localize to the authentic PIKfyve sites as judged by its vesicular appearance, along with the cytosolic staining upon immunofluorescence microscopy analysis with an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 4 B). Importantly, induction of the PIKfyveWT expression resulted in a substantial inhibition of the cellular vacuolation due to VacA as revealed on the basis of neutral red uptake of the vacuolated cells (Fig. 4 C). Thus, 5 h following intoxication with VacA, HEK293 cells that were induced to express PIKfyveWT showed 60% less net neutral red uptake versus non-induced cells (Fig. 4 C). Importantly, doxycycline treatment did not affect the basal or VacA-dependent neutral red uptake in the parental HEK293 cells (Fig. 4 C). It should be noted that at the level of expression of PIKfyveWT in this cell type, 24 h following VacA treatment, both induced and non-induced cells were vacuolated and showed similar values of the neutral red uptake (not shown). However, expression of PIKfyveWT in this cell type not only substantially inhibited early VacA induced vacuolation but also led to a faster recovery of cell morphology back to normal after removal of VacA. As seen on the images presented in Fig.4 D, 18 h following the toxin removal, HEK293 cells induced to express PIKfyveWT showed practically no vacuoles. In contrast, the non-induced cells displayed prominent vacuolation (Fig. 4 D). Together, these results demonstrate that while dominant-negative mutants of SKD1 and PIKfyve could both induce a vacuolated phenotype, only high levels of PIKfyveWT inhibit the vacuole formation due to VacA. These observations suggest that VacA-dependent vacuoles arise in a process that is negatively regulated by PIKfyve. SKD1 action is likely upstream or distal to the site of VacA action on endocytic membranes.Figure 4Induction of PIKfyveWT expression in HEK293 stable cell line inhibits VacA induced vacuolation.HEK293 parental (Control) or stable cell lines inducibly expressing HA-PIKfyveWT (clone 9) were incubated in the presence (+) or absence (−) of doxycycline for 18 h to induce protein expression as indicated. A, cell lysates of clone 9 were obtained in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-PIKfyve antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shown is a chemiluminescence detection of a representative immunoblot. B, cells (clone 9) were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-HA antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, cells were treated with VacA for 5 h and then incubated for 4 min with neutral red. The dye was extracted and the absorbance (540 nm) of the samples determined (1:10 dilution). Shown is the mean ± S.E. of the increase in the optical density over corresponding non-treated control cells from three independent experiments in triplicates. The optical density measured at the basal conditions was between 0.053 and 0.110 and was subtracted to calculate the net neutral red uptake (see “Experimental Procedures”).D, cells (clone 9) were treated with VacA for 24 h and the medium was then replaced with growth medium. Cells were observed live 18 h after VacA withdrawal by phase-contrast microscopy. Shown are random fields of induced or non-induced cells as indicated. Absence of vacuoles due to VacA in PIKfyveWT-induced cells is apparent.

Therefore, we next examined whether increased cellular levels of PtdIns3,5-P2 could selectively inhibit the VacA-induced vacuolation in COS cells. As shown in Fig. 5, microinjection of PtdIns-3,5-P2, but not PtdIns-4,5-P2 or PtdIns-5-P (not shown), inhibited the capacity of VacA to induce cell vacuolation. Quantitation from three independent microinjection experiments indicate that only 15 ± 2% of the PtdIns-3,5-P2-injected cells exhibited vacuoles, notably with a less pronounced appearance compared with the PtdIns-4,5-P2-injected or non-injected cells, in which the VacA efficiency was 60 ± 5% (p < 0.001). Thus, similarly to the vacuolation induced by the kinase-defective dominant-negative PIKfyve mutants (16Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Mlak K. Kanzaki M. Pessin J. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9206-9211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the VacA-induced vacuolation was selectively rescued by increased PtdIns-3,5-P2levels.Figure 5Microinjected PtdIns-3,5-P2selectively prevents VacA-induced vacuolation.COS-7 cells were microinjected in the cytosol with mixtures of Texas Red-dextran and the indicated PIs and then treated with VacA toxin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Twenty-four hours after VacA treatment the cells were fixed for fluorescence microscopy. Shown are fluorescence images (a and c) visualizing the microinjected cells by Texas Red-dextran signals and the phase-contrast images of the same fields (b and d). Depicted are two PtdIns-3,5-P2- (arrows in b) and three PtdIns-4,5-P2-injected cells (arrowheadsin d) demonstrating practically no vacuole formation (b) or prominent vacuolation (d), respectively, due to VacA. Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The dramatic inhibition of VacA-induced vacuolation by two independent approaches, i.e. expression of PIKfyveWT in different cell types and cytosolic microinjection of PtdIns-3,5-P2, demonstrated above, strongly supports the central role of PIKfyve and its lipid product PtdIns-3,5-P2in the molecular mechanisms of endomembrane vacuolation induced by VacA. However, VacA does not directly inhibit PIKfyve, because, when added to the in vitro PIKfyve kinase assay, the toxin did not inhibit PtdIns-3,5-P2 production (not shown). This result is consistent with the notion that VacA exerts an indirect inhibitory effect on this enzyme. Determination of the intracellular PtdIns-3,5-P2 levels in response to VacA as well as the predicted upstream intermediate of the PIKfyve pathway that is negatively regulated by VacA, are important objectives for future studies.Thus far, three proteins, each localized on late endosomal-lysosomal membranes and displaying the ability to bind and hydrolize GTP, have been shown to be important in VacA-induced vacuole formation,i.e. Rab7 (4Papini E.

However, proteolytic sensitivity of AMPD polypeptides makes it likely that prior studies were performed with N-truncated enzymes. This study uses erythrocyte ghosts to characterize the reversible cytoplasmic membrane association of human full-sized recombinant isoform E (AMPD3). Membrane-bound isoform E exhibits diminished catalytic activity whereas low micromolar concentrations of the cationic antibiotic, neomycin, disrupt this protein-lipid interaction and relieve catalytic inhibition. The cytoplasmic membrane association of isoform E also displays an inverse correlation with pH in the physiological range. Diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) modification of isoform E nearly abolishes its cytoplasmic membrane binding capacity, and this effect can be reversed by hydroxylamine. Difference spectra reveal that 18 of 29 histidine residues in each isoform E subunit are N-carbethoxylated by DEPC. These combined data demonstrate that protonated imidazole rings of histidine residues mediate a pH-responsive association of isoform E with anionic charges on the surface of the cytoplasmic membrane, possibly phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, a pure noncompetitive inhibitor of the enzyme. Finally, AMPD1 and a series of N-truncated AMPD3 enzymes are used to show that these behaviors are specific to isoform E and require up to 48 N-terminal amino acids, even though this stretch of sequence contains no histidine residues.

However, extreme N-terminal regions in mammalian AMPD polypeptides are highly sensitive to proteolysis during purification and subsequent storage of the enzyme at 4 °C (16Ranieri-Raggi M. Raggi A.

Recombinant technology provides a means to overexpress AMPD enzymes that can be purified with subunits predominantly intact, although these are also subject to proteolysis during storage at 4 °C (20Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. Tullson P.C. Sabina R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35118-35125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The availability of purified AMPD enzymes with subunits predominantly intact has stimulated interest in the structural and functional significance of extreme N-terminal sequences that were likely missing from previously characterized enzyme preparations. Recent studies have shown that extreme N-terminal sequences only subtly influence the catalytic and regulatory properties of human AMPD isoforms (20Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. Tullson P.C. Sabina R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35118-35125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. Sabina R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2001; 285: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Conversely, divergent N-terminal residues may play an important role in the intracellular distribution of AMPD as evidenced by their effects on contractile protein binding behavior (20Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. Tullson P.C. Sabina R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35118-35125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,21Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. Sabina R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2001; 285: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although a more C-terminal conserved contractile protein binding domain has been identified in all AMPD isoforms, a stretch of sequence in the unique N-terminal region of the AMPD1 polypeptide is required for the high actomyosin binding capacity of isoform M (21Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. Sabina R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2001; 285: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This observation is functionally significant because contractile protein binding is an important physiological regulator of catalytic activity in stimulated skeletal muscle (22Rundell K.W. Tullson P.C. Terjung R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C287-C293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rundell K.W. Tullson P.C. Terjung R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C294-C299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the primary site of AMPD1 expression. Although more widely distributed across human tissues and cells (15Ogasawara N. Goto H. Yamada Y. Watanabe T. Asano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 714: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the highest level of AMPD3 expression is also observed in skeletal muscle (3Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. Eddy R. Shows T.B. Sabina R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1306: 75-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), where isoform E appears confined predominantly to type I fibers (24Kuppevelt T.H.v. Veerkamp J.H. Fishbein W.N. Ogasawara N. Sabina R.L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, up to 48 amino acids in the unique N terminus of isoform E dramatically suppress contractile protein binding capacity of this enzyme (21Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. Sabina R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2001; 285: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a behavior that could facilitate other intracellular interactions. Consistent with this hypothesis, available information indicates that mammalian AMPD3 enzymes can reversibly associate with the cytoplasmic membrane. This was initially revealed by the observation that human erythrocyte membrane preparations contained AMPD activity (25Askari A. Science. 1963; 141: 44-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Subsequent work using purified human erythrocyte AMPD (isoform E) demonstrated an association with the cytoplasmic face of erythrocyte ghost (EG) membranes that was also accompanied by reduced catalytic activity (26Pipoly G.M. Nathans G.R. Chang D. Deuel T.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 1066-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Moreover, membrane association and the related inhibition of catalytic activity could be reversed in the presence of small molecule effectors, including substrate (26Pipoly G.M. Nathans G.R. Chang D. Deuel T.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 1066-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). More recently, a series of studies has shown that interactions between purified pig heart AMPD, the porcine ortholog of human isoform E (27Hohl A.M. Hohl C.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 201: 151-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and isolated cytoplasmic membrane vesicles and artificial lipid bilayers (28Wozniak M. Kossowska E. Purzycka-Preis J. Zydowo M.M. Biochem.

Knowledge of the physical basis for these protein-lipid interactions and the effects they have on catalytic behavior of AMPD3 enzymes have been advanced by two recent observations (31Sims B. Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. Profit A.A. Prestwich G.D. Sabina R.L. Theibert A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25701-25707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 1) Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), an integral membrane phospholipid, is a potent noncompetitive inhibitor of human recombinant isoform E and its primary proteolytic product, ΔM90. 2) Incubation of rat PC12 cells with taurine causes an increase in total phosphoinositide concentrations that is accompanied by a higher percentage of membrane-associated AMPD activity. However, as detailed above, it is likely that much of the available information on protein-lipid interactions involving AMPD has been obtained with proteolyzed AMPD3 enzymes. This study was designed to characterize the functional and structural basis for the cytoplasmic membrane association of human full-sized recombinant AMPD isoform E. Grace's insect cell medium and fetal calf serum were purchased from Invitrogen. Phosphocellulose (P11) was obtained from Whatman, Ltd. Disposable glass columns and a Protein Assay kit were available through Bio-Rad. Outdated human blood was provided by The Blood Center of Southeastern Wisconsin. Neomycin sulfate was purchased from CalBiochem NovaBiochem Corp. Goat anti-rabbit IgG was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest qualities commercially available. Human AMPD3 recombinant (wild type 1b and all N-truncated) enzymes and an N-truncated AMPD1 (ΔM54) enzyme were expressed in Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells using baculoviral technology as previously described (20Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. Tullson P.C. Sabina R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35118-35125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. Sabina R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2001; 285: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All N-truncated constructs were produced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using wild type cDNAs (AMPD1[exon 2+] and AMPD3[1b]) as templates. In some cases, the ATG triplet contained within an NcoI restriction site (CCATGG; naturally occurring or created) corresponded to a methionine start codon in the wild type mRNA (ΔM54AMPD1 and N-truncated AMPD3 enzymes ΔM90 and ΔM127). In other cases, introduction of the ATG triplet in the mutant cDNA resulted in a methionine substitution at the N terminus of the encoded truncated polypeptide (AMPD3 enzymes ΔL20M, ΔI49M, and ΔE65M). Recombinant proteins were purified from clarified sonicates of infected cells by phosphocellulose chromatography with sequential linear salt (0.1–2.0 mpotassium chloride) and phosphate (0.02–0.45 m potassium phosphate) gradient elution followed by ammonium sulfate (30% w/v) precipitation as previously described (21Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. Sabina R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2001; 285: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The specific activities of the purified AMPD3 enzymes ranged from 550 to 2000 units/mg protein, whereas that of the ΔM54AMPD1 enzyme was 5000 units/mg (21Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. Sabina R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2001; 285: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Purified enzymes were suspended in 50 mm imidazole, pH 6.5 (AMPD1) or 7.0 (AMPD3) containing 500 mm KCl and stored at −80 °C in 50% (v/v) glycerol. Unsealed erythrocyte ghosts (EG) were prepared after the method of Steck and Kant (32Steck T.L. Kant J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of outdated human blood was diluted 1:6 with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 150 mm sodium chloride) and pelleted at 1877 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a refrigerated tabletop centrifuge. Cell pellets were washed three times with ice-cold PBS to remove hemolyzed cells. Intact erythrocytes were lysed by rapidly and thoroughly resuspending the cells in 40 ml of ice-cold 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0 (5P8), then centrifuging at 22,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Ghosts were washed four times with ice-cold 5P8 to remove soluble cellular contents, then resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 5P8, and stored at 4 °C until use. Residual AMPD activities in unsealed EG suspensions were below the level of detection. Total protein per unit volume of resuspended ghosts was determined by Bio-Rad assay. Sealed, right-side-out EG were prepared from unsealed EG after the method of Steck and Kant (32Steck T.L. Kant J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 μl of unsealed EG were resuspended in 20 ml of PBS and incubated 40 min at 37 °C to induce resealing. Resealed ghosts were then pelleted at 22,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed twice more in PBS and stored at 4 °C until use. A parallel aliquot of unsealed ghosts was maintained in 5P8 and treated similarly, then used as a control for subsequent comparative binding studies with increasing amounts of enzyme (see below). Residual AMPD activities in these sealed and unsealed EG suspensions were also below the level of detection. Total protein per unit volume of resuspended ghosts was determined by Bio-Rad assay. 100-μl mixtures of AMPD enzyme and EG, the latter resuspended in binding buffer (5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 45 mm potassium chloride, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), were incubated on ice (see text for amounts and times of incubation). Partitioning of AMPD enzymes between the supernatant and pellet was then evaluated as follows: mixtures were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered and residual AMPD quantitated by enzyme assay and Western blot analysis (see below). EG pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer and AMPD was quantitated as described above. Other experimental conditions are described in the text. AMPD enzymes were dialyzed overnight against 4000 volumes of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 containing 100 mm potassium chloride and 1 mmdithiothreitol in order to reduce the imidazole concentration in stored preparations. Stock solutions of diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) were freshly prepared in absolute ethanol immediately before use. DEPC modification reactions were performed in an 82-μl mixture comprised of ∼4.5 units of enzyme diluted 1:1 in dialysis buffer. Reactions were initiated by the addition of DEPC to a final concentration of 250 μm, incubated for 120 min on ice, then quenched by the addition of imidazole to a final concentration of 2.4 mm. As a control, an equivalent volume of absolute ethanol (minus DEPC) was added to a parallel mixture and treated identically. Ethanol concentrations were less than 2.5% (v/v). Aliquots of treated and untreated enzyme were then incubated with EG and association was evaluated as described above. Hydroxylamine hydrochloride (adjusted to pH 7.0) was then added to the remainder of each quenched mixture (DEPC-treated and untreated) to a final concentration of 150 mm. These mixtures were then incubated for an additional 60 min at room temperature. Aliquots were then removed, and EG association was evaluated as described above. Preliminary experiments were performed in which the time of incubation and concentrations of chemical modifiers were varied in order to determine optimal conditions. DEPC modification of histidine residues was analyzed by recording difference spectra using a Shimadzu dual beam spectrophotometer. The formation ofN-carbethoxyimidazole derivatives of histidine can then be quantitated by measuring an increase in absorbance at 240 nm using an extinction coefficient of 3200 m−1cm−1 (33Ovadi J. Libor S. Elodi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 2: 455-458Google Scholar). The modification reaction included E1b enzyme (7.6 μm subunit concentration) suspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 containing 100 mm potassium chloride and was initiated by the addition of DEPC to a final concentration of 1 mm. This was referenced against a parallel suspension of enzyme containing an equivalent volume of added ethanol (minus DEPC). Aliquots were removed at appropriate time intervals and quenched in 10 mm imidazole so that EG association could also be evaluated as described above. Sf9 insect cell membranes were prepared according to the method of Sarkadiet al. (34Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, six confluent T-185 flasks were infected with human AMPD3 wild type recombinant baculovirus for 4 days at 27 °C. Infected cells were collected and pelleted at 365 × g for 6 min in a refrigerated tabletop centrifuge, then suspended in ice-cold TMEP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm mannitol, 2 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml E-64, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 150 mm potassium chloride. Cell suspensions were lysed using 50 strokes of a hand-held glass-Teflon homogenizer on ice. Undisrupted cells and nuclear debris were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min in a refrigerated tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant fluid was then divided into two aliquots and centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 ×g. Pellets containing the membranes were resuspended either in ice-cold TMEP buffer alone or in that supplemented with 150 mm potassium chloride at a protein concentration of 3–5 mg/ml. Membrane suspensions were stored at −80 °C until further use. AMP deaminase activity was measured in 100-μl reactions (including 30 μl of supernatant or resuspended EG pellet) containing 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 100 mm potassium chloride, 20 μg of bovine serum albumin and 20 mm AMP. This saturating substrate concentration is also sufficient to disrupt the EG association of AMPD3 enzymes (see below). Substrate and product were resolved and quantitated by anion-exchange HPLC as previously described (7Bausch-Jurken M.T. Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. Morisaki T. Sabina R.L. J. Biol.

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was chosen as a marker presumed to reside on the cytoplasmic side of the erythrocyte membrane, and its activity was determined by the method of Steck and Kant (32Steck T.L. Kant J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of sealed or unsealed EG protein was added at room temperature to 1-ml reaction mixtures comprised of freshly prepared 24.6 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 8.4 containing 3.28 mm cysteine HCl, 12 mm sodium arsenate, 1 mm β-NAD+, and 1.5 mmglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Activity was monitored at 340 nm in a spectrophotometer that was blanked against identical mixtures without erythrocyte ghost protein added. The reactions were linear with time up to 3 min. Proteins were fractionated by 9% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against human AMPD recombinant enzymes, as previously described (20Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. Tullson P.C. Sabina R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35118-35125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Instat program software was used to generate data means and S.D. and to perform two-tailed Student's t tests. Preliminary experiments were performed to characterize the association of isoform E (E1b) and ΔM90 enzymes with EG. E1b is one of three identified AMPD3 spliceoforms, and the ΔM90 variant is modeled after the primary N-terminal proteolytic product generated from this protein during purification and extended storage at 4 °C (20Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. Tullson P.C. Sabina R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35118-35125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). ΔM90 was typically included in most experiments to simulate proteolyzed endogenous enzyme likely used in a previous study that examined the membrane association of human erythrocyte AMPD (26Pipoly G.M. Nathans G.R. Chang D. Deuel T.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 1066-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Fig.1 presents the results of enzyme assay and Western blot analysis in which increasing amounts of E1b and ΔM90 enzymes were incubated either with unsealed or sealed, right-side out ghosts. Both enzymes exhibit a substantially greater association with the unsealed preparation suggesting that interactions occur primarily with intracellular components of the ghost structure. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, a marker for the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, was also measured in both ghost preparations. The activity of this enzyme was measurable only in the unsealed ghost suspension (unsealed, 0.096 ± 0.012 Δ340 nm/min/μg ghost protein (n = 3); sealed, <0.003 Δ340 nm/min/μg ghost protein). All subsequent experiments were performed using unsealed erythrocyte ghosts. Enzyme assay and Western blot data also reveal that EG associations of the E1b and ΔM90 proteins are saturable with respect to the time of incubation and amounts of EG and enzyme added to the mixture (data not shown). This information was used to standardize subsequent experiments that unless otherwise stated employed 30-min incubations with 10 μg of EG protein and less than saturating amounts of AMPD3 enzymes (0.1–1.2 units; see text and figure legends for specific amounts). Previous work has shown that EG association of purified human erythrocyte AMPD results in catalytic inhibition of the enzyme, although substrate concentrations greater than 100 μm can disrupt this interaction (26Pipoly G.M. Nathans G.R. Chang D. Deuel T.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 1066-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was necessary to determine a substrate concentration where the EG dissociation of the E1b and ΔM90 proteins was essentially complete in order that enzyme assay could be used as a reliable quantitative index following their partitioning into EG pellets. Parallel ghost resuspensions with associated enzymes were incubated with increasing amounts of AMP and partitioning was re-evaluated. Enzyme assay and Western blot analysis were used to show that the interaction between EG and either AMPD3 protein was sensitive to increasing substrate concentration and essentially eliminated in the presence of 5 mm AMP (data not shown). This information confirmed that a saturating level of substrate (20 mm) was adequate to enable enzyme assay to be used as a reliable quantitative indicator of AMPD3 protein association with EG pellets. Neomycin was evaluated as an antagonist of the associations between AMPD3 enzymes and EG under the premise that these interactions may be related to their affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2, an integral membrane phospholipid that is also a potent noncompetitive inhibitor of catalytic activity (31Sims B. Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. Profit A.A. Prestwich G.D. Sabina R.L. Theibert A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25701-25707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic containing six primary amine groups that bind to PtdIns(4,5)P2 with micromolar affinity (36Schacht J. J. Neurochem. 1976; 27: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 37Schacht J. J, Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1063-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Gabev E. Kasianowicz J. Abbott T. McLaughlin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 979: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 39Arbuzova A. Martushova K. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. Morris A.J. Ozaki S. Prestwich G.D. Mclaughlin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of neomycin were added to parallel resuspensions of ghosts containing associated AMPD3 enzyme, and partitioning was immediately re-evaluated at each concentration of the drug. As shown in Fig.2 by both enzyme assay and Western blot analysis, low micromolar concentrations of neomycin produce dramatic EG dissociation of the E1b protein, with ∼60 and 85% of the protein released at 5 and 50 μm, respectively. Conversely, EG association of the ΔM90 enzyme is relatively unaffected, and only about 20% of this protein is released by drug concentrations as high as 500 μm. The observed EG dissociation of this N-truncated activity is likely due to the reported ability of neomycin to act as an anion-exchanger at high (mm) concentrations (40Prentki M. Deeney J. Matschinsky F.M. Joseph S.K. FEBS Lett. 1986; 197: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Parallel analyses were performed using several other recombinant enzymes with progressive N-terminal deletions. As also illustrated in Fig. 2, an activity lacking 19 N-terminal residues, ΔL20M, behaves in a fashion similar to the E1b protein, although it is not as profoundly affected. Conversely, three other AMPD3 enzymes with truncations of 49–126 amino acids mimic the behavior of the ΔM90 protein and are relatively resistant to EG dissociation by low micromolar concentrations of neomycin.
