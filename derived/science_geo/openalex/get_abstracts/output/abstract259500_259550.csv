We found that, after viral challenge, bacteria integrated new spacers derived from phage genomic sequences. Removal or addition of particular spacers modified the phage-resistance phenotype of the cell. Thus, CRISPR, together with associated cas genes, provided resistance against phages, and resistance specificity is determined by spacer-phage sequence similarity."

Here we show that increasing miR-181a expression in mature T cells augments the sensitivity to peptide antigens, while inhibiting miR-181a expression in the immature T cells reduces sensitivity and impairs both positive and negative selection. Moreover, quantitative regulation of T cell sensitivity by miR-181a enables mature T cells to recognize antagonists—the inhibitory peptide antigens—as agonists. These effects are in part achieved by the downregulation of multiple phosphatases, which leads to elevated steady-state levels of phosphorylated intermediates and a reduction of the T cell receptor signaling threshold. Importantly, higher miR-181a expression correlates with greater T cell sensitivity in immature T cells, suggesting that miR-181a acts as an intrinsic antigen sensitivity “rheostat” during T cell development.

One of the key features of a functioning immune system is its ability to distinguish antigens of foreign origin from those derived endogenously and to mount an immune response against the former. With respect to T cells, this goal is achieved through antigen recognition by T cell receptors (TCRs) and a highly ordered developmental process in the thymus. TCRs constantly sample a diverse set of self and foreign peptide antigens presented in major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and these interactions elicit discrete intracellular signals and T cell responses. The mature T cell's response to antigen is largely dictated by the binding characteristics of its TCR for a given peptide-MHC complex (pMHC) (Kersh and Allen, 1996Kersh G.J. Allen P.M. Structural basis for T cell recognition of altered peptide ligands: a single T cell receptor can productively recognize a large continuum of related ligands.J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In general, pMHC ligands with slower dissociation rates produce stronger TCR signals and lead to higher T cell reactivity to the antigenic peptides (Davis et al., 1998Davis M.M. Boniface J.J.

Typically, the most stable pMHC complexes with respect to TCR binding are agonists, while the less stable variants are weak agonists and then antagonists (Lyons et al., 1996Lyons D.S. Lieberman S.A.

Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and also block responses to agonist ligand (De Magistris et al., 1992De Magistris M.T. Alexander J. Coggeshall M. Altman A.

Antigen analog-major histocompatibility complexes act as antagonists of the T cell receptor.Cell. 1992; 68: 625-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Although a number of models have been proposed to explain this kinetic discrimination in T cell activation (McKeithan, 1995McKeithan T.W.

USA. 1996; 93: 1401-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), exactly how T cells sense quantitative changes in antigenic peptide affinities through their TCRs and produce both quantitatively and qualitatively different responses remains an intensive area of study. In addition, T cell responsiveness and TCR signaling to a specific ligand also vary with different developmental stages, suggesting that T cell sensitivity to antigens is intrinsically regulated during development (Davey et al., 1998Davey G.M. Schober S.L. Endrizzi B.T. Dutcher A.K. Jameson S.C. Hogquist K.A. Preselection thymocytes are more sensitive to T cell receptor stimulation than mature T cells.J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1867-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For example, in immature CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) thymocytes, low affinity antigenic peptides that are unable to activate mature effector T cells are sufficient to induce strong activation and clonal deletion (Pircher et al., 1991Pircher H. Rohrer U.H. Moskophidis D. Zinkernagel R.M. Hengartner H. Lower receptor avidity required for thymic clonal deletion than for effector T-cell function.Nature. 1991; 351: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar); antagonists that are normally inhibitory to effector T cells can induce positive selection (Hogquist et al., 1994Hogquist K.A. Jameson S.C. Heath W.R. Howard J.L. Bevan M.J. Carbone F.R. T cell receptor antagonist peptides induce positive selection.Cell. 1994; 76: 17-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar). These observations demonstrate that T cell sensitivity is intrinsically regulated to ensure proper development of specificity and sensitivity to foreign antigens while avoiding self recognition. However, little is known about how intrinsic molecular programs influence this sensitivity. Recent studies suggest that microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene regulation may represent a fundamental layer of posttranscriptional genetic programs in metazoan genomes that has broad effects on gene expression (Ambros, 2003Ambros V. MicroRNA pathways in flies and worms: growth, death, fat, stress, and timing.Cell. 2003; 113: 673-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar, Bartel, 2004Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: genomics, biogenesis, mechanism, and function.Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27026) Google Scholar). These ∼22 nt RNAs can repress the expression of protein-coding genes by targeting cognate messenger RNAs for degradation or translational repression (Ambros, 2003Ambros V.

Chen C.Z. Micromanagers of gene expression: the potentially widespread influence of metazoan microRNAs.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Many miRNAs are differentially regulated in hematopoietic lineages, and some have been shown to play roles in controlling the development of immune cells (Chen et al., 2004Chen C.Z. Li L. Lodish H.F. Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs modulate hematopoietic lineage differentiation.Science. 2004; 303: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2638) Google Scholar, Fazi et al., 2005Fazi F. Rosa A. Fatica A. Gelmetti V. De Marchis M.L. Nervi C. Bozzoni I.

However, the role of miRNAs in the adaptive immune response is largely unknown. Among many known hematopoietic miRNAs, miR-181a was shown to have a role in B and T cell differentiation when ectopically expressed in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (Chen et al., 2004Chen C.Z. Li L. Lodish H.F. Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs modulate hematopoietic lineage differentiation.Science. 2004; 303: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2638) Google Scholar). Interestingly, miR-181a is also strongly expressed in the mouse thymus. To characterize the role of miR-181a in T cells, we examined how miR-181a expression is regulated during T cell development and maturation. T cell differentiation in the thymus can be divided into discrete stages characterized by the expression of CD4 and CD8 coreceptors. CD4 and CD8 double-negative (DN) cells, which are the early T cell progenitors, can differentiate into CD4 and CD8 DP cells and then CD4 or CD8 single-positive (SP) cells. DN cells can be further fractionated based on the expression of CD44 and CD25 into DN1 (CD44+ CD25−), DN2 (CD44+ CD25+), DN3 (CD44− CD25+), and DN4 (CD44−CD25−) cell populations, in the order of their appearance during development. We purified these populations by FACS sorting according to surface marker expression. We also obtained CD4+ naïve T cells from the lymph nodes of Rag2−/− 5C.C7 TCR transgenic mice and derived Th1 and Th2 effector cells. Analysis of miR-181a expression in these populations revealed a dynamic regulation of miR-181a expression during T cell maturation (Figure 1A). miR-181a expression is high in the early T cell differentiation stages ranging from approximately 427 to 858 to 1077 copies/cell in the DN1-3 cell populations, respectively. Its expression then drops sharply to ∼225, 141, 42, and 14 copies/cell in DN4, DP, CD4 SP, and CD8 SP thymocytes. We also noticed a further decrease to ∼29 copies/cell in naïve cells, and ∼12 and ∼8 copies/cell in Th1 and Th2 cells (Figure 1A). Notably, when comparing to effector T cells and taking into account that DP cells are much smaller in size, miR-181a expression is significantly higher in DP cells, which are more sensitive to pMHCs with low or intermediate affinities. In comparison, miR-142-3p, a hematopoietic-specific miRNA (Chen et al., 2004Chen C.Z. Li L. Lodish H.F. Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs modulate hematopoietic lineage differentiation.Science. 2004; 303: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2638) Google Scholar), has distinct expression patterns during T cell development and maturation (Figure S1A). The dynamic regulation of miR-181a expression indicates that miR-181a may play a role in T cell maturation. Indeed, using an OP9-DL1 stromal cell and thymocyte coculture assay (Schmitt et al., 2004Schmitt T.M. Ciofani M. Petrie H.T. Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Maintenance of T cell specification and differentiation requires recurrent notch receptor-ligand interactions.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), we have shown that ectopic expression of miR-181a in DN thymocytes causes a quantitative increase in the percentage of DP cells and a decrease in the proportion of CD8+ SP cells (H.M., T. Mao, and C.-Z.C., unpublished data), suggesting that miR-181a can influence the development of thymic progenitor cells during both pre-TCR and TCR-dependent stages. To investigate miR-181a's role in antigen recognition, we assessed its effect on TCR signaling in antigen-primed CD4+ T cells. We increased the expression of miR-181a in primed T cells derived from 5C.C7 TCR transgenic mice by retroviral transduction (Figure S2A), and this resulted in an approximately 3- to 5-fold elevation in miR-181a levels (Figure 1B). T cells were then stimulated with CH27 APCs preloaded with a nonsaturating amount of agonist peptide derived from Moth Cytochrome C (MCC, amino acids 88–103), and then TCR signaling strength was assessed by measuring calcium elevation using video microscopy and ratio imaging. Elevated miR-181a expression in T cells resulted in a substantial increase in intracellular calcium upon stimulation by MCC, whereas mutations in the 5′ two and three nucleotides of miR-181a reduced this activity nearly to the basal level (Figure S3). Furthermore, miR-181a expression in T cells increased IL-2 production by 2-fold compared to the control (Figure 2D). These results show that increased miR-181a expression augments TCR-mediated T cell activation. We then measured the effects of miR-181a on TCR signal output at the single cell level (Figures 1C and 1D; Movies S1 and S2). The TCR signal input is defined as the number of antigenic pMHC complexes at the T:APC interface, and the output is measured as the calcium concentration changes in the T cell cytosol (Irvine et al., 2002Irvine D.J. Purbhoo M.A. Krogsgaard M. Davis M.M. Direct observation of ligand recognition by T lymphocytes.Nature. 2002; 419: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, Li et al., 2004Li Q.J.

T cell killing does not require the formation of a stable mature immunological synapse.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In T cells infected with control virus (control T cells), approximately five MCC peptides are needed to produce a half-maximal calcium response (EC50) (Figures 1C and 1E). This response is essentially identical to that of uninfected T cells (Irvine et al., 2002Irvine D.J. Purbhoo M.A. Krogsgaard M. Davis M.M. Direct observation of ligand recognition by T lymphocytes.Nature. 2002; 419: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, Li et al., 2004Li Q.J. Dinner A.R. Qi S. Irvine D.J. Huppa J.B. Davis M.M. Chakraborty A.K. CD4 enhances T cell sensitivity to antigen by coordinating Lck accumulation at the immunological synapse.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), suggesting that viral infection did not cause discernable changes in TCR signaling. In comparison, T cells transduced with the miR-181a construct (miR-181a T cells) require only approximately two MCC peptides to reach the EC50 (Figures 1D and 1E), showing that miR-181a expression increases T cell sensitivity by more than 2-fold. Also notable is that signal output in miR-181a T cells is about 40% higher than that in control T cells, as indicated by the plateau calcium flux (Figure 1E). The effects of miR-181a may be understated in this measurement since MCC is a strong agonist and may allow little room for further improvement. Indeed, a more dramatic increase was observed when miR-181a T cells were challenged with a weak agonist, MCC 102S (Figure 1F). These observations demonstrate that miR-181a expression in mature T cells augments both the strength and sensitivity of TCR signaling to strong and weak agonists. In addition to these quantitative changes in T cell sensitivity, we also explored whether miR-181a could alter antigen discrimination and allow T cells to respond to antagonists. Under standard test conditions, when the antagonist MCC 99R is present in large excess to the agonist (Sumen et al., 2004Sumen C. Dustin M.L. Davis M.M. T cell receptor antagonism interferes with MHC clustering and integrin patterning during immunological synapse formation.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), TCR signaling is blocked in control T cells—where no calcium influx was detected (Figure 2A). Interestingly, under the same conditions, TCR signaling is not blocked in miR-181a T cells, demonstrating that miR-181a overrides TCR antagonism (Figure 2A; Movie S3). Since we have shown that miR-181a expression can augment the TCR response to agonists (Figure 1), it was possible that this reversal of antagonist function simply is the result of increased agonist responses beyond the ability of antagonist to block. However, when T cells were challenged with antagonist alone, we found that MCC 99R can stimulate a calcium response in miR-181a T cells, demonstrating that miR-181a expression enables T cells to recognize the normally inhibitory antagonist as an agonist (Figure 2B; Movie S4). MCC 99R stimulation resulted in a more than 2-fold increase of calcium in the peak response and sustained elevation for more than 10 min, indicating that the antagonist induces a full-scale response in these cells (Figure 2C). Furthermore, we examined whether MCC 99R can stimulate effector T cell function. In miR-181a T cells, MCC 99R is able to stimulate IL-2 production (Figure 2D) and T cell proliferation (Figure 2E), although somewhat more weakly than the responses generated by MCC in control cells. Moreover, this dramatic functional switch is not limited just to MCC 99R: similar results are seen with another antagonist, MCC 102G (Figures 2F and 6E). Taken together, these results show that ectopic miR-181a expression not only quantitatively enhances T cell signaling strength and TCR sensitivity to antigens but also leads to a qualitative switch and enables them to respond to antagonists. To understand how miR-181a influences T cell reactivity, we first examined whether miR-181a regulates the expression of 5C.C7 TCR or other surface molecules that are known to play important roles in TCR signaling. miR-181a expression does not change TCR density on the cell surface based on FACS analysis (Figure S4A). Furthermore, there is no discernable difference in surface CD4 levels (Figure S4A), thus eliminating the possibility that miR-181a augments T cell sensitivity by altering CD4 coreceptor expression (Irvine et al., 2002Irvine D.J. Purbhoo M.A. Krogsgaard M. Davis M.M. Direct observation of ligand recognition by T lymphocytes.Nature. 2002; 419: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, Li et al., 2004Li Q.J. Dinner A.R. Qi S. Irvine D.J. Huppa J.B. Davis M.M. Chakraborty A.K. CD4 enhances T cell sensitivity to antigen by coordinating Lck accumulation at the immunological synapse.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we did detect an increase in the costimulatory molecule CD28 and a decrease in its antagonistic partner CTLA-4 on miR-181a T cells (Figure S4B). Modulating the expression of costimulatory molecules by miR-181a seems to have a positive effect on TCR signal strength as indicated by sustained calcium flux (Figures S4C and S4D), which may have contributed to the plateau elevation observed in Figure 1E. However, miR-181a T cells can still respond to MCC 99R while costimulation is inhibited by antibody blockade of CD28 ligands (B7.1 and B7.2) on the APCs' surface, indicating that miR181a's effect on costimulation does not contribute to the conversion of antagonists to agonists (Figure S5; Movie S5). Thus, miR-181a is more likely to modulate TCR sensitivity to antigens by controlling the expression of intracellular signaling molecules. By challenging T cell clones bearing two distinct TCRs with their respective peptide agonist and antagonist, several studies have shown that antagonists elicit negative signals that can actively repress the agonist-induced responses from the other TCR (Dittel et al., 1999Dittel B.N. Stefanova I. Germain R.N. Janeway Jr., C.A. Cross-antagonism of a T cell clone expressing two distinct T cell receptors.Immunity. 1999; 11: 289-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 has been proposed to be the negative feedback regulator triggered by antagonists, and the activation of ERK kinases appears to override this suppression (Dittel et al., 1999Dittel B.N.

Modeling T cell antigen discrimination based on feedback control of digital ERK responses.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e356Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). However, our computational analysis does not shown any putative miR-181a binding sites in the SHP-1 mRNA. Furthermore, miR-181a expression in T cells does not alter SHP-1 protein (Figure 3B) or RNA level (Figure 3C). Thus, SHP-1 is not a direct target of miR-181a, suggesting that other components of the T cell signaling pathway may contribute to antagonism. Since a number of tyrosine and serine phosphatases besides SHP-1 have been implicated in the suppression of TCR signaling (Mustelin et al., 2005Mustelin T. Vang T. Bottini N. Protein tyrosine phosphatases and the immune response.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), we examined potential miR-181a target sites in the phosphatases that might be involved in TCR proximal signaling (nonreceptor type tyrosine phosphatases, PTPNs) or ERK dephosphorylation (dual specificity phosphatases, DUSPs). We searched for potential miR-181a pairing sites in functionally relevant candidate genes using an unpublished computer program (J.C. and C.-Z.C., unpublished data). In brief, candidate mRNA sequences are broken into 40 nt overlapping fragments, and their ability to pair with miR-181a is analyzed using the RNA folding program M-FOLD. Target sequences that form more stable pairing with self than with miR-181a are eliminated: in this way, our program takes into consideration the secondary structure of the target sites. Furthermore, single nucleotide mismatch and G:U base pairing in the seed region is tolerated, since these are features of many genetically validated target sites (Reinhart et al., 2000Reinhart B.J. Slack F.J. Basson M. Pasquinelli A.E. Bettinger J.C. Rougvie A.E. Horvitz H.R. Ruvkun G.

Hobert O. Perfect seed pairing is not a generally reliable predictor for miRNA-target interactions.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 849-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Both the coding regions and the untranslated regions (UTRs) of the candidate targets are analyzed. Using this program, we found that the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-2 and PTPN22 and the ERK-specific phosphatases DUSP5 and DUSP6 each contain multiple putative miR-181a pairing sites (Figure S6). Only DUSP6 was predicted as a miR-181a target by published computational methods (Krek et al., 2005Krek A. Grun D. Poy M.N. Wolf R. Rosenberg L. Epstein E.J. MacMenamin P. da Piedade I. Gunsalus K.C. Stoffel M. et al.Combinatorial microRNA target predictions.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3702) Google Scholar, Lewis et al., 2005Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Conserved seed pairing, often flanked by adenosines, indicates that thousands of human genes are microRNA targets.Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9265) Google Scholar). Those potential target sites with near-perfect seed pairing and/or the lowest calculated free energy of binding were selected for further validation using a luciferase reporter assay (Figure S6). Fusion luciferase reporters bearing predicted target sequences from SHP-2, PTPN22, DUSP5, or DUSP6, respectively, were specifically repressed by miR-181a, but not by an miR-181a mutant (Figure 3A) or miR-142 (data not shown). Furthermore, western blot revealed that SHP-2, PTPN22, DUSP5, and DUSP6 protein levels are quantitatively reduced by miR-181a, but not by an miR-181a mutant (Figure 3B). Finally, miR-181a can also reduce the mRNA levels of the target genes in T cells as indicated by qPCR analyses (Figure 3C). These results suggest that miR-181a may directly repress the expression of multiple phosphatases. Downregulation of these phosphatases by miR-181a is likely to systematically reduce negative feedback at distinct steps of TCR signaling. PTPN22, a potent negative regulator immediately downstream of TCR (Hasegawa et al., 2004Hasegawa K. Martin F. Huang G. Tumas D. Diehl L. Chan A.C. PEST domain-enriched tyrosine phosphatase (PEP) regulation of effector/memory T cells.Science. 2004; 303: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), can dephosphorylate Lck and ZAP70 at the activating Y394 and Y493 within the kinase activation loops (Wu et al., 2006Wu J. Katrekar A. Honigberg L.A. Smith A.M. Conn M.T. Tang J. Jeffery D. Mortara K. Sampang J. Williams S.R. et al.Identification of substrates of human protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPN22.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11002-11010Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A gain-of-function variant of PTPN22 has been shown to reduce T cell sensitivity (Vang et al., 2005Vang T. Congia M. Macis M.D. Musumeci L. Orru V. Zavattari P. Nika K. Tautz L. Tasken K. Cucca F. et al.Autoimmune-associated lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase is a gain-of-function variant.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1317-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Consistent with the role of PTPN22 as a negative regulator of Lck, we found an increase in Y394 phosphorylation of Lck in miR-181a T cells even before stimulation (Figure 4A). DUSP5 and DUSP6, which have different cellular localization, can specifically inactivate ERK1/2 by dephosphorylating the T202 and Y204 residues in the nucleus and cytosol, respectively (Theodosiou and Ashworth, 2002Theodosiou A. Ashworth A. MAP kinase phosphatases.Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (REVIEWS3009)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SHP-2 was found to mediate negative costimulatory signals elicited by CTLA-4 (Marengere et al., 1996Marengere L.E. Waterhouse P. Duncan G.S. Mittrucker H.W. Feng G.S. Mak T.W. Regulation of T cell receptor signaling by tyrosine phosphatase SYP association with CTLA-4.Science. 1996; 272: 1170-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), but it has not been shown to play any direct role in TCR proximal signaling (Salmond et al., 2005Salmond R.J. Huyer G. Kotsoni A. Clements L. Alexander D.R. The src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 regulates primary T-dependent immune responses and Th cell differentiation.J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 6498-6508PubMed Google Scholar). To examine how miR-181a may affect ERK1/2 activation, we measured ERK1/2 T202 and Y204 phosphorylation (ppERK) levels before and after antagonist stimulation using intracellular antibody staining and FACS analysis (Krutzik and Nolan, 2003Krutzik P.O.

MCC 99R can stimulate ERK phosphorylation in miR-181a T cells (Figure 4B) or in DP thymocytes, which have a naturally high level of miR-181a (Figure 7C), but not in control T cells (Figure 4B, orange lines). Furthermore, we examined whether miR-181a may alter the kinetics of ERK phosphorylation during T cell activation. T cells were activated by CD3ɛ crosslinking to avoid any contribution from costimulation. We noted that miR-181a T cells have a significantly higher basal level of ppERK before stimulation and a slightly higher peak level after stimulation (Figure 4C). While both the control and miR-181a T cells reached maximal levels within 15 min after stimulation, a delay in dephosphorylation was observed in miR-181a T cells. More importantly, ppERK in these cells returns to a higher basal level when compared to controls (Figure 4C, time points 15–60 min). These data demonstrate that ERK phosphorylation is shifted to a higher basal level both before and after stimulation, suggesting that miR-181a induces decreases in phosphatase expression and acts to shift the equilibrium to higher steady-state levels of ppERK. This increased basal level of ppERK may have additional effects in potentiating TCR proximal signaling as indicated by dramatic increases in serine phosphorylation of Lck in miR-181a T cells (Figure 4D). Restoring DUSP6 expression to a normal level by coexpressing miR-181a and a DUSP6 gene without the miR-181a target sites (Figure 6A) reduces basal Lck serine phosphorylation to the background level (Figure 4D), suggesting that the downregulation of DUSP6 is directly responsible for the increase in Lck serine"
https://openalex.org/W2029722028,"Insulator elements affect gene expression by preventing the spread of heterochromatin and restricting transcriptional enhancers from activation of unrelated promoters. In vertebrates, insulator's function requires association with the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a protein that recognizes long and diverse nucleotide sequences. While insulators are critical in gene regulation, only a few have been reported. Here, we describe 13,804 CTCF-binding sites in potential insulators of the human genome, discovered experimentally in primary human fibroblasts. Most of these sequences are located far from the transcriptional start sites, with their distribution strongly correlated with genes. The majority of them fit to a consensus motif highly conserved and suitable for predicting possible insulators driven by CTCF in other vertebrate genomes. In addition, CTCF localization is largely invariant across different cell types. Our results provide a resource for investigating insulator function and possible other general and evolutionarily conserved activities of CTCF sites.

Point mutations at the distinct DNA-recognition amino acid positions in ZF3 and ZF7 of CTCF have been identified in a variety of cancers selected for LOH at 16q22 where CTCF maps, suggesting its role as candidate tumor-suppressor gene (Filippova et al., 1998Filippova G.N.

However, others have found that it could also function as a transcriptional activator in a different sequence context (Vostrov and Quitschke, 1997Vostrov A.A. Quitschke W.W.

Chem. 1997; 272: 33353-33359Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified CTCF to be the vertebrate insulator protein (Bell et al., 1999Bell A.C. West A.G. Felsenfeld G. The protein CTCF is required for the enhancer blocking activity of vertebrate insulators.Cell. 1999; 98: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). So far, CTCF remains as the only major protein implicated in establishment of insulators in vertebrates (Felsenfeld et al., 2004Felsenfeld G. Burgess-Beusse B. Farrell C. Gaszner M. Ghirlando R.

There has been a great interest in identifying where potential insulators are located in the eukaryotic genome because knowledge of these elements can help understand how cis-regulatory elements coordinate expression of the target genes. Transcription of every eukaryotic gene begins with the assembly of an RNA polymerase preinitiation complex (PIC) at the promoter (Kadonaga, 2004Kadonaga J.T. Regulation of RNA polymerase II transcription by sequence-specific DNA binding factors.Cell. 2004; 116: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), a process that is regulated by sequence-specific transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements. Genetics studies in Drosophila first identified the importance of insulators in ensuring proper enhancer/promoter interactions (Udvardy et al., 1985Udvardy A. Maine E. Schedl P. The 87A7 chromomere. Identification of novel chromatin structures flanking the heat shock locus that may define the boundaries of higher order domains.J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 341-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). More recent studies have implicated insulators in the establishment of euchromatin/heterochromatin boundaries in vertebrates (Felsenfeld et al., 2004Felsenfeld G. Burgess-Beusse B. Farrell C. Gaszner M. Ghirlando R. Huang S. Jin C. Litt M. Magdinier F. Mutskov V. et al.Chromatin boundaries and chromatin domains.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant.

Pfeifer K. Shifting insulator boundaries.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 1036-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated that an insulator in the IGF2/H19 locus is critical for the imprinting of the locus (Bell and Felsenfeld, 2000Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Methylation of a CTCF-dependent boundary controls imprinted expression of the Igf2 gene.Nature. 2000; 405: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, Hark et al., 2000Hark A.T.

Biol. 2000; 10: 853-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The mechanism of insulator function remains unclear. One model proposes that insulators, by formation of special chromatin structures, compete for enhancer-bound activators, preventing the activation of downstream promoters (Bulger and Groudine, 1999Bulger M. Groudine M. Looping versus linking: toward a model for long-distance gene activation.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2465-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Alternatively, insulators may facilitate the formation of loops, for example, via attachment of chromosomal regions to the nuclear membrane (Yusufzai et al., 2004Yusufzai T.M. Tagami H. Nakatani Y. Felsenfeld G. CTCF tethers an insulator to subnuclear sites, suggesting shared insulator mechanisms across species.Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 291-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), keeping the intermediate regions exposed for only local interactions between enhancers and promoters. Consistent with this model, it was recently shown that CTCF could mediate long-range chromosomal interactions in mammalian cells, providing a possible mechanism by which insulators establish regulatory domains (Kurukuti et al., 2006Kurukuti S. Tiwari V.K. Tavoosidana G. Pugacheva E. Murrell A. Zhao Z.H. Lobanenkov V. Reik W. Ohlsson R.

Cell. 2004; 13: 291-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The extent at which each mechanism plays a role in shaping genome expression remains unresolved. Knowledge of insulators in the genome would provide a much-needed framework for understanding the genome organization and function. The effort to computationally identify potential insulators in the human genome has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of the DNA-recognition sequence of CTCF. Biochemical assays have indicated that the 11-ZF protein can use different combinations of the ZF domains to bind different DNA target sequences (Filippova et al., 1996Filippova G.N. Fagerlie S. Klenova E.M. Myers C. Dehner Y. Goodwin G. Neiman P.E. Collins S.J. Lobanenkov V.V. An exceptionally conserved transcriptional repressor, CTCF, employs different combinations of zinc fingers to bind diverged promoter sequences of avian and mammalian c-myc oncogenes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2802-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, Ohlsson et al., 2001Ohlsson R. Renkawitz R. Lobanenkov V. CTCF is a uniquely versatile transcription regulator linked to epigenetics and disease.Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 520-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Thus, the CTCF-binding sites identified from in vitro protein/DNA-interaction assays and a limited number of known insulators exhibit extensive sequence variation and lack specificity for genome-wide prediction of CTCF binding (Ohlsson et al., 2001Ohlsson R. Renkawitz R. Lobanenkov V. CTCF is a uniquely versatile transcription regulator linked to epigenetics and disease.Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 520-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Recently, an attempt has been made to systematically isolate insulators in the mouse genome through chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by cloning and sequencing (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2004Mukhopadhyay R. Yu W. Whitehead J. Xu J. Lezcano M. Pack S. Kanduri C. Kanduri M. Ginjala V. Vostrov A. et al.The binding sites for the chromatin insulator protein CTCF map to DNA methylation-free domains genome-wide.Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1594-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, due to a limited scale of the sequencing effort, only about 200 DNA fragments with the enhancer-blocking activity, each driven by various CTCF-binding sites, have been identified. However, no consensus of CTCF-binding motif has been so far reported from this study. As a first step toward understanding how insulators contribute to gene expression in human cells, we have located the sites of CTCF binding in the human genome using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by detection with genome-tiling microarrays (Kim et al., 2005bKim T.H. Barrera L.O. Zheng M. Qu C. Singer M.A. Richmond T.A. Wu Y. Green R.D. Ren B. A high-resolution map of active promoters in the human genome.Nature. 2005; 436: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, Kim and Ren, 2006Kim T.H. Ren B. Genome-wide analysis of protein-DNA interactions.Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2006; 7: 81-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Our analyses have generated a high-resolution genomic map of CTCF binding, with on average 2.5 genes bounded by a pair of CTCF-binding sites. We also identify a clear consensus of CTCF-binding motif shared by a majority of the experimentally determined in vivo CTCF-binding sites. We show that the sites of CTCF-binding sequences in the human genome are highly conserved in other vertebrates, consistent with the widespread and fundamental role of CTCF in cellular function. In addition, we demonstrate that CTCF binding to DNA is largely invariant from cell to cell, with a subset interacting with the protein in a cell-type-dependent manner. Our results offer a general resource for understanding the role of CTCF in insulator function, gene regulation, and genome organization in human cells. Previously, we developed an improved genome-wide location-analysis strategy to identify transcription-factor-binding sites throughout the genome in human cells (Kim et al., 2005bKim T.H. Barrera L.O. Zheng M. Qu C. Singer M.A. Richmond T.A. Wu Y. Green R.D. Ren B. A high-resolution map of active promoters in the human genome.Nature. 2005; 436: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). This method, also known as ChIP-chip, involved the immunoprecipitation of transcription-factor-bound DNA from formaldehyde-crosslinked cells, followed by detection with genome-tiling arrays. To identify CTCF-binding sites in the human genome, we performed the same analysis with monoclonal antibodies against CTCF and chromatin extract from the primary human fibroblast, IMR90, cells. The CTCF-bound DNA was identified using a series of 38 arrays containing a total of 14.6 million 50-mer oligonucleotides, evenly positioned every 100 base pairs (bp) along the nonrepeat sequence of the human genome. By applying a simple statistical filtering that requires the signals from four consecutive probes to be above a threshold (2.5 times the standard deviation of the average log ratios), we identified an initial list of 15,221 genomic regions bound by CTCF (Figures 1A and 1B). To verify the binding of CTCF to these putative CTCF-binding sequences, we designed a new oligonucelotide microarray representing these regions and the surrounding sequences at 100 bp resolution. Using this array, we performed ChIP-chip analysis against CTCF with an independent chromatin sample of IMR90 cells and confirmed its binding to 13,804 regions. To assess the accuracy of these in vivo CTCF-binding sites, we first randomly selected 84 (Table S1) and performed conventional ChIP assays. This analysis validated the binding of CTCF to 80 (95%) tested sites (Figure S2A) and suggested a high degree of specificity of our method. Next, we examined CTCF binding on 60 previously characterized CTCF-binding sites and insulators in the human genome and found that 32 (∼53%) were detected by our analysis (Table S2). To determine whether the failure to detect CTCF binding at the remaining 28 sites was due to a moderate sensitivity of our method, we performed conventional ChIP assays and detected binding of CTCF to four of these sites (Figure S2B; Table S3). Since these known CTCF-binding sites would be considered false negatives of our method, the sensitivity of our method was estimated to be about 88% (32 out of 36). Third, we examined a multiple species sequence alignment score (PhastCon) for each CTCF-binding site (Siepel et al., 2005Siepel A. Bejerano G. Pedersen J.S. Hinrichs A.S. Hou M. Rosenbloom K. Clawson H. Spieth J. Hillier L.W. Richards S. et al.Evolutionarily conserved elements in vertebrate, insect, worm, and yeast genomes.Genome Res. 2005; 15: 1034-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (2350) Google Scholar) to determine their sequence conservation. A significant fraction (55%, p < 2.2 × 10−16) of the CTCF-binding sites are conserved in vertebrates with a PhastCon score of 0.8 or higher (Figure S2C), suggesting that most CTCF-binding sites identified in our analysis are likely functional. To characterize how the CTCF-binding sites are distributed along the human genome, we compared their localization to a total of 20,181 well-annotated human genes (Kent et al., 2002Kent W.J. Sugnet C.W. Furey T.S. Roskin K.M. Pringle T.H. Zahler A.M. Haussler D. The human genome browser at UCSC.Genome Res. 2002; 12: 996-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (5930) Google Scholar). We performed correlation analysis of CTCF-binding sites with the number of genes or transcripts found on the chromosomes or with the total nucleotide length of each chromosome (Figures 1C, 1D, and S3A). As a control, we examined two enhancer-binding proteins whose genomic binding sites were recently determined in human cells: estrogen receptor (ER; Carroll et al., 2006Carroll J.S. Meyer C.A. Song J. Li W. Geistlinger T.R. Eeckhoute J. Brodsky A.S. Keeton E.K. Fertuck K.C. Hall G.F. et al.Genome-wide analysis of estrogen receptor binding sites.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar) and p53 (Wei et al., 2006Wei C.L. Wu Q. Vega V.B. Chiu K.P. Ng P. Zhang T. Shahab A. Yong H.C. Fu Y. Weng Z. et al.A global map of p53 transcription-factor binding sites in the human genome.Cell. 2006; 124: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar; Table S4). The results showed that CTCF binding correlates strongly with the number of genes on each chromosome (r2 = 0.85), and the degree of correlation is much higher than both ER and p53. In contrast, CTCF binding only weakly correlates with the chromosomal length (r2 = 0.42), and the degree of correlation is much less than that of the two transcription activator proteins (Carroll et al., 2006Carroll J.S. Meyer C.A. Song J. Li W. Geistlinger T.R. Eeckhoute J. Brodsky A.S. Keeton E.K. Fertuck K.C. Hall G.F. et al.Genome-wide analysis of estrogen receptor binding sites.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar; Figures 1C and 1D). Based on this analysis, we conclude that the distribution of CTCF-binding sites along the genome is closely correlated with genes and distinct from other known sequence-specific transcription factors. An independent analysis of CTCF localization along each chromosome also confirmed a strong correlation between CTCF binding and gene density. We segmented each chromosome with a sliding 2 Mbp window and calculated the correlation between numbers of CTCF-binding sites and genes within each window. In general, the CTCF-binding sites correlate strongly with genes, with a correlation coefficient of 0.786. In contrast, the average correlation coefficient between randomly generated genomic sites and genes is only 0.32 (Figure 2A). The degree of correlation between the CTCF-binding sites and genes is similar to that between the TAF1-binding sites, mapped previously in the same cells, and genes (correlation coefficient of 0.792). This analysis indicates that CTCF binding is highly restricted to genes, displaying the same property as a general transcription factor. This property of CTCF distribution is consistent with its role at insulators and suggests a widespread function of CTCF in the genome. While the distribution of CTCF-binding sites resembles that of a general transcription factor such as TAF1, there are important differences between the two. The majority of TAF1-binding sites (89%) are within close proximity to the known 5′ ends of transcripts; in contrast, CTCF-binding sites are generally very far from promoters, with an average distance of 48,000 bp (Figure 2B). Nearly half (46%) of the CTCF-binding sites are located in the intergenic regions, consistent with their potential role as insulators. Only about 20% CTCF sites are near transcription start sites. Unexpectedly, a significant number of CTCF-binding sites fall within genes, with 22% in the introns and 12% in the exons (Figure 2C). There is no marked enrichment of CTCF-binding sites near the polyadenylation sites (Figure S3B). To a large extent the binding of CTCF near promoters is negatively correlated with gene activity, as most of these promoters (72%) are not occupied by the general transcription factor TAF1. This observation is consistent with the possibility that CTCF might function as a repressor at these promoters. The significance of CTCF binding within the introns and exons is not clear, but presumably it might be related to its insulator function of blocking enhancers and silencers that are present nearby these sequences. Combined together, these results demonstrate that CTCF-binding sites are ubiquitous throughout the genome and display unique distribution that is distinct from enhancers and promoters. While CTCF-binding sites are generally correlated with genes along the entire length of chromosomes, there are isolated regions that deviate from this trend (Figure 2A). Two notable types of loci can be defined: one type of loci is characterized by a relative depletion of CTCF-binding sites and the other by an enrichment of CTCF-binding sites. We can define CTCF-depleted loci as those 2 Mbp windows that exhibit a lower-than-average density of CTCF-binding sites (less than 2 per 2 Mbp, p < 0.05 for most chromosomes; Table S5). Likewise, we can define CTCF-enriched loci as those 2 Mbp windows that exhibit higher-than-average CTCF-site density (p < 0.001; Table S6). We observe that the CTCF-depleted domains tend to include clusters of related gene families and genes that are transcriptionally coregulated, while CTCF-enriched domains often have multiple alternative promoters (81% contain two or more alternative promoters). Both cases are consistent with the assumption of CTCF-binding sites acting as insulators. We have characterized these two types of regions further by considering only genes with multiple CTCF-binding sites or clusters of genes with no CTCF-binding sites. We have defined 13,766 genomic regions that are flanked by a pair of consecutive CTCF-binding sites along the genome and named them CTCF-pair-defined domains (CPD). About 43% (5969) of CPDs contain at least one gene locus in its entirety, while the remaining CPDs do not contain a complete gene. About 74% of all genes in the genome are surrounded in their entirety by the CTCF-binding sites. The remaining genes are either telomeric to CTCF-binding site (2.6% of genes) or contain internal CTCF-binding sites (23% of genes). On average, about 2.5 genes are found in a CPD. The average size of a CPD is 212,090 bp. A significant number of them (189 CPDs, p < 0.001) contain 9 or more genes, with the largest one containing as many as 56 genes (p = 3.42 × 10−56). Table 1A lists all CPDs with 15 or more genes (p = 2.2 × 10−8). These CPDs often correspond to large clusters of related genes (Sproul et al., 2005Sproul D. Gilbert N. Bickmore W.A.

https://openalex.org/W2039640090,"Platelets are anuclear cytoplasmic fragments essential for blood clotting and wound healing. Despite much speculation, the factors determining their life span in the circulation are unknown. We show here that an intrinsic program for apoptosis controls platelet survival and dictates their life span. Pro-survival Bcl-x(L) constrains the pro-apoptotic activity of Bak to maintain platelet survival, but as Bcl-x(L) degrades, aged platelets are primed for cell death. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inactivation of Bcl-x(L) reduces platelet half-life and causes thrombocytopenia in a dose-dependent manner. Deletion of Bak corrects these defects, and platelets from Bak-deficient mice live longer than normal. Thus, platelets are, by default, genetically programmed to die by apoptosis. The antagonistic balance between Bcl-x(L) and Bak constitutes a molecular clock that determines platelet life span: this represents an important paradigm for cellular homeostasis, and has profound implications for the diagnosis and treatment of disorders that affect platelet number and function."
https://openalex.org/W1993764727,"Treatment with ex vivo–generated regulatory T cells (T-reg) has been regarded as a potentially attractive therapeutic approach for autoimmune diseases. However, the dynamics and function of T-reg in autoimmunity are not well understood. Thus, we developed Foxp3gfp knock-in (Foxp3gfp.KI) mice and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)35–55/IAb (MHC class II) tetramers to track autoantigen-specific effector T cells (T-eff) and T-reg in vivo during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis. MOG tetramer–reactive, Foxp3+ T-reg expanded in the peripheral lymphoid compartment and readily accumulated in the central nervous system (CNS), but did not prevent the onset of disease. Foxp3+ T cells isolated from the CNS were effective in suppressing naive MOG-specific T cells, but failed to control CNS-derived encephalitogenic T-eff that secreted interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Our data suggest that in order for CD4+Foxp3+ T-reg to effectively control autoimmune reactions in the target organ, it may also be necessary to control tissue inflammation."

We find (1) PN inputs to the MB are stereotyped as previously shown for the LH; (2) PN partners of ORNs from different sensillar groups are clustered in the LH; (3) fruit odors are represented mostly in the posterior-dorsal LH, whereas candidate pheromone-responsive PNs project to the anterior-ventral LH; (4) dendrites of single LH neurons each overlap with specific subsets of PN axons.

https://openalex.org/W2010763857,"AU-rich elements (AREs), present in mRNA 3′-UTRs, are potent posttranscriptional regulatory signals that can rapidly effect changes in mRNA stability and translation, thereby dramatically altering gene expression with clinical and developmental consequences. In human cell lines, the TNFα ARE enhances translation relative to mRNA levels upon serum starvation, which induces cell-cycle arrest. An in vivo crosslinking-coupled affinity purification method was developed to isolate ARE-associated complexes from activated versus basal translation conditions. We surprisingly found two microRNP-related proteins, fragile-X-mental-retardation-related protein 1 (FXR1) and Argonaute 2 (AGO2), that associate with the ARE exclusively during translation activation. Through tethering and shRNA-knockdown experiments, we provide direct evidence for the translation activation function of both FXR1 and AGO2 and demonstrate their interdependence for upregulation. This novel cell-growth-dependent translation activation role for FXR1 and AGO2 allows new insights into ARE-mediated signaling and connects two important posttranscriptional regulatory systems in an unexpected way."

However, it remains unclear how these elements combine to control cellular behavior. We analyzed the probabilistic and transient differentiation of Bacillus subtilis cells into the state of competence. A few key parameters independently tuned the frequency of initiation and the duration of competence episodes and allowed the circuit to access different dynamic regimes, including oscillation. Altering circuit architecture showed that the duration of competence events can be made more precise. We used an experimental method to reduce global cellular noise and showed that noise levels are correlated with frequency of differentiation events. Together, the data reveal a noise-dependent circuit that is remarkably resilient and tunable in terms of its dynamic behavior."

Although these tail-anchored (TA) proteins serve numerous essential roles in cells, components of their targeting and insertion pathways have long remained elusive. Here we reveal a cytosolic TMD recognition complex (TRC) that targets TA proteins for insertion into the ER membrane. The highly conserved, 40 kDa ATPase subunit of TRC (which we termed TRC40) was identified as Asna-1. TRC40/Asna-1 interacts posttranslationally with TA proteins in a TMD-dependent manner for delivery to a proteinaceous receptor at the ER membrane. Subsequent release from TRC40/Asna-1 and insertion into the membrane depends on ATP hydrolysis. Consequently, an ATPase-deficient mutant of TRC40/Asna-1 dominantly inhibited TA protein insertion selectively without influencing other translocation pathways. Thus, TRC40/Asna-1 represents an integral component of a posttranslational pathway of membrane protein insertion whose targeting is mediated by TRC.

A fundamental problem in biology is the insertion of proteins into biological membranes. This problem is further complicated in eukaryotic cells by an extensive array of intracellular organelles that necessitates highly selective targeting to one among many membrane systems. For membrane protein biogenesis at the ER, the most well-studied mechanism is a cotranslational insertion pathway mediated by the cytosolic signal recognition particle (SRP), the ER-localized SRP receptor (SR), and an ER protein translocon whose central channel is formed by the Sec61 complex (Shan and Walter, 2005Shan S.O.

These basic components are highly conserved from bacterial to mammalian systems and are demonstrated to play an essential role in the biosynthesis of a wide range of membrane proteins. Although ubiquitous, this cotranslational SRP-dependent pathway is inaccessible to a large class of membrane proteins whose only targeting information is encoded in a single transmembrane domain (TMD) close to the C terminus (Kutay et al., 1993Kutay U.

Tail-anchored protein biosynthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum: the same but different.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These tail-anchored (TA) proteins are released from the ribosome before the TMD emerges from the ribosomal tunnel (which shields ∼30–40 residues), precluding cotranslational targeting and translocation. TA proteins are surprisingly abundant in various membrane systems of the eukaryotic cell and play critical roles in nearly all aspects of cell biology (Borgese et al., 2003Borgese N. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. The tale of tail-anchored proteins: coming from the cytosol and looking for a membrane.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Notable examples include the SNAREs involved in vesicular trafficking, several components of translocons in various organelles, components of membrane-bound degradation machinery, structural proteins for Golgi morphology, and numerous enzymes whose activities are spatially restricted in the cell. Despite this broad functional importance of TA proteins, the pathways by which they are targeted to or inserted into the ER membrane remain very poorly understood. With some exceptions (such as cytochrome b5 [Cb5]), most ER-targeted TA proteins are thought to be inserted via an energy-dependent process that involves at least one proteinaceous component of the ER. Early reconstitution studies suggested convincingly that components of the ER other than the minimal cotranslational machinery (SR, Sec61, and translocating chain-associating membrane protein [TRAM]) were necessary for insertion of the model TA protein synaptobrevin (Kutay et al., 1995Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A.

Since that time, a variety of studies have confirmed an ATP requirement for several other TA proteins, provided further support for yet unidentified membrane factors, and characterized some of the sequence requirements for TMD insertion (Kutay et al., 1995Kutay U.

While recent crosslinking analyses were used to suggest interactions between TA proteins and components of the SRP and Sec61 pathways (Abell et al., 2003Abell B.M. Jung M. Oliver J.D. Knight B.C.

Signal recognition particle mediates post-translational targeting in eukaryotes.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2755-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the functional relevance of these observations remains largely uncertain and in contradiction to previous studies arguing against a role for these components (e.g., Kutay et al., 1995Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. Transport route for synaptobrevin via a novel pathway of insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Thus, the main consensus from the sum of the available studies is that components in the cytosol and membrane, at least one of which may be dependent on ATP, are involved in insertion. However, the identity of the ATP-requiring component(s), the membrane receptor(s), and their mechanisms of action have long remained elusive. Clarification of these issues will require identification of components in the pathway of insertion. A major obstacle to achieving this goal has been the heterogeneity of insertion assays that rely on measuring membrane binding of TA proteins. A binding assay can contribute significant background noise by not reliably distinguishing a physiologically relevant membrane-spanning orientation from other modes of membrane association, insertion, or aggregation. Hence, the small dynamic range, low throughput, and low sensitivity of this assay have precluded significant attempts at identification of components involved in either targeting or insertion. Recently, this obstacle was overcome by a protease protection assay that not only showed high sensitivity and specificity, but could be employed in combination with fractionation of the lysate components (Brambillasca et al., 2005Brambillasca S. Yabal M. Soffientini P. Stefanovic S. Makarow M. Hegde R.S. Borgese N. Transmembrane topogenesis of a tail-anchored protein is modulated by membrane lipid composition.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2533-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This approach greatly facilitated a detailed analysis of Cb5 insertion by the spontaneous pathway (defined here as not requiring any protein factors in the membrane). This study revealed a previously unappreciated ER dependence on lipid composition for insertion of Cb5. Exploiting this advance in methodology, we have now dissected the more broadly utilized, but poorly understood, nonspontaneous TA insertion pathway to identify a key cytosolic component of a TMD recognition complex (TRC) that functions in posttranslational membrane protein targeting. Our results delineate the principal steps in posttranslational membrane protein insertion, allow us to propose a working mechanistic framework for this ubiquitous and physiologically important pathway, and explain how the TRC- and SRP-dependent pathways operate in parallel without cross-interference. The requirements for transmembrane insertion of a model TA protein were analyzed in vitro. The ER translocon component Sec61β was chosen because it is unambiguously inserted solely into the ER, is not trafficked elsewhere, is definitively confirmed to fully span the membrane (as opposed to a hairpin topology), and is highly conserved and universally expressed (Hartmann et al., 1994Hartmann E. Sommer T. Prehn S. Gorlich D. Jentsch S. Rapoport T.A.

Hence, Sec61β insertion almost certainly utilizes a general and widely applicable ER-selective pathway whose components are likely to be found in all cells, making its analysis in heterologous in vitro systems physiologically relevant. Using a recently developed protease protection assay (see Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data), an epitope-tagged Sec61β (referred to hereafter as just Sec61β; see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data) synthesized in a reticulocyte lysate was found to insert posttranslationally into ER-derived rough microsomes (RMs). Correct transmembrane orientation was verified by recovery of a protease protected fragment (PF) representing the epitope-tagged transmembrane segment (Figures 1A and 1B). The PF was not observed when RMs were omitted, if detergent was included in the protease digestion reaction, or if the TMD was deleted from Sec61β (Figures 1A and 1B; Figures S1B and S1C). The choice of epitope tag did not influence the insertion (Figure S1C), and the PF was confirmed in sedimentation assays to cofractionate with RMs (data not shown). Quantitation by phosphorimaging (after accounting for methionine distribution) showed better than 50% absolute insertion efficiency. Using the generation of PF as a diagnostic marker for correct transmembrane orientation, Sec61β insertion was shown to occur at temperatures above 24°C, was complete within 15 min at 32°C, and was stimulated significantly by an energy regenerating system (Figures 1B and 1C). Using a panel of previously characterized fractionated proteoliposomes and liposomes (see Table S2), we analyzed the membrane requirements for Sec61β insertion. These experiments showed that Sec61β inserts efficiently into proteoliposomes reconstituted from total ER membrane proteins (rRM), but not liposomes (Figure 1D; Figures S1C–S1E) or protease-digested proteoliposomes (Figure 1E). This contrasted with Cb5, whose spontaneous transmembrane insertion into liposomes (or protease-digested proteoliposomes) appears to occur by a pathway not available to Sec61β (Figures 1D and 1E, and Figures S1D and S1E; Brambillasca et al., 2005Brambillasca S. Yabal M. Soffientini P. Stefanovic S. Makarow M. Hegde R.S. Borgese N. Transmembrane topogenesis of a tail-anchored protein is modulated by membrane lipid composition.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2533-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Analyses in various fractionated proteoliposomes (Figure 1F; Table S2) suggested that depletion of known translocon components by ∼95% or more was without effect on Sec61β insertion. These depletions included the Sec61 complex, TRAM, the TRAP complex, Sec62, Sec63, oligosaccharyl transferase, and signal peptidase complex. Conversely, proteoliposomes containing only the SR and Sec61 complex failed to support Sec61β insertion even though they were competent for cotranslational translocation of Prl and posttranslational insertion of Cb5 (Figure 1D). Furthermore, modification of free cysteines on the ER membrane (which inhibits cotranslational translocation by modification of the SR; Andrews et al., 1989Andrews D.W. Lauffer L. Walter P. Lingappa V.R. Evidence for a two-step mechanism involved in assembly of functional signal recognition particle receptor.J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 797-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) had no effect on Sec61β insertion (Figure 1G) despite complete blockage of cotranslational translocation (Figure 1H). Considered together, these findings demonstrate that like synaptobrevin (Kutay et al., 1995Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. Transport route for synaptobrevin via a novel pathway of insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), insertion of Sec61β occurs by an energy-stimulated, protein-dependent, posttranslational mechanism that appears to be distinct from the known cotranslational or spontaneous insertion pathways. To find potential components involved in TA protein insertion, we took an unbiased approach utilizing a combination of fractionation, crosslinking, and functional insertion analyses. We reasoned that during targeting, TA protein substrates are likely to engage a targeting complex that, at the very least, prevents exposure of the hydrophobic TMD to the aqueous environment. Indeed, sucrose velocity gradient analyses (Figure 2A) of in-vitro-synthesized Sec61β at a step prior to the addition of RMs showed it to be in very heterogeneous complexes ranging from ∼4 S to 11 S (roughly ∼100 to more than 500 kDa). Formation of these complexes was dependent on the TMD, but was not influenced by the presence or placement of epitope tags (Figure S2A and data not shown). Analysis of each fraction by chemical crosslinking revealed a variety of crosslinking partners, the most prominent of which was an ∼40 kDa protein found largely in fractions 4 through 7 (Figure 2B). These crosslinks were observed with various concentrations of both lysine- and cysteine-reactive crosslinkers, not seen with Sec61β lacking the TMD, and not influenced by the choice or location of epitope tags (Figures S2B and S2C). Importantly, the peak fractions containing this crosslink were clearly separated from peak fractions containing SRP (in which crosslinks to SRP54 were not detectable; Figure S2D). The interaction with p40 was highly sensitive to detergent (Figure S2E), but relatively stable in the presence of elevated salt (to ∼250 mM; data not shown), suggesting predominantly hydrophobic-based interactions consistent with involvement of the substrate's TMD. The peak p40-containing fraction displayed noticeably higher efficiency of insertion when compared with the peak SRP-containing fraction (Figure 2C), suggesting the possibility that the p40-Sec61β complex is an insertion-competent intermediate. To test this idea, we performed crosslinking analyses before and immediately after incubation with membrane vesicles. We reasoned that a bona fide intermediate complex would disassemble concomitant with insertion, whereas off-pathway complexes would be maintained as a noninserted population (Figure 2D). Crosslinks between Sec61β and p40 disappeared concomitant with membrane insertion into either RM or rRM, but not after incubation with insertion-incompetent liposomes (Figures 2E and 2F). Other crosslinks were observed to remain unchanged regardless of membrane incubations (Figure S2F), suggesting that these (relatively minor) interactions represent populations of Sec61β that are not on the productive insertion pathway. Based on the TMD-dependent interaction with Sec61β at a step before (but not after) insertion, we hypothesized that p40 may represent a component of a TA protein-targeting machinery that we have termed TRC. This 40 kDa component, which will be the focus of the remainder of this study, will subsequently be called TRC40. To identify TRC40, we affinity-purified the in-vitro-generated Sec61β-TRC complex (Figure 3A) using anti-peptide antibodies directed against the extreme N terminus of Sec61β under conditions predetermined to preserve integrity of the complex. Upon peptide-elution under physiologic conditions, the recovered material was confirmed by sucrose gradient analyses (Figure 3B) to still be in similarly sized complexes as before, to display similar crosslinking patterns (data not shown), and importantly, to insert into RM in an energy-stimulated manner (data not shown; cf. Figure 1C). Comparison of the affinity-purified complex to a parallel sample using Sec61β lacking the TMD revealed a TMD-specific ∼40 kDa band by silver staining (Figure 3C). Large-scale translations were subjected to the same procedure and the ∼40 kDa product (recovered in a roughly 1:1 stoichiometry with Sec61β; Figure 3C) was identified by mass spectrometry of the tryptic digests. Seven independent peptide fragments matched the predicted sequence for a 348 amino acid protein that contains a highly conserved N-terminal ATPase domain and a C-terminal region containing a conserved hydrophobic patch (Figure 3D; Figures S3A and S3B). This protein was originally annotated Asna-1 in mammals due to ∼27% homology to a bacterial ATPase (ArsA) involved in arsenite transport (Kurdi-Haidar et al., 1996Kurdi-Haidar B. Aebi S. Heath D. Enns R.E. Naredi P. Hom D.K. Howell S.B. Isolation of the ATP-binding human homolog of the arsA component of the bacterial arsenite transporter.Genomics. 1996; 36: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).

Although knockout of Asna-1 in mice results in early embryonic lethality (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2006Mukhopadhyay R. Ho Y.S. Swiatek P.J. Rosen B.P. Bhattacharjee H.

Based on our functional results below, we propose the name TRC40 for this protein. Two synthetic peptides from the predicted sequence of TRC40 were used to raise antibodies that confirmed the specific presence of TRC40 in the affinity-purified Sec61β-TRC complex (Figure 3E). Of particular importance, TRC40 was not observed in parallel samples using Sec61β lacking the TMD. Neither Hsp70 nor SRP54 were found in appreciable quantities in the Sec61β-TRC complex (Figure 3E and Figure S3C; see Supplemental Data). Furthermore, both the N- and C-terminal anti-TRC40 antibodies could specifically immunoprecipitate the Sec61β-TRC40 crosslink, while neither nonspecific antibodies nor the preimmune sera was able to do so (Figure 4A; data not shown). Finally, immunoblotting revealed that TRC40 migrates in the position of the sucrose gradient in which the 40 kDa crosslinks were most prominently observed (Figure 3F; compare with Figure 2B). Thus, the identified TRC40 protein is indeed the prominent 40 kDa crosslinking partner of TA proteins observed in Figure 2. As expected for a component of a general TA protein targeting complex, TRC40 is highly conserved in all eukaryotes (Figure S3A; comparable to the level of Sec61α conservation) and appears to be expressed universally in all tissues and cultured cell lines examined so far (Figure 3G). Our conservative estimate for the abundance of TRC40 in reticulocyte lysate is at least ∼20–50 nM, several-fold higher than the estimated abundance of cytosolic SRP (∼5–10 nM). Because the migration of TRC40 in the sucrose gradient was unchanged in the presence or absence of Sec61β, its assembly into the larger TRC would seem to not be induced by a TA substrate. This supposition was supported by specific crosslinks between TRC40 and several other reticulocyte lysate proteins that were maintained through various fractionation procedures (Figures S3D and S3E). While the identification of the additional component or components await complete purification of native TRC, these results allow us to conclude that TRC40 is one component of a larger preassembled complex that interacts with Sec61β in a TMD-dependent manner prior to its insertion into the ER membrane. Several TA and non-TA proteins were analyzed by crosslinking and immunoprecipitation for their interaction with TRC40 (summarized in Figure 4G). This analysis revealed that deletion of the TMD from Sec61β completely abolished any detectable interaction with TRC40 (Figure 4A), while other TA proteins that are inserted by a nonspontaneous posttranslational pathway (Figure S4A) were readily crosslinked to TRC40 (Figure S5 and data not shown). By contrast, interaction of TRC40 with the spontaneously inserting Cb5 was markedly reduced relative to Sec61β (Figure 4B). Importantly, no interactions could be detected with the cotranslational translocation substrates Prolactin (Prl) or the prion protein (PrP) despite the fact that these proteins contain hydrophobic domains (Figure S5). Both contain an N-terminal signal sequence, and PrP additionally contains an internal (potential) membrane spanning domain and C-terminal hydrophobic domain used for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor addition. Thus, even though Prl, PrP, and Cb5 are observed by sucrose gradient analyses to be in high molecular weight complexes in the cytosol (data not shown), these complexes do not seem to include TRC40 as a principal interacting component. This suggested that TRC40-substrate interactions are more selective than simple hydrophobicity, and pointed to a context-dependent TMD-mediated interaction. To test this idea directly, we examined TRC40 interactions with Sec61β constructs appended with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) at either the N or C terminus (termed CFP-Sec61β and Sec61β-CFP, respectively). Although both constructs are inserted into the ER membrane, Sec61β-CFP is strictly cotranslational, while CFP-Sec61β is inserted posttranslationally (Figure S4B). Remarkably, TRC40 crosslinks were selectively observed with CFP-Sec61β (Figure 4C), even though both constructs contain identical sequence elements, including the TMD. Thus, TRC40 displays selectivity not only for certain TMDs, but also for the context in which these TMDs are found. However, the contextual cue or cues appear to be more complex than simply a TMD at the C terminus. This became evident when we analyzed a member of the syntaxin family (most of which are TA proteins) from Neurospora crassa (Nsyn1) that had evolved an unusually long 154 residue C-terminal tail (Gupta et al., 2003Gupta G.D. Free S.J. Levina N.N. Keranen S. Heath I.B. Two divergent plasma membrane syntaxin-like SNAREs, nsyn1 and nsyn2, contribute to hyphal tip growth and other developmental processes in Neurospora crassa.Fungal Genet. Biol. 2003; 40: 271-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Nsyn1 constructs containing tails ranging from 3 to 154 residues (termed Nsyn-3 through Nsyn-154) all showed essentially identical crosslinking efficiency to TRC40 (Figure 4D). While this would seem to be at odds with the Sec61β-CFP result above, it could be explained by our observation that Nsyn-108 and Nsyn-154 are capable of posttranslational insertion despite their unusually long tails (Figure S4C). When considered together, these findings reveal a striking relationship between a substrate's interaction with TRC40 and its ability to be integrated into the ER by the nonspontaneous posttranslational membrane protein insertion pathway. We therefore suggest that TRC40 has a context-dependent specificity for TMDs in membrane proteins that utilize this posttranslational pathway of insertion. While this pathway is most widely used by TA proteins that cannot access the cotranslational insertion pathway, it seems that at least some substrates that ordinarily would use the SRP pathway (e.g., Nsyn1, which is not formally a TA protein) can also take advantage of the TRC pathway under some circumstances. The ability of TRC40 to interact with a substrate (Nsyn1) containing an internal TMD raised the issue of precisely when and where TRC40 first engages substrate relative to the other principal TMD recognition factor, SRP. Since the TMD of Nsyn1 would emerge from the ribosome long before reaching its termination codon, it is feasible in this instance for TRC40 to bind the nascent (i.e., ribosome-associated) polypeptide. Even for a C-terminal TMD, binding might occur as it emerges from the ribosomal exit tunnel (e.g., if TRC were positioned there) to prevent exposure of the TMD to the aqueous cytosolic environment. To examine these ideas, we first examined the localization of TRC40 in reticulocyte lysate. Unlike either SRP or Hsp70 (both of which are known nascent chain binding"

Its ubiquitous presence is thought to prevent ""soft"" tissues from mineralizing, whereas its degradation to P<sub>i</sub> in bones and teeth by tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (Tnap, Tnsalp, Alpl, Akp2) may facilitate crystal growth. Whereas the crystal binding properties of PP<sub>i</sub> are largely understood, less is known about its effects on osteoblast activity. We have used MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cultures to investigate the effect of PP<sub>i</sub> on osteoblast function and matrix mineralization. Mineralization in the cultures was dose-dependently inhibited by PP<sub>i</sub>. This inhibition could be reversed by Tnap, but not if PP<sub>i</sub> was bound to mineral. PP<sub>i</sub> also led to increased levels of osteopontin (Opn) induced via the Erk1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Opn regulation by PP<sub>i</sub> was also insensitive to foscarnet (an inhibitor of phosphate uptake) and levamisole (an inhibitor of Tnap enzymatic activity), suggesting that increased Opn levels did not result from changes in phosphate. Exogenous OPN inhibited mineralization, but dephosphorylation by Tnap reversed this effect, suggesting that OPN inhibits mineralization via its negatively charged phosphate residues and that like PP<sub>i</sub>, hydrolysis by Tnap reduces its mineral inhibiting potency. Using enzyme kinetic studies, we have shown that PP<sub>i</sub> inhibits Tnap-mediated P<sub>i</sub> release from β-glycerophosphate (a commonly used source of organic phosphate for culture mineralization studies) through a mixed type of inhibition. In summary, PP<sub>i</sub> prevents mineralization in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cultures by at least three different mechanisms that include direct binding to growing crystals, induction of Opn expression, and inhibition of Tnap activity."
https://openalex.org/W2020602591,"In addition to their role in controlling water and salt homeostasis, recent work suggests that aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) may be involved in adipocyte biology. This is of particular relevance given the role of MR as a high-affinity receptor for both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. We have thus examined the effect of aldosterone and MR on white adipose cell differentiation. When cells are cultured in a steroid-free medium, aldosterone promotes acquisition of the adipose phenotype of 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A cells in a time-, dose-, and MR-dependent manner. In contrast, late and long-term exposure to dexamethasone inhibits adipocyte terminal maturation. The aldosterone effect on adipose maturation was accompanied by induction of PPARgamma mRNA expression, which was blocked by the MR antagonist spironolactone. Under permissive culture conditions, specific MR down-regulation by siRNAs markedly inhibited 3T3-L1 differentiation by interfering with the transcriptional control of adipogenesis, an effect not mimicked by specific inactivation of the glucocorticoid receptor. These results demonstrate that MR represents an important proadipogenic transcription factor that may mediate both aldosterone and glucocorticoid effects on adipose tissue development. MR thus may be of pathophysiological relevance to the development of obesity and the metabolic syndrome."

https://openalex.org/W2059345773,"The mitotic regulators Wee1 and Cdk1 can inactivate each other through inhibitory phosphorylations. This double-negative feedback loop is part of a bistable trigger that makes the transition into mitosis abrupt and decisive. To generate a bistable response, some component of a double-negative feedback loop must exhibit an ultrasensitive response to its upstream regulator. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that Wee1 exhibits a highly ultrasensitive response to Cdk1. Several mechanisms can, in principle, give rise to ultrasensitivity, including zero-order effects, multisite phosphorylation, and competition mechanisms. We found that the ultrasensitivity in the inactivation of Wee1 arises mainly through two competition mechanisms: competition between two sets of phosphorylation sites in Wee1 and between Wee1 and other high-affinity Cdk1 targets. Based on these findings, we were able to reconstitute a highly ultrasensitive Wee1 response with purified components. Competition provides a simple way of generating the equivalent of a highly cooperative allosteric response."

Behavioral tests demonstrated that heterozygous females, whose retinas contained both native mouse pigments and human L pigment, showed enhanced long-wavelength sensitivity and acquired a new capacity for chromatic discrimination. An inherent plasticity in the mammalian visual system thus permits the emergence of a new dimension of sensory experience based solely on gene-driven changes in receptor organization."
https://openalex.org/W2073771628,"Opiates are analgesics of choice in the treatment of chronic pain, but their long-term use leads to the development of physiological tolerance. Thus, understanding the mechanisms modulating the response of their receptor, the mu opioid receptor (muOR), is of great clinical relevance. Here we show that heterodimerization of muOR with delta opioid receptors (deltaOR) leads to a constitutive recruitment of beta-arrestin2 to the receptor complex resulting in changes in the spatio-temporal regulation of ERK1/2 signaling. The involvement of beta-arrestin2 is further supported by studies using beta-arrestin2 siRNA in cells endogenously expressing the heterodimers. The association of beta-arrestin2 with the heterodimer can be altered by treatment with a combination of muOR agonist (DAMGO) and deltaOR antagonist (Tipp(psi)), and this leads to a shift in the pattern of ERK1/2 phosphorylation to the pattern observed with muOR alone. These data indicate that, in the naive state, muOR-deltaOR heterodimers are in a conformation conducive to beta-arrestin-mediated signaling. Destabilization of this conformation by cotreatment with muOR and deltaOR ligands leads to a switch to a non-beta-arrestin-mediated signaling. Taken together, these results show for the first time that muOR-deltaOR heterodimers, by differentially recruiting beta-arrestin, modulate the spatio-temporal dynamics of opioid receptor signaling."

We found that Kenyon cell (KC) dendrites are segregated into 17 complementary domains according to their neuroblast clonal origins and birth orders. Aligning the PN axonal map with the KC dendritic map and ultrastructural observation suggest a positional ordering such that inputs from the different AL glomeruli have distinct representations in the MB calyx, and these representations might synapse on functionally distinct KCs.

Many studies have isolated and investigated lectins from a wide range of species including plants, animals and microorganisms. The cell surfaces of organisms are covered with abundant and diverse carbohydrates. Because of structural diversity, the set of carbohydrates that is expressed on a cell surface has a role in various biological recognition phenomena, including cell-cell interactions, cell-substratum interactions, and metastasis of tumor cells, among others (1Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, some lectins have particular value as specific probes for investigating the distribution, structure and biological function of carbohydrate chains on the cell surface of animal, plant, and microorganism because of their specificity for defined carbohydrate structures (2Vijayan M. Chandra N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). α-l-Fucopyranosyl residues are widely distributed in cell-surface sugar chains and often play important roles in biological phenomena. These residues constitute a part of important antigens, such as the blood group antigen H (3Pereira M.E.A. Kabat E.A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3184-3192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and stage-specific embryonic antigens (4Stelck S. Robitzki A. Willbold E. Layer P.G. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased levels of fucosyl residues and changes in fucosylation patterns, as a result of different expression levels of various fucosyltransferases, act as specific markers for developmental antigens, particularly in inflammatory processes and in various cancers (5Kolanus W.

Another lectin that recognizes oligosaccharides containing core fucose would be a valuable tool in glycobiological research because only a few lectins have been identified as specific for core fucose, and AAL itself exhibits broad specificity for α1,2-, α1,3-, and α1,4-fucose-containing oligosaccharides (17Wimmerova M.

We previously identified a novel lectin, AOL, in iron-deficient cultures of the filamentous fungus A. oryzae; this lectin turned out to be l-fucose-specific from a hemagglutination inhibition assay using several monosaccharides and the encoding gene, fleA, was found to share 26% homology with AAL in primary structure (18Ishida H.

A transformant harboring the fleA gene under the control of the melO promoter was cultured in 100 ml of modified Czapek-Dox medium (0.3% NaNO3, 0.2% KCl, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.05% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.002% FeSO4·7H2O together with 6% glucose, pH 6.0) at 30 °C for 7 days. After collecting the mycelia, a cell-free extract was prepared by disruption with sea sand in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The resultant homogenate was centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min), and the supernatant was used for further purification. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. After salt precipitation with ammonium sulfate, the active hemagglutinating fraction (precipitated at 0.30–0.75 saturation) of the cell-free extract was suspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). The suspension was dialyzed overnight against the same buffer and then applied to a column of CM Toyoperl 650 m, 1.6 cm × 10 cm (TOSO, Tokyo, Japan), equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). AOL was eluted with a 0–500 mm NaCl linear gradient in the same buffer. The peak fractions with hemagglutinating activity were pooled and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. Purified AOL was stored at 4 °C because freezing causes 15–20% loss of the protein. SPR Measurements—The Biacore 2000 instrument, BIA evaluation software 3.0, sensor chip CM5 and the amino coupling kit were obtained from Biacore AB (Uppsala, Sweden). The surface of a research grade CM5 sensor chip was activated at a flow rate of 5 μl/min with 1:1 mixture of N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide solution for 20 min. Each lectin, at a concentration of 100 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, was injected for 20 min, and the remaining N-hydroxysuccinimide esters were blocked by the addition of 1 m ethanolamine, for 20 min. AOL, AAL, and LCA were immobilized to flow cells on the CM5 sensor chip at 322, 413, and 541 fmol, respectively. Measurements were carried out simultaneously on all four measuring channels of which three were immobilized AOL, AAL, and LCA, and the fourth channel was the reference flow cell. The fourth channel was treated identically except for the injection of lectin. All analyses were performed at 25 °C in HBS buffer (10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4 containing 0.01% Tween 20) at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The concentrations of PA-sugar chains and FGP solutions were, respectively, 1.0 and 7.0 nmol/ml in 100 μl of HBS buffer. The analytes were injected for 2 min, and after a dissociation period of 3.5 min, the surface was regenerated with a 1-min pulse of 100 mm glycine buffer, pH 3.0. All binding experiments were repeated three times, and similar results were obtained. Fractionation of PA-Sugar Chains by AOL or AAL Lectin Affinity Chromatography—Purified AOL (2.5 mg) and AAL (2.7 mg) were each dissolved in 200 mm sodium acid carbonate buffer (pH 8.3) containing 0.5 m NaCl and coupled to an NHS-activated HiTrap column (1 ml; GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amount of protein immobilized was determined by measuring the amount of uncoupled protein in the wash fraction. Lectin affinity chromatography was performed at room temperature. The AOL- or AAL-immobilized column was equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), containing 0.15 m NaCl. α1,6-fucosylated (biantennary), and α1,3-fucosylated (tri Le-x) PA-sugar chains (80 pmol each) were applied to each column. The non-bound fraction was eluted with four volumes of equilibration buffer. The bound fraction was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.05–0.55 mm fucose in equilibration buffer applied over five volumes, and the column was then washed with a volume of 1 mm fucose, a volume of 10 mm fucose, and four volumes of equilibration buffer. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected throughout. To separate PA-sugar chains, a 20-μl aliquot of each fraction was applied to reversed-phase HPLC using 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 1.0% (v/v) nBtOH, at 40 °C. Each PA-sugar chain was quantified by fluorescence. Biotinylation of Lectins—AOL, AAL, and LCA were biotinylated using a biotin labeling kit from Roche Applied Science (Tokyo, Japan). The d-biotinoyl-ϵ-aminocaproic acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (15 μl; 2 mg/ml in dimethylformamide) was added dropwise to a solution of each lectin (1.0 ml; 1.0 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) while being agitated with a vortex mixer. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature with gentle stirring, the labeled lectin was collected by Sephadex G-25 column chromatography and stored at 4 °C until use. Lectin Blot Analysis—Lectin blot analyses were performed as described previously (21Miyoshi E. Ihara Y. Hayashi N. Fusamoto H. Kamada T. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28311-28315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In brief, 10 μg of protein was subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated overnight with 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5; TBS), and then for 1 h with 1.9 μg/ml of biotinylated AOL lectins or 0.5 μg/ml of biotinylated AAL in TBST (TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20). After being washed with TBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin (VECTASTAIN ABC kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min and then washed with TBST. Staining was performed with ECL Western blot detection reagents (GE Healthcare). Cytochemical Staining with Lectins—MEF cell cultures were prepared as previously described (22Wang X. Inoue S. Gu J. Miyoshi E. Noda K. Li W. Mizuno-Horikawa Y. Nakano M. Asahi M. Takahashi M. Uozumi N. Ihara S. Lee S.H. Ikeda Y. Yamaguchi Y. Aze Y. Tomiyama Y. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Kondo A. Shapiro S.D. Lopez-Otin C. Kuwaki T. Okabe M. Honke K. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2005; 102: 15791-15796Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In brief, cultures of fibroblasts from wild-type or Fut8 knock-out mice (22Wang X. Inoue S. Gu J. Miyoshi E. Noda K. Li W. Mizuno-Horikawa Y. Nakano M. Asahi M. Takahashi M. Uozumi N. Ihara S.

Sci. 2005; 102: 15791-15796Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) were prepared by trypsinization of 14–15 day embryos. The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator supplied with 5% CO2 in air. The cell solution (0.3 ml) was plated at an initial density of 1.0 × 104 cells/ml on coverslips (Fisher Scientific Waltham, MA), and placed in current 24-well cell-culture plates (IWAKI Chiba Japan). The cells were incubated for 24 h before examination and were washed three times with PBS buffer at 0.5 ml/well (washing step). The cells were fixed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and dehydrated in ice-cold ethanol for 10 min after the washing step. Unbound sites were blocked by incubation with 200 μl of 1.0% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in washing solution for 30 min. After the blocking solution was removed, the wells were incubated with 100 μl of biotinylated AOL (5.0 or 50 μg/ml) or AAL (2.5 or 5.0 μg/ml) in blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature. Localization of lectin was visualized by an avidin-biotin coupling immunofluorescence technique. The cultured cells were incubated with streptavidin, Alexa Fluor 546 conjugate (Molecular Probes S11225, Eugene, OR) at room temperature for 1 h, then washed and mounted with aqueous mounting medium (Permaflour, Beckman-Coulter, Paris, France). Fluorescent images were analyzed with an Olympus fluorescence microscope BXF50–3 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Preparation and Protein Characteristics of AOL—To clarify the function of AOL, its encoding gene fleA was overexpressed in A. oryzae, resulting in a maximum yield of 1.0 g/liter-broth/7 d of AOL. The intracellular recombinant AOL was purified to such an extent that it resulted in the agglutination of rabbit red blood cells at a concentration of 3.9 μg/ml of lectin in PBS (pH 7.2), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified AOL gave a single band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 lane 1). As we described previously, AOL shares 26% homology with AAL in primary structure (18Ishida H. Moritani T. Hata Y. Kawato A. Suginami K. Abe Y. Imayasu S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the molecular weight of AOL on SDS-PAGE was 35,000, a little higher than that of AAL. By contrast, LCA appeared as two bands corresponding to molecular weights of 6000 and 18,000. Previous studies have reported the molecular weight of AAL as 66,796, consisting of identical subunits of 33,398 (15Fukumori F. Takeuchi N. Hagiwara T. Ohbayashi H. Endo T. Kochibe N. Nagata Y. Kobata A. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 190-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that of LCA as 46,000, consisting of four subunits (α2β2): two of 5,710 and two of 17,572 (24Toyoshima S. Osawa T. Tonomura A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 221: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In SPR analysis, HCl injection (100 mm, 100 μl) into a CM5 sensor chip flow cell immobilized with purified AOL resulted in a decrease in resonance units (RU), corresponding to approximately half the amount of immobilized ligand (data not shown), which suggests that AOL consists of two identical subunits. In addition to the three-dimensional structure, AOL and AAL were found to have almost the same isoelectric point, pI 9.0 (data not shown). These results suggest that AOL is similar to AAL not only in amino acid sequence but also in protein characteristics. The Carbohydrate Binding Specificity of AOL—An oligosaccharide binding study has shown that AAL is highly specific for α1,6-fucosylated oligosaccharides (16Yamashita K. Kochibe N. Ohkura T. Ueda I. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4688-4693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate whether AOL is equally specific for α1,6-fucosylated oligosaccharides, we investigated the interaction of six differently fucosylated PA-sugar chains with AOL immobilized to a CM5 sensor chip flow cell. The molar amount of each PA-sugar chain that interacts with AOL can be deduced from the differences in the RU values of an overlay plot of the sensorgrams (Fig. 2A), which are equivalent to mass change. From the molar amount of each PA-sugar chain that interacted with immobilized AOL (Fig. 3A, solid bar), AOL has the strongest preference for the α1,6-fucosylated PA-sugar chain among the α1,2-, α1,3-, α1,4-, and α1,6-fucosylated chains tested. These results suggest that, like AAL, AOL is highly specific for α1,6-fucosylated oligosaccharides.FIGURE 3The molar amount of each PA-sugar chain that interacts with AOL or AAL. The molar amount of each PA-sugar chain that interacts with AOL (A) or AAL (B) was deduced from the differences in the RU values of an overlay plot of the sensorgrams (Figs. 2 and 4), which are equivalent to mass change. Total binding (solid bar) indicates differences in the 10-s average RU values before the start of injection (90–100 s) and before the end of injection (210–220 s); irreversible binding (slashed bar) indicates differences before the start of injection (90–100 s) and at equilibrium after the injection had stopped and had been replaced by a buffer flow (420–430 s).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Comparison of the Carbohydrate Binding Specificity of AOL, AAL, and LCA—AAL and LCA are widely used to estimate the extent of core fucosylation on glycoproteins and to fractionate glycoproteins. To compare the carbohydrate binding specificity of AOL with that of AAL and LCA, we investigated the interaction of the six PA-sugar chains with these lectins immobilized to the CM5 sensor chip flow cells by using BIAcore. As shown in Fig. 2, AOL and AAL showed binding to the PA-sugar chains tested, whereas LCA showed no binding to them (data not shown). From the molar amount of each PA-sugar chain that interacted with each immobilized lectin (Fig. 3, solid bar), both AOL and AAL apparently displayed similar specificities for the α1,6-fucosylated PA-sugar chain. As shown in the overlay plot of sensorgrams (Fig. 2B), however, the rate of the rise in the RU value over the injection time (100–220 s) and the fall over the dissociation time (220–430 s) indicated that the binding to AAL occurs in a biphasic fashion in a series of fast and slow interactions, unlike the binding to AOL (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the RU value at equilibrium during the dissociation time (420–430 s) in the overlay plot of sensorgrams (Fig. 2) indicated that, respectively, 1.5 times and 5.1 times as many α1,6 (N) and α1,2 (H antigen) fucosylated PA-sugar chains remained bound to AAL without dissociation as remained bound to AOL. These results suggest that the irreversible binding of these PA-sugar chains is much stronger to AAL than to AOL. Consequently, we compared the carbohydrate-binding specificity of AOL with that of AAL for two different binding properties: namely, total binding and irreversible binding, as shown in Fig. 3 (solid bar and slashed bar, respectively). Comparison of Specificity for Core Fucosylation of AOL with That of AAL—To elucidate which is the more specific lectin for core fucosylation, we determined whether AOL or AAL showed quantitatively lower binding to the other fucosylated PA-sugar chains relative to α1,6-fucosylated PA-sugar chains. From the results of total binding shown in Fig. 4A, AAL displayed quantitatively lower binding to other fucosyl PA-sugar chains relative to the α1,6-fucosylated PA-sugar chain than did AOL. From the results of the irreversible binding shown in Fig. 4B, however, the amount of AAL binding to α1,2 (H antigen) relative to α1,6 (N) PA-sugar chains is higher than that of AOL. Taken together, we conclude that AOL is more specific for core fucosylation than is AAL in terms of irreversible binding. Comparison of the Specificity of AOL for FGP with That of AAL and LCA—As described above, we investigated the interactions of lectins with PA-sugar chains to determine their specificities for fucosylated oligosaccharides. However, PA-sugar chains are artificial oligosaccharides and may not be representative of in vivo fucosylated oligosaccharides owing to the decyclization of the reducing terminal N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) of these sugar chains with pyridylamine (Table 1). Then, to compare the interactions of the lectins with an oligosaccharide of in vivo glycoproteins, we purified FGP from hen's egg yolk as described under “Experimental Procedures.” FGP has N-glycans with α1,6-fucosyl residue bound to the core GlcNAc linked to peptide as shown in Table 1. The linked peptide chain has three amino groups (two lysine residues and the N-terminal group) and, after fluorescent labeling, an average of 2.0 of these three amino groups were labeled with N-[2-(2-pyridylamino) ethyl]succinamic acid 5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboxyimide ester (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5, the rate of the rise in the RU value over the injection time (100–220 s) and the rate of the fall over the dissociation time (220–430 s) indicated that binding to AAL occurs in a biphasic fashion in a series of fast and slow interactions, and the RU value at equilibrium during the dissociation time (420–430 s) indicated that 2.6 times as much FGP remains bound to AAL without dissociation as remains bound to AOL. These results were similar to the plots for binding to the α1,6 (N) PA-sugar chains shown in Fig. 2. From the irreversible binding (Fig. 3, slashed bar), however, the interactions of FGP with immobilized AOL and AAL were weaker than those of the α1,6 (N) PA-sugar chains, respectively. This weaker binding must result from a stronger electrostatic repulsion from FGP than from the PA-sugar chains because both AOL and AAL have positive charges under the conditions used for SPR analysis at pH 7.4 and FGP has more p"

https://openalex.org/W2096291976,"Induction of G(2)/M phase transition in mitotic and meiotic cell cycles requires activation by phosphorylation of the protein phosphatase Cdc25. Although Cdc2/cyclin B and polo-like kinase (PLK) can phosphorylate and activate Cdc25 in vitro, phosphorylation by these two kinases is insufficient to account for Cdc25 activation during M phase induction. Here we demonstrate that p42 MAP kinase (MAPK), the Xenopus ortholog of ERK2, is a major Cdc25 phosphorylating kinase in extracts of M phase-arrested Xenopus eggs. In Xenopus oocytes, p42 MAPK interacts with hypophosphorylated Cdc25 before meiotic induction. During meiotic induction, p42 MAPK phosphorylates Cdc25 at T48, T138, and S205, increasing Cdc25's phosphatase activity. In a mammalian cell line, ERK1/2 interacts with Cdc25C in interphase and phosphorylates Cdc25C at T48 in mitosis. Inhibition of ERK activation partially inhibits T48 phosphorylation, Cdc25C activation, and mitotic induction. These findings demonstrate that ERK-MAP kinases are directly involved in activating Cdc25 during the G(2)/M transition."
https://openalex.org/W1985528615,"The nucleoporins Nup58 and Nup45 are part of the central transport channel of the nuclear pore complex, which is thought to have a flexible diameter. In the crystal structure of an α-helical region of mammalian Nup58/45, we identified distinct tetramers, each consisting of two antiparallel hairpin dimers. The intradimeric interface is hydrophobic, whereas dimer-dimer association occurs through large hydrophilic residues. These residues are laterally displaced in various tetramer conformations, which suggests an intermolecular sliding by 11 angstroms. We propose that circumferential sliding plays a role in adjusting the diameter of the central transport channel."
https://openalex.org/W2043411667,"Here, we show that the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans biological clock protein CLK-2 (HCLK2) associates with the S-phase checkpoint components ATR, ATRIP, claspin and Chk1. Consistent with a critical role in the S-phase checkpoint, HCLK2-depleted cells accumulate spontaneous DNA damage in S-phase, exhibit radio-resistant DNA synthesis, are impaired for damage-induced monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and fail to recruit FANCD2 and Rad51 (critical components of the Fanconi anaemia and homologous recombination pathways, respectively) to sites of replication stress. Although Thr 68 phosphorylation of the checkpoint effector kinase Chk2 remains intact in the absence of HCLK2, claspin phosphorylation and degradation of the checkpoint phosphatase Cdc25A are compromised following replication stress as a result of accelerated Chk1 degradation. ATR phosphorylation is known to both activate Chk1 and target it for proteolytic degradation, and depleting ATR or mutation of Chk1 at Ser 345 restored Chk1 protein levels in HCLK2-depleted cells. We conclude that HCLK2 promotes activation of the S-phase checkpoint and downstream repair responses by preventing unscheduled Chk1 degradation by the proteasome."
https://openalex.org/W1995561104,"Because activation of ERK1/2 MAP kinase (MAPK) is critical for hippocampus-dependent memory, there is considerable interest in mechanisms for regulation of MAPK during memory formation. Here we report that MAPK and CREB-mediated transcription are negatively regulated by SCOP (suprachiasmatic nucleus [SCN] circadian oscillatory protein) and that SCOP is proteolyzed by calpain when hippocampal neurons are stimulated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), KCl depolarization, or NMDA. Moreover, training for novel object memory decreases SCOP in the hippocampus. To determine if hippocampus-dependent memory is influenced by SCOP in vivo, we generated a transgenic mouse strain for the inducible overexpression of SCOP in the forebrain. Overexpression of SCOP completely blocked memory for novel objects. We conclude that degradation of SCOP by calpain contributes to activation of MAPK during memory formation.

Gene-disruption studies also support the hypothesis that MAPK activity is critical for synaptic plasticity and memory. Disruption of the gene for RasGRF, an activator of Ras, attenuates long-term memory (LTM) for cued fear conditioning and LTP in the basolateral amygdala (Brambilla et al., 1997Brambilla R.

Consequently, it is important to understand how MAPK is activated in central nervous system (CNS) neurons. Activity-induced increases in intracellular free Ca2+ can stimulate MAPK by several mechanisms including calmodulin stimulation of RasGRF (Farnsworth et al., 1995Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W.

Calcium activation of Ras mediated by neuronal exchange factor Ras-GRF.Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) or indirectly through stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (Wang and Storm, 2003Wang H.

Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), subsequent activation of protein kinase A (PKA), and stimulation of Rap1 (de Rooij et al., 1998de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T.

Negative regulation of MAPK signaling may be just as important for memory as stimulatory mechanisms. Mice deficient in neurofibromatosis type 1, a RAS GTPase-activating protein, have defects in hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, suggesting that a balance between Ras stimulation and inhibition is critical for memory (Silva et al., 1997Silva A.J. Frankland P.W. Marowitz Z. Friedman E. Lazlo G. Cioffi D. Jacks T. Bourtchuladze R. A mouse model for the learning and memory deficits associated with neurofibromatosis type I.Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Recently, it was discovered that suprachiasmatic nucleus circadian oscillatory protein (SCOP) (Shimizu et al., 1999Shimizu K. Okada M. Takano A. Nagai K. SCOP a novel gene product expressed in a circadian manner in rat suprachiasmatic nucleus.FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 363-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) is a negative regulator of K-Ras in PC12 cells (Shimizu et al., 2003Shimizu K. Okada M. Nagai K. Fukada Y. Suprachiasmatic nucleus circadian oscillatory protein, a novel binding partner of K-Ras in the membrane rafts, negatively regulates MAPK pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14920-14925Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). SCOP interacts directly with K-Ras through its leucine-rich repeat and inhibits K-Ras function by associating with the nucleotide-free form of K-Ras. This prevents binding of GTP to K-Ras, inhibits its activity, and prevents neurotrophin stimulation of MAPK. In PC12 cells, SCOP overexpression inhibits depolarization stimulation of MAPK by blocking K-Ras activity (Shimizu et al., 2003Shimizu K. Okada M. Nagai K. Fukada Y. Suprachiasmatic nucleus circadian oscillatory protein, a novel binding partner of K-Ras in the membrane rafts, negatively regulates MAPK pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14920-14925Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). SCOP inhibition of K-Ras activity is especially interesting because the K-Ras/MEK/MAPK pathway is critical for synaptic and behavioral plasticity (Ohno et al., 2001Ohno M. Frankland P.W. Chen A.P. Costa R.M. Silva A.J. Inducible, pharmacogenetic approaches to the study of learning and memory.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1238-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although SCOP attenuation of MAPK signaling has the potential to play an important role in neuroplasticity, mechanisms for regulation of SCOP have not been reported. Furthermore, it has not been established that SCOP regulates MAPK/CRE-mediated transcription in CNS neurons, a transcriptional pathway important for long-term memory (Athos et al., 2002Athos J.

Here, we report that SCOP negatively regulates CRE-mediated transcription in hippocampal neurons and is rapidly degraded by calpain when neurons are stimulated with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), NMDA, or KCl-induced depolarization. Interestingly, SCOP is also rapidly degraded during training for hippocampus-dependent memory, and SCOP-overexpressing transgenic mice have no long-term memory for novel objects. These data suggest that SCOP constrains MAPK activity and that its degradation contributes to the transient activation of MAPK required for some forms of hippocampus-dependent memory. SCOP was originally discovered as a protein that undergoes a circadian oscillation in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) but not in other regions of brain (Shimizu et al., 1999Shimizu K. Okada M. Takano A. Nagai K. SCOP a novel gene product expressed in a circadian manner in rat suprachiasmatic nucleus.FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 363-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To explore the role of SCOP in regulation of MAPK signaling in the hippocampus, we examined its distribution in brain by immunohistochemistry (Figure 1A). SCOP immunoreactivity was present predominantly in the somata and processes extending from somata in area CA1 of the rat and mouse hippocampus. SCOP is also expressed in area CA3 but not the dentate gyrus. The SCOP immunostaining in the hippocampus was completely blocked when the SCOP antibody was preabsorbed with SCOP protein. Because of the importance of the hippocampus for memory formation, this study focused on the regulatory role of SCOP in hippocampal neurons in vitro and in vivo. One of the major MAPK-activated transcriptional pathways implicated in hippocampus-dependent memory is CRE-mediated transcription (Athos et al., 2002Athos J. Impey S. Pineda V.V. Chen X. Storm D.R. Hippocampal CRE-mediated gene expression is required for contextual memory formation.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1119-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, Bourtchuladze et al., 1994Bourtchuladze R. Frenguelli B. Blendy J. Cioffi D. Schutz G. Silva A.J.

To determine if SCOP inhibits stimulation of this transcriptional pathway in hippocampal neurons, neurons were cotransfected with a reporter for CRE-mediated transcription with varying amounts of a SCOP expression vector (Figure 1B). BDNF stimulation of CRE-mediated transcription in hippocampal neurons was progressively inhibited by increasing amounts of SCOP, with almost complete inhibition at the highest levels of SCOP. This indicates that SCOP can function as a negative regulator of CRE-mediated transcription in hippocampal neurons. If endogenous SCOP inhibits MAPK and CRE-mediated transcription, inhibition of SCOP expression should increase CRE-mediated transcription. To test this, hippocampal neurons were cotransfected with SCOP siRNA, or a scrambled RNA sequence of the same composition, and a reporter for CRE-mediated transcription. In unstimulated cells, SCOP siRNA increased CRE-mediated transcription 4-fold, a stimulation twice that obtained with BDNF alone (Figure 1C). These data indicate that endogenous SCOP constrains CRE-mediated transcription in hippocampal neurons. We confirmed that SCOP siRNA attenuates MAPK activation using a lentivirus construct to express the SCOP siRNA. Lentivirus expression of the SCOP siRNA depressed SCOP protein and activated pERK in unstimulated and BDNF-treated hippocampal neurons (Figure S1). Because SCOP inhibits MAPK signaling and blocks stimulation of CRE-mediated transcription, it was important to determine how SCOP itself is regulated in hippocampal neurons. Since we were unable to detect phosphorylation of SCOP (data not shown), we considered the possibility that SCOP may be degraded when neurons are stimulated with BDNF or other activators of MAPK. We monitored SCOP protein levels by western analysis after hippocampal neurons were treated with BDNF. Within 5 min of BDNF treatment, SCOP protein was reduced by 50% compared to controls and returned to unstimulated levels by 60 min (Figure 2A). We also found that depolarization of cultured hippocampal neurons with KCl or treatment with NMDA reduced SCOP levels 52% and 44%, respectively (Figure 2B). Similar results were obtained when cultured cortical neurons were treated with BDNF; SCOP protein was rapidly degraded and returned to baseline within 3 hr (data not shown). The fact that SCOP protein was never totally degraded suggests that SCOP levels may be maintained by a balance between protein synthesis and proteolysis. The rapid reduction in SCOP protein when neurons are treated with BDNF, KCl, or NMDA suggests that it may be degraded by a protease. The fact that SCOP levels return to baseline relatively quickly suggest that transient activation of a protease stimulates SCOP degradation. We focused on Ca2+-stimulated proteases because activation of NMDA receptors (Dingledine, 1983Dingledine R. Excitatory amino acids: modes of action on hippocampal pyramidal cells.Fed. Proc. 1983; 42: 2881-2885PubMed Google Scholar), BDNF (Berninger et al., 1993Berninger B. Garcia D.E. Inagaki N. Hahnel C. Lindholm D.

In cell-free, hippocampal extracts, SCOP was rapidly degraded in the presence of free Ca2+ but not in its absence, suggesting that SCOP is susceptible to degradation by a Ca2+-activated protease (Figure 3A). To identify the protease responsible for degradation of SCOP we examined inhibitors of several proteases including caspase-3 (Chan and Mattson, 1999Chan S.L. Mattson M.P.

Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 167-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). These proteases are present at synapses and have been implicated in neural plasticity and memory formation (for reviews see Cline, 2003Cline H.

Biol. 2003; 13: R514-R516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, Chan and Mattson, 1999Chan S.L. Mattson M.P.

Neither the caspase-3 inhibitor nor lactacystin, a proteasome inhibitor, blocked Ca2+-induced SCOP degradation (Figure 3B). Only calpeptin inhibited SCOP degradation, indicating that SCOP may be degraded by Ca2+-stimulated calpain. We confirmed that calpain is activated when hippocampal neurons are treated with BDNF (data not shown). There are two major calpain isoforms, calpain I (μ-form) and calpain II (m-form), which are activated at different Ca2+concentrations. Within the brain, calpain I is predominantly neuronal, existing at higher levels in the dendrites and cell bodies, whereas relatively higher levels of calpain II have been observed in axons and glia (Nixon, 1986Nixon R.A. Fodrin degradation by calcium-activated neutral proteinase (CANP) in retinal ganglion cell neurons and optic glia: preferential localization of CANP activities in neurons.J.

Distribution of mu-calpain proenzyme in the brain and other neural tissues in the rat.Brain Res. 1995; 697: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To determine if SCOP is selectively proteolyzed by calpain I or II, we incubated purified calpain I and II with immunoprecipitated SCOP. Both calpains degraded SCOP protein in vitro (Figure 3C). To ascertain if calpain proteolyzes SCOP in hippocampal neurons, we treated neurons with calpain inhibitor III and monitored SCOP degradation when BDNF was applied (Figure 4A). The decrease in SCOP levels caused by BDNF was completely blocked by calpain inhibitor III, and furthermore there was a significant increase in SCOP levels after treatment with the protease inhibitor. This suggests that SCOP levels are controlled by a balance between synthesis of the protein and degradation by calpain. This was confirmed by examining SCOP levels when hippocampal neurons were treated with calpain inhibitor III, without BDNF (Figure 4B). Endogenous SCOP protein increases approximately 2-fold by 90 min after treatment with the protease inhibitor. If SCOP negatively regulates MAPK signaling and calpain degrades SCOP, proteolytic degradation of SCOP may contribute to MAPK activation. Indeed, stimulation of MAPK activity in hippocampal neurons by BDNF was decreased at least 2-fold when calpain activity was blocked (Figure 4C). Since activation of MAPK is required for object recognition memory (Kelly et al., 2003Kelly A. Laroche S. Davis S. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase in hippocampal circuitry is required for consolidation and reconsolidation of recognition memory.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5354-5360PubMed Google Scholar), it was of considerable interest to determine if the levels of SCOP protein decrease during training for object recognition memory. We measured SCOP 5 min after training for novel object recognition (Figure 5). In this paradigm, a mouse is allowed to briefly examine two novel objects, A and B. When the mouse is tested at a later time, it is presented with one of the original objects, A, and a new object, C. If the mouse remembers object A, it will spend more time examining object C because of natural curiosity for new objects. Memory for novel objects is reflected by greater preference for the new object C during testing (Figure 5A). We examined SCOP levels following training for novel objects because this is a milder form of training that does not depend on shocking the animal. Untrained controls were handled and placed in the training cage without novel objects. Although the decrease in SCOP seen at 5 min after training for novel objects was only 16%, it was significant (p < .01), and was paralleled by an increase in MAPK activity (p < .05) (Figure 5B). SCOP protein also decreased when animals were trained for context (Figure S4). Presumably changes in SCOP and MAPK activity are much greater in neurons directly affected during training than that measured by western analysis of extracts from the entire hippocampus. To determine if hippocampus-dependent memory is sensitive to the amount of SCOP expressed in the hippocampus in vivo, we made a tetracycline-inducible, SCOP-overexpressing mouse strain using the CamKIIα promoter to limit overexpression to the forebrain. The integration of transgene was verified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based genotyping using specific primers for tetracycline response element-SCOP (TRE-SCOP) and CamKII-rtTA2 transgene, respectively (Figure 6A). Doxycycline treated TRE-SCOP × CamKll-rtTA2 mice showed 1.5- to 2.5-fold higher SCOP in the hippocampus than those not treated with doxycyline (Figure 6A, right panel of western blot and graph); doxycycline-treated TRE-SCOP or CamKll-rtTA2 mice showed no increase in SCOP compared to littermate controls. In control experiments, we verified that doxycycline treatment did not affect the memory of wild-type, TRE-SCOP, or CamKll-rtTA2 mice for novel objects (data not shown). Overexpression of SCOP did not alter open-field activity or contextual memory indicating that general mobility and vision were unaffected (data not shown). Doxycyline treatment of TRE-SCOP × CamKll-rtTA2 mice, which increases SCOP in the hippocampus, had no effect on memory for novel objects measured 8 min after training (Figure 6B) but completely blocked memory for novel objects measured 24 hr after training (Figure 6C). These data are consistent with other experiments showing that MAPK activity is required for memory consolidation but not acquisition or short-term memory (Blum et al., 1999Blum S. Moore A.N. Adams F. Dash P.K. A mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in the CA1/CA2 subfield of the dorsal hippocampus is essential for long-term spatial memory.J.

We confirmed that overexpression of SCOP in the transgenic mouse strain blocks decreases in SCOP protein and the increase in pERK associated with training for novel objects (Figure S2). When doxycyline-treated mice were allowed to recover for 3 months, they exhibited normal 24 hr memory for novel objects (Figure 6D). Overexpression of SCOP did not completely block the increases in pER"

The AAT-catalyzed acylation of anthocyanins is important for the stabilization, accumulation in vacuoles, and modulating the coloration of the pigments (2Nakayama T. Suzuki H. Nishino T. J. Mol. Catal. B Enzym. 2003; 23: 117-132Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that AAT catalysis proceeds through the formation of a ternary complex consisting of acyl-CoA, an anthocyanin, and the enzyme, where a general-base amino acid residue deprotonates a hydroxy group of the anthocyanin substrate, thereby promoting its nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl of the thioester of acyl-CoA (6Suzuki H. Nakayama T. Nishino T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1764-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The red color of the chrysanthemum (Dendranthema × morifolium) mainly arises from cyanidin 3-O-3″,6″-O-dimalonylglucoside (Fig. 1, compound 3), which contains two malonyl groups (7Ino I. Nishiyama H. Yamaguchi M-A. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 1425-1426Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 8Suzuki H. Nakayama T. Yamaguchi M. Nishino T. Plant Sci. 2004; 166: 89-96Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). During the biosynthesis of the pigment the first malonylation takes place at the 6″-position of the cyanidin 3-O-glucoside (1) (termed 3MaT1 activity) and is catalyzed by either of two distinct anthocyanin malonyltransferases, Dm3MaT1 (malonyl-CoA:anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside-6″-O-malonyltransferase) or Dm3MaT2 (malonyl-CoA:anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside-3″,6″-O-dimalonyltransferase) (Fig. 1) (8Suzuki H. Nakayama T. Yamaguchi M. Nishino T. Plant Sci. 2004; 166: 89-96Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The second malonylation (termed 3MaT2 activity) is exclusively catalyzed by Dm3MaT2, which further malonylates the 3″ position of the mono-malonylated product (cyanidin 3-O-6″-O-malonylglucoside, 2), producing cyanidin 3-O-3″,6″-O-dimalonylglucoside (3). Thus, Dm3MaT1 shows exclusive 3MaT1 activity, whereas Dm3MaT2 shows both 3MaT1 and 3MaT2 activities. It is particularly noteworthy that these two malonyltransferases (MaTs) are 89% identical to each other in their primary structures (8Suzuki H. Nakayama T. Yamaguchi M. Nishino T. Plant Sci. 2004; 166: 89-96Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), serving as very good targets for studies of structural factors that govern the acyl acceptor specificity of AATs. The present study was undertaken to establish the structural basis of the acyl acceptor and donor specificities of AATs. As the first step we carried out region swapping and site-specific mutagenesis studies of Dm3MaT1 and Dm3MaT2 to identify the residues responsible for differential acceptor specificity between these two enzymes. In the second step we isolated a cDNA of another AAT homolog, Dm3MaT3, from red chrysanthemum petals, which yielded a recombinant protein that was suitable for x-ray crystallographic analyses. Although the first crystal structure of a free enzyme form of a BAHD family member, vinorine synthase of the medicinal plant Rauvolfia serpentina, was reported in 2005 (9Ma X. Koepke J. Panjikar S. Fritzsch G. Stöckigt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13576-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the crystal structure of a BAHD member complexed with acyl-CoA has not been reported. We were able to determine the crystal structures of Dm3MaT3 at 1.8-2.2 Å of resolutions, providing the first crystal structure of a BAHD member complexed with acyl-CoA. The crystal structures, along with the results of the present mutagenesis studies, allowed us to unambiguously identify the acyl-CoA and acyl-acceptor binding sites in AATs, providing important information for general insights into the specificity and mechanism of BAHD catalysis. Anthocyanins were generous gifts from Prof. Masa-atsu Yamaguchi, Minami-Kyushu University. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade or sequencing grade, as appropriate. The standard reaction mixture (50 μl) consisted of 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 60 μm malonyl-CoA, 120 μm cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, and enzyme. The mixture without enzyme was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of ice-cold 0.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Anthocyanins in the resulting mixture were analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Shimadzu Prominence LC solution system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with an Asahipak ODP-50 4E column (4.6 × 250 mm; Shoko, Tokyo, Japan). Chromatographic conditions were as follows: solvent A, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and 90% (v/v) acetonitrile; column temperature, ambient; detection at 520 nm; flow rate, 0.7 ml/min. The column was equilibrated with 20% B before use. After injection, the column was initially developed with 20% B for 3 min followed by a linear gradient from 20 to 31% B in 15 min followed by that from 31 to 56% B in 1 min. The column was then washed with 56% B for 4 min followed by a linear gradient from 56 to 20% B in 1 min. Assays for the initial velocity for 3MaT1 and 3MaT2 activities were carried out under steady-state conditions using a standard assay system (see above) with varying concentrations of substrates. Typically, the anthocyanin and malonyl-CoA concentrations were varied in the range of 5-54 and 5-30 μm, respectively, in the assays for Dm3MaT1, Dm3MaT2, and their mutants. Double reciprocal plots of the activities of these AATs generally yielded a family of apparently parallel lines in the range of substrate concentrations employed, as has been observed for other AATs (6Suzuki H. Nakayama T. Nishino T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1764-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The apparent kinetic parameters and their standard deviations were determined by fitting the initial velocity data by a nonlinear least squares method using a computer program (two-dimensional scientific graph-plotting tool program) to Equation 1, which best describes the observed parallel patterns of double reciprocal plots,1/v=KmA/(kcat[E][A])+(1+KmB/[B])/kcat[E](Eq. 1) where [A] and [B] denote the substrate concentrations, [E] denotes enzyme concentration, kcat denotes the catalytic rate constant, and KmA and KmB, respectively, denote [A] and [B], which give a kcat[E]/2 value in the presence of a saturating concentration of a counter substrate. Note that our previous product inhibition studies showed that the AAT-catalyzed malonyl transfer proceeds via a ternary complex mechanism (6Suzuki H. Nakayama T. Nishino T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1764-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), consistent with the results of the present crystallographic studies (see below). Under some circumstances, double reciprocal plots of ternary complex mechanisms are known to yield parallel patterns (10Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior, and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 623-625Google Scholar). The expression plasmids pQE-Dm3MaT1 and pQE-Dm3MaT2 (8Suzuki H. Nakayama T. Yamaguchi M. Nishino T. Plant Sci. 2004; 166: 89-96Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) share unique restriction enzyme sites (SphI, PmlI, SpeI, and SalI in the order of 5′→3′ orientation) in each AAT sequence. Digestion of each of these plasmids with SphI-PmlI produces two DNA fragments that are 0.5 and 3.3 kb in size. The 0.5-kb fragment derived from pQE-Dm3MaT2 were ligated with the 3.3-kb fragment from pQE-Dm3MaT1 to produce the plasmid pQE-Dm3MaT(211), which expresses a Dm3MaT1 mutant in which region A is replaced with that of Dm3MaT2 (see Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 1S). Likewise, the 0.5-kb fragment obtained from pQE-Dm3MaT1 was ligated with the 3.3-kb fragment from pQE-Dm3MaT2 to produce a plasmid expressing Dm3MaT(122). Plasmids expressing Dm3MaT(121) and Dm3MaT(212) were prepared by exchanging the PmlI/SpeI-digested DNA fragments of pQE-Dm3MaT1 and pQE-Dm3MaT2, and those expressing Dm3MaT(112) and Dm3MaT(221) were prepared by exchanging the SpeI/SalI-digested DNA fragments of pQE-Dm3MaT1 and pQE-Dm3MaT2. Escherichia coli JM109 cells were transformed with the resulting plasmids to overexpress each region-swapped mutant. The plasmids for the expression of site-specific mutants of Dm3MaT(212) was prepared by PCR using pQE-Dm3MaT(212) as a template and mutagenesis primers (not shown). cDNA Cloning and Expression of Dm3MaT3—The Dm3MaT3 cDNA was isolated from red buds of D. × morifolium essentially as described previously (8Suzuki H. Nakayama T. Yamaguchi M. Nishino T. Plant Sci. 2004; 166: 89-96Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The Dm3MaT3 cDNA was cloned into pBluescript SK-. From the resulting plasmid, the full-length Dm3MaT3 cDNA was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-TGCGAGCATATGGCTTCTCTTC-3′ and 5′-CCCGGGGATCCTTAAAGG-3′ to introduce NdeI and BamHI restriction sites (respective underlined sites) containing in-frame start and stop codons into the 5′- and 3′-ends of the cDNA, respectively. The amplified fragment was cloned into a pCR4Blunt-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced to confirm the absence of PCR errors. The fragment was then digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated with an expression vector, pET-15b (Novagen, Madison, WI), which had previously been digested with NdeI and BamHI. The resulting plasmid, pET-Dm3MaT3, which encodes an N-terminal in-frame fusion of Dm3MaT3 with a His6 tag, was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. After preculturing the transformant cells at 37 °C overnight in Luria-Bertani broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 10 ml of the culture was inoculated into 2000 ml of the same medium. After incubation at 30 °C until the A600 reached 0.5, isopropyl 1-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to the broth to a final concentration of 0.4 mm followed by cultivation at 30 °C for 14 h. Purification of Recombinant Dm3MaT3—All subsequent operations were conducted at 0-4 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g, 15 min) and resuspended in buffer H (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole, and 0.5 m NaCl). The cells were disrupted at 4 °C by 10 cycles of ultrasonication (where one cycle corresponds to 10 kHz for 10 s followed by an interval of 50 s). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (5000 × g, 15 min). Polyethyleneimine was slowly added to the supernatant solution to a final concentration of 0.3% (v/v). The mixture was allowed to stand at 4 °C for 30 min followed by centrifugation (8000 × g, 15 min) and filtration through a 0.22-μm filter. The supernatant was applied to a HisTrap HP column (5 ml; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer H. The column was extensively washed with buffer H, and the enzyme was eluted with buffer H containing 200 mm imidazole. The active fractions were collected, concentrated, and equilibrated with buffer T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) by ultrafiltration with an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device (30,000 molecular weight cut-off; Millipore, Bedford, MA). The enzyme was then digested with thrombin (Novagen; 1 unit/mg Dm3MaT3 protein) at 4 °C for 16hin20mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 2.5 mm CaCl2 to remove the His6 tag from the recombinant enzyme. The resulting mixture was applied to a HisTrap HP column (5 ml) equilibrated with buffer H. The column was extensively washed with buffer H, and the flow-through fractions, which contained Dm3MaT3, were collected. The enzyme solution was concentrated and equilibrated with buffer Q (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) by ultrafiltration. The resulting enzyme solution was applied to a HiTrap Q HP column (5 ml; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer Q at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using ÅKTA purifier (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-600 mm NaCl in buffer Q. The enzyme solution was concentrated and equilibrated with buffer A (0.01 m Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, containing 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) as described above. Proteins were quantified by the method of Bradford using a kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. For the production of selenomethionyl Dm3MaT3, E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIPL cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) harboring pET-Dm3MaT3 were grown in 10 liters of a minimal medium (Se-Met core medium; Wako, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with l-selenomethionine (2.5 mg/ml, final concentration) at 35 °C. The selenomethionyl Dm3MaT3 was purified from crude extracts of the recombinant cells essentially as described above, except that an extra HiTrap Q chromatography was carried out before HisTrap column chromatography. Dm3MaT3 crystals were grown at 20 °C over a period of 1-3 weeks by the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method. Dm3MaT3 crystals complexed with malonyl-CoA were obtained by mixing 2 μl of protein solution including 2 mm malonyl-CoA with 2 μl of reservoir solution (30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG8000, Hampton Research), 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 120 mm ammonium sulfate, and 10% glycerol). Crystals of substrate-free native and selenomethionyl Dm3MaT3 were obtained by mixing 2 μl of the protein solution with 2 μl of reservoir solution (25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG8000, Hampton Research), 100 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 10% glycerol, and 10% KCl). Crystals were frozen at 90 K. All data sets were collected on beamline BL-5A at the photon factory (KEK, Tsukuba, Japan). Measurements were performed at 90 K with λ = 0.97909 Å (Se peak), λ = 0.97928 Å (Se edge), λ = 0.95000 Å high-remote), and λ = 1.000 Å (native-free and native-complex). Complete data sets were collected through contiguous rotation ranges at a given wavelength before proceeding to the next wavelength. The data sets were processed and scaled with HKL2000 (11Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar). All data sets belonged to space group P21 with two molecules per asymmetric unit. The Dm3MaT3 structure was solved by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction method, with selenomethionyl Dm3MaT3 crystal. Initial phases were determined by the SOLVE program (12Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). Phase improvement by density modification including noncrystallography symmetry averaging was performed by the RESOLVE program (13Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). A model was then obtained by automatic tracing with ARP/wARP program (14Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). The structure was then rebuilt by O (15Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) and refined using Refmac (16Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13818) Google Scholar), with 5% of the data set aside as a free set. In subsequent refinement, the selenomethionyl Dm3MaT3 data set was replaced with native-free and native-complex data sets. Malonyl-CoA models were fitted into the substrate binding sites based on non-crystallography symmetry averaged difference electron density maps (Fig. 3C). Of 454 residues, 14 residues (N-terminal 5 residues, C-terminal 4 residues, and residues 365-369) in chains A and B are not visible in the electron density and are probably disordered. All figures were produced using POVSCRIPT+ (17Fenn T.D. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 944-947Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar), PyMOL (18DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics Systems. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar), and RASTER3D (19Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2854) Google Scholar). The Cα atoms of native-complex of Dm3MaT3 and vinorine synthase structures were superimposed with the program LSQKAB (20Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2327) Google Scholar). Region Swapping and Site-specific Mutagenesis of Dm3MaT1 and Dm3MaT2—To explore the amino acid residues responsible for the difference in the acyl-acceptor specificity of malonyl transfer between Dm3MaT1 and Dm3MaT2, we first carried out region swapping between these enzymes. Namely, regions A, B, and C of these two enzymes (see Fig. 2) were shuffled to obtain six swapped mutants: Dm3MaT(112), Dm3MaT(121), Dm3MaT(211), Dm3MaT(122), Dm3MaT(212), and Dm3MaT(221) (see also supplemental Fig. 1S). In the Dm3MaT(112) mutant, for example, regions A and B come from Dm3MaT1, and region C comes from Dm3MaT2. These mutants were examined for their 3MaT1 and 3MaT2 activities (Table 1; see also Fig. 1). The results showed that Dm3MaT(122), a Dm3MaT2 mutant containing region A of Dm3MaT1, as well as Dm3MaT(121) and Dm3MaT(112) displayed no appreciable 3MaT2 activity, although they showed 3MaT1 activities that were comparable with that of Dm3MaT1. These results suggest that region A of Dm3MaT2 contains an amino acid residue(s) that is important for 3MaT2 activity. Dm3MaT(211) also did not show 3MaT2 activity, suggesting that region B and/or C of Dm3MaT2 may also contain an amino acid residue(s) that is important for 3MaT2 activity. A comparison of the 3MaT2 activities of Dm3MaT(212) and Dm3MaT(221) showed that the apparent kcat/Km value for 3MaT2 activity of the former mutant was significantly higher than that of the latter, leading us to propose that region C, but not region B, contains an amino acid residue(s) that is important for 3MaT2 activity.TABLE 13MaT1 and 3MaT2 activities of mutantsEnzyme3MaT1 activity3MaT2 activitykcatkcat/Km for acyl donorkcat/Km for acyl acceptorkcatkcat/Km for acyl donorkcat/Km for acyl acceptors−1s−1 μm−1s−1 μm−1s−1s−1 mm−1s−1 mm−1Dm3MaT24.1 ± 0.22.0 ± 0.40.63 ± 0.150.27 ± 0.0343 ± 1157 ± 29 (150)aEight-fold mutant in region A; i.e. P5S/H11Q/A49R/T72A/G81S/F84Y/F86S/Y92F mutant of Dm3MaT1(212).Dm3MaT(221)4.4 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.10.43 ± 0.050.012 ± 0.0025.1 ± 0.49.0 ± 0.7 (24)Dm3MaT(212)4.3 ± 0.16.0 ± 0.81.6 ± 0.10.093 ± 0.01023 ± 438 ± 5 (100)Dm3MaT(122)14 × 10−3 ± 2 × 10−35.2 × 10−3 ± 0.7 × 10−32.2 × 10−3 ± 0.4 × 10−3<0.001Dm3MaT(112)3.8 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.21.2 ± 0.2<0.001Dm3MaT(121)3.1 ± 0.10.11 ± 0.041.8 ± 0.6<0.001Dm3MaT(211)2.7 ± 0.10.83 ± 0.080.40 ± 0.05<0.001Dm3MaT111 ± 0.24.0 ± 0.12.7 ± 0.1<0.001Site-specific mutants of Dm3MaT1(212)T35G1.5 ± 0.10.42 ± 0.050.31 ± 0.030.010 ± 0.0010.70 ± 0.152.8 ± 0.5 (7)L37V3.9 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.31.9 ± 0.10.027 ± 0.0035.2 ± 1.34.7 ± 0.9 (12)A38P3.4 ± 0.13.2 ± 0.92.4 ± 0.90.015 ± 0.0011.5 ± 0.34.2 ± 0.8 (11)Q51P4.2 ± 0.113 ± 42.5 ± 0.30.013 ± 0.0013.2 ± 0.54.8 ± 0.7 (12)M8aEight-fold mutant in region A; i.e. P5S/H11Q/A49R/T72A/G81S/F84Y/F86S/Y92F mutant of Dm3MaT1(212).3.2 ± 0.13.6 ± 0.41.5 ± 0.40.041 ± 0.0017.1 ± 0.615 ± 1 (40)Y411N1.2 ± 0.10.70 ± 0.090.67 ± 0.16<0.001A413T2.3 ± 0.13.1 ± 0.82.9 ± 1.10.015 ± 0.00222 ± 62.6 ± 0.4 (7)K419N6.4 ± 0.16.8 ± 0.82.8 ± 0.40.020 ± 0.00330 ± 96.5 ± 1.0 (17)CM14bFourteen-fold mutant in region B; i.e. I308C/S309T/V310A/N317D/L325F/I333V/T351A/S356G/E378D/G379A/P440S/K445E/F455L/V459I mutant of Dm3MaT(212).3.2 ± 0.16.2 ± 1.22.1 ± 0.40.015 ± 0.00120 ± 316 ± 7 (41)Seven-fold mutant of Dm3MaT1M7cG35T/V37L/P38A/P51Q/N410Y/T412A/N418K mutant of Dm3MaT1.4.2 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.13.4 ± 0.60.02 ± 0.0023.8 ± 0.49.1 ± 1.6 (24)a Eight-fold mutant in region A; i.e. P5S/H11Q/A49R/T72A/G81S/F84Y/F86S/Y92F mutant of Dm3MaT1(212).b Fourteen-fold mutant in region B; i.e. I308C/S309T/V310A/N317D/L325F/I333V/T351A/S356G/E378D/G379A/P440S/K445E/F455L/V459I mutant of Dm3MaT(212).c G35T/V37L/P38A/P51Q/N410Y/T412A/N418K mutant of Dm3MaT1. Open table in a new tab To identify the amino acid residues that are important for 3MaT2 activity in regions A and C, 9 site-specific mutants of Dm3MaT(212) were created in which each or a set of amino acid residues unique to Dm3MaT2 in regions A and C of Dm3MaT(212) were replaced by those unique to Dm3MaT1 (see Table 1), and their 3MaT and 3MaT2 activities were examined. The results showed that the following single amino acid substitutions in region A resulted in a significant loss of 3MaT2 activity of Dm3MaT(212) (relative kcat/Km for acyl acceptor, <20%): T35L, L37V, A38P, and Q51P. However, M8 mutant, which is an 8-fold Dm3MaT(212) mutant containing P5S, H11Q, A49R, T72A, G81S, F84Y, F86S, and Y92F in region A, displayed a considerable level of 3MaT2 activity. These results indicate that Thr-35, Leu-37, Ala-38, and Gln-51 of Dm3MaT2 are important for 3MaT2 activity. As for region C, each of the Y411N, A413T, and K419N substitutions in Dm3MaT(212) resulted in a significant loss of 3MaT2 activity (relative kcat/Km for acyl acceptor, <20%), whereas the 14-fold mutant of Dm3MaT(212), mutant CM14, where all of the amino acid residues unique to Dm3MaT2 in domain C except for Tyr-411, Ala-413, and Lys-419 were replaced by those that were unique to Dm3MaT1, displayed a significant level of 3MaT2 activity (Table 1). These results indicate the importance of Tyr-411, Ala-413, and Lys-419 for the 3MaT2 activity of Dm3MaT2. Considering the above findings, we concluded that Thr-35, Leu-37, Ala-38, Gln-51, Tyr-411, Ala-413, and Lys-419 are important for 3MaT2 activity of Dm3MaT2. This conclusion was further supported by the fact that mutant M7, 7-fold mutant of Dm3MaT1 (G35T/V37L/P38A/P51Q/N410Y/T412A/N418K), displayed a significant level of 3MaT2 activity (Table 1). Phylogenetics, Specificity, and Biochemical Properties of Dm3MaT3—During the course of our attempts to find the structural basis of the above conclusion, we identified a novel AAT homolog, Dm3MaT3, from red chrysanthemum petals, which unlike Dm3MaT1 and Dm3MaT2 yields protein crystals suitable for x-ray crystallographic studies (for details of the isolation and expression of Dm3MaT3 cDNA, see “Experimental Procedures”).

https://openalex.org/W2061581470,"The skin contains two known subpopulations of stem cells/epidermal progenitors: a basal keratinocyte population found in the interfollicular epithelium and cells residing in the bulge region of the hair follicle. The major role of the interfollicular basal keratinocyte population may be epidermal renewal, whereas the bulge population may only be activated and recruited to form a cutaneous epithelium in case of trauma. Using 3-dimensional cultures of murine skin under stress conditions in which only reserve epithelial cells would be expected to survive and expand, we demonstrate that a mesenchymal population resident in neonatal murine dermis has the unique potential to develop an epidermis in vitro. In monolayer culture, this dermal subpopulation has long-term survival capabilities in restricted serum and an inducible capacity to evolve into multiple cell lineages, both epithelial and mesenchymal, depending on culture conditions. When grafted subcutaneously, this dermal subpopulation gave rise to fusiform structures, reminiscent of disorganized muscle, that stained positive for smooth muscle actin and desmin; on typical epidermal grafts, abundant melanocytes appeared throughout the dermis that were not associated with hair follicles. The multipotential cells can be repeatedly isolated from neonatal murine dermis by a sequence of differential centrifugation and selective culture conditions. These results suggest that progenitors capable of epidermal differentiation exist in the mesenchymal compartment of an abundant tissue source and may have a function in mesenchymal-epithelial transition upon insult. Moreover, these cells could be available in sufficient quantities for lineage determination or tissue engineering applications."
https://openalex.org/W2084480806,"In the immune-privileged cornea, epithelial wounds heal rapidly with almost no scarring and, unlike in most other tissues, acute inflammation in the absence of infection is beneficial to healing. Molecular mechanisms, which account for this striking property, remain to be clearly defined, but they likely include autacoids that control leukocyte activation. Two prominent enzymes, 12/15-lipoxygenase (LOX), which generates antiinflammatory lipid autacoids, and heme-oxygenase (HO), which generates antioxidants and carbon monoxide, are highly expressed in human and mouse corneas. LXA4, an endogenous 12/15-LOX product, proved to be a potent inhibitor of exacerbated inflammation and significantly increased re-epithelialization in corneal wounds. In vivo deletion of 12/15-LOX correlated with exacerbated inflammation and impaired wound healing in 12/15-LOX(-/-) mice, a phenotype that was rescued by treatment with LXA4. More importantly, 12/15-LOX(-/-) mice demonstrated impaired induction of HO-1 in both acute and exacerbated inflammation. Topical LXA4 restored HO-1 expression in 12/15-LOX(-/-) mice and amplified HO-1 gene expression in human corneal epithelial cells. HO-2(-/-) mice, which fail to induce HO-1, also demonstrated exacerbated inflammation in response to injury, a phenotype that, notably, correlated with a 50% reduction in endogenous LXA4 formation. Collectively, results demonstrate a critical role for LXA4 in inflammatory/reparative responses and provide the first evidence that 12/15-LOX and HO systems function in concert to control inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1966663568,"The maintenance of an appropriate number of telomere repeats by telomerase is essential for proper chromosome protection. The action of telomerase at the telomere terminus is regulated by opposing activities that either recruit/activate the enzyme at shorter telomeres or inhibit it at longer ones, thus achieving a stable average telomere length. To elucidate the mechanistic details of telomerase regulation we engineered specific chromosome ends in yeast so that a single telomere could be suddenly shortened and, as a consequence of its reduced length, elongated by telomerase. We show that shortened telomeres replicate early in S phase, unlike normal-length telomeres, due to the early firing of origins of DNA replication in subtelomeric regions. Early telomere replication correlates with increased telomere length and telomerase activity. These data reveal an epigenetic effect of telomere length on the activity of nearby replication origins and an unanticipated link between telomere replication timing and telomerase action."
https://openalex.org/W1992439664,"In squamous cell carcinoma, the levels of nitric oxide (NO) derived from inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) derived from cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) originated from tumor cells or tumor-associated inflammatory cells have been reported to correlate with tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis. The present study examined the role of the iNOS signaling pathway in PGE2-mediated tumor invasiveness and proliferation in squamous cell carcinoma, A431, and SCC-9 cells. Cell invasion and proliferation promoted by PGE2 were blocked by iNOS silencing RNA or iNOS/guanylate cyclase (GC) pharmacological inhibition. Consistently, iNOS-GC pathway inhibitors blocked mitogen-activated protein kinase-ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which was required to mediate PGE2 functions. In vivo, in A431 cells implanted in nude mice, GC inhibition also decreased the tumor proliferation index and ERK1/2 activation. PGE2 effects were confined to the selective stimulation of the EP2 receptor subtype, leading to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation via protein kinase A (PKA) and c-Src activation. EP2-mediated ERK1/2 activation and cell functions were abolished by inhibitors of PKA, c-Src, and EGFR, as well as by inhibiting iNOS pathway. Silencing of iNOS also impaired EGFR-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These results indicate that iNOS/GC signaling is a downstream player in the control of EP2/EGFR-mediated tumor cell proliferation and invasion."

In this study, we have investigated the role of Fn14 in skeletal muscle formation in vitro. Flow cytometric and Western blot analysis revealed that Fn14 is highly expressed on myoblastic cell line C2C12 and mouse primary myoblasts. The expression of Fn14 was decreased upon differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes. Suppression of Fn14 expression using RNA interference inhibited the myotube formation in both C2C12 and primary myoblast cultures. Fn14 was required for the transactivation of skeletal α-actin promoter and the expression of specific muscle proteins such as myosin heavy chain fast type and creatine kinase. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Fn14 receptor in C2C12 myoblasts decreased the levels of myogenic regulatory factors MyoD and myogenin upon induction of differentiation. Conversely, overexpression of MyoD increased differentiation in Fn14-knockdown C2C12 cultures. Suppression of Fn14 expression in C2C12 myoblasts also inhibited the differentiation-associated increase in the activity of serum response factor and RhoA GTPase. In addition, our data suggest that the role of Fn14 during myogenic differentiation could be independent of TWEAK cytokine.

Myogenesis or skeletal muscle formation is a highly complex process that involves the expansion of mononucleated progenitor cells, their progression along a myogenic lineage pathway to become fusion-competent myoblasts, their migration and alignment, and finally their differentiation into multinucleated myotubes that further develop to become the myofibers of mature skeletal muscle (1Perry R.L.

During myogenesis, fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes is the terminal step of differentiation after which no further mitotic divisions occur within the myotubes or muscle fibers. The extra nuclei required for muscle growth are provided by satellite cells, which are located under the basal lamina of the muscle fiber (12Wagers A.J. Conboy I.M.

Accumulating evidence suggests that in addition to growth factors, cytokines produced by muscle cells and/or invading inflammatory cells after injury may play an important role in skeletal muscle repair and regeneration (14Tidball J.G.

TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) is a recently identified member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily of structurally related cytokines that generally function as both type II transmembrane proteins and as cleaved soluble molecules (23Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar, 24Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3038) Google Scholar). We have shown that soluble TWEAK protein stimulates myoblast proliferation and inhibits their differentiation into myotubes (25Dogra C. Changotra H. Mohan S. Kumar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10327-10336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, the molecular pathways through which TWEAK modulates myoblast proliferation and differentiation remain poorly understood. Based on different binding analyses indicating a physiologically relevant affinity between TWEAK and fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14-kDa protein (Fn14), Fn14 has been suggested as the receptor for TWEAK (26Wiley S.R. Cassiano L. Lofton T. Davis-Smith T. Winkles J.A. Lindner V. Liu H. Daniel T.O. Smith C.A. Fanslow W.C.

Fn14 is characterized as a type Ia transmembrane receptor that is distantly related to the TNF receptor superfamily (27Wiley S.R. Winkles J.A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It contains a single cysteine-rich domain in the extracellular region and a TNF receptor-associated factor-binding motif, but lacks the death domain in the cytoplasmic region (26Wiley S.R. Cassiano L. Lofton T. Davis-Smith T. Winkles J.A. Lindner V. Liu H. Daniel T.O. Smith C.A. Fanslow W.C.

The expression of Fn14 has been reported to increase on exposure of fibroblasts to growth factors, fetal calf serum, and phorbol ester (29Meighan-Mantha R.L. Hsu D.K. Guo Y. Brown S.A. Feng S.L.

Although TWEAK binds to Fn14, it is still controversial whether Fn14 is the only receptor for TWEAK and vice versa. It has been shown that Fn14 was not responsible for the osteoclastic effect of TWEAK on RAW264.7 cells that do not express Fn14 (31Polek T.C. Talpaz M. Darnay B.G. Spivak-Kroizman T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32317-32323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of Fn14 has been reported to promote neurite outgrowth independent of TWEAK cytokine (32Tanabe K. Bonilla I. Winkles J.A. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9675-9686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, involvement of Fn14 in the process of skeletal muscle formation remains unknown. Furthermore, it remains unclear if TWEAK affects myogenic differentiation through the recruitment of the Fn14 receptor. In this study we have investigated the role and the mechanisms by which Fn14 receptor regulates myogenic differentiation. Our data demonstrate that Fn14 is required for the differentiation of myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes. Suppression of Fn14 expression using RNA interference inhibits the expression of myogenic transcription factors MyoD and myogenin and the activation of serum response factor (SRF) and RhoA GTPase. Furthermore, our data provide initial evidence that the promyogenic role of Fn14 might be independent of TWEAK cytokine. Materials—Ham’s F-12 nutrient mixture was obtained from Invitrogen.

Total RNA was isolated and first strand cDNA was generated using Ambion’s oligo(dT) primer and Qiagen’s OmniScript reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). TWEAK construct was prepared by amplifying the murine TWEAK cDNA (GenBank™ accession number: NM_011614) with primers: sense 5′-AAGCTTATGGCCGCCCGTCGG A-3′ (TWEAKF); and antisense, 5′-TCTAGAGGCCCCTCAGTGAACTTG-3′ (TWEAKR).

All PCR amplifications were performed using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). PCR products were cloned into pCR®Blunt II TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and the authenticity of cDNA was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Finally, FLAG-TWEAK and MyoD cDNA were excised from pCR®Blunt II TOPO vector using HindIII and XbaI restriction enzymes and inserted into pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen) at HindIII and XbaI sites. The expression of proteins from plasmid constructs was confirmed using T7 based in vitro translation kit (Promega) and by transfection of cultured cells followed by Western blotting. Adenoviral vectors encoding murine TWEAK or MyoD cDNA were constructed as described (34He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA were inserted at HindIII and XbaI sites into pAdTrack-CMV vector. The positive clones were linearized by the restriction endonuclease PmeI and cotransformed with the supercoiled adenoviral vector AdEasy-1 into E. coli strain BJ5183 (Stratagene). Recombinant adenoviral constructs were selected, digested with restriction endonuclease PacI, and transfected into packaging cell line 293T using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). Production of adenovirus in 293T cells was observed after 6-7 days and was monitored by expression of green fluorescence protein in viral plaques. The cells were collected 7-8 days after transfection, the adenoviruses were released by three freeze-thaw cycles and amplified by infecting 293T cells in one 100-mm tissue culture plate. After 3 days the adenoviruses were harvested as described above and further amplified by infecting 293T cells. The amplified adenoviruses were harvested 3 days later, purified by centrifugation in CsCl, and stored at -80 °C in storage buffer (5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, and 25% glycerol). The titer of the virus was determined by infecting 293T cells with serial dilutions of adenoviruses and monitoring the viral plaques for expression of green fluorescence protein. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Flow cytometric analysis was done to study the expression of the Fn14 receptor on myogenic cells. Approximately, 1 × 106 cells of each cell type were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 30 min on ice with 5 μg/ml PE-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-human Fn14 or PE-conjugated mouse IgG isotype controls (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and analyzed for Fn14 expression by FACScan using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Short Interfering RNA (siRNA)—Silencing or knockdown of the Fn14 gene was achieved using the short interfering RNA (siRNA) technique. SMARTpool siRNA (containing RNA duplex with sequences: 5′-GGAUUCGGC UUG GUG UUG AUU3′ (sequence 1); 5′-CGU CGUCCAUUCAUUCAUUUU-3′ (sequence 2); 5′-GGACUGGGCUUAGAGUUCAUU-3′ (sequence 3); and 5′-CUAAGGAACUGCAGCAUUUUU-3′ (sequence 4) or the above individual siRNA duplexes for mouse Fn14 mRNA (GenBank accession number: NM_013749) and non-targeting control siRNA were obtained from Dharmacon RNA Technologies (Lafayette, CO). C2C12 myoblasts plated in either a 6-well (100,000 cells/well) or 24-well (20,000 cells/well) plate were transfected with siRNA duplexes using Dharma-Fect-3 transfection reagent following the manufacturer’s instructions. After 36 h of transfection, the protein levels of Fn14 were measured by Western blotting and flow cytometry analysis. Generation and Use of Short Hairpin (shRNA)-expressing Lentivirus—We used pLL3.7 plasmid (provided by Dr. Luk Van Parijs, Massachusetts Institute of Technology) to generate lentivirus encoding Fn14 shRNA (35Rubinson D.A.

We used a sequence from the SMARTpool Fn14 siRNA mixture (i.e. sequence 5′-GGACTGGGCTTAGAGTTCA-3′ from 545 to 563 of Fn14 mRNA) and a control sequence that does not target any known mouse mRNA (i.e. 5′-GCTCGGCATCCCTCTAAGA-3′). Oligonucleotides including control or Fn14 siRNA sequence and hairpin structure were chemically synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.). The sequences of the oligonucleotides were as follows: Fn14, 5′-TGGACTGGGCTTAGAGTTCATTCAAGAGATGAACTCTAAGCCCAGTCCTTTTTTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCGAGAAAAAAGGACTGGGCTTAGAGTTCATCTCTTGAATGAACTCTAAGCCCAGTCCA-3′ (reverse); control, 5′-TGCTCGGCATCCCTCTAAGATTCAAGAGATCTTAGAGGGATGCCGAGCTTTTTTC-3′ (forward), and 5′-TCGAGAAAAAAGCTCGGCATCCCTCTAAGATCTCTTGAATCTTAGAGGGATGCCGAGCA-3′ (reverse). The oligonucleotides were annealed, phosphorylated, and inserted into pLL3.7 vector using HpaI and XhoI sites. To produce lentivirus, plasmid DNA and helper plasmids (pMDLg/pRRE, pMD2.G, pRSVRev) were transfected into 293T cells. Forty-eight hours later, culture supernatants were collected, spun at 2,000 × g for 10 min, and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. Titers were determined by infecting 293T cells with serial dilutions of lentivirus. For transduction of C2C12 myoblasts with lentivirus, C2C12 myoblasts were plated at 2 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. The cells were transduced by adding culture supernatants containing lentivirus to the wells in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. After 48 h, the lentivirus containing culture medium was replaced by differentiation medium and myogenic differentiation was studied. Transient Transfection and Reporter Assay—Transactivation of skeletal α-actin promoter was studied by transiently transfecting the cells with the pSK-Luc construct that contains luciferase cDNA under the control of skeletal α-actin promoter (36Wei L. Zhou W. Wang L. Schwartz R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1736-H1743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C2C12 myoblasts grown in a 6-well plate were transfected with pSK-Luc (0.5 μg/well) using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). Transfection efficiency was controlled by cotransfection of myoblasts with pSV-galactosidase (0.1 μg/well). When cells were around 90% confluent, differentiation was induced by replacing growth medium by differentiation medium. Specimens were processed for luciferase and β-galactosidase expression using the luciferase and β-galactosidase assay systems with reporter lysis buffer as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). Luciferase measurements were made using a luminometer (Analytic Scientific Instrumentation, model 3010). Immunocytochemistry—Immunofluorescence was performed to study the myotube formation in C2C12 and primary myoblast cultures as described recently (25Dogra C. Changotra H. Mohan S. Kumar A. J. Biol.

Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—C2C12 myoblasts were incubated in differentiation medium for different time intervals and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Two milligrams of protein extract was immunoprecipitated with Fn14 antibody (2 μg/per sample). The immunoprecipitates were collected using protein A-Sepharose beads, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and blotted with either RhoA or Rac-1 antibody. To check the cellular level of specific proteins, 80 μg of protein extracts from each treatment were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibody as described previously (38Kumar A.

The dilution of primary antibody was as follows: MF-20 (1:100), anti-myogenin (1:500), anti-MyoD (1:500), anti-Myf5 (1:100), anti-RhoA (1:1000), anti-Rac-1 (1:1000), anti-Fn14 (1:2000), and anti-β-actin (1:3000). Immunoblots were quantified using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Creatine Kinase (CK) Assay—CK activity was measured using a spectrophotometry-based kit as described previously (25Dogra C.

RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (QRT-PCR)—RNA isolation and QRT-PCR was performed to measure the mRNA level of MyoD, myogenin, and Myf-5 in C2C12 myoblasts following a method as described recently (25Dogra C.

FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1986-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with control siRNA or Fn14 siRNA were seeded into a 24-well plate and incubated in either growth medium or differentiation medium. After 48 h the medium was removed and 200 μl of 10% alamar-Blue diluted in phenol red-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium was added. The fluorescence was determined 2 h later using a fluorescence plate reader (Fluorolite 1000, Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). AlamarBlue was evaluated using the optimal excitation and emission wavelengths of 546 and 590 nm, respectively. Cellular proliferation was also confirmed by measuring the total protein concentration in each well and by counting the total number of viable cells at the end of the incubation period. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. The Student’s t test or analysis of variance was used to compare quantitative data populations with normal distributions and equal variance. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant unless otherwise specified. In this study we have investigated the role of the Fn14 receptor in myogenesis. Because the major muscle differentiation steps can be reproduced in vitro with C2C12, a mouse myoblastic cell line (42Delgado I. Huang X. Jones S. Zhang L. Hatcher R. Gao B. Zhang P. Genomics. 2003; 82: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we have employed C2C12 myoblasts to study the involvement of Fn14 in myogenesis. Expression of Fn14 Receptor on Myoblasts and Its Suppression by RNA Interference—Fn14 expression has been reported in certain but not all cell types (31Polek T.C. Talpaz M. Darnay B.G.

Using flow cytometric analysis we first examined if the cells of the myogenic lineage express Fn14 receptor on their cell surface. As shown in Fig. 1A, the expression of Fn14 was strong on C2C12 and mouse primary myoblasts. Consistent with the published report (31Polek T.C. Talpaz M. Darnay B.G. Spivak-Kroizman T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32317-32323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the expression of Fn14 was not detected on RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1A). To examine whether the expression of Fn14 protein changes during myogenic differentiation, C2C12 myoblasts were incubated in differentiation medium for different time intervals ranging from 0 to 120 h and the expression"
https://openalex.org/W2072656825,"Conventional kinesin and class V and VI myosins coordinate the mechanochemical cycles of their motor domains for processive movement of cargo along microtubules or actin filaments. It is widely accepted that this coordination is achieved by allosteric communication or mechanical strain between the motor domains, which controls the nucleotide state and interaction with microtubules or actin. However, questions remain about the interplay between the strain and the nucleotide state. We present an analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Kar3/Vik1, a heterodimeric C-terminal Kinesin-14 containing catalytic Kar3 and the nonmotor protein Vik1. The X-ray crystal structure of Vik1 exhibits a similar fold to the kinesin and myosin catalytic head, but lacks an ATP binding site. Vik1 binds more tightly to microtubules than Kar3 and facilitates cooperative microtubule decoration by Kar3/Vik1 heterodimers, and yet allows motility. These results demand communication between Vik1 and Kar3 via a mechanism that coordinates their interactions with microtubules."

Herein we have investigated the mechanisms by which HLE and CG bind to PMN plasma membranes. 125I-Labeled HLE and CG bind to PMN at 0 °C in a saturable and reversible manner (KD = 5.38 and 4.36 × 10-7 m and 11.5 and 8.1 × 106 binding sites/cell, respectively). Incubation of PMN with radiolabeled HLE and CG in the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled HLE, CG, myeloperoxidase, lactoferrin, proteinase 3, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)-inactivated HLE, or PMSF-inactivated CG inhibited binding of radiolabeled ligands. This indicates that these PMN granule proteins share binding sites on PMN and that functional active sites of HLE and CG are not required for their binding to PMN. The sulfate groups of heparan sulfate- and chondroitin sulfate-containing proteoglycans are the PMN binding sites for HLE and CG since binding of HLE and CG to PMN was inhibited by incubating PMN with 1) trypsin, chondroitinase ABC, and heparitinases, but not other glycanases, and 2) purified chondroitin sulfates, heparan sulfate, and other sulfated molecules, but not with non-sulfated glycans. Thus, heparan sulfate- and chondroitin sulfate-containing proteoglycans are low affinity, high volume PMN surface binding sites for HLE and CG, which are well suited to bind high concentrations of active serine proteinases released from degranulating PMN.

(EC 3.4.21.37) and CG (EC 3.4.21.20) are serine proteinases that are contained at millimolar concentrations in the azurophil granules of PMN and are released from PMN when they are activated to degranulate (1Owen C.A. Campbell E.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). HLE degrades extracellular matrix components, plasma proteins, cytokines, proteinase inhibitors, and cell surface receptors in vitro (1Owen C.A. Campbell E.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). CG activates angiotensin I (2Owen C.A. Campbell E.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1436-1443PubMed Google Scholar), processes cytokines (3Coeshott C. Ohnemus C. Pilyavskaya A. Ross S. Wieczorek M. Kroona H. Leimer A.H. Cheronis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Neutrophil elastase plays a critical role in host defense against Gram-negative bacteria in mice by cleaving bacterial outer membrane proteins (4Belaaouaj A. McCarthy R. Baumann M. Gao Z. Ley T.J.

Science. 2000; 289: 1185-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Neutrophil elastase also promotes airspace enlargement and the accumulation of PMN and macrophages in the lungs of mice exposed chronically to cigarette smoke (6Shapiro S.D. Goldstein N.M.

CG delays wound healing in murine skin (7Abbott R.E. Corral C.J. MacIvor D.M. Lin X. Ley T.J. Mustoe T.A. Arch. Surg. 1998; 133: 1002-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and neutrophil elastase and CG both induce immune complex-mediated inflammation in murine skin and joints (8Adkison A.M. Raptis S.Z. Kelley D.G. Pham C.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) possibly by proteolytically activating pro-inflammatory mediators. Until recently little has been known about the mechanisms by which HLE and CG mediate their activities in vivo because 1) minimal amounts of these enzymes are freely released from viable PMN activated with biologic mediators (9Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 1997; 272: 385-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5803-5810PubMed Google Scholar), 2) CG is poorly soluble in isotonic solutions (11Twumasi D.Y. Liener I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1917-1926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 3) plasma and interstitial fluids contain abundant, high affinity inhibitors of serine proteinases. However, when PMN are activated with biologic mediators, 6-fold more active HLE and active CG are expressed on the surface of PMN than are freely released by the cells (9Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 1997; 272: 385-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5803-5810PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane-bound HLE and CG have a similar spectrum of catalytic activity and efficiency as the soluble forms of the proteinases (2Owen C.A. Campbell E.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1436-1443PubMed Google Scholar, 9Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) but differ from the soluble enzymes by their resistance to inhibition by physiologic serine proteinases inhibitors (2Owen C.A. Campbell E.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1436-1443PubMed Google Scholar, 12Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Sannes P.L. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. J.

Thus, binding of HLE and CG to the surface of activated PMN not only focuses and restricts their activities to the pericellular environment but also protects them from inhibition by physiologic inhibitors by unknown mechanisms (2Owen C.A. Campbell E.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1436-1443PubMed Google Scholar, 12Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Sannes P.L. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibitor-resistant membrane-bound HLE and CG are likely to be the major bioactive extracellular forms of the proteinases contributing to tissue injury during inflammatory responses. Little is known about the mechanism by which HLE and CG bind to the plasma membrane of PMN. In the current manuscript we have investigated to which PMN plasma membrane molecules HLE and CG bind. We now report that the sulfate groups of chondroitin sulfate- and heparin sulfate-containing proteoglycans (CSPG and HSPG) in PMN plasma membranes are high volume, low affinity binding sites for HLE and CG, which are well suited to bind the millimolar concentrations of serine proteinases generated at the cell surface during PMN degranulation. Cell surface binding of HLE and CG thus arms PMN with locally active HLE and CG, which contribute important activities in health and in disease processes. Materials—Lactoferrin was purified from human breast milk (14Querinjean P. Masson P.L. Heremans J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 20: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). HLE and CG were purified from purulent sputum (15Martodam R.R. Baugh R.J. Twumasi D.Y. Liener I.E. Prep. Biochem. 1979; 9: 15-31PubMed Google Scholar). Proteinase 3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were purchased from Elastin Products Co., Inc. (Owensville, MO). Na125I was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Hanks’ balanced salt solution, RPMI 1640 medium, goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa-546®, and goat anti-murine IgG conjugated to Alexa-488® were purchased from Invitrogen. Rabbit antiserum to HLE was obtained from Athens Research and Technology (Athens, GA). Polyclonal rabbit anti-human CG and non-immune rabbit IgG were purchased from Dako Corp., Inc. (Carpinteria, CA). Protease-free chondroitinase ABC was from Proteus vulgaris, heparitinases I, II, and III were from Flavobacterium heparinum, and hyaluronidase was from Streptomyces hyalurolyticus were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Heparin-conjugated agarose beads were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (Waltham, MA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Radiolabeling of HLE and CG—125I radiolabeling of HLE and CG was achieved using the lactoperoxidase method (16Marchalonis J.J. Biochem. J. 1969; 113: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Bound 125I was separated from free 125I by gel filtration with Sephadex G25. Greater than 94% of the 125I in the labeled protein was precipitated by 20% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid. The specific activities of the 125I-labeled HLE and CG were 1020 ± 374 and 421 ± 131 cpm/nmol, respectively. Isoelectric Points (pI) of Unlabeled and Labeled HLE and CG—Determination of the pI values for labeled and unlabeled serine proteinases was performed by Kendrick Laboratories, Inc. (Madison, WI). Two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed using the carrier ampholine method of isoelectric focusing (17O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on Coomassie Blue-stained non-equilibrium pH gradient gels. Tropomyosin (Mr 33 kDa and pI 5.2) and lysozyme (Mr 14 kDa and pI 11.5) were used as internal standards along with protein Mr standards ranging from 14 to 220 kDa (Sigma). Binding of Radiolabeled HLE and CG to PMN—Human PMN (>95% pure) were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers using the Ficoll-Hypaque method (18Boyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. 1963; 21 (Suppl. 97): 77-89Google Scholar). Approval was obtained from the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Institutional Review Board for these studies. All PMN binding assays were performed at 0 °C for 90 min in quadruplicate in 400-μl microcentrifuge tubes using 106 PMN per assay in 100 μl of binding medium (RPMI containing 10 mm HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Preliminary experiments confirmed that the binding reaction reached equilibrium within 60 min, with minimal nonspecific binding of radioiodinated serine proteinases to the tubes. To minimize receptor turnover and internalization, all assays and centrifugation steps were performed at 0 °C, and all reagents were held in melting ice in a walk-in cold room. Receptor binding studies, including the separation of bound from free ligands by centrifugation through inert oil and quantification of specific and nonspecific binding of radiolabeled ligands were performed using a gamma counter as described previously (19Campbell E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6941-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). All results have been corrected for nonspecific binding of radiolabeled ligands, as described previously (19Campbell E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6941-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Dissociation and Inhibition of Receptor-mediated Binding of 125I-Labeled CG and HLE to PMN—To quantify dissociation of radiolabeled serine proteinases from PMN plasma membrane binding sites in the presence of excess unlabeled ligand, chilled PMN (106/assay) were suspended in 100 μl of binding medium containing 100 nm radiolabeled CG or HLE and incubated at 0 °C for 90 min. Cells were washed twice and resuspended in binding buffer, and radiolabeled HLE or CG bound to PMN was quantified on an aliquot of the cells (106 PMN at T =-10 min) by centrifugation through inert oil as described above. The remainder of the cells were incubated at 0 °C, and bound radiolabeled CG or HLE was quantified after 5 and 10 min on aliquots of the cells (106 PMN at T =-5 and T = 0 min, respectively). A 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled CG or HLE (20 μm) was then added to the remainder of the cells (at T = 0). At varying intervals thereafter, aliquots of the cells (106 PMN) were removed, bound and free radiolabeled ligands were separated by centrifugation through inert oil, and residual bound radiolabeled ligands were quantified. To quantify inhibition of binding of radiolabeled ligands by various putative inhibitors, PMN (106/assay) were incubated in quadruplicate in 100 μl of binding medium with 100 nm 125I-labeled HLE or CG in the presence or absence of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled HLE, CG, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)-inactivated HLE, or PMSF-inactivated CG (prepared as described previously (19Campbell E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6941-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)), PR3, MPO, or lactoferrin (LF). Porcine pancreatic trypsin, bovine serum albumin, and lysozyme were also tested at 20 μm as negative controls. In other experiments PMN were incubated with 100 nm 125I-labeled HLE or CG in the presence and absence of unlabeled, sulfated molecules (20 μm dextran sulfate, 100 μg/ml heparin sulfate, and 20 μm protamine sulfate) or unlabeled molecules lacking sulfate groups as negative controls (10 mm glutamine, glutamic acid, or arginine), and bound radiolabeled ligands were quantified. KI for Inhibition of Binding of Radiolabeled CG to PMN—PMN were incubated for 90 min at 0 °C with a saturating concentration of 125I-labeled CG (1 μm) in the presence or absence of varying concentrations (1 nm-20 μm) of unlabeled CG, unlabeled HLE, or unlabeled PR3. Residual bound labeled CG was quantified, and the IC50 for inhibition of binding of 125I-labeled CG by each unlabeled proteinase was calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using Sigmaplot (SSPS Inc., Chicago, IL). KI was calculated using the formula KI = IC50/(1 + c/KD), where c is the concentration of radiolabeled ligand, and KD is its dissociation constant. Treatment of PMN with Trypsin and Glycanases—PMN (6 × 106/ml) were preincubated for 60 min at 37 °C in the presence and absence of various enzymes: 1) porcine pancreatic trypsin (25 μg/ml in PBS, pH 7.4), 2) protease-free chondroitinase ABC (500 milliunits/ml in 0.15 m NaCl containing 0.03 m sodium acetate, pH 8.0), 3) heparitinase I, II, III (500 milliunits/ml in PBS containing 1 μm calcium acetate, pH 7.0), 5) hyaluronidase (500 milliunits/ml in 0.15 m NaCl containing 0.02 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0), and 5) neuraminidase (500 milliunits/ml in 0.15 m NaCl containing 0.02 m sodium acetate and 1 mm CaCl2, pH 6.5). As a controls, cells were also incubated with or without 1) trypsin (25 μg/ml in PBS) or chondroitinase ABC (500 milliunits/ml), both of which had been heat-inactivated (100 °C for 10 min) or 2) trypsin (25 μg/ml in PBS) inactivated with 1 mm PMSF for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice in PBS, suspended in 100 μl of Hanks’ balanced salt solution, and then incubated with HLE or CG (3 μm) for 90 min at 0 °C to permit binding of serine proteinase to PMN. Cells were then washed, fixed (with PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde), and immunostained for surface-bound HLE or CG using rabbit antiserum to HLE, non-immune rabbit serum, rabbit anti-CG IgG, or non-immune rabbit IgG as primary antibodies and goat-anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa-546® as the secondary antibody, exactly as described previously (12Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Sannes P.L. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Cells were examined using a Nikon Eclipse E8000 epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc. Cleveland, OH), and images of immunostained cells were captured using a Spot camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). Surface-bound HLE or CG was quantified in arbitrary integrated fluorescence units on 150-200 cells per group using image analysis software (Meta-Morph®, Universal Imaging Corp. West Chester, PA). The data were corrected for nonspecific staining in the presence of the non-immune control primary antibody exactly as described previously (12Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Sannes P.L. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), and the results were expressed as % binding of HLE or CG to cells incubated in the absence of glycanases or trypsin. To confirm that incubating cells with glycanases did not adversely affect cell viability, cell-free supernatant samples from cells incubated with or without trypsin or glycanases were assayed for lactate dehydrogenase activity along with extracts of untreated PMN (prepared in PBS containing 0.04% (v/v) Triton-X100) using a commercial kit (Sigma). The results for lactate dehydrogenase activity released from the cells were expressed as percent of the cellular content of lactate dehydrogenase in extracts of PMN incubated without glycanases. Double Immunostaining of Activated PMN for Surface Serine Proteinases and Chondroitin Sulfate (CS) and Heparin Sulfate (HS)—PMN were activated for 15 min with 10-7 m platelet-activating factor followed by 10-7 m formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine to induce PMN degranulation and optimal binding of HLE and CG to the surface of PMN (9Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 1997; 272: 385-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PMN were then washed, fixed, and incubated for 1 h on ice in Hanks’ balanced salt solution containing 1% human serum albumin and 50 μg/ml goat IgG to block nonspecific binding of antibodies (12Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Sannes P.L. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Cells were then immunostained with rabbit antiserum to HLE (or non-immune rabbit serum) or rabbit anti-CG IgG (or non-immune rabbit IgG) followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa-546®. Cells were then immunostained with murine anti-CS IgG1 or murine anti-HS IgG1 (or non-immune murine IgG1) followed by goat anti-murine IgG conjugated to Alexa-488®. Cells were analyzed with a Leica TCSNT confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Inc., Exton, PA) fitted with air-cooled argon and krypton lasers. Fluorescent confocal micrographs were recorded under dual fluorescent imaging mode in which cells were simultaneously exposed to 488- and 568-nm light attenuated by an acousto-tunable optical filter. A band pass (530 ± 30 nm) filter was used to select light emitted from the Alexa-488®-labeled CS or HS, and a long-pass 590 nm filter was used to detect the Alexa-546®-labeled HLE or CG. Effect of Preincubating PMN with Purified Glycans on Binding of HLE and CG to PMN—We incubated PMN for 15 min at 4 °C in Hanks’ balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with and without 250 μg/ml concentrations of the following purified glycans: 1) chondroitin sulfate-A, 2) chondroitin sulfate-B, 3) chondroitin sulfate-C, 4) heparan sulfate, 5) hyaluronic acid, 6) desulfated chondroitin, or 7) desulfated heparan. PMN were then incubated with 3 μm HLE or CG for 60 min at 4 °C and then washed and fixed using 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 5 min on ice (12Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Sannes P.L. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Bound HLE and CG were quantified by immunostaining cells with Alexa-488® for surface-bound HLE and CG and quantitative image analysis, as described above. In other experiments cells were incubated with or without purified glycans, washed twice to remove glycans, and then incubated with HLE or CG in the absence of glycans. Bound enzymes were then quantified as described above. Binding of PMN to Heparin Affinity Columns by Membrane-bound HLE and CG—Heparin-conjugated agarose bead (6-μm diameter) slurry (3 ml) was added to LC columns (Macs Miltenyi Inc. Auburn, CA), and 2 × 3 ml of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin was allowed to run through the columns to reduce nonspecific binding of cells to the columns. The following cell types (fixed as described above) were then loaded onto the columns (20 × 106 cells in 1 ml of PBS): 1) unstimulated PMN, 2) PMN optimally activated to induce cell surface expression of HLE and CG (see above and Refs. 9Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 1997; 272: 385-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 10Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5803-5810PubMed Google Scholar), or 3) lymphocytes isolated from the same healthy donor (by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation to obtain mononuclear cells followed by negative selection for lymphocytes by adherence of contaminating monocytes to tissue culture plastic overnight at 37 °C). Columns were washed with 3 × 5 ml of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and cells washed out of the columns into the eluates were counted using a hemocytometer. Data were expressed as % cells adhering to the columns. Statistics—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. or mean ± S.D. The results for paired and unpaired data were compared using Student’st test for parametric data and the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test for non-parametric data; p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Saturable and Reversible Binding of Radiolabeled HLE and CG to PMN—To gain insights into the mechanism of binding of HLE and CG to PMN, we first quantified the binding affinity and number of binding sites for HLE and CG on the surface of PMN. We incubated human PMN at 0 °C with varying concentrations of 125I-labeled HLE or CG and observed saturable binding of the radiolabeled ligands to PMN. The results of representative experiments are shown in Figs. 1, A and C, for HLE and CG, respectively. Expression of these data in the form of Scatchard plots (20Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17798) Google Scholar) allowed the binding affinity and the number of binding sites for HLE and CG to be estimated (Figs. 1, B and D, respectively). The initial convex profile of the Scatchard plots suggests co-operative binding of serine proteinases at low concentrations of labeled ligand. The mean binding affinity and mean number of binding sites from four separate experiments for HLE and CG are shown in Table 1. Binding of HLE and CG to PMN did not require divalent cations to be present in the binding medium (not shown).TABLE 1HLE and CG bind to high volume, low affinity sites on PMNLigandaPMN (106/assay) were incubated at 0 °C with varying concentrations of 125I-labeled HLE and CG, and bound and free ligand were quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The binding data were corrected for non-specific binding of ligands and then analyzed by the Scatchard method to determine the number of binding sites per cell and the binding affinity (KD) of the PMN plasma membrane sites for HLE and CG on PMN.Binding sites·cell−1KD× 10−610−7mHLE11.5 ± 0.9bData are the mean ± S.E.; n = 4 separate experiments performed in quadruplicate.5.38 ± 0.7bData are the mean ± S.E.; n = 4 separate experiments performed in quadruplicate.CG8.1 ± 2.74.36 ± 1.5a PMN (106/assay) were incubated at 0 °C with varying concentrations of 125I-labeled HLE and CG, and bound and free ligand were quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The binding data were corrected for non-specific binding of ligands and then analyzed by the Scatchard method to determine the number of binding sites per cell and the binding affinity (KD) of the PMN plasma membrane sites for HLE and CG on PMN.b Data are the mean ± S.E.; n = 4 separate experiments performed in quadruplicate. Open table in a new tab To test whether serine proteinase binding to PMN is reversible, we bound 125I-labeled CG to PMN and quantified the amount bound. We then incubated the cells with a 400-fold molar excess of unlabeled CG and, thereafter, quantified bound 125I-labeled CG at intervals. Radiolabeled CG rapidly dissociated from the cells after the addition of excess, unlabeled CG (supplemental Fig. 1). Dissociation of radiolabeled CG from PMN was ∼90% complete within 1 min of the addition of excess unlabeled CG to the cells. Radiolabeled HLE also dissociated just as rapidly from the surface of PMN upon the addition of a 400-fold molar excess of unlabeled HLE (not shown). Together, these data indicate that HLE and CG bind in a saturable and reversible manner to PMN. In addition, the PMN binding sites for HLE and CG are numerous but have relatively low affinity for these ligands. Inhibition of Binding of HLE and CG to PMN—As expected, incubation of PMN in the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled HLE or CG inhibited the binding of the same radiolabeled ligand to PMN (Fig. 2). A 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled HLE or CG also cross-inhibited the binding of radiolabeled CG and HLE, respectively, to PMN (Fig. 2). To determine whether a functional active site is required for the binding of HLE or CG to PMN, we tested the effects of proteinases inactivated with a low Mr inhibitor specific for serine proteinases which binds irreversibly to their active sites (PMSF). Incubation of PMN with a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled PMSF-inactivated HLE or unlabeled PMSF-inactivated CG also substantially abrogated the binding of radiolabeled HLE and CG, respectively, to PMN (Fig. 2). These data indicate that HLE and CG share binding sites on the PMN plasma membrane and that their binding to PMN does not require functional active sites of the enzymes. We studied the effects of other proteins contained within PMN granules (MPO, LF, and PR3) because 1) these proteins are also expressed on the surface of activated inflammatory cells (21Campbell E.J.

Unlabeled MPO, LF, and PR3 when tested at a 200-fold molar excess over radiolabeled ligands all significantly inhibited the binding of 125I-labeled HLE or CG to PMN (Fig. 2), whereas control proteins having low positive charge (trypsin) or negative charge (lysozyme (Fig. 2) or bovine serum albumin (not shown) had minimal or no effect. We determined the isoelectric points (pI) of unlabeled and labeled HLE and CG and confirmed that 1) unlabeled CG (pI > 12) is more cationic than HLE (pI = 12), as previously reported (25T"
https://openalex.org/W2106052289,"Cellular RNA metabolism has a broad range of functional aspects in cell growth and division, but its role in chromosome segregation during mitosis is only poorly understood. The Dis3 ribonuclease is a key component of the RNA-processing exosome complex. Previous isolation of the dis3-54 cold-sensitive mutant of fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe suggested that Dis3 is also required for correct chromosome segregation.We show here that the progression of mitosis is arrested in dis3-54, and that segregation of the chromosomes is blocked by activation of the mitotic checkpoint control. This block is dependent on the Mad2 checkpoint protein. Double mutant and inhibitor analyses revealed that Dis3 is required for correct kinetochore formation and function, and that this activity is monitored by the Mad2 checkpoint. Dis3 is a member of the highly conserved RNase II family and is known to be an essential subunit of the exosome complex. The dis3-54 mutation was found to alter the RNaseII domain of Dis3, which caused a reduction in ribonuclease activity in vitro. This was associated with loss of silencing of an ura4(+) reporter gene inserted into the outer repeats (otr) and central core (cnt and imr) regions of the centromere. On the other hand, centromeric siRNA maturation and formation of the RITS RNAi effector complex was normal in the dis3-54 mutant. Micrococcal nuclease assay also suggested the overall chromatin structure of the centromere was not affected in dis3-54 mutant.RNase activity of Dis3, a core subunit of exosome, was found to be required for proper kinetochore formation and establishment of kinetochore-microtubule interactions. Moreover, Dis3 was suggested to contribute to kinetochore formation through an involvement in heterochromatic silencing at both outer centromeric repeats and within the central core region. This activity is likely monitored by the mitotic checkpoint, and distinct from that of RNAi-mediated heterochromatin formation directly targeting outer centromeric repeats."
https://openalex.org/W1995595769,"An important feature of chemokines is their ability to bind to the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains of proteoglycans, predominately heparin and heparan sulfate. To date, all chemokines tested bind to immobilized heparin in vitro, as well as cell surface heparan sulfate in vitro and in vivo. These interactions play an important role in modulating the action of chemokines by facilitating the formation of stable chemokine gradients within the vascular endothelium and directing leukocyte migration, by protecting chemokines from proteolysis, by inducing chemokine oligomerization, and by facilitating transcytosis. Despite the importance of eotaxin in eosinophil differentiation and recruitment being well established, little is known about the interaction between eotaxin and GAGs and the functional consequences of such an interaction. Here we report that eotaxin binds selectively to immobilized heparin with high affinity (Kd = 1.23 × 10-8 m), but not to heparan sulfate or a range of other GAGs. The interaction of eotaxin with heparin does not promote eotaxin oligomerization but protects eotaxin from proteolysis directly by plasmin and indirectly by cathepsin G and elastase. In vivo, co-administration of eotaxin and heparin is able to significantly enhance eotaxin-mediated eosinophil recruitment in a mouse air-pouch model. Furthermore, when heparin is co-administered with eotaxin at a concentration that does not normally result in eosinophil infiltration, eosinophil recruitment occurs. In contrast, heparin does not enhance eotaxin-mediated eosinophil chemotaxis in vitro, suggesting protease protection or haptotactic gradient formation as the mechanism by which heparin enhances eotaxin action in vivo. These results suggest a role for mast cell-derived heparin in the recruitment of eosinophils, reinforcing Th2 polarization of inflammatory responses.

First, it is well established that heparan sulfate immobilizes chemokines on the luminal surface of endothelial cells (6Ley K.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7158-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) and induce chemokine oligomerization. Together, these processes can increase the local chemokine concentration and therefore enhance chemokine receptor signaling (3Hoogewerf A.J. Kuschert G.S. Proudfoot A.E. Borlat F. Clark-Lewis I.

For example, heparin and heparan sulfate protect stromal derived factor-1 (CXCL12) from degradation by the serine protease dipeptidylpeptidase IV (16Sadir R. Imberty A. Baleux F. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43854-43860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and IL-8 from elastase released by neutrophils migrating toward IL-8 (14Webb L.M.

Importantly, dipeptidylpeptidase IV is a cell-surface-expressed protease that co-distributes with CXCR4, the stromal derived factor-1 receptor, at the surface of CXCR4-expressing cells. Additionally, it has been suggested that oligomerization of chemokines through interactions with GAGs is essential for maximal chemokine activity (3Hoogewerf A.J. Kuschert G.S. Proudfoot A.E.

RANTES (CCL5), MCP-1 (CCL2), IL-8, and MIP-1α (CCL3) all bind GAGs, and this appears to increase their binding affinity for their respective receptors (3Hoogewerf A.J. Kuschert G.S. Proudfoot A.E. Borlat F. Clark-Lewis I. Power C.A. Wells T.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13570-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), whereas mutations in the GAG binding sites of the chemokines RANTES, MIP-1β (CCL4), and MCP-1 abolish their ability to induce leukocyte recruitment in vivo (18Proudfoot A.E.

Furthermore, a non-GAG binding form of RANTES is able to form non-functional heterodimers with endogenous RANTES, thereby acting as a dominant-negative inhibitor of the formation of heparan-sulfate-induced higher order oligomers. Without the formation of higher order oligomers the chemotactic activity of RANTES is seriously compromised (17Johnson Z. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Herren S. Cirillo R. Muzio V. Zaratin P. Carbonatto M.

Third, transcytosis, the process by which chemokines secreted within the tissues are actively transported across the endothelial barrier, appears to be dependent on heparan sulfate binding (6Ley K. Microcirculation. 2003; 10: 289-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Eotaxin (CCL11) was initially discovered in an attempt to identify molecules involved in the allergen-induced accumulation of eosinophils in the lung (19Jose P.J. Griffiths-Johnson D.A. Collins P.D.

Although other chemokines, such as RANTES, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4 (CCL13), and MIP-1α (20Resnick M.B. Weller P.F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1993; 8: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 21Kita H. Gleich G.J. J. Exp.

In contrast to many other chemokines, eotaxin signals exclusively through the seven transmembrane G-protein receptor, CCR3 (25Ponath P.D. Qin S. Post T.W. Wang J. Wu L. Gerard N.P. Newman W. Gerard C. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2437-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 26Daugherty B.L. Siciliano S.J. DeMartino J.A. Malkowitz L. Sirotina A. Springer M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). This, together with its eosinophil selectivity, has made eotaxin an attractive target for the development of drugs that inhibit eosinophil recruitment. Despite the importance of eotaxin in eosinophil differentiation and recruitment being well established (27Conroy D.M. Williams T.J. Respir. Res. 2001; 2: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), little is known about the interaction between eotaxin and GAGs and the functional consequences of such an interaction. In this study we investigated the ability of various GAGs to bind to eotaxin and their role in protecting eotaxin from proteolysis and enhancing eotaxin-mediated eosinophil chemotaxis. Elucidating this association is crucial in understanding the factors that regulate the recruitment and homing of eosinophils. A reduction in eosinophil trafficking would alleviate many of the pathologies associated with allergic diseases, whereas the directed targeting of eosinophils to tissues could be harnessed to eradicate parasitic infections and tumor growth. Reagents—Bovine lung heparin (H-4898), porcine intestinal mucosal heparin (H-3393), and chondroitin sulfates types A, B, and C were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and chondroitin sulfate type E was from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Porcine mucosal heparan sulfate (Org 553) was a gift from Organon BV (Oss, The Netherlands). Porcine mucosal-derived 3 ± 1-, 6 ± 7-, 10 ± 6-, and 16 ± 7-kDa heparins were a gift from Novo Nordisk (Bagsværd, Denmark). Porcine mucosal-derived 4- to 5-kDa heparin was purchased from Fluka (51549). Recombinant murine eotaxin was purchased from Peprotech (Rockyhill, NJ). Low endotoxin bovine serum albumin (A-9543) used in air-pouch experiments was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Human neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G were purchased from MP Biochemicals (Solon, OH). Human plasminogen was purified as previously described (28Jones A.L. Hulett M.D. Altin J.G. Hogg P. Parish C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38267-38276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Urokinase plasminogen activator was a gift from Phil Hogg. Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3), N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS), and 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) were purchased from Pierce. Mice—Male BALB/c wild-type and IL-5 transgenic mice were obtained from the Australian National University (ANU) Animal Services Division and housed in specific pathogen-free facilities at the John Curtin School of Medical Research, ANU. Mice were treated in accordance with ANU animal experimentation guidelines. Mice used in experiments were aged between 6 and 8 weeks. Surface Plasmon Resonance—A Biacore 2000 instrument (Pharmacia Biosensor, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to measure the binding of eotaxin to immobilized bovine lung heparin and heparin sulfate. PBS/0.0005% Tween 20/10 mm EDTA, pH 6.2 or pH 7.2 as indicated, was used as a running buffer. Biotinylated heparin (1 μg/ml) and heparan sulfate (5 μg/ml) were immobilized onto flow-cells 2 and 4, respectively, of a CM5 sensor chip (Pharmacia Biosensor) as previously described (29Freeman C. Liu L. Banwell M.G. Brown K.J. Bezos A. Ferro V. Parish C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8842-8849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For the initial direct binding studies, decreasing concentrations of recombinant eotaxin (100 nm to 1.56 nm) in running buffer were injected at a flow-rate of 40 μl/min for 5 min, and the association and dissociation phases were monitored. For the competitive binding studies, 50 nm recombinant eotaxin was co-incubated with decreasing concentrations of each GAG (500 nm to 15.6 nm) in running buffer, then injected at a flow-rate of 40 μl/min for 7.9 min. The level of eotaxin binding in the absence of GAG was set at 100%, and the percent inhibition values for each GAG were calculated relative to this level. After each eotaxin injection and binding assay, the flow-cell was regenerated by injecting 10 μl of 4 m NaCl at 5 μl/min. Flow-cells 1 and 3 were not coupled with GAGs and were used as blank control reference cells for flow-cells 2 and 4 coupled with heparin and heparan sulfate, respectively. Binding curves were analyzed using the BIAevaluation (version 4.0) program (Pharmacia Biosensor). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Speciality GAG-binding ExpranEx plates (Plasso, Sheffield, UK) were used to measure the direct binding of eotaxin to various GAGs according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the wells of a 96-well ExpranEx plate were coated with GAG (25 μg/ml) in PBS at room temperature overnight, washed with PBS/0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), then blocked at 37 °C for 1 h with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin diluted in PBS. Blocking solution was removed, recombinant mouse eotaxin (3-48 nm) was added to the wells, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature then washed with PBST. Bound eotaxin was detected using goat anti-mouse eotaxin antibody (AF-20, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), followed by a polyclonal rabbit anti-goat antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Chemicon). Plate-bound peroxidase was detected using 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and measuring the absorbance at 405 nm on a Thermomax microplate reader. Data were analyzed using SoftMax Pro software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Heparanase Treatment of Heparin—Bovine lung or porcine mucosal heparin (1 μg, Sigma) was incubated for 24 h with 40 μg of purified human platelet heparanase in 200 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.1, containing 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (30Freeman C. Parish C.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1341-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The cleaved products were filtered through a Centricon 10 microconcentrator (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and the filtrate lyophilized and then desalted using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) developed in water. Heparin in the column eluant was detected using dimethyl methylene blue (31Parish C.R. Jakobsen K.B. Coombe D.R. Bacic A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1073: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the solution lyophilized, dissolved in water, and stored at -20 °C as a 1.2 mg/ml solution. Cleavage of heparin was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide), with heparin bands being detected by toluidine blue staining. Plasmin Treatment of Eotaxin—Plasmin (20 μm) was produced by mixing plasminogen (20 μm) with urokinase plasminogen activator (20 nm) in 20 mm HEPES/0.14 m NaCl/2 mm EDTA/0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.4, and incubating at 37 °C for 1 h. Plasmin activity was determined by a chromogenic assay using the plasmin substrate H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide (S2251, Chromogenix AB, Moölndal, Sweden). Eotaxin (40 ng/sample) was mixed with either a 2-fold (120 ng/sample) or 10-fold (600 ng/sample) molar excess of heparin in a final volume of 15 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min to ensure binding. Plasmin (100 ng/sample) was then added in 5 μ l of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and the samples were reincubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Protease degradation of eotaxin was visualized by Western blotting. Briefly, samples were mixed with an equal volume of reducing sample buffer, and 30 μl was loaded onto a pre-cast 4-20% polyacrylamide gradient iGel (Gradipore, Frenchs Forest, Australia), then transferred to an Immobilon P20 membrane (Millipore). Eotaxin was detected by probing membranes with a rabbit anti-mouse eotaxin antibody (AF-20, R&D Systems), followed by a polyclonal rabbit anti-goat antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Chemicon) and developed using ELC chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). Rainbow low molecular weight markers (GE Healthcare) were used to determine the molecular weight of different bands. Cross-linking Studies—Eotaxin (500 nm) in the presence and absence of heparin (5 μm) was mixed with BS3 (24 μm) or NHS (1 mm)/EDC (0.5 mm) in a final volume of 10 μl of PBS, and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h or 30 min, respectively. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2× SDS reducing buffer, and cross-linking was visualized by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. In Vitro Chemotaxis Studies—Eosinophils were harvested from the peritoneal cavity of BALB/c IL-5 transgenic mice by washing the cavity three times with Hanks’ balanced salt solution, and purified by sorting on a BD FACS Vantage (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) based on forward and side scatter parameters and polarized light. The purity of the eosinophil enriched population was >95% as determined by differential staining with May-Grunwald Giemsa. The 3-μm polycarbonate membrane of the upper wells of a 96-well multiscreen MIC plate (Millipore) was coated with fibronectin (50 μg/ml, 37 °C, 30 min, Sigma). Following incubation, the plate was washed three times with RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) to remove unbound fibronectin. Purified eosinophils (1 × 105 cells/well) in 50 μl of RPMI/4% fetal calf serum were added to each of the upper wells of the multiscreen plate. 125 μl of agonist in RPMI/4% fetal calf serum was added to each receiver well, the plate was assembled, and the mixture was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. At the end of the assay, the upper wells were removed from the receiver plate, and the solution was aspirated to remove non-migrated cells. A known quantity of Calibrite calibration beads (BD Biosciences) was added to each bottom well before harvesting to allow determination of the cell number. 125 μ l of 5 mm EDTA in PBS was added to the receiver wells, the plate was reassembled, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The plate was then shaken gently to dislodge any migrated cells from the underside of the polycarbonate membrane and any cells adhered to the receiver well. The detached cells were combined with the solution initially removed from the receiver wells and resuspended in 2% paraformaldehyde. The number of migrated cells in each well was quantified by flow cytometry as a function of the ratio of Calibrite beads to live cells. Cell migration was calculated as the percentage of input cells. Air-pouch Studies—Air-pouch studies to determine eotaxin-induced migration of eosinophils in vivo, with and without heparin, were performed in wild-type BALB/c mice as previously described (32Lawman M.J. Boyle M.D. Gee A.P. Young M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 69: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33Mould A.W. Matthaei K.I. Young I.G. Foster P.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1064-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, the dorsal skin was shaved, and 150 μl of air, followed by 100 μl of eotaxin (1-5 pmol/site), heparin (5-10 pmol/site), a combination of both, or control vehicle (Hanks’ balanced salt solution/0.01% bovine serum albumin) in the same syringe, was injected subcutaneously. After 6 h, the mice were sacrificed, the skin around the air-pouch excised, and the dorsal skin membrane was transferred to a slide. Slides were fixed in methanol before staining with chromotrope to determine the level of eosinophilia. Eosinophils/field were determined by counting 10 fields of view (400× magnification). Statistical Significance—Statistical significance was measure using the Mann-Whitney test performed using InStat (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Characterization of the Interaction between Eotaxin and Various GAGs—Many chemokines have been shown to bind to GAGs, in particular heparin and heparan sulfate, but with varying affinity (1Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Crown S.E. Lau E.K. Proudfoot A.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 385-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 2Kuschert G.S. Coulin F. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E. Hubbard R.E.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13570-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Recently it has been suggested that the specificity with which individual chemokines bind various GAGs may fine-tune chemokine function and provide another level of regulation of chemokine action (34Johnson Z. Proudfoot A.E. Handel T.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We used SPR to measure the interaction of the eosinophil specific chemokine, eotaxin, with heparin and heparan sulfate. At both pH 6.2 and 7.2 soluble recombinant murine eotaxin bound to immobilized bovine lung heparin in a concentration-dependent manner, but did not bind at any concentration (12.5-100 nm) to immobilized heparan sulfate (pH 6.2 data are in Fig. 1A; pH 7.2 data not shown). Kinetic analysis of the association and dissociation phases of the sensorgrams using the BIAevaluation software revealed that eotaxin binds to heparin with a high affinity, exhibiting an equilibrium binding constant (KA) of 8.14 × 107 m and an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 1.23 × 10-8 m at pH 6.2 (Fig. 1B). Following correction for mass transfer effects, binding of eotaxin to heparin fitted a Langmuir (1:1) binding model, indicating that one molecule of eotaxin binds to one molecule of heparin. Similar kinetics were observed for the binding of eotaxin to immobilized heparin at pH 7.2, exhibiting a KA of 3.66 × 107 m and a KD of 2.73 × 10-8 m (data not shown). Most chemokines bind to both heparin and heparan sulfate (1Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Crown S.E. Lau E.K. Proudfoot A.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 385-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The observation that eotaxin binds exclusively to heparin and not to heparan sulfate, led us to investigate the interaction of eotaxin with other GAGs by performing a series of competitive inhibition experiments (Fig. 2A). As expected, soluble heparin completely inhibited eotaxin (50 nm) binding to immobilized heparin with an IC50 of 25.5 nm (Table 1). In contrast, none of the other GAGs tested completely inhibited eotaxin binding, even at the highest concentration (500 nm) tested. Nevertheless, weak inhibitory activity was observed with chondroitin sulfate E > heparan sulfate > chondroitin sulfate B, whereas chondroitin sulfates A and C were inactive. Additionally, the direct binding of eotaxin to GAGs was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using EpranEx GAG-binding plates (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the SPR analysis, eotaxin exhibited the strongest binding to immobilized heparin, followed by chondroitin sulfate E and chondroitin sulfate B, but did not bind to immobilized heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfates A and C. Coating of wells with biotinylated heparin and heparan sulfate demonstrated equal binding of the GAGs to the wells, suggesting that this was not the reason for lack of eotaxin binding to the heparan sulfate-treated wells (data not shown). Collectively, these data suggest an unusually high preference of eotaxin for binding to heparin compared with other GAG molecules.TABLE 1IC50 values for the binding of various GAGs to eotaxinCompoundSourceMolecular massIC50aConcentration of GAG that inhibited cotaxin binding to immobilized heparin by 50%.kDanmHeparinBL12.525.6Heparan sulfatePM22250Chondroitin sulfate Type ABovine trachea34>500Chondroitin sulfate Type BPM32350Chondroitin sulfate Type CShark cartilage64>500Chondroitin sulfate Type ESquid cartilage70125a Concentration of GAG that inhibited cotaxin binding to immobilized heparin by 50%.

https://openalex.org/W1982871054,"Free fatty acid (FFA) is believed to be a major environmental factor linking obesity to Type II diabetes. We have recently reported that FFA can induce gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38). In this study, we have investigated the role of p38 in oleate-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Our results show that a prolonged treatment of primary hepatocytes with oleate blunted insulin suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis, and decreased insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt in a p38-dependent manner. Reduction of the insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation by oleate correlated with activation of p38. In the presence of p38 inhibition, prolonged exposure of hepatocytes to oleate failed to reduce insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt. An siRNA against p38α prevented oleate suppression of the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt. Furthermore, a prolonged exposure of hepatocytes to oleate decreased insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1/2, while slightly increasing serine phosphorylation of IRS. The decrease of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1/2 in hepatocytes by oleate was reversed by the inhibition of p38. We further show that a prolonged exposure of primary hepatocytes to oleate elevated the protein level of the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) gene in a p38-dependent manner, but had no effect on the mRNA level of PTEN. Knocking down the PTEN gene prevented oleate to inhibit insulin activation of Akt and insulin suppression of gluconeogenesis. Together, results from this study demonstrate a critical role for p38 in oleate-induced hepatic insulin resistance.

Plasma levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) 2The abbreviations used are: FFA, free fatty acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ANOVA, analysis of variance; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PKC, protein kinase C. 2The abbreviations used are: FFA, free fatty acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ANOVA, analysis of variance; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PKC, protein kinase C. are usually increased in obese subjects, and FFAs are considered as a causative link between obesity and Type II diabetes (1Baldeweg S.E.

A consequence of increased levels of FFA is insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is not only a strong risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (4Kelley D.E. Mandarino L.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 6Boden G. Life Sci. 2003; 72: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but may also eventually lead to Type II diabetes (7Boden G. Curr. Diab. Rep. 2006; 6: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), which is currently a major health problem of industrialized countries and tends to increase in its incidence and economic cost because of the increasing trend of obesity. Insulin resistance in liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscles plays a central role in the development of Type II diabetes. Specifically, insulin resistance in liver leads to an increased glucose production from hepatic gluconeogenesis, while insulin resistance in adipose tissue and skeletal muscles decreases uptake, utilization, and storage of glucose in these tissues (8Lam T.K. Yoshii H. Haber C.A. Bogdanovic E. Lam L. Fantus I.G. Giacca A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 283: E682-E691Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 9Lam T.K. Carpentier A. Lewis G.F. van de Werve G. Fantus I.G. Giacca A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 284: E863-E873Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). When insulin production from pancreatic islets fails to overcome the insulin resistance, hyperglycemia ensues to announce the presence of frank Type II diabetes. Hepatic insulin resistance is a powerful promoter of glucose production from liver through gluconeogenesis. The unrestrained hepatic gluconeogenesis is a major contributor to hyperglycemia in both Types I and II diabetes (10Accili D. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Hyperglycemia can damage every organ system by inflaming and clogging blood vessels, which consequently results in heart attacks, strokes, renal failure, blindness, and amputations (11Brownlee M. Metabolism. 2000; 49: 9-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 12Hirsch I.B. Brownlee M. J. Diabetes Complications. 2005; 19: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), etc. Equally important, hepatic insulin resistance causes hyperlipidemia, which can further lead to or aggravate global insulin resistance and directly contributes to the development of cardiovascular disorders and other complications related to diabetes (8Lam T.K. Yoshii H. Haber C.A. Bogdanovic E. Lam L. Fantus I.G. Giacca A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 283: E682-E691Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 10Accili D. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Hepatic insulin resistance is tightly correlated with plasma levels of FFA. For example, chronic elevation of plasma FFA in obesity is almost always accompanied by hepatic insulin resistance (7Boden G. Curr. Diab. Rep. 2006; 6: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 8Lam T.K. Yoshii H. Haber C.A. Bogdanovic E. Lam L. Fantus I.G. Giacca A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 283: E682-E691Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Acute increase of plasma levels of FFA via lipid infusion can also lead to hepatic insulin resistance (8Lam T.K. Yoshii H. Haber C.A. Bogdanovic E. Lam L. Fantus I.G. Giacca A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 283: E682-E691Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 13Boden G. She P. Mozzoli M. Cheung P. Gumireddy K. Reddy P. Xiang X. Luo Z. Ruderman N. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 3458-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which FFA induces hepatic insulin resistance has been intensively studied, but much remains undetermined. Elevation of plasma FFA levels is known to activate a series of stress- and inflammation-related kinases, including at least JNK, IKKβ/NF-κB, PKC, and p38 (14Evans J.L. Goldfine I.D. Maddux B.A. Grodsky G.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 599-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). All these kinase systems have been shown to be able to mediate fat-induced insulin resistance in various cellular and tissue types (14Evans J.L. Goldfine I.D. Maddux B.A. Grodsky G.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 599-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar, 15Muoio D.M. Newgard C.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 367-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). For example, deletion of the JNK1 gene in mouse models (JNK-/-) can slow down high fat diet-induced global insulin resistance (16Hirosumi J. Tuncman G. Chang L. Gorgun C.Z. Uysal K.T. Maeda K. Karin M. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 2002; 420: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar). The predominant alteration in JNK1-/- mice is the reduced adipose depot, indicating that the primary tissue affected by JNK is adipose tissue, but not liver (16Hirosumi J. Tuncman G. Chang L. Gorgun C.Z. Uysal K.T. Maeda K. Karin M. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 2002; 420: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar). Deletion of the IKKβ gene from liver can also prevent high fat diet-induced global and hepatic insulin resistance, while liver-specific expression of the IKKβ gene can promote high fat diet-induced hepatic and global insulin resistance (17Cai D. Yuan M. Frantz D.F. Melendez P.A. Hansen L. Lee J. Shoelson S.E. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1795) Google Scholar, 18Arkan M.C. Hevener A.L. Greten F.R. Maeda S. Li Z.W.

Therefore, it is clear that the IKKβ/NF-κB signaling pathway can play a role in fat-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Some PKC isoforms such as PKCɛ has been shown to be able to mediate FFA-induced insulin resistance in adipocytes (19Gao Z. Zhang X. Zuberi A. Hwang D. Quon M.J. Lefevre M. Ye J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2024-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). FFA can activate PKCδ in isolated hepatocytes and liver (13Boden G. She P. Mozzoli M. Cheung P. Gumireddy K. Reddy P.

Diabetes. 2005; 54: 3458-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and FFA-induced decrease of insulin binding in hepatocytes (21Chen S. Lam T.K. Park E. Burdett E. Wang P.Y. Wiesenthal S.R. Lam L. Tchipashvili V. Fantus I.G. Giacca A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 346: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Finally, p38 has been shown to mediate FFA-induced insulin resistance in various cell types (22Fujishiro M. Gotoh Y. Katagiri H. Sakoda H. Ogihara T. Anai M. Onishi Y. Ono H. Abe M. Shojima N.

Diabetes. 2006; 55: 2301-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), but its role in hepatic insulin resistance is unclear. Because desaturation of saturated FFAs such as stearate into monounsaturated oleate by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) is necessary for the onset of high fat diet-induced hepatic insulin resistance (26Gutierrez-Juarez R. Pocai A. Mulas C. Ono H. Bhanot S. Monia B.P. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 1686-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and oleate is the most abundant FFA in the plasma (27de Almeida I.T. Cortez-Pinto H. Fidalgo G. Rodrigues D. Camilo M.E. Clin. Nutr. 2002; 21: 219-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 28Bysted A. Holmer G. Lund P. Sandstrom B. Tholstrup T. Eur. J. Clin. Nutr. 2005; 59: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we have investigated the role of p38 in oleate-induced insulin resistance in isolated hepatocytes in this study. Our results show that a prolonged exposure of primary hepatocytes to oleate can blunt insulin suppression of hepatic glucose production via gluconeogenesis through p38. We further show that oleate can activate p38 in isolated hepatocytes, and activation of p38 is required for oleate to reduce insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1/2. Finally, we have observed that PTEN plays a critical role in oleate-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Reagents—Oleate and palmitate, fatty acid-free albumin from bovine serum, antibody against phospho-IRS-1(Tyr896), and the ascites fluid containing the anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody were from Sigma-Aldrich. Antibodies against total/phospho-p38, total/phospho-Akt, total/phospho-PTEN, and phosphotyrosine (p-Tyr-100) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Antibodies against insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) (C-20) and IRS-2 (H-205) and the siRNA against p38α and the scrambled siRNA were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibody against phosphoserine/threonine (clone 22a) was from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). SB202190 and SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem. The siRNA against PTEN (cat. no. 15034) and related scrambled siRNA (cat. no. 4635) were from Ambion (Austin, TX). Lipofectamine™ 2000 Transfection Reagents were from Invitrogen. Both lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay kit and Cell Death Detection ELISAplus kit were from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN). Other materials were all obtained commercially and are of analytical quality. Isolation of Hepatocytes—Primary hepatocytes were isolated from C57BL/6 mice as previously described (20Collins Q.F.

All mice used in the present study for isolation of hepatocytes were fed normal chow diet under a regular schedule unless otherwise noted. Briefly, under anesthesia with pentobarbital (IP, 50 mg/kg body weight), livers were perfused with Ca2+-free Hanks’ Balanced Solution (Invitrogen) at 5 ml/min for 8 min, followed by continuous perfusion with serum-free Williams’ Medium E containing collagenase (Worthington, Type II, 50 units/ml) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES for 12 min. Hepatocytes were harvested and purified with Percoll. The viability of hepatocytes was examined with trypan blue exclusion. Only cell isolates with viability over 95% were used. Hepatocytes were inoculated into collagen-coated plates (5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and 1.25 × 105 cell per well in 24-well plates) in Williams’ Medium E with 10% FBS, and were incubated for 24 h before experimentation. All studies were approved by The Hamner Institutes for Health Sciences Animal Care and Use Committee and complied with guidelines from the United States National Institutes of Health. Oleate Preparation and Treatment—Oleate was freshly prepared from a 50 mm stock solution in methanol. Specifically, 0.5 mm oleate and 0.1 mm BSA were added to the pre-warmed culture media (37 °C), and mixed by vortexing for 1 min. The media with both oleate and BSA was then used to replace the media in the cell culture immediately. Lower concentrations of oleate/BSA were prepared by adding an equal volume of prewarmed media. BSA was prepared from a 10× stock solution. Equal amounts of methanol were added into the control cells in each experiment. Measurement of Glucose Production in Primary Hepatocytes—Primary hepatocytes were isolated from mice, which had been fasted for 24 h to deplete glycogen in liver. Glucose production from primary hepatocytes were measured as previously described (20Collins Q.F. Xiong Y. Lupo J.E.J. Liu H.Y. Cao W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24336-24344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 31Zhou H. Song X. Briggs M. Violand B. Salsgiver W. Gulve E.A. Luo Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in Williams’ Medium E supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5 mm oleate for 16 h, and were then washed three times with warm PBS to remove glucose. Subsequently, cells were pretreated with insulin, followed by stimulation with cAMP/dexamethasome in glucose-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing gluconeogenic substrates (2 mm sodium pyruvate). Glucose concentrations were determined with a glucose assay kit from Roche Applied Science (cat. no. 0716251) and normalized to protein concentrations. The total glucose production was derived from both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Glucose production from glycogenolysis was measured in the absence of a gluconeogenic substrate. The amount of glucose production by gluconeogenesis is defined as the difference between total glucose production and glycogenolysis. Apoptosis Assay—Using a Cell Death Detection ELISAplus kit, levels of cellular apoptosis were quantified by measuring cytoplasmic DNA-histone nucleosome complexes generated during apoptotic DNA fragmentation. In brief, hepatocytes were incubated with oleate or palmitate for 16 h as noted, and then were lysed with the lysis buffer provided by the assay kit. The supernatants of the lysates were incubated with biotinylated antibodies against histone and peroxidase (POD)-labeled antibodies against DNA in streptavidin-coated microplates for 2 h. Plates were washed to remove unbound lysates and antibodies. The 2,2′-azino-di[3-ethylbenzthia-zoline sulfonate diammonium salt was then added. POD activity (apoptosis) was quantified at 405 nm against A490 (blank). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin (32Liu H.Y.

Cell lysates (15 μg per lane) were resolved in 10% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were mixed with the indicated antibody and protein G-agarose at 4 °C overnight, followed by extensive washes with lysis buffer twice and PBS once. Precipitated proteins were released by heating the protein sample buffer at 75 °C for 5 min (32Liu H.Y. MacDonald J.I. Hryciw T. Li C. Meakin S.O. J. Biol.

Proteins were subsequently resolved in 4–20% Tris glycine gels, and detected by immunoblotting with primary antibodies as indicated and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antisera. The fluorescent bands were visualized with Typhoon 9410 variable mode Imager from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ), and then quantified by densitometry analysis using ImageQuant 5.2 software from Molecular Dynamics (Piscataway, NJ). Gene Silencing with siRNA—The cognate siRNA against p38α or PTEN and scrambled siRNA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Ambion, and were introduced into primary mouse hepatocytes by reverse transfection with Lipofectamine™ 2000 Transfection Reagents. Briefly, the siRNA transfection mixture was applied to collagen-coated 6-well plates right before the plating of primary hepatocytes in culture media without antibiotics. After 24–48 h, cells were treated with oleate together with BSA for 16 h prior to the treatment with insulin as noted. Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from hepatocytes with an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. The cDNA was quantified by TaqMan® Real-time PCR with specific probes and primers from Applied Biosciences, and normalized to levels of GAPDH. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Data were compared by Student’s t test or one-way ANOVA analysis using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 for Windows (San Diego, CA). Differences at values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Prolonged Exposure of Hepatocytes to Oleate Blunts Insulin Suppression of Gluconeogenesis in a p38-dependent Manner—Insulin is the predominant suppressor of hepatic gluconeogenesis, and this suppression is blunted in type II diabetes (reviewed in Refs. 10Accili D.

It is known that plasma levels of FFA in diabetes are almost always increased, and FFA can induce insulin resistance in various cell types (22Fujishiro M. Gotoh Y. Katagiri H. Sakoda H. Ogihara T.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, the direct role of FFA in the development of insulin resistance in isolated hepatocytes has not been defined. Oleate is the most abundant FFA in the plasma (27de Almeida I.T. Cortez-Pinto H. Fidalgo G. Rodrigues D. Camilo M.E. Clin. Nutr. 2002; 21: 219-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 28Bysted A. Holmer G. Lund P. Sandstrom B. Tholstrup T. Eur. J. Clin. Nutr. 2005; 59: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and conversion of the saturated FFA such as stearate into monounsaturated FFA (oleate) by SCD-1 is required for high fat diet to induce hepatic insulin resistance (26Gutierrez-Juarez R. Pocai A. Mulas C. Ono H. Bhanot S. Monia B.P. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 1686-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose to study the role of oleate in the development of hepatic insulin resistance. As shown in Fig. 1A, insulin failed to efficiently inhibit the glucose production via gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes exposed to oleate for 16 h, while insulin completely inhibited the glucose production via gluconeogenesis stimulated by cAMP/dexamethasone in control cells. These results suggest that oleate can induce insulin resistance in isolated hepatocytes. Because previous studies have suggested a role for p38 in fat-induced insulin resistance in vivo (41Bouzakri K. Roques M. Gual P. Espinosa S. Guebre-Egziabher F. Riou J.P. Laville M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 7727-7736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and we have previously described a role for p38 in FFA-induced hepatic gluconeogenesis (20Collins Q.F. Xiong Y. Lupo J.E.J. Liu H.Y. Cao W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24336-24344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we examined the role of p38 in oleate-induced hepatic insulin resistance. As shown in Fig. 1B, a preincubation of hepatocytes with a p38 inhibitor, SB203580, significantly reduced the capability of oleate to blunt the insulin suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis. These results indicate that p38 plays a critical role in oleate induction of hepatic insulin resistance. To examine whether the exposure to oleate was toxic to hepatocytes, levels of LDH release and apoptosis in hepatocytes were measured. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, oleate did not cause significant cytotoxicity and apoptosis at concentrations lower than 1 mm while palmitate caused obvious toxicity and apoptosis at concentrations higher than 0.2 mm. Prolonged Exposure of Primary Hepatocytes to Oleate Decreases Insulin-induced Activation of Akt—Insulin suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis through activation of Akt (reviewed in Refs. 10Accili D. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar and 44Cohen P. Nat Rev Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism by which oleate blunted insulin suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis, isolated primary hepatocytes were incubated with increasing amount of oleate for 16 h, followed by treatment with insulin for 15 min. Levels of Akt phosphorylation were then measured. As shown in Fig. 2, insulin stimulated phosphorylation of Akt as expected, and this stimulation was decreased by the prolonged incubation with oleate in a dose-dependent manner. Together, these results indicate that a prolonged exposure to oleate can decrease insulin-induced activation of Akt in hepatocytes. Oleate Stimulates p38 Phosphorylation in Primary Hepatocytes—Previous studies have shown that p38 mediates FFA-induced insulin resistance in several non-hepatocyte cell types (22Fujishiro M. Gotoh Y.

Diabetes. 2006; 55: 2301-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and we have recently shown that FFA can activate p38 in primary hepatocytes (20Collins Q.F. Xiong Y. Lupo J.E.J. Liu H.Y. Cao W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24336-24344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that p38 might play a role in oleate-induced hepatic insulin resistance. To test this hypothesis, primary hepatocytes were treated with increasing amount of oleate in the presence or absence of insulin, followed by measurements of p38 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 3, p38 phosphorylation was increased by oleate, and the effect was not influenced by insulin. Insulin itself did not initiate detectable phosphorylation of p38. p38 Mediates Oleate Suppression of Insulin-induced Activation of Akt—To determine whether the function of oleate in blunting insulin-induced activation of Akt is linked to oleate activation of p38, we took the advantage of chemical inhibitors of p38. Both SB203580 and SB202190 are potent and cell-permeable inhibitors of p38, and they do not suppress other MAP kinases including ERK1/2 and JNK even at 100 μm (45Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C.

https://openalex.org/W2054570074,"Rice growth under aerobic and anaerobic conditions allowed aspects of mitochondrial biogenesis to be identified as dependent on or independent of an oxygen signal. Analysis of transcripts encoding mitochondrial components found that a subset of these genes respond to oxygen (defined as aerobic), whereas others are relatively unaffected by oxygen availability. Mitochondria formed during growth in anaerobic conditions had reduced protein levels of tricarboxylic acid cycle components and cytochrome-containing complexes of the respiratory chain and repressed respiratory functionality. In general, the capacity of the general import pathway was found to be significantly lower in mitochondria isolated from tissue grown under anaerobic conditions, whereas the carrier import pathway capacity was not affected by changes in oxygen availability. Transcript levels of genes encoding components of the protein import apparatus were generally not affected by the absence of oxygen, and their protein abundance was severalfold higher in mitochondria isolated from anaerobically grown tissue. However, both transcript and protein abundances of the subunits of the mitochondrial processing peptidase, which in plants is integrated into the cytochrome bc1 complex, were repressed under anaerobic conditions. Therefore, in this system, an increase in import capacity is correlated with an increase in the abundance of the cytochrome bc1 complex, which is ultimately dependent on the presence of oxygen, providing a link between the respiratory chain and protein import apparatus.

Mitochondria are best known for their role in respiration and ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation, a process that inherently requires the presence of oxygen. Detailed molecular studies have begun to show that changes in oxygen levels are incorporated into transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms in cells and have a profound effect on mitochondrial function and biogenesis. Most of these studies examining eukaryotic responses to oxygen deficit have been performed using the facultative anaerobe, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), where growth under aerobic and anaerobic conditions is associated with changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure and respiratory activity (1Plattner H. Salpeter M.M. Saltzgaber J. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 1252-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 2Rosenfeld E. Schaeffer J. Beauvoit B. Salmon J.M. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2004; 85: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Studies using the yeast system and examining oxygen-regulated gene expression have resulted in genes being classified based on their transcriptional response to oxygen levels. Hypoxic genes are transcribed optimally under anaerobic conditions, whereas aerobic genes are transcribed optimally under aerobic conditions (3Poyton R.O. Respir. Physiol. 1999; 115: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, many of the aerobic genes identified and examined in yeast encode mitochondrial electron transport chain components, whereas other mitochondrial components, such as subunits of the protein import apparatus, are not oxygen-responsive at the transcript level (4Tai S.L.

Considerable progress has been made in understanding the regulation of these hypoxic and aerobic genes, revealing a complex interaction between transcription factors that are ultimately dependent on feedback regulation by heme, whose synthesis in the cell is dependent on the availability of molecular oxygen (7Zhang L. Hach A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Studies in yeast have also focused on the expression of subunits of the heme-containing cytochrome c oxidase complex, and a role for this enzyme in oxygen sensing has been proposed (8Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Staahl B.T. Poyton R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5446-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In contrast to the situation in yeast, an understanding of how multicellular organisms respond to anaerobic conditions is limited. Many eukaryotes require oxygen for survival; therefore, studies investigating the effect of oxygen deprivation are challenging, since the viability of the organism of interest is usually compromised by the experimental conditions. However, some plants show substantial tolerance to anaerobic conditions. The most well known is rice, which is able to germinate and grow for days in the absence of oxygen (9Mustroph A. Albrecht G.

Historically, research into the effects of oxygen deprivation on mitochondria in plants has focused on ultrastructural changes to the appearance of these organelles and have shown that mitochondrial ultrastructure is maintained in anoxia-tolerant plant species, whereas a breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane structure is seen in cells of anoxia-intolerant species (12Vartapetian B.B.

Studies investigating the effect of oxygen deficit on mitochondrial function, in relatively mature rice tissues, have focused on changes in the abundance and activity of respiratory chain complexes and tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes (11Vartapetian B.B.

Chem. 2004; 279: 39471-39478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Notably, a lack of heme-containing respiratory chain components in mitochondria isolated from tissue grown under anaerobic conditions and a rapid production of these components during reaeration has been shown (16Millar A.H. Trend A.E. Heazlewood J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39471-39478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which appears to be analogous to the heme-linked oxygen response investigated in yeast and animals. However, although these studies show the final result of anaerobic or aerobic growth in rice, they have not specifically probed the nature of the oxygen-dependent events in transcriptional activation and mitochondrial biogenesis that produce these outcomes in plants. Further, specific differences exist between yeast and plants in terms of the heme synthesis pathway and the composition of the mitochondrial heme-containing respiratory complexes. First, the reactions culminating in heme synthesis occur in plastids and the cytosol in plants linking both chlorophyll and heme production (17Cornah J.E. Terry M.J. Smith A.G. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 224-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Second, the mitochondrial processing peptidase, which is essential for removal of presequences from imported proteins, is incorporated into the heme-containing cytochrome bc1 complex of the respiratory chain in plants (18Braun H.P.

We have previously established a system for examining mitochondrial biogenesis during rice germination and early seedling development under normal growth conditions (25Howell K.A. Millar A.H. Whelan J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 60: 201-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), where we have found that the maturation of mitochondria is facilitated by high levels of protein import components already present in promitochondria within the dry seed and which is driven by oxidation of external NADH allowing for the rapid resumption of respiratory and metabolic functions to support early seedling establishment. In this study, we have examined the difference between rice germination and early growth under anaerobic and aerobic conditions to understand the transcriptional oxygen response of genes for plant mitochondrial proteins. We have followed the impact of these changes on mitochondrial biogenesis through a series of events leading from the differential transcriptional response, to altered operation of the general and carrier protein import apparatus, to the selective accumulation of the mitochondrial proteome. Plant Material—Dehulled, sterilized rice seeds (Oryza sativa cv. Amaroo) were germinated in the dark, submerged in rice growth media (0.5 mm MES, 3The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HSP, heat shock protein; LEA, late embryogenesis abundant; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; PiC, phosphate carrier; RISP, Rieske iron-sulfur protein; SOM, self-organizing map; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino} ethanesulfonic acid; MS, mass spectrometry. 0.5 mm CaCl2, pH 6.5) with carbenicillin (6 mg/liter), and incubated at 30 °C. Flasks were continuously bubbled with air or nitrogen, to generate aerobic or anaerobic conditions, respectively, using spargers below the water level. For electron microscopy, mitochondrial isolation, and nucleic acid isolation, rice embryos were manually dissected from grains. Electron Microscopy—Rice embryos were fixed in 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.05 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for 24 h, postfixed with 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in an ethanol series and embedded in Spurr's resin. Thin sections (60–100 nm) of shoot apex tissue were prepared using glass knives and a semiautomatic ultramicrotome (Reichert-Jung, Vienna, Austria), collected on copper grids, poststained with uranyl acetate (1% (w/v) and lead citrate) (26Reynolds E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (17782) Google Scholar) and examined using a JEOL 2000FX-II transmission electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan). Mitochondrial Isolation—Mitochondria were isolated from rice embryos using a modified mitochondrial isolation protocol, as described previously (25Howell K.A. Millar A.H. Whelan J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 60: 201-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Yields of mitochondrial protein were determined using the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Respiratory Measurements—For respiratory measurements on isolated mitochondria, 80–200 μg of mitochondrial protein was added to 600 μl of reaction medium (0.3 m mannitol, 10 mm TES, 5 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5), and oxygen consumption was measured at 25 °C in a Clarke-type oxygen electrode. The following reagents and inhibitors were added to the reaction medium to examine mitochondrial function: ATP (0.3 mm), succinate (5 mm), ADP (0.25 mm), NADH (1.5 mm), myxothiazol (5 μm), nPG (50 μm), ascorbate (10 mm), cytochrome c (50 μm), Triton X-100 (0.05%, w/v), and KCN (1 mm). Western Blotting and Immunodetection—Mitochondrial protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (10 μg/lane), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed using antibodies raised to mitochondrial proteins. The F1α subunit of ATP synthase, HSP70, the E1α subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH), and the outer mitochondrial membrane voltage-dependent anion channel were identified with monoclonal antibodies raised to maize mitochondrial proteins (Dr. Tom Elthon, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE). Lipoic acid attached to the acyltransferases (E2) in 2-oxoglutarate and pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes was detected with a polyclonal antibody raised against lipoic acid (27Humphries K.M. Szweda L.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15835-15841Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Antibodies raised against cytochrome c, Cox2 (cytochrome oxidase subunit 2) and HSP60 were purchased from BD Biosciences PharMingen, Agrisera (Stockholm, Sweden) and StressGen (Victoria, Canada), respectively. The Rieske iron-sulfur protein (RISP) was detected using an anti-tobacco RISP antibody (Dr. Dean Price, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia). TOM20 (translocase of the outer membrane subunit of 20 kDa) was detected using an antibody raised against the Arabidopsis TOM20-3 isoform (28Taylor N.L. Rudhe C. Hulett J.M. Lithgow T. Glaser E. Day D.A. Millar A.H. Whelan J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Immunoreaction was detected using the BM luminescence Western blotting kit (Roche Applied Science) and visualized using a LAS 1000 (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). Cloning and Generation of Quantitative PCR Standards—For each gene of interest, a complete or partial fragment was amplified from rice cDNA or genomic DNA using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) and cloned into the pCR2.1®-TOPO® vector using the TOPO TA cloning® kit (Invitrogen). Primers used to clone genes have been previously described (25Howell K.A. Millar A.H. Whelan J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 60: 201-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and for MPPα (mitochondrial processing peptidase) (Os01g09560), MPPβ (Os03g11410), and Adh1 (alcohol dehydrogenase) (Os11g10480) included the following (5′–3′): MPPα-FWD, CTTGATTGGGAAGTCAAGG; MPPα-REV, TCATTTCGAGCGAAACTTGC; MPPβ-FWD, CTACTATGCCAAAGTACTCG; MPPβ-REV, CTAGTAACGGAGCATGTAGG; Adh1-FWD, ATGGCGACAGCGGGAAAGG; Adh1-REV, CCAGCCATCATGAACACATTC. Linear standards for real-time PCR were prepared as previously described (29Murcha M.W. Lister R. Ho A.Y. Whelan J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1737-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Nucleic Acid Isolation and cDNA Preparation—Total RNA was isolated from rice embryos using the RNeasy® Plant Mini Protocol (Qiagen, Clifton Hill, Australia) in combination with the RNase-free DNase Set (Qiagen) and the DNA-free™ kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Three independent RNA preparations were performed for each developmental stage/growth condition, and the concentration of RNA was determined spectrophotometrically. cDNA was prepared from 1 μg of total RNA, in duplicate, using random primers (p(dN)6, 100 pmol; Roche Applied Science) and Expand Reverse Transcriptase (Roche Applied Science). cDNA samples were purified using the QIAquick® PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and diluted 1:10 with water and with a final concentration of 0.008% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Quantitative PCR Analysis—Quantitative PCR was performed using the iCycler instrument with iQ™ SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), using 25-μl reaction volumes, under conditions optimized to minimize primer-dimer formation and maximize amplification efficiency. To determine changes in transcript abundance, cDNA generated from total RNA isolated from rice embryos was used as a template. For SOM analysis of transcript profiles using GeneCluster 2.0 (version 2.1.7; available on the World Wide Web at www.broad.mit.edu/cancer/software/genecluster2/gc2.html) (59Tamayo P. Slonim D. Mesirov J. Zhu Q. Kitareewan S. Dmitrovsky E. Lander E.S. Golub T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sequences of all primers used for quantitative PCR have been previously described (25Howell K.A. Millar A.H. Whelan J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 60: 201-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and for MPPα, MPPβ, and Adh1 included the following (5′–3′): Q-MPPα-FWD, GAAACTGAAGGCAGAGCTTGC; Q-MPPα-REV, GGAGCAGTGTAATTCTCAGC; Q-MPPβ-FWD, GTTATTCTGCGAGAGATGG; Q-MPPβ-REV, GTGATAACCATTCTAGGAGC; Q-Adh1-FWD, GTTTGCGTTCTTAGCTGTGG; Q-Adh1-REV, CAAATCTGTTGGCGTTCAGG. Two-dimensional Gel Separation—Rice embryo mitochondrial samples (250 μg) were acetone precipitated and isoelectric focusing/SDS-PAGE analysis was carried out as previously described (30Millar A.H. Sweetlove L.J. Giege P. Leaver C.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1711-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) using nonlinear pH 3–10 isoelectric focusing strips. Gels were stained using colloidal Coomassie (17% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, 34% (v/v) methanol, 3% (v/v) phosphoric acid, 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250) and destained using 0.5% (v/v) phosphoric acid to visualize protein spots. Gels were scanned using a 12-bit transparency scanner (Image Scanner; Amersham Biosciences). Protein spots were excised and prepared for mass spectrometry as previously described (30Millar A.H. Sweetlove L.J. Giege P. Leaver C.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1711-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Changes in spot intensity were analyzed by ImageMaster two-dimensional Elite software (Amersham Biosciences) on 12-bit TIFF images with background subtraction. Mass Spectrometry—Proteins of interest were analyzed by electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using a QStar Pulsar MS/MS system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primary MS/MS data were analyzed using the Mascot server (available on the World Wide Web at www.matrixscience.com/), searching against an in house data base comprising TIGR and NCBI rice protein sets with error tolerances of MS of ±1.2 Da and MS/MS of ±0.6 Da. In Vitro Import Assays—Precursor proteins were generated from the soybean alternative oxidase (31Whelan J. McIntosh L. Day D.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 1031481Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), soybean FAd subunit of ATP synthase (32Smith M.K. Day D.A. Whelan J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), maize phosphate carrier (obtained from Prof. C. Leaver, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK), Arabidopsis Tim23 (translocase of the inner membrane 23) (29Murcha M.W. Lister R. Ho A.Y. Whelan J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1737-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), Arabidopsis Rps10, and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) Rps10 cDNA clones using the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Melbourne, Australia) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Imports were performed with 20 μg of mitochondrial protein as previously described (33Whelan J. Hugosson M. Glaser E. Day D.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and substrates were included to final concentrations as follows: ATP (0.75 mm), NADH (10 mm), and succinate (5 mm). Precursor proteins were added, and the import reaction was left to incubate for 10–60 min at 26 °C. For precursors with a cleavable presequence, this was followed by treatment by proteinase K, whereas for the unprocessed precursors, proteinase K treatment followed preparation of mitoplasts via osmotic swelling (29Murcha M.W. Lister R. Ho A.Y. Whelan J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1737-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mitochondria or mitoplasts were then pelleted by centrifugation of the import reaction at 20,800 × g at 4 °C for 2 min. Mitochondrial proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained, dried, and exposed to a BAS TR2040S plate for 48 h. Radiolabeled proteins were detected using a BAS 2500 (Fuji). Mitochondrial Ultrastructure Is Independent of Oxygen Availability but Rice Embryo Growth and Respiratory Activity Are Compromised under Anaerobic Conditions—To ensure our experimental protocols were replicating the aerobic and anaerobic growth of rice reported by other workers, we initially undertook a broad survey of rice germination physiology and respiratory function. Dehulled rice grains were grown for 48 h submerged in growth media continuously bubbled with air or commercial grade nitrogen to create aerobic (A) or anaerobic (N) conditions, respectively. Although germination occurred under both conditions, differences in embryo morphology were found (Fig. 1A, top). Coleoptile growth was slower in anaerobically grown rice, and most obviously, the radicle did not elongate, consistent with the requirement for trace amounts of oxygen for root development (34Kordan H.A. New Phytol. 1974; 73: 695-697Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Rice grains were also germinated and grown in anaerobic conditions for 24 h, followed by a switch to growth in aerobic conditions for 48 h or germinated and grown in aerobic conditions for 24 h, followed by a switch to growth in anaerobic conditions for 48 h (Fig. 1A, bottom). Using this switch system, differences in morphology were also observed as the embryos developed. As observed previously, rice germinated in the presence of oxygen initially showed slightly faster coleoptile growth compared with rice grown without oxygen (see the 24 h time point). However, after switching the conditions and allowing growth for a further 48 h (i.e. at the 72 h time point), clear differences were evident, with grains switched to an anaerobic environment showing no root development, whereas extensive root elongation was observed in those grains that were switched into aerobic conditions, indicating that the introduction or removal of oxygen after germination can also alter development. Transmission electron microscopy was used to assess changes in mitochondrial morphology in rice embryo tissue after growth in aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Fig. 1B). The transition from promitochondria, showing little discernible internal structure (25Howell K.A. Millar A.H. Whelan J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 60: 201-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), in the dry seed (0 h) to typical mature mitochondria, characterized by an increase in matrix density and formation of cristae, occurred in both the presence and absence of oxygen. To determine mitochondrial functionality under the different growth conditions indicated (Fig. 1A), the respiratory activity of isolated rice embryo mitochondria was determined (Fig. 1C). Succinate-dependent respiration, succinate plus NADH-dependent respiration, and cytochrome c oxidase activity were measured. For mitochondria isolated from tissue grown under aerobic conditions, oxygen uptake in the presence of succinate or succinate plus NADH showed a steady increase over the 48-h time period. Cytochrome c oxidase activity also increased but only after 24 and 48 h postimbibition (p < 0.05, n = 3), with no significant difference in activity determined between mitochondria isolated from dry seed (0) and after 12 h of growth under aerobic conditions (12A). For anaerobically grown tissue, mitochondrial respiration (dependent on succinate or NADH plus succinate) as well as cytochrome c oxidase activity showed no significant differences over the 48-h growth period (p < 0.05, n = 3). Using the switch system, mitochondria isolated from tissue grown under aerobic conditions followed by anaerobic conditions (24A/24N) showed that respiratory activity driven by succinate as well as cytochrome c oxidase activity was maintained at 24A levels, indicating that increases to 48A levels were repressed by transfer to anaerobic conditions. Furthermore, respiration driven by succinate plus NADH decreased from 24A levels. Switching from anaerobic to aerobic conditions (24N/24A) resulted in increases in all oxygen consumption measurements compared with 24N levels, reaching levels equal to or exceeding those seen for 24A mitochondria. Transcript Levels of Mitochondrial Components Are Differentially Affected by Oxygen Availability—Transcript levels of 28 genes encoding mitochondrial proteins were then evaluated in rice embryo tissue under continuous growth in either aerobic (shown in red) or anaerobic (shown in blue) conditions using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 2). These genes encoded components of the mitochondrial import apparatus, tricarboxylic acid cycle, electron transport chain, and mitochondrial transcription and translation machinery. Transcript profiles were grouped using SOM clustering to determine if the changes in transcript levels differed between growth conditions (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, although some showed a large response to changes in oxygen levels (Group 1), others were not significantly affected by oxygen availability (Group 2). More specifically, Group 1 transcripts exhibited 2–10-fold increases after growth in an aerobic environment, whereas under anaerobic conditions, transcript abundance was maintained at levels similar to those seen in unimbibed (0 h) rice embryos. Notably, all of the oxygen-responsive transcripts were nuclear encoded with one exception, the mitochondrial encoded subunit of cytochrome c oxidase, cox2. Although transcripts in Group 2 showed no significant response to oxygen, they differed in their profiles over time. Group 2a showed increases from relatively low levels in the dry seed (0 h) with maximum levels observed after 24 or 48 h, demonstrating that accumulation of some transcripts encoding mitochondrial proteins does occur under anaerobic conditions. Group 2b transcripts were relatively stable, with levels found to be similar in both unimbibed tissue (0 h) and after 48 h of growth under both conditions. As a control, transcript levels of alcohol dehydrogenase, Adh1, a known and well studied anaerobically induced gene in rice, responded as expected, with message levels increasing rapidly after 12 h of growth in anaerobic conditions while remaining at similar levels in the presence of oxygen over the 48-h time period, essentially mirroring the changes seen for the oxygen-responsive transcripts (Group 1). The transcripts showing a response to oxygen (Group 1) could be further categorized in terms of the timing of when the aerobic and anaerobic transcript profiles diverged (Fig. 2B). Sets I, II, and III indicate divergence after 1, 4, and 12 h, respectively, as defined by statistically significant differences between transcript levels under the different growth conditions at the same time point (determined using t tests; p < 0.05). Although the majority of transcripts examined showed differences after 4 h (Set II), a few notable exceptions were found, including Rps14 and Ant-1 (adenine nucleotide translocator) transcripts (Set I), which showed a rapid response to oxygen with a significant difference detected after just 1 h, and levels of cox2, Adl2b, and Ucp-2 (uncoupling protein) (Set III) transcripts, which showed a delayed response with significant differences not evident until after 12 h. Thus, it is possible to define a set of aerobic genes that differ in the timing of their response to the presence of oxygen. To further dissect the link between development and the timing of oxygen responsiveness, transcript analysis was conducted during the switch at 24 h between anaerobic and aerobic growth and vice versa, again using quantitative reverse transcripti"
https://openalex.org/W2141854312,"The disulfide-bridged hendecapeptide (CWTKSIPPKPC) loop, derived from an amphibian skin peptide, is found to have strong trypsin inhibitory capability. This loop, called the trypsin inhibitory loop (TIL), appears to be the smallest serine protease inhibitor known. A series of synthetic peptides derived from this loop also exhibits trypsin inhibitory activity; some peptides even exhibit both antimicrobial and trypsin inhibitory activities. Antimicrobial peptides are attractive candidates for producing novel antibiotics, but their sensitivity to trypsin-like proteases appreciably limits their application. Bifunctional peptides with both antimicrobial and trypsin inhibitory activities could be ideal candidates for clinical antibiotics, since these reported synthetic peptides have shown resistance against trypsin. The crystal structure of a complex of trypsin with one TIL derivative is solved. The concept of TIL is introduced in this paper. Novel trypsin inhibitors or antimicrobial peptides can be designed readily on the basis of the TIL. Furthermore, functional analysis and a precursor comparison suggest that serine protease inhibitors may have a common ancestor with antimicrobial peptides."

Lu, an Ig superfamily transmembrane receptor specific for laminin α5, is also known as basal cell adhesion molecule (B-CAM). Although Lu/B-CAM binds to the LG domain of laminin α5, the binding site has not been precisely defined. To better delineate this binding site, we produced a series of recombinant laminin trimers containing modified α chains, such that all or part of α5LG was replaced with analogous segments of human laminin α1LG. In solid phase binding assays using a soluble Lu (Lu-Fc) composed of the Lu extracellular domain and human IgG1 Fc, we found that Lu bound to Mr5G3, a recombinant laminin containing α5 domains LN through LG3 fused to human laminin α1LG4–5. However, Lu/B-CAM did not bind other recombinant laminins containing α5LG3 unless α5LG1–2 was also present. A recombinant α5LG1-3 tandem lacking the laminin coiled coil (LCC) domain did not reproduce the activity of Lu/B-CAM binding. Therefore, proper structure of the α5LG1-3 tandem with the LCC domain was essential for the binding of Lu/B-CAM to laminin α5.

Laminins are a family of heterotrimeric glycoproteins that assemble into basement membranes. The laminin-511 trimer (α5β1γ1) is a major isoform widely expressed in fetal and adult tissues. Many of the biological functions of laminin-511 are mediated through the α5 subunit. Mice lacking laminin α5 die during late embryogenesis with several developmental defects, including defects in neural tube formation, digit separation, placentation, glomerulogenesis, lung lobe separation, intestinal smooth muscle development, and tooth morphogenesis (1Miner J.H.

All five laminin α chains have a laminin-type globular (LG) 2The abbreviations used are: LG, laminin-type globular; LCC, laminin coiled coil; Lu, Lutheran blood group glycoprotein; B-CAM, basal cell adhesion molecule; PBS(–), Ca2+ and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline; HEK, human embryonic kidney; DMEM, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. domain at their COOH termini, which consists of five homologous domains (LG1–LG5). Molecular dissection of the laminin α5 LG domain in vivo revealed that the LG1-2 tandem harbors most of the functionality of the α5LG domain with regard to mediating developmental processes, whereas the α5LG3-5 tandem appears to be involved in glomerular filtration (5Kikkawa Y.

Lu is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and has been studied primarily in the contexts of blood group antigens and sickle cell disease (18Kikkawa Y. Miner J.H. Connect.

B-CAM, a splice variant of Lu, has the same NH2-terminal extracellular domain as Lu, but it lacks the COOH-terminal 40 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail, which carries an Src homology 3 binding motif and potential phosphorylation sites that could be involved in intracellular signaling pathways (20Parsons S.F.

In previous studies, we have reported that laminin α5 (but not the other four laminin α chains) is a ligand for Lu/B-CAM (17Kikkawa Y. Moulson C.L. Virtanen I. Miner J.H. J. Biol.

Dyn. 2001; 222: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have also reported that the Lu/B-CAM binding site maps within the α5LG domain and that the α5LG3 domain is essential for Lu/B-CAM binding to laminin α5. Similarly, several groups have attempted to identify binding sites for integrins, syndecans, and α-dystroglycan within laminin α chain LG domains (22Timpl R. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Andac Z. Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 23Suzuki N. Yokoyama F. Nomizu M. Connect.

Recently, Ido et al. (25Ido H. Harada K. Futaki S. Hayashi Y. Nishiuchi R. Natsuka Y. Li S. Wada Y. Combs A.C. Ervasti J.M. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol.

These results lead to the conclusion that α5LG3 is critical for the binding of Lu/B-CAM and integrins α3β1 and α6β1. However, the precise structure of the binding sites for these receptors within α5LG remains unclear. Here we produced a series of recombinant laminins to narrow the binding site of Lu/B-CAM within the laminin α5LG domain. Solid phase binding assays to these laminins were performed with a soluble recombinant Lu (Lu-Fc) composed of the extracellular domain of Lu fused to IgG1 Fc. Lu/B-CAM binding to laminin required the α5LG1-3 tandem, as did integrins α3β1 and α6β1 binding to laminin. Furthermore, we examined competition between Lu/B-CAM and α3β1/α6β1 integrins for binding to α5LG1-3. Our results indicate that the binding site for Lu/B-CAM on α5LG1-3 overlaps with that of the α3β1/α6β1 integrins. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) and human fibrosarcoma (HT1080) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA) and Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan), respectively. Both cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum. K562 human erythroleukemia cells transfected with cDNA encoding human integrin α3A or α6A subunits were kindly provided by Dr. Arnoud Sonnenberg (The Netherlands Cancer Institute) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1 mg/ml G418 (Sigma) (26Delwel G.O. de Melker A.A.

Polyclonal antibody against laminin α5 domain LN/LEa has been described previously (28Garbe J.H. Gohring W. Mann K. Timpl R. Sasaki T. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against human Lu (BRIC108 and BRIC221) were purchased from Biogenesis (Kingston, NH) and Serotec (Oxford, UK), respectively. Monoclonal antibody against human integrin α3 (P1B5) was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Rat monoclonal antibody against human integrin α6 (GoH3) was purchased from Pharmingen. Anti-human integrin β1 (TS2/16) was purified on a protein G-Sepharose 4B column from the conditioned medium of hybridoma cells purchased from the ATCC. Human IgG1 Fc control protein was prepared as described previously (29Utani A. Nomizu M. Matsuura H. Kato K. Kobayashi T. Takeda U. Aota S. Nielsen P.K. Shinkai H. J. Biol.

Construction of Expression Vectors—Laminin chain expression vectors were prepared as follows. cDNA clones encoding full-length mouse laminin α5 with the FLAG sequence at the COOH terminus (generated in our laboratory) and human laminin α1 (provided by Dr. Karl Tryggvason, Stockholm, Sweden) were used to construct expression vectors encoding the chimeric laminin α chains Mr51, Mr5G1, Mr5G2, Mr5G3, Mr5G13, and Mr5G23. PCR was used to introduce restriction sites at the appropriate locations and to seamlessly join amplified fragments with overlapping sequences by sequential PCR (30Elion E.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. 1998: 3.17.1-3Google Scholar). For all PCR, Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Preparation of Mr5, Mr51, Mr5G2, and Mr5G3 has been described previously (17Kikkawa Y. Moulson C.L. Virtanen I. Miner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44864-44869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For generating Mr5G1, we took advantage of a unique AgeI site at the end of the sequence encoding α5LG1. To construct Mr5G1, human α1LG2–5 was amplified with sense (5′-AGGCGCGCCTCTAGAGCACCGGTTCCCAGAATGAAGACCCTTCC-3′) and antisense (5′-AGGCGCGCCCGTACGTCAGGACTCGGTCCCAGGAC-3′). This segment was ligated to the cDNA encoding α5 domains LN through LG1. To construct Mr5G13, we used AgeI and SpeI sites in sequences encoding the α5LG domain. Human α1LG2 was amplified with sense (using the same sense primer to generate Mr5G1) and antisense (5′-AGTCATGGTGCGTCCCACTAGCAGGAAGCTAACACTCCGGAT-3′); mouse α5LG3 was amplified with sense (5′-ATCCGGAGTGTTAGCTTCCTGCTAGTGGGACGCACCATGACT-3′) and antisense (5′-CCGACCACATGTCGGATGCGA-3′). These two products were mixed and subjected to PCR again for 20 cycles to join them. The amplified PCR product was inserted into the AgeI and SpeI sites of Mr5G3. To construct Mr5G23, we used the Mr51 cDNA to make a chimeric segment of α5LCC and α1LG1. The chimeric segment was amplified with sense (5′-GCCCTGAATGAGCTGGCATC-3′) and antisense (5′-ACCGGTCTGGGAGCTTCCGAAGCACCCA-3′). The amplified PCR product was inserted into the MluI and AgeI sites of Mr5G3. The full-length mouse laminin α5 with the COOH-terminal FLAG tag and chimeric α chains were then cloned into pcDNA3.1Zeo(+) (Invitrogen) and used to produce recombinant laminins. cDNA clones encoding mouse laminin β1 chains (provided by Dr. Albert E. Chung, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA) and γ1 (provided by Dr. Peter D. Yurchenco, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, NJ) were cloned into pcDNA3.1Neo(+) (Invitrogen) and pIREShyg2 (BD Biosciences Clontech), respectively. The expression vector containing α5LG1-3 was prepared as follows. The DNA sequence encoding the LG1-3 domain of laminin α5 was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using RNA from mouse embryonic endothelial cells and the primer pair sense (5′-GTCAGCTAGCCGCCAGCAAGGTCAAGG-3′) and antisense (5′-GTCACTCGAGCTACCTTGAGGTCTCGATGAG-3′). The PCR product was inserted into the NheI-XhoI site of the episomal expression vector pCEP-Pu containing the BM-40 signal peptide (31Kohfeldt E. Sasaki T. Gohring W. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). An expression vector containing Lu-Fc was prepared as follows. A DNA fragment encoding human IgG1 Fc was prepared from the CD4-Ig vector (32Zettlmeissl G. Gregersen J.P. Duport J.M. Mehdi S. Reiner G. Seed B. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and inserted into the BamHI-XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1Neo(+). A full-length human Lu cDNA was purchased from Invitrogen and used as a template for PCR. DNA sequences encoding the extracellular domain of Lu/B-CAM was amplified using sense (5′-CGGGATCCGCCACCATGGAGCCCCCGGACGCACCG-3′) and antisense (5′-CGGGATCCACTCCAGCCTGGGAGGTCTG-3′). The PCR product was inserted into the BamHI site of the above human IgG1 Fc expression vector. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—HEK293 cells were transfected with the mouse laminin γ1 expression vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and stable clones were selected using 400 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen). All further cell culture and clonal expansion were carried out in the presence of the relevant antibiotics for positive selection. A clone highly expressing mouse laminin γ1 was then transfected with the mouse laminin β1 expression vector, and stable clones were selected using 800 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). A clone highly expressing laminin γ1 and β1 was transfected with mouse laminin α5 or chimeric α chain expression vectors, and stable clones were selected using 400 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). The selected clones were grown to confluency in 24-well culture plates with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The confluent cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for four days. The conditioned media were harvested and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 revolutions/min for 20 min. They were screened for the expression of recombinant laminins by immunoblotting with antibody against the laminin α5 domain LN/LEa. The clones showing high secretion were grown to confluency in culture dishes with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The confluent cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for four days. The conditioned media were harvested and clarified by sequential centrifugation at 500 revolutions/min for 10 min and 10,000 revolutions/min for 20 min. The collected media were precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 80% saturation. The resulting precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 revolutions/min for 30 min and then dissolved in and dialyzed against PBS(–). The 30-fold concentrated media were used for purification. The recombinant laminins were purified from the conditioned culture media by anti-FLAG or anti-human laminin α1LG4–5 monoclonal antibody coupled to agarose. The eluted fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% sucrose. Human embryonic kidney EBNA-293 cells were transfected with the α5LG1-3 expression vector and the serum-free media were collected as described previously (31Kohfeldt E. Sasaki T. Gohring W. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The serum-free media were passed over a heparin-Sepharose column (2 × 25 cm) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and eluted with 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient. The second purification was achieved on Superose 12 HR16/50 (GE Healthcare Biosciences) equilibrated with 0.2 m ammonium acetate. The pooled fraction was further purified on MonoQ HR5/5 (GE Healthcare Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.6 m NaCl. HEK293 cells were transfected with Lu-Fc expression vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and stable clones were selected using 1 mg/ml G418 (Sigma). The conditioned media were prepared as described above. Recombinant protein was purified from the conditioned media by protein-A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare Biosciences). The eluted fractions were pooled and dialyzed against PBS(–). Electrophoretic Analysis and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was carried out on 5 or 7.5% gels under reducing or non-reducing conditions. Proteins were visualized with silver staining or Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For immunoblotting, sample proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Proteins on the membrane were reacted with first antibodies followed by incubation with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare Biosciences). Bound antibodies were visualized with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare Biosciences). Solid Phase Binding Assay—Solid phase binding assays were carried out with recombinant proteins coated onto the plastic surface of microtiter plates. Plates were blocked with PBS(–) containing 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with Lu-Fc at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing with PBS(–), the bound Lu-Fc was detected with a biotinylated anti-human IgG1 Fc monoclonal antibody (Sigma). After further washing, the bound antibodies were detected by the addition of streptavidin-conjugated horseradish-peroxidase (GE Healthcare Biosciences) followed by the addition of 1 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine and 0.012% H2O2. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a Microplate Reader Model 550 (Bio-Rad). Cell Adhesion Assays—Cell adhesion assays were performed as described previously (13Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Fujiwara H. Sonnenberg A. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 869-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were incubated with recombinant laminins at 37 °C for 1 h and then blocked with PBS(–) containing 1% bovine serum albumin for another hour. K562 transfectants were suspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium at 4 × 105 cells/ml and preincubated with or without 1 μg/ml anti-integrin β1 monoclonal antibody TS2/16 at room temperature for 10 min. 50 μl of cell suspension were added to the laminin-coated wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The attached cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, stained with Diff-Quik (International Regents Corp., Kobe, Japan), and counted under the microscope. Cell adhesion inhibition assays were performed on the basis of the adhesion assay described above. HT1080 cells were suspended in serum-free DMEM at 4 × 105 cells/ml and preincubated with 1 μg/ml anti-integrin β1 monoclonal antibody TS2/16 at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were further preincubated with 10 μg/ml monoclonal antibodies against different integrins and 20 μg/ml recombinant Lu-Fc protein at room temperature for 10 min. TS2/16-stimulated K562 transfectants were also preincubated with 20 μg/ml recombinant Lu-Fc protein at room temperature for 10 min. The preincubated cells were transferred to plates coated with 10 μg/ml of the recombinant laminins. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the attached cells were stained and counted as described above. Production of Recombinant Laminins—In a previous study, we reported that α5LG3 is essential for Lu/B-CAM binding to laminin α5 (17Kikkawa Y. Moulson C.L. Virtanen I. Miner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44864-44869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although our results showed that the α5LG4-5 tandem is not required for Lu/B-CAM binding, whether or not α5LG1-2 is required remains an open question. To further define the Lu/B-CAM binding site on the laminin α5LG domain, we produced a series of recombinant laminin trimers containing chimeric α5 chains in which all or part of laminin α5LG was replaced with analogous segments of human laminin α1 (Fig. 1). Although the functional structure of laminins has in some cases been examined by producing deletion mutants (25Ido H. Harada K. Futaki S. Hayashi Y. Nishiuchi R. Natsuka Y. Li S. Wada Y. Combs A.C.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22495-22502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the deletion approach often leads to disruptions in the tertiary structure. Therefore, we undertook a chimeric approach using laminin α5 and α1 chains. The human laminin α1LG domain does not bind to Lu/B-CAM, and it also bears an epitope in the α1LG4-5 tandem recognized by a monoclonal antibody. In our previous study, we investigated the binding site of Lu/B-CAM through analysis of chimeric laminin chains produced in transgenic mice in vivo (17Kikkawa Y. Moulson C.L. Virtanen I. Miner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44864-44869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, it is not feasible to continue to generate and maintain transgenic mice expressing chimeric α chains. Two groups have already reported that it is possible to produce recombinant laminin-511 by sequential transfection of cDNAs encoding human laminin α5, β1, and γ1chains into HEK293 cells (25Ido H. Harada K. Futaki S. Hayashi Y. Nishiuchi R. Natsuka Y. Li S. Wada Y. Combs A.C. Ervasti J.M. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol.

Matrix Biol. 2006; 25: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Similarly, here we have produced recombinant laminins containing full-length α5or chimeric α5/α1 chains in HEK293 cells. Secretion of endogenous human laminins was not detected (data not shown). Recombinant proteins secreted into the culture media were screened by immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-laminin α5 domain LN/LEa serum. Conditioned media were subjected to SDS-PAGE and separated under non-reducing conditions. Immunoblotting revealed a band migrating at ∼800 kDa, showing that the recombinant laminins were produced as disulfide cross-linked heterotrimers (data not shown) (10Kikkawa Y. Miner J.H. Dev. Biol. 2006; 296: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were purified from the culture media using agarose conjugated with either anti-FLAG or anti-α1LG4–5 monoclonal antibodies. The purified proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 2). All recombinant proteins gave three bands upon silver staining; one corresponded to the α chain, with a relative molecular mass of 350 kDa, and the two lower bands corresponded to the β1 and γ1 chains. 300 ml of conditioned culture medium yielded ∼40 μg of recombinant laminin. Furthermore, all recombinant laminins reproduced heparin binding activity that is a common feature of laminin α chains (22Timpl R. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Andac Z. Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Mapping of the Lu/B-CAM Binding Site on the Laminin α5 LG Domain—To examine the binding of Lu to the recombinant laminins, we prepared a dimerized soluble recombinant protein (Lu-Fc) that is composed of the Lu extracellular domain and human IgG1 Fc portion. Lu-Fc dimerized via the Fc region was expected to bind to laminin α5 more effectively than the monomeric Lu (Sol-Lu) used in our previous study (17Kikkawa Y. Moulson C.L. Virtanen I. Miner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44864-44869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). By SDS-PAGE, purified Lu-Fc migrated at a relative molecular mass of 120 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig. 3A) and at 240 kDa under non-reducing conditions (data not shown). The purified protein reacted with anti-human Lu monoclonal antibodies BRIC 108 and BRIC 221 (data not shown). Solid phase binding assays were performed using the purified recombinant laminins and Lu-Fc. Consistent with our previous study, Lu-Fc bound to recombinant laminin trimers containing Mr5G3 but not Mr5G2 (Fig. 3B). The straightforward interpretation is that Lu/B-CAM binds to α5LG3. However, the other recombinant laminins containing α5LG3 (Mr5G13 and Mr5G23) did not bind Lu-Fc. These results indicate that Lu/B-CAM binding requires not only α5LG3 but also α5LG1–2. We conclude that the entire α5LG1-3 tandem structure is essential for Lu/B-CAM binding to laminin α5. To examine the contribution of the LCC domain to Lu/B-CAM binding, we produced a recombinant α5LG1-3 tandem lacking the LCC domain in HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, the purified protein migrated at 80 kDa as a single band under non-reducing conditions. The recombinant α5LG1-3 tandem exhibited weak Lu-Fc binding activity at high concentrations (Fig. 4B). Therefore, Lu/B-CAM binding activity likely requires a proper α5LG1–3 conformation in connection with the preceding LCC domain. The Binding of Lu/B-CAM and Integrins on the Laminin α5 LG Domain—Laminin α5 is also recognized by integrins α3β1, α6β1, α6β4, and αvβ3 (13Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Fujiwara H. Sonnenberg A. Sekiguchi K.

https://openalex.org/W2079792182,"The Pseudomonas fluorescens mupirocin biosynthetic cluster encodes six proteins involved in polyketide biosynthesis and 26 single polypeptides proposed to perform largely tailoring functions. In-frame deletions in the tailoring open reading frames demonstrated that all are required for mupirocin production. A bidirectional promoter region was identified between mupF, which runs counter to other open reading frames and its immediate neighbor macpC, implying the 74-kb cluster consists of two transcriptional units. mupD/E and mupJ/K must be cotranscribed as pairs for normal function implying co-assembly during translation. MupJ and K belong to a widely distributed enzyme pair implicated, with MupH, in methyl addition. Deletion of mupF, a putative ketoreductase, produced a mupirocin analogue with a C-7 ketone. Deletion of mupC, a putative dienoyl CoA reductase, generated an analogue whose structure indicated that MupC is also implicated in control of the oxidation state around the tetrahydropyran ring of monic acid. Double mutants with ΔmupC and ΔmupO, ΔmupU, ΔmupV, or ΔmacpE produced pseudomonic acid B but not pseudomonic acid A, as do the mupO, U, V, and macpE mutants, indicating that MupC must work after MupO, U, and V. The Pseudomonas fluorescens mupirocin biosynthetic cluster encodes six proteins involved in polyketide biosynthesis and 26 single polypeptides proposed to perform largely tailoring functions. In-frame deletions in the tailoring open reading frames demonstrated that all are required for mupirocin production. A bidirectional promoter region was identified between mupF, which runs counter to other open reading frames and its immediate neighbor macpC, implying the 74-kb cluster consists of two transcriptional units. mupD/E and mupJ/K must be cotranscribed as pairs for normal function implying co-assembly during translation. MupJ and K belong to a widely distributed enzyme pair implicated, with MupH, in methyl addition. Deletion of mupF, a putative ketoreductase, produced a mupirocin analogue with a C-7 ketone. Deletion of mupC, a putative dienoyl CoA reductase, generated an analogue whose structure indicated that MupC is also implicated in control of the oxidation state around the tetrahydropyran ring of monic acid. Double mutants with ΔmupC and ΔmupO, ΔmupU, ΔmupV, or ΔmacpE produced pseudomonic acid B but not pseudomonic acid A, as do the mupO, U, V, and macpE mutants, indicating that MupC must work after MupO, U, and V. Mupirocin is a polyketide antibiotic active against Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. It is a competitive inhibitor of isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS), blocking binding of isoleucine and ATP to IleRS (1Hughes J. Mellows G. Biochem. J. 1978; 176: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Mupirocin is a mixture of pseudomonic acids (PA) 5The abbreviations used are: PA, pseudomonic acid; ER, enoyl reductases; WT, wild type; ORF, open reading frame; PKS, polyketide synthase; KS, ketosynthase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; KR, ketoreductase; DH, dehydratase; TE, thioesterase; MeT, methyltransferase; HMG, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid; PPTase, phosphopantetheinyl transferase; N-AHL, N-acyl homoserine lactone; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.5The abbreviations used are: PA, pseudomonic acid; ER, enoyl reductases; WT, wild type; ORF, open reading frame; PKS, polyketide synthase; KS, ketosynthase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; KR, ketoreductase; DH, dehydratase; TE, thioesterase; MeT, methyltransferase; HMG, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid; PPTase, phosphopantetheinyl transferase; N-AHL, N-acyl homoserine lactone; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586, with PA-A accounting for 90%. PA-A consists of a C9 saturated fatty acid (9-hydroxynonanoic acid, 9HN) joined via an ester linkage to a C17 unsaturated polyketide moiety containing a tetrahydropyran ring (monic acid, MA, Fig. 1A) (2Chain E.B. Mellows G. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1974; : 847-848Crossref Google Scholar, 3Chain E.B. Mellows G. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1977; 1: 294-309Crossref Google Scholar). PA-B has an additional hydroxyl group at C-8 (4Chain E.B. Mellows G. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1977; 1: 318-322Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), in PA-C the C-10,11 epoxide group is replaced with a double bond (5Clayton J.P. O'Hanlon P.J. Rogers N.H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1980; 21: 881-884Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and PA-D has an additional double bond at C-4′,5′ in the 9-HN moiety (6O'Hanlon P.J. Rogers N.H. Tyler J.W. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1983; 1: 2655-2665Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Polyketides are biosynthesized by condensation of small carboxylic acids catalyzed by ketosynthases (KS) generating β-carbonyl groups that may then be left unreduced or reduced partially or fully by the combined activities of ketoreductases (KR), dehydratases (DH), and enoyl reductases (ER). In archetypal Type I polyketide synthase (PKS) systems the starter and extender carboxylic acids are loaded onto KS and acyl carrier proteins (ACP), respectively, via acyl-CoA-activated intermediates, catalyzed by acyltransferases (AT). The growing polyketide chain remains attached to an ACP as a thiolester until its release, typically by hydrolysis catalyzed by a terminal thioesterase (TE). The polyketide backbone may then require further modification to produce the final metabolite. Post-PKS tailoring includes such processes as further oxidative-reductive steps, addition of moieties such as sugar units, methylation, halogenation, and cyclization. It is this variety in reduction, addition of functional groups, and choice of carboxylic units that make the polyketides a very diverse class of metabolites in both structure and activity (7Staunton J. Weissmann K.J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2001; 18: 380-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). There are several examples of PKS combinatorial biosyntheses resulting in novel polyketide metabolites (for a review see Ref. 8Weissman K.J. Leadlay P.F. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 925-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), and such an approach is also being applied to tailoring enzymes (for a review see Ref. 9Rix U. Fischer C. Remsing L.L. Rohr J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 542-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The 74-kb mupirocin biosynthetic gene cluster has been sequenced and many of the open reading frames (ORFs) assigned putative functions (Table 1 and Fig. 2) (10El-Sayed A.K. Hothersall J. Cooper S.M. Stephens E. Simpson T.J. Thomas C.M. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The first half of the cluster contains 3 large Type I multifunctional PKS genes plus associated trans-acyltransferase as well as two single ORFs mupA and mupB, while the second half, referred to as the tailoring region, contains 26 single ORFs (mupC-X, and macpA-E), plus two PKS-like genes mmpE and mmpF. A model for biosynthesis of the mupirocin backbone was proposed based on the cluster sequence, feeding experiments (11Feline T.C. Jones R.B. Mellows G. Phillips L. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1977; 1: 309-318Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12Martin F.M. Simpson T.J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1989; 1: 207-209Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and comparisons with other polyketide biosynthetic pathways (Fig. 2B) (10El-Sayed A.K. Hothersall J. Cooper S.M. Stephens E. Simpson T.J. Thomas C.M. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). MmpD and MmpA together contain 6 modules for condensation and reduction of acetate-derived units, which with two methyl transferase domains and assuming that the DH domain in module 1 is inactive (because it contains aspartic acid and alanine residues instead of glycine and proline in the DH motif HXXXGXXXXP) could generate the backbone of a C16-heptaketide MA precursor. The source of 9-HN is more difficult to predict. A 3-hydroxypropionate starter unit may be extended by three malonate condensations, possibly catalyzed by a dedicated fatty acid synthase (FAS), or MmpB functioning iteratively with additional ER activity perhaps provided by MupE and/or MupD. The resulting backbone would need further modifications to produce the major metabolite PA-A shown in Fig. 1A, either prior to or after esterification of MA and 9-HN. These modifications include oxidation of the C-10,11 double bond to create the C-10,11 epoxide group, C-8,9 double bond reduction and C-16 oxidation to produce the tetrahydropyran ring, C-6 hydroxylation, and incorporation of the C-15 methyl group derived from a cleaved acetate unit. We recently reported that mutagenesis of MupW, a putative dioxygenase, generates a novel PA metabolite, mupirocin W, lacking the tetrahydropyran ring (13Cooper S.M. Cox R.J. Crosby J. Crump M.P. Hothersall J. Laosripaiboon W. Simpson T.J. Thomas C.M. Chem. Commun. 2005; : 1179-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus MupW appears to be responsible for oxidative activation of the C-16 methyl group required for the formation of the tetrahydropyran ring, while esterification of MA or an immediate precursor with 9-HN and other tailoring modifications can occur without tetrahydropyran ring formation. Therefore either pyran ring formation occurs after esterification, or there is relaxed substrate specificity of the enzymes involved in these post-PKS modifications. In the same study mutagenesis of any one of four other ORFs mupO, mupU, mupV, and macpE resulted in a complete switch to PA-B as the major metabolite and so showed that they are essential for PA-A production but not PA-B (14Cooper S.M. Laosripaiboon W. Rahman A.S. Hothersall J. El-Sayed A.K. Winfield C. Crosby J. Cox R.J. Simpson T.J. Thomas C.M. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 825-833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This implies that PA-B is not simply formed, as might have been expected, by facile hydroxylation of PA-A, but is instead either a precursor to PA-A or more likely a shunt product.TABLE 1Deduced function of mupirocin biosynthesis genesORFDeduced functionORFDeduced functionmupAFMNH2 oxygenasemmpEPKS: KS, hydroxylasemmpAPKS: KS, ACP, KS, KR, ACP, KS, ACP, ACPmupLHydrolasemupB3-oxo-ACP synthasemupMIsoleucyl-tRNA synthetasemmpBPKS: KS, DH, KR, ACP, ACP, ACP, TEmupNPPTasemmpCAT, ATmupOCytochrome P450mmpDPKS: KS, DH, KR, MeT, ACP, KS, DH, KR, ACP, KS, DH, KR, MeT, ACP, KS, KR, ACPmupPUnknownmupQAcyl-CoA synthasemupCDienoyl-CoA reductasemupS3-oxo-ACP reductasemacpAACPmacpDACPmupD3-oxo-ACP reductasemmpFPKS: KSmupEEnoyl reductasemacpEACPmacpBACPmupTFerredoxin dioxygenasemupFKRmupUAcyl-CoA synthasemacpCACPmupVOxidoreductasemupG3-oxo-ACP synthasemupIVDioxygenasemupHHMG-CoA synthasemupRTranscriptional activatormupJEnoyl-CoA hydratasemupXAmidasemupKEnoyl-CoA hydratasemupIN-AHL synthase Open table in a new tab Our previous work also reported deletion of mupQ, S, T, R, X, and I, of which only mupR and I could be assigned a clear role in quorum regulation of expression of the cluster (10El-Sayed A.K.

This study reports the in-frame deletion analysis of all remaining ORFs in the mupC-mupX tailoring region showing that all are indeed required for PA production. Furthermore HPLC analysis of the PA profile of these mutants compared with wild-type NCIMB 10586, revealed a number of novel shunt products, exemplified by mupirocin C and mupirocin F shown in Fig. 1, B and C. The role of specific proteins in mupirocin biosynthesis is discussed here while details of structural characterization of these and other novel metabolites will be reported in full elsewhere. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—P. fluorescens NCIMB 10586 (15Whatling C.A. Hodgson J.E. Burnham M.K.R. Clarke N.J. Franklin F.C.H. Thomas C.M.

Smith D.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was used in bioassays to monitor mupirocin production. PCR fragments were initially cloned into pGEM-TEasy (Promega) for sequencing.

Thomas C.M. Figurski D.H. Meyer R. Remeut E. Helinski D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 68: 268-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and L-agar (L-broth supplemented with 1.5%, w/v agar) supplemented with appropriate antibiotics. P. fluorescens strains were grown at 30 °C in L-broth and L-agar. For plasmid maintenance and selection of antibiotic-resistant transformants media was supplemented with appropriate antibiotic concentrations as follows: ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and tetracycline·HCL (15–25 μg/ml). DNA Isolation and Manipulation—Plasmid DNA extraction was performed by the alkaline SDS method of Birnboim and Doly (20Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9838) Google Scholar), or with Wizard Plus SV Mini Preps DNA Purification Systems (Promega). Extraction of DNA from agarose was performed using GeneClean kit (Bio101). Ligations were performed using T4 DNA ligase (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). PCR fragments were cloned into a T-tailed vector pGEM-TEasy (Promega). Competent E. coli cells were transformed with plasmid DNA using the method of Cohen et al. (22Cohen S.N. Chang A.C.Y. Hsu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2110-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar). Sequence Analysis—DNA sequencing was carried out using the Big Dye Terminator kit (PE-ABI), which is based on the chain termination method (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4563-4567Crossref Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). The sequencing reactions were separated on an ABI 3700 DNA Analyzer. Suicide Mutagenesis of P. fluorescens—Bi-parental mating was carried out to mobilize the suicide plasmid derivatives and expression vectors from E. coli S17-1 to P. fluorescens as follows. A mixture of late exponential phase cultures of E. coli S17-1, containing the relevant plasmid (0.5 ml), and P. fluorescens (0.5 ml) were filtered on to a 0.45-μm sterile Millipore filter. The filter was placed on L-agar overnight at room temperature. The mating mixture was resuspended in sterile saline solution (1 ml), and aliquots (100 μl) were spread on M9 minimal medium or L-agar supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic to select for the presence of the plasmid and not support E. coli S17-1 growth. To isolate strains in which the suicide plasmid had excised from the chromosomal DNA, the co-integrant clone was incubated in L-broth at 30 °C without antibiotic selection. Serial dilutions were plated on L-agar supplemented with sucrose (5%) and colonies replica plated onto L-agar Km. Colonies that were Sucr and Kms were selected. Bioassay for Mupirocin Production—10-μl samples of 16 h P. fluorescens cultures, diluted to the same A600, were spotted onto L-agar and incubated at 30 °C for 16 h. The bioassay plates were then overlaid with molten L-agar seeded with a 16 h B. subtilis culture (150 μl/ml) and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (0.025%), incubated at 37 °C for 16 h and scored for the presence of clear zones around the P. fluorescens patch. HPLC Analysis of PA—Overnight MPM (2.3 g·liter–1 yeast extract, 1.1 glucose, 2.6 Na2HPO4, 2.4 KH2PO4, 5.0 (NH4)2SO4) seed cultures incubated at 25 °C, 200 rpm were diluted 20-fold into 25 ml MPM and incubated for 40 h, at 22 °C, 200 rpm. 1-ml aliquots were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant stored at –20 °C. Samples were filtered (0.2 μm) prior to analysis. HPLC was performed using either Gilson 712 or Unipoint LC system software, reverse phase C18 column (15 cm × 4.6 mm), UV detection at 233 nm, and mobile phase water/acetonitrile gradient (5–70% acetonitrile trifluoroacetic acid (0.01%)) over 30 min at 1 ml/min flow rate. HPLC Purification of Novel PA Intermediates—10586ΔmupC and 10586ΔmupF were cultured as described previously for HPLC analysis. 400-ml culture was centrifuged at 4500 × g, 25 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was acidified with HCl to pH 4.5 then solvent extracted with ethyl acetate (2:1). The aqueous layer was re-extracted twice. The solvent layers were pooled, filtered over anhydrous MgSO4, then dried by rotary evaporation. The crude extract was resuspended in 2 ml of methanol. Diluted aliquots were filtered (0.2 μm) and analyzed by HPLC as described previously with varying mobile phase conditions to determine maximal separation of the peak of interest. Fractions were collected from a protracted isocratic elution step using the water/acetonitrile % calculated, pooled, and re-separated under the same conditions. Fractions were again collected, pooled, and dried by rotary evaporation. The purified extract was resuspended in 1 ml of methanol. ES-MS—PA intermediates were analyzed by ES-MS on a Kratos Profile Mass Spectrometer. Determining MIC of Mupirocin—The cell viability of Pseudomonas strains incubated at 30 °C, 200 rpm for 16 h was determined. Using these values repeat cultures were diluted to 0.5 × 109 cell·ml–1. 1 × 106 cells were spotted onto LA containing 0–2000 μg/ml mupirocin and incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. Presence or absence of growth was evaluated. RNA Isolation—Total RNA was extracted using either RNeasy Mini or Midi Kit (Qiagen) from 1 ml of 16 h P. fluorescens culture treated with two volumes of RNA protect (Qiagen), pelleted at 5000 × g for 10 min, and stored at –80 °C. Cells were lysed with lysozyme (400 μg/ml lysozyme in TE buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0)). RNA was treated with both an on-column DNase treatment (Qiagen) during RNA extraction and with a rigorous DNase treatment using a turbo DNA-free kit (Ambion). RNA purity and concentration was determined on an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer. mRNA Strand-specific Two Step RT-PCR—cDNA was generated from 50 ng RNA using a strand specific primer (0.2 μm) (Primers: RTmupF gccgccagcgtcactaac, RTmupG catcacccagtaccgagcc, RTmupP gccgcgttgttgggtttg, RTmupQ cctgcacatcgtcagtggc), and dNTPs (0.5 mm) with denaturation at 65 °C for 5 min, then adding 1× first strand buffer, dithiothreitol (10 mm), and Invitrogen Superscript II (200 units) and incubating at 42 °C for 50 min. The reaction was heat-inactivated at 70 °C for 15 min. 10% of the first strand cDNA mix was then used as template in the second strand synthesis step using Invitrogen DNA Taq polymerase (2 units), two primers (0.2 μm) designed to generate ∼450-bp fragments (primers: RTmupF & DNAmupF: caggtcgcgcacatccac, RTmupG & DNAmupG: cagtgggcagatggcgat, RTmupP & DNAmupP: cgagggctggcacgc, RTmupO & DNAmupQ: ccatcctgctcagcctcg), MgCl2 (1.5 mm), dNTPs (0.5 mm), glycerol (10%), and 1× buffer. The PCR program was 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 52 °C for 15 s for mupF, G, and Q or 48 °C for 10 s for mupP, and extension at 72 °C for 10 s followed by a single final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. All ORFs of the mup Tailoring Region Are Required for Normal Mupirocin Production—The remaining ORFs of the mup tailoring region were targeted, creating in-frame deletions, and attempting to complement them as described (14Cooper S.M. Laosripaiboon W. Rahman A.S. Hothersall J. El-Sayed A.K. Winfield C. Crosby J. Cox R.J. Simpson T.J. Thomas C.M. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 825-833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The process is illustrated by detailed description of ΔmupC. An in-frame deletion of mupC was created by amplifying two DNA fragments, mupC1 and mupC2, which flank the region to be deleted. The 588-bp mupC1 fragment generated from primers ΔmupC1F and ΔmupC1R includes the first 27 bp of mupC while the 516-bp mupC2 fragment generated from primers ΔmupC2F and ΔmupC2R includes the final 33 bp (for primer details see supplemental Table S1). These two fragments were ligated via a PstI site into the suicide vector pAKE604 to create an in-frame deletion of 1236 bp (pJHC01, Table 2), which will inactivate mupC but not disrupt translation from start to stop codon. pJHC01 was mobilized to P. fluorescens NCIMB 10586 by conjugal mating with E. coli S17–1 (pJHC01), where integration into the chromosome occurs by homologous recombination in either mupC1 or mupC2 and was selected by the kanamycin resistance marker on the plasmid. After purification of the transconjugants to ensure absence of non-integrant bacteria, removal of kanamycin enabled growth of cells in which the suicide vector had excised from the chromosome by recombination in mupC1 or C2 again leaving either wild-type (WT) or mutant DNA. Excisants were selected by growth on sucrose since the integrated plasmid carries the sacB gene whose product, levan sucrase, polymerizes sucrose in the periplasm leading to cell death. Isolates with mupC deleted were identified by PCR with primers ΔmupC1F and ΔmupC2R. A bioassay of eight ΔmupC mutants revealed a consistent reduction in antibacterial activity against B. subtilis 1064 to 23% of WT levels (Table 3 and Fig. 3A). The mupC ORF was then amplified by PCR (primers CmupCF/CmupCR) and cloned into the IncQ tac promoter expression vector pJH10, giving pJHC11 (Table 2, for primer details see supplemental Table S2). The resulting plasmid was introduced into the ΔmupC strain and bioassay showed complementation (Table 3). Therefore the defect in PA production must be due to loss of mupC function and not to a polar effect on downstream genes. Conditions for ΔmupC complementation were optimal without IPTG; biological activity restored to 64% of WT levels. In the same way, 16 further tailoring region ORFs (mupD, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, and macpA, B, C, and D, and mmpE and mmpF) were mutated. When analyzed by bioassay, the majority of mutants showed essentially a PA-negative phenotype with a reduction in average biological activity against B. subtilis 1064 to <20% of WT levels (see Table 3 and Fig. 3A). Four mutants had less reduced levels of activity: 10586ΔmupD had 63% activity, 10586ΔmupF 40%, 10586ΔmupM 40%, and 10586ΔmupP 33%. Again each ORF was cloned separately as a PCR-amplified fragment in pJH10 to be expressed in trans to the appropriate chromosomal mutation (Table 2). Complementation of ΔmupF and ΔmupP, whose orientations had to be determined in combination with complementation, is described in the next section. Most of the other complementation strains showed increased activity in the bioassay compared with appropriate controls containing the empty vector. Exceptions to this were 10586ΔmupD(pJHD11), 10586ΔmupE(pJHE11), 10586ΔmacpC(pASRC11), 10586ΔmupJ(pJScJ), 10586ΔmupK(pJScK), and 10586ΔmupM(pJHM11) whose levels remained the same as the mutant strains (Table 3). MupM is an isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase previously shown to confer mupirocin resistance on E. coli (10El-Sayed A.K. Hothersall J. Cooper S.M. Stephens E. Simpson T.J. Thomas C.M. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). MIC determination as described under “Experimental Procedures” showed that NCIMB 10586 is resistant to mupirocin in excess of 2000 μg/ml while the ΔmupM strain had a MIC between 600 and 800 μg/ml. 10586ΔmupM(pJHM11) grew on 2000 μg/ml when induced with 0.1 mm IPTG. 10586ΔmupM(pJH10) did not restore resistance. Thus while the deletion in mupM may have polar effects which disrupt mupirocin production, its ability to confer mupirocin resistance is still complementable. The other deletions that were not complemented include four that are grouped as pairs of neighboring ORFs: mupD with mupE, and mupJ with mupK. This led to the hypothesis that these gene pairs must be translated from the same mRNA to be functional. For example their nascent polypeptides may need to interact to fold into functional enzymes. To test this mupD and mupE were PCR-amplified together and cloned into pJH10 (giving pJHDE11) (for details see Table 2). pJHDE11 was initially introduced into both 10586ΔmupD and 10586ΔmupE and tested by plate bioassay for its ability to restore mupirocin production. Complementation was only seen in the ΔmupE strain. Likewise mupJ and mupK were cloned together giving pJScJK, which restored mupirocin production to 10586ΔmupJ but not 10586ΔmupK. One possible explanation for the continued lack of complementation in the ΔmupD or the ΔmupK single mutants was that the remaining ORF in the chromosome produces a non-functional product that interferes with the functional product(s) of the two ORFs expressed together. To test this, double in-frame deletions were created either removing both mupD and mupE, or both mupJ and mupK. Introduction of pJHDE11 or pJScJK, respectively, into these double mutants restored antibiotic activity to near WT levels, consistent with the above hypothesis. To test whether macpC also required co-expression with a neighboring ORF to be functional when expressed in trans macpC was cloned into pJH10 together with the upstream ORF mupF in both possible mupF orientations (pJHF12 and pJHF13). pJHF12 and pJHF13 were able to complement 10586ΔmacpC and restore mupirocin production. An Internal Promoter Is Located Upstream of macpC—Assignment of ORFs based on the sequence of the mup region indicated that almost all the ORFs run in the same direction, and it is tempting to suggest that the whole region from mupA to mupX might constitute a single transcriptional unit. However, two of the genes of the tailoring region, mupF and mupP, were predicted (based on codon usage and the presence of appropriate ribosome binding sites) to run in the opposite direction (10El-Sayed A.K. Hothersall J. Cooper S.M. Stephens E. Simpson T.J. Thomas C.M. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), although for both there are alternative ORFs on the opposite strand. Homology (Blast) searches did not give useful insight into which orientation is the most plausible. For mupF the reverse orientation (coordinates 45344–44334 bp) shows 28% identity with a ketoreductase from Callistephus chinesis (accession P51103) while the forward orientation (coordinates 44358–45191 bp) reveals 31% identity with cinnamoyl CoA reductase from barley Hordeum vulgare (accession AY149607). For mupP no significant alignments were observed in either the forward (coordinates 59935–60864 bp) or reverse orientations (coordinates 60615–59821 bp). We therefore performed RT-PCR on the mupF and mupP genes as well as the genes downstream of them mupG and mupQ to determine which transcription events could be detected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Primers were designed to generate 450-bp fragments. Unfortunately in all cases several fragments were amplified and for both orientations. Nevertheless, for mupG and mupQ, which were being used as positive forward controls, only the forward orientation primers gave fragments of the correct size whose identity was confirmed by cloning and sequencing.

The three alpha1AR subtypes (alpha1aAR, alpha1bAR, alpha1dAR) display highly restricted tissue expression that undergoes subtype switching with many pathological stimuli, the mechanistic basis of which remains unknown. To gain insight into transcriptional pathways governing cell-specific regulation of the human alpha1dAR subtype, we cloned and characterized the alpha1dAR promoter region in two human cellular models that display disparate levels of endogenous alpha1dAR expression (SK-N-MC and DU145). Results reveal that alpha1dAR basal expression is regulated by Sp1-dependent binding of two promoter-proximal GC boxes, the mutation of which attenuates alpha1dAR promoter activity 10-fold. Mechanistically, chromatin immunoprecipitation data demonstrate that Sp1 binding correlates with expression of the endogenous gene in vivo, correlating highly with alpha1dAR promoter methylation-dependent silencing of both episomally expressed reporter constructs and the endogenous gene. Further, analysis of methylation status of proximal GC boxes using sodium bisulfite sequencing reveals differential methylation of proximal GC boxes in the two cell lines examined. Together, the data support a mechanism of methylation-dependent disruption of Sp1 binding in a cell-specific manner resulting in repression of basal alpha1dAR expression."
https://openalex.org/W2080595062,"Though deletion of the long arm of chromosome 6 is one of the most common aberrations in tumors, its targeted gene(s) has not been convincingly identified. Using a functional screening approach, we found that UTRN (which encodes utrophin, a dystrophin-related protein) at 6q24, when expressed in an antisense orientation, induced cellular transformation, consistent with a tumor suppressor role. Northern blot analysis, semiquantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR), and gene expression arrays all showed that UTRN expression was downregulated in primary tumors compared with matched normal tissues. Several UTRN neighbor genes were not affected in some tumors with UTRN downregulation, suggesting that UTRN was specifically targeted. RT–PCR, coupled with an in vitro transcription and translation assay, revealed inactivation mutations in 21/62 breast cancers, 4/20 neuroblastomas and 4/15 malignant melanomas. Most of the mutations were deletions involving one or more exons that led to the truncation of utrophin. Splicing errors were found in two cases, and nonsense mutation in one case. Overexpression of a wild-type UTRN in breast cancer cells inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro and reduced their tumor potential in nude mice. Our studies suggest that UTRN is a candidate tumor suppressor gene."
https://openalex.org/W2111984108,"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising anticancer agent with the capability of inducing apoptosis specifically in tumor cells. However, cancer cells of many cancer types developed TRAIL resistance, limiting the applications of TRAIL in cancer therapies. We show here that p68 acquires a double tyrosine phosphorylation at Y593 and Y595 in TRAIL-resistant T98G glioblastoma cells. The double phosphorylations are induced by platelet-derived growth factor autocrine loop. The double phosphorylation mediates resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest that the phosphorylated p68 protects the cells from programmed cell death by preventing procaspase-8 from proteolytic cleavage. The double-phosphorylated p68 may also confer apoptosis resistance by upregulation of X-chromosome-linked inhibitor apoptosis protein-associated factor 1. In addition, exogenous expression of p68 mutant that carries mutations at the phosphorylation sites (Y593/595F) dramatically sensitizes TRAIL-resistant cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome TRAIL resistance."

Rb regulates the expression of several genes through cis-acting elements in a cell type-dependent manner through the retinoblastoma control element (RCE), which is present in some genes responsible for cell growth and differentiation (22Mulligan G. Jacks T. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 223-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This element can be positively or negatively regulated by Rb and by three nuclear proteins of 115, 95, and 80 kDa (retinoblastoma control proteins (RCPs)) that bind RCE in vitro (23Kim S.J.

RCPs were shown to be members of the Sp1 transcription factor family. The 115- and 95-kDa RCP proteins correspond to Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors, respectively, and activate RCE-mediated transcription. In contrast, the 80-kDa RCP, which is produced by internal initiation of transcription from Sp1 mRNA, acts as a potent inhibitor of Sp1/Sp3-mediated transcription (26Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T.

It seems that Rb regulates RCP-dependent transcription by direct interaction with RCPs rather than by binding to the RCE DNA sequences. Through sequence analysis, we discovered two putative RCEs in the promoter of the mouse Pcyta 1 gene. We explored the nature of these putative RCEs and their possible role in CTα regulation in C3H10T1/2 mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Materials—The luciferase vector, pGL3-basic, which contains the cDNA for Photinus pyraris luciferase, and the dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Lipofectamine and PLUS reagent, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, Schneider’s medium, fetal bovine serum, and fetal calf serum were from Invitrogen. Anti-Rb and anti-Sp1 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). ECL® immunoblotting reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture—C3H10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts and human osteosarcoma (SaOs-2) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10–15% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. Schneider SL2 cells were cultured in Schneider’s medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at room temperature. C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were arrested in G0 by incubation in culture medium with low serum (0.5%) for 72 h and released by addition of fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections with CTα promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids containing mutations that alter transcription factor binding, LUC.C7 (–1268/+38), LUC.C7delRCE1, LUC.C7delRCE2, LUC.C7delSp1B, and LUC.C7delSp1C (1 μg), were performed using a cationic liposome method (30Safinya C.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). LUC.C7 (–1268/+38) inserted into the promoter-less luciferase vector pGL3-basic (Promega) was prepared as described previously (31Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Mutations in each of the indicated sites were performed using QuikChange (Stratagene). All dishes received 1 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega) as a control for transfection efficiency. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed using the Promega dual assay system, as recommended by the manufacturer, and luminometric measurements were made using Fluskan Ascent FL Type 374 (ThermoLabsystems). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. A vector enabling expression of recombinant human Rb (CMV-Rb) was obtained from Dr. L. Schang (University of Alberta), and vectors enabling expression of recombinant human Sp1 protein were obtained from Dr. R. Tjian (pPacSp1 and pPac0) (32Courey A.J. Tjian R.

Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Total nuclear extracts of C3H10T1/2 cells grown to different stages of the cell cycle were prepared as described by Andrews and Faller (34Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides carrying the RCE and Sp1 elements: RCEC sense (5′-CCCACGCGCCCGGCCCCTCTGG-3′) and RCEC antisense (5′-CCAGAGGGGCCGGGCGCGTGGG-3′); RCEB sense (5′-GGAGGTGGCATTGACAAGAGGGCGGGCGGGAGGCGGG-3′) and RCEB antisense (5′-CCCGCCTCCCGCCCGCCCTCTTGTCAATGCCACCTCC-3′), or harboring mutations in the RCE elements: DRCEC sense (5′-AAATAAAGCCCGGCCCCTCTGG-3′), DRCEC antisense (5′-CCAGAGGGGCCGGGCTTTATTT-3′) and DRCEB sense (5′-GGAAACAACATTGACAAGAGGGCGGGCGGGAGGCGGG-3′) and DRCEB antisense (5′-CCCGCCTCCCGCCCGCCCTCTTGTCAATGTTGTTTCC-3′) sequences were synthesized by the University of Alberta DNA Core Facility. Complementary oligonucleotides (100 μm of each) were heated at 90 °C for 5 min and then slowly cooled to room temperature. Five picomoles of double-stranded oligonucleotide was 5′-labeled using T4 kinase (Invitrogen) and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For each binding reaction (40 μl), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), 20 μl of 2× binding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm dithiothreitol), 1 μg of nuclear extract, and labeled probe (20,000 cpm) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. For supershift analysis, after incubation of the probe with nuclear protein, 5 μl of antibody specific for Rb (c-15) and Sp1 (sc-59) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added for 15 min. Binding reactions were terminated by the addition of 4 μl of gel loading buffer (30% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.1% (w/v) xylene cyanol). The complex was separated on a non-denaturing 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were grown for 24 h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After serum deprivation for 72 h, cells were incubated with 1% formaldehyde for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were collected, lysed, and sonicated three times for 10 s each time at 2.5% with an ultrasonic processor XL from Heat Systems and treated as recommended by the manufacturer (Upstate). Anti-Rb (c-15) and anti-Sp1 (sc-59) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For PCR analysis, we used the following set of primers: ChIPCT1 (5′-TTgCCCTCgCCTCTACTCCTgCTC)/ChIPCT2 (5′-CTCCCgCCCgCCCTCTTgTC) and CB001 (5′-CCACACATCCggAATTCC)/CB002 (5-CACCgACTAgCgAAgTC). PCR was performed using 2.5 μl of template DNA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 20 pmol of each primer for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. For the assays with LUC.C7delRCE plasmids we used a set of primers, ChIPCT1 and GLP2, chosen specifically to detect the episomal CTα promoter but not the chromosomal promoter. CT Activity—Cells were collected in 1 ml of homogenization buffer A. The cells were counted then sonicated for 20 s at 4 °C. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 5 min to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells. Aliquots of supernatant were used for CT activity assays. All protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. CT activity in the homogenate was determined in the presence of PC:oleate vesicles by monitoring the conversion of phospho[3H]choline to CDP-[3H]choline, as previously described (35Pelech S.L. Pritchard P.H. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8283-8286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—For each transcript of interest, PCR primers (mouse CTα-F, GCT AAA GTC AAT TCG AGG AA; mouse CTα-R, CAT AGG GCT TAC TAA AGT CAA CT; mouse B2MG-F, GCT ATC CAG AAA ACC CCT CAA; mouse B2MG-R, CAT GTC TCG ATC CCA GTA GAC GGT; human Rb1-F, ATT CTG CAT TGG TGC TAA AAG; human Rb1-R, CTC CTG TTC TGA CCT CGC; human Sp1-F, GGC TGT GGG AAA GTG TAT G; and human Sp1-R, TTC TGG TGG GTC TTG ATA TGT) suitable for SYBR green-based qPCR (Simpson et al. (45Simpson D.A.C. Feeney S. Boyle C. Stitt A.W. Mol. Vis. 2000; 6: 178-183PubMed Google Scholar)) were designed using Oligo6 Software by Molecular Biology Insights. PCR reactions (25 μl) included Platinum Quantitative PCR Supermix-UDG (Invitrogen, 12.5 μl), 250 nm of each PCR primer, and 5 μl of cDNA template per reaction. Triplicate reactions and a “no template” control reaction were performed for each primer pair. Thermocycling was performed using the Rotor-Gene RG-3000 Thermocycler (Corbett Research), and the thermocycling conditions were 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 4 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s, 55–58 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. Upon completion of a thermocycling run, melt curve analysis was performed on the double-stranded amplicons to identify nonspecific amplification products. Normalized CT data were used to calculate expression ratios between the sample and control groups. CTα Proximal Promoter Contains Two RCEs—Rb regulates transcription of the c-fos, c-myc, and transforming growth factor-β promoters through the RCE in transient assays in either a positive or negative manner depending upon cell type (26Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Horowitz J.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 597-608PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence examination of the CTα proximal promoter has revealed that it contains target sequences for Rb termed RCEs, which are present in the promoter regions of a number of growth factor genes (26Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Horowitz J.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 597-608PubMed Google Scholar). CTRCE1 and CTRCE2 are located, respectively, in positions –145 and –80 relative to the transcriptional start point. CTRCE1 and CTRCE2 are shown in Fig. 1, and these RCEs are identical to those identified in the c-myc (for CTRCE1, see Fig. 1) and c-fos (for CTRCE2, see Fig. 1) promoters. Mutations That Alter the RCEs Abolish CTα Expression—To evaluate the role of these putative RCEs in CTα expression we generated two reporter plasmids in which the 1268-bp CTα proximal promoter (LUC.C7 (31Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) harbors mutations that alter each of the RCE elements (the RCE2 ggtgg was changed to aatgg and the RCE1 ccacg was changed to cctcg). We named these plasmids LUC.C7delRCE1 and LUC.C7delRCE2, respectively. C3H10T1/2 embryonic mouse fibroblasts were transfected with each of these plasmids plus pSV-β-galactosidase as a transfection control. After transfection, cells were synchronized by serum deprivation, and samples were taken at both G0 and S (20 h after cell cycle induction) phases of the cell cycle. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured. The results shown in Fig. 2 indicate that each of the RCE binding sites is essential to maintain basal CTα transcription. A pronounced decrease in luciferase activity was evident with both of the mutated plasmids at both the G0 and S phases of the cell cycle. Rb Overexpression Alters CTα Promoter Activity but Does Not Restore CTα Expression from Promoters with Deletions in either RCE1 or RCE2—To investigate the role of Rb in the regulation of CTα expression, we co-transfected each of the reporter constructs with a plasmid designed to overexpress human Rb (CMV-Rb) or an empty plasmid (CMV-0), and pSV-β-galactosidase as a transfection control. Rb overexpression was assessed using qPCR; the relative Rb mRNA copy number was 0 in untransfected cells and 20 in transfected cells. We measured luciferase and β-galactosidase activities in extracts obtained from cells that had been arrested in G0 or in cells synchronized to S phase. The results obtained by reporter assays (Fig. 3A) indicate that Rb is involved in regulating CTα expression in different ways depending on the phase of the cell cycle. In quiescent cells Rb induced CTα expression, but during the S phase Rb repressed CTα expression. When either of the RCE elements was mutated, these two effects were abolished such that the activity of the promoter reached a very low level, as previously demonstrated (Figs. 2 and 3). These results indicate that RCE elements are involved in maintaining the basal level of CTα transcription and that the regulation by Rb requires intact RCE elements. To understand the physiological consequences of the effect of Rb on CTα transcription, we measured CT activity in the same extracts. When Rb was overexpressed during G0 phase, CT activity was increased by 21%; this increase was not masked by the activity of the endogenous enzyme. However, we did not observe any change in CT activity after Rb overexpression during S phase (Fig. 3B). The latter result might be explained by the low (10%) transient transfection efficiency of these cells. In this case, the decrease observed in CTα mRNA (measured as reporter assay) was not reflected in enzyme activity due to the endogenous CT activity in non-transfected cells. We did not attempt to overexpress Rb in stable cell lines, because this would be expected to alter cell cycle progression (36Sabah M. Cummins R. Leader M. Kay E. Appl. Immunohistochem. Mol. Morphol. 2006; 14: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Rb Regulation of CTα Expression Involves Sp1 Binding Elements—Udvadia et al. (26Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Horowitz J.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 597-608PubMed Google Scholar, 27Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Higgins P.D. Murata Y. Martin K.H. Humphrey P.A. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3265-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that one of the factors (RCP) that binds to the RCE elements is a member of the Sp1 family. In previous experiments we identified Sp1 as an important regulator of CTα expression during the cell cycle. We found that phosphorylated Sp1 binds to the Sp1 binding site B thereby activating CTα expression when the cells reach S phase (19Banchio C. Schang L.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32457-32464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 37Banchio C. Schang L.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40220-40226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Otherwise, in quiescent cells the complex between Sp1/E2F-Rb-histone deacetylase represses CTα expression (20Banchio C. Lingrell S. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10010-10015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the latter case, Sp1 binds to Sp1 binding site C that was identified as a negative modulator of CTα expression (19Banchio C. Schang L.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32457-32464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because both RCE sites are located close to Sp1 binding sites (Fig. 1), we investigated the relative effect of Rb overexpression on CTα expression when Sp1 binding site B or C was mutated. We co-transfected cells with the reporter constructs LUC.C7, LUC.C7delSp1(B), or LUC.C7delSp1(C) plus CMV-Rb or an empty plasmid (Fig. 4). Rb overexpression was confirmed by qPCR (data not shown). When a reporter construct with mutations in the Sp1 site C was analyzed, we observed an increase of luciferase activity in both G0 and S phases of the cell cycle, as was previously observed (19Banchio C. Schang L.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32457-32464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, when Rb was overexpressed in these cells, the transcriptional activity profile reverted to that in control cells (no Rb overexpression and wild-type promoter), indicating that the induction of CTα expression by Rb in G0 phase requires an intact Sp1 binding site C. In cells transfected with LUC.C7delSp1B, CTα reporter activity decreased compared with LUC.C7, as expected for a key regulator of CTα (19Banchio C. Schang L.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32457-32464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 38Bakovic M. Waite K.A. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in cells that also expressed Rb, luciferase expression during S phase was partially restored, so that the level of CTα transcription was similar to that in cells transfected with LUC.C7 in S phase without Rb. These results indicate that Rb overexpression imitates the effect of Sp1 binding to Sp1 binding site B, at least during the S phase, or alters the modulator effect that Sp1 causes through the Sp1 binding site C during the same phase. Sp1 Stimulates CTα Transcription, and Sp1-mediated Transcription Is Stimulated by the Rb Protein—Because our data suggest that both Sp1 and Rb regulate CTα expression, we investigated the contribution of each factor by assessing CTα expression in cells lacking one of these factors. We chose Drosophila Schneider SL2 cells and human osteoblastic SaOs-2 cells that do not express Sp1 (32Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) and Rb (39Hellwinkel O.J. Muller J. Pollmann A. Kabisch H. J. Gene. Med. 2005; 7: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), respectively. Each cell type was transfected with the indicated plasmids (Fig. 5A). Twenty-four hours after transfection we measured luciferase and β-galactosidase activities, CTα mRNA levels, and CTα activity. Interestingly, the rate of CTα transcription measured by reporter assay in SaOs-2 cells was very low and was not induced or restored by overexpression of either Rb or Sp1 (Fig. 5A). We measured CTα mRNA expression by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and CT activity but did not detect any changes after Rb and/or Sp1 overexpression in these cells (Fig. 5, B and C). In SL2 cells the transcriptional activity was low in the absence of Sp1 as expected for a key activator of CTα expression (19Banchio C. Schang L.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32457-32464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 38Bakovic M. Waite K.A. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, transcription of the luciferase reporter was induced by overexpression of Sp1 and Rb. As shown in Fig. 5A, stimulation of CTα transcription by Rb was much higher upon co-expression of Sp1 compared with transfection of Rb alone. Maximum activation was achieved when both Sp1 and Rb proteins were co-expressed. We also evaluated whether the stimulation of luciferase expression that we observed in the reporter assay had any consequence for CT activity and cell physiology. CT activity in SL2 cells overexpressing Rb and Sp1 was 32% higher than in control cells (Fig. 5B). It is important to note that Rb and Sp1 expression in those cells was confirmed by qPCR (see Fig. 5C). These observations indicate that Rb directly or indirectly regulates the ability of Sp1 to modulate CTα expression in intact cells. Sp1 and Rb Bind in Vivo to the CTα Promoter—The association between Rb and Sp1 and the CTα promoter was monitored by ChIP assay using chromatin prepared from C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts. Target sequences were detected by PCR using the sets of primers described under “Experimental Procedures.” A portion of the CTα promoter was found in association with anti-Sp1 and anti-Rb immunoprecipitates in chromatin extracted from these cells (Fig. 6). As a control chromatin was immunoprecipitated with anti-IgG. In these samples, no CTα promoter was detected (Fig. 6, lane 2). Sp1 and Rb Bind in Vitro to Probes Containing RCE and Sp1 Elements—The previous experiments demonstrate that Sp1 and Rb cooperatively regulate CTα expression. To determine if Sp1 and Rb form a DNA-protein complex with the Sp1 and/or the RCE-DNA motif, we performed gel-shift assays and supershift experiments using anti-Rb and anti-Sp1 antibodies. We probed two different DNA motifs, one containing the RCE1 and Sp1C elements (named RCEC), the other having the RCE2 and the Sp1B elements (named RCEB). Nuclear extracts were isolated from C3H10T1/2 cells synchronized to G0 and S phases. With nuclear extract from G0 and RCEB as a probe, two complexes (Fig. 7, lane 2, arrows a and b) were detected. After incubation with anti-Sp1 antibody (Fig. 7, lane 3) the intensity of the lower band b decreased. Upon incubation with anti-Rb antibody the upper band a disappeared (Fig. 7, lane 4). With the RCEC probe, we observed two bands whose mobilities were so similar that they could not be properly defined (Fig. 7, lane 6). The intensities of the two bands decreased when the extract was incubated with anti-Sp1 antibody (Fig. 7, lane 7). However, the intensity of only the upper band decreased when the extract was incubated with anti-Rb antibody (Fig. 7, lane 8). A similar experiment was performed using nuclear extracts from cells in S phase (Fig. 8). When the extract was incubated with the RCEB probe, one complex (Fig. 8, lane 2 arrow a) was detected whose intensity and mobility did not change when the assay was performed in the presence of anti-Sp1 antibody (Fig. 8, lane 3). However, incubation with anti-Rb antibodies decreased the intensity of the band (Fig. 8, lane 4). When the same extract was incubated with RCEC probe one band was observed (Fig. 8, lane 6), whose intensity decreased after incubation with anti-Sp1 antibodies (Fig. 8, lane 7). Furthermore, with anti-Rb we observed a supershifted band (Fig. 8, lane 8, arrow b). Together these results demonstrate that Sp1 an"
