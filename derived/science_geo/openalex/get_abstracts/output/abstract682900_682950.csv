https://openalex.org/W3210696507,"Adipose-tissue-resident macrophages (ATMs) maintain metabolic homeostasis but also contribute to obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Central to these contrasting effects of ATMs on metabolic homeostasis is the interaction of macrophages with fatty acids. Fatty acid levels are increased within adipose tissue in various pathological and physiological conditions, but appear to initiate inflammatory responses only upon interaction with particular macrophage subsets within obese adipose tissue. The molecular basis underlying these divergent outcomes is likely due to phenotypic differences between ATM subsets, although how macrophage polarization state influences the metabolism of exogenous fatty acids is relatively unknown. Herein, using stable isotope-labeled and nonlabeled fatty acids in combination with mass spectrometry lipidomics, we show marked differences in the utilization of exogenous fatty acids within inflammatory macrophages (M1 macrophages) and macrophages involved in tissue homeostasis (M2 macrophages). Specifically, the accumulation of exogenous fatty acids within triacylglycerols and cholesterol esters is significantly higher in M1 macrophages, while there is an increased enrichment of exogenous fatty acids within glycerophospholipids, ether lipids, and sphingolipids in M2 macrophages. Finally, we show that functionally distinct ATM populations in vivo have distinct lipid compositions. Collectively, this study identifies new aspects of the metabolic reprogramming that occur in distinct macrophage polarization states. The channeling of exogenous fatty acids into particular lipid synthetic pathways may contribute to the sensitivity/resistance of macrophage subsets to the inflammatory effects of increased environmental fatty acid levels."
https://openalex.org/W3209067964,"Patterns of diurnal activity differ substantially between individuals, with early risers and late sleepers being examples of opposite chronotypes. Growing evidence suggests that the late chronotype significantly impacts the risk of developing mood disorders, obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. Despite the vast potential of utilizing chronotype information for precision medicine, those factors that shape chronotypes remain poorly understood. Here, we assessed whether the various chronotypes are associated with different gut microbiome compositions. Using metagenomic sequencing analysis, we established a distinct signature associated with chronotype based on two bacterial genera, Alistipes (elevated in “larks”) and Lachnospira (elevated in “owls”). We identified three metabolic pathways associated with the early chronotype, and linked distinct dietary patterns with different chronotypes. Our work demonstrates an association between the gut microbiome and chronotype and may represent the first step towards developing dietary interventions aimed at ameliorating the deleterious health correlates of the late chronotype."
https://openalex.org/W3206369475,"The production of trimethylamine (TMA) from quaternary amines such as l-carnitine or γ-butyrobetaine (4-(trimethylammonio)butanoate) by gut microbial enzymes has been linked to heart disease. This has led to interest in enzymes of the gut microbiome that might ameliorate net TMA production, such as members of the MttB superfamily of proteins, which can demethylate TMA (e.g., MttB) or l-carnitine (e.g., MtcB). Here, we show that the human gut acetogen Eubacterium limosum demethylates γ-butyrobetaine and produces MtyB, a previously uncharacterized MttB superfamily member catalyzing the demethylation of γ-butyrobetaine. Proteomic analyses of E. limosum grown on either γ-butyrobetaine or dl-lactate were employed to identify candidate proteins underlying catabolic demethylation of the growth substrate. Three proteins were significantly elevated in abundance in γ-butyrobetaine-grown cells: MtyB, MtqC (a corrinoid-binding protein), and MtqA (a corrinoid:tetrahydrofolate methyltransferase). Together, these proteins act as a γ-butyrobetaine:tetrahydrofolate methyltransferase system, forming a key intermediate of acetogenesis. Recombinant MtyB acts as a γ-butyrobetaine:MtqC methyltransferase but cannot methylate free cobalamin cofactor. MtyB is very similar to MtcB, the carnitine methyltransferase, but neither was detectable in cells grown on carnitine nor was detectable in cells grown with γ-butyrobetaine. Both quaternary amines are substrates for either enzyme, but kinetic analysis revealed that, in comparison to MtcB, MtyB has a lower apparent Km for γ-butyrobetaine and higher apparent Vmax, providing a rationale for MtyB abundance in γ-butyrobetaine-grown cells. As TMA is readily produced from γ-butyrobetaine, organisms with MtyB-like proteins may provide a means to lower levels of TMA and proatherogenic TMA-N-oxide via precursor competition.

The MttB superfamily comprises thousands of proteins found in bacteria and archaea. The first functionally described member is the namesake, MttB, the trimethylamine (TMA) methyltransferase, which initiates methanogenesis from that substrate by the methylation of a Co(I)-corrinoid protein (1Ferguson Jr., D.J.

While this has provided some insights into the functions of this highly diverse superfamily, what QAs, or other compounds, are substrates remains unknown. QAs are ubiquitous in nature and consequently found in many components of a typical human diet (10Craig S.A. Betaine in human nutrition.Am. J. Clin.

Net TMA production relies not only just on microbes producing TMA but also on those that consume the QAs that are the TMA precursors, as well as TMA itself. In this regard, the MttB superfamily occupies a unique position. Demethylation of TMA by MttB, the pyrrolysyl protein that is the founding member of the superfamily, has been suggested as a means to control TMA levels (43Brugere J.F. Borrel G. Gaci N. Tottey W.

The genomes of some intestinal isolates have also been found to encode MttB superfamily members that lack pyrrolysine, and several of these enzymes have been shown to demethylate QAs. For example, the acetogenic human gut symbiont Eubacterium limosum American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 8486 produces MtpB (8Picking J.W. Behrman E.J. Zhang L. Krzycki J.A.

Demethylation of a proatherogenic QA such as l-carnitine would render the product incapable of being used as a substrate for TMA production by any known enzyme. Members of the intestinal microbiota equipped with MttB superfamily members that demethylate proatherogenic QAs might serve as a natural governor to limit TMA production. The genome of E. limosum ATCC 8486 (44Song Y. Cho B.K.

While MtcB has such potential for l-carnitine, it must be recognized that most ingested l-carnitine is rapidly turned into γ-butyrobetaine by the gut microbiota (15Koeth R.A. Levison B.S. Culley M.K.

MtcB was previously found to have activity with γ-butyrobetaine as a methyl donor, but the activity was weak relative to its primary substrate, l-carnitine (9Kountz D.J. Behrman E.J. Zhang L.

However, the low activity of MtcB with γ-butyrobetaine provided an indication that an MttB superfamily member might carry out a robust demethylation of γ-butyrobetaine. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the human gut symbiont E. limosum ATCC 8486 is capable of growth by demethylating γ-butyrobetaine and describe a methyltransferase system that uses γ-butyrobetaine to methylate THF, forming a key catabolic intermediate of acetogenesis. Using a proteomics approach, we identified a previously uncharacterized nonpyrrolysine MttB homolog we designated MtyB. MtyB is highly abundant in γ-butyrobetaine-grown cells relative to cells grown on lactate, proline betaine, or l-carnitine, and acts as an γ-butyrobetaine:corrinoid protein methyltransferase. MtyB, along with an abundant corrinoid protein and THF-dependent methyltransferase, act as a γ-butyrobetaine:THF methyltransferase system. Michaelis–Menten kinetics comparing MtyB and the l-carnitine methyltransferase MtcB provide a physiological rationale for the observation that MtcB and MtyB are abundant only in cells grown l-carnitine or γ-butyrobetaine, respectively. Our results expand the substrate range of the MttB superfamily and show that a member of the gut microbiota can potentially intercept the l-carnitine-dependent pathway of TMAO production by consuming either l-carnitine or γ-butyrobetaine.

Understanding the movements of the body during falls is important to the design of fall prevention and management strategies, including exercise programs, mobility aids, fall detectors, protective gear, and safer environments. Video footage of real-life falls is increasingly available, and may be used with digitization software to extract kinematic features of falls. We examined the validity of this approach by conducting laboratory falling experiments, and comparing linear and angular positions and velocities measured from 3D motion capture to estimates from Kinovea 2D digitization software based on standard surveillance video (30 Hz, 640x480 pixels). We also examined how Kinovea accuracy depended on fall direction, camera angle, filtering cut-off frequency, and calibration technique. For a camera oriented perpendicular to the plane of the fall (90 degrees), Kinovea position data filtered at 10 Hz, and video calibration using a 2D grid, mean root mean square errors were 0.050 m or 9% of the signal amplitude and 0.22 m/s (7%) for vertical position and velocity, and 0.035 m (6%) and 0.16 m/s (7%) for horizontal position and velocity. Errors in angular measures averaged over 2-fold higher in sideways than forward or backward falls, due to out-of-plane movement of the knees and elbows. Errors in horizontal velocity were 2.5-fold higher for a 30 than 90 degree camera angle, and 1.6-fold higher for calibration using participants' height (1D) instead of a 2D grid. When compared to 10 Hz, filtering at 3 Hz caused velocity errors to increase 1.4-fold. Our results demonstrate that Kinovea can be applied to 30 Hz video to measure linear positions and velocities to within 9% accuracy. Lower accuracy was observed for angular kinematics of the upper and lower limb in sideways falls, and for horizontal measures from 30 degree cameras or 1D height-based calibration."

This study examined STING's role in angiogenesis and the formation of type H vessels, a specific subtype of bone vessels that regulates bone healing. Different concentrations of 2',3'-cGAMP, and H-151 or C-176 were applied to activate or inhibit STING, respectively. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used to examine the effect of STING on angiogenesis in vitro; cell viability, cell migration, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions were performed. Also, the metatarsal experiment was applied as ex vivo proof. Bone fracture or defect mice models were used to examine the effect of STING in vivo; the bone healing process was evaluated by radiography weekly and by μCT on the 14th day after surgery. The formation of type H vessels (CD31hi Emcnhi endothelial cells) and osteogenesis (OCN-positive cells) was assessed using the cryosection and paraffin section. STING activation inhibited angiogenesis both in vitro and ex vivo and slowed down the bone healing process in vivo. Histological analysis showed an increased callus formation, fewer type H vessels, and almost no callus mineralization in the STING activation group compared to the control group. By contrast, H-151 (a hsSTING inhibitor) promoted angiogenesis at a low dose. Moreover, inhibition of mmSTING by C-176 enhanced type H vessels' formation, implying osteogenesis promotion in bone healing (higher bone volume density and more OCN-positive cells). Our data suggested that STING inhibition accelerates the bone healing process while enhancing type H vessel formation."

Although searching for meaning may imply lower personal well-being, we find that meaning-seekers are more motivated to perform costly prosocial actions for the sake of others' well-being, given the perceived meaningfulness of these behaviors. Studies 1-4 (N = 780) show that meaning-seeking correlates with the motivation to engage in a range of costly prosocial behaviors. Meaning-seeking is further shown to be distinct from pursuing happiness in its relationship with costly prosociality (Study 2 & 3) and to share a stronger association with high-cost than low-cost prosociality (Study 3 & 4). Study 5 (N = 370; pre-registered) further shows that the search for meaning is related to costly prosocial behavior in the recent past. While our studies are cross-sectional, the pattern of findings suggests that seeking meaning (rather than happiness) may play an important role in motivating altruistic tendencies."

Many works in literature aim for a better understanding of these structures and their role in the evolution process and the behavior of plants. Although stomata studies in dicots species have advanced considerably in the past years, even there is not much knowledge about the stomata of cereal grasses. Due to the high morphological variation of stomata traits intra- and inter-species, detecting and classifying stomata automatically becomes challenging. For this reason, in this work, we propose a new system for automatic stomata classification and detection in microscope images for maize cultivars based on transfer learning strategy of different deep convolution neural netwoks (DCNN). Our performed experiments show that our system achieves an approximated accuracy of 97.1% in identifying stomata regions using classifiers based on deep learning features, which figures out as a nearly perfect classification system. As the stomata are responsible for several plant functionalities, this work represents an important advance for maize research, providing an accurate system in replacing the current manual task of categorizing these pores on microscope images. Furthermore, this system can also be a reference for studies using images from different cereal grasses."

https://openalex.org/W3206342926,"Bromodomain protein 4 (BRD4) is a transcriptional and epigenetic regulator that is a therapeutic target in many cancers and inflammatory diseases. BRD4 plays important roles in transcription as an active kinase, which phosphorylates the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), the proto-oncogene c-MYC, and transcription factors TAF7 and CDK9. BRD4 is also a passive scaffold that recruits transcription factors. Despite these well-established functions, there has been little characterization of BRD4's biophysical properties or its kinase activity. We report here that the 156 kD mouse BRD4 exists in an extended dimeric conformation with a sedimentation coefficient of ∼6.7 S and a high frictional ratio. Deletion of the conserved B motif (aa 503-548) disrupts BRD4's dimerization. BRD4 kinase activity maps to amino acids 351 to 598, which span bromodomain-2, the B motif, and the BID domain (BD2-B-BID) and contributes to the in vivo phosphorylation of its substrates. As further assessed by analytical ultracentrifugation, BRD4 directly binds purified Pol II CTD. Importantly, the conserved A motif of BRD4 is essential for phosphorylation of Pol II CTD, but not for phosphorylation of TAF7, mapping its binding site to the A motif. Peptides of the viral MLV integrase (MLVIN) protein and cellular histone lysine methyltransferase, NSD3, which have been shown by NMR to bind to the extra-terminal (ET) domain, also are phosphorylated by BRD4. Thus, BRD4 has multiple distinct substrate-binding sites and a common kinase domain. These results provide new insights into the structure and kinase function of BRD4."
https://openalex.org/W3206598498,"CD4+ T cells differentiate into subsets that promote immunity or minimize damage to the host. T helper 17 cells (Th17) are effector cells that function in inflammatory responses. T regulatory cells (Tregs) maintain tolerance and prevent autoimmunity by secreting immunosuppressive cytokines and expressing check point receptors. While the functions of Th17 and Treg cells are different, both cell fate trajectories require T cell receptor (TCR) and TGF-β receptor (TGF-βR) signals, and Th17 polarization requires an additional IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) signal. Utilizing high-resolution phosphoproteomics, we identified that both synergistic and additive interactions between TCR, TGF-βR, and IL-6R shape kinase signaling networks to differentially regulate key pathways during the early phase of Treg versus Th17 induction. Quantitative biochemical analysis revealed that CD4+ T cells integrate receptor signals via SMAD3, which is a mediator of TGF-βR signaling. Treg induction potentiates the formation of the canonical SMAD3/4 trimer to activate a negative feedback loop through kinases PKA and CSK to suppress TCR signaling, phosphatidylinositol metabolism, and mTOR signaling. IL-6R signaling activates STAT3 to bind SMAD3 and block formation of the SMAD3/4 trimer during the early phase of Th17 induction, which leads to elevated TCR and PI3K signaling. These data provide a biochemical mechanism by which CD4+ T cells integrate TCR, TGF-β, and IL-6 signals via generation of alternate SMAD3 complexes that control the development of early signaling networks to potentiate the choice of Treg versus Th17 cell fate."

However, evidence supporting these functions of NPFF is mostly pharmacological, leaving the physiological relevance unaddressed. Here we examined the physiological impact of lack of NPFF signalling in both genders using a Npff-/- mouse model. NPFF expression in the mouse is restricted to the spinal cord and brainstem while its cognate receptor NPFFR2 has wider distribution throughout the brain. Both male and female Npff-/- mice showed reduced repetitive behaviors evidenced in the marble burying test and self-grooming test. A decrease in anxiety-related behaviors in the Npff-/- mice was also observe in the open field test and to a lesser degree in an elevated plus maze test. Moreover, both male and female Npff-/- mice exhibited increased water intake resulting from increases in drinking size, rather than number of drinking events. During a fasting-refeeding challenge, Npff-/- mice of both genders displayed alterations in reparatory exchange ratio that reflect a greater fuel type flexibility. Npff-/- mice were otherwise wild-type-like regarding body weight, body composition, feeding behaviors, locomotion or energy expenditure. Together, these findings reveal the important physiological roles of NPFF signalling in the regulation of anxiety-related and repetitive behaviors, fluid homeostasis and oxidative fuel selection, highlighting the therapeutical potential of the NPFF system in a number of behavioral and metabolic disorders."

Student participants (N = 30) took part in what they thought was a visual search study, when a confederate posing as another participant entered the room. Whilst all participants avoided looking at the confederate, those with higher SA fixated for a shorter duration during their first fixation on him, and executed fewer fixations and saccades overall as well as exhibiting a shorter scanpath. These findings are indicative of additional avoidance in the higher SA participants. In contrast to previous experimental work, we found no evidence of social hypervigilance or hyperscanning in high SA individuals. The results indicate that in unstructured social settings, avoidance rather than vigilance predominates, especially in those with higher SA."

However, the initial activating mutations induce homeostatic feedback mechanisms that limit ERK activity. How ERK activation reaches the tumor-promoting levels that overcome the feedback and drive malignant progression is unclear. We show here that the lung lineage transcription factor NKX2-1 suppresses ERK activity. In human tissue samples and cell lines, xenografts, and genetic mouse models, NKX2-1 induces the ERK phosphatase DUSP6, which inactivates ERK. In tumor cells from late-stage LUAD with silenced NKX2-1, re-introduction of NKX2-1 induces DUSP6 and inhibits tumor growth and metastasis. We show that DUSP6 is necessary for NKX2-1-mediated inhibition of tumor progression in vivo and that DUSP6 expression is sufficient to inhibit RAS-driven LUAD. Our results indicate that NKX2-1 silencing, and thereby DUSP6 downregulation, is a mechanism by which early LUAD can unleash ERK hyperactivation for tumor progression."

First, a pair of asymmetrical step impedance resonators (ASIR) is used to implement a dual band filter, then a half wavelength uniform impedance resonator is added below to the transmission line to achieve a triple band response. The proposed filter resonates at frequencies of 3.7 GHz, 6.6 GHz, and 9 GHz with the fractional bandwidth of 7.52%, 5.1%, and 4.44%, respectively. By adjusting the physical length ratio (α) and the impedance ratio (R) of the asymmetric SIR, the proposed fundamental frequencies of the triple BPF are obtained. Moreover, the coupling coefficient (Ke) and external quality factor (Qe) are investigated between the resonators and the input/output ports of the transmission line and are calculated using full-wave EM simulator HFSS. In addition, five transmission zeros are introduced near the passbands to increase the filter selectivity. Finally, the proposed filter is designed and fabricated with a size of 13.69 × 25 mm (0.02 λg × 0.03 λg), where λg represents the guiding wavelength in the first passband. The simulated and measured results have a good correspondence, thus confirming the design concept."

ROH detection analyses were used to estimate autozygosity and inbreeding and to identify genomic regions with high frequency of ROH, which might reflect selection signatures. Comparative analysis among breeds revealed differences in length and distribution of ROH and inbreeding levels. The Charolais, Limousine, Sarda, and Sardo Bruna breeds were found to have a high frequency of short ROH (~ 15.000); Calvana and Mucca Pisana presented also runs longer than 16 Mbp. The highest level of average genomic inbreeding was observed in Tuscan breeds, around 0.3, while Sardinian and cosmopolitan breeds showed values around 0.2. The population structure and genetic distances were analyzed through principal component and multidimensional scaling analyses, and resulted in a clear separation among the breeds, with clusters related to productive purposes. The frequency of ROH occurrence revealed eight breed-specific genomic regions where genes of potential selective and conservative interest are located (e.g. MYOG, CHI3L1, CHIT1 (BTA16), TIMELESS, APOF, OR10P1, OR6C4, OR2AP1, OR6C2, OR6C68, CACNG2 (BTA5), COL5A2 and COL3A1 (BTA2)).

This manuscript presents a novel methodology, ""Hollow-tree Super"" (HOTS), designed to resolve and visualize feature importance in boosted tree models involving a large number of features. Further, this methodology allows for accurate investigation of the directionality and magnitude various features have on classification and incorporates cross-validation to improve the accuracy and validity of the determined features of importance.Using the Iris dataset, we first highlight the characteristics of HOTS by comparing it to other commonly used techniques for feature importance, including Gini Importance, Partial Dependence Plots, and Permutation Importance, and explain how HOTS resolves the weaknesses present in these three strategies for investigating feature importance. We then demonstrate how HOTS can be utilized in high dimensional spaces such as neuroscientific setting, by taking 60 Schizophrenic subjects from the publicly available SchizConnect database and applying the method to determine which regions of the brain were most important for the positive and negative classification of schizophrenia as determined by the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS).HOTS effectively replicated and supported the findings of feature importance for classification of the Iris dataset when compared to Gini importance, Partial Dependence Plots and Permutation importance, determining 'petal length' as the most important feature for positive and negative classification. When applied to the Schizconnect dataset, HOTS was able to resolve from 379 independent features, the top 10 most important features for classification, as well as their directionality for classification and magnitude compared to other features. Cross-validation supported that these same 10 features were consistently used in the decision-making process across multiple trees, and these features were localised primarily to the occipital and parietal cortices, commonly disturbed brain regions in those afflicted with Schizophrenia.HOTS effectively overcomes previous challenges of identifying feature importance at scale, and can be utilized across a swathe of disciplines. As computational power and data quantity continues to expand, it is imperative that a methodology is developed that is able to handle the demands of working with large datasets that contain a large number of features. This approach represents a unique way to investigate both the directionality and magnitude of feature importance when working at scale within a boosted tree model that can be easily visualized within commonly used software."

Psychological effect of COVID-19 on students is increased due to the reopening of schools. The psychological effect of the pandemic is increasing along with physical aspect of health. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the psychological impact of Covid-19 and its contributing factors of students’ behavior in Ethiopia. Methods A cross sectional design was conducted from November to December 2020. Data were collected using pre tested self- administered questionnaire from secondary school students in Gondar city North West Ethiopia. Stratified simple random sampling technique was used to select 403 secondary school students. Data were entered and cleaned with Epidata version 4.62 and exported for analysis STATA version 14. Multivariable logistic regression and multiple linear regression were used to show the association of dependent and independent variables. Independent variables in relation to dependent variable measured using odd ratios and B coefficient with 95% confidence interval for Covid-19 anxiety and preventive behavior of Covid-19 respectively were used. Results A total of 370 students were participated giving response rate of 92%. The prevalence of Covid-19 anxiety and obsession among secondary school students were 38.1% and 40.27% respectively. Being 11 th grade 54% (AOR = 0.46; 95%CI:0.22, 0.95) and increased knowledge16% (AOR = 0.84;95%CI: 0.77, 0.89) score associated with decreased COVID-19 anxiety while Covid-19 obsession, 14.51 times (AOR = 14.51;95%CI: 8.05, 26.17), and being female 1.6 times (AOR = 1.6; 95%CI: 1.01, 2.51) increased Covid-19 Anxiety. Furthermore, increased self-efficacy 0.5 times (B = 0.5; 95%CI: 0.28, 0.62), and increased cues to action 0.4 times (B = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.69) increased preventive behavior of Covid-19 while perceived barrier 0.1 times (B = -0.1; 95%CI:-0.22, 0.01) decrease preventive behavior of Covid-19. Conclusion Almost two individuals of five participants developed COVID-19 anxiety and COVID-19 obsession. Being grade 11 th and knowledge were negatively associated with anxiety while being female and being obsessed with COVID-19 were positively associated with anxiety. No variable was associated with obsession of Covid-19. Intervention is needed to reduce anxiety among females. Furthermore, perceived barrier, self-efficacy and cues to action were significant factors of preventive behaviour of Covid-19. Therefore, to increase preventive behaviour of Covid-19, information, education and communication and behavioural change communication should be targeted on reducing barriers and increasing motivations and confidences."
https://openalex.org/W3208546203,"Mentalization theory is concerned with the capacity to notice, and make sense of, thoughts and feelings in self and others. This development may be healthy or impaired and therefore, by extension, it may be theorized that expertise in mentalizing can exist. Furthermore, a continuum from impairment to expertise should exist within separate dimensions of mentalizing: of self and of others. This study hypothesized that three groups would be distinguishable on the basis of their mentalizing capacities. In a cross-sectional design, Psychological Therapists (‘expert’ mentalizers; n = 51), individuals with a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder (‘poor’ mentalizers; n = 43) and members of the general population (‘non-clinical controls’; n = 35) completed a battery of self-report measures. These assessed the mentalizing of self and of others (using an extended version of the Reflective Function Questionnaire (RFQ18)), alexithymia and cognitive empathy. As hypothesized, Psychological Therapists’ scores were higher than controls on self-mentalizing and control group scores were higher than those with BPD. Cognitive empathy scores in the BPD group indicated markedly lower capacities than the other two groups. Contrary to predictions, no significant differences were found between groups on mentalizing others in RFQ18 scores. The Psychological Therapist and BPD profiles were characterized by differential impairment with regards to mentalizing self and others but in opposing directions. Results suggest that the RFQ18 can identify groups with expertise in mentalizing. Implications of these results for the effectiveness of psychological therapy and of Psychological Therapists are discussed."

To delineate this pathway, we identified and then cloned the CaSR responsive region including the promoter of mouse Cldn14 into a luciferase reporter vector. This 1500 bp sequence upstream of the 5′ UTR of Cldn14 variant 1, conferred increased reporter activity in the presence of high extracellular Ca2+ (5 mM) relative to a lower (0.5 mM) concentration. Assessment of Cldn14 reporter activity in response to increased extracellular Ca2+ in the presence or absence of specific inhibitors confirmed signaling through PLC and p38, but not JNK. Overexpression of SP1 attenuated Cldn14 reporter activity in response to CasR signaling. SP1 is expressed in the TAL and phosphorylation was attenuated by CaSR signaling. Finally, activating mutations in the CaSR increased Cldn14 reporter activity while a dominant negative mutation in the CaSR inhibited it. Together, these studies suggest that basolateral activation of the CASR leads to increased Cldn14 expression via a PLC- stimulated p38 pathway that prevents Sp1 mediated repression."
https://openalex.org/W3208836928,"Soluble Klotho (sKL) is closely related to insulin resistance, which is a major factor in the progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of sKL in the regulation of DCM and the mechanism involved. A mouse model of type 2 diabetes was induced by high-fat diet and streptozotocin injection. An insulin-resistant cardiac fibroblast model was established by high glucose and high insulin. KL gene overexpression was achieved in vivo and vitro through transfection with an adenovirus-harboring KL-cDNA. Gene overexpression was used to evaluate the role of sKL in the pathophysiologic characteristics of DCM. Insulin-resistant cardiac fibroblasts reduced sKL expression and collagen deposition. Diabetic mice constructed by streptozotocin exhibited severe insulin resistance, inflammation, fibrosis, left ventricular dysfunction, and sKL downregulation. The overexpression of sKL mitigated insulin resistance and metabolic disturbance; inflammation, fibrosis, and upregulated collagen I/III content ratio in diabetic state were significantly reduced. Our findings were accompanied by notable moderation of cardiac function. Further, blunted phosphorylation of Akt was restored with sKL gene overexpression, and activated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in DCM was reduced. Our results suggest that sKL protein overexpression exerts a defensive measure by ameliorating selective insulin resistance in mouse DCM, thus revealing its underlying mechanism for potential human DCM treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3208920986,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the nerve growth factor family which has been extensively studied for its roles in neural development, long-term memory, brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases. BDNF signaling through tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) stimulates neuronal cell survival. For this reason, small molecule TrkB agonists are under pre-clinical develoment for the treatment of a range of neurodegenerative diseases and injuries. Our laboratory recently reported BDNF is secreted by pro-regenerative endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) which support hematopoietic reconstitution following total body irradiation (TBI). Here we report BDNF-TrkB signaling plays a novel regenerative role in bone marrow and thymic regeneration following radiation injury. Exogenous administration of BDNF or TrkB agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) following myelosuppressive radiation injury promoted faster recovery of mature blood cells and hematopoietic stem cells capable of multi-lineage reconstitution. BDNF promotes hematopoietic regeneration via activation of PDGFRα+ bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) which increase secretion of hematopoietic cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in response to TrkB activation. These data suggest pharmacologic activation of the BDNF pathway with either BDNF or 7,8-DHF may be beneficial for treatment of radiation or chemotherapy induced myelosuppression."
https://openalex.org/W3209220081,"Tuberculosis (TB), which is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Increasing lines of evidence indicate that certain individuals, which are termed resisters, are naturally resistant to TB infection. The resister phenotype has been linked to host efficient innate immune responses, but the underlying mechanisms and the key immune factors remain unclear. Here, we find that upon Mtb infection, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from TB resisters exhibited distinctly higher production of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, higher ratio of bacteria in acidic vacuoles, and lower intracellular bacterial loads, as compared to that from the healthy controls, individuals with latent TB infection, and TB patients. Such enhanced anti-Mtb immune capacity of macrophages from resisters largely depends on histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), whose expression is specifically maintained in MDMs from TB resisters during Mtb infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HDAC6 is required for acidification of Mtb-containing phagosomes in macrophages, thus controlling the intracellular survival of Mtb. Taken together, these findings unravel an indispensable role of HDAC6 in human innate resistance against Mtb infection, suggesting that HDAC6 may serve as a marker for individual TB risk as well as a novel host-directed anti-TB therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W3211066948,"Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by deficiency of the lysosomal membrane enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) and the subsequent accumulation of its substrate, glucosylceramide (GC). Mostly missense mutations of the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) cause GCase misfolding and inhibition of proper lysosomal trafficking. The accumulated GC leads to lysosomal dysfunction and impairs the autophagy pathway. GD types 2 and 3 (GD2-3), or the neuronopathic forms, affect not only the Central Nervous System (CNS) but also have severe systemic involvement and progressive bone disease. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) successfully treats the hematologic manifestations; however, due to the lack of equal distribution of the recombinant enzyme in different organs, it has no direct impact on the nervous system and has minimal effect on bone involvement. Small molecules have the potential for better tissue distribution. Ambroxol (AMB) is a pharmacologic chaperone that partially recovers the mutated GCase activity and crosses the blood-brain barrier. Eliglustat (EGT) works by inhibiting UDP-glucosylceramide synthase, an enzyme that catalyzes GC biosynthesis, reducing GC influx load into the lysosome. Substrate reduction therapy (SRT) using EGT is associated with improvement in GD bone marrow burden score and bone mineral density parallel with the improvement in hematological parameters. We assessed the effects of EGT and AMB on GCase activity and autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) in primary cell lines derived from patients with GD2-3 and compared to cell lines from healthy controls. We found that EGT, same as AMB, enhanced GCase activity in control cells and that an individualized response, that varied with GBA mutations, was observed in cells from patients with GD2-3. EGT and AMB enhanced the formation of lysosomal/late endosomal compartments and improved autophagy, independent of GBA mutations. Both AMB and EGT increased mitochondrial mass and density in GD2-3 fibroblasts, suggesting enhancement of mitochondrial function by activating the mitochondrial membrane potential. These results demonstrate that EGT and AMB, with different molecular mechanisms of action, enhance GCase activity and improve autophagy-lysosome dynamics and mitochondrial functions."
https://openalex.org/W3208184199,"The prevalence of coeliac disease (CD) is around 1%, but diagnosis is challenged by varied presentation and non-specific symptoms and signs. This study aimed to identify diagnostic indicators that may help identify patients at a higher risk of CD in whom further testing is warranted.International guidance for systematic review methods were followed and the review was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42020170766). Six databases were searched until April 2021. Studies investigating diagnostic indicators, such as symptoms or risk conditions, in people with and without CD were eligible for inclusion. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Summary sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values were estimated for each diagnostic indicator by fitting bivariate random effects meta-analyses.191 studies reporting on 26 diagnostic indicators were included in the meta-analyses. We found large variation in diagnostic accuracy estimates between studies and most studies were at high risk of bias. We found strong evidence that people with dermatitis herpetiformis, migraine, family history of CD, HLA DQ2/8 risk genotype, anaemia, type 1 diabetes, osteoporosis, or chronic liver disease are more likely than the general population to have CD. Symptoms, psoriasis, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, fractures, type 2 diabetes, and multiple sclerosis showed poor diagnostic ability. A sensitivity analysis revealed a 3-fold higher risk of CD in first-degree relatives of CD patients.Targeted testing of individuals with dermatitis herpetiformis, migraine, family history of CD, HLA DQ2/8 risk genotype, anaemia, type 1 diabetes, osteoporosis, or chronic liver disease could improve case-finding for CD, therefore expediting appropriate treatment and reducing adverse consequences. Migraine and chronic liver disease are not yet included as a risk factor in all CD guidelines, but it may be appropriate for these to be added. Future research should establish the diagnostic value of combining indicators."
https://openalex.org/W3209621807,"The production of bioactive peptides from animal-based raw materials highly depends on enzymatic hydrolysis. Porcine placenta is an underutilized biomass in Thailand's pig farms, yet it is still a source of proteins and beneficial compounds. Porcine placenta could be used as a protein substrate for the production of enzymatic hydrolysate, which could be employed as a functional food ingredient in the future. The goal of this study was to enzymatically produce porcine placenta hydrolysates (PPH) using three commercial enzymes (Alcalase, Flavouzyme, and papain) and evaluate their in vitro antioxidant and antibacterial activity. The degree of hydrolysis (DH) increased as the enzyme load and hydrolysis time increased, but the DH was governed by the enzyme class. The maximum DH was found after using 10% enzyme for 20 min of hydrolysis (36.60%, 31.40%, and 29.81% for Alcalase, Flavouzyme, and papain). Depending on the enzyme type and DH, peptides of various sizes (0.40-323.56 kDa) were detected in all PPH. PPH created with Alcalase had an excellent reducing capacity and metal chelating ability (p < 0.05), whereas PPH made with Flavourzyme and Papain had higher DPPH• and ABTS•+ inhibitory activities (p < 0.05). Papain-derived PPH also had a strong antibacterial effect against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, with clear zone values of 17.20 mm and 14.00 mm, respectively (p < 0.05). When PPH was transported via a gastrointestinal tract model system, its antioxidative characteristics were altered. PPH's properties and bioactivities were thus influenced by the enzyme type, enzyme concentration, and hydrolysis time used. Therefore, PPH produced from porcine placenta can be categorized as an antioxidant and antibacterial alternative."
https://openalex.org/W3206268807,"Population genetic variability in immune system genes can often underlie variability in immune responses to pathogens. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes are emerging as critical determinants of both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection severity and long-term immunity, after either recovery or vaccination. A hallmark of coronavirus disease 2019 is its highly variable severity and breadth of immune responses between individuals. To address the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon, we analyzed the proteolytic processing of S1 spike glycoprotein precursor antigenic peptides across ten common allotypes of endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1), a polymorphic intracellular enzyme that can regulate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses by generating or destroying antigenic peptides. We utilized a systematic proteomic approach that allows the concurrent analysis of hundreds of trimming reactions in parallel, thus better emulating antigen processing in the cell. While all ERAP1 allotypes were capable of producing optimal ligands for major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, including known severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epitopes, they presented significant differences in peptide sequences produced, suggesting allotype-dependent sequence biases. Allotype 10, previously suggested to be enzymatically deficient, was rather found to be functionally distinct from other allotypes. Our findings suggest that common ERAP1 allotypes can be a major source of heterogeneity in antigen processing and through this mechanism contribute to variable immune responses in coronavirus disease 2019.

Immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen behind coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), play critical roles in disease pathophysiology (1Brodin P.

Appropriate innate and adaptive immune responses are necessary for viral clearance, whereas aberrant uncontrolled responses have a major impact on mortality (3Song P. Li W. Xie J. Hou Y. You C.

Furthermore, long-term immunity after infection or vaccination is of critical importance for ending the current pandemic (5Radbruch A. Chang H.-D. A long-term perspective on immunity to COVID.Nature. 2021; 595: 359-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although initial analyses focused on antibody-dependent immunity, T-cell–mediated immunity appears to be important for both viral clearance and long-term immunity, especially against emerging virus variants (6Leslie M.T.

How “killer” T cells could boost COVID immunity in face of new variants.Nature. 2021; 590: 374-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As a result, detailed knowledge of how SARS-CoV-2 epitopes are generated and selected is crucial for both allowing a better understanding of long-term antiviral immune responses by individuals and for the optimization of vaccines against virus variants (9Saini S.K. Hersby D.S. Tamhane T. Povlsen H.R. Amaya Hernandez S.P. Nielsen M. Gang A.O. Hadrup S.R.

As a result, several studies have focused in determining genetic predispositions to COVID-19 in an effort to establish better preventive and treatment measures (11Fricke-Galindo I. Falfán-Valencia R.

The major genetic risk factor for severe COVID-19 is inherited from Neanderthals.Nature. 2020; 587: 610-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Indeed, rare mutations in components of the innate immune response and in particular the interferon I pathway can predispose individuals to severe COVID-19 (13Zhang Q. Bastard P. Liu Z. Le Pen J.

In addition, the role of common polymorphic variation in components of adaptive immunity, such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, has been emerging as a major factor (15Shkurnikov M. Nersisyan S. Jankevic T. Galatenko A. Gordeev I. Vechorko V. Tonevitsky A. Association of HLA class I genotypes with severity of coronavirus disease-19.Front.

Genome. 2021; 8: 15Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). HLA molecules (also called major histocompatibility complex [MHC] molecules) bind small peptides generated intracellularly from antigenic proteins of pathogens and present them on the cell surface. The HLA class I–peptide complexes interact with specialized receptors on CD8+ T cells, and successful recognition indicates an infected cell and initiates a molecular response that leads to cell lysis (18Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Degradation of cell proteins and the generation of MHC class I-presented peptides.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 739-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Several enzymes play roles in generating peptide ligands for HLA molecules. Endoplamic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident aminopeptidase that trims precursors of antigenic peptides to optimize them for binding onto HLA (19Weimershaus M. Evnouchidou I. Saveanu L. van Endert P. Peptidases trimming MHC class I ligands.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2013; 25: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Appropriate of aberrant trimming of antigenic peptide precursors by ERAP1 can alter the repertoire of peptides available for presentation by HLA and indirectly regulate adaptive immune responses (20Hammer G.E. Kanaseki T. Shastri N. The final touches make perfect the peptide-MHC class I repertoire.Immunity. 2007; 26: 397-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, the generation of antigenic epitopes by ERAP1 can be critical for immune evasion by viruses (21Reeves E. Wood O. Ottensmeier C.H. King E.V. Thomas G.J. Elliott T. James E.

Human cytomegalovirus MicroRNA MiR-US4-1 inhibits CD8 + T cell responses by targeting the aminopeptidase ERAP1.Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12: 984-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). HLA molecules are highly polymorphic with thousands of different alleles discovered to date (23Robinson J. Barker D.J. Georgiou X. Cooper M.A. Flicek P. Marsh S.G.E. IPD-IMGT/HLA database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48: D948-D955PubMed Google Scholar). This polymorphic variation allows for the binding of a vast variety of peptide sequences, ensuring sufficient presentation of epitopes from unknown pathogens on a population level but not necessarily an individual level. Thus, HLA variability can underlie differences in immune responses between individuals. ERAP1 is also polymorphic, and coding SNPs in the ERAP1 gene associate with predisposition to autoimmunity or cancer often in epistasis with HLA alleles (24Kirino Y. Bertsias G. Ishigatsubo Y.

Generation and loading of antigenic peptides on HLA occur inside the ER, where thousands of different peptides compete with each other. While in vitro enzymatic analysis of ERAP1 function has provided significant insights on the mechanism of the enzyme (30Giastas P. Mpakali A. Papakyriakou A. Lelis A. Kokkala P. Neu M. Rowland P.

Immunol. 2011; 186: 1909-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To address these issues, we previously devised a proteomic approach to concurrently analyze hundreds of trimming reactions and compared the function of different antigen-processing enzymes (32Stamatakis G. Samiotaki M. Mpakali A. Panayotou G. Stratikos E. Generation of SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike glycoprotein putative antigenic epitopes in vitro by intracellular aminopeptidases.J. Proteome Res. 2020; 19: 4398-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Here, we applied this approach to analyze the relative effect of the ten most common ERAP1 allotypes (covering 99.9% of the European population) in processing antigenic peptide precursors derived from the S1 spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis suggests that ERAP1 allotypes carry significant sequence biases and generate sufficiently different peptide repertoires, which, in combination with HLA peptide binding specificity, can underlie differences in adaptive immune responses that contribute to COVID-19 disease severity variability in natural populations. To explore how different ERAP1 allotypes can process S1 spike glycoprotein and generate putative antigenic peptides, we utilized a library of 315 synthetic 15mers, spanning the sequence of the S1 spike glycoprotein, with 11-residue overlap between adjacent peptides. These 15mer peptides model possible antigenic peptide precursors that are generated in the cytosol and enter the ER, where they are further digested by ERAP1 to generate smaller products that bind and are presented by MHC class I. Thus, this mixture constitutes a useful tool for the systematic sampling of the entire sequence of the protein and has been used before to compare the activities of ERAP1 to other enzymes in the antigen processing pathway (32Stamatakis G. Samiotaki M. Mpakali A. Panayotou G. Stratikos E. Generation of SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike glycoprotein putative antigenic epitopes in vitro by intracellular aminopeptidases.J. Proteome Res. 2020; 19: 4398-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To digest the mixture, we used highly pure recombinant ERAP1 protein variants corresponding to naturally occurring allotypes. These allotypes are defined as combinations of nine SNPs in the ERAP1 gene as shown in Table 1 and constitute the most common allotypes in humans, covering 99.9% of European population and 94.1% of the global population (27Hutchinson J.P. Temponeras I. Kuiper J. Cortes A. Korczynska J. Kitchen S. Stratikos E. Common allotypes of ER aminopeptidase 1 have substrate-dependent and highly variable enzymatic properties.J. Biol.

After incubation, the digestion products were analyzed by LC–MS/MS using a custom search database generated by in silico digestions of the full S1 spike glycoprotein sequence (UniProt ID: P0DTC2). Three biological replicates for each reaction and three replicates of a negative control reaction were performed, totaling to 66 samples, and the identified peptides were filtered for robustness of detection as described in the Experimental procedures section. The unfiltered lists of identified peptides, along with relevant identification parameters, are shown separately for each reaction condition in Tables S1 and S2, respectively. To evaluate the relative progress of each digestion, we first compared the total peptide abundance present after each reaction (Fig. 1). We grouped the peptides into two categories: (i) 15mers that correspond to the undigested peptides (substrates) and (ii) 7 to 14mers that correspond to the products of the digestions. For both reaction conditions (low enzyme and high enzyme), 70 to 80% of peptide signal came from digestion products for most allotypes, with relatively small differences between most allotypes. About 20% of 15mers were still present after digestion for both reaction conditions, likely representing peptides that are resistant to ERAP1 trimming. Allotype 10 was slightly less efficient, with 54 to 62% of peptide signal originating from product peptides. Still, this difference is much less pronounced than observed in previous in vitro experiments using single peptides that suggested that allotype 10 can be as much as 60-fold less active for some peptides (27Hutchinson J.P. Temponeras I. Kuiper J. Cortes A. Korczynska J. Kitchen S. Stratikos E. Common allotypes of ER aminopeptidase 1 have substrate-dependent and highly variable enzymatic properties.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that although allotype 10 may be less active for some substrates, it is still able to operate with good efficiency in complex substrate mixtures. To gain insight on the specific differences between allotypes, we generated heatmap plots of all reactions and performed cluster analysis as described in the Experimental procedures section (Fig. 2). For both enzyme concentrations, the pool of 15mer peptides was digested significantly as demonstrated by the reduction of intensity of detected 15mers (Fig. 2, A and C). Some differences were, however, evident between ERAP1 allotypes. This was most evident for allotype 10, which spared clusters of peptides, possibly because of its lower enzymatic activity as demonstrated before (27Hutchinson J.P. Temponeras I. Kuiper J. Cortes A. Korczynska J. Kitchen S. Stratikos E. Common allotypes of ER aminopeptidase 1 have substrate-dependent and highly variable enzymatic properties.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Still, allotype 10 was able to efficiently trim large peptide clusters suggesting that its lower activity may be sequence specific. In terms of production of 7 to 14mers, there were again apparent differences in the patterns between allotypes (Fig. 2, B and D). At both enzyme concentrations, allotype 10 appeared not only to underproduce several peptides but also to overproduce some peptide clusters. Similar, although less pronounced, phenomena were also evident for other allotypes. In particular, allotypes 4, 6, 8, and 9 appear to be the most efficient in producing a variety of different peptide products and tend to group together in the cluster analysis. Overall, while all allotypes were able to digest the 15mer substrates, significant differences in patterns are evident suggesting some differences in sequence preferences between allotypes. Peptide length is one of the most important parameters for binding onto MHC class I molecules, and ERAP1 has been shown to show significant preferences for substrate length (30Giastas P. Mpakali A. Papakyriakou A. Lelis A. Kokkala P. Neu M. Rowland P. Liddle J. Georgiadis D. Stratikos E. Mechanism for antigenic peptide selection by endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2019; 116: 26709-26716Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 33Chang S.C. Momburg F. Bhutani N. Goldberg A.L. The ER aminopeptidase, ERAP1, trims precursors to lengths of MHC class I peptides by a “molecular ruler” mechanism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17107-17112Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Most of the known MHC class I ligands are in the range of 8 to 12 amino acids, and the majority are 9mers. We thus analyzed the length distribution of produced peptides from each ERAP1 allele and for each of the two reaction conditions (Fig. 3). For this and following comparisons, we restricted analysis only for peptides that were detected in replicate measurements to be statistically significant (p < 0.05) compared with the control reaction. For the low-enzyme condition, the distribution of the length of peptides produced by all allotypes formed two apparent “peaks” around 9 and 13 amino acids long, respectively (Fig. 3A). The peak around 13 amino acids long was much more pronounced suggesting that sequential digestion was still limited for most peptides. Under this condition, allotypes 5, 7, and 10 lagged behind in terms of producing 9mer products. The overall length distribution was reversed when a higher enzyme concentration was used (Fig. 3B). Overall, about double the number of peptides were identified when a higher amount of enzyme was used, consistent with faster sequential digestion of the 15mer substrates. In that condition, the majority of the produced peptides were 9mers for all allotypes, suggesting that all ERAP1 allotypes have the inherent capability to produce peptides with appropriate lengths for MHC class I binding. This is consistent with previous reports that have suggested that ERAP1 utilizes a “molecular ruler” mechanism that involves a regulatory allosteric binding site (30Giastas P. Mpakali A. Papakyriakou A. Lelis A. Kokkala P. Neu M. Rowland P. Liddle J. Georgiadis D. Stratikos E. Mechanism for antigenic peptide selection by endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2019; 116: 26709-26716Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 33Chang S.C. Momburg F. Bhutani N. Goldberg A.L. The ER aminopeptidase, ERAP1, trims precursors to lengths of MHC class I peptides by a “molecular ruler” mechanism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17107-17112Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Interestingly, allotypes 5 and 7 that appeared to lag behind in terms of generating 9mers were now just as effective as the remaining allotypes, suggesting that 9mers can accumulate efficiently for those allotypes, albeit more slowly. In contrast, allotype 10 was again an outlier and produced a lower number of 9mer peptides compared with all the other allotypes. A key parameter for antigenicity is the sequence of the presented peptides. In this context, it is important to know if the differences between generated peptides are just kinetic or also qualitative (i.e., sequence). To gain insight on whether different ERAP1 allotypes generate different peptide sequences, we calculated, for each peptide identified, the number of ERAP1 allotypes that were able to produce it (Fig. 4). About double the number of different peptides were produced by the high-enzyme condition, as expected form the enhanced sequential trimming of the 15mer substrates when more enzyme is present. The distribution was found to be U shaped, in contrast to the expected bell shaped if peptides were processed in a completely random manner by unrelated protease activities, suggesting specific commonalities and differences in sequence specificity between allotypes. For both reaction conditions, most peptides were produced by all allotypes, indicating that all allotypes have a core sequence preference that shapes the products of the digestion. Strikingly, the second most populous category were peptides that were uniquely produced only by a single allotype (Fig. 4, A and B). This finding suggests that ERAP1 allotypes may carry substrate biases that can influence the repertoire of produced peptides. The generation of allotype-unique peptides suggests that different allotypes can potentially drive different immune responses by generating unique antigenic peptides. To better understand the commonality of produced peptides for each allotype, we adapted the analysis shown in Figure 4 to report separately for each allotype (Fig. 5). For most allotypes and both reaction conditions, the distribution of produced peptides formed a trend toward common peptides, that is, most of the peptides produced by each allotype were also produced by several others. This was most clear for allotypes 6, 8, and 9. Several allotypes, however, namely allotypes 1 to 5, had a secondary peak around peptides that were either unique or produced by one to three allotypes in total. A striking outlier was, again, allotype 10. In particular, in the high-enzyme condition, it was the only allotype in that the uniqueness distribution was reversed, and many of the peptides produced were either unique to allotype 10 or produced by few others. This observation suggests that there could be some sequence bias between allotypes, with allotype 10 being the most extreme example. To further explore the similarities and differences between allotypes in a more unbiased manner, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig. 6). With a single exception (one replicate for allotype 9), all replicates clustered together validating the reproducibility of our analyses. For the trimming of the 15mer substrates when using the low-enzyme condition, all allotypes and biological replicates cluster together, away from the control reactions (Fig. 6A). At the high-enzyme condition however, allotype 10 diverged from the other allotypes (Fig. 6C). The PCA for the generation of 7 to 14mers revealed a greater distribution between allotypes. For the low-enzyme condition, allotypes 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 formed a cluster. Allotype 10 was a strong outlier, followed by 7 and allotypes 2 and 5. For the high-enzyme condition, allotype 10 was again an outlier, followed by 2, 5, 7 and allotype 3. Overall, PCA revealed that the main difference between allotypes lie on the peptides produced and that allotype 10 consistently appears to differentiate from other allotypes, although intermediate differentiation is observable for some of the other allotypes. The main biological phenomenon that drives cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses is not intracellular processing but rather antigen presentation by MHC class I molecules (HLA in humans). Which peptides are presented depends on the combination of their availability in the ER and their ability to bind onto the particular HLA alleles that are expressed in each individual. To evaluate the HLA-binding ability of produced peptides, we utilized a well-established binding prediction server, NetMHCpan-4.1 (34Reynisson B. A"

Past transcriptomic analyses of salivary gland tissue revealed the presence of two similar peptides (XC-42 and XC-43) having no extensive similarities to any other deposited sequences. Here we show that these peptides specifically inhibit coagulation of plasma and the amidolytic activity of α-thrombin. XC-43, the smaller of the two peptides, is a fast, tight-binding inhibitor of thrombin with a dissociation constant of less than 10 pM. XC-42 exhibits similar selectivity as well as kinetic and binding properties. The crystal structure of XC-43 in complex with thrombin shows that despite its substrate-like binding mode, XC-43 is not detectably cleaved by thrombin and that it interacts with the thrombin surface from the enzyme catalytic site through the fibrinogen-binding exosite I. The low rate of hydrolysis was verified in solution experiments with XC-43, which show the substrate to be largely intact after 2 h of incubation with thrombin at 37 °C. The low rate of XC-43 cleavage by thrombin may be attributable to specific changes in the catalytic triad observable in the crystal structure of the complex or to extensive interactions in the prime sites that may stabilize the binding of cleavage products. Based on the increased arterial occlusion time, tail bleeding time, and blood coagulation parameters in rat models of thrombosis XC-43 could be valuable as an anticoagulant.

Based on the increased arterial occlusion time, tail bleeding time, and blood coagulation parameters in rat models of thrombosis XC-43 could be valuable as an anticoagulant. Thrombin is a serine protease that plays a central role in hemostasis, catalyzing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, activating platelets through cleavage of protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) and potentiating its own production through activation of factors V, VIII, and XI (1Davie E.W. Kulman J.D. An overview of the structure and function of thrombin.Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 2006; 32 Suppl 1: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The thrombin catalytic site is composed of the triad His57, Asp102, and Ser195 lying at the bottom of a cleft formed by two extensions in the basic trypsin-like structure known as the 60 loop and the autolysis loop. The structure of this cleft limits the substrate specificity of thrombin to fibrinogen and those additional proteins involved with blood clotting and inflammation listed above. Thrombin also possesses two positively charged binding sites at other points on its surface, known as the fibrinogen-binding site (exosite I) and the heparin-binding site (exosite II). These provide additional points of interaction for the substrate that serve to orient it and enhance its binding affinity as well as providing an interaction site for charged glycans (2Bode W. The structure of thrombin: A janus-headed proteinase.Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 2006; 32 Suppl 1: 16-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring thrombin inhibitors have been isolated from numerous blood-feeding animals, which utilize the catalytic and exosites of thrombin in a variety of ways to attain very high binding affinities (3Koh C.Y.

One group of blood feeders, the fleas, belong to the insect order Siphonaptera, which contains over 2500 known species organized into 238 genera (10Bitam I. Dittmar K. Parola P. Whiting M.F. Raoult D. Fleas and flea-borne diseases.Int. J. Infect. Dis. 2010; 14: e667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). From the medical point of view, they are relevant for both human and veterinary health, acting as vectors for several pathogens including Bartonella sp., Rickettsia sp., and Yersinia pestis, the etiological agent of bubonic plague (11Eisen R.J. Gage K.L. Transmission of flea-borne zoonotic agents.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2012; 57: 61-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Despite their importance, few flea salivary proteins have been functionally characterized, although many novel sequences have been identified in the previously published salivary transcriptomes of the rat flea Xenopsylla cheopis (12Andersen J.F. Hinnebusch B.J. Lucas D.A. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Pham V.M. Ribeiro J.M. An insight into the sialome of the oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis (Rots).BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 102Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and the cat flea Ctenocephalides felis (9Ribeiro J.M.

An insight into the sialotranscriptome of the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis.PLoS One. 2012; 7e44612Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this study we investigate the activity of two similar, highly expressed peptides given the names XC-42 (ABM55431.1) and XC-43 (ABM55432.1) that have no obviously conserved domains or overall similarities with other peptides of known function (12Andersen J.F. Hinnebusch B.J. Lucas D.A. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Pham V.M. Ribeiro J.M. An insight into the sialome of the oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis (Rots).BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 102Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We show these peptides to be present in the flea salivary gland, to tightly bind thrombin and to inhibit its proteolytic activity. We have determined the crystal structure of the XC-43-thrombin complex obtained at a resolution of 2.15 Å, and it reveals a substrate-like binding mode for the peptide but an unexpected absence of proteolytic cleavage. As suggested by the presence of a short sequence motif reminiscent of those found in a number of thrombin exosite I-binding peptides, XC-43 also interacts intimately with the fibrinogen-binding exosite. Finally, using an animal model we show that XC-43 inhibits blood coagulation pathways in vitro and in vivo. The study describes a novel peptide of nearly minimal size for function in an active site/exosite I-binding mechanism that is also resistant to cleavage by the protease. This combination of features results in very high-affinity binding and a high degree of selectivity for thrombin using standard L-amino acids without any apparent posttranslational modification of the peptide. The salivary gland transcriptome, or sialome, of the rat flea X. cheopis (12Andersen J.F. Hinnebusch B.J. Lucas D.A. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Pham V.M. Ribeiro J.M. An insight into the sialome of the oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis (Rots).BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 102Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) contained two similar peptides (78% of identity), given the names XC-42 (ABM55431.1) and XC-43 (ABM55432.1), with no known conserved domains or overall similarities to other deposited proteins. The two peptides are nearly identical in sequence, but in XC-42 a duplication and insertion result in the peptide being 14 amino acids longer than XC-43. When aligned with thrombin inhibitors isolated from other blood feeding animals, including variegin and avathrin from ticks, as well as hirudin from the medicinal leech Hirudo medicinalis, we observed the presence of a conserved motif E-x-I-P-x(0,1)-[ED]-x-[L] (in “PROSITE” notation, 0,1 indicates that x represents 0 or 1 residue) (13Sigrist C.J. Cerutti L. Hulo N. Gattiker A. Falquet L. Pagni M. Bairoch A. Bucher P. PROSITE: A documented database using patterns and profiles as motif descriptors.Brief Bioinform. 2002; 3: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) near the C-terminus of the peptide (Fig. 1). In naturally occurring thrombin inhibitory peptides, this motif is associated with binding to the anionic fibrinogen-binding exosite (exosite I), suggesting that XC-42 and XC-43 may inhibit thrombin. Also, located 13 residues N-terminal to the putative exosite-I-binding motif is the dipeptide Pro 10-Lys 11, which could serve as a P2-P1 sequence interacting with the catalytic site region. The putative exosite I-binding region, catalytic site-binding region, and the length of the spacer region between them are very similar to the tick peptides variegin and avathrin and suggested strongly that the flea peptides are also catalytic site/exosite-I binding inhibitors of thrombin (Fig. 1). Both XC-42 and XC-43 possess a putative signal peptide predicted to be cleaved between residues 23 and 24, rendering mature peptides of 5.38 kDa and pI of 3.95 for XC-42 and 3.86 kDa and pI of 4.31 for XC-43. Mass spectral analysis of X. cheopis salivary gland homogenates (SGH) shows the presence of unique fragment peptides derived from both molecules (Fig. S1 and Table S1), confirming that XC-42 and XC-43 are present in the gland. Unmodified peptides covering nearly the entire sequence were identified, suggesting that posttranslational modifications affecting inhibitory activity (14Thompson R.E. Liu X. Ripoll-Rozada J. Alonso-Garcia N. Parker B.L. Pereira P.J.B. Payne R.J. Tyrosine sulfation modulates activity of tick-derived thrombin inhibitors.Nat. Chem. 2017; 9: 909-917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may not be present. X. cheopis SGH was tested for its ability to inhibit serine proteases involved in hemostasis and inflammation using small peptidomimetic substrates. The panel included proteases from the coagulation cascade, as well as the fibrinolytic and inflammatory pathways. Of this group, only thrombin was significantly inhibited (Fig. 2A). SGH also produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of hydrolysis of the chromogenic thrombin substrate S-2238 (Fig. 2B) and inhibited thrombin-mediated activation of PAR-1 in washed platelet preparations (Fig. 2C), strongly suggesting that the extract contains a specific thrombin inhibitor. We found that synthetic XC-42 and XC-43 both inhibit cleavage of S-2238 by purified α-thrombin in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). Additionally, we found that when the same panel of proteases tested with SGH was tested against XC-42 and XC-43, only thrombin was significantly inhibited (Fig. 2E) and that XC-43 potently inhibited thrombin-mediated activation of PAR-1 in washed platelets (Fig. 2F). Together these data indicate that XC-42 and XC-43 are largely responsible for the inhibition of thrombin seen with crude SGH, suggesting that they may be the primary inhibitors of the coagulation cascade utilized during blood feeding by X. cheopis. Progress curves observed after initiation of the proteolytic reaction by addition of thrombin to a mixture containing increasing concentrations of XC-43 show the peptide to be a fast-binding inhibitor (Fig. 3A). The substrate (S-2238) concentration dependence of inhibition was consistent with a competitive mechanism exhibiting an inhibitory constant (Ki) of 7.7 × 10−12 M (Fig. 3, B and C). The Ki for inhibition of thrombin by XC-42 calculated from the data presented in Figure 2D was 18 × 10−12 M indicating that the two peptides inhibit thrombin with similar potency. Moreover, measurement of thrombin binding to a biotinylated XC-43-bound plasmon resonance surface (SPR) produced a dissociation constant (KD) of 3.0 × 10−12 M with an association rate constant (ka) of 4.0 × 107 M−1s−1 and a dissociation rate constant (kd) of 1.2 × 10−4 s−1 (Fig. 3D). Notably, SPR assays in which XC-42 and XC-43 were passed over a surface of immobilized thrombin exhibited elevated dissociation constants, indicating possible steric hindrance of inhibitor interaction, as has been seen for the catalytic site/exosite-I-binding inhibitor anophelin (15Figueiredo A.C. de Sanctis D. Gutierrez-Gallego R. Cereija T.B. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Fuentes-Prior P. Pereira P.J. Unique thrombin inhibition mechanism by anophelin, an anticoagulant from the malaria vector.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: E3649-E3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, XC-42 and XC-43 produced very similar values for both the kinetic parameters and the dissociation constant, further indicating that the two inhibitors bind thrombin in a similar manner (Fig. S2). The tight binding of XC-43 with thrombin was also affirmed using ITC as being enthalpy-driven (ΔH = −29.5 ± 0.3 kcal/mol) (Fig. S3). Since XC-42 and XC-43 act as competitive thrombin inhibitors, they may be susceptible to thrombin-mediated proteolysis as has been demonstrated for other substrate-like inhibitors (16Koh C.Y.

When both inhibitors were incubated with thrombin for 2 h at 37 °C at a molar ratio of 25:1 (inhibitor:thrombin) and analyzed by mass spectrometry, major ions corresponding to the intact inhibitors, 5379 Da for XC-42 and 3862 Da for XC-43, were observed, and much smaller peaks corresponding in mass to the longer cleavage fragment Leu12–Ala36 (numbering refers to XC-43, 2886 Da) (Fig. 3, E–H) were also present, indicating that the majority of the peptide was uncleaved. XC-43 appeared especially resistant to cleavage, with the fragment ion intensity being less than 15 percent of that of the uncleaved peptide. The three-dimensional structure of human α-thrombin complexed with XC-43 was determined by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 2.15 Å using molecular replacement methods with a thrombin search model (Table 1). The crystal belonged to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with an asymmetric unit containing six thrombin-XC-43 complexes. All six complexes have a similar overall structure (r.m.s.d. = 0.153 ± 0.0085 Å over 260 Cα positions) with high-quality electron density covering the peptide spanning from XC-43 residues XGlu 6 (X superscript indicates XC-43 while T superscript indicates thrombin) to XAsn 35 (Figs. 4A, S4 and S5). XC-43 binding buries an interface measuring 1710.5 Å2 (48% of the inhibitor surface area) and as suggested by the alignment described in Figure 1, binds with contact points at the protease active site and at exosite I (Fig. 4A). Moreover, binding of XC-43 does not cause major rearrangements in the thrombin backbone structure when the complex is compared with the structure of free thrombin (PDB 3U69 r.m.s.d. = 0.921 Å over 257 Cα positions (20Figueiredo A.C.

Also present is a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of TAla 190 and NZ of XLys 11. Though the peptide shows a substrate-like binding conformation, no evidence of peptide bond cleavage is apparent (Fig. 4B). Because of this, the structure provides an unusually complete view of the interactions of a substrate-like molecule at subsites covering the active site region. The backbone atoms of XLys 11 are very similarly placed to those of other inhibitors such as avathrin and hirulog-1, although its carbonyl carbon is 0.5 to 0.9 Å further from Cα of TSer 195 than in these two inhibitors, suggesting that the scissile bond is positioned similarly in these complexes. The side chain of XLeu 12 (P1ʹ) is situated in the pocket (S1ʹ) bounded by THis 57, TTrp 60D, TLys 60F, TLeu 41, and the TCys 42-Cys59 disulfide bond with the side chain of Lys 60F being pushed toward TPhe 60H by the bulky hydrophobic side chain of XLeu 12. This positions a water molecule (TWat 693) in the vicinity of the P1-P1ʹ peptide bond where it forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain hydroxyl of TSer 195 (Fig. S6). The serine side chain is rotated approximately 180° relative to its position in most other thrombin/inhibitor complex structures and its hydroxyl group continues to lie within hydrogen bonding distance of NE2 in THis 57 and also forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen atom of XLys 11 of the inhibitor (3.07 Å, Fig. 4C). The repositioned TSer 195 hydroxyl lies 3.6 Å away from the carbonyl carbon of XLys 11, rather than the 2.65 to 2.75 Å for the lysine or arginine P1 residues in complexes with hirulog-1 (PDB 1HGT), the substrate-like inhibitor avathrin, or an uncleavable fibrinogen substrate mimetic (PDB 1IHS) (19Iyer J.K.

Interference with nucleophilic attack of TSer 195 on the P1 carbonyl carbon by water hydrogen bonded with TSer 195 and the suboptimal distance between the serine hydroxyl and the carbonyl carbon of XLys 11 may help to explain the lack of hydrolysis of XC-43 by thrombin while other substrate-like inhibitors such as variegin (PDB 3B23), avathrin, and hirulog-1 are readily cleaved (19Iyer J.K.

C-terminal to XLys 11, the path of the peptide continues along the thrombin surface toward exosite I. As discussed above, XLeu 12 (P1ʹ) occupies the S1ʹ pocket bounded by TLys 60F, TTrp 60D, THis 57 and TCys 42. In this position, it is superimposable with the side chain VHis 12, the P2ʹ residue of variegin as modeled by Koh et al. (PDB 3B23, (23Koh C.Y. Kumar S. Kazimirova M. Nuttall P.A. Radhakrishnan U.P.

The P2ʹ residue of XC-43, XTyr 13, is inserted into the S2ʹ pocket at the base of the autolysis loop where its phenolic hydroxyl is hydrogen bonded with TAsn 143. Its side chain is also covered by the peptide main chain in the vicinity of XGlu 17 resulting in apparent exclusion from bulk solvent. XGln 14 interacts via a stacking arrangement with the side chain of TTrp 60D, which is contained in a pocket formed by XGln 9 and XGln 14 from the inhibitor and TTyr 60A from thrombin (Fig. 4D). The carbonyl oxygen of XGln 14 also forms a hydrogen bond with the amide nitrogen of TAsp 223 of an adjacent thrombin molecule. The main chain of the inhibitor forms a turn in this area and loses contact with the thrombin surface until XGlu 17, whose carbonyl oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of TGln 151. Notably, the side chain of XArg 15 interacts electrostatically with the side chain of TGlu 146 of an adjacent thrombin molecule. The side chain of XGlu 17 also makes extensive contact with the aromatic ring of XTyr 13, packing it against the thrombin surface, while the carbonyl oxygen from XGly 18 forms a hydrogen bond with the amide nitrogen of thrombin TLeu 40, the carbonyl of XAsn 20 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of TArg 73 and the backbone amide of XGlu 23 hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl of TThr 74 as the chain continues to the area of exosite I (Fig. 4E). At exosite I, XC-43 traverses the contact surface described for the structure of thrombin complexed with the central E region of fibrinogen (24Pechik I. Yakovlev S. Mosesson M.W. Gilliland G.L. Medved L. Structural basis for sequential cleavage of fibrinopeptides upon fibrin assembly.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3588-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The peptide structure in this region is quite similar to that of other inhibitor complexes including those of hirudin and avathrin, which have similar α-helical structures at their C-termini, but specific side chain interactions are not highly conserved. Exosite binding is mediated largely by nonelectrostatic interactions involving hydrophobic residues including XIle 25, XVal 29, and XLeu 30. Additionally, the amide nitrogen of XIle 25 is hydrogen bonded to the side chain of TGln 38 of thrombin (Fig. 4F). Since XC-43 is a specific thrombin inhibitor, we evaluated its anticoagulant activity in vitro and in vivo. Addition of XC-43 to human plasma increased the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) by 2.3- and 3.5-fold, respectively, at a concentration of 0.4 μM and prolonged the thrombin time (TT) more than tenfold at a concentration of 0.2 μM (Table 2). Using rat models of thrombosis, we observed that XC-43 can interfere with coagulation in vivo. Intraperitoneal injection of XC-43 (0.5 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg) resulted in a reduction of calcium thromboplastin-induced thrombus weight by 58.2% and 83% respectively, in comparison to the PBS-injected group (Fig. 5A). Notably, XC-43 (1 mg/kg) was able to reduce thrombus weight by 57.3% in relation to animal treated with heparin (50 μg/kg) (Fig. 5A). The effect of XC-43 on coagulation was also evaluated using a tail bleeding assay, in which intraperitoneal injection of XC-43 (0.5 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg) resulted in an increased bleeding by 3.2 and 7.6-fold, respectively, when compared with PBS-injected animals, and 2.3-fold (XC-43, 1 mg/kg) when compared with heparin-treated animals (Fig. 5B). The aPTT was evaluated ex vivo at 0, 2, 12, and 24 h posttreatment. Animals treated with XC-43 (0.5 mg/kg) presented similar results as animals treated with heparin (50 μg/kg), in which an increase of twofold was observed at 2 and 12 h in relation to PBS-treated animals, while a threefold increase was found in animals treated with higher concentration of XC-43 (1 mg/kg) (Fig. 5C). No differences between treated and control groups were observed at 0 and 24 h.Table 2In vitro effect of XC-43 on coagulationXC-43 (μM)PTaPTTTT013.6 s34.3 s34.4 s0.221 s98.4 s>300 s0.431.1 s121.4 s>300 s0.8>300 s>300 s>300 s Open table in a new tab Anticoagulants from blood-feeding animals generally target either factor Xa or thrombin, reflecting the importance of these enzymes in both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of coagulation.

Across the Canadian Prairies, including Alberta, the length and severity of winter vary among geographic locations. This study investigates the seasonal pattern of Nosema abundance in two Alberta locations using indoor and outdoor wintering methods and its impact on bee population, survival, and commercial viability. This study found that N. ceranae had a distinct seasonal pattern in Alberta, with high spore abundance in spring, declining to low levels in the summer and fall. The results showed that fall Nosema monitoring might not be the best indicator of treatment needs or future colony health outcomes. There was no clear pattern for differences in N. ceranae abundance by location or wintering method. However, wintering method affected survival with colonies wintered indoors having lower mortality and more rapid spring population build-up than outdoor-wintered colonies. The results suggest that the existing Nosema threshold should be reinvestigated with wintering method in mind to provide more favorable outcomes for beekeepers. Average Nosema abundance in the spring was a significant predictor of end-of-study winter colony mortality, highlighting the importance of spring Nosema monitoring and treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3208219715,"Protein arginine methylation is a posttranslational modification catalyzed by the protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) enzyme family. Dysregulated protein arginine methylation is linked to cancer and a variety of other human diseases. PRMT1 is the predominant PRMT isoform in mammalian cells and acts in pathways regulating transcription, DNA repair, apoptosis, and cell proliferation. PRMT1 dimer formation, which is required for methyltransferase activity, is mediated by interactions between a structure called the dimerization arm on one monomer and a surface of the Rossman Fold of the other monomer. Given the link between PRMT1 dysregulation and disease and the link between PRMT1 dimerization and activity, we searched the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database to identify potential inactivating mutations occurring in the PRMT1 dimerization arm. We identified three mutations that correspond to W215L, Y220N, and M224V substitutions in human PRMT1V2 (isoform 1) (W197L, Y202N, M206V in rat PRMT1V1). Using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, analytical ultracentrifugation, native PAGE, and activity assays, we found that these conservative substitutions surprisingly disrupt oligomer formation and substantially impair both S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) binding and methyltransferase activity. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that these substitutions introduce novel interactions within the dimerization arm that lock it in a conformation not conducive to dimer formation. These findings provide a clear, if putative, rationale for the contribution of these mutations to impaired arginine methylation in cells and corresponding health consequences."

Understanding multiphase flows near the wellbore is an alternative to improve production efficiency. Therefore, this study conducts a series of numerical experiments based on the full set of the Navier-Stokes equations in 3D to simulate multiphase flows in porous media for heavy oil production horizontal wells. The solution given by this advanced mathematical formulation led to the description of the movement of the fluids near the wellbore with unprecedented detail. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on different rock and fluid properties such as permeability and oil viscosity, assuming homogeneous porous media. The influence of these parameters on the prediction of the breakthrough time, aquifer movement, and the severity of water production was noticed. Finally, the numerical model was verified against field data using two approaches. The first one was conducting a history match assuming homogeneous rock properties. In contrast, the second one used heterogeneous rock properties measured from well logging, achieving a lower deviation than field data, about 20%. The homogeneous numerical experiments showed that the breakthrough occurs at the heel with a subsequent crestation along the horizontal well. Moreover, at adverse mobility ratios, excessive water production tends to happen in water connings at the heel with an inflow area less than 1% of the total inflow area of the completion liner. Different aquifer movement dynamics were found for the heterogeneous case, like the breakthrough through multiple locations along the horizontal well. Finally, critical hydraulic data in the well, such as the pressure and velocity profiles, were obtained, which could be used to improve production efficiency. The numerical model presented in this study is proposed as an alternative to conducting subsurface modeling and well designs."

A precise and accurate detection of the diseases and pests could facilitate timely treatment and management of the diseases and pests and lessen the resultant loss in economy and health. Herein, we propose an improved design of the disease detection system for plant images. Methods Built upon the two-stage framework of object detection neural networks such as Mask R-CNN, the proposed network involves three types of extensions, including the addition of additional level of feature pyramids to improve the exploration and proposal of candidate regions, the aggregation of feature maps from all levels of feature pyramids per candidate region to fully exploit the information from feature pyramids, and the introduction of a squeeze-and-excitation block to the construction of feature pyramids and the aggregated feature maps to improve the representation of feature maps. Results The proposed network was evaluated using 74 images of infected apple fruits. In 3-fold cross-validation, the proposed network achieved averaged precision (AP) of 72.26, AP at 0.5 threshold of 88.51 and AP at 0.75 threshold of 82.30. In the comparative experiments, the proposed network outperformed the other competing networks. The utility of the three extensions was also demonstrated in comparison to Mask R-CNN. Conclusions The experimental results suggest that the proposed network could identify and localize the symptom of the disease with high accuracy, leading to an early diagnosis and treatment of the disease, and thus holding the potential for improving crop yield and quality."
https://openalex.org/W3209932728,"Early diagnosis and treatment are one of the key strategies of tuberculosis control globally, and there are strong efforts in detecting and treating tuberculosis cases in Ethiopia. Smear microscopy examination has been a routine diagnostic test for pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosis in resource-constrained settings for decades. Recently, many countries, including Ethiopia, are scaling up the use of Gene Xpert without the evaluation of the cost and cost-effectiveness implications of this strategy. Therefore, this study evaluated the cost and cost-effectiveness of Gene Xpert (MTB/RIF) and smear microscopy tests to diagnosis tuberculosis patients in Ethiopia.We compared the costs and cost-effectiveness of tuberculosis diagnosis using smear microscopy and Gene Xpert among 1332 patients per intervention in the Arsi zone. We applied combinations of top-down and bottom-up costing approaches. The costs were estimated from the health providers' perspective within one year (2017-2018). We employed ""cases detected"" as an effectiveness measure, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated by dividing the changes in cost and change in effectiveness. All costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were reported in 2018 US$.The unit cost per test for Gene Xpert was $12.9 whereas it is $3.1 for AFB smear microscopy testing. The cost per TB case detected was $77.9 for Gene Xpert while it was $55.8 for the smear microscopy method. The cartridge kit cost accounted for 42% of the overall Gene Xpert's costs and the cost of the reagents and consumables accounted for 41.3% ($1.3) of the unit cost for the smear microscopy method. The ICER for the Gene Xpert strategy was $20.0 per tuberculosis case detected.Using Gene Xpert as a routine test instead of standard care (smear microscopy) can be potentially cost-effective. In the cost scenario analysis, the price of the cartridge, the number of tests performed per day, and the life span of the capital equipment were the drivers of the unit cost of the Gene Xpert method. Therefore, Gene Xpert can be a part of the routine TB diagnostic testing strategy in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W3210846933,"Digital health has become a widely recognized approach to addressing a range of health needs, including advancing universal health coverage and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. At present there is limited evidence on the impact of digital interventions on health outcomes. A growing body of peer-reviewed evidence on digitalizing last-mile electronic logistics management information systems (LMIS) presents an opportunity to estimate health impact.The impact of LMIS on reductions in stockouts was estimated from primary data and peer-reviewed literature, with three scenarios of impact: 5% stockout reduction (conservative), 10% stockout reduction (base), and 15% stockout reduction (optimistic). Stockout reduction data was inverted to stock availability and improved coverage for vaccines and essential medicines using a 1:1 conversion factor. The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) model was used to estimate health impact from lives saved in newborns and children in Mozambique, Tanzania, and Ethiopia between 2022 and 2026 across the three scenarios.Improving coverage of vaccines with a digital LMIS intervention in the base scenario (conservative, optimistic) could prevent 4,924 (2,578-6,094), 3,998 (1,621-4,915), and 17,648 (12,656-22,776) deaths in Mozambique, Tanzania, and Ethiopia, respectively over the forecast timeframe. In addition, scaling up coverage of non-vaccine medications could prevent 17,044 (8,561-25,392), 21,772 (10,976-32,401), and 34,981 (17,543-52,194) deaths in Mozambique, Tanzania, and Ethiopia, respectively. In the base model scenario, the maximum percent reduction in deaths across all geographies was 1.6% for vaccines and 4.1% for non-vaccine medications.This study projects that digitalization of last-mile LMIS would reduce child mortality by improving coverage of lifesaving health commodities. This analysis helps to build the evidence base around the benefits of deploying digital solutions to address health challenges. Findings should be interpreted carefully as stockout reduction estimates are derived from a small number of studies."

Here, we report that the TBR sequence is not as homogenous as previously believed. BLAST analysis of the available T. brucei genomes reveals various TBR sequences of 177 bp and 176 bp in length, which can be sorted into two TBR groups based on a few key single nucleotide polymorphisms. Conventional and quantitative PCR with primers matched to consensus sequences that target either TBR group show substantial copy-number variations in the TBR repertoire within a collection of 77 Trypanozoon strains. We developed the qTBR, a novel PCR consisting of three primers and two probes, to simultaneously amplify target sequences from each of the two TBR groups into one single qPCR reaction. This dual probe setup offers increased analytical sensitivity for the molecular detection of all Trypanozoon taxa, in particular for T.b. gambiense and T. evansi, when compared to existing TBR PCRs. By combining the qTBR with 18S rDNA amplification as an internal standard, the relative copy-number of each TBR target sequence can be calculated and plotted, allowing for further classification of strains into TBR genotypes associated with East, West or Central Africa. Thus, the qTBR takes advantage of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variations in the TBR sequences to enhance amplification and genotyping of all Trypanozoon strains, making it a promising tool for prevalence studies of African trypanosomiasis in both humans and animals."
https://openalex.org/W3208871770,"Inactivation or mutation of the tumour suppressor gene p53 or its regulator mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) is the commonest event in breast cancer. These altered genes usually express abnormally high levels of their proteins in many carcinomas. The phenotypic expression of p53 and MDM2 in breast cancer cases in our setting is not known. This study investigated the expression of the tumour suppressor protein p53 and its regulator MDM2, using immunohistochemistry in a Ghana breast cancer cohort.A 9-year retrospective cross-sectional study on archived tissue blocks-formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) was carried out. Demographic data were abstracted. Based on complete clinical data and availability of FFPE archived blocks 203 cases were selected for tissue micro array (TMA) construction. The TMA sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC) (ER, PR, HER2, p53, and MDM2). Expression of p53 and MDM2 were related to grade and molecular subtypes.The age ranged from 17 to 92 years (mean = 49.34 ± 13.74). Most of the cases were high grade; grade II (34.9%) and grade III (55.7%). Fifty-four percent of the cases were triple negative. Invasive ductal carcinoma no special type was the commonest histotype (87.1%). Thirty-six percent (36%) of the cases expressed p53. Significant associations were found between p53 overexpression and histological grade (p = 0.034), triple negative (p = 0.0333) and luminal B (p<0.01) tumors. Most cases (93.1%) were negative for MDM2 expression. Significant association was found between MDM2 and HER2 over-expression as well as Ki-67. There was no significant positive correlation between MDM2 and p53 co-expression (p>0.05).The elevated level of p53 expression in the aggressive breast cancer phenotypes (high histological grade and triple negative) in our cohort suggest that P53 elevation may be a poor prognostic marker in our setting. High expression of MDM2 in our cohort with high Ki67; also in cases with Her2/neu overexpression known with predictable poor prognosis in the absence of target therapy suggest MDM2 may be associated with aggressive biological behaviour in our breast cancer cases. The non-significant association of p53 and MDM2 expression in the same cases as also documented by previous studies suggest independent genetic pathway in tumourigenesis."

In vivo, efficacy of BTT-105 evaluated from three kinds of NAFLD models (methionine/choline deficient diet (MCD), high fat diet (HF) and western diet (WD)). Metabolomics and transcriptomics profiling analysis in liver tissues were conducted. In vitro, anti-fibrotic effect of BTT-105 assessed in human hepatic stellated cells (HSCs) and primary mouse HSCs. BTT-105 improved NAFLD activity score in three kinds of NAFLD animal models (MCD, HF, and WD). BTT-105 also decreased levels of hepatic pro-collagen and collagen fibers deposition in liver tissue. Metabolome and transcriptome analysis revealed that BTT-105 decreased lipid metabolites and increased antioxidants in NAFLD mice. In HepG2 cells, BTT-105 enhanced Nrf2-ARE reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner and increased the levels of antioxidant gene expression. BTT-105 showed inhibition of HSCs activation and migration.

https://openalex.org/W3210900463,"Biofilm infections are hard to manage using conventional antibiotic treatment regimens because biofilm structures discourage antibiotics from reaching the entire bacterial community and allow pathogen cells to persistently colonize and develop a plethora of tolerance mechanisms towards antibiotics. Moreover, the dispersed cells from biofilms can cause further complications by colonizing different sites and establishing new cycles of biofilms. Previously, we showed that alginate lyase enzyme (AlyP1400), purified from a marine Pseudoalteromonas bacterium, reduced Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm biomass and boosted bactericidal activity of tobramycin by degrading alginate within the biofilm extracellular polymeric substances matrix. In this work, we used a flow cytometry-based assay to analyze collected dispersal cells and demonstrated the synergy between tobramycin with AlyP1400 in enhancing the release of both live and dead biofilm cells from a mucoid P. aeruginosa strain CF27, which is a clinical isolate from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Interestingly, this enhanced dispersal was only observed when AlyP1400 was combined with tobramycin and administered simultaneously but not when AlyP1400 was added in advance of tobramycin in a sequential manner. Moreover, neither the combined nor sequential treatment altered the dispersal of the biofilms from a non-mucoid P. aeruginosa laboratory strain PAK. We then carried out the gene expression and tobramycin survival analyses to further characterize the impacts of the combined treatment on the CF27 dispersal cells. Gene expression analysis indicated that CF27 dispersal cells had increased expression in virulence- and antibiotic resistance-related genes, including algR, bdlA, lasB, mexF, mexY, and ndvB. In the CF27 dispersal cell population, the combinational treatment of AlyP1400 with tobramycin further induced bdlA, mexF, mexY, and ndvB genes more than non-treated and tobramycin-treated dispersal cells, suggesting an exacerbated bacterial stress response to the combinational treatment. Simultaneous to the gene expression analysis, the survival ability of the same batch of biofilm dispersal cells to a subsequent tobramycin challenge displayed a significantly higher tobramycin tolerant fraction of cells (~60%) upon the combinational treatment of AlyP1400 and tobramycin than non-treated and tobramycin-treated dispersal cells, as well as the planktonic cells (all below 10%).

https://openalex.org/W3210903797,"The discovery of extremophiles helped enable the development of groundbreaking technology such as PCR. Temperature variation is often an essential step of these technology platforms, but the effect of temperature on the error rate of polymerases from different origins is underexplored. Here, we applied high-throughput sequencing to profile the error rates of DNA polymerases from psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic origins with single-molecule resolution. We found that the reaction temperature substantially increases substitution and deletion error rates of psychrophilic and mesophilic DNA polymerases. Our motif analysis shows that the substitution error profiles cluster according to phylogenetic similarity of polymerases, not the reaction temperature, thus suggesting that the reaction temperature increases the global error rate of polymerases independent of the sequence context. Intriguingly, we also found that the DNA polymerase I of psychrophilic bacteria exhibits higher polymerization activity than its mesophilic ortholog across all temperature ranges, including down to −19 °C, which is well below the freezing temperature of water. Our results provide a useful reference for how the reaction temperature, a crucial parameter of biochemistry, can affect DNA polymerase fidelity in organisms adapted to a wide range of thermal environments.

Micro-organisms that live in cold environment are confronted with the thermodynamic challenge of maintaining the chemical processes of life; however, the abundance of various life-forms found in near or below freezing temperatures suggests that biology has evolved ways to overcome such obstacles. Contrary to what one would expect from naïve application of the Arrhenius equation, micro-organisms in cold environments do not grow exponentially slower in the cold than their mesophilic cousins at room temperature (1Ratkowsky D.A.

Distinguished by.Bacteriolody Rev. 1934; 23: 97-108Crossref Google Scholar). This suggests that psychrophilic enzymes have evolved to catalyze relevant activities at low temperature (3Svingor Á.

Low-temperature adaptation is thought to have increased the catalytic rate of enzymes by increasing local flexibility of their active sites, thus lowering activation energy barriers (6Lonhienne T.

This can be contrasted with high-temperature adaptation, which confers structural robustness to thermal denaturation by increasing intramolecular interactions that maintain an enzyme's functional tertiary shape. Studies based on directed evolution have shown that structural stability and enzymatic efficiency can be optimized simultaneously and are thought to be mutually compatible properties (10Miyazaki K. Wintrode P.L. Grayling R.A. Rubingh D.N. Arnold F.H. Directed evolution study of temperature adaptation in a psychrophilic enzyme.J. Mol.

Combining these observations helps explain the general biochemical trend of cold-adapted enzymes: an increase in enzyme’s catalytic activity is often associated with a reduced binding affinity and a broader substrate specificity (12Tsigos I.

However, a direct test of these ideas on orthologous enzymes from organisms adapted to low, medium, and high temperatures has yet been performed. As DNA polymerase is a central component of cellular replication and biotechnological platforms (14Loeb L.A. Monnat R.J. DNA polymerases and human disease.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), understanding how the reaction temperature can affect fidelity is vital. The polymerase error rate is tightly controlled to ensure the successful duplication of genetic material. Replication error from DNA polymerase is a source of genetic variations and underlies the cause of many diseases (15Sierra H. Cordova M. Chen C.S.J. Rajadhyaksha M.

Polymerase can introduce errors at an exponential rate, significantly impairing downstream interpretation. In high-throughput sequencing, polymerase replication errors can reduce base calling accuracy and precision (22Schmitt M.W. Kennedy S.R. Salk J.J. Fox E.J. Hiatt J.B. Loeb L.A.

The increasing applications of nucleic acid amplification underscore a need to better understand the degree to which physical parameters, such as the temperature, affects polymerase fidelity. This study set out to provide a reference for how the temperature affects the activity and error profiles of DNA polymerases of psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic origins (Fig. 1A). Previous studies reported psychrophilic DNA polymerases' activity at ambient temperatures (25Schleper C. Swanson R.V. Mathur E.J. Delong E.F. Characterization of a DNA polymerase from the uncultivated psychrophilic archaeon Cenarchaeum symbiosum.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7803-7811Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 26Piotrowski Y. Gurung M.K. Larsen A.N.

Cell Biol. 2019; 20: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar); however, the behavior of these polymerases across a wide range of reaction temperatures remains unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that DNA polymerase I from psychrophilic bacteria, Psychromonas ingrahamii, retains DNA replication activity below water's freezing temperature. We used random nucleotides to multiplex single-molecule measurement of insertion, deletion, and substitution events for DNA polymerases from different origins across a range of temperature conditions. This enabled a comprehensive mapping of DNA polymerase error profiles as a function of the reaction temperature, revealing an unexpected relationship between fidelity and temperature adaptation. Our report provides an important reference to inform design choices for future biotechnological applications of DNA polymerase. To address whether there is an activity and fidelity trade-off in DNA polymerase, we wanted to measure and compare the temperature dependence of its activity from a wide range of microbial sources. As psychrophilic DNA polymerase is unavailable commercially, we set out to recombinantly purify one for our study. Based on homology search, we identified a gene encoding DNA polymerase I (Psychromonas ingrahamii DNA polymerase I [PIPI]; IMG Gene ID: 639798289), a family A polymerase, from P. ingrahamii, gram-negative bacteria that can grow and replicate at −12 °C in laboratory condition (27Breezee J.

Maltose-binding protein (MBP)-PIPI was purified by maltose affinity column, cleaved off its tandem-fused MBP tag, and then repurified with size-exclusion chromatography (Experimental procedures) (Fig. S1A). A graphical overview of our study is summarized in Figure 1B. To determine the temperature profile of polymerase extension activity, we measured the extension rate of DNA polymerase I of psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic origins across a range of incubation temperatures. Briefly, we use a fluorometric assay to monitor the level of fluorescence over time at different incubation temperatures. When the polymerase extends from the primed template, we can detect an increase of fluorescence emission due to binding of dsDNA to the EvaGreen fluorophore. As the fluorescence level is linearly proportional to the amount of dsDNA product, we can thus infer the polymerase extension activity by calculating the initial rate of fluorescence change per unit time (Experimental procedures). We were able to detect robust activity in the recombinantly purified PIPI (left panel in Fig. 2A), suggesting it is biochemically active. Similar to its mesophilic ortholog, the Klenow fragment (KleLF), PIPI exhibits peak activity at around 37 °C. This is consistent with previous reports that the optimal temperature of enzyme activity can differ from the temperature to which the host organism is adapted (26Piotrowski Y. Gurung M.K. Larsen A.N. Characterization and engineering of a DNA polymerase reveals a single amino-acid substitution in the fingers subdomain to increase strand-displacement activity of A-family prokaryotic DNA polymerases.BMC Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 30Brown H.S. Licata V.J. Enthalpic switch-points and temperature dependencies of DNA binding and nucleotide incorporation by Pol i DNA polymerases.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1834: 2133-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The KleLF lacking the 3′→5′ exonuclease domain (KleExo-) exhibits higher activity across all temperature ranges, suggesting that the observed activity may also be dependent on the presence of the exonuclease domain. As expected, Taq DNA polymerase is inactive at low temperatures below 30 °C and its activity continues to increase at up to 72 °C. Strikingly, PIPI exhibits higher extension activity than KleLF at or below 37 °C (Fig. 2B). The fold difference in activity between PIPI and Taq is even more dramatic, displaying over a 10-fold difference at 30 °C. PIPI activity decreases with an increasing reaction temperature because of thermal inhibition. Our observation is thus consistent with the hypothesis that enzymes of psychrophilic origin are evolved to have higher activity, even at moderate temperatures. Previous reports showed that P. ingrahamii could grow and replicate at negative 12 °C (28Auman A.J. Breeze J.L. Gosink J.J. Kämpfer P. Staley J.T. Psychromonas ingrahamii sp. nov., a novel gas vacuolate, psychrophilic bacterium isolated from Arctic polar sea ice.Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2006; 56: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We thus reasoned that PIPI should remain active below 0 °C. Using 5′-fluorescently labeled primers (Experimental procedures), we performed a gel-based primer extension assay to measure the activity of PIPI and the KleLF at −19 °C in an aqueous solution that had been supplemented with 30% glycerol. Strikingly, we discover that PIPI retains extension activity as it completed extension of a primed template with a 5-nucleotide gap under 7 h, whereas the KleLF did not (Fig. 2C). The KleLF failed to complete extension at −19 °C up to 23 h (Fig. 2C). We wondered whether this is due to inhibition of KleLF binding to dsDNA. By modeling the thermodynamics of binding in previous data, we found that the KleLF binds to dsDNA favorably at down to −19 °C (ΔG: −9.48 kcal/mol) (31Datta K. Wowor A.J. Richard A.J. LiCata V.J. Temperature dependence and thermodynamics of klenow polymerase binding to primed-template DNA.Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 1739-1751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This suggests the KleLF is catalytically inactivated at low temperatures, as suggested by other studies (30Brown H.S. Licata V.J.

Acta. 2013; 1834: 2133-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 32Rentergent J. Driscoll M.D. Hay S. Time course analysis of enzyme-catalyzed DNA polymerization.Biochemistry. 2016; 55: 5622-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In the later part of this article, we discuss several exciting possibilities of utilizing PIPI for subzero reactions that may open the door for novel biochemical applications. To profile polymerase errors across a range of reaction temperatures and conditions, we adapted a high-throughput multiplexed sequencing approach (33Lee D.F. Lu J. Chang S. Loparo J.J. Xie X.S. Mapping DNA polymerase errors by single-molecule sequencing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44e118Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, a reaction mixture that contains a complementary primer and ssDNA pUC19 fragment (NEB) is equilibrated to the desired temperature before the addition of polymerase. Unless otherwise noted, the mixture is buffered against 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (Mops, pH 8.5) whose pKa has relatively small temperature dependence. It is essential to control for changes in pH as this can influence enzyme fidelity independently of the temperature (34Ling L.L. Keohavong P. Dias C. Thilly W.G. Optimization of the polymerase chain reaction with regard to fidelity: Modified T7, Taq, and vent DNA polymerases.Genome Res. 1991; 1: 63-69Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). After quenching, dsDNA products are PCR-amplified, purified, and pooled at equimolar concentrations for sequencing on a MiSeq 2 × 300 bp platform (Experimental procedures). We found no runoff amplification by-products in up to 26 rounds of PCR amplification, while 20 rounds of PCR amplification failed to yield sufficient DNA amount for downstream purification (Fig. S2A). The purified libraries are pooled and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform. We deconvolved the sequenced reads by their reaction indices and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), removed sequencing errors by trimming reads with low quality, and called consensus sequence of molecules. Quantification of base counts with high sequence consensus reveals uniform coverage along the entire pUC19 template, indicating no substantial positional effect on measurement dropout. An overview of the experimental and analytical workflows is illustrated in Figure 3A. We categorized replication error events as substitution, deletion, or insertion error and quantified the frequency of these error types in each unique molecule. As insertion and deletion events are relatively rare, we focused our analysis primarily on substitution error of psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic DNA polymerases in Figure 4A. A comprehensive report of error rates and coverage for thermophilic, psychrophilic, and mesophilic DNA polymerases is presented in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3. Quantification of the Q5 DNA polymerase error rate in its native buffer (Q5NativeBuffer) at 72 °C provides a baseline for our measurement, revealing an average substitution, deletion, and insertion rates of 4.44 × 10−6, 9.50 × 10−7, and 1.37 × 10−7 per base, respectively, which agrees well with previously reported values (Table 1) (33Lee D.F. Lu J. Chang S. Loparo J.J. Xie X.S. Mapping DNA polymerase errors by single-molecule sequencing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44e118Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 35Altschuler S.M. What is LBS and what does it mean „ for your business?.Doctor. 2010; 3: 26-28Google Scholar). Phusion (Thermo Fisher), another high-fidelity and commonly used thermophilic polymerase, has a similar substitution rate of 5.05 × 10−6 per base (Table 1) at 72 °C in its native Phusion HF buffer (PhusionNativeBuffer; Thermo Fisher). We discover that the substitution rate of Phusion DNA polymerase increases by more than a factor of two when switched from its native buffer to Mops; furthermore, we notice an increased substitution rate of Phusion polymerase in its native buffer (PhusionNativeBuffer) in lower reaction temperatures. We suspect the native buffer of Phusion polymerase (Thermo Fisher) is designed for a specific temperature and its pH is highly temperature dependent. In low temperatures, the pH changes in the buffer system cause suboptimal polymerase fidelity. This would explain why the substitution rate of Phusion in the Mops buffer remains relatively invariant to temperature changes (Table 1 and right panel in Fig. 4A). Supporting this hypothesis, we do not observe substantial differences in the substitution rate of Q5 polymerase in the Mops buffer between 30 °C and 72 °C. Our finding strongly suggests that thermophilic polymerases from commercial sources should use alternative buffers to ensure optimal fidelity at low temperatures.Table 1Error rates (per base) for thermophilic DNA polymerasesOriginReactionTemperature (°C)Substitution rate (base−1)Deletion rate (base−1)Insertion rate (base−1)Bases countedThermophileQ5NB724.44 × 10−69.50 × 10−71.37 × 10−715,536,120Q5306.04 × 10−67.45 × 10−75.31 × 10−76,001,934Q5725.38 × 10−6NDND6,340,445Taq306.32 × 10−52.27 × 10−62.01 × 10−66,497,391Taq502.18 × 10−42.18 × 10−53.53 × 10−66,320,921PhusionNB302.51 × 10−5ND8.32 × 10−72,064,657PhusionNB508.11 × 10−6NDND478,302PhusionNB725.05 × 10−6NDND10,515,198Phusion302.02 × 10−52.32 × 10−64.81 × 10−76,479,246Phusion503.64 × 10−52.46 × 10−64.84 × 10−77,260,714Phusion721.24 × 10−5ND5.11 × 10−76,182,116NB denotes the reaction carried out in the native buffer supplied by the manufacturer.ND denotes the error frequency below the detectable error baseline.

Intriguingly, we observe a substantial temperature dependence for psychrophilic and mesophilic polymerase substitution error rates. The effect is most dramatic on PIPI and KleExo- whose substitution rate rose by more than 5- and 30-fold, respectively, between reaction temperatures of 10 °C and 50 °C (Tables 2 and 3) (left and center panels in Fig. 4A). Similarly, the deletion rate also scales positively with the reaction temperature for PIPI and KleExo- (Tables 2 and 3) (Fig. S2B). Curiously, the temperature effect on the substitution error rate of the KleLF and T4 polymerases is not monotonic, revealing a maximum substitution rate at 37 °C (Table 3) (center panel in Fig. 4A). This is consistent with the observation that T4 DNA polymerase's error rate can decrease at a higher temperature (36Bessman M.J. Reha-Krantz L.J. Studies on the biochemical basis of spontaneous mutation - effect of temperature on mutation frequency.J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Comparison of KleLF and KleExo- suggests that the presence of an exonuclease domain may have a dominant and inhibitory effect on the error rate at a high reaction temperature. To investigate whether there is an activity-fidelity trade-off, we quantified the relationship between the extension activity and substitution error rate for polymerases with and without exonuclease activity using linear regression model (Fig. 4, B and C). For PIPI and KleLF, which are predicted to exhibit exonuclease activity, we found that extension activity (log2) significantly predicted the substitution error rate (log2), b = 1.1502, t(14) = 4.385, p < 0.001. Strikingly, we observed a similar relationship in Taq and KleExo- polymerases that lack exonuclease activity, b = 1.1394, t(10) = 5.088, p < 0.01. Intuitively, our model predicts that for every doubling of polymerase activity, the polymerase error rate increases by about a factor of 2.2. Extension activity (log2) also explained a significant portion of variance in the substitution error rate (log2), R2 = 0.597, F(1, 13) = 19.23, p < 0.001 (Fig. 4B), and R2 = 0.742, F(1, 9) = 25.89, p < 0.001 (Fig. 4C). We next analyzed the changes in substitution error spectrum across the reaction temperatures. The reaction temperature had the most substantial effect on the substitution spectrum of KleExo-. As expected, an increase in the reaction temperature is associated with an increased frequency of transversion relative to transition errors (Fig. S2C). Meanwhile, the reaction temperature had a relatively mild effect on the substitution spectrum of other polymerases that we investigated. The polymerase replication error rate is context dependent (37de Paz A.M. Cybulski T.R. Marblestone A.H. Zamft B.M. Church G.M. Boyden E.S. Kording K.P. Tyo K.E.J.

We wondered whether phylogenetically related polymerases that experienced vastly different temperature adaptation would produce substitution profiles similar to each other. We also asked whether these profiles varied across reaction temperatures and polymerase phylogeny. To validate the phylogenetic relations, we aligned the primary peptide sequences of PIPI to polymerases with known family assignment (Fig. S3A). To analyze the relations between polymerase family and sequence context of substitution errors, we generated a 3-mer substitution spectrum for each condition. The entire spectrum consists of 192 permutations (4 possible nucleotides each at −1, 0, +1 positions, and three possible mutated bases). To enrich for informative motif, we kept 3-mer substitutions that occurred at greater than 20% frequency in at least a single reaction and removed the rest from further analysis. This filtering step allows us to narrow down to 60 distinct 3-mer substitutions (∼31.3% of the entire 3-mer spectrum) and focus on substitutions that are common in at least some of the reactions. The hierarchical clustering of the filtered 3-mer substitution matrix reveals substitution profiles generated by the same polymerase cluster across different reaction temperatures. This indicates that the effect of the reaction temperature on polymerase substitution"

Grounded theory (GT) was employed to understand families’ experiences when caring for children with special healthcare needs (CSHCN) in rural areas. Forty-three family members from thirty-four families with CSHCN participated in in-depth interviews. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. The constant comparative method was used for data analysis and coding analysis. Adjusting family’s life was the emergent theory which included experiencing negative effects, managing in home environment, integrating care into a community health system, and maintaining family normalization. This study describes the process that families undergo in trying to care for CSHCN while managing their lives to maintain a sense of normalcy. This theory provides some intervention opportunities for health care professionals when dealing with the complexities in their homes, communities and other ambulatory settings throughout the disease trajectory, and also indicates the importance of taking into consideration the family’s cultural background."
https://openalex.org/W3209435822,"Hearing impairment (HI) is a highly heterogeneous genetic disorder and is classified into nonsyndromic (without any other clinical manifestations) and syndromic (if combined with other clinical presentations) forms. Variations in GJB2 gene are the leading cause of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) in several populations worldwide. This study was carried out to investigate the prevalence of GJB2 variations in severe-to-profound hearing impaired families of Southern Punjab of Pakistan. Ten families segregating ARNSHL were recruited from different areas of the region. Sanger sequencing of GJB2 coding region was carried out. In two out of ten families, NM_004004:c.*71G>A (p.(Trp24*)) and NM_004004:c.358_360del (p.(Glu120del)) homozygous variants were identified as the cause of hearing loss. Our study showed that GJB2-related hearing loss accounts for at least 20% of all cases with severe-to-profound hearing loss in the Southern Punjab population of Pakistan."
https://openalex.org/W3209504350,"To determine the cost effectiveness of molecular monitoring in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (CML-CP) compared to no molecular monitoring from a Chinese payer perspective.Analyses were conducted using a semi-Markov model with a 50-year time horizon. Population data from multicenter registry-based studies of Chinese patients with CML-CP informed the model. Transition probabilities were based on time-to-event data from the literature. Utility values were obtained from published studies and were assumed to be the same for patients with and without molecular monitoring. Costs were based on values commonly used in the Chinese healthcare system, including drug acquisition, drug administration, follow-up, treatment for disease progression, molecular monitoring, and terminal care costs, and were in the local currency (2020 Chinese Yuan RMB [¥]). Outcomes were total life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.Molecular monitoring was dominant to no molecular monitoring, with increased LYs (1.52) and QALYs (1.90) and costs savings (¥93,840) over a lifetime compared to no monitoring in discounted analyses. The opportunity of patients that receive molecular monitoring to discontinue treatment during treatment-free remission, an opportunity not afforded to those without molecular monitoring, was the principle driver of this result. Results were similar across multiple clinical scenarios. Particularly, molecular monitoring remained dominant even if the proportion of patients achieving deep molecular response (DMR) was reduced by 10%-30%, or the proportion of patients maintaining DMR for 1 year was reduced by 10%-30% or increased by 10%. Cost savings in these scenarios ranged from ¥62,230 to ¥103,964.Overall, this analysis demonstrates that adherence to guideline recommendations of regular molecular monitoring of patients with CML-CP treated with TKIs provides significant clinical benefit that leads to substantial cost savings compared to no molecular monitoring from the perspective of a Chinese payer. In a time where healthcare systems have limited resources to allocate to optimal patient care, investment in molecular monitoring is an ideal choice for improving patient benefits at a reduced cost."
https://openalex.org/W3208158865,"Parents play a key role in providing nurturance and nurturing care to their child during the first 1000 days which is important for optimal child development. Various factors have been found to influence parenting but the contribution of these factors toward parental nurturance within the first 1000 days is not yet known in the South African context. This paper describes a protocol for a project that aims to develop a logic model of change for the determinants of parental nurturance in the first 1000 days in the South African context.This study will apply a mixed methods approach with a sequential design within an intervention mapping framework. The study will occur in two phases. The first phase will identify the problem, which will be done via a scoping review, a policy review and a needs assessment for parents and stakeholders. This phase will recruit approximately 35 participants (20 parents and 15 stakeholders) for the qualitative component and then approximately 398 participants for the quantitative component. Data will be collected via semi-structured interviews and with questionnaires (Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment Inventory, the Depression and Anxiety Scale, and the Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale). Data will be thematically analysed, and the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) will be used to determine descriptive statistics, both of which will inform the development of the model in phase 2. The second phase will be the development of a logic model of change for determinants for parental nurturance in the first thousand days. This phase will consist of one stage- a consensus workshop which will be attended by approximately 20 participants (5 parents, 5 pregnant woman/new mothers, and 10 stakeholders). The data collected in this stage will be thematically analysed and will contribute to the refinement of the model.The first thousand days (FTD) is a period in which rapid growth occurs in all domains of development. If children do not receive sensitive and responsive care in an environment that is conducive for their optimal development, children may not reach their full developmental potential."
https://openalex.org/W3208909193,"The goal of preimplantation development is to establish the fates of the embryonic and extra-embryonic cells. However, when and how cell fates are determined during early mammalian embryonic development remains unclear. We report that the high mobility group (HMG) protein family member HMGA1 was distributed differentially in mouse two-cell blastomeres. Knockdown of Hmga1 expression in one of the two cells reduced the number of cells contributing to the inner cell mass (ICM), suggesting that differential distribution of HMGA1 in the blastomeres in two-cell mouse embryos affected the selection of embryonic cell lineages. Mechanistically, HMGA1 promotes the expression of the ICM-specific gene Sox2. The results of this study show that mouse embryos demonstrate heterogeneity as early as the two-cell stage, and that these differences are related to cell-fate differentiation in early mouse embryos."
https://openalex.org/W3209158540,"Ecological and conservation genetic studies often use noninvasive sampling, especially with elusive or endangered species. Because microsatellites are generally short in length, they can be amplified from low quality samples such as feces. Microsatellites are highly polymorphic so few markers are enough for reliable individual identification, kinship determination, or population characterization. However, the genotyping process from feces is expensive and time consuming. Given next-generation sequencing (NGS) and recent software developments, automated microsatellite genotyping from NGS data may now be possible. These software packages infer the genotypes directly from sequence reads, increasing throughput. Here we evaluate the performance of four software packages to genotype microsatellite loci from Iberian wolf (Canis lupus) feces using NGS. We initially combined 46 markers in a single multiplex reaction for the first time, of which 19 were included in the final analyses. Megasat was the software that provided genotypes with fewer errors. Coverage over 100X provided little additional information, but a relatively high number of PCR replicates were necessary to obtain a high quality genotype from highly unoptimized, multiplexed reactions (10 replicates for 18 of the 19 loci analyzed here). This could be reduced through optimization. The use of new bioinformatic tools and next-generation sequencing data to genotype these highly informative markers may increase throughput at a reasonable cost and with a smaller amount of laboratory work. Thus, high throughput sequencing approaches could facilitate the use of microsatellites with fecal DNA to address ecological and conservation questions."
https://openalex.org/W3209804308,"Cellular mechanical properties can reveal physiologically relevant characteristics in many cell types, and several groups have developed microfluidics-based platforms to perform high-throughput single-cell mechanical testing. However, prior work has performed only limited characterization of these platforms' technical variability and reproducibility. Here, we evaluate the repeatability performance of mechano-node-pore sensing, a single-cell mechanical phenotyping platform developed by our research group. We measured the degree to which device-to-device variability and semi-manual data processing affected this platform's measurements of single-cell mechanical properties. We demonstrated high repeatability across the entire technology pipeline even for novice users. We then compared results from identical mechano-node-pore sensing experiments performed by researchers in two different laboratories with different analytical instruments, demonstrating that the mechanical testing results from these two locations are in agreement. Our findings quantify the expectation of technical variability in mechano-node-pore sensing even in minimally experienced hands. Most importantly, we find that the repeatability performance we measured is fully sufficient for interpreting biologically relevant single-cell mechanical measurements with high confidence."
https://openalex.org/W3210284980,"Mental health problems follow a distinct socio-economic gradient and contribute to the health inequalities. The study aims to analyse the socio-economic and demographic factors of self-reported mental health complaints (stress, depressiveness, overtiredness, suicidal thoughts) among employed adult population in Estonia.Data on 4041 employed respondents (2064 men and 1977 women) aged 20-64 years from nationally representative health surveys from years 2016 and 2018 in Estonia were used for the study. Dependent variables included self-reported stress, depressiveness, overtiredness, and suicidal thoughts. Descriptive statistics and both log-binomial and Poisson regression analysis were used to describe the socio-economic and demographic variations in these mental health complaints.More than half of the respondents had either stress, depressiveness, overtiredness or suicidal thoughts with 25% reporting two or more of mental health complaints. Lower personal income was associated with higher rates of all mental health complaints (stress, depressiveness, overtiredness, and suicidal thoughts) among employed adults in Estonia. Additionally, lower education was associated with higher prevalence of depressiveness and lower job skills predicted higher prevalence of suicidal thoughts. Higher prevalence ratios for depressiveness and overtiredness were found for women compared to men whereas Estonians had higher prevalence ratios for stress and suicidal thoughts compared to non-Estonians. All mental health complaints were more frequently reported at younger ages (compared to 50-64-year olds) and by not married or cohabiting respondents.High prevalence of mental health complaints and their socio-economic and demographic patterning refer to considerable inequalities in mental health among employed adults. Policy actions targeting especially younger adults and those with financial difficulties are needed to address these early manifestations of mental health problems."
https://openalex.org/W3210628869,"Adaptive memory is the propensity of human memory to easily store and retrieve important information to deal with challenges related to the Pleistocene. Recent evidence shows that humans have had a multiregional evolution across the African continent, including the rainforests and deciduous forests; however, there is little evidence regarding the implications of these origins and the relevant and recurring challenges of these environments on survival processing advantage in memory. In this study, we conducted an experiment with volunteers to analyze whether adaptive memory operates in the retrieval of important information to solve challenges of using medicinal plants to treat diseases in the ancestral environments of the savanna, rainforests, and deciduous forests compared to the modern environments of desert, tundra, coniferous forest, and urban areas. We used simulated survival environments and asked volunteers (30 per simulated scenario) to imagine themselves sick in one of these environments, and needing to find medicinal plants to treat their disease. The volunteers rated the relevance of 32 words to solve this challenge, followed by a surprise memory test. Our results showed no ancestral priority in recalling relevant information, as both ancestral and modern environments showed a similar recall of relevant information. This suggests that the evolved cognitive apparatus allows human beings to survive and can create survival strategies to face challenges imposed in various environments. We believe that this is only possible if the human mind operates through a flexible cognitive mechanism. This flexibility can reflect, for example, the different environments that the first hominids inhabited and the different dangerous situations that they faced."
https://openalex.org/W3210685777,"Public key encryption with equality test enables the user to determine whether two ciphertexts contain the same information without decryption. Therefore, it may serve as promising cryptographic technique for cloud-assisted wireless sensor networks (CWSNs) to maintain data privacy. In this paper, an efficient RSA with equality test algorithm is proposed. The presented scheme also handles the attackers based on their authorization ability. Precisely, the proposed scheme is proved to be one-way against chosen-ciphertext attack security and indistinguishable against chosen ciphertext attacks. Moreover, the experimental evaluations depict that the underlying scheme is efficient in terms of encryption, decryption, and equality testing. Thus, this scheme may be used as a practical solution in context of CWSNs, where the users may compare two ciphertexts without decryption."
