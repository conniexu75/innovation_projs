Protecting the integrity of endolysosomal membranes in both physiological and pathophysiological contexts is critical to cell health. Skowyra et al. describe a role for the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery on endolysosomal organelles during membrane repair (see the Perspective by Gutierrez and Carlton). The ESCRTs act as first responders to repair limited membrane damage and thereby restore compartmental integrity and function. This ESCRT activity is distinct from organelle disposal pathways. These findings will be important in understanding cellular responses to invading pathogens and potentially disruptive proinflammatory particulates. Science , this issue p. eaar5078 ; see also p. 33"

https://openalex.org/W2796159550,"Maternal behaviors are essential for the survival of the young. Previous studies implicated the medial preoptic area (MPOA) as an important region for maternal behaviors, but details of the maternal circuit remain incompletely understood. Here we identify estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1)-expressing cells in the MPOA as key mediators of pup approach and retrieval. Reversible inactivation of MPOAEsr1+ cells impairs those behaviors, whereas optogenetic activation induces immediate pup retrieval. In vivo recordings demonstrate preferential activation of MPOAEsr1+ cells during maternal behaviors and changes in MPOA cell responses across reproductive states. Furthermore, channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping reveals a strong inhibitory projection from MPOAEsr1+ cells to ventral tegmental area (VTA) non-dopaminergic cells. Pathway-specific manipulations reveal that this projection is essential for driving pup approach and retrieval and that VTA dopaminergic cells are reliably activated during those behaviors. Altogether, this study provides new insight into the neural circuit that generates maternal behaviors."

Herpesviruses comprise a large DNA genome enclosed in a large and complex protein cage called a capsid (see the Perspective by Heldwein). Dai and Zhou used electron microscopy to determine a high-resolution structure of the HSV-1 capsid bound to the tegument proteins that occupy the space between the capsid and the nuclear envelope. The structure suggests how these components may play a role in viral transport.

In terms of morphology, up to 95% of an astrocyte’s volume comprises processes (Shigetomi et al., 2013Shigetomi E. Bushong E.A. Haustein M.D. Tong X. Jackson-Weaver O. Kracun S. Xu J. Sofroniew M.V.

Individual processes from astrocytes contact blood vessels, neuronal cell bodies, and tens of thousands of synapses (Bushong et al., 2002Bushong E.A. Martone M.E. Jones Y.Z. Ellisman M.H.

Three-dimensional relationships between hippocampal synapses and astrocytes.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6897-6906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this way, astrocyte processes are positioned to respond to neurotransmitters and to modulate synapses (Khakh and Sofroniew, 2015Khakh B.S. Sofroniew M.V. Diversity of astrocyte functions and phenotypes in neural circuits.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 942-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Additionally, the close apposition of astrocyte processes to synapses may be necessary for their ability to regulate synapse formation and removal (Allen and Eroglu, 2017Allen N.J. Eroglu C. Cell Biology of Astrocyte-Synapse Interactions.Neuron. 2017; 96: 697-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Moreover, the close proximity of astrocyte processes to synapses is important for homeostatic functions such as the regulation of neurotransmitter uptake and ion homeostasis, and for restricting diffusion in the extracellular milieu. Work in the hypothalamus illustrates that the proximity of astrocyte processes to synapses is altered by lactation and dehydration (Oliet et al., 2001Oliet S.H. Piet R. Poulain D.A. Control of glutamate clearance and synaptic efficacy by glial coverage of neurons.Science. 2001; 292: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, Theodosis et al., 1986Theodosis D.T.

Oxytocin induces morphological plasticity in the adult hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system.Nature. 1986; 322: 738-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition to their roles in the healthy nervous system, astrocytes respond to all forms of brain trauma, infection, injury, and disease, and these changes are also frequently accompanied by altered morphology (Khakh and Sofroniew, 2015Khakh B.S. Sofroniew M.V. Diversity of astrocyte functions and phenotypes in neural circuits.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 942-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Overall, the literature is replete with examples showing how astrocytes regulate neuronal function. Much of this work invokes or assumes the close apposition of astrocyte processes to synapses, but this has been difficult to directly study at rest, following neuronal activity, or in models of disease. Hence, a fundamental aspect of brain biology, namely the proximity of synapses and astrocyte processes, has remained largely unexplored. Despite progress with tissue culture systems using postnatal day 6–7 mice (Bernardinelli et al., 2014Bernardinelli Y. Randall J. Janett E. Nikonenko I. König S. Jones E.V. Flores C.E. Murai K.K. Bochet C.G. Holtmaat A. Muller D. Activity-dependent structural plasticity of perisynaptic astrocytic domains promotes excitatory synapse stability.Curr.

Cooperative astrocyte and dendritic spine dynamics at hippocampal excitatory synapses.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8881-8891Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), there is currently no way to measure the proximity of astrocyte processes to synapses in adult living brain tissue, to explore differences with respect to genetically defined types of neural inputs, or to determine how proximity changes in mouse models of disease. In addition, astrocytes cultured in serum represent an immature or reactive phenotype (Cahoy et al., 2008Cahoy J.D. Emery B. Kaushal A. Foo L.C. Zamanian J.L. Christopherson K.S. Xing Y. Lubischer J.L. Krieg P.A. Krupenko S.A. et al.A transcriptome database for astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes: a new resource for understanding brain development and function.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 264-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar), they change between the postnatal period and adulthood (Srinivasan et al., 2016Srinivasan R. Lu T.-Y. Chai H. Xu J.

Glutamate-dependent neuroglial calcium signaling differs between young and adult brain.Science. 2013; 339: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), and their elaborate morphology requires neuronal contacts (Stogsdill et al., 2017Stogsdill J.A. Ramirez J. Liu D. Kim Y.H. Baldwin K.T. Enustun E. Ejikeme T. Ji R.R. Eroglu C. Astrocytic neuroligins control astrocyte morphogenesis and synaptogenesis.Nature. 2017; 551: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), highlighting the need for methods to study adult brain preparations. As such, it remains unclear whether the interactions of astrocyte processes with synapses are dynamic or largely stable in adult brain. We sought to address these issues by developing an approach to measure astrocyte process-to-synapse proximity in live brain preparations for genetically defined cell populations. In this study, we report such an approach. We termed it the neuron-astrocyte proximity assay (NAPA) and used it to assess several open questions. Our aim was to develop an imaging-based neuron-astrocyte proximity assay utilizing Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between astrocyte processes and presynaptic terminals (Figure 1A). FRET is compatible with live imaging and provides spatial information at synaptic distance scales (Lakowicz, 2006Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Springer, 2006Crossref Scopus (17894) Google Scholar). We also wanted to avoid potential problems associated with irreversible complementation using split GFP and HRP that may stabilize transient interactions (Feinberg et al., 2008Feinberg E.H. Vanhoven M.K. Bendesky A. Wang G. Fetter R.D. Shen K. Bargmann C.I.

Methods. 2011; 9: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, Martell et al., 2016Martell J.D. Yamagata M. Deerinck T.J. Phan S. Kwa C.G. Ellisman M.H. Sanes J.R. Ting A.Y. A split horseradish peroxidase for the detection of intercellular protein-protein interactions and sensitive visualization of synapses.Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 774-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We reasoned that appropriate green and red fluorescent proteins (GFPs and RFPs, respectively) capable of FRET such as GFP and mCherry would provide three types of information based on the ∼1/r6 fall in FRET efficiency as a function of distance. The point-spread function of our microscope was ∼0.6 μm (determined by imaging fluorescent beads). This means that the images shown are diffraction limited at ∼0.6 μm x-y resolution. In relation to this, FRET occurs between appropriate molecules when the emission spectrum of the donor overlaps with the absorption spectrum of a cognate acceptor. FRET does not require radiative emission and occurs by dipole-dipole coupling from the donor’s excited state. The efficiency of energy transfer between donor and acceptor pairs is determined by their spectral overlap, the quantum yield of the donor, the relative orientation of donor and acceptor dipoles, and the distance between the donors and acceptors (r) with a steep 1/r6 relationship, which is summarized in the Förster equation (Figure 1B). Hence, FRET can be used as a spectroscopic ruler to measure proximities, spatial interactions, and under ideal circumstances absolute distances (Stryer, 1978Stryer L. Fluorescence energy transfer as a spectroscopic ruler.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). FRET does not increase the resolution of the imaging system; FRET transduces a near-field interaction into a far-field signal that can be used to assess biological proximity below the diffraction limit. Therefore, the FRET images shown are diffraction limited, but FRET permits inference of proximity several orders of magnitude below the imaged diffraction-limited volumes (Grecco and Verveer, 2011Grecco H.E. Verveer P.J. FRET in cell biology: still shining in the age of super-resolution?.ChemPhysChem. 2011; 12: 484-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). FRET efficiency reflects energy transfer between the fluorophores and its relationship to proximity by the Förster equation, whereas the FRET area is the area of the ROIs from which FRET was measured. For NAPA, the distance at which FRET efficiency is 50% (the R0 for GFP and mCherry) is ∼5.1 nm, meaning that FRET would be sensitive to changes over ∼10 nm between ∼5% and ∼95% of its maximum efficiency (Figure 1B). The closest and most proximate interactions between astrocyte processes and synapses where the donor GFP and acceptor mCherry fluorophores undergo energy transfer would be detected as areas of FRET and colocalization between the FPs: these would be at scales of ∼10 nm (Figures 1A and 1B). Longer distance scale interactions beyond Förster energy transfer, but at about the diffraction limit of confocal microscopy (∼0.6 μm), would be detected as areas of colocalization but would not yield measurable FRET (Figures 1A and 1B). The areas of a labeled astrocyte that contain labeled synapses but displayed neither FRET nor colocalization would indicate spatial interactions that occur over distances of about a micrometer or more, i.e., at distances above the diffraction limit (Figures 1A and 1B). The presynaptic NAPA component comprised a 29 residue N-terminal nematode β-integrin PAT3 signal peptide, extracellular mCherry, an extracellular domain of ∼23 Å length, and the Neurexin-1 transmembrane and cytosolic domains chosen to target presynaptic terminals (Fairless et al., 2008Fairless R. Masius H. Rohlmann A. Heupel K. Ahmad M. Reissner C. Dresbach T. Missler M. Polarized targeting of neurexins to synapses is regulated by their C-terminal sequences.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 12969-12981Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, Kim et al., 2011Kim J. Zhao T. Petralia R.S. Yu Y. Peng H. Myers E. Magee J.C. mGRASP enables mapping mammalian synaptic connectivity with light microscopy.Nat. Methods. 2011; 9: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We termed the presynaptic neuronal NAPA construct “NAPA-n” (Figure 1C; Figures S1A and S1B). The astrocyte NAPA component comprised a 31 residue N-terminal murine immunoglobulin kappa-chain V-J2-C IgK signal peptide followed by GFP, an extracellular domain of ∼27 Å length, and the PDGFR transmembrane domain. We termed the astrocyte NAPA construct “NAPA-a” (Figure 1C; Figures S1A and S1B). The extracellular spacer in NAPA-a was a myc-tag and a small linker, whereas the equivalent spacer in NAPA-n was the CD4-2 domain and a linker (Figure 1C). In the case of NAPA-a, we used different length linkers and found that 12 residues worked reliably. We report data with GFP and mCherry FRET pairs in this study. Figure S1E reports constructs with mNeonGreen and mScarlet. For testing, we expressed NAPA-a and NAPA-n in HEK293 cells (Figures S1A and S2A–S2F). Both constructs were expressed on the cell edges, and total and cell-surface pools could be detected with antibodies against the FPs in permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells, respectively (Figures S2A–S2C; n = 8 and 14 cells from 3 transfections). Furthermore, acidic pH buffers quenched cell surface fluorescence of NAPA-a or NAPA-n (Figures S2D–S2F; n = 21 cells, 4 transfections). During these experiments, we used two methods to measure FRET between mCherry and GFP: donor dequenching (Figures S3A–S3E; n = 15–31 cells, n = 4 transfections) and sensitized emission (Figures S4A–S4D; n = 40 cells, n = 4 transfections) with mCherry and GFP expressed separately or as a fusion protein (Figures S3 and S4). The estimates of proximity were similar for the mCherry-GFP fusion construct using either method (Figure S3C, S4C, and S4D). Since sensitized emission FRET does not destroy the FPs, we used this subsequently. We expressed NAPA-a and NAPA-n separately in HEK293 cells and co-plated the transfected cells. We focused on clusters of cells with juxtaposed NAPA-a- and NAPA-n-expressing cells (Figure 1D). In these, we could image NAPA-a and NAPA-n colocalization at the shared edges and significant FRET in a further subregion (∼11%) of the colocalized area (Figure 1E; n = 58 cells, n = 3 transfections). Colocalization was also measured between adjacent cells expressing NAPA-n and Lck-GFP or NAPA-n and cytosolic GFP; however, in cases when the donor FP was intracellular, no FRET was detected (Figure 1E; n = 37 and 28 cells, n = 3 transfections). These data provide strong evidence that cell surface NAPA-a and NAPA-n detect cell-cell contacts by colocalization and that smaller areas representing the closest interactions between plasma membranes are detected by FRET. The controls also define “noise” as ∼3% (Figure 1E). NAPA-a and NAPA-n were expressed and localized to distal cell regions in cultured astrocytes and neurons (Figure S4E; n = 3 transfections), permitting their deployment in vivo. The striatum is the largest nucleus within the basal ganglia and serves multiple roles (Graybiel, 2008Graybiel A.M. Habits, rituals, and the evaluative brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 359-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar, Graybiel and Grafton, 2015Graybiel A.M. Grafton S.T. The striatum: where skills and habits meet.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7: a021691Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Striatal direct D1 and indirect D2 pathway medium spiny neurons (MSNs) integrate glutamatergic inputs from multiple parts of the cortex and thalamus, collateral GABAergic inputs from MSNs (and interneurons), and dense dopaminergic input from the substantia nigra. How astrocytes interact with either D1 or D2 MSNs and the major striatal synaptic inputs is largely unknown, although evidence shows that astrocytes serve important functions (Martín et al., 2015Martín R. Bajo-Grañeras R. Moratalla R. Perea G. Araque A. Circuit-specific signaling in astrocyte-neuron networks in basal ganglia pathways.Science. 2015; 349: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We used NAPA to determine how striatal astrocytes interact with D1 and D2 MSNs and the major synaptic inputs of the striatum. For selective expression of NAPA-a within astrocytes in vivo (Figures 2A and 2B ; Figure S1B), we used AAV2/5 and the astrocyte-specific GfaABC1D promoter that has been extensively characterized (Chai et al., 2017Chai H.

For selective expression of NAPA-n in neurons we initially used AAV2/1 and the neuron-specific hSynapsin-1 promoter (Figures 2A and 2B; Figure S1B), but we also made FLEX-dependent AAVs and used MSN subtype-specific Cre lines (Atasoy et al., 2008Atasoy D. Aponte Y. Su H.H. Sternson S.M. A FLEX switch targets Channelrhodopsin-2 to multiple cell types for imaging and long-range circuit mapping.J.

Striatal AAV microinjections resulted in expression of NAPA-a in ∼90% of astrocytes, with no detectable expression in neurons (Figures 2C–2G; n = 1,287 astrocytes and 687 neurons, n = 4 mice). NAPA-a was also expressed within entire astrocytes equal in area to those detected by the membrane marker Lck-GFP (Figure 2H; n = 20–23 cells, 4 mice). During initial evaluations, microinjections of NAPA-n AAVs into the thalamus (Figure 2I) resulted in expression of NAPA-n locally within neuron somata (Figures 2J and 2K; 362 cells, n = 4 mice) and also within their projections in processes and bouton-like puncta in the striatum (Figure 2L; n = 4 mice). These punctate structures were significantly smaller (0.53 ± 0.01 versus 11.0 ± 0.44 μm2; p < 0.0001) and brighter (1,663 ± 6 versus 531 ± 1 a.u.; p < 0.0001) than the axon-like processes (Figure 2L; n = 3,514 puncta and 1,457 axon-like structures, 4 mice). The bouton-like puncta were also similar in size to synapses labeled with vGLUT2 antibodies in immunohistochemical evaluations (0.48 ± 0.06 μm2; n = 15,226 puncta, 4 mice; p < 0.0001). vGLUT2 labels thalamic presynaptic terminals in the striatum. These data are consistent with trafficking of NAPA-n to presynaptic terminals in the striatum via the neurexin-1 targeting motif. In support, when NAPA-n AAVs were microinjected locally into the cortex or the thalamus, 80% of the resulting puncta in the striatum colocalized with synaptophysin, a marker of presynaptic terminals (Figures S5A–S5B and S5E). Furthermore, following local intrastriatal microinjections of NAPA-n to label MSNs synapses, we found that 80% of puncta were co-labeled with synaptophysin, whereas colocalization with the dendritic marker MAP2 was minimal (Figures S5C–S5E). Thus, astrocyte process and neuronal presynaptic components of NAPA can be expressed selectively in their respective cellular compartments using appropriate AAVs, cell-specific promotors, targeting motifs, and local microinjections (Figure 2). For FRET, we analyzed punctate synaptic-like structures within the striatum. The striatum receives input from the cortex, thalamus, substantia nigra (SNc), as well as local collaterals from MSNs. We characterized astrocyte-synapse proximity for these inputs by using NAPA-a microinjections into the striatum and local NAPA-n microinjections into striatum, motor cortex, thalamus, or SNc. We identified and outlined astrocyte territories using NAPA-a and imaged presynaptic elements using NAPA-n (Figures 3A–3D). We observed robust expression of NAPA-n and NAPA-a and detected clear areas of colocalization and FRET (Figures 3A–3D). The area of colocalization as a percent of the astrocyte territory was ∼13%–15% and not significantly different between collateral, cortical, thalamic, and SNc inputs when individually evaluated (Figures 3A–3F; n = 29–30 cells, 4 mice). If one assumes no spatial overlap between distinct types of synapses within the imaged volumes, this suggests that ∼57% of a dorsolateral striatal astrocyte’s area is equivalently within micrometer scale distances from presynaptic elements from these four pathways. Since some overlap is feasible, the value of ∼57% is an upper limit. However, while collateral and corticostriatal inputs showed similar areas of FRET, there were significant differences between areas of FRET between collateral and nigrostriatal, corticostriatal, and thalamostriatal, as well as between thalamostriatal and nigrostriatal inputs (Figure 3F; 4 mice per pathway). Thus, the area of FRET was ∼2%–4% of the territory for each of these inputs and significantly different between them (Figure 3F; n = 29–30 cells, 4 mice each). These data show that up to ∼20% of the colocalized area of an astrocyte"

RBPs function in many critical cellular processes including alternative splicing, mRNA decay, translation, and subcellular mRNA localization. However, an understanding of how RBPs determine specific physiological changes in particular cell types has not been achieved. These RBPs are often broadly expressed throughout the brain and present pleiotropic phenotypes in knockout mice, reflecting many splicing and gene expression changes. The functions of these extensive post-transcriptional regulatory programs and their roles in specific neuronal cell types and circuits are still largely unexplored. The Rbfox family of brain-enriched RBPs is widely studied as regulators of alternative splicing. The three mammalian family members—Rbfox1, Rbfox2, and Rbfox3—each has a highly conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM) that binds the sequence (U)GCAUG (Conboy, 2017Conboy J.G.

Extracellular recordings in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus found that low intensity presynaptic fiber stimulation elicited larger field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the cKO compared to wild-type. Spine density and expression levels of synaptic proteins such as Synapsin-I and PSD-95 were unchanged, suggesting that a change in synaptic function rather than synapse number was responsible for neuronal hyper-excitability in the Rbfox1 Nes-cKO brain. Whole-transcriptome profiling by microarray and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) identified multiple gene expression and alternative splicing changes in the knockout mice, but these were assayed in whole brain and difficult to relate to the electrophysiological results (Gehman et al., 2011Gehman L.T.

This cytoplasmic portion of the Rbfox1 regulatory program was enriched for many key neuronal functions such as the calcium signaling pathway, as well as regulatory modules controlling cortical development and modules altered in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Lee et al., 2016Lee J.-A. Damianov A. Lin C.-H. Fontes M. Parikshak N.N. Anderson E.S. Geschwind D.H. Black D.L. Martin K.C. Cytoplasmic Rbfox1 regulates the expression of synaptic and autism-related genes.Neuron. 2016; 89: 113-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this cytoplasmic program largely affected transcripts different from those regulated by the splicing program. Thus, loss of cytoplasmic Rbfox1 likely also contributes to the pathophysiology of the Rbfox1 Nes-cKO in parallel with the splicing changes controlled by the nuclear protein. However, the specific contribution of cytoplasmic Rbfox1 to altered neuronal excitability remains unexplored. Here, we examine the changes in gene expression and electrophysiology controlled by Rbfox1, specifically in the hippocampus. We identify the vSNARE Vamp1 as a major target of cytoplasmic Rbfox1 that plays a critical role in inhibitory synaptic transmission. Our results demonstrate how regulation of Vamp1 mRNA abundance by cytoplasmic Rbfox1 controls synaptic function in a specific neuronal cell type and contributes to the greater network defects in the Rbfox1 Nes-cKO brain. To obtain a more refined view of posttranscriptional regulation specifically by Rbfox1 and specifically in the hippocampus, we performed RNA-seq on adult (P60–70) hippocampi isolated from Rbfox1 Nes-cKO and wild-type littermates (n = 3 each genotype). We identified significant changes in both alternative splicing and overall mRNA abundance, consistent with the dual role of Rbfox1 in regulation of alternative splicing and mRNA stability. As seen previously, Rbfox1-dependent gene expression changes did not significantly overlap with splicing changes (19 genes changing in both overall mRNA abundance and exon usage; Figure S1A; Table S3) (Lee et al., 2016Lee J.-A. Damianov A. Lin C.-H. Fontes M. Parikshak N.N. Anderson E.S. Geschwind D.H. Black D.L. Martin K.C. Cytoplasmic Rbfox1 regulates the expression of synaptic and autism-related genes.Neuron. 2016; 89: 113-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The gene expression changes identified in the cKO hippocampus (1,034 genes) partially overlapped (183 genes) with previously identified cytoplasmic Rbfox1 targets in cultured neurons (774 genes) (Lee et al., 2016Lee J.-A. Damianov A. Lin C.-H. Fontes M. Parikshak N.N. Anderson E.S. Geschwind D.H. Black D.L. Martin K.C. Cytoplasmic Rbfox1 regulates the expression of synaptic and autism-related genes.Neuron. 2016; 89: 113-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The differences between these RNA-seq datasets are likely due both to gene expression changes between tissue and in vitro culture, to differences between prolonged versus acute loss of Rbfox, and to the additional depletion of Rbfox3 in the previous study. Focusing on the 1,034 differentially expressed (DE) genes detected in the hippocampus, we examined the overlap of our target transcripts with Rbfox1 individual nucleotide resolution cross-linking immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) datasets from the soluble nucleoplasmic fraction of adult mouse forebrain (Damianov et al., 2016Damianov A. Ying Y. Lin C.-H. Lee J.-A. Tran D. Vashisht A.A. Bahrami-Samani E. Xing Y. Martin K.C. Wohlschlegel J.A. Black D.L. Rbfox proteins regulate splicing as part of a large multiprotein complex LASR.Cell. 2016; 165: 606-619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and from the cytoplasmic fraction of cultured primary neurons (Lee et al., 2016Lee J.-A. Damianov A. Lin C.-H. Fontes M. Parikshak N.N. Anderson E.S. Geschwind D.H. Black D.L. Martin K.C. Cytoplasmic Rbfox1 regulates the expression of synaptic and autism-related genes.Neuron. 2016; 89: 113-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We filtered the target list by requiring DE genes to contain 3′ UTR iCLIP clusters in both the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic datasets, and that these clusters also contain an Rbfox motif [(U)GCAUG] within ±10 nucleotides of the edge of the cluster (Figure 1A). These stringent filters generated a list of 15 high confidence genes directly regulated by Rbfox1 (Figure 1B; Table S4) and include adenylyl cyclase, potassium channels, neuropeptide Y, and others. Most targets were downregulated upon Rbfox1 loss, as seen previously in cultured neurons, but four were upregulated and thus appear to be repressed by the protein. Using less stringent filters, many additional transcripts are seen to be regulated by Rbfox1 (Tables S2 and S4). Vamp1 (also known as Synaptobrevin1) mRNA exhibited one of the largest changes in expression, decreasing by 50% in the Rbfox1 Nes-cKO hippocampus as measured by RNA-seq and qPCR (Figures 1B and 1D). RBFOX1 binding to the Vamp1 mRNA is restricted to the 3′ UTR and is observed in the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions, but not in the high-molecular-weight, chromatin-associated nuclear pellet where the Rbfox1 protein binds within introns to regulate splicing (Damianov et al., 2016Damianov A. Ying Y. Lin C.-H. Lee J.-A. Tran D. Vashisht A.A. Bahrami-Samani E. Xing Y. Martin K.C. Wohlschlegel J.A. Black D.L. Rbfox proteins regulate splicing as part of a large multiprotein complex LASR.Cell. 2016; 165: 606-619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). Immunoblotting for Vamp1 in cKO and wild-type adult brains, we found that Vamp1 protein, like the mRNA, was dramatically depleted by ∼80% in the cKO cortex and hippocampus (Figure 1E). Interestingly, there was relatively little effect on Vamp1 expression in the cerebellum, where its regulation presumably involves additional factors (Figures 1D and 1E). The mRNA and protein levels of the paralog Vamp2 were unchanged between Rbfox1 Nes-cKO and wild-type (Figures S1F and S1G). In the forebrain, the reduced Vamp1 mRNA and protein levels and the direct binding of RBFOX1 to the Vamp1 3′ UTR suggest a role for cytoplasmic Rbfox1 in regulating Vamp1 expression by promoting its mRNA stability and/or translation. Despite RBFOX1 binding to the Vamp1 3′ UTR, it was possible that the decreased Vamp1 expression in the cKO forebrain resulted from loss of nuclear Rbfox1 function or from indirect effects of Rbfox1 loss. To assess the mechanisms of Rbfox1-mediated regulation, we cultured primary hippocampal neurons from Rbfox1 Nes-cKO embryos that lack both the nuclear and cytoplasmic isoforms. Both Vamp1 mRNA and protein levels were reduced in cultured cKO neurons compared to the wild-type (Figure 2A), similar to the reduction observed in the adult cKO hippocampus (Figures 1D and 1E). Using adeno-associated virus (AAV) to re-express cytoplasmic Rbfox1 under the control of the human SynapsinI (hSyn) promoter in the cKO neurons, we found that this can rescue both Vamp1 mRNA and protein to levels comparable to wild-type neurons (C rescue; Figure 2A). These results demonstrate that cytoplasmic Rbfox1 is sufficient to promote Vamp1 expression. Given the observed binding in the Vamp1 3′ UTR (Figure 1C), Rbfox1 may enhance Vamp1 mRNA stability or translation. To examine the role of the Vamp1 3′ UTR in Rbfox1 regulation, we used the luciferase reporter system in primary hippocampal neurons (Figure 2B). For a reporter containing the full-length (FL) Vamp1 3′ UTR, Rbfox1 loss decreased expression by ∼50% (FL, Figures 2C and 2D). Thus, expression from transcripts containing the Vamp1 3′ UTR is strongly Rbfox1 dependent, with the residual expression possibly due to the presence of cytoplasmic Rbfox3 (Lee et al., 2016Lee J.-A. Damianov A. Lin C.-H. Fontes M. Parikshak N.N. Anderson E.S. Geschwind D.H. Black D.L. Martin K.C. Cytoplasmic Rbfox1 regulates the expression of synaptic and autism-related genes.Neuron. 2016; 89: 113-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar; and see below). We tested the roles of the seven Rbfox binding motifs (U)GCAUG in stimulating expression by mutating them to (U)GACGU. Mutation of the first six sites significantly reduced reporter expression (FLm1–6, Figures 2C and 2D), while mutation of all sites virtually abolished reporter expression (FLm1–7, Figures 2C and 2D). Notably, mutation of only the 3′-most Rbfox binding site reduced reporter expression as strongly as mutation of all six upstream sites (FLm7, Figures 2C and 2D). We did not observe a significant change in expression of the FLm1–6 mutant upon loss of Rbfox1. In contrast, there was a visible, though not statistically significant, decrease in FLm7 reporter expression with loss of Rbfox1. These different responses to the loss of Rbfox1 by the mutant 3′ UTRs may result from differences in their responses to cytoplasmic Rbfox3 (Lee et al., 2016Lee J.-A. Damianov A. Lin C.-H. Fontes M. Parikshak N.N. Anderson E.S. Geschwind D.H. Black D.L. Martin K.C. Cytoplasmic Rbfox1 regulates the expression of synaptic and autism-related genes.Neuron. 2016; 89: 113-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Overall, these results indicate that RBFOX1 binding to the Vamp1 3′ UTR strongly stimulates its expression and that the 3′-most Rbfox binding site plays a major role in this regulation. We noted that the 3′-most Rbfox binding site immediately abuts a microRNA response element (MRE) identified by TargetScan as a binding site for microRNA-9 (MiR-9 MRE, magenta; Figure 2E) (Friedman et al., 2009Friedman R.C.

The sequence encompassing these two regulatory elements shows a high degree of mammalian conservation (Figure 2E), indicating a likely regulatory function. We hypothesized that RBFOX1 binding to the 3′-most GCAUG contributes to stabilization of the Vamp1 transcript by blocking miR-9 binding. To dissect the roles of this GCAUG and the adjacent miR-9 site, we created a luciferase reporter containing a fragment of the Vamp1 3′ UTR that includes the last two Rbfox binding sites and the miR-9 site (3′F; Figure 2E). Luciferase expression from this reporter was again dependent on Rbfox1, with a 40% reduction in the cKO neurons compared to wild-type (3′F, red bar; Figure 2F). Similar to the full-length 3′ UTR, mutating the final GCAUG in this fragment dramatically decreased reporter expression (3′Fm7, black bar; Figure 2F). Conversely, mutation of the miR-9 MRE increased expression in wild-type neurons (3′F versus 3′FmiR9m, black bars; Figure 2F) and reduced the effect of Rbfox1 loss in the cKO neurons (3′F versus 3′FmiR9m, red bars; Figure 2F). A compound mutation of the miR-9 MRE and both GCAUG elements increased reporter expression relative to mutation of only the 3′-most Rbfox site (3′Fm7 versus 3′Fm6-7miR9m, black bars; Figure 2F). These results indicate that miR-9 is repressive of Vamp1 expression and that this repression is overcome by RBFOX1 binding. The enhancing effect of the upstream sites indicate that RBFOX binding can also stimulate expression on its own. To confirm miR-9 targeting of the Vamp1 3′ UTR, we used AAV to deliver a Tough Decoy (TuD) (Bak et al., 2013Bak R.O. Hollensen A.K. Primo M.N. Sørensen C.D. Mikkelsen J.G.

Methods. 2012; 9: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) containing sequence complementary to the mature miR-9 or a control sequence (Figure 2G). We observed ∼50% reduction of mature miR-9 levels in neurons transduced with the inhibitor (TuD-miR9) compared to control (TuD-ctrl) (Figure 2G). We then tested the effect of miR-9 inhibition on the expression of the FL and FLm7 reporters. Suppressing miR-9 in the presence of Rbfox1 did not significantly change expression of the FL reporter, indicating that RBFOX1 binding at the 3′ end of the UTR efficiently blocks miR-9 activity (FL, black versus orange bars; Figure 2H). In cKO neurons with this luciferase reporter, inhibition of miR-9 resulted in a visible, though not statistically significant, increase in expression compared to the control TuD (FL, red versus blue bars; Figure 2H). Notably, the results were different with the FLm7 reporter containing a mutated Rbfox binding site adjacent to the miR-9 MRE. For this construct, inhibition of miR-9 significantly increased reporter expression in the presence of Rbfox1, indicating that loss of the 3′most Rbfox binding site renders the reporter responsive to miR-9 (FLm7, orange versus black bars; Figure 2H). A similar increase in FLm7 expression with miR-9 inhibition was seen in the cKO neurons (FLm7, blue bar; Figure 2H) but did not reach statistical significance. Overall, these results indicate that RBFOX1 binding to the upstream sites promotes expression independently of miR-9, while the 3′-most Rbfox site is blocking the effect of miR-9. Vamp1 (Synaptobrevin1/Syb1) is a paralog of the well-studied vSNARE Vamp2 (Synaptobrevin2/Syb2), which is found in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons and is critical for synaptic vesicle docking and neurotransmitter release (Deák et al., 2006Deák F. Shin O.-H. Kavalali E.T. Südhof T.C. Structural determinants of synaptobrevin 2 function in synaptic vesicle fusion.J.

SNARE function analyzed in synaptobrevin/VAMP knockout mice.Science. 2001; 294: 1117-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Although much less characterized, VAMP1 is highly homologous to VAMP2 in protein sequence and domain structure (Figure 3A), and several studies have demonstrated that Vamp1 functions similarly to Vamp2 in regulating synaptic vesicle release (Liu et al., 2011Liu Y. Sugiura Y. Lin W. The role of synaptobrevin1/VAMP1 in Ca2+-triggered neurotransmitter release at the mouse neuromuscular junction.J. Physiol. 2011; 589: 1603-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, Zimmermann et al., 2014Zimmermann J. Trimbuch T. Rosenmund C. Synaptobrevin 1 mediates vesicle priming and evoked release in a subpopulation of hippocampal neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2014; 112: 1559-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We observed that both proteins are expressed in the adult mouse brain, although the onset of VAMP1 expression occurs quite late in development (P15), well after the induction of VAMP2 (E18; Figure 3B). In primary hippocampal neurons, anti-VAMP1 antibodies yielded the punctate staining pattern expected from a pre-synaptic protein. Virtually all VAMP1+ puncta also contained VAMP2, though only a subset of VAMP2 puncta were positive for VAMP1 (∼20% Vamp1+/Vamp2+; Figure 3C). The late induction of VAMP1 expression in vivo and its restricted expression in cultured neurons suggested that Vamp1 is specifically expressed in a particular neuronal cell type. Indeed, Vamp1 has been reported to be preferentially expressed at inhibitory synapses (Ferecskó et al., 2015Ferecskó A.S. Jiruska P. Foss L. Powell A.D. Chang W.-C. Sik A. Jefferys J.G.R. Structural and functional substrates of tetanus toxin in an animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy.Brain Struct. Funct. 2015; 220: 1013-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To examine Vamp1 expression in neuronal subtypes, we first performed double-label immunocytochemistry of Vamp1 and markers of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in primary hippocampal cultures. Using Gad67 as an inhibitory pre-synaptic marker, we counted all puncta that were VAMP1+ or GAD67+, or were VAMP1+/GAD67+ double positive to obtain the total number of puncta. We found that over 80% of the total puncta counted were VAMP1+/GAD67+. In a parallel analysis, Vamp1 had virtually no overlap with the excitatory markers Vglut1 and Vglut2 (Figures 4A and 4B ). We observed a similar co-localization with inhibitory markers in sections of adult mouse hippocampi. VAMP1+ puncta were enriched perisomatically in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal layers (s.p.), and in the dentate granule (DG) layer. VAMP1+ puncta were also detected more sparsely in stratum oriens (s.o.) and radiatum (s.r.) of CA1 and CA3, as well as the DG molecular layer and hilus (Figures 4C–4F and S3B–S3E; data not shown). Over 85% of puncta within the CA1 s.p. were VAMP1+/GAD67+ (Figures 4C and 4D). Notably, co-localization was significantly reduced in the Rbfox1 Nes-cKO, where ∼50% of puncta were now GAD67+/ VAMP1–. VAMP1 similarly co-localized with GAD67 in s.o. and s.r. (∼80%), with a similar reduction in the Rbfox1 Nes-cKO (∼30%) (Figure 4D). Rbfox1 loss led to a significant reduction in the number of detectable VAMP1+ puncta in all hippocampal regions assayed (Figure S3A). Given the reduced VAMP1 levels observed by immunoblot, reduced VAMP1 co-localization with GAD67 in the cKO hippocampus is likely due to a loss of VAMP1+ puncta rather than to mislocalization of the protein. The high level of co-localization between VAMP1+ and GAD67+ puncta confirmed our initial immunocytochemical observations that Vamp1 is expressed specifically in GABAergic inhibitory neurons. VAMP1 co-localization with GAD67 is also consistent with the perisomatic enrichment of VAMP1+ puncta in the pyramidal layers, an innervation pattern typical of Parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) basket cells (Tremblay et al., 2016Tremblay R. Lee S. Rudy B. GABAergic interneurons in the neocortex: From cellular properties to circuits.Neuron. 2016; 91: 260-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). We found that VAMP1 co-localized well with both PV (data not shown) and Synaptotagmin2 (SYT2), a marker of PV+ interneuron pre-synaptic terminals (Sommeijer and Levelt, 2012Sommeijer J.-P. Levelt C.N. Synaptotagmin-2 is a reliable marker for parvalbumin positive inhibitory boutons in the mouse visual cortex.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e35323Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Figures 4E and 4F). Comparable to our results with Vamp1 and Gad67, we observed a high degree of VAMP1 and SYT2 co-localization in the CA1 s.p. (over 85% of the total puncta were VAMP1+/ SYT2+ double positive) and s.o. and s.r. (∼80%; Figures 4E and 4F). The Rbfox1 Nes-cKO hippocampus again showed a significant loss of VAMP1 immunoreactivity in SYT2+ puncta (∼40%, s.p. and ∼30"
https://openalex.org/W2796346728,"Fast-spiking, parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic interneurons (PV+-BCs) express a complex machinery of rapid signaling mechanisms, including specialized voltage-gated ion channels to generate brief action potentials (APs). However, short APs are associated with overlapping Na+ and K+ fluxes and are therefore energetically expensive. How the potentially vicious combination of high AP frequency and inefficient spike generation can be reconciled with limited energy supply is presently unclear. To address this question, we performed direct recordings from the PV+-BC axon, the subcellular structure where active conductances for AP initiation and propagation are located. Surprisingly, the energy required for the AP was, on average, only ∼1.6 times the theoretical minimum. High energy efficiency emerged from the combination of fast inactivation of Na+ channels and delayed activation of Kv3-type K+ channels, which minimized ion flux overlap during APs. Thus, the complementary tuning of axonal Na+ and K+ channel gating optimizes both fast signaling properties and metabolic efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2795424243,"The main drawback of ranking of researchers by the number of papers, citations or by the Hirsch index is ignoring the problem of distributing authorship among authors in multi-author publications. So far, the single-author or multi-author publications contribute to the publication record of a researcher equally. This full counting scheme is apparently unfair and causes unjust disproportions, in particular, if ranked researchers have distinctly different collaboration profiles. These disproportions are removed by less common fractional or authorship-weighted counting schemes, which can distribute the authorship credit more properly and suppress a tendency to unjustified inflation of co-authors. The urgent need of widely adopting a fair ranking scheme in practise is exemplified by analysing citation profiles of several highly-cited astronomers and astrophysicists. While the full counting scheme often leads to completely incorrect and misleading ranking, the fractional or authorship-weighted schemes are more accurate and applicable to ranking of researchers as well as research teams. In addition, they suppress differences in ranking among scientific disciplines. These more appropriate schemes should urgently be adopted by scientific publication databases as the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) or the Scopus (Elsevier)."
https://openalex.org/W2795921708,"In the present study, we have evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of repeated brain metastases (BM) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS2) following local failure of a prior radiosurgical procedure (SRS1). Between December 1996 and August 2015, 30 patients with 36 BM underwent SRS2 with a median dose of 18Gy. All BM were located outside critical structures. Following SRS2, local control at 6 months and one year were respectively 82.9% (IC 95%: 67.6–91.9) and 67.8% (IC 95%: 51–81). On multivariate analysis, planning target volume (PTV) < 3cc (HR: 0.19 (0.1–0.52)) and whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) prior to SRS2 (HR: 0.25 (0.1–0.64)) were significantly associated with a better local control. One- and two-year overall survival rates after SRS2 were respectively 65.5% (IC 95%: 47.3–80%) and 27.6% (IC 95%: 14.7–45.7). Median overall survival following SRS2 was 14.2 months (range 1–106). Nineteen (63%) patients died from progressive systemic disease. Three (10%) patients died from out-field progressive brain disease and 8 (27%) in-field. Concerning toxicities, edema, radionecrosis, and hemorrhages were identified in 5 (12.8%), 4 (10.2%), and 5 (12.8%) patients respectively. No toxicity resulted in a neurological deficit. On univariate analysis, toxicities were significantly associated with PTV > 7cc (p = 0.02) and all patients had a WBRT before SRS2. A second course of SRS for locally recurrent brain metastases showed encouraging rates of local control. This treatment led to acceptable toxicities, especially for brain metastases smaller than 7cc, in our selected cohort of patients with BM located outside critical structures. Further studies are needed."

In the experiment, feeds with a high or a low AA content were administrated to pigs fed ad-libitum or restrictively according to a 2 × 2 factorial design. Ninety-six barrows were housed in 8 pens (12 pigs/pen) equipped with automatic feeders. Within pen, and from 47 body weight (BW) onwards, 6 pigs were fed ad libitum. The others pigs were allowed to consume, as a maximum, the feed amounts indicated by the breeding company feeding plane to optimize the feed efficiency. In early (86–118 kg BW) and late (118–145 kg BW) finishing, the pigs of 4 pens received feeds with high indispensable AA contents (8.1 and 7.5 g lysine/kg in the two periods, respectively). The other pigs received feeds with reduced indispensable AA contents (lysine, methionine, threonine and tryptophan) by 9 and 18% in early and late finishing, respectively. Body lipid and protein (Pr) retentions were estimated from BW and back-fat depth measures recorded at the beginning and the end of each period. Nitrogen excretion was estimated as actual intake minus estimated N-retention (Pr/6.25). Pigs were slaughtered at 144 kg BW. Restricted feeding decreased feed intake (-7%), daily gain (-5%), carcass weight (-2.6%) and back-fat depth (-8.0%) but increased gain:feed ratio (+2%). The AA restriction increased feed intake (+5.9%), carcass weight (+4.9%) and intramuscular fat (+17.6%), and reduced carcass weight variation (-36%), with no effects on the feed efficiency and the estimated Pr (142 g/d). N excreted was reduced by feed (-9%) and dietary AA (-15%) restrictions. Irrespectively of the feeding level, the pigs responded to a reduction of the dietary essential AA content by increasing their feed intake."

This study was designed to assess the current prevalence of hypertension and to explore risk factors associated with hypertension by urban and rural status to guide the prevention and control of hypertension in Jilin province.A multi-stage stratified random cluster sampling method was used to obtain data on hypertension, which was investigated by physical examination and face-to-face questionnaire in July 2014-December 2015. Sample data were analyzed by complex weighted statistical analysis to estimate blood pressure levels and prevalence of hypertension in the province. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing hypertension rates.The prevalence of hypertension was significantly higher in rural areas than urban areas (25.93% versus 22.73%, respectively). The rates of hypertension known (46.7% versus 38.1%, respectively), control (13.7% versus 5.0%, respectively), and controlled among treated subjects (38.3% versus 17.5%, respectively) were higher in urban areas than in rural areas (all p < 0.001), while the treatment rate was not statistically significantly different between urban and rural areas (35.9% versus 28.4%, respectively). After adjusting for demographic covariates, hypertension prevalence in rural areas was still significantly greater than in urban areas (adjusted OR = 1.22; 95%CI: 1.10, 1.36; p < 0.001). Common risk factors for hypertension among urban and rural residents included older age; male; married; employed; less education; overweight/obese; greater abdominal waist circumference; family history of hypertension, stroke, or coronary heart disease; current smoker; alcohol consumption; higher visceral adiposity index; and higher body fat percentage.This study identified an increased risk for hypertension in rural regions of Jilin province, suggesting that rural hypertension screening and treatment guidelines should receive greater attention."
https://openalex.org/W2795985395,"Evidence from literature is mixed regarding a possible association of maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and overweight in the offspring. Sexual dimorphism, or sex disparities in the pathogenesis linking GDM exposure to overweight, could be at play. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between GDM and child overweight at 5–7 years. Six hundred pairs (1:1) of Reunionese liveborn singletons selected from a hospital-based birth registry, matched for sex, gestational age, and birth period, underwent a prospective in-home follow-up and were analyzed with respect to their exposure to GDM. The primary outcome was child overweight at 5–7 years, as defined by the International Obesity Task Force. The association between GDM exposure and child overweight was estimated by the odds ratio (OR) using conditional logistic regression models. For the subset of children exposed to GDM with available maternal glycemic data, we analyzed the relationship between maternal glycemic levels during pregnancy and child body mass index (BMI) at 5–7 years with a linear regression model. In light of the significant interaction between sex and GDM, all statistical analyses were then stratified by sex. After controlling for pre-pregnancy BMI and maternal sociodemographic characteristics, the risk of overweight increased with exposure to GDM for boys (adjusted OR: 2.34; 95% confidence interval = 1.26–4.34, P = 0.007) but not for girls (adjusted OR: 0.56; 95%CI = 0.28–1.10, P = 0.093). Consistent with this, the linear increase of boys’ BMI at 5–7 years with maternal blood glucose levels during pregnancy, in the exposed group, displayed a dose-response relationship. Our findings indicate that exposure to GDM is a risk factor for childhood overweight in boys but not in girls, which adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting greater sensitivity of male offspring to intrauterine hyperglycemia."

Here we studied the antitumor activity of wild-type Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates from Russian migratory birds. We showed that NDV could selectively kill malignant cells without affecting healthy cells. We evaluated the oncolytic effect of 44 NDV isolates in 4 histogenetically different human cell lines (HCT116, HeLa, A549, MCF7). The safety of the isolates was also tested in normal peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) cells. The viability of tumor cell lines after incubation with NDV isolates was evaluated by MTT. All cell lines, except for normal PBMC primary cells, had different degrees of susceptibility to NDV infection. Seven NDV strains had the highest oncolytic activity, and some NDV strains demonstrated oncolytic selectivity for different cell lines. In vivo, we described the intratumoral activity of NDV/Altai/pigeon/770/2011 against subcutaneous non-small cell lung carcinoma using xenograft SCID mice model. All animals were responsive to therapy. Histology confirmed therapy-induced destructive changes and growing necrotic bulk density in tumor tissue. Our findings indicate that wild-type NDV strains selectively kill tumor cells with no effect on healthy PBMC cells, and intratumoral virotherapy with NDV suppresses the subcutaneous tumor growth in SCID mice."
https://openalex.org/W2796070703,"Wildlife mortality investigations are important for conservation, food safety, and public health; but they are infrequently reported for cryptic chelonian species. Eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina) are declining due to anthropogenic factors and disease, and while mortality investigations have been reported for captive and translocated individuals, few descriptions exist for free-living populations. We report the results of four natural mortality event investigations conducted during routine health surveillance of three Illinois box turtle populations in 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015. In April 2011, over 50 box turtles were found dead and a polymicrobial necrotizing bacterial infection was diagnosed in five survivors using histopathology and aerobic/anaerobic culture. This represents the first reported occurrence of necrotizing bacterial infection in box turtles. In August 2013, paired histopathology and qPCR ranavirus detection in nine turtles was significantly associated with occupation of moist microhabitats, identification of oral plaques and nasal discharge on physical exam, and increases in the heterophil count and heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (p < 0.05). In July 2014 and 2015, ranavirus outbreaks reoccurred within a 0.2km radius of highly-disturbed habitat containing ephemeral ponds used by amphibians for breeding. qPCR ranavirus detection in five individuals each year was significantly associated with use of moist microhabitats (p < 0.05). Detection of single and co-pathogens (Terrapene herpesvirus 1, adenovirus, and Mycoplasma sp.) was common before, during, and after mortality events, but improved sample size would be necessary to determine the impacts of these pathogens on the occurrence and outcome of mortality events. This study provides novel information about the causes and predictors of natural box turtle mortality events. Continued investigation of health, disease, and death in free-living box turtles will improve baseline knowledge of morbidity and mortality, identify threats to survival, and promote the formation of effective conservation strategies."

This study aims to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) patients with regard to their plasma complement levels at diagnosis. A retrospective monocentric study carried out at Caen University Hospital led to the identification of proteinase-3- or myeloperoxidase-ANCA-positive GPA and MPA patients from January 2000 to June 2016 and from September 2011 to June 2016, respectively. All patients with available C3 and C4 levels at diagnosis were included. Patients were categorized in the hypocomplementemia group if their C3 and/or C4 levels at diagnosis were below the lower limit of the normal range. Among the 76 AAV patients (43 GPA, 33 MPA), 4 (5%) had hypocomplementemia, and the 72 remaining patients exhibited normal plasma complement levels. All 4 hypocomplementemia patients had renal involvement. Hypocomplementemia was followed in 1 patient whose post-treatment complement level normalized within 1 month. Among all clinical and ANCA specificity, including relapse-free survival (p = 0.093), only overall and renal survival rates were significantly lower in the hypocomplementemia group (p = 0.0011 and p<0.001, respectively). Hypocomplementemia with low C3 and/or C4 levels at GPA or MPA diagnosis may be responsible for worse survival and renal prognosis. These results argue for larger and prospective studies to better determine the epidemiology of the disease and to assess complement-targeting therapy in these patients."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in muscle activation and metabolic responses between NW, performed with the technique suggested by NW instructors, and with some modifications in the way to move upper limb and poles. Ten NW instructors volunteered to walk on a treadmill at 5.5 km•h-1 in five conditions: walking (W), Nordic walking (NW), NW with a weak poling action (NWweak), with straight-upper limbs moving the shoulders (NWshoulder) and with elbow flexion-extension pattern and shoulder freezed (NWelbow). Poling forces, body segments and poles movement, upper and lower body muscle activation, as well as metabolic parameters were measured.All modified NW techniques elicited lower muscular activation and metabolic responses with respect to the suggested NW technique (P < 0.05). All NW techniques elicited higher muscular activation and metabolic responses than W. All parameters observed with the NWweak were lower than NW. A decreased activation of shoulder extensor muscles and increased activation of anterior deltoid muscle were the main features of NWshoulder. Lower triceps brachii muscle activation and reduced propulsive poling action with respect to NW were seen for NWelbow, resulting also in shorter steps.Nordic walking instructors, sport technicians and practitioners should be aware that any deviation from the technique usually suggested might lead to lower benefits. However it is worth to note that any walking technique with poles elicits higher metabolic responses and muscular activation than walking."
https://openalex.org/W2796324448,"Mammalian carnivores can be particularly sensitive to human disturbance, even within protected areas (PAs). Our objective was to understand how human disturbance affects carnivore communities in southern Arizona, USA by studying habitat occupancy based on data collected using non-invasive methods in three PAs with different levels of human disturbance. Carnivore occupancy varied based on human disturbance variables (i.e., roads, trails, etc.). Common carnivore species (coyotes, gray foxes, and bobcats) had high occupancy probability in highly disturbed sites, while all other carnivore species had a higher probability of occupancy in low disturbance protected areas. Additionally, overall carnivore diversity was higher in PAs with low human disturbance. Edges of PAs appeared to negatively impact occupancy of nearly all carnivore species. We also found the presence of roads and trails, and not necessarily how much they are used, had a significant negative impact on the occupancy of most carnivore species. Furthermore, the overall level of disturbance within a PA influenced how sensitive carnivores were to human disturbance variables. Carnivores were more sensitive in PAs with higher levels of disturbance and were relatively unaffected by disturbance variables in a PA with low base levels of disturbance. Increased visitation to PAs, expected with the region's high level of population growth, is likely to cause shifts in the carnivore communities favoring species that are less sensitive to disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W2795657741,"Haploid laboratory strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are commonly used for genetic engineering to enable their xylose utilization but little is known about the industrial yeast which is often recognized as diploid and as well as haploid and tetraploid. Here we report three unique signature pathway expression patterns and gene interactions in the centre metabolic pathways that signify xylose utilization of genetically engineered industrial yeast S. cerevisiae NRRL Y-50463, a diploid yeast. Quantitative expression analysis revealed outstanding high levels of constitutive expression of YXI, a synthesized yeast codon-optimized xylose isomerase gene integrated into chromosome XV of strain Y-50463. Comparative expression analysis indicated that the YXI was necessary to initiate the xylose metabolic pathway along with a set of heterologous xylose transporter and utilization facilitating genes including XUT4, XUT6, XKS1 and XYL2. The highly activated transketolase and transaldolase genes TKL1, TKL2, TAL1 and NQM1 as well as their complex interactions in the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway branch were critical for the serial of sugar transformation to drive the metabolic flow into glycolysis for increased ethanol production. The significantly increased expression of the entire PRS gene family facilitates functions of the life cycle and biosynthesis superpathway for the yeast. The outstanding higher levels of constitutive expression of YXI and the first insight into the signature pathway expression and the gene interactions in the closely related centre metabolic pathways from the industrial yeast aid continued efforts for development of the next-generation biocatalyst. Our results further suggest the industrial yeast is a desirable delivery vehicle for new strain development for efficient lignocellulose-to-advanced biofuels production."

We sampled waterfowl and gulls for IAVs at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in western Alaska, USA, during late summer and autumn months of 2011-2015, to evaluate the abundance and diversity of viruses at this site. We collected 4842 samples across five years from 25 species of wild birds resulting in the recovery, isolation, and sequencing of 172 IAVs. With the intent of optimizing sampling efficiencies, we used information derived from this multi-year effort to: 1) evaluate from which species we consistently recover viruses, 2) describe viral subtypes of isolates by host species and year, 3) characterize viral gene segment sequence diversity with respect to host species, and assess potential differences in the viral lineages among the host groups, and 4) examine how evidence of intercontinental exchange of IAVs relates to host species. We consistently recovered viruses from dabbling ducks (Anas spp.), emperor geese (Chen canagica) and glaucous-winged gulls (Larus glaucescens). There was little evidence for differences in viral subtypes and diversity from different waterfowl hosts, however subtypes and viral diversity varied between waterfowl host groups and glaucous-winged gulls. Furthermore, higher proportions of viral sequences from northern pintails (Anas acuta), emperor geese and glaucous-winged gulls were grouped in phylogenetic clades that included IAV sequences originating from wild birds sampled in Asia as compared to non-pintail dabbling ducks, a difference that may be related to intercontinental migratory tendencies of host species. Our summary of research and surveillance efforts at Izembek NWR will assist in future prioritization of which hosts to sample and swab types to collect in Alaska and elsewhere in order to maximize isolate recovery, subtype and sequence diversity for resultant viruses, and detection of evidence for intercontinental viral exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2795788653,"Damaged cartilage has very low regenerative potential which has led to the search for novel tissue-engineering approaches to help treat cartilage defects. While various approaches have been reported, there is no perfect treatment currently. In this study we evaluated the effects of a plant extract, chlorogenic acid (CGA), as part of chondrocyte transplantation on a model of knee joint injury in chicks. First, primary cultured chondrocytes used to evaluate the effects of CGA on chondrogenesis. Then using an articular cartilage injury model of chick knee we assessed the functional recovery after transplantation of the complexes containing chondrocytes and CGA in an alginate scaffold. Histological analysis, PCR, and western blot were further used to understand the underlying mechanisms. We showed that 60 μM CGA in alginate exhibited notable effects on stimulating chondrogenesis in vitro. Secondly, it was shown that the application of these complexes accelerated the recovery of injury-induced dysfunction by gait analysis when followed for 21 days. Histochemical analysis demonstrated that there was less abnormal vasculature formation, more chondrocyte proliferation and cartilage matrix synthesis in the presence of the complexes containing CGA. We discovered CGA treated transplantation up-regulated the expressions of Sox9 and Col2a1 which were responsible for the stimulation of chondrogenesis. Furthermore, the application of these complexes could suppress the abnormal angiogenesis and fibrosis at the injury site. Lastly, the elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, p-p65, and MMPs expression were decreased in the presence of CGA. This may be caused through adjusting cellular redox homeostasis associated with Nrf2. This study suggests that combining chondrocytes and CGA on an alginate scaffold can improve the recovery of damaged articular cartilage."

Sequence alignment indicated that GhGLIP includes four enzyme catalytic amino acid residue sites of Ser (S), Gly (G), Asn (N) and His (H), located in four conserved blocks. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that GhGLIP belongs to the typical class IV lipase family with potential functions in plant secondary metabolism. Subcellular distribution analysis demonstrated that GhGLIP localized to the nucleus, cytoplasm and plasma membrane. GhGLIP was expressed predominantly at 5-15 day post anthesis (dpa) in developing ovules and elongating fibers, measured as mRNA levels and enzyme activity. Ectopic overexpression of GhGLIP in Arabidopsis plants resulted in enhanced seed development, including length and fresh weight. Meanwhile, there was increased soluble sugar and protein storage in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, coupled with the promotion of lipase activity. Moreover, the expression of cotton GhGLIP is induced by ethylene (ETH) treatment in vitro. A 1,954-bp GhGLIP promoter was isolated and expressed high activity in driving green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression in tobacco leaves. Cis-acting element analysis of the GhGLIP promoter (pGhGLIP) indicated the presence of an ethylene-responsive element (ERE), and transgenic tobacco leaves with ectopic expression of pGhGLIP::GFP-GUS showed increased GUS activity after ETH treatment. In summary, these results suggest that GhGLIP is a functional enzyme involved in ovule and fiber development and performs significant roles in seed development."
https://openalex.org/W2796344327,"Background Musculoskeletal complaints and injuries (MSCI) are common in military populations. However, only a limited number of studies have followed soldiers during international deployments and investigated the prevalence of MSCI during and at the end of their deployment. The aim was to describe the prevalence of MSCI in different military occupational specialties and categorise their most common tasks in terms of exposures to physical workloads during a six-month long international deployment in Afghanistan. Methods Cross-sectional survey, including 325 soldiers (300 men), aged 20–62 participating in an international deployment in Afghanistan during the spring of 2012. Soldiers were clustered into different military occupational specialties: Infantry, Administration, Logistics, Logistics/Camp, Medical and Other. Data were collected through the use of the Musculoskeletal Screening Protocol at the end of the international mission. Results Forty-seven percent reported MSCI during deployment, with 28% at the end. The most common locations of MSCI during the mission were lower back, knee, shoulders, upper back, neck and foot, while the knee and lower back prevailed at the end of the mission. Almost half of the soldiers who had MSCI reported affected work ability. The most common duties during the mission were vehicle patrolling, staff duties, guard/security duties, foot patrols and transportation. Soldiers reported that vehicle patrolling, staff duties and transportation were demanding with respect to endurance strength, guard/security duties challenged both maximum and endurance strength while foot patrolling challenged maximum and endurance strength, aerobic and anaerobic endurance and speed. Conclusions MSCI during international deployment are common among Swedish soldiers. The results indicate the need to further develop strategies focusing on matching the soldiers’ capacity to the job requirements, with relevant and fair physical selection-tests during the recruitment process and proactive interventions targeting MSCI before and during deployment, in order to enhance soldiers’ readiness and promote operational readiness."
https://openalex.org/W2796462976,"Background Cochrane reviewers are strongly encouraged to evaluate the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes by using the GRADE approach and to report these results in a Summary of Findings (SoF) table. We aimed to assess whether outcomes reported in the SoF table of Cochrane reviews could be considered patient-important outcomes (PIOs) and the quality of the available evidence for these outcomes. Methods We performed a methodological review of Cochrane reviews published between March 2011 and September 2014. For a random sample of Cochrane reviews reporting a SoF table, we extracted all outcomes reported in this table and evaluated whether they could be considered PIOs (i.e., mortality, other clinical events, adverse events, function, pain, quality of life and therapeutic decisions). Then, we collected the quality of evidence for every outcome in these SoF tables. Results We included 290 reviews issued by 47 of the 53 Cochrane Review Groups. Every SoF table included a median of 5 outcomes, for a total of 1414 outcomes; 1089 (77%) could be considered PIOs. Almost all reviews (n = 278, 96%) included at least one PIO in their SoF table. The quality of evidence for the outcomes was high for 12% (n = 168), moderate for 28% (n = 402) and low or very low for 45% (n = 640). Less than one quarter of reviews (n = 63) included at least one PIO with high-quality evidence that favoured a benefit of the experimental intervention evaluated in half of them (n = 34 reviews). Conclusions Many outcomes reported in the SoF table of recent Cochrane reviews can be considered PIOs. However, the quality of available evidence remains limited for these outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2951179468,"DNA methylation is mediated by a conserved family of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts). The human genome encodes three active Dnmts (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b), the tRNA methyltransferase Dnmt2, and the regulatory protein Dnmt3L. Despite their high degree of conservation among different species, genes encoding Dnmts have been duplicated and/or lost in multiple lineages throughout evolution, indicating that the DNA methylation machinery has some potential to undergo evolutionary change. However, little is known about the extent to which this machinery, or the methylome, varies among vertebrates. Here, we study the molecular evolution of Dnmt1, the enzyme responsible for maintenance of DNA methylation patterns after replication, in 79 vertebrate species. Our analyses show that all studied species exhibit a single copy of the DNMT1 gene, with the exception of tilapia and marsupials (tammar wallaby, koala, Tasmanian devil and opossum), each of which displays two apparently functional DNMT1 copies. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that DNMT1 duplicated before the radiation of major marsupial groups (i.e., at least ~75 million years ago), thus giving rise to two DNMT1 copies in marsupials (copy 1 and copy 2). In the opossum lineage, copy 2 was lost, and copy 1 recently duplicated again, generating three DNMT1 copies: two putatively functional genes (copy 1a and 1b) and one pseudogene (copy 1ψ). Both marsupial copies (DNMT1 copies 1 and 2) are under purifying selection, and copy 2 exhibits elevated rates of evolution and signatures of positive selection, suggesting a scenario of neofunctionalization. This gene duplication might have resulted in modifications in marsupial methylomes and their dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2796388502,"The morphology of an animal’s face will have large effects on the sensory information it can acquire. Here we quantify the arrangement of cranial sensory structures of the rat, with special emphasis on the mystacial vibrissae (whiskers). Nearly all mammals have vibrissae, which are generally arranged in rows and columns across the face. The vibrissae serve a wide variety of important behavioral functions, including navigation, climbing, wake following, anemotaxis, and social interactions. To date, however, there are few studies that compare the morphology of vibrissal arrays across species, or that describe the arrangement of the vibrissae relative to other facial sensory structures. The few studies that do exist have exploited the whiskers’ grid-like arrangement to quantify array morphology in terms of row and column identity. However, relying on whisker identity poses a challenge for comparative research because different species have different numbers and arrangements of whiskers. The present work introduces an approach to quantify vibrissal array morphology regardless of the number of rows and columns, and to quantify the array’s location relative to other sensory structures. We use the three-dimensional locations of the whisker basepoints as fundamental parameters to generate equations describing the length, curvature, and orientation of each whisker. Results show that in the rat, whisker length varies exponentially across the array, and that a hard limit on intrinsic curvature constrains the whisker height-to-length ratio. Whiskers are oriented to “fan out” approximately equally in dorsal-ventral and rostral-caudal directions. Quantifying positions of the other sensory structures relative to the whisker basepoints shows remarkable alignment to the somatosensory cortical homunculus, an alignment that would not occur for other choices of coordinate systems (e.g., centered on the midpoint of the eyes). We anticipate that the quantification of facial sensory structures, including the vibrissae, will ultimately enable cross-species comparisons of multi-modal sensing volumes."
https://openalex.org/W2795967149,"Adapting community-based protected areas to local context and evaluating their success across a range of possible socio-economic and ecological outcomes depends, in part, on understanding the perceptions of local actors. This article presents results from a mixed methods study that focuses on how and why religious identity, a prominent aspect of Ghanaian culture, is related to perceptions of the performance of several Community Resource Management Areas (CREMAs). CREMAs are a form of Ghanaian protected area that emphasizes community participation and a range of socio-economic and ecological objectives. Using importance-satisfaction analysis, large-scale survey results show that respondents that identify as Christians consistently assign greater importance to CREMA outcomes than do those that identify with Traditional religions. Education and whether respondents were native to an area (both of which were correlated with religious identity) were also systematically related to perceptions of CREMA importance, with those that are educated and non-native to an area tending to assign higher importance to CREMA outcomes. Follow up focus group participants from the Avu Lagoon CREMA suggest that the patterns result from differing ‘openness’ to new ideas, relative dependence on natural resources, acceptance of Traditional practices associated with conservation, and a sense, for some, that ecological conditions are divinely ordained. Christianity, education and non-nativity are associated with much larger performance gaps, particularly with respect to socio-economic impacts. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications for conservation interventions and the use of perceptions in assessing protected area performance."
https://openalex.org/W2796207222,"There is still no consensus on the true origin of fatal yellowing, one of the most important diseases affecting oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) plantations. This study involved two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (2D-UPLC-MSE) analyses to identify changes in protein profiles of oil palms affected by FY disease. Oil palm roots were sampled from two growing areas. Differential accumulation of proteins was assessed by comparing plants with and without symptoms and between plants at different stages of FY development. Most of the proteins identified with differential accumulation were those related to stress response and energy metabolism. The latter proteins include the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, related to alcohol fermentation, which were identified in plants with and without symptoms. The presence of these enzymes suggests an anaerobic condition before or during FY. Transketolase, isoflavone reductase, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase, S-adenosylmethionine synthase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and ferritin, among others, were identified as potential marker proteins and could be used to guide selection of FY-tolerant oil palm genotypes or to understand the source of this anomaly. When comparing different stages of FY, we observed high accumulation of alcohol dehydrogenase and other abiotic stress related-proteins at all disease stages. On the other hand, biological stress-related proteins were more accumulated at later stages of the disease. These results suggest that changes in abiotic factors can trigger FY development, creating conditions for the establishment of opportunistic pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2795996943,"Background In urban Maharashtra, India, approximately half of mothers exclusively breastfeed. For children residing in informal settlements of Mumbai, this study examines factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding, and whether exclusive breastfeeding, in a community-based nutrition program to prevent and treat wasting among children under age three, is associated with enrolment during the mother’s pregnancy. Methods The nutrition program conducted a cross-sectional endline survey (October-December 2015) of caregivers in intervention areas. Factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding for infants under six months of age were explored using multi-level logistic regressions. Additionally, program surveillance data collected during home-based counselling visits documented breastfeeding practices for children under six months of age. Using the surveillance data (January 2014-March 2016), exclusive breastfeeding status was regressed adjusting for child, maternal and socioeconomic characteristics, and whether the child was enrolled in the program in utero or after birth. Results The community-based endline survey included 888 mothers of infants. Mothers who received the nutrition program home visits or attended group counselling sessions were more likely to exclusively breastfeed (adjusted odds ratio 1.67, 95% CI 1.16, 2.41). Having a normal weight-for-height z-score (adjusted odds ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.00, 2.45) was associated positively with exclusive breastfeeding. As expected, being an older infant aged three to five months (adjusted odds ratio 0.34, 95% CI 0.25, 0.48) and receiving a prelacteal feed after birth (adjusted odds ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.41, 0.80) were associated with lower odds of exclusively breastfeeding. Surveillance data (N = 3420) indicate that infants enrolled in utero have significantly higher odds of being exclusively breastfed (adjusted odds ratio 1.55, 95% CI 1.30, 1.84) than infants enrolled after birth. Conclusions Prenatal enrolment in community-based programs working on child nutrition in urban informal settlements of India can improve exclusive breastfeeding practices."
https://openalex.org/W2796427095,"For CyberKnife-mediated prostate cancer treatment, a tumour-tracking approach is applied to correct the target location by acquiring X-ray images of implanted fiducial markers intermittently. This study investigated the dosimetric impact of intra-fraction prostate motion during CyberKnife treatment. We retrospectively analyzed 16 patients treated using the CyberKnife (35 Gy delivered in five fractions). Using log files of recorded prostate motion, the intra-fraction prostate motion was simulated. We defined the worst-case intra-fraction prostate motion as the difference between pre- and post-deviation on log files and shifted structure sets according to the corresponding offsets for each beam. The dose–volume indices were calculated and compared with the original plan in terms of clinical target volume (CTV), planning target volume (CTV plus a 2-mm margin), rectum, bladder, and urethra. Prostate motions of >3, >5, and >10 mm were observed for 31.3, 9.1, and 0.5% of the 1929 timestamps, respectively. Relative differences between the simulated and original plans were mostly less than 1%. Although significant decreases were observed in D50% and D98% of the target, absolute dose differences were <0.1 Gy compared with the planned dose. The dosimetric impact of intra-fraction prostate motion may be small even with longer treatment durations, indicating that the tumour tracking using the CyberKnife could be a robust system for examining prostate motion."
https://openalex.org/W2796247633,"Fossils entombed in amber are a unique resource for reconstructing forest ecosystems, and resolving relationships of modern taxa. Such fossils are famous for their perfect, life-like appearance. However, preservation quality is vast with many sites showing only cuticular preservation, or no fossils. The taphonomic processes that control this range are largely unknown; as such, we know little about potential bias in this important record. Here we employ actualistic experiments, using, fruit flies and modern tree resin to determine whether resin type, gut microbiota, and dehydration prior to entombment affects decay. We used solid phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME GC-MS) to confirm distinct tree resin chemistry; gut microbiota of flies was modified using antibiotics and categorized though sequencing. Decay was assessed using phase contrast synchrotron tomography. Resin type demonstrates a significant control on decay rate. The composition of the gut microbiota was also influential, with minor changes in composition affecting decay rate. Dehydration prior to entombment, contrary to expectations, enhanced decay. Our analyses show that there is potential significant bias in the amber fossil record, especially between sites with different resin types where ecological completeness and preservational fidelity are likely affected."
https://openalex.org/W2795850649,"RsbW, an anti-sigma factor possessing kinase activity, is expressed by many Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus. To obtain clues about the domain structure and the folding-unfolding mechanism of RsbW, we have elaborately studied rRsbW, a recombinant S. aureus RsbW. Sequence analysis of the protein fragments, generated by the limited proteolysis of rRsbW, has proposed it to be a single-domain protein. The unfolding of rRsbW in the presence of GdnCl or urea was completely reversible in nature and occurred through the formation of at least two intermediates. The structure, shape, and the surface hydrophobicity of no intermediate completely matches with those of other intermediates or the native rRsbW. Interestingly, one of the intermediates, formed in the presence of less GdnCl concentrations, has a molten globule-like structure. Conversely, all of the intermediates, like native rRsbW, exist as dimers in aqueous solution. The putative molten globule and the urea-generated intermediates also have retained some kinase activity. Additionally, the putative ATP binding site/catalytic site of rRsbW shows higher denaturant sensitivity than the tentative dimerization region of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2795698364,"Every day we make choices under uncertainty; choosing what route to work or which queue in a supermarket to take, for example. It is unclear how outcome variance, e.g. uncertainty about waiting time in a queue, affects decisions and confidence when outcome is stochastic and continuous. How does one evaluate and choose between an option with unreliable but high expected reward, and an option with more certain but lower expected reward? Here we used an experimental design where two choices’ payoffs took continuous values, to examine the effect of outcome variance on decision and confidence. We found that our participants’ probability of choosing the good (high expected reward) option decreased when the good or the bad options’ payoffs were more variable. Their confidence ratings were affected by outcome variability, but only when choosing the good option. Unlike perceptual detection tasks, confidence ratings correlated only weakly with decisions’ time, but correlated with the consistency of trial-by-trial choices. Inspired by the satisficing heuristic, we propose a “stochastic satisficing” (SSAT) model for evaluating options with continuous uncertain outcomes. In this model, options are evaluated by their probability of exceeding an acceptability threshold, and confidence reports scale with the chosen option’s thus-defined satisficing probability. Participants’ decisions were best explained by an expected reward model, while the SSAT model provided the best prediction of decision confidence. We further tested and verified the predictions of this model in a second experiment. Our model and experimental results generalize the models of metacognition from perceptual detection tasks to continuous-value based decisions. Finally, we discuss how the stochastic satisficing account of decision confidence serves psychological and social purposes associated with the evaluation, communication and justification of decision-making."

The species were Ophisurus macrorhynchos and Echelus uropterus belonging to the Ophichthidae, and Ariosoma majus and Gnathophis heterognathos belonging to the Congridae. The eggs were identified using three molecular genetic markers (mitochondrial 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1), sequences obtained from local adult specimens, and geographical distribution data. All eggs were in the early or middle developmental stages. For all species except A. majus, the eggs were found near the range of small leptocephali in the East China Sea and the southern Korean Peninsula, which indicates these species had spawned along the continental near these areas during the summer."
https://openalex.org/W2795446547,"We aimed to determine the effects of levodopa medication on the performance of a repetitive pointing task while standing, and to investigate the optimal trial duration in individuals with Parkinson’s disease, and older adults. Seventeen individuals with Parkinson’s disease (5 freezers) and 9 older adults stood on force platforms for 30 s and 120 s while performing a bilateral repetitive pointing task, tracked by motion capture. Participants with Parkinson’s disease were assessed on and off medication and older adults were also assessed on separate days. The main findings were that: 1) on medication, participants with Parkinson’s exhibited greater center of pressure root mean square in the medial-lateral direction, greater velocity in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions, and greater range in the medial-lateral direction than off medication; 2) longer trial durations resulted in greater center of pressure range in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions and greater coefficient of variation in finger pointing on the least affected side; 3) Parkinson’s participants exhibited larger range in the medial-lateral direction compared to older adults; 4) off medication, freezers presented with less range and root mean square in the anterior-posterior direction than non-freezers; and 5) a correlation emerged between the freezing of gait questionnaire and pointing asymmetry and the coefficient of variation of pointing on the most affected side. Therefore, Parkinson’s medication may increase instability during a repetitive pointing task. Longer trials may provide a better depiction of sway by discriminating between those with and without neurological impairment. Individuals with Parkinson’s were less stable than older adults, supporting that they are at a greater risk for falls. The greater restrictive postural strategy in freezers compared to non-freezers is likely a factor that augments fall-risk. Lastly, the link between freezing of gait and upper-limb movement indicates that freezing may manifest first in the lower-limbs."
https://openalex.org/W2795613215,"There are two main types of strategies to identify target population for lung cancer screening: 1) strategies based on age and cumulative smoking criteria, 2) risk prediction models allowing the calculation of an individual risk. The objective of this study was to compare different strategies to identify the proportion of the Spanish population at high risk of developing lung cancer, susceptible to be included in a lung cancer screening programme.Cross-sectional study. We used the data of the Spanish National Interview Health Survey (ENSE) of 2011-2012 (21,006 individuals) to estimate the proportion of participants at high risk of developing lung cancer. This estimation was performed using the U.S. national lung screening trial (NLST) criteria and a 6-year prediction model (PLCOm2012), both independently and in combination.The prevalence of individuals at high risk of developing lung cancer according to the NLST criteria was 4.9% (7.9% for men, 2.4% for women). Among the 1,034 subjects who met the NLST criteria, 533 (427 men and 106 women) had a 6-year lung cancer risk ≥2.0%. The combination of these two selection strategies showed that 2.5% of the Spanish population had a high risk of developing lung cancer. However, this selection process did not take into account different groups of subjects <75 years old having an individual risk of lung cancer ≥2%, such as heavy smokers <55 years old who were long-time former smokers, and ever-smokers having smoked <30 pack-years with other risk factors.Further research is needed to determine which selection strategy achieves a higher benefit/harm ratio and to assess other prevention strategies for individuals with elevated risk for lung cancer but who do not meet the screening eligibility criteria."
https://openalex.org/W2796342251,"Systematic conservation planning is a framework for optimally locating and prioritizing areas for conservation. An often-noted shortcoming of most conservation planning studies is that they do not address future uncertainty. The selection of protected areas that are intended to ensure the long-term persistence of biodiversity is often based on a snapshot of the current situation, ignoring processes such as climate change. Scenarios, in the sense of being accounts of plausible futures, can be utilized to identify conservation area portfolios that are robust to future uncertainty. We compared three approaches for utilizing scenarios in conservation area selection: considering a full set of scenarios (all-scenarios portfolio), assuming the realization of specific scenarios, and a reference strategy based on the current situation (current distributions portfolio). Our objective was to compare the robustness of these approaches in terms of their relative performance across future scenarios. We focused on breeding bird species in Israel's Mediterranean region. We simulated urban development and vegetation dynamics scenarios 60 years into the future using DINAMICA-EGO, a cellular-automata simulation model. For each scenario, we mapped the target species' available habitat distribution, identified conservation priority areas using the site-selection software MARXAN, and constructed conservation area portfolios using the three aforementioned strategies. We then assessed portfolio performance based on the number of species for which representation targets were met in each scenario. The all-scenarios portfolio consistently outperformed the other portfolios, and was more robust to 'errors' (e.g., when an assumed specific scenario did not occur). On average, the all-scenarios portfolio achieved representation targets for five additional species compared with the current distributions portfolio (approximately 33 versus 28 species). Our findings highlight the importance of considering a broad and meaningful set of scenarios, rather than relying on the current situation, the expected occurrence of specific scenarios, or the worst-case scenario."

https://openalex.org/W2795636752,"Antithyroid drugs are generally selected as the first-line treatment for Graves’ Disease (GD); however, the existence of patients showing resistance or severe side effects to these drugs is an important issue to be solved. The (pro)renin receptor [(P)RR] is a multi-functional protein that activates the tissue renin-angiotensin system and is an essential constituent of vacuolar H+-ATPase, necessary for the autophagy-lysosome pathway. (P)RR is cleaved to soluble (s)(P)RR, which reflects the status of (P)RR expression. In this retrospective study, we aimed to investigate whether serum s(P)RR concentration can be used as a biomarker to predict the outcome of antithyroid drug treatment in GD patients. Serum s(P)RR levels were measured in 54 untreated GD patients and 47 control participants. Effects of medical treatment with antithyroid drugs on these levels were investigated in GD patients. Serum s(P)RR levels were significantly higher in patients with Graves’ disease than in control subjects (P<0.005) and were significantly reduced after medical treatment for Graves’ disease. High serum s(P)RR levels were associated with resistance to antithyroid drug treatment, suggesting that serum s(P)RR concentration can be used as a useful biomarker to predict the outcome of antithyroid drug treatment in these patients. Patients with Graves’ disease with low body mass index showed higher levels of serum soluble (pro)renin receptor levels than those with high body mass index. In addition, in patients with Graves’ disease, serum triglyceride levels were negatively correlated with serum soluble (pro)renin receptor levels. All these data indicated an association between low nutrient condition due to hyperthyroidism and increased (pro)renin receptor expression in these patients, suggesting that (pro)renin receptor expression could be increased in the process of stimulating intracellular energy production via activating autophagy function to compensate energy loss."
https://openalex.org/W2795840255,"Anti-predator signaling is highly variable with numerous examples of species employing cryptic coloration to avoid detection or conspicuous coloration (often coupled with a secondary defense) to ensure detection and recollection. While the ends of this spectrum are clear in their function, how species use intermediate signals is less clear. Australian Brood Frogs (Pseudophryne) display conspicuous coloration on both their dorsum and venter. Coupled with the alkaloid toxins these frogs possess, this coloration may be aposematic, providing a protective warning signal to predators. We assessed predation rates of known and novel color patterns and found no difference for avian or mammalian predators. However, when Pseudophryne dorsal phenotypes were collectively compared to the high-contrast ventral phenotype of this genus, we found birds, but not mammals, attacked dorsal phenotypes significantly less frequently than the ventral phenotype. This study, importantly, shows a differential predator response to ventral coloration in this genus which has implications for the evolution of conspicuous signaling in Pseudophryne."
https://openalex.org/W2795876439,"The present study evaluated auditory sensitivity to spectral modulation by determining the modulation depth required to detect modulation phase reversal. This approach may be preferable to spectral modulation detection with a spectrally flat standard, since listeners appear unable to perform the task based on the detection of temporal modulation. While phase reversal thresholds are often evaluated by holding modulation depth constant and adjusting modulation rate, holding rate constant and adjusting modulation depth supports rate-specific assessment of modulation processing. Stimuli were pink noise samples, filtered into seven octave-wide bands (0.125-8 kHz) and spectrally modulated in dB. Experiment 1 measured performance as a function of modulation depth to determine appropriate units for adaptive threshold estimation. Experiment 2 compared thresholds in dB for modulation detection with a flat standard and modulation phase reversal; results supported the idea that temporal cues were available at high rates for the former but not the latter. Experiment 3 evaluated spectral modulation phase reversal thresholds for modulation that was restricted to either one or two neighboring bands. Flanking bands of unmodulated noise had a larger detrimental effect on one-band than two-band targets. Thresholds for high-rate modulation improved with increasing carrier frequency up to 2 kHz, whereas low-rate modulation appeared more consistent across frequency, particularly in the two-band condition. Experiment 4 measured spectral weights for spectral modulation phase reversal detection and found higher weights for bands in the spectral center of the stimulus than for the lowest (0.125 kHz) or highest (8 kHz) band. Experiment 5 compared performance for highly practiced and relatively naïve listeners, and found weak evidence of a larger practice effect at high than low spectral modulation rates. These results provide preliminary data for a task that may provide a better estimate of sensitivity to spectral modulation than spectral modulation detection with a flat standard."

https://openalex.org/W2795939284,"We investigate the influence of the visual appearance of a negotiator on persuasiveness within the context of negotiations. Psychological experiments were conducted to quantitatively analyze the relationship between visual appearance and the use of language. Male and female participants were shown three female and male photographs, respectively. They were asked to report how they felt about each photograph using a seven-point semantic differential (SD) scale for six affective factors (positive impression, extraversion, intelligence, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and agreeableness). Participants then answered how they felt about each negotiation scenario (they were presented with pictures and a situation combined with negotiation sentences) using a seven-point SD scale for seven affective factors (positive impression, extraversion, intelligence, conscientiousness, emotional stability, agreeableness, and degree of persuasion). Two experiments were conducted using different participant groups depending on the negotiation situations. Photographs with good or bad appearances were found to show high or low degrees of persuasion, respectively. A multiple regression equation was obtained, indicating the importance of the three language factors (euphemistic, honorific, and sympathy expressions) to impressions made during negotiation. The result shows that there are optimal negotiation sentences based on various negotiation factors, such as visual appearance and use of language. For example, persons with good appearance might worsen their impression during negotiations by using certain language, although their initial impression was positive, and persons with bad appearance could effectively improve their impressions in negotiations through their use of language, although the final impressions of their negotiation counterpart might still be more negative than those for persons with good appearance. In contrast, the impressions made by persons of normal appearance were not easily affected by their use of language. The results of the present study have significant implications for future studies of effective negotiation strategies considering visual appearance as well as gender."
