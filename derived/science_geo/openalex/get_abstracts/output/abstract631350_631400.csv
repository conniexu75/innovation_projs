https://openalex.org/W2939661038,"CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat) systems have been broadly adopted for basic science, biotechnology, and gene and cell therapy. In some cases, these bacterial nucleases have demonstrated off-target activity. This creates a potential hazard for therapeutic applications and could confound results in biological research. Therefore, improving the precision of these nucleases is of broad interest. Here we show that engineering a hairpin secondary structure onto the spacer region of single guide RNAs (hp-sgRNAs) can increase specificity by several orders of magnitude when combined with various CRISPR effectors. We first demonstrate that designed hp-sgRNAs can tune the activity of a transactivator based on Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9). We then show that hp-sgRNAs increase the specificity of gene editing using five different Cas9 or Cas12a variants. Our results demonstrate that RNA secondary structure is a fundamental parameter that can tune the activity of diverse CRISPR systems."
https://openalex.org/W2938395488,"How disseminated tumour cells engage specific stromal components in distant organs for survival and outgrowth is a critical but poorly understood step of the metastatic cascade. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in promoting the cancer stem cell properties needed for metastasis initiation, whereas the reverse process of mesenchymal-epithelial transition is required for metastatic outgrowth. Here we report that this paradoxical requirement for the simultaneous induction of both mesenchymal-epithelial transition and cancer stem cell traits in disseminated tumour cells is provided by bone vascular niche E-selectin, whose direct binding to cancer cells promotes bone metastasis by inducing mesenchymal-epithelial transition and activating Wnt signalling. E-selectin binding activity mediated by the α1-3 fucosyltransferases Fut3/Fut6 and Glg1 are instrumental to the formation of bone metastasis. These findings provide unique insights into the functional role of E-selectin as a component of the vascular niche critical for metastatic colonization in bone."
https://openalex.org/W2937157703,"Mitochondrial fission involves the preconstriction of an organelle followed by scission by dynamin-related protein Drp1. Preconstriction is facilitated by actin and non-muscle myosin II through a mechanism that remains unclear, largely due to the unknown cytoskeletal ultrastructure at mitochondrial constrictions. Here, using platinum replica electron microscopy, we show that mitochondria in cells are embedded in an interstitial cytoskeletal network that contains abundant unbranched actin filaments. Both spontaneous and induced mitochondrial constrictions typically associate with a criss-cross array of long actin filaments that comprise part of this interstitial network. Non-muscle myosin II is found adjacent to mitochondria but is not specifically enriched at the constriction sites. During ionomycin-induced mitochondrial fission, F-actin clouds colocalize with mitochondrial constriction sites, whereas dynamic myosin II clouds are present in the vicinity of constrictions. We propose that myosin II promotes mitochondrial constriction by inducing stochastic deformations of the interstitial actin network, which applies pressure on the mitochondrial surface and thus initiates curvature-sensing mechanisms that complete mitochondrial constriction."
https://openalex.org/W2937317283,"Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are maintained by bone marrow niches in vivo1,2, but the ability of niche cells to maintain HSCs ex vivo is markedly diminished. Expression of niche factors by Nestin-GFP+ mesenchymal-derived stromal cells (MSCs) is downregulated upon culture, suggesting that transcriptional rewiring may contribute to this reduced HSC maintenance potential. Using an RNA sequencing screen, we identified five genes encoding transcription factors (Klf7, Ostf1, Xbp1, Irf3 and Irf7) that restored HSC niche function in cultured bone marrow-derived MSCs. These revitalized MSCs (rMSCs) exhibited enhanced synthesis of HSC niche factors while retaining their mesenchymal differentiation capacity. In contrast to HSCs co-cultured with control MSCs, HSCs expanded with rMSCs showed higher repopulation capacity and protected lethally irradiated recipient mice. Competitive reconstitution assays revealed an approximately sevenfold expansion of functional HSCs by rMSCs. rMSCs prevented the accumulation of DNA damage in cultured HSCs, a hallmark of ageing and replication stress. Analysis of the reprogramming mechanisms uncovered a role for myocyte enhancer factor 2c (Mef2c) in the revitalization of MSCs. These results provide insight into the transcriptional regulation of the niche with implications for stem cell-based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2939364165,"Major depression is a stress-linked disease with significant morbidity and the anesthetic drug ketamine is of growing interest in the treatment of depression, since in responsive individuals a single dose has rapid (within hours) antidepressant effects that can be sustained for over a week in some instances. This combination of fast action and a therapeutic effect that lasts far beyond the drug's half-life points to a unique mechanism of action. In this reverse translational study, we investigate the degree to which ketamine counteracts stress-related depression-like behavioral responses by determining whether it affects unstressed animals similarly to stressed mice. To test this, male C57BL/6J mice were given a single injection of vehicle (0.9% saline; i.p.), 10 mg/kg ketamine, or 30 mg/kg ketamine, and were tested in the forced swim test (FST) 24 hours and 7 days later, as well as in the open field test on the eighth day. Unstressed mice had normal group housing, environmental enrichment, and experimenter pre-handling (5 days), whereas stressed animals were subjected to chronic mild stress (single housing, reduced enrichment and minimal handling), where some mice also had daily two-week unpredictable chronic stress (UCS). We find that ketamine (24 hours post-injection) decreases immobility and increases mobile (swimming) behavior (antidepressant-like effects) in UCS animals but does the opposite in unstressed mice, similar to recent human findings. In summary, these data suggest that chronic psychological stress interacts with ketamine treatment to modulate its effects in the C57BL/6J mouse FST, which reinforces the relevance of this test, and this strain of mice, to human, stress-induced depression."
https://openalex.org/W2936819241,"Background Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) is a novel image-guided tissue ablation technology that induces cell death via very short but strong pulsed electric fields. IRE has been shown to have preserving properties towards vessels and nerves and the extracellular matrix. This makes IRE an ideal candidate to treat prostate cancer (PCa) where other treatment modalities frequently unselectively destroy surrounding structures inducing severe side effects like incontinence or impotence. We report the retrospective assessment of 471 IRE treatments in 429 patients of all grades and stages of PCa with 6-year maximum follow-up time. Material and findings The patient cohort consisted of low (25), intermediate (88) and high-risk cancers (312). All had multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging, and 199 men had additional 3D-mapping biopsy for diagnostic work-up prior to IRE. Patients were treated either focally (123), sub-whole-gland (154), whole-gland (134) or for recurrent disease (63) after previous radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, etc. Adverse effects were mild (19.7%), moderate (3.7%) and severe (1.4%), never life-threatening. Urinary continence was preserved in all cases. IRE-induced erectile dysfunction persisted in 3% of the evaluated cases 12 months post treatment. Mean transient IIEF-5-Score reduction was 33% within 12-month post IRE follow-up and 15% after 12 months. Recurrences within the follow-up period occurred in 10% of the treated men, 23 in or adjacent to the treatment field and 18 outside the treatment field (residuals). Including residuals for worst case analysis, Kaplan Maier estimation on recurrence rate at 5 years resulted in 5.6% (CI95: 1.8–16.93) for Gleason 6, 14.6% (CI95: 8.8–23.7) for Gleason 7 and 39.5% (CI95: 23.5–61.4) for Gleason 8–10. Conclusion The results indicate comparable efficacy of IRE to standard radical prostatectomy in terms of 5-year recurrence rates and better preservation of urogenital function, proving the safety and suitability of IRE for PCa treatment. The data also shows that IRE, besides focal therapy of early PCa, can also be used for whole-gland ablations, in patients with recurrent PCa, and as a problem-solver for local tumor control in T4-cancers not amenable to surgery and radiation therapy anymore."
https://openalex.org/W2940253979,"Survival rates of osteosarcoma patients could not be significantly improved by conventional chemotherapeutic treatment regimens since the introduction of high-dose chemotherapy 35 years ago. Therefore, there is a strong clinical need for new therapeutic targets and personalized treatment strategies, requiring reliable in vivo model systems for the identification and testing of potential new treatment approaches. Conventional in vivo rodent experiments face ethical issues, are time consuming and costly, being of particular relevance in orphan diseases like osteosarcoma. An attractive alternative to such animal experiments is the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. The CAM is a highly vascularized, non-innervated extra-embryonic membrane that is perfectly suited for the engraftment of tumor cells. However, only few reports are available for osteosarcoma and reported data are inconsistent. Therefore, the aim of this study was the adaptation and optimization of the CAM assay for its application in osteosarcoma research. Tumor take rates and volumes of osteosarcoma that developed on the CAM were analyzed after modification of several experimental parameters, including egg windowing, CAM pretreatment, inoculation technique and many more. Eight osteosarcoma cell lines were investigated. Our optimized OS-CAM-assay was finally validated against a rat animal xenograft model. Using the cell line MNNG HOS as reference we could improve the tumor take rates from 51% to 94%, the viability of the embryos from initially 40% to >80% and achieved a threefold increase of the tumor volumes. We were able to generate solid tumors from all eight osteosarcoma cell lines used in this study and could reproduce results that were obtained using an osteosarcoma rat animal model. The CAM assay can bridge the gap between in vitro cell culture and in vivo animal experiments. As reliable in vivo model for osteosarcoma research the optimized CAM assay may speed up preclinical data collection and simplifies research on potential new agents towards personalized treatment strategies. Further, in accordance with Russell’s and Burch’s “Principles of Humane Experimental Technique” the reasonable use of this model provides a refinement by minimizing pain and suffering of animals and supports a considerable reduction and/or replacement of animal experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2940036075,"Background Infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) producing Gram-negative bacteria has emerge as a global threat in clinical practices. The treat is more serious in developing countries due to inappropriate use, poor adherence, use of counterfeit, sub-standard antibiotics and poor infection control practices. Data on ESBL producing Gram-negative bacteria are limited in developing countries including Ethiopia. The aim of this study was therefore, to describe the burden of ESBL producing Gram negative pathogens isolated from patients attending at Felege Hiwot Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Bahir Dar, Amhara region. Materials and methods A total of 532 clinical samples of blood, urine, stool, wound, abscess, ear discharge, nasal discharge, cervical discharge and body fluid specimens were aseptically collected and bacteriologically processed. Identification of the bacterial species was performed using an automated system (Vitek-2 Compact 27530, USA) and antibiotic susceptibility test was determined by disk diffusion method and selection of antibiotics were in accordance with CLSI guidelines. The MDR pattern of the Gram-negative pathogens was assessed using phenotypic methods of ESBL and carbapenemase production following standard procedure. Result A total of 532 samples were processed and 263 pathogens were isolated. Of these, 185 (70.3%) were Gram-negative and 78 (29.7%) Gram-positive. Of the Gram-negative bacteria the high proportion of the isolates were identified from blood 146/185 (78.9%) and 29/185 (15.7%) were from urine cultures. The most common isolate in all clinical samples was Klebsiella pneumoniae 97/185 (52.4%) followed by Escherichia coli 23/185 (12.4%), Acinetobacter baumannii 15/185 (17.6%) and Enterobacter aerogenes 12/185(6.5%). Of the total Gram negatives, the prevalence of MDR was 148/185 (80.0%). Of the MDR isolates the prevalence of ESBL producers were, 127/148 (85.8%) and 24/148 (16.2%) were carbapenemase producers. Conclusion and recommendation Prevalence of MDR and ESBL producing Gram-negative pathogens in this hospital is alarmingly high. Therefore, continuous monitoring of the problem with effective infection prevention and careful selection of empirical therapy are warranted in the study area."

However, adropin’s roles in human metabolism are unclear. In silico expression profiling in a nonhuman primate diurnal transcriptome atlas (GSE98965) revealed a dynamic and diurnal pattern of ENHO expression. ENHO expression is abundant in brain, including ventromedial and lateral hypothalamic nuclei regulating appetite and autonomic function. Lower ENHO expression is present in liver, lung, kidney, ileum, and some endocrine glands. Hepatic ENHO expression associates with genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering identified 426 genes co-regulated with ENHO in liver, ileum, kidney medulla, and lung. Gene Ontology analysis of this cluster revealed enrichment for epigenetic silencing by histone H3K27 trimethylation and biological processes related to neural function. Dietary intervention experiments with 59 adult male rhesus macaques indicated low plasma adropin concentrations were positively correlated with fasting glucose, plasma leptin, and apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3) concentrations. During consumption of a high-sugar (fructose) diet, which induced 10% weight gain, animals with low adropin had larger increases of plasma leptin and more severe hyperglycemia. Declining adropin concentrations were correlated with increases of plasma APOC3 and triglycerides. In summary, peripheral ENHO expression associates with pathways related to epigenetic and neural functions, and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, suggesting co-regulation in nonhuman primates.

https://openalex.org/W2939618282,"Objectives Large-scale clinical studies investigating associations between intestinal microbiota signatures and human diseases usually rely on stool samples. However, the timing of repeated stool sample collection cannot be predefined in longitudinal settings. Rectal swabs, being straightforward to obtain, have the potential to overcome this drawback. Therefore, we assessed the usability of rectal swabs for microbiome sampling in a cohort of hematological and oncological patients. Study design We used a pipeline for intestinal microbiota analysis from deep rectal swabs which was established and validated with test samples and negative controls. Consecutively, a cohort of patients from hematology and oncology wards was established and weekly deep rectal swabs taken during their admissions and re-admissions. Results Validation of our newly developed pipeline for intestinal microbiota analysis from rectal swabs revealed consistent and reproducible results. Over a period of nine months, 418 rectal swabs were collected longitudinally from 41 patients. Adherence to the intended sampling protocol was 97%. After DNA extraction, sequencing, read pre-processing and filtering of chimeric sequences, 405 of 418 samples (96.9%) were eligible for further analyses. Follow-up samples and those taken under current antibiotic exposure showed a significant decrease in alpha diversity as compared to baseline samples. Microbial domination occurred most frequently by Enterococcaceae (99 samples, 24.4%) on family level and Enterococcus (90 samples, 22.2%) on genus level. Furthermore, we noticed a high abundance of potential skin commensals in 99 samples (24.4%). Summary Deep rectal swabs were shown to be reliable for microbiome sampling and analysis, with practical advantages related to high sampling adherence, easy timing, transport and storage. The relatively high abundance of putative skin commensals in this patient cohort may be of potential interest and should be further investigated. Generally, previous findings on alpha diversity dynamics obtained from stool samples were confirmed."
https://openalex.org/W2936976727,"The postmortem microbiome can provide valuable information to a death investigation and to the human health of the once living. Microbiome sequencing produces, in general, large multi-dimensional datasets that can be difficult to analyze and interpret. Machine learning methods can be useful in overcoming this analytical challenge. However, different methods employ distinct strategies to handle complex datasets. It is unclear whether one method is more appropriate than others for modeling postmortem microbiomes and their ability to predict attributes of interest in death investigations, which require understanding of how the microbial communities change after death and may represent those of the once living host.Postmortem microbiomes were collected by swabbing five anatomical areas during routine death investigation, sequenced and analyzed from 188 death cases. Three machine learning methods (boosted algorithms, random forests, and neural networks) were compared with respect to their abilities to predict case attributes: postmortem interval (PMI), location of death, and manner of death. Accuracy depended on the method used, the numbers of anatomical areas analyzed, and the predicted attribute of death.All algorithms performed well but with distinct features to their performance. Xgboost often produced the most accurate predictions but may also be more prone to overfitting. Random forest was the most stable across predictions that included more anatomic areas. Analysis of postmortem microbiota from more than three anatomic areas appears to yield limited returns on accuracy, with the eyes and rectum providing the most useful information correlating with circumstances of death in most cases for this dataset."

This prospective cohort study included 4,365 older adults (mean age 74.7 years, 53.5% female) living in community settings. Pain characteristics, including severity and duration of pain, were assessed in participants who also underwent monthly follow-up assessment of functional disability for 24 months based on the national long-term care insurance system. Among the 4,365 participants, 2,149 (48.7%) reported pain, regardless of severity and duration. Of the 2,149 participants with pain, 950 (44.2%) reported moderate to severe pain and 1,680 (78.2%) reported chronic pain. Based on the univariate analyses, participants with moderate (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.48 [1.05–2.09]) or severe (2.84 [1.89–4.27]) pain and chronic pain (1.50 [1.15–1.95]) showed significantly higher risk of disability incidence than did those without pain. After adjusting for covariates, severe pain remained a significant predictor (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.66 [1.05–2.62]), but moderate (1.00 [0.69–1.47]) and chronic pain (1.04 [0.77–1.40]) did not. Our results established that moderate to severe pain or chronic pain affects functional disability; in particular, severe pain was independently associated with the incidence of disability. Subjective complaints of pain do not always correspond to physical causes; however, simplified questions regarding pain characteristics could be useful predictors of functional disability in community-dwelling older people."
https://openalex.org/W2937293967,"To date, the only known mechanism conferring protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PPO)-inhibitor resistance in waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus) is a glycine deletion in PPO2 (ΔG210), which results in cross-resistance to foliar PPO-inhibiting herbicides. However, a metabolism-based, HPPD-inhibitor resistant waterhemp population from Illinois (named SIR) was suspected of having a non-target site resistance (NTSR) mechanism due to its resistance to carfentrazone-ethyl (CE) but sensitivity to diphenylethers (DPEs). In greenhouse experiments, SIR sustained less injury than two PPO inhibitor-sensitive populations (WCS and SEN) after applying a field-use rate of CE, and after initial rapid necrosis, regrowth of SIR plants was comparable to a known PPO inhibitor-resistant population (ACR) possessing the ΔG210 mutation. Dose-response analysis determined 50% growth reduction rates in CE-resistant (SIR and ACR) and sensitive (SEN) waterhemp populations, which showed SIR was 30-fold resistant compared to SEN and two-fold more resistant than ACR. Deduced amino acid sequences derived from SIR PPX2 partial cDNAs did not contain the ΔG210 mutation found in ACR or other target-site mutations that confer PPO-inhibitor resistance previously reported in Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri). Although several SIR cDNAs contained amino acid substitutions, none were uniform among samples. Additionally, SIR plants treated with malathion and CE showed a significant reduction in biomass accumulation compared to CE alone. These results indicate robust CE resistance in SIR is not mediated by amino acid changes in the PPO2 protein, but instead resistance may be conferred through a NTSR mechanism such as enhanced herbicide metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2939381070,"Care of patients with potential CDI can involve isolation and use of antibiotics, often before a definitive diagnosis is available, impacting healthcare resource and contributing to antibiotic resistance. There is anecdotal evidence that the faeces of CDI patients have a distinctive odour, while it is well-established that changes in the gut microbiota are associated with changes in the volatile organic compounds (VOC) produced. A total of twenty-four candidate volatile biomarkers were identified from a review of the literature including in vitro, animal and human studies. Using thermal desorption-gas chromatography-time-of flight mass spectrometry (TD-GC-ToFMS), VOC emission rates were determined on stored frozen stool samples from 53 CDI-positive and 53 CDI-negative patients with unexplained diarrhoea which had previously been diagnosed using enzymatic and nucleic acid amplification tests. Sample preparation was limited to placement of a subsample in an appropriate container. Compounds exhibiting a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) in emission rate between the CDI-positive and-negative groups and a corresponding area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (ROC) >0.7 were considered potentially indicative of CDI. Seven compounds were so identified: propan-1-ol (ROC 0.75), 3-methylbutanal (ROC 0.84), ethyl propionate (ROC 0.81), hexanoic acid (ROC 0.73), 4-methylphenol (ROC 0.81), dodecane (ROC 0.80) and indole (ROC 0.85). A number of potential volatile biomarkers of CDI can be sampled rapidly and with little prior preparation from faecal samples of patients with diarrhoea. Of these 4-methylphenol (p-cresol) is of particular interest as it has been anecdotally linked to CDI and is closely related to the biology and virulence of Clostridium difficile. This approach shows promise for the rapid, point-of-care diagnosis of CDI with good sensitivity and specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2936189034,"In skeletal muscle, the major isoform of β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) is β2-AR and the minor isoform is β1-AR, which is opposite to the situation in cardiac muscle. Despite extensive studies in cardiac muscle, the physiological roles of the β-AR subtypes in skeletal muscle are not fully understood. Therefore, in this work, we compared the effects of chronic β1- or β2-AR activation with a specific β1-AR agonist, dobutamine (DOB), or a specific β2-AR agonist, clenbuterol (CB), on masseter and cardiac muscles in mice. In cardiac muscle, chronic β1-AR stimulation induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and myocyte apoptosis, whereas chronic β2-AR stimulation induced cardiac hypertrophy without histological abnormalities. In masseter muscle, however, chronic β1-AR stimulation did not induce muscle hypertrophy, but did induce fibrosis and apoptosis concomitantly with increased levels of p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) (Thr-202/Tyr-204), calmodulin kinase II (Thr-286) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (Ser-2481) phosphorylation. On the other hand, chronic β2-AR stimulation in masseter muscle induced muscle hypertrophy without histological abnormalities, as in the case of cardiac muscle, concomitantly with phosphorylation of Akt (Ser-473) and mTOR (Ser-2448) and increased expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II, an autophagosome marker. These results suggest that the β1-AR pathway is deleterious and the β2-AR is protective in masseter muscle. These data should be helpful in developing pharmacological approaches for the treatment of skeletal muscle wasting and weakness."
https://openalex.org/W2939432713,"Background Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti are the major vectors of arboviral diseases. As effective vaccines are not available for most of the arboviral diseases, vector control by using insecticides play the key role to reduce the disease transmission. The emergence and spread of resistance to different classes of insecticides by the vectors is a major obstacle to control the disease transmission. Information about vector susceptibility to different insecticides and their mechanisms are very important for formulating proper vector control measures. The present study was designed to assess the susceptibility of Ae. aegypti against three different classes of adulticides, one larvicidal agent available and polymorphisms in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene related to insecticide resistance. Methods Immature stages of Ae. aegypti were collected from three dengue endemic municipal areas of West Bengal and reared in the laboratory. Larvae and adults (F1 progeny) were used for insecticide bioassay as per WHO protocols. Knock down resistance gene (kdr) mutations were assessed by direct sequencing of PCR products. Results The Ae. aegypti population was found to be susceptible to type II pyrethroids and malathion but highly resistant to DDT. A high rate of polymorphisms in the VGSC gene was observed among the collected mosquitoes. A double mutant V1016G + F1534C was found to be associated with DDT resistance but neither V1016G nor F1534C alone showed the same association. Association between the kdr mutations and the susceptibility status of pyrethroids could not be established due to very small sample size. A low to moderate level of resistance was noticed against temephos among the larval population based on WHO criteria. Conclusion The replacement of DDT by type II pyrethroids for the management of dengue vectors is an appropriate decision taken by the national program which is supported by the findings of a higher level of resistance to DDT. Persistence of polymorphisms in the VGSC gene might be an indication of emergence of resistance against pyrethroid insecticides that should be monitored at a regular interval. Attempts should be made to determine the effectiveness of other larvicides for replacement of temephos if needed in future. Along with the chemical insecticides different biological vector control methods as well as biopesticides should also be used in vector control programmes."

Our aim is to describe the personality dimensions linked to a core socio-cultural behaviour pattern in Brazil: jeitinho. To reach this goal we conducted four studies. Our first set of studies (1a, 1b and 1c) examined the underlying structure of jeitinho as an individual difference variable and its nomological network with social values, the Big-Five, moral attitudes, and social dominance orientation. In Study 2, we confirm this structure and relate personal jeitinho to perceptions of jeitinho norms. Results demonstrated that personal jeitinho has two dimensions: Jeitinho Simpático is an individual’s tendency to seek positive social interactions, avoid conflict, and find creative solutions; and Jeitinho Malandro captures behaviours such as the use of deception and trickery. These two behaviours are rooted in the same dimensions of the integrated model of values and personality."
https://openalex.org/W2935821024,"Titanium dioxide nanoparticles co-modified with CuOx (0≤x≤2) and carbonaceous materials were prepared with a simple hydrolysis and photo-reduction method for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. SEM/TEM and XPS analysis indicated that the carbonaceous materials were mostly coated on the TiO2 surface and clearly revealed that the Cu species exhibited multivalence states, existing as CuOx (0≤x≤2). The optimal catalyst showed a 56-fold enhanced hydrogen evolution rate compared with that of the pure C/TiO2 catalyst. Further, an intensive multiple electron transfer effect originating from CuOx and the carbonaceous materials is proposed to be responsible for the elevated photoactivity. CuOx species serve as electron donors facilitating charge carrier transfer and proton reduction sites. The carbonaceous materials function as the ""bridge"" that transfers the electrons of TiO2 to the CuOx species, which provides a new route for electron transfer and reinforces the effect of CuOx as a co-catalyst. In this study, the CuOx and C co-modified TiO2 catalyst was prepared with multiple electron transport pathways and enhanced hydrogen production evolution, which provides a deep understanding for the design of co-catalyst-based photocatalysts."

One of the prerequisites of a successful HIVST programme is the availability of an easy to use, valid HIV-test which is robust against field conditions and procedural errors by untrained lay users.The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of untrained persons to correctly interpret the OraQuick HIV Self-Test results with oral fluid compared with results obtained by trained users using the matched lot OraQuick Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody Test and blinded to the results of the Self-Test. Sensitivity of the OraQuick HIV Self-Test in untrained users was 101 in 102 (99.02%; 95%CI = 93.88-99.95%)-and specificity- 1,241 in 1,241 (100.0%; 95%CI = 99.62-100.0%). Forty-eight Self-Tests were excluded in the accuracy analysis (due to a result read as invalid, not sure or ambiguous) resulting in a test system failure rate of 3.45% (95% CI 2.56%-4.55%). At least one observation of difficulty or error with one or more of the test steps were seen in 1,193 (84.6%) participants. Age, education and health literacy were independently associated with the sum score of procedural errors and difficulties. Four tests did not provide a valid result as determined by the trained user's interpretation of the Self-Test.The OraQuick HIV Self-Test provides reliable and repeatable results in a rural field environment in spite of procedural errors."
https://openalex.org/W2938588666,"The purpose of the present study was to translate and modify the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Centre (OSTRC) overuse injury questionnaire into Japanese and validate it among Japanese athletes through a longitudinal survey. A modified back-translation method was used to translate the questionnaire from English to Japanese. The longitudinal survey was performed in 29 female college swimmers who were followed up for more than 24 consecutive weeks. The response rate to the 24 weekly questionnaires was 88.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 85.2-92.3). Internal consistency was measured by using Cronbach's alpha (0.73 (0.69-0.77)). The anatomical areas most frequently affected by overuse injuries were the lower back (average weekly prevalence: 27.6%, 95% CI: 25.1-30.1), shoulder (16.0%, 95% CI: 13.7-18.2), knee (9.9%, 95% CI: 7.7-12.0), and ankle (9.0%, 7.6-10.5). The severity score showed that knee (22.5, range: 6-65), ankle (21.5, range: 6-67), and lower back (20.7, range: 6-80) injuries had the greatest impact. The Japanese version of the modified OSTRC overuse injury questionnaire demonstrated reliability and validity based on the results of internal consistency and trend of injury of the swimmers. The participants in the present study did not have substantial injuries or time-loss injuries and continued practicing and competing, despite these minor injuries. Although knee and ankle injuries do not occur as often as lower back and shoulder injuries, these injuries often had a greater impact on swimmers when they did occur."

https://openalex.org/W2936397382,"Four immunohistochemistry (IHC) diagnostic assays have been approved for tumour PD-L1 protein assessment in the clinic. However, mRNA detection by in situ hybridisation (ISH) could be utilised as an alternative to protein detection. Detecting spatial changes in gene expression provides vital prognostic and diagnostic information, particularly in immune oncology where the phenotype, cellular infiltration and immune activity status may be associated with patient survival. Translation of mRNA expression to a clinically relevant cut off or threshold is challenging due to variability between assays and the detection of different analytes. These studies aim to confirm the suitability of formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections for use with RNA ISH. A comparison of mRNA expression and protein expression may inform the suitability of mRNA as a patient selection biomarker in a similar manner to IHC and provide evidence of a suitable scoring algorithm. Ninety patient samples, thirty for each indication of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and urothelial carcinoma (UC), previously assessed using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay were chosen to represent a wide dynamic range of percentage tumour cell staining (TCIHC). Expression of mRNA was assessed by ISH using the RNAScope 2.5 assay and probe CD274/PD-L1 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) including kit provided positive and negative control probes. Brightfield whole slide images of tissues were captured. The percentage of tumour cells with PD-L1 mRNA expression (%TCmRNA) and mean punctate dots/tumour cell were determined using image analysis. Differences in RNA expression between the IHC derived TCIHC≥25% and <25% groups were assessed using t-tests. For each indication, a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified thresholds for patient classification using %TCmRNA and dots/tumour cell, with reference to TCIHC≥25%. Eighty-six samples were successfully tested; 3 failed due to insufficient control probe staining, 1 due to lack of tumour. Percent TCmRNA staining using RNAScope demonstrated statistical significance (at α = 0.05) in the PD-L1 high (TCIHC ≥25%) vs the PD-L1 low (TCIHC <25%) groups for NSCLC, HNSCC, and UC. The number of punctate dots/tumour cell was significantly higher in the PD-L1 high vs the PD-L1 low groups for NSCLC and HNSCC but not UC. For %TCmRNA; ROC analysis identified thresholds of: NSCLC 18.0%, HNSCC 31.8%, UC 25.8%. For dots/tumour cell, thresholds were: NSCLC 0.26, HNSCC 0.53, UC 0.45. Routine tissue fixation and processing is suitable for RNA detection using RNAScope. PD-L1 mRNA extent and level is associated with PD-L1 status determined by IHC. Threshold optimisation for %TCmRNA and mean dots/tumour cell results in high specificity to IHC PD-L1 classification, but only moderate sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2936551531,"Many aspects of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are still poorly understood. Yet these knowledge gaps have had and could continue to have adverse, unintended consequences for the efficacy and safety of antivirals and vaccines developed against RSV. Mathematical modelling was used to test and evaluate hypotheses about the rate of loss of RSV infectivity and the mechanisms and kinetics of RSV infection spread in SIAT cells in vitro. While the rate of loss of RSV integrity, as measured via qRT-PCR, is well-described by an exponential decay, the latter mechanism failed to describe the rate at which RSV A Long loses infectivity over time in vitro based on the data presented herein. This is unusual given that other viruses (HIV, HCV, influenza) have been shown to lose their infectivity exponentially in vitro, and indeed an exponential rate of loss of infectivity is always assumed in mathematical modelling and experimental analyses. The infectivity profile of RSV in HEp-2 and SIAT cells remained consistent over the course of an RSV infection, over time and a large range of infectivity. However, SIAT cells were found to be ∼ 100× less sensitive to RSV infection than HEp-2 cells. In particular, we found that RSV spreads inefficiently in SIAT cells, in a manner we show is consistent with the establishment of infection resistance in uninfected cells. SIAT cells are a good in vitro model in which to study RSV in vivo dissemination, yielding similar infection timescales. However, the higher sensitivity of HEp-2 cells to RSV together with its RSV infectivity profile being similar to that of SIAT cells, makes HEp-2 cells more suitable for quantifying RSV infectivity over the course of in vitro RSV infections in SIAT cells. Our findings highlight the importance and urgency of resolving the mechanisms at play in the dissemination of RSV infections in vitro, and the processes by which this infectivity is lost."
https://openalex.org/W2938314130,"Bacteria can acquire an accessory genome through the horizontal transfer of genetic elements from non-parental lineages. This leads to rapid genetic evolution allowing traits such as antibiotic resistance and virulence to spread through bacterial communities. The study of complete genomes of bacterial strains helps to understand the genomic traits associated with virulence and antibiotic resistance. We aimed to investigate the complete accessory genome of an ocular isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA34. We obtained the complete genome of PA34 utilising genome sequence reads from Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technology followed by PCR to close any identified gaps. In-depth genomic analysis was performed using various bioinformatics tools. The susceptibility to heavy metals and cytotoxicity was determined to confirm expression of certain traits. The complete genome of PA34 includes a chromosome of 6.8 Mbp and two plasmids of 95.4 Kbp (pMKPA34-1) and 26.8 Kbp (pMKPA34-2). PA34 had a large accessory genome of 1,213 genes and had 543 unique genes not present in other strains. These exclusive genes encoded features related to metal and antibiotic resistance, phage integrase and transposons. At least 24 genomic islands (GIs) were predicated in the complete chromosome, of which two were integrated into novel sites. Eleven GIs carried virulence factors or replaced pathogenic genes. A bacteriophage carried the aminoglycoside resistance gene (AAC(3)-IId). The two plasmids carried other six antibiotic resistance genes. The large accessory genome of this ocular isolate plays a large role in shaping its virulence and antibiotic resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2937151175,"Antipsychotics are crucial for the treatment of schizophrenia and contribute to weight gain in psychosis, particularly during early phases. Antipsychotic Induced Weight Gain (AIWG) might contribute to reduce the quality of life, drug compliance and to increase mortality. To characterize sex differences of gene expression related to AIWG, we sequenced total mRNA from blood samples of schizophrenia patients, before and after 3 months of antipsychotic-treatment. We analyzed schizophrenia patients according to their sex (38 males and 39 females) and their BMI increase after medication, characterizing the differential gene expression before and after medication. Individuals in each group were categorized in patients who gain weight and those whose do not gain weight. The “weight gain” groups included patients with an increase of body mass index (BMI) > 1.0 points (27 males and 23 females with a median BMI increase of 2.68 and 2.32 respectively). The “no weight gain” groups included patients with a change of BMI between < 1.0 and > -1.0 points (11 males and 16 females with a median BMI increase of 0.21 and 0.16 respectively). The males had 331 genes with significant differential expression in the weight gain group and 24 genes in the no weight gain group. The females had 119 genes with significant differential expression in the weight gain group and 75 genes in the no weight gain group. Both weight gain groups were significantly enriched with “obesity” genes (Fisher; p = 1.1E-09 and p = 0.0001 respectively), according to the Gene Reference into Function (GeneRIF) database.In conclusion, we characterized genes with differential expression associated to AIWG that are specific to males, to females and common to both sexes. These genes are good candidates to depict the biological processes involved in AIWG and provide additional evidence of the genetic links between weight gain and the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2936312326,"The close physical proximity between the Golgi and the centrosome is a unique feature of mammalian cells that has baffled scientists for years. Several knockdown and overexpression studies have linked the spatial relationship between these two organelles to the control of directional protein transport, directional migration, ciliogenesis and mitotic entry. However, most of these conditions have not only separated these two organelles, but also caused extensive fragmentation of the Golgi, making it difficult to dissect the specific contribution of Golgi-centrosome proximity. In this study, we present our results with stable retinal pigment epithelial (RPE-1) cell lines in which GM130 was knocked out using a CRISPR/Cas9 approach. While Golgi and centrosome organization appeared mostly intact in cells lacking GM130, there was a clear separation of these organelles from each other. We show that GM130 may control Golgi-centrosome proximity by anchoring AKAP450 to the Golgi. We also provide evidence that the physical proximity between these two organelles is dispensable for protein transport, cell migration, and ciliogenesis. These results suggest that Golgi-centrosome proximity per se is not necessary for the normal function of RPE-1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2937133940,"Grunting in tennis is a widespread phenomenon and whether it influences opponents' predictions of ball trajectory-and if so, why-is subject of ongoing debate. Two alternative hypotheses have been proposed to explain why grunting may impede opponents' predictions, referred to as the distraction account (i.e., grunts capture attentional resources necessary for anticipation) and the multisensory integration account (i.e., auditory information from the grunt systematically influences ball trajectory prediction typically assumed to rely on visual information). To put these competing hypotheses to test, in the current study we presented tennis players with a series of temporally occluded video clips of tennis rallies featuring experimentally amplified, attenuated, or muted grunting sounds. Participants were asked to predict the ball landing position. Results indicated that higher grunt intensities yielded judgments of longer ball trajectories whereas radial prediction errors were not affected. These results are clearly at odds with the distraction account of grunting, predicting increased prediction errors after higher intensity grunts. In contrast, our findings provide strong support for the multisensory integration account by demonstrating that grunt intensity systematically influences judgments of ball trajectory."
https://openalex.org/W2937983702,"Background Antidepressants are frequently used in older patients with depression, but little is known about the comparative safety of individual agents. The objective of the study was to determine the comparative risk of death of antidepressants in older patients with depression. Methods and findings We carried out a cohort study from 2004 to 2015 utilizing the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database, a population-based database supplied by statutory health insurance providers covering approximately 17% of the general population and all geographical regions. We included 376,846 patients aged 65+ years with a diagnosis of depression who initiated treatment with one of 13 antidepressants (ADs). In total 27,019 patients died during follow-up corresponding to a rate of 119.7 per 1,000 person years. We used proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of death for twelve ADs compared to citalopram. In the primary analysis, we found an increased risk of death associated with the use of amitriptyline (HR 1.15, 95%CI: 1.10–1.20). However, opipramol, trimipramine, doxepin, mirtazapine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and St. John’s wort were found to be associated with a lower risk of death. The increased risk of amitriptyline diminished after exclusion of patients with a history of cancer (HR 0.88, 95%CI: 0.82–0.94) and after high-dimensional propensity score (HdPS) adjustment (HR 1.04, 95%CI: 0.95–1.14). In older patients and in those with dementia, differences in risk between most individual ADs and citalopram were smaller. After adjustment by HdPS, the decreased risks for fluoxetine, paroxetine, venlafaxine and mirtazapine compared to citalopram disappeared. Conclusions This study suggests that ADs recommended as first-line treatment in patients with depression have a similar safety profile with regard to the risk of death, especially in very old patients and in those with dementia. Further research is needed to investigate the risk of death for individual ADs in specific subgroups such as patients with cancer or cardiovascular disease."

Methods A total of 833 patients with cervical cancer treated with definitive radiotherapy or CCRT in our institute from January 2011 to December 2014 were included. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used in univariate and multivariate analysis. The following variables were included in the univariate analysis: histology, FIGO stage, lymph node metastases (para-aortic, pelvic, common iliac, binary pelvic, and binary common iliac LNMs), the number of pelvic metastatic lymph nodes (MLNs), and the diameter of pelvic MLNs. Nomograms predicting the 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local control (LC) and distant metastasis-free (DMF) were constructed. The nomograms were internally validated with respect to discrimination and calibration. Results The median follow-up period was 36.4 months (range,1.0 to 76.2 months). After univariate and multivariate analysis, histology, FIGO stage, para-aortic LNM, pelvic LNM, number of MLNs and diameter of pelvic MLNs significantly predicted OS, DFS, LC or DMF. Nomograms predicting the 3- and 5-year OS, DFS, LC and DMF were constructed incorporating these significant variables. These nomograms showed good discrimination and calibration, with a concordance index of 0.73 for predicting OS, 0.71 for DFS, 0.73 for LC and 0.67 for DMF. Conclusion We constructed nomograms predicting survival and patterns of failure with a special focus on regional LNM in patients with cervical cancer treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy."

We constructed robust counterfactual scenarios for observed vegetation outcome trajectories in the Indian Himalaya using synthetic control matching. This approach enabled us to quantify the contribution of a set of biophysical and socioeconomic factors in shaping observed outcomes. Results show the relative importance of baseline vegetation condition, governance, and demographic change in predicting long-term ecological outcomes. More generally, the findings suggest the broad potential utility of our approach to analyze long-term outcome trajectories, target new policy interventions, and assess the impacts of policies on sustainability goals in SESs across the globe."
https://openalex.org/W2937231989,"The possibility that anesthesia during cancer surgery may affect cancer recurrence, metastasis, and patient prognosis has become one of the most important topics of interest in cancer treatment. For example, the volatile anesthetic isoflurane was reported in several studies to induce hypoxia-inducible factors, and thereby enhance malignant phenotypes in vitro. Indeed, these transcription factors are considered critical regulators of cancer-related hallmarks, including “sustained proliferative signaling, evasion of growth suppressors, resistance to cell death, replicative immortality, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis.” This study aimed to investigate the impact of isoflurane on the growth and migration of derivatives of the renal cell line RCC4. We indicated that isoflurane treatment did not positively influence cancer cell phenotypes, and that hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) maintain hallmark cancer cell phenotypes including gene expressions signature, metabolism, cell proliferation and cell motility. The present results indicate that HIF activity is not influenced by the volatile anesthetic isoflurane."
https://openalex.org/W2937994735,"Background The contacts of people with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) have a high risk of becoming infected and developing tuberculosis (TB). Our aim was to determine the incidence of TB and its risk factors in a cohort of contacts with latent TB infection (LTBI) detected through contact tracing of smear-positive PTB cases. Methods and findings We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study including contacts that had LTBI, and were contacts of people with PTB who started treatment between 2008 and 2014. We followed up contacts until they developed TB or until the end date for follow-up (31st December 2016). We used Kaplan-Meier curves to compute incidence at 2 and 5 years, and Cox regression to compute hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analyzed 3097 close contacts of 565 PTB cases. After exclusion of 81 co-prevalent TB cases, 953 contacts had LTBI, of which 14 developed TB. Their risk of developing TB after two and five years was 0.7% (CI: 0.3–1.6) and 1.8% (CI: 1.1–3.1) respectively. Contacts who had not been referred for LTBI treatment had a 1.0% (CI: 0.2–4.0) risk at 5 years. Risk of developing TB at 5 years was 1.2% (CI: 0.5–3.0) among people who completed treatment, and 11.1% (CI: 5.1–23.3) for those who did not. Risk factors for TB were not completing LTBI treatment (HR 9.4, CI: 2.9–30.8) and being female (HR 3.5, CI: 1.1-11-3). Conclusions LTBI treatment plays a fundamental role in decreasing the risk of developing TB. It is necessary to achieve a maximum contact tracing coverage and the highest possible compliance with LTBI treatment."

The duration of follow-up ranged between 13 and 176 months (mean 48 months). In the 22 patients managed by the ""wait and see"" approach, the average tumor size at initial presentation was 51 mm, which increased to 57 mm at final follow-up. During the final follow-up, 2 patients required surgical treatment for tumor enlargement, while the remaining patients remained asymptomatic without surgery. The average growth rate of the tumors was 1.9 mm/year (range: -1.9 to 8.7 mm/year). The majority of asymptomatic retroperitoneal schwannomas demonstrate minimal growth and may be suitable for management with the ""wait and see"" approach."
https://openalex.org/W2937992819,"Cathepsin L (CTSL) has been proved to help contain leishmaniasis and mycoplasma infection in mice by supporting cellular immune responses, but the regulatory functions of CTSL on mucosal immune responses haven't been tested and remain undefined. Here, we investigated the effects of CTSL on SIgA responses and invariant chain (Ii) degradations in the co-cultured swine dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells system in vitro. When the cells system were transfected with vector CTSL-GFP or incubated with recombinant CTSL (rCTSL) before they were infected with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M.hp), SIgA significantly increased and Ii chain was degraded into smaller intermediates, while SIgA decreased when CTSL was knockdown or inhibited with E64. To confirm the SIgA responses promoted by CTSL contribute to the resistance to mycoplasma pneumonia, pigs injected with rCTSL before they were challenged with M.hp, showed milder clinical symptoms and histopathological damage of lungs, less mycoplasma burden together with higher secretion of SIgA, percentages of CD4+ T cells and level of MHC II molecules comparing with the group without rCTSL. Collectively, these results suggested that rCTSL could provide effective protection for piglets against mycoplasma pneumonia by enhancing M.hp-specific mucosal immune responses through its role in antigen presentation by processing the invariant chain."
https://openalex.org/W2937718727,"Crowdfunding is gradually becoming a modern marketing pattern. By noting that the success of crowdfunding depends on network externalities, our research aims to utilize these network externalities to provide an applicable referral mechanism in a crowdfunding-based marketing pattern. In the context of network externalities, measuring the value of leading customers is chosen as the key to coping with the research problem, as the leading customers are considered to be critical in forming a referral network. Accordingly, two sequential-move game models (i.e., the basic model and the extended model) were established to measure the value of leading customers, and a matrix transformation process was adopted to solve the model by transforming a complicated multisequence game into a simple simultaneous-move game. Based on the defined value of leading customers, a network-based referral mechanism was proposed that explores exactly how many awards should be allocated along the customer sequence to encourage the leading customers to provide a successful recommendation, and this demonstrates two general rules of awarding the referrals in our model setting. Moreover, the proposed solution approach helps to deepen the understanding of the effect of the leading position, which is meaningful for designing a greater number of referral approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2938291603,"Production of steroid hormones is complex and dependent upon steroidogenic enzymes, cofactors, receptors, and transporters expressed within a tissue. Collectively, these factors create an environment for tissue-specific steroid hormone profiles and potentially tissue-specific responses to drug administration. Our objective was to assess steroid production, including sulfated steroid metabolites in the boar testis, prostate, and liver following inhibition of aromatase, the enzyme that converts androgen precursors to estrogens. Boars were treated with the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole from 11 to 16 weeks of age and littermate boars received the canola oil vehicle. Steroid profiles were evaluated in testes, prostate, and livers of 16, 20, and 40 week old boars using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Testis, prostate, and liver had unique steroid profiles in vehicle-treated animals. Only C18 steroid hormones were altered by treatment with the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole; no significant differences were detected in any of the C19 or C21 steroids evaluated. Testis was the only tissue with significantly decreased free estrogens following treatment with the aromatase inhibitor; estrone and estradiol concentrations were lower (p < 0.05) in testes from 16, 20, and 40 week letrozole-treated boars. However, concentrations of the sulfated conjugates, estrone-sulfate and estradiol-sulfate, were significantly decreased (p<0.05) in 16 and 20 week boar testes, prostates, and livers from letrozole-treated boars. Hence, the distribution of estrogens between the free and conjugated forms was altered in a tissue-specific manner following inhibition of aromatase. The results suggest sulfated testicular estrogens are important estrogen precursors for the prostate, potentially enabling peripheral target tissues to synthesize free estrogens in the male pig."

P. cablin in China can be divided into three cultivars (Shipai, Gaoyao, and Hainan) and two chemotypes (pogostone-type and patchoulol-type). The pogostone-type and patchoulol-type are, respectively, used for medicinals and perfumes. In this study, we sequenced and characterized the plastid genomes for all three Chinese cultivars and aimed to develop a chemotype-specific barcode for future quality control. The plastid genomes of P. cablin cultivars ranged from 152,461 to 152,462 bp in length and comprise 114 genes including 80 protein coding genes, 30 tRNA genes, and four rRNA genes. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that P. cablin cultivars clustered with the other two Pogostemon species with strong support. Although extremely conserved in P. cablin plastid genomes, 58 cpSSRs were filtered out among the three cultivars. One single variable locus, cpSSR, was discovered. The cpSSR genotypes successfully matched the chemotypes of Chinese patchouli, which was further supported by PCR-based Sanger sequences in more Chinese patchouli samples. The barcode developed in this study is thought to be a simple and reliable quality control method for Chinese P. cablin on the market."

Although the precise molecular mechanism of action of ASA on protein glycation is not indisputably perceived, acetylation as its main molecular mechanism has been proposed. This report aims to unravel the meticulous mechanism of action of ASA by using two ASA analogues; benzoic acid (BA) and para-nitrobenzoic acid (NBA), despite their lack of acetyl group. In this regard, the inhibitory effect of these two chemicals in comparison with ASA on Hb fructation is reported. UV-visible spectroscopy, intrinsic advanced glycation end products (AGE) fluorescence spectroscopy, extrinsic thioflavin T (ThT) binding fluorescence spectroscopy, 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBSA) assay, and single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) were used to explore the effects of BA and NBA in comparison with aforementioned chemicals in the context of protein glycation. In spite of the lack of acetyl substitution, NBA is reported as a novel agent with prominent inhibitory efficacy than ASA on the protein glycation. This fact brings up a possible new mechanism of action of ASA and reconsiders acetylation as the sole mechanism of inhibition of protein glycation."
https://openalex.org/W2936662281,"Due to the paucity of known RNA structures, experimental phasing is crucial for obtaining three-dimensional structures of RNAs by X-ray crystallography. Covalent attachment of heavy atoms to RNAs is one of the most useful strategies to facilitate phase determination. However, this approach is limited by the inefficiency or inability to synthesize large RNAs (>60 nucleotides) site-specifically labeled with heavy atoms using traditional methods. Here, we applied our recently reported method, PLOR (position-selective labeling of RNA) to incorporate 5-iodouridine at specific positions in the adenine riboswitch RNA aptamer domain, which was then used for crystallization and subsequent de novo SAD phasing. PLOR is a powerful tool to improve the efficiency of obtaining RNA structures de novo by X-ray crystallography."
https://openalex.org/W2940022147,"The apicomplexan parasite Sarcocystis calchasi (Coccidia: Eimeriorina: Sarcocystidae) is the causative agent of Pigeon Protozoal Encephalitis (PPE) and infects birds of the orders Columbiformes, Piciformes and Psittaciformes. Accipiter hawks (Aves: Accipitriformes) are the definitive hosts of this parasite. Infections of S. calchasi have been detected in Germany, the United States and Japan. However, the prevalence of the parasite in racing pigeon flocks has not yet been determined. Here, the first cross-sectional prevalence study to investigate S. calchasi in pigeon racing flocks was accomplished including 245 pigeon flocks across Germany. A total of 1,225 muscle biopsies, were taken between 2012 and 2016 and examined by semi-nested PCR for S. calchasi DNA targeting the ITS gene. Additionally, a questionnaire on construction of the aviary as well as management and health status of the flock was conducted. In 27.8% (95% C.I. = 22.3-33.8%) of the flocks, S. calchasi DNA was detected in at least one pigeon. Positive flocks were located in 15 out of 16 federal states. A significant increase of infected racing pigeons was seen in spring. Half-covered or open aviary constructions showed a trend of increase of the prevalence rate, while anti-coccidian treatment and acidified drinking water had no effects. The high prevalence and the geographical distribution of S. calchasi suggest a long-standing occurrence of the parasite in the German racing pigeon population. For pigeons presented with neurological signs or other symptoms possibly related to PPE, S. calchasi should be considered as a potential cause throughout Germany."
https://openalex.org/W2935876714,"Current approaches to influenza control rely on vaccines matched to viruses in circulation. Universal influenza vaccines would offer the advantage of providing broad protection against diverse strains of influenza virus. Candidate universal vaccines are developed using model systems, often testing in naïve animals. Yet the human population is not naïve, having varied immune histories that include exposure to viruses. We studied a candidate universal influenza vaccine (replication deficient adenoviruses expressing the conserved influenza A antigens NP and M2 [A/NP+M2-rAd]) given intranasally, the route previously shown to be most effective. To model recipients exposed to viruses, we used mice given rhinovirus (RV1B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV-A2), influenza B virus, or influenza A virus before or after universal influenza vaccine. Vaccine performance was assessed by measuring immune responses to NP and M2, and monitoring weight loss and survival following influenza A challenge. Prior influenza A virus infection enhanced the response to the vaccine by priming to conserved influenza A antigens. RSV-A2 or RV1B had no effect on antibody responses to NP and M2 in serum. None of the viruses inhibited the ability of the vaccine to protect against influenza A virus challenge. The study demonstrates that the usefulness of this universal vaccine is not confined to the immunologically naïve and supports possible use in a human population with a varied history of respiratory infections."
https://openalex.org/W2936815475,"Recent improvements in additive manufacturing technologies may facilitate the use of customized 3D printed grafts for horizontal and vertical augmentation of the atrophic alveolar ridge. The accurate fit of such grafts could reduce the clinical treatment time and contribute optimal bone regeneration. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the marginal and internal fit of 3D printed resin grafts as they could be used for alveolar ridge augmentation. Alveolar ridge morphologic data were derived from the Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scans of six patients with alveolar bone defects. These data were transferred to a segmentation program to produce virtual 3D reconstructions of the alveolar ridge models. Using a Computer Aided Design (CAD) program, the alveolar bone defects were defined and customized grafts were designed and both the defects as well as the grafts generated (CAM) as 3D projects. These projects were imported into a 3D printer and were manufactured in resin. Hereafter, the grafts were fitted to the defect sites of the corresponding models and new CBCT scans were performed. Based on these scans, measurements were made at the marginal and internal part of the fitted grafts to evaluate the marginal and internal fit, respectively. The statistical analysis revealed that the mean marginal fit was significantly better (P < 0.05) than the mean internal fit. The fit of the grafts was dependent on the shape and on the size of the grafts. Specifically, the total void surface between the fitted graft and the corresponding defect site was significantly larger in the large-defect grafts than the small-defect grafts (P < 0.05). Within the limitations of the study, it could be demonstrated that it is possible to fabricate 3D printed resin grafts with acceptable fit in customized shapes, when combining CBCT scans and computer aided design and 3D printing techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2939496284,"Given the centrality of regions in social movements, politics and public administration, here we aim to quantitatively study regional identity, cross-region communication and sentiment. This paper presents a new methodology to study social interaction within and between social-geographic regions, and then applies the methodology to a case study of England and Wales. We use a social network, built from geo-located Twitter data, to identify contiguous geographical regions with a shared social identity and then investigate patterns of communication within and between them. In contrast to other approaches (e.g. using phone call data records or online friendship networks), use of Twitter data provides message contents as well as social connections. This allows us to investigate not only the volume of communication between locations, but also the sentiment and vocabulary used in the messages. For example, our case study shows: a significant dialect difference between England and Wales; that regions tend to be more positive about themselves than about others, with the South being more ‘self-regarding’ than the North; and that people talk politics much more between regions than within. This study demonstrates how social media can be used to quantify regional identity and inter-region communications and sentiment, exposing these previously hard-to-observe geographic concepts to analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2939553196,"Background & aims The offspring of patients with premature coronary artery disease (P-CAD) are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, compared with subjects without a family history (FH) of P-CAD. The increased risk for cardiovascular disease in subjects with FH of early-onset CAD results from unfavorable genetic variants as well as social, behavioral and environmental factors, which are more prevalent in this group. Previous studies have shown that specific sex hormone levels may be associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to compare wide range of biochemical marker levels including i.e. the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), progesterone, estradiol, testosterone and sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) between young healthy male adults with and without FH of P-CAD. Methods The study group consisted of young healthy Polish male adults enrolled in a MAGNETIC case-control study, who were recruited between July 2015 and October 2017. The inclusion criteria were as follows: male sex, age ≥18 and ≤35 years old, FH of P-CAD (cases) or no P-CAD in first-degree relatives (controls). The comparison of continuous and categorical variables was performed using the Student’s t-test or the U-Mann–Whitney test, and Fisher’s exact test, respectively. The correlations between FSH, LH, testosterone, progesterone, SHBG and other laboratory parameters were assessed using the Spearman rank correlation test. Both univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between analyzed variables and FH of P-CAD. Results A total of 411 subjects (223 cases and 188 controls) were included in the study. There was a higher prevalence of major cardiovascular risk factors in subjects with FH of P-CAD (smoking, higher total and LDL cholesterol levels, higher body mass index and lower HDL cholesterol level). Moreover, the offspring of patients with P-CAD had lower SHBG level, and higher LH and progesterone levels in the crude comparison, compared with individuals without FH of P-CAD. After adjustment for confounding variables, progesterone and LH were determined to be independently associated with FH of P-CAD. Conclusion Progesterone and LH levels are significantly associated with FH of P-CAD, independent of traditional risk factors for CAD."
https://openalex.org/W2939980728,"While recent studies have emphasized the role of metacognitive judgments in social interactions, whether social context might reciprocally impact individuals’ metacognition remains an open question. It has been proposed that such might be the case in situations involving stereotype threat. Here, we provide the first empirical test of this hypothesis. Using a visual search task, we asked participants, on a trial-by-trial basis, to monitor the unfolding and accuracy of their search processes, and we developed a computational model to measure the accuracy of their metacognition. Results indicated that stereotype threat enhanced metacognitive monitoring of both outcomes and processes. Our study thus shows that social context can actually affect metacognition."
https://openalex.org/W2936442564,"The abundance of ungulate populations may fluctuate in response to several limiting factors, including climate, diseases, and predation. In the northern Richardson Mountains, Canada, Dall sheep (Ovis dalli dalli) have undergone a major decline in the past decades and predation by grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and wolves (Canis lupus) was suspected as a leading cause. To better understand the relationship between these three species located in this rugged and remote ecosystem, we relied on a combination of indirect methods. We investigated the apparent role of predation on the Dall sheep population using spatial ecology and stable isotopes. We examined seasonal variation in predation risk, focusing on how it may affect Dall sheep habitat use and sexual segregation, and we evaluated the proportion of Dall sheep in the diet of both predators using stable isotopes. The movements of the three species were monitored by satellite telemetry. Dall sheep habitat use patterns were analyzed using topographical features, greenness index, land cover, and apparent predation risk. The diets of grizzly bears and wolves were examined using a Bayesian mixing model for carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes. We found that Dall sheep habitat use varied seasonally, with different patterns for ewes and rams. Exposure to grizzly bear risk was higher for rams during summer, while ewes were further exposed to wolf apparent predation risk during winter. The importance of safe habitats for ewes was reflected in space use patterns. Stable isotopes analyses suggested that the diet of grizzly bears was largely from animal sources, with mountain mammals comprising about one quarter. Wolves mostly fed on both aquatic browsers and mountain mammals. Diet variation between individual predators suggested that some individuals specialized on mountain mammals, likely including Dall sheep. We conclude that grizzly bear and wolf apparent predation risk are important in driving Dall sheep habitat use and play a role in sexual segregation. Overall, this study presents an innovative combination of indirect methods that could be applied elsewhere to better understand predator-prey dynamics in remote ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2937595057,"Despite growing scientific interest in the benefits of breaking up sedentary time with intermittent standing or walking, few studies have investigated the energy cost of posture transitions. This study aimed to determine whether posture transitions are associated with increased energy expenditure in preschool children.Forty children (mean age 5.3 ± 1.0y) completed a ~150-min room calorimeter protocol involving sedentary, light, and moderate- to vigorous-intensity activities. This study utilised data from ~65-min of the protocol, during which children were undertaking sedentary behaviours (TV viewing, drawing/colouring in, and playing with toys on the floor). Posture was coded as sit/lie, stand, walk, or other using direct observation; posture transitions were classified as sit/lie to stand/walk, sit/lie to other, stand/walk to other, or vice versa. Energy expenditure was calculated using the Weir equation and used to calculate individualised MET and activity energy expenditure (AEE) values. Spearman's rank correlations were used to compare the number of posture transitions, in the individual activities separately and combined, with corresponding MET and AEE values. Participants were divided into tertiles based on the number of posture transitions; MET and AEE values of children in the lowest and highest tertiles of posture transitions were compared using unpaired t-tests. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) were calculated.There was a positive correlation between the total number of posture transitions and average METs (rs = 0.42, p = 0.02) and AEE (rs = 0.43, p = 0.02). MET differences between the lowest and highest tertiles of posture transitions resulted in a small effect size for playing with toys (d = 0.27), and moderate effect sizes for TV viewing, drawing and all three activities combined (d = 0.61, 0.50 and 0.64 respectively). Similar results were found for AEE.Results from this study showed that variation in posture transitions may be associated with variation in energy expenditure in preschool children. The findings suggest that the concept that variation in posture transitions may have meaningful biological or health effects in early childhood is worth investigating further."
https://openalex.org/W2936062666,"Functional studies suggest that promoter polymorphisms of the Prostaglandin D Receptor (PTGDR) gene can be involved in asthma. All-trans Retinoic acid (ATRA) has also been linked to allergic diseases. We have previously described the PTGDR promoter activation mediated by ATRA through response elements (RARE) at position -549T> C. In this study we aimed to analyze the effect of retinoic acid (RA) on the expression of PTGDR, the production of cytokines as well as to evaluate the binding of RA receptors to RA-Response Elements (RARE) sequences. A549 cells were transfected with vectors carrying different PTGDR haplotypes and treated with all-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA). PTGDR expression was measured by qPCR. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) were performed in ATRA stimulated KU812 cells and in PBMCs of patients carrying CTCT, CCCC or CCCT haplotypes. In addition, a broad panel of cytokines was analyzed by cytometric bead assay in A549 cells. The expression of PTGDR increased in A549 cells transfected with PTGDR-variants. The CCCC haplotype showed a significantly higher expression compared with CTCT. However, we found that RA up-regulated PTGDR expression through RARα mainly in the CTCT variant. Experiments on PBMCs from allergic patients carrying the -549T and -549C variant of the PTGDR promoter after ATRA and RAR antagonist administration confirmed the modulation of PTGDR by ATRA. The cytokine analysis showed that IL4 and IL6 levels were significantly increased in A549 cells transfected with PTGDR. In addition, ATRA treatment decreased the levels of IL4, IL6 and TNFα in A549 cells, whereas it increased IL4 and TNFα levels in PTGDR-transfected cells. We observed genetic differences in the regulation of PTGDR by ATRA that could contribute to the phenotypic differences observed in allergic patients. Our findings showed that RAR modulation by PTGDR might have an impact on Th2 responses, suggesting that RAR could be a potential therapeutic target in allergic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2939228844,"Plant extracts and phytochemicals may prevent chronic diseases via activation of adaptive cellular stress response pathways including induction of antioxidant and phase II detoxifying enzymes. The regulatory regions of these inducible genes encode the electrophile-response element (EpRE). This study tested the EpRE induction ability of Maerua subcordata (fruit, leaf, root, seed) methanol extracts and selected candidate constituents thereof, identified by liquid chromatography coupled with multistage mass spectroscopy, employing an EpRE luciferase reporter gene assay using hepa-1c1c7 mouse hepatoma cells. A parallel Cytotox CALUX assay using human osteosarcoma U2OS cells was used to monitor any non-specific changes in luciferase activity or cytotoxicity. Results showed that fruit, root, and seed extracts were non-cytotoxic up to a concentration of 30 gram dry weight per litre but the leaf extract exhibited some cytotoxicity and that the leaf (despite some cytotoxicity), fruit, and seed extracts showed strong induction of EpRE mediated gene expression while induction by the root extract was minimal. Selected candidates included glucosinolates, isothiocyanates, and some biogenic amines. Subsequent studies showed that methyl-, ethyl-, isopropyl-, isobutyl- isothiocyanates, and sec-butyl thiocyanate as well as glucobrassicin induced concentration (1-100 μM) dependent EpRE-mediated gene expression while the biogenic amines stachydrine and trigonelline acted as inhibitors of EpRE-mediated gene expression at 100 μM. The identification of glucolepidiin, glucobrassicin, glucocapparin, stachydrine, and trigonelline in all extracts was confirmed using standards and based on multiple reaction monitoring; yet, glucobrassicin level in the root extract was negligible. In conclusion, this study provided a first report on EpRE mediated gene expression effects of M. subcordata; and despite detection of different glucosinolates in all extracts, those containing glucobrassicin particularly displayed high EpRE induction. Because EpRE inducers are cytoprotective and potential chemopreventive agents while inhibitors are suggested adjuvants of chemotherapy, results of this study imply that process manipulation of this plant may result in herbal preparations that may be used as chemopreventive agents or adjuvants of chemotherapies."
