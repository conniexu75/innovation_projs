https://openalex.org/W1998886157,"Liposomes can be designed to release an entrapped drug preferentially at temperatures attainable by mild local hyperthermia. In a test system in vitro, protein synthesis by Escherichia coli is inhibited and killing of the cells is enhanced by heating neomycin-containing liposomes to their phase transition temperature to maximize drug release. In the presence of serum the ratio of release at 44 degrees C to that at 37 degrees C can be made greater than 100:1, suggesting possible applications in the treatment of tumors or local infection."
https://openalex.org/W2066274406,"Double label immunofluorescence was used to study the distribution of fibronectin (LETS protein), actin and intermediate filaments in cultured cells. No relationship was observed between fibronectin and intermediate filaments, but fibronectin and actin showed coincident staining in a large proportion of cells during spreading or when fully spread. The distributions of actin and fibronectin staining during the course of cell spreading progressed through a series of patterns. Certain actin patterns correlated with certain fibronectin patterns. When fibrillar patterns developed, there was correspondence between the two fibrillar arrays in 80–100% of the cells. These results suggest a transmembrane relationship between microfilament bundles and fibronectin. We propose that fibronectin may participate in the formation of attachment plaques and discuss the interrelationship between plaques, microfilament bundles and fibronectin in cell-substratum and cell-cell contacts."
https://openalex.org/W2049031211,"The differences in the biochemistry of messenger RNA formation in eukaryotes compared to prokaryotes are so profound as to suggest that sequential prokaryotic to eukaryotic cell evolution seems unlikely. The recently discovered noncontiguous sequences in eukaryotic DNA that encode messenger RNA may reflect an ancient, rather than a new, distribution of information in DNA and that eukaryotes evolved independently of prokaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2065359944,"The tubulins of Aspergillus nidulans have been characterized in wild-type and ben A, B and C benomyl-resistant strains by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, co-polymerization with porcine brain tubulin and peptide mapping. Four α-tubulins and at least four β-tubulins were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of wild-type proteins. Eighteen of 26 benA mutants studied had electrophoretically abnormal β-tubulins. In these strains, one or more of the β-tubulins had either an altered isoelectric point or an altered electrophoretic mobility in the SDS gel dimension, or was diminished in amount. The a-tubulins were normal. Two-dimensional gels of protein extracts of a ben A/wild-type diploid strain demonstrated co-expression of the wild-type β-tubulins with the variant ben A tubulin. This experiment rules out post-translational modification as the source of the β-tubulin abnormalities in the benA mutants. We therefore conclude that benA must be a structural gene for β-tubulin. Due to the variety of abnormalities affecting β-tubulins in ben A mutants, and the absence of abnormalities affecting α-tubulins in any of the benomyl-resistant mutants, we also believe that the benomyl binding site must be located on the β-subunit of the tubulin dimer. The benA mutants of A. nidulans promise to be useful not only for characterizing the biochemical determinants of the benomyl binding site of tubulin but also for understanding the relationship between tubulin structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W1916818335,The mechanism of rifampicin inhibition of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase was studied with a newly developed steady state assay for RNA chain initiation and by analysis of the products formed with several 5'-terminal nucleotides. The major effect of rifampicin was found to be a total block of the translocation step that would ordinarily follow formation of the first phosphodiester bond. These effects were incorporated into a steric model for rifampicin inhibition. Additional minor effects of the enzyme bound inhibitor were to increase slightly the lifetime of RNA polymerase on the lambdaPR' promoter and to increase by two the apparent Michaelis constants of the initiating triphosphates. The products formed by RNA polymerase in the presence of rifampicin belong nearly exclusively to the class pppPupN. No evidence for the accumulation of such molecules was obtained in vivo.
https://openalex.org/W1988848573,"A temperature-sensitive mutant of E. coli, rne (RNAase E-), accumulates a number of relatively small RNA molecules at the nonpermissive temperature. One of these molecules, 9S, contains 5S rRNA sequences. The 9S RNA can be processed in vitro to 5S (p5) and a 4S-sized molecule. The 9S and the p5 and 4S RNAs processed from it were all characterized by RNAase T1 fingerprinting and pancreatic RNAase redigestion analysis. Unique oligonucleotides found in the p5 and the 4S RNA are present as unique oligonucleotides in the 9S RNA, suggesting that each 9S molecule contains one 5S and one 4S RNA moiety. Since the 9S RNA contains about 420 nucleotides, and intervening sequences are not known to exist in E. coli, the 5S an 4S RNAs cannot be more than 200 nucleotides apart in the genome. E. coli contains at least three different sequence variants of 5S rRNA, all of which can be identified in the 9S transcript, indicating that 9S RNA is transcribed from most, if not all, of the active rRNA genes, and that RNAase E processes transcripts derived from all these rRNA genes. No modified bases were found in the 4S RNA, nor was its sequence compatible with the known sequences of tRNAs found near the 5S rRNA. We therefore conclude that the 9S RNA doses not contain tRNA, and that the tRNA molecules located near the 5S rRNA are distal to it."

https://openalex.org/W1581531732,"A new assay yielding mechanistic information on the initiation reaction of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase has been developed. It was found to be useful in characterizing the promoters of bacteriophage DNA templates. The binding of the first two triphosphates in an RNA sequence was determined to be equilibrium ordered with ATP binding first followed by UTP on the lambda promoters PL. and PR. The products resulting from phosphodiester bond formation, pppApU and PPi, dissociated rapidly in the absence of the other triphosphates required for RNA synthesis. The resulting steady state conversion of ATP and UTP into pppApU was the basis for the new assay. The rate-limiting step in the initiation reaction was not precisely determined, but it was argued not to be entirely the release of product. The Zn2+ chelator, 1,10-phenanthroline, was partially characterized and found to be an uncompetitive inhibitor of ATP in the reaction (Ki = 100 micrometer). The unique advantage of this steady state assay is that several steps in the RNA initiation process are amplified kinetically and thus can be examined separately with techniques applicable to any other two-substrate, two-product enzyme reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1576755772,"The inducible, mannitol-specific Enzyme II of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system has been purified approximately 230-fold from Escherichia coli membranes. The enzyme, initially solubilized with deoxycholate, was first subjected to hydrophobic chromatography on hexyl agarose and then purified by several ion exchange steps in the presence of the nonionic detergent, Lubrol PX. The purified protein appears homogeneous by several criteria and probably consists of a single kind of polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 60,000 (+/- 5%). In addition to catalyzing phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of mannitol in the presence of the soluble enzymes of the phosphotransferase system, the purified Enzyme II also catalyzes mannitol 1-phosphate:mannitol transphosphorylation in the absence of these components. A number of other physical and catalytic properties of the enzyme are described. The availability of a stable, homogeneous Enzyme II should be invaluable for studying the mechanism of sugar translocation and phosphorylation catalyzed by the bacterial phosphotransferase system."

https://openalex.org/W2007570498,"Chemotactic bacteria, such as E. coli, detect changes in the chemical composition of the environment. Addition of an attractant or repellent leads to an immediate response, characterized by a change in the swimming behavior of the cells--a process known as sensory excitation. However, the response gradually disappears with time, despite the continued presence of the chemical--a process known as sensory adaptation. We report here the behavior of a class of nonchemotactic mutants (cheX) that can carry out sensory excitation but are defective in the process of sensory adaptation. These mutants are also defective in the ability to carry out a protein methylation reaction which has previously been implicated in the adaptation process (Goy, Springer and Adler, 1977). The results presented here establish a firm relationship between the methylation reaction and sensory adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2080632447,"The ability of E. coli to adapt to constant levels of attractant and repellent chemicals was studied by examining the patterns of flagellar movement in cells subjected to abrupt concentration changes. Wild-type bacteria exhibited transient responses to such stimuli, in support of previous findings. Nonchemotactic mutants of the cheX class responded to both attractants and repellents, but were unable to terminate these behavioral changes as long as the stimulating chemical was present. The sensory adaptation defect of cheX strains may be due to an inability to methylate several cytoplasmic membrane proteins that initiate changes in flagellar movement in response to chemoreceptor signals. Based on these results, possible mechanisms of stimulus transduction and sensory adaptation during chemotaxis are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1972467983,"Purified, intact yeast plasma membranes were allowed to synthesize chitin, and the nascent chains of polysaccharide were observed either by the fluorescence produced with a brightener or by autoradiography. By both methods, it was concluded that the newly formed chitin emerged at many sites on each membrane. Thus, the synthetase that catalyzes chitin formation has a similar distribution. Since chitin synthetase is found mainly in a zymogen form, these results confirm the hypothesis that initiation of the chitinous primary septum of Saccharomyces occurs by localized activation of the uniformly distributed zymogen."

https://openalex.org/W2004406095,"To determine which enzymes are responsible for the processing cleavages of ribosomal RNA transcripts in Escherichia coil, we constructed a mutant strain lacking RNAase III and containing a thermolabile RNAase P. At the nonpermissive temperature, this strain accumulates a novel “19S” RNA species which contains 17S precursor rRNA sequences covalently linked to tRNA sequences transcribed from the ribosomal RNA spacer region between the 16S and the 23S rRNA cistrons. In vitro treatment of 19S RNA with cell extracts releases tRNA2Glu and other tRNA species. These “spacer” tRNA sequences are apparently not contained within the 18S RNA species found in an RNAase III- RNAase P+ cell. RNAase P-deficient extracts are incapable of cleaving spacer tRNA from 19S RNA, indicating that RNAase P is required for the release of spacer tRNAs from rRNA transcripts of E. coli cells."

It was solubilized from cytoplasmic membranes by treatment with Sarkosyl/cholate mixture and purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. The purified cytochrome b556 is an oligomer composed of identical polypeptides, with a molecular weight of 17,500, determined by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. It contains equimolar amounts of heme and polypeptide but no detectable non-heme iron, phospholipid, or dehydrogenase. Its isoelectric point was determined to be 8.5.

https://openalex.org/W2078532746,"We performed a genetic and sequencing analysis of insertions of the transposon Tn9 into the lac operon of E. coli. Genetic mapping of 70 insertions into lacl and Z shows that starting from the same point on the chromosome, Tn9 goes to at least 50 different points in these two genes. Although there are preferred regions for insertion, these consist of multiple integration points within a small area, as demonstrated by pairwise crosses and restriction mapping. Sequence analysis of three Tn9 insertions reveals that Tn9 integration is associated with a direct repeat of 9 base pairs (bp) of host sequence. We show that these extra 9 nucleotide pairs are generated upon insertion and not brought in with the element."
https://openalex.org/W1546854293,"The glutamyl-tRNA synthetase has been purified to homogeneity from Escherichia coli with a yield of about 50%. It is a monomer with a molecular weight of 56,000 and has the same kinetic properties as those of the alpha chain of the dimeric alphabeta-glutamyl-tRNA synthetase described previously (Lapointe, J., and Soll, D. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 4966-4974). It is the smallest amino-acyl-tRNA synthetase purified from E. coli and contains no important sequence repetition. It is also the only monomeric aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase reported so far to contain no major sequence duplication. Considering its structural and mechanistic similarities with the glutaminyl- and the arginyl-tRNA synthetases of E. coli, we propose the existence of a relation between the true monomeric character of the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (as opposed to monomers with sequence duplications) and its requirement for tRNA in the activation of glutamate. A single sulfhydryl group of the native enzyme reacts with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) causing no loss of enzymatic activity, whereas four such groups per enzyme react in the presence of 4 M guanidine HCl."

The major products were 7,9-dihydroxy-4,13-diketo-dinor-prostanoic acid and dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha. They represented 25% and 10% of the total radioactivity, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1514362229,"Kinetic studies with ADP-glucose synthase show that 1,6-hexanediol bisphosphate (1,6-hexanediol-P2) is an effective activator that causes the enzyme to have a higher apparent affinity for ATP- and ADP-glucose than when fructose-1,6-P2 is the activator. Furthermore, in the presence of 1,6-hexanediol-P2, substrate saturation curves are hyperbolic shaped rather than sigmoidal shaped. CrATP behaves like a nonreactive analogue of ATP. Kinetic studies show that it is competitive with ATP. CrATP is not a competitive inhibitor of ADP-glucose. However, the combined addition of CrATP and glucose-1-P inhibits the enzyme competitively when ADP-glucose is the substrate. In binding experiments, CrATP, ATP, and fructose-P2 appear to bind to only half of the expected sites in the tetrameric enzyme, while ADP-glucose, the activators, pyridoxal-P and 1,6-hexanediol-P2, and the inhibitor, AMP, bind to four sites/tetrameric enzyme. Fructose-P2 inhibits 1,6-hexanediol-P2 binding, suggesting competition for the same sites. Glucose-1-P does not bind to the enzyme unless MgCl2 and CrATP are present and binds to four sites/tetrameric enzyme. Alternatively, CrATP in the presence of glucose-1-P binds to four sites/tetrameric enzyme. Thus, there are binding sites for the substrates, activators, and inhibitor located on each subunit and the binding sites can interact homotropically and heterotropically. ATP and fructose-P2 binding is synergistic showing heterotropic cooperativity. ATP and fructose-P2 must also be present together to effectively inhibit AMP binding. A mechanism is proposed which explains some of the kinetic and binding properties in terms of an asymmetry in the distribution of the conformational states of the four identical subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1599638312,"The fidelity with which Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I copies poly[d(A-T)] has been studied. The poly[d(A-T)] template was synthesized by E. coli DNA polymerase I in a de nouo reaction using dTTP and dATP in the presence of radioactive dGTP. The poly[d(A-T)] product synthesized in the de nouo reaction contained 1± 0.5 mol of dGMP for every 2 × l0 6 mol of dAMP and dTMP polymerized. In copying this template, the apparent error rate of E. coli DNA polymerase I is 1 in 80,000 with dGTP and 1 in 8,000 with dCTP as the noncomplementary nucleotide. The product of the reaction with dGTP or dCTP as the noncomplementary nucleotide was analyzed by enzymatic hydrolysis and subsequent chromatography of the nucleotide monomers. With dGTP, the noncomplementary nucleotide can be identified in the poly[d(A-T)] product as dGMP and is invariably incorporated as a single base substitution in place of dAMP. In contrast, with [ 3 H]dCTP, the majority of the incorporated label was identified as dUMP or dTMP suggesting that the high error rate may represent the incorporation of a contaminant. This misincorporation of dGMP requires Mg 2+ , poly[d(A-T)], polymerase, and d'lTP. Omission of dATP results in an enhanced incorporation of dGMP. The frequency of dGTP incorporation into poly[d(A-T)] was markedly reduced by increasing the concentration of dATP but not dTTP. A similar substrate competition is observed with the DNA polymerase from avian myeloblastosis virus with poly[d(A-T)] as a template. 
However, with both enzymes, there is a lack of substrate competition with homopolymer templates. Thus, the lack of substrate competition in copying homopolymers is determined by the nature of the template and does not provide evidence for multiple catalytic nucleotide binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2148260424,"Nematodes synthesize two major classes of myosin heavy chains. These heavy chains associate to form only homodimeric myosin molecules, and these myosin homodimers are anti-genically different from one another ( Garcea et al., 1978 Garcea R.L. Schachat F. Epstein H.F. Coordinate synthesis of two myosins in wild-type and mutant nematode muscle during larval development. Cell. 1978; 15: 421-428 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar ). The two myosins may be designated unc-54 myosin, since this species is altered in mutants of the unc-54 locus, and non-unc-54 myosin, since this class is not affected in unc-54 mutants. We present here experiments in which specific anti-myosin IgG and anti-unc-54 myosin IgG are used to locate the two myosins within the same body-wall muscle cells of Caenorhabditis elegans. These results are necessary for further evaluation of the possible functions of the two myosin homodimers in the thick filaments of these muscles. Myosin can be localized to all body-wall and pharyngeal muscle cells using anti-myosin antibody. In longitudinal sections of body-wall muscle, the staining with anti-myosin coincides with the birefringence of A bands that contain thick filaments. Anti-unc-54 myosin stains all body-wall A bands uniformly but does not react with the pharynx. This result demonstrates that unc-54 is located exclusively in body-wall muscle cells of the wild-type strain N2. Non-unc-54 myosin is localized with anti-myosin in all body-wall muscle cells of the unc-54 null mutant E190, as expected; however, unc-54 myosin could not be detected by anti-unc-54 myosin antibody in this mutant. Since we can localize unc-54 myosin and non-unc-54 myosin in all body-wall muscle cells of wild-type and E190, respectively, we conclude that the two myosins must be present in the same muscle cells. In addition, since unc-54 myosin is located in all body-wall A bands, at least some sarcomeres must contain both myosins. This conclusion is consistent with the observations of Garcea et al., 1978 Garcea R.L. Schachat F. Epstein H.F. Coordinate synthesis of two myosins in wild-type and mutant nematode muscle during larval development. Cell. 1978; 15: 421-428 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar that wild-type and E190 synthesize similar amounts of non-unc-54 myosin. Within the limits of resolution of our methods, unc-54 myosin is distributed throughout body-wall A bands. We conclude, therefore, that the majority of thick filaments within these A bands must contain unc-54 myosin along their entire length. Possible roles for unc-54 and non-unc-54 myosins in the assembly and organization of thick filaments are discussed."

Three independent relAnon mutants were isolated on the phage. In all three, the relaxed phenotype was suppressed by supD, supE, supF or sup6. Three independent relAins mutants were isolated, all containing an insertion element (probably IS2) in an apparently identical location in the relA gene. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of peptides synthesized by the phages in ultraviolet lightkilled host cells revealed that no stringent factor was coded for by either the relAins or relAnon phages (the latter in a sup+ cell); stringent factor was detected when the relAnon phages were used in a similar experiment with supD or supE host cells. The relAnon and relAins mutations could be crossed in haploid form in the E. coli chromosome. These recombinants grew with a normal doubling time, had a ppGpp pool which was between 70 and 100% compared with the classical relA strain, and underwent a normal carbon source shift-down. A restriction endonuclease map of the pyrG relA region of the specialized transducing phage is presented in which the position of the insertion element (recognized by a novel Hind III-cut site) defines the position of the relA gene. This position was verified by an analysis of the structure of five plasmids formed by cloning portions of the region in the pBR322 cloning vehicle. Our results indicate that the relA gene is not an essential cellular function, that there might be a second mechanism for the synthesis of basal level ppGpp in the cell and that the sole function of the relA gene is apparently the high level ppGpp synthesis triggered in response to deacylated tRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1499338514,"The thermal denaturation of aspartate transcarbamoylas of Escherichia coli was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry. Isolated regulatory and catalytic subunits were heat denatured at 55 and 80 degrees C, respectively. In contrast, the intact enzyme was denatured in two steps. A small endotherm near 73 degrees C was assoicated with denaturation of the regulatory subunits and the major endotherm at 82 degrees C with denaturation of the catalytic subunits. Thus regulatory subunits are stabilized against heat denaturation by more than 17 degrees C when incorporated in the enzyme. Similar conclusions were obtained from measurements of the enthalpy of heat denaturation. Regulatory subunits yielded a much lower value of the enthalpy of denaturation, 1.91 cal/g, than that found for the catalytic subunit, 3.94 cal/g, or typical globular proteins (4 to 6 cal/g). When the regulatory subunits were incorporated into aspartate transcarbamoylase their enthalpy of denaturation was increased 125% (to 4.3 cal/g). The enthalpy of the catalytic subunits in the intact enzyme was increased 38% (enthalpy of denaturation of 5.43 cal/g). Stabilization of the isolated catalytic subunit as well as the intact enzyme was achieved by the addition of the bisubstrate analog N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate. Similarly the allosteric effectors, CTP and ATP, stabilized the isolated regulatory subunits or those subunits within the intact enzyme. However, the addition of the bisubstrate analog caused a decrease in the enthalpy of denaturation of the regulatory subunits within the enzyme. These results are consistent with other studies of the ligand-promoted conformational changes in the native enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1513568107,"Oxidative deamination of the epsilon-amino group of lysyl residues to form allysine is the initial reaction in the cross-linking of collagen and elastin in vertebrates. The allysyl residues, generated by lysyl oxidase in this reaction, condense with either other allysyl residues or epsilon-amino groups of lysyl or hydroxylysyl to form aldol or Schiff base cross-links. This paper presents evidence that similar allysyl residues and Schiff base cross-links are synthesized in cell envelopes of Escherichia coli. Acid hydrolysis followed by amino acid analysis of envelopes either reduced with NaB[3H]4 or labeled with [14C]lysine and reduced with NaBH4 yielded allysine and two labeled fragments with elution profiles and molecular weights (250 and 330) consistent with Schiff base products derived at least in part from allysine. When [6-3H]lysine-labeled cell envelopes were incubated at 37 degrees C, gradual release of tritiated water occurred. This suggests that an enzymatic reaction catalyzes the deamination of lysine in E. coli membranes and that the higher molecular weight proteins detected in stationary phase or in log phase cell envelopes after NaBH4 reduction occur as a result of formation of Schiff base cross-links."

Purified dicarboxylate membrane transport components (SBP 1 and SBP 2) from Escherichia coli K12 were added to rat myoblasts and mouse L-cells. These components were readily incorporated into the cell membranes. The rat myoblasts, as well as the mouse L-cells, were unable to transport succinate by themselves, or in the presence of either one of the transport components. However, when both components were added to the cells, the latter acquired the ability to transport succinate. There was a direct relationship between the amount of transport components added and the rate of succinate uptake. The newly acquired dicarboxylate transport system exhibited similar substrate affinity and specificity as the E. coli dicarboxylate transport system.

https://openalex.org/W1879233249,"The interaction of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamylase with linear-benzo-ATP has been investigated by means of fluorescence spectroscopy. The fluorescent nucleotide analogue activates the enzyme to the same extent as ATP. Fluorescence polarization has been used to determine the association constant of lin-benzo-ATP with aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase) which is 5 X 10(-3) M-1 at pH 8.7, at 4 degrees C, assuming six binding sites. This association constant is similar to those previously obtained for ATP at a variety of temperatures, buffers, and pH. The fluorescence emission of lin-benzo-ATP is not quenched when bound to ATCase, which indicates absence of pi interactions between the activator and tyrosyl residues in the protein. These residues have been implicated in the stereochemical mechanism of allosteric interactions in ATCase. Furthermore, this fluorescence behavior implicates hydrogen bond formation between the amino group of lin-benzo-ATP and a nucleophilic center at the enzyme binding site. The fact that lin-benzo-ATP activates ATCase is consistent with a previously published model for nucleotide regulation of the enzyme."

The location of many fragments suitable for sequence analysis could be established using as markers 29 large RNase T1-resistant oligonucleotides with known map positions. Applying this method four fragments originating from the coat protein cistron were isolated and analyzed. The sequence of a segment of 239 nucleotides located immediately adjacent to the initiation triplet was determined to be G-C-A-A-A-A-U-U-A-G-A-G-A-C-U-G-U-U-A-C-U-U-U-A-G-G-U-A-A-C-A-U-C-G-G-G-A-A-A-G-A-U-G-G-A-A-A-A-C-A-A-A-C-U-C-U-G-G-U-C-C-U-C-A-A-U-C-C-G-C-G-U-G-G-G-G-U-A-A-A-U-C-C-C-A-C-U-A-A-C-G-G-C-G-U-U-G-C-C-U-C-G-C-U-U-U-C-A-C-A-A-G-C-G-G-G-U-G-C-A-G-U-U-C-C-U-G-C-G-C-U-G-G-A-G-A-A-G-C-G-U-G-U-U-A-C-C-G-U-U-U-C-G-G-U-A-U-C-U-C-A-G-C-C-U-U-C-U-C-G-C-A-A-U-C-G-U-A-A-G-A-A-C-U-A-C-A-A-G-G-U-C-C-A-G-G-U-U-A-A-G-A-U-C-C-A-G-A-A-C-C-C-G-A-C-C-G-C-U-U-G-C-A-C-U-G-C-A-A-A-C-G-G-U-U-C-U-U-Gp. The primary structure and the secondary structure model derived from it did not provide any evidence of homology with the corresponding RNA region of bacteriophage MS2."
https://openalex.org/W1607211267,"Leucyl-tRNA synthetase from Escherichia coli is rapidly inactivated by 6-amino-7-chloro-5,8-dioxoquinoline (quinone), a model substance for cytostatic quinones. Loss of activity follows pseudo-first order kinetics. The quinone masks essential–SH groups that are reactive with N-ethylmaleimide. Specific protection of the enzyme by leucine provides evidence for active site-directed modification. Half-maximal protection is found at a concentration of 150 micron which is identical with the dissociation constant of the enzyme.substrate complex. The competitive inhibitor leucinol also protects the enzyme from inactivation by the quinone. MgATP enhances the protective effect of leucinol about 250-fold, thus substantiating recently published findings on synergistic coupling of ligands to aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The results support the assumption that the bacteriostatic quinone directly interferes with leucyl-tRNA synthetase in growing cells. Active-site-directed inhibition of the enzyme could adequately explain the phenotypically observed auxotrophy for leucine of quinone-treated E. coli."
